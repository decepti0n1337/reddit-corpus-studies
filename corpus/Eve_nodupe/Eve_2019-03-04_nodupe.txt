Idiot trash tier human libtard goon (ingame) ,who got offendet by civil discussion and beaten by FACTS and KNOWLEGE, has to fall back to violence to silence the voice of justice!

it's worse to pull implants when you lose a super, than to not have them at all
---
So everyone seems to be freaking out about somebody's "Komodo" getting destroyed. Why is it such a big deal? How much was it worth? Why was this only the first time that a "Komodo" got destroyed and how did it happen?
---
But muh Komodo....
---
I mean if somebody really wants to dec a corp that mainly consists of pilots flying Asetro's and t2 covops ships be my guest, like it becomes even less relevant under new mechanics because the price increase massively for a small alt corp meaning nobody sane is gonna wardec that corp.
---
The fact I have to contact a player owned group and might get lucky and roll into an abandoned wormhole to transfer poco's might be a minor issue with the mechanics, it's almost as CCP didn't consider you could be put in a position where you could not drop your structures. 
---
So I think instead of top 10, all people online with a bounty should be shown, and maybe show the region of any bounty, if you happen to be in the same region. Maybe top ten could always have the region they are in pop up all the time no matter what. But this is my two cents. 
---
i wanna try it......

dumb gons so dumb. mine more spod gons hahaha pets/blob/botters/inputbroadcasting.
---
did i do gud son?
---
I never understood bounties, you kill the guy, but only get a bit of the bounty, and get more if you kill him again? Which was put in to prevent people from out right cheating the system? It never seemed like anything that was all that lucrative.
---
public bids tend to go much higher than private ones
---
Maybe even have the exact system minute by minute...i like where youre going with that thought 
---
low effort bait.....
---
Thanks, I haven't played in about two years, but even when I did I mined. Never messed with trying to bounty hunt. Not having any idea where a bounty was, and given how big the universe is, made it seem like needle in a haystack kinda thing. 
---
No it wouldn't, but it would be a lot better then the shit we got ATM with minimal changes needed by ccp
---
I appreciate your cynicism even if nobody else does
---
This one time at goon camp.. 
---
It takes a lot of courage to own this post.
---
But why is it fair for suspect or people with limited engagements to have neutral logi, but not wardecced people?
---
cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool

That was a nice Komodo.

Bounty Hunter should be a real occupation in EVE, it just fits. CCP should really look at it again.
---
He accidentally jumped the battleship through a gate instead of his ceptor while moving ships out of wormhole space, apparently 
---
Some people gathered a lot of bounty over time.
---
and you could claim all of it, if you just died to your alt in your shuttle.
---
Listen to this man, he's in Goon's biggest PvP sig.
---
Probably lost the faction titan because he didnt have implants. 
---
New system to "watchlist" titan pilots you say?
---
aren't you technically posting on it?
---
Right but the fact that it's not travel fit outside of the hole he intended to use it, with the mods safely moved, is a decision making failure. More so than one misclick.
---
Wonderful
---
Nope. Just means it's a smaller target.

putting salt on shit makes it better but no one is gonna eat it outside of the people who would eat it anyway

Wonderful poem and a fitting tribute.

Not totally true. People gravitate to null specifically to do larger fleets, get spoonfed content and do dank pve/rorq-mine. Other people gravitate to Thera for what it brings to the table. 
---
I don't know of any big null blob that has a small-gang SIG as it tends to be one at the corp/buddies level. 
---
My assumption is that everybody who plays EVE is a horrible human being. It's pretty much a game designed for people with a total lack of any moral compass. To me, this kind of talk is functionally equivalent to saying "gf".
---
Komodo is the Guristas faction Titan. They were introduced into the game in [November 2017](https://www.eveonline.com/article/patch-notes-for-eve-online-lifeblood). The Komodo is a rare drop (in BPC form) from a hard to find NPC Sotiyo that requires a coordinated team effort to beat. [Gallant Ronuken's Komodo](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75489664/) represents the first ever recorded loss of its kind. Its value is roughly equivalent to the cost of a ten year subscription to EVE.

Oh god you're updating evefeed?

I thought it was a one off "haha look at this parody of a satire site".

Please don't become the next eveonion poster. That spam is trash tier.
---
Holy shit dude.  Get over yourself.  Literally GSF is fighting over in the East, and have been for longer than your little deployment.  And they have been pulling PANFAM into all of their fights.  Just because you guys are getting your shit kicked in because you overextended doesn't mean that you guys are the only ones fighting.
---
Why would you pick a place to live before deciding if you want to do what's available there?
---
We deploy for content as one of just a few alliances that even bother to do this anymore and it's called 'overextension'
---
This risk aversion is going to kill this game. Fuck r/eve

Your "permanent staging area".  No, that is your home region.  Where all of the residents there constantly feed.  At least put up a fight to protect your renters.

And no, it will be a retreat disguised as "ok guys, that was fun, let us go back home" without actually doing anything in the north other than get swatted.

hopefully cargo expanded t1 haulers gating through lowsec

Looks actually kinda fun for F1 pushing.

And a fc who doesn't scream on comms, this is some kind of F1 paradise.

Pity you had to bring the fax in but overall a decent compilation.

Also nice to see Clon3 die, twice :P

Pretty sure all the purple in the world wouldn’t have saved you there. Worst case Frat would have just waited a few minutes and sent a second DD volley at you

no

There's not that much to burn

HE GUN LERN TODAY!

prolly 40-50b if your patient

Thanks, I appreciate it o7
---
Thank you for the kind words
---
None of that says not a bot.
---
I need the rest of the killmail to see the true despair in this
---
Use an auction contract. Start the bidding at 10b, no other reserve, and just let it ride for 7-14 days, depending on how impatient you are. (Also ignore all messages etc. that you receive, if 10B isn't already enough of a bargain for someone, they are a scammer). You will probably get about 12B for it which will mostly replace the hull once you are in Delve. Cheaper and certainly easier and safer than trying to move it.
---
sent ;^)
---
no it was when the pod died only
---
+1 upvote for anyone that answers  "bots"
---
This is a hard one to fix. With alts, the bounty system will never be relevant. All I can think of is having the bounty kill take away a significant amount of skillpoints as well. But then this will open another bag of worms. 
---
If they really want a decent bounty system they should do them for NPC pirates. Sort of like the burner missions. But stronger and bigger. Have the NPC pirate gain more bounty every time they kill someone. 
---
start playing a decade ago.

Arent there warp/speed/gun implants too

baited on a wally post today huh?

Admitting to rmt is generally not a good idea here brodie
---
The bounty system is just an idiot tax on high sec players.
---
Just take you and 2 of your friends and you could lock down Hek or Rens 
---
Even with a full purple fit, taking that many DD's to the face- it was dead regardless.
---
&gt; First, answer the question of what do you want to do? As much as we complain, Eve is a game unrivaled in content and different activities you can take part in.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Second, answer the question of where do you want to live? Highsec, Lowsec, FW lowsec, NPC nullsec, SOV nullsec, WH space, etc.
---
&gt; Third, answer the question of how do you want to play Eve? Do you want to be solo, NPSI, small gang, Large SOV fleets, etc.
---
it was a reply to that order of operations rather then my making up order aka my criticism mirror's well your own. 
---
What if I told you that this change actually changes nothing?
---
this is actually a quality post, your taste is just flawed
---
&gt;How to fix bounty system
---
&gt;Doesn’t understand why bounty system is broken
---
That's what happens when you shit fit and don't use implants.
---
I suspect you don't understand crimewatch as well as you think you do :D
---
If you are shot by someone, and it's not a legitimate commbat, then no limited engagement is formed, and the only flag which is created is the criminal flag for the ganker (and the PvP timers). 
---
If someone engaged in a war is shot by the opposing side, no flags are given other than the PvP timers. No limited engagement.
---
Limited engagements are formed when someone who is not a valid target, shoots someone who is a valid target (such as someone with a criminal or suspect flag.) This is so that the person being shot can shoot back. That's the only reason they exist.
---
And as per the dev blog: The increased penalty for neutral targeted assistance will also apply to limited engagements 
---
Komodo isn't from a bpo...do need a bit more capital components vs a regular titan, though
---
I said that GSF is taking the heat off of you (in fact, were deployed before you were), not that they are in the actual battles with you.  
---
I have said nothing about risk aversion, or anything to suggest I'm being risk averse.  I'm saying that parading around acting like you are making a difference, when, in fact, you are merely feeding, is dumb.  One of just a few alliances that bother to do that?  PL invaded Provi for content last year.  TEST has been fighting various entities for content for a long while now.  GSF has been fighting for content.  Plenty of folks dicking around in Pure Blind.  BL doing what BL does.  Wow, look, all the major groups are represented.  Don't act like you guys are the only ones trying to get fights.
---
Are.... are you counting Burn Jita as a goon deployment at Panfam?  
---
holy shit the spinning.  
---
Also yeah, PL, Goons, Test, Init. That's about it. And it's telling that you had to go to EARLY LAST YEAR to find an example of Panfam deploying.  
---
Then perhaps you'd better explain why, 
---
I actually agree that the price won't drop all that much during a sale, and the history of sales tends to back that up. But I don't think it has much to do with SP farmers.
---
The extremely rich market guys support the price during sales enough that it only drops ~10% or so, because they can turn that around fairly quickly afterward for easy profit. The exception was MPTCs which CCP was dumping in huge quantities on the market during the pack sales last year. A sale on packs will drop the price of those, and thus injectors, but not to 2018 levels.

&gt;So what's the going rate for plex these days? When I started plexing accounts it was around 350 mil and when I left it was around 1.2 bil.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plexing two accounts in hi sec went from plexing my accounts ina few solid days of grinding to a couple weeks when it hit 1.2. So what's the going rate for plexing now? And how long does it take doing missions or incursions? If that's even a viable way to earn isk anymore?  
---
&gt;Also this free to play model from what I understand I wont be able to fly my t2 and t3 ships out of null so without paying for monthly fees how can I get my stuff out of null ? Do they offer a free week or month or anything to returning players?  
---
&gt;PS. I enjoyed Null ratting also loved scanning sites down and doing those in null. I did enjoy level 4 and incursions in hi sec. And small fleet pvp roams were always fun. Wormholes as well I found interesting and would dabble with those sometimes.  
---
&gt;Hated deployment and the big wars. And never liked low sec pvp gate camping. What things might I like or dislike about the current state of the game? It's been about 4 years. Thanks  
---
&gt;(On a side note if anyone wants to donate two plex to help make a return hmu going to install eve and take a look)
---
Plex is hovering between 1.8-1.9 Bil / 500 right now. That is a months sub. All the HS ISK generation remained pretty much the same except T5 Abyss sites. Those are high risk, high reward.
---
Realistically, if you want to plex an account in HS, then concentrate on Burner Missions and T5 Abyss. Do any other stuff on the side to break the monotony.
---
WH dives are a crap shoot. Too much RNG. There is RNG on actual drops from sites, RNG if you get popped or not, and RNG if an army of bots rolls through a bunch of WHs and picks everything clean before you get there you may or may not make better ISK then you would using the 1st 2 methods. If you are a WH resident, then its a different story.
---
Can someone explain market pvp to me? I originally thought it was just buy low sell high but from other conversations I think it is May more complicated than that.
---
Fit variations is something in game fitting desperately needs. Not just cargo but fitting swaps so you can make them fast. 
---
OK, yea, I had a feeling, would have been nice to be able to test it though. Maybe you should forward this to CCP, it does kinda sound like a possible loophole.
---
I'm going to save this for when other people ask this question. It's a really solid framework for corp searching. 
---
nice komod- oh wait
---
Yup .. definitely a quality of life .. plus being able to also bake in target skill levels as well.. ie you can fit the rorq to undock it but to fly it .. that requires extra skills above minimums to get max gains ... 
---
This kind of does fix the issues even though it doesn’t address low payout. Do this and people will know how to find a gated person easily. Knowing where they are puts a spotlight on them and more will try to kill them. The payout is still shitty but the bounty placed still sees the bad guy get killed....
---
Albeit, more fixes would be nice ofc. 
---
^ Aww Burrnnn... That’s going to leave a mark haha
---
Lol k
---
Get fuck you mean.
---
If his responses were beep boop then you have been misled friendo!
---
You have to ask the question, “Why do people use neutral logi?” and “Why is neutral logi so strong. 
---
When you answer these questions you should arrive at some form of the answer, “because it allows for near risk free scouting”. 
---
A good secondary answer would be, “because it allows that player to stay out of the fight until logi is absolutely needed instead of having it in corp and vulnerable to the other side the entire time.”
---
A good tertiary option could be, “because most groups outside those pvp’ing primarily in highsec use neutral logi as an advantage over those that don’t”
---
So we’ve asked the questions and hopefully answered them. Now you just have to have a basic grasp of game mechanics and how to make them work for you.
---
It’s funny that all these idiots in this thread are so wrapped up on the wrong way to go about exploiting a loophole in this. I don’t blame them because I remember brainstorming the same thing years ago to find a way to abuse logi - I tested it, and I ended up bummed.
---
I will tell you that so far in this thread only one guy here has the right idea. It doesn’t elaborate on the extent nor the brokenness of it, but it’s the basis of what I’m talking about. This change is pointless for a few reasons:
---
- First I think that it came about because people don’t like being at a disadvantage. It’s obvious, people from areas outside Highsec HATE being bested or fooled by “fucking stupid highsec mechanics”
---
- Second, contact list exists for a reason. Mark suspected neutral logi and bring common neutral logi busters in your fleet.
---
- Third, there’s a loophole that exists in the game that has been petitioned many many times over the past years and CCP has deemed it “okay”.
---
No, I won’t elaborate on the details. It’s a mechanic that I’ve used extensively. 
---
I feel this entire concept could be simplified to “no more fence sitting, join a fight expect to be either killed by the opposition and/or concord.. choose carefully”
---
The rest is splitting hairs on how close to the edge you can push being a logi without being slapped .. sure a loophole *may* emerge but doubtful it will stay that way as the *intent* is to stop getting heals from the sidelines without any skin in the fight ...???
---
Honestly I did diplo, I was wardecd first, offered peace, but then they shit talk, then racism, and after they lost structure, the shit talker left alliance. And I'd rather rid new eden of such a terrible ceo who is just gonna recruit noobs and make them go inactive. More logical then emotional. But I do have 4 alts. I suppose I could make gank catalyst.. But that's kind of a pain. One that requires a lot of work waiting for the perfect easy target, which will likely just be one of the unatended newbros in a venture. A wardec would likely keep new bros from joining a shitty group the first place. 
---
can you link your C3 PVE lost from a random C4 corp please ?
---
I've already double confirmed with them. As per my other posts.
---
nothing like experience after all
---
&gt; Suddenly, pretty much overnight, my 2-3 bil worth of parts was worth 100+ billion isk,
---
patch speculation can be a bit of a gamble but it can also pay off very well. Usually need a bunch of liquid isk to buy the items, early knowledge is good for getting the lowest prices, and some good timing to get a good price when selling, sell too fast and you miss the pop, wait too long and prices might have come down already. 
---
&gt; Its value is greater than the cost of a ten year subscription to EVE.
---
Wow that gives it a lot of perspective
---
We sadly do not have the isk income to afford the loss that will become doing so. Which is why I asked for goons to do so.
---
&gt;Abyssal Pvp

It’s funny to see “rmt bad” in an eve sub where buying plex officially is literally rmt.
---
Aucune idée.
---
[You got that?](https://vimeo.com/321007417)
---
 OK, I ddidn't see that, sorry
---
No, I'm not counting Burn Jita.  I'm talking about GSF sigs and squads being deployed to the Galactic East for several months now.  
---
Hey I'm not a market guy but it's definitely more complicated than that. Some people make the market their main source of income or even their main occupation - these are some of the richest players in the game. Obviously, they will have developed some pretty advanced techniques over the years. Not only that, but real-life market principles are applicable to the game, so they can draw on those as well. 
---
For example, goons will often manipulate the market by buying up the entirety of a given resource. Let's say they chose Tritanium as their target tomorrow. They'll have the poorer players buy up the cheapest 5-10% of all Tritanium in Jita. Then the moguls such as Aryth step in and by the rest of the supply. Now that they hold 100% of all Jita volume for Tritanium, they can sell it at any price they chose. So they re-list it for, say, twice as much as they bought it for, and they keep buying up anything anyone else tries to sell at a lower price. Once they sell their stock, they will have effectively doubled their investment. 
---
Buying low and selling high is also more complex than it sounds. Some players and groups will go a long way to speculate which resources or items will increase in price in the forseeable future, for example due to a patch that creates more demand for them, or a shift in the meta that sees more use from a given ship. For example, Muninns were barely ever used before the HAC rebalance last year, and now they are by far the most popular cruiser doctrine in nullsec, so whoever had the foresight to invest in them on time profited a lot. 
---
On the other hand, some market shifts are relatively well known in advance. When CCP announced they were over-hauling moon mining, everyone knew moon goo and all items produced from it would spike in price, so a lot of people stocked up for months in advance. 
---
Some more interesting info can be found on [this Talking in Stations episode with Aryth and Probag Bear](https://www.talkinginstations.com/2018/04/tis-04-15-18-probank-economic-age/).
---
The Tornado is a bit of a... unique ship. 8x1400mm Howitzers, some Gyrostabilizers, and... probably some Sensor Boosters or Tracking Computers. And usually nothing else, no armor no shields no hull. This is a very one-purpose ship: one-shot-kill a target, and then... well if there was more than one target there or you didn't kill it, you die.
---
It's a very funny ship to fly. But yeah. No tank, no survival.
---
Don't cut them a dime on that loot.  Also don't blow your load injecting either

---
Crabbed my first 3 billion in a Vexor Navy issue, got a Nidhoggur, now I'm casually crabbing. I'm buying trashloot and salvage from corpies 100% of the evepraisal Jita buy, which is actually profitable. Still saving up for my skillfarms. Yes people hate that this thing exists, but on the other hand "something something, capitalism and free markets", right?
---
I think of opening an import/export business for faction modules to my nullsec home.
---
Never not give your enemy's cap? 
---
Having flown with this pilot I can confirm this is probably what he said. Arexand is pretty chill and he'll say things sardonically but he is essentially good-natured about kills though obviously losing nearly everything is kind of a bummer.
---
The site is trash because buzz feed is trash, satire.
---
I enjoy the content 
---
For explorers, is there any advantage (loot, etc) to running sites in sovereign nullsec vs NPC null? I've been running sites in the NPC null region that borders my highsec home, and often it's quite crowded with players and many of the signatures have already been exploited when I get there.
---
We did burn amarr one year. Burning dodixie and hek would be a waste of time; 1DQ1-A is a better market than those ghost towns.
---
CAP THE ENEMIES TO DEATH

that'll show 'em.

"large list of blues" lel its only the whole southern side of the map, don't worry though, cause burning 80 jumps for content is fun :)

Botters.
---
They're probably just glad that someone in Horde got it before whatever other group's random looter did.
---
People would do this in delve but we have rorqual bots that dont die to ass frigs
---
That's only missiles. Guns are balanced by tracking, which is negated by range, since npcs will burn straight at you, negating the need to actually track.
---
&gt; and how much?
---
Nope.
---
You go get a good idea for what it's worth, and you tell him the price here.
---
If he doesn't like it, someone else will :)
---
Estamel's invulns ? How much do these sell for ?
---
GSF isnt blue and its a simple JB to G-M4GK (Border to Period Basis), soo 2 jumps from D-P.
---
Provi isnt blue, so 8 jumps from U-Q.
---
Frat &amp; Co isnt blue either, so 8 jumps thtough Curse from U-Q.
---
I think the longest journey gate-wise is to Horde space and thats 22 jumps going through Curse and GW.
---
top ten online game wide, plus top ten online for your current region.
---
when?
---
It works great for me tbh, i get a notification whenever a corpmate dies!
---
:bless:
---
I was pointing out the use of "we're" considering you are not in TEST afaik.
---
Don't worry he has backup titans x3 x3
---
Those are cap transfers. It’s meant to go in a pair and run wormhole c5 sites 
---
Looks like cap transfers, could be wrong. Tinker snake is the most popular build in wormhole space.
---
Here is were you get it all wrong. Just because 90% of the world population is risk-aversive, which really translates to how Eve is generally played, doesn't mean these players don't have a voice. 
---
Same goes for the level of engagement. A CSM representing hardcore players only while the far majority of the playerbase is playing the game casually, is just a terrible idea. 
---
But then again, you will rightfully say so, casual players will never opt for something like a CSM. Which is exactly why this whole idea of a player counsil is a horrible idea to begin with. CSM should never have been a thing in the first place. Even Reddit, which is a hardcore-only place, does a way better job of player representation. This year's complete joke of a CSM only magnifies a problem that has really been there from the start. 
---
I haven't seen one be sold, or show up in the cargo or fitting of a ship since I started playing in 2016 - [with the exception of a single JF kill that has one in its cargo](https://zkillboard.com/kill/68466788/), valued at 15 billion.
---
I've heard varying claims, from 5-10b, all the way up to costing as much as a Komodo itself. I'm inclined to believe they are exceedingly rare, even relative to other officer mods.

Old school Runescape

The Molok that died in X47 was fully replaced with a normal Avatar from what I heard.

Check out 'Buriedbornes' if you like the sound of a roguelite dungeon crawler that's not a shit tier 'idle' game/predatorily monetized. Couple folks in a discord were chatting about it so I scoped it out and now it's my new "Meeting I'm Not Relevant To But Have to Sit On Anyway" go-to game.

Oh also it's like super poorly translated from Japanese. Lol so have fun with that

Genos, zors, missile inplants, loads that could be useful.
---
Is it worth while to sell Citadel components?  Will people actually buy built ones or do people just buy BPCs and construct in 0.0?
---
Let's take a moment to appreciate a few things while we're at it
---
CCP tried to preempt the non-issue of things burning back to gate and jumping on the other side when your tackle is shit, in lowsec where 99% of super losses begin as retarded mechanics producing welfare content for the severely autistic already and whose residents were perfectly capable of adjusting their autismquest bottom feeding tactics to the new requirements without charity and are the absolute furthest from a player group warranting any consideration whatsoever
---
Between this attempt and a couple other braindead iterations to arguably the most basic and important action in the game CCP has actually created the much more significant problem of being able to interrupt what has historically been an instant movement action by pointing on the same tick
---
This problem has not even been fucking acknowledged as relevant in the discussion by CCP but it has furthered the practical reality that successfully executing a contested super fleet movement is a pure dice roll no matter how much planning or prep you put into it because AT EVERY FUCKING CRITICAL POINT YOU CAN BE INTERRUPTED WITHOUT COUNTER, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE SOMEONE INTERRUPTED BY BUMPS EVEN IF NO PLAYER ACTION OCCURS, AND THERE'S A 100% CHANCE THAT ANYONE BEING INTERRUPTED WILL ALSO GET MAGICALLY EJECTED FROM THE SPACE IN WHICH THEY CAN JUMP AT SPEEDS OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE IN THE FUCKING GAME
---
Thank fuck they inbreed enough in Iceland to see the real problems like potentially both of the basement dwelling lowsec hunters maybe missing a charity frag through all the noise of hundreds if not thousands of players inconvenienced in literally every single fucking fleet movement that ever occurs
---
A few, sure. That many? I don't think we've ever seen Frat/Winterco deploy a fleet of supers that large before. The bulk has been kept way in reserve.
---
aaah good old frulegur gatecamps
---
That’s fair. My assumption was just that if they were brave enough to derp those things around without much thought, they were either extremely brave, or they had plenty more on standby. My buddy and I literally saw an Avatar going gate to gate on autopilot the other night. It was honestly amazing. 
---
Eve is a massive time sink, and money sink, you can choose to play differently but the game is geared toward you spending money. Eventually, before you know it, you will have 4-12 accounts and no money left to buy mountain dew and it will dawn on you that you've wasted the last 6 years of your life day and night getting dunked in space and spending real cash to replace your space garbage and dry up your space tears.
---
All in all I give it a 10/10 and reccomend it to everyone I meet.
---
I guess it’s all about what you want to do in eve, who you have to do it with, and how “all out” you wanna go. It has a few features and functions, like providing small preview windows that you can place wherever so you can keep a close eye on clients that are minimized or further away on other screens. The most important one to me is the ability to hotkey specific clients to a keypress. I for example use the keys 1-0 on my number row. I’ve bound them to specific clients and I tend to bind them in order of importance.
---
Main DPS (1), Alt DPS (2), Logi (3), Logi (4), Bump Mach (5), Scout (6), and possibly more depending on what I’m doing.
---
So in my situation I have 2 clients side by side on my 34” ultra wide. I have multiple clients stacked on top of each other and typically I have my DPS characters and bump Mach on the right with my Scout and logis on the left. So all I need to do is issue commands and press hotkeys to quickly go to the next character. I have all my window positions and overviews identical so it’s really easy.
---
I enjoy playing like this because of how self-sufficient I can be. It may not be for everyone though. 
---

---
You can have the clients all on one screen and use a combination of hotkeys, clicking, and using the preview window or you can have them spread of multiple monitors. Just depends on your setup and what you want to achieve.

Why is Mar5y a fucking space celebrity now? 
---
I made a non resource/database intensive suggestion where routes can pull from an individual's or corp's premade list, similar to how corp bookmarks work. The player drags and drops ansiblexes into their route folder, a hypothetical new tab in the People/Places menu.
---
Signature radius only has an effect on turrets when moving.
---
It's stood the test of time, but the complexity of it can leave solo players lost. If you can play with a veteran on voice comms, or be in an alliance, EVE starts getting simpler and more fun. I would say just hop on- the tutorial is ok and you'll only need to start asking questions after about 10 hours. It's also free, so you don't need to worry at all if it's worth it, as you are paying nothing when using an alpha clone.
---
I am not a trillionaire, but I don't have to worry about ISK. The best isk multiplier for me was importing. Download an app called "evernus", google how to use it for importing, and profit. Horde industry is good, but if we, say, ran out of Dragonfly IIs, I could ship in 200 in an evening and sell a good chunk before our industrialists really caught up.
---
Evernus is a good starting point, and it helps you identify what items consistently sell out/sell quickly. You can plug holes in the market and make really good isk and eventually beat people that just rely on the app.
---
However, with the horde market, I found that once I hit the 40b mark I stopped seeing huge returns for some reason. I think other people started importing/our industry started kicking up. But I literally turned 1.5b into 40b in probably 2 months or so? For literally a few clicks a day it is so ez.
---
Planetary interaction was also nice, but it made me dread restarting my extractors or whatever, and eventually super ratting eclipsed it in terms of ISK making for me. I would recommend doing that if you are interested in industry, but not as a pure isk making venture.
---
If you need starting capital, I highly recommend running DEDs. Often you are required to train into a T3C or Hac to run them, which help in subcap fleets as well.
---
Also, start training some alphas for skill farms. I have a feeling CCP is going to fuck with injector farms soon since they are driving up the price of injectors/extractors so much, so best get in while you can. I know a guy in horde who has 200+ accounts, half of which are alphas or some shit purely which will be for skill farming. YOu can train them to 5 mil for free, then buy 500 plex and train the last 500k with cybernetics 5 then just use it as a skill farm char. Super ez isk.
---
Lastly, listen to yourself. I like grinding, making isk, seeing my wallet get fat. If you don't, don't do that. I don't like blanket statements like "don't spend all your time grinding" cause some people like it! 
---
you degenerates can fuck off back to jita

This smooth brain thanks you for a new word: sardonically.

That's not true either though, tracking is affected by sig radius too. But if they don't have any transversal then signature radius has no effect. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turret_mechanics#Math

---
As a rule by thumb:
---
The more casual you play, the better the bigger entities fit you.
---
The more you want to have influence on what you do, the smaller the corps/alliances need to be.
---
Big groups (usually null blocks) are good if you want to fly some time for yourself, get good ISK, get (usually) relaxed fleets and have a lot of people around you to ask stuff. It's not that hard to be in them, and they offer good value for low time effort. You are most likely just a number. People don't care a lot about you. In positive and negative ways. Chose this, if the metagame doesn't interest you very much and you just like the game itself a lot and want generally friendly people to you.
---
If you search for challenge or true friendship in your Eve life, you should aim to join smaller groups, that are not able to save you all the time. They will have more time, expect more from you, but you always have closer ties to the other members, the amount of trust (needed) and friendship is up and you can also expect more from them. They (and you) will invest a lot more effort and time in things that you directly experience. You have more chances to do something relevant for that corp or alliance. The metagame can also be important. You're not just a number. Things you do, matter to the people around you.

Beep boop
---
Gonna be five years playing soon... might actually already be five years in.
---
Still learning stuff about the game and trying new stuff.
---
Honestly it’s gonna be a 10/10 from me.
---
So that's what you do instead of delivering packages lately. Well... could've been worse.
---
Right... I just returned today after not playing for like 5 years... Aside from a passing have at 'ooo, cool, UI color schemes' I immediately went and checked this box before checking anything else out. 
---
The games i would consider to be among the "best" are ones that you can play for 10+ years and still learn something new every day, as well as a community thats driven on player interaction and deep respect for the game itself.
---
Eve online is one such game
---
(i also include ssbm, starcraft, mario64, among others :)

Minnie warzone seems like the place to be for pvp right now, but theres not a lot going on with actual FW mechanics. Some of the stuff proposed would work, some of it wouldn't. However most has been suggested before vOv
---
Is Goons basically the USA of Eve?  Everyone hates them being world police yet everyone also asks them to police the world.
---
Why do people know things?
---
Wait for us, until we grow big enough and move to C4. We are the children with sparkles in the eyes. You will know what I mean when we're there. All will be good eventually.
---
&gt; is it worth it?
---
Yes.
---
No idea, but I am a pyro and can't afford to burn them myself.
---
I've been playing the game since 2004. It's a great game has enough to do for any type of player. Like a poster put above I too are still learning things about the game even after all this time. It does have a steep learning curve, but the game now has a tutorial. So now the game should be easier to pick up. I also give it a 10/10
---
I'm torn. On one hand he does some fun stuff. On the other hand, he's obnoxious as hell.

i hate the activity tracker so much i don't know if that's a bonus or a malus.
---
Yeah we evict them all and will set a new standard, don't worry. We will bring glory. And honor. And fun. And horrible feeding.

Wormholes give the same loot every time and day tripping is amazing isk.

the "is it worth it?" question can be answered by "do you enjoy games with skill ceilings as high as the burj khalifa?" 
---
hey i think we know how they were able to build all them titans...
---
They run a pretty smart camp in Frulegur, a scouts ok and will get you through sometimes but you really want to watch the gate for a bit, as they do use cov ops ships to wait for people using a scout
---
You want to buy 5-10plex(8-16b) to get some start up capital - failing this you can spend the next few months to get comparable isk by wasting your life on vexor ratting or exploring  
---
you then want to either 2-4rattlesnake or nestors farming in c5 whs or you want to do trading. These are the 2 ways i can think of that are semi low investment while making 500m ish isk an hour . both require a fair bit of knowledge, you can youtube/google the wh farming well enough but the trading will require you to experiment with items and learning it yourself for the most part but it also has way more room for growth
---
another way is to buy a bit more plex and get started on carrier ratting and then move up to super ratting, this is less isk/hour but you can grind it all day 
---
once you get a bit deeper in you want to move into either 3+ rorqs and growing the rorq army or you should be going full in with the trading and exploring industry, c6 escalations are good as well but last i checked you kinda need to be "in" with some of the big boys in wh space or you need to be good enough to take your own which you probably won't be
---
i can not stress this enough though, do not waste your time ratting in a vexor/isthar, even carrier ratting is kinda poor isk/hour imo(only decent if you are moving up to super and mostly just to get you some experience with carrier/super ratting) but the whole "afk farm with my vexor for the shittiest isk/hour but it's ok because it's so afk is a huge trap imo, complete waste of time. 
---
If you are aiming for trillions you are gonna be doing some insane grinding, be it through mass rorqs, c6 wh escalations, trading or industry or anything else. your easiest  bet time investment wise in this case is growing up to 100-200b and then waiting for an opportunity which comes in the form of a patch usually, you need to be smart enough to see it though which is very very hard 
---
congratulations, in 11 days you're unironically more experienced than 80% of sov null residents.

that makes me excited. I love the nestor. Do they do more damage?
---
Th3 Corp and alliance ur in is the only 5hing that will keep u in eve. If your Corp isn't doing things that you find interesting you won't play eve long.
---
praise bob o7
---
Yeah null can be a pain, a vni is good afk isk but you still need to pay attention to local and any Intel channel your alliance has. I also recommend using near 2, it reads Intel channels and alerts you when someone gets close. My alliance had an entire section on how to make isk in null so I would think horde would have it. Check the forums
---
I appreciate your deployment. It's been more fun than the goon and tapi deployment. i've been getting in fleets every day and it's been a lot of fun. 
---
&lt;3
---
You can always set your home station to your starting high sec home station. Also, you might do well to use alliance or corp chat, discord or mumble to strike up a talk with other new guys to fly with or a mentor to have fun with.
---
I have played for over seven and half years. This is the longest game I have played ever by a massive margin.. no other game comes close in term of longetivity. The funny thing is, EVE never feels like an ‘old’ game to me. It never get stale because I can constantly change profession. I was PVE Mission runner in high security space; moved on to become explorer and for now, I am doing Low security space PvP (some people in-game may call it as ‘piracy’). You can create your own contents and continue to be entertained through interaction with other players in the environment.. however, if you are the type that prefer to be spoon fed by game developer, may be EVE is not for you. At any case, to try the game is free. Why don’t you jump-in and check it out?
---
&gt;  my home station is stuck in there space for the next goddamn year. 
---
You can always change your home station to whatever location you are in. It's only *remote* changes that are time locked.
---
So if you choose to leave, just find a station with a cloning bay, dock up, and set the home station there.
---
Wormhole space and nullsec systems with a truesec of -1 have the same quality of PI.
---
I would suggest you just check zkill for INIT and INIT Mercenaries and list those as losses. Most accurate without a feeling of narrative.
---
Our job is to play video games, have fun, and shoot obvious blue botters, not spend hundreds of developer hours to do a shitty job at something CCP should be able to handle given the wealth of data they have access to.
---
That being said if you want me to work on this I charge $69/hr pm me for my portfolio etc
---
Thank you! But is there anything that a newbean with only 5bil capital can do to make isk through the market? And also should I put up buy orders? Which skills would I need to train?
---
No
---

---
I hope frulegur never changes 
---
who's a good boi?? you a good boi!
---
phew! Thanks for that!
---
Think facetious. But more dry. 
---
This - that loss should be a hull and some t2 travel junk, you can brick-tank a travel ceptor hard enough that you'll need to run into triple smartbombs or god-mode instalocking to nab your goodies...  
---
... which is what you use your scout to avoid, if the goodies are significant enough in value to you.
---
Yes there should be a bounty hunter skill that lets you track down people with a bounty on them, maybe some implants also.
---
Nestor is much tougher and can also keep armor rattles and VNIs alive for more dps.
---
Gotcha. Love the nestor but don't have a team to fly it with. Alas
---
He died way too fast to even consider doing that. Even in tidi  the video showed him alive for like 20 seconds after being called primary.
---
Lol good on you for being a good sport
---
Komodos theoretically could be nigh impossible to kill if one just fits it like a rich person, so fit it like a rich person
---
I’m not sure what’s happening with ya. Maybe a laser focus on ratting? There are literally dozens of ways to play Eve pve: Explore? Mine? Mission? Trade? Wormhole? Pi?  Weird sex stuff?
---
And you do those for the ability to do other things. I.e. pvp? Plex? Weird sex stuff?
---
Like. If you can’t sustain one pve thing, choose a different one.  Train for three days. Newb toons can make millions in explo. Millions in mining. Millions in pi. I’m a couple months in on one account and can essentially play three different games if I need too.  I can’t do any doctrine stuff. But I Ewar like a boss on one toon. I’m a force multiplier. 
---
My Corp has no skill plan. Just a bunch of things to train to (if you’re brave enough). Come join us. 
---
cunt btw
---
I personally find that Exploration and Solo PvP fit with casual play style. Solo roaming PvP means no one dictate your schedule and where to go. For me, it means freedom to login, play and logout whenever I want. Just make sure you live near areas with lots of ‘contents’. 
---
Shark week plez
---
Look at the sales charts of stuff you’re thinking of making and decide. I suspect components aren’t going to sell very well.
---
they do less damage, require micromanagement of swapping reps as site switches aggro, take Gallente Battleship V to reach the lower-than-rattle-dps (all of a tinker rattles damage is in the role bonus, literally just sit in the hull).
---
With that said, the barrier for entry is lower with regards to skillpoints and isk investment for nestors. Nestors scale much better with multiboxing - after you have 3 rep nestors in site, micromanagement required with each additional account is minimal (assisting + scooping drones). In other words, while nestors start at a higher point of micromanagement, rattles will pass it after roughly 4-6 accounts.
---
If you are in horde then importing can be super lucrative. 
---
You can make isk on the market with any amount but the biggest gains you’ll usually see (also the most risky) are speculative investments into upcoming patches.

I help run the Brave Dojo which is Brave Newbies learning wing.  Our teaching style is kind of how a friend might explain things.  I think you could find somethings on our channel to get you up to speed.

Enjoy what will probably be your forever home in this game :3
---
Waffles numero uno
---
I like you.
---
Oh. I am, though. 
---
Awww so cute! Omg is Waffles the new PH?
---
I dunno - the amount of salt two guys are extracting from a 40k person alliance is pretty entertaining.
---
You can also always change your home to your original spawning school no matter what.
---
You can break 200 million EHP if you have heated Estamels, and an active Caldari Phenomenon. With links you can break 250 million.
---
As long as you aren't cap dry, yeah. A purpled-out Komodo shouldn't die to pretty much anything. Bonus points if you have FAX. Good luck killing it through 95%+ resists across the board. You'll likely rep upwards of 100k dps, *per FAX*.
---
This is very important, having mentors and friends make this game much more fun, and the experience you gain from listening to them 
---
My advice: Don’t aim to be rich unless you’re planning to derive enjoyment solely from being rich. Most super rich people don’t actually spend their money on much and are usually very risk averse - which is why they’re rich.
---
It sounds like you’re making money as a means to fund the game and PvP, in which case you should find something as non-grindy as possible that just covers the minimum.
---
I personally live off loot, I have an alt that I use to loot fields, salvage and loot big fights. The ships needed are very cheap and the payoff can be great and I do it while PvPing on my main. I live in Amarr-Min lowsec which has enough content to keep me going. Bear in mind I pay for my accounts with real money so this is just for ships.
---
Rest of eve does not even know what any of this means 
---
How about if you could earn some type of points (like FW) that you could purchase items with, and the older the bounty is the higher % of points you get from the set bounty for example. I’m sure there’s a workaround for this to avoid exploits and people killing their own characters for the bounty, I mean you should be able to stack the points or be able to redeem them after certain amount of time.
---
As someone who has played for more than a decade the game is one of a kind and is responsible for most of my best MMO memories. That said, CCP leadership and management structure is fucking terrible so expect for obvious problems and grossly incompetent decisions to take months or years to fix.  
---
They also used to have an econ guy but I don't think they do anymore... which is more worrisome than any single problem. Correct me if I am wrong.
---
I think your problems go deeper than any wormhole
---
I love seeing newbros on the subreddit, don't let the salty vets keep you down!
---
PS. if you ever decide to try J-Space remember those d-scan skills, I hear it is spooky with no local
---
Hope to see you in space and maybe provide some complimentary munitions to the hulls of you and your friends in waffles.
---
Pandemic horde was my first real big home. You make a lot of friends there, try to wittle down to 1 or 2, and then just have your friend near by to save you when you get engaged. He'll be happy for the content, then you can keep farming. It's a win win for both of you really.
---
Buy from indy friend at 10-11bn per hull and sell at 15bn+
---
*snap*
---
&gt;then lose another 100 mil isk vni to some prick who just wants to get kills on his zkillboard
---
Wrecking stuff (and provoking this kind of reaction) is the primary reason many of us play this game. If you can't learn to take your losses in stride, EVE will always be a source of frustration for you, even in highsec.
---
That said, you shouldn't be dying that much. Following /u/CMvan46's advice should reduce your losses considerably. Our intel is at times comically bad but plenty of people (god help them) have crabbed up supercap ISK with VNIs in Geminate.
---
Coupla tips:
---
We have structures on all the gates in the region (I think) so if there are neuts about, warp to them instead of directly to the gate.
---
Perhaps consider getting a VNI (or several) delivered directly to your desired krab system. You'll eat the shipping cost but you won't diaf traveling. The industry subforum lists all the services.
---
What? Theres barely any micro management needed with nestors. Hit site, align to ahut, cap transfer and start reps and press f when shit dies.
---
The goat honours my friend with a post.
---
My first real super kill was with Waffles was good times.
---
Tell that to my enforcer, I'm not saying that it is dead, just saying I can't fly it anymore
---
Battle IBIS
---
I’ve been playing for less than a year. Unlike most of the replies. But this game got a hold of me so much faster and deeper than any game has in the past. My free time is consumed with podcasts, and news reports, and planning stuff for my in game activities. I love this game, and there’s a chance you will too. 
---
Lol this sub went from being goon/test bias to being nc/pl bias, you get down voted for stating a fact. I a guarantee you that I will get down voted for stating this fact too. 
---
To build on this , all big alliance have “holes” when it comes to defending their space , but it also take carelessness to get you kill
---
like he said and what i always tell newbies, drones are much easier to replace than the ship itself 
---
If you are not happy with the corp/alliance after trying to interact with them, you are more than welcome to leave, there are many playstyle out there, find the one that makes you happy

&gt;I spend all of my in game time just trying to earn isk
---
&gt;Maybe i belong in high sec for a while
---
&gt;Im not sure what i am doing wrong, or what to do next
---
Just come into wormholes man. Isk is easy as fuck to earn and there's tons of content. 
---
Also worrying about making isk is going to ruin your gameplay experience. You can make so much passive isk by just scanning down to low class holes, running the pirate sites, and then pocketing 1 or 200m. 
---
But to me it seems like you just aren't paying attention. I haven't been ganked ratting in wormholes in months, and we dont have local. Just dock up when a neut enters local and I guarantee you wont get ganked unless you're slow. 
---
Dude what

Lol I find it funny that people don’t get this joke and just downvote brigade

I’m less than a year of playing and less than 20m SP. But my vote is join a wormhole corp and rat in C5 sites. We regularly make 500m-1bill each after a few hours of running sites. More if you have higher skills and your multi-boxing. It easily pays for my pvp ships as long as I rat every couple weeks.
---
it's free to play, just give it a go.
---
The only two systems that are frequently bubbled will be all of OEY and the 6L gate in O-V. No idea why, but that’s how it is. So just avoid those systems. 
---
Also, be in standing fleet, and on standing fleet comms, in addition to watching intel and local. 
---
You do all that and you shouldn’t be dying ever

I enjoy the grind and i honestly just want to earn isk for the fun of it, i just get frustrated and feel like im doing something wrong or im out of my element.

And yea.. i need to be more careful while flying and ratting.

Thanks for the advice. I posted this right after another lost vni so i was frustrated. im sure one day i may be the "prick" camping a gate haha
---
Hmm, u downloaded already? Sorry bro, u r   beyond help ... but welcome!
---
Great advice, thank you. I need to work on learning to avoid it rather than just hoping i get lucky out there and no one finds me.
---
Unless you keep an alt in place while your main mission runner goes back to turn it in; the rocks will stay in space until the last person leaves. 
---
Having an Orca in a site with an alt can be a good help anyway. It can boost and rep, throw out some extra drones to fight, salvage and mine as said, while tanking the NPC damage without much problems. 
---
Come back home you sexy Greek
---
Not quite as weak as your low sec shenanigans.
---
Its spooky WITH  local. Every time I hit a high sec connection my heart drops when my overview looks like a red tree of death!
---
Gonna be honest there are very few games I'd rate 10/10. Minecraft, Titanfall, Halo 3, and Eve. Just be careful though, eve is the type of game that can become a time/money sink, don't let it take over your life if you are someone who that can happen to.

---
I completely understand, but we have to explain J-Space in ways these non-wormhollers will understand otherwise we only have ourselves for content and a population without occasionally genetic refreshing just becomes inbred, ask nullsec how it knows.
---
Yeah I've made that mistake before. Got too cocky/comfortable and lost some ships because I thought nothing would happen. Better safe then sorry is a great term for eve
---
Comrade hello
---
If you were active in Sigs and Squads like many in INIT you would know these things, but several groups are staged in lowsec hitting Geminate and TKE. This has been ongoing. Where have you been?
---
Maybe used to be true, but not anymore. Still decent isk for effort, but the people crashing profitable reaction killed most margins
---
Eve gives what you put into it. If you invest a lot in a game, there is no game that gives you back more than Eve. It can be amazing on so many levels that other games can't even dream about getting close to.
---
But on the other hand, if you just ass around with no effort, the game won't throw you any fun back.
---
It's your decision, but it's ALWAYS a fair trade. You get what you invest. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Ye but you didnt got on the Komodo kill lol

Yeah I've been doing some multiple person sites in a hawk and we basically warm up in lower class ones
---
Sunshine stories like these are what the highsec carebears need to see, so they can get out of their comfort zone and enjoy the "real" game.
---
Hope there's more fun to come in your EVE story! :)
---
Ha! So you have a hall of necrophilia too? That's always fun explaining to new bros. Yes. We keep the corpses of those that dare venture here. 
---
J-space best space!
---
When I joined Pandemic Horde, they told me that Geminate was safe to rat in. I, too, am losing VNIs left and right. I even tried to get into a mining barge but I got destroyed (we had like 20 barges and there were even capital ships protecting us, still destroyed). I haven't been in the alliance long enough or *proven myself* enough to join Horde Vanguard or any of the other higher level groups so I guess we're just stuck in the wasteland.
---
I heard running missions in Venal is a good way to make ISK but now there are enemies there too. Are there any Goon corps recruiting?
---
Smart? 
---
Does that mean I would lose a lot if I never spent any money on the game?
---
Trying to get into station trading. What kind of items are we talking here (such as like sell volume amount, profit per item) were most effective? It sounds great to only uodate orders every few nights, and I have more free time than that so that could be even more often. If you don't mind I'd like to hear your tipsm
---
Yea... i started exploration tonight to change it up and maybe have a positive number of isk earned rather than a negative for the night... but it just so happens on the way back to the station to sell my loot (all the isk i would have made) i got caught in a camp and lost it all.
---
Its rough out here.
---
Yeah honestly some things are satisfying to grind, but some people don't like the grind of course and shouldn't fall into that or it gets boring. Honestly I'm indifferent, isk is isk.
---
man that's cool
---
I do indeed keep a station container full of corpses just for the occasion that someone finally pops the lute piñata that is my station
---
Yeah, sounds like you should be fine, I mean I got war decked once because the war deckers saw me moving an Orca from Osman to Jita.   But not all war deckers are sane :-)
---
I don't know if they are lucky, more like methodical.
---
Coming up on two years with actual non-stop gameplay, and thousands of kills later.
---
If you have the patience to feel like the world is against you for a few months, while you skill up and get into some of the ships you'd like to fly and learn the basics of the game - go for it. This is not a game to play solo, so find a group that aligns with your interests and have fun.
---
What makes EVE unique is that losses are acceptable. You will lose ships, and it'll be OK. There's no such thing as win every time. No fight is the same, due to ship fitting, pilot error and ingame skills.
---
Listen and learn from other people, read up pages like EVE University which has a lot of valuable information. Get out of highsec and a whole new world opens up to you.
---
If you take the red pill, good luck!
---
do this today,   
---
grab a scanning ship. start scanning in and look when you find relic sites start hacking. and you dont have to stick to empty systems to do this. go out of your comfort zone. the scanning ships cost you less than &lt; 4 mill. and one good site and u will be returning with 100s of mills. 
---
i have been playing this game for almost 2 years now. and the best ting i do is apart from WH ratting is scanning for relic sites. i thrive in horde space and im not even in horde. constantly getting hunted down and runing around frustrating the hunters is a hella fun thing to do as well. and you are not limited to horde space either. you can venture in to any ware in the game. NPC null sec is very fruitful.   
---
C5/6. I too can run max tank nestors with only 1 DDA... But at that point a rattle does 30-40% more dps. If you want to even approach comparable clear speed you need 3 DDA, in which case you do do micromanage reps.
---
CALM DOWN SATAN
---
Does is though? 
---
It’s not pay to win. It’s just nicer to pay real money than to grind.
---
You wouldn’t lose more ships, you’d be more careful with them.
---
As someone with a history of rejoining eve, joining a null corp and then quitting of boredom 3 days later... This is exactly the sort of corp I need to be joining. Great post 
---
wheres my 50b
---
I'd say CCP has done a pretty good job of executing it in the past few years
---
Damn shame weekends are shit for me eve wise, missed out on a lot of that!
---
Here's the thing, if you spend $35 each month on Eve, you'd get an Omega account ($15 per month) and 2.5 billion isk per month to spend on any ships you'd want to fly.
---
For a new player, 2.5 billion will buy A LOT of ships. So realistically you'd drop an additional $20 as a cash injection every 3 months lets say.
---
Alternatively, you can grind for isk at a realistic rate of 50 million isk per hour.
---
So there's an old saying that the best isk/hr activity in Eve is working an hour overtime.
---
Where have I been?  
---
In my own alliance's fleets.  
---
Why am I not in Goonswarm's sigs and squads?  
---
Because. I'm. In. My. Own. Alliance's. Fleets.  
---
But thanks, you've pointed out for me why your comment is irrelevant. We're in Tribute, Vale, The Forge.
---
We are literally basing out of The Forge dumbass. You are just proving that you only want to be allies with GSF so that your teeth don't get kicked in. You do not care to work together.
---
Not miserable, just pointing out the obvious.
---
:thinking:
---
It wasn't RMT at the time though.
---
Eve eventually deemed it RMT, but for some reason gave SomerBlink 48 hours to continue operations while they shut down.
---
Blink was sitting on trillions of ISK, so they did insane promotions like - buy 1 bil in gambling credits with us, and get 2 extra billion free.
---
Buying in during the 48 hours cashout wasnt RMT, yet you could still get $4 bils
---
Just delete /trash them or create public contracts for free for everything that’s not worth couple million , depends on the region even hundred millions ..
---
Im playing the game for almost 12 years and I only have 4 Asset tabs 
---
Did what most did pre-rorqual days.  High sec mining, then got into mission running, reprocessed/salvaged everything, then got into null sec life.  Not super rich but I can build everything but titans right now.
---
Epic 
---
3. fix payout, give it killmark rules (no corp members or fleet members) or make the corpse the thing you have to turn in at a HS bounty office for the full payout 
---
i kinda like that, like a purity skin for the caldari ships
---
Did you not see his dank reaper DD?
---
yea cant believe he didnt have shield slaves 
---
damn im suprised how well that thing brawls 
---
I PVE irl so I can PVP in spaceships
---
gotta do the travel fit warp stabs + inertia stabs, or just move ur shit with PvP fits when u get dropped on at least it'll be kinda dun
---
Wow spicy 
---
Pandemic Horde is not really newbean corp anymore most of the ship thay ask you to fly are not for new people.    
---
I loved how chill everyone sounded there during the fight, not the hectic FC that I've been flying under before
---
Or we could... you know... deploy. AND keep our friends ;)
---
Just give the final blow 95 percent of the ISK value of the ship/modules.
---
Is there a version of evemon that doesn’t require administrative privileges? If not is there any other evemon alternatives that doesn’t require admin privileges? No phone apps please
---
You should ask for help in our discord or over coms.  Maybe find a ratting buddy so you guys can team up, chat and stay alert.  
---
Maybe do something other than ratting to try and make some isk.  Go on fleets and loot the field after a fight.  Try out the mining fleets people are constantly pinging about.  Get into PI to help diversify your income.  There are lots of ways to support your PVP habit with our spending hours shooting rats.
---
If you want some more help pm me your character name and I'll get in touch with you over discord.
---
Gun damage = signature / radial velocity, if your radial velocity is low it doesn't matter how small your signature is. Large signature means it's more difficult to out-transverse the tracking.
---
Missile damage = signature radius - real velocity, where target signature sets the max damage a missile does and moving fast reduces that further.
---
It's much more complicated but that's a short and easy way to comprehend the difference.
---
Killed a couple VNIs exhibiting this behavior in frat space a few weeks ago. Thought it was odd they just sat there and literally did nothing but didn't think much more of it. No attempt to jam me, sling shot me, or anything to shake the tackle. Just now realized after watching that, that I killed some bots.   
---
Dunno if I should be happy that I killed them cuz fuck the bot menace or sad that I just assumed the poor ratter gave up (eve 2019 plz) when a single retri landed on grid to try and gank him. :thinking:
---
That guy is a troll, ignore him.
---
Good job Norman! A Prime Waffle.
---
The really small drones (can't remember the name) don't have to be killed to progress either. Concentrate on the larger ones.
---
The simple fact is that the Imperium deployed before you guys did.  I'm at a loss to figure out how you think that you guys are alone over there.  It could not be farther from the truth.  But that is just you being pigheaded and not knowing what you are talking about.  Typical of the lower line members.  Have fun getting stomped up there, keep feeding, makes the industrial guys rich lol.
---
Considering you can play for free, I don’t know how it isn’t worth it.
---
Pay us a visit in our recruitment channel and we will see what we can do.
---
We didn't even whore ;(
---
Back to Waffles 1.0
---
Did you deploy supers? Did you even deploy caps? Or are you just a sig, dicking around in Eagles.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I like Liberty and Reavers and all that stuff. I'm in Liberty and I'm in Booshwaffe. But at this point, you're accusing us of trying to steal all the glory, when we've deployed heavy assets, because "we brought our 70 dudes in Eagles first".  
---
Idk man weird flex.
---
Somehow, I kinda admire that dedication. Doing it for a few hours is pure, unrefined dumb. But to keep it up for 12 years? Now *that's* showing some spirit.
---
c0ne is recruiting!
---
bok bok
---
I'm trying to get some pvp experience in Nullsec at the moment, it's so much to learn. What can and can I not kill in a T1 Standard Frigate?
---
m0ab is recruiting! 
---
hes primary
---
It's probably the best sandbox/MMO ever made in sheer vastness, possibility and content but it took me a couple tries to really get into it.
---
it wasn't even that close..
---
there is a deployment? 
---
Totally join a big corp, learn about the game and make some ISK. And if you don't like it there, go back to a smaller one with more experience (and ISK) on your side.  
---
Also, at least for Karmafleet, I know quite a few people who were interested and slowly worked their way from the "F1 drone" everyone is afraid off becoming, to special positions they wanted to be in. Inside and outside of fleets. This is of course possible in almost every group - it just differs how hard it is.  
---
So TL;DR is: Join a big corp, try it out!  
---
Near2 will help with intel, You should also have the intel channel and local separated from the main stack of channels so they are always visible, Don’t try to rat when the pocket is busy with hostiles, that’s time to get into a cheap frigate or Similar and help with home defenders, (remember that us older players don’t usually bother looting the wrecks, get involved in the pew pew and  make an overview tab for wrecks and loot and whore that stuff - hordes policy is first come first served, just be nice and don’t insist on keeping loot from the wrecks of your own team). 
---
Don’t try to move slow ships like vni’s around via gates during peak times like weekends or such. Always be on comms and ready to speak. Print out the relevant Dothan maps and keep them on your desk so you can follow what people are talking about. Be extremely risk averse when ratting, if someone hostiles is two jumps out, align to a safe structure, and pull your drones in ready to warp home, if local spikes forget the drones, drop a bookmark for them and hope they might be there when you get back, warp straight to the thing you are aligned to.
---
Also speak up in the new beans channel, or comms. There are plenty of us that are there to help you. 
---
You are welcome to message me as well. 
---
Thanks! 
---
Haha well got it from EVE University since I needed just 1 more 'trade hub' ;). 
---
lmao imagine loosing a raven to tristans
---
Thanks, totally forgot to change the contents of that part. Since I don't see it again it still has the default text in it ;).
---
all non barge/frig ore ships are named after sea mammals 
---
How am I trying to take credit? Why WOULD I want to take credit? You guys are getting your asses kicked lol.
---
"We're here too! We were here first! But, you, a \*lowly\* line member wouldn't know about that!"  
---
Not a good look bro.
---
Also, hot take. If a "lowly line member" needs to do research to know you exist and you're in x region during y time frame, you're not doing much and don't deserve much credit.  
---
Do more, and people will take more notice. Nagging at people on reddit is pathetic.
---
Done.
---
I wouldn't agree to that too much. This is so rough of a rule, that it can hardly be applied. What is way more important than the size of a corporation (or the group it is in) is how much you want to invest yourself in that group. If you are active, interested and work together with your corpmates you can take "influence" in every corp, even the big onces. My own corp for example (500+ member) has recently taken in a few "new-ish" people in the internal management section. Of course those are never day-one members, but they showed investment and potential and now they are part of the corp-leadership/management... however you wanna call it.  
---
This is also possible in other corps and/or groups and if it weren't, I would look out for a new corp. Because, if your group is not out to get new/better people to fullfill jobs, it's most likely pretty stagnant.  
---
Aye and you are allowed to. Opinions differ. 
---
more like 3lit3 aar painter
---
Why can't you travel to each of the locations and deal with your own mess I mean stuff? Having a feature like asset safety in Empire NPC stations sounds like a lazy approach in my opinion.
---
please clap
---
People are lazy
---
i didnt even knew there where polarized launchers
---
Asset safety is already in place in highsec, the assets are automatically transported to the nearest "safe station" which is the station they are on...  
---
Srly, what would that good for? So you can clean up your shit? It definately isn't a concern for a database on CCPs side, so don't use that as an excuse for you being lazy :P
---
Thanks for your input! We really appreciate it.
---
* enable also the fitting items to be priced not just hull.  
---
**What do you mean with this? Do you want to see a average pricing of the entire fitting (based on the market)?**
---
* enable cargo aswell. EFT has a habit of omitting items etc so ability to add more into the cargo post eft paste  
---
**We will enable the cargohold in a new release, below the "Charges" we will  add "Cargo"**
---
* bonus. Enable fit variations .. a titan for example has multiple fit configurations based on battle types but for those who are buying fits often will want to buy their entire shopping list as a check list ...although they are individual “fits” they do belong to the one hull.  
---
**This one is more complicated but I do understand that you want to have this. Perhaps we will add it in a future release when we enabled the SSO and you can manage your fittings on our website. Because the EFT format doesn't support variations its currently impossible to add.**
---

I liked the two cyno inhibs either side of the grid, that was super annoying.
---
Was about to drop my dreads on your dreads right as the bubbles went down and most jumped out, decided to reposition and bring my carriers/fax and just a couple of dreads to clean up what was tackled instead.
---
Was well executed by you guys, I could have done some things differently which ill keep in mind for next time ;) 
---
Good fight!

sorry, i do not understand?

..Have you never flown a solo battleship before? This shit happens all the time.
---
you had [The.Ring] wich vni and super botted and quite happely died to assfrigs and other vnis
---
I'd say the main downside is how Eve encourages cruelty among players that serves no purpose other then tear harvesting. People are going to try and ruin your day not because they want your stuff or because they make a profit, but because they want you to be unhappy.
---
That being said, there isn't anything else like EVE out there. Honestly best thing to do is try and get in with a nullsec alliance. Surrounded in a big group, people wont fuck with you just to ruin your day.
---
you had a MJD, as soon as you see baddies in local, allign, spool, jump  
---
unless you get caught on a gate (wich it seems like you did) you get away like that , esp in anom's and event sites it saved my rattlesnake a good few times    
---
also intel channels, those dudes didnt came ouf of nowhere did they? 
---
protip: dont kill the pod, if the bot is terrible it will just try and use the pod to rat 
---
Jeb!
---
He probs got caught on the gate, yeah.
---
Go for it. I have a strange feeling about this game. I altmost never play it but still think about it. You will never have played a game like this one. There is so much to learn and so many people that weill help you. Maybe the best community I have ever met. 
---
Be prepared, to be honest the game can be very boring if you have no idea what you want to do.

Its a forced single engagement and although there is a beit of Rock Paper Scissors to it thats often the same in normal PvP as well

Important note about the dscan part:  remember that cloaked ships and certain "scan immune" ships will not  appear on the directional scanner, so covert ops frigates, stealth  bombers, recons, and Tech 3 strategic cruisers (in some configurations)  will be able to warp to you without being detected. 
---
Other than that, this post is a great advice!
---
Glad to see eve's treating you well, would've bet quite a lot you would've quit eve by now
---
Great !
---
It took a week before anyone noticed you guys even deployed, and that was only because you are feeding so hard lol.
---
You keep trying to act like you guys are this super elite group, and all you have done the past 2 weeks is get your asses kicked. 
---
But hey, good luck being the laughingstock of Eve for the next few weeks until the next group happens along and feeds in the name of "content".
---
Don’t forget to separate out the Intel channel and Local channel into two separate windows. You need to be able to see both at the same time. 
---
i too dont think he had them plugged in. Very awesome to fly fly a ship like that without haveing the 3 bil implant's plugged... what a shame.
---
I would like to know what his skills look like ;) i bet most of the shit is lvl IV aswell!
---
Right? I'd never expect a Venture to be able to break the tank on a Retribution.
---
Really nice, one addition that might be nice: Be able to search for names of fits and not just the shipname. For instance "frig pvp" or "C4 rat"
---
he didnt ripp them off. as stated above it took 20 secs till arirve of the enemy till pod died in tidi ... so no way he did that. 
---
what a fucking

Then you obviously don't know Predditors.

In a T hull you can probably look at interceptors, and maybe random AF you can counter with your fit. Plus all the random T Look at the  haulers / capsules trash. EveIsEasy youtube channel to a feel of how to engage and with what.
---
NP, I thought it would be something like that. 
---
he dont had implants at all is my guess... i mean the titans appear and he's podded like 20 secs later... and even when you instant start doing it... there is just enough time in Tidi to do so... 
---
A Nestor is harder to tank everything with only 4 incoming reps unless you gimp your DPS. 
---
To tank the heaviest of site waves in high class sites you need more than 4 incoming reps which means running with 3 Nestors you need to switch the reps around. 
---
A snake can be fit to tank every single c5 site and requires less SP to do so. It can tank every single site when running in a pair. For c5 ratting the snake is a better choice unless you are ratting down chain. In that case the lack of mass on the Nestor is a nice bonus. 
---
It used to be that you got it all. So a player would just get an alt to kill themselves and farm the money. 
---
thx god the SKINS are fixed. what would we do without functioning, proper SKINS. 
---
There are also other ways to make isk than VNI ratting. Good ways for a new player is exploration or salvaging. A heron is super cheap and you make back the isk fast if you go into WHs. If you live in nullsec you can follow other players around who are running anomalies and salvage those. A destroyer with salvagers is super cheap, too. Both will actually make you more isk than a single VNI. I'd certainly advise you to exploration more as it's less boring and you actually learn stuff about the game.

Listen here for a reasonable and interesting way to fix the bounty system and make bounty-hunting a thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rftmAQdq\_bg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rftmAQdq_bg)  
---
Doesn't have to be exactly that, but the direction is quite interesting.
---
Also to counter, i much prefer eves system.
---
Even before skill injectors, you are limited in time on what you can do. 
---
As a bonus that also means your leveling is not based on how much time you can play.
---
Playing once a week will make me less isk but i can train the same skills as someone whos logging in everyday. 
---
Also, if you can't fly something theres a good chance you probably shouldn't be flying it. 
---
Just chill and relax, theres plenty of things to do with low skills and plenty of roams you can go on. 
---
Most of that 14 day train wont just get you interceptors but will also make the rest of your ships better. 
---
It will also mostly unlock assault frigates, Ewar Frigs etc. 
---
gila bpc's are ~200m ea, soo ~50bil :/

I have not treffes those blueprints in like 2 years and to lazy to check the actual real value on the market right now, but rought estimate is 40mill/worm and 100mill/gila BPC
---
Can I have ur stuff?

Holy shit, I thought huh it’s not that much... Until I realized the amount he had 💀
---
Obviously you do, otherwise you would know where to look at. And it's not the contracts.   
---
We have a forum, use it.  
---
A gila is only 180mil, so you're totally wrong.
---
True that, but you won't have the "more expensive" ship anymore, as you self-destructed it. So the 0 instead of 14b still stands.

Fite me!

1. You can already do this.  
---
2. It's not the job of an alliance leader to find out who is botting and who is not, especially because it's very hard for him to find that evidence needed, because 3. Your idea sounds nice, but is far away from the reality. People that do botting aren't always 23/7 online. Most of those people just let a bot run while they play other games, or watch netflix or whatever - apart from some hardcore RMT people maybe. You can't get any useful information from the online times itself. What if I have a straight habit of playing EVE for exactly 7 hours until my wife comes back from work or whatever...   
---
Such a tool would only cause internal drama and people picking on each other (inside their own alliance) and therefor cause people to not like the game as much as before... in my opinion, this would be way worse than some botters that might be detected through this.  
---
i mean, do you ned to be moving your VNI's? would it be better to have a few VNI's dotted around and move in an empty pod, and not jump gatesin the ships you cant afford to loose until you can

I have searched through my youtube history, sadly to no avail (reeeee baby songs), looking for an old video of an arty naglfar oneshotting a mach and moonwalking away, soundtrack was this one iirc [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXc39hT8t4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXc39hT8t4)
---
If any kind soul were to be luckier than me with their searching, please post the relevant video as it's one of the most satisfying blaps of all time.
---
How about finding another (non-newbie) corp inside your alliance/coalition?  
---
With the exception of Pandemic Horde, all other alliances have different corps that you could possible join and where you have less of a cannon-fodder mentality. Learn as much as possible from the tutorials those corps usually offer and then find yourself a nice corp that fit to your mentality. Usually there are enough that are doing things on their own (small-scale) and/or offer access to SIGs that allow you to do the same.  
---
Sure, if you really don't like the big scale thing, than smaller alliances are not a bad place to look at. But in my experience a lot of the people complaining about being "nobody" in their alliance either haven't found the right corp or aren't invested enough to actually become "someone".  
---
And what about Leshacs? Nice dps, drcent tank, can RR with 3 reps. Is it worth using? 
---
just mail your isk to me and contract your items ;) l will keep them safe for you
---
When they hit
---
having a bit of a keyboard issue there good buddy?
---
https://skillq.net/
---
https://levelv.space/
---
Neither of them are as advanced or robust
---
For what purpose?
---
Been playing since 2011 and this dude has more Titans kills than I do. 😒
---
I have a bad habit of pressing maj on the num pad. And also typing faster than my brain.
---
&gt;**What do you mean with this? Do you want to see a average pricing of the entire fitting (based on the market)?**
---
When you click on a fit, if you can bring in the Jita Sell/Buy per fit item that would give ppl a sense of the total cost. Essentially you're then cross-referencing your fits against an "Evepraisel" style UX. I don't think at that level you'd need to go beyond Jita as most reasonable players would be content with a "Jita" buy/sell as the baseline for likely costings.  
---
This would enable ppl to have a "Total likely cost" and tbh remove a lot of Google Sheet  legwork as well.
---
TBH, don't rule out the idea to pay a "usage fee" via in-game, I'm pretty sure this wouldn't breach EULA (EveMogul etc ) do it... So ppl can transfer 100m into your corp wallet to get unlocked features. It'd be the easiest ISK to pay for a service for me tbh, as the value on a site like this is way long overdue in the community.
---
Let me know if you guys need graphic work done as well, more than happy to contribute to this cause.
---
  
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
I actually joined a smaller Corp of one of the bigger alliances but it still kind of felt the same to be honest.. Actually it’s still a rather large Corp with about a thousand players so that’s that.
---
I found out about Brave, and they seem to be on the medium size of things and they seem to be well respected when it comes to standing their ground no matter what, so I considered joining a smaller Corp with about 200 people within the the brave alliance. 
---
That seems to me a bit more comfortable for me
---
ikr, What are these coward virgins doing on a gates all day instead of in a haven or keepstar ? 
---
Eve is job sim not really a game tbh. 
---
True but them just killing his ships doesn't make them pricks like his post implied.
---
cheers
---
Well, you can have 200 man corps that require you to bring yourself in and you can have 1000 man corps that guide you through everything - it all depends on their culture. Of course it's more likely to have more guidance in a smaller corp, but I wouldn't trust it as much.
---
The best thing is to be honest and ask questions regarding that in the recruiting process. If the corp says "you will figure it out" instead of "we will show you how it's done", this might be an indicator.
---
Most important advice I can give at this point: Got to their comms (not the chat!) and actively talk to people. If you don't talk to anyone, of course nobody will know who you are.
---
I personally can say that corps who had a (soft) obligation to be on comms were the best and most active ones. So don't shy away from that.
---
I have been able to theory fit my Rattler better in every way than I used to use my Tengu. Rattler seems to be better for C3 wormholes, For L4 mission running, Data sites. Only use I can think, im hoping im wrong, is cov ops fit.
---
Seriously interested: What exactly is the premise of EVE to you?   
---
What is your impression of the game so far and what do you expect?  
---
This will also help us to answer you if the game fits to your expectations of course.  
---
I can help you, transfer me your suspicious Isk and I'll give them back once you're in.
---
Nice of them to split the stacks.
---
100% Coeewct!!!!!! (thats how the tutorial reads ) its really impossible to understand, just list all keystrokes amd we could figure it out
---
That's not really true. Usually an organisation profits if the others aren't as happy as yourself. So even if it doesn't look like it, there is almost always a slight strategic profit in most actions.
---
Hi, I know that we deployed to NC's home, I was referring to Horde Parmesans deploying to P3 to join NC and PL and all three of them thus grouping up to fight 1 alliance.
---
I'm not really complaining here, of course they're all going to work together when we're deploying right on top of them and threatening their border systems. This was more to put the strategic numerical/asset situation in context. In this deployment, for the moment at least, Init is outnumbered and outgunned, and that is set to increase as Horde increases its involvement.  
---
But I do have to correct you on one point. Panfam is most certainly not in krab mode, they are fielding impressive fleets with very quick response times, and the region seems to be barren of rorquals and other isk-making ships due to a combination of increased risk and NC's billion isk fine no doubt.
---
yes
---
That will be good
---
A character with almost no KB, lots of isk and transaction toward another SP-less character ? Yeah I would not accept that if I was a recruiter. You shouldn't have cared about changing name.
---
If people shooting freighter have war then ... logis are getting timer from someone involved in the war that they are not ... and get concorded due to this ??? Don't know actually speculating/asking...
---
This should be the new marketing text for EVE.
---
A combination of stealing / Somerblink / Botting with multiple Shield Passive Tengu's running level 5 missions.
---
Yeah it was a very long time ago. 
---
I'll happily admit to Botting as I stopped playing Eve many years ago. 
---
don't biomass, if you get some kind of nasty injury you can come back for a while until you heal up or cunts cocksuckers productions make another stupid shit
---
From what I've read it seems if freighter is npc corp no war then you can rep it.
---
But if freighter is in a war and you rep it you die 
---
Just sell everything, extract skill points and buy plex. Stash everything
---
Then wait the Uncontrollable Urge to come back.
---
Hope your burnout turn into a burn'in or something similar.
---
Oh and of course , Send some isk to  Kyocera Ullmann  if you want !
---
Realistically it's more like 70-80 hours of farming missions. So yeah that is **possible**... But it requires you to literally play 10-12 hours a day grinding burning missions. 
---
Yeah they would definitely accept you with a believable amount of Isk in your wallet. My ingame name is Rancid Meatballs.
---
Can CCP do something about those logistic/link ships sitting in the station structures?       
---
Just look at those nestors in the 4-4 structure.       
---
8-10b each in fitting - if something is going bad they can tank long enough for timers to end and they can dock.          
---
No way to bump them out of undock or each other range due to structure inside model.       
---
Hold the windows key and hit arrow down (or any other arrow key if that doesnt work)

---
Christ how much did you spend on this game.            
---
But seriously if you are suspicious many groups for safety reasons.    
---
Tbh asking this stuff on reddit will not help much, just catch some director online from your previous corp and talk to him ingame.       
---
Horde is deployed to BWF though, not p3e. 
---
Only supers are grouped together, and that would probably have happened INIT deployment or not, its more of a step in the direction of trying to use rorquals more, safer. 
---
There's literally crab fleets with 200+ members for hours each day, that's a lot for NC/PL. 
---
Good shit.
---
I should do some solo pvp or other stuff
---
yea ikr, i should ask to someone else
---
Haha :)
---
&gt;Only supers are grouped together
---
There are a lot of battle reports suggesting otherwise. Not a single battle around Hak I've fought in since deployment, have we fought only NC, or only PL, or only Horde. In fact, in no battle against Panfam that I've seen since Syndicate years ago now, have we fought only NC or only PL when dealing with Panfam. They talk a lot about how imperium alliances rely too much on Goonswarm and will only fight with Goonswarm helping, yet most of the time I've been in Init, we work mostly independent of Goonswarm yet Panfam is always a mixed fleet. Not that there's anything wrong with this, when you're defending your own space, anything goes, but the reddit narrative is a different story. We should try not to obscure the facts here.  
---
As for 200 man crab fleets, can you give some examples? And where they're at? Because I have been flying around Tribute, Vale, Geminate and Kalevala a lot lately, and I see a very small number of very squirrely ratters. Not trying to say this is some major accomplishment, any word of anyone deploying near your space and most ratters with sense will decrease their time undocked, but again, I'd like to see some proof of massive krabbing happening during this deployment. We can of course wait for the MERs to see what's happening beyond he said she said, but I still want to know where you're getting this from.
---
"I" as in "everyone in my group". Not actually *you*.
---
Eve for Kindle coming soon^(TM)
---
Imagine having cash cows like this and cancelling the AT. Sigh.
---
oh noes someone tells a honest opinion, its a troll!
---
I think you never runned those in 5 accounts that jump in to site and alpha the rat &lt;10s just to warp to next site in the same system. 
---
Bots? Won?      
---
Sad
---
I would say yes, although I'm not sure of the transaction history as a limit, because if no you're probably still fucked.
---
Soooo can I has his stuff?
---
Rip 
---
Final nail in the coffin for Eve? 
---
If everyone is the worst human being, no one is.
---
I wish him all the best for the future - its been a pleasure to work alongside him, party with him and on occasion yell at him.
---
Dude, we love you, we wish you well and we better see you in space
---
Wow this is crazy huge news. WOW
---
I see. I will look that one.
---
What I would like is to see the net income brought by single items since the beginning of time so I can understand better what really gives the most value, because it is hard to keep track of that if you trade a lot of different items over different accounts.
---
I am probably going to write a python program to do what I need, I will update you if / when it is done.
---
apache hadoop
---
He was poached. 
---
Dealing with the Eve community will prepare you for any other community.
---
Is this a troll? If you're running forsaken hubs, you should be able to replace a VNI in an hour or two of ratting, max. You don't rat with a neut in local and don't AFK rat unless you're making enough isk to sustain constant losses. Pay attention to the intel channels.
---
As for bubbles, just don't warp to gates at zero. use pings and learn how to gate crash. Your corpies should be able to help you learn these skills.
---
meteorJS and scikit-learn
---
Oh. Now i know buy Gilas are still so cheap, despite the insane demand.
---
Great farewell note.  Nevertheless, I am sure those tinfoil heads are working extra hard now. The heat generated will be able to pop popcorns... To CCP Guard if you read this, good luck and all the best on your new endeavours.  I look forward to kill you (in game) if you ever pop by lowsec in Verge Vendor
---
poached by whom tho 
---
Really going to miss CCP Guard, was a pleasure to interact with him as a player, at live events and on the CSM. Best ship is always the friendship &lt;3
---
That I can't say. Not my place. And I can't pronounce it ;)
---
Different industry though. that much is public.
---
At this point the coffin consists entirely of nails.
---
Thank you Guard for everything you've done for the community, CSM (we've been lucky to have you!) and me personally over the years. You're an incredibly talented community manager and the whole world is open to you. I wish you nothing but the best mate.
---
Whenever I'm in Iceland next the first round is on me.

Yo is this like April 1st in advance or anything ?
---
You can have a 3 month deployment every weekend in Horde Space, we don't mind.
---
shame to see him go after all these years, he was a OG after all 
---
It will be weird. :(
---
That's no coffin, it's a Naglfar
---
You can't stack BPC's, they were all separate. 
---
It's not about how big is your wallet or what is your ISK/h.
---
It's about how many ISK/week you realy need.
---
Personaly, If I earn 500-1b isk/week it's enouth to pay my pvp losses. 
---
My ressources are PI, Wh exploration, High class gas huffing + reaction and sometime C5 PvE when I have to replace a shiny losse.
---
When I was newer, I flew cheap ships because no skills and I invested all my ISK in injectors (was ~650M isk). Usualy 1/week. I earned my isk with wh exploration and C2-C4 Pve in a shield myrmidon.
---
I don't have a wallet biger than years ago, I just have shinier ship and spend less hours/week to farm
---
so, ISK is not a goal, it's just a mean
---
CCP Guard is leaving some very very small shoes to fill, but the are gold hi top sneakers!!! will miss the crazy fun at events and the input and support he has shown the EVE creative communities, Best of luck my friend, I hope your new co workers can HTFU!
---
Only the biggest of gratitude to this outstanding individual for being a shining guardian of EvE &amp; it's community. I've only started EvE as of very recently, but the weight of his contribution &amp; general input was as noticable as the sun above us. God speed &amp; I wish You to let Your talents &amp; passion to radiate in Your future endeavoirs. 
---
Certainly.
---
But it can be good to push yourself out of your comfort zone. :) So that's what I'm focusing on.
---
Eve is dying. CCP is the new CCCP
---
No. 
---
RIP

Frees room for another monetization consultant.

RIP Permaband then (unless he continues to make some dank music with the rest :D) :( hope him much success at his new job
---
Damn. My favorite CCP employee ;\_;  
---
Goodbye space daddy. You taught me that friendship is the best ship in EVE, and I shant forget that o7
---
how is it a better fight , you only lost a saber (first two links are wonky so i dunno if something is meaningful there, just says undefined) 
---
7o Guard!
---
It's a Phantasm at this point
---
Sorry forgot the \/ s \
---
You know, the old rmt shit
---
Meme aside, I really hope it is.
---
thats not what people mean when they say small scale 
---
Okay, thanks, bye, unfollow
---
Just courier contract it all? Highsec jobs with low volume low reward and marginal collateral are snapped up pretty easily.
---
If you're happy to pay for asset safety I'm not sure why you wouldn't be prepared to just pay another player to assist you.
---
o7 Guard! Much respect for many years of commitment and laughs.
---
Good luck in your future!
---
My first reaction was to adhere to EVE-tradition and scream and curse! But I am in a similar position myself, about to leave long time commitment, so I know that it not all easy. So I will simply say Good luck and thanks for all the fish.
---
Contract me all ur stuff in jita before u go pls
---
you can sell only in game either contracts or trade window or give it away or eject into space and  let someone take your stuff.
---
if you have any covert ops ships - donate to eve scout/signal cartel
---
rorquals - t goonswarm federation
---
carriers to nullsechnaya sholupen
---
jump freighters to black frog 
---
bpo's sell on blueprint or blueprints channel
---
eventually join spectre fleet channel and  make free giveaway?
---
I extracted my ancient characters (they were in Provibloc), injected some new ones with names I liked - all specialists rather than swiss army knives - and applied to Karmafleet.  A LOT of Isk went through my balances due to that.  Anyway in my application I gave the killboards of the previous characters (which were at that point in doomheim).  Apparently the application had a "suspicious" note attached to it but I still got in.
---
But I don't know the specifics in your case.  You should take it up in diplo channel (recruiters are busy so if it comes to that you're already on their wrong side).  Definitely not here in public.
---
I genuinely enjoyed working alongside Guard. He was an integral part of making events run smoothly and will be an asset wherever he goes.

LOL you guys have no clue, all you guys who brag about your tick mark and how much you mine are to lazy to run missions. Saying missions are broken but how is not ratting in a super or VNI where you do nothing but warp in warp out. I rather run agent missions in NPC space than ever sit in a Rorq or carrier ever again wasting my time. 1 week of agent running will always out do anything else in EVE, Go ahead and put more valuable  stuff on the field while I can run 4 accounts with very little risk with bigger award.... We all have that one bad day of running into a lazy NC gate camp because that's what they do besides spinning ships... By the way yes I'm a BUSA member and know him for a long time so it's all will be replaced with no problem. Like I tell most cry babies and hater's Go Fuk yourself and we will catch you on the field. H JestersCap
---
RIP CSM
---
Its just frat because they have a lot of them and i don't need to move much to actually kill them. But you can basically go to any big alliance and will find some.
---
&gt;when i do make it to an empty system, i rat for 20 minutes and then lose another 100 mil isk vni to some prick who just wants to get kills on his zkillboard.
---
You have no entitlement to be left to PVE in peace.
---
Presume **every** ship you undock will die eventually.
---
If you show that you are salty about getting killed people will start to seek you out for regular salt harvesting.
---
If null sec isn't working I'd personally advise giving wormholes a try... as long as you don't mind scanning.
---
Finally, I think you'll be surprised how much ISK you could make if you quit being the hunted and start hunting ratters yourself.
---
Fly dangerous 07
---
o7 CCP Guard. [It was a great pleasure to meet you at EVE NT a few years ago.](https://imgur.com/Klqp8qT) Fly safe on your new journey.
---
PS. I hope this isn't the end of Permaband.

Open this https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg throw a dart at your monitor an do whatever you hit.

A big source of people dropping from the game (through crashing) in big fights is due to the client running out of memory, on the current 32bit client there is a max of 4gb. Generally this means that the game will be much more stable in higher end fights 1000+ people on grid, and also in medium scale fights (500\~) more players will be able to play with effects on for a better viewing experience. 
---
Your client shouldn't shit itself as hard on grids with large amounts of players. Currently it's recommended that you turn off things like in-game sounds etc. during fleet fights which this might help alleviate.  
---
Can't, I'm not in a Rorqual. 
---
When I read different industry I was honestly hoping he was about the announce the start of his professional music career.
---
Sounds awesome! Or course I’ve never been in a fight with more than 2 NPCs and I have no friends so....
---
Moving that much and not using a yacht...
---
Laziness gets to us all at some point I guess
---
does that mean i finally have a reason to get more than 16gb of ram
---
RIP indeed
---
Well, this is perhaps the most easiest Bot you can see. Some send their drones on you and still align out/warp as soon as they can.
---
What happened to the Chinese server?
---
yeh as i saw the pods were empty i should just have left them. 
---
Obligatory post removed and read the wiki in the sidebar
---
If he is in your fleet you can warp to him directly but otherwise combat probes are your only chance.
---
We do not give reasons for why your application was rejected. 
---
You can't directly warp to ships that aren't in your fleet. Use combat probes. Or is he moving towards something? Then warp there, drop a bookmark (Ctrl+b) when you warp back. Might take a few tries, but you'll eventually drop one close enough.
---
combat probe him
---
its just a scale thing, this works also with carriers, supers etc. Needs just more preparement to actually be able to kill it.
---
Give me 10bn and I'll give you a good vouch
---
Kewl.. 
---
Thank you for coming with me.
---
To far-away friends from Narnia or shit o7
---
Wow ... farwell my friend ...
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! ;(
---
Maybe we can make some cool farewell in game for him? At least put big "G" in jita
---
How about some cool permaband skins?
---
I thought that but he was just moving towards empty space
---
Eh, same thing.
---
7o
---
Why are you doing agent missions?
---
Why do you need to buy 200 billion ISK to just keep it in your account, then just do agent missions that pay out 50k?
---
Well. Shit. 
---
Well now you're missing out on even more!
---
o7 Guard, a shining personality in the sea of shitlords that is Eve. No one else could have tolerated us for so long. When you get back in space drop by Provi for some pew some time, we look forward to it.
---
Predds have about 20-30 ppl online in average. If by small-gang you mean sub 10 people groups then yes, that's really small-gang for any null blob. That's, indeed, me-and-a-couple-of-friends levels of small.
---
Thanks for helping &amp; supporting us in our eve meets Athens.
---
What about the fact that CCP has stated that neutral Logi will get CONCORD? 
---
There is already a rule in the game that states knowingly avoiding CONCORD is a straight-up ban.
---
So you are saying that you have an exploit to get around the upcoming changes which allow you to avoid CONCORD. 
---
Ok sweet! Enjoy your last month of EVE!
---
Fly safe CCP Guard. Good luck in your future endeavours.
---
&gt; As hard as it is to make the decision to drop fleet (which I’ve not fully digested by the way), leaving on a high note feels like the way to do it. CCP is in great shape and in great hands! Pearl Abyss is the best thing to happen to CCP, they‘re smart, patient and they have real respect for our work with the EVE community through the years. I‘m confident you‘ll all come to see what I already know from being on the inside through all of this. The Community Team is growing (even factoring in my departure), our marketing teams and dev teams are full of energy with smart new hires all over, exciting plans and heads full of great ideas for the future of EVE.

I forgot to put cloaky t3c baiters on the list of stuff chasing the poor tormentor. I also couldn't use this site's actual "meme generator" so that I could insert the thumbnail images of the ships instead of subtitling in their names because the meme generator didn't let me make some of the subtitles (like "hey boys") for a short enough period of time that it fit the video right... so I had to use the site's subtitling tool instead.
---
But yeah I thought it was funny... haha :)
---
my bad then, i wasn't around when that happened. I'm surprised it wasn't though, it seems to be really obvious RMT to me.
---
Okay, thanks, bye, block
---
OK I made my way to my first sov nullsec system, and wow, the sites are hard. I could not open a single loot box in the first data site I came across ("Research &amp; Development Laboratories"). The very first mistake zaps almost all the coherency and then you can't do anything.

Lol pretty sure even the no lifer would end up in a mental institution

Hello,
---
i am a karmafleet recruitment officer,
---
we like to have our applicants show signs of actually playing the game, it took you nearly 2 weeks to realise your app was rejected which is not a good start
---
i dont know what you hope to achieve by posting this to reddit but i wish you luck in eve
---
Good get an real job noob
---
Good luck for you and your loved ones in all forseeable futures. May your beers forever be crispy.
---
o7 :(
---
I mean both ships see use in PvP as well, and for completely different roles, which is why I was asking. It's entirely possible that rattlesnakes can fit a heavier tank and more damage than a tengu, seeing as they are a battleship (I haven't compared PvE fits personally). Tengus are sometimes used for 10/10 running in nullsec as they can be moved safely unlike the rattlesnake. 
---
What are burner missions?
---
:joy:
---
One little waffleboi &gt; one little titan
---
Honestly theres way more groups out there in eve that would accept you other than goons. Im not like bashing them but its not really the most exciting of content.
---
I guess thats my personal opinion but theres like this optimum balance to make eve fun. Its such high relative safety for eve i couldnt really imagine having much of an experience like that.
---
I have met CCP Guard on a number of occasions at Fanfest. He was truly dedicated to the cause.
---
It’s going to be a completely different atmosphere without him around. He has grown into his role and he made it all his own.
---
Thank you for the wonderful memories. I’ll sorely miss Permaband. 
---
Fly safe!
---
o7 Guard and best of luck to you. You made Eve Vegas 2018 (my first ever Eve event) one hell of a memory I’ll never forget. 
---
So sorry to hear this. I hope it is a good move for you. You will be sorely missed. I hope to buy you a farewell beer at Evsterdam.
---
I'm wealthy enough right now so mht as well tell oe of my secrets
---
Contracts, super easy, simplrequires bit of time and preferrably a character that can fly capitals.
---
So. Open the contract tool, sorty by newest first. Highsec &amp; lowsec yes, nullsec no. Ignore blocked and unreachable.
---
All regions. Then just start cooy pasting contracts to evepraisal and get the profitable ones. You *really* want regional alts to get contracts asap since other people have them too. Use alphas if nothing else
---
Example of a usual "Good" contract.
---
Thanatos, comes with a random t1/deadspace/faction fit. Contract price 1.3 Bil. Evepraisal (without hull) 800 mil. Never rely on cap prices on evepraisal. So next is buying/profit
---
You buy the contract on a regional alt or better yet, convoing the guy and bartering it down, you offer 1 Bil (Hey some people actually accept that) but you manage to get him to meet you halfway at 1.15 Bil.
---
So, you have your carrier. Now you move it to a non-kickout station next to a highsec (not highsec island). You strip fit the ship completely, keep the rigs. Bonus points for trimarks or hyperspatials. You put in 30-60k fuel so the new owner can jump with it and say the market has some competition, so you list it at 1.65 Bil.
---
It sells in two weeks. So, the profit. Hull = 1.65 bil + 800 mil from fit. Fuel and contract &amp; fit sales taxes would be say 100. So in the end you pay 1.25 bil but get 2.45 bil.
---
Thats basically double your investment. I've sold random rigged thannies with fuel high as 1.89, altough local region had no competition.
---
Another, more generic would be random t1/2 ships and modules at say faction warfare or highsec. Contract price is 320 mil. Evepraisal is 450 sell, 400 buy. Easier and faster but smaller profit. Up to you how much ypu want to work with this.
---
Few pointers
---
* Always ask if the guy has more for sale, you can get one, or a dozen cheap contracts this way
---
* Bartering. Lost art in EVE but be polite and you can say "I'm just a bit short" or "Tell you what, I'll buy all of your 3 caps so how about a nice bulk discount of [Price here]" Etc. Feel free to ask anything if you want.
---
you seem upset...
---
I wish Guard the best success in his next adventure, no doubt he will flourish and he seems excited about the challenge.
---
After you’ve dealt with the EVE user base, anything else will feel like feeding toddlers in day care.
---
“Oh, -these- are your harsh reactions *smile*, I think I’ll be able to handle it, I have some... ah... relevant experience."
---
Pavel my freind when are you feeding your next super?
---
F
---
gf guys and for keeping it classy 
---
I know people like to use "the end of an era" a bunch but like seriously. End of an era here 
---
:(
---
I think it is time to certainly consider panicking. 
---
This is actually a good idea. We will add the feature so you can see what the fitting will cost (average price) if you wan to buy it.
---
For now we don't intend to ask a usage fee as we think that our services should be free of use. But you guys are always welcome to support us with donations if you like the website. So if you wanna donate the corp name is "Rivals of Promises \[RIPRC\]" ;)
---
Never saw a penis i didnt like.
---
This is a good idea, we will add the functionality so you can search through the names of fits and we will also add tags.
---
Fly safe Guard &lt;3
---
I'm not saying they are not forming for the same fights, but they are in very different stagings.
---
I'm sure you understand why i can't give examples of where people crab. there isn't really any reason to stop rorqual mining just because some bombers are deployed at your doorstep, you can't really kill anything under the supercap umbrella as long as everyone does what they are supposed to do. 
---
You have to remember that PANFAM doesn't really have a lot of krabs to begin with
---
At least what i can see krabbing is way up from when NC. were deployed to h-5, but yeah, i guess we have to wait for the MER to see the facts.
---
Another sad day, even if his impact on the actual game is by far not that big like it was for Soundwave, a person being with the project from the start (2002) leaving sheds no good light on the upcoming events.
---
Also the fact that he was the #1 interface between CCP and the community. For PearlAbyss "the community" is the amount of stupid whales they can drive to in-game-realmoney-transactions with subtile and perfid paywall oriented programming.
---
It will probably be a good idea to turn off sound for the largest fights even after the 64-bit update, but we're working on some other changes that should reduce the need for that too.
---
o7 This is a huge loss. Hoping our paths cross again at your new home, wherever that may be. 
---
naw no pain at all. I find it funny that Pavel who gets his stuff pushed in on regular basis wants to chirp up. And if you check Axwell kill board he can make almost every fleet and still kill it doing his own thing on the side. We all have that one bad day but if people want throw salt you better have a better killboard than guy your throwing salt at and better be making more isk than him because otherwise your a hater who is lazy.
---
Might mean that local works again in Jita and spammers and scammers can get back to work.
---
Destroying a titan like that is a meaningfull accomplishment i think. Planning, preparing and cleanly executing an action to overwhelm enemy is no easy task. Fights do not to be equal to be interesting/an accomplishment. 
---
I was in sov null-sec and the local chat was empty. But I found a ship on dscan (an Impairor). What does that mean? A pilot-less ship?
---
Best of luck CCP Guard, damn you will be missed!
---
Fly safe. o7 
---
Is this some kind of old people's thread now?
---
You can bet, nearly all Komodos you see atm are injected toons, and you know dem injection penalties are strong when you reach some SP.
---
Seeing that he was not even able to afford a decent fit or Implants, I doubt he ha the money to dump som 50 Injectors more with just 150k SP turnout on his char.
---
Running is no issue, 250 gila bpc's is around 1000 sites though, that's alot of mission pulling even with 10 plus faction pullers. Doubt even the biggest autists in venal could do that.
---
But pavel is better in any case, he is better at pvp, and at pve too. https://zkillboard.com/character/1794698777/
---
2325 solo pvp kills only on a single toon
---
Is he moving to politics?       
---
honestly predictable considering current status of eve
---
Good luck. My favourite CCP Guard memory is drunkenly carrying him bodily over my shoulder out of a room at EveNT a few years back. Fun times indeed.
---
No you don’t understand. I know that evading CONcORD is a bannable offense. This isn’t evading concord, but rather evading the entire mechanic. 
---
One of the last few good ones, they're dropping like flies :(
---
The Guy is right though. Whenever I roam in geminate I log in my spy and check Intel channels / standing fleet. It sometimes takes 20 jumps before I am reported. Usually it's a ratter that I just killed. 
---
Fuck em both. Join Horde. No questions asked. 
---
Not surprised
---
Still sad though. o7 fly safe.

&gt;cant fly a vni

Yes this is perfect, let me know what system this is going to be so I know what gate to camp.
---
Im guessing when you were in Karmafleet you gave them all your alts including the one you applied a second time with.
---
Probably when they kicked you they flagged all your alts so they know its you if you reapply.
---
nope, above 95% resists on EM/Therm with heated estamels, with Links, Caldari Phenomena Generator, a decent set of implants around 250 Million EHP. 
---
I hope you can calculate yourself how many DD with 3 Mio Damage at level 5 and BEFORE resists you could tank with that ...

---
For those of us who can't access Gaming sites at work (Except for NFL, NBA, NHL... smfh) can we get a repost of the announcement and message in here?
---
But the rule coming in to play next month is: Neutral Logi get Concord. So, yeah, now you can avoid it. But once the new rule passes all Logi must be in the war to participate without CONCORD. I fully expect anyone who dodges this mechanic, regardless of how they do it, will just get the ban hammer. CCP is crystal clear in their intent and, as with their battle with CONCORD dodgers, they will just say, "we don't care about how your dodge the rules, if you dodge the rules we will just ban you." 
---
The best thing to do is to look at each death as an opportunity. Figure out how you died, why you died, and what you can do to prevent it next time, or increase your odds of surviving.
---
That's sort of the flow of Eve, or any competitive game really. Dont be disappointed in death, learn from it. Adapt, improve, evolve.
---
You can also chat up the people who killed you, give them a gf, ask what you did wrong and if they have any advice. Despite EVE's relentless reputation, if you come at someone with respect and a genuine desire to improve, you've got a 90% chance of them helpling you out.
---
Guard is the radiant spirit animal of CCP. It feels like the game and community won't be the same without him. o7 x 31

Waffles. is the good shit.

I have a doctor appointment at the VA hospital tomorrow, so I will miss this. Looking forward to reading all abhout it later in the day. Have fun!

Ah crap.  Just switched over to Ubuntu and set up a 32bit install/prefix.  Suppose I could give this a whirl.

Toni delancor is faggot. Dont worry about him and his karmafleet. I had many 1-2 moths old spies in karmafleet with crystal kb and wallet, but at the same time they rejected my main, because i have a lot transactions between me and my pl-friends, meh

You cannot even fathom how much this means. I appreciate and love every single one of you. And maybe one day we will deliver torps to someone yet again.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

You brought us the best ship. Fly safe and clear skies o7
---
When Guard first told us he was leaving we thought it was a prank. He was the face of the company, we figured he’d end up being CEO someday. Hard to put into words the impact he’s had, and it was great getting to know him over the last year. 
---
Game’s not going to be the same without him. o7
---
Wait what?! A developer that takes a note of a suggestion without detailed user test-cases, case-studies and ROI?! What is this madness!
---
How would the AT effect Cash Cows?
---
They dont take part in it.
---
They cant bet on it.
---
They cant fly a Cap or Rorq in it.
---
You need some degree of skill (Or be famous enough that even being ongrid is enough to throw the opposition off their game eh Mittens?) And that cant be bought.
---
On CCP's end no one is watching the AT and going "That was a great AT fight. Im so pumped to buy Plex now."
---
Stop trying to force your current Eve complaint of the month into every thread.

Sad to hear. Best wishes for the future, Guard! o7

---
I love this critique, partially because it right on, and partially because its full of shit. I am going to go out on a limb here and say, yep, you are probably right... 99% of eve players have probably never seen a Titan and could give a shit less about this. This was me for the first 13 years I played. 
---
Now where you are wrong is all this nonsense about bot ratting and mining. The vast, vast majority of null sec people sit their buts in chairs and mindlessly grind ore and/or anomalies.  You might say this is just as bad, but... contrary to the tinfoil hattery, we do not make (or most of us do not make) our money from bots. 
---
PS. yes, goons drop capitals on frigates sometimes--so do other alliances. This is called home defense... you fuck around in Delve under the umbrella, shit happens. Your pocket shot at goons is complete bullshit though, because yes, of course... this is what defending your home looks like. To draw an analogy from the real world, when projecting military power, especially if defending against a direct attack, what military do you know that wouldn't use the advantage of asymmetrical force if they had it? 
---
You aren’t listening. This isn’t an exploit. Again, refer to my first post to Steve... it would depend on who you ask, but you ask a merc what the biggest benefit is to neutral logi and they will say the near risk free scouting with the ability to rep when things get hot. The biggest part being the scouting.
---
So take that... and figure out which current game mechanics allow you to benefit from the scouting but also put you in a good position to provide reps when needed. I’m being honest.
---
- This isn’t evading concord
---
- This has been approved by CCP since I first petitioned it back in 2012, and others have petitioned it back even further.
---
I am mentioning all this this because I am making my point... unless CCP declares the mechanic an exploit or makes it impossible this workaround is going to happen. I will use it. It is strong. So my advice is to do things that are reasonable:
---
- Mark previously known or suspected neutral scouts / logi
---
- Use Intel from scouting to plan accordingly.
---
My question has always been in-house or neutral logi... does it really matter when we’re bringing 1-2 logi for every DPS ship? We will typically always play like this because we’ve been conditioned to through guerrilla tactics used against us. 
---
Feels like work tho.
---
He is like RAZER
---
Jita trading for passive income combined with exploration for active income.
---
I mean stupid line members will be stupid regardless of how many titans you have. 
---
So people dropping titans randomly isn't a sign of the alliance having a ton of titans it's a sign of line member wealth or lack of care.
---
o7 Guard
---
Multiple accounts . 1 for a spectic ship, another for industry another specfically for mining. In eve its all about that opporutiny cost. You can have multiple free accounts. 
---
Id go with about four and train each into a spefic part of the game. The same skills for pvp are not the same for mining. And because the skills take real time to train and you can only train one skill at a time you want to minimize your waiting time. 
---
This also will help you find your niche and not waste sp
---
And I'm saying, now hear me out, that if you find a way to use neutral logi in a fight, regardless of the mechanics or how it got there, and the community feels this is against the spirit of the rule "Neutral Logi get CONCORD", the mechanic will change, the losses reimbursed, and/or you will be banned. 
---
You seem pretty cagey about this mechanic you are using, which makes talking with your extremely frustrating. But if you are talking about something which doesn't involve using neutral logi in a fight, or using logi and taking the CONCORD, then I'm sure you can keep doing it. But if people feel this is against the SPIRIT of the rule, I fully expect either the loop-hole fix or bans in lieu of coding time. 
---
I'm not sure how much more simply I can spell it out. CCP has an obvious intent and anything which works around this intent will be deemed an exploit. If you are doing working around the INTENT of the rule, I'm sure you are fine. 
---
yes download more immediately
---
Yes please.
---
Aw man, one of the old guard leaves.
---
Fly safe and o7, CCP Guard!
---
Fun, learning to know amazing people that are not too dumb to take a dump, having more fun, having amazing experiences. I wish everyone in Eve could experience what I do right now for example. I just started my own corp a month ago and it's going so well I didn't even dream of. People are coming without me even recruiting anymore. Or the adrenaline you get when doing your first solo kill. When you claim your first system, when your astrahus is finally online. When 15 year veteran people that have seen and done it all tell you that you that playing with you is the most amazing thing they've ever done. The trust and friendships and the thrill and paranoia if people are out to get you.
---
And again... fun fun fun. And that's what games are about, right? What else do you expect from a game?
---
Eve has sound?

overdue tbh

"..it doesn’t exist anymore, we made sure of that." [CCP Explorer](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/64-bit-client/131325/17)
---
You are assuming things, which is understandable. Of course I’m being cagey.. I am talking about something that brings advantage in an engagement and I don’t want everyone using it.
---
I agree with what you said about breaking rules and all that - This is not it. It’s not a twisting or rules or gaming the system, but rather using existing mechanics to benefit from why neutral logi is powerful. Sorry I can’t elaborate more. 
---
 I somehow am not surprised by this since CCP Falcon is the better liar.
---
o7. Fly safe! 
---
I hope he have documented all his knowledge :)
---
FUCK!

This is unimaginable, Guard is to CCP is what bread is to butter. I cannot conceptually seperate the two. 
---
I'm going to miss you man. See what happens if I keep delaying my visit to fanfest to meet the crew? They all go one by one ;_;. One last hurrah at EVEsterdam.
---
And all I'm saying is whatever you are doing, CCP has a clear direction they want to take CONCORD and if you have a mechanic which is against the SPIRIT of that direction and works around what CCP is trying to do -- which is remove neutral logi without CONCORD from the game -- then CCP will address. Yes, this is an assumption. And you are assuming too, which is understandable.

Forever space friends,

EVE is truly a wonder of the world and anyone who has ever lingered beyond the EVE Gate knows exactly what I mean by that. It‘s not the code or the features or the visual beauty (although all of that is pretty amazing), it‘s the things that happen and the people you meet, who become part of your life, and unpredictably change its course forever.
---
My EVE story is unique like everyone else‘s. EVE unexpectedly became part of my life after I decided to put my classical singing studies on hold and answered a job ad in the local paper in late 2002. Previously I‘d mostly heard about EVE through Icelandic news media where a couple of young guys I‘d later come to know and respect talked some big talk about making the biggest virtual universe ever… out of Iceland. Without a history of launching games. Well, they did, and they needed Gamemasters to fight the early fires and start building a support culture for EVE Online. If I‘d known back then where this unusual customer support job would take me, I would have skipped sleeping to get there faster.
---
I got good at talking to customers. I specialized in dealing with complex cases, bad losses, big disappointments, hard disputes. I enjoyed finding a way to help people or failing that, try to reach mutual understanding. I also got involved in investigating exploits, chasing bots and other forms of space policing (woop woop). I made Senior, I made Lead, and eventually got poached by our Marketing department in 2011 to serve on the EVE Community team, where I got to communicate with a lot more people at once and release my playful side once or twice. For the good of the people of course.
---
Looking over all the projects I’ve led or been involved in, I‘m most proud of the relationships I helped build with enterprising members of the community, the true heroes of this story. I gave a talk at GDC called “Manning the oars, or raising the sail” - about how gaming companies shouldn’t be afraid to trust their communities, moreover how helping them express their creativity and passion is most often the best use of our time. I’ve tried to live by that philosophy in my work with EVE‘s amazing event organizers, both inside and outside the game. I’ve loved working with the streamers of Streamfleet who selflessly entertain and mentor others in a game once said to be (very wrongly so) impossible to stream. Big shout out to all the wonderful writers and artists of EVE whose creations I’ve excitedly highlighted on social media or dragged them into some crazy schemes like getting their spaceship graphics zooming around the biggest nightclub LED system in Las Vegas.
---
From dumbstruck awe at CCP LoxyRider’s ability to put together live streams when starting out as a host, I somehow graduated to both hosting and producing The o7 Show , where we tried to equally represent EVE‘s development progress and player achievements. I also produced and developed our major broadcasts from Fanfest and EVE Vegas which wouldn’t have been the same without talented player hosts and crazy video commercials from corps and alliances. I was trusted with writing and delivering keynote presentations at Fanfest and EVE Vegas… and of course I quickly offloaded half the work to some poor player 225. Restructuring and running the Council of Stellar Management for the past few years has been immensely rewarding. The CSM has taught me a lot personally but I’ve also seen from close up the positive and immediate effects the CSM can have on the development of EVE Online. Then there are happy little accidents, like The Permaband and other offbeat ventures that to me have always shown CCP‘s willingness to be different and foster creativity outside roadmaps and KPIs (Permaband is turning 10 34 this year btw).
---
Whew… I guess I can‘t delay this any longer. After sixteen amazing years at CCP I recently got a new opportunity. After a lot of thinking, I decided to jump on it and will be starting a completely different adventure - in a completely different industry - in a few weeks time.
---
I want to try to convey my thanks. I’ve been embraced by so many of you! Mostly without really understanding why… but you guys are smart and I trust you so I rolled with it and as a result you‘ve given me so many life changing experiences. I’ve travelled the world, met more interesting people than I knew existed, made friends for life from the EVE community and CCP, gotten to work with an army of brilliant people and had the privilege of serving a community that I truly believe is absolutely, 100% unique and unmatched in the history of the multiverse. Seriously. Ask me when I‘m officially off the payroll and I‘ll proudly say it again :heart:
---
I know some of you will wonder why and it‘s important to me you know this is purely a part of my own personal journey through time and space. I’ve worked for only one company for a long time. This was basically my first real job and I was practically not an adult when I started working here. I’ve grown up here, I’ve learned a lot of things and it‘s natural to be curious about how all that would apply in a new context. And there‘s only one way to ever find out! Plus… have you seen a fifty year old rap?
---
My best way to explain it is that I simply got this crazy idea in my head - that I should get up from the place where I‘m happy, appreciated (most of the time heh 150) and safe, to do something completely different where I don‘t know all the answers and can only rely on myself and the skills I’ve picked up along the way. Hashtag YOLO!
---
It‘s also important for me you know that I‘m not leaving CCP because of &lt;whatever it is someone in the community might be unhappy about at this time&gt;. I’ve been through hard times in my career here but now is not one. I’ve worked through those times and tried to be part of improving what needed improving and I will always be proud of that.
---
As hard as it is to make the decision to drop fleet (which I’ve not fully digested by the way), leaving on a high note feels like the way to do it. CCP is in great shape and in great hands! Pearl Abyss is the best thing to happen to CCP, they‘re smart, patient and they have real respect for our work with the EVE community through the years. I‘m confident you‘ll all come to see what I already know from being on the inside through all of this. The Community Team is growing (even factoring in my departure), our marketing teams and dev teams are full of energy with smart new hires all over, exciting plans and heads full of great ideas for the future of EVE.
---
You may or may not have respect for me personally depending on how much you like bad puns and great hair, but if you do, I ask you not to use my personal decision to theory craft or to wield it against my colleagues who, unlike me, will continue to work hard for you to develop and improve EVE. People come and go but EVE is forever, yo.
---
And… like a wise man once said… you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.
---
I will always be part of this crazy, beautiful space family and nothing will ever take that away. I‘ll also be around for a few more weeks in my official capacity, plus if any of you are planning to be at Evesterdam (kicking off the Invasion World Tour 15 23-25 March, buy your tickets before they sell out) I‘ll be there and I look forward to spending my last official EVE event with you as CCP Guard.
---
In a way you could say I‘m being promoted from dev to player! I look forward to seeing what it‘s like to play EVE without being a dev (I know all the shitty tricks, come at me Peligro lol jk dont ban me plz). I also really look forward to rocking up at future Fanfests or wherever the Friendship docks around the world, as one of you guys, having a beer in the middle of the day and watching presentations without knowing what‘s in them!!
---
It‘s hard to say the right words to express all the things I feel so lest I ramble on for another sixteen years, I just want to end this for now by iterating I‘m still here for a bit and will do my best to help you get in touch with the right people if you‘ve ever relied on me as contact for anything. Please reach out.

Press the cog at the right of your char name to do this. Select beta under launcher settings (or wait til it's live to the normal one).
---
Lets build him a statue... a small one but a nice one!
---
Fastest ships go 10k a second. Get one of those
---
Yes. Usually ships like that are in a POS, so you won’t be able to steal/kill them
---
The real question I have, is why ask this on reddit, and not ask your corpmates?
---
I have no experience in PH, but in KarmaFleet corp chat/comms you would have people tripping over each other to help answer these questions and get you sorted on whatever path you choose...
---
Join one of the large new player focused groups like brand newbros in goons, karma fleet in goons, or pandemic horde in panfam. Activity requirements basically don’t exist and you’ll have an opportunity to get help, join those fights, and enjoy the social aspect of the game without having to commit to anything you don’t want to.
---
combat probes, or be in fleet
---
Lol why not horde? My experience with them when I was a young buck in eve was great.
---
Neat. Time to bump up to beta!
---
Lovely fella, always looked like he truly enjoyed what he did and put in 110% effort into it, wish him the best.
---
Hopefully. Would he nice for something good to come from Guard leaving.
---
&gt; because i have a lot transactions between me and my pl-friends ...
---
Apply to PL then.
---
Not in big fleet fights
---
Have to agree.  I’ve felt for years that the CSM should be shuttered.  
---
Good grief this is sad.  Feels as though a large part of the CCP and EVE soul is leaving.  Hello Kitty skins here we come.
---
It’s not entirely meaningless, he could have just said “it’s been great, see you nerds later”
---
Check out Brave. You don’t have to join fleets, be on coms, or interact with anybody unless you want to. 
---
Hey Guard, my sincere best wishes to your future endeavors. Whether or not you touched a single line of EVE code, you were always one of the most important creators of the EVE shared universe and that universe will be less interesting without you. Good luck, fly safe, and let us know how you're doing from time to time. &lt;3 o7

I very sure that my usage of this will simply be "Main", "Alt1", "Alt2" etc. Ill be just as confused when I scroll through them than I am now
---
Most likely the will fix the mechanic, or come out publicly saying it's not allowed rather then starting to randomly ban folks for using a mechanic in the game. 
---
Like Eve as a game doesn't do spirit of the rules, eve has always been rather hard about rules it's either an exploit or not.

Honestly Neutral DST and orca's still exist meaning combat reshipping is still an option, so keeping logi cloaked in a bomber until you need them is still very much possible, there is also the cap booster based solution ( i would not be shocked if we see more wardeccers using brick tank dual/triple ancillary shield booster ships with a neutral DST/Orca following them around ). 
---
What's csm?

Is there a way, app or site outside the game where you can track you profile, training progress, ISK etc?

Like maybe for the Ishtar? :P

How do you guys do it, loose that many vnis? I have lost 1 vni last year, unlucky bubble. Just find a quiet system, keep an eye on local and warp to pos when a neut enters system. Keep your vni in "your" ratting system and travel to the system in a pvp cruiser. If the neut stays in system too long, kill him or chase him away.
---
Props for the commitment to kill that thing, killing rorqs in null is more of a chore than anything nowadays. Nice video as always.
---
As both a diplo and a recruiter, I laugh at bringing it up in a diplo channel. It is not a diplo issue. A diplomat does not have say in the recruitment side a vice versa (except in the case of the 2 KF recruiters who also are in CD).
---
I understand the different hull size being what would indicate better tank and damage but being T3 it used to out damage fits of about the same cost, not including hull cost, when compared to a rattler. I find it hard to see many people using a Tengu for PVP for anything other than a sniper due to the SP loss on death unless that was removed. It is also possible that people just run a different PVP doctrine than I was used to.

i enjoy this post

this one?

This is kind of what I’m looking forward to the most. Like, I understand winning these big fights is what’s most important but for sure it is much less enjoyable when you have to nerf bat one of the prettiest games I play.

Also who doesn’t want to see the meta game of al those leet super and titan skins?

Get dropped on constantly, no questions asked. Hell, it will probably be by a corpmate!

oh nice, has been on my wishlist for a good while.

I'm sure we will see all sorts of cancer. People who love cancer will make more cancer. CCP will then have to decide whether or not to stop it and how much money they can afford to spend trying to stop it.

That's what happens when your lvl5 carrier gets memed by Yasemin and Paq and you need to up your killboard.
---
Why is it a Snuff Hel btw?
---
Damn..... what a huge loss for CCP and the EvE community. Best of luck to your new venture Guard. o7 
---
This in no way involves concord or crimewatch. I’m not here to argue, but more or less to point out to people like Suitonia that neutral logi in the state in which it has existed in the past really isn’t an issue. If you take proper steps to play in the highsec meta then it’s not an issue. Does Nullsec not pose its unique challenges that require people to use differing strategies?

I just don’t know what’s so difficult about using your contact list and bringing some logi busters.

It kinda sounds like you still play the game... exactly  how you want to play it, when you want to play it...and still enjoy what you do in the game.
---
I guess I don't understand why, if you are so disappointed in the game, do you still encourage others to join, play, thrive and enjoy the game that is all but dying.
---
On the other hand, I am actually very glad you still log in, teach new players!!  That is one of the most encouraging things I have read on this Reddit!  Please keep that up!

It's (subjectively) the best BLOPS hunter, has the highest local tank from all the cruisers, and still sees some use as an ECM platform in j-space (last I checked), on top of being an excellent brawler. People just don't like using T3Cs as a solo brawling platform because you have to commit to fights so much and you're risking SP on top of a likely very blingy fit. Also as it turns out, the Tengu can in fact sustain a bigger local tank in some scenarios (specifically, I compared them for DED sites, where the Tengu tanks over 3k DPS kin/therm and the snek falls short of 2k)

No need to downvote.. I did explain where my numbers came from...
---
Okay? If you're trying to justify this issue as being related to number of items you have scattered throughout the universe, that just sounds more like a computer problem you're facing in some way. 
---
For male dancers alone I have 1445 unique stations that they are present in and I have never once faced an issue importing all of my assets into jeveassets. 
---
My asset list in-game however is perpetually fucked, any search I do I have to do two times. The first time just returns me every station but without the items in them and the second actually works as expected. 
---
Given that the CSM has been completely manipulated for years by nullsec blocs to give goon leadership vacations to iceland, it hardly seems actually valuable as a way to improve the game measureably. 
---
I once started a new player corp and attracted the attention of people who really like green killboards. Personally, I don't give a fuck about the killboard -- it's nothing but masturbation. We just moved the Corp to lowsec under the assumption that they (Marmite) wouldn't want to leave all of their tricks behind. And that was the end of the war. 
---
When we did fight them, we use neutral logy, a fucktonne of ECM, and neutral suicide ships. It was the most ridiculous gameplay I've ever been involved with. No accomplishment, just a really lame green killboard. 
---
&gt;nt know what you hope to achieve by posting this to reddit but i wish you luck in eve
---
Yeah, my thought was like... why are you posting this on reddit and not just contacting a Karma recruiter?
---
wales
---
Exactly... and total agree.  The in-game friendships endure and that is one of the incredibly appealing aspects of Eve!
---
Also agree that, generally, only sociopaths have the ability to 'turn those friendships off' after having spent quality time forming those friendships, and that is not what I am suggesting.
---
My whole point is for all those who no longer play Eve to stop spewing venom in Eve Reddit about the game they no longer play or care about.
---
Your zkillboard reading skills lack, the alliance has just some kills with snuff chars in it, and these are all done by well known public npsi groupss. Also there is usually just 1 or 2 snuff chars on the mails, while the group consists of all non-Imperium Alliances, even groups that are red to each other outside this fleets, ike snuff and ncdot f.e.
---
Is that the end of permaband? 
---
Did they make c5 sites more difficult because if not you dont need 3 unless you are shit fitting them or you are cheap armor tanking in mags.
---
so that's what all 6 of you tell yourselves, interesting.
---
im not crying, you are
---
We are all chopping onions on this sad day.
---
Yiu dont use just 1 dda, are you talking armor tanked nestors? Because thats why there is an issue. Armor nestors dont conpare to snakes at all unless maybe in a mag.

You can do your part by not voting for the CSM. Show CCP your pointed indifference by refusing to participate!

Intel and fleet are key!  I live in a dead end system that is easily 6-10 jumps from anywhere hostile are going to come from (besides the occasional wh).  I've had a single close call to my carrier since I got there, and that was from undocking a minute after I logged in.  Now I log in and fleet up at least 20 minutes before I expect to unlock, or if I'm lazy, ill just ask what's up in alliance.  
---
WHs are reported and almost always rolled, get a few Sigils to keep around to help your alliance mates close them up, its a great way to contribute to home defense.
---
If you are getting randomly jumped without warning, find a new home.

I love You PEAK

And both of those seperate from all the other chats.

&gt;When dropping a titan is a valid option to defend a single Battleship, you know there is a problem with balance.
---
I'm not sure by what measure you're saying it was a valid option aside from "there was a titan on grid".  It appears to have not been successful in either killing something, or saving something.  So what's the problem?  That it didn't die?

If guard is leaving, you gotta know something is up :( he has always been my all time favorite. &lt;3 Guard. Anyone know what hes going on to do now? 
---
Incorrect. The fact that a SNUFF member spoke to my friend, Phoenix pilot that was baiting and got mad at him for killing THEIR nyx, thats my proof that this Hel is SNUFF alt. Believe whatever you want at this point pal.  And my zkillboard skills are not bad, I went way back with their alliance kills and you can see many kills of snuff pilots which only confirmed it.
---
pretty neat :)
---
Im not crying ur crying!
---
v0v it's a better narrative for recruitment purpose.
---
Yeah I find that what you describe to be an issue that has always existed. There’s no real point where a “real” fight happens and there’s really no incentive to give anyone a “real” fight. Wars have mostly always been about guerrilla tactics that the average person finds distasteful - I understand that.
---
I think you would be happy with the aggressor requiring a War HQ as now you can reasonably force them to make a decision - Do we defend this and stand a chance to win, or do we call uncle and forfeit our ability to Wardec for 2 weeks for all wars tied to that structure. The tools at your disposal are great. I’m hoping that finally we can get proper fights and that some non-Wardec groups are able to dominate the weaker “mercs”. I hope this because I wish everyone was able distinguish between what actual mercs and capable pilots look like in highsec.
---
Wars have the opportunity to provide really great content that isn’t necessarily a “real” fight too. Some of the best interactions via wars are with small group or solo wars. I have some really unique stories about my experiences with those... I will concede that there are a bunch of shitlers that specifically like fighting literal brand new players, but those guys are to be ignored and not lumped into the same category imo. With the defender now requiring a structure to dec, hopefully we find as time goes on that the ability to target literal brand new players has diminished.  
---
With 5 accounts you can pull in about 1bn an hour with how gila prices are rn. about 1.2bn with 6 (which is the max most people multibox)

I think you should spend all your isk plexing alts for 6 months so that you can have several hundred votes during CSM elections. You can then use those votes to vote Xenuria in the first spot on all accounts. That will really stick it to those goons.

Roaming is becoming more and more of a chore. Cyno domi's, cyno gnosis, VNI's that insta-dock/hide, cyno rorqs, cyno procs. Like, i hate fighting PVE ships, buts its the only way to get fights anymore. I don't want to club seals, but all people do is dock, and you have to poke the seals to get people do anything. Instead of fighting in subs, they just light a cyno and end of content. Unless you wait a few min for the capitals to leave and then go pop they cyno ship thats full t1 buffer fit that they have fully insured and fitted from NPC drops from all the sites they run. They lose nothing, except some ozone to make the jump i guess.
---
I guess winning small gang engagements in EVE 2019 is now "ha, made you use ozone".
---
My interest is waning, we're into March now, a full year from the last "big" balance patch CCP did. If we don't get any word on some kind of change, in the next month or 2, i think its time for a break for me.

In my opinion Eve is not about the fights. Eve is about what you build, the fights are just a means to that end. People who complain about fair fights Eve don't want to play Eve, they want to play DotA spaceships or something. 
---
Fights are fun, fights can be exhilarating, but unless your battles are framed in a larger narrative, they're pointless. That's why I consider killboard corps to be masturbation -- the pointless pursuit of pleasure. 
---
If someone wants to have repeated engagements so they can test their mettle and improve their skills, I'll feed them ships. ISK is free, I couldn't lose ships fast enough to go broke. 
---
If someone wants to grief and "win", I'll find a way to fuck him. EULA be damned.
---
The Gooncil of Stellar Management is BS since long time anyway, it's just alliance leaders or members that want to drive the game towards what's best for their group's interest. 
---
Are you seriously asking if you should play a FREE game?    
---
I'd rather see CCP banning these dudes for exploit than modifying the site. If they don't have the manpower to ban, they won't have it to code a new site.
---
Btw,
---
&gt; He has not responded to any messages in local and he knows he's wrong because I linked the original forum post stating that it's not allowed.
---
That does not imply anything. I too don't read local nor respond to messages. Local channel pilots are shown in my UI, but I keep the overview over the text panel.
---
What is this watery discharge from my eyes?
---
The labyrinth is located in Aphi. The thing that's being abused is the infinite respawn mechanic that this site holds. This means that the site never runs out of enemies (and thus ISK from bounties) to make. This is 24/7 100% AFKable (and in high sec).
---
afk farming cosmos sites is ruled as exploit
---
They live in Syndicate/Placid now.
---
Bounties, in order to be effective, must pose some kind of risk to the person who gets the bounty.
---
The only thing a player can lose that would keep them from having a buddy cash in their bounty would be SP.
---
If there were a tier system for tying SP loss to high bounties, it would deter them from having an alt or mate cash it in.
---
There should also be a scaling system for repetitive bounties, as well as optional penalties (can forego the SP loss but you receive a penalty of some kind or lose docking rights for X amount of time, or something better).
---
The only problem I see is the SP amount would have to scale to the cost / amount of injectors.  If the bounty payout could pay off the price of an injector, still no one would care.
---
Other than that, just burn the bounty system down until something of significant risk can be applied.

Out of the back of my head, there should be some sort of "crosshair" style icon next to your locked targets that you can either drag, or right click.

I realized early on that trade skills had the best potential for isk/effort. I enjoy trying all kinds of activities in EvE and while doing that I always look for good opportunities to make isk with little effort, using trade skills. 
---
Early on I did station trading which can make you some good isk, personally I don't enjoy updating trade orders all the time though so I stopped doing it. 
---
I prefer trade opportunities where I have to do a little work to set it up, and then it just passively generates isk for a long time with zero effort except updating trade orders every 90 days. 
---

Heh. 2 or 3 days ago we had a small fleet of 8 or so t1 cruisers. Got a freaking Nyx into our faces in lowsec.

(Super)Capital proliferation is really becoming stupid.
---
Have you ever run a mission before?
---
To run it is 2 mins, but there is alot more to a mission than just running. Most big farmers have 20 plus alts they need to pull the missions with then fly around and bookmark them to either give to 3rd party runners or their own. Actually running the mission is the fast part but its only part of the process which is far longer.

Help me understand your complaint.  You don't like that someone else is making too much money?  I mean I understand CCPs issue with this, I just don't understand yours...
---
And just for clarity, are you watching this site 23/7?  If you are, why would you think another player could not be running it 23/7.
---
Finally, this letter linked from CCP says they are watching activity for signs of unattended afk site running, which I would assume is taking care of the issue.  The issue being afk farming, not 24/7 spawn sites.
---
I think you are just upset that you can't get in on the action...

So far, I’ve been using Neocom II on iOS (don’t know if it’s on Android), and it’s quite great and complete. You can enter all your alts, follow their account balance, skill progression and even your assets and their value !

There’s an integrated fitting tool (quite bad on mobile tho), a database to search literally anything that is on the market, a tool to see what and where are the current Incursions, etc.

Are you active in a Merc corp now? I might have a job. I'm fresh back in after 3 years off and myself and some mates have a plan which might need a bit of hired muscle or partners. 
---
What pvp SIGs(special interest groups) do they have in Fraternity?
---
A few days ago (or maybe it a week, idk), we roamed a nullsec/lowsec connection. It started as a duo with other corp-mates and they ended up getting chased by 3 geddons, a drek, sabre and some other random stuff. So, i ship into my arty tempest and we pulled a few more guys from the hole and reinforced our 2 guys.  
---
We had a blast in that fight, and it was semi-even with a few tight moments. We won the fight and thanked them for not bringing capitals. Fights like that are getting rarer and rarer. EVE is a game to play to have fun, when it takes hours/days/weeks to find fights that you actually enjoy, then it becomes less of a game and more of a chore and it starts to lose its appeal of sinking time into it.
---
I can't put into words how much it means. 
---
was exactly my thought on that aswell ... But this happens when you open gear with low effort to get to every retard in a game...
---
So what you're saying is we need to remove cynos and rework capital jump mechanics, apart from that everything you said was true in 2005.

We don't need to rework jump mechanics or cynos if capitals stop being the #1 response to every subcap engagement. You can drop 3 carriers on a frigate/cruiser, but if they don't apply well, then it doesn't really matter. That will cause a shift in the meta to where capitals aren't the #1 answer to every single engagement.
---
Capitals in 2005 EVE were a different beast than they are in 2015+ EVE. I remember sentry archons and skynet carriers (granted that was more 2012-2014 EVE), and those could all be ignored in most subcaps, or at least tank them long enough to get away and not get vollied.
---
I do not understand the comment really. What are you implying? That I’m upset because I can’t exploit the system? Or that I address the issue because it’s been going on for a very long time? 
---
No I’m not camping the site non stop, I just happen to live here and notice this guy in the site from downtime to downtime.
---
However, the reason I’m complaining about this is because it’s someone expoliting the game’s mechanics. 
---
"I made a mess and it's interfering with something I want to do so CCP U FIX!"
---
Looks like I don't have to reply. You did it for me :)
---
hmmm.. so a lot like real life governments? Understood.
---
Every time you wrote "Drek" I thought you meant the mighty Drake.
---
Rip this game 
---
Something the old launcher could do was remember the profile an account had set, even if you didn't pin it. 
---
Now, when I log into all my alts I have to go into each one and choose "Low Graphics" profile and the right version to go to each monitor. Anyone know a way to have it remember the profile without pinning?
---
The tracking is so bad and the rate of fire so low that there's very little point in tanking them. Arty nados are best for gate camps, station games, and baiting idiots into burning towards you.
---
They are supremely effective against active tanked ships because you often alpha right through their buffer between rep cycles and if you don't kill them outright you bleed them so deep in armor/structure that they run. I've alpha'd quite a few tengus with deadspace shield boosters :)
---
Not like this
---
So there is no way to manually warp without a destination? You can't just point your ship thattaway and tell it to warp for like,  6au or something?
---
1 of 30 alts
---
eve is the best game that you will hate ever. everyone if they like MMOs should play EVE it is hands down the hardest game you will ever try to figure out. 
---
In another reality:
---
"What?!? The overview loads to default when I make a new profile on an old account?!?
---
CCP logic strikes again, I guess."
---
Most of the Eve players would have offed themselves if they had to put up with this level of criticism.

What does AAR mean?

What /u/EliteExcelGaming posted https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6hclx1/thanks_for_the_ships_ccp_no_more_260m_tick/
---
That tripled my worth at the time which got invested into making a lot of those accounts into skill farms. At my highest point of skill farm running I was plexing 48 accounts.  So that whole ship handout netted me ~220B because I got bored trying to sell them and crashed the pacifier market to ~300M for most of them. Since then I've mainly done skill farming, some skin marketing until I lost a good chunk of it being dumb. Recently hit the 0.5T liquid mark with most farms now lapsing due to the decrease in profitability since I don't do anything else in the game atm.

A few kinda specific industry qurlestions:
---
What's the job time of reactions at reactions 5 and are there any ways to reduce the amount of input materials costs?
---
How much time and materials are saved with a Max researched blueprint? Specifically fuel blocks if that's relevant.
---
Do I need to reset my industry and reaction slots every time the blueprint run time is over or can I set it to just build for an extended period of time?
---
If the latter part of that question is true, do I have access to what's produced at the end of every blueprint run or do I have to wait for the whole job to finish to use what's made?
---
Thanks for any and all help!
---
that's it. I'm calling it. game is ded.
---
People will use the mechanic to there advantage yes, because people like to win. 
---
like if you want honor brawls high sec isn't exactly the right place to get them. 
---
I feel mixed on this topic.
---
On one hand its laughable how a mining platform is able to contend with a small gang of the pound-for-pound strongest ships in the game right now and that its ability to tank subcap for ages is dumb.
---
Yet the other, you roll into horde space looking for easy kills during a stratop and get thrown a curve ball towards you and end up making a video with the purpose of saying how your upset you couldnt farm easy kills all day.
---
wow! obviously we're wrong and you've done excellent homework. Clearly a man of your genius isn't wrong.
---
For the record, that Nyx was immune to your point. It was the bubble's that tackled him. Not trying to spoil the experience for you, just helping you along in your eve pvp education. 
---
Not enough.
---
So people hate the CSM but you don't want CCP to have any player contact? 
---
i have a couple hundred b isk lying around. lets fuck someone over and place a big bounty on him to ''drain'' his sp or deny any docking access for a few weeks... sounds like a great idea... /s
---
You don't have to. That's what friends are for, both good and bad times ;) 
---
Reading is hard, mate.  Completely ignore the suggestion to scale repetitive bounties.
---
Soylent, Inc. would like to know your location
---
So what you’re saying is that rich people could now destroy poor peoples SP for fun?
---
I dont really care who the Hel pilot is, he got dunked anyway and I just shared the video.
---
Commenter #2 to ignore the part about scaling repetitive bounties.
---
LOL 90% of the player base is going to BE SOL after this update. I bet there are lots of crap rigs running this game. 
---
But people food
---
Nope. You can get to a specific point in space if you wan't to find something that's not scannable, like a cargo container by warping between a bunch of bookmarks, https://i.imgur.com/zBjUlkp.png but it's almost never worth the effort.
---
Kinda. Steeve Ronuken is a good guy tho, he's more of an independent industrialists if I'm correct, but outside of him, most CSM guys are either alliance leaders or members and will try to guide the game towards what's best for their spodbrain block.

---
No, you don't need three, but three is optimal for clear times. 
---
Core Stronghold puts out 2,710 DPS. You can tank that with 2 Nestors but to do so you gimp your DPS. You can tank that with snakes without compromising your DPS and also without needed as many SPs. 
---
Nobody is saying you can't run these sites with Nestors, but running with Snakes is better. 
---
Most ships are balanced via rock paper scissors, being good at killing a certain class or size and little else. Titans break this rule (along with caps and scaps) at being good at killing anything. Which is why you see them dropping titans to defend subs because the only counter is more caps. 
---
Dont give your isk to him, give it to me, i will double it as well :D
---
And KWG main 😂
---
Corp mates and lowsec honour culture is the place to go for that. 
---
Oh yes, that's a good one, that's how I won 2 timers solo against a manned Astra in a wormhole, just shoot for 30 seconds, warp 50k to the other side of it, repeat.
---
But not to your detriment in any way.  In fact, you cannot even be sure someone IS exploiting, all you know is they play at least as much as you do, and when they play they prefer to farm this particular site.  If they aren't AFK, they aren't exploiting anything.  You hack their webcam or something?
---
There is a little button next to the target locked icons that looks like a little target. That is the target list anchor, and you can drag it around the screen.
---
How dare you accuse someone as proven trustworthy as Judge of a mistruth! 
---
Can confirm that PH is like Karmafleet in those respects, there's even super newbie friendly ratting fleets, which certainly help with safety in numbers. FC will give out loads of advice too
---
Thanks for explaining!
---
You have 2 problems:
---
\#1: you are expecting the people you are attacking to play the game the way YOU want them to play.
---
\#2: you expect to actually WIN, just because you "roamed" somewhere.
---
Solution: Get together with the other 17 or so people in eve that want "gudfites", pick a system, and go for it.
---
Trying to go to someone else's "home" is going to get you shitstomped into oblivion, as it should be.
---
You will be missed!
---
We rolled into them in the morning... and then pvp throughout the day.  We did not wait for them to go on a stratop; only afterwards someone said (We don't have their intel or comms).  The reason the ships are hugging the hole is due to ramming jags and cynos being a thing.
---
I am not upset by it... I am bored by it.  I am in the most try hard elite nano pvp alliance in the game... code.  We have adapted; we kill rorqs, carriers, supers extremely frequently... its just completely boring meta.  That's not being upset; thats being bored.
---
Ishtar onlines was boring.
---
Svipul online was boring.
---
Capitals online is boring and whats worse allows stupid people to suppress content. 
---
thanks me too
---
&gt;The overview loads to default when I make a new profile on an old account
---
That makes perfect sense though, your overview settings aren't stored on CCP servers so when you make a new profile you wouldn't be able to pull your overview settings from anywhere. 
---
The overview settings are 100% locally stored so it makes no sense to expect a new profile to have previous overview settings since CCP doesn't store any of them. 
---
Yes, I just made the same point twice with different words since you seem like a smooth brain using a hyperbole. 
---
All I am hearing...'IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP'.
---
The only ship name i like in the game is kiki.
---
I call the ship drak... since i am getting old and forget names.
---

---
To add to this are you on the discord, joining fleet and on mumble when you play? I'm in PH, fairly new to the game and haven't had half the troubles you've been encountering.
---
doesnt change the fact that its a dogshit suggestion. lets implement more stuff in order to make players undock less because we already have such good content in eve... 
---
and if you would think a tiny bit further, everyone would just ''cash out'' the bounty/sp with an alt in order to not loose to many sp
---

Anyone know if there will be a linux client for this test?
---
Great aim there, chief.
---
You didn't miss the point of my comment at all.
---
Hey man, good job.
---
&gt; looking for easy kills
---
rarely anyone is looking for easy kills. i dont want carrier kills, i dont want rorq kills, i dont want vni kills. what i want is interesting fights. but these fights get usually shut down in an instant by caps beeing dropped left and right.
---
Sabre is a great option but isn't Alpha friendly. A ferox, hurricane, Augoror, Osprey or Caracal were all good options.
---
It sounds like he is still going to be coming to events and performing with Permaband. 
---
I concur
---
It's probably not very high on CCP's "Give a Shit" list because no matter how many low-level shitty NPC's spawn there, the rest of us are making far more per tick in our ratting carriers and supers and fleets of rorquals.
---
One guy farming this site probably isn't worth the effort to lift a finger on a keyboard considering the drop of water in the ocean this represents.
---
Sure it's a crime, but so are the 100's of bots carrier/vni ratting all over EVE earning 20x per day what this guy is earning, and they haven't figured out a good solution to catch all of *those* guys yet.
---
You can save, or bookmark the location of your ship in space wit Ctrl+b , even while you're warping.
---
Patch specultaion is very profitable, but you need a startup capital.
---
- a good object are PLEX, as they have risen nearly constantly, needs a bit patience
---
- on "Lifeblood" patchnotes it was clear that prices for certain Moonminerals and the resulting reactions and T2 constr. components would rise dramatically. Happened as predicted months before patch, margin between 35 and 100 %.
---
I can’t speak for everyone, but I enjoy being a mercenary. People pay us to do various tasks, and providing that service is cool. I’m glad mechanics are open enough to allow us to run this as a working business model that is self-sustaining. So for me everything from trade hub interdiction, structure defense / removal, and general hunting (not so much at all anymore) is all part of the game for us.
---
Yep I’m in Pirat. Depending on what the needs are I’m sure on of our directors can assist you. You can contact Khromius or Natural Clonekiller in-game and get something setup. 
---
Obvious photoshop, no Gevlon Govlin account description.

No, I got it. 
---
There's always going to be people with unreasonable expectations such that locally stored overview settings for a different profile are carried over to a new profile. Expecting to get the current default settings when you are using a new profile to receive default settings isn't unreasonable, if you think it is I'd love to hear how. 
---
CCPlease, we need an in-game item or monument to honour this man's legacy. He gave so much to this game and became such a big part of the community
---
I did not know you rolled in the morning, I missed that annotation on the vid, my bad.
---
I hate capitals, I dont roam eso in a small group anymore because of all that bullshit, I know who you are and what corp your in. 
---
Im just saying everyone knows which regions are better for skirmishing and getting enjoyable fights, and that being bitter when it dosent go to plan because of some moron pressing jump is pointless.  
---
&gt;Did you test with a new account?
---
I just tested with a new account on a new profile, that screenshot is still accurate for what the current default overview is. 
---
wod and wis? i feel like i missed somethin

Cast your vote so you can realize no one agrees with or gives a shit about your opinion. I love democracy.
---
&gt;This kind of does fix the issues even though it doesn’t address low payout.
---
Aside from making that claim, I'd love for you to explain more in detail how it "kind of does"...The low payout is pretty much the main issue. If I have a bounty of 1 billion on my head but only fly around in shuttles, how would you collect the bounty?!?! What if I live in wh's, then what? The whole thing is unfortunately useless...
---
Titans may very well be out of balance -- my point is, this video sure as shit doesn't demonstrate that.  They dropped a titan, and it was able to do fuck-all to that gang, and was completely ineffective "defending" the battleship.  It wasn't a valid option aside from dickwaving and hoping the gang got intimidated.
---
im a second hand vegetrian, cow eats plant, i eat cow 
---
&gt; one day i may be the "prick" camping a gate
---
jump in a combat ship and ask in standing fleet if anyone is doing a gate camp or a roam. that day could be today. much more fun and if you can loot the field, perhaps even more profitable than your current activities.
---
ask in coms for advice on not losing ships. i wont ask on reddit for your pilot name so i can check out Zkill for your losses but there perhaps be something we can get you doing better.
---
Everyone's been busy w/ balance patches.
---
No BR?
---
Probably sweat
---
It's painful to have Drek as the nickname for a ship, cause drek translated to shit in my language.
---
"CCPLZ, only launcher only goes to 128 accounts.  Can't fit all my Rorqs"
---
I assume you never used a locator agent when you played?
---
Please then do not complain about the rising prices of PLEX and MCT ingame. You are part of the reason for this then.
---
I think you can also set the new targets to show up vertically rather than horizontally. not sure though.
---
I have not, I didnt even know it was a thing.
---
I personally haven't done much solo WH action so I'm not sure if my advice is solid, but the way I did it was pick a nice one that provided a variety of resources and then lived there for a few months at a time, then haul some of the loot back to stations whenever I felt it was safe to do so.
---
I used a Heron for anomalies, a venture for mining and a small/fast "hauler" that would do the risky runs between WH space and stations. At some point I also brought a ship with more cargo space along but I never was able to bring it out since then. Still sitting in space at a good safe spot, half a billion in ISK. Not sure if I'll be ever able to move it without a corp protecting me properly.
---
It's a nomadic life if you're solo and daytripping in and out of WH space.  There are a number of opportunities to do so in C1-C3 holes where you can do it in a T3D (eventually where you can hack, and do C1-C3 sleeper sites sue Rikki's guide) and refit of a mobile depot in a "deep safe" where you leave loot/fittings and just safe log (knowing that those statics should have good K space statics.  Use a decent mapper so you know your path in and out for future reference.  Move up to an Astero, then likely a T3 or Stratios if you're just hacking.
---
I would not recommend "living" in a WH solo (since you'll need a structure to dock in and that takes logistics).  Join a WH corp that aligns to your play stile and what you want to get out of it.  Having said that, you can find a decent C13 wolf rayet, get in a confessor fit for C3 sites and stay there for a few days/weeks (good isk and will be easier to find Kspace).
---
Just my two cents.  
---
was reading the test notes, I guess you get 2m "free" skill points on the test server. While I guess it's nice that you can get a few more skills than your toon can normally have, that actually seems pretty stingy?  Why not give a truckload, so that more things can be tried and tested?
---
Considering skills on the test server routinely go "poof" when the test server is reset, and they have no long term benefit, i'm just a bit surprised a lot more are not provided so people can test new things.
---
Am I crazy, or am I missing a reason that limiting skills on test servers is a valuable thing to do?
---
o7 Guard.
---
I'm sure you won't remember, but we met at FF, and you took some time to hear me out and be a real bro to a complete stranger who just happened to play the game.  Was great to meet you, wish you well.
---
I would probably be a Merc if my mates were into that style of play. I just have no use for organizations like Marmite who come looking for a green killboard on the backs new players. I've been a nullsec and lowsec pirate for years -- nonconsentual pvp, especially where the risks of losing is most extreme, is a big part of how I play.
---
But
---
The game truly lost it's soul with the introduction of "Skill Injectors/Extractors"
---
&gt; I dont really care who the Hel pilot is
---
ah thats why thread title starts with snuff in capital letters, makes sense
---
You won't be the only new dad in PH, KF, Brave, Test or whatever, far from it. 
---
It doesn't really take more of your timer either. Imo it's the other way around rather. At least in PH there are fleets going on almost 24/7, you can join whenever you want in an expendable ship and just log out if your kid needs you. There are no mandatory fleets, no activity requirements or anything.
---
&gt; (Super)Capital proliferation is really becoming stupid 
---
If  proliferation is that rampant, why didn't you have supercaps ready to counter?
---
You brought the wrong ship comp, but somehow it's the "other guy" that is to blame..for what exactly? That you didn't get "dank frags" 8 vs 1 against a ratter in your t-1 cruisers?
---
&gt;On to my question... how does one live in a WH playing solo? I thought you went in, loaded up and get out before getting smashed. Is this correct? Or am I doing it all wrong? Do solo players go in for an extended amount of time before leaving (days and weeks)?
---
As a fledgling member of WH space, I recommend you limit your WH sessions to either:
---
 * Day trips for isk
---
 * Extended safaris
---
A day trip is what you've been doing where you pop in, make some isk, and GTFO before you're podded. Good starting money and there are enough C1-C3 connections to highsec you can generally return home pretty easily.
---
Extended scan safaris are where you put yourself in a probing ship with a covops cloak, then spend a week or so in WHs without going back to k-space. Committing to this will get you used to some of the WH mechanics, such as WH classes, effects, and the _joy_ of scanning chains all night every night.
---
On a safari, use a tool like Siggy, Vippy or Pathfinder to map your wormhole chains. Try to memorize static WH numbers like C247 until you see one and think "ah that goes to a C3", etc. Use the low/null holes you find to make exploration isk, but return to the WH when you're done. If you survive a few safaris you'll have more real world wormhole experience than a lot of newbies, and will be an easy hire for a WH corp (if you want to join one).
---
Good luck; fly safe!
---
Second this,  exploration can net your etaardeda mounts of money if you do it properly, but even as a new player running anomolies you can get super lucky. Heck out of like 30 anoms i ran yesterday i got probably.... 600 mil? From faction drops, including escelation loot from them.
---
It still blows my mind that i used to think selling plex for 400 mil was amazing...but they just keep going up man. I keep expecting it to stop but it isnt really.
---
For big fights just replace it with a endless loop of the Benny Hill jingle.
---
A couple russians iv escalated on in my holes used 1-2, so probably. They are best at grinding down drifters more than anything.
---
"Game Design will also be looking at changing our complex systems so that this is no longer possible in the near future." 2012-08-09
---
LOL
---
Not an engineering/64 bit related question but would you have any information as to when EVE would get some new music? Currently the dynamic system only plays few songs on loop on the random music system does not include all of the EVE soundtracks.
---
Clear skies trilogy is an EVE Classic. Check them all out :)
---
I'll still go, but it'll be for the landscape and hiking rather than the videogames and hyperexpensive beer
---
Could be wrong, but afaik sound eats more of your CPU than RAM. My problem in huge fights right now isn't really my performance, it's me getting disconnected because there are too many objects on grid.
---
Thank you so much for the detailed information!  I got a fit that I am loving right now.  I didn't understand the "battle arena" gate, took it and boom a neutral in system!  Haha, barely made it out alive but I did win against:
---
I have been doing T3/T4 right now without any pressure or stress.  The arena fight was the toughest, but fun! Great point on the overheat module setup, that is good information!

I like your attitude, we are recruiting. Come fight the BLOB, papi.
---
Someone enters local that is not blue?
---
Align to a structure, pull in drones. I usually wait for my drones because I am a cheapskate, and I am comfortably with the game mechanics (when they warp in on you, assuming it's not something cloaked, you still have some time before they get out of warp, hence why you're already aligned to something).
---
Don't rat in staging areas, don't rat in busy pipelines. Find a nice isolated pocket. Use intel. Don't gate in busy systems in slow ships without good intel, move your VNIs and haulers with eyes on the gate, if you don't have an alt or aren't comfortable using bookmarks close to gates, I am sure someone in Horde is willing to help you.
---
Also your overview and general setup is probably shit and/or you are not paying attention to anything, I am perplexed to how you are manage to keep losing VNIs. I've lost one VNI in total over a year playtime, because I was new and forgot to turn off the prop mod in addition to waiting on drones. Nowadays if I am ratting in a VNI I watch netflix with only local visible. CTRL-A local so it's easier to see new people who pop in.
---
lmao this has to be bait 
---
Ah, the COSMOS sites. Back when Darius "Wasabi Sinuses" JOHNSON was working at CCP, he classified players sitting in these sites with auto-aggressing drones as botting, and banned several players. It was not a particularly good day for him.
---
I don't really know what's planned in that area, but if you haven't already tried it, you might try checking "Override dynamic music with EVE classic music" in the Audio settings tab.
---
Well, I'm nearly 6 years in now. 
---
Still have fun playing it. Would recommend.
---
P.S.: For me, the small and fast ships are the most fun. And those, you can fly quite early on. But to fly them good takes time and experience. That's the challenge. Become good at your nieche. And finding your nieche can be a challenge on it's own. There is just so mucht to do and learn.
---
It's certainly not a game for everyone, but if you make it over the leraning cliff, you will have fun times.
---
Getting shitstomped isn't the problem at all. The problem is that you can't currently roam anywhere without getting dropped by carriers/dreads/supers/titans (and a bunch of faxes ofc). They're simply the best option to shred or completely neutralize a roaming gang, they're dirt cheap and really effective on small targets.   
---
So, i get the "don't come to my home or you'll leave without your teeth", it's totally legit but cmon... Clicking on "jump to" and facerolling a keyboard shouldn't be as effective as it is now.
---
Yes, thank you for the correction. That is what I meant with the random music system.
---
Shame though, EVE does have certain great tracks but overriding the dynamic audio system does not put make them availeable sadly.
---
come to out c4 we throw nestor parties! 
---
Rapacity is an ISRAD alt corp.
---
WH are a great part of eve. It’s not easy to live solo in them, especially without some alts, but it is possible. If you plan on continuing exploration then I highly recommend one of 2 options. Do day trips just like you’re currently doing and after you hack some sites drop the loot off back at a HS station and repeat. Second option is join a small Corp. As you’re out exploring you can bookmark/map for Corp and they love good scanners. Also you can keep your loot on their Citadel. They will have members to teach you how to use dscan and other then it’s to help you survive more often. 
---
There IS another way of just using a Cloaky Astero or something similar with a mobile depot and just being a nomad... it’s just hard to store loot and is risky carrying it all.
---
Good luck in jspace, I’m always glad to see more people enter the best place in eve!

Sveinni in a nutshell
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** CaptainKrishna! ^(hug)
---
And when that happens, the conclusion will be that the game is no longer profitable and they will shut down the servers. Because in this fucking world, corporate actually doesn't give a shit if they fucked up their own product. Instead of fixing stuff, it's "off to new frontiers!" now, leaving a trail of shit behind since no one really bothers anyways.
---
Grind and then use your capital for investing
---
Very few corp still uses jamgu in jspace but it's rare sight indeed
---
Either there is proliferation, or there isn't.
---
If you are too chickenshit to undock yours, don't hate on the guy that wasn't.
---
&gt; Sentry archons also did not have infinite range and you could get outside their range
---
Or under their tracking, we managed to kill a ratting carrier back then with around 20 Tarani+some maledictions, going under sentry tracking, or aligning out when he dropped warriors and the one yellowboxed drafted them away before rewarping while maledictions shot them with light missiles. It was a lot of micromanagement and you had to stay really alert. If you fucked up the carriers drones blapped you fast, so it was not seal clubbing.

Thanks for all you've done for us. May you find great loot in your next escalation!
---
&gt; My asset list in-game however is perpetually fucked       
---
same, but i have this for most of my chars even those with minimal assets. 
---

---
You can use a locator agent to find where any particular pilot is in known space.  Its a space sim first but can easily be an rpg.  
---
That pilot who flies 3b rattlesnakes can be tracked down and summarily executed with a well hatched plan.
---
Its what you make of it, really.  Yea, I enjoy it.  
---
its underneath those visible 
---
You’re shit at green texts 
---
You're right ;-). Although there are fleets forming before downtime to get going right after regularly.
---
By ccp guard 
---
A bit late to the discussion, just wanting to share. I think we should make our peace at this point.
---
I've unsubbed in November and I'm not planning on coming back because as you said there is literally nothing that justifies giving them any more money. 
---
They know what the community wants, what the community enjoys - they have the data, they have tons of feedback but they just don't seem to care enough to make the necessary changes.
---
Now with Pearl Abyss, things will go towards maximum cash cow. I'm pretty sure they will milk as long as possible with as little investment as possible. That's just they way that company operates and I doubt CCP will have the freedom they claim to have.
---
CCP fucked themselves over the years plenty, but this time they made a huge mistake imho.  EVE is about to die a really disgraceful death within the next few years.
---
Titans being dropped is a solution, not a problem.
---
 “When we lead whaling fleets into New Eden, we aim to kill as many Rorquals as possible,” said a Bomber’s Bar spokesperson, “There are way too many Rorquals in New Eden.”  
---
Bringing responsible awareness of the plight of the Rorquals in new Eden is a quest close to the heart of every Goon.
---
Well fuck. Guard was the last of the old guard (teehee) that really were the shining example of HTFU. 
---
Who do we even have left now? Falcon? Seriously he was the best. 
---
o7 Guard, you will be missed 
---
I've been avoiding WHs altogether. Made it all the way to Curse recently. Approached a wormhole. Dscan didn't show anyone in front of me yet. I was looking at my map and a player popped in behind me...used tractor beams and locked me down. 4 or 5 volleys and my heron was done.
---
Took me forever to travel there. Now I'm gonna go back to mining. 
---
Bring a mobile depot, make a deep safe when possible by bookmarking a location hopefully off of dscan range of any celestials.  When finding a bunch of sites in 1 J system, offload your loot to the depot after every site.  Also have a mapping tool handy so when you die you can find your way back without much hassle.  
---
It's lonely, alone, so join a corp if you get lonely.
---
gl/hf
---
Bad ccp mechanic that someone can take advantage of. 
---
Yeah I never played Somerblink regularly because the margins were generally bad. You could basically buy tickets to win certain ships. It was like 11/11 tickets each worth 1/10th of the of the ship price.
---
So they were making 10% on everything. They were running for years and had multiple trillions of isk.
---
The ships were delivered to Jita, so you could sell them instantly. You could also guarantee you won by buying up all the tickets for that ship.
---
If I recall, you actually used plex to get the currency for the site, that's why Eve allowed it, because you needed to pay eve for the site currency.
---
At first, the site did an even trade in for whatever the value of plex was, but as they grew wealthy, started offering insane margins and promotions, where you get double the value of plex.
---
When they shut down, they were desperate to unload their isk, so they gave like 5x the value of the plex in credits. After they took their cut, you still were getting plex for around $4.
---
The fact eve allowed it for 48 hours pissed off a lot of people, and the fact that they were unloading isk, only reinforced the fact it was very similar to RMT.
---
If you could get a billion isk for $4, and it was legal for 48 hours. You wouldn't cash out? 
---
CCP were the ones who gave them 48 hours which let them flash dump their remaining isk btw.
---
100% for 50% of players.
---
I live on the US time zone, so I'm not that experienced on downtime hehehe, I just know it exists
---
How to live solo ?
---
Get an orca alt with a cloak 
---
Use it to swap ships (astero/t3/Sabre)
---
And voila !
---
Or as high as Wiz Khalifa.  Totally interchangable metaphor.
---
Maybe he pays by the GB from his isp or even worse can only play in internet cafes.  It's a valid thing in developing countries.
---
source:  Someone in a developing country who has actually met an eve player who only can play in a cafe.
---
The Vigilant looks good. I did a variation of that for a bit as well, only major difference was I went with 1 anciliary rep and used it as the big "o shit" heal, whereas the other one I kept super cap efficient in "always on" mode.
---
On the Gila. With Large booster you won't be able to run it much under full neut spawns in T4s. Beware.
---
Also Thukker batteries provide considerably more cap / resits over Rep fleet, but cost about twice as much.
---
When I give to you about +350 mil, you have to triple it ;)
---
But, what about Permaband?
---
I'm actually curious where he is going. 
---
I'm a third hand vegetarian.  You should see my new patio.
---
Cancer can be financially devastating.
---
1. You don't understand the point that he is making that mechanic changes have made the game worse. This wasn't a major thing until carriers/titans were buffed v sub caps. 
---
2. No where is he asking for the right to win, I am sure if 2 more machs or a small group of carcals came in and actually beat him or forced him off he would not be complaining. 
---
3. His entire point is that he wants to have enjoyable gameplay without having to rely on forming with 17 more dudes. And let me make that clear that's "enjoyable" gameplay not necessarily winning. Every ratter in the game having an instant I win button is not enjoyable gameplay. 
---
All that the current ccp touches dies in a fire.
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
finally the null block lobby will not have any influance anymore.
---
Ahem we do rp. Ask anyone who gets smart bombed by us for the mail we send them.
---
Lol, shouldn't you be disbarring non amarr players who don't know how to get in a dread in press f1 after being cynod in?
---
Yes FW is completely fixed, you can no longer enter gated plexes if you have warp stabs fitted.
---
Great choice for the music. Woodkid really suits the epicness of this stuff.
---
nice vid. nice catchs. 
---
&gt;Either ~~there is proliferation~~ it fits through a wormhole, or ~~there isn't~~ you have to constantly stage, refuel, and move a small hit squad of supers throughout multiple regions of space in order for the chance to kill one super/rorq, under a cap umbrella, where said adversary will, 9/10 times, have a stash of faxes significantly greater than any hypothetical escalation said aggressor could commit to.
---
lmao
---
Nope I already knew in the first day I was rejected.
---
I thought this rejection is just a happening, I thought something is wrong with my character.
---
After that, I tried to apply in one of the corp in TEST
---
I have a lot of advantages when I apply there because, I speak same language and I was 'introduced' by other person.
---
But they rejected as well and they didn't gave me an accurate reason but 'assumed' due to your zkillboard and wallet balance, some recruiters think like you are SPAI. So yes, rejected.
---
I was little bit confused, I'm just a space F1 monkey which only different thing is the wallet balance.
---
Therefore, I don't know the rejection reason except my wallet balance.
---
/r/eve be like
---
REMOVE THE CSM NOW
---
but then they also be like
---
PA IS GONNA REMOVE THE CSM PA INFLUENCE BAD
---
For what I'm looking which would you recommend out of the 3? And why not PH?
---
I hate those nullsec guys, Fixing wardecs is only for the benefit of nullsec groups and no-one else!
---
Every roam should end a tidi slugfest we know.
---
You know how abyssal sites have traces that you can use to potentially gank an abyssal runner? If the CSM wasn't a thing, Abyssal space would have launched without those.
---
You did. A lot [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf) its a bit dated but has a ton of stuff in it which is still valid and persits today.
---
Do belt ratting in a T1 destroyer or Cruiser so you can learn how to watch local and shiz but T1 so if the ship goes poof you are A-OK
---
You got it wrong, you have to use a rorq to get all of our salt
---
i fully agree to the message of this video. you also have my highest respect for the continiued masochistic small corp, high skill, ns static gameplay and even being successfull at it.

Thanks for all the great advice, I will out them to practice.
---
In regards to corps, I agree but it can be tough finding the right one with my casual playstyle. I usually only get online 2-3 days a week for about 1-2 hours per session. From what I have seen well established WH corps are looking for active players 
---
Regardless, I will try the suggestions bout forth. Thanks much.
---
Noice
---
1. I studied months for the biggest exam in my life. I wrote an end-date of the exam in my bio because I don't want to get kicked by inactivity.
---
2. And I was kicked and reapplied. I just thought the manager didn't saw my bio or something. Or there are some rules to have to be kicked for any reason.
---
3. I noticed in first day when I was rejected. I'm just curioused about the same consequences. Rejected by SNOOO and TEST
---
4. Yeah, I just wanted to verify that is wallet balance CAN BE A PROBLEM.
---
#CAN I HAVE YOUR STUFF?
---
I was very bored.
---
Actually, I just wanted to experience what I did when I was more newbie-er
---
Say what you will but people like brisc rubal and suitonia have been a force for good in my opinion. 
---
Don't worry, ships that have a natural bonus to doing that still can.
---
What exactly is ratting? I hear that term everywhere
---
You should probably take the titan sized dildo out of your ears sir.
---
I know it. So I'm asking to public that is this CAN be a reason
---
This is just a two-day old player.  He'll be picking up his first four Rorqs tomorrow.
---
They literally just give players free ospreys or ewar etc. for free. The idea that PH isn't new player/poverty friendly is laughably inaccurate.
---
Guard is easily one of the best known and most iconic ccp staff members, sad to see him go. He'll be missed
---
CSM has very limited benefit to the game.  Idd personally think it was a smart move to remove it and use the money they used to spend for trips to Iceland ect to hire 1 more game developer. 
---
This pretty much completes the circle of the "real" CCP being dead.  RIP EVE.
---
Oh, I think this is not a common type of Jita scam
---
One thing that many won't tell you, is that they made a shit ton of money, a long time ago, and used that to get more.
---
Like when PI went player made. They spent all they could beg borrow or steal, on PI from npcs, at far lower costs. It's taken a long time to work down those stockpiles.
---
And that's only one of the events.
---
I have "dollars" with your face on... 
---
Was that a roam through dekelin? If so i laughed so hard at that idiot when he died.
---
Wait, do you actually think that 90% of Eve players play exclusively on computers running 2-bit OS with 2GB of RAM? What about the earth, do you think it is flat as well?
---
Sounds like you want free kills served up on a silver platter. 
---
If they have more people and can escalate better why should they not win the engagement with you?
---
I'm somewhat confused by them. I think they're trying to induce stockholm syndrome or something.
---
'CAPITAL SHIP'
---
My bad, carry on
---
My last Sub expired during the Guardian Gala event. That was the thing that tipped me over. But what you described is exactly and precisely what has been eating at me for a very long time now and why I left NS in 2016. Currently I'm still logging in once in a while but only as alpha, not seeing anything even worth using plex for a free sub, much less pay for one. We'll see how things progress, if at all, but am not holding my breath for it.
---
o7 So long and thanks for everything!
---
There is no "safe space to rat" in eve.  And there are plenty of people that krab in VNI's in Geminate without dying.  I used to have my alt going all the time and this was with in the first couple of months that we moved into Geminate, when it was content city 24/7.  Grinding up ADM's in pipe systems and left on its own for most of it.  I think I died once during this time.
---
The intel channel is only as good as the people that use it.  If people don't use it, then it will be bad, if it's bad someone might get caught off guard.  It happens.  The people not reporting you are probably either not home or not on coms/discord.
---
games like this always have a huge player base running on potatoes. its kind of the MMO way. I get it man you and me both think that is silly but I am expecting a huge number of players to be really shocked when they cant run the client anymore.  
---
Not everyone makes it off the ships, there is survival percentage by hull size bit on an old lore webpage somewhere
---
"Look acrost the river, Lennie an’ I’ll tell you so you can almost see it." 
---
ur mom
---
This salt is that bew ore that rorquals  cant mine and you need special crystals in an exhumer to mine.
---
Truth hurts, but the fangirls will downvote you to hell
---
yeah, the concern troll with honest opinions...
---
Still needs a gate on Large imo.
---
It doesn't make sense for them to run a test after CCP's offices close for the day, so if you're not a Euro you're not going to be on a mass test.
---
&gt;Sounds like you want free kills served up on a silver platter. 
---
That's what they've always wanted, there's a reason elite dvders dunk on scrubs instead of fighting fellow elite dvders and its not because they're after good fights. 
---
Not really true. Some people really do get their bang for their buck out of supers (For pvp). But those people are extremely active, have a minimum of 5-6 accounts and are fairly rare. Most people I've seen have no business owning a super, other than to use it for ratting.
---
Did you read the post? (nope, you didn't. at least not all of it)
---
I definitely agree and I've sort of come to terms with the fact that maybe EVE just isn't for me anymore  and that's okay! Sad, but we'll have new games and new internet friends and rivals. 
---
I regret buying these Yulai skins, nobodys gunna buy them now!
---
Spodbless CCP
---
The rorqual rework is one of the few resounding successes of recent years.
---
yonis what did u do
---
People talk in local?
---
wormholer btw
---
A fellow Yugoslavian, I see
---
There was a change last year to block stabbed ships from entering the FW Plexes. In 2016 the Citadel Expansion added structures that made staging in hostile systems significantly easier and made the system control mechanics much less relevant, there are a few good and bad things (mostly considered bad by the FW community) that came with that. Nothing direct has been changed since the end of 2012.   
---
There are no planned changes to FW at the moment. 
---
What do you mean they dont live in aridia?
---
:( 
---
nope, that's why you're always complaining in local about horde fucking the LP market.
---
If you enjoy this then I suggest you train into a Nemesis, use Thermal bombs and aim for Excavators. Preferably with a few friends.
---
If you get good at it you can do some fun things with webs and target painters to make sure they die. 
---
&gt; He has not responded to any messages in local
---
Meaningless.
---
shhhhh.
---
&gt;If they have more people and can escalate better why should they not win the engagement with you?
---
Are you actually asking me why the the outcome of any PVP scenario **SHOULD NOT** always been in favor of the side in which (# of pilots) + (ship sizes) is largest?
---
titans cost lots u mongoloid of course they kill idiot subcaps... if you really want to pvp bring a titan or fuck off
---
I WISH  
---
THAT I COULD TURN BACK TIME  
---
With CCP's glacial pace of development(srsly, iceland may as well be in another dimensions timezone) they've done almost nothing for 7 years so we might get an overhaul in another 3-10 years.
---
I wish I wasn't serious.
---
If you scanning you should be cloaked, like jump in the hole bookmark it. 
---
Warp to a planet drop a bookmark in warp, launch probes on land warp to your bookmark and cloak up, this way you can safely scan the wormhole. 
---
Honestly if you lose like 9 out of 10 heron's while doing exploration you will still make a profit ( plus you will learn more game mechanics from exploring then you ever learn from mining ), it means you end up being a better player for having used it as a income source. 
---
Cool imagination,  I want this stuff to, to be in condition like yours)
---
*sad face
---
I go through Frulegur all the time in my fast align Crane. 
---
I think they're terrible because I always see them and they never catch me. I'm sure they catch fish often though.
---
Speaking of the area, does anybody know what the deal is with the Russians stocking the lowsec Konora &amp; Odebeinn NPC stations with hundreds of billions of isk worth of stuff, especially materials?
---
Big F for eve
---
If they change FW mechanics and make it good, i will get DEEPLY involved in it. FW has so much potential however riddled with flaws.
---
You must just be shit at running burners lol, I can send a picture of my activity tracker if you want
---
&gt;Im just saying everyone knows which regions are better for skirmishing and getting enjoyable fights, and that being bitter when it dosent go to plan because of some moron pressing jump is pointless. 
---
you're probably talking to one in the group of the most experienced roaming small gang pvprs currently active, i'm pretty sure he's well aware of the state of the regions and these things happen in spite of that.
---
Not to mention seeing DD volleys going off in high-detail. 
---
We need to know period and amount, no overall stats)
---
time to bring back old fatigue. Only worse.
---
First jump, 3 hour jump reactivation.
---
The one and only face of CCP.. 
---
It sounds to me like you think it should not be like that. I think that's exactly how it should be. 
---
Just dunk it.
---
mcav is recruiting because fuck dreads hail the enyo!!!!
---
It's "on hold until we can deliver a product we're happy with". There was a rather 'back to the drawing board lads' feeling after the public testing at Fanfest (Vegas? I don't remember which).
---
This is inspiring. I've only been taking down other Ventures and Retrievers in my Venture, but now I have goals!
---
Your application was rejected for being a crybaby on reddit.  ASCEE is recruiting as always
---
flair checks out...
---
Reeeeeeeeee i want to club PvE fit VNIs that are either afk and/or too dumb to watch local. And when we catch something we can't pop within 10 seconds, it's so unfair when they bring better ship types and more numbers in their own space, because we're clearly looking for fair fights here when we 1v10 ratting ships :(
---
You don't go to null ratting pockets for good fights. Stop lying and admit that all you want is to farm dumb VNIs (which is still easy as fuck). I'm not saying that hunting krabbers is an invalid, bad or wrong gameplay style. But I am getting tired of this "there's never any content eve is ded :(" lie that you nerds repeat ad infinitum, when in reality it in fact means "people won't rush headlessly into our blinged kitey bullshit that's on a perch outside a gate and feed us easy kills". Fly more engageable ships solo or with fewer people, don't be 100% risk averse and only take fights that are entirely on your terms, and you get plenty of fights, many of them even good and even somewhat fair.
---
There's a reason for the "elit pevepe" meme, because it's true. Stop being a hypocrite and pretend that you want nothing more than to club retarded seals.
---
Interesting. And most of the time you can just warp off if you aren't at the right engagement range. I like it.
---
Sometimes we dunk, sometimes we're dunked on. 
---
Not really - so long as the OS/Hardware is 64-bit, and from CCP's stats, that's 99.5% of the playerbase, there's not much more computing load.   
---
Crap rigs will still need to run in potato-mode, but that's about it. 
---
Praise James!!
---
Haha cool ain't it ;). But no really, we where already thinking about this option so the request you made did convince us its a good option to have in the search.
---
I’m not ignoring it. I never said you could zero out someone’s SP but you can destroy it because it is fun. Unless you are referring to a character only being able to place x number of bounties then you are ignoring all the alts I can make with almost no effort.
---
Spoken like a true krab.
---
Frankly the rorqaul i believe should be able to tank well/ "maybe not to this extent. but it shouldn't be able to then also pose a threat  to the ones attacking it. its meant to be a support capital for mining fleets not a, FAX / Drone carrier / Drone mining / Transport + Extra ore / temp tether capital ship.  CCP needs to pick one off  or 2 off these things  or just make it . meh at all off them
---
I'd rather they just nerf carrier application. HAW dreads are fine imo. I don't care about jump mechanics, the reason people keep pointing out jump mechanics is because capital escalation/application is broken and they are the best counter to 95% of the ships in the game. Once you stop them being better than 95% of the ships in the game, they can jump all they want on every frigate they want, but they won't do anything that is of concern to small ships without subcap support.
---
Jump mechanics are a symptom that is more noticeable due to proliferation, but not the inherent cause of the issue. Fix capital application, and cyno's/instant support become less of an issue. As now that Hel can't insta-blap nearly every subcap on grid.
---
Customer service dude gets better offer from different company. He takes the job.
---
Not sure how this translates to 'Eve is dead'.
---
From a skills standpoint, I would hurry up and train cybernetics to IV and biology to V. Get some +4 standard implants which will help you get skill points faster. And when events come along you can get the cerebral accelerators to increase skill points over time. 
---
How about what BL were doing... Jumping a rorq into a enemy mining fleet.  Then using the clone bay to jump a bunch of dudes to the rorq.  Those toons then reshipped into battle procs, ventures with scrams.. scrammed all the other rorqs on grid; then the rorq enters god mode; allowing all the procs, ventures to be 100% invulnerable and hold tackle on the rorqs for 7 minutes.
---
100% amazing.  But 100% terrible game mechanics from CCP.
---
Wait is this real or is this a CCPlz? 
---
Cyno toons on the floor
---
Maybe, back then we had lots of direct nullsec WH, can remeber a fight where we found 2 carriers and a Kronos in a Deklein Anom, fed them 2 Ceptors, and reshipped 2 j. out (through WH) to some Ishtars. Went back to anom, and then killed 4 or 5 Carriers from response + some shiny Marauders. Guess it was the OEG russians ...
---
Too soon
---
You can't invoke the democracy justification in an election with -10% turnout, nor talk about "everyone's opinion". You can only say things like "block voters don't agree with you".
---
What happens in the hanger stays in the hanger!
---
Jesus. I can't even begin to describe how fundamental Guard has been to CCP and Eve its not even funny. This worries me excessively.

You can really see the state of this sub when a post about CCP Guard leaving generates hundreds of upvotes--in an industry where employee turnover is already only like 2-3 years--and a feature we've been asking for for YEARS that they are finally delivering on can't crack a hundred.
---
Keep on rolling CCP, this is some good shit.  To the tinfoilers: your work is important but you have to always be a minority.

Gotta shake things up if you want to keep the fire burning. Especially for smaller groups.
---
You're not entirely wrong 
---
I LOVE dick, love it..
---
Put like 45 cocks in my mouth and you have yourself a good time.
---
Yes you need good skills, good modules, and good minigame technique. Archaeology V really pays off here.
---
i was mostly memeing but i agree.
---
Haw dreads are very balanced. Sure they apply decently to BC's and up, however they are stuck there for 5 minutes. Lots of counter play goes into that.
---
Carriers apply to destroyers FAR to easily, and a niddy can throw a nano drekavec into structure rediculously easily. Sure you can TD fighters, web them to keep them out of optimal or jam them. The issue is that it takes FAR too much coordination to deal with just 1 of them, and most groups drop 5 + a FAX.
---
Their ability to apply to smaller ships is just too huge of an issue. Make them apply 70% without support to a Battleship, not to a cruiser as it is now. 
---
&gt; Yet the other, you roll into horde space looking for easy kills during a stratop and get thrown a curve ball towards you and end up making a video with the purpose of saying how your upset you couldnt farm easy kills all day.
---
How does this invalidate the other point?
---
well i guess that's one off the one real uses ive heard off for clone bay's.  
---
the panic realy needs a change. only idea's i have so far is  
---
1. its only for saving the fleet around you not the rorqaul since you have a massive tank already.  
---
2. make it need cap to run so yeah you panic 'd but now your out off cap and its such off early   
---
1 would make it so you can keep your bridges  and what not alive but  on for as long as you can tank the enemy.
---
2 just makes it so you invulnerable for the same time as long as you can keep you cap up enough to keep the module running. aka a big enough fleet is just gonna turn it back off again if you cant cap tank them   
---
They need to offer him a big raise to stay.

Prolly why it never happened tbh.
---
My rig is pretty shit compared to whats usually even minimum requirement in most games, and still would be able to run the 64bit client, according to the updated reqs i read a few days ago.
---
Oh nice never heard that joke before.
---
Wales
---
So he's British, gotcha.
---
&gt; what i want is interesting fights. but these fights get usually shut down in an instant by caps beeing dropped left and right. 
---
You need to start the "interesting fight club"...and then you and the other people that are only looking for "interesting fights" can have them.
---
OR, since capitals are being dropped left and right, when you return to that area, maybe bring the proper ship yourself, (ie capitals). 
---
OR just shut the fuck up, because what you really want is to 10v1 a ratting VNI when you say "interesting fights"
---
There are always going to be a portion of any game that runs on the lowest settings due to old hardware, but even implying that a majority of us do is clearly untrue. CCP stated that .5% of their playerbase currently run on a 32-bit OS and most likely have other gathered statistics that show them that this update will not affect a majority of players.
---
If we use the Steam Hardware survey as a source of information, 94% of Windows users have a 64-bit OS and only about 5% of players have less than 4GB of RAM, with more than 70% having 8 or 16GB.
---
This update is long overdue, as is multi-threaded server code (which is a task far more difficult than the client), but from what I can tell it won't negatively affect as many players as you'd like people to believe.
---
If every ratter in the game has this "I win" button, then why the fuck doesn't he?
---
It's bullshit.
---
Good write up! I think this a good source for anyone who wants an idea of how industry works in EVE. 
---
Bad r/all bait thread is bad. 
---
Not sure the 64 bit deal will be the issue. It will be frame issues caused by Gfx cards running dx12. I don’t care I will be fine but it will be interesting to see how a lot of the “Home computer” crowd handles the shift 
---
Yep it's got nothing to do with the fact that you came screeching to reddit while also calling a director a "faggot" (truly a unique insult had to reach back to the memory of middle school eh?) But no no please keep calling people slurs because you cant come up with a good insult
---
I hope your moving onto better things Guard o7, youll be missed here for sure.
---
No, you can literally set it up an walk away until downtime and it will do it for you without any software or terribly complicated setups.
---
I mean there's way too many variables to even start to give you helpful advice.
---
Where are you trading? How much capital do you have? How many order slots? How low is your overal tax?
---
I could talk for hours about possibilities but without knowing your situation it's difficult.
---
Personally, once I had built up to 10b-20b trading isk I branched into nearly everything that dropped as deadspace or faction loot in my region. Then high value common mission loot. I also station traded ships and ammo on bulk. I made predictions on weekday/weekend plex dips and spikes. There's honestly so much depth you can go into, it's unreal and can be a little daunting.
---
PM me if you want to talk on comms and I can get you started and looking at the market right.

---
My idea is more simple.
---
Remove invulnerability .
---
Give it the same tank as a carrier.
---
what the fuck???????? Really? Guard? He was the best.
---
From what I understand, they will probably rip out the current FW system because of old code and replace it with something else that is similar.
---
-10% turnout? Jesus, negative turnout is a really bad showing!
---
For reference you will need a Gtx 950 to utilize dx12. That card came out in 2015 but I suspect lots of eve players don’t even know they have a gfx card
---
These guys are still relevant?
---
EvE is the best MMO I've ever played. It's literally the only one that has kept me coming back again and again. And now that I've found some good people to fly with. I don't see myself taking a break any time soon. 
---
That's a pretty one-sided story.  Looks more like a hit-piece than an honest journalistic effort.  The truth is probably more in the middle than this far to one side.
---
IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP..
---
best argument.. has no counters.. apart from CAPITAL SHIP.
---
well its meant to be a support cap so if ya remove that invulnerability (witch im not apposed to invulnerability states are bull shit ).  
---
a small buff or simply move some off its power over to smaller reps, larges  
---
unless you wanna keep its damage ability then remove the rep power and just make it a tanked carrier then would work to
---
We need to be able to slide the gate into the plex without getting blapped outside of it. Acceleration gate camping is out of this world. Sure, you can DSCAN first, but in many situations the campers just warp to the gate as you do, are cloaked first, or are using a recon ship. I'm for being able to slide the gate if you are of the right ship size no matter what.
---
Signal Cartel is a good friendly group if you enjoy doing exploration
---
DX11 is all that is required, not 12, which started to become available in 2010.
---
Remove local remove local remove local.  
---
Also, add a spool up for cynos.
---
You're not going to get rid of supers or caps at this point and tbh they have balance issues (sirens should not have mwd, titans should not have haws, etc.) but they are not completely broken if you know what you're doing.  People underestimate the importance of perfect intel to using jump-capable ships, though.  Without such near-certainty, people would be less willing to drop or, at least, counterdrops would be more viable.
---
Add to this a mechanics, often suggested, in which cynos take 1min to spool up, modified by 5x for caps (see: rorquals needing a cyno alt) and during spool-up they are un reppable, like HICs, and you have fixed so much of the issue.  Small gangs now have a chance to kill the cyno ship, and gates need to be scouted in order to be safe.
---
Imo the real problem in the game, rhat this wouldn't entirely fix, is a more conservative PVE mindset.  I've seen countless ruthless veterans turned into snivelling carebears just by the rewards CCP dangles in their face.  In this meta, local chat is used to avoid fights rather than take them--I regularly see something like a 10 man gang avoiding a 12 man gang because its not a sure dunk, and using local scouts and intel to do so.  Imo, if they won't fight, make them run into each other by accident and see what happens.  Cyno spool-up is a key mechanic in making that happen, because it helps slow down those engagements and make both sides think.
---
Do you have a resource one could read to see all (or some of) such cases? It is not often when general lurker can see real result of CSM. Thanks.

in game bug reports are a thing. probably better the use them than to post on reddit

Thanks for bringing me, Miles. I was very happy that I came along on your journey.

Good luck in EVE Online.

Thank you, and very well said.

Only the thing is, your wallet balance does not impress me in the slightest.
---
Fuck off with this /r/all bait
---
I guess your Daddy hasn't talked to you yet.
---
Might come back to the game if some actual improvements are done to the large fight performance. I mostly enjoyed the fights that "meant" something, but there is only so many years you can put up with the misery that the fights themselves actually entail. 
---
Uhm...  Guard wasn't a customer service person. 
---
Hello, you're a good person and have value.
---
Gotta admit though, that story had plenty of *Pshhhhhht*
---
So what is your eve char name, so we can sho... recruit you
---
And how much isk/hour does it generate?
---
W H O ?
---
I'm with you, it's a meaningless reward. Just extracting alts you don't want to test with get you many times that with way less effort. Imo they should give each participating character one random skin that is not tradeable/automatically activated on that character (on TQ), or something along those lines. 
---
ur dumb
---
Mods delete this.
---
It dosent invalidate the other point, it just makes me unsure whether I should say "fuck that rorq pilot" 
---
Also like holy shit the flu hit me hard and my body is a hive of sickness and death send help pls.
---
Nothing of value will be lost
---
I don't, sorry. 
---
This is a terrible advice (I am not downvoting it due to your actual effort to help OP).
---
Mobile Depot can be probe-scanned and your "safe spot" would be compromised. It's much, MUCH safer to just jettison your loot into space. IIRC, cargo containers stay in space for several days (if not forever), and they can't be probe-scanned.
---
Absolutely best thing to do would be scanning the chain until you find a quiet C3 with LS or NS statics, move at least  1 scanner alt there along with your main (they could be on the same acc, no need to multi-box). Scan with main, do explo-sites, scan any wandering or K162 connections, do sites there as well. Drop all the loot at safe (jettison) and pick-up with alt.
---
With this approach even if your main gets shot, you still have great chances to take all the loot to HS. 
---
I figured. I wasn't upset. didn't lose anything. I wonder if you can tell how dangerous another player is...like if they can tell I'm new...or does everyone just kill on sight?
---
And is cloaking only for Omega?
---
If you're looking for basic data, there is an official Eve app for mobile devices.  Just download, sign in. It has training queue, wallet balance, calendar, and you can read and send mail.
---
There are more advanced applications, but this will do for basic info.
---

Ahhh my bad I misunderstood I was like wait no. Honestly though I liked nestors much better. With a blingy fit you only ran them a few minutes slower than a pair of snakes and was much less spooky if someone splashed into your farm hole. Refit mjd and bounce.

who is james??

1 We do not look at the bio of folks when they are kicked.

2 Your ISK balance had nothing to do with you not being allowed back.
---
Kinkka?
---
You should try asking them. Far as a I know frat is primarily Chinese.
---
Yeah the second video in this post shows the weakness of HAWs just fine. Titan couldnt do shit to untackled MWDing destroyers, even at 70km. A super or even a shitfit ratting thanny would have absolutely roasted the kikis on the other hand. 
---
One of the deepest simulations of space adventure you can have. Ive done spying, management, and fcing and i can really tell you it taught me valuable lessons for work and rl.

And fun also. Believe me or not but im still smiling when i remember how we laughed when shadow cartel dropped a rag on my first bash. 
---
Thats why people stay. Even today i still wanna talk with my former mates so i log in to blops once in a while.
---
I don't think salt is all that market-able.
---
Tbf they never quantified what they consider to be near future. Its a space game so clearly the default would be cosmic timelines where a few thousand years could be near future
---
You can write a bot to do that
---
I know man, these stupid fuckin Elite peeveepeers just dont get it do they?
---
I was speaking abstractly about a diminishing returns system - repetitive use of bounties against the same person over a period of time will lessen the burden on their loss. Or better yet, bounties can only be placed if that person took part in destroying your ship / pod, or if they perform a criminal act against your or your in-space property (including wrecks).
---
I hate to agree with a goon, but if a ship is stuck someone for t-minus 5 minutes, it needs the ability to survive, since it would appear the whole reason it has to stay stuck is to provide points for content to occur. 
---
Then again we have a wormhole guy who just jumps back through the instant anything looks bad, so if we remove the ability to tank well on a rorq, then wormholes need to be more picky about letting people run away through them. But that'll never happen, can't hurt the pvp players!

Sad to hear that youre leaving, but i hope you will be happy on your new adventure.

---
It's a small forum of player representatives that CCP can use to get feedback. 
---
Without CSM feedback will almost certainly be based on who is close friends with a dev and who posts the largest angriest post on the forum.  I can't say that will be an improvement.  A lot of people here seem to hate on the CSM, I can see that it's popular. Most seem not to consider what the alternative would be.
---
Mmmm it's been years since I did it. I wanna say I optimized it up to 20-25m isk/hr, just pure bounties. That was with the best *fit* I could devise, not with perfect skills, but most of the advanced ones up to 4. Scraping up the loot was worth a few million more in minerals. 
---
'Course I wasn't using "The Labyrinth" as far as I remember, and after reading about it it seems that the ships there are larger and thus the bounties would be higher.
---
o7 some just live to see Jita Burn.
---
nice to bad there is hardly any one left
---
&gt; 2 just makes it so you invulnerable for the same time as long as you can keep you cap up enough to keep the module running.
---
Gee, That sounds great! Also, what's a cap booster?
---
WH needs a corp, unless youa re VERY high SP it's kind of redundant to live alone in WH. Living in WH also needs a high SP. And you need at least a CovOps ship to fly. Cloaking is 50% part of the game in WH. Not having cloak skill is simply a death sentence, and especially living alone. Also you need to learn to Dscan, hotkey it and spam it all day since WH don't have local to watch out.
---
Also you seem to be interested with exploration, which I say not really the most lucrative job in WH and inconsistent ISK (still better than huffing gas). Exploring has the lowest SP job out there but you still need a cloak and good scanning skills. Still, try to get your hacking level a bit high, because the hacking map is harder than your normal HS/LS boxes.
---
I suggest if you are serious in WHing, try getting T3 Cruiser of your choice before getting in WH, it's the best ship to rat Sleepers, the one that drops the best ISK out of living in WH.  
---
But honestly, living in WH isn't really that hardcore "feeling", its just it is very hard to get money unless you rat. There are no fixed mining operations, the gas are not really that profitable IMO. You just have to deal with loneliness, and having difficulties to get to major trade hubs to buy stuff. Living alone also make it a very hard for you to roll wormholes (a way to reset your static wormholes to get to a K-Space you want by going in and out with large mass of spaceship). Most people living in WH are with corps or with alts.
---
This isn't the only piece and only source though, it just happens to be the only one I have bookmarked in my articles folder. Yes, I bookmark and keep links to all sorts of interesting articles, mostly for research purposes related to my job, but I also keep some that I simply find interesting. And you gotta look at each paragraph of it too, for me, the most concerning of all is the one that mentions shift in business model. I have seen multiple game design / balance changes and lack thereof resulting in the current state of things in the game for example since, that perfectly match this.
---
There are other pieces you can find in quite a few places, and sources to corroborate,I just don't have them handy.
---
Too lazy to mine with Rorquals for the next 8 years to be able to get a force of 600 titans and 300 FAX so you can actually win a capital escalation in Esoteria/Delve or Tribute. SMH
---
i too try to dadyjack every other post
---
wh's have always been jumping when it comes to fights. comes with being in a system where you have no idea if some one is watching so you just assumed there is an any thing could be bait for a cloak gang near by.  
---
but yeah if its gonna be stuck there it at lest needs something to help keep it alive while it is there currently it just has to meany things i can do.
---
hey leave my 200 dps venture alone! 
---
Look at the flowers, CSM.
---
&gt; rarely anyone is looking for easy kills
---
I'm sorry, do you even play eve?
---
Well yeah cap boosters is what you would use to keep it running. the whole point off the idea is trying to keep other cap in the rorqaul to get it running because if you run empty it turns off.
---
but its just an idea i came up with just now. haven't had time to realy think much about it
---
maybe not the best but a solution none the less.
---
Sounds like you're made snuff lost a Hel
---
He gains absolutely nothing by doing that, and gains a lot by sweet talking his previous employer, even if they're shitlords.  It means literally nothing, it is just sound business decision even if they were actually Satan.
---
Can confirm, I was one of forty-five.
---
They never left the safety of their escape hole. Props denied

And Guard

Then don't go there.

The mobile depot getting scanned, so what? You can drop your shit in it before you get popped and that Depot can get reo'd but not blown up (1 day timer), come back in a few hours and you're fine.  A container is a good alternative for sure.  You giving advice to a dude that has clearly 1 toon without covert cloak so not sure why you're talking alt's vs. mains.  
---
If you're daytripping (try to avoid Wormholes with direct High Sec connections), the best options are to make sure you map your way, always have a mobile depot, know the sites you are planning on running and if you need some fits send me a DM, happy to help.  Having a good training plan is a good idea as well.  I started in a WH corp that taught me by just doing the sites/scanning/etc with another player however don't be discouraged.  You will get caught, you will lose your ISK and your ship.  That's part of EVE and this game is cruel and awesome.  Praise BOB!
---
I have never been popped on my Mobile Depot and I only do C3 sites (and that's only 3 years in WH space now but I might try the container).  If you see combat probes, don't warp to it.
---
Aw what a nice little overstuffed hauler you have, it'd be a shame if something happened to it...

&gt;You need to start the "interesting fight club"...and then you and the other people that are only looking for "interesting fights" can have them.
---
that was called the AT and the few player run tournaments that used to happen, i'd say ask ccp how those go but they wouldn't respond nowadays.
---
&gt;OR, since capitals are being dropped left and right, when you return to that area, maybe bring the proper ship yourself, (ie capitals). 
---
an unironic just seed dreads retard, wew

Interesting read.  Do you find it profitable to build and ship to Jita or just build to meet your own alliance needs?
---
it's a pretty significant difference when you're moving a good volume of them
---
cyno spoolup wouldn't do much other than making krabs even more averse to breaking away from nullblobs, and thats before even talking about the effects it would have in fleet warfare. The problem isn't cynos but the ship's tank and mechanics in the case or rorqs and application of supers and carriers
---
In imperium whalers we do all loot goes to the cyno that caught the target as they're the most likely to die in a valuable ship that they provided and usually fly T3Cs so they lose SP too. However we do SRP fleets, do full-value ship buyback on bombers, recons, and dictors, and regularly hand out fit ships to those that need.
---
The bookmarking method is kind of tedious and slow. There are faster ways.
---
Cloaking is Omega only i think. ( not near eve to check ) 
---
The likely can tell your new by being uncloaked and scanning, like realistically the majority of scanners are cloaked.
---
Any player is really a danger, even if they can't kill you the can provide warp ins cloaked for people that can kill you. 
---
If you see another ship in wormhole space i would generally assume there out to get me ( or i'm out to get them ), it's possible to tell if your new but honestly character age isn't all that telling anymore given we have injectors these day's plus they could be alts of experienced players, so very few people look at it. 
---
I might look at it after the kill and feel bad ( generally i don't start a convo after killing somebody to give advice anymore because most people are very unwilling to receive it ), if people ask spoiler they generally get there hull refunded, because if your in there to learn I want you to keep going. 
---
Because they said as much? The fact that I don't have a precompiled list of "thangs CSM did" to give that guy on hand doesn't mean I don't know the odd thing or two from memory.

Because hes querns and you have to believe everything he says!

---
Always loved your contributions.   Fly safe.
---
Yes, quite. AFK farming 25m/hr is an exploit and bad, sure, but (even not accounting for botting) there are hundreds or thousands of pilots doing near-AFK farming in nullsec VNIs for three times that, and hundreds more using capital ships to print five or more times as much.
---
Fix nullsec anomalies or risk in nullsec before caring about this kind of edge case.
---
it sure does follow the trend of marketing being lies
---
Like other guy said, skills matter, as do modules and technique. I can do almost all cans with alpha max skills, t1 analyzer, in a imicus. Remember that you only need to kill the core to win the hack, ingnore other things unless it’s in your way, the “rule of six” that says I’f a node is surrounded by six other ones, it is free of bad guys, unless the core is within one click. There are also modules (t2, ligature, zeugma), rigs (under scanning rigs in the fitting menu) and implants (“black glass” and some of the “Poteque” ones) the implants and modules imo are too expensive to make sense in such a high risk activity, but rigs are only a couple mil.
---
The only answer is "Who cares, they are baseliner scum anyways."
---
Tornadoes?
---
yes, still best alpha gank ship.
---
nope wouldn't solve any thing you just add a new alt for them all to train up.
---
No more free vacations *sad face
---
&gt; they are stuck there for 5 minutes
---
And they cannot receive remote reps, making them very vulnerable to anybody enough DPS. HAW dreads are in a good place right now.
---
Carriers and Supers, on the other hand, are almost unkillable with subcaps while applying quite well to them at the same time.
---
You can jump through the hole too btw

&gt;high skill ceiling
---
eve has unironically one of the lowest skill ceiling by far compared to most other mmos on the market. The vast majority of fleets being run takes less skill than playing a level 2 hunter in wow. The few people that still do mildly challenging piloting are slowly leaving the game because why bother when f1 is more effective or just switching to 3/4 boxing ships in fleet cause its far more effective.

Well, that's game over for Eve then.
---
Guard is one of the few who still understand what Eve's supposed to be and what makes it special. Without his voice in design meetings, expect more of PA's loot box nonsense, more safe farming in nullsec and less and less enjoyable PVP.
---
And I know he says it has nothing to do with recent developments, but unless someone's offered him silly money, you don't choose to leave your employer of 16 years from a senior position unless something made you question whether that was the right place to be when it had been before.

As a programmer, this makes me sad. To see people use their power for evil. Such shame.

There's a special place in hell for these people, where they will be forced to maintain cheap, outsourced PHP websites 24/7 for eternity. A sky-high, ever growing stack of buggy WordPress themes sitting on the side, awaiting their turn.

I try to keep rapacitys kb green
---
Then orphan has go to fuck it up by dying in a hel:(
---
:pepehands:
---
Also why is this random reddit thread a thing so long after it died 
---
IMHO **all** VNI and all AFK ratting needs to be "fixed" in the entire game. That's just me though. As for specific places in the game, looking at the MERs .... Its a no brainer where the fix priorities should go and which ones need a lot more fixing then others.
---
Maybe CCP should make a PVE Server for you guys to join instead. 
---
&gt; that was called the AT  ...
---
So, you only undocked once a year?
---
All the purple in the world won't save you from a possible desync or DC

No, if you lapse your Omega subscription you won't be able to do anything that requires those skills. The extractions/construction you have running at the time will finish, but you will not be able to start new extractions/other jobs, move anything to the launchpad that wasn't already routed there, or extract your items from the planet.
---
That solves nothing, the null farmers just use an alt account to sit in that ship with their rorqs/gatecamps/whatever.

I don't ship anything to Jita.  Building for my group's needs in null sec and have steadily increased my wealth over time. 
---
There are a few types of salvage that don't drop in our space, so I have to haul that kind of thing in, but for minerals, PI, and moon materials, we are self sufficient. 
---
It was decent enough until CCP started to cut back and only allow the reps with the highest amount of votes have any actual sway/benefit. 
---
That’s not even NC forums lmao
---
What's wrong with botting if everyone's doing it
---
&gt; if a ship is stuck someone for t-minus 5 minutes, it needs the ability to survive
---
So marauders and dreads should get invuln when they siege as well, right?
---
No, because that would ridiculous. As it is for rorqs.
---
what mother fucker doesnt have a forum avatar in tyool'19
---
Comparing suitonia to brisc lol, Brisc is actually retarded as well as being a lobbyist irl he has done literally nothing for anyone but goons
---
What skills does it take to perform well in the abyss? I've nearly maxed out my alpha drone skills, but I still got defanged in a T1 abyssal site by a rogue drone that alphaed all of my drones off of the field. 
---
What's a good PVE fit for the Hawk?
---
Okay.
---
Cyno as a mechanic is bad for the game. Its oppressive, overpowered, and there is realistically no counter to instant travel.
---
Cynos need a serious delay and injectors should not be able to inject capital skills.
---
Beautiful 
---
I'd say you are so butthurt but that would be going too far.
---
I'm beginning to give up hope that CCP will ever understand why it's a bad idea for capitals to be better than subs at engaging everything. With the CSM being almost entirely nullsec blob voices, do they even understand that there is a problem, never mind have any ideas about fixing it?
---
Imagine being so dumb, you screenshot forums and say it’s NC. lol
---
excellent score
---
haha epic picture of a space vessel xD
---
&gt;If you see combat probes, don't warp to it.
---
But, but... it has all your loot, how do you take it back? :) This is a bigger issue, than someone RFing your depot for gigs. You see the probes, it means your spot is compromised, even if you log out and log back in after a 1 day, you can't be 100% certain there is not someone camping you by your depot. It sounds absurd, but there still is a chance (theoretical at least).
---
And just to make it clear - I was not speaking of daytripping. I don't like daytripping as it takes all of your time to scan stuff that is worthless for you. Keeping 1 account with 2 characters logged off in some random system is more effective, it's like living in WH without owning any structures. You scan it every day, depending on the mood, weather and positions of stars in the sky you scan chain, if you find good HS connection, log-off, login with alt, move your stuff, come back. It is simple, it is effective and many folks just keep couple of spare accounts in a random systems like this. 
---
hirr are still shit
---
Anyone seen McMelch?
---
&gt;Jump mechanics are a symptom that is more noticeable due to proliferation, but not the inherent cause of the issue. Fix capital application, and cyno's/instant support become less of an issue. As now that Hel can't insta-blap nearly every subcap on grid.
---
Its both. If you just nerf caps, they switch to blops.
---
&gt;And they cannot receive remote reps, making them very vulnerable to anybody enough DPS. HAW dreads are in a good place right now.
---
Aka "bring your own links".
---
I dont mind cynos, not even as they are now.  
---
Im just a bit sad/salty that the mentality seems to have changed for many people to "just drop caps/supers".  
---
Sure, if you changed cynos with a delay and stuff, it might make drops less frequent (or give people more time to run away), but it will most likely open a whole other can of worms.  
---
Like, jump freighters being way more vulnerable, if you affect covert cynos as well, seriously fucking up that playstyle as well, etc.
---
Before fights like Asakai losing a supercap used to be a fairly big deal still 
---
Having problems with your mobile phone? Tried turning it off and on again?
---
I think jump fatigue in part caused this issue. In the old days you had to be careful about deploying caps because there was always a bigger fish in range.
---
Surprised I didn't see a stain gate comment.
---
Living solo in wormholes is challenging but very rewarding gameplay. There are several ways to do it. Setting up your own structures in a hole to live out of is probably the ultimate way which gives you the most flexibility but that requires startup funds, experience, and dedication to run all of your own logistics. Multiple accounts are incredibly useful in this approach. Short of that you can live nomadically out of an orca with a second account. Daytripping is probably the easiest and best suited for new or casual players.
---
&gt;You're not going to get rid of supers or caps at this point and tbh they have balance issues (sirens should not have mwd, titans should not have haws, etc.)
---
Kind of a pointless statement. The problem is CCP is shit, so caps will stay mostly as they are, but thats their choice.
---
So long Guard, hopefully you make your next community as happy as you did us.
---
Free trips to China ... unless you are Canadian.
---
&gt;Like, jump freighters being way more vulnerable, if you affect covert cynos as well, seriously fucking up that playstyle as well, etc.
---
Dont have the delay apply to JFs. Instant travel is a problem and basically uncounterable. "Cyno" shouldnt be a valid playstyle since it is oppressive.
---
You seem salty. Lost some afk vni recently?
---
Last of the great ones at CCP to leave. Hope his new adventures are all fulfilling. Thanks for the happy memories.
---
No it fucken wasnt
---
Yeah I get that. A mercs killboard says a few things... how successful they are in picking engagements (depending on what you see on it) and how risk averse / they are. I don’t necessarilly think an all green killboard is bad as it shows that they are either very good at planning and picking their engagements. Maybe they go through extreme lengths to ensure their success with all the strategies and mechanics available at their disposal. 
---
I like operating where I do because I feel the capital meta would be too oppressive in areas of space where your average group is larger, and backed by an even larger coalition. Aside from some niche wormhole groups, can you think of anyone in Lowsec or Nullsec that is a true mercenary? I had heard of them existing in the past such as Mercenary Coalition and Noir, but that time has come and gone... 
---
Really the only reason I’m doing this in the area of space that I am is because my only real close Eve friends are here with me. I would love to take what we do and apply it to Wormholes, and I know we’d be a formidable opponent. Highsec is just an area that I’m personally fond of... when was the last time you heard of some kind of player driven content in the sandbox creating an incredibly unique story? I can’t think of one... maybe something like The Judge shitting on CO2 fits the description but yeah.
---
Not really any thing on YouTube to catch you up on 12 years. Just find a decent mid sized group and try to pick it back up. 
---
Ps, 100m ain't shit now.
---
Don't lie. You just watched from the corner.
---
Im sure it was. :)
---
And so CCP Guard removed the training weights from his shoulders and limbs. The weights fell from the pedestal he was rightly set upon and crashed to the Earth. As the dustclouds that billowed out of the crater cleared, CCP Falcon stood ten feet tall. A bigger man than all of us. Stepping down from where he once sat, he wandered off to strike out on his own. His eyes gleamed like pearls as he walked away from the abyss.

Isn't GSF told how to vote, and I think punishes / kicks those that don't comply?
---
 Problem with that is you have init in hakonen, Imperium in uemon, and test constantly making the trip for fights. How do you count for all that.
---
AT3 had both the Tribal and State Raven as prizes. Four of each ship was handed out (iirc 7 to the first place team and one to the runner up).
---
I had a Tribal up for lottery back in 2009 and it yielded 100 billion ISK at the time. In 2011 (I think it was) one was sold privately for 650 billion. One State Raven and a Tribal was stolen by a famous pilot during a move-op "pending" a sale (they should have used someone more trusted ;) ).

There's an amount of effort to living in a wormhole - scanning the chain, rolling holes if necessary for content or to cut off something dangerous in the chain, looking for places to rat, looking for exits near trade hubs, fuelling structures - that is shared if you live with friends, but which is annoyingly large if you're solo. And, well, pretty much everything in Eve (and other hobbies?) is better with people to do it with or talk to about it. So I recommend looking for a wormhole corp rather than trying to solo.
---
You can daytrip into wormholes to explore easily enough. I used to do a lot of that before I joined a WH corp. I wouldn't recommend daytrip ratting because you don't know what else is in chain, and it's much more expensive if you get caught.
---
Trebor was a great CSM.

Unless you're botting, yeah. There's two separate points in my post, about 'near-AFK farming in VNIs', and about carriers.

I'd be happy to see them drop BLOPS on our 4-7 man gang. BLOPs are just glorified battlecruisers as far as EHP goes. BLOPs are actually not isk neutral like a carrier/dread, as they insure poorly. It takes a single bhaal or even a curse in some cases to neut out an active tank blops and their DPS is average at best for a battleship.
---
Hell, i've killed [BLOPs](https://zkillboard.com/kill/69961830/) battleships solo when they dropped 5 BLOPs on me. BLOPs are squishy as hell, nothing like dealing with carriers/supers/dreads. 
---
Does that hurdle even exist anymore when to jump it all one has to do is buy plex, convert that plex to isk, and then buy all the skill injectors they can?

I didn't compare them, I said they did good work. That does not equate to they do equally as good work.

How did any of Brisc's talks with the war decking groups that were to be effected by the coming war dec changes, do anything for goons in specific, what benefit did he gain by listening to players grievances and criticisms on a system they disagreed with?
---
Shh, don't disturb the narrative now. We're the bad guys and we just want to see eve burn under the heat of our mining lasers and titan dd's.
---
Does this then mean that 80% of the profiles on that site are bots as well?
---
still dont like coce, but still enjoying these pictures, well done 
---
They usually drop way more than enough to ensure you cant do anything. You cant balance the game around the assumption that they will mess up somehow. The balance fundamentals have to be reasonable. Instant travel is not.
---
Uhh, they definitely want people to vote for their candidates, and the CSM is definitely a goon lobby, but I don't think they have any way to see who voted for who. Unless I'm mistaken, that's a step of tinfoil too far
---
Lol thank you 
---
Several times when I've tried to scoop an unanchored structure, it's bugged out and refused to let me do so even though I'm sitting at 0m with plenty of cargo space.  My best guess is that it has something to do with being on grid when something unanchors and the client still thinking the structure is anchored so  of course you can't scoop it.  I had to log off and then on again to be able to scoop it.  Now I just bookmark the structure, stay aligned towards it from the nearest celestial until it unanchors, and then warp to it.  That seems to have solved the issue.

chances are its either A. a scam.   B. a spy trying to seduce their way into your corp.  C. a scam aimed at ganking/betraying/killing you.   or d. some miner whose spent WAY TO MUCH TIME staring at veldspar.
---
They're just blocking alphas from level 4-5 missions because of botting.
---
100m is nothing. It doesnt even get you a battleship.
---
Yes, it is the UE4 spiritual successor to Dust 514 and is still in development. End of November CCP announced pushing release back to work on the game more. Not knocking them for it tbh -- better to release a good game late than a bad game on time.

unironically yes

Nope. It's still in development. CCP announced they would be pushing release back to work on it more. The announcement in question: [https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova](https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova)

We're hoping to slam home three candidates in the first elimination round this year. We could really use everyone's non-support.

Yes finding fights like that is rare but finding them gets me right back in love with EVE.

And BLOPs are balanced. 10, 20, 30, 50 BLOPs can all be countered by a bomber squadron. You can sit at 70-100km range in long range ships and pick off BLOPs while they can't do anything to you as none of them are range bonused. You can still control grid against BLOPs. They're only "scary" in scram range.  
---
I can bring a few T1 battleships and counter a vast majority of BLOPs, as BLOPs aren't mainline ships, they're ambush ships. Take out the ambush part, and they become high dps battlecruisers.  
---
Also, as BLOPs are battleships, things like a kiki gang or AF gang will be a pain in the ass for them to handle. Battleships/BLOPs are actually balanced. They run into the same issue as HAW dreads, get out of their range, and they're no longer a threat. Then let them slow boat your way and start to separate them and get some nice juicy kills.
---
Look up Eve University 
---
I tend to be a story-maker. I dream up the "plans" which are just stories in action and get people to sign on. It always revolves around small scale PvP because that is what I know and love. And it usually involves doing something dangerous because what is the point of doing easy things? 
---
A few nights ago we had to move an Athanor through hostile space. I have some brand new players with me and decided instead of jumping it, like a responsible industrialist, we would pack it into a few itty 5s. Eventually we got camped in a station, gave one player his first real combat kill, and had a blast. "See, if we had jumped this it would have been easy and boring. Instead we tempted fate and were rewarded."
---
My current plan is definitely a lowsec Merc story, but it has a long way to go and a lot of hurdles to cross before it will really grow into the "Merc" feel.
---
Honestly, I'd be fine with that. BLOPS are more expensive, do less DPS, and have FAR worse tank than carriers or dreads. It's pretty easy for a blops drop to go all kinds of sideways.
---
Hello, PH has friendly NBI who are willing to help newbies achieve their goals. What time zone are you in? I can hook you up.
---
&gt; You cant balance the game around the assumption that they will mess up somehow.
---
But you *can* make the optimal strategy difficult to pull off, to make it easy to screw up. Capitals are not easy to screw up, but blops are. 
---
Nah, I've lost one VNI in my entire time in EvE. I did kill one + a domi yesterday though. Why would I be salty that people failing to club VNIs?

Calm down goonie, you don't need to cry that any form of PVE outside of Delve is broken.

It works now but for some reason even after a reboot it wouldn't move out of full screen, took a day or so before it fixed itself. weird but sorted. tyvm.

Do it, you can get a taster for free, what have you got to lose but your spare time?
---
Bots want to find love as well
---
&gt; cyno spoolup wouldn't do much other than making krabs even more averse to breaking away from nullblobs, and thats before even talking about the effects it would have in fleet warfare.
---
Not to mention that dropping on things like supers and rorqs would be a thing of the past, because the cyno would be blapped before it could ever light. Meanwhile, the ship they're dropping on has all the time in the world to light it.
---
Can't wait what you will have to say. Not expecting dank leaks or something, but I enjoyed your blog back in the day. Did not always agree, but it was always a nice read.
---
They might be balanced in themselves, but the instant travel is not. If 15 BS instantly appear, that fight is going to be very different.
---
&gt;You can still control grid against BLOPs. They're only "scary" in scram range. 
---
How do you do that when you are scrammed by something and a cyno goes up? You can make the exact same argument against caps - just bring your own. Same shit we saw with links - bring your own. You appear to want to balance the game based on specific situations that happen to be favourable to you.
---
Ultimately, whatever "strategy" you bring, it is not the same as balance.
---
&gt;things like a kiki gang or AF gang 
---
They are overpowered, so of course they are a problem.

You're likely not finding many fights because that gang comp is completely unfightable for subs while being unable to even sit ongrid against 1 or 2 carriers.

Dunno, considering the hatred you have for your so called "elite pvpers", and the level of salt in your comment, it kinda seemed that way.

They just need to reduce the timer of the plex, it s still fucking so long. Also just delete fw mission, LP fw  should be earn only in plex, not in pve.

and it's 95% men

&gt; They might be balanced in themselves, but the instant travel is not. If 15 BS instantly appear, that fight is going to be very different. 
---
Depends on the situation, but i've been on grid with 8-10 corp mates against 10+ BS+kitchen sink stuff. We managed fine. Battleships aren't some uncounterable thing, they are well balanced, and if you try to attack everything in them like you do capitals, you're going to learn they aren't the answer to everything. No matter the numbers. Sure, we're not going to stick around against 100 battleships, but they drop 10-15, we can still pick off stragglers and remain on grid, maybe even snatching a battleship or 2 when they wander off.
---
&gt; How do you do that when you are scrammed by something and a cyno goes up? You can make the exact same argument against caps - just bring your own. Same shit we saw with links - bring your own. You appear to want to balance the game based on specific situations that happen to be favourable to you. 
---
Don't get scrammed?
---
Roaming null, there is a sarcastic/true motto during every roam. When we see something, we all say "thats cyno bait". Doesn't matter what it is. Random ship in system, oh, thats a cyno. Domi on scan, oh thats cyno bait. HIC on scan, thats a cyno. Random stabber appears and tries to ramrod you, definitely Cyno. There is one time where i've been scrammed and had a cyno dropped on me while doing small gang, and it was against goons, cause i let it happen so we could kill their bhaal. I managed to jam the cyno ship and get away (luck). Otherwise, i stay where i need to be in my gang and don't go ramming every target to get scrammed. Being pointed isn't an issue, just burn out and leave when the cyno goes up, or MJD if in a BC/BS.
---
Also, you can roam with a battleship(s), as they fit through wormholes and can rig them to be cruiser speed at warping. You can't/don't roam with a capital ship and take gates unless you want more capitals ships dropped on you.
---
Eve is a social game at it's core, and people tend to burn out quickly if you aren't flying with friends. Joining a corp is  usually the best way to meet said friends (there are some corps that are basically newbrow traps though). Most corps will also usually offer support in the form of information, infrastructure, and activities. NPC corps are basically interchangeable, with the exception of the faction navy corps. Those are the ones you automatically join if you are participating in faction warfare as a solo pilot and will put you at war with the opposing factions. 
---
i still remember them at some fanfest saying they wanted to fix afk shit, but then they came out with the rorqual a year or 2 later, so much for killing afk gameplay...
---
14 years ago, you could get a fitted BS. 
---
Good times
---
Will a corp take me basically as a newb starting again? Any suggestions? I’m just a bit - woke up in Serpentis prime with all my belongings and ships and no idea where to go. Scared to undock right now let alone anything else lol.
---
yea garmurs which are terrible in fleets and are removed by retributions.
---
lol if you think leshaks would be used in large fleets.
---
I'm not bragging about shit, you specifically asked implying I am a dumb krab, and I told you otherwise.
---
If your reading comprehension wasn't similar to a lobotomized chimpanzee, you wouldn't infer from my original post that I have any "hate" for "elite pvper", do whatever you want in this game. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy of crying about meeting unfair resistance/getting dropped on, when you're inherently looking for unfair fights yourself.
---
95? thats abit optimistic
---
Yeah I can't say I agree with the FC getting loot unless they're also running the expensive hunters, which they shouldn't be if they're FCing.
---
Horde loots, it's a beautiful thing.
---
Caveat:
---
 - No MTU on the battlefield, it's just trashy.
---
 - When looting dead Horde caps, offer loot back to the cap pilot. I'd say don't loot the wrecks, but goons will just kill em anyways. Plus, decent cap pilots will give you a finder's fee.  
---
That's pretty much it. 
---
What did I kill in 30 minutes that was 5bil?
---
a lot of whales play eve
---
Yeah that wasn’t a ‘I’m rich comment’, I have a scorpion and a raven and a load of frigates in my inventory.. assuming they are even flown these days (must be rusty by now). I guess I mention it as I’m not grinding out my first battleship (unless I undock in it any time soon) total newb, but in terms of how to play may as well be. I’m also out in 0 sec and not sure where to go or what to do first. Doesn’t look like I even have my bookmarks any more to get back to high sec (assuming space hasnt changed since back then). 
---
Golden dude
---
Yes! I was wishing for this so hard! Fantastic, simple change.
---
Alpha sucks major ass. Too many limitations. There is however one thing it is good for.
---
When you first start, it is good for exploring different ship and equipment types without having to commit to it, without spreading your main characters skill points. This becomes moot over time as eventually you will have all. But it takes a long ass time to get to that point, a couple years, or a hell of a lot of $$$ (pick your poison).
---
If you do decide to start, I recommend make at least 4 different accounts. They are all free, so you will lose nothing while exploring different game mechanics. And you can have them training into their ships / skills offline while you play the one you wanna play. Once you find one you play the most, have most fun with, then sub it. take the 3 or 6 month deal. Don't buy plex. Subs are much easier on the wallet and leave you worry free. But stay with alpha for at least a few weeks until you get to experience at least some of all this stuff.
---
Note that different peopels recommendations will vary, these are mine:
---
Account 1. Caldari - focus skills on shields, missiles, magic 14. Reason: best Jita standing from the get go, easiest for basic PvE combat.
---
Account 2. Whatever other faction - focus skills on whatever is that factions preferred tank and main weapon system, + magic 14. - reason, to get a taste of other ship types for combat without spreading skills thus becoming ineffective. I would focus this one on PvP, possibly on FW or put it into one of the newbie friendly NS corps a bit later on.
---
Account 3. Caldari - focus on industrial, trade, some mining or hauling - purpose, to explore how mining and indy stuff works as well as do some trading. Caldari for faction standing (Jita trade hub related)
---
Account 4. Whatever faction - focus on exploration skills and ships. Skills such as scanning, hacking, etc. + magic 14, but magic 14 can actually be secondary here at least for beginning. Purpose is to experience explo side of the game and get an idea of how these things work.
---
So there is a lot and its advisable to keep them seperate. 
---
Despite knowing that in the back of my mind, I almost always fought to the death. Man mode.
---
yes a 3.5bil malediction
---
Yes!! The possibilities!
---
thanks for the advice, I have started on one account and enjoying it so far.
---
CSM needed to go, yet it's still evidence that ccp is abandoning eve. 
---
I will not resub anytime soon. They simply do not care about us or the game.
---
These are amazing!!
---
It's pronounced Kardonay
---
Thank you! Thanks for the streams too, got me into ganking. 
---
You know what's the thing? This game doesn't give you anymore freedom of choice. It's either go big or go home.
---
And its all about the feels
---
found the f1 monkey...  spod isnt good for you my friend
---
 by quitting
---
o7 Guard goodluck on your next adventure irl
---
They dropped on on a 12-man T1 gang I was part of. Blew their load too early and instead bosoned their own Sabre. Fun times 
---
Would you agree other than your idea of what a ship should and should not tank, that that WAS an interesting fight (before all the support ships apparently left?)?
---
&gt; r/eve won't take part in the test
---
Unfortunately 5pm UTC is 11am for me, and close to that for most of the American time zone, assuming my math is right.
---
inb4 all the accounts on the dating site are bots and alts as well
---
I never implied that, I was making fun of the nano-kiters who have since 2003, whined about the counters to nano-kiters, which is typically up shipping.  
---
How is it difficult for blops to teleport in? What restriction would you like to add?
---
It is the instant appearance that is the problem and imposes the oppressiveness. Even if the blops happen to die, that doesnt mean the teleport was not overpowered.
---
95% of them already left, he was the one desperately trying to keep it afloat.  The fact that even he gave up is very telling, no matter what the PR spin is.
---
&gt; Won't be long before /u/CCP_Falcon is CEO at this attrition rate
---
Not a chance.
---
I can't speak for this gropu, but a lot of low-sec gankers like that are generally bored to tears, actually, by their own admission. I kinda pity them.
---
Zkill says 43. 
---
Why limit it to a small number of individuals, who have their own opinions and agendas, and not the larger player base? OSRS does that well, they allow the community to vote on changes or have a say.
---
I have no clue what you are talking about? My flair? I know nothing about cva, seemed like a funny flair to have. I never said anything about honor, it's just lame. My question to "people who don't like looking for content" aka gate campers that sit in tunnel systems or entrance systems is always how is that even fun or rewarding?
---
If you nerf caps, you might get to the point where things are not as bad, but still not good. There is no reason to be happy with that.
---
Trying to lure people into the area with good deals on the market.
---
Sorry don't understand the question.
---
That's called progress. There's no one thing that will put balance in a "good" place. But "better than it is now" is still better.
---
Teleporting in is easy. But blops are squishy as hell, and are booshable. Caps aren't. It's a hell of a lot easier for blops to go wrong.
---
Trying to lure unsuspecting targets into the area with good deals on the market.
---
They tried to invade Etherium Reach a few weeks ago and got the door slammed in their faces.
---
Do you want awoxers?  Because this is how you get awoxers.
---
Everyone who plays eve who is called James irl must feel kinda weird about these code posts
---
Hard to imagine CCP without Guard. Best wishes to him and I hope he is massively successful in the future. He was a defining character to the company for sure.
---
venture op 
---
Or flattered 
---
Working as intended 
---
🔥
---
50mn svipul is hilarious. It goes 12k without boosts or drugs and can fit a point and guns. 
---
&gt;Depends on the situation
---
That is what you should want to get rid of. You do not want to balance based on situation. You want, to the extent it is possible, "objectively" assess if something is reasonable considering the strength and effort of a mechanic. What cynos make possible is n+1 everywhere.
---
&gt;Don't get scrammed?
---
That is seriously the logic here? You might as well claim that if you always win, you never lose. This would "solve" every balance issue and apply to every situation.
---
&gt;I'm not against cyno iteration, but i think capital application needs to be reigned in first.
---
Once CCP actually does something, you better make sure everything needed is on the table, or you get to wait another few years. This is why the cyno issue must be addressed at the same time.
---
Wormholes are a good place to go, although I'm biased. Typically they dont have a proliferation of caps/super caps Nullsec is cancered by, and with some skills you can easily run C3 sites solo, making about 50m isk a site. 
---
Wormhole corps also have a focus on subcap and small gang pvp, which in your case would help catch you up on newer mechanics. 
---
As for your belongings, check the fits. If they're "legacy fit" sell them many in game collectors would kill to own some of the older fits that the game no longer supports. Literally just fireable everything and pick up new stuff instead of padding the local area's killboard 
---
He didn't present evidence proving that arguments presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, so his argument can be dismissed. 
---
BUBBLE UP!
---
That is relative to what they are dropped on. There is no reason to assume blops are not next in line to be abused if caps get nerfed. More will die compared to caps, but the problem is still there.
---
Spend 7bil on fleet, get ganked right away, no profit.
---
Hate CODE as much as ever, as the are one of the PRINCIPLE reasons new players decide to leave the game, but these pictures are tops. Great work. :D
---
Some nerd who says he owns highsec to farm salt. 
---
But we already "know". We dont need to nerf caps and nothing else and effectively grant 3 years of blops abuse when we see it coming.
---
You know how long it takes for CCP to fix things.
---
No it wouldn't be because the game would be completely inaccessible to lower skilled people because they would always get crushed. If skill was such an extreme force multiplier that tiny gangs could defeat the standing forces of a mega alliance then the entire game would be quickly dominated by one group.
---
Thank you!
---
Picked a faction ship that was becoming more popular for reasons I don't remember (Rattlesnake) - bought and flipped BPCs on public contract, used repeat sellers to buy direct cheaper and in bulk, used cheap as heck bulk BPCs to build for stupid amount of profit, times a lot.
---
One of those things where your initial investment/returns are small and take a long time to grow but once they start growing you can basically grow exponentially. I tried branching out into doing the same thing for Machs thinking I'd hop on the nullsec doctrine money train but people already do that way higher scale than I could ever do solo, lol.
---
bet he hates Sabre pilots
---
I think it's dumb to want the game twisted to give you want you want even if that means taking away from what other people want.
---
なるほど
---
Not to work on the game more, it was put on hold indefinitely. 
---
Sorry you seem to be under the impression that this is google. 
---
It's here:
---
https://www.google.com/
---
That doesn't seem to be the message conveyed in their last announcement. Source: [https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova](https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova)
---
So, let me see if I understand this correctly.  One person leaves CCP in order to pursue another venture, and suddenly everyone is thinking that the CSM is going away?  Did I miss another news article somewhere?
---
&gt;You don't understand the point that he is making that mechanic changes have made the game worse. This wasn't a major thing until carriers/titans were buffed v sub caps. 
---
Dropping a carrier umbrella on everything that moved was 100% a common thing pre-rework.  The idea that this is somehow new is pretty silly.  Ditto (some) titans.  Levis in particular were incredibly nasty to subs pre-rework.
---
Okay, I laughed, take your d@mn upvote.
---
Do people suddenly want the CSM now?
---
Fight with SMA. Sure they will drop on you, but they will probably lose anyways
---

---
I'm not saying 3 dudes should be able to take on 100, but if you battles are determined 100% by numbers, there is 0 incentive to actually be competent at pvp.
---
Why is it so bad for 10 skilled players to be able to take on 20 random dudes and win?
---
We all know thats not what is going to happen though.
---
Why refit mjd? Every snake fit I have ever seen has a mjd fit all the time. Which is why hardly any of them ever get ganked. 
---
The time it takes to refit multiple mjds is the time it takes to get scrammed by someone competent. 
---
With snakes the biggest fear is a dc
---
Holy fuck. OP almost every single thing this guy said was wrong - please do not take this to heart.
---
You can also have small corp in big entities. For example my corp is very small ( max is 10-15 character log together for cta and generally 2-3 in my TZ  but we all know good each other and are friend) and we are in init , 10 k character.
---
I don't see a problem with that 
---
Eventually that supply will dry up.
---
Wait.. SMA exists still? Thought they died like, years ago?
---
is that any different than now
---
Yeah, shield salvage is not a thing in Provi.  :-(  But boy do we get armor salvage.
---
As someone who roamed space daily 2013 to 2016 I have to disagree. Capital drops were 10x less frequent. Some of that is because of jump fatigue and some of that is because of the rework. 
---
Without fatigue jumps in defense of ratters were far riskier because if the roamer held grid 10-15 maybe pl or some other big bad would show up...
---
Before the rework the carriers were largely ineffective against subs in small #s and were far easier to manage. Carriers didn't lock with frig speed the whole damn grid with 6-10k moving fighters. 
---
I look at my wallet balance when I first start playing the game and then again right before I log off and if it’s bigger at the end than at the beginning to do more of what I did that day.  (Not dying to stupid shit helps).  Sometimes it’s not much more sometimes it’s less and sometimes that stupid icon flashes every 30 seconds of being logged in.  
---
This is unironically how I made most of my first billion in this game.
---
I'm a fourth hand vegetarian. Don't look in my basement.
---
&gt; Of course a skilled player should be better than an unskilled player. That gives the unskilled player an incentive to better themself.
---
This is already how it is, given equal numbers the skilled group will always crush the unskilled group.
---
&gt;Why is it so bad for 10 skilled players to be able to take on 20 random dudes and win?
---
My question for you is where should that ratio be set for fairness? Because if you ask a dozen different people you will get a dozen different answers for how many x number of people should be able to take on y number of lesser skilled people. And it will mostly lean heavily in favor of "my preferred small gang size should be able to take on the standing fleet of a mega alliance."
---
In other words: How do you balance around skill period? Afaik it's not a solvable problem without making the game unplayable for lesser skilled people.
---
Anyone with any brains knows that Init are far superior to any GSF sig. Don't waste your time arguing with that brainlet.
---
'EVE is dead/dying' will always get downvotes, but in all seriousness when so many big names are either made redundant or decide that CCP can no longer offer them the future they want, it doesn't fill me with confidence as a customer that everything is rosy behind the scenes. It feels like they see the writing on the wall and decide to move on before it's too late.
---
Who is going to make the music videos now?
---
You are assuming things about me while you dont even know me.  
---
I never considered myself to be "elite", not even mediocre, lol.  
---
And of course, i dont say no to a kill, even when its a VNI, just krabbing, but personally, i prefer fighting at equal odds, its just more fun for me. (Yes, imagine, people like that do exist)    
---
Also, makes it so i get more to do that way, since i usually tend to fly logi anyways ;)
---
But you know, at least the part with the lobotomized chimpanzee made me chuckle, so thanks ;D
---
Was the fight still interesting even though you felt the ships involved were unbalanced?
---
We're going to miss you CCP Guard!
---
Post totally not sponsored by geek2geek?
---
You really, really don't like lobbyists. What's the backstory there? 
---
GLHF hiring devs for $28k
---
poor guy needs a girlfriend.
---
oops, I said the "G"word, here comes the downvotes..
---
Touché, or should I say. *Tardonay*
---
Honhonhonhon.
---
~~But for real I didn't understand~~
---
Pretty sure he'd accuse her of "bot-aspirant behaviour" though :D
---
28k was the total budget for all that csm got?  Well I guess they could hire someone part time perhaps lol.  But there is also no dev time wasted answering Csm questions and hosting these events, so you get a few productive hours back plus a part time guy... I can dream ok!
---
ok how does that stop big null blocks from controlling the voting then?
---
You’re probably going to want to say what you’re doing with the Hawk. I wouldn’t say it’s probably very good for much PvE content besides a specific burner mission though. 
---
The problem is that caps are a counter to every subcap, not just nano-kiters. Application of caps to subcaps is broken AF.
---
Don't even mention NSAs...
---
Don’t know anything about reactions. 
---
You can look at materials and time needed for researched and unresearched by going to https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/ and punching it in there. Usually unresearched isn’t going to be even worth making and you might as well just buy the finished product. 
---
If you’re building from an original you can do as many runs as you like up to a certain limit which changes depending on what you’re making. You cannot set it to auto repeat, you’ll have to manually restart after every finished run. 
---
You have to wait for the entire job to finish to get your finished products. If you do 100 runs of something you’ll need to wait for all 100 runs to finish to get your items. 
---
Jesus christ, where did the wormholers touch you?
---
They remove or nerf cynos they hurt miners, miners help build your ships you don't want to piss the. Off.
---
That's actually not what the message - or the devs - have said since then. They said that they weren't entirely happy with the game, and the feedback they got at Vegas (and likely on here) made them feel they needed to polish and work on it more before releasing it into the wild.
---
Shit. Didnt think about that. /s
---
"Look at me, I'm going to shit on the CSM with no actual idea of what I'm talking about - Upvotes to the left"   
---
This thread (and subreddit about anything Eve related, tbh) in a nutshell.
---
He's a bot himself. 
---
sorry not a sinner
---
What a time to be alive. Code fighting in NS 
---
welp... I'd ask who is going to replace him, but I think the position of community leader is gone. As the Korean overlords trim the fat, I'd suggest they start with Hilmar next, but then again, the worst are usually last to get the axe. 
---
While I'm glad he's moving on to things that excite him and open new avenues in his life, CCP Guard really made my Eve Vegas experience awesome. He's just a fun, sociable person. When I was standing in line at Dre's at the bar, him and Rise just started chatting with me out of the blue, it was really cool. He's been one of my favorite CCP Staff for years, and Eve Vegas only reaffirmed that for me. So, I'm sorry to see him move on, but I'm glad he's trying something new.
---
For the sake of the highsec carebears that want to go out of their comfort zone and explore null, I will not share my story :)
---
logstash
---
Is it because CCP Guard isn’t 64bit compatibles ??? We can give him some silts to double his size surely ... 
---
Honestly sad to see him depart the crew and I’ve enjoyed his work. 
---
o/
---
I think there was something special about that particular site. I just did about 5 other data/relic sites and solved almost all of them. Except for that first one they seemed pretty much on par with regular low/null sec in difficulty. I also use an Imicus w/ T1 Analyzers, and have Hacking &amp; Archaeology trained to 3. Thanks!
---
Awesome thank you greatly for that, I should've known to look at fuzzwork for that kinda info. I also found that EveMon allows you to look at that information for blueprints, not for reactions though that I could tell. The answer about waiting for the entire run to finish is especially helpful as I get some projects started, I'd hate to have locked myself out of step 2 for a month -_-
---
Thanks for all the info!
---
they understand that. the thing is they dont care because caps make them lots of money and they can milk the casual krab playerbase they have been catering to for years now. 
---
That wardec fix should have been done years ago and you know it.  
---
Surprisingly enough, it never was important enough, because the main focus seemed to on be getting new players as fast into nullsec as possible
---
Sorry, I should've clarified that I didnt mean EVE should allow voting because of the obvious reason as you stated.
---
nope
---
Wardecs got a change eventually. You never know...
---
I wish they would give me isk
---
Contributing toward changes that help different people here and there doesn't justify a capability to overrepresent your playstyle in issues that actually involve a conflict of interest.
---
PBUH
---
Eh, they were certainly less effective, but that didn't really matter much when if anything of value got tackled, a couple dozen tiberizzle chimeras dropped in, with the supers/titans to follow if that wasn't enough.
---
That was, admittedly, pretty Dek-specific, though.  That said, it was just as possible mechanically, the playerbase just hadn't gotten on to it across the board.
---
If it wasn't a cheap fit into. It would have lived through 2 smart bombing machariels aswel. 
---
Nestors scale a lot better what you consider adding more ships. You can bring newbies in vnis, domis, etc with nestors, with rattles you can only bring more rattles.
---
For solo definitely snakes because fuck rr solo, but for groups nestors are arguably better 
---
Trash range and expensive tbh.
---
Granted  I like dreads personally 
---
&gt; Seems to me that a neut rorq on a hole with some random support IS a pretty interesting fight, until they pussy-ed out and ran. Did the 'wh whiner side' even lose a ship?
---
Tell me how many people were on comms, sitting in supers, waiting for the cyno go up. I'll wait
---
[Studies](https://youtu.be/A92Ge2S8M1Y?t=89) show that ganking improves new player retention.
---
It's funny how you're bragging about running burners for 8 hours a day for months long. Pretty sad life you got there. 
---
If they didnt bother to say goodbye, why would I bother to miss them?
---
I’m in Brave and logon for a few hours after the kids go to bed.  There’s always something going on. 
---
&lt;3 and miss guard
---
What needs to be mass tested in a client? Something's fucky...
---
Those people are not the meat of this game, they're just elite morons. 
---
Calling James 315 "some nerd" is like calling the Mona Lisa "some painting".
---
I don't even play eve anymore but jeez, this is depressing :(
---
If it’s true, I’ll hate no longer having an excuse to go to Iceland.
---
/I’ll make one up, but Fanfest was such a convenient reason to go.
---
3rd potential solution: Lockout.
---
On kill, the *entire* value of the loss is paid as bounty, up to the total bounty pool. After this, the target cannot board anything other than shuttles/rookie ships/T1 frigates (not faction) until they pay the bounty office the amount of bounty paid out on them. Note: not the *whole* bounty as otherwise poor players could have huge bounties put on them and effectively lose a character in the process. A T1 frigate is enough to climb back from any minor loss, and a major loss would come squarely under "don't fly what you can't afford to lose".
---
Really the only thing stopping bounties from having any impact (regardless of payout) is the fact that the person blowing up with a bounty on their head sees no actual setback other than the loss itself. Add the ISK overhead and immediately the bounty hunter reward jumps without any risk of manipulation (money in &lt; money out). 
---
This then opens the doors for payout modification. Sec stat applies a 50% reduction to 100% increase in bounty payout (eg a -3.5 player on exploding awards their killer 35% more bounty, and has to pay 35% more to the bounty office, compared to a 0.0 char). New skills for bounties such as Backdoor Dealing (reduce sec stat penalty on bounties against you by 5% per level) and Privateering (increase bounty value you claim by 5% per level). 
---
Bounties from destroyed ships and pods could manifest not as instant cash but as a bounty tag placed into the cargohold of the successful killer. This then needs to be taken to a bounty claim office to be turned in for the cash, with a limited number of offices - some of which charge a % fee on the claim. This adds risk in getting the bounties home, and can lead to a sizeable windfall for someone able to intercept an active bounty hunter ship. It also opens up yet another skill option, Bounty Negotiation, which increases access to more bounty offices, increasing both ease of access and giving access to the better bounty payout rates. The offices could be locked by both standing and this skill, similar to mission agents being locked by standing too. This further opens up avenues for bounty hunters and bounty *dealers* where the dealer can pay more for a bounty than a lucky/new hunter can get themselves. 
---
Citadel structures could install their own bounty offices, allowing for automatic purchasing the tags off other players with their own % fees on them, to be shipped off to the NPC purchasers. 
---
A crazy number of options open up as soon as the person who dies with a bounty on their head *actually has to suffer having died with a bounty on their head*. Imagine being the person to score last hit on a -10 sec titan with sufficient bounty on it and find that tag in your cargohold. Also imagine being the -10 sec titan with a bounty on your head.
---
2 minutes per is not impossible. Just take the standings boost drug, decline all except the easy ones (decline enyo, hawk, and worm) and only do the northern loop and you're set.
---
Or, if you run with a cruor instead of a 3rd or 4th DD, you can point the worm real quick and demolish it.
---
I think you need to learn about what burners are. I run with 3 DDs and 2 Kirins and I complete the enyo site in about a minute, worm and hawk with a max of a minute 30. Other sites take less than a minute. It takes less than a minute to pull each mission, and even less time to dock and undock to pull missions.
---
If you are taking more than 2 minutes per site you're just retarded.
---
Don't play this game like some mmo where you need to farm gold. People VNI rat to harvest isk in an extremely low effort way. You park the VNI in the system you will forever rat, and don't move it. You fly to it in a travel ceptor. If someone non blue comes in system, you dock. If you are in PH and a blue comes into your anom, you dock.
---
However, if you need isk and you are willing to be active about it, don't bother with VNI ratting or mining. That's what you do while watching Netflix. If they pop, so what. Also you can be far more passive about it too, with PI, station trading, or just straight up begging in PH's newbro channel.
---
I have done a few experiments to determine/learn about the game. I've now quit tho. 
---
1. Start a completely fresh alt, do all the tutorial/career missions, then sell everything rewarded to me and take that money to Jita. I started with 50m by selling all this basic equipment/vessels in Jita and I ended the month (4 calendar weeks) with 5bn ISK in liquid isk/assets/assets on sell orders in Jita. This was probably around 8hrs online per day, checking the character and updating orders probably much less often. Maybe 5mins per hour. \~2011
---
2. Went to Guristas Nullsec with a character geared and trained specifically for Relic Site scanning, didn't do anything else. Again, around 4hrs a day but active play. This was in \~2012. Made probably 7bn. Price dependant and really heavily reliant on shipping to highsec. This could be seen as grinding, but I never lost anything and relaxed a fair deal listening to music etc. 
---
3. Went to Guristas nullsec and learnt how to farm paticular complexes. This made a substantial amount of money, around 50bn, in 2 months. Again roughly 4hrs a day, but all of it active. Definitely grindy, but an astonishing amount of money that was very scaleable. If someone had 6 accounts in certain areas of Branch, you could probably made 3-4bn average an hour with zero PvE risk. \~2013
---
4. Years ago when SOE probes were first released I was one of the first missioners to farm them, and I was very efficient. They were contract-only items so the price didn't normalise under market conditions, I was making 25,000 ISK per LP. This enabled me to make enough money, thanks to the contract system, to control the price. They were listed regionally so people outside the area couldn't buy them. I'd buy any that fell below my threshold value and relist them to sustain my value. Due to their small size I interceptor shuttles lots of them to other hubs to repeat this process at higher prices, where they could not be farmed because there was only one level 4 Sisters of Eve agent anywhere in highsec (Osmon, 6j from Jita) at the time. This was a process that lasted a few months and I made 30-40bn. \~2008? 2009? 
---
5. Bought loads of Battlecruiser BPO's at NPC prices when they announced that the price was increasing. Very easy and simple. "This BPO is currently 350m. They are going to become 550m". Why not drop 90bn on them? Learning note: Make sure you buy the popular ones more and then less popular ones less... I still have ferox BPO's somewhere :( 
---
I've done a few other things which I won't be able to disclose, which I fear is the barrier you'll come up against - anyone with an amazing current process to make wealth won't tell you. I also realise 4 and 5 aren't current, but there is potential for future things like this. Patch speculation can be useful but I've never really "speculated". If they outright state "X is going to be harder to acquire" or "X is going to be more valuable" it's worth putting some money into it, and I don't regard that to be speculation. Just make sure you buy a volume that can be dumped again, make sure your information is accurate. Speculation is people guessing about components of future items and hoping they got it right, and I never bothered with any of that.
---
My advice to "get wealthy" is to do similar to what I did above - pivot from one thing to another. None of it felt like a grind because I changed so much. And, sometimes, you'll find through the many experimentations something phenomenally profitable, which you'll push until it stops. Some friends did that and then faded away - they put all their eggs into this basket. Instead, I went back to doing something else until I found the next profitable thing. 
---
I ended up making handmade sculptures of the ships from Eve after all of the above, so I really definitely did try out many things. 
---
Plus the people you'll meet along the way - those are the most valuable things I ever got out of Eve. 
---
I wouldn't publicly post about the size of your mouse.
---
TIL at 2 minutes per mission, 3000 missions per month is 8 hours per day. Might want to check your math big guy.
---
The great portion of players should have probably voted then. 
---
You know how long it has been since activity tracker was released, then you can do the math
---
or do they not teach math in russia, only rmt?
---
It is very sad to be stupid eu retard like you, gl next)
---
Press F to any offensive dreadbomb
---
I like to watch Delonewolf on YouTube... good guy. Look into Providence and the Sev3rance Alliance.  Un4seen Development. Great group.
---
Are you seriously asking that pressing f1 then leaving the computer for half an hour is interesting PVP combat?
---
Dont price with BPCs, price the actual ship. The cost to build each ship is like 400k or something? maybe a mil or two?
---
that's even less than on grindr 0/10 not worth my time
---
Wow. We asked for something and actually got it. =)
---
I'm from america lol
---
Doesn't matter, same lame
---
Hmm, seems Jita local spilled over into RL again.
---
I have a selfie with you . so I'm ok. thx for all you've done 
---
You can warp at 0 on a gate and it will land you in jump range you don't need gate bookmarks.
---
So otherwise your existing null experience can probably get you back to hisec. Keep in mind it's still possible to land outside of dock range of stations without insta dock bookmarks. 
---
The only other consideration is that old player capturable stations are now something called citadels. Citadels are CCPs long promised proper player owned stations with proper station services docking and everything. In low and nullsec they can fit weapons so you should probably steer clear of them until you know more.
---
There are multiple Android options which seemed to be giving me the info being requested on my old Alphas. That said, I don't have a screenshot because I biomassed them all. Side note: These were the first characters I've ever actually biomassed and WOW turn down your speakers first! ;)
---
Reduce the time is fine, but they should also reduce the LPs. 
---
works neatly!
---
That would require her to do the same action more than once. I’m pretty sure that’s very unlikely.
---
Warp (bubble) to the dance floor (literally, ouch)
---
One of my favorites.  Sad days but I know our "online universe" full of some of the best friends we could imagine making in a virtual world, wishes you the very best in your future! Fly crazy sir!  o7
---
Well I agree with you. Sometimes not doing things the optimal way can be fun. I hope it works out for you! :) 
---
Eve is truly dead then

If only they would stick to their own code.
---
It takes literally 2 seconds to refit mjds on a nestor. I would hit site align to home hole and open refit menu. Each nestor pushed roughly 1150 dps with perfect skills iirc. And almost never had issues with tank. Then again this was years ago so i dont remember everything.
---
will give pic of tits and vagene for isk
---
Agree with you, sex is useless
---
Oh boy, I made a map to the Labyrinth, you can get the key from the museum in the next zone over.
---
Have you tried Cialis?
---
I’ll look into it

&lt;/3

I will not allow the CSM to be disbanded. I will suffer no foolishness from people who can't be asked to vote. 
---
Isk sinks are good 
---
Why do you feel that’s important to tell me. I dgaf 
---
the CSM is a joke, if they took it seriously it wouldnt be.  easier to just throw it out. 
---
Why do you care what someone else is doing or how they play? (Sorry if I offended you, but that's the typical response I get from everyone... so I thought I'd share what I've learned.)
---
Pain in the ass to build 250 since you can only queue one per slot.
---
No, how many iskie's is it?
---
Correct. 
---
Something tells me you have never been to deltole... 
---
who needs an EVE dating site when r/evejobs exists tho
---
Get better at the meta. 
---
How much I got 50 isk
---
150% extra so 2,5 times base value. so to hit 3k i'd have to start at 1200 dps. 
---
that would require a dedicated dps fit though. 
---
If the rorq was instead 4 rr bhallgorns wwyd?
---
But ganking their miners was?
---
Yes good idea. Centralize it all so us pirates have a real system to fight for bedesides Rancer,Tama and Frul
---
This guy fucks
---
(himself)
---
Can make 100 mil an hour if you're focused AND get good spawns with a carrier, and it's a constant effort thing. More so than most activities ive engaged in in this game. Most folks cant do it for more than a couple of hours as tedium takes its toll. Tell me what's wrong with this?
---
Poi Boy is elite pvp boys Be scared of the Poi   
---
Not if your 200 skill farm alts are injected with mass production :smart:
---
ok enjoy living in a third world country
---
5.
---
Holy shit there's a girl in that crowd. I wonder how much they paid her...
---
you mean the cyno that brought the rorq that no one else used?
---
Agreed
---
Right click ship. Show info.
---
That will show you what bonuses 8t gets from the racial ship skills.
---
As an American who love watching 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, this made me lol
---
2 different (sets of) bonuses, 5 tiers for each racial skill
---
Well if you think the thoughts and feelings of r/eve to guide all future eve developments would be good for the game, I have some news for you.
---
The CSM doesn't work how most people think, people take there ideas to csm reps who try to decipher wtf the guy is actually trying to suggest, and objectively work out if its a good practical idea or not. 
---
The good ideas get passed on.
---
what normal happens how ever is CSM gets some news about this new feature x, the csm tells them there straight up thoughts feelings tells them this idea is bad or there's huge flaws in x, and CCP takes the comments into consideration, then more or releases the feature anyway, with or with out the changes.
---
If the CSM worked how most non voters actually think it worked, then the game would probably be in a much better space than it is now.
---
He is quitting in days. 
---
 Deal.    ( . Y . ) tits only for 50 isk.
---
because nda's cover most interaction of ccp &gt; csm. apart from the meeting minutes that are released and the participation metrics that ccp was keeping of people making meetings. 
---
This is crap
---
;)
---
*BUT EVE IS DYEING!!!!!!!!111112*
---
Study this 
---
Can we pay in ISK?
---
dude you cant live in Iceland and work part time for 28k a year with out needing a second job.
---
Is Really funny mate because its soo true :) shame its so difficult these days to get 1v1s but hey ho
---
You're not crying... I'm crying!
---
L3L
---
You say that like it wouldn't be straight up better? Blops can actually have normal subcap counterplay and you could maybe get a decent fight out of it even if they bring 2-3x your numbers. With supers/carriers + faxes its just over when they load grid.
---
This is just cloaked whine.  A well fit battleship is all but immune to a well fit frigate, unless the BS is passive tanked.
---
I'm not looking to farm easy kills though, I'm looking for a response. I don't want NS bears to have no good/strong options to respond with, I just want something where some things might die on both sides and skill/preparedness will matter. 
---
Seems like you never were in ru, but I was in us, same shit bro. Both are 3d worlds.
---
I think we can all agree that these elitist .01%er's harm the game 
---
What the fuck are you talking about? We're talking about caps vs subcaps, not subcaps on subcaps.
---
hi virgin
---
I know highsec corps are looked down upon but you could always just leave horde for one if you think that would fit your playstyle better. Just make sure they're not wardecable if you decide to go that route
---
Can we please get u/Stainguy on the csm before they kill it off I would just love having him there plaguing them in person about his gate
---
Right in the PCU around 2014.
---
I mean you're complaining about the WHers fighting a cap that can tank 6 dreads in horde space and somehow they're the pussies for leaving because...they didn't lose a ship? Like what is your point? They should have waited until horde was back from their strat op and fed? 9/10 this rorq lights a cyno and the one time it doesn't were supposed to shit on the guys who killed it because they didn't lose anything?
---
Urgaypwned. That is also a statement of fact. Prove me wrong
---
Maybe the new 64 bit client will also have settings for people running on a screen larger than 800x600. 
---
Send Olmeca or Marshy for Investigations!
---
I just don't get where they made money here, if they recieved plex, unless they were then reselling the plex via RMT. seems dodgy.
---
In hindsight they should have just stayed with the 'donate isk to get credit' method, though they probably still would have been banned in the gambling armageddon.
---
Roaming was always like this.  
---
Drop into a null pocket full of krabs, get their attention by catching a few, and then shoot whatever kitchen sink fleet pours out of the station.  
---
Cyno domis and rapiers dropping nyxes on your three nano drakes was happening in 2010. 
---
For someone who haven't played Eve Online yet, is the game newbie friendly or will I have a hard time catching up? 
---
Ship's sinking faaaaaaaaaaaaaast
---
Its not a sink though.
---
Loool
