We're working on it. Will post the new update along with the ability to walk around in stations.

That’s awesome I am glad to hear it!! It’s such a great PvE experience and I don’t get bored or sick of it!
---
A 10-man AF gang can break a super before help arrives (WITHOUT a cyno)? That wasn't my experience with wolfpacks.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I get that 3 ships is the very small side of a wolfpack. But 20-30+ ships that can kill a titan or a rorq is more of a small fleet than a wolfpack, imo. Maybe it's just my personal experience. Where I lived in null, we tended to fly out in frigs and dessies in order to cover ground; we couldn't really rock BSs or even cruisers, and more than 12-15 people would mean someone would go out of their way to form for us or drop on us, etc.
---
Your hulk is definitely in more danger in highsec.  Agree 100%.  I'd argue the nerf to Rorqs is the more appropriate response, but you're not wrong to point out that disparity.

An individual Eve instance won't benefit from more cores. And it doesn't need a high clock-speed on in the first place. 
---
Honestly, just grab a Ryzen 7 3700x. It's plenty fast enough. The money you save can be spent on a faster graphics card, more beer, or more Plex. The only thing you need to be careful of is motherboard. Go out of your way to find one that has good power distribution. Minimum of 12 phase (12 unpaired phases) if you intend on maintaining a high CPU load.

It needs far fewer people than you'd think in order to turn a profit.

There’s an in game channel called “Abyssal Lurkers” that is open to anyone. The purpose of it is a place to talk about anything and everything Abyssal related, and it also has fits saved as well as links to additional fits in the MOTD that you can browse. Hopefully you find it useful!

Got "blobbed" for the first time in my eve career on sunday and it felt kinda crummy NGL.

Went on a suicide cap roam through brave then test space, thought Test was going to form in dreads and we were going to have a brawl [then they dropped supers &amp; titans at 150 and we all died.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003108/201909160300/o/%7B%22A%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22B%22%3A%5B%221900696668%22%5D%7D/)

Wrecking ball was Broken AF

but I remember the days when the "elite" statment was true from the reciving end of nc/pl
---
when most alliances could only do T1 ships with the rare t2  
---
while ncpl had t3 fleets as mainline, with sleps for special occasions
---
You act as if any time we get into any conflict PL/NC/Horde aren't going to show up.
---
Remember when TEST alone (not Legacy) staged out of MTO to hit GotG without any supers?  Yeah, PL and Horde showed up with supers to defend.
---
You can't give us any shit after that.
---
so blueballs or hyperdunks are actually considered a tactic of encouraging PvP these days?

The funny thing about you among all these smoothbrains is that you actually seem to believe the garbage you post.

As is the cyberpunk aesthetic, which is not the same as classic sci-fi (thinking Asimov or Star Trek as an example), although most recent sfi-fi borrows it a lot as an aesthetic for some groups. Like EVE does.
---
using the word cuck in 2k19. ok, no one can take you serious after that.

They got their medal. Nothing left to fight for, I fell so far I ended up in TEST.

[a news organization told him that it's okay to be a cuck](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/health/cuckolding-sex-kerner/index.html), so now he can start calling other people cucks
---
Grath, login. USTZ needs you. I might add badly but I do not think that would be nice.
---
r/evejobs is also open if you'd like to post there directly to recruiters
---
So with that, it is more effective (cost effective?) to skill for T2 Logi cruiser and maximize efficiency on that, and then eventually skill for FAX if you're either that special snowflake picked for fleet or you have good chance of being one?
---
As a side question, in regard to "support roles" in EVE, I'm guessing that if someone wants to perform as a support (typical healing/buffing/debuffing etc etc role, other than main damage dealing), there are 2 main ones? Logi and EWAR. And logis are better pick I assume?
---
That's what makes Goons and PL different from TEST. They both went for top spot and got it while TEST has been seeking a participation medal.
---
I think eventually its really down to the testicular fortitude of the leadership. TEST has always been about running their cringe victim complex narrative for the past few years. 
---
Even today if you ask a regular TEST line member, they will tell you how PL invaded Vale and kicked em out even tho that never occurred and it was TEST that chose to enter a conflict with PL actually.
---
youre so right bee man john guess its time for you to stop posting and never come back

We need sov changes.... 
---
I think sov should be constellation based with a "push and pull" over it's systems to declare the sov owner. When the same winner is declared in all the systems, that alliance needs to drop a keepstar and declare a home base. Sov is then directly connected to that keepstar.  All systems must be leveled up to a specific index before any new sov can be acquired. Sov can only be acquired in an adjacent constellation linked to their current sov.  Each new constellation must have a keepstar to lock in sov. And finally, alliances can ONLY hold sov in ONE region. So the max any alliance can own is a full region of space. 
---
1. sub-cap fights for the "push and pull" warfare of each system
---
2. capital fights to take down the structures.
---
I'll leave it to CCP to iron out the details. I'd also limit 1 jump bridge per constellation and only connecting another constellations with your own sov. No more friendly bridge connections. You can use friendly bridges, but friendly connections are not allowed.
---
We need to also find ways to minimize the blue neighbors as well as structure spam. Oh, and lose system local for constellation local.
---
Extra cores can help with things like mumble, web browsers etc. but honestly, the load is not very great.

---
This is troll sov. C9N bridge down for 23 hours is far more relevant. 
---
Without Blackout TEST will easily steamroll everything and push Ferra back into NPC stations. Essentially nothing to see here - move along.
---
the actual common knowledge truth is very few of the paper pushers in big alliances are actually worthwhile leaders at all  
---
  
---
hardly any of them lead fleets, they shit on people rising through the ranks by doing so, they are *constantly* looking for people to awox on the very accusation of being even acquainted with the enemy or even *considering* leaving the alliance.  
---
so why do people follow them  
---
because they roleplay "important figures in an important alliance"  
---
half the fucking people in these giant corps are so unbearable its insane. imagine all the roaches left from the dozens of unremarkable corpses of corporations long past pushed into one giant shitpile  
---
few of them have personalities, let alone any positive qualities at all they literally follow people who just tell them they're leaders simply because they want to operate in the safety of a super umbrella and are willing to take orders from mouthbreathing pseudointellectual  ultra boomers in order to do it
---
there are exceptions - guys like zungen and kendarr are the reason alliances like gsf arent even more of an absolute travesty than they already are and quite frankly i have no idea what keeps them so embedded in a waist deep flood of retards at all times
---
This post, and the artists that clapped for it like chattering chimps, is **the reason** they need to just pull the plug. That way, everyone that can adapt will adapt and everyone that can't can just die already.
---
Pop back in, find Spectre Fleet. Go from there. No recruitement. Find your own groove.
---
Whose was better? PL or GOONs?
---
Or don't do that and play how you want.

I think they did this with "The Agency". It's probably the best you're going to get with such a complicated game.

I've killed so many of you if youre in goon it's not funny

---
Surprising? No.  Hypocritical? Yes.
---
HTFU.
---
So TEST is a tier 2 also ran but also solely responsible for blue donut eve? That seems like two claims that would be at odds.
---
Show me all the times horde and NC. have shown up lmao can probably count on 3 fingers.
---
They bring twice as many supers and alpha them both.  The number of supers in this game is too damn high
---
Stuff exploding = not stagnant. Glassing = not stagnant. Abandoned whole regions due to war = not stagnant.
---
And removing a bug is always a good thing.
---
Until 2nd tier Goons leadership shut em up live on twitch lol.
---
I miss propaganda posts. Bring back propaganda posts and keep this cringy shit in your forums.
---
Wtf is predds?
---
I prefer to think like the left side
---
A solid target priority and kiting specific enemies keeps you alive better than an awesome resist profile and tank. Learn to fly around, avoiding barriers in Level 1s. Learn about target priorities in level 2. Level 3 and above, kill neuts and webs fast, and move on to the other annoyances from there.  
---
If it's big, and already has damage, chances are it can rep itself if you leave it alone too long. Killing a full-health battleship when you're supposed to be fighting a half health one sucks.  
---
Most important: In higher abyssals, you may end up in a murder room. The murder room is a boatload of Leshaks and a gate that is a straight up exit gate. Don't try to win... you probably won't. Run for that gate and leave.
---
I guess I'm confused why you think this would aid the umbrella?  Instead of a cloaked recon ship which is hard to figure out if it is there t1 cruisers can't warped cloak so if you can watch whatever the target is as it moves sites then the t1 ship would have to uncloak.  Or if they aren't sitting on grid then you can see them in warp on dscan.  Overall I think it would be sort of a change more sided to the attackers but I'd be open to hearing why I'm wrong lol.
---
ITT Retard slapfight
---
The rats already jam, web, and ewar you. The problem with anoms is not the anom, it's the local. NOT having local would force the player to be more active. It's as simple as having constellation local instead of system local. Do that, and then increase the bounties and rewards from anoms and it'll be a fair trade for risk vs rewards. Belt rats will warp out as well. I've been shooting 1.5mil rats and they just leave. Also, using warp jams and webs really dictates your damage range, in solo pvp you're most often fighting with a range setup while in fleet pvp you have others doing the point/web and others doing the dps. Not all pvp ships have point/web, and those that do suffer mid-slot tanks in fitting, so it's also a trade off. 
---
I think trying to balance a pve/pvp fit is the wrong move. We'd all just have this one universal fit for everything then... not fun.
---
Bottom line, you saw how the community reacted when players were "forced" to be more active while ratting in a blackout. I can pretty much predict the same reaction if they needed to "pvp" vs npc ships.
---
hate the game, not the players
---
The blackout introduced randomness. You getting tackled wasnt based on you doing anything wrong, it was based on the random aspect of somebody being in your system. Thats one of the reasons its so hated. I dont like how its now either tho. There should be a delay because that atleast gives both sides a decent chance of using their personal knowledge.
---
That I agree on. But I cant tell you how many times Ive seen small gang go for big stuff. Its just a nuisance cause if you give them long enough they can most def kill them. And the issue is also that you dont know before hand.
---
noone has really done anything in this game in the past 3 years and pvp is pretty much dead. if you want to try FW there are basically 2 hubs left where people run endless circles around 4-5 systems. otherwise dead. just like the rest of the game.
---
Which is btw pretty much what trig invasions are
---
Updoot. I snickered.
---
well you know he cant bite the hand that feeds him lol
---
this sub is dumb
---
Logi on Killmails when?????
---
this sub is a meme.
---
Drone auto aggression is fine as long as it makes less isk than an active ratting fit.
---
At the moment, this is true because of carriers etc. Multiboxing a bunch of afk ships still puts something on field. It becomes an issue only when a player who actively does PvE can't compete.
---
well kendarr did leave goons so...
---
Losers are gonna Reeeeeeee. Sandbox irony.
---
If they take our surrender terms, they're not really our enemies anymore.  And we're not offering blue.
---
I can agree with your point to a certain degree. Like I agree on everything up to the ganking part. Thing is, lets say you are unsure of the game. Its complicated, you dont get the rules, everything is hardcore since you have to make isk, you dont understand the clusterfuck that is skills and so on.
---
And all of the sudden you get ganked in your first ship. Maybe without even having made enough to buy another ship. Or your second ship, or your third. A new player doesnt understand they can literally lose everything they have. The odds of someone doing it all over again (the first 50 hours) is in my opinion very low. Because they will most likely not understand why it happened which means there is no way that investment will be worth it.
---
And reputation matters. One customer that doesnt like your product will perhaps tell ten others (in the social media era, thousands) to stay away. Thats the issue games with griefing always have, its not new or in any way just linked to Eve. Griefing imo just highlights the massive knowledge gap between a newer player and and older one, thats the issue. It just tells you that the game isnt worth it.
---
Now this is the part Im saying is impossible to quantify. How would you calculate how many never even tried to your game or tried it and said, na I wont risk investing tons of hours in a game where I can get fked because someone else was bored. Its impossible to make that calculation.
---
&gt; despite never invading
---
Why should legacy take more space?  What do we get out of it?  What incentives does the game give us to take more space than we can actually occupy?  As it is, the current meta of warfare, keep grinding away until the other side gets sick and tired of it and quits, isn't healthy, especially since there is no real reason to actually commit to a fight.
---
Not at odds at all, You can't be tier 1 if your goal is to suck up to that right instead of aspiring to be one.
---
Regional local may be better, simply for the fact that I would dock up whether I saw a red in system local or constellation local. I think most people would do the same. The more I think about it, the more I'm torn on what to do. System local is so comforting to me. I jump in, I can see who's there. Simple. I think one of the best options I've heard was to have local populate after you decloak from your jump. This gives hunters a chance to scan down targets before they are seen, but also gives anyone in system the opportunity to make a quick decision. Plus, any intel in adjacent systems should be enough warning.
---
What's the point of having a shitty job you pay for if it doesn't come with shitty bosses?

So you just admitted it is you guys killing EVE!! FINALLY, acceptance is the first step
---
The blackout failed not because of what the hunters COULD do, but because of what the system dwellers WOULD NOT do. There's a big difference. I think local is here to stay, but I think you should only show in local after you decloak from your jump.
---
I just want to log in at those spare moments when I'm not doing other life shit and be able to have fun and shoot shit with people I haven't met yet, why is this so hard?
---
Also, props to Initiative Associates for coming out to play in good faith when I go solo roaming in T1s.  The frigates and destroyers makes up for the Loki.  Goons see a Stabber and suddenly I have multiple Sabres and kitey shit on my ass.
---
Then why are you here whining about "blue donuts"?
---
Unblue goons if u want some ustz content 🤷
---
So many butthurt people in here. A friendly offer is put out there to atleast allow an exit for the ones without it and you all pretend this is about more blues. Im fairly certain those talks arent conducted over reddit. But I guess this is more of the wonderful "hate blocs" crap.
---
In this game*
---
There isn't actually anything to fight over, so all fights are retard slap fights.
---
So when you say "you can run the site in a frigate" what you really mean is "you can run the site in a fleet of 3 frigates"...
---
To be fair, timezones dude.
---
They literally dread bomb us constantly, the 2 titans that died in Impass happened because goons dropped and Frat took the opportunity and fucked our day up. So we do get USTZ content but with the way the alliances are made up, the timezones for battles sucks for everyone.
---
Welcome to this sub:)
---
nobody here is whining dip shit
---
Ignore Reddit. That's what you need to do.
---
Why are you bashing china tz detorid structures instead of ustz delve structures?
---
Because we’re at war with Fraternity...?
---
Thanks! i'll be doing more.
---
Sooo... what it is now? Just with extra steps...
---
Take your pick of any 80 goon corps
---
Uh blocs are killing the game with their stagnation. Uh blocs are fighting too much. Uh blocs are killing the smaller actors in NS. Uh blocs are trying to give smaller actors choices to ensure they survive.
---
I mean at this point I have no idea how to make these bitches happy.
---
Lol The truth is goons knew they wouldn’t get any fights “ glassing” tribute and etc. It was just another avenue to try and pretend they are the biggest and best.
---
I am dead curious why haven’t test and goons went for the new holdings that They have? 
---
Let’s have a war already mittani
---
elo knight has to keep bullying test now
---
But you're complaining they're in the wrong timezone? Why are you at war with someone in the opposite timezone? I understand you hate the Chinese but come on mate.
---
im already looking forward to the excuses nullbears will come up with to not fight each other if CCP ever actually manages to fix their shit.
---
I never said they were in the WRONG timezone, I just said the timezone sucks for everyone involved. I never said I hated the Chinese, what in the name of god are you on about?
---
fuckin slam.

Welcome to Denny's, that's a Grand Slam! He owes you $6.95, plus tax, PLUS tip.

Thank you guys for being easy to rep (and taking damage so we have something to do). 
---
Remember, dont broadcast for bomb damage unless you are below 50% and Scimis dont have cap transfers. Fuckers:)
---
and yet, its the only one you have.
---
So you're saying it sucks to fight someone in the opposite timezone... But you refuse to fight anyone in the same timezone? You might as well admit you hate the Chinese already pal...
---
Uh what is that lol
---
Than
---
I don't know how you expect to be good at this game if all you do is show up once a month to respond as one of a million F1 ping warriors.
---
If you don't have the dedication to be halfway decent at this game, I don't know why you play it.  You're bad and should feel bad about it.
---
Alternatively,   
---
Yeah, I mean it's great that you can spend every night on EVE to keep your elite spaceship guild of 100 people afloat.  Unlike you, I have a life outside of internet spaceships and can't just log on every time someone hits my fortizar.
---
True, and Tapi still calls goons even when its Frats weakest timezones lmao
---
I switched to the 32 bit client, downsized to a smaller window, and now have no problems.
---
I don’t hate the Chinese what the fuck are you on about? We fight goons pretty regularly. And speaking for me and me only, I hate sov warefare,  Its tedious and boring. Even during USTZ that shit fucking sucks. Chill out and take a breath
---
well yeah, you're here :gottem:
---
no, he's trying to get another buffer zone so that instead of 3 regions to get to the closest sov null hostile, it becomes at least 4
---
So you hate PVP 🤔🤔🤔
---
I have some highsec I can rent you.
---
Can even operate on a no Chinese policy for you
---
Bill, you have a bad attitude. Its been stated by someone. You should take this time to change your behaviour and not have opinions. Thank you, come again:)
---
:munch:
---
Ahh thanks. I was getting worried there for a bit. You wrote multiple positive posts, and even 1 neutral these past days. Thought something had happened.
---
&gt;we will treat you much the same as we would Providence
---
So you'll show up to defend their shit as if they were blue, but only after looting all of their faction fortizars?
---
sure, you dont have to embrace them for them to be true.
---
Are you not listening, or do you have terrible reading comprehension? Do you need a friend? Maybe just a hug?
---
i feel like theres a part of it though, that they just assume "this is what leadership and fleets are like in eve" but after awhile i honestly would just get sick of it
---
   
---
honestly if ur reading this and youve never been in these big alliances or had a spy i highly encourage you to get one and just go in mumble on a fleet and listen to how retarded people are  
---
like an hour formup for an uncontested entosis fleet  
---
spam pinging "GUARANTEED KILLS" for a final astrahus timer for some no name alliance  
---
an fc holding a "fun roam" that refuses to undock without 50/50 logi/dps  
---
hearing the same dude, been in game for a month every single fleet going FC CAN I BRING A DRAKE LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO except not ironically  he actually thinks this shit is  funny  
---
after undocking for the next 45 minutes hearing some random  eastern euro bust into comms and scream HAVE WE LEFT YET (2 hours after formup)  
---
people actually looking forward to the fireside chat LMAO  
---
smugging at literally any perceived opportunity, even when clearly losing and humiliated in every way  
---
someone constantly tackled 4 jumps back (doesnt hold mic button down long enough so you only get half his frantic cries for help)(your entire fleet burns back to help  but hes already dead when the first people jump in and he was actually in a 1m atron)  
---
fc took you through a wormhole but doesnt know how mass works so now you have to burn your 500m cruiser 30 jumps at 1 in the fucking morning and you ahve work the next day so you just warp off to a safe and self destruct
---
like spectre fleet is re tarded but its  actually sort of fun. i dont understand how people can be in a big alliance, watch as the actually  talented and motivated fcs are  chased off by paper pushers, and still claim they're having fun putting in 5+ hours a day of hard ratting or multibox rorq mining and its all just to go on a fleet thats factually worse than a random retarded npsi fleet run by a 2 week old maller pilot out of jita
---
Blue me like one of your ~~French~~ Russian girls...
---
Grath. You had a very large hand in making the current political meta of Eve the way it is. Stop whinging about people getting friends. This is the house you built brother.
---
You can solo them
---
i choose to hate them both and ccp too
---
Fucking hell, This thread must be the biggest fleet PL has formed in over a year.
---
It's easy to maintain a relatively lean alliance when you stick all your money making Alts in renters corps. You know better than to make that dumb argument.

How did you manage to miss the point when you posted the original comic?

I play with my dad right now and although it’s painful at times it’s pretty rewarding. The biggest issue is the steep learning curve of eve. We all take it for granted as we are pc gamer generation but the old arcade guy have a bit of trouble wrapping their head around having to pay attention to so much detail.

For once I actually agree with you. Except that capitals 100% should not be able to fit cynos

&gt; If they are mining outside direct staging jump range, mining with a bad fit, or mining without recon alt, my alliance is shooting them  
---
&gt; Supercarrier ratters without dedicated force recon and fax alts are literally the cancer that is killing your large alliance/coalition. They will be required to be ratting in jump range of alliance and home defense umbrella staging. Supers who are out in space ratting in alliances right now that have these policies are getting shot publicly in a feelgood fun way.  
---
now that sounds like a strong case for scarcity
---
Because I'm on medication after surgery and reading is hard.
---
My bad.
---
You are correct, sir. Either we have the risk (a blackout) where less people play, less targets, but you have a higher chance at engagements... or we live in an Ice Cream and Puppy Dog world (full system local) where more people play, but fights are easily avoidable. 
---
I don't know what to tell you. Players did this to themselves. Waves of blue after blue system dwellers holding hands in unity as far as the eye can see. And if you happed to get a wormhole to an enemy, they just dock up and wait until they have a bigger fleet. 
---
Interesting times we're in.

Im trying to play this game but i dont know what to do. Im so lost

Shoutout to Pirat for setting up this shot momentarily before getting vaporized.
---
Join a corp, find people that know what they're doing. play the tutorial missions, find something you want to do / would enjoy doing, go from there
---
You seem to not understand that removing another independent bloc will only exacerbate the problem further but that's cool, play the fool, it works well for you
---
I think you have missed the part that where people have shown up for fights for a very long time. And Im fairly certain goons show up so they can continue their war with Panfam. But Panfam doesnt seem to want to help FRT anymore. Hmm..
---
Oh no! Those bad people having fun playing a videogame! It's amazing that they don't see how fun EVE Ville is and there shoot OUR spaceships! The nerve!
---
I hope people that read this finally come to their senses and realize what kind of game people like you have created.
---
I'm not into racists sorry

I'd love to bring back some memes but my mom says I can't shitpost after 8PM :(

Then why u be like this...

How much time until you raise their taxes?

It's been put off until after the module teiricide is finished

Ok

I enjoy the princess bride reference, when there is talk of a reboot.
---
They seem to generate their own predator-prey population cycle.  Prey populations rapidly increase. This is followed by an increase in the predator population: As predators eat the prey, their population goes down because there is less to eat and the predator population also goes down. With fewer predators, the prey population can increase again—the cycle repeats.
---
Name the groups that you fought where you didn’t have a 200+ supercap advantage.
---
They just hate us because they can't be us
---
We're far past exacerbating problems in this game and it's cute you think an independent block will help prevent issues.
---
Small alliances of winter co., all you must do is follow Vily's example, get on your knees, and suck dick for standings.
---
They could always *reject* blue standing offers and stay red?... It takes two to ~~tango~~ blue up.
---
&gt;making the current political meta of Eve the way it is.
---
and how did he do that?
---
Can’t really encourage PVP with new players because they’re so far behind on SPs compared to people that have been doing PVP for a while. Massive disadvantage.
---
PVE, exploration, mining, production, and PI are a lot easier to skill into for new players because you aren’t losing anything (sans PVE to an extent) for not having max skills. You’re just simply not earning as much as someone else doing a similar task.
---
&gt; Im fairly certain goons show up so they can continue their war with Panfam
---
Thats an odd assumption to make since its a war with Frat? and Tapi ask goons for help?
---
Maybe engage your brain a little more.
---
It's a way to be a very small cog in a very large machine. I'd recommend against it, personally.
---
The thing to understand about mining and industry is that it's one area where you can't do much as an Alpha pilot.
---
Mining... don't even bother as an alpha. You're limited to *the* smallest mining ship, and the income is peanuts compared to literally anything else you can do in the game. Unless you like mining for the fun of it, in which case go for it but you don't want anything to do with an organized indy corp. You'd have nothing to offer them and they'd have fairly little to offer you. You'd want a social corp that does regular mining ops, maybe... there might be some overlap? Let's just say I'm skeptical.
---
For industry, you can make T1 things as an alpha, but with the exception of rigs and a few select modules this is unlikely to be profitable for you. There are some possibilities here. Just think about what kind of industry you want to be a part of. Do you want to be the one supplying some small group with hulls and modules in the far reaches of space? You probably can't do that as an Alpha because you'd need to contract out all your hauling and there goes your profit margins. Do you want to work in highsec, finding a niche for yourself making (pick a few rigs to start with)? This is definitely viable, but a corp won't help you. Do you want to be part of a virtual assembly line? An indy corp helps here, but as an Alpha newbie you will need to convince them that you're going to stick around long enough to be worth training up. Possible, but worth starting to think about now.
---
I'm ace so fuck off pls
---
I have no idea what that is
---
By being a leader in PL when they were stomping on any group that they could beat.

I'll need to work on my sense of humor. 😆
---
Is Vily actually Gevlon Goblin or whatever that autists name was?
---
I enjoyed flying logi.  I still remember how much fun it was flying a solo Simi in a small gang.  We had a wonderful small gang battle, a little outnumbered.  I was so busy keeping range and swapping targets it was crazy.   I even got a thumbs up in local from the red gang FC.  One of the fights I still remember clearly after a few years.
---
They're not actually fighting over anything but ego. Resources are effectively unlimited. No one needs to remove others from their space, or even have as much as they do honestly. It's just easier to be "rah rah" and rally the troops if you tell them someone is the bad guy. It's mostly over boredom.
---
I mean, Eve kind of is a geopolitical simulator. It's just one where all the countries have chicken-hearted leaders, who can afford to avoid risks some of the rules that apply in real life (like resource scarcity) don't exist in the game
---
Identify correctly the scenarios when test calls goon. Test calls goons a. In China tz and b. When frat calls nc.,pl, and horde in other tzs
---
I really don't think it will, I think it would certainly be cheaper but about the same amount.  But we'll never know I guess.
---
Leshak can pump out 2704 dps according to a quick pyfa fit. Using your drones to harrass his and you shouldnt have a problem dealing that kind of dps. Add in 4 medium neuts (medium for fitting purposes), and it would be rather rough for him to survive
---
It's the blops sig for TEST.
---
I’m just looking into jump freighters now as a newish player. Roughly how much does it cost to deploy / light a Cyno and roughly how much does it cost to use fuel to jump through it.  I realize this varies, but just fuzzy ballpark assuming average skills is fine :) in just worried jump freighter use would eat half my hauling profits :)
---
Also, do I need to use an omega alt + force recon ship to light the Cyno? Or is there some exceptions for jump freighters ?  Sorry I realize this is slightly off topic
---
https://i.imgur.com/RinRrlc.png justice served on that goofball
---
Just like Frat gameplay, even translation is being botted.
---
cost wasnt really the issie, work was
---
Fuck off racist
---
You could retitle this "Eve Interactions in 2003 - 2019"
---
There are a lot of things this game can tech you that I think for most are just lessons that pass right over their heads.
---
For example:
---
* No matter if you prefer Trump or AOC, your opponents probably see your guy (or girl) as crazy as you do their's.
---
* If you're American you see yourself as the torchlight of humanity and yours is the only correct way of light. The Chinese probably see their system as the only correct way and themselves as the torchlight of humanity.
---
* etc. You get the idea.
---
I oversimplify, but people as usually so blind to themselves and seeing the world from a perspective different to their own.

Lol anyone with one functioning brain hemisphere can recognizes you as a tard
---
They're neutral right now
---
I'm  sorry he said smaller, you're waging an entirely different argument, to which i'll reply "everybody in PL bought their own super, nobody funded shit, so its not our fault our members were willing to pay and everybody else is full of cheap ass fucks who wouldn't do anything without a handout."
---
TIKLE rebellion when
---
So many, for sure. I don't think we want to go around and kill all the structures. Maybe whoever lives there next will? Not sure.
---
You might be right about the whining part, but I do see someone being a dipshit. It isn't the guy you're addressing
---
Snigg was never asked or required to keep its money making alts in any other alliance and all my money making has always been done by the corp im in.  
---
Oh wait, you're stupid enough to believe that myth right? Lol, god damn wanna buy a bridge?

Only retards have that word as part of their vocabulary

Welcome to eve?

PL is here to madpost for them.
---
Sell your narrative to those who don't know better.
---
&gt;  He was a cuck when he was in Goons, he's a cuck now
---
Scientific research has shown that that word being part of someone's vocubulary is an infallible indicator of their being a retard
---
Flower, enjoyed that. Sorry about the blob. Would love to 1v1 sometime here in the future :)
---
K. You can at any time stop pretending you weren't senior PL leadership for many years.
---
Well there lies the problem. Resources need to fluctuate, deplete, and grow. Regions need to have high value areas that move over time. The map needs to have sec changes, stargate route changes, planets and moons should die, new celestials should spawn, new regions should form.
---
&gt;This is the best I can come up with... [http://coalitionsin.space/](http://coalitionsin.space/) as to who's friends with who, BUT among all those coalitions are there any that are also friends?
---
 
---
all of them
---
&gt;Can someone explain who is fighting who and why?
---
nobody is fighting noone.
---
 I'm just trying to see the big picture here and really derive what kind of content the players are putting themselves in?
---
farming anonalies until they get bored and quit
---
Coming back from negative sec is easy.
---
It just takes isk.
---
i mean, if you never interact with him, as there really a difference?
---
\&gt; anyone who's actually done it knows how wrong this is. 
---
Anyone who knows the game mechanics would know how  wrong it is to claim ganking has a counterplay. The potential target can add tank, to avoid being a target. Or they could have a logi or tornado alt in space with them at all times serving no purpose but to attack gankers that attack them, thereby ensuring no gankers will attack in the first place.
---
Those are the two options and both involve not having a fight, rather than having the ganker attack and be countered by gameplay. If there is nothing you can do in the game to fight back against a particular entity that is free to engage you, there is no counterplay.
---
You had me for a bit and then you went full retard
---
when what makes a game bearable is doing things to distract yourself from the game, flags should be raised.
---
&gt;At the end of the fleet the FC should genuinely thank people for attending, making people feel valued and part of a community is essential to keep people coming back.
---
is this a troll
---
please tell me im getting memed on
---
They briefly lost in there with WWB, but then everyone gave up too early and now they’re stronger than ever.
---
All that DX9 content being updated looks like they are focused on debugging the mobile version visuals.
---
Might as well do nothing about it then, huh?
---
Yeah I don't know much about the history I've spent most of my time in eve in high sec or roaming as an explorer.
---
The PL super fleet back in its heyday only existed because of mass EULA violating activities that were tacitly encouraged by the alliance and the corps.
---
I play in +9 and it's still pretty busy.
---
I find it Ironic that there are people from Pandemic Legion in these comments Reeeeing about breaking groups away from fallen adversaries and "killing the game"... The very same Pandemic Legion that destroyed the largest Newbie Alliance in Eve Online's History and poached their membership to create Pandemic Horde. The very same Pandemic Legion that worked with the likes of Play Hard Pray Harder and skill urself to orchestrate the destruction of countless groups in ways that forced people out of the game.
---
Pandemic Legion through their actions when they had supercapital dominance is responsible for the current state of nullsec. Their reckless over-farming and wanton use of supercapitals originally meant to stifle competition ironically forced smaller groups to coalesce into the coalitions we see today just to survive; and just 2 years after they themselves participated in the mega-coalition that failed to destroy goons (again in an ironic twist allowing Goons to become even stronger than they were before), another mega-coalition formed for them. 
---
Pandemic Legion has reaped what they've sown.
---
Great shot.... makes you really set back and admire the beauty of the game. Now we just need some ship wrecks to complete it.
---
not being a F1 pushing content leech would probably be a good start.
---
ITT: PL leadership that basically live on Twitter after getting shit on by this exact same kind of cringe are reminiscing about how dangerous Brave was and how evenly matched that conflict was and are currently falling over themselves to make fun of the people that are still allowed to play the game.
---
Are you reposting a screenshot of a meme from less than a day ago, because it says 666 upvotes? I remember being 14.
---
Yeah... EVE being the thing that gets you your "dream job" and it's a customer service rep is kinda shooting low.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
That's pretty rich coming from an alliance of krabs and bandwagoners for whom Koolaid is a dietary staple
---
Yeah there are plenty of options I run a more serious eve corp based off majority PVP ops in null but I can recommend you to some more casual outfits for pew if you're interested.
---
Remove logi. Stupid idea to begin with and all it does is make the blob more likely to not suffer even one loss.
---
I'd love a Mtu that pulls in 3 or 4 wrecks at once, slowly, with one beam starting with furthest out wreck. Like a multipleMTU.
---
Salvager drone 2, that either microwarps like a light combat drone for travelling, or has two salvage beams for two targets, or has ability to retrieve crates, or has a tractor beam, or has better controls like 'one drone to each wreck' or a heavy dorne that drags wrecks to you, or like... something better version 2
---
Thanks
---
Numbers alone are meaningless; the multi-year meta dictates that the ability to escalate trumps all other considerations.  The core issue is risk aversion, and TEST has clearly been taking steps to mitigate their risk.  But my point is, so have you.  In fact, I can’t fathom a more risk averse playstyle than predominantly dunking on newbro alliances while poaching their members every time one skills into a titan.
---
The fact that you're coming here and trying to take it seriously enough to get your memes here....you might want to step back for a moment and realise what game this is about.  EVE isn't just about flying ships around, there's also a shit load of subterfuge and spy networking that's supposedly happening.  Nobody really knows if it's true, and nobody can know until something big enough happens to out the spy.  Propaganda and such are very real parts of trying to sway public opinion about the big corps.
---
If you don't want to see that, stop coming to this subreddit.  This subreddit is nothing buy people jerking off all over each other and then rubbing it in the others face that they came more than the other guy did.  It's all bull shit and is absolutely pointless, but people on the internet that think they're important want to dick wave when their e-peen is the size of the Empire State building.  Nobody actually gives a fuck, but it's something to appease the masses and gives a place for people that are part of those big corps to come and shit post in.
---
I mean...do you not realise that this entire subreddit is nothing but a giant shit post?  Don't believe me, ask Jib.
---
The day when EVE fan Reddit has better communication than EVE's own game studio
---
i mean even if that were true it would make no difference, pve alts dont pvp.
---
I have some good ideas... much better than the picture you painted.
---
Black Legion. (at times)
---
You don´t lose any security rating if you join FW unless you agress/kill non FW targets.
---
Original Poster btw
---
Disregard politics, live in jspace.
---
But they do inflate alliance numbers overall and make it seem like they have more dudes than in reality.
---
I've seen your posting, it's shit
---
or what powers u gonna awox me
---
You just apologized so honestly I think youre bullshitting us, you obviously dont play Eve.
---
If you want to know more about politics, especially in null, I think you should watch Jin'taan's video on it. It can provide you with information about who is fight who, and who is living where, but getting informations about why, and so, well if requires much deeper dig. Reading posts, searching up history, and tweets sometimes. Very often it's impossible to get pure version of the story, because very often it's actors have only limited knowledge on what's really going on on the other site. Also, propaganda often distorts people's view on some events.
---
Overall, fully understanding politics in Eve is rather rather big accomplishment, and I don't think many people can say that they understand it fully, and losts understand it to much lesser degree than they think they do.
---
Jin'taan's video - https://youtu.be/EZ454wywtQA
---
Funny how less than a week following the end of the blackout the nullfags are looking to secure even less risk to themselves.
---
CCP has no balls. But hey guess its best to actually kill a game, so you can keep the lights on and have "a game".
---
Says the guy with 1500 less karma than me and twice as old. Heh. Go away.

---
The lore I know points to them being organic, but with a twist: from their perspective, each individual is made of 3 people (some version of body/mind/spirit that I did not quite understand from the Trig loremaster Uriel). If I remember correctly you can see in the descriptions that the trig ships are meant to be piloted by a number of pilots who are a multiple of 3, but we only recovered one pilot per Damavik we recovered. Hence the 3 in 1 thing.
---
Or something like that. You should probably ask Uriel on twitter for his full essay on the topic.
---

---
Thanks, I'll check it out.

Nobody wants war. 
---
They want their big blue donut so they can RMT in peace.

Hippity Hoppoty, I'm gonna make them go Poppoty.
---
Holy shit. He unironically used karma as a measuring stick. Lmao
---
Mmh yeah, me thinks trig NPC dreads, and soon after they become player trig dreads
---
Yea... you're getting blocked, troll. Thanks for having nothing relevant to say. Haha.
---
Whats that got to do with anything at all?  Keep going, take this somewhere, because, and this is important, PL is a dictatorship, always has been, always will be.
---
How much coke does Vily do Grath? More now or less now that he has left goons?  Just asking for a friend.
---
yea, it is.
---
This, this exactly.
---
War or skirmishes?  You obviously weren’t farming one another, so was it just incidental contact, or were you fighting for nomad supremacy?
---
since you dont use that word whats your excuse for being a retard?
---
Lol.
---
So is this the next "benevolent"  think of the little guy spin? Got the Blackout revoked, now gotta get that Umbrella back up eh.
---
Fucking nullfags posing as "combat guys". 
---
I can't rat in my carrier because of local.
---
Now I can't rat in my Super, Titan because of Cynos.
---
Seriously fuck off.  To paraphrase a legendary EVE comment.
---
You are literally the cancer that is tearing this game apart.
---
Holy shit, I think you need to get medicated.
---
EVE attracts people who read the stories that took place years ago.  If they came to Hilmar's bungled "Hellscape" of today they'd demand their money back.
---
The people that ruined EVE were Hi Sec assholes that whined like a 6 year old bitch with a skinned knee when they got ganked, or when someone looted their jet can.  Wormholers, who live in near unevictable space unless you completely fuck up, bitching that Hi, Low and Null need to be nerfed despite never playing there.  But most of all Hilmar, the inbred viking dolt that listened to all of them and turned EVE from a sandbox MMO into a WOW like amusement park.
---
You're missing an apostrophe
---
So dumb you had to post twice?
---
Not real.  Just out there reaching for shit now are we?
---
No it isn't
---
The umbrella never went away and it definitely shit on people trying to farm. The umbrella is just adjusting to the new cyno meta with less chaos until variables can be reintroduced with the basics in place. You seem unnecessarily upset about people wanting to learn and solidify the new pvp meta.
---
your posting is cancer btw.
---
im touching myself
---
username fits
---
I like that you've built this lie up in your head that PL only ever fought newbro alliances because they picked on BRAVE twice.  Nevermind all the other alliances we kicked the shit out of. 
---
Also we never headhunted anybody, they came to us, mostly because the alliances they were part of were disorganized shit shows.  Notice how Goons never really had a heavy bleed of super/titan pilots to PL?
---
So CCP has to actually not do stupid shit for this to last more than 5 years.  You might chortle at such a proclamation but look upon the Ozymandias like works of Hiltard and weep.
---
That's a weird attack.  It's one of the easiest ways to keep the peace in a marriage, and keep the bathroom clean.
---
Judging from his latest public statements its gotta be more.
---
People actually fly logi. Most other ewars are really hard to scale up with fleet size.
---
As for fax, in null they're quite frequent at large cap fights. But start by skilling T2 logis. If you're in a big sov null block, you'll probably want a ratting carrier and that will get most  of the skills for the fax taken care of.
---
PVP my ass. 
---
All you Nullfags care about is ticks for your RMT sideshows.
---
no
---
no to all of this
---
fucking no
---
What groups smaller than themselves did they stomp on?
---
What a goof
---
Its Powers we all know he is just a mouth piece. There isn't any possible way in hell he could come up with this shit on his own bud.
---
I campaigned against neutral logi long before this current round of wardec "fixes". It was the single greatest contributor to the problems wardecs presented.
---
I also advocated substantially raising the price for large groups to dec small groups, which would have made the big alliances sink substantially more isk into every "maybe" wardec.
---
One other thing I wanted was to penalize corp hopping during war, to prevent people jumping corp to get into a war only when targets were on grid.
---
See, I was one of those one-man wardec corps. I also spent time in Marmite. I knew all the tricks. Hell, I helped invent a few of them and have the history of GM warnings to show for it when we pushed the envelope too hard. CCP *could* have made highsec a much more interesting place and made wars far more useful and relevant...instead they simply took the nerfbat to them and listened to the risk-averse with their krab mentality.
---
I've only been saying this stuff since about 2013. We knew back then that this future was inevitable.
---
Fuck, having to updoot you. THIS IS BULLSHIT! :P
---
Welcome, my friend :)
---
I would be ok with seasonal/special event sins being in the plex store on a Rotational roster, for things like Xmas skins, valentine skins,  summer/winter skins and such.

To be honest, what you listed at end of paragraph was utter shit. He and I don't get along at all, but fir once I have to agree with his assessment. You are an idiot.

Hey man, just wanted to remind you that nobody gives a shit you fat retard lmao

Live in LS or WH space and fight who ever the fuck you want.

There ya go.

Please show me all the instances that NC. and Horde have come down, I bet you can count them on a hand with only 3 fingers.

theres just too many minerals and too many citadels, the flow of titans will never stop until this is resolved

Grr gewns
---
So then in reality it changes nothing? Cool
---
more blue balls then ever, less content now then in the last 12 months and Hilmeth is currently in the middle of a bipolar episode where he randomly comes up with bad ideas for the game that he implements as fast as possible regardless of feedback.
---
&gt; LORDE
---
You're right. They don't need to bot. They just use Evertrader's wife's credit card...
---
Many, many reason. Pl/bl were sacred enemies for many years.
---
Age is but a number, unless it is less than 18, then fuck no.
---
This should be bumped so hard
---
This was meant to specifically address your point about the alliance not being involved and everyone buying their own. I obviously can't prove shit I don't have access to CCPs data. But I do know quite a few people in PL who did that and was on comms with PL in b-r and heard quite a few people say shit about losing other peoples titans. Pretty easy to see what corp the dude was in and see that it didn't match up.
---
How long do you really think you'll last without PL, Horde, NC, Snuffed and every alliance Noraus can pay off with RMT isk to come to Frat's rescue? I want an honest answer. Because this ended so well last year in UALX, so you thought you'd just try again?
---
Any new players want to fly a tackle merlin in small gang just LMK ! first week players can still serve a roll in engagements in small gangs outside of the big empires
---
I love this pic
---
So uhh just out of curiosity is it the right thing to do now that you're on the team doing it? If so, pot meet kettle I guess.
---
For context I couldn't actually care less, I just want to fight people. Politics can suck a massive dick.
---
Null blocs provide fun and engaging gameplay for its ~~members~~ renters
---
Doombunny I knew you were dumb but come on man follow along. I'll explain it to you. PL was able to claim they fought alliances outnumbered because PL kept their Krab Alts elsewhere. Simple enough for you?
---
Ok name one since you were there.  You *can* name one right since you were on our comms during the fight.  
---
Also since you were on comms during the fight, who was the Titan that skated out of bubbles and warped away?  Everybody there remembers.
---
he's missing a brain.
---
&gt;really think you'll last without PL, Horde, NC, Snuffed
---
Please show me all times NC. and Horde have come down? I mean no other alliance would have had to come down if Tapi didnt call for Goons help even when they already out number Frat. Lmao
---
Exploration is what made the game great for me. Watching a 30 minute video and buying a cheap frigate to dive through wormholes in was all it really took!
---
I'm curious... if you and that nutjob think the game is so boring (like the lame ass picture he painted of lazy system dwellers doing nothing) then why are you playing? Also, any fool can slam someone else's ideas, but if you got nothing better to suggest then you're just as much of an idiot as you claim I am. What's the problem of having to move around to keep gaining the most? Nothing in Eve is forever. Are you that lazy you can't move your PI if a few planets in a region die every 6 months? Are you that stuck in your region that you can't deal with gate changes to keep things interesting? Are you that boring that you wouldn't like a new region every year expanding systems and gameplay? 
---
I mean... sure, you can slam what I said... but you are yourself a dumbass.
---
Those numbers dont matter when fighting you fucking retard.  Thats what my point is. Follow along please.

I agree, the anti-capital tackle ship not being able to light a cyno seems very strange, especially since lighting a cyno means you can not receive incoming reps from anyone.
---
No, you can run them solo if you want, but you can have a maximum of 3 frigates run them. People run T1-T2 electricals(?) solo in Retributions all the time, same with darks and Hawks. I personally run T5's in Hawks either trippleboxing or with friends
---
~~Gamers~~ Eve players: Grrr remove politics from my video game message board
---
Also Eve players: When can we get more Cymek drawings?
---
A cyno should be around 1.5m. Liquid ozone is like 250k? One junp should be in the ballpark of 50m? Check Dotlan's jump planner for your route and multiply the fuel amount with the fuel price.
---
The fuck is wrong with orange? Back in my day, every ship was either green, gold, blue, or rust
---
So one person with one Hawk can run them? (legit asking, I've never tried the abyssals)
---
(also- are you Gandhi?)
---
I don't remember the Titan that got out. Probably was during dinner for me. A lady named Palli in BDCI was controlling multiple titans that weren't hers during the fight. You'll deny it, but that's expected. None of us can prove shit, but I know better and so do you.
---
That's exactly the point and it just went over your head like I'd expect.
---
skiffs these days give actual value in ganking them. It is procurers you want. First few times ganking them is fun. Fun stops when they committed enough isk to buy supers. And the gank starts to hurt when they reach fully fit titan levels. Procurers switch the gank dynamic to the miner getting enjoyment watch those dumb fucks piss away isk ganking them. Even better if the procurer miners supply the ships to gankers.
---
Letting them die quietly is giving the *bad guys* content, encouraging them to come back. Must blueball or helldunk so *bad guys* stay away and don't interupt the MER! By having fun you're actively hurting the alliance.
---
Agreed. Bring back the sniper battleship meta: two fleets showing up at range and just pummeling each other. It was fun for everyone.
---
Eve dead
---
What's ur PL toon named friend?
---
I’m curious to know what this breaks
---
No it shouldn't, because its wrong. The biggest drive in pushing people together was a net safety for Rorquals. Period.
---
Holy trolls. LOL. Keep up the great ideas. I'd be down for all.of them. Reddit is full of shitty scumlords that think they're idea of the game is what we all do. Cheers mate.
---
Good for YOU snowflake
---
I \*was\* wondering who had gotten themselves CONCORDOKKENed.
---
FUCK GUARDS I FLY ROKHS MOTHERFUCKER
---
I don't have the inclination to pull up every Fortizar lossmail by Winter Co., all lost unironically in your CN timezone. Please drop more in 46DP and bring your northern pals again and again.
---
Given the context combined with his handle... I'm thinking his normal is not our normal
---
They \*have\* been making something big in Abyssal Deadspace. Hopefully this is something they'll use to shake up the null blocs or actually pick fights with other NPC factions. Invasion fleet vs Incursion fleet when?
---
Haven't had one since 2015.
---
ok
---
Bots aren't players.
---
&gt; "this one cool trick eve developers HATE that will make eve playable again."
---
catch this upvote
---
Can't wait for the follow-up Post about emptying the Corp Pension Fund and driving away in a lorry full of milk and cheese.
---
Actually BDCI has historically always had something called the Flight Deck, this has been known since time began, the ships are corp owned and the pilots swap around, so I'm not denying it, I'm just telling you that you misunderstand the situation.  
---
Also lol, going after an ex CCP developer (the CEO of BDCI is an ex CCP dev) and accusing him of breaking the EULA is hilarious.  Keep going.
---
poxes flyin about
---
Sadly I am but a man of my word
---
One can dream tho
---
For the game to survive, the big coalitions need to fall.
---
Do a basic search for it.
---
Thought that was just the world ark.
---
*Detorid
---
And without Goons you would have lost the war before you started. Imagine being in the Second biggest coalition and needing the help of the biggest coalition to beat a coalition half your side lmao.
---
Every time a big coalition fell, another one took its place. There’s been two big loosely aligned mega coalitions against each other throughout most of Eve’s history, it’s just UALX and X-47 made the lines extremely obvious
---
What about 2010m
---
I'm aware. There needs to be an incentive for them to fight.
---
God you fucking tryhard neckbeard go back to your cave
---
Jesus fucking christ
---
No they don’t
---
AUTZ take over of eve when?
---
God your dumb.
---
yo sobad want some popcorn
---
Actually, Elo started it by breaking the NIP. But don't let facts get in your way. Also, one Goon sig (Reavers) bothers you guys a lot, apparently? How many alliances are here fighting for you? Have some balls and use those caps, supers and titans you mined up in 6 months of peace before Elo broke the NIP on yet another cocaine-induced manic high. Or tell your northern pals to gas up that super fleet and we can have a repeat of UALX.
---
Brave &amp; TEST (Catch/HERO 1.0), Goons (World War Bee), Brave, then TEST (Vale), then TEST while defending GotG at MTO, then they came for Brave &amp; TEST again and failed (staged out of Jamunda and 0-SHT).  Then came at Legacy through Provi and failed.  Then [came at Legacy hosted by Frat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/440463351047258114/465515624727183361/Discord_2018-07-08_16-52-35.png) which ended in UALX.
---
People indied to build ships to pvp/curiosity like your whole arguement falls apart
---
You mean like there was in X-47?
---
I dont care about killing single ratting vnis
---
How are hisec gankers and wormholers "niche gameplay going against the spirit of how the sandbox was setup"?
---
Grrrrr lefties.
---
Yes, but I'm also correct.
---
"Here are my suggestions on how to fix Eve that are basically what the other guy posted but worded differently"
---
Imagine thinking CCP will do any of it either lmao
---
Keep bat phoning for help all you need, its clear Tapi hasn't been able to stand on their own two feed since fountain. You would think a coalition of 38000 people would easily be able to fight a coalition of 18000 people without having to ask a coalition of 45000 people for help.
---
But it makes sense because any timer Tapi tries to contest on their own they lose, no wonder they just keep blueing more and more people.
---
ya people in this thread dont realize i dont care about ganking a single vni. Thats not pvp in my opinion but i enjoyed fighting the sub cap(sometimes cap not overwhelming) fleets that would respond that would cause you to either Nano fight it ping and try get more dudes forming in the back ground to create a fight. Now null sec there is no way to force a fight. Crabs instant escalation is 2 faxes and like 6 supers. Citadels and other changes have deleted anyway force any sort of quality content.
---
He said smaller you dumbass
---
PL attacked brave 6 years ago! That’s why we have to blue everyone in the game and blob frat with goon help!
---
If being correct makes you stupidly wrong, then sure mate. Whatever.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
I think this sub needs more videos.
---
That's the dumbest shit I've read all day. And I read a bbtb post. Feel free to enlighten me, what is there to fight over, exactly?
---
Lol sure
---
Spooky!    
---
    
---
If you threw in a graph of something inconclusive, would be a perfect prediction of the future.
---
You can't even kill a couple of TEST Astras in your own staging left there for months, let alone win a war by yourself. The funny part, is PanFam is going to hang you out to dry and slowly bleed pilots off Winter Co. like they've done with every ally they've ever had.
---
This would only work if you either gave an undock invul timer to ships from citadels, or removed the "if pointed can't dock" aspect of a citadel.
---
Otherwise people would never be able to safely undock from a citadel, because you can't tell from the inside of it if it is low power or not, and when you'd undock, you'd be instantly targetable and scrammed.
---
&gt;let alone win a war by yourself
---
Lmao things Tapi says.
---
Just... Watch out for the cold water
---
Yes, one person can run a site solo in a Hawk, they just need to create a fleet with themselves and activate 3 of the same filaments.
---
I don't misunderstand anything. I know what happened and I know what I'm doing. Wouldn't be the first time a dev looked the other way.
---
Is this world ark scaffolding? Or the dread/pos stick thing?
---
386k
---
There's a suggestion thread for dumb shit like I assume this is.
---
Memes are literally banned, that’s what happens when you have shitty mods
---
I said smaller you goof, sorry that your N+1 blob couldnt win, get your victim complex sorted.
---
If Elo asks nice, maybe Origin. can jump ship to NC or PL before shit gets even more real.
---
386,404.02 m3 with max skills and three ORE expanders.
---
That log clearly shows you warp disrupting the tornado before the gate guns start shooting. What flags or timers did the tornado have before you pointed him?
---
This is actually quite accurate for the current era bois
---
grrr purple hat purples
---
I like how you're ignoring supers vs no supers.
---
You're cowards who refused to go after the largest entity in the game, and now you're complaining that the largest entity got more powerful.
---
Get fucked.
---
For me Vily offer looks like a Gobbins and his invension to Branch "You guys good but you need change the side and work together when you want to save your place". Maybe im wrong but sound is same, sound and tactic... This trick show two things - 1)  confidence in victory  or 2) absolute / partial uncertainty about victory .  Ok maybe...time is show,  we will see at the end.
---
A human can wave back in local!
---
I’m in that tz most of my online time. About 6pm Perth time every night. Lots to do. Jump in hit me up
---
I'll have you know we've been playing since the early days where you could roam with a battleship and feel \*good\* about the state of the game. If you don't like how it's turned out you can see me in court--texas law backs up our position and we know ya'll use VPNS which is ILLEGAL and you will be BANNED according to the law
---
I can't quite put my finger on why that might be
---
"six years ago I lost in a video game and I'm still crying about it today"
---
i was the second tornado not tarrant
---
Let me get this straight... you basically shit on the game and it's players, while someone replies with ideas to improve it based on YOUR very own analysis and you turn into Mr. Dick McAsshole. Way to go bro... major applause there.
---
Im sure if Vily asks super nice, goons will make sure Tapi stays nice and safe.
---
ITT Retard slapfest
---
&gt;all the member assets and jump clones that will die...
---
Whose complaining? lmao its the way the game goes. 
---
It looks like Tapi has to sign as many agreements as possible with all the entities in the game including the largest and most powerful  just to feel safe. 
---
What a meme
---
Anyone still got any extra keys? :)
---
I approve of this post--all along we were playing eve for the kids
---
Eve is great if you're good
---
haha
---
I'm sure if you keep batphoning PanFam.
---
Spicy popcorn, sounds good. Yes pls
---
Pester Fawlty to do it. 
---
  Daily.
---
See how can I pester Fawlty if I’m too busy being the voice of dissent in legacy.
---
There’s only so many hours in a day
---
I ask again, show me all the times Horde and NC. have come down lmao the only reason PL ever came down was because Tapi was already outnumbering Frat and were stilling crying to papi goons for help.
---
Tapis victim complex is some wild stuff.
---
Faction gun has longer range then tec2 :)

I wasnt using frentix

:D
---
Beginner are coming to null-sec. The universe is welcoming new spaceship pilots.
---
No they didnt stop trying to be smart
---
You had so many chances to create the environment you wanted.
---
And you actively fucked them all.  Now you're whining that your dumbass decisions have put you in a bad situation.  Idiots.
---
Not really because BS are so painfully slow to get into warp and warp, other than the Mach.
---
 Oh once in your life you find someone. Who will turn your world around. Bring you up when you're feeling down.
---
No dipshit, what I did was explain the state of the ganem again, tell me, what are you fighting for/over?
---
Waves are for pubbies arr!
---
I think that it shows how badly broken the eve culture/player base is, that the only way we can get fights is by introducing npcs that wont care about losses.
---
&gt;You had so many chances to create the environment you wanted.
---
No one wanted that environment lmao who wants to krab up all day and do nothing
---
Once again no ones whining, we are laughing at Tapis victim complex and that they need help from the biggest coalition in the game to beat a coalition half their size, its comical.
---
&gt; Once again no ones whining
---
Bullshit.  You're trying to win the narrative on Reddit because you can't win in game.
---
I bet you're one of those idiots who thought HK and PL were one and the same.
---
3, 2, 1, I HAVE 61 TEXAS LAWYERS WITH THE FULL MICROSOFT ARSENAL AT THEIR COMMAND, I WILL LITIGATE YOU INTO SUBMISSION AT 17KM. FUCK YOU.
---
No pve event can really shake up nullsec. You make us old grumpy bastards only a bit more grumpy for some time.
---
Yeah that ever important reddit narrative lmao what are you talking about?
---
Maybe you should batphone goonies and they will protect your reddit narrative as well.
---
A dinobrain isn't better than no brain.
---
Frat whining about batphones ... what year is this? Talk about victim complexes. Christ. Expect we'll see, all of NC, Horde, PL, Tri, Snuffed, VINDI, Slyce and even some of Frats botting alliances in 03- after what we did there today. I can't wait for the tidi, lagfests, wbu?
---
There is no offer tho? What's the damn offer
---
No point NOW... This phase goes offline in like 24 hours.
---
Rip
---
In general, the coalitions on the west side of the map are opposed to the ones on the east. Most of the fighting is between Legacy and Winter, with Pandemic Legion having deployed southward to back up the Chinese.
---
And Providence does its own thing. Nothing that they do really matters unless you're going into that region for some reason or another. WTB 10 Jin'taan's Frozen Corpse.
---
This is a massive oversimplification.
---
Doesn't really help that there's no point to all of it. Why bother spending time grinding structures and slogging through system after system if you're only going to get more of what you already have.
---
Im running a 7700k, and it does run the 16 clients

Now... tell me again, Mr. Dick McAsshole, enlighten us how you would change the state of the game?
---
You know, I've always wondered what it would be like to go through life hating everyone but yourself.
---
You, my good sir, have been insightful.
---
Did you just copy paste a marketing ad? Lmao you fucking moron. WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING OVER? SHOULE BE EASY TO ANSWER RIGHT?
---
"Everyone I don't like is playing the game wrong"
---
You fight over whatever the hell you want, mate. That's the game. Are you seriously that fucking stupid? Let's hear your great solution to the "so-called" boredom we are facing right now. I'll wait... should be an easy answer right? LOL
---
So nothing, just like I said. Awesome defense ya fuckin idiot. There's tons of threads floating around with good suggestions, feel free to read any, I suggest Angry Mustache's.
---
The thing is that caps are made for cyno, like gating/warping caps into combat would not work.
---
Im sure when the second biggest coalition in the game needs the help of the biggest coalition of the game to fight a coalition half its size, the smaller side would be dumb not to get some help?
---
Are you seriously whining that frat are going to try even the numbers? Its wild how the Tapi victim complex works lmao
---
what was it in 2015?
---
How is nothing that same as anything you want? LMFAO... you are a hoot. I guess I won't be hearing any solutions from you, Mr. Dick McAsshole. Just leave the game already. You're a joke.

If Hilmar had deliberately set out to rip a player base apart, he could not done any better than he has done so already.

I never said none of it matters. It all matters... that's the point. You make it matter to YOU.

And... I want to hear YOUR suggestions.... please... pretty please! You're so wise.

Imagine using updoots as a dick measuring contest

Kendarr left and made trigger happy, lots of people followed him and they are now in Tribute

Oh, and don't forget to call Siberian Squads again. If Noraus asks now, maybe even Ranger Regiment will move down for you.
---
You newbros are so fuckin cute sometimes
---
I see. thanks
---
Are you seriously upset that Frat are going to have to ask people for help to even the numbers since Tapi need goon help to win?
---
Eve portal 2019
---
Are you seriously going to sit here and continue to lie through your teeth about PanFam holding your hands this entire war?
---
Im so confused what sort of narrative that is meant to be? What are you even trying to say?
---
Red ist faster
---
I'll take your lack of response to mean you don't have a fucking clue and you're just a trolling tool. Back to my first post... GOD YOU'RE DUMB. Wow, we've come full circle.
---
You're such a perfect fit for Tri.
---
I'm trying to say, Brave could beat FRT solo (in your timezone) if you didn't call PanFam to carry your water in every fight.
---
You're a perfect fit for Fortnite.
---
Its just that you cant start doing PvP without having a good backbone of isk. Eve is full loot and you lose everything you carry when you die. New players most likely would instantly walk away from the game if they get exposed to PvP too early. They first need to be able to replace what they lose. 
---
Skillpoints also need to be learned first.
---
You shouldn't accuse a dev of cheating if you can't prove it, they've banned people for less, and yea, you are misunderstanding, Supers and Titans in BDCI aren't owned the way you think they are owned.
---
So are you saying that Tapi is worse than brave? Lmao what a goof.
---
Tapi couldn't even fight Frat on their own in any timezone.
---
This shot is amazing! Simple yet elegant.
---
It's a sad time for eve when players feel they need to spend more time on reddit then enjoying the game.
---
Keep the hate for yourself and just play the game. There are far more worse things in the world going on then who gives a shit about people battling it out. 
---
People who spit the most hate need the most help. It's not vily's fault
---
&gt;Tapi couldn't even fight Frat on their own in any timezone.
---
Keep telling yourself that as you sit in that RF'd Keepstar, in your staging system where the ihub was RF'd as you sat there and did nothing. Without PanFam, you're just RMT, botting trash.
---
EVE Portal 2019

You blob frat in Eutz where its 3am in China where you get Goons and all of Legacy to form almost 600 people?

What a wild ride your brain must be on, dont hurt yourself on that spin.
---
How can you prove things like that? Ban me CCP ban me and prove me right.
---
Drifters...?
---
Shakeup?
---
Hating the enemy to get people to log in and fight them turned into hate everyone so you don’t have to log in.

Dinobrain much

Well when someone says I shit post, doesn't an upvote prove otherwise? Besides, I know I have a bigger dick.

If he doesn't warp off he's a dumb bot. If he warps off he's got superhuman reactions hence bot.

Thanks, i appreciate it

Smaller where it matters(super fleet)?.. everyone you ever fought?
---
Swiggity swoogity, the gatecamper's alt is coming back for the lootgity
---
If Winter Co. can't defend its space (in any timezone) against 600 pilots, you don't deserve that space. Period. Use your supers and titans (for once) or just move to your retirement plot in Oasa and Perrigen Falls under PanFams supercap umbrella. You might want to drop some ihubs in all that sov up there. I have a feeling you'll need it soon.
---
You can, but generally low/null hunters have limited resources and bringing in dps after landing tackle tends to have a very small window of time for success.
---
Also, if the HIC dies, the recon can't hold the super, whereas before you could just bring two HICs.
---
I'm not saying this in of itself justifies a change, but I do think in general HICs should be able to cyno.
---
&gt; against 600 pilots 
---
Lmao the tapi brain
---
I've said it before, but unfueled citadels after xxx days, offer no tether and are killable on first RF, no timers. Citadel spam solved.
---
Wew lad
---
That's not really an issue with the playerbase, though. You can have the most enthusiastic, active PvPers ever for your playerbase but they're eventually going to get bored and stagnate if none of their PvP actually means or does anything. Even the people most enthusiastic for midnight structure bashes eventually get tired of grinding them out over and over again for absolutely no gain whatsoever.
---
I thought CCP fixed sun bouncing some months ago.

this is predds :P

lol what game have you been playing. It sure ain't eve
---
Oh right I didn’t have any idea they had something like that. Shame about the name though.
---
a player posted a joke in the name of a dev on this forum and they banned him.
---
while i wouldn't personally report you, other people on here are pretty fucking petty and as somebody who's managed to be an asshole in eve for 13 years I'm just quietly suggesting you be careful with throwing things like that around as they tend to shoot first and then let you work it out in petitions.
---
That guy never got unbanned btw, they're vindictive.
---
fair
---
Aww, aren't you cute trying so hard.  Still not the argument he was making.
---
Aruba recently did a updated tutorial series, I think it has prone scanning in it
---
I'm not worried. Thank you for your concern.
---
They also forgot 2007 through 2003
---
 I do not recognise the the tepid achievements of the subhuman baboons known as brave nor do I follow or give credit to Test or Goon pets.
---
It's not that CCP doesn't know they need to fix their shit. 
---
# It's that CCP doesn't know how to fix their shit.
---
A dumb as balls idea like not logging in doesn't help in the slightest. 
---
TLDR: Your idea is stupid, and won't help at all.
---
their skill-less n+1 approach/our brilliant battlefield saturation strategy
---
It’s fking brainlet mods dude. They just ban all memes
---
How about removing Standings entirely from the game? I mean, the most salt in r/eve is about "everyone is blue to everyone", so why not remove the "blueing" entirely?
---
"You're not playing the game MY way so fuck you"
---
Where's my pitchfork.
---
Fairly new to the game so this is just out of curiosity but where did you read that gate guns don’t shoot at you for just having negative standings?
---
I'll never understand renters.  I mean, I guess you don't look a gift horse in the mouth, but...  why?

Neocom II is very good.
---
If logi assist counted on killmails then you would probably see a lot more people doing it (I need kills to get access to the good stuff  &gt;.&lt;)
---
Grow the fuck up or get the fuck out. No one likes the kind of person you’re setting yourself out to be and you’ll quickly get a lot of hatred if you keep it up. Be mature, be a fucking adult and have thoughtful discussion instead of this pointless dick measuring contest using fake online shit-points to feed your superiority complex. No one cares.
---
This is pretty cringey...
---
You oversimplify so much that it should be a crime.  You deserve every one of those downvotes and more.
---
You're like the news organizations that give equal time to climate change and climate change deniers.
---
Don’t let tackle yourself ? To the guillotine !
---
This will always be a hated truth that nobody cares to hear
---
For if you believe you are the torchlight, the notion that the other side could ever be naught but darkness is folly
---
Age of Reposts
---
The issue is you wind up pvping structures only.  
---
Either they fight you with overwhelming force or dock and leave because there’s no cost in doing so compared to fighting
---
It’s killed the game for people to be so risk averse, we need more zap brannigans
---
You obviously took the time to care. Don't I have the right to defend myself against some trolling limp dick asshole? Why don't you stfu and mind your own business? Stepping in here like you're a big shot swinging your own dick around. Talk about a superiority complex. Y'all just a bunch of sorry ass mother fuckers who got nothing better to do than piss on someone else's words. Go fuck yourself.
---
btw,  have I been the only one whom the "end" of WWB reminded about a few thousand horror-movies? "Yeah, we hit the bad serial-killer with a tennis-ball. He is dead, I m sure. Lets go fuck in that damp basement here..."
---
Then you are making a weak argument. Because that's what made you win every time.. *outnumbered*.
---
They already have an undock timer just like any other structure. Ever notice how  when a sip undocks, it doesn't immediately tether?
---
my alts that are -10 security do not get shot by the gateguns if i dont shoot annythign faction police will
---
The dudes who made the actual good memes kind of quit the game. F
---
CHAOS!!!
---
New meta, bots wave any time someone new enters local.
---
Same shit every year! But it was funny!
---
gateguns also lock faster than faction police dont mes with them :p

I think it is more about showing the middle finger to all hunters or proving something to CCP.

* now people are angry that they enforced this policy and there is not much to hunt                    
---
* damn yesterday even posted reminder about nerfing the rorqual mining , super ratting and overall faucet balance and mostly got down votes.

Thinking like this is part of what got WoW into the shitty state it is in right now. Everything is so easy and convenient that you don't even have to play the game.
---
cant code porperly
---
Sorry if you need to bring 2 things to do 1 job ... then something is wrong with the balance.          
---
Hic get 2-3x more EHP than recon so probably it is much harder cyno.
---
Like hics are one of the most interesting ships ingame due to limitations and what they can perform.
---
&gt;Also we never headhunted anybody, they came to us, mostly because the alliances they were part of were disorganized shit shows.
---
You can't rewrite history no matter how hard you try Grath. PL fed on its weakest allies like a vampire for years and still does. Their logo is truly fitting for an alliance with such a sycophantic personality. I have no doubt that they'll suck off Frat's talent as they move under PanFams supercap umbrella to RMT in peace in Oasa and Perrigen Falls. And yes, to use your words, Frat is a 'disorganized shitshow', too.
---
No, needs AB and bling and dumb super pilot that don't have webbing fighters.              
---
HIC job is to tackle capitals on grid so it should get cyno.          
---
Like you will not take a hic on subcap fight as it is to slow and just prefer the light dictor.              
---
But you will take it when going against capitals and supers , as while dictors will initially tackle enemy supers, the hictors will hold them in place
---
one thing to bear in mind, take info from multi sides into account to rule our bias view (deliberate or otherwise)  
---
eg; in that video he doesn't point out that goons, test and GOTG were in the same sphere of influence during the time that occured
---
You're suggesting the feeding was intentional, nobody ever reached out to one of the people that joined, they just hung around, saw how we did things, and decided they're rather be a part of that.
---
Thats not feeding off of, thats simply existing in a more appealing manner.
---
Incorrect again, but i expect nothing less from you after all these years.
---
FYI,we're deployed so NSI isn't our staging :)   
---
if you want fights, best to head towards Horde controlled areas
---
If we have inhibitor and cyno and both negate each other. Why not just remove cyno and inhibitor and make all ship jump / bridge to sun in specific system or random into specific constellation.       
---
This will be fun.

I love my logi bro, and i never rep for bomb damage..

Providence when you went after their outposts.  Provi versus PL wasn't fair but when you weren't making enough progress you called in NC.
---
Can you light a covert cyno in High Sec?  
---
I understand you cannot do it with a standard or freighter one was just curious.
---
Shield hics are soft, but if you get a AB armor hics ... at full tank then you will have much bigger issue.
---
&gt;You're limited to the smallest mining ship
---
Are Mining Rokhs still a thing? How do they compare to ventures and Procurers? Guessing Cargospace would be their biggest issue?
---
A constellation wide industrial index or even region wide.           
---
This will reduce the places where it is good to put up an industial structure just to have lower tax and increase the cost of each new ship when you build it in bigger numbers.               
---
2 birds with one stone.
---
Not true!
---
We kidnapped Kennykins in our hour of need as pretty mascots in tight jeans are hard to find.
---
Someone took either to much pills or not enough.
---
"we will treat you as our blood enemy" - somone should get back to earth and see that for most players, eve is a game, not his/their life or the only valuable thing in his/their life .
---
Can we get recon frigates that are unable to be d-scanned and have tackle bonuses?
---
lmao o7
---
What are you asking?
---
I still love you Jon &lt;3
---
Wow I wonder why such a large alliance and coalition would want to make new friends! I thought this game especially in null space was about war,fighting and PVP. Removing potential targets from it's member base just seems wrong in my opinion. Perhaps TEST are ~~affraid~~ concerned that these entities will continue to band together and threaten the coalition at a later date. Maybe I am missing the point or cannot see the strategy the above decisions either way less people to fight may not be a good direction.
---
Before people flame my statement it is my opinion and I am involved in the war between the two coalitions thus a little worried what a potential peace time situation would bring.
---
And why do you need a huge supercap umbrella to defend miners ?
---
 Because a bigger group would throw THEIR supers ar you for trying to defend it.
---
Well yes and no.           
---
Bumping is the issue - over the years i killed (or not) many supers and titans that were unexpectedly bumped.     
---
It looks very funny - you have few supers and titans next to each other and for no reason one of them is being ejected and high speed.            
---
Sometimes those ships are just sitting in this spot together for few minutes, sometimes it is happening when they jump in or they are warping in as a fleet.    
---
If you will get bumped this way you can end up 20km away but also 300km away.              
---
So i am fine with removing cynos from capitals but like fix this bumping issue first.
---
42
---
&gt;dock and leave because there’s no cost in doing so compared to fighting
---
Exactly. From the perspective of the linemember, nothing is lost when a structure dies. All their stuff gets Asset Safetied away and they get it back in two weeks. Most linemembers aren't defending structures they live out of most of the time. Why risk losing your ship for nothing?
---
I don't disagree that risk-aversion is a problem in EVE, but to act as though that risk-aversion is not driven by game mechanics is hopelessly naive.
---
Just saw this while scrolling on my phone, this brings back so many memories. A real shame EVE just isnt a good fit for me anymore.

---
Poaching is poaching no matter how many pretty words we use to explain it. I'm almost happy to see PL finally get some new corps and revitalize by cannibalizing allies. Makes for better space fights.

Come on Hed, he means serious alliances.

Doubt it, there was a bunch of new stuff being built other than world arks in abyssal space.

No, you currently cannot light any of the 3 cynosural field generators in High Security space.
---
left skub or right skub?
---
Wait, what? Why does a powerful and battle hardened alliance like TAPI need the blackout to be over to regain their sov?! Is blackout too scary for TAPI?
---
Yes but they took a tcu in one of TAPIs systems!
---
Sounds like the same timeline as TAPI taking FRT  sov
---
To pretend it isn't both sides of the same coin is beyond hopelessly naive.  
---
"killboard stats" have shaped null into what it is for years, asset safety just cemented that shape

This is a question best suited to our [No question is too stupid thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d37m1w/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread/)
---
No, it’s considered as a cancer patient.
---
Do so ! Eventualy you'll loose ship(s), but if you play it smart, you might get New friends in the process, and even maybe find a knew home ! Worked for me that way :)
---
I think your idea is great, its exactly what pve needs. I would also simply scale down the rewards for rats, allowing for full concord payments in HS where they drop t1s in lvl1 sites, but almost zero the isk rewards in NS where concords isnt there anyway, but would allow for many more t2 and green drops.
---
Salvaging would be much awesomerer. 
---
Ninja salvaging in null would really be a profession.
---
This would really rival incursions but would give small null corps plenty of content on tuesday nights.
---
You would really need a well thought small fleet for pve, would teach noobs to counterfit measures but not as dangerous as pvp. 
---
Not really multiboxable, definitely not afk-able. 
---
Would bring tons of green items into the meta. Fun to play with, not to mention that feeling that "i wanna test this" 
---
I wish i could upvote more, maybe this type of pve wont go unnoticed.

Wat.

A cyno does not stop incomming reps. A hic cannot be repaired while using its hicpoints but that has 0 to do with the cyno.

---
What we're explaining isn't poaching.
---
&gt; Provi versus PL wasn't fair
---
You're right, PL was outnumbered, Provi should have easily handled things but they called in TEST, so PL called in friends.  Thanks for keeping up.
---
You really think someone would do that? Go onto reddit and flair bait?
---
No, I really think that an 18k alliance can field more than 300 in their prime time in their staging.  Hell, 2K alliance can field more than 100 in their staging.
---
your statistical gymnastics based on member numbers have no bearing. In addition the deceiving watering down of the Frat numbers by not adding their allies doesnt doesnt give substance to your arguments.
---
Make changes that helps little alliances more than the donut.
---
Hope they didn't find out what I did with their corpses :&gt;
---
The only beacon of hope is chivalrous null with all their Brave and PvP centric linemembers waiting to thrust themselves into the heat of battle at the drop of a ping... totally not spod brains mind you.
---
This is a great meme. Poor little Black Legion., the 2000+ man 1 tz alliance who could only form 200 man sub fleets of HACs with 30 supers and 50 dreads in support.  Despite how hard you want to believe you were "the little guys punching up", you were very VERY large and powerful, especially given the era in which you threw around such firepower.
---
Given Panfam history with blues, I wouldn't say they want more tbh.
---
There is a new room as of the September update. It has a tower with several construction yards that seem to be assembling Dreadnaughts. They also appear to be the "unidentified structure" we saw in the video released at EVE North.
---
Everyone can win outnumbered if you just happen to third party on the winning side every time. And even if supers weren't used every time, the threat of getting roflstomped held smaller groups back, of actually trying to oppose groups that had them.
---
Still waiting for shield slaves, the vanguard (serpentis carrier), angel titans, serpentis fighters, and other stuff that was announced in the last 3 years that never happened but was a fun idea anyway.

How cute....you found the reply Button.

Next up, the UNDOCK ?

I heard sometimes that industrialist and miners are considered pets.... Just because they don't fight and support fighters -_-

That's some kind of high level koolaid he's drinking. 600 pilots a 3am, but they should be able to contest even if that's not their TZ. 
---
Even goons cannot do that easily.
---
Advertising cyno ability is the absolute fucking dumbest thing they have ever done. Eve is like a game of poker, and with this shit you literally are just showing your hand to your enemy before the fight even starts. There is no reason for someone who can't out-escalate you to fight you if you have a recon. There's also no hope for you to fight someone who is going to blob the fuck out of you (someone you *can* out-escalate with capitals, but not with manpower) if you *don't* have a recon. For big scale stuff it doesn't matter - both sides are packing many cynos this is known before the fight starts, but in a small-medium sized gang/fleet scenario, this is a silly amount of information given away for free.
---
Like they said, can you show us how many time NC went down ? I don't know for Horde but I sure can count our own timers.
---
I went down south 3 times, 2 of them being US asking Frat and not the other way around.
---
We're even deployed at the other end of the galaxy, we're sure ready to help FRAT anytime dear.

well, now goons are better organized and the reverse is happening and you started crying: blue donut, stagnation, eve is dieing etc.

Sure, extend your helping hand to people in a bad situation and expect them all to refuse because TEST is blueing everyone.

a little hate for the players on the other side drives conflict.

But they are #1 though.
---
I smell fear in these words...
---
To be fair, TEST did a good job mounting their coalition.
---
But TEST being with goons on a lot of their engagement is just game-breaking, you can't have the two largest coalitions in the game ally and have balance.
---
I'd change my mind when they'll become the true third party they should have been since a long time.
---
Imagine petitioning for a Thrasher
---
Also, I love the Snuff flair for the extra dash of irony!
---
Yeah some pretty serious tapi brain
---
I'm sorry but we're rarely here when TEST does something not related to Panfam.
---
But you tend to be there every time goon does something to Panfam.
---
Hypocrisy much ?
---
A question for the 2003 vets. I'm reading Empires of Eve and was it really how it is described in the book? The great Northern war, Phoenix alliance, Evolution, Jade Constantine, m0o... It sounds like it was a lot more fun back then. In 2004 a lot of things happened and today SOV barely changed since 2015.
---
Yussss give us NPC dreads to farm all day long.
---
The reason big null blocs have more supers is because they put in the work to take sov, put up structures, then mine the materials to build them. They should have a numerical advantage over people who don't want to do those things. 
---
So what you are saying is that moving them around or storing them is the main problem then fine let them in LS but their weapons systems and jump bridge or any offensive module should be disabled. They have no real strategic use in LS since it's empire space and they can dock in stations now. They can jump in and out at will but they should't be allowed to be used in any offensive or defensive role in LS.
---
Excuse me, its a Test dread, now Test is finally blueing the NPC
---
all scams to some degree depend on the UI being shitty because the idea of a scam is to make your target take an action that is ultimately harmful to there goal.
---
Now in order to scam somebody, you need to have a knowledge gap.
---
To make this very abstract if we let both the victim and the scammer write down the possible outcomes and how likely they are these will not match up the victim either has the false belief of leverage or lacks a mechanical understanding to what's going on.
---
Disassemble some of the popular scams and you quickly see most depend on some piece of information the scammer has that the victim is lacking.
---
Are you talking about account sharing?  
---
That's a bad thing now?
---
Tbh CONCORD are just legalized gankers
---
After playing SOMA I never felt really comfortable doing clone jumps anymore hehe
---
This must be purely for reddit, because anyone in those fleets knows better.
---
The whole time the Goons were pushing in the north, we showed up to maybe half a dozen timers, mostly keepstar kill timers.
---
PL is literally deployed in frat space and trying to entosis our shit. (But at least they're undocking again.)
---
Horde had a short-lived deployment down here as well.
---
And don't forget at the start of all this:
---
&gt;We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong [sic]. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
Tbh i have no issue with this and should be an actual feature not a bug. The way the npcs nust forget all your crimes is dumb.
---
So you recognized the problem with logis. That's a start.
---
i really don't want any more blues
---
delve is fucking BORING
---
&gt;Previously you just wouldn't roam in places where you'll surely get dropped.
---
Dude, come on. This is getting embarrassing. Before CSM I generally enjoyed your posts even if I didn't agree with most of them but recently your comments seem to have become dumber and dumber.
---
&gt;To add to this, the closer your BM is to the station, the larger the effect of undock variance is (i.e. the longer it takes to align to the BM).
---
this is wrong, it's all angular
---
If capsuleers are in capsules and pilot giant ships on their own, why do many ships have what appear to be cockpits and bridges?

nice feeding recently btw
---
Is that a... waypoint line in the background? Muh Immersion!
---
&gt; You keep trying to seperate the two. They aren't separate.
---
separate the two what?
---
you seem to misunderstand intent versus effect
---
&gt;Biggest way to increase risk is to encourage players to interact. When you cause the interaction to be completely one sided the other side stops playing.
---
jesus you're so wrong- ratting became significantly more riskier because of blackout- you can't deny that.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Where's the option to filter by size and not by name?
---
imagine talking in local other than "gf"
---
I also miss the times when you could roam null in normal ships and didn't need a 4b pimp mobile for killing crabs. The times have also passed, so fuck this game.
---
I know it's tiring to hear, but the present exists because of the past. After World War Bee or the Casino War or whatever, TEST chased goons to delve to keep them from doing what they ended up doing. Instead of helping, PL decide to farm TEST in Vale of the Silent. That made our position there untenable. We went down to eso and took all that space from the Russians. Goons didn't help us, in fact, they helped the russians. When Goons realized the Russians were to lazy to show up for their own timers, they abandoned them. Eventually, we came to a nervous truce. When frat, pl, skillu, tri, and everyone else made a promise to come evict us yet again (remember the famous doom quote about TEST nutting up or shutting up), that's when TEST joined forces with goons. Maybe if PL wasn't full of shitlords that just wanted easy ganks all the time, EVE wouldn't be where it is right now.
---
Yet you seems to want to kill ratters. Tried Tribute or Vale? Those areas are supposed to be filled with smaller PvP groups. I wouldn't expect much targets ratting there tho.
---
I guess that's why there's so few bots in FW...
---
".. **Interactions in 2019"** You must be new here
---
You mad. Why you mad ?
---
You can do all you want for the mentality, at the end of the day nobody wants to spend time and effort fighting for nothing.
---
Supers can't dock in stations in LS like they just can't CCP says no. 
---
They can dock in the rare LS keepstars ( not many of those around ). 
---
It also removes a whole bunch of LS groups out of there playstyle ( you gank jump freighters well sucks to be you ), you're a nomadic group that fights in null well sucks to try and move your super fleet around because none of them will have guns you're jumping a loot pinata around LS.
---
You want to move a bunch of dreads down from the north where you pilot stage to drop down south hope you didn't plan on jumping them truth LS because if 5 cruisers find you well guess how is about to lose 5 dreads. 
---
The reality is even with a super removal there isn't gonna be some new group that goes live in LS if you're really hell-bent on living somewhere in some backwater lowsec system you already can without carriers, once you start setting up infrastructure is when carriers will start to matter somewhat but even then if you annoying enough or fun enough you can likely come to some understanding with the local power bloc.
---
Jokes on you guy, 20 years from now Star Citizen will be in the final stages of it's 95th Beta testing release and will be released *any day now*.
---
On a more serious note, I disagree with the thought of passing characters on in that fashion. Ultimately your character is a representation of you, as a person. Your achievements and accolades are yours. The concept of passing forward past legends is preserved by virtue of corporations and alliances. So you have CEOs and alliance leaders change over time but the legend of the alliance/corp lives on, as do the historic memories.
---
Passing characters on to new identities cheapens their unique identity; particularly when we as players, at the same time, seek to immortalize those players we lose with memorials and shrines to their pilots. Just ask any corporation in the game who has been around for a little while and you will undoubtedly come across a character in their roster who they will never kick out because the pilot behind the character passed on.  I think it is insensitive to that real sentiment and I would be highly opposed to CCP passing down accounts in that fashion.
---
Besides, hereditory rights would imply you have actual rights of ownership which you are able to pass on to your estate; that isn't the case as ultimately all digital media within EVE Online is the property of CCP, all you get is your own time and the enjoyment (or perhaps lack of) that you derive from that time.
---
I like your take on it, and I also think the memorials/shrines are an awesome touch.
---
That's how most people *want* to play I think.
---
I tried many playstyles and eventually found out that the one fitting me most is being in a large alliance but only flying with smaller groups within that alliance.
---
I'm currently in TEST and relatively active in my corp fleets and our small-gang sig. I've been in the alliance for 2 years and I have joined maybe 3 "strat ops" or other fleets with more than ~20 people.
---
I just do my own thing, train what I want to fly, deploy where my smaller groups want to go and that's fine. 
---
I don't have rorquals, or a titan, or a super. Nobody ever made me do anything.
---
You've always been a bot, you just didn't know it.
---
So you're saying we did fight larger groups and our supers weren't always the winning factor.  Thanks for admitting I'm right, very big of you and shows real growth in you as a person.
---
Keep working on it though.
---
I'm sorry are you saying PL pilots are leaving for Goons?  I dont really think thats an accurate portrait you're painting but watching you try and make that logical leap, the fall 40 stories in failure sure has been funny.
---
the truth has finally been revealed .... take an upvote.

when i first started playing I thought that ment, Get Fucked.

Eve had ways been dying
---
VR googles and elite ? TBH no idea what exactly - many games around.
---
flying logi can be so fun and painfull at the same time, on one hand you get the fights when you manage to save ppl just in time and you can realy feel that you make a real impact on the fleet..
---
then ofc you have the fleets when your armor rep is 0,5s away from repping when the ship die :-(
---
but yeah we need more logi love from ccp, logi on killmails (will help to spot gatecamps whit big logi before you jump in to fight them too)
---
but what about my nanogang, you must cater to my playstyle!
---
i have other kind of question.....what to do with eve account when our real life death is coming (cancer final stage etc.) can other family member take it over? how this is handled properly?
---
Because there is also human crew within ships

Today is my first birthday in the game and let me tell you this: Its really hard to keep up with changing doctrines in a Pvp alliance when you are a new player. But when you start out and really want to, you will do it. It needs time. Eve is a kind of a slow methodic game, and people that want a quick sense of pleasure are better off playing Fortnite. Thats my opinion.
---
I think new players are attracted to things where they can make ISK because they have nothing at the start. Exploration in J-Space and Market stuff (buy low/sell high) was my starting point. I know that I unfitted my Prototype Cloaking Device before hacking the Relic site in case a Sabre warps in. It was too expensive for me and I didnt want to lose it. But everybody is different and people will also listen what others say.
---
For example at the very start some dude told me to make dank isk I have to train into mining barges. So I did. Got bored after 2 days. I went on and searched something else. Other people probably stop at that point and say "Eve is a boring game". 
---
I also came across people that really wants to help me out by replacing my stuff and gave me tips, because they were afraid that I stop playing after the ship loss. I also give newer players a few tips now and then. But I do not tell them what do, because everything I do would probably be very boring to him/her.
---
And I actually dont understand the PvE vs. PvP discussions. Let the people play whatever they want. If you feel more comfortable you can see it this way: Every highsec ratter is a potential carrier ratter a year later (not me), which you can try to hunt.
---
Maybe a bit off-topic at some points, but its my birthday! :)
---
Tldr;
---
Eve is a slow method game; play Fortnite if you need a quick burst of adrenaline. Let people play whatever they want. Its my birthday
---

He's just trying to speed up the (what he seems to think) inevitable. Test has slowly been progressing but this is probably a desperate attempt to try to demoralize the smaller groups.

That's what it actually means, yes

Is your heart filled with masculinity and pride when you piss while standing?

In eve its really important to join a corp. Interaction is the biggest part of eve. Consider what your long term goals in the game are, and look for a corp that fits your goals, and is within your timezone. But I would recommend browsing zkillboard, or the forums. Or physically looking at people flying in the area you stay
---
Phoebe hit long before people did that umbrella shit, you're objectively wrong.
---
Grath, you were trying too hard five years ago when I used to play, and you're trying too hard now. It's a spaceship videogame. Numbers don't mean jack shit about you. Maybe you should step away from the computer.

Very nice find. I've read the company reviews as well, they give good insight.

Calm down, miner.

you compare a 99% vs 1% case with a 60% 40% one .. you are part of the problem
---
I don't get this. Frat tries to evict TEST but gets repelled. Now TEST in turn tries to evict Frat but the progress is slow af so Vily makes a propaganda post to demoralize his enemies. This is normal, why these shocked(?) reactions?
---
Flying logi is like bipolar disorder: one day you are yawning and playing civ in second monitor, the other day you are overheating and managing targets like crazy trying to save your bros from multiple fleets with different targets while being primaried, dampened and jammed (and often TD'd)
---
don't speak
---
I still feel that you have chosen wrong tree to bark on. It is CCP who made game mechanics which promotes all the things you blame goons about. Goons only played inside rule set and achieved great success. It’s CCPs duty to monitor and fix game mechanics and asking players to not use it to their advantage is not really smart thing to do.
---
They're pretty interesting but also kind of sad, because you can see how CCP almost never takes the advice of the CSM.
---
That's the best advice I read today.

and when you get good. you can just join NC. stick your alt in logi ship and multibox at pvp like the true gods

---
you may like the WH if you never try it. it's definitively the opposit of "getting lost in huge alliance".  
---
WH's corps are realy small and tight knit comunity. 40ppl is a realy big fleet. every man count.  
---
WH's doctrines can be pretty expensive and may require high SP but it dont seem a problem for you.  
---
If you want to fly caps, aim a C5 corp. lower class also use caps but less often.and there is no supers in WH
---
What is there to do in wormholes ? I’ve looked into them before years ago but it just seems a constant loop of belt ratting if I remember correctly. I’m looking for active content / a goal to work towards
---
I know just what you're saying
---
Lol, glad you can read...
---
&gt;And after a few years here I landed a job in IT that most people would have said I wasn't qualified for as Paul the Customer Service Rep. As a spaceship captain in a far away universe though...

He literally is saying he was Customer Service Rep and **then** got a job in IT...

??? Logis in Munin fleets are like [https://img.youtube.com/vi/1g-X8zZ3\_hQ/0.jpg](https://img.youtube.com/vi/1g-X8zZ3_hQ/0.jpg) ...the guns just stay longer alive because someone is wasting time to shoot em!
---
You're missing the point that Riot Games can in a week find out pretty accurately what effects their changes had. You can barely move your ships to staging in that time not to mention using them a meaningful amount to gather data. The feedback cycle of getting data is much faster in League than in Eve.
---
&gt; They have double the tweaking potential over Riot
---
What potential? CCP has fewer devs, less money and a way more complex system to consider (league is balanced around 5v5).

Some stations such as jita 4-4 allows you to make insta undock to a safe multiple AU away. Just warp between the planets/moons until you are directly to north of the station (tactical overlay has a line showing north).

You should be able to fly a destroyer basically at the start of the game

Learn how to spell loser
---
Kinda hard to lose when nobody is left playing lol
---
Vily makes a propaganda post where he tries to get smaller groups to leave the slightly loosing side and let them be left alone and you accuse him of trying to kill other groups? Frat started this war by attacking Test last year and it's not like Frat doesn't stand a chance of defending themselves. Comparing this to PLs past actions is to say the least, odd. This isn't farming some other group to death. This is a normal war between fairly equal opponents.
---
How is that fixing? You just said the same thing he did.

Example: /u/jormand14 is a loser.

Provbloc don't have a Supercap fleet.  PL does.  One can escalate any engagement and the other cannot.
---
Yeeah, its going to be LORDE's fault that eve dies, are you fucking serious cpt_soban
---
You can trivially make a hic permatank a super. Afterburners are magic!
---
Large chunks of WinterCo have TEST blocked. 
---
It shuts up local, it stops some of the fleet invites they'll send to people undocking before joining standing fleet.
---
It doesn't matter if you agree. The data (n=80,000) leads to that conclusion. It's counterintuitive, but you're not entitled to your own facts.
---
https://youtu.be/A92Ge2S8M1Y
---
Yes, exactly my point, thank you for validating the fact that, as I said Eve is not, was not and never will be a purely PvP game.
---
I really like it when people try and invalidate what people say on reddit but only end up enforcing the point they were trying to invalidate.
---
TRIG MARAUDER!  
---
goddamnit, i should read all the posts before I get all excited
---
lmao sure you did faggot
---
&gt; jesus you're so wrong- ratting became significantly more riskier because of blackout- you can't deny that.
---
*by encouraging players to interact in ways that they would not previously.*
---
I think you are misinterrupting the point.  At no point did Providence out gun PL at no point was it a fair fight for Providence.  PL doesn't go after anyone of similar might that can stand up to them anymore.  I do keep up I moved out of Providence while this was happening for many reasons and joined Test for the very reason I was fed up PL and NC bullying people and was in the hope that being part of Test I could still help friends I had in Provi.
---
The only reason PanFam cant stand up to Test and Goons right now is because PanFam hasn't adjusted with the game as an outsider looking in.  Goons and Test have built up empires held space built infastructure while still being a force on the PVP scene.  Where as PamFam from the outside haven't gone back to build infastructure and hasn't adapted to the need to be a super power to have the empire and industrial might behind its PVP force.
---
Same. but I guess it's nothing good for the game/community
---
Also the same re: PanFam &amp; WinterCo there. I covered that in the corrections video which is also on my channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqHED5swEGI)!
---
Thanks, always nice to see someone else recommending my content, really made my morning :)
---
There were some fights during the glassing of Tribute.  I mean the number wasn't zero.  There weren't any big fights though because NCPL ran away.  I don't blame them.  Goons are too strong for any other alliance in game and maybe too strong for all other nullsec entities combined.  I think maybe the only way to down Goons is for both Init and Tapi to form with NC/PL/Frat.  That seems unlikely for the time being.
---
"constant loop of belt ratting" ?? holy shit no
---
the Pve in WH is realy challenging. both because the anoms are hard (point, neut, remote repair between npc, huge EHP and dps) and also because some cloaky guys can gank you easily (no local + random conexions). You have to be 100% focus on what you are doing  
---
but it's extremely rewarding (high risk, high reward). 2 shiny BS ~500M/h in C5 for exemple  
---
the conclusion is you don't need to farm a lot if you don't want. I usualy use my krab setup 2-4h in a month and it's enough to sustain my pvp losses. 
---
On the other hand, no one is feeding us with content, there is barely never CTA or programed fleet. If you want a fight, you have to actively hunt, hunt a lot, scanning, probing, scooting etc...  
---
But it's woth it, because kills are realy juicy : +1b Krabs BS, multi bilions T3c hunter you can bait, the regular fleet ship is around 700-2b + shiny pod
---
PS: Whers use a lot triglavian ship. It's a new race of ship (realy cool btw) I assume you don't know. so, new ships to skill in, new gameplay to learn, new awsome visuals... sound cool for a comeback
---
To reflect the triglavian subcaps ability to engage at long and short range with the same guns without a penalty we have decided to allow triglavian dreadnoughts to engage subcaps and capitals with the same weapons by simply swapping ammo.
---
Me Rentner me Feelings Hurt Go krab sad ☹️
---
This right here is reason people inject. Merlin-point-die-reship. Rinse repeat. OR you sit on a gate for most the fleet with everyones alts.

Pvp doesn't mean 1v1

I did an entire blog on jumping into eves pvp less then 48 hours old.
---
Infact when I joined brave I was in a fleet with my guns ungrouped!
---
The thing is everyone believes they are on the left side ...
---
Based on their own benchmarks. Which aren't reliable.
---
Amd did that last time with their round of cpu's. They released in house benchmarks which turned out be done on software perfect for the cpu in that situation. 
---
Specific hardware setup specific programs running doing specific tasks and the benchmark recorded only then. 
---
In reality when public got hold of them then benchmarks where massively different.
---
Zen2 has proven itself in countless benchmarks now to be completely competetive at a lower pricepoint, please stop talking out of your ass
---
12 phases is grossly ridiculously overkill for stock usage. 6 for stock and 8-10 for PBO is reasonable, beyond that it's extreme OC mumbo jumbo

so what
---
Did a t3 in my omen.  Went into the pvp room. Blue friendly in there.
---
Convo'd him and estimated fit of his ikiturza was 20 bill.
---
He had enough tank to last against anything whilst his single weapon spooled to over 1250 dps with a single damage mod.
---
Then he had utility slots and speed on his side.
---
The entire fit could tank its self but do enough damage to kill any other cruiser in the game.
---
The abyss pvp died the moment they implemented a ship capable of killing everything that isn't itself.
---
Only lames would do that
---
PL left their super fleet up North during that, to krab. The biggest they had were regular caps and a couple of bridging Rags.
---
we need popup killer
---
lonely island reference noted
---
Just try to select multiple items you don't have the fitting requirements for. You will not make it.
---
That's more to my point.  I realize some see their character as self-expression, but I would be honored to have my son fly in my stead if I were in terminal health.  My capsuleer can be recloned, so why should I let him go with me?  Obviously, my friends and fellow pilots would know what happened because I'd tell them in advance, if possible.  
---
I guess when thinking about Corps that keep their late members, for how many generations would that be feasible?  Most corporation's will likely fizzle out, unlike larger alliances (which can also fade away in time).  If your Corp is just a humbly sized group of friends and you want your name to go on, you can't rely on your Corp being around forever.
---
Interestingly, there's a character I see in Jita all the time lately (probably an Alt) named Forrest Fenn.  I know this name well, because Fenn was an Air Force Major and F-4 Phantom pilot (shot down over Nam, 1,500th rescue by the Jolly Green), who wanted his name to live on so he wrote a book called "The Thrill of the Chase" and hid an estimated $2-3M in treasure "somewhere in the Rocky Mountains" of the United States.  I've searched for this treasure twice and I know the stories well.  Someone else knows this, too, and named their character after him.  Maybe we don't have to allow our characters to live on after were gone, maybe someday Eve will allow us to leave our own hidden treasures and lore in-game?
---
The Unity tag says Unity Engine.   EVE Online predates that game engine itself, and for years, Unity was Mac and iOS only.  
---
You can't sue a game concept or mechanic either, as that can't be copyrighted.  Otherwise the game industry will be suing each other CoD vs. Battlefield.  Bluehole should know this when PUBG tried to sue Fortnite, most unsuccessfully.   If you like the most recent example of game ripoffs, is how Drodo's Autochess got copied by Dota Underlords, Riot's Teamfight Tactics and Tencent's Chess Rush.  
---
The game industry is built from copying each other, and these copies evolving and improving from the original concept.  Things like League of Legends from Dota, Overwatch from Team Fortress, or how every MMO came from a single concept.  
---
Having played Second Galaxy, there are significant differences from EVE.   I played EVE a long time ago, but that is a long time ago.  
---
Zlonggame is a great company based on their other games, such as World of Kings and Langrisser Mobile.   They are no doubt, very good in coding and developing for mobile.
---
CCP on the other hand, partnered with Netease, the so called "Diablo Immortal" guys.  PC chauvinism aside, I have played Netease games and was very well impressed with them.  So CCP+Netease is a very strong partnership that gives me good vibes and a high confidence about the EVE mobile game.
---
Competition is good and zlonggame I am sure knows Netease very well, and I'm sure Netease knows Zlonggame is top talent company, so both companies are going to compete their hardest here.
---
Except they end up like avengers. Just Hugh HP with trash payout.

You can see in the logs that the tornado had a criminal status

Ok thanks

Oh so you mean it's the same as 2018?
---
Yeah I resubbed there and just threw some secondary long skills into the queue, them new ships look amazing and it’s made me realise other than incursions I’ve never actually done game content only player content. I might have a look into that unless it’s boring as all hell lol
---
It's an entire season, So sadly a lot of the staff focus is on running the thing and not advertisement. You can catch streams every Saturday though!
---
While I support the "bring back the meme" sentiment but... I like Eve politics.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted they literally banned meme posts
---
More importantly under changed files... possible space emojis?
---
You always this helpful?

Thinking people don't account share in a mmo lmfao.

What is this ?
---
" we will treat you as our blood enemy and hound you until you die."
---
Wow , this is so frightening
---
So if so strong and unbeatable why haven’t they gone for the new stronghold lol
---
I mean you can all laugh but it's not very fair that one side can hold such a big advantage by using the exact same tactics that my side used, before we pissed it all away on a personal vendetta. It's just not fair.
---
You could take a look in [r/evejobs](www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/) see if there's anything in there that you like the look of. My advice would be to join a small but active wh corp, find someone there that's willing to take you under their wing.
---
It's an EvE Online Tournament with a league structure behind it. Open registration and all.
---
You could look at r/evejobs. Or consider this https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University

CCP is literally retarded and thinks people only play on one account. Imagine trying to sort through modules on a JF alt that doesn’t have any combat skills, it’s fucking aids.
---
Ark gets over 330k but fuel is in Stain so ... obvious choice.
---
This is such a retarded and shit post, fucking cringe

They expire in 2 weeks not gonna be a problem for long

There is a slider inside of settings that lets you increase time when the popup is showing up.        
---
In the settings you can also disable the transparency on most of the items, while this don't work well on pinned windows - always something.
---
Wrong he’s a tapi shill
---
I've seen posts about such things previously.  The no account sharing policy is meant to prevent obvious abuse, passing the account to a relative is unlikely to face punishment.  I'm pretty sure I've seen people able to access someone's account after they have passed away unexpectedly.
---
That said the best way is to transfer the character to a new account owned by the relative, this keeps everything in line with approved processes.
---
Add all of Legacy, GOTG, and FIRE to Imperium affiliates
---
RR battleships were the bestlogi. They did not have stupid strong bonuses to reps and user error was a major thing. These days it seems if your ship doesnt have a bonus to it its not worth fitting.
---
Honestly i think logi is a big contributor to the decline of small gangs. The best way to brake through them reps is to get more dudes in fleet.
---
Or you now need a special "Anchoring unit" , which you buy from the store  ;)
---
Just saying I'd nerd out and buy a capsule-shaped PC setup to game in if it became available.  Not looking to play Elite Dangerous, lol
---
Well eve and ED are totally different games linked just with spaceship tag
---
It's almost like when the developers of the game openly state that they read Reddit for ideas/feedback that it causes people to try and use Reddit to present the things they want to see in the game to those developers.
---
Really.  PL cannot move their super fleet.  It's stuck.  Escalation avoided.  News at 11.
---
ripped off, brainless one liners are banned. no loss really.
---
Maybe the majority of them, but supers was used against Provi.
---
Whatever happened to avocado lawyer guy?
---
It was 100% accurate back in 2014, too
---
Wouldnt you be more immersed in that case?
---
spawning new plants and moons?
---
I always say lore should justify good gameplay rather than the other way around.  But you can achieve the same without disregarding everything we know about the technicalities of the EVE universe.
---
Eh. I don't remember anything close to the current level of "omg krabs r bad" back in the day. The last 5 years or so sure though.
---
It’s also healthier if done correctly
---
That's exactly the point though.
---
I really couldn’t care less if a cap does because it bumps off another huge ball of caps.
---
Reddit wasn’t the only place where him typing that post left a mark
---
You don't need huge ball, 2 is enough, damn sometimes a single cap and object is enough.
---
What are you afraid of engaging on a WH grid? It’s not like they can escalate to any meaningful degree... Comes with the territory of being a smaller groups. 
---
The concern on the WH side is some bullshit like getting rolled out while camped away by e.g. titans or a colossal muninn/harpy fleet.
---
sounds like fun
---
so what what? the risk went away again because players no longer interact once again.
---
That’s what I love about all you short attention span grrr gons. We have been in the same war since 2007.
---
Periodically you guys think it “ends”.
---
I still don't get it why would anyone want this.

Logi on killmail means you've failed to save your comrade.

TEST spam Detorid/WC daily with 'everyone here is botting' comment meanwhile took rent from KwG over 2 years and claimed to have no clue they were botting and told many people on reddit and ingame who reported it to get fucked and report it to CCP. 
---
WC is spammed daily about how FRT Treasury is the youngest alliance and biggest % for age/members on Peligro chart yet they conveniently forget how KwG is number 2 using the same metrics which as mentioned TEST rented out to for 2 years which is now absorbed into their rental group in paragon soul. I think about a dozen confirmed botting Nyxs have died from KwG and the paragon absorbed alliance over the past 2 years.
---
No doubt there are a lot of bots in FRT space probably the highest concentration in game. but at same time you cannot ignore period basis paragon soul and the entirely of legacy owned east has had big bot infestations for years. TEST have routinely spammed local (not just line members, directors/FCs and Vily himself) about how it is all subhumans and bots. Now they want to shelter the people they say are subhuman bot. It really makes you think. 
---
It's just part of the inconsistant narrative.
---
Can you send thanks to Sage for feeding us 4b tengu's repeatedly? Would be appreciated.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee people are not playing in the sandbox how i want them to play reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Getting split on a crit wormhole with varying effects inside. In nullsec the worst split is on a stargate and thats easily solveable. When wh gangs come to my apace, i proactively crit their hole or roll them out if I have the time to engage them.
---
OOooook dood
---
How about instead you delay your posting
---
Is it dead yet
---
RX570 can run single account with no problem at high settings, multiple screens 1440p+ 3 windowed FHD needs medium settings.
---
GTX1080 has no problem with 1440p v.high + 3x FHD windowed. Sometimes game has drops but its more a graphics card power settings or CCP fault for bad coding.
---
Any kind of coding that requires more than switching a boolean variable from true to false or false to true is not a "simple" change for CCP.
---
Yes, punishing people for playing the game.
---
Sound terrific.
---
i run 43" with 4 independent inputs making up 4 independent screens on 1080
---
If you learn the hole classes and have at least skimmed the eve university wiki page for wormhole mechanics, you’re not going to split an appropriately sized fleet across a hole in a fight. I don’t know any group that would attempt a two way combat ship trip through a crit null. Neither of these are reasons to refuse to take the fight on their hole, and we’ve already established they aren’t able to escalate significantly/out escalate...
---
As to your last sentence, you are contributing to them resisting fighting you off the hole, so your complaint about it earlier in the comment chain is... interesting.
---
This war started in March when the russians decided they wanted content and/or more space.
---
The amazing part is how long / equal fight this has been given the big disparity in numbers even before batphoning happens. The disparity becomes even larger after batphones.
---
Reverse. The higher the adm from datting the longer the delay.
---
I mean... You traitorious bastards are dirty, but not batshit retarded.
---
Pretty sure that all "LIFE" in Eve is all human. Unless you consider Rogue Drones life. New Eden was seeded from the Milky Way through the Eve Gate before its collapse. Some of the factions got lost, some purposefully hid, others went to war with each other and continue to do so to this day.
---
Too late. Krabs won.
---
I have the 49" curved Samsung, run a NVIDIA QUADRO P4000 4X DP 8 GB GDDR5,
---
Not a gaming card I know but works great and I run the 3 accounts at once on Ultra. splitting more than 3 accounts at once is messy and most windows dont scale properly for me once I try any more than 3 but  that looks to be a Samsung issue on the monitor rather  than the card, I need to look a different software for the screen splitting .

Can’t write properly.
---
Or 10mins with a single nag in C6
---
Just out of interest what do you do with that card (if you don't mind me asking). Do you do some sort of 3D rendering?
---
By that argument you need to consider PanFam into the fight too. Had PanFam stayed with their own fight, we wouldn't bring Goons.
---
Hmm so if you don't login and be active in your space your ADM is low so best way is to not login.        
---
If you not login your ADM is low and you will lose space and all your structures and after this is there a reason to login?
---
Actually, we aren't.
---
Fleet participation from Evictus has tripled over last two months, we have much more activity going while we purged some but not all dead weight.
---
If anything, we are growing and getting much better daily.
---
&gt;Tie local blackout to ADM index in a system. System as simple as:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;IF ADM &gt; 3.0 then: Local is blackouted Else local is normal
---
Reverse this:   make BO the rule and allow local to be restored with the rise in ADMs.   You \_earn\_ your local through living in your space.
---
That could be interesting.
---
Thanks bros &lt;3

In fleet, logibros are like a secret society. we have our own chat, speaking about our trouble with jam, neut, cap chain...  
---
When I fly dps ship and the fleet is destroyed, I'm like "well, ok, that's happend"  
---
but when I fly logi, I'm so sad to see all my corpmates dieing in my arms. It's even worse when I came back alive, I feel like a traitor XD
---
You might be interested in the small ship shattered wormholes! They are all c6 wolf rayet, but they only allow destroyers and smaller, and spawn c1-c6 sites. So you can make crazy isk in a kiki because your sig is tiny, and your dps is just huge, and you can blitz c1s and c2s, and maybe even c3s very very fast. The problem is that these wormholes are farmed very often, and people like to log off inside to farm over weeks. The sites respawn pretty quickly though because it is a shattered wormhole.
---
If they wanted to actually embrace Chaos they would flip between the two and change the thresholds more than once every 66 days.
---
tbh, it's not a simple change for anyone.
---
just because a change is simple to articulate, doesn't mean it's simple to add to code.
---
High effort shit post.  10/10.  Upvoted.

How else we supposed to get those 38 bil titans

The problem is the spit between players. Some people like it some don’t

Eve University might be a good place for you to start.  They can expose you to different aspects of the game and give you an idea what to do next.

itt valk talking like he's people
---
It's just a normal propaganda post. "Hey if you stand down now we'll leave you be." That way they can weaken winterco now and drive smallfrys off after the war.
---
mostly waffles/htp supers and a couple of pl bridging titans, and also penif's rev which he largely does whatever he wants with no matter what anyone tells him
---
were you even there? i'm not sure what point you're trying to make
---
But in eve when you clone jump you literally leave the clone behind. It's really not the same.
---
I mean, Eve has quite a lot of that political and social commentary too, it's just not that apparent since none pays attention to the story/lore.
---
Man PL sure was hurting after losing those regions, now they must be on their last legs.
---
This is the "I killed a venture, facwar's not dead!" for nullsec.
---
Instead of logi on killmails, has anyone ever suggested of a separate savemail system? Like if a ship soaks N x EHP damage over a certain amount of time a savemail is generated listing everyone who had an active rep on them in that period. Logi Bros could then even have a Zsaveboard.....

Thank you for broadcasting so I don't have watch a friendly explosion in agony.

how much more easy u want eve to become? tackle pilots who dont have to worry about enemy tackle anymore..yeah right..makes sense..not.
---
u absolutely dont see the point of why stabs without malus, would be super retarded for tackle ships. and i really dont want to write a novel about eve pvp to explain u how dull this idea is.
---
im not dense minded.
---
i could think of plenty of usage for untackable tackle frigates...the point is , its and absurdly stupid idea. for so many reasons.....if u cant think of any reason why this is superbad..then u are the dense minded guy here ;)

Sign up in station to be jump cloned to an active warzone in a prefit ship. Escort an NPC faction ship to a relic site or destroy the opposing sides ship to get paid. 
---
It helps new players learn to fight but also helps them understand it's fine to lose a ship
---
Great video. I enjoy your content and I especially like that you post your notes on what could have been done better.
---
I don't know if a batphone is even needed. Goons are starved for shit like this so we'll show up whether we're called or not.

Valk just can't comprehend possibly enjoying the videogame with people other than the echo chamber he is already set in

Love the vids! Keep up the good work.

Can you do one with a wormholer and his exploits of dropping 20 dudes on 1 person and running away when it's more than 3 and then proudly rolling his hole to krab in safety? I hear that would earn good karma.

Please use the Ideas/Suggestions mega thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d5s9sp/eve_ideassuggestions_megathread/
---
oh boy. 
---
obviously the miner speaking here.
---
u ever did some pvp? camping or something?
---
put sebos on those ships. see people going red on ur mackinaw or whatever u fly...instalock them, pop at least half of their gang, mitigate lot of dps, before concorde finishes them( it also helps to not mine in 0.5 systems). so u might only lose 1 of ur 2 untanky barges...
---
u should at least try things like that. its also a shame people dont come up with some creative ideas themself, insetad they open a whiny reddit thread complaining about the most common thing in eve. next u complain ur close get wet when its raining....
---
;)

Nope. We need some corpses and ... PRAISE BOB!

So, ignoring the performance metrics of the Zen2 chips and the strong showing so far from the 3600/3800/3800/3900 so far?  Let's be a devil's advocate and say it only performs at 90 or even 80 % of the intel chip... at 1/3 the cost.  That's still going to be more than he will ever need for EVE. If it pans out to be close to similar with that +/- variable, then it will play out to be buying the same thing for a third the price. Either way, it's a huge win.
---
yep , that is coming in wormhole confessions . pls keep in mind that the above has happened in reality it's no fiction , ship and time was changed
---
I dropped my hel so many times in such dumb ways because i wanted to use the toy i spent 3 years training into. 
---
Turns out a few others wanted to do the same and we had a handful of supers dropping during that deployment. 
---
This fact does not equate to moving the entire armor super fleet down to use them as a strategic fleet comp.
---
haha just read /r/evememes :)

People should have to interact with their structure to defend it. Adding Stront, repping it a little, literally anything other than wait 15 minutes.
---
Negative. You are trying to compare a citadel where you have tether, so in this scenario, one that would be fueled, or on current tranquility, one that you have docking access.
---
On current tranquility, if you dock in a citadel and then have access revoked, upon undocking, you have no tether and are instantly targetable, before your screen even loads the exterior environment.
---
Th is behavior for unfueled citadels would need to be removed and replaced with an invul timer as NPC stations have, or with the ability to dock while pointed.
---
Time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted.
---
I have an idea:
---
Suck it up and play EVE. If you’re mad at the game it’s because your too lazy to move a ship. 
---
If you’re mad at players in EVE, suck it up and buy another ship. 
---
At some point - it’s time to put the spreadsheet down and undock your ship.
---
Same.
---
I would like to ask about how torpedo damage application is affected by an opponents velocity. 
---
I lightly understand the angular velocity and explosion velocity relation but, does torpedo damage apply completely to ships that are travelling directly toward the torpedoes?
---
As a ship travelling into an explosion is not trying to outrun the explosion, shouldnt the damage apply fully? or am I missing something. Thanks

Yep, Tapirium Guardians of the PIBC is all blued up and suffocating the server under a pile of drooling retards.

At least they’ll eventually Serenity the server and we can all finally win Eve with no risk of relapsing.

All the more reason to make sure people actually see it then.

Grr goons  upvote bait.  Shocking.
---
If you count Imperium into those numbers on the side of Legacy you kind of have to count in Panfam to the winterco side.
---
Nothing is really how it's described but it was definitely different then.  Eve was new and you had a lot of broader diversity of players and thought.  So many years on Eve had kind of settled into a least common denominator personality in terms of the player population and cured itself out to a single playstyle more or less.  I was happy to see the Chaos era shakeup as an attempt to get things more dynamic but CCP is kind of stuck with the community they helped foster.
---
Lmfao, alright kid. Just dismiss EVERYONE who disagrees as trolling you soft little snowflake. I think the dislikes you’re getting on every comment speaks for itself.

No experience with Karmafleet but have been with Brave Newbies for a long time. 
---
Brave has a nice chunk of space carved out that supports pretty much every play style. For the industry and pve side we have a lot of good areas for sub cap ratting, moons that anyone in the Corp can mine, anomoly mining and a path all the way up to capital mining and ratting. We have a ton of industry structures that let you build anything in the game easily, and a market to support it. There are a ton of resources and free ship programs to get you started and brought up to speed as well. Then if you want to PVP, we have that too. We are part of an ongoing war with fleet ops going out daily that you can join (no participation requirement though) and regularly get small to medium gangs that come through looking for fights.
---
3x 27 inch 1440p Acer monitors for me. All at Max without issues. I had to disable all of the floating non-targetable asteroids because it would cause some fps drag but that's all.

If you want to learn stuff before moving forward EVE-Uni.        
---
If you want to go into deep water choose one of the nullsec ones.           
---
* Brave Newbies - fun corp, they will teach you. Choose this if you wish to have fun, fly in small cheap ships and have a lot of laugh dying.             
---
* Pandemic Horde - no recruiting standards or checks. TBH go anywhere else if you don't want to quit the game. Avoxers, trolls and 80% alts.                           
---
* Karma Fleet - Highest recruiting standards and checks. Most organized and the most rich organization from all of newbie groups, also expect to be flying bigger ships here. You get full SRP (ship replacement program) for lost ships on the PVP fleets.
---
Miners are simply at the bottom end of the foodchain.
---
One can only act in the present with the hope of changing the future.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
I will let KarmaFleet speak for themselves, but Brave is great for newbros, with the caveat that it requires a little more of an effort than it did in 2014.  It used to be that there were so many new players we could fill fleets of newbros in lower SP ships to go on stratops, and that is not quite the case any more.  So the pre-made opportunities are not as plentiful as they once were.     
---
 That being said, the commitment and belief in helping new players is still there.  If you ask a question or for help in dojo people will fall over themselves to help you out.  If you are in a Brave fleet and can't fly the main DPS Ship, FCs are happy to have you in whatever you can bring, and will recommends EWAR or other types of ships to help.  For other corps, newbros are a great resource for the corp.  Brave inverts that logic: Brave must be a great resource to the newbro, not the other way around.  It is a commitment that I still believe in, and most of the line members and pretty much the leadership buy into.  They are always looking for new and different ways (Brave Empire, Alpha Army) to offer resources and experiences to new pilots.
---
It is like asking why do assholes exist and why do they like to see other people miserable because they are themselves.
---
It is a troll structure created by devs to mock players.

There is no reason to build it at any point.

HMU my corp is ramping up is new bro standard and retention. Wont say where or who im with cause this is reddit.
---
&gt;delve is fucking BORING
---
Agreed, which is why you SHOULD go deploy somewhere instead of trying to PvP in Delve. While it is certainly convenient to have fights at home, it is better to fight in their home than ours.
---
I'd hand down my alts to my sons if they were so inclined but my main would retire in space with his stratios somewhere in wormhole space. All isk and the like would be divided to my two main alts. My other alt would go to another eve buddy.
---
are you retarded or just don't understand the concept of image quality
---
I don't get it, it's just a picture of you blobbing a random Falcon?
---
I am jealous of TEST. The salt-induced, koolaid-powered flailing of the Pandas and their allies must be delicious.
---
Joining a Corp is the best thing you can do in eve. It makes the game feel more alive and the resources that they have can help immensely when learning the game. Brave Newbies, Eve University, Karma Fleet and Pandemic Horde all come to mind. Nullsec can be a great place for Newbies as well not just established players. I personally have been with Brave Newbies from the start and have loved every minute. Most corps, especially larger ones have strong industry backbones if that's what you are interested in doing, as well as the PVP it supports.
---
Oh ok I remember now you’re the guys that kick teams because they’re called «Bring back AT» or something like that?

---
We've actually had a couple teams try to pick names that fall outside what we as event organizers feel comfortable with.
---
I am the KarmaFleet CEO but let me start with talking about Brave Newbies: Awesome group of people, awesome organization, awesome history of teaching new people how to play the game. If a friend of mine came to Eve and joined Brave I would pat them on the back and say they had done well for themselves.
---
On the subject of KF - We do all of those things as well. We do them with the exoskeleton of the games most powerful Alliance wrapped around us. We have the games largest Corporation Supercapital/Titan fleet.We provide the quickest pathway from new pilot in a griffin to a Titan. We've mastered wealth accumulation. We have an awesome culture. I take our Corp out on Saturday Night Swarm myself every Saturday Night and we have a Corp DJ who spins for us on Twitch. We send about 50 people to Eve Vegas and rampage. 
---
Good luck with your decision you quite literally cannot go wrong.  See you out there.
---
Yes, how dare it be harder to run the sotiyo in hostile space. It's almost as if CCP doesn't want certain leet pvpers with robotic precision and speed to be able loot the wreck with just a dst.
---
The more people playing means more money for the devs. If the hardcore pvp players dwindle too far they wont be able to keep the lights on.
---
It also brings in more people who will potentially dip their toes in and try pvp. It is important to have a safe start before getting destroyed and turned off from the game.
---
It would also be nice to have some safe pve to farm isk before going more dangerous routes. Hopefully they can make it fun, this has always been the weakest part of Eve imo.
---
I am not. But cooking is a fun hobby for me.
---
&gt;Pandemic Horde - no recruiting standards or checks. TBH go anywhere else if you don't want to quit the game. Avoxers, trolls and 80% alts.
---
um lol
---
It's like the memes your grandma forward to everyone
---
I believe https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3r6LzRsuKxlV77mnquc-khxu63_P9L1wtMhTlOqteI/htmlview#gid=163614999. It has a link to his eve workbench as well as a discord which has a ton of information.
---
Do goons need more people this badly? Is tapi catching up and nearing 1/3rd your size?
---
A keepstar is the largest space station that can be produced by players in EVE, and is the only structure that super-capital ships can dock in.  The Palatine is just an upgraded version with higher stats and HP.
---
It's assumed at this point that no one in the game will ever be able to produce a palatine keepstar.  The in-game resources simply don't exist.  On top of that, if, by some miracle it was built, all of EVE would gang up to kill the thing within a week.
---
I'm not in goons. My corporation has 10 to 15 actives at any given time.  Put aside your meme posting for a bit maybe?
---
They haven't let you past trial yet? Feel like you guys have been there for years...
---
Right.
---
Are you saying nothing can ever change?
---
True this.      
---
But it can be solved by increasing the size to expanded orca levels.         
---
Then people running those in lowsec can run orca also rorqual or JF if needed.         
---
The problem with freighter is quite simple.         
---
Freighter is for hauling not for throwing it into combat situation - no matter if this is NPC or player combat.          
---
Orca or roqual can be tanked and can be repped, JF and freighter cannot.
---
Can't have memes, our shit mods have deemed them haram unless they personally like them or a friend posted it.
---
The wind favors "us".
---
KarmaFleet and Brave will eat your babies if you join them too, I read somewhere on the internet.
---
If OP gets down this far: either of the three listed groups are very new-player focused and will give you a leg up while you're trying out living in null-sec. They're built around helping people out, and they're all recognized as being good at that. The differences have more to do with social culture, overall size, and group focus. Being in one of the three groups myself, I'll say that you can't really go wrong with choosing any of them (including the other two) at this point in the game. And TBH, if you try out one and decide it doesn't fit well, either of the other two will still be happy to have you, and no hard feelings.
---
This is like staring at an 8 ball of coke for months and not touching it. Your discipline amazes me
---
Some people are saying it would make goons rule everything, but all that lowsec around it sounds like a lot of spots to dreadbomb and blobs bridge from
---
TIL you are shit at real PvP and have to gank miners in high sec to get kills
---
Are you retarded or just dont understand the concept of vintage style
---
You're a goon lol
---
They do a decent job of that themselves
---
He just looks defeated and over it, he's not re-- Oh I get it.
---
This was me yesterday. Feels like most of nullsec in general. I had way more fun Just roaming with some friends in nano ships, most of us aren’t even in the same Corp anymore.
---
he lost nyx on highsec gate
---
Tbh what the game really needs is groups with the content driver mentality that newer players can join. There's too many stagnant groups in the game.
---
Like these recruiter tools are great and all, but if newbros just join the blob of stagnant players and get bored after a month or two, that's really hindering retention right there.
---
I'm saying they were always a deciding factor, if you brought them or not.
---
Oh, no. Just battleships, and some T2s, I think. Maybe some skills injectors, too. One battleship is sometimes more than one billion after fitting, e.g. Rattlesnake, Nestor, etc. I guess ten of those are close to 100 euros.
---
True, did not think of that.
---
I currently have 4x 27" lgs in 4k being pushed by two vega64 in a custom liquid cooling loop dedicated to the gpus. Runs fantastic, and very cool in the 30-33 celcius range, there is tonnes of room to use in each client. And its not enough.  I'm thinking of adding a larger main center screen flanked on each side by two of the lgs mount one above the other so I have full view of 5 accounts
---
The second is, um... Killing EVE?
---
Maybe I'm reading it wrong but OP doesn't say they can't fly a destroyer, but they were doing mining **for** a destroyer. I took it that they were doing mining to generate isk to buy a destroyer. I know destroyers are cheap but how do we know how much isk OP has or how many hours playtime over a couple weeks? OP was asking how to join a corp, you sperging about what ship they should be able to fly was a bit off topic and not helpful.
---
everyone many think that but, I KNOW I'm on the left side :-D
---
Dark Venture Corporation is a great newbro friendly wormhole corp. It's smaller scale so you won't just be a face in the crowd, you'll get to know people by their voice. They have also some really great vets among them that are always open to questions.
---
I've just started using the Triglavian mutaplasmids and ending up with modules I'm not going to use, but am unable to get an accurate estimate on what they are worth for sale.
---
Been using one siie, but it's stated accuracy for my modules is like . 01%. Any other resources to check?
---
Least this one puts some effort in. 8/10
---
It has been bugged for a long time now, yes.
---
&gt; oh boy. obviously the miner speaking here.
---
Lolno. If I ever come in contact with ganking I'm the one who ganks - though I seldom do it.
---
I don't complain it's too easy. Ganking is fine. I'd just like to see more actual *gameplay* around it. Image a convoy being approached, giving the attackers a shot across the bow, just having some option besides pretty much gank them first (or, admittedly, help concord kill them faster once they are criminal). I realize it's hard to do with eve's rules, but that's unfortunate, IMO.
---
Yes, it's bugged, and it's spelled "trash". In the future, please try the stickied questions thread for posts like this.
---
Gotta stretch past that 5 million alpha mark somehow!
---
Have you heard about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?
---
There is no way to put this cancer into remission that I know of. The only thing you do is slow it down.
---
It's the most annoying thing in this game
---
You make a really good point - by shifting the NS bounty away from ISK (which makes no sense since they're in lawless space), it reduces botting inflation, whilst still providing value, but the subsequent risk of extracting these faction modules.
---
I think the overseer mechanic works well because it forces you to clear the full site (which commits you to coming back if you haven't cleared it), as well as allowing ninjaing of unfinished sites by unscrupulous PVEers.
---
It also gives a secondary market (do I sell them at 5-10% discount to some dude and let him take the risk of taking them to hand them in, or do I do it myself?).
---
The tags that drop are almost always worthless - make them worth more and you reduce a huge ISK tap, which can more easily be scaled to the market (ISK inflation too bad? CONCORD's hand-in price for tags drops, lowering inflation, etc).
---
Yeah why hasn’t it killed astra farming in WH’s yet???
---
Herpagonasyphillaids.  And it itches too...
---
Didn't question the users requirements or state it won't be enough.
---
Simply that in house benchmarks are manipulated. Wait till its released to the public and benchmarked in a more varied environment instead.
---
No way to tell how it will perform in the general public thanks to how manipulated in house tests are.
---
To put it in a simple way the In house benchmarks are on the same level as e3 game shows.  They cheat the system at every possible point to make the image look far beyond what the player will be able to achieve at home. Yes that game was played live on an console on stage and it looked like that, you can't achieve that at your home though because of all the tricks.

Let's pretend for a moment that you don't let your bias show and just look at it from a standpoint of wanting to improve overall mechanics for the purpose of improving recruiting ability and retention.
---
I never claimed it was special. I just liked it.
---
Let's bitch and moan about chat instead. Or blackout. Or lack thereof. Choose and pick.
---
Come on, EVE player base won't be able to cope with anything bigger than  random ±10% to bounties and mining yield.
---
Okay, I don't remember details of your structure from 2013-2014, but either you or your gateway elitepvp corp, whatever it was called, used to recruit from E-Uni boards. Pretty sure I can remember one of the requirements being to an effect of "having established moneymaking on an alt somewhere else".
---
What do I miss or remember wrong here?
---
My point is if you like that sort of thing, there’s a whole world of awesome shots waiting for you to find them.
---
Or... wait a week after it releases for everyone to do their own benchmarks and then you don't have to guess.
---
The era of U-Turn and inconvenience is upon us.
---
Just to summarize :              
---
* How many virtual Gobblons you made today ?       
---
* Is it enough for the SPR you want ?           
---
* Have you sold your ore way under value to alliance buy orders ?           
---
* Have you been avoxed today ?
---
trying it out now, didnt work for me before but this is working now which is cool thanks for the update
---
The rest of the chaos era is in the notes on the desks of all the devs they fired. But hey, they found money to hire some more art folks so there is some new skins in the store!
---
Come to a game just to live in some hole ... nah
---
There are doubtless players that get turned off by getting ganked as well, no one's denying that.  But even if it's as high as 80%, you're better off within the ganked population of (for example) 10% engaging with the game, 10% drifting away eventually, and 80% ragequitting than you are with 5% staying in the unganked population and the remaining 95% drifting away. But the simple fact is more stay than would have otherwise.  You asked how that could possibly be, and I answered.  Whether ganking is good for the game overall is a matter of opinion and conjecture, but any argument against it is not entitled to simply ignore that data point the way you seem to want to.
---
Swapping ammo??? That's balls i shouldn't have to swap ammo
---
More of a technical question but does anyone know how to set it up so I can launch two accounts with different launch settings? Basically I want to launch my main account full screen on one monitor and a second alt account on my second monitor windowed and at a lower resolution. Currently I can only have it one way and then I have to manually go in and change the settings on the second account. The real annoying part is whenever I save the settings on either account it applies it across both of them.
---
Also envelopes on the stairs.
---
no,it would ruin risk vs reward

agreed on some stuff but as a CEO trying to catch people into the corp and not finding anything after 2 weeks and counting i'd like to point some stuff:

\-the recruitment subforum in the EVE forums is a waste of space, you just put a thread and it gets a few visits at best while having to keep bumping it in order to mantain visibility or otherwise the advert gets drown between all the spam
---
\-people joining the game probably dont know about r/eve so they dont know there's also a recruitment subreddit, which it also seems to be non visible unless you change to the old reddit mode
---
\-the corporation window needs a rework (the shortcut was even taken down from the left bar in the Neocom so you now people have to find it), corp adverts are worth nothing if the newbros cant see them from the corporation finder
---
\-joining all the corps in to a single channel seems good in paper but after seeing the use given by people in the English Recruitment channel i hope that proposal includes heavy moderation. we're supposed to advertise our corps, not use the channel for randomly talking shit
---
Depending on who built it it would prob take more than a week but yeah it would be worth suiciding a titan fleet into.
---
I will without a doubt pass my accounts to my son if the game lasts that long. I also plan on living many many more years
---
It's just about wanting personal views to get realized, because of the personal play style.  
---
From my point of view, nothing from your list needs programmers attentions at the moment.
---
At start it was actual purpose of videos. I recorded fights to see what I've done wrong and maybe get a lesson from it. After a while I decided that with some work applied it can be entertainment/lesson not only for me)
---
The devs drowned in krab tears. No more game improvements.
---
you're like a daily salt mine that keeps giving fuck
---
Same reason why regular cynos before werent allowed in highsec.
---
kb stats is a meme and apart from a few very specific cases, always were, at least at a group level. It's just an easy excuse to avoid introspection and saving face
---
sadly accurate. Age of lets force my gameplay wishes on everybody because reasons.
---
Oh man don't buy that! Get your self a 3950 and spend the money you saved on something else. Take this from an Intel fanboy who is upset with how they've been fucking us for a long time

Just doing my part

i need to fit two co-processors II to run 10 accounts.

Memes are good, but the politics is some of the best nullsec content, so you don't want that crap going anywhere. I mean, c'mon. This Vily shit is way entertaining.
---
Now we are getting somewhere with the comments.
---
 I know. This one just happened. I was salvaging, zoomed in a bit and there. There is even an mtu top right, but i photoshopped it away.
---
There is colour theory to consider, composition. So it's not all so straightforward. Don't hate, it huwts my wittwe feewings ;)

Yeah, I have no idea how you let anything sit in your redeeming queue. I'm super anal about grabbing everything free I get sent instantly.

ugh. This is a toxic mentality.

You know what the difference is between A Wormhole and Stain?

Not sure I've ever seen this many typos in such a short StainGuy post. What made you type this so quickly?
---
I thought Blackops can jump/bridge to it too.
---
And why would you want to allow cyno in high sec? To directly jump to Jita and having basically zero risk?
---
Chaos Era made its way to their finances, so it got cancelled real quick.

That’s exactly what he’s advocating for

Which is exactly my point. Don't follow in house benchmarks.

Just wanted to second joining a wormhole corp. I got back about 6 weeks ago and joined 3. Two were a bad fit and the one I'm in now is great, but all of them had fun people and good content including a variety of krabbing opportunities and pvp. If you're isk independent there are several wh corps who only pvp and krabbing is actually not allowed lol
---
It can be jumped onto by black ops battleships, that would be overpowered in HS.

I've been looking more into WH corps the ISK seems to be made there, realistically I haven't played to earn isk in about a year so all of my old ways could be hella out of date! Haha

I think they gave up on Chaos Era when they reversed Blackout.

They’re trolling you by calling you a goon. It is meant to needle at your pride.

EVE-devs never do things the easy way
---
The simple fact that eve uni, PH, TEST,  RVB, and GSF retain so many new players because they have many new player friendly programs is a big point for social investment and player retention in MMO’s.
---
Fweddit used to be this in days of old. Wormbro died, and I haven’t really seen any organized new guy WH programs pop up.

Love or hate their politics, you can’t really dispute this.

When I read your first post, I thought you were implying that there was a bug in WH initialization code that prevented the object from being initialized, but now I see that you mean that some WH grids are simply not being warped to (thus not initialized). Thanks!

It's far easier to shit talk than to come up with a better value proposition and recruiting plan.

Leave skins in the store permanently please?

Bring back the Barleguet days 😛
---
Yes, its a PVP fleet. Used to be just gate camping with huge numbers and a massive blob of Domis but after almost 4 years of uninterrupted Swarms we've gotten a lot better and run a bunch of different fleet comps and from different stagers.
---
Orca should get a Highsec only jump drive, its a capital, built with capital parts, but because of its age does not need the cap skill book, CCP should give it jump in highsec and add it need the cap skill book.
---
My expiration list starts in november ... got some time left ... but i am so unsure which toon to give those SP ... you might need it for something suddenly super important, that might come up simply not today ... an option to extend the expiration date would be nice :D
---
This is good to know!
---
You act like its even the same alliance and brave isnt flourishing.
---
I think the bigger issue was PL turning on TEST/CO2 and evicting them.  If that part never happened, you could have a containment program for the beehive that would have worked.
---
But PL was always more concerned with helicopter dicking people who couldnt compete with their supers than playing the long game.  
---
So here we are.

All 5 of us!

Lies. I met at least 30 wormholers in Toronto!
---
So, I stated playing EvE and Brave was in Catch for the first time when I joined (two or three weeks after starting the game), so I missed the Barley days (and Rhadalon, and Hek).  I feel sad about that, since it seems like I missed out on some good times.  Also, I missed out on starting a game that  really engaged me way too late in life.    
---
Regrets?  I've had a few ;)
---
Right now I feel like the blanket was pulled out from under me and thrown over my head. My heart rate is going up, I need anger management to keep shitposting. That was the chaos era, it is gone.
---
^But ^really ^I ^think ^there ^are ^more ^changes ^coming.

Yeah fuck that feature for not having a fucking off switch.
---
Ever since my supposed newbie corporation formed an all T2 doctrine with two hours warning I save all my gift SP for situations like that. I have about 2.4m sitting uninjected.
---
I get 2B isk/h when I mine salt from our users at work. I've as of yet never been ganked.
---
PL still has a lot of the same out to pasture bulls that haven't played the game for years but still come here to great post multiple times a day and toss in their two prairie oysters worth of valuable insight on the current state of the game so why not keep bringing up old events that were a large contributor to what null is now.
---
Not to mention that with the death of Brave, PL pooped out Horde which replaced PL as releavant and that also has a beefy blue list just like every other group of sassy blobber boys in the game. Eve is a never ending circle jerk cycling through which jerks are doing the jerking, it all comes back around.
---
Oh, that's not even the full list...
---
https://i.imgur.com/Gsryd6l.png

I here that the ratting out where you guys are is quite unsafe? And that folks invade/roam your space very often? How true is that?

Ok, cool! How does one go about applying to KF?

We don't have fleets of ewar newbros but you can still join the main Fleet from day one.

All the perks of brave still exist.

They decided to instead go with the tried-and-true profit levels for Hilmar and Mittani.
---
Wow nice post!
---
I am seeing 75% efficiency from TEST and less ship lost, how is that “Winter Co wipes out TEST”? 
---
Not sure if you mean “Winter Co wipes out, TEST...”
---
“Oh and here’s local back”
---
Init does a pretty good job of retaining people, once the people know who they (init) are.  Y’all have steady content creation and accept a lot of challenges. I am unfamiliar with Init’s new player programs, so I will ask a few of them when I get home tonight.
---
That cant be correct. In China timezone Fraternity cannot be beaten =(
---
Smug Dino poster my friend lol what do u expect?
---
If brave ever had a barleguet/syndicate squad pop up I would move a stack of brawler ships out there.
---
Read the description of the Corporation in game there is a link to apply. Im bad at reddit or I would just link it for you.  As people have said before we have the most robust security checks among the new player groups since we have a lot of things we need to protect so expect a couple days to grind through things. Make sure to follow the instructions on the web page and the less follow up questions the recruiters need to ask you the less delay in timing required. Its always a good idea to spend a few days liquidating your assets wherever they may be and getting yourself in a travel ship of some kind prepared for the trek down to Delve. You dont need to bother bringing a lot of things as the market is without peer in nullsec and can provide anything you may need and you wont have to worry about losing it on the way.  Our shippers will also do 1 free JF worth of stuff from Jita for you once you are in the Corp, you can read more about that on the forums once you get through the previous steps.  See you around.
---
I have not. Please tell me more!
---
Yes. They really are.
---
This is the single most dumb assed argument that comes up on this sub over and over. Didn't Frat and friends bring in skillu and I feel like Tri was in there before their most recent of a series of failscades and plenty of other hefty friends what like a year ago and were totally going to evict TEST?
---
And yet now when Frat is actually being invaded and losing sov suddenly it's ree stop picking on us it's not fair. Eve isn't a fair game. Hell it's not even a fun game, I wish I could RMT everything and quit but I can't fully do it. Once this is all over another group will start fighting and whichever side is losing will call the cyber bully patrol and complain about being picked on and start a #BeBest campaign and a GoFundMe. Then it will rinse and repeat. 
---
But seriously all this whining about blobbing is stupid. We all do it. Goons, TEST, Horde, Frat and Friends when they could, fun old NCPL, hell Black Legion's mobility and spunky attitude and cap heavy members used to be able to sway a conflict, everyone. Sometimes in Overwatch I run into a Bastion with Mercy damage boosting but I don't come to Reddit and complain about how they had double the firepower and logi that I did. Sometimes you get tinkled on and sometimes you're the tinkler but pissing and moaning about it every time is silly af.
---
Grr brave just doesn't have the same ring. :P
---

---
Carry more paste
---
look at op's name yo
---
Haha 🤣 the PL today is not the PL from yesterday. Same with NC. Most of those players have left and joined other big successful groups or gone inactive and started playing other games. Either that or you’re being flair-baited pretty hard. Consider this, some of the corps in PL would’ve never been accepted into PL 3 yrs ago. Good day.
---
Join a nulsec Corp. You won't regret it!
---
Real talk?  If you are interested in ratting in better safety, KF is probably a better fit than Brave.  Ratting is doable with awareness in Brave and most of the time it's fine, but people will probably try and pop you more in Brave ratting space than in KF.  
---
As for invading our space -- I'm not sure what you mean.  Catch and GE-8JV does get a lot of foreign fleets coming down, but... that's kind of the point?  GE-8JV is supposed to be a place where if you bring a reasonable fleet you can get a fight. I mean, I've heard people on comms be told "Don't undock that ship, it's too much, we want to give a good fight and dropping caps is not doing that" (Note that our ability to stop people beyond peer pressure is limited, but we try at least)
---
Seriously, people coming to GE- is a feature, not a bug, of Brave.
---
thank you very cool
---
We don't really have any new player programs that I am aware of. TGrads typically has the lowest bar for entry, pulling a lot from eve uni. But I wouldn't classify INIT as a newer player type entity. If you can get into a bomber you can stuka, but being pigeonholed isn't always fun and we have a wide range of pretty skill intensive doctrines. Moreover, the alliance itself doesn't specifically set the bar, that is left to each of the participating corporations. So long as they don't recruit people like Moonapoon.
---
Awesome! Thank You so much for all the help!
---
Why they no like Elo? He shoots stuff...
---
it's more like if they seriously contest TEST, and win at all, lotta goons will be there in short order.
---
not the goons on the killmail.
---
Cyno changes are still here, though
---
Ok, cool! Thank you very much for the answer!! looking at where I plan on heading I don't know if brave will be the right fit for me. But thanks!!!
---
Fair enough.  KF is a good group, and CONDI usually gives good fights when they roam into Catch.  And, as other have pointed out, you can always change your mind.  Good luck to you.
---
I decline this honor, and accept only the lesser honor of "logidude"

---
As someone who was in Brave for a while back in the day, Barle was/is what most people think of when they talk about Brave’s golden era.  That was some good shit.
---
Chaos era cancelled because the null blocs decided to throw a tantrum.
---
it's satire...
---
That's because you just can't grr at a bunch of baby seals. We're busy doing adorable silly things.
---
Yes, it's a joke. Like Razor.
---
Just keep the shitposting to general /r/eve \- there's a kind of understanding that we have a moratorium on this sort of bullshit for newer players genuinely asking where they should go. If I reply with content-less GRR GOONz! to everyone asking about Karmafleet, it's just dumb: the new player doesn't care about my own eve politics, and everyone who would care isn't reading. 
---
To summarize your own drivel for the OP in a way that's digestible: you think Horde misses out on the smaller community of Brave, and is not as well organized as Karmafleet.
---
He said snigg. Alliance never guaranteed established ratting/money making space outside of moons so it was up to the member to figure out how to finance their shit.
---
you can still have "this cool idea will fix the game" posts *and* memes, jin
---
If anyone can do it goons would be the first of course and the fight itself would break eve completely servers would literally melt ...
---
i said memes not propaganda
---
instead we get ripped off, brainless "fix eve" posts and brainless "no u" slapfights in all threads

Yea that was waffles

A year we try to ensure people can use the companion app, regardless of how potato their phone is?
---
I get that sense, and I am sad to have not been there for them.  That being said... While I miss the days of Brave truly being a sort of newbro monopoly, it's still fun in Catch and Impass, the mission is still there, and the fact that I see people who've grown up in Brave and chartered their career makes me glad.  It may not be the golden era, but it is still a story I like to see continuing to be told.  Like later seasons of Angel compared to early seasons of Buffy, to use an awkward metaphor.
---
I'm sure you would make a much better job.

That's a lot of words just to be wrong

Oh weird you stopped playing and somehow missed that numbers are all that matters now. Shocking that youd not know what you're talking about.

Test on one side, toast on the other.
---
Wasnt there, was kept on the other side of the game until providence called test. I did address this elsewhere sorry if you thought you had some eureka moment that I've now ruined

no one dare to fight the goon super cap fleet. building a palatine KS in your home could be a nice incentive to try anyway

Are you a sniper too?
---
Its a force multiplyer you need to multiply your own force to compensate. Lemme ask you this, how many people is a small gang?
---
Those were alts
---
Blue J is a fun system.
---
The problem is that as soon as CCP makes any changes, i.e. blackout, all the Krabs in goons and other null blocs rage quit and drive the login numbers down so bad that CCP has to reverse the change. CCP is still a company that has to make money. 
---
We are in a catch 22 cycle now.
---
Yeah, sorry. Not so much a bug, but a design flaw. We'll, it was a good idea back in 2003 to go with lazily initialized anomalies, but now-a-days I'm not sure if that helps at all.

Capsulers are a special kind of filthy rich in the EVE lore. They have pods and cloning to be basically immortal. The ships are still full of mortal plebs that are apparently needed to keep things running.

You sound like a destiny player who mainlined all the content in two days without sleep and complains there's not enough content.

Not if they don't have bounties

I kinda like it.  Roleplay it out - the guys manning the gate guns are napping because highsec is supposed to be safe.  All of a sudden a gank goes down waking them up from their slumber.  Disoriented and scared, they immediately begin shooting before they identify the correct target.  CHAOS!!!!

And then flying Rorquals will no longer become profitable so people will stop flying them as much and the economy will return to equilibrium.

Angular velocity is irrelevant for missiles. Same goes for the direction of travel of the target or the direction of the missile/torp. If a missile reaches the target, these details don't matter. It's how the game calculates things. Real life does not necessarily apply.

To sum up EvE politics:
---
Grr gons hat gons
---
TAPI and gons are killing the game
---
FRT are a bunch of botters and also killing the game
---
AoM are botters and also killing the game
---
Gons are a bunch of botters and also killing the game
---
Dead coalition are a bunch of botters and also ruining the game
---
PL/NC. don't undock and something something are also killing the game
---
HRE is dead, RIP
---
Dead alliance is also dead RIP
---
In summary: Everyone is either dead, bots or blue and are all actively killing the game
---
I naively thought blackout signaled a real shakeup with the game, that it would be iterated on and CCP would finally start taking the decline and stagnation of the game seriously. So I PLEXed my shit and here I am.
---
Two months later they've made a whopping two real changes, one of which was rolled back. Now I'm just burning through my networth solo pvping because everyone I knew has left the game.

you mean the panfam that got fucked by dks after deploying to help frt so they left ;)

I think you misunderstand the point of r/eve suggestion posts.

It's not about getting changes actually implemented, or even acknowledged by CCP. It's about beating off onto your keyboard and hoping that you posted an idea that other redditors will like.

More than TAPI has put into standing on their own two feet.

Thats why if anyone ever built it, it would be in a c1. would still get killed in a week by everyone and their mother in t3s and BCs

All over, log in rewards, Special event NPC ratting drops, generally though they are part of holiday events. It's been pretty successful as new bros love it because it lets them catch up much faster and bitter vets like it because it lets them shave off time from super long trains without putting up with the diminishing returns of skill injectors.

so... multi pilot training certificate

But for one pilot
---
This is called attributes implants and accelerator
---
Please stop the rational, good posting. ITT we farm salt, not try to justify it. Please check your privilege.
---
True programmers do it in binary /s
---
&gt; Chaos era cancelled because majority of players decided they did not like it.
---
Why would PL be hurting? They have tons of isk.
---
Pearl Abyss disapproved of chaos.
---
Why not just double the subscription-fee? "No, Hilmar! NO! SIT! SIT!!!"
---
How about local shows number of players but not names or anything else? 
---
You know someone is there, and you have a heads-up if the number blows up as a gank fleet enters the region/constellation so a solo player can still dock up or be on alert, but if numbers go up and down 1 at a time you don't know who is moving around.
---
is ph logo an octopus?
---
lol Brave
---
Seems reasonable. Why all the hate?
---
So, cutting training time in half would magically make 100,000 new players sign up and stay? Please cite references and documentation.
---
I just love to dunk miners in Highsec. I don't know why, it's just fun.
---
No, separate from multi Pilot,
---
Or you could hit the F button.
---
I will remember this.
---
Uhh.. because it's &lt;insert big null bloc&gt; and the rules state that we must hate &lt;insert big null bloc&gt;, no matter how reasonable.
---
My reply also.
---
so are the vni changes.
---
Join VCIUS today or perish. Praise Lord Thaddeus Drake , the Father of Blops, the Holy light that smites heathens.
---
Asset safety it? Or just remote inject?
---
Haha, yeah that is a good strategy. Especially when we come for the Orca
---
reminds me of an old meme, I forgets what exactly but summat about a workman and his tools :)
---
I recommend you start in lowsec. Most lowsec corps do highsec as well for industry and you learn how to survive in a smaller yet more brutal environment. Null created a false sense of security that exists no where else and when shit goes down like the blackout, you aren't wanting to quit the game because you know nothing else.
---
VALK!
---
It’s ok for lower level ones but sucks for anything high/unusual.
---
Drones occasionally ignore commands and go do their own thing. :P
---
Fair. I won Eve like 3+yrs ago...  
---
Eve is still being developed by amateurs who hit a good nerve with a crappy product in a niche with demand for a fix.  
---
The desire for a space game MMO that was harsh made the community resilient and willing to put up with all the shit and just "make it work". In any other field they'd be bankrupt.
---
Yes but paid service.
---
Have you not had enough stupid shit for one year?
---
I’m not affraid to admit this was no effort at all. During my water break at work.
---
The ships gotta burn.
---
THEY HAVE TO
---
FFS, why didnt I see Cebraio already answered that properly?
---
Yeah, the only reason I am hesitant, I just came from an FW Corp and was not my cup of tea.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info!
---
 So please stop explaining
---
Shoot the infidel drone.
---
One big complaint I think everyone can agree on is citadels
---
These were some of my ideas:
---
###Vulnerability
---
* Remove defender selecting day of reinforcement: Timers are too long with this mechanic and practically eliminate weekend fights over structures which is the best chance to get a fight (also helps tz tanking a bit)
---
* Logarithmic damage cap
---
* A citadels resistances are reduced by 30-50% (example numbers) if unmanned, makes unattended structure grids go faster
---
* Bring back entosis (or shooting) of service modules to disrupt them, include one for tether as well (note: disrupting a service module should never make a structure go into low power)
---
###Asset Safety
---
*  Make asset safety free **but** 15-20% (example numbers) of the estimated value of stuff in the citadel drops, ideally this would be a "progressive tax" where players with more (by estimated isk) stuff contribute a higher % of their assets than players with less stuff in the citadel.  This could also be adjusted by region (WH remain at 100% drops)
---
###Anchoring
---
* All structures medium and up must be anchored on moons (more on smalls later).  There would have to be some special mechanics for moving existing structures to a moon (unanchor but rigs are left intact, instant anchor?)
---
* Small (Flex) structures may be placed anywhere but not within 1000 km of another structure, add a new FOB structure that can be a foothold into systems that have all their moons occupied, it would provide tether (if fueled) + limited storage and refitting but no docking (think jumbo sized mobile depot)
---
### Balancing
---
* Jump gates are forced public access, remove the cost of ozone or make the fee a fixed rate which can't be changed based on the player jumping through.  Owners can turn the gates on &amp; off with a 5 min spool up/down.  The goal of this is to make it so that corps can still change the geography of space but it applies to everyone, similar to how the cyno jammer impacts everyone.
---
* I know cyno jammers need looked at, but I don't have any real ideas for them (I wouldn't mind them being removed completely)
---
Just as there's a difference between "Gate" and "Cyno", there's a difference between "Rat" and "Pirate"
---
Or is this just Chaos\_Era V2, expanded to hardware?
---
Dont know, im watching the show from back seat, so entertaning to see people struggle with incopetent CEO of CCP games.
---
Maybe he will remove citadels if u build palatine.
---
Well dudes keep recruiting every new player into the blobs. So it'll be fine. 😆
---
Violates just about every design principle.. but. +1
---
He has to deal with serious medical problems in his family along with a slew of other real life problems. No one in their right mind would think about spending money for a game in those sorts of circumstances.
---
Oddly enough, we were having a conversation about this. If pilots had properly disciplined their drones in the first place, we wouldn't have all these rogue drones running around.   
---
Parenting man..... geez.
---
Rebalancing wasn't ChAoS, it just felt like it because CCP does it so infrequently and only after they've let it cripple their game
---
I farted on my keyboard and that's what came out. You can't control nature Valk.
---
Vily is a pussy it seems.
---
The only reason to wait is if you’re trying to stay under a total SP limit (like the 5m alpha limit). If you’re not doing that, accept it now and just leave it unallocated - you don’t have to decide where to allocate it immediately.
---
Flair checks out.
---
I was in Karma and if you were to join a Null corp, this would be my recommendation. After a couple of months i recommend you look at the Pathfinder sig/squad. You'll learn how to make mad isk that doesn't require mining and krabbing. You'll also learn what is seriously lacking in most null corps and that's small gang warfare. The sig leader has regular classes on manual piloting and the like. 
---
If i were to rejoin a null group, it would be Karma or nothing.
---
You forgot the boson removing the ship
---
Despite a year of opening tickets and trying to get the automod scheduler to work - it still won't update our OP.
---
The correct link to this discord server is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek 
---
Alternative we have a permanent redirect set up at: animeistrash.org/eve    (Yes, that is real)
---
Perhaps not the same if EVE’s technology allows a person to circumvent the whole copying and coin flip theory, but it still leaves some ethical concerns about leaving and entering dormant clones, with the key element being to remove unwanted ones. But we are also talking about a dystopian hyper-Ayn Randian universe so ethics were probably flushed down the loo a long time ago. :)
---
This makes me sad, what did we do wrong. 
---
:pepehands:
---
Tackle that hammerhead!
---
You could meet me.
---
Says mr. anime war himself ;)
---
Why are there T2 command burst modules? They have same stats as T1 except higher fitting requirements AFAICT
---
This would go a long way to newbro retention, which has always been CCP's weak point. Good post.
---
Not daily. Only on his birthday.
---
No. Just no.
---
This is not approved propaganda, The posting by this member on this site is their own and does not represent in any way Who Dares Wins (Including its subsidiaries) positions, strategies or opinions. That being said sometimes we have to let Larry out to drool on the pencil sharpener otherwise he has a fit.
---
You mean like Marshy when he went full hypertension snowflake after the announcement?
---
Nah, im mining with a venture but trying to get all the fitting necessary for my venture and my industrial ship(badger) so i can jet-can more often. Im not really able to to play continuously and the skill to pilot a destroyer is pretty quick but the pre requisite is what taking it long and i just took it yesterday
---
I guess you can blame PL for anything, just not for being prolific shitposters
---
It's kind of sad that /r/eve is filled with "you should all play the game my way" threads.  It just sounds like those posts are created by mouth breathers with corn allergies.  Log in, don't log in, but shut up about it.
---
Will check it out!
---
From the perspective of their killboards, they got 1 kill worth 300m and took 0 losses at 0 cost. NPC losses don't count towards killboard stats.
---
Cat ears please
---
Larry, the soitistic drone
---
Yea it feels pretty empty considering the area I'm at,the science and trade? Occasionally you see some people going out but thats it. Will do check em out
---
Thats true, been watching YouTube vids lately forgot what the channel is called but he is basically summarizing whats in eve university
---
No no no, obviously it was Mittani who bribed Hilmar (though the power of his wizard hat of course)
---
 to protect all of his ~~alts~~ players.
---
Nice ill visit those
---
Yeah but to say that we don't say gate when they are one of the larger concepts in the game is a bit weird.
---
Eve smeve. This is all human history.
---
Which can be destroyed, sending the assets where you cant enter.
---
At the end Imo, the old way doesnt add any fun too fw.
---
lmfao did you seriously just try to flex karma?
---
 **Ravens 3:5 "From the shadows we came, to the shadows we shall return."**
---
What about Constellation chat + Intel Delay?  Channels only update every 10-30 minutes or on YOU changing gates (Lore: "Connecting" to the channel after a jump) means that unless you're actively bouncing between gates you don't see who's entered, but entering the pocket you see who's there.
---
Most people i saw, im not sure if they are npc or not, mining corps that i occasionally see on asteroid belts stealing my ores lol but ive always thought they are npc unless im wrong. Ill check that out!
---
See my other comment which is a reply to the Karma CEO. If you are determined to go null, Karma is where I'd go.
---
I think that as a broad MMO term "Gating" is the process of bringing people from one area to another through a gateway/portal; What we call "Cynos".  However we do have "Gates" that are used as part of world transport, which other places might call "Zone transfer" or something akin to that.
---
show bobs
---
If anyone is interested in my story, and I know it means nothing at all for you, but I will be happy to write it. I also have around 10b in ships/assets, feel free to write here, I will send you some of the ISK/Ships
---
Thanks for explaining exactly why things like injectors were introduced into the game.
---
Go to wormholes, or do some guerrilla stuff in a large scale alliance's staging.
---
You might be missing a smaller scale tightly knit experience.
---
Not if you think karma (especially your tiny plebeian level karma, get on my level kid) matters. I've welped more karma in a single post than you've accrued in your life time. You could say that I'm like, the karma king, of this here thread. When I go to karma court everyones looks up to me and treats me with respect. They know my karma score is far bigger than most, and they know that karma score is directly equivalent to the size of your dick.
---
Best of luck to you moving forward. Dont delete your stuff just in case you change your mind.  : )
---
Sorry to see you go - I'd love to hear your story.  If you want to give something away, I'd be happy to accept - in game name Turd Ferg'Son or Corp "Gamis Associates."  I don't need it, and I just want to hear your story - but I'd be happy to carry on with some of your stuff.
---
small gang solo logi bros wya
---
Never say never, but I can relate to the feeling. I have had multiple pauses in different lengths since 2003-2004. I would advice that you keep you character and assets, just in case. One day Eve might change more to your liking again, and you might then return.
---
Also, if you really want to give away some assets, feel free to send half a bil to my not-main "Eva Sive" if you´d like. I could use that to keep dying to being a poor bad solo PVPer! ;)
---
New Dev: What are we planning to do with the Jove?
---
Old Dev: Go and ask the head of development... \*muffled laughter\*
---
Larry isn't the drone...
---
Probably a cat.
---
2 TRAINZ
---
Here is a thought.  Try creating it instead since this is suppose to be a sandbox instead of acting like a bunch of dumbass WoW players.....
---
Ill try it
---
Awesome I think I am
---
Living in a wormhole isnt about living in the system itself. It's about having the projection through your chain, to get around to other wh groups, or hop out to NS/LS to roam out of, haul in some more ships to explode through a hs connection.
---
Oh please do tell your story :D Also dont give everything away, you never know you might be back. I came back after 10 years.
---
Likewise
---
I is Larry?
---
The war started when Frat violated the NIP they agreed to after the last war.
---
Frat violated the NIP 'cause Russians aligned with TEST were moving in to the space Frat has been trying to take from Test.
---
Exactly!   The bricks they keep on a fallin!!
---
I had the same amount, part of it sitting in unallocated.
---
There'll be a door with 'Head of Development' written on it, but when you open it, you just find yourself in a cleaning cupboard.
---
Unclear. What bias have I demonstrated in requesting a better recruiting tool be made available to all corporations and players?
---
Ohhh, are we not using CRT monitors anymore??
---
TDSIN (A wormhole entity) has it
---
they dit not patch it yet happend today again almost lost a nado
---
Can you give a tldr on skill injector diminishing returns?
---
Has none actually confirmed whether or not they have the BPC for it?
---
Don’t give all your stuff away friend. Trust me I did it once, gave everything away and came back 2 years later. I was furious about the “nano nurf” way back in the day and quit. Came back 2 years later to just see how things are. But just keep your assets move them to jita and o7 till another day
---
CCP RISE foreseen this, temporary angry people leaving the game :D
---
Probably cause it wasn’t fun for those who impact their finances ;)
---
So sorry to see you are leaving, im just returning. If you wish to part with some isk my Lily Tech is a struggling hauler character, if not, be well! You'll be back one day, I quit many times, Always come back!
---
The bonus they provide is like 3% per level instead of 2% so 5% better overall at level 5 of the relevant command burst skill....
---
I understand you always lived in NS and don't find your fun there anymore. did you ever try to live in WH? I mean, realy live inside, not just going through?  
---
It can refreshing. no cap blob, brawling doctrines, mainly small gang, lot's of cloack, loose or win a fight may mean a lot (especialy in home def situation)
---
I agree don't just give it all away. You never know when life will have you wanting to play again. At least keep a small cache of isk hidden somewhere
---
You mean like Capitalism vs Communism? 
---
Both are wrong but neither are willing to admit it? 
---
Yeah, I'd say you're right.
---
Sorry to see you go. Always interested in someone else's story we all have a unique one!
---
Don't give your stuff away just case. You will regret it if you decide to come back if the game makes a drastic change!!!
---
If they truly wanted “chaos era” they should roll a wheel with all alliance names on it once a year. Disband that alliance. Would be interesting. Imagine the frantic wars if test or goons got disbanded
---
We will wait for your your come back.
---
Take care. (fly safe)
---
Considering test has been 1 of the few alliances that have been at war with 1 group or another almost constantly. I find it weird you think they don't want to fight.
---
The cyno changes are more how to deal with some supercap proliferation.  I’m not sure that aligns with chaos.   
---
They could have changed cynos without all the blackout marketing bullshit.
---
Keep all.just in case, or contract it to Harvey Kanjus ;)
---
Your choice but I think you should keep it.
---
Oh and here’s some subs back
---
Plenty of BPCs floating out there
---
Aka fixing the real problems and not doing chickenshit chat channel bullshit.
---
Pretty good, you get upvote!
---
And to think this guy is on the CSM... Yikes...
---
Tuz, what's the ETA on the Goon Palatine Keepstar? Couple months away? :smugdon:
---
No plan survives contact with the ~~enemy~~ players.
---
You are the chaos in the age of choas. 
---
Not blackout not fucking cynos.
---
You are the chaos so start climbing that ladder(or knock it over)
---
imagine having less than 100k total karma are you even human Jibrish? don't talk to me until you're on my level, kiddo.
---
HURR DURR TEST MAN BAD
---
I am sad that you stop playing, but I understand you. This is normal to be bored of a game you played for 10 years. Anyway, feel free to help me blowing ships if you want, my char is Sarg Crowins
---
On paper, a large skill injector gives you 500 000 SP to the toon you use it on.  However, it's only 500k if the toon has under 5 million total SP.  The amount of SP you get from that one injector drops to 400k if the toon you're using it on has between 5 and 50 million SP.  It then drops down to 300k per injector if the toon you're using it on has between 50 and 80 mil SP. After 80 mil SP, any injector used on such a toon will only grant 100k SP, in essence making them horrendously inefficient and costly.
---
Under 40 mil, no negative. 40-55 ish, 20% less. 55-65 ish, another 20%, so on and so forth. So a large skill injector goes 100k, 80k, 60k, 40k. I think 40k is the smalleat it can be
---
While I like the thought, it sounds like it would be a rather awkward thing for people to understand.
---
That'll happen if the speaker thinks indy groups and miners are weak, sure. It's still a pejorative term, and if you see it used to describe a corp or alliance's support crew that's a good sign the speaker has no respect for the support crew.
---
But then you have to wait forever if you want to see stats on one of your fit modules.
---
That’s a pretty good pathway imo. Init uses a lot of advanced tactics.
---
Trig Blops Pls
---
I'm sorry, but your reality conflicts with their narrative.  So reality must be wrong.
---
I was there, in rahadalon. Was a clusterfuck of great times. I still have an operation out of there for nostalgia sake. It feels sad seeing raha with an empty local.
---
Call it the "Velnias"
---
ANIME WILL BE SPREAD BY THE SWORD
---
My solution is use that slider liberally.
---
That is actually a pretty reasonable nerf to bombers.  It messes with boosh bombers but less with bridging bombers which I like.
---
Hi Larry! \*waves\*
---
&gt;Suggestion 2: Increase the cap on alliance contracts a character can make.
---
Yes please
---
I can never remember whether gas harvesting is an Omega-only skill. If it's available to alphas, there is great money to be made gas huffing. It's not hard, but there's a bit of a learning curve. A budding industrialist won't be able to connect their mining output to anything though. You'd just sell the gas and buy something else for whatever you're building.
---
I have noticed this too.  Seems like every update that box resurrects itself.
---
This needs to be a meme
---
Why won't CCP's artists do game balance :thinking:
---
True, we still have people in this game that believe that the people at Jita actually double their isk.
---
Lowsec and WH’s need more chaos
---
4ly range maybe?
---
I liek th drool
---
Lot of em exist. I bought one for lulz on an auction contract.
---
Wouldn't fitting a point mean you'd have a lot more trouble tracking the cruisers, as they'd be able to MWD around even while grappled?
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) 
---
Join that one. There is no better place for new players. The corp's HR department is real people who have limited time to do game stuff, some of which they want to spend on actually playing the game rather than doing HR stuff, so it'll probably take at least a few days to get everything sorted out (even though they take basically everyone, they'll check to see if you're a spy and interview you to make sure that your story adds up, the interview is around an hour).
---
That's how we got citadels.
---
Been logibro once.  Got booshed and blobbed by test on that roam.  I have not once had a good experience in Catch/Estoria.
---
I'm new to the game (started playing yesterday) and I'm baffled by the sheer dimensions of this game. I had so much fun yesterday just mining and doing the agent missions the tutorial railroads you to. This game is so much fun and I was thinking the entire day about what I want to do when I get home and can play again (I think I want to check out Jita). 
---
As I sat at work thinking about Eve, I thought to myself to check out this place, since I was lurking on reddit anyway. When I came here I was looking for guides and tips or generally memes I'm too nooby to understand. Instead I found a bunch of posts criticizing the Devs because of something about Citadels and Injectors(?).
---
So anyways my question is whats that all about? Why is there semmingly so much backlash? And is it even worth it getting into the game at this point?
---
Send Bils to Snafu457.
---
CCP looked at the bottom line numbers.
---
I'm pretty sure that whoever builds it will probably AWOX it the second the timer is done.
---
If not, the fight will be huge and everyone on grid will probably fight to the death for that killmail... including whoever anchors it.
---
I won't lie, I hope someone anchors it in the middle of absolute nowhere, Nullsec and does nothing but fuel it. No ratting, no mining, no jumping into the system, put it off d-scan and just wait for someone to find it.
---
im sure there is an easy way, but have you disabled that monitor in windows, then open eve and launch the client, once the client is open, re-enable the monitor.
---
Good Sir.
---
You have my upvote.
---
Lmao, imagine still asking for Chaos era
---
Edited for clarity.
---
I actually presented an academic paper on this, and presented it at the Western Political Science Convention, so I must disagree. Eve is superficially a spaceship game, but at its core, it is a geopolitical simulator that demonstrates how material conditions (in the form of game mechanics) affect the types of institutions (and virtual states) human beings form.
---
Use a miasmos Gallente industrial instead of caldari. Till your ready for t2 gall is the best. Caldari t2 has the most tank tho.
---
Jet can mining isn't the best alot of people just dick around and steal ore. They only get a suspect timer for lewting your can.
---
That being said move to a less populated system. More ore for you less people to mess with you. Also try to mine moons they yield better ore than belts. Ice is also another good item and easier to skill towards than max ore mining.
---
Send isk to ”derth” !!!
---
Jita bottom feeder: "Fixing UI Bug is a nerf to my way of making isk by scamming new players"
---
Also Jita bottom feeder: "Casually mining once in a while as a social activity is a shitty thing to do and not a legitimate way of making isk"
---
Obligatory: can I have your stuff?
---
Hey buddy that’s a lot of assumptions right there: development, head, reading something about the game... Come back to reality this is Eve we’re talking about.
---
you can always tell when somebody has lost an argument, they start bringing up shit not related to the argument at all.
---
Definitely share your story bro. IGN —— Science Guy McResearch
---
Basically nobody is hated enough for a dog pile atm...
---
Go play PUBG and get your pvp jollies off in skin-tight girl pants and a pink bandolier while wearing a welding mask. Sounds like your cup of soy-milk infused tea.
---
You'll be crying a river of salty tears when CCP makes local in wormholes.  Careful what you wish for.
---
Richard Head, but everyone calls him 'Dick'.
---
Well you have to give it one toon, you cannot swap it to another toon on the same account :D
---
Say it ain't so
---
Anyone wana buy a suitcase nuke - I mean pocket doomsday?
---
Isn't he a wormholer?
---
First question: Do you have multiple profiles set up for your accounts? If so, click the gear icon next to your profile in question and make sure the right profile is checked. 
---
Once you launch using the selected profile the settings per profile will be maintained. Its possible it was reverted to default after the patch. 
---
Hope it helps.

---
Nice /r/eveporn
---
I'm going to address your questions in reverse order. Hope that's ok. :-) Also, welcome to EVE!
---
Is it worth it getting into the game at this point? Absolutely.
---
Why is there backlash? Hard to say. Pretty much anything CCP does elicits some kind of negative reaction in this subreddit, and the negative is generally more visible than the positive.
---
What's this specific instance about? The Citadels and Injectors thing has been going on for years. Basically, capital ships have been pretty dominant lately, and some folks have concluded that skill injectors are to blame for making capitals dominant *and widespread*. There is also a common belief that citadels are spammed too much throughout space, making certain parts of space too safe and/or too annoying to attack.
---
Those are pretty old news though. You're probably seeing posts talking about the "blackout" and the "cyno changes", both of which are recent changes made (and unmade in the case of the blackout) that have substantial effects on daily life in null security space. They are quite controvertial, and again the negative reactions tend to be more visible than the positive ones.
---
Why won't CCP draw down the arts team a little to hire more devs.
---
More like why won't CCP hire people to do balance and take it out of the apparently-limitless art budget
---
CCP has been pouring concrete in the sandbox for years
---
Even better, it's just a door knob and a frame. The door is painted on.
---
Chaos Era has relocated to the "*CCP's Accounting Region*" where the bottom line has been restricted to overhead cost reduction and profit margins are now experiencing blackout because your Chaos Era ideas were so incredible!
---
*cough* CODE *cough*
---
Shit post before 8PM?
---
&gt;With your security status in the negative, it is normal mechanics for sentry guns to attack you.
---
GMs don't know game mechanics? That's a shocker.
---
Never. I'll assume.
---
BUT HOW DOES THIS HELP ME KILL AFK RATTERS EASIER??!
---
sorry you got no sense for humor. 
---
unfortunately you wouldnt recognize smug even if it cameby and smugged you in the face
---
Hey thanks for playing and wish ya the best mate
---
So what are you going to play now
---
pbuh
---
We all win with free skill points.  It's not a competition. :)
---
Why is the miasmos better than the badger? Im just wondering since I was looking for industrial and I noticed badger have a bigger cargo hold but miasmos was actually my first choice.
---
Regarding the Jet can mining, I usually try to find a asteroid belt that doesnt have any player mining(by warping to each one of them one by one lol) and somehow it went a bit good to me I usually get around 2mil isk worth of ores for 2 trips which for me I think is pretty okay but my venture kept on dying, i keep on warping on a bunch of nps like those invader aliens I forgot the name but One shot my venture lol
---
I might consider ice mining but im not sure where to or how to find a moon to mine?
---
Can only fly big ship if you follow alliance rules? Will be killed if you don't, must pay sub for recon and fax or you will be killed by your own alliance if you rat in a titan? What a load of garbage, I pitty anyone who bows and scrapes to draconian nullbear BS like this. Eve should be fun. This sounds like a policy document at work.
---
I would love to read it. Acemac
---
sentence one is correct.
---
We are certainly not desperate though. We planned for 6-12 months and we just pushed past month 3 so we got lots of time.
---
you mean boosh ravens
---
Sounds pretty good, Its pretty good to know they do interviews kinda make it feels like a job
---
What about the little guys though?
---
Sorry to see you go bro, but now is probably a good time.  Look back in a few years I would put money on you made a better decision than me.
---
im not saying we don't work with them from time to time. But we are under no obligation to show up. It's Friends asking friends (FC to FC usually) for help
---
won't lie I raged so hard that I quit for a year about not being able to whore on a keepstar when in a logi because the fc told us not to move till it was too late.   
---
fleet lasted 4 hours with almost 900+ blue in system no one showed up to defend all I wanted was something showing I was there. so often I have been in fleets any my billboard is very bleak because most fleets I just heal people. So now I don't fly logi I fly sabres which is much more fun.

This may give you insight into our mentality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fprzCHwN6P8
---
I hate to break this to you, but when was the last global war, or major war between super powers or major powers? Right here in real life? I will answer for you. 80 years ago.
---
This is because, the benefits of peace far outweigh the costs of war in the real world as much as they do in EVE. More so even.
---
You won't notice a difference between them. In delve you see more consistent faces and campers, brave sees more random and roamers. Goon SRP is very good. Brave's new player resources are probably better. Neither is great at pvp.

Hi this seems like a great place to ask; what race industrial should I train?
---
Miasmos has an ore hold instead of regular cargo. So it at max holds like 60km3 in ore I believe. Where the badger is what one can full? Around 20-30km3 barge hauls items miasmos hauls ore. All the Gallente ones have a special bay instead of regular.
---
Trig's? Or just regular NPCs? Trig are hard and well beyond a ventures.. paygrade. Altho normal NPCs you should be able to launch a drone or two and kill them but again trig are to hard for you. There's a good way to tell if they are in system if the system name shows up in some hyrogliphic shit. That's an invaded system. Get out of it it's to hard for you unless you've got a fleet.
---
As for ice mining check the agency it shows where active ice belts are. They spawn in the probe scanner page. Not on overview. They aren't regular astorid belts.
---
Your welcome to message me pvtly if you want to know more. Reddit is to public for me to give a name or anything lol
---
It was actually a decent way to find PVP 5-10 years ago. Beacons were restricted by shiptype, the rules were generally followed, and there were enough people online that you could usually find fights in your shipclass.
---
Now it's a ghosttown with the only content being the test server autists killing people with supercaps. Oh well.
---
Montolio says what?
---
Have you tried borderless windowed mode? That’s the only way I know of rearranging the clients. Let me know if you figure it out.
---
If by "shakeup" you mean make people say "This is retarded" and quit the game, I guess?
---
nice second galaxy picture... oh wait, its just eve
---
They gave up because of all the null alliance tears so you can thank them for game going down the shitter 😂😂😂
---
+1 for hearing your story, the stories of Eve are some of the best in any MMO. I agree with keeping at least most of your stuff incase you come back but if you want to give it away anyways I wouldnt turn it away. IGN Bimbol Bumfuzzle
---
I want to piggy back this...
---
CCP allow us to generate a QR code that players can print for recruiting (in conjunction with the link). 
---
Imagine, using a promo to print 100-200 free business cards... with Corp info and QR code. Or maybe legit business cards or flyers.
---
Recruit creates an account and scans in QR code as if it was the link.
---
Chaos era is over for now.
---
Expect new chaos in 2023 , when they gonna revert back the cyno change.
---
Are you the type to think that since you ganked a max yield hulk, that you must be good at pvp?
---
people not logging in wasnt the blackouts fault . if anything it helped people logging in
---
What’s your temp when running the three clients?
---
just move ur shit to ls/hs when u will be absent for a long time
---
&gt;Disassemble some of the popular scams and you quickly see most depend on some piece of information the scammer has that the victim is lacking.
---
Yes.
---
&gt;all scams to some degree depend on the UI being shitty
---
Not even close
---
Any easy way to improve newbie retention is to allow for corps to add tags to them, so people can actually use the corp search function.
---
Getting players into eve doesn't equal getting them into a mega alliance or even any player corp, it equals the players actually playing the game. 
---
Player corps provide information and more importantly things to do for a new player, but the game can do that and can do it better. 
---
Player corps should not be covering in areas that CCP is lacking when CCP can do better.
---
Sorry. As far as I am concerned, Abyssal stuff represents everything that is wrong with current Eve development.  Instanced pvp and pve - I hope it dies in a fire.
---
Chaos era was only chaos for pve players, pvp players so no change or buffs to their operations.
---
This is very strange, that system was almost always a drone region rental system, which were famous for russian bots. also living in null sec without alts and only 10 bil in assets after a decade. don't leave now, sounds like you have much more to experience, and unlike new players, you are in a great position to change your play style as you please. if you dont wish to, thats another issue altogether.
---
My personal (biased) recommendation would be to look into Pandemic Horde. But if you're choosing between Brave and Karmafleet, then you probably can't go wrong. Both are very new-player focused and will have their own ways of setting you up in null-sec and giving you instruction and things to do. Regardless of where you land, it usually isn't a big deal to move to another new-player centric corp if you feel like you don't quite fit in after a week or two, so there shouldn't be any stress about making "the wrong" choice right now. The main thing is that you should have fun and be around people who foster that enjoyment of the game.
---
chaos era went bye bye with lack of people logging in
---
Can we collectively move beyond this sort of posting?
---
Where is the gila.
---
&gt;lso "everybody I don't like is a bot"
---
He warped away after I pointed him, therefore he is a cheating asshole who fit a warpstab, and thus warpstabs should be removed. I, on the other hand, should not be told to bring two points, a scrambler, a dictor, or a hictor next time.   
---
Things should only be done to the game that allow me to kill people easier with no effort on my part.
---
And flying tackle blows. Pushing newbros to that role hurts their chances of showing up for the future. They get primaried, and then get lost on their way back to fleet. Sure its a low sp route to combat, and incredibly vital, but it feels useless when you are in the thick of it.
---
Yes. See they've even made r/eve bots now.
---
Android App bundles (required for Google Play as of last August going forward) contain both a 32 and 64 bit version, and are set up to tell Google Play which version the user's phone supports so that the right version is downloaded.
---
Personal recommendation is to try and set this up on an internal test track sooner rather than later.
---
Edit: a typo
---
I'm no PHd, but my short answer would be that 75 years is historically an insignificant period of time 
---
Also more importantly, I think the particular analogy you're drawing here between Eve and the real world is comparing apples to oranges. We all agree that in the real world peace is preferable to war, which brings suffering. But we're talking about a game here 
---
If peace was the ultimate good in Eve, like in the real world, then we could just petition CCP to abolish all combat mechanics and get it done with. Then we could have the happy and relaxing game of industrial tycoon and model UN in space online. Sign me up
---
They ran out of on/off buttons to push and now have to figure out how to do actual code changes... 
---
Except in Eve when you lose a great war your alliance hasn’t lost almost the entire population of young men needed to make an economy thrive. You can just respawn your man power. That’s the main reason ‘global’ conflicts don’t happen much anymore. It’s easier to control resources than trading for them (example the USA), except that man power thing tends to force countries to hesitate, considering in the real world man power is a resource you have almost no control over. You’re right on why it makes sense IN REAL LIFE, but not so much in Eve. Maybe you’re too invested in Eve?Maybe goons just can’t separate reality from a video game anymore.
---
"Chaos Era" turned out to be "Lose 1/3 of our subs and then panic era".  Whodathunk
---
Those people you see in space that you can't catch, on reddit here we call them bots.
---
Pretty sure they have like 90%  art tards and maybe 3 dudes that actually work on anything else.  It's no wonder that more thought gets put into SKINS than the rest of the game put together.

Theres evidence supers and titans were used
---
It was a shakeup.  It shook up their profits, and they don't like that.
---
They decided they like money from subscribers more than they like cHaOS.
---
hey send mone to Trashy Manne I've just picked up this game last month and it would be cute like one player in one player out :P
---
Unfortunately it also delays the few tooltips you may actually want to see.  This is just another failed abortion in a long line of failed abortions called the CCP UI Team.
---
Everyone saying why it won't be built instead of answering his question. He asked for how its different compared to normal keepstars
---
Wait.... why haven't we fixed standings with those jerks? They should be red.
---
Also, what are the krabbers doing in the elite pvp fleet? ffs, go over to standing if you arn't coming to dunk those F1 monkeys. And let me know if there is any good goo out, I need to make some isk after this guaranteed killmail.
---
To piggyback, is there one for sancha sites? We connect to their wormhole every now and then and i feel lost running them.
---
&gt;I naively thought blackout signaled a real shakeup with the game, that it would be iterated on
---
When has CCP actually iterated on anything. Their plan is to release, then move on to the next thing.
---
I should've known better

See you later. o/

More, but not a lot more. Leshak have nice tracking, grappler gives nice slow, with proper movement most of cruisers is not a problem.

You must not remember b0pe, blue labs, trif, or tundragon

I will fight you over this, to the death.

Shit bait
---
Keep your stuff. Maybe things will change a couple of years down the line. It happened to me. Though if you are really insistent on giving your stuff away might I suggest that you donate some to Signal Cartel? They provide a good service and help newbies get into the game.
---
Does it though? Gila is in the top right cross section, true the brightest part of the frame is not really well placed, but it still looked okay to me. Could've placed the logo a bit better. I'll admit to that.
---
Your English is great. I'm new to the game but know the feeling leaving big parts of your life behind. Feels like losing a friend sometimes. Seems like you're ready to move on tho. Enjoy your next phase. Save ur stuff or give to someone who knows how to use it... but ign PringleCan Johnson
---
As someone that rats and mines quite a bit it is safe. We have Catch which is a little more wild has neutrals coming through from time to time etc and then we have impass which is more pve focused and if anything comes they get cleaned out. As long as you are paying attention to local, Intel channels, and on comms you will be fine. You will lose stuff from time to time but if you are smart about it that should be pretty rare.

Really. He's already admitted openly he could buy out CCP with his credit card. Only issues I see with him are illusions of grandeur.

Can only rat/pve in a big ship if you meet those requirements.

Offensive titan/super requirements aren’t that strict.

This is just a discussion of what people are doing. 
---
Can’t be saved if you don’t have your own cyno. I imagine that its no fun trying to save the rorqs, supers, titans of people who don’t bother putting in the basic effort to make themselves saveable. If they don’t put in the effort to be a part of the solution, then they are deemed part of the problem.

You sound like another mad hunter who wants easy kills. God forbid people be expected to put in effort.

Congrats on kicking your addiction!! Best of luck to you!

Only thing to guess at is how much did Notaus pay you all to date to join his alliance.

What...

No seriously...

i know right
---
Sounds like an impressive run. Hopefully the game continues to change and grow to someday draw you back. Playing for nostalgia and (in my case at times) respecting the investment in time sunk is tough. Knowing when to step away is a powerful and constructive thing.
---
If you decide to change your mind don't think anyone here considers it a hypocrisy. Hate to see you go, but glad you do so with a positive attitude. With that in mind, it will be a loss for the community.

I understand the way you feel.

What's the most efficient method of grappling fast frigates/destroyers scramming around me if my weapons consist purely of heavy or cruise missiles and drones (or any long range weapon for that matter)?  Heavy Stasis Grappler?  I don't quite want to refit the entire battleship as a tackle platform, just a method to control the occasional fast ship.
---
It seems like directional grappling would not work too well for me, wanting more of an AOE "slow it all down" type thing.
---
Or, do I just stay as-is and have Praetor II drones go after the little guys?  This is more a PVP situation I'm asking about than PVE (fast rats).
---
I always enjoy hearing other players' expereince. I welcome your story.
---
No
---
Actual helpful response
---
In spite of all that the pcu was going up in 2011
---
Web drones
---
That'd be partially fixed by getting rid of asset safety in nullsec. At least you'll be grinding space for the phat loot.

SMALL GANG GOOD

DM me your login info I’ll take up your fight

Rule of thirds mate
---
The pvp backbone disagrees
---
No matter what you do, your slow, lumbering Rattlesnake will be easily kited by frigates and unable to apply meaningful DPS with its primary weapon. Light drones are your best defense.
---
It's an NPC.
---
The what?
---
Hold the ree, buddy, it's an NPC.
---
When you join a corporation, try to find one that is in your tz and does activities that you like. And make sure that they interview you on voice coms. With the exception of Signal Cartel and maybe a few others, most regular corps are held together by banter.
---
Yes, and it follows the rule of thirds... mostly. As i said, the brightest part is not at the thirds, but it's not the focus of the shot. Even though it does take the full lower third of the frame as a background. All it lacks is a middle ground. Sun as bg (lower third) , some middle which it lacks, and the gila in the top third. Eve logo is to the side, although it does attract a bit more attention.
---
Rule of thirds mate...
---
I mean I get it that it's a joke based on EVE's behavior, but the comments here perfectly fucking encapsulate why /r/eve is a joke now.  The ""everyone I dont like is a bot"" never actually saw someone make this argument.  This subreddit has become a strawman argument manufacturing machine and is absolutely the worst place to go to engage with our fellow players.
---
That violation is still arguable to me as the structures in question weren't actually related to WinterCo in anyway. I was shooting one anchoring from the same corp on the same day in Detorid.
---
That said that was under a month before the NIP was due to end and so still not "last year"
---
And actually come to think of it there is a slight flare coming from the sun, so accidental tie in bg to fg.
---
That's not what the rule of thirds means but ok dude. Not a bad shot, just saying you could do with some better composition is all :)
---
Isn't it more like "our great leader bla bla" and "our great blues leader bla bla"?
---
Karma denied my app as a new player. Joined horde, 3 years later now I’m multiboxing soups for horde and dunking on liberty squad with ustz bros :)
---
Most content rich area in the game, our systems are always in top 5 for shit destroyed. Always a fight to be had! Lots of money for indy people $$$$
---
Excellent.  Thanks!
---
It doesn't. The rule of thirds splits the shot into 9 rectangles via 6 lines. 3 horizontal and 3 vertical. The intersections of those lines are where you generally place your subject. Photography 101. What i was explaining to you is a bit more advanced composition, but sure, nice try :)
---
Not sure about you, but photography has been a hobby for a while :)
---
Even shot a person or two 😂😂
---
It's a slower, lumberinger Typhoon - thanks I will look into better drones for that sort of situation.  Much appreciated.
---
it's a revolving door with only one entrance/exit
---
yes short term rewards vs sustained growth.
---
Hey man you should keep your stuff in case things change and you want to come back, who knows right. But I would love to hear your story, as a newer player I really feel like I missed the glory days of Eve and all the stories that come with it. If you do want to donate some money with the story my IGN is Gregory Torkelson
---
wasn't it something like "We were trying to see if it would prevent botting and it worked for a short time but then they fixed it so we decided to reverse it anyway"?
---
Go back to PlanetSide. At least your shitposts of 'point carbine at enemies head' would be less toxic there.
---
i hope ccp makes stain lowsec

They need to go around the speed of the ships you seem to have trouble with.

Thanks dad. Ill leave you to your bubble.

Always happy to receive isk @ CraftyCroc

Good luck moving on o7
---
People enjoying the game generally dont come to reddit to say so.
---
Yeah do that.
---
grappler is the best choice.
---
But also smartbomb.
---
Tbh that says very little about flying Logi, more about fighting dinosaurs :)
---
It's 4 lines actually, and 6 rectangles, my bad 😂
---
Yeah stopped playing three months ago. The amount of shit i had around was too much to use hauling services. Gift them all to corp members.
---
Yes, but this happened because of CCP. They created set of rules and mechanics allowed huge empires appear. Now yes, they have not much of freedom to fix all of this but it’s them who is to blame. Not players.
---
Very equal with goons coming for tests help.
---
Any scam can be prevented with good UI design ( well any scam that depends on information hiding ) now the question is how protective does the game UI have to be for the players.
---
Now the current design very much is in the protective mindset and it have been for a long time the whole notion went downhill when CCP introduced safety settings tbh.
---
2009 Player here. Just take a break. 
---
A year or so off can make a world of difference.
---
Yes, but these empires appear because mechanics allowed and even encouraged it. Now it might be too late for CCP to do anything but it’s them who’s to blame. Not players.
---
I wouldn't say panfam wants blues but they NEED blues because of goons and test jerking each other off.
---
I make Eve videos. Could I make a video of your write up? Ingame character is Cloudspitos
---
its easy you can always teleport your stuff to the closest lowsec station with three clicks
---
just keep that option while no longer doing it automatically upon citadel destruction ez
---
Where's Hedliner when you need him to stir up the chaos with his trident?
---
The thing about the other organizations which claim to cater to new players is that most of them are scams and the rest are NullSec entities. While NullSec entities have pretty good benefits, they're also pretty restrictive. There will be a lot fewer people to shoot at if you're in one of those. You will be pointed toward specific activities (primarily either farming anomalies, which is the type of PVE combat most common in NullSec, or mining ore with occasional fleet participation). E-Uni doesn't provide much in the way of NullSec-specific stuff (closest you'll get in there is living in NPC Null), but there are a number of different things to help you figure out what you like doing.
---
http://prntscr.com/p8d4hh
---
in general its 1vs 2 from screen :D
---
&gt;That violation is still arguable to me 
---
"Don't shoot structures here, don't place structures here"
---
Places structure there, shoots structures there.
---
"That is still arguable to me..."
---
&gt;so still not "last year"
---
Did you misread "last war" as "last year"?
---
art people, marketing and sales are probably the only jobs nuanced enough to survive acquisitions.  unless they worked on the original source code or have some kind of legendary notoriety, software engineers are lined single file out the backdoor and shot one at a time.
---
Test has no use for the space and really if they can get NIPS with the people there rather then to deal with having to find some shit tier alliance to install there it makes there job a lot easier, 
---
The reality is Test wants shit tier alliances there because they can pretend to have ability to PVP, but they want to get farm animals there that won't use there teeth to hurt anything test really cares about, it's not a good deal for the smaller entities around FRT but it's also the only deal there gonna get.
---
If you want a small alliance that occasionally pvps, Pandemic Legion would be a good choice. You'd learn how to dock up and flee from fights which can be useful.
---
Once you get a feel for it you could graduate to Karma Fleet, Brave Newbies or Dreddit.
---
I didn't but thanks for your concern.
---
For now.
---
It covers the rise of any new ones later.
---
As if they would read that list, even if they existed.
---
From a citadel that those services won't go to?
---
"a real fight"
---
yikes
---
Right on, got it.  Surrounded by frigates orbiting at 1500km, detonate smart bomb.  Will post results.
---
How fucking poor do you have to be to ask for reimbursement on a thrasher?
---
This sub might as well bet TAPI's forum.
---
Thought you quit for good?  Or was that just the usual salty reddit post for karma?
---
You talk like you would stand any chance without sucking goon dick.
---
CCP loves their real fake doors
---
That makes sense.  That's kind of where I was having trouble picturing an AOE type grapple they can just fly out of the "bubble" right?  If a drone is chasing them around webbing should be better?  I think Heavy Stasis is a 10km effect though if I'm not mistaken.
---
The door doesn't open. Just like captains quarters
---
Gig’em
---
Honestly you shouldn’t give your stuff away. In the off chance you do come back you will appreciate never being generous and giving it all away.
---
When 'NewBro Corps' are flying supers and titans, can you still call them 'NewBro Corps'? They were mostly filled with alts of blue-donut members from the beginning anyway. They were hardly ever 'NewBro Corps' even from the beginning.
---
Bubbles don’t impede speed, only direct web/grapples can do this. Scrams can shut off mwd’s, but have extremely limited range.
---
All the best mate, While I haven't meet you or know you, your contribution to the game has been appreciated and has added to the enjoyment of Eve by many others. Fly safe and we'll see you in 6 months :P NO ONE EVER LEAVES EVE! believe me I've tried lol. o7
---
9980XE is a terrible buy no matter how you swing it. It's overpriced and underwhelming.
---
9900K is great, although probably overkill unless you're playing other games AND pairing it with an NVIDIA 2080 or better.
---
3700X would be ideal, with the 9700K being an okay alternative. 8 Cores / 16 Threads, clockes well, plenty of omph for most things you throw at it.
---
I mean when you blue 40k people 600 pilots ins't that much.
---
Horde has changed a lot from my time there but they have really built themselves into an amazing resource. They have excellent leadership and really want newbro's to improve at the game.
---
Batphoning the largest coalition ingame as the second largest coaliton to figth a coaltion maybe half your size is a clear sign they don't want to fight.
---
The cats represent the layed back attitude of all pilots.
---
Imagine believing that Legacy/FI.RE would need help with Winter Co. without northern shitheads here. Goons wouldn't even be here without PanFam showing up to every big WC timer.

Asset safety is fine, having it as a Citadel mechanic is however not.
---
Friendship Friday nice thread came a day early, lol. :)
---
Got it.

Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way then.  If I'm ratting in this ship and get tackled by a swarm of frigates with dictors - maybe I should look more into "best way to GTFO" maybe an MJD.
---
No such thing as a glass ceiling in CCP - just a fake doorway to your new office when you get promoted.

Haha. I’ll trade in the 2002 truck I was driving for this one. But not my car though. I like my car. 
---
And yeah, it’s cool to see other people that play the same game as us, especially when the player base is as small as it is, especially in the USA.
---
If you go afk for three months, should you assume by default the structure will blow up? What if it doesn't? What if you only go afk for two weeks?
---
CCP needed to follow up the blackout by being doing something about citadels, which everybody has been saying are broken for a long time now. Instead, they backtracked on the 1 change they made and we're back to square one
---
Being in space, especially null space, should feel scary. You should feel like danger could be just around the corner and that being docked is a relief and a luxury. Even from a lore perspective having no communication beacons in null make sense
---
The blackout needs to return, but CCP's vacillation will make it harder to re implement in the future (louder whining)
---
Don't give it away. I gave away my super and am regretting it.
---
So you know you can redeem It and it not apply to the character as a skill just as a bank of skill points for use later. Redeeming it just puts it on a specific character not instantly applying to skills
---
&gt;Sadly, I feel the game changed too much and I no longer have fun in these activities
---
In what way do you feel like they have changed?
---
Is that the same time PL started accepting anyone in?
---
I look at it more as "if I need a skill immediately later I can use it then." Of course keeping them in the redeeming queue only works if you have multiple characters on the same account too.
---
No thanks, it’s got nothing of value. We already taken the best bits
---
The cyno is l... Oh wait.
---
Good luck in future endeavors

Yawn , why can’t people just quit in this game and stop posting these stupid ass posts! Bye enjoy wow!
---
Fly safe man!
---
These have become equal to the people that tweet out a long thread on why they're leaving twitter... No one really cares. Just go and be at peace.
---
What people haven’t noticed is TAPI are making the worlds biggest conga line
---
"A camel is a horse designed by committee."
---
You said you quit and the game wasn't fun anymore....
---
It’s just good old sci-fi
---
If you have less than 5 million skillpoints you gain the full 500,000 skillpoints (100% worth).
---
If you have between 5 - 50 million skillpoints you gain 400,000 skillpoints (80% worth).
---
If you have between 50 - 80 million skillpoints you gain 300,000 skillpoints (60% worth).
---
If you have more than 80 million skillpoints you only gain 150,000 skillpoints (30% worth).
---
You forgot everyone in PH is a spai.
---
Why I cannot light cyno on my vanquisher wont even let me online
---
Can confirm, I start playing the benny hill theme every time I jump into GE-
---
Haul your stuff with test freight for when you get back. Shaddup, cya when you get back
---
I mean, the big cut is actually PI instead of t1 minerals
---
You really should keep your stuff. This is a hard game to leave behind forever, there's nothing else like it.
---
riskless looting is retarded
---
There's one in Cstat with a Poitot travel sticker. Gig'em!
---
This guy gets it.
---
Gig'em, Horns!
---
Thank you. I’m have the same problem.
---
Yeah anyone believing that shit is just being obtuse

Futures in EVE- To add a more dynamic element to the market meta I suggest that CCP introduce the concept of futures to EVE. For those of you that may not know a future is a “bet” that a commodity (corn, gold, Tritanium, PLEX) will either go up or down in value. 
---
In EVE a player could buy or sell a futures contract on a variety of items, the most likely items would be common minerals and PLEX. Each contract would have a settlement date on which a final settlement price would be set and any player still holding a contract would be credited or debited isk. The value of a futures contract over the current structure is that they allow you to short (make money from a contracts decline) where the current market structure does not. The ability to sell a future would also allow industrial players to hedge some of the cost of production, ensuring that if tritanium goes up they have hedged that risk by buying futures in the contract. Miners could also hedge against the risk that the cost of tritanium would go down by sell futures, protecting against a market decline. 
---
The introduction of a futures market could also serve as a new isk sink, as futures contracts require margin (money held in reserve) for unexpected moves.
---
Thoughts?
---
My plan has the very center of the map be the EVE gate itself, surrounded by the "New Eden" NPC null region controlled by a mix of SOE and their Mordu's Legion protectors, as well as some SOCT space.
---
[It's set up like this](https://i.imgur.com/MM25epm.png) So the inner sov null regions can't jump or gate directly to each other, and have to mid in the New Eden region in order to hit each other's space with jump drives. New Eden itself connects to the outer ringroad of null and NPC regions so the fastest path by gate between two systems is usually through New Eden.
---
You must be a real hoot at parties.
---
You think the contraction of the player base would have stopped and then start to expand if blackout had remained place?
---
Don’t give away your stuff! sure u don’t want to play today, but what about in the future. Best just keep it
---
Nobody gives a fuck buddy pal
---
How would you know what karma looks like code head
---
Asset safety is bs
---
This type of post irritates me. Been in nothing but null for 10 years and is bored while ignoring all of the other places to go and other things to do. 
---
I feel that CCP brought this on themselves by being bad at balance and just all around game development.
---
“Eve is an MMO designed by CCP”
---
Once again, down voted for reality. I am truly sorry r/eve that there has been no major war between a superpower or a great power in 80 years, despite real life scarcity. I understand this makes it really hard to make your argument that, in the real world, states are always at war with each other fighting over scraps, and that EVE has somehow become a great mockery of this fact. 
---
Like honestly? No shit. We see fewer wars in EVE, because just like in real life, the costs to the institutions and internet spaceship states are far too high, and the economic structures far too integrated. This is just a reality of creating a game where losing a war--or even fighting one--has a serious impact on the participants. 
---
As I see it, you want more war you need to reduce the costs via getting rid of fozzie sov, de-integrate the economies, AND add more scarcity. Of course, you *still* might have issues unless you make it hurt less to lose, but, and maybe I am just speaking for myself, *removing* more penalties for dying and/or losing wars is not really a good direction for the game. It is precisely that these costs are in-place that makes the PVP and giant spaceship wars of EVE so gods damn appealing.
---
Don’t you need to login to claim that?  I’m good then
---
Blue them all, with a blue little window and a blue corvette

---
I remember when they said the same as a selling point for their Bulldozer family of CPUs, since Intel is prone to changing sockets for funsies.
---
Sure sucked for those of us that had an AM3+ socket when they canceled the FX line halfway through.
---
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they never stopped to ask whether the should.
---
Welcome to /r/eve  you new here or something?
---
Nah sell everything and convert your isk to plex. It might be worth more when you return
---
Mjd button and align to safe as soon as they land in your site, after mjd fires, hit warp out if you aren’t going to be able to engage. I mjd in a myrmidon and get kills on the guys trying to catchup to me by abandoning drones and launching fast drones that zonk them while they’re burning at me. Scoop fast drones, and reconnect to abandoned drones when combat has concluded.
---
If you are getting swarmed, you’ll probably end up dying if you stick around and they have damage in excess of your local tank unless you have ways of shutting them down.
---
This is true chaos, expecting change, but instead getting rorq buffs.
---
OK perfect this is the route I'm gonna take.  Thanks again.
---
Good looks, time to sign back in after six months of inactivity
---
Got burned with that and the potential jf cyno changes.
---
Upvoted because you spelled 'bloc' correctly.
---
Upvoted for upvoting the upvote
---
This is an edit of a comic with that very intent.
---
Either play or don't.  But stop crying about how you're quitting, then coming back, then quitting.  We don't care.
---
BOZ1-0 says what?
---
I'm not in Code, but thanks for playing.
---
Some people like having zero responsibilities or obligations aside from krab time. It's also great for smaller groups with no sov of their own, who want to put alts in renter corps for easier isk making. Generally renter landlords don't ask questions about who's grinding in their space.
---
A lot of the space is fairly close to npc null in curse and gwl.  If it's left, someone's going to move in there.
---
My Nexus 7 I use as a TS3 and Discord comms terminal will be happy.
---
Yes, because 'Goonswarm...' will be much less of a stagnating influence on the game.
---
You represent the code and you must bear the burden of their sins
---
&gt;how protective does the game UI have to be for the players.
---
"Is the UI presenting an accurate view of the action the player is about to take" is a pretty good baseline.
---
Contracts make it impossible to tell the difference between a container named "PLEX" and actual plex?  Bad UI, bad scam.
---
Contracts tell you you're about to make a 0 isk contract and hand over all your assets for "free" shipping?  UI is fine, good scam.  Hell, I think the UI even warns you by default about this, yet this scam still works fine, because the player understands what they're doing: they're not at fault for trusting EVE, they're at fault for trusting the scammer.
---
Trade window shows a player that they're about to trade their items for ISK, only to have that change underneath them?  Bad UI, bad scam.  Their mistake was trusting the game.
---
Google the definition of a meme and then look at the rule on r/eve, memes are banned
---
R/eve is very toxic. If you have been banned from the eve forums you end up here so it is a common meeting ground of the most retched players. Eve is always dying. Ccp never listens. Everything is bad. It goes on and on here.

Chaos failed before that. Blackout had to be rolled back because of the damage it was causing, but that was after two months of doing nothing.
---
Even if you're pro-blackout Chaos still failed. It was pitched as "weekly changes", instead we got three quick changes, only one of which was controversial and one change after two months the impact of which is still unclear. That said, the whole concept of "chaos" in mmo game mechanics is absurd, it's a small minority of people who can tolerate that situation. In a game where people who will play the game are already a tiny minority of gamers, further reducing the potential player base is self-destructive.
---
Yeah because NPC's havn't dropped blueprints related to them before. *Stares at literally every pirate faction in game*
---
Forget local, turn on **CYNOS**.
---
Rule of Thirds is one of many rules, and its not even listed in the 11 main rules of imaging

Grath, are you sad and lonely?

Upwell structures build cost x5
---
Leave NullSec.  Try wormhole.  Wormholer btw so yes, I get it, I'm biased.  But it's a different game.
---
Hold onto your assets it's pointless to throw them away unless you're doing it to force yourself away from the game permanently
---
You could probably do the serpentis 10/10 with the Proteus and the sansha with the Loki.
---
Oh I must have missed that, that’s a solid +1 from me
---
This is a good argument for _some form_ of "asset safety", not a good argument for the asset teleporting system as it exists now.
---
I would like to see a hybrid system where asset safety in citadels works roughly similar to in the outpost days, though with the tax added to it. 
---
In low and nullsec don't teleport the assets, let people deliver them to any citadel in system. (This includes hostile ones.) This way the tax is still paid, but the assets need to be recovered one way or another. You might be able to put up a new citadel to deliver your assets to, you might be able to smuggle them out of a hostile citadel, or you might just firesale them to the locals. 
---
Your assets don't teleport, there are paths to recover them, and your losses ultimately depend on how much effort the attacker is willing to go through. This even brings back the possibility of deadzoning assets by attacker not letting anyone anchor a citadel in that system. This is difficult enough though that it couldn't last forever.
---
&gt; This is like staring at an 8 ball of coke for months and not touching it. Your discipline amazes me
---
Some recent studies have started to confirm the idea that self discipline is empathy with your future self.
---
I am definitely this way, I look at the SP, and I imagine myself being exactly that many SP away from being able to fly exactly the ship being called for on a fleet or exactly what I need to jump into something I want a day early.... 
---
and I can't sacrifice that to...just bump ahead some middling skill, or to take a few days off something that will still end up a week out... so I save them....
---
Best advice ^^
---
Legit question: Could you anchor more than one supercap construction POS in a system?
---
It's also not just structure spam, it's the increase in materials enabling construction. Even if you limited active Supercap Shipyard Services to 1 per system and limited the number of supercap jobs, you'd just see Sotiyos in every system because there's more than enough inflow of minerals to ensure they'd all always be producing.
---
Hey, you may think you want to quit now and give everything away, but you might come to regret it later if you do. Trust me, I did the same thing once and now wish I had not.
---
Regardless of what you choose to do though, it was nice hearing your story. Best of luck in whatever you do next.
---
DoDo12341234, as your Reddit-name goes, just cynoed out of the game. Makes me sad, but, hey, as they once said: Godspeed! o7
---
Yes they do, zerging implies the zerg strategy of using on average weaker units in higher density to even odds/gain an advantage.  Blobbing only implies more people to overwhelm the opponent.
---
Nah, it opens into a black hole that sucks you in and closes the door behind you.
---
One of the great ideas from the UI department of CCP.
---
I was ironical, obviously. Old way was better... The slider that people told you before helps a bit but it makes the useful popups longer to appear too.
---
The UI keep going bad as long as time pass. I wonder sometimes if CCP just copy the fashion tendency of the moment (like the flat icons because Windows 8 "flat" design) in an half-ass way as usual (transparency for everything until they set a slider who can't alter the Neocom bar, etc.) which would be just plain stupid...
---
I have a problem with a quest making a delivery I got the items to deliver but I can't load them on my ship any information would be greatly appreciated
---
because sov warfare is cancer,  and blackout, and npcs attacking, and because nobody actually wants the fucking sov anyway.  This war should be exhibit A in how null politics is broken because of shitty game mechanics.
---
That's reasonable.  You can't gift time to people's lives, but you can gift them years of pre-learned Omega skill queues lol.
---
Everyone outside of wormholes is retarded and talks like a fag
---
Yeah, but it will be in far smaller quantities than the people who leave.
---
Cant wait to see TEST posters complain of having to go 40 jumps to find content as they actively blue everything around them for 4 regions
---
I couldnt even get access to that option. the screen-bit I had did not show the usual setup-screen on hitting ESC...  
---
But, magically it solved itself after I took a nap o,O
---
[Over 55/55 items to redeem myself.](https://imgur.com/a/QVwZaFX) And thats across all of my accounts well lol
---
I rarely redeem items unless I absolutely need them. Never know when you are randomly out someplace and need something.
---
Random crap from random gifts. Starter packs etc. I still have some Giant Secure Containers, Frigates and T1 Haulers in the queue, since they never expire.
---
I feel you mate. Me and my crew already decided to stand down like a week ago also.  I suggest you liquidate your assets get into +5 implants and leave your character in hybernation. At least thats what we did and plexed till the end of 2022. If the game becomes hardcore again we will definately come back.
---
I don’t believe so. I think they shut the door years ago.
---
EVE gameplay is basically ITTT in space...

Gurista with both
---
Sansha with loki
---
Drones both
---
Angel? Dont know proteus for sure
---
Still gets more than you
---
Lmao I mean if that's how you want to play this game, by blueing as many people as possible, you do you. 
---
It's wild at the time, even frat + skillu didn't have the same amount of people as legacy.
---
Don’t you have a Steve-4:20 idol to worship?
---
I don't really want to beg for isk, but if you have any Hecates, just send them do David Eidolon and I will whelp them gloriously against provibloc/trc/whoever shows up to fight me around 9UY
---
I once saw both these statements nearly back-to-back out of the same persons mouth unironically recently. Eve players have little self-awarness in the face of \*narrative\*.
---
Wait, what? I’ve been led to believe that the Proteus can’t do anything.
---
If you need me to hold your isk and assets just let me know!! I would enjoy them!
---
Can you not see how ridiculous you are, and yet you still persist
---
No impactful changes will ever get made when you bow to the krab.
---
Does nos work on sleepers?
---
Hello guys I have a very simple question for today:
---
Why the Vedmak is so fucking difficult to fit?
---
I've been piloting Phantasm as my primary ship for quite a long time now and I'd like to move to the Vedmak/Ikitursa. 
---
Any advise for this ship?
---
But they would if they could. If Frat could have brought in more people they absolutely would, instead they took what they could get and it didn't work out for them.
---
That doesn't change anything at all about sov null, I said more than enough about in my original post. The fact that Frat doesn't have as many friends doesn't change the fact that if they had more support they'd absolutely be swarming us right now. Like I said, sometimes your're the tinkler and sometimes you're the tinkelee. I'm sure your group will move on and do something else when this one is over, quite possibly on the side with numbers next time. When that happens are you gonna come back here and make the same post when you get to be king tinkle? No, no you won't. Pot, kettle, tinkle and tinkler, it's all the same in this peehole game.
---
They are currently in Caldari Faction Warfare.
---
Both red and blue.
---
This
---
SO MUCH this
---
how can this be an "Eve Championship Series" if no one knows of it?
---
I gave all my assets away, sold all seven characters and gave away the profit... in an attempt to never come back! I still did...
---
Oof, well i guess it might work out for me at the beginning since thats what im planning to do next, doing some hi sec ratting? Or something similar but in the future might do pvp when I have pretty good rig . Thanks for the ideas
---
"Safety" ... It's still a risk to mine and pve in EVE. The blackout changes may have been reversed but the cyno changes are still there. Rorqual panic moduals have been nerfed. It seems most "pvpers" want their content handed to them on a silver platter these days.
---
gottem
---
I see that explains why i dont see any portrait when i go click show info
---
Yourself and proving how edgy you can be online to compensate for whatever need that fills for you
---
Quit this game and get help, if you are over the age of 15 you desperately need that
---
Could you link me a fit to the loki? I have one but i could not finish alone the sansha
---
See you in 3 months!
---
well npc mining corporations also mine hi sec so I am guessing your seeing npcs
---
After that last MER, it would be lovely to meet some high-end WH whales.
---
I run a Dell 4k and a older BenQ 144hz 1080p monitor on a 4790k and a 1070, I have zero issues with a few accounts open. 4k eve is amazing, highly recommended!
---
So some gutless wonder removed my post.
---
Just copy/paste that 80 item list from yesterday straight into EVE and hit PUBLISH TO TRANQUILITY.
---
o7
---
Change structures.  The change to cynos was good.  Change the sov mechanics.  Change resource spawns.   Change the production capabilities of sotiyos.  Change the input costs to supers/titans.  
---
Do something creative. 
---
Nope.  Let’s just fuck with chat.  So unoriginal.  Killahbee on the last TiS was dead on balls with his assessment.
---
Similar thing here.  No college degree, lot of EVE.  Security consultant now making 6 figures.
---
True.  I was a bit salty aftee that roam.  T1 logi and our fleet was little more than a basic exercise for Test to use a response fleet.  I was offered a T2 logi to fly and I am soooo glad I declined.  All it would have done is padded the killmail.
---
Everyone starts as first level support in IT.  Moving up the ladder is a drive/connections you make thing.
---
Cause it's what we named it.
---
&gt; I also have around 10b in ships/assets
---
How much of that is in the form of combat nereuses?
---
I'm gonna do what's called a pro /r/eve move.
---
1. Post question.
---
2. Create a second account.
---
3. Answer my own question incorrectly.
---
4. Wait for someone to correct my answer with the correct answer.
---
Ok blobber boy
---
That incoherent rambling announcement of Blackout ending is about all the Choas CCP has left.  WTF....  It is no wonder why there haven't been any meaningful innovation in the game if that display of unprofessionalism is the norm at headquarters
---
They kept trying to innovate and improve where no change was needed.
---
Any meaningful changes to sov mechanics and resource respsawns will be met from the same amount of crying as blackout from the big blocs and krabs.
---
Actors paid to play wormholers
---
It’s too bad we couldn’t post how far into stain they’ll push that shitty ass Ferra group once people get tired of WoW classic
---
Daaaamn skippy, got hella fat off them too, thanks provi #SorryNotSorry

well it would of been interesting to see what the wormhole chaos was going to be.   But yeah you are right&gt;

We still haven't tried once of  re/eve's favorites: Resource Depletion™

---
Not a student anymore, haven’t been in a while. And I know I’m not the only Aggie that plays/has played, but it’s definitely not advertised anywhere. So it’s always cool to run in to another one that does because you never see them, and it’s never a conversation that you just happen to overhear. 
---
But, appreciate the reply.
---
Lol closest friends. Like any of you Goons actually know who linemember #9075698 is in your F1 fleets.
---
Things continue to change. Highsec spawns, invasions pushing into low, wormholes increasing spawn rate.
---
I've had so many friends quit in the last few months, I've been given so much stuff ☹️ it makes me sad to see the game dieing.
---
That awkward moment you can’t even defeat a goon pet in a year long war.
---
And a blue donught for you.

We just chase them into cache bro.  The KS highway layin down some new stops

X up

holy fuck I'm retarded I didn't even see which post he replied to MY B
---
His father has cancer
---
The NPCs have a diamond shape in their ship name I believe. If you’re in high sec, most systems typically have 4-5 real people in them though I’ve found. I typically browse people’s corps by clicking on their name in the local chat channel where everyone in that system online is shown
---
None of these idiots play the game anymore u know that.
---
Is there a way to transfer unredeemed rewards to another account?
---
To be more than Frat??   Really??  Lol
---
thats actually a good idea
---
Guess he should get the word out about it, maybe post it to reddit or something?

You forgot about the rorqual alts to upvote to the top

I mean maybe.  But at least it’s not a lazy ass bullshit attempt to shake shit up for the sake of change.  
---
Too bad they don’t try it to give people a chance to do that
---
Yeah I was winning Eve for almost 6 months and came back just recently. Without asset safety I wouldn’t even consider playing again if I had to go afk again at a moments notice
---
No but like actually tho.
---
A Palatine Keepstar requires as much as T4 PI material as is bought/solid in Jita in 18 months. You could build a Palatine, or you could build over 400 regular Keepstars. A palatine requires more materials to build than every Keepstar in the entire game combined. It's not an ISK problem, it's a materials problem since unlike Titans, Citadels are mostly built from PI.
---
Yes there is thru esi.  I have no clue how to set that up but yes it’s possible
---
Someone gold this man, im poor
---
They never existed. At all. You're imaging things.  
---
Just wanted to complete the trifecta of possibilities.
---
Tying citadels to sov might be interesting, making you deliver system and if delivered to a citadel paying a fee to the owner of said citadel
---
And him, and everybody around.
---
Because he aint got no intel to listen
---
Do you have enough cargo space? 
---
If not, try a hauling ship or add cargo expanders.
---
I thought you couldn't remove items from the trade window, once they've been added? For that reason, I thought it was safe already
---
DELETE THIS
---
They are still a thing
---
Thank you!
---
Did this.  Currently away from the game but still paying to keep skill queue going and hoping Plex investment pays off
---
Are other corps taxing you on how much you mine? LOL hope you live in NS at least
---
Usually when a player is burnt out and looking for an extended break, they are also too burnt out to put in the effort to move all of their things to ls/hs.
---
It doesn’t mention it anywhere in the attributes, it’s in the description. Took me a while to find as well.
---
so u want to balance the game for everyone else around the fact that someone wants to quit/go on break but dont want to deal with saving his assets..ok
---
Maybe blue some more people?
---
I got 5bil isk on Jin.
---
Sometimes I just hit asset safety on everything and just say fuck it.
---
Couple notes. Saving the entire world/galaxy or whatever is pretty hard to conceptualize, its too big. Smaller, punchy stories are almost always more effective. Saving THIS colony, or THIS guy, or whatever. Not ALL the colonies.
---
And there is certainly risk involved in the capsuleer lifestyle. Personal death isnt the only risk to a capsuleer. Their loved ones or personal values being challenged is also a threat. 
---
And capsuleers can die, by the by. They only death-clone when in their capsule, if they are out in station and are killed, it is true death. This was an element in the old lore chronicles. Many capsuleers would never leave their pods and became antisocial, strange beings.
---
I think a smaller drama set around normal civilians/navy personnel dealing with sansha/guristas/blood raiders and having it be a true conflict, with perhaps them recruiting a single capsuleer in a supporting role. If the capsuleer was the primary hero it would be 82 minutes of watching a myrmidon orbit a Rock Haven, which is just about the worst tv you can imagine.
---
Not both on the same side of the conflict surely?
---
Wrong answer.
---
Right answer.
---
Just redeem them, the skill points are still unallocated on your character sheet.
---
I would still be in favor of space-magic-teleportation-of-stuff for people who have not logged in in a long time, i.e. over 6-12 months. Let's be honest here, there *are* easier ways to move stuff than logging out your account for a year and on the other hand, coming back to game only to find that all your stuff is in PL/NC/whatever staging and your only choice is begging to join... yeah...
---
Apply some thinking. At least try to grasp the point that the other guy is trying to make. Then you post.
---
there are so many options. firesell. trust it to corp member/friends. use JF service. dont care about it. push the asset safety button. its rly not that hard.
---
but the fact that stuff gets to asset safety automatically is just retarded.
---
If Dust 514 and valkyrie were just stapled onto eve, and functioned somewhat like Warframe, I'd plex 10 accounts.
---
The corresponding increase in sig would be very bad for a grappled cruiser. You have to going pretty much full speed to negate the sig bloom which you cant do while orbiting.
---
Everyone hates everyone now
---
And not in the fun”grrr those gankers” way.  A legitimate hatred where one side publically and openly talks about how toxic the other is
---
And the other side that does the same... CCP chose a side, and playing a game isn’t about hating and hurting your enemies.  It’s about roleplaying that, but it’s become... real.
---
It isn’t fun any more.
---
Great vid dude! That wrecking shot on the sleip :O
---
I would definitely use tetryon over baryon though for shooting small stuff close range.
---
You assume much...
---
I get it, you realize how silly you complaining about blobbing was and you're struggling to deal with the reality that BL............. or Orgin could very well be on the blobby side next time you guys blue up with someone. You know, like how right now you literally joined Frat and it doesn't get any more blue than that. But that's no need to have a hissy, it's just part of Eve.
---
Agree. Before Blackout normally Play with a Prcourer and Orca in 0.9 System, mining. Reason help some lo points char, they are not logging after be destroyed for Trig recon squads. Myself dont see login 1-5 habitual people in 0.8 and 0.9 for recon squads. And myself dont using the Orca anymore. Use procurer because i like mining, but very much less people.
---
I can confirm that for myself. I still have my five accounts active and I will keep them active but I am definitely playing a lot less than I've ever played in the past two to three years. You summed it up perfectly
---
buff faction warfare
---
Yeah...my newbie corp who has focused entirely on shield/hybrid weapons doctrines for longer than I've been a part of it suddenly added a T2 armor laser doctrine.  Then a day later an FC was complaining actively about low turnout and "people flying random crap fits" in their fleet using the new doctrine.
---
Upvoting for recursion
---
&gt;so what what? the risk went away again because players no longer interact once again.
---
the risk of the activity increased you moron
---
what a retarded fucking statement
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Sounds like this guy is the taxmaster.
---
You can redeem to any character on the account, but not between accounts.
---
Yes, but the decision then has to be made about which character on the account should get them.
---
Chaos era appeared out of nowhere? It was some dumb shit... Where is invasion? Where are the iterations on the triglavian invasion, where is the conclusion?
---
You guys have been bringing Goons since day 1
---
PLEASE DELETE IT omfg
---
One note on Karmafleet. While its a true "Newbie" corp, as in focused on helping new players get into the game with a large number of services and programs for them its still a core group of Goons, there is really no reason to leave Karmafleet, ever.
---
You're basically arguing that every single Eve player has to be a no-life basement dweller.
---
That's...silly.
---
yes certainly, i will use a hauling service to move my capitals supercapitals and titans. this is a viable solution.
---
people have always shat on low life krabs. the fact that the differing opinions have gained any foothold or even became represantative in the past few years is only symptomatic and shows how deep in the shitter this game and its community really are.
---
It was always “filthy krab” passively, but now people literally play the game to fuck over krabs our if hatred
---
The devs themselves spoke openly about how “wrong” the krabs are for not being punished enough or killed enough
---
It took a sandbox element of natural pvp vs pve elements and made it into a circus of real world political tier proportions...
---
I'm sorry what? I thought the complaint was that local reduces risk. You are now telling me that with local back and the blackout over that risk has increased as a result of fewer players interacting?
---
Because the only consistently performing team is the art team. Besides the skins, the art team has made some impressive visual improvements to EVE over the last few years; look at the wormhole visual changes, or the sun changes.
---
I hope this is not the case.
---
&gt;I'm sorry what? I thought the complaint was that local reduces risk.
---
it does
---
&gt; You are now telling me that with local back and the blackout over that risk has increased as a result of fewer players interacting?
---
i never said this, we're talking about BLACKOUT, not post blackout.
---
Ditching Blackout was a mistake. CCP lost players to it, but it was probably the price to pay for breathing fresh air into the game. Some players that left will come back, some will not. Some players that came back for Blackout will leave, some will not.
---
The most important thing in all of this is the message CCP sent to the community by ending Blackout, this message is that they don't have the balls to take the decisions the game needs because nullbears will leave.
---
Post some, then. The users are the content creators.
---
See what he means?
---
It didn't make one bit of difference to what we do in our jspace system.
---
You can easily pull Corp Moon mining ledgers into a google sheet with ESI. But as for regular anomalies you will need the ESI of every character in order to pull their personal mining ledgers
---
You are in fleet with tarrant. Are you testing or something? You also seemed to file a petition directly before were you still on a timer ? What exactly are you doing? Ganking haulers on high sec gates?

needs more fuel in the basket, it's not burning enough...
---
Montolio lost IIRC after hedging his bets on that PL will save them after the AT.
---
I only login for some fleets.  I can’t find any motivation to invest any serious time to this game anymore because there is no point. Hilmar can wake up any day and shit on whatever he will feel like. I honestly stopped treating ccp like a serious company, more like some kid that is renting some server for minecraft. Out of 6 accounts i have only 1 active now. Cyno toons became obsolete, no point in having jf toon as it became even more cancer than before. Same with super toon and fax toon. They can enjoy some holidays now and i stopped having any hope for ccp rebuilding trust enough for me to sub them again.
---
That's the feminine school with the male cheerleaders and weird military/cheering fetish, right?
---
Not really.  He knows when his sub runs out and can move his shit.
---
Absolutely!
---
&gt; i never said this, we're talking about BLACKOUT, not post blackout
---
I was talking about post blackout.
---
Null sec is certainly worse. Ishtars everywhere but always aligned with drones recalled as soon as I arrive in local. No chance setting up a fight only ganks remain. I caught an afk mining barge that was fun
---
“Pretend nothing happened and hope that everything turned out alright in the morning” is usually my go to for fixing stuff with eve... shit maybe even in life
---
The game is nothing but krabs now. It used to be a game with loads of facets but now krabs are the majority and the few pvp’ers left are treated with disdain
---
Maybe the artists **are** the ones doing game balance.  Hence the *ChAOS eRa* random panicked flicking of switches.
---
cHaOs eRa was ineffectual flailing to begin with
---
memes are banned; rule 2
---
If only the game had more ship classes
---
You're not the only one! Gig 'em!
---
Im not even in origin lmao if you need to keep projecting on me to make you feel better about your blue donut, feel free.
---
WHOOP!
---
My capital fleet was caught in some random citadel because I abruptly quit due to a PC breaking, and then realized I was better off without the game... it'll be kind of fun to find out what happened to those ships if I ever log back in
---
No they won’t. Everyone universally hates the sov system.
---
There are people in my corp who used to log in every day to hunt in null during the blackout. Since it ended they barely log in at all. Sure they logged in more during the blackout but today they log in less than before the blackout happened.
---
The newspaper is not interactive. Thus this is invalid. 😅
---
Amazing though, you like to fly Null Sec Made Ships, Null Sec Made Mods on that ship yet want to shit on the null bears that made it for you to play your chosen ship/style.
---
he didn't you he asked me, what I think I will probably post in an extended topic. There is many aspects to the issue but the "contraction" started when ccp turned their backs to content creators to recruit the basic karmafleet/test/horde player, while their revenues also increased.
---
Yup, they are both Caldari and fly FW fleets and I think some NPSI too (don't quote me on that).
---
 [https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/crt-monitor-modern-gaming/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/crt-monitor-modern-gaming/)
---
CCP didn't choose a side lmao they've been running the game one way for several years now when they want to shake it up it's suddenly they're choosing sides what? They've been going HTFU for years you just didn't have an opportunity to be affected by it since recently. Don't try to paint this in some real world politics terms there's no sides there's just the regular r/eve bullshit drama.
---
Your best bet is to setup a SeAT server. Its a EVE tool that can do that and much more.
---
Your posts push people away from the game.
---
ccp will get all the subs back when they change cynos back.
---
People need to mix it up.  I'm sure a lot of null corps would have a blast abandoning the 0.0 life for wspace.
---
A lot of people used blackout as an excuse to take a break.
---
So. Been there, done that. Only difference is it was my mother and I wasnt dumb enough to backstab people when we were trying to work out issues in a video game. 
---
If I sound harsh to you or bitter, I dont really care. I take people for their actions. Noraus had his chance to strike up a NIP in this war and have the war officially end. Unfortunately he was not able to refrain from shutting all over his own deal.
---
It was a minority who quit... but the game population is small enough that ccp can’t afford a sizable minority quitting even if most people liked the change. If you have 100k people and you release a change that pleases 80k but the other 20k hate it enough it causes them to quit then the minority are the ones who are going to get the attention. I know plenty of people disliked blackout. But I’ve talked to far more people who enjoyed it and thought it added some more skin in the game and made it so you actually had to play eve instead of watching Netflix and having it in the background. But we as players also can’t afford 5-10% of the game quitting so we have to accept that.
---
we gank Mostly untankd haulers in hisec  we also fail alot whitch is fine as its just ships but i filed the bug report for the gateguns and for the ship scanner ship scanner
---
we mainly do it for fun and some isk for new tornados :]
---
Trash your stuff so you don’t come back. Eve can easily bring you back. Well... unless that’s your goal
---
A trend you're pulling out of your ass
---
Not really most eve players don't know what collateral means an especially if there not all that familiar with the contract interface and not native English speakers ( it's a word you rarely see as a non-native English speaker ). 
---
It's rare that anybody but the dumbest player ever hands over their items in an item exchange being fully aware the items can be taken and never returned generally there either ignorant of the rules of the game ( and don't realize GMs don't undo scams as common in some mmo's ) or more likely a transport contract is used and they don't fully grasp the implications of the way they're asked to set it up 1 is an inherent UI problem and 1 is NPE tutorial problem.
---
Setting up a fight against ratting ishtars?
---
That being said. The last two weeks of blackout, i sold 2 ishtars. First 2 days after, sold 15 without having to export to jita.
---
Having that opinion is fine
---
Hating people for disagreeing is roleplay
---
Acting only on that hatred and wanting game changes based around that emotional bias is bad for the game
---
\*Partially release, promise iteration, *then* move on to the next thing.
---
we fail becouse ship scanners do not show the entire fit most of the times and mis the tank
---
BuT wHaT iF i Go On VaCaTiOn
---
Thats goofballs if they are.
---
Local is a real problem. Just look at how much easier the game is with it reinstated. However a solid black out wasn’t the answer
---
&gt;I was talking about post blackout.
---
so risk is gone again
---
I can fly any subcap and most caps on my main toon which is still subscribed. Spent 2 years in wormholes. Trust me, i know what this game can offer. You wormhole bois think you are so elite and you are the only right game style. I’ll tell you a secret. You arent. You are same as the rorqual dudes in null. You hide when someone stronger comes in and decloak when you have upper hand.
---
Having a change reverted because it literally was killing the game isn’t disdain for pvpers
---
Covops cloaks and trig ships “exist” for hunters to use and abuse...
---
And that’s ok.  That’s balance.  It should be left at that
---
You're misreading a bit.
---
In the beginning there were filthy krabs and elite pvpers. There was a balance.
---
At some point CCP realized multiaccount high SP krabbing is super profitable in the short term. Empowered krabs.
---
That empowerment made empires push people to being krabs, and reorient themselves for krabbing.
---
The same empowerment chipped away from the game's long term health, and made ultra safe ultra dense krabbing regions. 
---
Anyone with a sound mind saw these regions as a problem. The problem was that many empires (particularly Imperium) use fodder personalities to create cohesion. So when people (e.g. me) began talking about the problems, we attracted a lot of flak.  
---
We didn't hate krabs. But them not being killed enough was wrong. It wasn't wrong because they are vermin that needs to be killed. It was wrong from the perspective of an interesting, fun, emergent, sustainable Eve.
---
Krabs took these thoughts personally and interpreted as if we hate them. Particularly because empires weaved that trope top-down to their linemembers. Every episode of Meta Show helped "elite pvp'er" to become an insult.
---
Now we're at this point I can't even argue balance without the krab thinking I hate him. And I get lots of hatred myself. The krab does extend the hatred to CCP when they argue the same game balance talking points, and at times to Hilmar. 
---
Yes, it's not fun and a big problem. But krabs and their mega empire propaganda has the biggest share in how we got here, along with CCP with their short term profit strategies.
---
If you truly cared you wouldn't primary us every god damn fight ;)
---
They do.  Which is why it is ridiculous that it’s balanced around specific playstyles instead of encouraging people to utilize counters
---
I have a toon with 3 mil SP to redeem.  He has 48m SP so I'm weighing up whether to inject the 2m to 50m and then redeem.  In this instance it is worth keeping it in the redeem queue as it doesn't count towards your total SP.
---
Isn't this actually EVE in general ? I mean, you are in NCDock, and if I remember correctly, when Goonswarm came to glass Vale/Tribute, all you did was stay docked and mouthbreath on Reddit.
---
It's just EVE, you only fight when you have the upper hand, if you don't have it, you stay docked. Fights only happend by mistake in this game now.
---
Call CODE? Hit up their website, rub elbows, and try to orchestrate a fleet. Would probably work better if you offered the gank ships too. Can't promise they won't steal your shit and not help, but it's unlikely, because they love making hisec scary.
---
I mean if you caught those Ishtar would you think you are elite????? Who the fuck cares about the Ishtar km that's shit content anyway
---
... Or they just enjoy playing the video game that way, accepting that they can be shot but trying not to be
---
And they don’t enjoy being literally hated and abused for that. 
---
It isn’t some grand scheme of the evil manipulative machine mind controlling “krabs”... it’s just people playing the way they want to man.
---
And that used to be ok.
---
This what I say has not if any to do with blackout or anything. I stopped playing eve seriously like 3 yrs ago, when I left my last corp, c5 wh corp, before citadel even launched. I left because I git bored and when I get bored, I become a whiny little bitch and everyone told me, so I left without most of my stuff because I didnt cared about it anymore. There was even an archon. 
---
Then I tried to do some shit solo, like lowsec frigate pvp, but the goodfights are rare and I got bored again. Then I joined some spectre fleets, was nice for some time but because the roaming got bored I stopped. 
---
I even tried to make my own corp, with 2 people, but I suck as a teacher, and they left. Then tried the same with my cousin, but he left.
---
Then I got myself a c3 with a raitaru, got some slow money. I never been rich cuz I hate pve. And I got bored.
---
Some more solo lowsec pvp without fun or the feeling that I get better, so I got mad and bored of it.
---
What I want to say here is: everything gets boring after so many years. My years are now at over 10. If one does not enjoy it, dont try to make yourself enjoy it by force because you have a lot of isks and assets. That were like the only thing I was here for the last 3 yrs. Wasted years.
---
They exist as noted above in Caldari FW
---
Yeah cause obviously null sec is the only place in EVE where you can build ships and mods right. Oh look, there is a sticker on my T3 that says "Made in Delve". What kind of shit is your brain full of ?
---
Even worse, you live in the only area in which you control, or can control, access.
---
blackout was just now lifted, so there are few trends to even observe. The one sudo trend that i have observed is mid to late in USTZ server population just about 1200 characters higher than previous weeks and seems to have held that. However, In such a long term system, 4 days does not a trend make... especially given the incredible population fluctuations that occur over the course of a week. need more data nom nom nom
---
It used to be classy back in 2003/4/5 before social media was popular e.g. "they killed me without saying a word". Now it just makes you look a bit autistic.
---
What do you think Fraternity has done? They didnt just absorb the small corps they also paid them off.
---
&gt; the interview is around an hour
---
Jesus Christ, my RL job didn't take that long to interview me.
---
When I was in BRAVE back in 2013 was when I really could have used skill injectors. We moved around enough to be forced to change doctrine to deal with new entities. Few but our bittervets could fly effectively.
---
Orange (and red) man bad, pls upvote.
---
I haven't been able to play this week, due to IRL stuff. Like a career fair I learned about last Sunday, senior project work, and now an interview (yay!, career fair worked). 
---
But no, I'm not at all less motivated to play. I really want to escape back to Eve, build my PI farm, get my carrier fit, start freighting some stuff, and take out a T1 frigate roam or two (never done that but I want to start learning). And maybe shoot a few more smoothbrain dinos after Vily's excellent diplomatic move yesterday.
---
2 or 3 more days and I can put the hammer down again on playing Eve.
---
You are not really familiar with irony right ?
---
inject then redeem
---
That the blackout is gone. I liked having the blackout. But at the same time i understand that blackout was not good for the health of the game. Anyway this is going to be a problem dragging out a conversation like this over the course of multiple days. I have a poor memory due to my cognitive and developmental disability so i will have to reread the whole thread every time to remember what we were even talking about. 
---
This becomes harder and harder for me as the thread gets longer and your response times get more delayed.
---
it´s you degenerates that have been killing the game for the better part of 5 years now. all the blackout made evident is that there´s no coming back.
---
Could you do me a favour and compare me to Hitler? I’ve almost got miner bingo, tia
---
Are you me, OP? I left last month and my resume is basically yours.
---
No one would go to just lose a ship. If you are you need to check your brain.  You assess your chances and make decision. Exactly what NC. did. If there was a chance to win a fight undocked. If no chance what is the point to just pad your enemy killboard? This is what every alliance is doing. Look at NC. and Darkness, when they have a chance they undock and give a fight, if they dont they dont bother. There is no more “elite” style in large scale fights. In the past there was SP barrier. Now it is only number of bodies on grid.
---
Well, maybe you can ask CCP for number of Kills of recon squads in HIGH sec miners. I Feel many people left fotr that and the blocked paths in high sec for invasions of trigs.
---
I FEEL, too, the Trigs do now less damage than before but surely do more than normal rats in low sec and people leaving for it.
---
Anyone just wants to play their own game in their own way. It becomes an issue when "your way" becomes an obstacle for the long term sustainability and health of Eve.
---
You think the manipulative machine is an illusion. If anything, you thinking that it is a bunch of hunters hating krabs from the heart is an illusion. Hunters WANT krabs in the game. They want them even in abundance, so they themselves can sustain their gameplay. We want people to play Eve in many ways. As long as it doesn't mess up the game.
---
Meanwhile, I can just open Meta Show and point at the manipulative machine there. It's very much real. And now that I'm a CSM I have more insight than ever how that machine works. We're literally boogie man to them to keep their own people on toes. It works much like RL dictatorships constantly pointing at "foreign threats".
---
After blackout my pve game time ticked up a bit, but then I realized I really don't need isk. I'd rather have the element of risk back. It was far more exciting for pvp and even made pve challenging and thrilling. 
---
I don't understand the deep hatred for the blackout.
---
Yeah I was just reacting to the "You are the same as the Rorqual dudes in null". I mean, you're in a null block, you shouldn't even dare use such an argument lol
---
I don't think people realize how destructive blackout really was. Pure PVPers don't have a lot of roots or infrastructure. They can quickly move or adapt or change strategies. Full time or part time krabs have invested what they see as years of their time and effort and for a lot of them, CCP made a change with a few days notice that basically made them unable to do any kind of PVE for two months. Even though it was reverted, why would they invest more time and effort into a game where the developers would do that and might do it again.
---
&gt; It isn’t some grand scheme of the evil manipulative machine mind controlling “krabs”
---
just as in rl it´s lazy consumerist drones that fuck up everything in the long run. it´s just that eves ecosystem isn´t as forgiving towards these kinds of behavoir.
---
Maybe so. I had several different ppl in different corps telling me not to talk in local because it made the pvpers stay longer. They wanted the pvpers to leave so they could go back to crabbing. This was in the time when ppl actually roamed and the game was fun.
---
Sorry mate, but your emotional bias and victimized attitude is wrong. If you take a step back and look at the state of things, the PvP players are disappearing and the krabs have proliferated. If there’s no explosions then there’s no demand for your minerals and isk will just accumulate, meaning exponential inflation since there’s no longer anything necessary to buy. Eve has always thrived on production-&gt;destruction (supply and demand). Most people don’t hate their Indy guys, they’re usually appreciated. If you’re just running bots that’s a different matter. People will of course KILL your ishtars or myrmidons etc if you’re ratting, because they either have nothing better to shoot, or they want your buddies to come shoot back (If they don’t think you’ll drop a bunch of titans).
---
Hilmar (probably): "It rubs the nanite paste on its SKIN."
---
Considering that one of the options he proposed requires *literally no effort at all*, not even requiring a login, I'm not sure what the hell you're on about.
---
You pulled a sneaky on me with your flair. Then does that mean you keep that flair because you miss the glory days of BL when you could join a side of an ongoing tussle and turn the tide to the other side? Like by showing up and overwhelming the enemies with caps to black out the star? Like kind of a blob of dreads, you know like a big ol ball of them making sure your side had the most big ships to end a war?
---
... and is that the community team behind him?
---
Tackle one and wait - 90% of the time it works every time
---
At no point were BL ever able to blob people lmao
---
If you catch a krab you usually get a response from normal human beings.
---
The lifeblood of a sandbox mmo is item destruction and obsolescence, because it fuels the entire economic gameplay cycle. Mechanics that remove item sinks are generally bad. Asset safety also removes strategic possibilities of dealing killing blows to enemy stockpiles.
---
I joined eve because I watched a video on the fountain war. I love history and politics and stuff like that so when I saw that there was a game that blends those into a space mmo I knew I had to try it
---
You jump to the same hashed out arguement as every other f1 monkey does. Check my killboard - I take fights whatever the odds and die like a man.
---
WRONG. People who see this as a game and ships as pixels do exist, they undock and fly, kill or die. It’s a circle, you just have to undock. 
---
Sigh at your mentality. This is a game
---
And sadly pve except incursions, abyssals/invasions, and exploration is incredibly dull and boring. I really think most people quit because they gravitate to what’s most familiar to other games (missions/quests) and those are pretty much the oldest and weakest aspect of eves gameplay
---
"Chaos Era", in non-CCP speak translates to "That time we implemented random 100% pro-PvP ideas and wondered why all the newbs and PvE'rs quit logging in."
---
&gt; This must be purely for reddit, because anyone in those fleets knows better.  
---
&gt;The whole time the Goons were pushing in the north, we showed up to maybe half a dozen timers, mostly keepstar kill timers.
---
Maybe cause you were busy with FRT at the time ? Just sayin'. The Pure Blind war was the same, it was okay when you were rekting PL, but when they deployed back you didn't find anything more useful to do than follow them and add to the numbers imbalance.
---
&gt;PL is literally deployed in frat space and trying to entosis our shit. (But at least they're undocking again.)
---
PL does what PL wants, doesn't concern Horde and NC.
---
&gt; Horde had a short-lived deployment down here as well. 
---
It's literally a small SIG and they didn't even have the numbers there, not the whole goddamn alliance.
---
&gt; We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong \[sic\]. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon. 
---
It didn't go that well for them, eh ? You could have said "We rekted them and got our revenge", but the victim card is too powerful for that.
---
Hilmar: I'm in your office, where are you?
---
HoD: err, you're in my office?
---
Hilmar: yes
---
HoD: err, okay. Only I've had a problem with the door since I was promoted.
---
Hilmar: Oh? You mean you've never used your office?
---
HoD: err no? Not really..!?!?!
---
Hilmar: hmm okay. Meet me in my office in 5 mins
---
HoD: ok no problem... *thud* ... wtf?
---
They wouldn't dare attempt to do anything that could damper a Goon's day again.
---
&gt;I have a poor memory due to my cognitive and developmental disability 
---
damn that explains this entire conversation, have a good day
---
I found pvp’ers in nullsec constantly during blackout. They were who remained. Some krabs krabbed but they were prepared. I’d prefer a game with 10k players who aren’t just trying to fatten their e-wallet for god knows what purpose then 30k people who never interact with anyone other then moon rocks.
---
Please olmeca. Is chaos over? Is nullsec fully reverted back to safer then high sec?
---
Brave Newbies 4ever 7o
---
I see it as a typical modern day office. You have management and you have sheep that do what they are told. How or why people just want to krab in a game such as eve with all its possibilities is beyond me. Nullsec is dead
---
Feel you bro, 09 birth, but did do alts...unsubbed on 9 years 6 months. Didn't sell or delete everything tho...have one of each t3, a few faction bs and all my main caps and all my alts and mains in a losec station with good clone bays in range...you never know when the next Iron Bank might pop up and fund a tidi war, and being skilled and sorted enough to log in, do the cool shit and fuck off if I want to, really appeals.
---
Best of luck though, see you soon x
---
bro 😎💪
---
many people played less and less over time during the blackout. while they were not playing eve, they started to remember other things they hadn't done in a while were fun and even found new fun things to do. the broken local or "rolling brownouts" decreased consumer confidence in the ability to make the game work reasonably well. 
---
Reversing the blackout does not reverse the bleed out.
---
Yeah no you don't get to insult me like that fuckstick. Go fuck yourself asshole.
---
Sounds fun
---
I used to log in most of my account every morning/evening afterwork regardless if i was gonna play. I would have them ready. 
---
Now the idea of clicking launch on eve over poe or overwatch is just silly. Blackout/not-blackout/cyno changes was a lot of people methadone. CCP helped us break the habit finally.
---
I can generally wait till the event is over and redeem everything all at once. I suppose if I left it any longer than that I'd probably forget about it and let it expire.  Also probably helps I have one main per account and have enough SP I don't feel the need to rush to allocate it.
---
Just plain wrong. It takes a month to skill a frigate to V with supporting skills. You have the skills any other frigate pilot has
---
Cheeky slag
---
not really
---
220m sp - flying tackle is the best role, it requires skill.
---
Pretty sure they are also head of the ‘balance team”.
---
Wrong. A tech one frigate is cheap. Even for newbros
---
I don’t get why they joined both sides beyond the obvious of they wardec around jita and faction police are hitler.
---
You are one of eves main problems. You contribute nothing of value and make these sweeping statements that hold no merit.
---
Just downloaded the game after a long time. Was removed from my Corp during my absence. All my ships and items are I  the corp stations in null sec and my character is still in 1 of the stations. 
---
Can I access the stations freely to get my stuff ? Do i need to contract sell my stuff? What is me best option here to retrieve my assets or liquidate them?
---
Seeing the same thing, I think its also the VNI changes, vni's were the primary ratting ship before the blackout and the vni change for real players not just bots, with the black out plus the vni changes people are just not happy with having to rat in ships worth three times the value which cant do the job as well as the old vni.
---
Iv had friends tell me the above is their reason for not coming back.
---
well if it makes you feel better,

Oh, my god. A giant replica of the WiS station door would be next-level trolling
---
So you're gonna fight a real gang with a small gang and sacrifice ships for ewar to fight their logi... do you even numbers
---
Ha you think someone would invite him to a party
---
Thanks for the suggestion! 
---
So I wouldn't want to speak to the priorities or plans of other dev teams but I can say that as you no doubt have noticed one of the things Five 0 (my team) have been working on in recent patches is improving the first few hours and days in New Eden. To do this we have a huge list of things we want to improve and fix, based on suggestions from the dev team, our customer support department, the CSM, and the playerbase at large. We've been prioritizing that list based on a few things:
---
* The amount of new players who will experience the issue
---
* The negative impact the problem has
---
* How much development time the improvement will take
---
The idea has been to ship a large amount of medium - high impact improvements (or if the potential value of the change is reasonably low then it would need to be very easy to improve). Together we hope that the packages of improvement can have have a noticeable impact on early player retention. So far we've shipped two packages, and are currently working on a 3rd (now on Singularity) and at least a 4th package still in Dev. I personally hope that we can continue beyond that point with more and more of these packages.
---
Without making any promises at this time (game development is a fickle beast and I'm only one developer on one team), I can tell you that problems with noobies finding corps and corps finding noobies is on that list, and pretty high up in the priority. We have some early ideas for improvements (ranging for low hanging fruit to more extensive features), and if/when we get closer to it we'd love to hear what players in general (and recruiters specifically) think of these ideas. Rest assured we're talking to the CSM about changes on this list as well.
---
I hope this sheds some light on where we're at! Thanks again &lt;3
---
I as a pvper and hunter basically stopped actively hunting and searching for content. Kinda lost hope in ccp after they reverted the blackout. Unsubbed all but one toons. I noticed the same from most corpmates.
---
This is what he tells himself when the roams brave space in his cloaky t3 popping salvagers and ratting cruisers. Those were veterans.
---
No your mom keeps me company
---
Of course not. They were never fighting wars on their own, they were called in to help one side or the other and help tip the balance with their cap fleet. So it's like they would blue up with other people. To make them stronger. And make sure they could take on an enemy. Almost like they were making friends and fighting together. But yeah blobbing is wrong and only Goons and TEST do it and they bully their neighbors grrr CCP!
---
Why does no one here understand that classic wow has taken most of the casual and a good number of the more hardcore players. Give it a month or two and people will start returning from  wow.
---
I’d take a pvp ship or two. IGN: Fisher Kel 
---
Good luck with irl, it’s scary out there.
---
This is what he tells himself when killing salvagers and ratting cruisers in his cloaky t3. They were all veterans.
---
Or in case you don't change your mind,  can I have your stuff?
---
All I’ll say is o7 gf
---
Thank you for the detailed response. I appreciate the insight and feedback. Looking forward to seeing you in Vegas if you are making the trip this year. Was fun having a beer and chat in Toronto last time.
---
Wow such uwu
---
Yes. People saw that if enough people complain, that’s all that matters. People complained and we got a shitty knee jerk with blackout (I liked the goals, but the execution was shit)... then more people complained and we got a shitty knee jerk removal. 
---
We want CCP to step up, provide vision and actually execute. Instead, for the first time in a long time, they claimed they had some vision and then folded almost immediately. Pick a path and actually put in some effort or the game is done. Might be done already.
---
&gt;I can’t find any motivation to invest any serious time to this game anymore because there is no point. Hilmar can wake up any day and shit on whatever he will feel like. 
---
And that's the problem right there, it just doesn't feel like its worth it to sink large amounts of time into a game when the CEO may at any point just flip a coin and decide to invalid all your time and effort to favor a tiny slice of the player base over you because they screeched the loudest and longest on reddit.
---
the type of person to quit due to blackout is literally only kept playing due to inertia and lack of an actual life
---
I never said it was not a legitimate way to make isk. It is not what I do since I have better ways to earn isk, but other people mine to make isk and thats fine. 
---
Stop projecting.
---
Just store them in the system "virtual" vault. 
---
From there you can deliver them to a structure of your choosing in the same system.         
---
So you need to put up a structure in the same system to have access to those items.
---
Man if you really need to compare the second biggest coalition (38000 people) in the game needing the help of the biggest coalition (45000 people) in the game to beat a coalition half its size (18000 people) to BL. (2000 people) an alliance that could only get 100 people in fleet dread bombing people to make you feel better about yourself go ahead lmao.
---
Its clear the Tapi victim complex runs deep.
---
I can't  cringe any harder than I'm cringing right now. "toxic" lmao get out dude
---
&gt;PL will come...they must come
---
Montolio was ahead of his time.
---
Yep, flying around in a cloaked ship in null, solo, and only taking fights you could win was silly. Very low risk, it had to go.
---
Sounds like a legit approach :D
---
Regular heavy or cruise missiles are going to apply very poorly to frigates and cruisers. Missiles have an explosion velocity and an explosion radius. If the target is faster than the explosion velocity or their signature radius is smaller than the explosion radius you do less damage. You have four levers to pull: reduce their speed (webs), bloom their sig (painters), increase explosion velocity (skills, flare catalyst rig, missile guidance computer), and/or decrease explosion radius (skills, rigor catalyst rig, missile guidance computer). If you have T2 missile skills, then you can load precision missiles that have better base explosion velocity and radius than normal missiles of their class. You can also go down a missile class and use rapid launchers. So use Rapid Lights in a cruiser or Rapid Heavies in a BS. Oh there’s also implants to help with missile application.
---
P
---
The bonus of having better missile application is that it applies at almost all ranges your misses can hit (other than webbing of course).
---
Back at you
---
just must never engage in ship pvp
---
Blackout probably made a lot of people's lives better. It was the intervention or wake up call or whatever you want to call it that a lot of people probably needed. Let us not hate the krabs for leaving eve. Let us congratulate them on leaving this toxic community and shit game to go have richer, better lives.
---
it is you never know what your going to get and or how tanky the target is
---
lol you say that like the loss of players stopped, it didn't, they were constantly losing people throught the entire event, they pulled it because they could see the player loss wasn't going to stop.
---
Well.  I don’t and neither does CCP.
---
Your own personal playground where everyone has to play your way or get out is a hell to others
---
Make your own game company, make your own game where you kick out people who don’t play your way... but don’t drag that selfish toxic attitude to ruin 20000+ online and active accounts for your own self
---
... proving every point i’m making.
---
Your only attitude is hatred and blame and that’s not healthy for anyone
---
I know, but until I decide whether to or not then redeeming would be silly.
---
You speak [da Tru Tru.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4kWQSpCbvo)
---
image thinking you´re relevant because the company where you scrub the toilets lands an order.
---
you act like someone can't light a covert/regular cyno to bridge people into any null system they want. Maybe the next chaos change should let people light cynos in WH's? Lets see how you guys like the chaos.
---
Killing off 40% of the playerbase and rising was proof that the “toxic” way wasn’t what exists
---
Whether you like it or not, the “fuck everyone let me get my kills and kill the game to let me get it” 
---
is... a minority.  
---
Like it, hate it, blame me for it or the evil god master mind you wanna blame.  That’s reality.
---
Whoop! Gig'em!
---
Farming simulator exists. So does wow. So does candy crush. 
---
Eve has depth. You are only swimming at the surface
---
I, too, am an Aggie who plays Eve
---
That's a whole lot of numbers. There's about "500" people in the corp I'm in. You'll never even see 10% of that in fleets. Bigger coalitions always have way more dead weight than a small scrappy group.
---
Regardless of that nonsense just because Frat is currently the smaller coalition doesn't mean they will be next time. Maybe they make new friends and start a new war. You're jabbering on about TEST blobbing. We were here. Frat moved in next door and we had some tussles. They blued up as MA y blues as they could get and we had some more tussles. Now they still live next door but we're pushing back. You can't decide if your narrative is reee Eve is dying there's no content or, reee Eve is dying because blob fights. We've got lots of stuff going on. I hope you find your happy place.

BR: [https://zkillboard.com/related/30000478/201909191100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000478/201909191100/)
---
AAR: Just a heads up, the BR is going to be inaccurate at first glance because there were two engagements in FR46-E with different pilots and reshipping on both sides. The video only shows post downtime.
---
At 1030 EVE time, the OFVH-Y ihub in Detorid timer came out. While a clash between Legacy/FI.RE and Winter Co began, both sides were able to reship easily since their respective stagings are only a few systems away.
---
I did not join until after downtime. Immediately after downtime, there was a small fight that resulted in FRT backing off until more could return from downtime. At this point, Legacy is 20% away from losing the timer. There are several nodes in FR46-E so Legacy splits up its fleet to guard each of the system's nodes.
---
FRT returns to FR46-E and lands on the node I am located at just before the rest of Legacy can regroup (you can see two Legacy dudes die instantly). FRT is eventually forced out after this battle. While they do reship again, they do not rengage. As a result, Legacy wins the OFVH-Y timer along with three more i-hubs uncontested.
---
I intentionally left a part of the video at normal speed (starting at 3:50) to highlight our fantastic logi bros who essentially deny 6-7 kills through me and to show the mistakes I made so everyone else can play better the next time they end up in a large fleet engagement. GF!
---
where is that top 5 listed.  I want to see who are the other 4.
---
2008 player here and I feel the same. Nothing matters anymore in this game.
---
the most disturbing trend I see is your continued posting
---
Charge them a flat monthly fee and save yourself a headache
---
This is why I have issues with blackout. It would have been fine if they actually had a plan for why it was that way and how it actually can be fixed. Because null needs a bit more than their version of "delayed" local.. they need a real delayed local not OPT in local. Because I understand why some nullbears were mad. I was hope this was there way of releasing observatories but clearly I'm wrong and burger needs another hit of that herion.
---
Hell I left NS many times due to cloaky campers which is basically the same reason why blackout is over. It buffed CC's to much, to a point where every system was a spooky Scarry cloaky Proteus..achem sry loki.. infested pit... simply because they had no verification that any pvper left it was there in the first place. So dude logs in for the first time today unless someone's been in that system all-day he has 0 insurance that he's remotley safe to undock.
---
I come from whs so I know how it feels at least with whs if I kill them they won't be coming back any time soon. This isn't the same with ns's accessibility. Gates can't be closed after all.
---
That's not really 'chaos', that's just a really dumb mechanic that should be fixed.
---
... That’s how I feel you play.
---
It’s okay to disagree.  I won’t tell you to quit eve over a disagreement
---
You shouldn’t either.  It’s a game everyone play their own way and that’s what makes it so successful.  You think you want the world to only be your way and everyone else can leave
---
I think that’s a horrible mentality from a very closed minded and bitter person.
---
You say farming games exist.  I say first person shooters exist. 
---
Let’s agree to disagree.  Telling each other “there’s other games” is useless
---
So if "your way" is to subcap crab just enough to fuel your PvP, your still the bad guy and lumped into the hate. Despite not enjoying the crabbing while your doing it. Broad generalizations are bad, either way.
---
Goddamit I paid you good money to pretend to be wormholer could you stop exposing this on reddit already.
---
Have asset safety only on accounts that did not have an active subscription for several months. Problem solved.

Thats just over 10 million SP, not including drone skills, armor tanking skills, shield tanking skills, weapon skills, or EWAR skills.  
---
Even if they only went to level IV on all of those that i listed, thats 1810200 SPs on top of  a very high probability that the pilot is going to on an alpha account with an average attribute selection. So a whopping 15 SPs per minute.  
---
So EXCLUDING: weapon skills, drone skills, intermediate/advanced armor/shield skills, weapon skills, and EWAR skills, that is still 83 days worth of training. Stop talking out of your ass bud.
---
Free of any subjective view here: Blackout wasn't good for *every* playstyle. Some might have just quit because theirs was effected in a negative way and they didn't feel like dealing with it.
---
I'm hoping for a broken as fuck dread that can delete the current supers and titans but doesn't have the ability to apply to subcaps at all CCPLZ.
---
There has not been nearly enough time to gather enough data to even begin spitballing.. But please, tell us where you are finding all of your in-depth analytics other than, "Hey, where's Tim, eh?"  "I dunno, eh" "Ok, eh."
---
in my 10 years, players not logging in out of the blue is nothing new. The unspoken fact is that more players LEFT because of Blackout, which is why there was an immediate revert. Come talk to us after 60 days... which is how long it took them to realize how little they know about their own player-base.
---
I feel you on that. 
---
I had mistakenly had an account open for around a year when I wasn't playing and didn't have any skills training the whole time. I opened up a customer service ticket and they gave me around 24 mil skill points.
---
I mostly used them to get into some of the more advanced doctrines I couldn't fit into but also spent some on ISK making stuff like PI. Still have around 15 mil sp just chilling, waiting for new doctrines. Also thinking about spending some on Reactions soon and maybe even some manufacturing.
---
The problem isn't having a change reverted because it's "killing the game". The real problem is changes reverted because it hurts CCP's wallet. It's been made abundantly clear that nullbears own CCP's wallet due to the shit ton of accounts they use. So being, if a change makes this population decline, CCP would revert any change for the sake of keeping these players.
---
It's the same logic with bots. I never believed CCP's shitty excuse of "we can't do shit against bots". They have been very capable to do precise strikes at given times yet are unable to analyze data of characters that are ratting in a Super/VNI 23/24 7/7 ? Please, don't try to make me believe that, because at the end of the day, even a bot is a subbed account.
---
Nobody is actually blaming CCP for wanting to make money out of EVE. What people are blaming CCP for is jeopardizing the game for the sake of short term benefits.
---
I see a bunch of people sitting outside of a pos toasting a tcu that's sitting in an anchored bubble. Is that right?
---
Thanks for the concise reply, I understand now. Thank you
---
HR: afternoon HoD, Hilmar has told us you aren't using your office and that you missed a meeting with him? Unfortunately we feel you aren't a good match for CCP anymore.
---
HoD: err ok. But the door to my office was just painted, same for Hilmar...?
---
HR: Yes, but you still didn't attend the meeting or use your office.
---
HoD: !
---
HR: We understand this is difficult, but if you could clear your things from your office and leave asap...
---
HoD: I can't get into my ... never mind...
---
Security: Hi HoD, when you're ready, just leave through the main door...
---
HoD: I'm ready... *thud*... wtf?
---
Maybe people have lost a lot of faith because CCP has handled the whole thing terribly
---
Yes, but the POS guns will slaughter anyone that attempt to contest the toast.
---
“Back at me”? Back at me what? That you agree PvP is becoming a rarity in Eve? That Krabbers **Expect** and **Demand** total safety? That playing the game for a PvP experience has actually become a hated play style by your polarized group? 
---
I can accept your play style. You are the one who cannot accept mine.
---
honestly, i not logging in much not due to blackout or end of blackout.
---
though the start of the blackout defenitly started my lack of activity.
---
but more because there doesnt feel like to much purpose.  no "great" wars going on.   and even prior my activity was dropping as the wars were mostly blueball astra/raitaru bashes with extended kill time due to dmg cap.
---
so its been sloping down for a while.   blackout just sped up that slope. and even with it over...doesnt changed what started it
---
i wont say i quit. cause i'm still watching discord, eve news sites, and forums....waiting for something fun to start.
---
i'm just...not as active/invested.   peacetime is dull.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu1mbsgo738
---
&gt; What kills the game is you making people not log in
---
good. eve is way beyond its point of redemption. and like the sick dog it is it should be put down by what remains of its community.
---
I had the opposite experience years ago. Lost most of my stuff in a station that ended up flipping Sov. Ended up getting it back after world war bee and it was an amazing feeling to have access to things like my first carrier, and a bunch of ships that were fits that couldn't undock anymore (drake etc.). 
---
It's like real life, always keep a stash of stuff safe - because you don't know when you'll lose your home. It wasn't the end of the world years ago, just required a bit more forethought into where you wanted all of your stuff, and how much stuff you really could afford to have at any point.
---
Proof Eve is the longest running beta in the history of gaming.
---
did they finally remove falcon's face ?
---
You must not have very much stuff if you really believe any of your ideas are decent.
---
A lot of people took a break from Eve or just altogether quit. Its harder to regain subs than it is to lose them.
---
I am trying to figure out the link between my message and the fact that you talk about cynos, but I really can't figure if it's supposed to be serious or just you sperging.
---
The amount of people playing this game began reducing way before blackout. And tons of people left the game due to the krabbification. It's exactly because of that now CCP finds it harder to reverse the krabbification. So let's not fool ourselves that just because CCP pulled something drastic and angered the Krabs that it wasn't the krabbification that wasnt killing the game for last 4 years now.
---
Cheaper stuff doesn't mean better game. Proliferation is actually oppressive to tons of playstyles and eve balance is actually depending on some assets being expensive.
---
You want Eve as an asset acquisition game, basically a version od Farmville, and think many people enjoy that game and I'm trying to make them quit. You gotta face the fact that Eve as Farmville has 2-3 years lifespan for a dedicated individual krabber. That's the time it takes for the dude to get into all accounts and assets he wants. From that point, when he doesn't have anything to do with the assets, he quits. And the other playstyles quit due to either effects of krabbification across Eve space, or macroeconomic effects like Plex inflation. 
---
That's how you get organic stagnation 4 years straight. That's the horrible track that CCP is trying to take Eve out of, and it requires some of the Krabs doing less krabbing and doing more other things. It requires a reempowerment of other playstyles than krabbing. And it will cause some people who have nothing else than safe krab in this game to quit. CCP shouldn't overdo it and upset all krabs. But they have to change the games path. So I'm sorry if you liked the krabbification and didn't have sufficient command over the Eve ecosystem to see how it's harmful, but it's been killing the game and needs to be balanced.
---
Lmao im not talking about next time. Gosh you really need to rationalize blueing as many people as you can dont you. If that makes you feel better thats good.
---
I def see this and agree 100%.
---
keep trying maybe you'll get there eventually.
---
The player count is dropping therefore we should make it happen faster
---
What is this a bad disney villain?  “Humanity is stagnating.... THE SOLUTION IS TO KILL EVERYONE OFF”
---
That’s like a bad meme.  You say “ecosystem” and “harmful”.... people play the game.  This upsets you, i get that.  You think you’re smart for finding solutions that abstractly fix the fact that people play many different ways
---
And you’re wrong.  At least in this, you are wrong.
---
I'm surprised that its taken this long for this to happen
---
I’d bold at you in return that hunters expect and demand totally effortless pve hunting 
---
But i’m on my phone.  I accept your playstyle, you cannot accept anyone else’s even if you want to think you do.  
---
You just said otherwise, thus i repeat... back at you.  You will never see a view that isn’t your own
---
&gt;Some might
---
any opinion can be true with that statement
---
There’s that evil villain movie plot meme answer we all love.  Upvoted
---
At least you admit that as a goal lol
---
Does that work?
---
It´s what fueled the game for the larger part of its existence. If it doesn´t anymore there is really no reason to not pull the plug.
---
No. Citadels aren't allowed to be anchored within 1000km of a TCU. But apparently not POSes!
---
Other than the hundreds of thousands of people that play and enjoy it.  But fuck them amirite?
---
Lol that's adorable. I don't play Eve . Carry on butthurt son
---
Nether of these things should be allowed to sit invulnerable in storage. Sell them, gift them or move them into a Keepstar you think will be there when you get back...
---
Well no one was ever so scared of combat they needed to do this before 😑
---
After they demonstrated that they don't know what they are doing I would imagine that the owners of the game stepped in and put a stop to it.  Next up new leadership at CCP hopefully they will be better.
---
I don't know how to respond to this inelaborate emotional text but I suggest either educate yourself on Eve ecosystem or keep being shocked why a 500 million dollar company keeps biting the bullet and is ok with alienating some of its players. Nobody hates you. The way you were playing was harming the game and it's getting balanced.
---
sure, why not? they would be better off playing better games.
---
Every day I feel we get a new reason to think the CCP dev "team" is down to about 3 sleep deprived people who never actually have time to finish anything they work on which is why so many things look work like they were only halfway thought out.
---
Too little, too late.
---
Idk how or where you arrive at that point
---
That's exactly what you said.
---
This is pretty much my stance as well. I quit, came back right before Blackout, had a blast but knew it was kinda an extreme move given the pure safety people were accustomed to, and have effectively quit again.
---
CCP doesn't have the ability or nuance to balance the game in a way that makes it healthy long term, and not catastrophic for the short term.
---
Well if I said some *did* I would've been lying. I do not have any kind of relevant data to back that statement up so "might" is litteraly the only thing I can say. 
---
Also you are nitpicking because you full well know what part of your comment mine was aimed at. You suggesting that all people that quit during blackout litteraly only player because they had nothing better to do with their time is just an attempt at hiding the ever present "fuck crabs" attitude this subreddit has. Being objective is apparently not possible here.
---
I am going with the fact that you are just a stupid troll looking at both your flare and your BS.
---
and you sound like some random angry WHer
---
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
---
We are still here and we still welp a lot.
---
We have changed over the years but the spirit and fun factor is still at our core.
---
Due to mechanics we are still at war and in same mitlia. Yes this is so we can use jita.
---
We do still have ffa etc but not as often now it’s more meme themed fleets, Cal Mal roams. We did just kill a very successful pilots 190 kill marked vagabond with t1 frigs.
---
While the never ending forum posts of people complaining about nothing to shoot at just join us. If we can’t find anything else to shoot we will shoot each other.
---
Happy hunting o7
---
Well POSes are gone soon
---
Are you really talking about poaching in a video game?
---
People found fun elsewhere, why is that difficult to understand?
---
Which is not the case since I don't live in a WH, but okay.
---
Awesome post, couldn't have said it better myself. The krabs spoke with their wallets (myself included). Like I have said before, /u/Olmeca_Gold is the worst CSM ever. I hope he is happy with himself now that Eve's player count has dropped to 10k.
---
This is extremely helpful thank you.  Rapid T2 heavies with precision missiles sounds fun.
---
This aged poorly.
---
what did u do for 10 years of eve? 
---
did u have to plex urself with isk for all those years?
---
So much butthurt.  Not enough lube?
---
so, no examples?
---
Talking some psychology . The game needed a villain for people to fight against. In most cases the players are the villains like Goons which drives people to join a cause or  to form under a banner. CCP could have made players villains like they have in the past . Drone wars for example, Fountain war another example, WWB as well to an extent was based around CCP announcing citadels . But this time CCP made the game itself a villain . Which backfired in a massive way, as CCP expected ppl to take up on the challenge while people gave up on the game itself. There are many reasons for it ..many of which have already been covered elsewhere in reddit.
---
 you can if you're grappled :)
---
Nice news
---
So, it's *not* actually allowed.  When Aegis sov hit, TCUs were moved to planets, so you can't have a POS on grid with the TCU.  Buuut, TCUs that were already in place (at moons, like in this case) weren't removed.  So, that setup has pretty certainly been there since pre-aegis
---
&gt;\-people joining the game probably dont know about   
---
&gt;r/eve
---
r/eve does way more damage than good. Best the new players avoid it.
---
Congrats on winning eve, see you in a few .
---
I was in BSB channel when he lost it.  So sad.
---
&gt;You suggesting that all people that quit during blackout litteraly only player
---
what?
---
&gt;because they had nothing better to do with their time is just an attempt at hiding the ever present "fuck crabs" attitude this subreddit has.
---
huh
---
what's wrong with your brain
---
2009 player here after coming back from a 5 year hiatus. 
---
the game has improved so much in so many aspects.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish.
---
Dude i know right those Inner Zone Vanguard skins are sick af
---
It's not the krabs (for me industrialists) fault. Its CCP for making the changes and for the nullbloc leaders bluing and taking the "fuck you super super umbrella" approach. It sounds like you're lumping the guys who just like the idea of building fleets and empires from the ground up as the bad guys. Or at the very least telling them "no you cant do that anymore"?
---
As always theres always going to be a need for people to build the things you all want to PvP with. Regardless if rorqual excavating is a thing or not (I've always wanted to fly one but that was before they became the best miner, which is dumb). 
---
I agree capital proliferation has become too much and that null is too stagnant, but it seems like whether I mine in hi sec or null sec theres a special hatred for what I am doing and it is becoming more and more obnoxious.  
---
I am also not particularly for or against blackout, but dont think it should be so binary.
---
Actually people  yell  40000 MAN COALLITION in every second thread, so yes, raw Alliance numbers do matter  to alot  of people
---
I've fought them recently. Good fights.
---
Yes. Since you're counting Imperium who has a single SIG deployed to help TEST.
---
&gt; Nether of these things
---
*listed 3 things*
---
**blank stare**
---
Also why do you end your posts with ... ?  I know people who do this and I can't for the life of me understand it
---
I'm not rationalizing because I'm saying whining about it is super dumb. I'm saying you're a dummy. But I guess since we're basically BFFs after spending all this time together we'll keep talking about it.
---
Why is blobbing now bad, but it will totally be fine when your on the blobby side next time? I'll bite your worm wiggly mate.
---
You would just be running MWD for no discernible benefit at that point.
---
Had to check now when I got home but you can at least use T1 Gas Cloud Harvesters and the Venture should work fine with it.
---
Oh thanks for pointing out that typo its fixed. 
---
If you don't get the second part think about it again maybe you'll figure it out.
---
I used to think CCP had no ideas or plans for fixing this game. 
---
Then, I had hope that they did!
---
Now, I've watched their plans wither and fail, and know they probably don't have the balls to try again even if they had a second good idea. 
---
btw any ccp reading this: **competitive PvE**.
---
Update: I recently found [a list of what appears to be (nearly) every single typeID the game has ever had](https://www.adam4eve.eu/info_types.php), and I am currently rifling through it like a madman. I also discovered, via [the latest Hoboleaks](http://www.hoboleaks.space/Singularity_1568456-1569552), that CCP will change the IDs of certain objects in the game; open up "attribute changes per type" and scroll down to "Anchoring Sudenic Damavik", you'll see they changed the typeID of the wreck.
---
Do you think this might be one of the reasons some ships that showed up on your old site appeared to be removed from the game? It would certainly explain why the typeIDs for the Garmur, Orthrus, and Barghest are different than the typeIDs for "Mordus Frigate/Cruiser/Battleship".
---
Or maybe not. That list doesn't have the corvette prototypes, nor does it have the Sphinx, Sculpture, or Tyrant class ships. It also doesn't have the infamous Nibelung mining laser, though to be fair, your site didn't have it either...
---
&gt; edit: and if you are interested in EvE history, there's some neat stuff behind that Enigma. Someone killed a drunk dev in nullsec one time... kinda famous pirates but I can't remember them, but they did it. At the time, CCP just gave them a big PLEX and a pat on the ass before they took it away.
---
I heard about that.
---
&gt; Later, someone got a Cockroach killing a tester in the wrong place on the wrong server. They took that away too.
---
Heard about that, too.
---
&gt; Recently though, some guys got a Cockroach basically in the same way, and CCP let them keep it! A player now has a testing ship that no other player can pilot because it takes a Polaris skillbook. I just think that's neat.
---
But I did *not* hear about *that!* Holy shit, do you have any more details?
---
&gt; I wish the earlier guys could have kept their trophies too, 
---
Let's be fair, CCP didn't let players keep OP ships and modules that those players shouldn't have been able to get their hands on in the first place; everything else has always been fair game. It's nice to see they're letting that slide a little now (at least for things that will never be more than a trophy in their hangar).
---
&gt; but I like to see CCP getting on board with game principals. No one is safe. Not even a dev.
---
CCP has *always* had that attitude. There have been several occasions when someone has managed to get a Dev killmail for bragging rights without any repercussions, like [when players saw a Jove battleship spawn and decided to kill it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag2bKpxvDx8).
---
Also, I gotta love the thought process that lead to that decision:
---
"It's a new faction! Are we war with them?"
---
"No, we're not."
---
"RECTIFY THIS"
---
"soon"
---
Nah mate. That’s your narrative, not mine. Like I said before, killing your ishtars and myrmidons is boring. We might shoot one if we run into it, but we are not ever looking for them. There are a few players that get their rocks off in collecting ratter killmails, but I would not say they are the majority , nor representative of the typical PvP player. Make all the assumptions you want, but it’s an extremely narrow minded way to view a sandbox like eve which makes you seem like a very simple minded player. Like I said before, I can accept your play style. You are the one throwing a tantrum that someone killed your myrmidon.
---
Ok I'll baby step you through it.
---
Bob plays eve
---
Bob likes to PvP but needs isk to buy ships.
---
Bob's life is busy/complicated enough he does not want to explore the myriad of options and chooses simple ratting and/or mining to earn isk for PvP.
---
Bob is using a faucet in a way that was designed and is healthy for the economy. He buys ships and blows them up, he does not horde or create excessive wealth. He subscribes his game time. He is good for eve.
---
Yet because he crabs at all, he is a filthy crab who is ruining the game. He receives hate and scorn from those "elite pvp" people. 
---
The generalization is harsh, and does not apply, yet Bob is painted with the same brush. Why, because people deal in absolutes. You may intellectually understand this but it is not a part of your minds first consideration.
---
Shall I continue?
---
You have nothing else to point out besides the obvious. You're just screeching with the "Olmeca bad reeeee" narrative instead of actually reading the comments that reply to yours.
---
It's really such a simple solution.
---
The POS code would like to know your location.
---
I'd love to hear your story, but don't give anything to me. Hell, don't give anything away in case things change and you can come back to a game you love!
---
So basically RPing a Sleeper?
---
Better it dies than leave CCP's economical health up to skill injector buying whales. That's not a game I want to play in. It's like Archeage all over again.
---
dude
---
Olmecca s entire csm campaign involved shooting pve people
---
I will make assumptions when the vast majority prove it right, you can call it martyrdom and other dramatic whiney phrases to downplay your end in it, but your stance is poison to me as mine is to you.  
---
Youre very narrow minded, and simple minded, and i can accept your playstyle.
---
Back at you.
---
The giant rocks in the middle tackle the rats for you.
---
No.  I point out my side.  
---
If that’s screeching to you look away i’d feel so very bad if your ears got hurt or something
---
there is no 'fuck crabs' attitude, it's a minority
---
* Cut capital insurance payouts in half
---
* No more remaps/attributes
---
* Ansiblex generates fatigue for capitals
---
* No timers on low power structures; full power citadels retain their existing timer system (where defender chooses) but if they go low power the structure can be destroyed without any timer at all
---
* Capital build cost increased back to legacy values (they were reduced a couple years ago)
---
* No ABC ores from hisec moons
---
* Ban capitals in FW space
---
* Buff data site payouts to match relics
---
* 1/3 of wandering frigate wormholes are now cruiser sized instead
---
* Sleepers and NS rats now prevent MJDing
---
* Skill injectors can only be used for battlecruiser and below skills, subcapital and support skills (not caps, cap weapons, capital navigation, or capital industrials)
---
* SKIN prices reduced by 50%, now obtainable in-game to reduce PLEX inflation
---
* Rorquals no longer mine; their legacy role as a booster is restored but they need to be on-grid to boost
---
* No asset safety in null sec
---
* C3s now have two statics - their existing HS/LS/NS, plus one w-space static
---
* New player experience streamlined, window transparency fixed on low-end graphics settings
---
* T4 abyssal sites generate suspect timers again
---
This coming from a wormholer.  Why don't you tell me what wormholers actually do for the game.  I get wormholes are convenient for travel when the right holes line up, but what is it wormholers actually do?
---
How many articles and news stories are there about wormholes.  Its not like wormholes generated any attention on the level of B-R.
---
I don’t know how to respond to your egotistical self centered blathering either
---
I suggest you educate yourself on what a video game is
---
You’re a cancer to the game because you aren’t satisfied playing it your way, you aren’t satisfied with winning where you choose.
---
You have to destroy everything that you disagree with to be happy.  You’re a megalomaniac, likely a sociopath.
---
Or, as i’ve called you before.  The worlds most elaborate troll.  There’s almost no inbetween
---
It's a passive aggressive way to end a statement and you want to elicit a response.
---
How you don't know this after so many years on this planet...
---
See?
---
... Then go play what you would rather play man.
---
There are no chains on you
---
Yeah I might have been a tad generous
---
I play eve extensively, along side guild wars 2. Arenanet and CCP seem to be following the exact same formula. Eve has ship skins, gw2 has mount skins. The game is being neglected big time, the pvp/competitive devs seem to be totally out of touch and have no fucking idea what they're doing in regards to balance and the content they're giving us is lackluster. But at least they're selling ridiculous amounts of mount skins.
---
Ditto.
---
Plus the fucking clouds are really bright. At least with my settings.
---
&gt; whether I mine in hi sec or null sec theres a special hatred for what I am doing
---
I'm not sure there is such widespread hatred at this point. If anything "elite pvper" or "risk free ganker" is more hated.
---
No it means if you lose your stuff you start over. Your skill points are still there. It's not hard to start fresh with you come back. Even just running some l4 missions you can make hundreds of millions of isk in a week.     
---
The fact that asset safety makes spending (weeks?) Destroying a structure gets you nothing is retarded. It's not the players fault this whole station/sov/safety system is a wreck. Back in the day you lost your station you lost your stuff, you took the station back you got your stuff back. It didn't basically transport to security stations.    
---
Either you have conquerable stations where you have to take them back, or you have a station you can destroy and enjoy the loot.    
---
Current system makes smashing structures insanely hard and nearly worthless. Everything about null and sov needs a rework, even if it was just a flat roll back to 2010 to when there were just npc stations. No safe places to hide in every system etc.
---
&gt; it will totally be fine when your on the blobby side
---
When did I say that? If as the second biggest coalition you need the help of the biggest coalition to beat a coalition half your side you are a coward and are bad at the game and your victim complex will always hold you back.
---
LOL olmeca terrorized miners, and that’s ALL he did. He was the extreme minority in what he did. You’re just upset I called you out on your bullshit above. If you want to live in a fantasy that’s fine, but people with your mindset are the reason eve has gotten so stagnant. I only jumped in here because I read your stupidity you posted above and decided to call you out for it.
---
&gt; Yet because he crabs at all, he is a filthy crab who is ruining the game. He receives hate and scorn from those "elite pvp" people.
---
The way this guy is playing the game isn't harming the game at all unless he's defending risk free boson ratting or he's a 15-boxed Rorqual miner. So I'm not sure why you're directing your example at me.
---
Amount of SP doesnt mean much really, doubly so since injectors. but thats just an aside.
---
Tackle in the types of fleets and fits newbros are using does not require skill. They are used basically like a hobgoblin I, send a bunch of em out, hope they get something done, hope there will be enough left for next time. Hit MWD, spam warp disruptor and web, wait for the flash of death. Thats the experience of a newbro fast tackle in a cheap fit condor. 
---
Source: was exactly that back when brave was a few hundred folks, was that in goons shortly after, eventually found more interesting things to do with my time. Saw it happen to a bunch of us new guys.
---
&gt; egotistical self centered blathering
---
&gt; You’re a cancer
---
&gt; You’re a megalomaniac, likely a sociopath.
---
&gt; The worlds most elaborate troll.
---
Now who's hating who, by your words, "at real world political tier proportions"?
---
I cant risk blingy faction BS money but anyone know of a good maelstrom fit for solo/small group pvp? I want to try this now
---
Looks good to me!
---
On a related note, I've been meaning to ask the CCP devs just how much their work is hampered by your infamous legacy code problem. When you eventually manage to kill the last of it and then burn its printed-out carcass in the harbor (livestream it, *please*), how much easier/faster do you anticipate your work becoming? I'll admit that part of my curiosity comes from learning how to code myself, but the rest is from eagerness to learn when you might finally win that battle.
---
After reading all these complaints about the blue donut and no one fighting, I'm starting to wonder why the big coalitions don't start blowing each other up for the sheer hell of it.
---
what travel in eve is best? self destruct.
---
The official forums are awful. They've got this crippling 'be nice be respectful' policy, heavy-handed censorship, and you can't even *Dislike* there. It's a the milquetoast pedant's paradise.
---
Well, they couldn't release a movie that openly glorifies fascism, could they?
---
I’ve been playing less than usual, but that’s because of WoW classic. The minute there’s a war, I will be back 24/7.
---
such insightful commentary
---
Ah yes, the ping-warrior blues.
---
if they were aoe damage clouds ratting would be better lol
