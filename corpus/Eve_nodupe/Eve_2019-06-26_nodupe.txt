Came to watch some PvP ended on the hospital with epileptic seizure from frostline event, thanks soldier. Will watch it again :P.
---
---
---
We told you when we came. Not here to ruin the game just yours.
---
&gt; They're also the same people who bitch every day about the game dying because nearly 90% of new players quit.
---

---
Make that 99%.
---
hey im playing albion online too!
---
You joke, but I assure you your comment made some devs salivate.
---
Small baby steps, I agree, but this is not the first baby step that CCP has taken in this direction.

Yep, he’s pretty great. Love me some Paul Harvey.

Wts lessons on how to awox PL titan move ops.
---
You're misunderstanding what I'm saying. If the reigns were took off the AI and NPC factions could truly aggress capsuleers in Delve, we would not win.
---
I see you're confusing NC with PL
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I know you eat up the propaganda/splerge your alliance/coallition puts out
---
but at least get the right alliance for the splerge :(
---
First of all you must consider that all the bullshit you read on this subreddit came from a really really small part of the Eve community, most of the players don't even know that this subreddit exist, so don't take all those complains too seriously.
---
So many people live in null, I would say the majority of eve players (but I don't have numbers to prove it right now), is it possible that they are so dumb all together to stay in such a boring part of the game?
---
It's possible but it's more likely that they simply have chosen the best place to play, that's what usually people do, choose the best place (or at least try).
---
Most of the people here think of themself as the most suoerduperelite pvp guys, just because it sounds cool (just like those idiots with big and expensive cars), but many of them have alts in large nullsec blocks.
---
Why? Because it's where you the the best opportunities.
---
For what? Everything
---
In large nullsec alliances:
---
- you don't have to worry about finding content (alliance provides tons of it)
---
- you don't have to worry about structures and maintain them (which is a pain in the ass, alliance do)
---
- you have opportunities in every aspect of the game
---
- you don't have to travel like a moron from one corner of the universe to the other to buy and sells stuff because they have huge hubs.
---
- you don't have to defend all alone your most precious assets (size does matter and big alliances have a lot of players that help each other)
---
- lot of people means lot of fun, you have the opportunity to get in contact with so many people and not play always with the same people.
---
- lot of help for newbies (Eve is simpler than in past but it's still a damn hard game compared to the others)
---
Well these are only the very first reasons that I have in mind but there are many others.
---
There's specifically a limited time tag too though
---

---
It's not about big guns. It's about SP. If you have a character with 30mil+ skillpoints it's kinda waste of all those skills to fly only small stuff. And you miss a lot of mechanics that don't really come into play with small ships.
---
Also those corps never really become much anything in this game. At least for me it was important for my group to slowly become stronger and fly variety of different sized fleetcomps. Sometimes even frigs if the situation needs it.
---
Lol their whole alliance is just an autism awareness campaign
---
*stuka.
---
The cease and desist letter is already in the mail.
---
Yeah I’m still over here playing apex wondering where everyone is at
---
Nothing more to conquer - m8, India is right there...
---
Nah, *sad face*, nothing more to conquer - dude China, is right over that hill.
---
Nope, I have beat everyone..
---
We ain’t blue to Test or DeadCo.
---
Last I checked, PvP meant 'player versus player,' one-sided harassment is not PvP. And don't give me that usual 'well if they're getting harassed they should just ship up in combat ships and fight back, then they'll stop' because quite frankly most industrial players I've met find EvE's PvP about as interesting as watching paint dry and will avoid it like the average individual avoids nails grinding on a chalkboard. Let's face it: PvP is not something EvE does well.
---
Friend showed me a video of an update where it made his Legion fly backwards. Weirdest I have seen.
---
If NC&amp;PL steamrolled the Imperium this comment would still be here. Someone has gotta win.
---
I am pretty sure I am one of the Rorquals in this video tethered at 1:16, lol. Saw Brisc hugging another Rorq in a ceptor. He said he was getting footage for a video! :D
---
Then you were never actually going to log in. So it makes no difference.
---
This was a better title....
---
Stop asking stupid questions on Reddit and do a nyx roam already
---
Yes
---
\#eve2019
---
The thing that really gets to me is not that they blued them at the time - it made sense then and I will openly defend that position. What's so frustrating is that they're still doing it today.
---
You survived your existential crisis, Test. Move on. You're plenty big enough to stand alone now, so do it.
---
No
---
like 24 hours if i remember right.
---
Embezzling to pay for my kid's college fund is WAY better than embezzling to pay for my cocaine habit!
---
Unironically  been playing Albion non stop for last 4 months. Are you guys in a guild/discord? Lfg hellgate
---
When Concord wasn't invincible and a group of players were killing them with RR battleships and CCP interfered to tell them to stop. They didn't and got banned.
---
and maybe they shoot cruise missiles that do dread-size damage to sigs that are super-sized.
---
Yup.
---
All 6 members left in PL are shocked
---
Check your math again.
---
So strange......
---
logistics are easier and more accessible than lowsec lmao
---
I now want to boosh everyone that displeases me.
---
What if you got like, real close to warp speed, then just turned everything off? Wouldn't that throttle the ship into a target just as well?
---
See you there.
---
lmao completely forgot about that band
---
Is that why Teestan GayTuna took your CEO of DnG?
---
dont forget to pay the drama tax
---
But I like sitting in discord like a ratchety old uncle dispensing useless wisdom to the younger generations.
---
Yeah. I really liked the idea about titans basically being movable stations to base out of.
---
So what you're saying is diamond npcs are npc capsuleers. Because players are flying the same ships as the npcs, capsuleer technology is just pay-to-win.
---
This shit always starts somewhere
---
A long tale of accidents and fuckups kind of fits with the TEST mystique better.
---
not blue to test btw, we fight all the time!
---
Dude, this sound horrible... Im in! o/
---
Albion is pretty neat.  I tried playing it for awhile with some EVE dudes but some sort of dramabomb happened and everybody split up.  Is there a good EVE vet group running around again?
---
I've not done this for a while, but in the past I have observed belt rat battleships will warp away if you kill the frigates accompanying them.
---
Oh hey, we also run a constant HG weekend party there... I wonder if we met yet XD
---
\&gt;  WWB was lost because Goons refused to stop the bleeding in SMA space. 
---
That's more the reason the war started, not ended.  If the exact same situation happened, but we were able to blob supers like we do now, do you think we would have lost Dek?
---
\&gt;  The only reason Goons aren’t still in Deklein is pure complacency 
---
Right.  Of not having enough super caps.  Fixed that.
---
\&gt;  this helicopter dicking on everyone smaller shows they learned that lesson at least. 
---
My point exactly.
---
What part of my post is wrong?
---
Its honestly pretty weird how 20b is now just throw it away money.
---
Honestly?  I think its because less and less people want to put in the effort required to maintain corps/alliance/coalitions.
---
Nah, they whack a few JF's a week in Jita.  That's where the ganking happens most these days.
---
Not arguing with you, just felt like mentioning that they still have us for some good fights. We had one just the other day. It was fun.
---
I don’t understand how he has so much dps that’s amazing and worrisome at the same time
---
None of this is relevant at all to the current events man
---
Sorry, the guy I outsource for answering questions isn't here yet.
---
You need to do something called resource wars. Check Eve U wiki on them.
---
I dunno, I saw Tapi as the place pilots went who still had the one ball hanging in their sack.
---
For goons at least, titans are no longer a big investment. You can see that in Tribute with the massive titan blob being dropped on every random structure.
---
Some new super-titan would proliferate just as fast, and become the latest "I win" button for cashed up players.
---
You'd think that some point along the way, the director would have asked whether that's really the name of the song and/or someone else would have asked why there's a giant egg on set.
---
Imagine thinking TAPI doesn't have corps that low recruitment standards.
---
Courier bots are nothing new, although I suppose these are way more sophisticated than the ones that used to be in Ingunn a decade ago.
---
Yeah, but India succesfully fought back. That is not fun.
---
Do you know who the best thieves are?
---
Of course you fucking don't because they don't talk.
---
Popular criminals are the retarded ones.
---
All hail the farmer for it is they that will lead us to paradise.
---
I just wonder what mittens is going to do? Tell all the goonies to stick around for an exciting 253rd night of Titan conga line dancing? One would think he would have realized if goons win (and eve dies), his multi penny empire goes away.
---
We should have a krab appreciation day.
---
Hell, mission agents already have us working for them...
---
I don't see anything related to Local. Do you think there should be a delay, or any changes to local in nullsec?
---
I really don't see how that statement is relevant? CCP, generally speaking, doesn't just delete that money for whatever reason, and this would be a way to relegitimize the isk while also using the working in-game economy without creating SP out of nothing.
---
Yes. Using fun bad ships or using weird fits is quite normal in tuskers. Sometimes fighting the blob and losing is more fun than warping off and hiding. Flying cheap helps us afford whelping.
---
Sure it's some nice playing rough, but lbr you two are best buds.
---
Something something reapply yourself and become active again?
---
people pay more for less (officer and abyssal mods)
---
If it was a certain corp in PL, this would be an amazing setup for a pun, since you're thinking of Hover Flies/syrphid flies.
---
great write up :) looking forward to chatting with you again at the next event we meet :) And ofcourse share a beer or 2.
---
There is nothing wrong with shooting you best buds for content.
---
hmm, that actually is slightly painful.   about the same price as feeding 600 fit titans.
---
Of all people...
---
what? youre complaining about ncpl fighting you a lot, when you did the exact same last time. How is it not relevant?
---
:thinking:
---
Now imagine this NPC reaching out to everyone nearby and then several people show up to help. Will they team up against the NPCs, or will they fight each other to reap the rewards themselves?
---
That's an old one... back in the M00 days I believe
---
No yes no no no
---
Nice
---
/u/CCP_Falcon this should have been in alpha pots. What the fuck do you guys think you're doing?
---
Stop making me feel sad about drinking with you twice last weekend because of stupid shit like this.
---
nibba, hmu when y'all play. i'll need a temp link though i'm not outing my ph spai
---
TEST going to war with Goons could be summarized as ‘and then TEST went north.’ If Panfam can’t/won’t, you can bet TEST doesn’t have the capability to take on Goons, because TEST doesn’t have the capability to take on Panfam.
---
what?
---
Maybe
---
On the contrary, I am in a good position to appreciate Krabs as I wouldn't have my Eve content if they didn't thrive.
---
Yeah but those are a permanent bonus, not one that expires after 30 days or whatever.
---
I was originally in my corp, when they were in Provi. CVA's "intel" system is so effed up, I ended up telling my alliance leader to "consume phallic material". I failed to check out who it was exactly that was trying to convo me, I wouldn't have done so otherwise. So several months later, when not just my old corp, but a few others, decided to relocate to Delve, my old CEO sent me a very nicely invitation. I have been with them ever since.   
---
And as a rule, I don't tell people to "consume phallic material" anymore.
---
They had a patch that deleted boot.ini
---
Fair enough, but the point still stands. Unless I misunderstood, he was saying there are skills an alpha trains that can never be extracted, which is not true.
---
https://youtu.be/Z4Vk3AvIX9w?t=170
---
No, you join the biggest botting coalition in EVE instead.
---
at this rate the 2019 winter plan of ncdot allying with frat and test to go burn goonland is on schedule 
---
rooting for winter contant
---
Oh man, someone set this up again when Hoover leaves PL, we'll have a round 2.
---
If I plan on not joining any corporations other than my starter and play solo by setting up home and making friends with locals, is there anything that I'll be effectively  blocked from doing in game due to the politics of not being in a corp?  Obviously things will go slower or be harder as a solo capsuleer, but what will I straight up miss out on?
---
Your argument is predicated on your enemies having supercap superiority during WWB, this isn't my point and not what I'm contesting.
---
My point is that those supercap opponents dogpiled on the CFC when it became clear that the CFC were just going to roll over and lose space when they gave up on SMA, long before "Moneybadger" became a thing. The whole mess could have been avoided early on.
---
I think there should be a ship above the Titan now
---
FanFest Iceland 2020!
---
Shut up and buy plex and extractors so Papa Hilmar can get some RTX
---
I mean, we have a HS static, so we have a connection to within 5j of jita or amarr about half the time. Its super simple. people stock the fortizar and corp contracts too so it builds community. Thats what you ns dudes lack, you dont even know the people you play with. chains are easier than you think too. We have 87 active people according to zkill, everything is always scanned out https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98443830/
---
He was saying that you can't extract them while that account is an alpha. Basically what he's saying is you have to sub the account with money or plex once before the SP farm is up and running (and therefore the account "free", i.e. self sustaining).
---
maybe this time you can do a fight that isn't 1k+ vs 100?
---
I’m here now, so I shoot fc?
---
Can confirm..... One of my best friends in Eve became an un-best friend because I accidently removed roles from one of his alts. Safe to say his revenge was taking 4 macherials from the corp hangar....
---
lmao you have what like, dozens of keepstars? stfu retard h
---
Pretty much.
---
"We ain’t blue to Test or DeadCo."
---
Hilarious! Thanks for the laugh.
---
I'm pretty sure everyone will get it
---
Throwback tuesday
---
You think I didn’t know what they meant to say? Gotcha. No I understand what was meant, I just had no desire to struggle through the rest if that’s how it started. Typos on a phone is understandable, happens all the time. But the type of person who uses loose instead of lose is just....meh.
---
If you think the OP is in Panfam you're even dumber than you appear.
---
This PoS (piece of salt) is a CSM ..
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah, I just thought of burners as being the anomic missions, rather than anything that can be pulled in the station
---
This is very informative and helpful, though there should be a recognised ‘severe’ to ‘high’ autism scale as a separate measuring function. It is such a complex condition and honestly needs multiple tables and graphs to explain per person.
---
One of the reasons I jumped a lot of corps despite being happy is because either the social interaction mandates (having to be on comms) is overwhelming and exhausting. It’s why I’ll never make it a requirement in my corp now. A lot of people have been openly hostile or just not pleasant to deal with, so I just really find it difficult to talk to people when overwhelmed. There have been a lot of insanely kind people though that I like.
---
A big issue I have with EVE is I get temporarily obsessed with something, like a faction or set of skins. This is difficult for mist people to deal with and I think they struggle to talk to me.
---
I think a lot of players in EVE overuse the term autistic without understanding it. A lot of behaviour they call autistic really isn’t.
---
I enjoy the game a lot and wanted to give you the point of view of someone who is internally a lot more challenged than most people that play that have autism. I’m happy to answer more questions etc if needed.
---
Was interesting for me.
---
Certain Autistic tendencies are pretty common in most people tbh, but someone with autism is neurologically very different to the normal person. My brain scan would look different to a normal persons, and my brain processes information in a different way.
---
You have been wooshethed
---
And that's ... the rest of the story.
---
and here I am losing a 1b rookie ship
---
I like olmeca. kiss my face
---
12*
---
See, coyote wasn’t even there for the drop when we were being bug zapped by sentry rorqs. What he doesn’t know is that I tossed everyone who lost a blops a couple bil of my own
---
Exactly this. Don’t be afraid to ask them if they struggle with anything.
---
Ughh jve burnt my bridges with bovril but there are still amazing dudes in that corp.
---
My hand to God, I thought Tolon had been banned years ago.
---
I feel bad for you.
---
Neither does. You either join them or not. Deal with the consequences.
---
Olmeca will change that!
---
I use pushx to move PI through highsec, from my wormhole’s static linked system to Jita
---
Okay let us go through this again. You expressed surprise at the fact that people lose t1 cruisers in a 1v1 with hecates. You then went on to cite caldari cruisers as example ships that beat hecates, ignoring the other 75% of t1 cruisers in the game (aswell as ignoring fitting choices, f.e. i'm pretty sure a ham navy caracal will lose to a blaster hecate, while rlml will beat it).
---
So you tried to substantiate your claim  with an incomplete data set, while also cherry picking examples that suit your point. That's what is called a logical fallacy, and therefore my statement of "wtf kinda logic is that".  
---
Does that clear it up?
---
I'm not sure mittens would be quite so welcoming, I think he has a bit of a rage boner for uncle suas
---
A
---
Wrong alliance.
---
*hic* same
---
You will miss out on: Major fleets, fleet mining in nullsec space, corp battles, all of wormhole space, most of nulllsec space, capital ships, ISK income in large amounts, and way more things not listed.
---
? imperium routinely roams Eso trying to provoke fights and gank rorqs.
---
&gt;:thinking:
---
It’s ok, my sentiment probably triggered you into posting, but much like your short stay in PL, you won’t do anything about it either lmao
---
You need to be in a major nullsec faction, or have connections to one.
---
do you have a fax alt?
---
And neither did goons. Not when it became obvious that there is no chance.
---
I'm not sure if you've heard of our lord and savior jump freighter but I beg to differ
---
I’ve never had one and don’t plan to start now.
---
I don't think you know very much about BL, I know everyone I play with
---
Yes, and after the meatshield regions fell, your defense of Delve was legendary... oh, wait, no it wasn't - you left out of there before the invasion even came. Just like you did later in Deklein.
---
I know this comment will get flack, but I agree with addendums.  Only 1 per empire, and no two can be in the same alliance, so everyone has to decide on there own, in their own way on who gets which one.
---
So 4 total, 1 Caldari, 1 Amarr, 1 Gallente, and 1 minmattar.
---
I say this because of the fighting alone for people to able to even try to build one. And alliances trying to sabotage each other to stop another from being built.
---
Stay gold ponyboy.
---
They aren't.
---
Unless it's a strat op.
---
Or someone that isn't either of them is on grid.
---
Or its a Wednesday.
---
So that would make you?...
---
lol
---
thanks for the salt
---
I mean... do you want us to not be blue to goons?  Or do you want us to attempt to invade them?
---
Cause if it's (A), then ... that's where we are now.  If it's (B), that would be dumb.
---
I dont know about the rest of you , but It's worth it to me rather than spending 10.00 on plex then selling for an injector and really getting nothing out of it . 250 days of train time in my que and Im getting a bit frazzled not being able to do what I want and enjoy it .
---
SUAD is pretty terrible. B0RT stopped requiring a Reddit account and then stopped requiring a pulse. UKOC seems nice. SPVG is basically the only thing holding the alliance together. Everyone else is there for the chicks.
---
Can confirm. I've been paper pushed from habit like 5 times now.
---
More plz.
---
He hasn’t played in like a year lol.
---
I thought of one other thing that would help generate content...  Each one of these should have a unique power system that requires them to be within 10 jumps of there representing empire for 1 month a year.
---
So the Amarr one would have to be near Amarr space to recharge, the Caldari one near Caldari space, Minmattar near Minmattar Space, and finally the Gallente one near Gallente space.   
---
This will force content at least one month a year for each ship respectively, and since they probably wouldn't get built at the same time, they would be doing this at different time. Also, obviously these can't dock up or Tether.
---
Imagine drinking enough Red 40 to contract actual spodbrain instead of the usual ADHD.
---
Downvoted because no mention of how OP having Corp uniforms are.
---
He burned a friendship over 4 machariel hulls? What a douchebag. And a shitty thief.
---
Organized slap fights with your buddies don't count
---
Yeah that’s not always true. Most of the time it’s slightly unprofitable. 
---
I used to have 2 accounts I used for industry and mission pulling alts. I used them as SP farms when they had the skills they needed and I took a small loss on it. But overall it was more than worth it as those characters were worth billions a month in income. 
---
It’s like that for a lot of people with isk making alts.
---
There is a CCP created mission channel that last I looked had a fair few people in it.
---
Nyeaahah
---
No, that would be Bastion
---
Proof the server needs a wipe
---
FC, what is a bluetral?
---
When I had my full setup going I had 2 accounts for industry and mission pulling alts.  I farmed those when they had all the SP they needed. Cost me a little each month usually but those mission pullers were worth about a billion each a month and the industry guys another billion or so each. Very worth even a couple hundred million loss to make the billions extra I did.
---
but they should be warping cloaked is what I meant.
---
Awesome video like always
---
Black frog and PushX will both do it but you’ll have to package up all your ships and lose the rigs or fly them out. 
---
It’s pricey from low sec but you can get it out.
---
I let whoever wants to live in it live in there as long as they have doctrine ships in our staging. Wormhole life is just not my thing personally, I never wound up enjoying it but I do respect it.
---
Big ass fights
---
Big talk from the people who sat in NSI hiding anything bigger than VNIs from cloaky campers lol
---
Why? I love bashing
---
I bought 8
---
Outsourcing mining hmmm. We have outsourced building websites and creating an app... that's actual outsourcing right? I think any decent corp would attempt to transport/mine/harass enemies themselves. Hisec transport can get fucked though, clearly you just contract that shit out, over collateralise and hope for the worst.
---
I'm subbed but inactive. Waiting on mittens to finish his little tantrum.
---
Looks like it.
---
I feel like your bio doesn't contain a valid permit friend
---
You understand theres a +20% damage across all types for 1 week in this pack right?
---
Currently?
---
No, yes, no, no, not really
---
Or Vigil Fleet.
---
Well it’s PL... I mean... what were the chances anyway?
---
The only one of these things that does happen (having others haul shit for you) is the only one with an in game system to ensure the services are rendered. Nothing like that exists for any of the other stuff to ensure that it gets done.
---
Expected reply from someone who thinks Null Sec strat ops are fun.... good talk
---
I didn’t know about it, I think a lot of people didn’t know about it, and it probably has been abused by people that did know about it
---
I would guess that 1 isk is about 75k-90k USD then, that's a family of 4 with fair clothing, in a modern 4 bedroom house with plenty of home-cooked meals for a year
---
Largely in favor of what you're advocating for here. Just remember it's not just SW drones. Every EWAR drone is not only very poor in efficiency but is also competing with DPS drones for the bandwidth. As long as you can launch Acolyte IIs, why would you ever launch Warrior SW-300s? or EV-300s?
---
is RvB still a thing?
---
Nice vid dude. Hope to see more.
---
That’s mostly Init, I was in there for a while and they don’t like test at all. But normal goons don’t go whaling in eso very often
---
See, the thing is that that only applies for certain areas in certain countries in our own world. What defines as "comfortable existence" can vary from person to person and place to place. It could be as little as $30,000 or as much as $150,000, even just within the Western world. Not to mention how little data we have on dirtsider standards of living and COL.
---
It's a ridiculously vague statement akin to saying "1 credit is equivalent to the cost of a house". The standard you're using for comparison varies wildly based on where, when, and what you're talking about.
---
You get help from them any time you think you might need it and help them out whenever they think they need it. If we attacked the Perimeter keepstar for real you had goons ready to help. When you needed help defending the cyno jammers you’d anchored in FRT space, you called goons.  When goons tried to take the SH1 ihub the first time, and we had a chance to win, you came. 
---
For all intents and purposes you guys are one big Coalition. Just because you aren’t always blue doesn’t mean anything, Horde and NC. reset each other all the time but we’re still Panfam.
---
I'm pretty sure the narrative is that NCPL is invading provi right now, not that they quit playing
---
I mean have you seen sister bliss actually do anything besides post cringey leadership updates.
---
Just downvote him then upvote him.
---
XL missile buffs are dope!
---
Even though lets be real here, INIT are some of the best pvpers that Imperium has left.
---
Not everyone in big alliances is interested in being a perpetual blob. I like the infrastructure.
---
Lol, that's too funny.  INIT. has constantly had to batphone for help from the rest of The Imperium every time they extend their hand.
---
I really wish that INIT. would grow weary of their time in The Imperium so that we can erase them and show everyone else for what they truly are, just like NC., they are a bunch of has beens and never was'.
---
Because everytime they undocked they’d literally get blobbed with 2-3x the numbers? 
---
You want them to feed their titan fleet to those numbers to save keepstars worth ~3 titans are you stupid?
---
Plus NC fought a lot in subcaps even with 2x the numbers, but obviously was limited in the engagements they could take
---
I could see that being good, side A jumps in a faction titan to entosis risking many hundreds of bill for an extremely tanky entosis ship. Side B either has to escalate to kill it or lose the sov structure. 
---
Could lead to a lot of cap fights.
---
Great work!
---
As a new player I learned quite a lot from Kil2's videos. It's good to see this style of video making a resurgence.
---
This is going to kill EVE just like Abyssal modules did.
---
My point being if you want to put those SPs to use on bigger ships you can do every other activity besides FW. Back in 2013 when I last did FW (just getting my shit sorted to start at it again) people still flew and fought in FW fleets as well, including battleships and even capitals. If they don't now, well, that's on them. You shouldn't need a silly control pocket arena to get you to want to fight.

I wonder if you could character transfer to a new account and buy this for the same character repeatedly. Effectively $25 per million SP if that's possible.
---
...I'd rather just have a second Titan and do 100% more damage than waste money injecting a &lt;35 day alt just to be able to use this booster
---
Ironically that makes them more money than buying subs yourself.
---
Shh! You're wrecking the goon narrative that they actually care about their pets.

Only if you have under 5.5m sp. If you were subbed at any point, you could train above 5.5 and then extract any skill, regardless of being subbed or not..
---
remember that time you lost ships in EVE Online? lmao! im here to remind you about it 5 years later
---
No.
---
My entire argument in the first place is that eve is pay to win and that buying SP directly is QoL change for the buyer.
---
Not even just for your countries main meet
---
Go to your state/ city meets when possible
---
Eve is a social game, might aswell be social and chill for beers and food with fellow nerds

But I installed it this time

Calling my buddy Trump. Your Country (American right?) needs you running the State Department ASAP. I think maybe we could bundle a few others in for you to handle too.

If only there was a way for some top down passive income 🤔
---
CCP shouldn't even allow you to fly regular Titans.
---
This is the kinda response I see from killing krabs; not quite what I expected from a PvP group.
---
Lots of people specifically do plexes because they're capital free.
---
This. The only reasonable idea I've heard proposed, seen it many times but CCP don't care.
---
i guarantee at least one person you played with knew about it, ran the numbers, and then realized it doesn't matter at all.
---
pl had a thread about how we could do a dope dreadbomb with these after skill injectors came out, and surprise surprise, everyone with a brain realized that its way more isk efficient to just inject a 2nd dread instead of dealing with memes.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah but it's usually a 2 stage process. 1) An English backpacker decides to pinch the "Do not swim" sign cause he thinks it would look awesome on his bedroom wall. 2) A German backpacker goes for a swim in a murky billabong because OBVIOUSLY in a first world nation there would be a warning sign letting you know if the river is infested with salties.
---
Enjoy it then i guess :)
---
What makes me kind of frustrating a bit is the part where you stated "sex waiting for you at home" you mean delve or acutall something else i stated?
---
i think someones bot is broken
---
I don't think you can anchor structures if you're in an NPC corp. You can make a private "solo" corporation with just yourself in it to allow setting up structures. Just note it'll be quite hard to defend them alone. Any type of sov play will be unavailable as well since that requires being in an alliance, but you weren't going to solo take sov anyway.
---
OK - I'll post something you can hopefully comprehend without needing 'data sets' to understand the context.
---
I'll make you the same offer as the PL dude.
---
Except I'll make it even easier on you because you seem a bit 'special' - you can pick the cruiser hull. I'll happily fight your hecate in the cruiser of your choice. 
---
People make claims but none are willing to test it out on TQ. Why is that? 
---
I am happy to try. 
---
If I am wrong - cool I learned something. 
---
If you are wrong then you will learn something.
---
Like 99% of people - You won't back up your claim because you are all talk and no substance.
---
Does that clear it up? :)
---
Who were those two people that won?
---
How is this different from buying Plex to fund a nasty injecting addiction?
---
That, and someone will inevitably find a way to use them to destroy planets for shits and giggles.
---
Such a shame Trickster is getting deleted next league
---
I want the old neocom and jukebox back as well
---
Hi Dan!
---
Do it man, do it for the pun!
---
can only be purchased once per account, it feels like it's ccp's way of giving players that couldn't log on for the daily rewards their 1mill sp bonus. i couldn't because of work so im happy to spend a few bucks to get a little boost.
---
With a range of 5km?
---
Take that back! &gt;:(

Thats the fastest way to quit, get expierience first and then go with a nomadic lifestyle in a carrier.

I worked 15 years with adults which had infantile autism. No language skills, no social skills and no learning skills. Usually they also had other handicaps. 15 years I taught the same man every day how to tie hes shoelaces. We were taught to show no feelings. Had a new guy at work, he was not aware that sometimes the patient would smear shit on your neck. He freaked out. Which caused a god damned nightmare at work for the next 8-9 months. Instead of sometimes, the behavior changed to every time. And it took us 8-9 months to reverse it. 1 incident.
---
Dont think so, othetwise making cloes would be too easy I think
---
Yeah even after the changes this league I don't see it living on very well next league.
---
You're confusing a video game for the real world, mate. The two are not the same, and should not necessarily be handled the same.
---
That doesn't matter in this situation.
---
It was about a year ago, when the faction forts unanchored.
---
yeah ofc when you talk about dreads its different, but it doesn't take many injectors at all to rofl stomp in FW with a frig
---
how much with dps implants. can you break 600?
---
&gt;then extract any skill, regardless of being subbed or not..
---
This is not true unless they changed that with the big alpha update. You can only extract omega skills, the base alpha set is off limits unless you have an active subscription.
---
I have a refiner that can't fly a Gnosis.
---
How doesn't it matter? A garmur would kite the fuck out of something like this after murdering the drones first. I would not be scared of this in almost any decent fit kitey frig.
---
Or the hacker known as '4chan'.
---
Thry may not be "blue" but when mittens says jump test asks how high.
---
Ah, 2013 FW was totally different thing. Wait till you see what it has become...
---
521 is with pyro 4 , perfect skills , and  ss905.  I don't think you can get to 600 even with a 6% SS and a 6%  SH-606 . And realistically you are never going to use void.  So all these pretty numbers are cool but the 460ish you get with antimatter is what matters ( and is still really good )
---
I mean they could just leave the biggest blue donut and    Fight them , not saying they should join the north but they could prob. Team  up with some other entities a d fight against goons or tapi
---
This. I'm always relatively space poor due to pewing. I could get my shit together and sell all the shit I have spread across the Galaxy but that would mean flying there to grab it all which take away from the pew pew.
---
and doing so would attract all the pvp they so desperately want. dropping blobs of titans on small gangs.
---
Because the guy paying 600 bucks for a gimick brawler probably isn't going to slide in on your garmur. Though thebguy who bought that chremoas and died to a shitfit alfos piloted by a faction warfare farmer probably thought he was hot shit too so who knows.
---
nobody really expected "good fights" surely??
---
I only think what the state tells me to think.  And the state says...tacos.
---
XD I've never seen someone legit doing FW in a garmur. I've only seen people attacking other FW dudes in one. Or tank fitting a bait Tristan and then jumping into a fight with a garmur.
---
hahahahahahaha
---
Now that you mention, let me install, log in, and see if someone has dared remove my roles so I can throw a tantrum
---
I forgot the last song's name. I'd used to listen to it all the time but forgot to save it. The shit would get me hyped up. Anyone know it?

Changes this league have made little to no difference tbh.
---
!doom
---
I hear Final Fantasy XIV is a good game
---
Vengeance is a powerful motivator. My dislike for PanFam was minor compared to WWB veterans. I can't even imagine theirs.
---
Panfam were kicking us from our space half a year after WWB because it was funny, and we were just local content there without a super fleet. 
---
We went and got a super fleet. Then !doom said he was coming down to evict us.
---
Who knew that would make people side against them. ::pikachu panfam::
---
Well, tell this someone who is doing the logistics work for an alliance. Or an industrialist, who builds all the crab you wanna burn. Sure they are risk averse, you can't fight in a jump freighter.
---
Shouldn’t have sided with CO2 over Panfam if you didn’t want to fight Panfam. Especially if you were going to declare war on CO2 within a year anyway
---
"Especially if you were going to declare war on CO2 within a year anyway."
---
Imagine still trying to sell this narrative in 2019. GIGX is retarded, and got what he begged for.
---
Sounds great. Maybe we could get something similar to the Paladin Keepstar. Maybe a Paladin Fortizar.

mine look a little off as well,

Yeah, people were screaming like the sky was falling but I honestly haven't noticed much of a difference.  Played soulrend/bane trickster last league and ed trickster this league. Broken for both builds v0v.
---
This is 100 % a push from above CCP to start to Korean P2W implementation.
---
Honestly killing a gunned citadel is just as interesting.
---
When reinforcements are (on their way/there) that's when the real fun begins.
---
“Because everytime they undocked they’d literally get blobbed with 2-3x the numbers?”
---
Reminds me of a time. Back when init was the only one deployed. Look how the tables turned
---
Fly around, combat probes, look for structures, see if they are they powered.
---
When you go through systems, use websites like eveeye to check statics to look for what you want. Also a good way to tell if people are living there are non low power structures, and fueled POSes. And obviously if there are people undocked
---
How do i know if its powered?
---
Who cares about what happens in a alliance that does not log in?
---
Honestly, most of the people on this subreddit are part of nullsec blocs or lowsec pvp groups. They do most of their stuff within the corp/alliance/coalition because it's easier to deal with that way and have a greater measure of trust. I think the only place where this sort of activity is outsourced is in highsec.
---
It's always technically been a booster (doesn't take up any implant slots, not destroyed on pod destruction) but in terms of the name, description etc it was styled as an implant.
---
Combat probe, Zkill, a few weeks of camping, oh, and a brain
---
Hi cephei. Been a long time since i flew with BOS but it gives me a giggle seeing them kicked from another major alliance
---
Pretty sure it "When the carebearing get though, BOS runs away... again"
---
It won't say "[LOW POWERED]"
---
Or how mad people get with roles that they lost due to inactivity and weren't really planning on using either way due to not really interested in playing anymore. Its an ego thing.
---
thank you very much :)
---
[removed]
---
How do Goons get titans to be so cheap? Are mineral costs just lower there because of the supply?
---
If you see a citadel that is powered but no one ever undocks or runs sites, then mail the CEO and offer to buy the system and structure.
---
It's far easier to spend 2 bil on a fit Astra with months of fuel and not have to fight over a hole.
---
The game would improve if battle ships were the best ship and titans were only used for transporting large fleets of ships and jump bridges
---
is there some form of contact or am i dependand on his word that he will not scam me?
---
there are a lot of comments here so i am going to post a summary to save you guys time
---
ITT:
---
* PL members pressing S to spit  
---
* old school goons who remember BOS having a slight giggle  
---
* new school goons thinking BOS was somehow an important corp or that they'll be missed from PL  
---
* TAPI members who don't know what they're in for trying to imply that recruiting such esteemed corps as BOS and B0PE means they're winning the cultural war, not that they're recruiting the corp equivalent of herpes  
---
* gullible people of all persuasions biting the OP's bait, g*d bless avery
---
Looks like he fought a bees nest.
---
No, even Branch is now allied to them.
---
scan lmao
---
You can use 3rd party brokers if you want, but 2bil is not much isk so half and half can work fine.
---
They would probably appreciate the fact that you are on good terms to move out as well.
---
Rad fam!
---
Because they haven't discovered wormhole space yet....
---
No, you left on your own, stop selling this stupid shit, fight was with c02 at the time, you jumped in to, no one asked you to. Nor were you backstabbed, because you were neutral prior to the conflict.
---
mordhau gets addicting fast!
---
The thrill is absolutely worth the long respawn after a loss. I will state tho that there is a difference between a simple "gank" and careful deployment of a supercapital asset, since if it is on field it is generally either not under serious threat, or it is dead, due simply to its own power and HP level. Its position and the decisions made regarding its target selection, situational awareness and by extension how long it is on field represent the skill and danger in its "correct" use. You could look at my Hel's killboard and tell me the kills are 100% "ganks" (many of them are to be fair), but many of its encounters were also thrilling fights where the outcome was not entirely clear until we jumped out home safe.
---
Can a rapid light nano orthrus _really_ be considered a weird fit? 
---
There's nothing weird about it. It's just very poorly made and you can tell just by looking at the fit he fell into a noob trap with fitting it.
---
I was just wondering how he could think it was worth using considering we all have access to the best player's fits? I've always been fascinated with how voluntary incompetence stays around. So that's why I asked.
---
Are there still empty wormhole space? Thought pretty much everything was littered by now.
---
Bot gankers soon? Automate everything!
---
If TEST is being held together by our motley collection of ex lowseccers and provi rejects then it's time to prepare for the jita plan :).
---
Because I'm not in this alliance for my alliance. I'm in this alliance for my Corp and the guys in it, Dark can go rot as far as I care.
---
Nice video, more fights would be interesting but it's a good start
---
The Blood Raiders [did indeed use "mutagenic Insorum boosters"](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/amarr-forces-respond-to-terrorist-attacks-and-slave-revolts-on-five-worlds/) in their Deathglow attacks (also, threadly reminder that Insorum is hazardous to those not infected with the Vitoxin). However, they've had their hands on an Insorum prototype for years - since 2005, I believe, when they acquired it in the original story arc involving Insorum.
---
As I remember it, Ishukone allowed the Elders access to stocks of Insorum for the attacks that began the Empyrean War, but I believe refused to give them full production rights. The old Eve wiki page ["The Vitoc Problem"](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=The_Vitoc_Problem) mentions only "supplies of Insorum", not production methods or locations - yet also implies that all other cure-methods are obsolete, suggesting to me the Repubic is either able to purchase additional stocks or simply was given enough to last them for the forseeable future.
---
That page is really the last major update we've had on Insorum, and it's already years old. As to your real question: I suspect acquiring Insorum would still be an *incredibly* difficult task, especially considering how capsuleers are deliberately isolated from other economies.
---
I use delivery service every week
---
Let's hope you ccp adds kill contracts on structures, especially with the war hq system
---
One neut and a web later this Comet is scrap.
---
I mean, if you're set blue, then it's pretty clear we weren't keeping secrets.
---
I don't get why you're so upset over this, hear me out. 
---
Plex is generated out of thin air, can be effectively instantly traded for SP, with plex being a more valuable commodity than SP.
---
SP doesn't make you a good player either. I got near perfect vagabond skills and would probably get destroyed in a fair 1v1 because I'm terrible at this game. There's also better people who can solo a large amount of bullshit in extremely cheap and low SP fits.
---
Finally, 1m isn't a lot of SP and the fact that these are one time purchases per account (and non transferable) doesn't really put anyone out ahead.
---
Would I personally like it so the only way to accumulate SP is through conventional training? Of course. Does this make the situation any worse than it already is? Not really.
---
And before anyone tries to call slippery slope, it's a logical fallacy for a reason.
---
I understand, but like I said that depends on which particular NPCs will be given an ability to move and aggro people freely. Not all of them spawn in numbers that are limitless for any practical purposes.
---
I’m a new player, would people recommend I buy this starter pack - 1 million skill points is a lot right?
---
Unless you are Germane when you don’t want sarcastic use of nazi planes in your internet history.
---
&gt; It means "if you pay, you have an advantage over people who didn't pay."
---
Well, beyond the player skill argument, this is still not P2W. Even your own examples fail you as buying SP doesn't magically give you a way to do more damage or any other thing of that nature. A player who never spends a cent on this pack can still get the SP through conventional training or buying injectors with ISK. This is just the most ultimate form of "pay for convinece."
---
If CCP was selling better ammo, ships, or any actual commodity that effected a stat which a player can't get otherwise, it's p2w. It's a pretty solid definition really.
---
just roll into any C5 and try . take an alt with carrier for anti-figates\\cruisers and FAX if you want extra safe ratting
---
It's kinda pointless to do these without an organized group you trust. The payouts aren't remotely worth the time, it's all about the loot.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I'm sure you did.
---
&gt; I think players can have just as much input as the devs.
---
I do not mean "input", I mean actual field work aimed at detecting and removing bots.
---
&gt; Botting is also not done to achieve success in the game, it's done to make wealth in real life selling game content.
---
Exactly, and as long as wealth and success are relevant in this game, there will be attempts at botting. Which is what I've written.
---
Geez, it's almost like you've read my post but have a completely opposite interpretation compared to what I've written.
---
&gt; Didn't hacking used to be a chance based task? Now it's more intuitive.
---
Those changes has nothing to do with botting and hacking is definitely not the task that is insurmountable for a bot.
---
I mean, in the era of neural networks casually written by single folks and capable of things like learning to play and beat video games from scratch, you will be hard pressed to come up with some task that can be reasonably coded into a video game, will not be too annoying for humans and that bots won't actually be much better at than humans.
---
But like I said, you actually need CCP at your side first. Which is the tricky part.
---
Very rarely do I find whs that are empty but I find tons of holes with low power stuff in them.
---
Most systems have a structure or two in them, but a lot of those are either completely or effectively abandoned
---
Weak AF
---
keep an eye on your stapler, mate
---
Also most of the older playerbase literally have nothing else left to skill, plus skill injection
---
If only BOS had a single member that lives anywhere near Toronto or had leadership that was going there.
---
What a retardrd fairytale lol.
---
When I was there, they were taking unanimous decisiions and corp meetings were held before changes. I am sure this is what happened here. You need active members in order to coup
---
Not more boring than actually flying freighters in this game. So you get certain setup you run semi-afk and react to specific situations.
---
Some people already sort of do that with webbing escort.
---
And ofc communities like anti-gankers would be more lively if game mechanics weren't as limiting for them.
---
a quick "o7 cya" post by some inactive dir who hasn't had a kill since july 7th 2018 while ur actual active directors are hanging out IRL with PL alliance leadership does not a "reasonable disclosure" make.
---
So after Really Strong Alliance went inactive, I was looking for a new home. My old BOS friends said "come back, we're joining PL, we can drop capitals all day long, it will be epic"..... how wrong they were. Most of the best remaining PL members either left with elitist or stopped playing. Headliners liked to take us hours across new eden in bombers, then wait hours in a wormhole to, "maybe" kill a roqual. We used to pray that we didn't catch one as if we did it took hours to kill in bloody bombers...… and this was EVERY night... sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. Never have I been so bored in my whole eve career. How the mighty PL had become a pathetic shadow of it's former self. Then, the final straw wwas "high sec fleets"..... fuck that!!! unsub, uninstall, win eve. Thanks PL. There were some cool members in the hunting group, and always had great fun flying on Muck's fleets.... otherwise, PL was absolute garbage. I hope this is true, and Omega have been lucky enough to leave :)
---
I'll be at EVE Somalia. Hope I don't get kidnapped this time.
---
For BoS to have drama again can only mean one thing, sausage is back from being inactive so he can RMT again.
---
There are a lot of these, we should make a sticky or something in the r/Eve faq.
---
That said, you will loose ships and get podded, accept it, you are not safe anywhere, anytime, people will go out of their way to punish you for being lazy.
---
Lookup magic 14 skill set to guide you through setting your self up.
---
I recommend following the new player experience and doing the first epic ark available to you regardless of what you think you want to do. As soon as you’ve managed to get through that, JOIN A NEWBRO FRIENDLY CORP, even if you want to be solo most the time, hisec, lowsec, null, or wormhole space you will have a base of operations and a lot more exposure to everything that is Eve.
---
Don’t get stuck doing anything you don’t want to do with people you don’t want to do it with.
---
You really will have to figure out what you want to do, [check this out](http://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg) for an idea of the things you can get into. 
---
Fly safe.

My dad works at Nintendo and is gonna get your EVE account banned if you're lying.
---

---
For amarr it still works to use a kite Hound with MWD, but some ppl don't like to lose their standings, and this tends to be easier on the new dudes in EVE (which is why i guided a few towards Caracal + RLML + Auto-targeting missiles farming Hideaways/Refuges in hisec).
---
Once injected it lasts Until they hit 35 days.
---
keep good posting fc ))
---
You have 12 hours to post conclusive proof before you are permanently banned from /r/eve. Good luck.
---
But that's on ones that are currently listed time, not past limited time?
---
Hahah, BOS were fair weather PL members from the get go, you guys are better off without them (as long as mr rive, the mighty, is still in snigg).
---
What proof exactly? Do you need screenshots?
---
When the faction forts changed from stations to citadels there were a handful of contracts that had the id 0 in the database iirc which was the id for new eden.
---
So when the first faction fort that had one of these contracts got unanchored the server system/node etc. tried to load the entire universe and then when it got back to the same contract again it would try load the universe again etc etc.
---
So it’s not so much that it tried to load the universe but it tried to load the universe an infinite amount of times so they did a hard shutdown and fixed it in a few hours.
---
I believe all the infringing contracts (there were 10-20 iirc but only the first one crashed the server) got deleted cause they were all years old on low value items.
---
Missiles
---
Due to turbo krab symptoms local minerals are worth less than jita price which everything is based off of. So places playing 50-60 being normal goons pay 40-50 just so people can get actual use out of mineral stock piles.
---
Best practices state that all array indexes should be stored in binary coded decimal
---
I don't want to disclose real life information, but BOS did have people at Toronto who were actually active (and members of #fc, as opposed to the 'director' who made the post lmao)
---
Fuck. No. Fuck that power creep, there is no way this should happen. Have the triglav situation put a damper on the current insane number of Titans somehow.
---
I think part of the reason that retention is hilariously bad is, because CCP is HILARIOUSLY bad at understanding numbers/metrics of any kind.  They've shown it again and again, its like they pull shit out of a hat, throw it at the wall, and see what sticks.  In a year they may wipe the wall and try again, or they may forget about it and let it  get crusty.
---
so you still in that garbage shit tier alliance?
---
I don't mean you are full of shit and lying, but I AM saying it as I know mist of BOS directors. Some IRL.
---
I actually love this, so good

What new booster is this?

Use Shazam on your phone, might have it.

and lose supercap superiority? fat chance
---
Well before the starter pack was 1 month of omega, which is more than 1m SP, so your theory is kinda shit.
---
You spelt Stuka wrong
---
Nah lol, just curious. I don't doubt the dude as he went into great detail on what he did.
---
Says the ones who rolled over and didn't even fight (so what else is new)
---
&gt; My old BOS friends said "come back, we're joining PL, we can drop capitals all day long,
---
oof, how are people so out of touch?
---
Absolutely none of this is going to get implemented. The CSM is a sounding board and *player advocacy* group that exists to try and help keep CCP from tripping over their own dicks, not a ship/game balance/design team.
---
Nope. 30 days

I could see the value in wormholes, but the likelihood of having battles where that dread can meaningfully use that 20% damage is super super low.
---
this is called "fire-ship" ... search eve forums... and you will find out that idea is not new... but of course not welcome! ...
---
Ask in local. If there's no response you're probably good to decloak and set up shop.

Just move in.

Different concept of good fights I think. There have been numerous fun(ish) subcap engagements. From the other side I can say it’s not been the best war I have fought but it’s not been terrible for content if you were willing to fly subcaps.
---
Still doesn't change the fact that you're blue to only 30% of nullsec instead of 70%.
---
The killingFields fleets have an even worse name.
---
nah mate.
---
If we hadn't had people skill farming, I doubt we'd be in a position where people would find this acceptable. (Not saying everyone does. But I've seen a reasonable percentage)
---
But we have. People industrialised the fuck out of skill farming. And _that_ is bad for the game.

I had no heard of it.
---
I’m not claiming that all my ideas are novel and fantastic. I’m trying to think along with the process.
---
Maybe my idea triggers someone else to have a better idea. You never know.
---
Did your mom drop you on your head as a child?
---
So not much unlike before, where dead sticks were cluttering up the moons
---
For characters under 35 days old, no?
---
The 1M Sp is per account right? So technically speaking, is it possible to apply it to an account, transfer your 250M+ character to another account and farm another 1M SP ? and so on? 
---
If it's like this, it's really bad.
---
ribbit

The ‘Barsoom’. It compares to an Avatar like an Avatar compares to a Rifter. It has no Doomsday but it has 8 hard points that fire canister shot like a heat gun peels the paint off the walls.
---
Very nice to see more of this kind of stuff, I think you did a great job with the vid. Thank you for putting the time into making eve content, I've already sent you some feedback in dm's.
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
Not really, because you can buy this in addition to having a sub, so double the SP are generated over the same period.  It also is not penalized like normal trained-&gt;extracted-&gt;injected SP would be; this is literally almost 7 injectors out of thin air per purchase for an 80+M SP char.  
---
Sure, you can only buy it once per account, but most people have enough accounts these days to inject a LOT of free SP out of thin air for peanuts.
---
Awesome video man :) look forward to the next.
---
Calm down now... Hilmar has everything well in hand... He plays the game after all ^^^/s
---
I think that guy posted on another thread like this one
---
Pretty much however I tend to find a lot more unpowered cits now. I've been thinking of moving into a wh myself and finally gonna start scouting for one.

Do mercenary groups even still exist? When I started playing there were a couple of big ones and they were a major factor in almost every war, but nowadays I hear next to nothing about it.
---
tell him that he no longer holds it and DJ got it back around late 2016.
---
Yes you could.  It actually may even be a really good deal for 80+M SP characters if they ever have a 50%+ Galaxy/Star/Meteor pack sale again.  With every transfer you could apply this stuff to the same character, and would be much more efficient way to turn $$ into isk/SP.
---
We all know they only ban alpha VNIS, and you can't extract an alpha!
---
What is it?
---
Oh shit, yeah he said he hasn't logged on since, thanks for the info.
---
What?  It has some limits and needs workarounds to get more than 1M SP per character, but they are \*literally\* straight up selling sp for cash.
---
Most people will friendly brawl too. I’m KF, and we have an unofficial small gang that roams of like 5-10 people. We have no problem getting similar brawls in null, all day
---
Like slowly boiling a Frog. And look, surprise surprise, people are again coming out of the woodwork to defend it with the same "It's not different than... bla bla bla".
---
now this really dinos my posting
---
ask him what he thinks of the pot-bellied piglet known as wilbur.
---
tell us the response here. it will determine if you are lying or not.
---
Now you're just talking down to me cmon man that's rude.
---
This is what happens when tons of tards defend companies with "BUT THEY'RE ONLY DOING X, ITS NOT THAT BAD!!!"  It \*always\* gets worse when shady concepts don't receive enough pushback.
---
T5 abyssals in frigates can top 500+/hour, easy
---
Compared to this the searing incomprehensible pain i get in my brain when too many people try to talk to me at the same time seems very very mild.
---
Well I can’t complain about something If u are part of it
---
not anymore LMAO
---
did they get rid of greyscale's pvp fatigue
---
Exactly, and this means the 100-300b inhabitants as a number is not believeable for me.
---
We had a wormhole spawn next to our static that led to ccp space, we had a brave person jump through and fly around for a few minutes before being sent back here. When trying again, we got traffic controlled and the wormhole disappeared.
---
Zzzz... Pay to win plebs be pay to win plebs. PvP is completely different that is why each goon always fails in a proper small scale.
---
sir are you having a stroke?
---
they're*
---
Injectors were the final nail for me. I just stay subbed here to be watching from the shore as Eve sinks beneath the waves of CCP's greedy mismanagement of their own game.
---
You may have forgotten the many many wars that happened and are happening in EVE. Together planets that can't substain a large population etc.
---
Fuck, that would be depressing.
---
I did not say it couldn't be possible that so many people live in a Keepstar. I just find it not senseful to assume such a high number. 
---
And btw, you want to check those "thousands if not millions" manning a supercapital again: http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines
---
Nothing new as of yet mate I've been checking weekly for any update as I just don't have the time to play at home now.
---
Between family time and long work hours the only spare time I get is during a break at work. I cant wait to have a mobile version of my eve.. Every other mobile game cannot keep me interested.
---
ask the torpedo dudes
---
Seems like most of the eve online community really doesn't care anymore. Exactly what imperium deserves for being pay 2 win scrubs. In the end everyone will just ignore you and won't care what you lot do. 
---
Oh look 'goons'. Aren't they those pay to win isk farmer alliance?
---
Even with tournament faction ammo?
---
&gt;GIGX is retarded, and got what he begged for.
---
imagine not knowing in 2017 what *literally everyone who has ever worked with him* knows, and choosing "co2 are our friends" as your hill to die on in tribute
---
imagine making that bed two years ago then shocked pikachu posting all over reddit for two years about how panfam somehow forced you to side with co2 and forced you to get evicted from tribute
---
while dinobrains were spamming "tesco 5eva" memes all over /r/eve, mc made the right choice. mc saw gigx being retarded and digging himself a hole, and made it very clear to panfam that they weren't gonna be a part of it. mc still had sov in tribute until last month when goons took it away
---
if you'd made the right choice and distanced yourselves from gigx (who is retarded) when you had the chance, you wouldn't have been put in the position you were when you got evicted from vale, you wouldn't have been put in the position you were when co2 invaded the drones and you were forced to choose between them and fcon (i STILL can't fucking believe you chose fcon over co2 lmao), and you wouldn't have been put in the position you were when pl/volta/skillu/frat invaded last year because you'd still be our neighbors in the north
---
Does the accelerator stack with the booster?
---
dae remember the "tesco" meme spam
---
goons in general don't go whaling often, with the exception of boat and welp squad
---
if you don't fight each other over strategic objectives, you're allies
---
That's a pretty weak counterpoint. Throughout all human history, just 1.6% of everyone who ever lived has died in war.
---
never not: 'what about..'
---
But it's also init...
---
believe suas is a persona non grata after the whole space violence fiasco
---
OK thanks fam that doesn't make any sense but OK
---
I don't know, can you repeat the question?
---
Don't kink shame me bro
---
Didn't want that corp anyways.
---
Their own metrics prove whatever they're doing is not helping with the new blood.  This pack is disproportionally favoring vets, too.  If it was really "for the newbros" it would be 2 skill injectors, not 1 mil raw SP.  For 80+M SP, this is roughly 7 injectors.
---
I'm about to buy a titan (already own a super) and I haven't ratted/mined/grinded isk for months. The best isk is always finding a niche.
---
drama about small lowsec corps isn't reddit material, pal
---
You're really naive or drinking the CCReee kool-aide if you think this is for the new players.  It is a cash grab that is disproportionally better for high SP accounts.
---
You must work for CCP, as you seem to think retarded ass decisions actually lead to more revenue long term.
---
That makes sense, thank you for the answer :)
---
My alt got into PL that way
---
Oh wait
---
If that were true, the game wouldn't be on a huge downward trend, and CCP wouldn't have had to sell out on the verge of bankruptcy after going further and further down this path.
---
With how cheap these packs are, these will pretty much be free for anyone wanting a month of +20% damage on new PVP alts for the forseeable future.  Wee.
---
I must be a great thief since I utter 1 word per day. Fus.
---
I'll have to ask him tomorrow, he left work for the day.
---
Highly questionable do be shit-posting PL (or anyone else) in your situation.
---
In RSA, you were the player who never undocked for his own content even once and felt entitled to having others deliver it to you. You whined and bitched endlessly if you somehow couldn't make it to whore on whatever kill and turned into a passive-aggressive man-child afterwards.
---
Imagine being so detached from reality that instead of being thankful for the effort other people put into the game for you, you sperg like a child about anything not to your liking.
---
Of course it did, that CCReee shit survey had no negative answers, it was basically a "Do you like X?  Yes or Yes?"  Obvious manipulation to push someone's agenda to leadership in CCP.
---
Search by static. Ie: want a c2 hs + something for pi? Scan from hisec. More difficult for class 4+ holes, you'll just have to ride the chain then.
---
Nope, reputation consequences are still retarded
---
That may be fine if they had any fucking clue what was needed to keep it going.  Their decisions over the past 5 years have been questionable at best.
---
Damn i am sitting below 2milion
---
aight, imma go ebay my albion account then thanks fam
---
I'm sure at the time that nc. were told that it was just a few goon sigs and gotg could handle it just fine. Considering battle reports where gotg win or come out isk positive are incredibly rare I think you overestimated your abilities slightly. It wasn't long before sort came screaming for help but by then it had snowballed to the point where people had stopped logging in and morale was completely deflated and it was too late. Imagine now not only being worse than goons but now having to get on your knees to suck the mittani's dick just to exist. At least Fcon accepted their fate and died with dignity.
---
&gt;well its a good thing mittens doesn't login and only shows up on saturdays to do his pep rally speech.
---
When did you bought PLEX last time?
---
Well done mate :)
---
&gt;PL is dying under hedliners leadership.   They will soon be the next MC if they aren't already.
---
CCP and PA are effectively the same company, so it doesn't even matter.  Even if it did, CCP has been trending this way since way before the acquisition.  This type of shit, along with their complete refusal to put money back into EVE, is why they almost went bankrupt, fired most of their staff, and had to fish for a buyout in the first place.
---
NEW PLAYER OPINION:
---
When I first discovered that you have to spend real time to train your skills I was quite surprised. And I still think that it's quite bad feature. Why can't I grind like in any other mmo? I suppose it's just eve feature. In the end I just accepted it since I like this game. 
---
As for me, this 1mil sp pack is a great addition. 1 million sp is like month of training? I know you can buy injectors and pilot carrier straight away, but you won't get any experience piloting carrier and prob be blown as soon as you undock.  Plus it will be quite expensive. 
---
 Imo Ccp trying to bring greater start for newbies such as me. I will defenetly buy this pack.
---
Yes, but earth never had a galactic war...
---
Also, we do know nothing about life expectancy of most planets in EVE. So using a simple 1% to estimate population growth of an entire galaxy is pretty bold...
---
But there is really no need to argue on this. I dont believe that the numbers of OP make sense, thats it ^^
---
can you explain this to me? 
---
Do you mean we just outnumber you in the same way?
---
While this is courently true you may have to think about you tried to get a foothold in North. Which we could not let happen. So ofc we defended stuff there cause, "and iam honest" we knew you can not do it on your own. Maybe when test deployed at same time you could have god brawls up there.
---
Our courent Problem actually is, its close to impossible to fight gsf on their own. They field 4 - 5 fleets full of stuff while you have one. Maybe one and a half when we have a good day. The problem there is even when goons have two baltec fleets one jackdaw one bomber and one with what is left. you have very serious problems wíth your abilities to fight it. You use booshers for example and tank two baltec fleets you get warped and jammed by jackdaws, leads to your fleet is gone. Use a heavy doctrine which can hold the firepower will get deleted by bombruns... 
---
so there is that already but it is not impossible... but when then you have serious skilled groups liked init and or snuff joining in there on top of that.... you can only adept using HEAVY STUFF. When this option gets deleted too in the courent situation i would like you to give me an advice whats left to do.
---
I’m retarded
---
Deputy Industrial Director
---
I never pretended to be as good as mulita, intense or johanna…. but you're hardly one to call anyone for being a passive aggressive man child rex... it certainly takes a one to know one is all I can say :)
---
haha, nice spin! I'm not surprised corps want to leave PL... The culture in PL atm seems excellent! No toxicity anywhere to be seen! :D
---
China has the right idea., it's not an unfair advantage if everyone is doing it.
---
Yeah but who in PL isn't?
---
2 PL titans would disagree with you.
---
&gt; Ask in local. If there's no response you're probably good to decloak
---
Famous last words
---
I think everyone agrees it is nearly impossible to fight the blob, regardless of who the blob is. What Jason is pointing out is that when we first set up Hakonen as a staging we got blobbed by PL + NC + PH, as we knew we would be, but we gave it a shot anyway.  
---
Now that panfam are in the same position we were its just kind of karma that they lost their shit.
---
if you're not boson clearing havens what even are you doing?
---
&gt; Way to go CCP, another promise broken.
---
I ran out of fingers
---
&gt; I defended the alpha injectors, but this is pretty obviously CCP just selling SP.
---
Well now you see where you went wrong
---
Indeed, PL should really let inactive leadership members (say BDCI) lose their roles :D
---
Don't know about you, but my mods seldom stay in my possession for 30 days :)
---
And your real life choices
---
Thanks for the understanding :D
---
How the heck did B0PE get involved in that summary.
---
We know what NC &amp; Co are going through because we went through it 2 years ago when they invaded us in the north.  
---
I just hope for the sake of the game that you guys learn to log off reddit and put in the work to actually build up your alliances.
---
I guess you didn't logged in for a while then.
---
Yes, NC denying fights to goons means they failscaded.
---
Because they're spergy retards that kiss the ass of whoever is the biggest baddies.
---
&gt;As a CSM Rep now my job is to provide CCP with the ideas
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
Has nothing to do with being good or bad; they undocked and were helpful -- unlike yourself. You twiddled your thumbs in station with tears running down your cheeks while making snarky remarks because for whatever reason you didn't get to whore on some kill.
---
They've been killing plenty of people in Delve. Whatcha mean?
---
Im gonna tell this to my dad Mittani and my mom Aryth...
---
lol.
---
As an alternative to step 1, you can pay WiNGSPAN to find the hole for you. We will search for almost any requirement you may have (assuming it exists) and we can usually find a hole faster then you will on your own.
---
Really? i just started playing that. Need to get both chars to 4s so i can go to blackzone.
---
no.. I just didn't undock to help you because quite simply, I didn't like you
---
So time to dig a litle bit of what empire means, 
---
Definition of empire (Entry 1 of 2)
---
1a(1) : a major political unit having a territory of great extent or a number of territories or peoples under a single sovereign authority
---
especially : one having an emperor as chief of state.
---
Well They lost all the sovereignty over their previous territory, its space ofc but was their space, they went down to 0, and they lost aliances also, and also lost players over the remaining corps and alliances still inside of the coalition. But basicaly u cannot have an empire without a large territory control.
---
Planetside had a recent update moving to DX11 which improved performance by a lot. There's a lot more people playing now
---
And remember you won't be able to close any holes solo in a C1 due to the medium ship restriction.
---
Half a year ago I still found one.
---
I did a bit of scanning chains every day for 2.5 weeks before I found one, but I did find one eventually. Since then I've occasionally had unoccupied ones as my static, but only like 3 total.
---
And if someone's there, you'll send them a shipment of torpedoes, right?
---
Hard agree. It's not really making it out of thin air thanks to the minimum 5m SP buffer.
---
7o. Hey Chester can I have your stuff?
---
It is not about what BOS was or is, but about what have PL became.        
---
If you look at PL history how many times :              
---
* PL didn't have a single FC that was active enough to lead campaign        
---
* Invading enemy made PL members hide or stop to login             
---
* Lack of active people (and overall people) in alliance leaded to situation where you cannot provide a reliable supercapital force.      
---
* Newbie alliance that you created have power to steam roll you           
---
* People are leaving to other more Elite groups - aka PH            
---
* The mistrust between corporations and leadership leads to even more corporations leaving or looking way to exit.              
---
* New "alliance lead" vision is so out of touch with what alliance is that old guard that created legacy of PL mostly left the alliance           
---
Because PL was place where you went if you got big toys, wanted to use them safely or dunk others constantly thanks to cover big toys from other alliance members provided.
---
Finding your own hole is so much more fun though.
---
with added bonus of these clowns not seeding your future home with torpedoes.
---
C4s have two statics. Not C5s.
---
As someone who is trading smaller alliances are just not sufficient for me and I can’t make enough ISK.
---
As for the pvp side of things I’m part of DKS it’s our SIG where we fly mostly expensive stuff and usually take fights outnumbered or fair ones with no TiDi.
---
A big alliance gives you the opportunity to do something with everyone at every time of the day
---
Remind Me! 10 hours
---
5, one just joined goons to finally be able to undock his faction titan.
---
CCP simply forgot to double the amount of minerals needed to build the ships with every balancing pass - if they had done that, a titan nowadays would cost around 500B, not 60.
---
Corrected the error thanks!
---
Interceptors are far superior in small gang but are incredibly hard to fly well.
---
kite hound cant do all the L4 missions and even the ones it can do are sometimes sketchy
---
"have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate"
---
this is just a cheap excuse anyways which suggests that a limited amount of SP is generated "the normal way", which is not true since the SP usually originate from SP farms which scale infinitely as the demand for SP grows.
---
You mean those that undock?
---
Exactly this. You could get it for free with an alpha anyway if you can actually do the altfu. Doesn't seem as much P2W as OP promised. P2W would be like, paying CCP a bribe to lower your market taxes past the accountancy level, or give you 10 standing in Jita to lower your broker fees.
---
SP has never really been an example of P2W because unallocated SP doesn't just make you win. It's not like you can buy drugs with PLEX to give you +500% damage, everyone has equal opportunity to buy hulls and fits.
---
Maybe I'm just bitter and got enough SP anyway but hey, if you play the implant and remap game right, you'll never be too far off using things (hulls, mods) that will let you get into the fun activities you want to do!
---
Ahh, so that would stop you getting to 5m,applying your sp to get to 6m,and then extraction? Sounds like a pretty long winded affair, so good job CCP for closing the loopholes.
---
&gt; For C2's and C4's (no k space static)
---
C2's do have k-space statics. I think you mean C4+C5.
---
Or just take it out?
---
two questions:
---
1) on the triglavian invasion systems, do the rats tackle on the gates or is it safe (regarding the rats) to haul with a freighter?
---
2) on a corporation that's within an alliance, but not the executor corp: what's the alliance maintenance bill? and what happens if i'm late paying that?
---
thanks in advance :)
---
I want to hate this but I just cant. :staredog:
---
Fair point )
---
good changes
---
I don't like your voice
---
oh yes i get that. It is okay for most of us... ofc everyone has special ability redditwarriors... i personaly dont blame init for doing what you do. Just hoping there will maybe a time again where we may have a common enemy we ca shoot. Before the hate starts now i dont mean gsf.
---
my personal opinion is we go back moving around a bit... nomadic style.
---
Thanks for the write up, I'm currently looking for a C2 with HS/C3 statics, come across a few but sadly people were in them. Would it be possible for you to link a rolling BS fit?
---
They do indeed the brackets was for C4 only I edited a bit to make the distinction a little bit clearer.
---
o7, how much does something like this cost? Say I was after a C2 with HS/C3 statics.
---
A lot of traffic through Uedama was coming from that system being on the way between Jita and Amarr. It seems these days Amarr is pretty much deal. That may have something to do with whatever you're looking at.
---
When it comes to weapons you can only use the one of your race, but you should be able to use all different kind of modules that you needed to learn first a few years ago. I remember how you got the skillbook for web that you had to learn for five minutes, before you could do the next tutorial mission. That is all a thing of the past. Now you can create a character and in theory jump directly into PVP, being able to use scam and web, fit tank and rep, just not very effecient
---
If you already have 250m skill points do you really want to pay plex for transfers and $$ for couple of milion sp ?
---
This is probably most useful to people just above 50m skill points.  Still a lot to train, but everything with high time multipliers.
---
Mining is fun EvE, and if l have to go to war and kill pp who wronged goons before l even played so be it ... there is no better feeling then mining for 9-12 hrs and getting rich.
---
Total crap.
---
When I get home later I can sure.
---
My question is, why didn't they remodel the Chimera and instead of the Archon? The Archon is so dated.
---
because, similarly to this situation, all the dinoposters were out trumpeting cultural victory when b0pe, synda and havoc left ncdot for tapi
---
and similarly to this situation, panfam members who knew what tapi had signed themselves up for were chilling in the back eating popcorn, happy for them to be someone else's headache for a change
---
Guess you didn't like anyone then because you sure as hell haven't helped anyone with making content happen.
---
Either way, may want to refrain from talking shit on Reddit so you don't make yourself look even more retarded.
---
If you want a "heavy" light tackle ship then train for assault frigates as they have the assault damage module which increases resistances for a short period of time. 
---
The jaguar is an amazing tackle ship.
---
Post a selfie then
---
Meant jokingly that he was looking to expand the player base by looking for actual other lifeforms in space.
---
Can confirm, we considered it for wh brawls, didn't do it because Injecting a dread to win a fight wasn't worth it
---
sometimes I wonder if these people actually believe this or if they're just half-heartedly trying to push a narrative
---
i think the where would you like to be number is about 150 real people, maybe a bit more for comfort
---
using dotlan member counts for any meaningful discussion is kind of retarded in the current year
---
while botters fuck ccp, ccp tries to fuck the rest of playerbase
---
I understand your point of view, but i think u lack to understand mine, the complexity to manage an organization of the size of Imperium demands hard work and a lot of dedication from many members inside Imperium, Logistics, rules enforcement, training sessions to empower the less experienced over many of the diff doctrines, setting coalition goals and be able to manage putting everybody at the same table, diff alliances, tons of corporations each with their own goals...The work Mitanni and his administrative crew is notable, they were able to grow like no other due to their organization or else was quite impossible to have so many people under the same "flag"...I was also grrgr goons in the begining then i tried to experience by myself what was living inside the organization, and from my point of view was better than any other place i lived before. And for me one of the points that favor´s goons over other entities is they dont say " we dont want you because u suck" they welcome all, and not only are able to receive any pilot as they have a big training protocol with many experienced users helping others to "stop sucking" And this is fundamental over player retention over the imperium and not only ,  player retention inside of EVE. New guys are able to feel that they belong to something so its a GJ for Goons. People will always complain about the state of NS, There was Bob then there was CFC, then Imperium, Then was PANFAM , and now Imperium is back again, At least they are not elitist and they dont say fu noob u are useless .
---
I am curious. Tell us because BOS:
---
- First have not Canadian or even American directors and ppl with role, let alone sending someone to Eve Toronto.
---
- I am sure they were planning on leaving the dying PL, but not on ambushing your supers. You seem to feed Init like retards without interference.
---
Boy sure why avree is so salty about BOS leaving and has to lie about a 'plot'.
---
Reddit is the only battlefield that truly matters :)
---
Why not feed it to Init instead?
---
The reason I left PL. Can't deal with his mental disorders and schizo changes in mood
---
You are brain dead. Nothing on the item, name or description or use or mechanics has changed at all in eight years.
---
This is gonna be good.
---
With this I cannot argue.
---
This would be amazing for the game but in order for it to work every single coalition would need to break apart and that't just not going to happen.
---
When people say "INIT should leave the imperium" what they actually mean is either "INIT should leave so we can stomp them with OUR coalition" or  "INIT should leave the imperium and help OUR coalition kill imperium".
---
They are more expensive
---
I know almost everyone in my alliance even outside my own tz...
---
As autistic as it sounds, that wouldn’t surprise me, 40kdps will melt most faxes if they aren’t turbo bling fit in the tank.
---
&gt;There is no real-life money involved in the referral bonus.
---
So how do you get the referral bonus? Does your friend have to maybe spend real life money for you to get your SP?
---
Well depends on witch side u are, i dont see any fun when your organizations is been blown away and many hours of game play are basted in space. Worse is when thru black ops camping and u have your game play denied cause if u undock u will certanly die, and i honneslty dont understand the rorqual afk thing, well im surely not afk when i have more than 50B isk in space , even with theta squad available if u are afk u will die even in Delve, thats a guarantee. VNI ratting yah was a real cancer much worse than Rorqual mining. No serious investment , no serious skills , easy to bot and they spread like a fucking cancer, how its possible for Branch to have similar ratting income as Delve...i cant imagine why..."basically burning down Gotg and submiting them into a pet" well its what an enemy does to another enemy. If u dont drop the hammer the hammer will be drop on you..eve classic rule :D
---
No local in Null. During the migration of chat to a separate servers I think.   
---
That was fun
---
You dont need matches or a lighter to make a fire, its just a lot easier.
---
&gt;anyone can pay money ccp to get in game advantage and it's ok . and advantage is not win hurrr durrr it's just advantage

when you retarded on that basic level that any discussion is pointless

This has some rolling fits for 2b kg mass WH's and some general tips &amp; tricks  
---
[https://all-out.github.io/guides/rolling-wormholes/](https://all-out.github.io/guides/rolling-wormholes/)
---
You should go for Slasher --&gt; Stiletto --&gt; Sabre (those last two will work for different situations), other factions also have good ones, but those are the best imo. This is also the path I took when I started playing the game, and one of the roles I still like the most when I fly with gangs.
---
Besides Spaceship Command and Navigation skills, you should also train the Electronic Warefare related ones (and that Science one for flying Interdictors that I can't recall atm).
---
You're right. It's the density of the game coupled with just how long it takes to get started.
---
Looks more like a Fenrir.
---
Yes, or not, just makes plexes more expensive so the whales dont need to buy as many of them. So it makes them less money? Also he still hasnt paid ccp any money, someone else has. At the same time the more valuable plex gets, less people will buy plex. But this isnt a problem if youve had 20 rorqual alts the past year xD
---
Ok cool, thanks! Maybe something to work towards then and maybe I can focus on something more newbie friendly.
---
Really good job with that tuturial!
---
Oh I hadn’t even looked at that section of ships, they look awesome!!
---
&gt; Can't blame an alliance for being very well organised and supportive for line members 
---
That is totally true, but it does not deny the point that the mechanics this is based on are very unhealthy for the game itself. And while it may support and boost Goons atm, I still doubt that this will be longterm fun for them. The role model to see what is going to happen is there - it is called Serenity.
---
Thanks! I bought a slasher last night, it seems great - Stiletto will be the goal, although another guy mentioned Jaguar’s which look very strong but maybe not as fast?
---
You can do that, but I can do that too ...
---
I want to join the albion fun too !
---
Dual MASB Jaguars are very tanky and good at holding bigger ships with the expectation that you will be counter-scrammed, Stillettos are better for general tackle, but if you are actively using the tackle character then a Malediction is better (more sustain on messy grids), the Sabre performs a different role entirely, holding capitals on grid and screening against warping with bubbles (‘Ceptors screen using drive-by scrams)
---
blatant p2w
---
I hope you aren't thinking they're gonna start actually selling SP without some stupid high mark up. 
---
They'd be stupid to throw away the giant market around injectors. Right now it's 2 plex purchases per injector. 
---
Guy with the farm of course takes the revenue to plex his account, which comes from someone else, then a plex purchase to get the skill extractor, and then some nerd probably sold plex to get the isk for injectors. 
---
They've turned one item into at least 2 separate purchases from the store which looks really damn good for the books along with monthly login metrics. 
---
Also people wouldn't buy injectors anymore because fuck leaving my pocket in null or J space. I'm just gonna pay for the convenience. It'd completely ruin a stable revenue stream for them.
---
That sounds like an excuse from somebody without enough alts.
---
The Jaguar is an Assault Frigate, technically designed to do other jobs (look at the bonuses) and thanks to their ADC they'll be able to hold tackle longer at close range, and they are pretty fast and good at that.
---
The thing is, any ship can tackle other ship as long as it has a warp disruptor or scrambler, but no ship class is better at that than Interceptor. Their bonus to that kind of ewar, sheer speed and (if you use what's called a "fleet ceptor") invulnerability to bubbles make them ideal for the job.
---
A Stiletto is exactly what you are looking for imo.
---
This whole nomadic roaming pvp alliance without an  industrial backbone shit is exactly why NC and PL cant fight.  Your best option in the current meta is to go dig your feet in deep in the ass end of cobalt edge, set up a super capital umbrella, recruit like mad, krab like you're breaking game, establish coalition wide SRP and over produce super capital ships so that when the goonie goons come by to swoosh on you again you can just take the fight and results be damned.
---
500mn+100mn+mjd+higgs anchor. Fill the remaining slots with whatever you like
---
Regarding &gt;300m mass Battleships, you can still get them through 300m holes by turning on the prop mod *after* you click “enter wormhole”. Additionally, you should aim to bring a rolling HIC in ASAP to deal with overpassed holes (if a hole goes crit on your way back in you can do “HIC” passes which have a very small mass out the hole but a large mass when coming back in).
---
Adapting to new Meta means mining for 75% of the online time ... people in alliances like PL started a game some 10-15 years ago that was centered around daily pvp on all scales ... these 2 things dont go together .... so these people just quit the game (say goodbye to reasonable PLEX prices). I guess you miss the capability of thinking outside koolaid driven narratives to recogognize that current developement will hurt you as well, atm you still have structures to shoot afk, but there wont be that much anymore ever again in EVE (except your own). Take a look at Serenity Server and embrace your self chosen future ...
---
Rorqs are fine, titans aren't.
---
Yes, you are right. It's not the SP amount, it's the avoidance of sp reduction per injector. So basically it's "more" worth to transfer and buy dlc, than inject sp at 150k rate.
---
Everyone has their own opinion on how to fit a rolling BS, some fit max align time, some fit max hull tank with triple prop for escape options, some fully combat fit the BS and some people just fit the MWD and higgs rig to keep cost down if you get rolled out (it’s possible for a 2B mass hole to be under massed to 1.8B, even when not crit you can roll it cold if it’s been reduced to between 181m and 199m)
---
well, you sure don't.
---
It's a one per account deal as usual and an item that has already been there for years - newbie damage implant. Remember when galaxy packs first were on sale offering 7-8b value for 50USD the injectors were 800mil each.
---
If anything it's a good incentive to start a fw alt in a way where you don't completely suck for the first month.
---
Nice to meet you mate, glad to hear you had a great time too! :D
---
In ph the only thing that is not kept internal is hauling to hostile space, pushx ect can deal with that.
---
There is the idea of out sourcing a system to someone. Not sure it fits your question but its the closest thing a big alliance like ph does. E.g we kick hostiles out of a system then give it to a group to run the system.
---
You should go play ddo. Give an old game a shot.
---
polaron blaster enyo with mod would work?
---
&gt; And for me one of the points that favor´s goons over other entities is they dont say " we dont want you because u suck" they welcome all
---
Many, many alliances are open to most players and many, many alliances are open to shit players as long as they focus on PvP and not krabbing. Maybe NC, PL, skill u (RIP), Tri and Snuff have terrible elitist restriction like "have a dread alt".
---
&gt; they were able to grow like no other due to their organization
---
No, they were able to grow like no other by absorbing CFC entities, blueing up 2 strong quality alliances to do some hard work with them (your so called "stop sucking alliances) and were ablme to grow because turtling into a single region and taking 10k more players, most of which with strong industry and supers but poor fleet activity turned into a strong industry powerhouse.
---
The key part was having the vision to absorb everyone during WWB, turtling up and krab as much as possible for 2 years with little deployement except for SIG players and that's about all. I'm sure the internal organisation is very good but to consider it as the one thing that makes Goons the strongest entity in the game right now is stupid. It's just some good decision making and turning into full metagame industry power house rather while others entities didn't wanted to play the game that way because they just don't enjoy it.
---
Sorry he has no affiliation to gold and/or ponies
---
30 to 40 days worth of train time. Totally worth it for new and players.
---
Ok, that was brilliant.
---
when we left pl we all got kicked from dyson discord, as in the server not just the PL channel. probably the same thing
---
Everyone playing Minecraft has switched to Factorio, sorry.
---
Problem is this Pay2SP pack is super cheap and these boosters are a side effect, so there are going to be a literal assload of them on the market.  Since they can only be used for this, they will be practically free. I absolutely see experienced PVPers spending a couple bil to get 35 days of OP PVP.
---
&gt; Awesome PVP content full of camaraderie 
---
scrolled your KB
---
kek
---
r/evejobs is the recruiting sub for Eve. Good luck.
---
&gt;  i dont see any fun when your organization is been blown away and many hours of game play are blasted in space
---
Because you see your "organisation" as the core thing and not the players and the regular fleet PvP as the core your group. For many of those alliances, FC is the core value of the alliance because they are the one finding content and if the FC leave or become inactive the alliance will loose players (triumvirate was a good example of that with their many ups and down).
---
NC/PL loosing their structure is sure a bummer for them but you don't see them loosing hundreds of players for a reason, because that's not what they play the game for. They haven't lost a lot of supers, they haven't lost FCs, so they can keep going. The Imperium can't maintain their supers in the north indefinitly and at some point they will be able to build back, be able to defend rorquals and supers ratting and that will be good enough for them.
---
Just double checking, I'm talking about the anchorable structure and not the module.
---
Wow!
---
I find that everytime someone challenges your bravery, they want you to do something stupid.
---
Christopher Walken is that you?
---
i am one. living in WH is a logistical nightmare compared to living in low or NPC null. no thanks, i rather wait for ccp to fix the damn game...been waiting a long time
---
i remember a time where you didn't need 50 dudes to engage a single mining ship... how the times have changed
---
You could just give siege modules a duration bonus for emergency hull energizers. They currently work for like what, 30 seconds? Just make them last 300% longer for T1 and 450% longer for T2, etc. Now dreads on grid last at least 2 to 3.5 minutes and cant be immediately deleted, but require the use of another mechanic.
---
Stiletto and sabre both are awesome ships, but if you are really newbie you should know both are very piloting skill wise deep ships. What I mean is that while it might be hard and take a while to learn to be awesome pilot for them it is worth it in the end. Sabre's especially are a priority target often so to maximize staying alive you need pilot it and often your sabre blows up - especially if your FC makes you kamikazy buble something and you obeyd. Both are miles ahead in fun to fly and complexity when compared to f1 monkeys in fleet dps ships.
---
What corproles are available? I would like to be incharge of all structures...its has been an eve goal for some time now
---
Hm.. I have over 5.5mil SP and wonder if it's worth 5eur to buy 1mil sp
---
Why are player so eager aboutinjectedSP?
---
Just consider that everybody will have more SP than you and you will be fine! Sp wont change so much. I m 3 yo in Eve, have many character, can fly a lot of stuff with perfect skill (titan, dread, ...) it s not hard. Never inject (but i sold a large amount of skill injector :D while SP farm).
---
the real strengh IG is the skill of the player, and ISK Ig to buy nice and effective ship, because if you are a correct player, you will have the skill to fly them effective ;=)
---
Player should not care about injected SP in 2019.
---
because there aren't many reasons not to. once upon a time, infrastructure was dictated by geography, but thanks to shitadels and ansiplex that got thrown out the window. have enough resources? build your own geography!
---
it's incredibly hard for small alliances to offer the same degree of comfort and quality of life as the large ones, thanks to CCPs changes.
---
This is a perfect description of the role.
---
HIC is very useful, though when I took my first hole I left it till step 6. 
---
But the sooner you get one the better.
---
wtf where was the fc why arent u anchored and y u shootin when no broadcasts are up? ud never make it in nullsec u lowsec scrub
---
seriously tho nice piloting and commentary
---
He actually wanted to also conquer India... didn't go as expected.
---
Classic Snuffed Out.
---
pay a premium, get your system seeded by cloaky assclowns
---
There's many different types of light tackle.
---
**T1 frigates**: The stereotypical new player ship. Decently fast, but dies very easily due to low tank and no signature bonus. Cheap enough that most older players see them as almost free, so you'll never run out. Popular T1 tackle frigates are the Atron or the Slasher.
---
**Interceptors**: The fastest ship class, but also the one with some of the highest skill caps. A good interceptor pilot is almost impossible to kill and can hold point on most ships for almost forever. Interceptors almost exclusively rely on their speed and their signature radius bonus to survive, so a slight mistake will get them killed.
---
**Assault Frigates**: Assault frigates are a better option than interceptors if you're not as experienced. They are slower than interceptors and don't get bonus to point and scram range, but they can fit significantly more tank and the assault damage control which makes you very hard to kill for a few seconds after activating. Probably the best option for "advanced" newbie tackle at the moment.
---
**Interdictors**: "Interdictors are a high priority target with low tank that warps to you at zero and tackles itself." Interdictors are very useful, but they fill a different role than the other ships. It probably reads like they're just like the other ships except they can tackle multiple ships instead of just one, but the way they are used is very different.
---
if you have enough alts to close a C1 hole then you should be rorq mining under a super umbrella.

---
I don't know, I'd have thought my 3 years of sitting in an office with CCP and talking to them about the game would give me some understanding of how they function as a company, but I'm sure you definitely have a better read on them that me :)
---
I remember when there were single digits of titans... was a big deal when an alliance was able to sneak a surprise new one in...

Why does bumped JF's in jita (and other higsecs) cant login cyno and jump out from gank? i think they have enough time to do that.

Are Uranium charges good for a Medium-turret fitted cruiser?
---
We've been fighting panfam for a decade. Ever since the VFK headshot they have been our natural opponents, I think we only fought on the same side once against AAA. A healthy ingame hate for panfam is pretty fun too and from panfam posting you can tell the people they want to shoot the most is goons. 
---
It's one of the reasons I didn't expect them to just roll over. They had plenty of opportunities to take subcap fights that we couldn't reinforce easily but they chose to blueball instead. Not sure that's how you keep your coalition healthy when one if it's main cultural identities is fighting goons.
---
I will def buy this but srsly they couldve made it you got two injectors or smth and then at least wouldve come across as less fucky
---
Aww jeez. I'm sorry. You must be one ugly kid.
---
F1... Yup, that's it.
---
So if I have a max sell order I match the order 1st?
---
You didn't spell "blue donut" correctly.
---
This is the top answer!
---
I don't mind CCP giving this to new bros. Eve is interesting while you explore the basics aspects of Eve. Problem is the core mechanics suck once you learn the basics. It is getting harder and harder to get fights if that is what you like to do in the game.
---
Instead on focusing on this, CCP milk the cow with p2w offers like this.
---
When it comes to eve you cant really trust anyone, Screenshots or he is trolling you.
---
We have a very strict policy of not seeding a hole after we scout someone in. We get you in, then delete the relevant tripwire info and the agent holding the hole leaves. That is not to say we won't find you again later, but that is never the result of our locator service.
---
That depends on the circumstances, but as a rule we don't do merc work.
---
I dont see a problem here. Its a one time offer and for a long amount of time alphas could get 250 - 500k and i believe sometimes up to 1mill sp for getting recruited, which was also sp that wasn't generated through time.
---
For a C1 - C3 it is 330m, the specifics can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/0Y2HJriV). For more information you are best off contacting a broker in-game.
---
Looks like shit content. But I'll give y'all a slow clap for the trouble.
---
Instead of asking why not go try it yourself?
---
&gt;The long-term consequences of this development are highly uncertain but clearly hold the potential for widespread destruction and tragedy across New Eden's civilization.

C'mon CCP! Time to pull the trigger, we need some seriously fucked up cataclysm of galatic proportions to get things *at least* back on track!

---
My numbers make perfect sense, given the limited information I had to work with.
---
Oh, this is also WAY cheaper than buying PLEX and converting that into injectors if you're above 50m SP.
---
thats very toxic comment bro   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
A lot em die too. Just because other people are terrible wimps doesn't mean there's a problem with the game.
---
Fucking stupid. Especially since they cheated so many people out of millions of skill points ending their goddamn 16 day contest a day early without warning. Might unsub.
---
Init are really strong tho, Init would do just fine without the rest of the Imperium. Maybe you cant compete 1-to-1 supercaps vs panfam, but you can vs just about anybody else
---
No, it's all accounts not new ones.    It worked on my 4 year old toon.
---
The important question here: did you already reported this possible exploit to CCP?
---
Flew with these guys for a year a while ago when they lived in a C4. Great Corp and fun group of folk. Glad to see you made the move into the upper class!
---
-Ovyx
---
What do you think I'm doing right now?
---
It doesn't matter if there's no viable competition. It's like measuring the USA's GDP against North Korea.
---
Abyssal mods WOULD have killed EVE if they went live as originally proposed.  It took a massive outcry for CCP to even realize there was a problem.  Numbers were about double what they went live with, and the chance to get a max rolled item was the same as a min rolled item.
---
The right thing.

Currently inactive is an interesting way to say permabanned for python injection.
---
Well, guessing a number because there is no better information about something doesnt make it any more viable...
---
Except that we did. We undocked every day and fought. That it wasn't in the ships that you and yours deemed appropriate is meaningless.
---
Going with the flow seems like an appropriate description of joining the triglavs not fighting them

Every model is based on assumptions. If you have a better model with better assumptions then I would love to see it.

&gt; It’s very important to note here that this means all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.  Player driven economies are key to EVE design and we want you to decide the value of traded skillpoints while we make sure there is one single mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system – training.

Maybe if panfam didn't treat test and deadco like a punching bag for gud fites they would still be blue to panfam makes you wonder what the game would be like right now if they were.
---
Pick your ammo based on the range and size of your target. 
---
If uranium charges change your range to apply more dps at a specific target and the lost dps during reload (if you need to switch ammo mid fight) is acceptable, do it.
---
Always use faction or t2 ammo too.
---
They get a gym badge on teamspeak
---
I think most people figured this out yesterday, but in case some didn't this will surely motivate way more people to do it and so (hopefuly) trigger some kind of not retarded action (like putting that starter pack for sale) from CCP.
---
Well done Jin!
---
P.S. If you don't feel like waiting just create a bunch of referal accounts, buy the pack with all of them and THEN start jumping your character around.
---
P.P.S. I didn't do it, I don't really need more SP to do what I enjoy doing, and I prefer waiting for the skills I have left to train normally than giving CCP any more money or grinding for the isk.
---
Not quite - You can only buy one starter pack per ACCOUNT, not characters, so it's 1.75m for £4.24 &amp; 1000 PLEX with a 350 PLEX refund if you sub that account. You can chain this an infinite amount of times.
---
If it works like the other packs you can buy it exactly once per account, so I would't be to afraid of p2w.
---
You get a similar bonus if you use a referral link
---
Tackle dies frequently. Not exploding is down to a combination of tackler skill, opponent lack of skill, and luck.  This doesn't really matter as when things go partially to plan and you trade your cheap ship for an expensive kill and everyone regards you as a hero. 
---
If you hold off tackling until you are in inties you will simply lose a lot of inties while learning. Don't do this, get the piloting skills in a T1 hull that is 10% of the cost of T2 but gives 70% of the performance!
---
Start off with the T1 tackle frigates, buy a load of them or even better find a corp that will give you a pile of them and teach you how to use them. 
---
A good tackle pilot in a T1 hull is worth more than a bad tackle pilot, (like me), in a T2 hull.
---
I would've said Phoenix, but I can see what you mean.
---
Unironically, I've used their service twice and both times had exactly the kind of hole I wanted within a day or two.  One time it was a specific J code, another type, just an empty hole of a certain class with particular statics.  Saved me hours/days of scanning.

Running over 300 will take a VL / L wh with the 3 b mass from halfmass to close with no warning. Usually not the best idea without a group that knows those signature names by heart.

Transfer character use Plex should cost you 3-7 days.
---
There's not a single reason why it would ever become "china v west", at least not for a very very long time; the power difference between any stablished nullblock (Goons, Legacy and the rest of PanFam) and the separate groups of chinese players (Frat and Army of Mango mainly) is so big that conflict wouldn't even make sense.
---
Besides that, alliances change all the time, and even if NC. and PL disband a lot of their players will just join other group or create a new one. Balance of power switches all the time aswell.
---
And finally (because I got bored, there are more reasons) the "west v china" could only happen if people start fueling xenophobia and all that bullshit, EVE has always been (and I hope it will always be) an international community; we shoot eachother for different reasons, some betters than others, but never based on our nationalities.

Tbh I never really looked into what happened with goon after the war. I'd like to know more though
---
Yeah, unfortunately you might be right, I don't want to be permabanned from this subreddit over that

---
I will go with option A) for 8000 Spodumain
---
One of these days they'll optimize that pos game instead of adding more stash tabs to sell.
---
why would you need to roll holes in highsec?
---
At the risk of sounding insensitive, it's the whole point of the term 'spectrum' to abstract away the details of a complex condition into a way that's easy for the layman to understand?  A person who is low on the specturm is affected by thier autism, but not in a severe way, and a person on the high end is affected in a severe way.  Obviously there is a ton of nuance to that, like any condition, but I assumed the point of the term is to give an easy abstraction, not to actually understand the nuances and details of autism....
---
Rorqs are more fine now than they used to be. Taking years to fix them is what got us here.
---
I once tried to take a wormhole but the bloody thing didn't want to move from the fixed space it occupied, FC what do?
---
Yah, and joined fraternity.
---
About 50 real people uninstalled from the 3 OG corps.
---
Anyone who isn't paranoid about paying someone for a wormhole system to live in won't last long in j-space.
---
nobody cares about line members tho? allances grow and fall on content creators and leadership
---
idk if you're trolling or just unaware but two poins:  
---
1. you can easily solo roll any c1 hole with a higgs rigged gnosis, you just need to know how 
---
2. c1s have k-space connections not hisec connections exclusively so you might want to roll your hunting grounds if you are in a c1/ns e.g.
---
3. even if you have a hisec statics there are other holes you might want to close
---
4. even if you have a hisec static you might want a better hisec for logistics reasons 
---
I hope i didnt fall for some stupid trolling, but there's me trying to make the game better one "wormholer" at a time
---
Anyone who doesn't want to do the other, 29 jump route from jita to amarr
---
so TISHU were good guys?
---
iBeast/Lussy already displayed this issue in the highest DPS possible for that case, fully injected Leshak char with that booster, its carnage ...
---
As PLEX have a real money value it's 55$ for everybody.
---
The time you need to get the isk for the Plex isn't for free...
---
I used to do all my logisitics myself, I have a freigther and a JF, as well as a few DSTs and Blockade Runners.  I must say, lots of T2 ships are neat, but T2 haulers are so much more capable than T1 haulers it's insane.
---
But I digress.  Recently I wanted to move a huge amount of accumulated junk about 20 jumps to Jita to make some ISK.  My goal was to profit, and I didn't want to spend money to make money.
---
But when I looked up the price that these services actually charge, I would rather spin some VNIs \^H\^H\^H\^H Ishtars to make up the cost and leave haulitng to the folks who do it for a space-living.  I realized this is a game, it ought to be fun, and I'm going to farm out more and mroe of this kind of thing moving forward.
---
I sometimes need to refocus mysellf on spending time doing things I enjoy, and being intentional about not doing things I hate in a game I play for fun.
---
just my 2 cents, if freeing your assets from the clutches of your foes sounds like fun to you, well rock on with your bad self.  But if this soudns awful to you, farm it out, and go do the parts of the game you find fun!
---
Good luck homie
---
I was talking about my perception of the community in general, there are always sad exceptions to the rule.
---
Farming karma?
---
Your comment about an “entire alliance” quitting heavily relies on members of they alliance quitting to be a valid point, so your comment cares more about line members than you do.
---
no it doesnt it relies on whoever is in charge clicking the disband button
---
before the chinese arrived there was xenophobia against the russians
---
I like using a rolling hic, turn off the mass entanglers during the animation and put a lot of mass on a frigate hole or a medium hole that your hic would otherwise be too bit for.
---
There are still a lot of people who don't give a single fuck about 3-4 bil ISK, so there is that
---
For sure, I'm not advocating that you do it, just noting that it *can* be done.
---
Git gud?
---
Yeah but now they've got spod so who's the winner really
---
lmao TIL burning 2 whole regions and every enemy structure within when the enemy is one of the oldest most developed group in the game is insignificant
---
do yall snort the koolaid now?
---
Well. B is more doable now than ever. By the time that Goons react, Delve would be a ruin. :P
---
The only reason because Goons is able to full deploy North, is because they are sure that TAPI won't take advantage from it. That is why NCPL did shoot on his own foot when screw things with TAPI.
---
I mean, its not really even an exploit.  Its just using their shit P2W cash grab to benefit using obvious mechanics.
---
wingspan lives in highsec ...
---
But thank you anyway, haven't lived in a c1 since before higs where introduced so was also unaware that you could roll them easily now.
---
u guys should play dota underlords next
---
Even if you pay for the transfer between accounts, above 80m SP its still more cost effective to pay the transfer fee and starter pack fee.
---
Not in the bank account, but they had to invest time to earn that isk. This time has a value that must be considered in the value calculation.

I'm still waiting for the time people realise what kind of grindy, unpolished peace of garbage this game is. August 27 + 2 weeks for nostalgia to wear off, my best guess.

Nah they were 'fine' as a POS boosting ship. They're not fine as mineral printers.
---
Step 7: Get evicted for content ;)
---
Awesome thanks. I haven’t trained any Race frigate to level 5 yet so can still make the change or maybe aim for both.
---
To be honest, I left this game month ago, coz I programmed my factory to the point when only thing I needed and had to do, was to grab nuclear missile to clear aliens, and set up new small mining outpost... And rest factory taken care for and on me. Could be better fun with other people tho.
---
I imagine that bigger lazy bastards create factory that can do even mining outposts and clearing aliens too.
---
Haha cool - I expect I’m going to be dying a lot.
---
It's on reddit, so it must be true
---
At a time I was in the same place, then discovered gameplay overhaul mods/modpacks (Angels, Bobs, Pyanodon, Seablock) - not going back to vanilla, modded complexity is where the game shines most.
---
Awesome, I’m going to buy as many slashers as I can for now )
---
Obviously, nobody is referring to the pre2016 rorquals because like 5 people used them.
---
It's still more efficient though - The 4b of PLEX only converts into 0.6m of SP on a 80m SP+ character, or 1.2m SP on a 50m SP+ character, making this more efficient due to a lack of Injector penalties.
---
oh I just noticed there was a wangspin in here - alright, sorry, i just wooshed like a retard. 
---
however, as with any other holes, the mass is checked when you exit the hole, so if the ship fits you can start your prop mod after you entered. For an oversized prop gnosis with a higgs rig this makes its mass 20mcold/120mhot so you can roll a c1 hole in 2 hot/hot passes (and hope it's a low mass roll), or 4 cold/hot passes (for holes which spawn with an average mass) since the c1s can afford a max of 20m and have a 500m mass limit.
---
How would you roll a frig hole without a HIC?
---
&gt;put in the work to actually build up your alliances
---
Actual cringe, I hope they disband and leave you retards suicidal

trying another games is first step towards "out of the box" . some of them are shit, some are awesome

Has anybody ever tried a Large Shield Ancillary Punisher in Faction Warfare? Fitting is very tight:
---
    [Punisher,Punisher Large Shield Ancillary]
---
    Vigor Compact Micro Auxiliary Power Core
---
    Co-Processor II
---
    Fourier Compact Tracking Enhancer
---
    
---
    Initiated Compact Warp Disruptor
---
    Large Ancillary Shield Booster
---
    Gatling Pulse Laser II
---
    Small Ancillary Current Router II
---
    Small Ancillary Current Router I
---
My guess on how this would be used is to fight other brawlers, avoiding any kiters. Then you let your hp go into hull, make them think that you're going down (hopefully by then, you're at least in their armor), then activate your Large Shield Ancillary before they realize that you're healing 134 EHP/s. By then, they hopefully didn't have the time to go out of your 20k disruptor range.
---
In the given fit, I put a tracking enhancer in the last low-slot because nothing else will really fit in the remaining 8 powergrid and 12 CPU. You could also switch the Gatling Pulser Laser II and the tracking enhancer for the 200mm AutoCannon II + Co-Processor II, or 150mm Light AutoCannon II this fit:  
---
    [Empty Low Slot]
---
    150mm Light AutoCannon II
---
    Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
---
Which gives you roughly the same DPS and range as the pulse beam fit, along with closing the EM hole and bringing the rep power to 153 EHP/s. Low Slot is empty because I'm not sure what to do with 6 powergrid + 6 CPU. Maybe a Small Armor Repairer would help with tricking the opponent in thinking that you are armor fit, when you are actually shield fit.
---
Nice, thanks for the tips, prly I ll hang around for a bit again, to try something of this. I think devs didnt count with such enormous autism that we can bring to the vanilla version.

Um... no. When a ship leaves warp, it is not at zero velocity - when it lands it's coasting at about half their maximum velocity.

Warp anywhere, and look at your speed - you don't land at 0 m/s, ever.

Exceptional moon mining. 200mil+/hour easily per char in a low skill barge. Other than that clone/mordu hunting and DEDs. Sometimes missions too but those get boring very fast.

Exploit (noun)
---
1. a bold or daring feat
---
2. a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes such as installing malware.

Either the ability to apply *starter* packs to old characters is not a flaw in the system, or it's **literally** an exploit.

Shit man, let's keep the worst kept secret in eve.

I was in a very similar situation to your own, and people here already gave you the best way out of it... Just contract a currier service to solve your problems o/
---
Go to that station via either a pod or a  shutle, repack everything and set up the contract!

I would recommend redfrogs services for a moment like that, they did it for in 2 days.

There was a guy who used to use Python injection to steal supers by loading the pos forcefield into his characters head as an implant.

They only go 3k cold and have poor tracking. Learn to use warpables, combat probes, the ridiculous speed/tank of Jaguars, and you too could be a competent fc.
---
cause its the only time that nickname was used. and it was part of the 3rd reich war/propaganda/intimitation machine
---
Depends what you're fighting too tho, if you're part of a gang or looking to dupe around.
---
If you're anticipating to get shot at, or prepare a bigger engagement I'd really suggest going for Malediction since its Speedtank and Defense is way superior compared to a Stiletto.
---
Interceptor deal no damage to begin with so duelling other Pirate Faction or Assault Frigates, T3Destroyer isn't the best Idea to begin with while sitting in one. If you're dropping on a Carrier you most definitly want the additional Tank tbh. - Fightersquads are nasty.
---
It’s mostly because of the war
---
5.33+2.6+1.18=9.1k ehp is how much damage you can theoretically take with all charges used (5.33k) and two additional cycles on capacitor (1.18k) overheated (always overheat your ancillary boosters/reps), for the first fit.
---
9.1k ehp is not too impressive by punisher standards and you have sacrificed a prop mod for it.

like if you are not flying this fit what are you even doing tbh

It took osrs a couple months. WoW has more content, so many longer. Compounded by the fact a lot of the casual classic players will only log in during content dead spots in retail. Probably about a year before player base really falls off is my guess
---
If you time it right you will also receive a limited 50% off one month omega offer that will give 350 plex (+ buddy program rewards, so generally speaking 500 plex) to your main account for the price of one month of subscription at 3-6 month subscription rate. Often you won’t even get a mail about the offer but it will appear about one week after new account creation for a week.

To be fair he just said they want the roles, not that they want to actually do the work.

what matters is that we are all happy with our progress and successes, accomplishments, and the fact that the enemy's only real defense has been a literal vote brigaded "*didn't want that space / structures / assets anyway*"

+i think it needs at least medium smart bomb to use it as defanging tool. Ofc, fitting issue is even worse then
---
:)

Btw did u google this reddit thread? This one was ages ago lel

And... I'll be nice here and repeat myself... That argument is flawed! *woo*.
---
It is a QoL change for the buyer sure, but that's not the point. We could literally add a button for players that removes isk from their wallets and puts sp into their characters, and it would be the biggest QoL improvement possible, but the amount of harm it does **to the game economy** depends entirely on implementation (AKA, who sells the SP here).
---
The problem here is not how hard it is to buy SP with real money, that's irrelevant, because people will always find a way. The problem is how that SP is bought - when a person buys isk for money, and then SP for isk, they *have to* go through the in-game market. They're buying SP from other people. There is no SP artificially funneled into the game this way, simply transferred. This is also the issue with isk funnels like ratting, but that's a discussion for another day.
---
When you buy SP for money directly, that SP does not come from another player. It's not actually *legit* SP. It's just spawned in by CCP themselves, it appears out of nowhere. That's not healthy for a functional, player driven market. That can't be allowed to proliferate.

You may be able to apply 2 to an account if you were to create the account through Steam. I know I applied 2 Galaxy, 2 Star, and 2 Meteor packs to my main account. You buy the regular version of the pack, and then you can also buy the Steam Store version as well.
---
I wanted to avoid using blue/Purple/Red mods and stick to T1/T2 because well, flying a Punisher that's so expensive that it's probably cheaper to buy PLEX to dual-box another Punisher is probably not a good idea. Or even just sticking to blue mods and flying a 300mil Punisher. At that point, it's probably better to put those mods in a pirate frig.

What do you think "pay 2 win" means, exactly?
---
Part 1 (reddit character limits suck), coming from the perspective of a Wormholer.
---
&gt; Archon CPU increased by 15
---
Revelation CPU increased by 15
---
Wyvern/Aeon Fighter Bay default increased to 110,000 m3
---
Bosonic Field Generator Signature Radius increased to 4000m
---
ALL SYCTHE DD Beam Radius increased to 4000m
---
ALL Lance DD Beam Radius increased to 4000 m
---
I don't fly supers (WHer BTW) so Titan changes don't affect me, Thanatos is generally considered better when it comes to bonuses vs Archon so more CPU won't help it.
---
&gt; Javelin Ammo Range penalty changed from 75% to 65%
---
Fine? Ideally you shouldn't let ships get that close to you in a rails ship...
---
&gt; All BOMB (Concussion etc.) Explosion Radius changed to 350m from 400m
---
Fine? Bombs in general seem fine at the moment but more application is nice.
---
&gt; Combat Scanner Probe increased to 22 base sensor strength (+2)
---
Only if Core probes get a +4 buff, otherwise just use Combats for everything in WHs (T3s don't lose fitting for combat scanner probes).
---
&gt; Remote Sensor dampener effectiveness increased by 5%c
---
On one hand this makes the Keres even more annoying, on the other hand it could help stop the Leshak menace, I'm 50/50
---
&gt; Sensor Warfare Resistance on Titans changed from 80% to 75%
---
I don't fly Titans, no comment.
---
&gt; Scorch tracking multiplier changed from 0.75 to 0.65
---
I mostly agree, but this hurts some ships quite a bit (in particular the Navy Omen which is a great kitey platform that suffers from Scorch tracking issues). Energy weapons in general already have a bit of a hard time with the stupid cap usage...
---
&gt; Optimal increased on Capital Hybrid Blasters by 10%
---
Supercarrier Support Fighter Squadron Limit decreased to 1
---
Supercarrier Light Fighter Squadron Limit increased to 4
---
I don't fly Supers, Moros range is only part of why it's not a great dread in WHs.
---
&gt; Increased Velocity of XL Torpedo’s by 15%
---
Range boost would be nice, but an application buff is more important IMHO
---
&gt; Beserker SW-900 Web Velocity increased to 25%
---
Fine? The drones themselves are so slow and take up so much bandwidth they still won't be used...
---
&gt; &gt; Rapid Light Missile Launchers no longer counter as light weapons for Wolf Rayets
---
No, just no, whilst WH'ers like to meme about 1000dps C5 WR Cerbs, they make an important tradeoff with the shit tank, you could *maybe* reduce the WR bonus by 30-50% on RLML but removing it entirely is not a great idea. For reference, there's only 2 ships that fly a good armour tank and get RLML bonuses, Lokis, which get the worst possible bonuses (application via missile speed, instead of size, and fire rate) and the Legion which does get good bonuses, but isn't often used with RLMLs...
---
&gt; Auguror Navy issue, +1 Mid-slot, -1 High-Slot
---
Never flown it, no idea.
---
&gt; Caracal Navy issue, +1 Mid-slot, -1 Low-slot
---
Doesn't fix the garbage fitting, nor does it help give the ship a defining role.
---
&gt; Griffin Navy issue, +1 Launcher Hardpoint
---
Doesn't fix any of the issues with the ship, it should either get old-style ECM where if they jam someone (with the shit range) then the person being jammed can't lock them or a 4%/level bonus to shield resists to encourage the use has a tackle ship that gets under a T3BC/BS's guns and jams them so they can't lock anything else.
---
&gt; Base access difficult on Salvagers increased by 1%
---
Don't salvage, no comment.
---
&gt; Eris, +30 Cpu, +5 PG, +30 M/s Speed
---
Heretic, +10 Cpu, +50 Armor Hp
---
They need a legitimate reason to use them over sabres, you could maybe make an argument for the Heretic in WRs, but that's a super niche usecase.
---
&gt; Absolution base speed increased to 170m/s
---
Fine, it doesn't get the bonus to Skirmish links so you can't make it as kitey as a Sleipnir.
---
&gt; Nighthawk receives +15 CPU, +10 Powergrid. +1 Mid Slot -1 Low Slot
---
Please +2 mids so you can fit a good tank on it, a Damnation gets *way* better tank.
---
&gt; Eos, Heavy Drone Speed &amp; Tracking Bonus increased to 10% per level
---
Fine.
---
&gt; Drave Navy Issue, +30 Grid, +10 Cpu
---
DNIs are already fine, they can take on heavy armour fleets and do pretty well, no reason to buff them without reason.
---
&gt; Harbinger Navy Issue, Base Capacitor increased to 4200.0 GJ, PG increased by 30.
---
Fine? I don't fly Navy Harbingers so I couldn't say.
---
&gt; Deimos, +10 Cpu, + 50 Powergrid
---
Deimos fitting is pretty fine, not sure why you need even more fitting space..
---
&gt; Tengu, +30 Powergrid, +5 Cpu
---
Not sure it's the buff the Tengu needs (it's already a strong ship in it's own niche but whatever...
---
&gt; Proteus, +50 Powergrid
---
Not the buff it needs, a nice boost, but it won't do much to make it not-dumpster tier vs a Legion/Tengu/Loki.
---
&gt; Exequoror Navy Issue, Base Armor increased by 550.
---
Never flown it, can't say (though that is a *big* buff)
---
&gt; Vigilant, Falloff Bonus changed to Optimal Range bonus.
---
Pleaseno, Rail Vigilant is already a *very* strong ship, moving the range bonus to optimal will allow for 700 DPS monsters that can shoot to stupid ranges.
---
&gt; Ashimmu, Drain Bonus changed from 15% to 20% per level.
---
Ehh, drain bonus on the Ashimmu is already fine, it makes a good alternative to the Curse with better webs and NOS but no TD bonus and worse neuts.
---
&gt; Osprey, Base PG increased by 30.
---
Fine
---
&gt; Corax, +4 PG, +12 Cpu
---
Fixes nothing, either change to application bonus to a RoF bonus or to a shield resist bonus.
---
&gt; Dragoon, +5 PG, +100 Base Armor Hp
---
Still lacks a defining niche...
---
&gt; Damavik +3 Powergrid, +5 Cpu
---
Decent ship held back by range more than anything else, fitting is already ok...
---
&gt; Flycatcher, 5% explosion radius bonus changed to 4% resist bonus.
---
&gt; Shuttle Warp Speed increased to 6.00 AU/s
---
&gt; Muninn Base speed decreased by 15 m/s
---
Ehh, fine? Mostly a NS doctrine, don't see it all that much...
---
&gt; Vulture 10% medium Hybrid Turret range bonus changed to 10% Shield Hitpoint bonus
---
I'd honestly prefer that bonus on the Nighthawk but whatever.
---
&gt; Blackbird received +200 shield Hitpoints
---
Agreed
---
&gt; Logistic Drones base speed increased by 30% (ALL Size and types)
---
Agreed, but it won't fix much.
---
&gt; Redeemer receives + 430 Powergrid, +25 Cpu, -10% Mass, +10% agility, +10% Armor Hp
---
Sin receives + 180 Powergrid, +10 Cpu, -10% Mass, +10% agility. +5% Shield and Armor HP
---
Panther receives + 400 Powergrid, +20 Cpu, -10% Mass, +10% agility. +5% Shield and Armor HP
---
Widow receives +290 Powergrid. +10 Cpu, -10% Mass, +10% agility. +10% Shield Hp
---
Agreed, but it doesn't fix any of the inherent issues with Blops BS's - namely that you can drop a bunch of carriers and supers on them and they just die...
---
&gt; Harbinger receives +300 Armor hitpoints, +1 Radar Strength, +20 Cpu
---
&gt; Ninazu, + 10 Cpu, +10k Powergrid
---
Agree, mostly because it allows you to run triple compact RR + triage + penta cap booster (dual capital compact, triple heavy) and double compact local rep without a fitting mod or implant.
---
&gt; Lif, +40 Cpu, + 5k Powergrid
---
Apostle, + 25 Cpu
---
Minokawa, + 10 Cpu, + 5k Powergrid
---
Don't have the experience to say.
---
&gt; Hyena, +50 Shield Hitpoints, + 5 Cpu
---
Keres, + 50 Armor Hitpoint, +3 Powergrid
---
Sentinel, + 50 Armor Hitpoints, +5 Cpu
---
Kitsune, +100 Shield Hitpoints, +5 Powergrid,
---
&gt; Purifier, +5 Cpu
---
Sure
---
&gt; Apocalypse Navy Issue. +25 Cpu, +1000 Armor HP,
---
Doesn't really make it viable in any new ways, still better to bring a Leshak + Bhaalgorn than a NavPoc, only time I've seen it suggested as a viable option was as a part-joke when discussing running Golden Fleet as a fun fleet and even then Abaddons are cheaper and not much worse.
---
&gt; Raven Navy Issue. +25 Cpu, +1000 Shield HP
---
Doesn't fix the inherent issue that a Rattle is better with RHML and Torps need a fitting reduction. Could maybe help with Cruises but Rattle + Sentries is still better.
---
&gt; Monitor, +10 Signature Radius, -30 Max targeting range.
---
Fine-ish? It takes a pilot from the field so it's already a costly tradeoff, AFAIK no one runs them in WHs.
---
&gt; Pilgrim Nuet drain Bonus increased by 5% per level. (to 15%)
---
Sure.
---
&gt; All T1 Freighters +25% flat HP buff.
---
All T2 Freighters +25% flat HP buff. +25 Cpu, +1 PG
---
Bowhead, + 900,000 m3 Ship Maintenance bay. + 80% Hp. +20% Agility, Ship Warp speed increased to 1.50 Au/s
---
Either HP buff **OR** CPU buff, not both.
---
&gt; Rapid Light Missile Launcher ROF reduced by 5%. Reload time decreased by 5%.
---
Would this also affect RHML? regardless, not a fan, RLML is in an ok spot nowadays, it's still strong at killing rigates but you don't have enough in a clip to kill Cruisers up unless they are very lightly tanked...
---
&gt; Heavy Assault Missile Velocity increased by 15%. Base damage up by 5%
---
Do you want 40km range 1.1k DPS DNIs? Because that makes them incredibly scary.
---
&gt; Heavy Missile Velocity increased by 10%. Base damage up by 5%
---
Slightly better application would be a better buff than range IMHO, damage buff is nice though.
---
&gt; ALL EV- drones, Double Nuetralization amount
---
Bomb Aimer Rig +5% effectiveness
---
Never used either, no comment (though EV- Drones would still never be used when a proper armour fleet brings a Bhaal or 2 anyways).
---
&gt; Barage, Falloff increased to 50% from 40%
---
Hail, Tracking speed reduction to 25% from 30%
---
&gt; Eagle, base PG reduced by 15.
---
Not sure it'll change much, esp in WHs, but sure.
---
&gt; Noctis Tractor beam Range and Velocity bonus increased to 70%
---
Still won't fix much on the ship tbh
---
&gt; Miasmos ore hold capacity bonus changed to 15%
---
Badger, Ammo bay added, 20k Size.
---
Hoarder Ammo bay decreased to 20k.
---
Orca Ore hold capacity bonus increased to 10% per level.
---
All DST base fleet hangar size increased to 60k.
---
I don't fly Indies, no real comment.
---
&gt; Assault Damage active resist reduced to 70% from 75%
---
Indirect nerf to RamJag is nice, sure, I agree.
---
&gt; Torpedo Velocity increased by 10%. Torpedo Damage up by 5%, Torpedo signature radius penalty by 10%, Explosion Velocity on Torpedo’s increased by 10%
---
Needs a bigger range buff and a fitting buff, otherwise I agree.
---
&gt; Blockade runners Hangar Size increased by 2k m3 base
---
Part 2 incoming.
---
Why would people want to fight you (especially in Delve) when GSF relishes in dropping caps on people?
---
&gt;(Optional) Step 6 - Buy Omega on this new account to get 350 PLEX back on your previous account, subsidising the cost of the transfer.
---
This is where you get the PLEX back, not at Step 4, not sure what you’re implying here?
---
The moo pirate gang was ganking people long long before goons were a thing. http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=M0o_corp_(Player_corporation)
---
&gt;Always use faction or t2 ammo too.
---
For PvP. T1 ammo can be good for PvE if you don't absolutely need more DPS to clear the rats.
---
After 80m do you get 150k sp per injector.
---
The same stupid arguments that use NCPL now, when they shit on everyone and now are left alone being a punching bag for Delve miners. 
---
You said that TAPI make a mistake then. But how many mistakes has NC and PL so far, that even the people that hate Goons, support them and enjoy every KM of structures on the North? NCPL is not in the s*** because Goons. Is because their own actions and choices. Imagine that.
---
&gt; whatever narrative helps you sleep at night lmao
---
I'm a solo LS dude I couldn't care less about who is the current blob in NS
---
&gt; what matters is that we are all happy with our progress and successes, accomplishments, and the fact that the enemy's only real defense has been a literal vote brigaded "didn't want that space / structures / assets anyway"
---
Sure what ever makes you feel good mate. Just don't expect others to feel the same about you.
---
no thank you
---
Man, aside from Dodixie those were more dead than alive even in 2012 when I joined the game.
---
Granted, at least they were fully usable at the time, if slightly expensive and unable to support some bulk purchases.
---
no they haven't.  the first ten pages of their killboard has a handful of kills of cyno industrials in delve, thats it.
---
At step 4 I'm already losing the will to live.  Do people really do things like this to get an edge in Eve?
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
Well, delve is probably a bit different than deployment. But it also might just be name recognition, we skirmish with the same 10-12 groups throughout the week based on when / who we run into at the time. So since we haven’t dropped caps on them yet to ruin the content, they probably just assume we won’t.
---
The only good thing about these tedious null bear wars is that when an entity is deployed you can poach the retard ratters that stayed at home almost uncontested.  Please go to war more often null bears.

&gt; This SP, I believe, is  also FLAT SP (Not reduced due to current SP via Injector mechanics), so regardless of current SP you get 1 mill.

---
Wasn’t aware of that, TY.
---
I have maybe 2-3 hours a night to myself to enjoy this game. Most of my friends are the same way. So to do that, we roam in cheap, expendable ships, either have a great, adrenaline inducing fight, or whelp horribly, and then log off for the night (We live in thera, so we have access to wherever the fuck). I don't need to perpetually krab to afford the next shiny module on a capital ship that won't see any use outside of Tidi fuckfests, and I don't need to grind ISK to plex my accounts because I can afford two or three 15$ a month subscriptions (i buy in blocks of 6 months, so its slightly cheaper).
---
If I'm ever bored or nobody else is really online in my window of opportunity, I just jumpclone to NPC Delve and go kill some VNIs. The tears are worth it, and it entertains me for a little bit. Delve has no limits to VNIs and Myrms floating around.
---
Screw Wingspan.  Can't trust them to keep their word.  Especially if you're a small corp looking to seed a low class wormhole.    
---
You'll either get evicted or "charged a fee" to stay in the hole.  Tried to charge me a billion a month to stay in a C1.  Eventually had to move.    
---
There are way better options.
---
There are ways to close c1 holes
---
Lots skirmisher s and a t3

I don't understand the question, would you mind clarifying it?

https://zkillboard.com/character/94845226/

Check out this guys killboard for slasher fits. he’s the top tackle slasher pilot in the game in terms of slasher kills - so pretty much all of his slasher fits are done with tackling in mind. He’s also a very nice and helpful dude, so I’m sure if you shoot him a message in game with any questions he will respond, just tell him J sent you :)
---
Also you may have to remove one of the guns to get it to work with your fitting skills, but if you are flying the slasher primarily as tackle for a gang, the guns are not really necessary anyway.
---
Good luck!
---
i have heard of the mistake yes. Its hardly acessible however, and pretty much every member being able to easily to their own logistics is an enourmous plus. And no, not everyone has a jf and toon for it.
---
I wonder if you are being paid to pretend to be silly on reddit.
---
Unspoken have still been kicking arse now the supers went back to geminate. I heard they were pulled back as geminate was starting to smoulder.
---
suck my cock
---
Stop, you're ruining the narrative. We have too many blues, no content, nothing to see here. TAPI is shit, please move on.
---
Back then a mining ship had 15k ehp and a few light drones, it wasn't a cap with an invulnerbility module, cyno, and capital umbrella.
---
my comment is literally not about any of the things you're talking about
---
Part 2:
---
&gt; Improved Cloaking Device. Sensor recalibration reduced to 15sec
---
Agree
---
&gt; Vengeance, 5% capacitor recharge rate changed to 5% missile velocity bonus, +10 Cpu
---
Agree, makes no sense that a missile boat has that bonus, maybe give it a slight cap boost in return?
---
&gt; Wolf, +3 PG
---
&gt; Enyo, Drone capacity &amp; Bandwith increased to 10 m3, Base speed increased to 360m/s
---
Several groups are already using Enyos to great effect, not sure they really need a buff...
---
&gt; Rodiva, 5% reduced Capacitor need bonus increased to 10%
---
 agree
---
&gt; Thalia/Scalpel, 4% reduction in signature radius bonus increased to 6%
---
Never really see them used so sure.
---
&gt; Combat Ceptors Role Bonus now includes 50% bonus to warp scrambler range.
---
Disagree, this specific bonus was reserved for Mordu's ships, there are other potential options rather than giving them a bonus like this.
---
&gt; Caracal, +5 Cpu
---
Omen, +15 Cpu, +20 PG
---
Bellicose, +1 Mid, -1 Low
---
Agree, though I do't feel it really makes any of them excel in a role that they didn't do well in before (no role at all for Bellicose)
---
&gt; Rorqual, Shield Command burst effectiveness decreased to 2% from 3%.
---
Titans now have a 3% per level Command Burst bonus.
---
Sure? I don't fly Titans or Rorquals.
---
&gt; Faction titans no longer have a 5x Entosis penalty
---
Funny coming from 1 of only 2 alliances able to drop faction titans and be relatively sure they'll live.
---
&gt; Chimera Scarab Bonus changed to 10% effectiveness
---
Archon Cenobite Bonus changed to 10% effectiveness
---
Never seen either used, sure.
---
&gt; Scorpion Navy Issue, +800 Shield Hitpoints
---
nononononono, if you want to buff the SNI there's 3 options:
---
1: Give it a 1500 Shield HP bonus so it has slightly better base tank than a rattle and has an extra tank or utility mid
---
2: give it +30 sensor strength and change the missile bonus to 7.5%/level damage, it's not a big DPS boost (approx +0.25 launchers) but it makes RHML less shit.
---
3: Give it both so it's a better fleet missile boat in situations where drones won't work, but it's a worse option in close brawls where neither side wants to SB for fear of losing their own drones.
---
&gt; Tempest Fleet Issue, +400 Shield Hitpoints, +600 Armor Hitpoints.
---
It's still too similar to a Tempest whilst costing like 3x as much.
---
&gt; Megathron Navy issue, +500 Armor Hitpoints, +10 Cpu
---
I'd rather +300 armor. +2-300 Hull to make brick hull tanks more appealing 
---
&gt; Dominix Navy Issue, +700 Armor Hitpoints
---
See above but with +400/+400
---
&gt; Armageddon Navy Issue, +800 Armor Hitpoints, +500 GJ capacitor Size.
---
Still not worth over an Abaddon
---
&gt; Standup Bombs mineral requirements reduced by 30%, Size by 30%
---
No comment
---
&gt; Zarmzad, +25 Powergrid, +5 Cpu
---
They already seem pretty good in WH space and Saviours will be a hard buff, I'd wait off on a buff just yet.
---
&gt; Sotiyo pirate loot container changed to 100k m3 from 60k m3
---
So you stomp out a viable playstyle because you don't want to lose loot? Hard no.
---
&gt; Cynojammer damage cap doubled.
---
TBH I'd just say no cap - if you already have caps there to blap it then it's existence is irrelevant.
---
&gt; Autopilot changed to 10km off gate from 15km.
---
&gt; CONCORD Response time increased by 20%
---
As in it takes concord longer? Sure.
---
&gt; Standup Fighter Mineral Requirements and Size reduced by 40%
---
No comment.
---
&gt; Entosis window is extended by 1hour on each side at ADM 2. By 30min on each side at ADM 6
---
&gt; SP loss from T3C’s now capped at 50,000 Sp.
---
hard no, to train T3 skills to V or not is a good example of a tradeoff, reducing this feels cheap, either go no SP loss or leave as-is.
---
&gt; Entosis Cycle up time reduced by 25%
---
&gt; All Moons produce 3% more.
---
No because it's still a buff to Rorquals
---
&gt; Marauder Bastion Module now creates a 40km Mobile Cyno inhibitor effect.
---
No, either make it like 300km as a defensive buff or just give Bastion immunity to MJFGs.
---
So... you will literally blame players for playing the game according to its broken rules, rather than blaming the developer for putting the broken rules into the game?
---
If you run the highest-end PvE content you can get that amount in a few hours. It's not all that long.
---
Tried to find stuff about  the Drekavac here on reddit. Found this thread :D
---
I love active tanking ships. So your videos are really an inspiration to say the least.
---
Even though i havent played in 3 years, im gonna give it a shot. Isk doesnt matter anyways!
---
wolf rayets work on small weapon systems. 
---
meaning bombers (if using the usual torpedo fit) will not get damage buffed
---
So 5$ + 4 billion ISK for 1.75m sp. It also means that you can get 750k sp for 4billion ISK, still a better deal for people with 80m sp and over.
---
Why would he want to chew on a matchstick?
---
CCP banning people that make best use of CCP's flawed system... that'll go over fantastically with the playerbase.
---
what supers were ever in the spire friend
---
Sounds like anime
---
to start a fire in my heart
---
I assure you wingspan doesn't do evictions as a rule, we dont want Jspace to be empty and we also dont extort people to stay in wormholes, we hunt and move on some times we stay for extended deliveries if there are lots of customers
---
He's implying that CCP can't reading comprehension
---
okay first of all put the kool-aid down my guy
---
second of all, what supers are you even talking about
---
Sounds like you have a very hard life. Imagine not getting shouted at! Poor man, I expect you will go into rage withdrawal soon.
---
Cool shit. Yeah, Hecates are great, they can fight almost anything and almost anything can fight them.
---
Same
---
Or they pull the pack and keep the previous promises they made.
---
Spoke with your allies. Test has a zerg guild ;)
---
What if instead of owning a jump freighter you paid someone like 10 million isk to move a ship for you 
---
Wow so much harder than flying one ship at a time from jita to your static your right
---
Thing that ship sailed 200k sales ago
---
Yeah I love rocket jackdaws because nobody ever sees it coming.
---
PH had 200+ staged in R10 until 2 weeks ago. Skillu were moved to Malpais before disbanding. The dashboards I saw if skillu showed 200 titans and 300 supers in 1 move. PH easily had 50 titans and 100 supers. They even ran the incursion last week.
---
Unspoken impressed me at how they still killed stuff.
---
lol just thought id sarcasm it up this morning. Since the narrative from panfam is so askew from reality.
---
I've always wondered, why weren't you bammee when they kicked you off the csm?
---
I mean, we’re not blue to tapi. We’re friendly and help each other out every once in a while, but we still brawl from time to time.
---
Yeah, I get ya.
---
In the week I can play for 2hrs on Wednesday evening, Friday after work until I fall asleep, and fragmented bits of time on the weekend. I think it's the fact that I can't often dedicate an uninterrupted block of time to eve these days that is my issue.
---
I've dropped from 3 accounts to 1 in recent years, and I own 1 cap that's nothing more than a large container with a jump drive. 
---
People like you are my favourite. I really enjoy delve home defense fleets, without you there would be none of those.
---
For some reason I find defending things more fun. 
---
I have no idea what kind of point I'm trying to make....
---
1st: 
---
Great vid, I laughed
---
2nd:
---
I would never shit on miners, just on people argueing that its my fault 1 patch rendered my whole playing style of 10 years before into irrelevant and even punishing, and that it is my fault that I do not like to mine in a game turned "Weaponized FarmVille".
---
PGL has been afk a while we’re kinda going thru some withdraw
---
are they though
---
Just to be clear I upvoted because your comment is going to be buried and I want people to see it, not because I agree with you. P2W SP is insanely, insanely stupid. You guys lied to us (shocker). You don't even know how we are going to abuse it (we will) and you're still going forward with it. How the fuck do you imagine you can control this?
---
Ok, thanks
---
altho test did start the war. gigx said and im sure everybody knows this (we are not going to do anything to test, if there wanna fight there gonna have to start it) and 1 or 2 days after that test startet to toasting our space..
---
You are such an ignorant fuck and coming from me that really says something
---
Should be the same answer
---
Life is good in test, see I have these two titan killmails full of PL dreads to prove it
---
Damn it is bad isn’t it lol
---
Because I didn't commit a bannable offense. :simplesmile:
---
It’s nearly as accurate as the loss of a shoe = death.  
---
Literally reddit cannon at this point.

---
It s so dumb that nc and ph reset sometime. And after people are complaining about that goon kills the game.
---
Remember how init was at the end of summer 2017 after we lost all our sov against you (panfam+gotg) and how we are now 2 years after.
---
Panfam can rebuild stronger. Just dont be dump... but when i see what happen with BOS, i have some doubt.
---
Wow, you scored 4 supercapital and 1 rorqual kill over 3 months, half of them thanks to other people catching some retarded Goons in Delve, and decided to share this with /r/eve? 
---
Wow, life must be so thrilling there in Test.
---
Yea you know because Test is limited so much by who we can shoot.
---
If injectors didn't have diminishing returns then you wouldn't need to abuse it to start with. 
---
1m sp would be 6 or 7 injectors, for me. That's 6bn isk or so? Vs about 4 for a chat transfer... then throw in the extra 750k sp for recruit a friend etc.
---
If you stumble on it reinforced that would be a huge gtfo sign.
---
that doesnt mean you cant search for stuka or anything related to nazis in fact
---
Just because I want nudes doesn't mean I'm not serious.
---
That would make more sense of Test and CO2 hadn’t gone to war less than a year later
---
I can always start being angry again by default

Admittedly min/max but add both drugs (pyro IV/CereAccel) and rf-905/sh-605 implants and I give you the "Elder ScareDevil" @ 864 DPS heated

lussy pls last song name

Tackle is a lot of fun in a small gang. Other commenters have given good ship advice. Interceptors are awesome for the job and the slasher is a great training ship. The stiletto is easy to use with a relatively large shield buffer,  but the malediction can often hold the field longer with an aar and can bring a nos for when you move to scram range.
---
Ill try and help with your skill questions: Navigation is hugely important of course. Everything that makes you faster or more agile is important. Reducing your mwd cost is also important because the mwd power draw is the biggest cap drain on an interceptor. Warp drive operation can be left at 3 or 4. Train your capacitor skills to V. Propulsion jamming to at least IV because T2 tackle modules add range over meta. For stiletto shield skills are important. Specifically train for more shields and better regen. Won't be using shield boosters, and the resist ones only apply to passive shield mods which are rarely used. Armor is used for the malediction, or claw if you stay minmatar. Do train for booster and passive armor resists. Passive armor modules are very common. Plates are rarely used for light tackle because they hurt your speed and agility. Targeting skills are very important. Long range and signature analysis should go to V. Number of targets can be left lower but definitely pick up some ranks. Weapon skills are low priority. Dps isn't your job but it can be nice to have some drone-hurting guns when your fit allows.
---
Quick fitting lesson for an interceptor: essentials are 5mn mwd, disruptor, scram. After that you fit as much tank and speed as possible. Often you want a targeting range rig because your base range is very low. Dont use a T2 mwd. It's worse than meta and more expensive. 5mn quad lif is the preferred if your cap skills can manage it because of lower sig, but 5mn cold gas is easier for stability until then. Cap stability is not always important in eve, but an interceptor really wants to perma run MWD and disruptor at the same time. This gives you the ability to tackle things sometimes indefinitely.
---
Lastly I encourage you to check out Chessur's tackle guide: https://youtu.be/4yBTaqiMrX4
---
I recommend watching a lot of his videos tbh. The meta has changed a bit in terms of fits and ships for small gang, but the manual piloting and general strategies are still very relevant for small gang flying and his commentary is very helpful. You can see how many more kills they get because of a dude in an interceptor keeping himself alive and tackling stuff for the rest of the gang.
---
Hope that helps and feel free to pm me if you have more questions.
---
Not blaming. Just explaining.
---
Let me search the panfam and winterco killboards to see all the goon structures they have been killing so I know how much fun I've been missing.
---
FWIW linking a couple of NPSI group killmails doesn't really negate the fact that you and goons are allied strategically. Not to mention that those killmails are like 90% snuffed or PL and you're just riding coattails
---
Dam you had to edit your post and delete my reply in the process. PH had supers in R10 since before the tribute campaign and withdrew them to Geminate 2 weeks ago. Skillu were also in Malpais in a system that covered most of the spire without needing a mid.
---
Last night's fight was interesting. Marginal numbers advantage to Unspoken judging by the BR. 98:82 according to https://br.inyour.space/s=1542&amp;b=8668620&amp;e=90&amp;t=beab but the superior doctrine used by NC. Talking of batphoning both sides requested help. Tri was brought in by NC and others just CBA to help NC.

I'd like to know if the NPC ships are also piloted by capsuleers or not. So far I only see officer and maybe faction spawns as capsuleers. Regular NPCs appear to me like they have gone through some quick course about ship handling and being crammed into their ships.
---
Yea I linked every kill I have gotten :eyeroll:. Try not to choke on your own saliva there friend.
---
So is this actually cheaper then buying injectors past 80mil? If you consider buying plex to fund them.
---
Will goons allow anyone they don't like to build the keeps, sotyos, rorqs, umbrellas and the autistic krabbing necessary to step up the game?

oh no someone is giving us money we better stop them ...

I linked a sampling of killmails from a wide variety of alliances. There are many many more without XYZ on the mail. The point remains however that I have not been restricted in doing "ZePVP" against any group other than my own coalition. Which is quite contrary to the narrative that gets espoused by panfam.
---
&gt;pretty much every member being able to easily to their own logistics is an enourmous plus.
---
nobody takes ships one by one, they just use a dst, and yes its quicker to move your dst in than making a courier to an entry hole that ,ight npt be there the next day. Also im speaking pvp here, indy is another story
---
Well, that's the difference in perspective between us, and reason behind my argument that balancing individual hulls is secondary to the need of revamping certain areas of the game, FAXes being one of them. 
---
I do not think there are any specific changes to fitting or specific parameters of individual hulls that would change much - as long as you can drop 28 Minokawas against a subcap fleet (recent month experience), or have 500 Minokawas on grid in a "supercapital fight"...
---
I'm interested but I don't know if it's a scam/troll, like hardknocks selling wormholes.
---
Yeah, Vily doing disappointed Dad is not the same :(
---
I dunno, my corp loves wingspan.  We have an extensive list of contract fulfilment mails on boths sides going back years.  We even named a Fortizar after our favorite wingspan pilot so they get warm feels anytime they come through!
---
Exactly.
---
You chose to link those for some reason.
---
Me, too.
---
Apparently for this one when you buy from Steam you get a code that you have to put into the EVE website to activate, which can only be activated once.
---
Also be aware that every race has 2 Interceptors. One of which is interdiction nullified which means it won't be affected by bubbles. The other one isn't and currently more or less useless
---
(I know reddit: you may use it to great effect but until you know why you're flying the not-nullified version you should be sticking to the nullified ones.)

How to clear 5 wingspan dudes camping a B274?
---
Easy, warp a single combat ship to them and watch them scatter.
---
I keep this flair from olden days, not with snuff anymore
---
It's real alright. We have a system on Tripwire to add notes for the specific systems or types of systems that customers are looking for, and if one of our agents finds one they'll hold the hole and scan down new connections as they come up to get you in there. I'm pretty new to WiNGSPAN, but I've already helped someone find a specific C5 hole.
---
Not sure exactly what you wrote there, but the more SP you have the less you get out of injectors.
---
0-5mil - 500k  
---
5-50mil - 400k  
---
50-80mil - 300k  
---
80mil+ - 150k
---
That means the 1 mil SP makes a \*huge\* difference when you have a lot of SP already. It goes from being equal to 2 Large Injectors to being equal to 6 2/3 injectors. It goes from being 2bil worth to 6.66bil.
---
MC died in part because of BOS.  The whole character of MC changed when BOS was brought in.  And not for the better.  We changed from a fighting alliance to a carebear alliance.
---
Oh boi, now we'll hear how PL denied them Corp drama until 2022.
---
except that 750k SP is only available for new characters? as it's part of the referal reward?
---
Deliberately increasing CCP's workload is looked down on by CCP.
---
Cheers pal, not to expensive either
---
No the majority of them just joined the hyper botting FRT.

I already have over 10m unallocated that I dunno what to spend it on.

I don't need the extra sp, I only used 2 accelerators at Xmas and I brought this pack but I can't be arsed to fart about with char transfers to get more unallocated but if I did want it, abusing this  would be a no brainer given how absurdly good value for money it is.

Haha, totally.

But, the fastest way to get exploits fixed are to abuse them. The greater the magnitude of abuse The greater the urgency for it to be fixed.

Only thing I miss about being TR is no vanguard :(
---
Where does it say that Starter packs can only be bought by new chars - seems to add to basket on my existing account - and even asks me to input card details - that would suggest it will allow completion of transaction... what am I missing?
---
Disclaimer: I did never use wingspan
---
But as far as I can tell their locator service is legit. There are quite some folks who claim to have used them with a positive outcome.
---
Altough they might also seed their bombers there. No proof just sheer paranoia (though I never saw someone complain about that so they've got this going for them)
---
Tl;dr: use at your own discretion
---
So can we assume that this isn't going to be around long? I'm not gonna lie I'll buy my 3 and be happy but the whole idea feels wrong.
---
It's software development. Nonsensical errors are a dime a dozen and the fact of life. It's not about *what* they were messing with to cause this, it's about programming being an inherently alien practice even though we invented it. You test things, and you do your best not to do anything completely silly, but sometimes the program does something completely silly because of something else someone did five years ago and nobody realizes it because it only happens to people whose usernames start with 'Q' or something like that.
---
Also, EVE is 16 years old and was in development for several years before then. The older a program gets, the more little "gotcha"s it gets buried in it that work perfectly reasonably until one day someone somehow sets them off.
---
 [So you can drop structures in their space to get more kills?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498395657585819648/593433087820562459/1561555865773888890919408920656.jpg)
---
If we told you, we’d have to kill you. Wormholer btw
---
Im sad that I started to train into a Proteus now that is basically worthless
---
Very nice video, thank you for posting.
---
No doubt, I sadly didn't do the transport thing. I only bought the sp. I feel dirty enough. Like I said just be careful Dave
---
It is not the initial mineral requirement that created the problem but the exponentially grown mineral output of Rorquals and the deleted limit of production lines (1 CSAA = 1 Build at a time while Sotiyos are pretty unlimited in that).
---
That first paragraph you said is literally the same exact situation as this pack.
---
1mil SP event = Buy 1 month sub, log in over that month, get 1mil SP while also getting 1 month of training. 1 month training + 1mil SP = $15
---
Starter pack = Buy 1 starter pack, get 1 mil SP. (You can also sub here.) 1 month training + 1mil SP = $20 *or* 1mil SP = $5
---
So if anything that event was a better deal than this starter pack is. Only real difference is that the event SP you could get using PLEX as opposed to RL money, so it was even easier to scale up for people with a ton of accounts because they didn't need to use RL money to do it.
---
I'm not denying anything, but lets get basic facts right first before we start screeching.
---
there got 2 be that one fucking guy man
---
Oh COSMOS... You had so much potential.
---
I see CCP is staying the fuck away as usual. CSM is onboard with this bullshit?
---
For the person who sent the referral to get any SP (now in the form of accelerators) the person they referred needs to spend money, I don't think they were referring to the starter SP for the referred account.
---
Well you had a holder toon always if not completely braindead, and in the Era of people running double-digit numbers of Rorqual-Accounts there is no excuse for having no holding toon except being braindead.
---
Where do you see these posts?
---
Hate to be a dick here, but they kinda brought that upon themselves with how this would actually work, no? I mean it makes perfect logical sense for this to work, just they didn't follow through with the thought chain.
---
Did CCP approach any of the CSM regarding this blatant P2W mechanic?

What is the delivery agent you named the Fortizar after? I think he would be tickled to bits to learn about this. :)
---
Nah he is right, everyone can have multiple Titans now if he adapts to Delve. The question is, can he use it in any meaningful and not stupid way outside of Havens if no FC is telling him what to do?
---
&gt;How is this any different in the grand theme of things than players subbing skill farm accounts? The end result is the same wrt. skillpoints.
---
At least for me, I'm not going to go through the hastle of setting up a skillpoint farming setup.  But I threw $5 at the game for a million SPs.  
---
In theory a skillpoint farming system is also a way to buy SPs with real money, but this is a convienent way to do the same thing, and for me that closed the sale.
---
Yikes

They fly expensive ships they are good with, they don't need to fly through all your sov to reach you and they can scan and find you quickly.

I have read some of your past posts, youre meowing too much, for someone who doesnt have a clue what happened and why, what is happening now and what will happen.
---
Also, I did not left ncdot to test, I left to my own alliance and then to the test. Granted, I held very complex position having the lowsec keepstars, doing rentals for nc and doin drf subcoallition. I'll tell my story once and it will be a good one. 
---
As for TEST, I can say I'm very happy, from the first day I joined I encountered only respect and good relaxed atmosphere, I can recruit whomever the fuck I choose to, nobody is ploting to stab me in the back, or to assimilate me, no acid morons around, and when I talk to leadership, they actually understand the arguments I'm presenting. 
---
I don't speak for the rest of the mentioned corporations, but its the essence, its same thing. So yes, it is economic, military and cultural victory.

It's just the nature of Spooky Space and the fact that this lovely fellows just pop out of a hole, fuck up someone's ship and then disapear back into their scary relams of no local and cloaky ships.

Gotta love those guys.

I'm betting this will be likely the most successful since skill injectors became a thing I personally think its funny how many people are like... "ccp is awful for offering this" literally as they swipe the credit card on the 4th alt account.

Fair play, gotta take advantage of that if you have it all so close. That sounds pretty damn good. Even more so when you can take the kids with you.
---
I haven't got kids myself, and thank God. I have no idea where I'd fit eve in if I did have kids. Most of my time is doing stuff in the gym. I've been doing Brazilian jiu jitsu for about 2.5 years now and it's honestly the best thing I have ever done. I haven't felt so good both physically and mentally since I started and it's so much goddamn fun. That's where I get my true PvP fix. It has been fun the last few weeks helping some of the guys get ready for their comps.
---
I miss having the extra omega accounts but I just can't justify the cost with how little I play, and given how I play these days I they aren't really mandatory.

Such a different picture to when I started a few years ago. Back when I didn't have to hold down a job, and I was 140lbs heavier, and I was able to lock myself away for up to 12 hours without interruption. But I sure as shit wouldn't go back to it, even if it meant I've had to put eve lower down in my priorities.

great ship bro, heavily underestimated

&gt; best option in the current meta 
---
and this exactly is why an inredible number of small and midscale groups are disbanding and the player count is dropping significantly over the past few years despite many new alt accounts and thousands of chinese players joined tranquility.
---
recruiting every beating heart and using the few hours most working people have left in the evening to crab like an autist instead of having fun is against everything ncpl stands for. I guess that most members would rather quit the game before they would do that.
---
the problem is the meta, not ncpl. And I am sure that you will realize that soon enough when there is nobody left than 2 superblobs.
---
While I appreciate that you're here and aware of this issue, I appreciate it more that you're also getting schooled by Jintaan on how this works.  Does CCP even play this game?

What good is it gonna do when we go at it in an arranged 1v1 with hulls of our choice. It's not gonna prove anything because it is the very definition of anectdotal evidence.  
---
On top of that matchups involving blaster hecates rarely are decided by the actual fight, and more so by the setup of the fight (that is true for all blaster fits, not only hecates). That makes an arranged fight even more pointless.
---
You completely failed to understand my point, i don't care about being right or wrong. I care about you making a substantiated argument that follows basic principals of logic. Which you have failed to do.
---
Low class WH space corps are usually new folks. Groups just starting out. Lower skill point characters that are looking for room to grow without null or low influence.
---
The C5 corps though are always old bittervet hardcore PvP guys with very high skill point characters that are well coordinated and very knowledgeable, and very good at finding catching and killing almost anything.
---
And believe it or not there are some characters in C5 and up that are clear best of the best pvpers amongst Upper class WH space.
---
These guys are scary good and extremely dangerous.
---
init has one of the best subcap fcs the imperium has left in pando, thats about it. Init linemembers are just as braindead as goon linemembers, the big difference is that the goon pap chaser doesn't pretend otherwise(unless they use the space violence flair that is, those are...special)

huh my super is still in r1o, guess the hundreds of horde supercaps missed the memo vOv
---
Using the plex you get from the pack to pay for more packs or transfers is now allowed?
---
Don't expect anything to change. CCP finance has "Pulp Fictioned'" "CCP game design" to meet PA'a quarterly sales goals...
---
this is it. why should they care about a grumpy bittervet that plexes his accounts out of his 400b when they can have a newbie spending 500 bucks to inject a rorqual
---
Don't you know? Init is a strong independent alliance entitled to content whenever they feel like it.

they might get pointed as well, in which case that doesn't work anymore. however, when jf'ing in highsec, rule #2 is: never without an emergency cyno (rule #3 being: an untethered emergency cyno counts as "dead")

also, sometimes ppl mess up - like: "why is my cyno alt sitting in a shuttle?" or "why isn't the cyno in the correct fleet" or "where did my liquid ozone go?"
---
Debes Sparre (myself) and Sharlandra.
---
You don't use the plex to pay for the new account, you use the plex to transfer your character to the new account, to redeem the unallocated sp.  
---
CCPappears to be turning a blind eye because they get to 'redeem' plex in game off their books, as well as obtain rl currency you use to omega your account (if you subsidize your transfer fees with the referral bonus)
---
Or maybe this is intended by CCP, it could be the following series of events:
---
Accountant says there is too much plex outstanding in game and it is making accounting things sad.
---
Action items to reduce plex in-game without adding anything that can be bought with them are given to management. A seemingly impossible task.
---
Realizing that the players are clever and the only thing other than gametime and skill injectors or clothes that people redeem plex on is the character transfer system, they figure out a way to increase character transfers to meet the new directives from management
---
They decide that adding an item that is super good and can be used once per account will lead to lots of character transfers by players hoarding plex.
---
SP is something older players will be willing to open their wallets for, so they add a 1M SP for a small fee per acccount to appear to also help new players catch up to old players and then expect players to figure it out themselves. 
---
Had they come right out and said they were offering this deal for plex, people would not be in a panic to do as many character transfers as humanly possible and deplete all the plex ingame as fast as possible.
---
its becomes a game where people are allowed to undock there faction supers/titans and play the game with no worries about zkillboards

---
I heard MC was still taking contracts. Oh wait.. nevermind.
---
If you got your nullsec impression from reddit/forums I am sure it would see like the place that dreams go to die. But as a horde linemember I have constant access to small fleet and solo PvP, I am supported by an awesome logistics setup (coms, forums, buyback programs, hauling services etc), when fleets form up (several times daily) they are led by some of the most motivated, motivating FCs in the game. While it is true that I will never be able to know everyone I fly with personally, there is a distinct culture and I do get to know a large number people really well (ppl in my tz that shares ingame interests with me). While I am asleep, at work or doing RL, my in-game interests are being looked after by other members.
---
People join and stay in the blocks because they are great. People get recommended to join the blocks for the same reason.
---
dumb titan blobber nooberdogs
---
Its not terrible for Facwar. Just because he has the DPS, doesn't mean he knows how to apply it. Having more active pilots is great. To be clear, I think the whole SP thing is a fiasco. But I will never complain about having more active PVP pilots actually undocking and pew-pewing.
---
it's still a good covert hunting ship
---
The leaders of any Corp/Alliance/Coalition have a responsibility to their pilots to provide them the best experience they possibly can within the confines of the game. In game health is a responsibility of the company that makes the game. Were what you were saying true the high sec care bear or WH dweller would be equally culpable for the fact the game meta feels pretty stale these days. If the Imperium wasnt at the top someone else would be and would do so without feeling bad about it.
---
I was under the impressions it's a fairly common setup
---
As a WH guy &lt;3 to the folks who undock and defend their space.  Obviously prefer when it's something engagable, but tbh I'd rather get dunked by a super than chasing bots and krabs that only dock up.  I want to explode people's ships, or die trying, but I don't play the game in an effort to ruin someone else's fun.   Safe Eve is boring eve, and glad to see some verification that some of the null guys do appreciate a little risk and excitement in their grind.
---
There has been quite the migration of good groups from C5 space to C2 in recent years. 
---
With C5 and C6 space becoming more and more dominated by krab holes, many wormhole corps decided that having a null static is better for content than being able to bring caps into your chain. So many of the old corps moved to C2s with C5 and NS statics, to get the best of both worlds.
---
I bought 2 packs last night on current characters no problem.

Yeah I wouldn't go off that considering CCP says a 3 story tall missile weighs 1kg.

---
Unchecked player activity strikes again. If only we were warned...
---
Floodgates of RMT skill injectors as people extract and move on from the game, maybe.
---
A follow up question, why are most null alliances so scared to follow a fleet into a wormhole? They have to know that their medium-sized cruiser fleet won't roll a 3b hole, right?
---
For some reason when I lived in w-space, whenever we poked nullsec groups they almost never jumped after us into the wormhole we came from, even when they had scanned it down.
---
I mean, sure, whenever we tried to get them to jump the hole it was a range control thing, just like you sometimes make the other fleet jump a gate to get a range advantage. But often enough the same fleets that would've chased us through a gate just sat 50km off the wormhole and didn't do anything.
---
While i like that you have a long christmas list. i have problems with quite a few of theese.
---
Sorry for longass response from an absolute nobody  
---
5/6. No. fuck off. DD's dont need buffs. titans are cancer enough. (yes im 100% bias against this stupid supercap bullshit)  
---
7. Jav ammo is fine. its situational and does great. the shitty range is the tradeoff.  
---
12. No. scorch is the one saving grace of the majority of lazor ships, its not broken or unbalanced and needs no fixing.  
---
13. does this mean HAW or anticap? while moros is the shittiest dread at the moment. it doesnt need range projection, its the dread version of glorious blaster brawler. Unless you want this for erebus's. in which case. fuck off. titans dont need buffs.  
---
17. all ewar drones need saving (and hornets, permanent fucking removal REEEEE) but im amused that you've picked zerkers out of all the ewar drones.  
---
19. no. the 2 utility highs makes the aug navy a truly unique and strong ship in its own way. removing a utility high for a mid to homogenise it is boring and has no purpose.  
---
20. lol. (seriously tho. caracal navy isnt broken or shit. its just totally overshadowed, and removing a ballistic control \*what the fuck else would be there\* for another shield extender or web is a bad call.  
---
21. while i personally like the non-ecm buff for the ex-cancer ship. it doesnt really do too much for the hull.  
---
28. im curious what these numbers are for. what do you expect/hope for this fitting bonus to do? honestly curious. drake navy is legitimately a good ship right now  
---
30. no. while i am curious what you think would be used with this extra fitting. deimos is already a really stronk monster and needs no buffs.  
---
31/32. nope. fuck that. nerf loki, dont buff prot/tengu.  
---
35. extra succ? ashimmu already neuts more than enough. other changes would be interesting but it is already an brutally effective nos/neut boat. a 25% bonus to SUCC is excessive.  
---
43. while i might like that option for perhaps the ferox. that range bonus makes for interesting fits over just a bigger ball of HP.  
---
51/52/53/54 No.  
---
55,56,57,58. again curious what your expecting/hoping this extra cpu/pwg to do. if the answer is "Fitting is tight" good. sacrifices get made. especially on theese stronk as fuck ewar boats.
---
59. making tackle onyx's even more tanky? while i can understand why you want this. i disagree. difference in playstyle rather than you being wrong.  
---
63. same as before. curious what you expect of the extra fitting. but then. no. fuck off. cyno arazu's are cancer enough.  
---
65. no. pilgrims neuting is fine. it pays for it with its covert cloak.  
---
70. i like this. but be careful. HAMs arnt as shit as everyone crows about.
---
74. quake is great, its currently situational. doesnt need a buff \*even a small optimal range one\*  
---
77. wot? why?
---
84. ok? i like the way this is going but this change is peanuts. good to see the right direction away from ADCU cancer tho.  
---
85. careful with torps. torps are legit good already. and any buff or nerfs to them also affects haw phoenix's.
---
89. mixed feelings. i like the cap bonus on the vengance (as wierdly silly as it is) as it allows cap stable dual prop fits without too much issue.
---
90. same as with previous ones. curious WHY
---
94. no. dont need ceptors scramming us from 15km with a t2 scram. we already get that enough with stilettos thank you!
---
96. again curious why.
---
98. to focus it more as a utility ship? by stripping more off its already anemic damage?
---
00/01/02/03 fuck supers and capitals.
---
113 lol?
---
114? double lol? as in FASTER? cause highsec aint safe enough boiiiiiiz
---
117. as much as i dislike t3c's. i agree.
---
120. while i like this somewhat. i have a somewhat similiar idea ive been thonking about, ive been humming and harring over posting it. but i dont see this saving marauders. at all.  
---
  
---
TLDR. im an opinionated asshole that doesnt think capitals needs buffs at all. is curious about some seemingly random choices. and am glad you atleast have such a list &lt;3
---
Well congratulations guys
---
I can completely understand that, but until CCP shifts the meta it's kinda pointless blaming the groups playing the meta if the rest aren't even going to try.
---
Not to sound like every other person here but groups like Raiden, White Noise, PL, NC etc all excelled years ago because of their Super and Titan supremacy.
---
Now another group has caught up and the tables are turned.
---
Personally i've been pushing hard for Titans in INIT. so that we can finally get out from under the shadow of the PL and NC Titan fleet after years of being forced to fight under it. As a result we have a growing Titan fleet. 
---
Hopefully some people in other groups will feel the same about Imperium and start to work towards contesting it.
---
The FC and player turnover in Eve can make a huge difference to groups. There is nothing to say the current FCs capable of destroying regions will be here in 6 months or a year. People who give up because it looks too hard might as well give up already.
---
There's "voicing valid criticism of a company" and then there's "being a child on the Internet." I'll let you determine where you fall.
---
If you're going to bring food to my door, I'm not going to turn you away!
---
I do tend to get strangely territorial when people start causing trouble in my neighbourhood. I just hope my mum doesn't send me to live with my aunt and uncle for getting in one little fight.
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us manny
---
Sure but there's also not much to gain doing it in FW space. Yea you may win a few fights you wouldn't have against faction frigs or what have you, but in general you're still going to get hard countered by certain things and it's hardly an impressive set of kills.
---
This is just a gambit.
---
PL/NC corps will slowly trickle into TEST/Legacy. Goons will then need to destroy TEST/ Legacy in order to finish PL extermination.
---
PL/NC gets the satisfaction of finally setting off hostilities between Legacy and goons.
---
I don't recall saying anything about mining ships? in fact I think since joining KF I've killed \*less\* mining ships than I did while roaming around with small gangs... so your point is? 
---
I'm talking about the difference between getting to go out on a fleet once a week (in a small alliance) vs every day (in KarmaFleet), that makes a big difference to my ability to stick with EVE
---
Maybe wingspan can find an uninhabited one but the risk of someone wanting to take it from you later is real.
---
What a poor. I have 134 gold magnates.
---
I didn't say you should use couriers to do your wh logistics. You made the claim that wh logistics were easier than lowsec logistics, which isn't true. It's pretty easy and quick to make a courier contract to your staging system, and most people just stock what they need and refill as needed. Couldn't be simpler, certainly easier than moving a dst through wardecs to your static.
---
Imagine being upset at a booster that's been in the game since 2011...
---
This.  Nullbears don't know much about anything but I can guarantee that 90% of toons in WH space are farming alts.  Just the other day Frat were camping our null with two supers and a 12-15 man mixed cruiser and battleship gang, but were too scared to jump into the three dudes that we had on our side, despite them having eyes on us the entire time knowing exactly what we had.
---
2300 DPS Hecate or bust.
---
Hi Band of Brothers.
---
the only thing you crush atm is you REALLIFE by wasting Hours of time in summer and shoot structures and be proud of. Meanwhile other are going to the beach have sex and or partys. When they arrive at home the go to bed or log in grad a ship and kill some stuff in delve or elsewhere.
---
​
---
The grand thing here is that NOBODY cares about how many Structures you KILL. And btw listig POCOS there is like counting lost drones when fighting ishtars to boost your own factor... embarresing!
---
Ghost training lasted for months after it was raised as a clear issue.  I wouldn't be so sure.
---
Here's what happens if you don't abuse mechanics, even if you don't like them.
---
The north.
---
They didn't wanna krab, or embrace mechanics that didn't interest them. Now we see the result of that.
---
If a mechanic is bad, but is essentially mandatory... then you can sit on that high ground as the enemy stomps up the hill or you can use it like every one else.
---
This is the problem with powerful and bad mechanics. If you don't use them hen you end up being victim to them. Nobody wants to be a victim.
---
They don’t know what you have on the other side of that hole and unless it’s a C5-NS or C6-NS wandering they cannot have capital superiority.
---
missing section on USTZ  rolling for content for EU to enjoy and also keywords to include for scanners to convince dps to login ( 3J to Jita, paladin tackled) and words to avoid (Lazerhawk, Aridia)

How to hunt noobs in J:
---
* find fresh C1-4
---
* scan down all pirate sites inside and set up shelf
---
* wait ten minutes
---
* tab out browse reddit for ten more
---
* tab in and out for twenty-thirty more minutes
---
* get sick of waiting, get your cov-op and clear it yourself
---
* find new WH and think it will go different
---
* get ganked  by someone who was more patient than you
---
^ Ok that made me laugh
---
mei long
---
Heavy tackle jaguars are also awesome in small gangs.
---
To survive and do well in a WH as a group you need competent players, good teamwork and people capable of punching above their weight. Unlike most targets they go for which generally do nothing more than pushing F1 with their face, but only after being shouted at 3 times and having it explained to them in memes.
---
On average player quality will be higher in WH space than in null.
---
In that sense your current opponents also undock and fight. They undock in other regions, not the one you are attacking,  and fight someone else, just not you. Sounds familiar?
---
C2-C5/NS holes are where a lot of high skill PVP groups stage out of (for example, The Tuskers), even your standard C4/C5 residents will often have a higher average skillpoint amount/general in game skill level than many Nulseccers (yes I know it’s not a universal rule).
---
5km or so away from it, it was weird, I can't find the imgur link anymore :(
---
Well, on that subject you are a much better specialist than me, so the floor is yours.
---
Honest answer, having lived in null before moving to J space, is because most K space residents are terrible at d scan, don't understand how to probe effectively, and don't know anything about mass limits, time left on a hole, etc.  Flip side, I once got a null group to jump into a C5 Wolf Rayet in a kitchen sink fleet.  Armed with RLML Cerbs, etc., we mopped the floor with them.  Have that happen once or twice, and you'd be hesitant to jump the hole as well.
---
What are its best uses? 
---
I fly all of the other T3Cs but have yet to use a Proteus for anything other than smartbombing.
---
Yeah.
---
FC for example...
---
Very true, they don't. Little low on DPS but especially for solo if you fit for range control you're gonna have a fun day. My problem with T3Ds in the wz is you really can't do plex warfare because solo cruisers pretty reliably haze the shit out of you.
---
Nice theory, but you are giving them way too much credit.
---
what's the "future" economic damage estimate? They won't be able to do anything in that region for at least a couple of weeks (indexes) and can't mine anything for at least a month (assuming max fracture)
---
&gt;The C5 corps though are always old bittervet hardcore PvP guys with very high skill point characters that are well coordinated and very knowledgeable, and very good at finding catching and killing almost anything.
---
I'm flattered, but not all of us are bittervets or hardcore.
---
Structure bashing is PvP for crabs, that's really what it comes down to lol
---
Your posts make me look like a fucking god. this is a really shit post
---
One factor might be that isk making is utterly boring in most of its forms, and kinda feels like work to fund the actual fun.
---
Issue is, when you want to do industry, you can just do that, industry.
---
When you want to PvP, you *also* have to do something on the side to finance it, and for some people any of these activities is terribly unappealing.
---
Knowing you, smoking something that isn't entirely a tobacco product.
---
It's great for newbros tbh, the current starting SP really isn't good enough to get people into a lot of eve's actual fun activities.
---
60 fit titans, ftfy
---
Most of them are shit though, let's face it.
---
Thank you!
---
Yup, and if you do it right they'll even relocate their staging to avoid your astra.
---
Verboten language. We must be careful not to commit any mind crimes.
---
They'll be back.  Well, most of them I'm sure.
---
Determine how to find ur own dick. 
---
I could not care less
---
Pretty good so far tbh :) I do spend a lot of time in delve atm but no complaints from the home ground of provi.
---
Mmmm,
---
Pretty sure corps that moved to a C2 were evicted or evicted themselves and moved to a C2 for perceived extra security from bad men.
---
Cap kills are at an all time high actually.
---
Best news in a long time, BOS had more players active in M-OEE8 on the E-O-Gate then in the hole war against Imps.
---
Yeah, most are. That’s where capsuleers brake. Try 1-3 shitty/hyped games and back off to comfy well known world
---
You comment just reinforce my opinion...good organization. They had goals to grow, they knew how, and with their organization they were able to commit themselfs to reach those goals... :D Lidership, organization, persistence....all the events u very well mentioned didnt happened by magic :D Thanks for your replys ! Diff opinions brings debate and its always constructive!
---
That sounds great! Does it support citadel markets?
---
Hecate stands a decent chance with their dps
---
If your in a C5 corp. You are well on your way.
---
What tool is that you are using to switch between your accounts?
---
Can anyone defend against that many titans?
---
Fighting null Bada though. 
---
Fun for sure
---
Not very hard though
---
lolwat, like someone cant help me skill into things? are you dumb?
---
rule 1.
---
Any group of players not bored out by mining and ratting could have done it ...
---
It'd make sense if they didn't reset and invade their biggest ally, CO2, while they were already fighting the DRF.
---
it was :D
---
if try is GotG already batphoning rest of eve for help when NC. is going to come north soonish?
---
yeh was fun :D always is
---
In c5 space? To actual cap combat, outside of eviction ops? Or are people just starting to get pushy again since there's no other use for c5 caps anymore?
---
Oh wow, you guys killed some Titans.  You guys are ELITE!!!!!  
---
Now, quit batphoning every time you expand your footing and you can talk about being a stronk independent alliance.
---
You're reaching.
---
Yeah they should make a super titan with super XL weapon that apply great on titan / super but very few under. A super DD that can kill a titan in 1 shut.
---
This could be great :D for the economy and for fun.
---
I will admit it has been quite a few months.  I'M SORRY HILMAR FOR NOT SUPPORTING YOUR GAMING HABIT!!
---
heheheeh xD sure my friend sure :D Thanks god we have all the elite indutrials to win eve! xD Im just going to get another rorqual alt to help keeping the titan supremacy! :D
---
Orly

Wow, "elite pvp", "caring about structures", dude, Mittani kool-aid is spilling out of your ears. Yes, if you can imagine (though when you come to think of it, no, you probably can't), there are people in this game that take enjoyment from fighting but when you roll in with an uncontestable blob - there is no fighting. Goons don't do "fighting". They do "glassing", "burning", "knife-twisting", but not "fighting". Not sure if you remember but "Elite PvP" in the GSF culture stems from the time of BoB, IT Alliance etc. It meant that they, the bad "elite peeveepeeers" would stomp on poor goons flying rifters, with their expensive ships, T2s, BSs, Capitals, Titans... This is the "elite pvp" that's burned deep into the Goon narrative. Elite PVP is evil! Do you know what happens now when an alpha newbie in a t1 fitted atron dares to venture into Delve? He'd get dropped by titans. Are you sure you're on the right side with that narrative? Fighting and enjoyable content is something that GSF are 100% opposed to. Blob or blueballs or else, even if you win, the enemy had fun so they may come back. Is this really the game you want? Because this is the game you've got right now.
---
We don't care about structures. We don't care about sov. Burn them all. Take it all. Hope you have the stamina to grind through Geminate, dronelands and the rest of the South that's not blue to you yet. I'm being 100% honest here. Do it. Make it happen. Let the goon be the winner of Eve 0.0. This is the only way this game can ever get better. To hit rock-fucking-bottom. Because CCP doesn't seem to give a fuck about the horrible shape the primary selling point of this game is in.
---
BoB was cancer. "Elite PvP" was bad. Now for a reality check - GSF is cancer and "Elite PVP" now.
---
i like ur krab dunking videos better than these PvE ones tbh
---
You never bought a Starter Pack for this account - I got me one too.
---
Awww, did I touch a nerve?  Please, show me how I am wrong.  INIT. has had to constantly reach out to GSF because they like to bite off more than they can chew.  They are the annoying little kid that likes to pick fights with folks because they know they have big brother that is the starting lineman for the football team that will protect them. That is, until one day the brother says I can't help little bro, and little bro gets his ass kicked.
---
Cant help the population of Panfam is composed of idiots ranging to around 85% of the population of Panfam.
---
Yes, both citadels and npc stations
---
You two should get a room and lots of hand lotion.
---
You never know.  AT could be back.. maybe... I only can have hope.
---
it doesn't increase DD damage does it?
---
I'm actually on a T-Break right now, and have been for the past few weeks. It's why I'm less chill.
---
Skill Urself disbanded sure. 80% of their player base and 100% of their bots went to Fraternity. Avalanche. admitted they went to Fraternity because they are being given free vni bots.
---
''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty'' ''your capacitor is empty''
---
No it doesnt, but guns were shooting fax. DDs were shooting titans. The more dead fax faster, the more dead titans. If the node hadn't crashed we would have wiped PL entire titan fleet on grid or at least killed significantly more before downtime.
---
Wow that's almost like a real victory. Almost.
---
Do you honestly believe CCP cares?
---
Yeah. Wormhole pvp is something I respect, the logistics just tend to burn me out and make the game not fun for me.
---
All the wormhole bros I've had the fun of playing with have been cool.
---
real answer:
---
it's unironically because the game is dying. Highsec has seen the largest player loss out of any area of space, and we can sit in uedama for 6 hours and only see 3 empty fully tanked freighters.
---
why would we bother for that type of gameplay? most of us stopped logging in.
---
"Special cases" being the one wingspan is most famous for? :D
---
Can I have the 5 Bil? Took less than a week https://zkillboard.com/kill/77487731/
---
&gt; What are its best uses? 
---
extract and inject into a loki....
---
When did people stop calling Test Alliance Please Ignore TEST and start calling them TAPI? Such a weird change..
---
&gt; Do they even know what real balance looks like?
---
no
---
i wish CCP would do the riot method of 'balance' by changing a ton of things to keep the meta in flux/adjusting, like regular 'balance' passes every 3 months.
---
Wait you all know how to evaluate your own ToS without a legal team to back you up? What can you all say about the aforementioned subject which would make the community halfway believe you guys wouldn't let this go on because you are making real money from it?
---
Contract fulfilled, credit goes to ... who would have thought ;-) ... Frederick Vonhole. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77487731/
---
It is easier and the renters level of players you recruited go for the parh of least resistance.
---
tard
---
talk shit get hit vOv
---
You'd be jealous if we did.
---
Since I actually do this:
---
With enough skill and practice it's actually not that hard to make fire.
---
Thanks :) I'll give it a spin. Been looking for a tool like this for some time now
---
I was in wingspan a while back. Basically the way I remember it working is that you had a list of things that people were looking for, and looked while going about your daily life. So me for example, I was a scanner mostly, and hunted relics and active holes. Any time I went into a hole, I'd do my regular scanning routine, but also look at the list to see if the hole matched what someone was looking for. If it did, I'd report it up, hang out, and eventually get paid.
---
So in other words, Wingspan doesn't go out and look for your hole specifically, they just add that to their normal routine, taking advantage of their numbers and activity levels to find it, and then the scanner gets paid. Everyone is happy.
---
&gt;like that but switch the last two :D
---
It's more like they're getting a slightly smaller water bottle because a guy came by and stole a bunch of the shop's water.
---
But that's not what I replied to you for...
---
&gt; they think they're entitled to a free game
---
If someone downloads a free-to-play game they'd expect to get all the limitations of a free account that a free-to-play game entails. Alphas are entitled to a free game because that was what was advertised; It's not as fancy as the subscription but it's still free. 
---
**You** might not think Alphas are as important to the game as Omegas, but CCP sees the value in attracting new players to the game. They value their involvement, their feedback, their advertising from word of mouth, and more. So if an Alpha wishes to express their concern over the game and how changes may affect them, they're more than entitled to voice said concerns. That's why Alphas can post on the forums/make tickets/log in, because they are players of this game too.
---
So again, welcome to EVE Online, the Free-to-Play Sandbox MMO.
---
They should have made plex simply reduce your month sub to like $5 maybe...  It's too fucking late now
---
ON POINT
---
Bro, don't even compare, I have 206 Guardian Vexors AND a Mittani corpse.
---
ye my corp just did a general inactive purge. One actually logged on for the first time all year to ask why he was kicked. Told him straight be active or let us know u cant be . General lesson is to  tell inactive idiots to fuck off, and stick to your guns. Dont  let people who have no first hand knowledge of the corp situation to     influence  it.
---
&gt;a Mittani corpse.
---
well shit now u definitely more rich than me
---
EvE was there before goons and will be there long after. Stop worrying about goons and play your game.
---
Because they can´t bring their 20 caps with them
---
You just mad they cleared an Angel Cartel site as it seems, hence all that Machariels ... ;-P
---
&gt; and reform under a new name with slightly different leadership
---
\*cough\*BoB\*cough\*
---
Better go make some isk first like a few billion you are the first guy to go pop
---
Fixed for you. ;)
---
Fixed just for you.
---
dude, the first time i got in a wh from null i was scare shitless of the lack of local, nevermind knowing things about mass limits, lifetime etc.   
---
Also, because of the nature of the j-space, people who live in are usually super-cautious and hard to catch, fly blingy stuff (since fleet sizes are small you need to bring the best) and, while not necessarily the best pvp-ers, they are usually half decent. So, if they're baiting you in their hole, your 15 t1 cruisers vs their 3 man gang, you would do your due diligence and find out they usually fly in fleets of 10, t2-t3 ships, and you won't believe anything your scout sees :)
---
Get in interceptors asap then get your self into a inderdictor no one tackles in a slasher
---
eh, group PvE activities arent my schtick. Incursion comms can be so annoying tbh
---
Skills are never wasted as the meta is always changing. It'll have its time. \*also did that too and hoping like mad\*
---
We've been able to do so much with only 4 or 5 reliable people at a time. You still need alts though, sucks. But more friends means more opportunities!
---
Freighter piloting works because it's relatively inattentive, even if you're using a webbing alt.  You're just relying on that webbing alt making you a little harder to catch so they go for the guy on autopilot.
---
If you're actually trying to guard against ganks, that requires paying attention.  And that's not going to happen for the 1M/jump most people use for courier contracts.
---
If they don't then I'll probably stop caring about EVE.
---
Are people seriously getting up in arms over this when you used to be able to do exactly the same before, except perhaps less quickly? It's Pay2Win4Convenience as EVE has always been. The slippery slope *was* when they added skill extractors. There are massive SP farms already and this is just a drop in the bucket.
---
then loose it ...    
---
to Snuffed Out...     
---
On a gate...
---
That's pretty cool, hopefully they will be able to find me a home
---
LOL
---
1. Yes they tackle on the gate
---
This
---
*We also do mining and industry. reeee*
---
I can also a add the same to you about the kool-aid you take from NC/ PL side. if and buts and propaganda.
---
Facts are facts, and the fact is your mentality needs a bit of shifting, as to not stagnate and die.
---
As for ''elite pvp'' the way you define it is not how i see it, i see your "elitism" as a more aggravated form of bitter vet where you cant find the joy of Eve. maybe i am wrong.
---
I dont see GSF as cancer but as the cure, that will force you to develop or die.
---
always cloaky of course, for WH hunt  :  
---
Brawl and heavy tank, as good as a deimos or even better depending on the pimp level. but all T3c can do it  
---
or gank style : some armor buffer and 1k blaster dps  
---
or a a weird one, heavy cloaky long tackle, 50km point is realy helpfull in small gank situation
---
Because most posters here are test goons frat horde. And if they leave a haven they aee confused and lost. Wh are more dead than drone lands.
---
First, because of the people.  
---
I honestly never felt as good as in Evictus. Corporations still matter, but you can just go in coms and go with whoever is roaming, mining, or even doing DED sites.   
---
I sometimes really like doing industry, and you can't get nowhere close to nullsec organisation and strenght concerning industry.
---
I like big cap fight, while these doesn't happen that much, I still have to be deployed at least once a month, most of the time spinning dread but meh, coms or fleet chat is always entertaining.  
---
Maybe one day i'll live the WH life, but i feel that i need less comitment to enjoy the game in nullsec. Lazy way, maybe, but it's the way i've enjoyed it the most since i'm playing EvE (2014.)
---
Sorry, if my english is a pain to read, i'm french native.
---
I've never considered them scary.
---
use the ewar sub
---
it's damage forms are not good, so use it's point range bonus and good tank to be very heavy tackle
---
Wormhole groups move to a C2/NS to die.
---
Goons and Legacy won't be friends forever. Not like Legacy doesn't have a habit of switching sides constantly. I see them getting cozy with their new friends Mango and making an attempt on GSF superiority.
---
&gt; ~~And if I say I'm a woman, it doesn't make me a woman.~~
---
And if you say its a subscription game doesn't make it a subscription game.
---
You **could** subscribe but again not required. CCP knew what was coming when they released Ascension. They spoke of how the meta would shift when they made more ships available Winter 2017. They're currently designing the game around free players now more than ever. They've updated the Agency window &amp; the NPE, are introducing the new starter packs (which i personally see as a problem as everyone else currently does, thank god), and made skillbooks easier to get.
---
And the fact they've put in more feedback tools for all players goes to show just how much they value all player's feedback including Alphas; It wont fall on deaf ears.
---

---
^^Lazily ^^copying ^^my ^^other ^^comment:
---
&gt; If someone downloads a free-to-play game they'd expect to get all the limitations of a free account that a free-to-play game entails. Alphas are entitled to a free game because that was what was advertised; It's not as fancy as the subscription but it's still free.
---
&gt; You might not think Alphas are as important to the game as Omegas, but CCP sees the value in attracting new players to the game. They value their involvement, their feedback, their advertising from word of mouth, and more. So if an Alpha wishes to express their concern over the game and how changes may affect them, they're more than entitled to voice said concerns. That's why Alphas can post on the forums/make tickets/log in, because they are players of this game too.
---
So just because your opinion of "we don't give much of a shit about trial accounts" resonates with the other denizens of /r/eve doesn't make it right or correct. The 'Us vs Them' mentality is really primitive.
---
Oh ~~COSMOS~~ Eve... You had so much potential.
---
the problem with this is that i buy my omega time with isk which means that plex is gonna skyrocket.
---
You can also buy two, without this shenanigans, using both Steam's DLC mechanic and CCP's own login.
---
Steam is selling it for $1.24 atm. So 6.24 for 2M SP
---
Looking at all the comments I must be the only one that plays eve
---
You may not care about line members, but without them, your precious"content creators" aren't shit.

Noone says that... man, you seriously are beyond stupid.

Learn to use the directional scanner and scout.

This retard doesnt know what core skills are lmao
---
Hi meow
---
Lots of the fleet doctrines for heavy armor brawling have caps in the meta right now, as well as fat crabs running sites.
---
Who's next?
---
Shame on you Mr moderator
---
You mean like that time TEST saved XIX's supercap fleet move op by jumping in with their own supercap and owning? Oh wait that didn't happen.
---
Who said anyone does that?
---
Just ask Brisc Rubal; he's a wormholer, btw.
---
hey guy what's good
---
why would we need to reform? honest question
---
Has anyone seen Bliss and Sort at the same place at the same time ?
---
Yeah ik its great
---
Inbreeding results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by deleterious or recessive traits. This can lead to decreased biological fitness and with it the ability to survive and reproduce. An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as inbred.
---
This isn’t how reddit works but I respect the effort
---
And you are whining. You had done what your opponents doing now. Stop whining and get on with things. You are not special and neither are your opponents,  no one is doing anything new.
---
Weve had orders filled the same day they are placed so I'd be willing to wager that we will be able to find one quite quickly for you
---
Thanks a lot Jin'taan. Just thanks.
---
Thank you. Glad to have someone in this thread who is so experienced in inbreeding.
---
Man, I am so friggin happy I started training my scanner and hauler when I did a year or so ago. I don't like multiboxing at the same time but having alts is so nice.
---
I just joined into wormholes about a month ago and idk how I'd do it without them.
---
I don't think alts are required in WHs if you join a large group, but if you're in a smaller group... it's gotta be done.
---
Well yeah because people aren't shooting each other.
---
First, BoB is a completely different story. Inform yourself outside of the goonswarm wiki and you will recognize that.
---
Second, the currently onesided meta of "empire building" isn't only affecting 0.0 like bob did back in the day, but also almost every other aspect of eve. High sec industry, low sec industry, mission running, incursions etc. are pointless these days since the possible income with rorqs and supers is so high. solo, small and midscale pvp are basically dead, lowsec is a shadow of its former self with snuffed beeing basically everything that is left. 
---
enjoy "winning the war" in the north or whatever mittens tells you to think about his campaign, I hope you still have fun in serenity 2.0 which is enevitably coming under the current gameplay mechanics
---
Sounds like a way to become injector extractor locked
---
Eve wise everything you?
---
I'm enjoying your posting.
---
[I already posted this over on the official forums, but thought I'd drop it in this thread too...](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ccp-is-at-it-again/169684/73)
---
Just wanted to drop in here now I have a clearer picture of the situation and can speak with some knowledge on what happened here.
---
We completely understand community concerns around the selling of Skill Points for cash, and we know how strongly you guys feel about this.
---
A few changes are going to be made to this pack soon in order to square things away.
---
Just to clarify things, we’ve sold starter skillpoint packs to rookies in the past via steam, and of course SP rewards are a thing through the recruiment program too. This isn’t something new, and we’re always looking for ways to increase the chances of a rookie pilot becoming a seasoned veteran that sticks with EVE for many years.
---
The objective of this pack was to give rookies a little bit more leeway with their initial training and to give them a leg up when it came to branching out into their first few new ships. While it’ll have that effect, it’s obviously been implemented in a way that’s causing community concern, so we’ll be making a couple of changes.
---
The first is that we’re currently looking at restricting the sale of this pack so that it’s available on account creation and lasts for 30 days.
---
Similarly, we’re also looking to restrict it so that it can only be used by accounts that are &lt;30 days old.
---
We’re aware that there’s been a super strong community reaction to this pack going on sale and it wasn’t our intention to cause the pitchforks to come out.
---
Hopefully we’ll have this resolved soon.
---
Even if it takes a few days ill be happy. Going to be my first attempt at living in a wormhole, probably get evicted after a few weeks :)
---
Yes it's almost has if people are complaning the best way to become the strongest entity in the game is the least fun and combat oriented way.
---
Then again maybe it won’t? Do you realize we are at the low point of player numbers, but added the Asians?
---
2 scram gang what up
---
Neat!
---
The trick Jintaan mentions is not limited to buying the starter pack. You can also exploit the trick using only in-game ISK.
---
Yeah but were the fighters deployed?
---
You said recruit like crazy...who exactly is there to recruit that isnt in a big bloc already or someplace they arent looking to leave? Your statement gives the appearance that if NC tried to recruit people they could bloat to 50k just like Goons. I don't think it would be that easy especially since new players apparently leave after like 2 weeks or something (based upon the Eve North slides)
---
Thanks for such a great reply, I’m going to replicate his fit for fleets but also want to try making some fits to try some Faction Warfare pvp as it sounds like a good place to learn the basics (by dying a lot basically :p) 
---
Just downloaded the Pyfa fitting tool and think I’m already in love with this game.
---
For those that don't hate steam, you can buy a starter pack there, then another starter pack on CCP, if your eve account is connected to steam, so 2m SP.
---
Seems to have had the desired effect. A dozen dudes in a hut worth less than my tengu scammed, tricked, and murdered at will until you retreated back to the krablands. I'm pretty satisfied.
---
Though I am a little confused  -- weren't you guys hired to stop stuff like this from happening? Is Elo going to offer noraus a discount?
---
Man that is such an awesome reply, I might need to read it a few times, and will watch that video. Thanks so much!!
---
awwwww

Why there is no Sansha T3 yet?

so like what PL is for NC

DIBS ON YOUR STUFF AND SUITS
---
Cool - my main goal is to be small gang tackler when I get in a corp, right now though I’m messing with slasher and rifter fits that I’m going to take to lowsec ) I know nothing of carriers and fightersquads ))
---
Thanks for the reply man!
---
1k blaster dps that you need to be so close to your enemy that you'll probably never actually apply it in a real fight. On paper DPS is not the same thing as applied DPS.
---
Your reductionism runs so deep that you can't even begin to grasp my point, can you? Also, I'm not whining -- I'm mocking NCdot for being bad at a video game. That's another thing y'all don't get -- your cult-like worship of gudfites blinds you to all other motivations for playing Eve.
---
I’ve been reading about this today and practicing trying to get ships I see in High space to 5degrees. It’s tricky haha.
---
yeah I was thinking that if it increased DD damage 20% the new meta would be injecting titan pilots + consuming cerebral for big fights.
---
I’m four days from Stiletto and then training Malediction I think. Just going to use slasher while I’m learning though, the group I’m hoping to join say they are very accepting of newbies.
---
Good luck brave newbie!
---
do that
---
Goons are killing the game by mining too much. 
---
Goons are killing then game by ratting too much.
---
Goons are killing the game by blobbing too much. 
---
Goons are killing the game by befriending too much.
---
It almost as if people are blaming goons for all of their internet spaceship frustrations.
---
Haha cool. I did a bad and bought that £4 starter pack, don’t judge me - I just want to get into the pvp side of the game asap )
---
who is complaining about goon krab ?
---
Test ?
---
Init ?
---
far better than you little goon pet
---
Are you ok?
---
You know what's even more imbalanced ? The lack of a LS-Stain gate !!!
---
That's outrageous !!
---
Even NPC noob corps can get [good fights](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004589/201906020000/) out of INIT. (Although usually only prompted by Rorq rescues rather than fights for just the fun of it and it’s quite easy to get overwhelmed by superior numbers.)
---
It already is, see my post down in this thread.

That is a complaint you can have I guess. I will rank it with my complaint that my middle toe's nail on the right foot grows faster than the one on the left.

Yes buddy, having a pretty nice day despite the weather, how are you feeling today?

If it's the least fun, why do they have the most players?
---
The 750k SP is made available at the account level. You can apply it to any character on that referred account, which includes your main if you transfer it over.
---
Well to farm anything efficiently solo, you need multiple alts. If you're using Dreads to farm C6, or FOF snipers, you will need at least 3-4 characters to make it work and get good loot. Kind of means that any group that stays and farms grow a farm of alts, even if they are primarly a PvP corp.

That hull alert made me jump and quickly alttab through all the screens.

It's a very explicit implication ok

Only cut your nails after the shower - the water softens them up.

Player count will keep going down. It's an old game. Plus I don't think goons want to intentionally kill the game. They are just getting revenge on the entities that evicted them.

holy hell, why is this even a post?

TIL

There we go. You sound more calm.

I was never agitated or anything, I can insult people perfectly fine without losing my calm.

Mittens is stuck in a bad spot. His crew took advantage of a situation ccp set up. I don’t blame them. I blame ccp for killing eve with injectors and excavators. Eve could have lasted another decade. Now I’m thinking end of this year
---
Awesome. Thank you for sharing.
---
Viewing this I immediately thought Kim Yong Un and Putin.
---
I honestly believe that Putin's motivation to take power in Russia was not personal gain. I think he saw the need for someone to step in and take the reign, and he did it. I don't think he grabbed the opportunity, I think he took the burden because he thought it was necessary. Got stinking rich in the process, but I really refuse to believe that this was his goal.
---
Awesome dude, I'm glad you had a good time. We had just as much fun putting it together for you (Apo, BTW) and hope you can make it to the next one. This is the reason I haven't biomassed my toons. People like you who make the effort to come to these things and share with the community. 
---
And you're right, shitposting here is one thing (I am one of the worst of the bad offenders) but everyone is +10 at the meets. I encourage everyone to come and have fun!

Happy I could help and glad that we can be friends

Would that be what is called creating a pet? You get another group loyal and dependent on PH?

Facemelting blaster boat and amazing brick hard tackle.

It only respawns at DT and 1 hour after it is initially killed. So anyone who isn't able to play at DT has zero chance of ever getting this.

I hope it was as fun watching us make complete fools of ourselves as it was doing it!

Well, unfortunately I’m never on anywhere near downtime, so even if I did trust you it wouldn’t be possible for us to fight

&gt; And ofcourse share a beer or 2 dozen

ftfy

You're literally retarded.  We've won the war...your castle is not even on fire anymore.  It's burnt rubble being blown by the wind.  Our castle still stands and is the mightiest example of in-game empire building that has ever existed.  Not to mention our Super and Titan fleet dwarfs yours by a factor of 4 I believe.  Don't even come in here acting like you've retained any sort of anything.  4.4 trillion in infrastructure losses.
---
My realism just tells you that your attempts at painting people who either don't do what you want them to do or doing exactly what your had done in the past - doesn't make them "bad at the game". As redicilous were goon-haters mocking CFC for running away from the overwhelming odds - as much ridicilous are your attemps to do the same now.
---
Nightmares ftw

I actually love this idea

Another good point that INIT will get good fights regardless of their coalitional standings. Thanks.

I think that it’s just this

Legalese tends to be very generous in terms of technology definitions. This is why in the US, for example, a "protected computer" as defined by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is literally any device with internet access. With that type of mindset, I would assume a "software tool" would basically be any type of software.
---
CO2 wants a word with you, so convenient i dont even need to change the example alliance.

I'd be ok with getting to watch sansha dreadbomb random unsuspecting Gilas
---
Ah this is becoming a good copy pasta
---
They're actually not great for armor brawls since they have no range, can't shoot if there are bhaals on the field, get barely more DPS than a Loki all while being totally out classed by a drek, which is cheaper, lower mass, higher (ramped) DPS with reasonable range all while being tankier
---
Alts + attracting players who want to krab in the most safe of places
---
My castle is fine, what are you talking about?  Yours wasn't after you were ran out of town though.
---
We whooped your asses.  I laugh that you are saying that you won that.  Typical goon mindset.
---
While the lion’s share is likely dev work, most eve lore consists of writing from developers, ISD members, and some other volunteers.
---
[This thread] seems to have a decent amount of discussion on the topic as well. Also, while it seems almost _too_ obvious, I believe there is a credits page somewhere (in game and out) that will credit those specifically tasked to the lore and writing.
---
Even better yet over use of ratting space causes npc groups to shift their focus and potentially cause incursions or something silly like that.
---
How would outstanding PLEX make accounting sad? They're cool with it getting destroyed, no reason that letting it sit in vaults would be a problem.
---
High sec ice belts are a hilarity all their own and if they fix anything in high sec next I hope it’s this.  Every single ice belt in high sec is “claimed” by a botting setup not unlike this.
---
right... thanks so if you have never bought you can get now  - n1
---
as much as people on r/eve do
---
The long hours of boredom combined with the patience of an autistic jesus.
---
There are several of these groups setup throughout highsec ice belts that do practically the same thing. I find it very suspicious that the same miners, haulers, and gankers are always online every time the belt respawns regardless of time.
---
You can find other groups running similar setups in these systems as well: Niballe, Avada, Manatirid, and Agal that I know of for sure. While I know ice mining isn't engaging their behavior of lack of response for hours from bumping or other trollish behavior makes me think they're bots as well.
---
We need to go deeper
---
Yeah, especially when you compare it to a loki that does 700 to 20km+
---
&gt; how we are now 2 years after
---
i don't know how you were before but surely it couldn't be worse than the current state of linemember fodder for goons/snuff and 2 good fcs
---
C4s don’t have pirate sites.
---
Gotcha, that makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to entertain my thought.
---
Enter the WH, shout in local, see if anybody answers. No answer? WH is empty.
---
Somethings end up in evictions but they never start as such.
---
&gt;Well. B is more doable now than ever. By the time that Goons react, Delve would be a ruin. :P
---
i dont think you understand the magnitude of structure bashing needed to do that, regardless of test spine
---
Who cares.. CCP Certainly over the last 13 years haven't... 
---
I do like what you are doing &amp; not sure if you find this exciting or not, but you are absolutely wasting your time if you think your actions will drive change or help the situation. 
---
Abyssal Botting is the new method and literally undetectable by players other than "that player does many abyss sites"...
---
Also these bots mostly have moved to outside low density regional HS space.. As this game slowly is losing players, the chance of players noticing the botting gets lower.. 
---
Well done for trying, but not worth the time IMO.
---
No I said build up, sure recruiting is part of that but theres more to it aswell.
---
Ok?
---
Ongoing and well documented botting issues, to be followed by:
---
**CCP:** We're looking into it
---
Years later, bots are still here. CCP doesn't want to get rid of botters. If they did the bots would have been gone long ago.
---
I'd always take that fight myself.
---
I've yolo'd a widow into a fleet to save a tackled Redeemer, when everyone else was too scared to go
---
I'd say they are a big part of the null problem. Throwing caps against caps is fun, throwning caps against supers is not.
---
He wants police Proteus
---
That's a good reason
---
I know you're memeing but hear me out on this, T3 Triglavian Cruiser
---
That's not true, saw him tame one in bdo, 1 sugar lump.
---
tell lee to get vdune back plskthx
---
Yeah that's what I'm afraid of haha. Although Occultist is still usable and such. I am curious just in general what next league's focus will be though since we just had "spell league" and "melee league". Can't really do the same type of thing next league so I'm hoping for "bug fix league"
---
Just get a few smart bombing battleships
---
Mystery solved -- you really are incapable of grasping a simple point.
---
Also, "something I disagree with" isn't propaganda. When you view any viewpoint other than your own as an insidious attempt to infect your brain, you're chugging some *serious* kool-aid.
---
Noticed it in Jerma as well.. Dozen of Orca's insta warp to ice belt as soon as it spawns, orbit with an ice mining drone.  The orca's outnumber any mining ships 5:1.
---
I've never used Trig guns and therefor I do not like them.
---
How? A cloaky Proteus can still have great tank and 1000dps
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but "scary wormhole people" originated from wormhole people. It is likely promoted by them as well.
---
They are more elite than anyone and far better at pvp. Nevermind the liberal use of cloaks let's them pick what fights to take. Much like people docking up.
---
They get to appear without warning. Except for when people watch local, scan down signatures, etc.
---
Their keepstars are unassailable. Except when know space people decide to destroy them.
---
It's cloaky damage is better than ever
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Your statement made no sense. You said you injected the skills for a VNI to run sites. How is anyone helping you "skill" in to anything? Do you mean you got advice from another player on what skills to inject? Try some fucking English classes you non-coherent fucking chode. 
---
Regardless, nobody believes you. You sound like a more experienced player trying to play the "Oh I'm a newbie and CCP just made a change that's going to hurt newbies" post just because you're salty that your Botting/AFK site running ship is getting nerfed.
---
I'm going to ignore the fact that if you were having a loss then you were not making any money but losing it.
---
I can see how if you are using it on a char thats already preped its good, like a cyno alt that only does cynos, you can pay for that account with plex and have a bit left over.
---
In my case i have a haulers and a sp farmer i paid with a CC for a year so i'll make good isk pulling it, but if i try to scale, then i will either barely break even or make very little profit.  
---
Anyway you all confirmed my math was right and the only way to make tons of isk is either really small (char is already paid so i don;t need plex) or really large (100 accounts making 300 or so millin isk a month profit)
---
So i have an idea of what i'll do, thanks for the input everyone =)
---
Killing ratters is still a real fight
---
do you have video of it?
---
posts like these are "this guy CHEATS, start witchhunt now!"
---
You know what, I cant argue with that logic, but try a Kikimora sometime and see if that's still your thoughts :)
---
You gotta show us the loot from that hour of stealing his ice :D
---
Ninjas need lots of hugs. The Tactical Hug has become an advanced form of art.
---
The fact that the Titan is a combat ship is really just dumb it should be a total fleet support ship that allows for dynamic fleet combat. Imagine if you could bridge in and then jump the Titan to a battle and do a total doctrine switch while on grid.
---
This is a nice write up, with sufficient details for other players to follow up on should they be interested in any target practice.  Bonus points for admitting the possibility that not every character you have seen in the area is a bot, even though you have strong suspicions.
---
Including the ship scan and the names of the relevant characters as well as their ships and SOP was a nice touch.  If I did much hunting in High-Sec space, I would go take a look, just to see if your information was on the up and up for myself.
---
Good work.  Please keep it up.  The ability to present information in an easily understood format is a highly desirable skill, which will be of use to you in any venture you undertake in the future, even if it doesn't result in swarms of pirates descending upon your foes in this particular instance.
---
There's a guide around here somewhere
---
So if you dont see the machs you can bump the frieghter and collect ice.
---
They go "BOO" in local
---
this is my first meme :p
---
1. They're rich. Wormholing is lucrative.
---
2. They fly blingy shit, because they're rich and because efficiently running wormhole sites requires better than a VNI.
---
3. They know how wormholes work, and you don't. That means they're hard to find, hard to catch, and often very good at surprising you in both K- and W-space.
---
the fact that youre being upvoted despite playing 2nd grade levels of reading comprehension is classic r/eve
---
oh cmon are you serious Innominate? this is like giving out "special ships that are the prize for the AT winner" and then giving 20 fiends to any subbed account 2 years later.
---
I can refit these to cloak and be undetectable while traveling to where i'm running the sites though. Someone would notice a domi or 2 moving gate to gate in 2019.
---
angel caps first      
---
then mordus caps    
---
then logi on killmail     
---
then some cap redesigns on pirate factions

Eve-O Preview [https://github.com/Phrynohyas/eve-o-preview](https://github.com/Phrynohyas/eve-o-preview)
---
&gt;To actual cap combat, outside of eviction ops? 
---
I mean, all of Eve is about finding a reason to make people fight. Most folks aren't going to risk billions of isk on "just for fun" fights, even if they say they will. Eviction ops are a great way to get wormholers to fight.
---
Oh ... You had so much potential.
---
Might as well stop caring now. CCP stopped caring a while ago.
---
If I recall plex = cash, so sitting plex = cash not cleared to spend. Or something like that.
---
Light fighters don't apply much better
---
Cool story bro
---
Osmon is popular as well and you see one of the code guys harass the bots there while streaming to INN on twitch, actual video documentation and CCP does nothing.
---
&gt; I have only been able to dunk supers from winterco hre panfam gotg and imperium. 
---
Manny, you must be mistaken with that last item on your list. /r/eve has told me Test are Imperium allies and are not allowed to shoot at each other.
---
Zzzzzz blue donut whaaa
---
Because they lost all the other players
---
Literally no one cares
---
I imagine after the 100th character transfer request this week, the poor person doing them will put up enough of a stink to fix.  
---
But then again...
---
They're fast, they're bloodthirsty, they can appear from nowhere at any time without warning, trash a system, and be gone before the response fleet can even log in (or, be there just long enough to trash the response fleet as well), and once they head home you can't follow them back easily because of wormhole mass restrictions and how fast holes can be rolled.
---
From the perspective of a smaller/lower class wormhole group, versus the larger/higher class groups, they also outnumber and outgun you heavily. What's a dozen battlecruisers going to do against 40 Lokis or Drekavacs (or *Barghests* because that's how big NOVAC's balls are).
---
No because you can’t sell PLEX for $55 (only buy it). PLEX therefore has no value unless you’re already spending real money on Eve which many bittervets do not.
---
i was thinking zero ISK faucets for a year or two might be interesting. there is plenty of ISK in the system already.
---
So much Amarr penis in one place!

random Front 242 reference? I can only upvote once? #feelsbadman

&gt;I'm still waiting for the time people realise what kind of grindy, unpolished peace of garbage this game is.
---
you got it mixed up, they are moving from eve to wow classic, not from wow classic to eve
---
No, you can't sell it. But you could go working in this time and earn money.

---
What kind of WH do you want? I just unachored a fort, and raits, azbel, athanors etc from a c2 that has a permanent Hs static and a c4 static. Only an astra is left but if you want it can just transfer it to you. No one in the WH anymore.
---
Apparently you forgot to look in space owned by Fraternity.
---
I do not have any video footage of it, no, sorry. However I have full confidence in that CCP will not ban anyone hastily.
---
they are titans my man so no fighters buy yeh there was fighters on grid at another citadel from the supers etc

---
More time-consuming though, IIRC transferring a character takes 24 hours ? But yeah, a million SP a day is still pretty pretty good.
---
... lol ccp.
---
We literally left because people were too busy krabbing to fight. Wtf earth do you live on lol
---
threads like these are just witch hunt threads, make a ticket instead
---
Why would they not be able to spend that cash? 
---
It isn't like they have a significant cost associated with plex usage.
---
response from CCP that totally misses the point and misunderstands their own rules? shocker
---
abuse of the recruit a friend system is bannable
---
lol your cute

I have seen the screenshot already :)

For a beginner it's exploration. If you have a couple of accounts it's high class wh ratting.

---
Granted, this wiktionary definition might not be the most fitting, my fault here. Still, what's being used here is the character transfer ability with the starter packs - individually they're relatively harmless, but putting these two together, or in fact the very ability to put these two together, is clearly a flaw in ccp's system. Therefore, an exploit.
---
Unless you believe ccp did this deliberately, in which case, well. Can't really argue either side, it's fucked up.
---
proteus is great for hunting stabbed procs and VNIs atleast.
---
It can do Lethal Strike, Reprisal, Dead Men tell no tales; Supply Interdiction is iffy, and Cost of Hubris is just downright suicidal (the boss tracks too well).
---
In the reprisal, if the spawn has a cruiser Orka, you have to cut MWD at once while keeping transversal and distance up, overload helps a lot.
---
This post needs a glossary of terms lol.  Half of the terms you use I have no idea what they mean.   It thank you, very informative.
---
depends what you have, what knowledge you have, and how much time you have
---
Spend 20 bucks, sell PLEX
---
Exploration is good, or salvaging in NS if you join a big corp.  Both require very low SP, can be doing them on day 1 basically and almost no isk investment.  They also can each make \~100m/hr.  If you join a big corp, I'd definitely say salvaging is easier while explo is more interesting (and can be done solo).
---
Clearly, he was the noob.
---
Do you prefer running L4s ? Besides, you can do that while watching Netflix on one screen and your rorq on the other.
---
Yeah, look at those tanking numbers for OSRS....

---
Overtime at the office. I've yet to find a better isk/hr activity
---
tell me how i'm riding coattails when i was blue scouting this titan :thinking:
---
mostly because we shout boo at people when they arent expecting it.  
---
Thats a fairly generalist statement, and it really depends on who you are. Some WH groups are known for being ruthlessly efficient, and if you see them it is probably because they're there to kill you, or on their way to kill one of your friends. Sometimes this can be scary, and there are plenty of groups out there that have reason to be concerned when a large Wh crew's fleet is in their space.   
---
That being said, there are plenty of bigger fish that probably arent scared at all, and plenty of wormhole crews that are just as likely to feed you shiny killmails as they are kill anything of yours. Such is the beauty of WH nature.
---
When you say it will appear... Where will it appear?
---
I expect it to be somewhere around the time when people realize they won't kill C'thun
---
I'll shamelessly link one of my own posts about another money-making mechanic that was completely broken and not patched in months: [How CCP made ~70€ per ghost training character](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6hkhc5/some_tinfoil_about_the_current_state_of_the_game/)
---
You're pretty comfortable fighting a crocodile on land, but would you jump into the water after it?
---
The guys in null are used to gate mechanics, to fighting in k-space, because they live there. They know where shit is, they know where to go, they know how to move around. They might or might not know how wormholes work, but there's one thing they know for sure - you know the w-space *better*.
---
Good job posting publicly. I'm sure CCP would not intervene... even if it made any sense at all.
---
Also, "Peitition to have your main character transferred as per [this post](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/help-regarding-character-transfer/95612/2) to the referall account"... Right, cuz CCP does that shit for free ALL the time. Unless you have some sort of RL issue like death threats or something on that level of seriousness they won't even reply to the petition except to say "What? Are you stupid?"
---
Move your account for $20 and you are paying more for all of this 'free' SP. LOL! 1,000 PLEX is worth 3.8 Million SP (1.9 Million being the monthly with +5 implants). 
---
Worst pyramid scheme ever...
---
Someone please dreadbomb or at least try something on that titan on the far left 😂
---
Join a large null block and around downtime just run around collecting the drones/fighters people left abandoned and resell them on the market.
---
Yeah I don't blame the imperium for exploiting to the limits the current meta, it's kind of their turn, CCP lets the game becomes like that, it starts to change with fax, super and rorqual nerfs but it's not enough.
---
There must be mechanics to encourage medium alliance like 1-3 thousand people and discourage too many huge ones.
---
One region should not be able to sustain ten thousand of people.
---
What null need is to be more dangerous, not a better high sec, mechanics like anom respawn, belt respawn, afk ratting/mining have to severly change.
---
Limited ressources and other new mechancis would force groups to move, currently you have deployment why because your home is always better for ratting, mining and have the best structures.
---
Personnally I was before my break in null on my way to having my titan but the game becomes day after day tastless, now I come back but in wh to discover another aspect of the game and maybe I will be back to null if there are significant changes.
---
One of my fear is a true blue donut and seeing the current eve map I'm really worried....
---
Hey, that's not fair - at least four of us are actively playing eve.
---
5/7 would scan it down again.
---
2 Domis less then those tengu, runs sites in 7 minutes and no skill loss when ganked.
---
At least most fits can pull away from a bait punisher and warp to safety before the elite pvpers land in the Plex!
---
We all had to start somewhere.  Here’s hoping your long journey is a success.
---
That's not true for the big C5 groups. When we can we happily field full cap heavy armor fleets just for fun against each other.
---
So steamnis offering the starter pack at even more of a discount  
---
Though apparently this only works if your account was created on steam originally. Mine was not. 
---
So hypothetically:
---
I create a new account through steam, can you still do it through steam but by using buddy referral link for the extra 750k sp? Or through steam you dont benefit from that?
---
Steam account gets 750k sp, i buy starter pack from steam, get another 1mil sp. Petition to transfer my main. Then buy offer from eve website, get another 1 mil sp. So does that mean i just got 2.75 mil sp that i can now apply to my newly transferred char?
---
Also if you buy account through steam do you always need to run it through steam? Coz i heard its shite and id rather not.
---
I’d easily fork over 1b for a proteus police skin.  CCPleeeaassse
---
Who is shoot first?
---
You definitely aren't wrong. I actually use that exact setup for C4's though, full PvP fit too. It can be super fun :).

Well he sure as hell didn't say it was 3k unique players.

yeah thats what i said :P

i like running them in bomber now and then but its more comfy in strat/tengu since i need to pay alot less attention 
---
Cost of hubris still sucks even in Stratios because sometimes the BS will land a wrecking hit for 2k+ and have me sit upright and VERY awake suddenly
---
Oh I thought you guys disbanded already
---
I've participated in WH fights that lasted hours. So it's not just about pissing off fast. J-Space pilots can persist as well as anyone on the battlefield.
---
ok
---
To annoy them. This is also 90% of why anyone does anything around here.
---
police skins are for RP scrubs and their preteen fc's xD

Ha isn't it like 40 degrees haha
---
You should find a way to make money doing what you like to do. Not looking for the best/the fastest/or whatever, but instead an activity that gets you a net positive on isk and that you enjoy. 
---
As a beginner, you really need to find your own pace and maybe a nice quiet area of highsec to call your space too. From there, make isk.
---
Poorly placed regret. AB/MW fit that thing, pair up with a Broadsword or Sabre, and become brutal.
---
I want to do geddon navies but there's like 3 on market
---
I have found a nice quiet area but it's Providence. I do relic sites only and am currently maxing out all my omega Exploration skills.
---
Interceptors are incredibly rewarding to fly, but as my mentor told me when I started that direction, "buy them by the dozen".  When you make a mistake there is no escape, luckily it's over quickly.
---
37 right now and the sun is setting

The Manny rage always confounds me. Manny is one of the nicest guys I’ve ever had the honor of playing with. He’s creative, thoughtful, organized, fun on comms, and just a generally decent guy. There are a lot of assholes, primadonnas, and toxic personalities out there, but Manny, who is absolutely none of those things, always gets the most rage.
---
PI in null sec is a nice stream of nickels for very little effort.  Making money through a variety of different activities is a good way to avoid boredom of the same old routine.
---
Fuck mining and industry mate. 
---
PL/NC kool-aid? Riiight... You're really dumb if you believe that. Stagnate? Die? The entirety of 0.0 is stagnating and dying. Just because people are farming the shit out of it and building more and more Titans and Keepstars doesn't mean 0.0 is thriving. There are 2 groups that mean anything in the entirety of 0.0. 6-7 years ago there were so many more. More diversity, more content, more FUN. 
---
You can define it whatever way you want, what I've told you is the origin of the term. This is the "enemy" created to unite the goons. It doesn't matter what you think it means. It means what it means, it's just that goons using it at this moment seems a bit hypocritical.
---
Well, I pick death. I won't be forced into grinding isk, grinding sov, grinding structures and TiDi shitfests. This is not something I consider remotely fun, yet this is what Eve 0.0 has become and mainly thanks to GSF.
---
&gt; maybe this time you can do a fight that isn't 1k+ vs 100? 
---
I just love the way that your alliance is throwing such a tantie over the loss of your supercap brolly, and you're literally quitting rather than learning to do without it. It's just an amazing feeling having ones prejudices so thoroughly justified.
---
Probably true but you know what i'm getting at.
---
Honestly I'd just ask if you aren't sure but want to know what something means. You'll have someone answer you :)
---
Shit, we didn't practice... FUCK IT, WE'LL DO IT LIVE
---
I hope not. I just started playing not too long ago
---
 :(
---
Kill an INIT rorqual I dare you!
---
Grab a slippery Pete (cloaky sniping tengu) and start popping his cans. Spam dscan for combat probes and you'll basically be untouchable.
---
&gt;Legacy is on a similar path of the imperium but is an ally.
---
I think we all can guess what will happen next  ....
---
They have a 10(?) second immunity to being locked after warp exit though, plenty enough time to coast down to a speed near enough to 0 that they're within the instawarp window.
---
Mmmm hot sweaty fat nerd
---
&gt;They're actually not great for armor brawls
---
They were before everyone got a hardon for the trig ships
---
My favorite Eve quote, from before we moved from null into wormholes:
---
&gt;That's the thing about wormholes; it's basically a clown car of things you don't want to fight.
---
amarr lp is cheap as fuck now, create some buyorders and you'll get em
---
Two words for you: Capitol Logistics.
---
Lame.

They still wouldn't have cap superiority they could hardly get any caps in before collapsing hole
---
nm lose to arty machs btw btw btw.
---
LOL Nice

When someone creates a new account he will eventually get a promotional offer to go omega for half the usual monthly subscription costs. The offer appears about a week after account creation. Even if you don’t get a mail from ccp about it will be there when you log into your account management page to subscribe. This gives you one month omega for 7.5 eur/dollars. The offer lasts seven days. If you used the buddy invite it will give your main the buddy reward (350 plex but as I’m saying above it’s actually more like 500 plex because of how buddy program works with additional rewards as you repeat the process). It’s an easy way to actually sub your main(s) for a good price while creating usable omega alts or to just get plex from money for a better price than ccp’s bundles. Now you can mix it with the above trick to get multiple starter packs. Of course in the end you still need to give real money to ccp to sub even though it’s not much.

---
Doesn't really matter under current game mechanics anyone who actually wants to do that (individual line member) would have already joined goons/tapi. The other groups consist of people who will not do that because its not fun, they play the game for fun not empire building and when fun requires a year of building a titan/pilot those players will not do that they will simply leave.
---
The structure neuts me
---
And you are delusional.
---
It's quite cool here in the UK at the moment but it's coming dude and then I will be one of the ranks
---
And then put up a keepstar
---
The WH corp I was with, built a weapon with remote rep / energy rep logi that was so unbreakable, nobody would fight us. We had to actually move out of that system to another to get people to want to engage us (can't blame them, really. Under that shield, I could field a Wolf into T-3/Dread/Carrier combat, and get nary a scratch).
---
how many people do you need?
---
Yeah. It’s healthy now, but only after it was brought back from the brink of death by jagex stepping up and providing new content for the game. Before that point it was like, super dead
---
I am inclined to agree with you in this! Let the shit hit the fan at warp speed!!!
---
I was in a WH corp, and we were routinely fielding 2, 3 carriers for rage-rolling ops, then we'd bring everything and the kitchen sink if we found a fight.
---
That's a really great write up! CCP won't move a finger, that's for sure, but maybe this will caught someone's attention... Retrievers are far more accesible targets than the multiple-Orcas set up you usually find in HS (which CODE. refuses to engage for whatever reason those losers have).
---
That being said, you might wanna check cheap ganking setups to make his life a little harder and devote some time to blap his retrievers (weakest link in the chain).
---
If these are the numbers they presented at EVE North they excluded alts from the count and removed bots from it as they found them.
---
Or just people that like a good looking ship
---
Nice production shame the audio is so shit.
---
You’re in government, can’t you expense scandal a better headset or something?
---
heh, I’m gonna start with slashers )
---
Awesome, I’ll search YouTube, thanks my dude.
---
They viciously taunt people with horrendously bad Dad jokes and onion breath.
---
I don't know if 3,000 a day is a good or bad number for new players signing up per day. Given that sounds like 10% of our daily player base it sounds like a lot.
---
looks at flair  
---
(x) preteen fc
---
(x) Rp scrub
---
yeap, checks out
---
Because 50 percent are spergs, 50 percent are dicks
---
Said the bigoted loser.
---
That's depends heavily upon what else you brought. With capitol reps and fleet bonuses on field, a proteus can turn into an indestructible killing machine.
---
Naw, that was on purpose. Trying to get the same tone as the original video. The background noise is from the Paul Harvey track, but I had a hard time matching the same acoustics. Next time I’m going to let Wulkans fix the audio for me instead of doing it myself.
---
Hentogaria as well, using skiffs and a boosting claymore + a charon
---
You ask, CCP delivers !
---
Get the new exclusive Proteus Police SKIN for only $4.99, and receive as a gift a free bag of dicks !
---
Fuck it! We'll do it live!!!!
---
I'm pretty sure they are tagged premium to exclude them from sales or discounts. I swear CCP had a skin giveaway on twich awhile back and the T&amp;Cs was that premium skins were excluded.
---
I'm totally with you, I was just feeling pseudo-smart. Ty for providing conversation.
---
Came in an in-game evemail for me
---
This tbh
---
yes
---
&gt;wh group. But then you get thrashed around a lot.
---
:thonk:
---
I'm okay with daily rewards/events whatever. It requires you to actually do something to get something instead of the super low effort log in rewards.
---
Honestly it would be cool for CCP to actually adapt some good PvE ideas from other MMOs such as dynamic daily/weekly events and rewards. Incursions and trig invasions are a good first step towards that but they seem like much larger events than what would be necessary to return some player interest towards PvE.
---
I learn that the hard way. There is some guys out there than can wait ages on a fucking perch. When they get me, Even when i get mad, i have to give them my respects.
---
Isnt an easy job. And not everyone has the nerves to do it.
---
They haven't altered it or removed the pack from the store... yet.
---
The referring account receives a month of PLEX, not SP, unless things have changed in the last few months.
---
I don’t see this going well for CCP at all, there will be no way to resolve this without receiving even more backlash from people who will see it as unfair that some accounts were able to take advantage of this before it was changed to accounts &lt;30 days old.
---
There are high class WHs C5 groups on total opposite sides of the coin. Groups like new beans are all about the kill board. Groups like MCAV don't give a single shit about the kill board.
---
As for why some groups look down on low class WHs well. A lot of people see low class as fat crabs and newbros. Not really dedicated to WH life. Just visitors passing through.
---
Or as groups hiding from capital ships for fear of being evicted.
---
brace yourself it's godawful
---
They know how we feel??? THEY KNOW HOW WE FEEL???? They know nothing!!!! No need to backtrack if you know HOW WE FEEL!!!!!
---
We've gone with a minimum of three Domis, each extra Domi cuts the bash time down by a few minutes.
---
&gt;linger in the shadows for a long time as the **MPTC thing** did
---
What was that about?
---
Very glad you could join us and meet new people. Sixth Empire folks are super awesome to hang out with, that's how they recruited me XD
---
no.  just my praxis was stalling due to overspeed
---
perhaps your brain was deleted
---
That comparison sucks and I don't get why people keep using it. 
---
You play EVE in your free time and I don't get money for watching netflix, but I can make ISK while doing so.
---
I cant wait till they release the rorqual dlc pack that are 1 time use and only for accounts 30 days or newer to catch up! Only $149.99!
---
thats a lot of words that boil down to "it's not"
---
Wait, what the fuck? That was the one uncrossable line!
---
This isn't normal.  You're talking to the wrong groups.
---
Git gud confirmed.
---
We are talking about cloaky hunting ships in wh
---
They need to remove any market skillpoint item period. Injectors were a horrible idea. Eve is about putting in the time and effort. Not about buying Plex and injecting years.
---
This is all planned, now people on the fence will purchase it as they will now have a fear of missing out. 
---
If they really cared they would have removed it from the store and reintroduced it with those restrictions in place.
---
we shouldn't have to feel anything.
---
ccp promised this wouldn't happen - so why the fuck did it?
---
A wormholer doesn't say "this ship is basically worthless." The right thought process would be "my proteus can scram/point quite far, I can also fit command bursts, with a couple buddies this ship is a good tackler."
---
Wormhole life is a mindset.
---
Do you have any recommendations on who to talk to? I’ve spoken to The Mighty Beans and another 2 c2/c5 corps do far and they both seem really depressing. They have decently nice people, but it’s just not fun dealing with the atmosphere.
---
Thanks for the explanations
---
Then once Legacy loses that fight, the PL/NC corps will trickle into INIT. Then, to kill Panfam, the Imperium must kill itself.
---
This shows how brain dead you really are if you think Grath is still in PL
---
Good, I want to buy it.
---
I would pay for a 1 time use item that let you redistribute all your skill points.
---
Right, so buy now so I don't miss out?
---
Wormholers like to think they're great and all that, but their elitism is unbearable.
---
Yeah theres one in the osmon area where all the chars are named ghanxiou (some chinese spelling).  Hes got like 26+ alts all with the same naming convention and he does precisely the same thing that the op describes.  Has his own gank squad too.
---
Ill go back when Hossin is deleted
---
It would be interesting to know just how many SP for $ packs they did sell, the data they have gathered on the sale is going to be a driving factor for future pack sales. I imagine that once the marketing and financial departments see the influx of funds, there will be little the devs can do to stop this shit from happening again.
---
Well everyone knows that, better than being a terribad FC I guess
---
No way are there 3000 new players per day. Are these new accounts or existing accounts creating alts? Are they 1 person creating 3000 accounts? This sounds fishy and like someone is playing politics with numbers.
---
Is mining on this scale actually profitable? I feel like high sec mining isnt that profitable
---
Anybody who lives near an ice belt system sees this sort of thing on a regular basis.
---
Proteus works fine
---
The biggest thing I’ve seen is skill requirements and alt requirements, but haven’t found much in the way of killboard requirements or whatever. There are a few “new to wormhole” friendly groups out there. TDSIN, POSPY, and probably a few others I just can’t think of atm.
---
Do you have a preference on class of wormhole you want to live in?
---
Its accelerators now I believe.
---
Welcome to the prelude of summer of rage part 2.
---
Nobody likes a feeder tbh go join horde
---
The reason is that ganking an Orca takes a lot more coordination of alpha than a Venture or barge. They're not online to spend effort, just fill their peen with any explosion and newbie tears they can manage.
---
With slams like that you must be that guy at sporting events yelling at people for being bad, but wishing desperately you had an ounce of ability to play.
---
You just keep your computer open while doing stuff irl. It generally takes a few minutes to probe it down and clear it, so especially if there are a bunch of other sigs in the system you don’t have to check dscan too often, maybe every 5 minutes
---
If you can't even scan and find one you like u wont last long on your own, your expectations will never be met. Join an established Corp and be a do-er
---
C1/C2 atm
---
It's not even third party it's more like who's got the bigger dog pile
---
"The", not "your"
---
god these newfags
---
To be honest I would rather see them sell newbies a booster kind of thing that will let them get x amount of sp in a short time. But the boost effect only works for honest new accounts younger then X days. And the boost effect only effective while online
---
That way new accounts can skip the first month or so
---
Who are you
---
At $20/1000 plex a pop? Nah fam, if anything they'll be like "Oh PLEX prices are spiking again, this is great!"
---
So brave
---
Is there not a difference between feeder and actively trying to participate in groups and learn wormhole pvp mechanics?
---
Spoilers
---
And you’re talking about the blood raider one?
---
what do after his Tengu explodes on the first can?  another one?
---
"all of wormhole space" 
---
I am a solo player and make good money hacking sites in wormhole space. It is actually best return on investment using an under 2mil Imacus.

Nah you just learn from not dieing. If you keep dieing you can't say you've learned.
---
Nothing to do with shifting meta unless ccp makes supers and titans completely useless, the damage is already done with the amount of them that have been built. The last 2 years will permanently damage the game.

I think you overestimate how far o3 and qrfj are in the ansiblex era

Don't oversell your local spam. You are annoying, but didn't do much more than that.

Hello!
---
I’m a recruiter from the Mighty Beans, and I have been since it’s creation. It seems we have a lot of bad rep for caring about the killboard. I personally don’t care about it, and the majority of our members don’t either... How did we earn this stigma?

Let me adjust my golden monocle
---
I get why there's an outcry over this, but I don't particularly agree. Not going to lose sleep over the pack getting changed but I don't think it's a huge problem either.
---
We're both right, kinda.  It used to be you got 500 PLEX when they went omega.  Now you get 2x 24H accels when they make any purchase, 350 PLEX when they Omega, and an extractor when they buy PLEX specifically.  I assume you get all 3 at once if their first purchase is a month's PLEX.  So they're still *kinda* selling SP, but it's a trivial amount and only applies when you're creating another paying alt.  It's a lot less offensive than 5 bucks for 1m SP
---
You guys care about your killboard? Could've fooled us with all the feeding.
---
Other than logistics, what good is that type of C2?
---
flair checks out
---
If you're comparing yourself to other posters on /r/eve there's a pretty high chance you're correct &gt;_&gt;
---
You guys were pretty nice regarding killboards and stuff. Sorry if i made you lot seem bad at all, as i was not meaning to focus on you. You guys just had the more memorable name, so i mentioned you as you are a big c5 group ive spoken to. It was bad grammar on my part and i can edit the post.
---
Popping cans is not so easy in high sec.
---
So this could be out of date, but EVE University has a Corp that runs out of a c2. They might be a good way for you to get started in wormhole space and expand your knowledge.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Campus
---
Hope that helps!
---
This is not wrong.
---
3000 sounds like bullshit. No way. That'd be over a million per year.
---
To my mind the difference is feeding is getting your shit handed to you in the same way repeatedly without learning the lessons. 
---
Actively seeking experience is giving something a try and seeing what you learn from it, but the key thing is learning.
---
This will range from the most basic “if I go to Tama in a battleship looking for good fights I am going to get gangbanged” to more nuanced “oh I would have been better using x/y ammo/trying to dictate range/trying to keep my transversal up /fitting x/y/z module in that match-up/overheating my tank/guns earlier (or at all)/not taking that fight at all”
---
I’m not a wormholer but generally actively trying to learn from your fights will lead to more wins which in turn will lead to a green killboard.
---
I’d recommend you find a ship you like and get good with it - learn it’s nuances.
---
Or Legacy's Omist and Fey, their allies GotG in Branch and Tenal or Imperium allies in Perrigan Falls.
---
&gt;I assure you none of us ever had nor ever will have a gewn alt or a dozen &lt;3
---
You mean all those people not deployed for this war are your alts? Deploying your alt to fight against yourself would be kinda silly after all...
---
The Wuos bot / multiboxer is an interesting one for sure.
---
If the retrievers get ganked, he would then come out in skiffs.
---
The orca also gets fitted with remote repairs, and that can mean taking up to 3 t2 Catalysts to get a successful kill on one of the retrievers.
---
That looks great, thanks! Would be a good place for me to start.
---
People having a melt down about this.... literally can buy plex and do the same thing with skill injectors for the last 3 years. We get a little discount and everyone is freaking out?
---
A person with 150m sp isnt going to magically turn the tides of  battle with 151m skill points. A newbro with 10m sp and now 11m sp might yolo a blinged out boat they have been saving for into low sec for a gf though. SP does not effect the game as much as knowledge/experience. 
---
I wish I had more accounts to buy with. 
---
PS. I have karma to burn, so all you salty eve vet fuck nuggets on this subreddit feel free to hit that down arrow.
---
I hate all PvE.  I just about manage a bit of PI every week or two.
---
Well u/avree any proof been provided to you? Or was this a ban?
---
EVE has now finally entered the "get as much cash as possible and then let it burn" phase of MMORPGs.
---
Hate the changes CCP has been making, everything is about driving Plex sales.
---
You’re right In my opinion. I’ve been practicing with the rupture specifically so far. I haven’t died a lot, but have been trying to focus on correcting orbits and choosing better engagements. Learning about sig tanking has made me completely respect frigates a lot more.
---
Or you just sit on the hole and crank the sound up. And back to eve once you hear the magic whopwhop of an activation
---
Why does CCP want to ruin this game so bad?
---
Hugfleet has been in WHs too
---
I dont feel its askew at all, TAPI and GOONs are essentially one entity at this point for strat purposes, thats what people are saying and thats the reality.
---
You're quite literally a fucking retard if you think that you going over and hamfistedly farming Goon ratters and renters woudln't result in consequences, but I'm all for you proving me wrong.
---
No it’s all good man, no hard feelings. I was just curious why it comes up so much in this subreddit.
---
There is a difference between being a teacher and allowing for occasional mistakes and helping correct them.
---
Honestly not sure. It probably means you are a bigger group and more people know you. It makes sense that you’d hear negative stuff.
---
Lol, exactly...
---
This would actually be a nice addition.
---
TBH I've never done it. I assumed it just gave suspect status.
---
Not my thing but I heard jackdaws are good for caldari L4's
---
Might as well just go this route, just buy them  starter packs wholesale!
---
This on the the "GameTime" link if you click on 3rd Party Retailers.....
---
### Wholesale Distributors
---
If you are looking to buy EVE Time Codes or Starter Packs in bulk, please contact one of our authorized wholesalers:
---
Wow. That's horrible. Why are they letting this happen?
---
Can you link your fit? The blood raider ones do em and thermal
---
You re an idiot
---
and yet you're still being rejected. 
---
"allowing for mistakes and correcting them" is literally teaching. Standards exist for a reason and complaining on reddit isn't gonna make them go away, there are plenty of corps accepting players in whs with no pvp experience, just go to them.
---
The mountain of SP required to be competitive in EVE is one of the biggest stumbling blocks for new players. 
---
Fuck you and your "fuck yall i got mine" attitude. 
---
Eve should not be balanced around SP, just like it shouldn't be balanced around ISK. Both have proven to be terrible methods of balance. Injectors aren't going anywhere.
---
It doesn't matter if it takes 20M or 2M sp to pilot a ship, if its overpowered, its going to be abused. Except if its 20M, then every newbro without $500 or a 10 year old character that can fly anything is going to be left in the dust.
---
wE CaRe aBoUt oUr kIlLbOard?! Mighty Bean btw
---
Make sure you get your learning skills done. Will make training your pvp skills much quicker
---
There is an unresolved dichotomy between "new players can be effective with low SP" and "a few more SP will help new player retention". 
---
You can't have it both ways CCP (Falcon) - I love the game - but the idea that "more SP at the start of a career" will increase retention flies in the face of "new players can have just as much fun and impact from day one." They are, at their core, contradictory statements in my small, drug and beer addled, spod-brain.
---
"Marketing" are arguing with "Game Design" and this is the result - "PR" are having kittens (if you haven't sacked them all)
---
Hugs.
---
Great outcome.
---
the only game like eve is albion online
---
Do you know Rift?
---
Sad story. :((
---
Rude but probably deserved.
---
Feel free to elaborate on why I'm an idiot so I can improve :)
---
Sadly not. CONCORD.
---
I can suggest sharing such intel on the in-game channel minerbumping or finding an agent of CODE. to 'assist' with appropriate actions to the bots once you have nearly stripped the belt next time?
---
Many bittervets have more isk than they know what to do with.
---
I used to patrol in Jerma until they adapted their scripts to dock as soon as I entered local...
---
Beans stopped focusing on the killboard a long time ago. They’ve had talks about it, and have actively worked to focus less on it and more on content and being nicer. It’s a bad stereotype at this point :(
---
I would strongly disagree with your overall assessment. There were a handful of very competent c5/6 groups but the vast majority have always been krabs with a big mouth because they could throw around lots of bling to win even numbered fights. But they would never take a fight they could lose something in even if it was BCs vs T3s. 
---
And while a lot of lowend WH corps are newer players and the corps are more likely to take in low SP players they often have a strong core of vets who just are fed up with low/null play and want to play in a smaller scale environment and without caps.
---
Well that sucks.
---
I still got a porpoise and hulk over there, stop by 
---
Phreakytoes and freekytoes.  Cant miss me.
---
Doesn't work for stations, only citadels.
---
Changing the pack to only apply to accounts &lt; 30 days old is the right move. It seems they just didn't think through the implications of making the pack exactly like the other packs, and it wasn't some sleight-of-hand attempt to sell SP.
---
Unfortunately, to me this feels like a big band-aid for the problem. A better option to me would be to give you a similar reward upon first-time Omega activation. The cynic in me says that they considered this but went with the starter pack option since it has the additional benefit of padding their pocketbooks for end of quarter. 
---
VoV
---
Let me adjust my golden buttplug.
---
Slashers are great too, so is the Atron.
---
The line to remember is, "If nobody tackles anything then we can't kill anything."
---
report them
---
What's the difference between this and Skill Injectors? A person buys PLEX from CCP and sells it and buys Skill Injectors. I don't see much of a difference.
---
&gt;Beans care about killboard
---
&gt;Welp multi billion isk battleships and tons of T1 stuff
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
What's so apealing about Albion to EVE players? Seriously asking, I don't have that much time for gaming so I'm hesitant about playing some random time consuming MMO without some solid reason to try it out, but I see Albion pop up a lot in the EVE community.
---
That being said, if you are into single player RPGs you might wanna try Kenshi... it is brutal and unforgiving, if you avoid save scumming and deal with the consequences of your actions the game can lead you to seriously gruesome and interesting paths. It's an indy game with kindda weird graphics and heavy requeriments on your hardware, but I've totally falled in love with it.
---
Now people will buy it so they don't miss out. Genius move.
---
XL Cruise with range bonus and damage bonus to supercapital size hulls. Super heavy focused damage bombs that wreck supercapitals.
---
We need a supercapital counter.
---
Save EVE remove skillpoints from the game period!
---
Let me adjust your golden buttplug.
---
Unsubbed and biomassed already, just here for the memes and watching people continue to waste money.
---
I suspect that the "delete" button in /r/Eve was implemented for OP
---
This was predicted when Black Desert bought CCP.
---
Initial burden of evidence is on you for making the assertion that fighting null bads is not very hard.
---
I can assure you that taking on roughly the same number of capitals as we have BS is both fun and hard.
---
Yeah, the nyx/hel bots for leadership really sweetened the deal.
---
what happened to eve war of ascension??
---
also nova empire are similar to eve
---
Brutal.
---
Like I said elsewhere, the retrievers require about 3 T2 catalysts. At least once he has noticed that you are ganking him.
---
(yes have ganked in Wuos).
---
Get out now while you still can
---
This post is the post that /r/eve doesn't deserve but it someimes gets anyway. Good luck OP, your positive attitude and receptivity to everyone's advice will go a long way. Welcome to EVE!
---
I can only guess, but I'd say it's the sandbox approach of Albion, which enables you to chart your own course. Add in the PvP (All you had on you in PvP drops when you get killed) in addition the separation of the game world in Zones which work kinda like High, Low-sec and Null/WH space and the player-driven economy and marketplace (idk where Albion's Jita 4-4 is). add in mining/manufacturing and stuff that EVE players tend to do all the time(Ratting etc.) and you get an answer.
---
I've been in the same Worm Hole corp for years. We love PVP but we don't cry over losses. As we say, bob giveith and bob takeith. 
---
Our killboard isn't bad but if we really cared about it, it could be better. Mainly because we'll take the bait and we'll punch above our weight class if we think it will be fun.
---
Yeah, I did abyssals there and he was there quite often with a TEST alliance guy doing the same thing. Both of them had about 12-20 accounts and were constantly rolling the ice belt. They would log on within a few minutes of its suspected repop and would be stationed outside of the refinery waiting for the anom.

God damn.. the only thing worse than r/eve is the forums..

soo, EVE is broke or something is happening?
---
I tried repeatedly in minerbumping, including offering to set up warpins. But since there's no reason at all to trust my character it wasn't too hot, and rightfully so since I wouldn't seek you out if I didn't have a grudge match for someone else. I also sent printscreens and live intel to a CODE agent who had previously ganked in the system, and reimbursed one of his ganks to incentivize further visits. (This is how I know the other retrievers dont react at all when a couple of them die.) This post is the next step, all info revealed and you can all count on that these 13 retrievers will be there whenever the next ice belt spawns (unless they are banned).
---
You can’t be locked for 10 seconds after you drop out of warp. Plenty of time to slow down
---
Runescape!
---
/u/ccp_falcon If the purpose of the SP in the pack is ultimately for newer players and is linked to retention, why not give new players the ability to earn SP through agency activities? At this point of the game, is letting new players grind to 10M or 20M SP a big deal? I'm sure some frustration new players have is having to wait a long time to get into a ship AND more time to fly it effectively (this caused my first rage quit). After that threshold, players can earn SP through time as normal and if they get to that point, presumably they will have invested some time to stick with the game. Veteran players over the threshold can be exempt from these rewards and the SP extraction threshold could be adjusted to it as well. idk, this seems a no brainer to me to retain new players.
---
Kinky. Go on.
---
CCP: "Ok everyone we have a problem, 90% of our new players quit the game after a week how can we solve that ?"  
---
CCP "good idea guys" - "Let's create a P2W pack for only 5€"   
---
we're saved guys
---
This post arrived three years late
---
Honestly, most groups don't care about killboards. Looking at the Beans' killboard, I can't say I'm terribly impressed - not sure why they'd give you a hard time, since they're nothing to write home about.  Without knowing the others I can't really comment, but C2 C5/NS groups are always going to be much more PVP focused, so that might be part of the problem - the nature of those holes lends itself to PvP, so if you're more interested in PvE I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  Basically they're not going to want to keep their static tied up so you can run sites or huff gas instead of rolling it for more content.  Check out any of the groups living in C4 space as possible better options for you.  They tend to be a little more balanced in their approach.
---
Oh, I havent seen any skiffs at all during my time there, but I don't doubt you're correct. He might swap if he cares to, and if his program can handle a smaller ore bay of course.
---
Already bought them on all my accounts and I have skill injectors and implants on standby for alts for the next supercapital battle to rapidly inject, train, fly titan, activate accelerator and go to work on some enemy titans.
---
Depends how the relationship is. If you give someone a system and tell them who your friends are and ask them not too shoot them, you're not really a pet. If you run it like a medieval lord, demanding taxes and manpower to fight your wars, you've created a vassal. To be a pet you have to act like a pet, staying at your masters  heel and answer every beck and call, hoping you'll get some scraps. There are not many pets in eve that I am aware of.
---
When i need to take a break from eve i go play FIFA till EA servers piss me off and drives me right back to eve lol
---
Oh jeeze, almost like all those players that missed out on one million free SP by like 14 hours for a login promotion...
---
Constantly Counter Productive
---
Albion is a walking dumpster fire
---
omg

http://prntscr.com/o740pa

\&gt;  Nah you just learn from not dieing. If you keep dieing you can't say you've learned.   
---
That's bullshit. There is plenty to learn from failure, usually more than what you learn from success.  
---
If you go out there and put yourself in pvp situations where you usually win, that means that you're actively avoiding taking fights where you're actually challenged to get better. Nobody is just magically awesome at this game, it's far too nuanced and complicated for that.
---
When you invade people turf you should not expect people to be fair, and when you get invaded, you don't expect them to field 50% of their force cause fairness.
---
Issue here is that there is one entity which is bigger than everyone, that still bring all its friends and pets, and still is like "please undock lel".
---
When was the last time panfam went 3:1 against any real enemy? When was the last time you didn't and won?
---
They don't get money that way. I'm all for CCP to be financially solvent but skillpoints isn't the way to do it.
---
Who?
---
This is always going to be a polarising issue with a few underlying themes. 
---
Some groups are desperate to be elite, to never feed or lose a fight and have a great looking killboard. Very often this results in them taking ages to form up for any sort of fight, never undocking without the perfect fleet comp. 
---
Some will only overship and outship and sort of fleet, ganking and then running and rolling. Some will drop caps on subcap fleets and try to roll people in. 
---
This can be fun for the people who really like to compare how good their killboard looks like compared to another groups, and who never like to 'lose' a fight. 
---
Other groups care more about the fun, and taking a fight win or lose. They'll usually form up faster and try to have a fight with anything that comes their way. 
---
Neither way is 'right'. People play the game they want to, but it often creates friction between various groups. For example, we rolled into a group who cared about their KB just the other week, much larger than us and decided to put 2x Typhoons on a hole to see what they would bring. The result was over 10 Leshaks plus smaller support ships. 
---
Clearly, the difference in wants meant that a fight never happened, so neither group really had fun.
---
You need to figure out what type of gameplay you want, and find a corp that matches that.
---
Sadly cans cannot be destroyed, this was quickly up on my list and then off it again. The second thought was to flip all his cans and shoot them once they were mine, but the jettison cooldown shuts that down before one has caused even 5m of damage. But I've listed some methods to get back at him that work that I invite anyone else to pick up, since they're profitable and I feel fairly done in the system after my ice heist revenge.
---
Use a domi then. Between the heavy neuts and MJD you’re pretty hard to tackle, too
---
This. ^^
---
Only after they give a counter to cloaking in general, stealth is too over powered.

Since most of CCP is in PanFam they're using CCP hax as revenge for our burning of Tribute.
---
This is a valuable and original idea, thank you OP for posting it.
---
&gt; We weren't hired
---
Lol
---
The only difference is the skill injectors, at least in theory, were designed to be skills removed from other pilots. But with the advent of skill goo farms, promotional login campaigns, and other free SP rewards it's kind if a moot point.
---
I love the pack by the way, CCP can sell all the SP they want in my book, it wont cause the gameplay to actually change. Goons will still be rofflestomping NCPL forever, since they dont fight back. Eventually Goons will get fat and lazy, failcascade and get sacked by the whole game. Except it wont be a bunch of newbies in corvettes hacking our shit itll be skill injected fax pilots hacking our shit.

How are existing covert damage ships overpowered compared to 100+ titans?
---
Let alone 500...
---
There seems to be a lot of threads on /r/eve lately about "Why do wormhole corps do X?" or "I"ve heard wormholers do X, is that true?"
---
The answer to every one of these questions is "There is no logical reason any wormhole corp does anything. Every decision they make is quantum probability. Attempting to understand their behavior is like understanding why a die rolls a 5."
---
Oh, I seen the word pet thrown around quite a bit on this subreddit when it comes to describing sides in a war or conflict.
---
Example: "Coalition A had to fight against Coalition B and their pets."
---
Karmafleet, Brave, EveUni and Horde beg to disagree. Eve has always been about getting up that learning curve. You can suck for  six months and then you get better almost at an exponential rate as all your skills start clicking together. I don't know why the sudden mentality to start catering to a bunch of 14yr olds raised by fortnight crept in but I sucked and I kept sucking until I learned how to not.
---
Only if it's super expensive and has a set life. Like once you build it it's power core is so unstable that it will blow up after 7 days.
---
I also like the idea of a set number in the game at a time. 
---
But I agree with pretty much everybody else. Power Creep Sucks. Don't do it.
---
the drifters have probably accomplished more than horde did in their delve deployment
---
The countet exist ... it's call dread.
---
Neither did you ... doughnut 👍
---
Valuable yes. Original no. Not throwing shade but don't think for one second the old heads of us here have not been pointing in the direction the wind is blowing for the last 10 years.
---
salty lol
---
Anyone who isn't a horribly misinformed brainlet like yourself.
---
Ahh, now the weird pings I'm getting start to make sense.
---
So the Drifters are fed up with our shit and are burning everything. Yeah, I'm pretty okay with this.
---
Oh, good, you've finally realised how absolutely retarded it is to sperg out over every single PvP loss.
---
They keep him from ratting.
---
if you try to obverpowered you do'nt have understand the use of cloacky. The original purpose was to permit to attack people isolated and bomb fleet. 
---
Bombing was to powerfull so CCP introduce a counter. 
---
You ask for a golden ammo ship who can kill every big thing with 0 effort. 
---
you want kill 100 titan ? bring 500 dread.
---
Thanks for the input. It makes a lotta sense looking at it like that.
---
Soooo it's just 3 of the same Offensive Subsystem?
---
Wait, where's my SOE caps?
---
Join MCAV. We do not give a single shit about the killboard.
---
Dominix will have heavy neuts and an MJD. It’ll be quite a bit harder to hunt without a decent sized gang, the days of two or three frigates being able to harass ratters are going to be over. Even a solo t3c will have trouble dealing with a full rack of heavy neuts.
---
Here, just for you:
---
"^/s"
---
Pretty much. I spent 30 minutes on a perch last night while doing work; then grabbed my Buzzard - as I'm doing the last can someone decloaked - I bolted luckily.
---
My favourite noob moment was practicing D-Scan and tracking someone's Imicus thinking, "It's safe - I'm not shooting him, he's not shooting me."  I then procede to warp directly from planet to adjoining moon, get dragged, land next to the canister they dropped, and get shot by the sentinels. Yeah, shoulda known that was coming.
---
Best UA snuff fc NA 2020.
---
I see two counters to supers in Eve
---
1) super pwnermobiles, cost 100trit and one shot supers. (Since we are going ridiculous)
---
2) admit the power creep has arrived and remove excavators, wait for super population to return to normal
---
What's bullshit is that you can't fix stupid. KB is everything! Stats do not lie.
---
Fuck off krab
---
Shadow cartel are shit. Tachs still lose to arty machs.
---
 I think the difference that people may take issue with is when you buy Plex with $, it is introducing a way to buy game time into the market with ISK, allowing players keep their accounts active without being forced to pay a subscription fee.
---
  By selling SP directly for cash, instead of the plex&gt;isk&gt;skill injector, it could cause an ingame scarcity of plex, drastically increasing the isk cost to plex your account through ingame means, and possibly forcing players to pay the monthly subscription fee, or just stop playing all together.
---
  I’ve heard a lot of people voice their concern that this is “pay to win”, but I think the bigger problem is that it could remove the viability of the “play to pay” options to keep accounts active.
---
You imply ccp cares? Pfft.
---
Because a lot of your members would give shit to players who went out and looked for content. Your leadership even set a loss limit for a guy who was at the top of your monthly kills. Every time someone would want to go out and practice they'd get an avalanche of "but muh killboard".      
---
Former Bean, BTW. Left that shit ASAP, and good riddance.
---
They are killing the ratting VNI. Pvp VNI is going to be a bit different but still really strong
---
You know CCP can't do shit when the inception tells a new player to web down a ship to prevent it from entering warp
---
This was back in 2017.
---
When he notices he is being ganked, his Orca has tough shield boosters that *really* make the retriever harder to kill. Most Gankers have probably given up before he has to bother changing to skiffs.
---
Dreads ARE NOT a counter to a titan/super blob. 500 titans kill 500 dreads with their 500 dds and mop them up within a couple minutes. That is not what I would call a counter. For dreads to be considered a true counter titans ehp and dds would need to be nerfed along with a fax nerf.
---
I could imagine corps focused on a very specific field such as pirating in nullsec wouldn't have invested the skill points into mining and spending the ISK to fly large barges in dangerous territory. Wouldn't it be beneficial to task a mining corp to help in that regard?
---
no, true though
---
Even if it's just 10 mil per hour, and you run your bot for 20 hours per day, that's still 6 bil.
---
\&gt; More SP are not magically going to make player retention better. Instead of wasting time on finding ways to suck money out of new players, CCP should focus on making the game fun again and creating more opportunities for player interaction. 
---
Damn straight. I'm a noob but I started playing in 2017. Didn't get back into it until this latest xpac, which is a step in the right direction, but they need to build on this momentum not rest on the mildly positive reception the playerbase has given. Gone are the days where MMOs go months, even years without major content updates. EVE needs to adapt to this new gaming climate and fast.
---
Wow the beans cared about the billboard until dolphins joined then that went down the drain.nothing but feeding with a little bit of green
---
Fuck off. Said what I meant and stand behind it.
---
The killboard sperging is why they feed. Getting good at PvP requires losing ships, and if you're shitscared of losing shit because your leadership is giving you crap for every loss then you're not going to get better and you'll feed in every fight.
---
Yes. He tried to drop catalysts on my mach when i did this and missed the warping since I was moving, so keep that in mind if you go there. But other than that, yep, it'd work
---
Oh ok thanks for your valuable input through tons of experience in lowsec combat.
---
Even I have to admit this is a dumb question but, where do I see my unallocated skill points? I feel like I’ve been up and down the character sheet but I can’t find a number. Where are they?
---
when did facts become a form of sodium chloride
---
No proof has been provided.
---
People who are "elitist" cry when a group of no elit people come and blap they.
---
After they will cry eve is dead. Normal logic of zkillbBrain
---
I’ve always liked this corp name tbh. 
---
Never met them tho...
---
Lmao, nah, you're part of the problem.
---
Quit being dumb please.
---
And then this game will full of that bullshit super bomber you've proposed
---
Dreads are already very powerful and costeffective comparing with super capitals, the problem is always about N+1 game
---
Globby you do suck, after all.
---
yep np. Glad i could help. ))
---
Oh please tell me Drifters finally got tired of capsuleer's bullshit and are starting to burn structures all over the place.
---
True. You have a long list of losers who find excuses to stop playing Eve because they got their butts hurt here an there.
---
 Nobody's denying Eve is dying (again), but I see a list of dull, boring games that don't even have a fraction of Eve's competitiveness.
---
Cry more ZkillBrain.Cry more.
---
have fun with your 'guys trust me, i saw them botting 100%, but just trust me' meme post
---
the guy literally said they actively gank and bump other miners who mine in the belt, which directly conflicts with the botting narrative
---
Actually, CCP did implement a system if you look at it in the correct way.
---
Killmail.
---
You could pay merc and pirate corps per killmail of your enemies within the dates and location specified in whatever agreement you make with them. You could also increase the payout incentive depending on the difficulty to destroy a particular class of ship. Obviously I would pay more for a battleship than I would a frigate.
---
Basically, it would become PVP Ratting.
---
when you open up your character skill menu at the bottom left corner there are 2 buttons that look like and injector, the one on the right has a plus (+) symbol followed by numbers (your allocated skill points)
---
to allocate those skill points just click on that injector button with the plus symbol and go from there.
---
Look I dont understand the outrage you can already buy SP..  I really wish the devs would stop reading this reddit as it will damage the game more than ever help it
---
Makes sense since 300 titans is the only thing you would be able to see using look outside.
---
You saw how much salt that produced, it will be the same people, but this time they will complain that they weren’t told when it would end.
---
He was being sarcastic, you totally missed it.
---
Don't be salty, just move on.
---
There a re also mega krabs in C5-6 that grind like crazy and nowadays mkstt of them even hold sov to keep grinding in k-space.
---
They're going crazy in TEST space also...
---
Oh for sure! I'm excited.
---
they are shooting structures in esoteria too, im guessing its some kind of lore thing related to the triglavians
---
It was a reality even when CCP tried to pump up revenue while trying to find buyers for their trainwreck of a company.
---
fuck yer right, time to get a carrier that has probe tubes instead of fighter tubes
---
Oh the irony is palpable.
---
It is called dreads
---
Dreads need more ehp, titans need a nerf to cap gun dps so they arent doing the same damage as dreads, and LR fibos on supers can gtfo. Then we're talking.
---
yeah, because the people who care are the ones actually spending money on this game these days. lmao, that ship sailed 5 years ago.
---
Yes, the Blood Raider one. I've not messed with the Guristas
---
I love when CCP's bullshit events that they tell us nothing about is indistinguishable from bugged out code.
---
I know that your only defense mechanism against wrongthink is to scream kool-aid, but do try to approximate a sentient creature in the future, if only for the sake of my hope for the continued survival of the human race.
---
how is cloaking op? a cloaked ship can't kill anything
---
It's used to make the allies of Coalition B feel bad.
---
I think your assumption is a sound one, but perceived military might is a big part of that.
---
Why are ~~some wormhole~~ groups so focused on killboards
---
FTFY
---
Yeah I was going to say, who even cares anymore?
---
Too late. Moved on.
---
yeah wuos has been a botting paradise for as long as ive played the game because its quite isolated.
---
Evolution is still in NC. with SirMolle as CEO. Even after Bob died for good and goons took Delve, the people behind it didn’t just go away and quit
---
something something INIT deployment
---
"wait for super population to return to normal"
---
Doesn't understand players in this game.
---
I've been out of the game for a few years so I don't really have a horse in the race.  I think the issue isn't paying for SP, it's paying for SP that's being added to the game from nothing.  Skill injectors take SP from one player and give it to another.
---
imagine if rorquals only served as capital industrial ships; boosting, storage, compressing etc. and not as t3 barges
---
This need upvotes.
---
the meta of two or three frigates harassing ratters came about because there's no other way to catch a vni
---
but you can catch a domi with a nulli t3 and drop two or three blops on it
---
or just create 13\~ mission where you do the exact same thing "killing NPC" even if that's the most annoying thing in Eve "what you don't have fun guys? please stay i'm gonna punch you in the balls as a reward"  
---
and they dont known why new players left the game ?
---
So I logged it in - but do not see my current market orders - what am I missing? You mention market watches? Can you please explain further?
---
*"emergent gameplay"*
---
If you think dreads are a counter to 500 titans with existing balance, I've got a bunch of stuff I'd like to sell you.
---
Lmao what
---
I agree with you on this . Yes it may hurt the skill farmers for a bit . But it sure helps knock out some of the basics . And if they toss it out there every once in a great while as special then so be it . I myself cringe every time I look at my Que and not being able to get into what I want . I dont want to be researching for the next several years . But they just need to change it for 30 to 60 day players and be done with it .
---
Any way you can throw me that fit? :)
---
Titan fleets existed well before rorquals. Just look at B-R
---
Explain in intricate detail how 500 dreads can kill 500 titans.
---
No? Thought so.
---
So bring more.
---
At one point you need to understand if you ask for a "super bompber of the dead" it will unbalance the whole game and just ruin eve. 
---
Titan are balance (just need to remove boson).  After if you gank people under umbrella and die... maybe you do something wrong.
---
Really? I know we had an isolated incident with one member that got a bit out of hand, but It was not in respect to their loss mails. It was due to a combination of other problems, not in correlation with their excessive deaths in K-Space. As for \*REE-ing\* in chat, I don't really think its fair to paint the whole corp in a bad light over a few members who like to antagonize people in VC. We have members that care about their zKill, and like to talk mess, but I really don't think that holds true for 90% of our members.
---
The man, the myth, the retard
---
Seems like Drifters finally realized one of their arch enemy, the capsuleers, can dock inside those tanky bastards
---
Horribly incorrect assessment which proves you don't understand balance.
---
after faxes changes 500 dreads can kill many titans ^(much more value than dread fleet) if people piloting them are smart.
---
That’s my point. You can’t just casually hunt anymore, you need a cyno and a  blops battleship. Even a good fit t3c wouldn’t work, but two or three working together might. 
---
I mean, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s certainly going to be a big change to the ships roaming around
---
Face palm.
---
This will sound stupid, but has anyone ever tried to set up nullsec alliance that is run like a communist state? with 100% tax on everything, members get plex money each month, ships are handed out when needed and returned after ect.
---
considering the retention rate, the attrition rate, and the relatively stagnant player count, that's actually pretty plausible.
---
Ok let me be clear:
---
Create a super low cost ship who easely counter titan will just remove umbrella.
---
Remove umbrella means a lot of peopel will jsut stop farm (and stop eve).
---
So less farm.
---
So less content.
---
So eve will be dead.
---
Create golden amo will nto solve any problem. It will just create mroe problem.
---
Albion and Black desert are the only other full loot PVP games on the market right now.
---
This guy has been in more corps in 13 days than I have in 13 years.
---
Looks like Drifters are showing Triglavs how it's done
---
I thought that was just a “visit our store! spend money on injectors! Upgrade today!!” Button. It does something else?
---
I've mention this before, on multiple occasions. Never claimed it was original.
---
cloaky proteus can get stupid dps. while not the best hunters because of their align speed, they are certainly serviceable.
---
Shit I didn't think that far ahead
---
Mutadaptive Neutralizer or something for the ewar option idk lmao
---
Make sure to check the EVE University wiki. They have mostly up to date guides on most subjects. They do have one on tanking.
---
K serious question to all the haters of this idea. Why is it so bad? What dont want your titans to die to sub caps? cry more plz.
---
That being said we already have bombs they just need a dmg based on sig bonus and remove the stupid can only launch x bombs shit. Damage immunity thanks. Maybe make them susceptible to defender missiles and actual smartbombs. Tada you now have a screening fleet for your titans. 
---
People says dreads are the solution to titans but dreads get DDed and die..no questions asked. Or get our ranged then die no questions asked. Stealth bombers at least have the maneuverability to idk not get hit by a DD.
---
I actually approve of this change get some krabs out of there capitals and into subs. But there are a lot of things that need to change in eve and production is way higher on the list than heavy bombers.
---
you're zkillbrain want a golden ammo to kill titan with 0 loss to have anice KB.
---
Zkillbrain understand less the game mechanic as a spodbrain. 
---
Zkillbrain become now the base of the chain food in eve.
---
This guys moved on.
---
since i'm not experienced as some players here, i'll just say Gallente=Drones
---
What if some devs with NCPL alts did this and this is just another T20 scandal? :tinfoil:
---
26-06 was an inside job. Desintegrators cant melt tritanium beams :colbert:
---
OP is talking about Hi Sec and not null regions. Rented regions will always have bots..
---
So I apparently didn't miss anything.. ;)
---
Nobody wants their giant krab stick to be vulnerable to 100 destroyers, let alone frigates.
---
if 500 titan bring 2500 dread. 
---
Remimber titan and super cap are anti N+1. it means they have be design to make they could win in 1v X. They are a solution to N+1 problem encoutner with less big ship. 
---
the compensation is they are very inneftive for they're ISK cost. So assymetrical warfare could win. Beacause for 1 titan price you could brong 20 dread. 
---
True problem is : people don't want looze thing, they want only a green killboard so they ask for golden ammo.
---
I dont care they NEED to be vulnerable to SOMETHING. At least a specialized frig is inline with eves mentaility. Get good at something if its only one thing.
---
They do if they retain a greater percentage of players that end up subbing and/or buying injectors. 10-20m sp opens up a wider variety of ships but generally keeps titans/supers out of reach. And a sub is still needed to fly those ships anyway.
---
ZkillBrain can't understand that.
---
Don't feed the idiots Globby...

---
This site is an incredible resource.
---
Me (and Pepperidge farm) remember
---
brong more dread against 500 titan.
---
They are decent dudes. Iakopo Nara is my spirit animal
---
Did you read the post? The bumping is 100% manual of course and done by the machariels, controlled by an active player. I have not claimed otherwise. It is only the 15 industry characters that are automated. Possibly but not certainly the ganking catalysts are also assisted by some sort of multi input tool. That would mean they all respond to the same manual key inputs rather than being activated one at the time. He could also be very good at activating guns and tabbing 11 times so it all comes active in the same server tick, I don't know he isn't. But he didn't feed me ice manually.
---
cruiser stealth bomber, bad inertia, firing disables warp drive for x seconds, low ehp, dread dps
---
Bring more dread than titan number. DD are all 5 min.
---
Oh I 100% agree. Hence why I think this idea has merit. As mentioned elsewhere, someone else came up with this a while ago.
---
eve uni is absolutely fantastic. come check out waffles too, we love teaching pvp. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/c13w9x/hard_working_pirates_wanted_waffles/
---
Oh yea ive seen it a few times I jist dont understand beyong OMG MY SPACETICKS..
---
if you have 100 destroyer and the titan is trap alone you win unless you are terribly bad. 
---
I think you're main problem is whent he titan call his friend. So maybe you need to hunt in space with less defense.
---
Can be balanced like existing stealth bombers.
---
&gt;Did you read the post?
---
&gt; Possibly but not certainly the ganking catalysts are also assisted by some sort of multi input tool.
---
unnecessary, i gank with 20+ accounts and full support wing easily. this statement is unfounded and stupid.
---
&gt;I don't know he isn't
---
easy, you can test it and post logs, but for some reason you've posted ZERO evidence.
---
&gt;But he didn't feed me ice manually.
---
0 proof posted.
---
Titan are alrady vulnerable to a lot of thing. You just proof you haven't fly one.
---
Yes, but when those members are being backed by leadership and not called out it's clear what leadership's agenda is. If your corp really doesn't care about KBs then why is your leadership silent on members hassling other members over losses?      
---
And the KB isn't even the only issue you have. Five-hour mandatory "impress our friends" fleets is another.
---
it's call a golden ammo. A lot of other post have explain why it will be not the solution. 
---
Maybe read other post before post.
---
Could you elaborate on why you want to live in these classes of space? I ask because in practice *usually* what matters is your statics (which you didn't mention), and the combination of C1 or C2 but not C3 strikes me as distinctly odd.
---
"Don't take away my super spaceship that has no reasonable counter."
---
Nope definitely dont dont even want a rorq. I do own a carrier... fucking hate it.
---
Vulnerable to what? Titan vs supper super wins titan vs dread titan wins.. Literally only way to kill them is bounce them or swarm them with more.
---
So plz enlighten me.
---
Already out of date
---
We were never that way in the first place we just had issues with people not being in hole.
---
Ooh! I know this one. My die rolls a 5 sometimes because it's one of the ones shaped like a little pyramid!
---
Joking aside, variety is definitely one of the spices of wormhole life, so we do random shit all the time. And on top of that every wormhole corp is a different mix of delightful crazy. (Or just crazy.)
---
&gt;What’s the number one thing any Gallente ship should never be without
---
Makes sense. TAPI it is then.
---
Is there even enough ice in a belt to run 20 hours of straight mining.
---
I believe the corp Evolution (executor and founder of the legendary Band of Brothers) was communist in that everyone's ships were owned by the corp, and handed out as needed for fleets. I don't think they had 100% taxes or handed out PLEX to anyone.
---
Just see how many die everyday in Zkill. 
---
In reallity a lot of peopel who complain just want a golden ammo. if people are active and farm with a lot of firend ready to protect they. Maybe you need to ask yourself  :"Did we have enought people to do that ?Did we have enought material ?".
---
Actually it's easy for a bomber fleet to kill a titan if they trap him. You do'nt need a super golden amo ship. Just learn how to trap people and make some effort. Beacause yes defender when they have titan ready to save they're friend... they make effort, they don't know when ennemy will attack., they do'nt know when, they stay on stand bye. 
---
Basically this post ask a ship "to deny all effort of defender and make attacker life a win button".  So if you don't reward effort, you will just kill eve.
---
On the upside, 30m in tags drop from the 6 bs's in cost of hubris.
---
Btw, a few yrs ago i saw a russian dude use a Prophecy when he was running minnie fw ones (enemy being amarr). The fit probably works for amarr fw too, with the enemy being minnie, the big advantage being the MJD.

Goons don't give a shit about killboards.

Imagine? That used to be the case...
---
Like so: https://imgur.com/lPL2T2P
---
Depends, for what PvP or PvE? In any case, search for ship losses on https://zkillboard.com/ for the hull you want to fly, and see if you can find a fit you like. Maybe get some more opinions by joining a newbie friendly space guild.
---
all kinds of tanking (shield, armor and hull) have buffer tanking and active tanking. buy that i mean buffer as in armor plates, shield extenders, and bulkheads. these give a raw hitpoint bonus to their kind of tank. active tanking is about the use of shield boosters and armor repairers to restore a portion of your lost hitpoints in shield or armor depending on the module. on top of that you have hardeners in several flavours that hardens your shield, armor and hull, enabling your hitpoints to last longer.

"I tried to get CODE. on this, but they were much too busy making sure 8 day old venture pilots stop playing the game rather than dealing with a highsec botter. Weird, isn’t it?"
---
You're several years too late to the party with this guy. We've been there.
---
CCP has done nothing.
---
And 8 day old Ventures that are not compliant with The New Halaima Code of Conduct are a very important target group.
---
Wait someone in goons called me a brainlet LMFAO now that's funny.
---
rail proteus works, so does a blingy rail hecate.

Yawn, how about I have a real job. Figure it out.

It's a dead meme at this point that you are not

You could maybe try Star Citizen?

It’s very relaxing. You’re spinning ships the whole time and you’re salivating about all the cool features you’re going to have very soon now.

First year in WH space hey.

We need people stop cry beacause they looze war by being bad since years.

\#ZkillBrain
---
Dunno, but it's probably more than 10 mil per hour as well.
---
If you're PvE'ing, active tank is generally better,  this means armour repairs. You'll always want a damage control, always. Next is Energized Plating ... One of the benefits of armour over shield is that you can fully tank without the need for capacitor ... DM me and I'll talk you through some fits.
---
N+1 will always beat any kind of rock-paper-scissor balancing in EVE
---
Watching people spam him with invites to horde corps after he had just finished crying about horde was pretty great.
---
Good to see he made the right decision and selected kopo's offer as the superior choice
---
damage bombs vs supers is a horrible idea. The reason bombs are fun with subcaps is because subcaps are equipped with engines and can move, making it possible to evade the bombs. Supers are pretty fuckin slow. What makes it worse is dreads and fax. They cant move in siege and would eat shit to these heavy bombers. Getting bombed in subcaps isnt too bad, theres a chance you can get out and escape if you overheat your hopes and dreams. Bombs vs almost static targets is boring in comparison.
---
evan is a hero
---
Or maybe when you move this amount of titan it's to attack an other powerbloc.
---
If this powerbloc do'nt do nothing, they desserve to die. They don't want to farm to don't have red on KB. A lot of people enjoy roamming in delve to kill farmer... so don't cry if at end farmer make big weapon. 
---
All #ZkillBrain must understand they are loosers now.
---
Im tired of this excuse. Oh I didnt kill anything becuase I didnt try hard enough go fuck yourself this is a straw man excuse at best. My not working hard enough is countered by an instant teleporting fleet of god only knows who and how many that simply have to dock reship and jump. This isnt fun this isnt balanced and frankly im glad im not a serious pvper cuz that shit is cancer.
---
And to your other comment
---
Of course I can swarm a titan with 100 Fucking ventures and it will die eventually. That is NOT being vulnerable.
---
They move instantaneously unless your dumb enough to gate it. They nuke anyting they can touch with DD.. Literally the only way to beat them is swarms and swarms of dreads or shit trash. Which again I say is NOT VULNERABLE. A carrier has a high chance of being defanged before it dies. Titans cant even compare to this let alone anything else.
---
Honestly imho DDs are a mistake. Nvm titan tracking. You should NEED STRAIGHT UP NEED A SUBCAP SUPPORT FLEET but no ccp fucked that up.
---
So plz tell me again how titans are super vulnerable to a 1-100 fight. Tell me again that its fair they can nuke just about anything else in the game with one single dd. Can teleport, can kill sub caps cuz lulz, can refit inspace off another for MAXS DD DEFENCE.. This shit is terrible for eve and CCP is to blinded by the GSM to fix it.
---
This this kids is why I stay in wh space. Fuck your titans fuck your supers and most of all FUCK YOUR CYNOS.
---
They have reasonable counter. But people don't want to use they. 
---
Beacause they need some more effort than just push F1 for one, and for other they cost money and you will looze some. 
---
"I want golden ammo beacause i m a nooby" #ZkillBrain
---
And people explained why idea is bad. You do'nt read
---
Thought this dude quit
---
Yet we've killed subcaps with single digit subcaps from a C2 and you didn't know it was possible.  
---
Also imagine getting flairbaited in 2k19
---
I like to fly gallente ships and was wondering if the proteuses is worth flying? I plan on getting gallente cruisers to 5 for the heavy assault cruisers. I also was needing amarr to 5 for the stratios buff eventually and maybe the t2 logi. Which ship of the t3c would be better for wormholes? I'm in a c5 with a small Corp currently.
---
TIL a suggestion is boring (Not providing real counters or reasonable suggestions of their own) and because it's "boring" it has no value.
---
I think our leadership does a good job resolving conflicts. However, I don't think its leadership's job to silence Killboard skeptics. I don't think the killboard discussions cross the line of harassment, making them irreverent for leadership to address in my opinion. I have also heard the "Impress our friends fleets" issue brought up before, and I have no idea what spawned it... I have never been on one of these fleets, nor have I ever heard of them taking place.... Sorry you had such a bad experience with us, thanks for the insight though. I suppose we still have a lot to work on.
---
Escape from tarkov has some familiar elements.
---
You guys can deny it all you want, it still happened.
---
What sort of proof would you accept? If I posted a video of him jettisoning ore on the exact same interval on 13 retrievers consistently (which I don't claim he does) you could just say he has optimised his mining. If I post a video of just standing still in the belt getting cans from him, you'll say he's giving me them willingly. I don't really see how anything short of a search warrant in his computer produces proof?  
---
Are you on a mission to contest any claims of bot existence in EVE, or what's the deal? If so, is everyone else in this thread with similar experiences, especially of this exact system and this person, in on my grand plot to.. do what, exactly? It's not like I think anyone cares enough about a "witch" to actually do anything about it ingame when the common notion is that the whole galaxy is a coven, and CCP certainly won't do anything without further investigation anyway. So like, what is the agenda?
---
A good tip for those that dont know. Instead of applying your reps at the beginning of your cycle with sheild reps. Armour dont apply till the end of you cycle. So you heal hp at the end instead of the beginning.  Correct if im wrong
---
And add to that the random nature of wormholes themselves. 
---
You can be krabbing peacefull, when suddenly a new sig appears and leads straight into a defenseless mining fleet, so you quickly reship into whatever is at hand to gank them... or to a fleet of 40 people in trig ships who've been ragerolling for hours and are itching for a fight, so they flood you hole and kil your blingy krab before you can align out.
---
Why not include 1m SP when someone pays for omega for the first time? Drive up omega sales and just have it as a bonus for the first time to get you started easier. Instead of just buying SP for cash. Bundle it in with the first purchase of omega with cash.
---
What makes it even funnier is that this subreddit have been begging CCP for free SP as reimbursement for local chat issues. I get people being upset about SP being generated out of air, but apparently it's ok when it's free, otherwise everyone would rage about millions of skillpoints that were handed out not so long ago.
---
The only ones that will stop farming are afk rorq pilots. Try again spinner.
---
screenshot?
---
I'm sorry but what's the issue? It's no different to buying a plex for cash, selling plex for isk then buying a skill injector..
---
It's all been bought for cash.   So... plus in this case its lasts 30 days. Whoppeee
---
I mean as  a 15 year old vet that spent years training and gaining those skills its was a massive kick in the loyalty teeth when CCP brought in injectors.
---
 But we are where we are...
---
Skill injectors have done nothing to keep new players judging by the latest keynote stats
---
Therefore they should remove the whole skill injector stuff or restrict it to max 20m SP that can be injected up to.. 
---
Its absolutely wrong someone can be a titan pilot in a day for example
---
Wait your in here big fucking because you killed a few plebs from low class WH space.
---
Also imagine using the term "imagine blank I'm 2019"
---
Give your nuts a tug miss. Go back to smashing F1 on your keyboard and jacking off with rorqual mining.
---
Thing is sucking or not has nothing to do with SP. Its about being actually good at the game after a point.
---
It takes only a few million SP to be able to fly a ship, it takes months of practice to actually pilot it well. 
---
Yes, you have to cater to modern gaming attention spans if you want to hold an audience anymore. 
---
Take a new pilot, and do everything right, get him thru the tutorial, slap him in a newbie corp with people to help, put him in fleets, and they still have to wait weeks or drop $$ on injectors to be able to fly a mainline nullsec doctrine ship. 
---
So hes sitting with his thumb up his ass waiting for weeks to actually play the game with the rest of the group. Sure there is a lot of support roles and shit he can do, but none of that immediately appeals to 90% of the players. They wanna get in a ship with guns and pew pew some enemies. And hes not gonna drop $$ for injectors on a game that he hasnt really even gotten to play yet. 
---
People invest time and money into games they feel like are worth the effort. If you get dropped into a game where everyone is running around with ARs and all you have is a pistol... Sure there's some shit you can do with the pistol, but it should be quick and easy to buy into the standard kit.
---
Make it take training time, isk, whatever to get into the full variety of eve... But make it easy... Like almost immediate to jump into one thing. At least like a t1 battlecruiser of your choice. That way a new pilot can feel like they are contributing
---
Is it actually free to play or free to get into the game but we'll make your life hell at every turn to get you to pay for shit
---
Nothing. Legacy can't go to war with Imperium, and the Imperium has zero incentive to every go to war with Legacy.
---
LOL are you mad bro??? relax lol
---
How can he join PL when he is supposed to be running CVA?!
---
Scheenins and Raneilles are both fairly common for this as well.
---
Your suggestion would basically make caps and supers unusable because there would be no counterplay for the heavy stealth bombers.
---
Thank to proof us again you don't know the eve gameplay ZkillBrain.
---
See when a team of cloacky camper are deployed in space with very few or no umbrella what happen? Yes near everyonne stop farm.
---
So give a "auto win button TROLOLOL" will just create this on the whole server. 
---
You're tear and you're misscomprhension of eve mechanic are amazing ZkillBrain.
---
Yes and my point is, my dps is already higher than yours when I'm fitting blasters and land at 0 and scram/web you compared to your cruise missiles on your fit designed for sniping, regardless of your 20% bonus in the first 35 days of play.
---
we stream sniped him yesterday...
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77482861/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77482861/)
---
it's basically a slightly more expanded version of the eve trial. everything is a little slower (training, farming, etc.) so it's not something you would want to do longterm as far as I can tell, but it's also pretty easy in a week or two of active play to make enough silver to buy a 30d sub + have enough leftover for pvp activities.
---
Well yes, but in theory, since everyone is a pyfa warrior when talking about this shit.
---
Free Blue Loot?
---
Pyro with void is a hell of a drug
---
If you have supers on grid, perhaps you should be able to defend them with defenders or Smartbombs 
---
Focused damage bombs would also be single target, so it's not like you will whelp an entire fleet due to slowness
---
&gt;Your best bet in the current meta is to do boring unfun shit
---
sounds dope. I'd rather unsub.
---
Please, CCP is not play 4d chess here. 
---
Not everything is a conspiracym
---
You're tears are delicoious Zkillbrain player.
---
Ok so let's see what titan make as benefiot for game : 
---
\-People need to farm a lot to produce one. So they create content for hunter. 
---
\-When ou have 1 titan, basically and agree to zkill you don't need na shitons of people to kill him. 
---
\-Titan are antri N+1 and super to. Remimber the wreckign ball maybe ? No ?
---
Why people cry against titan/super :
---
\-People do'nt want loose ship , so if titan could DD they're dread they cry. And remimber you can't use focus DD on subcap. If the titan boson ... just land dread after easy win (or move outside boson range ...).
---
\-ZkillBrain don't want to farm. They want kill and kill. So they want content but they do'nt want to be the content.
---
\-They break the N+1 of subcapital and capital. 200 bomber don't win against 30 fax and 50 super ... Guess what it break the N+1 .
---

---
Dreads eating shit to damage bombs is a reasonable counter.
---
This may be the dumbest thing I've seen in this thread that wasn't the original post.
---
"just bring 5x what your enemy has" isn't balance. If that's the only way to contest that many of one ship, that one ship is unbalanced.
---
Doesn't look like they're dropping the tasty loot from what we've seen.
---
I mean I'm definitely buying this on all my omegas cause it's a great deal lol
---
Devs will def not miss us when the day comes to shut down the servers
---
&gt;proof
---
I've chosen my words above carefully- I never asked for proof, I asked for evidence.
---
Showing a video of you stealing ore from 13 retrievers who continue to drop ore off on a time schedule is more than satisfying enough evidence for me. My point is that you've posted NOTHING evidence wise other than your word.
---
Im done talking to you. Cant type english cant make coherent sentences.. Yea bye.
---
Your probably some faceless goon #642 that just got hist first titan and dosent want those meanie bad guys to kill it.
---
These bombs would kill caps thats it. Youd have more retribution farming vnis/domis till. And touching on cloky camping brings up just another issue apart of eve.
---
You bring 20B to kill 50B of ennemy.
---
Yes it's balance. 
---
After if you're problem is "we can't coutner umbrella", maybe you must see the true problem who are not ship actually. But other mechanics.
---
They just tried hitting an Ansiblex and the Fort and Standup fighters that defended it. Are they only directly attacking the Triglavian-derived structures (Ansiblex, Pharolux, Tenebrex)?
---
Have you looked in the mirror?
---
It's obvious CCP doesn't care because they sold out to another company and left the player base hanging a long time ago.
---
I don't doubt it. I stopped playing in 2014-ish and this was the first thing I came back to when picking up the game again now. A lot of things have changed for sure and I've missed those parties. And I know you've been there, so that was phrased unnecessarily hostile. I'm leaving the system atm, my work there done, but I'm sure you'll visit it again and do what you can.
---
He is just a wanna be boy, that wants to be liked by Ragewhiner, sitting on his lap like a good boy. BOS might not be at it's best, but SUAS has never RMTed and a coup has never been in the and for sure.
---
That same wanker Cephei welcomed that very same corp with open arms on PL's forums. What a bitch.
---
Whoever came up with that lie must be very salty OMEGA are leaving for TAPI.
---
&gt; eve war of ascension
---
it's a mobile game and mobile games are never not shit
---
You define certain items you want to keep an eye on - if an item runs low/high/is overpriced (depending on what your settings are) you'll see that on the website and get an eve mail. I guess you should watch the video Rihan linked for all the fearures
---
Salty about what lmao? Max projection my mab
---
I got it guys.
---
The Drifters are burning down stuff so the triglavs can't have them. Scorched earth option basicly.
---
now this is a conspiracy i can get behind
---
at least they don't timezone tank.
---
Yeah this sub is worse than their opinion on the game
---
Also looks like it requires you to fake a character sale? I'm gonna assume CCP wouldn't be happy about that.
---
Interesting, worth a tug i guess. Appreciate the info mate.
---
Remove EvEBabyMorgan from reddit.
---
a kill a day keeps the purge away
---
Unlike EVE, of course.
---
To be fair, I was absent from The Might Beans for roughly a month and a half. Those fleets could have taken place then, when we were very new and trying to establish some connections in J-Space. I'm genuinely not trying to deny anything... I just read a lot of posts from past members, and other corps in J-Space regarding our corp, and a lot of them just aren't true from my experience. I feel like I'm just talking in circles now, but I was just curious how exactly we received all the bad reputation.
---
^^ great reference to spoudbrain right here people. Patient zero maybe? Love the english.
---
I see PL are finally starting to recruit people on their level.
---
20 drifters just jumped my gate camp lol
---
&gt; Dreads are already very powerful and costeffective comparing with super capitals, the problem is always about N+1 game
---
Except when you have a large number of supers with fax support, dreads become ineffective very fast. if you have 100 supers with fax support, 100 dreads wouldn't even make a dent. The titans would wipe the floor with them.
---
If it's dreads vs. titans with 1:1 numbers, titans will win 100% of the time. 2:1, titans still win. When you're dealing with hundreds of titans, the cost efficiency becomes irrelevant because that number of dreads stops being practical.
---
Tfw apex the child can understand the difference between "&gt;" on Reddit and 4chan but Sharo cannot differentiate beantween the two.
---
Really makes your thonkers activate
---
The weird part is, there's a 50% player drop between creating account and 1st log in.
---
I'm wondering if they will show up when the timers are up? Will there be defense fleets or will they be uncontested kills?
---
I agree
---
Sorry don’t reply to stuff on this website a lot
---
Maybe they were inspired by what happened in tribute
---
By "new" accounts I mean ones that have never used that pack before.
---
But aoe DDs are fine eh.
---
Many moons ago a new player on day one could jump into a rifter and fight alongside players who had been in the game for 10 years and still make a difference to their fleet.
---
They could mine and make enough ISK to fly that Hulk they wanted (and buy the permit for it too).
---
They could fly into a wormhole, get lucky by looting millions of ISK and then get the shakes as they narrowly avoid getting blown up by the residents.
---
They could capture the plex in FW that led the system win that caused the tide to turn.
---
They could even gank Freighters in Jita with a bunch of chill bros.
---
That was all before skill injectors and boost were a thing. That was before null sov was prioritised over ever other style of play because CCP considered it 'endgame' content. Player retention is worse now than it was 5-6 years ago despite the game being easier than ever for people to get into.
---
Maybe CCP need to stop painting the leaves green and start watering the roots?
---
Well [this Permaband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V117Ycxb6a0) song has a new meaning I guess.
---
thats cause theres 4 active people in the whole of razor
---
Its called suprise mechanics now.
---
Most likely, im a filthy renter.
---
All they are good for - lies and drama.
---
Shite website tbh
---
Being in code in 2019
---
I give you fact. This fact break all you're argumentation. so you cry and rage quit. 
---
go to test server ask someone to give you a titan. ask people who know how to play to kill you in subcap... you will be surprise.
---
I love you're tear of zkillbrain.
---
It only makes sense if it's feasible to bring that many dreads. Even goons would have a tough time trying to field 2500 dreads, assuming the game doesn't crash.
---
It's not a solution if it's not practical.
---
Miner, calm down.
---
Follow them and stream it.
---
So apparently a bot ganked you and now you've been after revenge ever since, before finally posting this whine thread.
---
Are ganker bots a thing now? I've never seen evidence that such a thing exists. I suspect that's because this claim is nonsense. You can't bot ganking. Not on one account. And definetly not on a dozen accounts.
---
The only way to cheat this sort of thing is with input broadcasting. But you've provided no evidence of this and if he has been ganking as long as you say I am sure he would have been caught by now if he was doing something that is so easy to prove.
---
I heard he caused the Drifter invasion by leaking triglav plans to the drifters and they are pre-emptively attacking to deny resources for when the triglavs finally come.
---
Damn ive been logged out of eve but even i have heard how retarded evan is.
---
Please!
---
Only if the attrition rate is below about 9%.
---
There's a difference when we know they won't get banned, so we witch hunt instead. Not only is this a last resort in sort of a "Rioting" fashion, but the botters deserve it full heartedly.
---
you can counter supers with supers pretty easy tbh
---
hahaha hes talking bout wormholes, not farming provi
---
Damn dude. You're still a baboon.
---
We've been saying that since skill injectors became a thing.
---
Something like this is what we're using, you may need to meta/faction somethings to get the fitting just right. We run our cap chain 2 up 1 down

---
You didnt even oppose with a fact. Simple that cloaky camping stops farming. Which is bullshit and yet another issue with eve as a whole. So think what you want goonie. Learn some english.
---
Maybe then we can have a constructive discussion. Also zkillbrain really. Thats even weeker than EFT warrior. Nice mash of spoudbrain or dinobrain and zkill.. Good job did you come up with it on your own?
---
i cant stream but ive been following them around and they are seriously roaming like a military entity. ive seen a bunch of structures reinforced in esotaria and deteroid. im just wondering if this is happening everywhere else
---
i think the main problem with that is that skill injector still represents skills trained 
---
the thing this post is about is basically producing SP out of thin air
---
Ok where this start from?
---
A lot of recruiters will look at your kb to see if you can pvp. If you have like 30 kills over 4 years and 200 krab losses then they wont take you. Its not that they care about the kb, they just want guys who know how to pvp
---
You guys are known as being shit by everyone in eve, not just miners.
---
Good for you!
---
We're getting real close, if not already at, CCP's final pump and dump of their revenue.  So desperate for in quarter revenue, they probably already have a date planned for shutting down the servers.  
---
First they fucked the casual player with their million SP bullshit fiasco for their anniversary.  I assume they generated above average sales for that month tricking the SP farmers that they'll receive something of greater value if they just pay for the one month.  
---
Now that the SP farmers are shutting accounts back down, waiting for their speculative profits to start rolling in, CCP has undercut their sales of SP with straight SP for cash.  Assuming most people bought PLEX to buy isk to buy skill injectors (which CCP would know) then this is gonna hurt the SP farmers by setting a price ceiling on skill injectors funded through PLEX.  
---
I can see how CCP justifies all this in their heads.  Cheap SP should attract more new players who should be able to catch up at a more affordable cost.  Thing is people dont like playing sandbox games with extremely visible "invisible hand".  
---
TL:DR  CCP is trading long term revenue for short term profits.  Eve probably wont see a 17th birthday.
---
&gt;Create a super low cost ship who easely counter titan will just remove umbrella.
---
Can you honestly not think of a decent counter to a destroyer?
---
it's easy to get evidence to support your post, instead of witch hunting
---
We may be shit, but we’re celebrating stream sniping on reddit.
---
Oh my bad, you thought this was Facebook? And the sub, world of Warcraft? Awww bless you, you sweet summer child how did you end up here? Just you hold on I'm sure we can find someone to take you by your precious uncalloused hands and escort you back to your safe space.
---
Depends on the type of the ship . And mostly what is it's bonus to . Simple ships such as the Algos will fly a shield fit , and the Vexor and such would be Armor fit and mostly  using some sort of armor plates , energized explosive membrane or a mix of other modules  . Rigs maybe an Armor Pump .. But it changes as you go up the line like Armor Hardener And or other hardeners , Adaptive Nano Membrane . Damage control is about common on most ships  .[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
[Eve Uni](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tanking) should be the first go to for anything in Eve that you want to start learning about.
---
Once you kind of understand the basics...then checking zkillboard for the ship type you're fitting is a great start. You can look through a bunch of fits and figure out how people are often fitting them. It's worth bearing in mind that lossmails are heavily stilted towards PvP fits rather than say mission running in highsec, so you'll have to take that into consideration when browsing.
---
You can check out dual universe alpha 2 starts next month.
---
Also, miner, calm down.
---
Even better, follow them and whore on whatever it is they are shooting!
---
When did this start?
---
No, that is not what the post says. The ganking is done manually, although possibly with what you call input broadcasting. I have no proof at all of that, merely suspicion. It could also be very smooth, well performed manual gameplay. The bumping and warpins are of course also completely fair and manual. The only botting I am certain of is the handling of the industrial ships, which are sometimes protected by manually flown machariels but other times, like this morning, operate on their own.
---
Wtb dank killmails, video footage and so on.

@ccp pls, let New Eden burn. Let it to be intend. PLEASE! No reimbursements!!!

Ooh yeah i still have my one bil hecate which i used to blitz lvl 4 gallente fw missions with.
---
In all seriousness I'm excited to try trig stuff out soon, but admittedly a little nervous about getting a feel for them.
---
If those werent bots I'd think its kind of okay.
---
That's the N+1 game I was speaking of
---
5 dreads vs 1 supercarrier, 5 dreads always win
---
Well, 9 days ago you asked for a reset...
---
Merry Christmas.
---
Thanks!
---
Neither have you. The amount of bipolar mood swings he has, definitely need attention by qualified personnel.
---
God, this is great. That annoying tug of war to get rid of FRT cynojammers ended. The drifters reinforce them all. Finally we can yeet supers into FRT space without annoying jammers everywhere. 10/10
---
If defenders are effective as a counter they will certainly be used. Destroyer alts would basically be a requirement like Fax currently is. The blob basically gets bigger. 
---
Id prefer to see something similar to the doomsday in the emperyan age trailer. Subs setting up a crazy 50 man cap chain to shoot a single target DD.
---
The true hero of New Eden.
---
jUsT bRiNg mOrE sUpErS LOLOLOL
---
I do think that focused damage bombs could be useful, especially since they're countered by defender destroyers (actually useful subcaps) and smartbombs.
---
I'M SORRY I TRIED TO BLUE THE TRIGLAVIANS, DINO+DRIFTERS NEW FOREVER FRIENDS PLZ STOP
---
BDO is not a full loot PVP game.
---
That depends, does the titan have even a single fax backing him up? If so, those 5 dreads might as well self destruct.
---
It is the great cleansing, Bob is building an Ark and only the chosen few will survive.
---
:tinfoil:
---
&gt; you can't fix stupid
---
Indeed, and your posts prove it.
---
I genuinely thought that you were some random redditboy creating a ccp named account to make ccp look dumb before being modded out but you’re actually from ccp and failing to see the point. Color me surprised.
---
Well it worked because I just bought it.
---
No, they're hitting the Frat staging keepstar too.
---
I'll wait.
---
ya when i brushed my teeth this morning, why do you ask?
---
Drifters just RFd the Frat U69 Keepstar in Detorid. I shit you not.
---
Drifters vs Triglav with us caught in the middle?  
---
Interesting...
---
Hmm... Maybe they were using it to defend one of those strctures? Or are in proximity of one? Either way, that's amazing.
---
Nah u.
---
u seem salty lol
---
Just a warning... Be sure to report your scoops and findings to CCP lest you get implicated in this action.
---
I see your reddit posting is on a par with codes elite seven day old venture kills.
---
And another thing, a dozen gankers is easily within the realm of what's humanly possible.
---
they just RF'd a Frat Keepstar. The RATS FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE BOTS. 
---
I HEAR THEIR WARCALL!
---
years ago there were some channels but salvage/loot value has fallen to the point it's not really worth doing.  Also there's no where near as many mission runners to support a bunch of salvagers.  Also the people that do mission tend to blitz rather than full clear so there aren't that many wrecks generated in most missions. 
---
if you want to run missions the official eve forums have some pretty good info on that and there's a handful of people that respond pretty frequently to questions. Warning a few of them are pedantic as fuck, or just kinda out there, but usually it goes well.
---
This is my point. It's exactly the same. When you skill.inject you haven't spent anytime training the SP is instantly there. So what's the difference in buying it and its instantly there.. the only actually difference is you press a button to inject it...
---
Everybody is blue to TAPI, but that doesn't mean everybody blued back.
---
They seem to care more then most tbh, Have you seen how many times a tribute structure count has been posted in the last week or so? by comparison I think I have seen one tally of how many goon idiots are feeding krab supers and rorqs and a couple of BRs of actually interesting things in lowsec and Provi.
---
Yup but... we know
---
Thank you. I am actually not entirely sure how to report to CCP besides using the ingame bot report function. I'd like to provide them some more info than just adding to the pile of bot reports I assume they get liberally. Just came back to the game from a long break
---
tad late tot he comments but,  
---
I HIGHLY recommend an assault frigate for tackle. They are almost as fast as interceptors, but let you actually hold the target down until backup can get there. They are way easier to fly.  
---
In a lot of small gangs I fly around with, interceptors get pushed off field or killed before we can land.
---
Miner, if you don’t calm down I’ll have no choice but to add you to the red pen list. Sadly once your added your rate for a mining permit triples. Once you’re added it can not be undone.
---
his peers.
---
Do you not know about the 'jump, activate prop mod' thing?
---
Seems like EvE is dying and this is CCPs final act
---
When sov warfare and shitadels are so tedious and nobody's left to bash structures, that CCP replaces players with drifters.
---
Aye matey come out of high sec and try your role playing
---
Found this wasn't posted yet and decided to do it myself. While I'm glad the Imicus and Atron are getting a rework I'm not really a fan of how they're making the latter symmetrical. I *like* the asymmetry in EVE ships!
---
The Thorax redesign is just...I don't know. It looks cool enough but I don't think the ship really needs it. I think it would be better if the two models CCP picked were used for the Phobos and Deimos while they left the Thorax as-is.
---
Someone has to do it (structures bashing). Players no longer can.
---
Frankly, I'm disappointed in the EVE community's reaction when it comes to Evan Mclean.
---
He has shown us clear signs of being mentally disabled, including: 
---
* His almost clockwork welping of every ship he gets his hands on.
---
* The large amount of real money he's clearly throwing away to do this in a relatively short time span.
---
* His overall unkept outward appearance on stream.
---
* Some of the frankly weird comments that he's made. 
---
Having seen similar behavior within my immediate family; however, through a different outlet, I really hope he is seeking help from those who truly care about his well being.
---
You do gods work. Kill all the miners in game
---
This is utterly hilarious and if intentional I fucking applaud CCP.  More of this please!  Let the drifters be the space white walkers and force the realm of shitposters to unite to combat them.
---
Every multibox mining fleet in Hi-Sec space gets called a botter, even when evidence is often to the contrary. It's fun to join in with the accusations sometimes just to troll the miner if he gets defensive. However, even though it's hilarious, since the the player is responding then it's not likely to be a bot.
---
Why? In high sec I get to bask in the glory of James 315.
---
"jUsT bRiNg mOrE sUpErS LOLOLOL"
---
I appreciate your comedy. However, what you've outlined appears to be the common "Just bring capitals, n+1" response. Which is obviously not an answer to one power block having supreme control of all future fights with 1000, 2000, 3000 Titans.
---
There needs to be a counter v straight up numbers of Titans.
---
Yes yes I do
---
Praise James, brother!
---
All quiet in Horde Space. :smile:
---
How many of them? Do you have screens from the grid?
---
tell ppl to boson them pls
---
this is fucking gold
---
When you use a skill injector you get a diminishing return based on how many skill points u have, with this pack 5 bucks buys u a million skill points regardless of how many you already have.  Mush better than buying an injector
---
I’m pretty sure 18:00 is 2pm eastern
---
I have seen some serious autism back on dayz epoch days in arma 2 around bases and raids. It was cancer but fun, like eve. Maybe arma 3 exile ?
---
Please tell me it's intentional. I want this so bad
---
Maybe CCP is using the new event to break the power of the big alliances and give others the chance to gain renown and territory? It will certainly mix things up if they start demolishing TEST, Pandemic Legion, and Goonswarm. All that loot and territory fresh for the taking...
---
Except a lot of dev houses do this. Sell something blatantly overpowered or game-disrupting for a big jolt of revenue, then walk it back later so they can look like good, attentive devs. Acid test.
---
I tell you what, I challenge you to work with the idea and suggest positive balances to make it feasible.
---
Rather than nonsense like, "It's boring."
---
I don't understand how shit their idea department can be. Players exploit literally anything possible. Maybe use a group like oh I don't know... the csm to tell you it's a bad idea before implementation? Like was done for mining rorqs.... injectors....etc. just increase starting sp. And if they need to make cash on it make an initial subscription option where you buy a character with a quantity of sp. 
---
1mil for $14.95 sp for the young independent black women who don't need know skills.  5mil sp for $25.95 for that smart pirate who needs just a small edge in life to catch his break. 10mil sp for $35.95 for the casual who can't be asked to grind in today's age. And no extractors for 12 months on the newly created account. Boom problem solved

Toxicity there is not great, not terrible.

Sabre/boosh alts are already a thing. So adding another destroyer hull to that alt isn't a huge deal imo

Do Drifters read reddit? There's enough Frat flair here that I know bots do, but Drifters are another thing.

If that isn’t the name of your high sec war structure I will be highly disappointed
---
And then joined FRT
---
How many drifter dd's can an avatar tank?
---
This game is going to shit. All the people who could prevent it have left.
---
Awesome visual. Maps and territory size however, don't mean shit at this point and under this meta
---
They know you won't undock even when shot at so not worth their time
---
you really think we won't keep chasing those two alliance tags all over the map war after war?
---
Newbies don't buy sp boosts.
---
It would probably be more effective to reduce the timer for the first level of abilities for frigates, destroyes, industrials and mining frigates to a very short amount. A quicker access to the simplest form of the basic mechanics may help new player retention.
---
Or, on the first upgrade to omega only, add a non-tradeable amount of sp; maybe add it directly to a char.
---
Cut all ways out and in of delve and esoteria and gas the bees and dinos
---
Yeah, you're right. Editing my above comment.
---
All sov in highse. Is about to drop
---
everyone back to Eve Gate and fuck off in your galaxy ... shitty morons  :P
---
I'd recommend packing some Mindflood and/or Antipharmakon Aeolis along for the bash as well. Comes in handy if you've got folks that don't have good cap skills and even if you do have good cap skills you can mitigate some cap pressure from the FOB and ♦ Rats with the drugs.
---
No other game is e en close ot Eve rn.
---
Dual Universe have big plans, claim PvP will have a big role, but will too be carebear focused Space Minecraft.
---
And then, on June 26, 2019, the Drifters became sentient and chose what they would do. And the Meta. Was. Reset.  CSM 14!
---
Please stay/come visit Delve after redeployment.  If you want “contested” kills that is.  Bring a sub-cap, go after anything that will not trigger an umbrella response, wtb guy fites!!!  If you desire otherwise then it is just a case of “retard ratters” meet retard wanna-be pvpers.
---
\*sensible chuckle\*
---
Bbbbonnnnerrrr
---
Yes, I have also ganked him, or someone else botting in Wuos. I too saw him change to Skiffs.
---
Thank you, i’ll give it a go
---
There are a ton of ships and paths in this game that new players can pretty much fit right in. The ONLY reason to inject skills is to do tasks better and quicker. You can get by with the bare minimum while learning the game and finding your path. I could also argue that most people injecting are actually current players beefing up themselves or making a specific alt because they don't have the patience.
---
This is bad for the game. Denying it just shows you know nothing about the history of Eve and don't have the patience to become legend.
---
Drifters already dead to BWF standing fleet. Also already looted and salvaged.
---
bob aka IT alliance aka kenzoku after 3 reboots they folded and several joined NC/PL losing an alliance war very rarely ends in a mass quit and usually results in players getting recycled into similarly minded alliances.
---
As the beneficiary of this mistake, I can confirm that there was nothing shady about it. It was a straight fuck-up.
---
More than pl lmao
---
This is the first “TAPI blue doughnut” joke that actually made me laugh.

Thanks for putting some effort in.

No, it wasnt. They payed a shit ton of money they wont be getting back if EVE burns down any time soon. Half a billion, come on...
---
Fuck, I either haven't been playing enough Eve or reading too much about the upcoming Ryzen release, because I was actually confused for a minute about how any of this relates to Intel.
---
3 was big,  back when the galaxy pack sales were going full blast I stocked up on 800m-1b MPTC and ~3m plex.   I was only doing 8 characters, can only imagine how much the big farmers stocked up. Also never sold any of that SP used most of it with that booster from the one event to inject my high SP characters.  Oh and all those characters have a ~7mil sp industry base so they can build/invent stuff.
---
What supers need is to not be oppressive against subcaps. Your idea is stupide for many reason explained in other comments
---
If he got the whole belts worth its guesstimate 700+900 mill
---
Currently they are RF'ing FRAT's KS. More like gas the pandas
---
Maybe that's the whole point, now you have to be able to field enough people to defend against drifters in your timezone.
---
FC what's the difference between something that has been acquired through time in game and something that comes out of nothing?
---
SP was/is capped by the amount players can generate with time. There was obviously always an inflation in SP but the rate was capped by player count, now you just buy SP out of nothing which screams credit card warrior, this is the first step towards p2w, skillU left at the right time.
---
6/26 has a much better ring to it tbh
---
CSM 14!!!
---
Yup. Bunch of shit in detorid (that I know of) has been hit. Apparently they RFd a keepstar but i that was only 1 report
---
Hopefully you get meteored out of existance
---
I had an alpha in an alliance that was damn happy to have my frig watching a gate and tackling stragglers, rather than pounding a station in some alliance fit super ship. Bottom line there are roles for new players to perform. They shouldn't be jumping right into Marauders. Skill injectors take away the sweat and tears many need to really love this game. Buying years and injecting them is what really shallowed out this game.
---
Please point out the effort part
---
Not a single Frat member on CSM 14, Frat Keepstar RFd by NPCs, COINCIDENCE?!?!?!?! probably.
---
I would agree with you if there were any NCPL structures left to hit. So I am just going to assume it is because of that and not :tinfoil: :ccp: devs.
---
The heroes we deserve.
---
Holy shit I never realised that is also what the Ark could be about. It kinda fits in with the "testing grounds" and shit. The worthy ones get in.

Please be aware that this is working as intended.

Thanks for understanding. -GM Telomer

A single retriever with max skills and boosts pulls in 40/45 mill a hour closer to 70mill/h

Does anybody have any info from CCP?
---
Just Lower ehp of supers/titans, by roughly 20%.
---
Increase dreads anti capital gun dmg by 5-15% and lower T2 gun prices by 20-40%.

They're upset they are being ignored for their Triglavian kin.
---
Back in my day..... you started with 600k SP and you were grateful.  And you had to raise your attributes with learning skills.  You had to learn to learn.  Your first two weeks in eve were spent training that lol.
---
wait, I thought test rebranded as tapi to annoy us so I kept calling them test?
---
You might be onto something unless someone can confirm an attack without relevant structures on grid?
---
wormholes are the last nomadic lifestyle my friend

Just send it to [blackhole@ccpgames.com](mailto:blackhole@ccpgames.com) or [devnull@ccpgames.com](mailto:devnull@ccpgames.com) \- both will lead to the same result (absolutely nothing).
---
The irony of calling my ideas stupid.
---
Keep talking like that but more importantly keep playing the game like that...say it after me “my ships are not made from minerals, my ships are not made from minerals”.
---
Am I a bad person if I never liked the Raven battleship model? 
---
It overall just looks so weird...
---
The proteus isn’t bad but it’s the worse of the4 right now. My vote goes to Loki or legion as the best ones.

Congratulations, now dreads are super effective against subcaps in numbers (even more so now).

Still capital ships online. Still broken.

so what would you do? call him mentally disabled instead of letting him do his thing and have fun?

Since all the pvp players left eve, might as well occupy ourselves somehow.

You can add Raravoss in Domain to that list.

Imagine calling that alliance that almost wins the at `plebs from low class` 😂😂😂😂
---
Ccp reads and dies a little inside with every comment, so, yes, the.drifters read /r/eve.

I was wondering wtf had happened with the Drifters... I mean, their arch enemy is fucking HS over and they are just there, completely quiete?!

First fruits of Olmeca Golds CSM?

I love the engines!!!

Takes about that much SP to build a cap pilot tho..m
---
Scram, grapple, and torps? Your the tackle goofball.

It seems almost like a contest at this point. CCP is seeing how far they can troll players.

Lightshot is objectively shit though.

I’d like to point this out, but on this screenshot, you can see that in the log messages a new kind of Drifters I don’t think we met yet : Orion Tyrannos.

Oooh the good old "there would be no PvP without minerd" as if PvPiers pay their ship with PvP loot
---
Drifters attacking player structures is the most interesting thing that has happened in New Eden in the last 12 months. Good job CCP, I hope you don't fuck this up and that you make this an exciting and satisfying arc.
---
6/26*
---
The part about being blue back was the funny part that I was referencing, just in case you were actually serious and not being intentionally dense as a way of being pedantic.
---
Fight them then. 🤷‍♀️
---
Drifters are just as excited for Teamfight Tactics as we are, apparently.
---
CCP is finally taking action against botters by spawning in the one thing that the bots can't predict: NPCs.
---
I'm suggesting removal.
---
Good it's starting.
---
Legacy doesnt own Omist or Feythabolis. TEST owns both. Who said GotG is allies with Legacy?
---
Confirmed from Vily.
---
Not A Bug.
---
Which makes sense, It is likely the start of Chapter 2 of invasions.
---
He's irrelevant and mad about it to boot. What can you do?
---
Sad part is you might be right.
---
They should go specifically after facilities making big toys for alliance blocks... just sayin...
---
Nah, supers already got nerfed into oblivion with all the tracking nerfs because retards like you can't pilot your ship or shoot the fighters. Anyways, your suggestion is shit thanks for posting it.
---
Ok, I’ll try to be clearer so you can understand because I certainly can’t understand your response.  The reason goons own an overwhelming super capital force is because...miners.  I’m trying to figure out if you are saying something like “mining is nothing to be proud of, just buy your ships with pvp loot’” or well... I don’t see an alternative to that interpretation.  So yeah, shit has changed, if you have industry, which includes those dirty miners you talked about, you win.
---
mine only cost 300m wtf
---
No, it's not goon logic, it's the way the game works you retard
---
Just harvesting my daily quota. 
---
After 16 years the game is quite dull so I started to play reddit instead. I have to harvest -50 karma a day (every day) or I have to suck Hilmar off for another round of fixes on the game he loves and plays so much.
---
I used to be better at it but honestly now the population here is so fucking ccp_smoothbrain that they don't even think what they vote and just screw up my metrics with useless up votes based on zero outrage. 
---
Game really is fuckin' dead.
---
If this were all real and lore and shit I would 100% fly my Nyx into J4M4 and take the entire system with me.
---
All looks great! whats with the bus/train thing? random npcs to make space look busy?
---
No before Pandas go extinct. Drifters just RF'd their staging KS. No one even maned it.
---
Thanks for posting your in depth rebuttal.
---
lightSHIT
---
whoa calm down brother
---
I had to Google it.... Says we are both right??!
---
Instead of giving players free shit in hopes they stay in the game why dont we use something that CCP themselves have said increase the likeliness a player will continue to play and have PROPER corporation and alliance recruitment tool inside the agency. Make that shit pop up on the screen and present that option to the player and let the player base sort them out. You could even allow corporations the option to pay for higher priority on the list or something.
---
Why was nobody complaining this hard when NCPL was deploying the wrecking ball? :thinking:
---
More goon logic. The only way to counter anything is bring more of said thing.
---
You're terrible at this.
---
We’re a bit busy at the moment, I’m sure we’ll go back to fighting them once goons go home
---
You really think a change of leadership would make a difference? Lol
---
Super vs Titan... Super wins? Are you fucking high?
---
I always wonder what kind of idiots still cry about supes being oppressive after all the nerfs they've received. Apparently it's people like you who have never even flown one and dont know how vulnerable they are lmao.
---
Please stay out of the discussion if you dont know what you're discussing ty.
---
How do you probe effectively?
---
Idk, I think it will. I injected into a t3 when I was still fairly new so I could fly in the big fleets and do fun things. Had I been completely unable to contribute to those fleets I don't know if I would have stuck around back then.
---
I've been suggesting capitals are bad for the game since day 1. But nice try.
---
&gt;relying on NPCs because the most battle hardened alliance in the game can't get it done
---
XD
---
TEST and Goons will probably find a way to blue the drifters soon though
---
Come back for what?
---
&gt;  just in case you were actually serious and not being intentionally dense as a way of being pedantic.
---
This is eve. The latter is likely.
---
Kopo is a good man
---
Eh, I feel where you’re coming from but I don’t think it’s all as bad as that.  We’re coming upon an era of truly nutty breakthroughs and advancements in how the game and server performs and hopefully what I saw from CCP at Eve
---
North seemed pretty promising insofar as their view of the state of the game.  I mean, they understand (I feel) most of the major issues that the game faces.
---
The doom and gloom is pretty thick, but I think that we’ll see our game do well in the next few years.
---
Of course, I could be very wrong, but that’s just, like, my opinion, man.
---
Well, I'll put one towards your harvest. Best of luck meeting your quota!
---
what loot? asset safety.
---
It's a fine opinion. But until then rabble rabble rabble. Feed me your downvotes.
---
Daaamn!!!!!
---
&gt; all of my enemies are mercenaries all of my allies are friends
---
Ok friend
---
Yes, it was rhetorical, friend.
---
You shouldn’t upvote or downvote based on whether people agree with you or not.

My comment was about his flair he has had a while not his img hoster.

Man too bad asset safety is a thing and can just send it to a structure in the same system after 4 days

I can take your two last messages, directly copy paste them back at you and they will be the perfect response to everything you wrote. Won't need to change a single word, it fits perfectly. Hence the irony. As long as you are not deluded to a degree to not see it yourself, it is really good. Otherwise just sad. Appreciate 1984 reference as well.
---
(&gt;*_*)&gt; DRIFTERS TAKE MY ENERGY (&gt;*_*)&gt;
---
**SPOILERS ENSUE FOR GOT**
---
&gt; Let the drifters be the space white walkers and force the realm of shitposters to unite to combat them.
---
Did you not even watch the final season? Only a small portion of Daenarys army + part of The Black, the northmen, and the freefolk fought against the white walkers, most of the southern kingdoms did not. Additionally, the token defenders were almost all summarily slaughtered biding time for the ice king to saunter in, and die to a simple weapon drop and stab after Arya got catapulted (presumably she jumped, but noone is believing she made that jump) at him, ending the entire affair. 
---
If the drifters can be defeated that easily, by only a fraction of the forces they seek to destroy, with their entire war hinged on one single ship or person, **no fucking thanks.** The white walkers turned out to be trash.
---
Well there are 2 numbers. The new players registering every day and the new players who stay in game activel longer than lets say 2 weeks. The first one is quite big. The second one is very lov. Talking around 100 at most
---
So was SkyNet
---
i saw quite some people use pvp(ish) fit BSs for the missions to add some "spice" but now that they are tier 1 theres barely anything to hunt

Godspeed CCP

Didn't init do similar the last time NC. went after them?

After goons stopped coming to help, init stopped forming and NC. took the space.

---
That is pure brilliance right there. Ccp decides to copy the goon model and glass all of null.
---
Except I didn't say that anything you said was propaganda, chanting it like a mantra to protect my brain like thinking of a brick wall like in Village of the Damned. I just thought you were wrong.
---
Well how do you deal with yours?
---
This man is delusional, take him to the infirmary
---
Not really abuse since you are paying for it
---
CCP is selling SP since 2015. SP farms are just an intermediate step.
---
Let all the devs that have had to put up with player shit for the last x amount of years get to lead NPC fleets to destroy it all and farm salty tears. It's a great way to go out....
---
With the same five generic adverts for the same five generic null groups? Yeah that'll help.
---
That's the Drifter Cruiser.
---
That's adorable
---
Your day one might defer from the rest of the eve player base, your idea is nether good nor original and you're only complaining because you and your alliance's ability to deter a large amount of capital ships has plateaued.
---
It's close to impossible to counter 1000 eagles too, I don't see anyone coming up with ideas to counter those.
---
the real question is, what are you gonna do differently next time to make us care?
---
solo t3cs used to be able to tackle carriers before the nerf, i'm really not worried about one battleship lol
---
Sov Null needs a massive shakeup. Thousands of systems owned by so few. If this is CCP intervening in that in a risky way, I applaud them. We need this for the health of the game.
---
I implore anyone to look at this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyQOhZYRswc
---
Many of the years in this graphic were prime PvP times. Coalitions didn't exist, and a lot of these groups were not far from neuts for roaming. As a small ganger back then, it was an amazing time to roam and get fights. Space was populated, and wasn't impossible to conquer. Hell I remember ninja putting up a tower in some back water Geminate system for months before it was noticed.
---
Good luck CCP, I hope this event is successful in whatever you wish to achieve for the betterment of the game.
---
isnt this your chance at being even more important within the federation though? those structures arent gonna replace themselves...

The sad part is that you're mentally deficient. You took bait faster than TEST blues a new alliance.

If you have ever talked to Evan... he is a good dude and human being. Regardless of the myth and legends about him, he plays EvE the way he wants. So, if he wants to welp caps and supers then so be it. Does it fuck up you having fun? No?.... so leave him to do his thing and stop wishing you could do the same and just do it. Be Evan unless you are too much of a pansy.
---
Pandemic Horde is here. Geminate is being hit as well
---
Well he is an eve player farming for a Titan. What else is a guy to do?
---
I'm not talking about then. I'm talking about today. Test's existential threat has long since passed.
---
A massive problem with the game you kinda glance over is this super capital proliferation.
---
It's not possible to contest the current Imperium due to the sheer number of pilots/supercaps, so the logical way to play is to avoid all conflict and krab until you have enough to contest. Which is what the Imperium itself has done for many years, even pre-WWB.
---
The game is in a never ending spiral of krabbing and people who don't enjoy this (most of the competent pvp fcs) or groups who "fail to adapt" as the imperium calls them get bored and leave.
---
Pro-tip, you could do this already with other packs and deals too, nothing new.
---
I am too lazy to even run the math because off the top of my head it is less SP/PLEX than simply being Omega is.
---
Over/under on the OP being a wormholer btw?
---
Drifters = CCP military police.
---
too bad there are no structures left in Tribute for them to bash.
---
Good morning.

Apart from cost, is there any reason not to put a secondary character in a Skiff for salvaging?
---
Thank you.
---
Not sure, I edited it with the soundcloud. there's a couple it probably could be, but...
---
Fun music choices, cool fights :)
---
Sheep
---
Tackle, yes. But the covops, nullified, dps fit solo t3cs that currently are popular won’t be enough to take on a battleship
---
Armor hardeners provide the biggest damage resistance bonuses. But each module only produces one kind of damage resistance and it costs capacitor to maintain them. 
---
Armor repairers should be self explanatory: they heal your armor hp.
---
Energized plating these are your armor bread and butter damage resistance mods. The adaptive provides some of all kinds of damage resistance or you can opt for versions that give one kind of damage resistance but gives more of it. They do not require capacitor like hardners but don't give as much damage resistance either.
---
layered plating: these don't really have a use. They increase your armor hp by a % of your max. But the %s are so small that they aren't really worth fitting.
---
nano plating: these are like energized platings, but they cost no cpu fitting either. They give less damage resistance than energized plating but if you don't have the cpu to spare for an energized plating you could consider a nano plating if you want more damage resistance. 
---
damage controls: These modules give you shield armor and hull damage resistance. After your armor hp is depleted your hull hp will burn fast possibly too fast for you to get healed from your armor repairer if you don't have one of these. You don't want to fly without one even in a shield ship unless you know what you're doing for sure.
---
Oddity? Similar stuff happens in many ice systems. I have mined ice for only 1 year in remote systems, but even there i noticed fleets with bot-like behaviour (active \~16h every day, even holidays and little to no laser downtime). I reported them of course and most fleets disappeared after a few months. I dont know if they moved to another system or got banned by CCP.
---
It's really just practice once you have the skills trained up.  But most serious WH residents have a dedicated probing alt.  Mine had perfect scanning skills, a Virtue clone, and a covops set up for max scan strength.  I could one-pass just about any anomaly when I was at my best.  And you can use a narrowed D scan cone to localize the target, then one-pass them with combat probes.  With a little luck, they never have a chance to see them unless they hit d scan that very second.
---
Well it's some of the most fittingly ominous music I've ever heard and I love it to death.
---
Sure, lets just add a level 4 mission running destoryer too, with a salvage bonus and 2000 dps.
---

---
I think in the grand scheme of things. Super/Titan proliferation is a bigger issue than some hisec carebears.

according to whose rules?

CCP has stated that it's for new players only, so that implies newer players shouldn't utilize it

How do command bursts work when you have ships with varying bonuses on field  (for example t1 BCs and a command ship)? Will the burst providing the best bonus override the others, or will only the first burst apply and the rest do nothing ?

The fact that the freighter just sat there while they churned away and none of the miner reacted screams to me its a bot setup, you should definitely be reporting this and doing some recording as evidence. At least that way we can time how long it takes for ccp to ban the dude

Yeah, its usually ISD New Eden Correspondents who make a lot of the lore. Good on them if I'm being 100% honest.

---
Huh?

Where's the run away button?
---
Yea, that’s why I’d like to give tackling a go )
---

at this point the drifters are bringing tackle. Also nice print and art work!

Holy shit, this is amazing, if they actually come back for the other timers and kill the undefended stuff then CCP i love you

---
That explains all the ships perfectly for a new guy like me, there should be a page in game with descriptions like this! Thanks.
---
oh, yeah, that's what i've been talking about the whole time - solo tackle t3cs

not like a solo covert loki or proteus, more like an xlasb tengu
---
Careful you'll summon him
---
They're bashing our keepstar!
---
Thanks, that confused me a little
---
Please clear hisec too!
---
I don't disagree :)
---
Christ, CCP. I'm as anti-citadel as the next guy but having player structures reinforced (to then potentially be destroyed) by NPCs is bullshit.  Especially in the case of extremely key strategic things like jammers and JBs that go offline after a single ref cycle.
---

Everyone has been hugely helpful, today has been one of learning for me, and I feel like I love the game already. Looking forward to getting stuck in, thanks!

I do like the beefy imicus redesign....the atron wing variations look interesting.....the thorax redesign looks too elongated...although i like the different shapes for hac/hic etc
---
Just an example, based on my own experience: a complete field of blue ice typically yields about 2400 blocks of ice. A block of ice (compressed) is worth anywhere from 200k to 250k lately. So that's roughly a half-billion per field. The ice respawns on a set timer from when the last block is mined (except for when this occurs just before downtime, then it gets a bit muddled). A fleet of 20 barges with an orca for boosts and dedicated hauling can clear one of these fields in a little under an hour - with the current timer mechanics this fleet could do this 4-5 times a day in a system with one field (some systems have two, and I've heard rumours of a system with 3 but not seen it with mine own eyes).
---
&gt; Do Drifters read reddit?
---
Well it's supposedly just a nickname that indicate the plane's role, which is a divebomber. In itself that doesn't mean that the word shouldn't be used, as it's 'nazism.'
---
Planes used engines from BMW, Porsche made tanks. With one of them even being nicknamed Ferdinand in some cases, taken from the tank's designer, Ferdinand Porsche.
---
you jinxed it
---
HELL YES
---
You gotta stop drinking your own kool-aid mate; this was always the problem with you.
---
Ok so nothing is truly like EVE hence why we're all still playing this dumpster fire.
---
Theres a few more casual games that will get that itch.
---
X3 is older but has the same kind of sandbox elements as EVE and can be quite immersive. 
---
Rebel galaxy is far more casual and is really a console port but is a few hours good fun. 
---
If you just want hardcore rpg and no spaceships, give Kenshi a try. Can be brutal if you play honestly.
---
How Eve Online is solving it is New Player Problem
---
CCP **NEVER** marketed EVE as F2P. That was entirely a misrepresentation from the so called "gaming media".
---
Also T2 transversal bulkheads
---
people do talk with him about it but apparently he's still cool with it and as long as he has that pile of money who is CCP to argue?
---
TEST Alliance was in negotiations with *Triglavians* to establish 'blue' relations. We are coming for Esoteria.
---
Saw a couple of em earlier in Delve
---
Too late. We are coming for Esoteria.
---
Considering the numbers you expected what exactly?
---
This one sounds like he wants to learn. We should engulf him.
---
None? They would only do the initial ref which doesn't shut down anything.
---
yeah man, i really hope they go hardcore loss with this one, rather than just making it some soft lore shit
---
Were they webbing the Keepstar?
---
They reinforced a frat keepstar so maybe
---
It hasn't really fixed the exploit though

Drifters don't have to worry about rebuilding a fleet, they respawn infinitely at no loss.

Sure it's harder. But it's the same content.... just harder... I have no issues with grinding (see maxed runescape) but it doesn't really feel like you're working towards anything in WoW, since I can't do mythic raids (I'll accept that) and accepting that there is no ceiling, it just feels like a treadmill that really gets you nowhere.

I dunno, WoW progression just isn't rewarding past doing everything once already.

I have a feeling we're going to be collectively allied, at least in an enemy of my enemy is my friend sense, with the Triglavians before this is all said and done.  That station video they sent a little while spelled out who was their enemies, and extended an olive branch of sorts to capsuleers who 'proved themselves'.
---
How about your Molok? :P
---
Oh shit they talk now

---
Very nice Auraus, good content, well explained with just enough depth.
---
I would cut down the intro but I get that it was your first run. Keep it up.
---
The reason why I dislike it is that it goes against the core intention of early EVE, which was to have everything (barring access to the game) made and controlled by players. That's why I see this as different to skill trading, that was adding another aspect to the economy, whilst also allowing CCP to make money - It's a win-win for everyone.
---
This is CCP taking a step back from the vision of a player controlled economy, and doing it in the name of "new players", whilst not actually doing anything to help new players. If this was for new player retention, it wouldn't be something you paid for, they'd just bake the SP into a new character. 
---
This is them just making a pretty blatant cash grab.
---
CCP has stated that it's for new players only, so that implies older players shouldn't utilize it
---
wonder if the drifters will form for the next timer though
---
it's about as bullshit as a "random" incursion spawning in the constellation of a final timer for a staging structure
---
which has happened more than once
---
like christ ccp is there no way you could just put a hold on incursion spawns in constellations with node rf requests in?
---
Roughly two years ago drifters invaded Amarr space
---
And that ended pretty, unspectacularily
---
What does this post actually have to do with anything lol did I just get flummoxed by a bot
---
I like this idea actually.
---
lol that made me chuckle
---
I wouldn't be surprised if their appearance wasn't them giving us the opportunity to "prove the direction of our flow" - sparring with us a bit to see if we're worthy allies.
---
I started playing a lot less.
---
After the last ten years of lore events all just fizzled out or didn't affect 99.9% of players, this is _finally_ getting interesting.
---
So its fine when you have the biggest super fleet in the game but now that you dont because goons saw the meta shift  but you missed it now suddenly super numbers are a problem
---

It would be cool to see an “enders game” scenario. Group of the best take out the heart of the enemy type of thing.

Lmao, ive been playing eve for 10 years dude. Everyone like you and me who would play eve is already doing so. It's just not sustainable. No players is worse for the game than injectors or plex or anything else, and the fact of the matter is that most players quit the game within a week or two, because its fucking BORING.
---
EVE is a game. You don't get to justify "nut up or shut up" or any fucking /lewronggenration shit. If it's only fun for the bittervets, the game will eventually die out. CCP has to do something to make the game interesting in both the long and short term, and they should shortcut new players as far up the skilltree as it fucking takes to let them see how engaging and cool this game really is.

---
This has not aged well.
---
Id draw the line at a t1 battlecruiser, not a fucking marauder. Marauders are shit anyways. Almost every alliance has a battlecruiser doctrine, They can be used to do pretty much any middling pve content, and are relatively cheap.
---
Alphas can already do this for "free" but it takes weeks of training. In this time basically every new player gets fucking bored and quit. You are literally the minority. Your sweat and tears should not justify the boredom and inactivity of other players that will eventually kill this game.
---
The time of drifting hath come.
---
&gt; It's not like incursions, we're not killing the arc.
---
That doesn't contradict my statement though.  You're assuming that the destruction of the arc is what they'd consider a pass.  It may not be.  Might just be as simple as "let's see how they fight".
---
  IMHO this is a purely story arc thing, with actual capsuleer performance being secondary to the overall narrative.  I have a feeling the Triglavian invasion is basically a cut scene that's going to play out the same way regardless of what we do.
---
You'd still probably get better damage on the VNI with a Loki than you would with the blaster Proteus because of the Proteus' poor damage application
---
I suppose you reap what you sow sometimes.
---
Oh I can agree thats why titans are an issue from my prespective. They are power creep even more so with the range of buffs theyve had from tracking to aoe DDs.
---
Why rorquals are an issue.. Why fighters are an issue. Like this is why we need something cheaper and more cost/skill effective than a dread to kill caps.. Im not saying the bomb dmg is so high it kills everything aoe style. I believe op said focused bombs which is more like a guided torpedo to a single cap this concept would be GREAT for eve imho. Currently you cant deal with a titan force unless you have one of your own of equal size. If you could actually drop stealth bombers and DO SOMETHING to a cap that at the very least gives large alliance a reason to fight with less numbers than MAX TITANS GOGOGO..
---
I see your point but I dont see how it applies to something that is ment to deal with the other things that have been effected by power creep over the years.. They would just be another stealth bomber with a way smaller engagement profile. Like buffing dreads to be better against titans is closer to traditional powercreep than adding a new ship designed to kill caps.
---
Haven't played EVE in years. Can someone fill me in on what's going on?
---
Finally this ship has a porpoise
---
I expected what happened. No surprise really to most goons. They just like to see you post basically what you did, and then laugh about it while enjoying each other's company.

Okay so you're going to ignore my biggest points and just try to argue semantics? Fine.

It used audio from our Lore Panel. Hearing my voice in a Fanfest video was a bit distracting.

it´s almost like the biggest super fleet is kind of what makes you win by default to the point where you might as well not play. boggles the mind that it took you 200 IQ Eve players 10 years to figure that shit out.
---
And scrammed lol

Point on keepstar.
---
God I wish they would wipe the capsuleer scum out... or at the very least try hard
---
While joining a player corporation is great for retention in general I'm not sure funneling every single new player into one of four giant null block "new player" corps has actually been particularly great for the games health.
---
This trailer is actually pretty decent. Not as good as This is Eve (and associated This is really Eve), but very decent.
---
There is a line Astra in sh1 that comes out in 5 days . Maybe that's where the drifters deployed from, and can use jump drives with no fatty ghey, and can take any alliances ansiblexes.(jump bridges/cyno beacons.)

---
SP doesnt win fights or 90% of horde would never have a kill.... numbers, tactics, and correct counter win more times than sp does. Knowledge of the game is by far more advantageous than SP. Sutonia was dunking dudes with an alpha and probably 1/10th of their sp because he knows the game better than them and his engagement profile.

---
CCP better catch the wave before it overtakes them.
---
Chances are they were just camping it hoping for easy fun kills.  We do that a lot.  Going into the hole is dumb half the time because of mass limits and kitchen sink comps.
---
If someone goes in a hole we are camping, its pretty much always a prober or a roller.
---
what about before when we were relliably getting on goon super kills before mar5hy and co started doing it ?
---
When they hacked the CONCORD brodcasts they said they were waging war on the Drifters, Sansha's Nation, and the Rouge Drones.

Mass Limits and Random ship comps is 90% of the reason why.

For real though,  if this is intentional, it is a fantastic move on CCP part
---
White Walkers were beat because the special one them died.  If they were independent organisms, it would've been a different story.

They're attacking everything, including structures. So why would that be "anti bots" instead of just "attacking everything"
---
He loves to stand at the door to say boo.

Because they don't go into anomalies? At least I haven't seen them do that. They only RF structures.

---
Hey guys, Nomi from The Discourse here again. I just wanted to make everyone aware that while the Drifters ARE putting structures into reinforce, we are seeing some new stuff too!   
---
[https://i.imgur.com/r899DoM.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/r899DoM.mp4) &lt;--- Drifter fleets, while heavily damaged and lacking an overshield/doomsday are augmented by fast moving cruisers. They will typically anchor on an Apollo Tyrannos battleship class vessel. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9FuuRyZ.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/9FuuRyZ.mp4) &lt;--- Something new we've seen them doing is what I'm calling a "hunting pattern" for lack of a better word. The Battleships will warp away from the main fleet in a sphere of about 300km radius, slow boat for a moment, and warp back to the fleet. This is dangerous as they will decloak you when they land! 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/mdVG3nj.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/mdVG3nj.mp4) &lt;--- In addition to reinforcing structures, they will conduct this "hunting pattern" WHILE engaging structures. So be careful when you are casually observing! 
---
So far I've seen them warp to numerous structures for reinforce, but they seem to take breaks around the asteroid belts as well. So miners beware! 
---

Was there a recording of the 3d printing 101 presentation at Eve North?
---
Thanks. As mentioned in another thread, this is not originally my idea, but I have raised it a number of times.
---
I believe it's important there are realistic and reasonable counters to all game styles. Especially overwhelming titan force.
---
Yes but where's your videos? :(
---
Granted, this is day 1... We dont know if they'll prosecute the following timers
---
&gt; I think the issue isn't paying for SP, it's paying for SP that's being added to the game from nothing.
---
Plex is made from nothing and is arguably more valuable. Reality is, this is just the excuse players are using to have a reason to throw a fit rather than just explain why it's wrong.
---
If this is just a tester for $ to SP directly, I'm afraid I'm gone, I bought a meteor pack way back to expand to my first alt. 
---
I wanted to expand to a third. Saw the "Starter pack", and have decided to immediately **not**, do that, **at all**, just in case there is the vague misunderstanding that I in *any way* support the idea of "$ for SP". 
---
Unfortunately I won't be buying anything from the EvE store until this 'idea' passes from it's stock.
---
i apologize great drifter, are you interested in blue standings?
---
Pick between an active or passive tank first, then build your ship around increased armor or increased rep amount. There are different resist mods that can patch holes in your tank depending on your enemies damage types. Plates are for increased armor pools, while resists will aide you in taking less overall damage so your repper is more powerful per cycle. Don't forget about rigs either, you can have some trimarks (armor total), or some resist rigs if you need, but depending on active vs passive tank you may want a capacitor boost in there for cap regen.  
---
Also look at the wiki, and of course use your fitting tool to look at how things impact you.
---
Glad I could help. Was a hell of a lot of fun running all over the place lookin for em.

With access to a c4 which are hardly occupied you can do gas sites or whatever you want. From a c4 hop point you can get into c5/c6 rather easily etc. Or mine rates on the moon or do PI we made a good amount of isk in it but moved into null space. Some of the moons are 8 to 12 bill pulls per month. If you crit the holes to nothing you can pretty much rorq mine that in peace. Granted you can do that as a renter somewhere but for a small corp or person that wants to be on their own it's ok.

Flair does not check out

Noob here, watching Olmeca Gold boosh excavators.  Can you do the same with cans ?
---
Honestly, stream sniping Evan is like killing a baby duck with a bat - nothing to be proud of.
---
Wonder how the wormholers are holding up in this.
---
Wait, I think I get what this is about! This is supposed to drive down plex prices by having an alternative to skill injectors for new players. Also a cash grab but still possibly competing.
---
Our editor is currently away for a few days, so while we would love to put out a video it might be a little while before we actually get one out on Youtube!
---
oh damn this is cool
---
Everyone wants to be left alone when they're collecting ISK, but you're more likely to get a fun fight in wormholes than in null.
---
Awesome, after playing with Pyfa and reading up on bonuses / roles, I’ve decided to go slasher &gt; stiletto &gt; malediction &gt; sabre.
---
Because someone else had to train those skills and then extract them. SP gifted by CCP not included, all injectors on the market come from toons that are training. The starter pack adds SP to the game that wasn't extracted by anyone.

The jag is a great ship for heavy tackle.  If you're roaming with a ceptor pilot, they can land point in time for you to arrive, and if they're taking damage they can deagress.  Dual MASB (medium ancillary shield booster) fits are stupidly tanky on the jag while still maintaining high top speeds.  They aren't as strong for landing the initial point due to being slightly slower, having a slower warp speed, and not having the range bonus to scram and web.  Good luck getting one off of you once it latches on though.

Definitely coincidence, goon shit and apparently some NC shut got hit as well

You will have to negotiate with [Tyrannos Strategos](https://zkillboard.com/character/3019583/), honorable opponent. Unfortunately (for you) they are occupied with coordinating [conflict on multiple avenues of attack](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c5utr7/drifters_bashing/es4s2rj/) at this time.

Name checks out
---
Interestingly that July 4th is in a week. Are we fighting... for our independence? Do we have to pick a side?
---
Oh ok thanks I'll look into it.
---
It is intentional, CCP mod confirmed, and it is fantastic.
---
Now, let's see if they show up for the armor timers.
---
CCP confirmed this is working as intended. 
---
Oh boy.
---
With the changes to the VNI, would vessels does anyone recommend for taking on Nullsec rats? I'm quite happy to active rat provided the kill time is quick and it's cheap(currently hurting in ISK).
---
Hey man, listen, we can negotiate. We've got some great rental space opening up in Detorid.
---
&lt;3 TAPI
---
Even if NPCs allow for some opportunistic armor timers, shit will be fun. Something to keep players on their toes.
