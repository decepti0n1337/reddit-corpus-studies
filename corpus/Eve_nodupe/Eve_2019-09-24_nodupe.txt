I maybe shouldn't tell you this, but people who spend thousands of dollars on plex so they can be elite space warriors after they've playing for about month are extremely easy to scam.

(Time to totally screw (rolls 16 sided dice): WH and HS Incursions!)

---
There after complex research and discussions, is our new ‚Äòroadmap‚Äô.   Let‚Äôs destroy WH and HS incursion game now!
---
ho lee fuk
---
where are the screenshots
---
Ah, in which case, yes, online ‚Äòplayer‚Äô count includes alphas.
---
 (Or rather online ‚Äòaccount‚Äô count, especially in the age of ‚Äòelite‚Äô players having 13 accounts on average and many players having 2-4: consider that every Titan pilot in null is required to have a FAX alt if their own, and often a subcap alt to boot...)
---
Assuming you aren‚Äôt engaging in VM shenanigans, for alphas online ‚Äòplayer‚Äô count is actually equivalent because you can only log in one per computer at a time.
---
Hidden on the provi forums. For only true amarr believers. To know what happens when the pious exceed their capabilities
---
Haha. Fair enough. But humor is a winning thing often enough and is good to be shared.
---
You posit that the massive drop in player count could be explained as bots and accounts doing nothing but injecting isk into the game. (Please correct me if I am mischaracterizing this.)
---
What decision do you think CCP would have made if this were the case? Do you think that CCP would have removed blackout to try and bring botters, rmters, and pure-krabs back to the game?
---
Well done. o7
---
How can you kill that which never lived?
---
tl;dr alliance tells its members to make 0 reward, 0 collat courier contracts to the alliance if they need help moving. OP trades a spy alt for 137b in free stuff.
---
I just found out that there is something missing from the translation in the sreenshot. people pointed out AOM leadership relys on RMT in serenity for paying their homeloan. and they admit it for many years and Pround of it even quit their day job for it.
---
What a shock.
---
With every combat ship able to move too fast to be caught and able to kill things before help arrives
---
People are using capitals to stay alive.
---
Wow... Who would have expected that outcome?
---
*looks at username*
---
Lol...what we absolutely don‚Äôt need is more crazy changes.  
---
What we need are people to actually work the problem and not swing a machete around in a dark room and hope that only bad people get hit.   Doing random stupid things is just as likely to screw things up worse as fix them.  
---
Don‚Äôt think for a second they can‚Äôt make things worse and harder to fix, because they sure as heck can....and are.
---
Glad you enjoy it! It's a steep learning curve, but it gets easier.
---
Whilst I have to say this is a admirable haul. I can't stop fixating on the part where you spent 10 months building a backstory to get into LORDE. 
---
Nice catch though jokes aside. üëåüèª
---
This must be very familiar problem for lots of guys, nothing special.
---
There is lots of legit good and cool chinese friends individually,
---
But every big chinese group which I saw in online games do cheat and bot, also RMT a lot.
---
I try to not say shit to chinese bros cuz there is many innocent guys also
---
But It‚Äôs just like I lol‚Äôed too hard when TEST decided to blue AOM and russians while they say something like ‚Äòwar against bots‚Äô
---
Maybe TEST leaderships are very new to online games and had 0 knowledge 
---
so they had to handshake with number 1,2 botting/RMT empires?
---
What a polite way to say "circlejerk".
---
This is why I eve, good post.
---
lol, I've done some in long range Jackdaw with taking about 0 damage.
---
Give it 6 months and he'll throw his 'fuck this game, i quit' paddy then be back a few months later like every time before.
---
*coughs and points to history books*
---
I would set it up with 2 and a half skill extractors and then never touch it again
---
QFC was dead long before the blackout. 
---
FeMalogoalotatim &amp; gang were the only stabilizing element in the QFC. Soon after SR got kicked the whole region became no-man's land. 
---
It also didnt help that because of his eviction, Fem started and won a one man war against any alliances that tried to stay or occupy the space. SMA must be telling horror stories about him to new pilots. The ghost of QFC :))
---
I have some too. You show me yours and I'll show you mine üëç
---
What an absolute r/madlad
---
You got mugged.
---
Well done. Love this kind of stuff.
---
Drifter attacks
---
Remove the ability for supers to dock  or if we cant remove that without null blocks shitting up the forums make it so If they are docked CCP charges 3% of asset value a day for supers capitals. Including equipped module and the cost of ships in hangar bay. 
---
Needs to be a cost to docking. Otherwise these will stockpile forever with more being around every day.
---
I mean, email to security@ccpgames.com. It isn't hard.
---
Why?
---
For stating the truth state of the game? 
---
People can stay away from valid criticism all they want but that won't make the fundamental problems of the game go away.
---
Back to a null that is safer than high sec, without any real risk and all the rewards in the world.
---
You are indeed mischaracterising, but I should have separated my two points better for clarity: 
---
1) You and many others are talking about the ‚Äòonline players‚Äô count that the launcher/PCU statistics give as if is reflective of player count. While it may be the case that it is, due to the vast presence of multiple account owners in this game, PCU delta is amplified over any real player delta on changes. 
---
A simple example to illustrate the disconnect between PCU and people (heartbeats has been used as a metric here) might be to consider bloc Titan pilots. With their obligation to have their own FAX alt, and often a separate subcapital alt, most Titan owners represent at least 3 accounts.
---
This is not to say that I am explaining away PCU drops in their entirety (especially given anecdotally more people in my circles have returned than left, so clearly there must be more leavers to outweigh them) merely pointing out that it‚Äôs a very noisy metric.
---
2) It is unquestionable that a fraction of the account drop due to blackout was bots. There are whole regions of the game that were known to be perpetually full of (formerly VNIs, lately myrmidons or ishtars) apparently constantly dedicated to afk ratting (determined by fit) but always paying sufficient attention to local to warp to a structure or POS immediately an unknown enters local, yet fall pray to trivial log-off traps.
---
I‚Äôd also propose that given most of the null blocs has bans on ratting initially (and some for extended periods) during blackout, combined with the greater activity of hunters, many people just figured the return wasn‚Äôt worth the risk, especially after feeling the income had got worse anyway after application nerfs and respawn nerfs.
---
So to be clear, I doubt many of the missing accounts were pure krab characters (outside whatever fraction of them may or not be bots), and would expect the predominance to be ratting alts of bloc players.
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
To answer your questions about CCP‚Äôs actions briefly is hard. I don‚Äôt have much faith in their decision making surrounding (literal) investment into the game‚Äôs ecosystem and balance over the last few years. 
---
At the core of that lack of faith is my suspicion that the adage of increased return in EVE not corresponding to increased investment only held when the game was in a healthy, or at least non-stagnant place.  It doesn‚Äôt hold after leaving the game on life support with a skeleton crew, as people and expectations move ever onward.
---
The NPE experience focus they claim ironically misses some (painfully long-standing) low hanging fruit: really fundamental things like a truly useful default overview setup, and a tutorial explaining in detail the use and potential customisation of it.
---
As others, and I think you yourself, have identified, CCP has been making very low dev cost, simplistic changes to previously immutable areas of the game. The lack of nuance, effective communication (under the guise of mystery/chaos) and lack of rapid iteration and refinement is a massive problem: in player confidence in CCP, and willingness to weather a potentially negative but short lived game state, both of which I suspect further drove a drop in PCU. 
---
I don‚Äôt think CCP would deliberately attempt to reintroduce thousands of bots into the game for the plex value they represent, but without an interesting data science blog talking positively about their findings, who really knows what they found or why they reverted it when they did? Off the top of my head, a reason I‚Äôd find highly plausible, if inelegant, would be the desire to separate out the changes observed as a result of blackout and the cyno change. the simplest way being to have only one live at a time.
---
I can't read, would you mind producing an audio version?
---
Wally killed them all
---
Nobody hates eve more than r/eve
---
The best way to enjoy this game is to NEVER EVER come back to this reddit again, save to laugh at the idiots of course.
---
3% fee of hull value charged daily for docked supers. Can be offset by alliance paying increased fuel or passed onto members. Either way 3% in fuel or isk. To CCP not station owner.
---
This isn't bad because it removes Titans and the glut of minerals makes rorqual pointless as well for a while.
---
[A link to the video for those who are interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz4LpoFivCI)
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure if there was ever a point when that wasn't the case so I used cagey language to leave myself some wiggle room.
---
hold the control key and roll up on the mouse wheel, idiot.
---
[Never not link the soundboard](http://ampalmier.com/gigx4ever/)
---
No buddy. TC(the runner of CEVE) once banned a player's accounts for botting. But later that player accused TC. And on the court that guy showed his special ability of controlling 10 accounts in one time mining, so TC failed.
---
From that on the banning of botting in CEVE become really hard.
---
Everyone of us believe botting is cheating and actually some volunteers formed a group to attack the botting miners. I am a newcomer of reddit, and from the beginning I dont believe there was many Chinese haters.
---
Now I m kinda believe it. I really controlled my self not to call you RACIST.
---
And if you replace CHINA with AFRICAN, see what will happen.
---
Well... This is the first time I heard that VPN is needed for third party stuff...
---
What was his position on hands?
---
Surprised I haven't seen any mention of Querious Fight Club, there should be a healthy amount of Google-able documentation I think, for that. 
---
Some folks mentioned Code and minerbumping.com - that dude's blog, if you go all the way back to the beginning and read in reverse, is some damn fine "downtime in the office" killing material. And the Code stuff is very structured, I think it would make a very interesting shorter example of an eccentric, basically cult-like structure. That was actually the one that got me to finally do a 30 day trial once. 
---
I'm also an EVE researcher, and by that I mean I played the tutorial in 2010 and have been obsessed with EVE for free ever since.
---
I have a dream.
---
Where Avatars, Ragnaroks and alike are used as cheap, throwaway ships, like t1 frigs. Go to FW space, warp to large and wait for another titan to warp in. You DD each other's ass, GF in local. Board another one and repeat.
---
the name "fuck sinners trajectory" was too long
---
Says the baddie who doesn‚Äôt understand that was a highlight of the quote from the OP‚Äôs post. It‚Äôs okay, we understand that reddit trolls can‚Äôt read and English is hard.
---
https://youtu.be/cOJtEvpSZhM
---
I think the volume of 25% off omega emails sent by ccp to beg the return of players is a fairly clear answer to the sacrifice question, (willing to lose to some players for long term health) was kinda of a quote used on talking stations by ccp. If the drop in paying customers was acceptable to the bottom line they wouldnt have made such a offer to their customer base, that wasnt the case clearly.
---
Erm, wrong comment chief
---
They did a good change on Ventures. Hopefully more things will come, e.g. increase awards such as faction battleship blueprints or ingredients of X toy only available in FW/low sec areas.
---
[Sure thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22LXQJ3i0J8)
---
ngl I listened to 54 seconds of that
---
Fantastic work
---
Its where people that are scared of bubbles pvp
---
Unless you are flying with expensive implants in, being podded shouldn't be a problem. And as long as you are outside of nullsec/j-space, you don't need to worry about bubbles, so you can just warp your pod off as soon as your ship dies, and be safe. However, as far as I can tell trigs don't pod (https://zkillboard.com/ship/52475/), so you should be safe.
---
&gt;What's the point of frigates for pvp? Yeah they are light and fast... but webs will just slow you down and you'll be blown apart in moments.
---
The Jaguar has the tank of a cruiser, especially when fit with 3 reps. Interceptors can tackle out to well beyond normal range, and are interdiction nullified, so they make very good scouts and fast tackle. Assault frigates can sig tank very well and are very powerful (https://zkillboard.com/related/31000940/201908140200/). Frigates like the griffin, kitsune, and hyena are paper thin, but have long range and very powerful ewar for a low price, especially compared to t2 cruisers. Bombers, well, bombers are super overpowered, especially when used with command destroyers and frigate logi. Just google "stuka fleet" for some examples.
---
&gt;How about destroyers? I read they are meant for anti-frigate stuff....see the above point.
---
They're good for anti-frigate, the t3ds are all good for different things (fessors are good fleet ships, especially in wormholes, hecate is a good all in solopvp ship, jackdaw is an excellent sniper, and svipul is, well, trash), command destroyers are extremely overpowered (google "stuka fleet" or "Rage eviction" for examples), interdictors are incredibly useful, and t1 dessies like the catalyst are good for hisec ganking.
---
&gt;I'm hyper interested in flying a dreadnought. The idea of attaching turrets the size of small towns and decimating structures brings a smile to my face. Are they actually useful in the long game or are they kinda dumb?
---
If you don't know what you're doing, and fly expensive stuff, you will 100% lose it in an embarrassing way. Don't skill inject into capitals, or even battleships, just fly small stuff (cruisers and down) until you really get the hang of the game. I can give you example after example of morons who thought they could pay money, get into the most expensive ships, and then be good. Spoiler alert, they didn't do much except feed.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/95347176/
---
That guy, for example, has lost about $1700 worth of ships. He killed $0.61 worth. If you try to inject into capitals, you will end up as a very similar killmail, and probably ragequit eve. Dreads are a fine long term goal, just don't rush it.
---
Old drone lands say not reproc to build stuff, so many minerals were farmed by bots when drones dropped them
---
Follow that drain pipe of a thought for a bit, what after titans are removed "Reeee Supers are bad proliferation kill the supers" removed.... "Reee all you big bad people make carrier an dreads much proliferation bad..." etc etc you get the idea each removal will refocus to the most optimal iteration its common sense for anyone. You could remove it all the way no capitals at all, an god love it imagine battle ship proliferation with the amount of titan minnerals refunded!!! In that sense its no easy fix, in eves defence it still needs end game items an titans were/are that content.
---
Our corp was friendly with Fatal, and we came into Querious while still in TNT to assist with the intent to join the QFC so we could PVP somewhere other than hisec. When we left there was apparently bitterness and distress on the part of TNT related to our departure (odd, since the corp left with nothing but friendly goodbyes, answered by accusations of elitism and "leet pvp", I left TNT that very night to join them). Our CEO was blacklisted for predictably asinine reasons no sane person believes, and we were told to leave after engaging NSH several times in subs and caps before their own departure from the area. We went to Impass and there we remain, leaving the QFC to rot where we found it. Fatal as a corp is dead. I got a notice that some stuff that was in their fort was sent to asset safety last week. Good dudes, just not active or effectual.
---
Oh shit, a thousand apologies lol I'm checking now!
---
Ez
---
Yes, I completely, feel CCP knew of the idea. They have probably been working on this for a while (undetermined amount of time for CCP could be years). But for sure, they have had their fingers on the button, waiting for Hilmars blessing. I honestly think they thought it would be received by more and it wasn't.
---
I kinda doubt OP would be in a position to know what happened there after the fact.
---
fucking well done! dude 
---
but hate u as well

roughly translate into 250b isk, not that much really but at least something more creditable then some random frat botter says something in a botting group  
---
edit. considering its Wc guy "claiming" he sell 2T to Aom, surely it won't be hard for them to show some actual proofs and get AOM banned. Without any evidence provided any accusation are pretty much just slanders which  I'm sure people have see plenty during election period
---
Well, I feel like there's actually a decent overlap between the player bases of eve and ARMA, I've met a lot of eve players on ARMA and vice versa. I also just think the pacing, scale, complexities and everything of ARMA kinda matches the way eve plays also. It's mostly a game of patience and planning that culminates into a bunch of big explosions. I dunno.
---
Am I the only one who would love to see this as a proper tournament?
---
The only thing it needs is a way to actively pass/shoot the ball. Right now, it's more of a CTF system than a ball sport.
---
Please tell me the last time they contributed to the enjoyment of other players by owning multiple titans
---
Industry gets isk, and people have a hard time managing multiple Titans so they become KMs. Literally what happened in 1dq a couple weeks ago
---
This is why you shouldn't use illegal cloning facilities
---
Let me know when you plan to eat more cheese so I can adjust my market orders accordingly :)

---
yeah 3 outliers dont change the fact that the saturation of the ship type is extremely unhealthy for the game
---
Inb4 chaos era 2.0
---
Never said it was healthy, you asked for instances and I gave them. They do provide content, just not.. "good content"?
---
If you were not hostile with the locals. IE if you were a neut or supplying them even.
---
I played EVE for many months, have been in a few corps and alliances, and understand the basics of how contracts work. That said, I'm having trouble understanding where the profit is made if all you did was accept the contracts without taking the ships. This could be the dumbest question ever, but what am I missing here? I get that you now own all of those thicc ships, but how do you now get all that hard-earned loot out of the system they are docked in? Like, to sell off later, wouldn't you need to at least undock them for moving, and open yourself up to the mad corp blowing you up outside?
---
Wormhole ratting, even c2 sites will be better isk per hour for the most part and then anything higher will start skyrocketing your relative income. There‚Äôs also incursions, exploration, DED sites and abyss sites
---
Invasion is a *perfect pretext* to radically alter the map and fix long standing issues.
---
As usual CCP is pissing in the wind with it instead of harnessing the opportunity. No big plan, no vision. EVE has become all art team/marketing and *zero real game developers* who can actaully come up with something better than Falcon's mood swings.
---
The plan is for Hilmar and company to bleed what they can a while longer then cash out completely to daddy.
---
I wouldn't say elaborate. You do something dumb; you get yelled at by a diplomat.
---
Cause they didn‚Äôt think of it maybe
---
because thats effort
---
its way more ez to reee than actually do all that
---
Does anyone from Signal Cartel come on this subreddit ever? I took an extended break without letting anyone know and was removed from the Corp, I‚Äôd love to come back on, I feel like that has to be the nicest space ranger Corp on this side of new eden!
---
&gt; god love it imagine battle ship proliferation
---
Exactly, brawling returned to fleet fights in EVE in proper fashion
---
Yaaa.....
---
I think being in a bloc  it was fun for a while but it got boring soon after . I only wished the game din migrate into bombers online during blackout
---
What kind of retarded stuff is this?  
---
Since when are people paying 4 bil to PLEX their account atm? The PLEX ISK graph is complete bs.
---
Good point, this one does stand out - I didn't really explain it
---
The idea with low power having no timers is that the structure is more vulnerable because it is not fuelled. The problem with a wardec is that is takes 24 hours to start and the defenders get hella notifications. So without this, there's actually no penalty to leaving your structure low-power 24/7 365 days a year - because you can save those fuel costs by always leaving it low power, and then just fuel it if somebody does wardec you (since you can fuel it immediately and then you get 3 timers). 
---
The other thing is that this makes low-power structures more vulnerable than full power in another way: it opens them up to attacks from everyone, whereas currently the onus is still on the attacker to set up a War HQ to hit a low power structure. I don't think you should need a war HQ to hit a low power structure, this fixes that.
---
Allready replaced? :D
---
Without some kind of counterplay or better rewards, all the people who like hunting are going to run out of targets once people start moving to highsec or similar.
---
Which would suck.
---
CCP have lossmail counseling now it'll be ok it's fine
---
&gt; Screenshot sound
---
&gt; Eve Help menu pops up

I haven't caught an AT ship yet, but this video is very relatable.
---
use your dino brain to rethink about it. who did the most DDOS attack in this game? does anyone have the evidence.
---
As an interesting (possibly tangential) addition, you should read the Signal Cartel Credo that all members are required to abide by.
---
This doesn¬¥t magically add missing pixels, this is not a Hollywood Movie or American Crime Show.
---
Have you heard about our Lord and Saviour - Asset Safety?
---
Such an edgy thread. Such insightful points
---
The venture, that was it.
---
Ultimately I just wanted to try and give us all a good fight
---
like we had a week ago for the exact same timer (that time we were outnumbered, but not as much so we went in and whelped, but had fun doing so)
---
I guess now its all about batphoning to make it go from 1.5:1 to 4:1  
---
Honest question, how does that seam fun for the otherside? when one side is happy to fight slightly outnumbered in just subs for a fight, and the other brings 4 times the number for force a fight not to happen,  
---
I miss the days when people played this game to have fun, that game is now dead in 2019
---
No kidding. Because of this subreddit alone I‚Äôve been worried about eve closing down on and off for about a year. Seems like CCP does one thing not everyone likes and it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe end of eve permanently‚Äù 
---
But shit dude, I just want to explore, so I guess none of the changes really hit me directly
---
High angled weapons were a silly idea..unless you give battleships dread guns as an anti capital role.
---
And then you have us explorers over here pretending PvP is just a rude fever dream
---
Asset Safety
---
Oh shit, OK wow, that makes sense. Without searching, AS is CCP insurance if you can't get to (or bad guys blow up) your ship in dock, right? Except it's free insurance, I think. Has it been around since the start or is it relatively new? I've (obviously) never used it or had need to think about it.
---
Start a few alpha accounts,  train and dick around with them, do missions and stuff, never send them any ISK, never use contracts or mail to give them anything, you don‚Äôt want red flags on ESI. Don‚Äôt make waves, join some whatever hi-sec corps.
---
Then when you have a target you have an established toon to try and join, then hang around as long as you want, do stuff like OP did, if/when a opportunity arises you think is worth burning the toon do it, profit.
---
Oh I'm having fun in high/low hopefully waiting on changed to make null interesting again :) i still think throwing spaghetti at the wall beats the current condition of ns. It's 90% krabbing in multi boxed accounts, and when and risk popped up everyone just sat in dock and was afraid to even leave station.    
---
What's the point of making a billion a day if you won't fight?
---
Yeah it's irritating. Like, do they want new players to leave?
---
Ok.
---
Im not sure having been away from the game for a while, but it looks like the system is close to the TEST/Legacy - WinterCo/Panda frontline. It is possible that the operation is an evac so system would soon be at reach of spy's mates.
---
Sorry, no it wasn't, not at all not even one line of code. you had to put 2-3 engineers on the ps3 version just to get it to run and compile. 
---
The engine was designed for Xbox360 Epic was building Gears of War and got paid 40 mil for the exclusive rights for the title. They had no interest in the PS3, most devs never checked the fixes back into the tree because they had to pay for them.
---
Trust me I worked on UE3 games on the PS3, PC, Xbox. I was at CCP Shanghai visiting while working on Alice 2 the day after CCP got it running on the PS3 it ran at 15-20 FPS. They improved it but it would never run over 30 not for anyone.
---
Dust514 had a very low player count and CCP proved they cant design or produce a FPS game that is competitive with the world so better they stick to things they know. The game was overly complex and under delivered on the promises. 
---
If you will remember this was the 3rd to 5th version of the game they attempted. They spent years trying to develop their own FPS engine and redid the content 2-3 times over again. We estimated they toss 60 mil away total in development resources on it over the years. They sold the rights to Sony so they get could some money back, and maybe be a bigger fish in a smaller pond as the PS3 lost that round of the console wars.
---
Truer words!
---
As far as I know there is also Signal Cartel, who run a dedicated exploration based corp/alliance. They also seed Wormhole Space with Rescue Conatiners (contains Probes and a Probe Launcher) for people who got lost in WH without Probes/Launcher. They are a strictly non combat organisation (except for self defense).
---
Honestly, someday I'd like to be as trusted and widely known as Chribba.
---
If by salty bunch of ********** you mean total crybaby unadaptable manchild betas then yes, I completely agree.
---
Content is fun yeah? We were exploring a wh 2 deep and enemy set up a camp. We were like fuck it lets fight and lose but have some fun. Dropped a t3c and lost some t1 ships. Fucking party
---
Put some tank next time and speed you might make it alive
---
Not sure, I figured part of the deal with Sony prevents them from using that content again. It was some sort of exclusive deal to get a cash injection. 
---
The game wasn't fun to play or had the connection to eve that was promised so I was glad to see it go away of course they moved on to other ways to waste money.
---

---
better win eve right as you started
---
In some cases the alliance 'insures' the couriers and only allows verified individuals access to the contracts. This can make sense when the individual doing the hauling doesn't have enough personal isk to cover the value of the items they're moving.
---
This instance seems like they were just open for anyone in alliance to take, which is indeed just asking for it to get stolen.
---
There are some great answers here, but I hope the point of view of a small group helps.
---
I'm part of a smallish well know  pirate corp (137 members) and we have few but harshly enforced rules: 1 - Respect ransoms and 1v1 when you agree to it; 2 - Don't be a dick.
---
Any director (think of it as subleadership of a guild in any other MMO) can make decisions on the spot if needed, but we usually talk things in leadership (corp and/or alliance) channels and take a collective decision; in the rare case we disagree on something the CEO has the final word, but it rarely happens.
---
What was the problem was it, though? Is it because the game is buggy and mechanics not interesting?
---
It was introduced with Citadels.

Operating on a shoestring and killing off all your tribal-knowledge devs is the first sign of the internal death roll. The rest is paying just-out-of-college kids to keep the lights on while you make bucket runs from the coffers to your getaway car.

That expansion precipitated 10x more outcry than anything you've seen on this sub. There were in-game protests, mass unsubs, nonstop posts. Guess what happened!

Instead of ventures it's just fast align  Tristans. They really shouldn't improve plexing rewards until they change the way plexes work so that you can actually catch someone in a plex. Right now if someone's spamming dscan it's basically impossible to grab them before they warp out

&gt;I would say the same to you, as you seem to be perfectly happy with CCP going out of business if it makes your personal gameplay more fun at the expense of everyone else whose existence in the game you deem invalid.

Peak numbers before the black out were 25k, peak numbers after were 15k, so yea, fuck the minority that didn't want to play because the rest of us were having fun.
---
People were drawn to EvE because the risk held excitement, then a bunch of pussies who wanted a glorified space farming game cried until 6 years of solid nerfs turned the game into a playpen instead of "cold dark and harsh".  I **would** see the game end rather than give over to that kind of dumb bullshit.
---
Only that didn't happen, which is cool, because the game is still fucked, as I type this post theres less than 15k people online, you got the farmers and bots back and lost a chunk of people who've enjoyed EVE for what it was over the years, not what you cocksuckers want to turn it into.

I'll be sitting here shitting on you all until its burnt to the ground out of sheer hate and fun.

if they did RMT at this extend, they should had been banned long time ago, no matter weather if they are the sellers or buyers.  And most of the Titian's pilots AFKed years ago but none of them sold their assets. For all of these you can finally saw them on the grid that day
---
You couldn't really mess it up more at this point. The stakes are so low at this point for FW they don't have a lot to lose by trying new stuff. Like, here's one off the top of my head- upgrading systems with LP also upgrades the plexes in that system and puts more/stronger rats in them, or gives the rats webs/points. Or beacons that create area effects that slow align time or something. Literally spitballing ideas as I type this. Just try new stuff CCP, get weird with it. Nobody is really going to care much if plexing gets wonky, they're almost entirely just being farmed by alts at this point. 
---
I like being in FW because it helps me get more fights but the actual militia vs militia "war" is a mostly irrelevant sideline mechanic that could be so interesting if we took some chances with it.

Ok, I do want 2 non-testing servers, but those are the most idiotic set of rules i‚Äôve ever seen. PVE and PVP should be in both, but Chaos should just be a fresh start while not nuking everyone‚Äôs stuff.
---
They didn't turn the servers off.
---
Almost all earnouts have bonuses tied to helping achieve the financial goals plus interest. Say a seller has a valuation expectation of $15 million, but the buyer thinks a purchase price of $12 million is more appropriate. The gap of $3 million might be bridged by an earnout. There can be an additional percentage stacked onto that, which if achieved by the original sellers, that can be shared in the form of bonuses for helping reach those goals.
---
Womp.
---
Dont pay 40M to move 350M that's stupid. Public contract for 5 mill would get the job done or haul with a high sec alt not in FW.
---
Hmm? Are you one of those people who hasn't played since PLEX was split into 500 units? 500 Plex = 1 subscription. PLEX prices are nits are in 100k ISK. So 4500 = 4.5mil per PLEX, or 2.25bil for a subcription.

I mean, thats not a faucet issue though, thats the game being around for 16 years. Thats wealth accumulation and even though it is linked to faucets it certainly isnt faucets. There is no way to prevent this in a game this old, especially in a sandbox and was bound to happen sooner or later. 
---
I get what youre trying to do with the PLEX discussion. Youre trying to use it as a standard for isk but you are missing out on the fact that the gold standard was discarded due to inherent issues of using standards. And thats even though gold was actually a stable product. PLEX is not. Removing Aurum placed higher "unnatural" pressure on PLEX. And then came skill injectors which forever changed PLEX. If you remove skill injectors the price on PLEX will fall massively, thats a fact. 
---
Which means that you cannot use PLEX as a standard for measuring inflation/deflation. I can agree that in a simple environment a standard could be used but that would require for the product to actually having been stable for all of its existence. PLEX has not been this and trying to use it as a standard after multiple "standard-breaking" actions is madness. No result will say relevant as it paints a completely different picture than is reality.
---
And you can easily see it, you are arguing that we have less purchasing power in comparison to before yet the CPI is at its lowest ever. Today is a great time for a new player to start playing the game as they can buy 500 PLEX from CCP and get around 2b isk for it ingame. That 2b can be used to buy a shitton of products, much more than ever before. Thats more purchasing power, not less. 
---
And it really doesnt matter who sits on trillions because that isk isnt funneled through a financial sector with interest rates and such and doesnt affect the economy, its just a number on a screen. Now I agree that I dont like that number being too high and that faucets need to be checked, but not because of non existent inflation based on a flawed system that uses an outside item as PLEX as a standard after its been tampered with and had its demand increased massively throughout the years.
---
TLDR: Na, CPI has its own problems but its far better than using PLEX as a standard. If PLEX hadnt been changed then sure, I could agree. But not now.
---
yes i had the same issue a week ago. 
---
someone explained to open the launcher in win7 mode or something it worked. Then run it as admin next time and no problems since.
---
I dont think so. The change wasnt directed at logistics at all otherwise they would have mentioned it. And the price difference in cyno cost is too small to actually matter and local markets doesnt work either. The game is pretty much empty so trying to trigger local markets is just a no-starter.
---
Im fairly certain they just got tunnelvision.
---
i used to play EVE a few years back but then deleted my characters and quit. I want to start over but can't think of a fun activity to do that is going to help get me rich quick with a new fresh character other than exploration. Any suggestions?
---
Man that was boneheaded of them. Leadership didn't realize that roles are NOT required to accept alliance contracts? And with no collateral, whoever accepted them would have had no penalty for failing all the courier contracts and keeping the loot. It's the spy's wet dream, especially since asset safety takes care of the evac. Never issue a courier contract without full collateral + 10%.
---
I‚Äôd find an FW Corp and just pvp and pled if I had to do it again
---
0 colleteral couriers are retarded, period
---
It's a valid business strategy. As long as there are fools to keep pumping in money.
---
I don't mean people who use it as intended, (learn the game, leave the corp, move to lowsec.)
---
I mean the players who never leave, and try to "teach" the game from the safety of their 0.8 astrahaus..., etc. 
---
Good on you for branching out, it's much more fun.
---
Unless it's a violent interaction.
---
It's generally easy to "prove" undesirable behavoir of individuals through chat logs and screenshots, plus various other tools... Usually punishments range from a warning, to a fine or having your ship blown up, and ultimately expulsion from the group.
---
An individual that gets tagged for misbehavior typically doesn't make big waves unless it's someone of particular popularity or power.  Removal of entire corporations from alliances can be messier than kicking an individual, depending on how integrated the group in question is.
---
Get a Nereus with Inertial Stabs and hope for the best. My personal opinion is speed over tank on cheap freighters because if/when you get caught you‚Äôre already dead.

Dust released and was cancelled. Then they wanted to do a succespr on PC called Legion and cancelled that before release. Then they wanted to do another one based on UE4 called Nova. It was almost released but cancelled on the day they wanted to launch the Alpha.

---
Immigration is one comparison, but perhaps it's closer to espianage... CCP has no rules regarding scamming, lying, or stealing as long as you do it without exploiting the game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage.  They also allow people to have as many accounts as they want to pay for, and the game is structured in a way that makes playing several accounts at once both possible and beneficial.
---
These factors help create a system where every new player trying to join your group is also a potential agent planted by your rivals, or alternatively just a con-artist looking for an opportunity. Eve players have spent a lot of time and effort over the years trying to mitigate those risks.
---
You'll find that various groups maintain blacklists of characters that are unwelcome for what ever reason (theft, sabotage, generally being an ass, etc)
---
I love me a good tale of a spy doing the good work, bringing down the guys who refused to let me join for spaceships because of all my 'suspicious mails' in Russian/Chinese..
---
"big loss"
---
Didnt understand a word, was still hilarious
---
It depends deeply on the entity you are talking about.
---
Most smaller entities, like high sec/renter corps, have one or two dudes making the rules and they can be only a couple sentence long and very specific: things like, do not rat in this System, do not engage those people, pay/get payed a certain amount of money/minerals towards a corporate project, and so on.
---
Larger entities have more "codified" rules, but most of the time complaints are handled by case-by-case basis. The rulemakers seem to be (usually) a board of alliance directors. Below alliances, the corporations usually impose their own specific rules such as the amount of PAP (combat participation) you have to get each month. Most of the rules are **very** specific Like the Ochre rule so there are little wiggle room, but it's not uncommon for the enforcers to deliberately overlook some things (for example --- they might choose to keep an AFK FC in the corp even when he doesn't have enough PAP, just so that he doesn't go anywhere when he come back to the game).  Usually whoever makes the rules enforce them, so alliance level rules are enforced by alliances leadership and corp rules by corp leadership. 
---
The most codified stuff you can find is probably the treaties signed between EVE entities. They emulate real life treaties and they come in several flavours: non-aggression pacts, territory sale/leasing agreements, mercenary agreements and of course peace treaties. You can probably still find the treaty signed between Imperial Legacy and Panfam/GOTG in the last war, which included a hefty reparation, territorial changes, extraction of assets?, and an agreed period of ceasefire. Those are the more interesting bits of "law" in this game, I suppose, but do be aware not every war ends with a peace treaty; sometimes the opposing party just disintegrate.
---
Beyond that, it's more about the conventions which are essentially the same among all EVE null alliances. Most alliances rules are like the "Terms and Conditions" for the services they provide anyway. The conventions are broad and not really documented, but among other things they include "don't shoot a blue", "don't try to scam your allies", "don't try to steal an Ally's loot", and essentially "respect your allies' legal rights as if you are in real life, and all's fair against your enemies." Some real life conventions trickle down to EVE too, particularly in what speech is tolerated (for example racist speech is mostly not tolerated).
---
In the end, if EVE is a country then it will have a layered legal system, a rather bizzare, libertarian and flexible one too. At the bottom is the EULA as the "constitution", then game mechanics as the basic set of laws, some conventions on top of that as a sort of "morality", and then you have your workplace-specific rules and terms and conditions for the services you are using. There are very few things that are set in stone enough to be considered a "law", and the corporate guidelines are actually the more relevant part of the book.
---
I saw something about doing damage on bumps years ago and the response from CCP was it'd light the servers on fire

Querious is where alliances go to die.

&gt; In the emerging conduits the vedmaks have missile launchers with the  graphics of the entropic disintegrator that does EM and kinetic, and  doesn‚Äôt ramp up.

Keep thinking that. Go tank your ship solely for EM + Kinetic.
---
I got all that, do you have some new info for me? Covert cyno can be lit by bombers. Gotcha. Are you even reading what I'm typing? 
---
Now I don't know if a JF could jump to a covert cyno, or I need to jump in an industrial cyno/normal cyno. Either way, doesn't matter to me since I don't have a JF.
---
Yeah the invation is getting intense isn't it.
---
I think it makes us to gear omni tank, not focusing only on thermal+explo resist...  
---
Its not only that vedmak, zorya kikimora which could spawn on wave 2 does that missile em+kinetic too iirc...
---
I have 3 accounts that my mains have been trained to complement each other before cyno changes. If I want to continue at the same pace, I now need another account so those three can do their thing, and I have a cyno alt. I'm not sure what you're suggesting, but it amounts to the same thing. If I train one of the other characters on one of my three accounts, I just lost an extremely useful leg of my triad. Hence needing a fourth account.

The issue is that they seem to be targeting new players only. I've gotten multiple surveys, but only on alt accounts that are less than 2 years old, and never subbed. They literally don't care what my 3 accounts that have been subbed since 2007/2009 have to say.

Most rats have missile launchers to discourage shenanigans with ultra fast ships the rats can't track. That's why the old 100mn VNI needed at least some form of tank.
---
Blackout wasn't as big of an issue as many seem to think it was. It actually made null safer. The hunters had a much harder time finding people, and only once did a neut drop on me during blackout. He fucked off once I started targeting him, and he could see I wasn't AFK. I didn't even need to call in support. The real changes that have sucked are cyno changes (which basically translate to "sub one more account so you can do what you've been doing, or beg for help from your alliance), and the "invasion" change, which amounted to cancelling a few wars so we could play home defence, and making our home defence more solid than it has ever been. Neither change has helped PvP. In fact both changes stifled PvP. This is not productive in any way, and just keeps Supers and Titans docked. We want wars and fights to counteract the runaway deflation that is currently going on. We don't want anti PvP changes, and we certainly don't want 20,000 people leaving the damn server.

lol, they just never learn with the 0 collateral courier contracts. Its the same shit year after year. From small alliances to big blocks. There are always some alliances who think - this won't happen to us. Oh boy...

Chaos era is over. All CCP devs are working on the NPE (new player experience), there is no time for anything else. New players who dont know how bad CCP is at developing are preferred, old BitterVets are made to leave (see blackout, cyno changes)... ;)

I'll probably be headed to either a smaller NullSec alliance or a wormhole group before the end of the year, but even though the Low-Sec Campus is currently kind of dead (and will probably remain so until new management is able to revive it, since it died because the campus manager stepped down due to RL commitment and the assistant manager joined WAFFLES) after being the most active part of the corp until the end of July, but there are decently active groups based out of Syndicate and J211936. As well as people in the corp who do their own thing and hang out with Spectre or something.
---
It is worth noting that the PVP-related classes tend to be taught by people who know what they're doing. It's just that the people who teach classes tend not to PVP types, so the only one which happens is an intro to logi class every couple of weeks by a guy who mostly carebears (but PVP's more than most of the corp's carebear types). The PVP-oriented campuses are more likely to have people roaming around and the HQ 0.6 system has at least one or two PVP fleets going out per week even though the people there like to crunch moons in the next-door 0.5 system or run missions and have an inexplicable lack of interest in PVP.
---
All NPCs "cheat".

Because CCP is bad.

Himmler won't even be CEO in another month or so according to the buyout contract issued by Pearl Abyss. He's literally flipping tables to try to max out the server statistics, so he can make his $100,000,000 bonus, cash out and walk away. The age of chaos is a misguided attempt to get more players based on one guy's "experience" in Eve, which amounted to 8 months of wormhole life back in 2010. He has no clue what he's doing, and the fact that you can make a C5 wormhole totally safe, and pull 4 bill isk in 4 hours (while there are no entrances) with a 4 pilot crew is indicative of this. The fact that you can pull 1 bill isk an hour in high sec with a 4 man crew running abyssal sites is also indicative of this. Himmler hates null, and had made it so you make less in null and lowsec than you can in high sec or wormhole space, turning the game on its head because he prefers that style of gameplay

&gt; Whaling is a trend sport for chinese nerds now I guess
---
Buying power over other players is something MOST people want to do. It's just that SEA is more shameless about it.
---
One issue here is the rat system is likely based on 16 year old tech, and it's probably heavily integrated into other systems.  This means that there are many cases where rats cheat.  Until recently, you couldn't neut or vamp rats because they didn't have a functioning cap.  This tells us that CCP wasn't interested in modeling npc behavior directly from the player object.  They have recently been making strides to rethink that stance.
---
Shellfish allergies? We warned you crabbing was bad.
---
&gt;Sovereignty, control over a wormhole, take control of the FW warzone, or something.
---
You can buy all of that, just pay other people to do it.
---
Truth is that EVE, because of its player-driven economy, is the single most "pay 2 win" MMORPG in history.
---
I talked to about half a dozen newbros today who died to trig ships in career agent systems. They were undocking and clicking the ‚Äúwarp to location‚Äù for their career agent missions, but dying before they entered warp. They were all killed by the NPCs above the station.

Asking them to have instaundock bookmarks two hours into the game is a bit much.

I get that you mean, but not in this particular instance. They spawned inside the triangle systems. They didn‚Äôt ask to be spawned there. There‚Äôs an invasion in gallente space. So they were told to do career agents, tried to do them, instantly died. Now feel like they can‚Äôt undock, have no isk, no ships, and no guidance on what to do. That‚Äôs a recipe for losing players.
---
Yes, thank you, my IQ is above 60.
---
But how that Onyx managed to tank the faction police? Don't they do a lot of DPS, web, scram and neut?
---
‰ΩïÔºü

you mean minimum
---
I really enjoy reporting and killing the fucking legions of botting vni that litter your space
---
It's not bad, but likely a holdover from a design decision to limit resource consumption.  If you limit what you model for 10s of thousands of potential computer controlled opponents.
---
I run the sites with the flux coil fit, i sit there and primary zorya and starving after i can permatank
---
The new player experience is all about getting ass raped by diamond rats and by wierd some aliens that are obsessed with the number 3
---
Career agents are not spawn systems.
---
I wouldn't call CODE. a legal system, they're more of a particularly famous and well-equipped extortion racket that's turned into a cult at this point. All their talk about James 315 being "democratically elected" and how they run hisec is just roleplaying on their part because it pisses people off.
---
As for corp/alliance rules, the punishments for breaking those rules are oftentimes hilarious due to the utterly put-upon demeanor of whoever is enforcing them, because wrangling EvE players into some semblance of a cohesive group is like herding cats. [See how Nidia Masters expresses his loathing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cpxkes/horde_gate_behavior/) of the idiots he has to deal with on a regular basis.
---
Sometimes the penalty is fines, or loss of privileges, or just getting kicked from the corporation. Other times the people in charge just go "fuck it" and kill you themselves. [Observe Goonswarm's punishment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d2dyh6/delve_spod_genocide_story_anyone/) of an idiot [who kept fitting his ships wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d2dyh6/delve_spod_genocide_story_anyone/ezu9iyg/) after [eleven(!) warnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d2dyh6/delve_spod_genocide_story_anyone/ezun209/) to shape up.
---
Really, without any way to actually hurt someone like you can in real life, players have come up with a number of creative (and often entertaining) ways to punish others for their misbehavior. I'm sure if you keep looking you'll be able to find many stories about this, though you might want to ask the main forums as well. r/Eve has been rather caustic of late.
---
i think dust was released on ps3, when ps3 was on its deathbed so ofcourse it was fail, but hey they got some money from sony to do it
---
if i worked 2-3 games that could not get off the ground, i would stop wasting money and just focus on main game and put all the money into stock market
---
but as companies are, its expand expand expand, so here we have Hilmar shill being CEO and failing and failing and failing
---
I'm noticing a trend...
---
Nice explosion
---
This is gonna sound a little r/IAmVerySmart but whatever 
---
There‚Äôs actually very little resistance in space (our space). It‚Äôs not a lot, obviously, but it does exist - there‚Äôs a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter in space, compared to like trillions upon trillions per cubic meter on earth. Those hydrogen atoms give the tiniest amount of resistance. So it‚Äôs basically frictionless, but not completely frictionless.
---
I think most went to high sec
---
I'll go get scooter...
---
What's the point of the ochre rule?
---
Look at the zorya vedmak on emerging and the damage stream and animations
---
players that create headaches for leaders have a habit of getting comissared
---
Mostly the neutrality stuff.
---
This topic is obviously over your head if you can't see the problem these NPC invasions cause for beginners.
---
I have.
---
Even if you didn‚Äôt decide to go for small easy targets every time and push them to join bigger groups. You, at least, were in the room when it happened and didn‚Äôt speak up. PLs job would have been punishing large groups for being large. But instant gratification always got the better of you, until you eventually ran out of targets.
---
There is some wisdom here.  Passive shield tanked nereus/sigil might have last long enough to make them think twice about solo ganking.
---
Well, it's no different from any other area. If you have half of a braincell and is looking at your screen, you WILL get away safely. This applies to anomalies, deadspace complexes, missions, mining... the few things which can screw you up randomly are siege/NSA timers, and that's still very conditional.
---
&gt; Bumping causes damage (numbers?) to the ship that initiated the bump. However, you cannot die from this (at 1 hull)
---
Cyno in a fleet, cyno in a bunch of capitals in middle, servers go to max TIDI because of bumping... Yeah, fkin awesome idea...
---
Dont forget that they cant use drones
---
where did you get that number from?? Please tell me??   
---
Also NC and PH are in the same coallion, incase you didn't realise, unless you want me to count each alliance in gotg seperate? instead of bringing an entire 2nd collation   
---
For those that want actual Info and not some Shitty meme post like the post above  
---
Local scan of GOTG+Goons and Init

---
Everyone in munins except for init in stukas
---
NC had 143 in fleet consisting of 95 eagles 
---
PH had 80 in fleet consisting of 50 eagles
---
VVV had 60 in fleet consisting of 30 harpies
---
but yea, we totally had 400 in mainline ships to fight that amount of ships with supporting sukas with void bombs
---
Take out the properganda and spin, if it was just gotg in that fight, it would have been even numbers (not inc the 50 caps rr had) and we would have taken that, resulting in a fun fight
---
instead a 2nd coalltion had to be phoned resulting in no fight
---
Wait, what did I miss? I knew there was a potential remake last year around this time, but 4 to 5 remakes?

Ya that was the idea. good brawl bud
---
They got dust working, but Sony insisted it be PS3 exclusive, which hurt the game, and their ranking system was totally broken, so few players stayed in the game. Dust finally went down in 2014, and all compatiblity was removed from Eve in 2017
---
Sometimes you forget the name of your many alts and gank yourself.
---
Maybe you don't understand the mechanics?
---
Boobies have many systems to go to for career agents, they don't have to choose a triangle one.
---
Hope that this bring much more players to the region?     
---
Especially new groups that will decide to move in and try something alone rather than joining big blocks.              
---
EvE need fresh blood in terms of corporations and alliances and until CCP messed up NPC null was the place where those groups were forged.
---
Server went from around 34k logging in to 14k logging in during daily rewards campaign, so yeah, we lost more than 30%
---
I understand just fine. 
---
Beginners do not.
---
True.
---
lets forget about this thing, it brought so much harm to the game people don't even imagine.
---
It's kristallnachte, what did you expect?

it was not me

I noticed this a while ago and reported CCP for rookie griefing for a laugh. nice gm gave me a ship

---
Meanwhile, the 3rd toon makes fun of the 2nd toon for not getting his assets out in the earlier move OP.
---
I've actually done this in alliance with my known alts, starting a confusing thread over several days as people were trying to figure which toons weren't alts.
---
So you can't give any specific examples then.  Also you've no idea how often I objected to what, mostly because you've no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
---
I just have one question.... How the hell do you have a kill from 2008 showing on zkill? None of my losses from 2007-2010 show on my zkill
---
Yes there are many fits that works for this sites, but I found active tank with cap booster is comfortable for me at least, I can't really figure out how to passive tank this sites :O  
---
Btw, just ran that sites, there are graphic for missile launcher on vedmak.. https://i.imgur.com/MYn2tx2.png
---
With Titans being sold for 40 bill, and supers being sold for 8 bill, they ARE throwaway ships
---
That's CONCORD.
---
Also, every HIC has massive buffer.
---
Have you tried using combat recons?
---
So how will they learn? Of not by learning?
---
I do 40 Planets with Fuelblock P2, had it setup for a 2 days schedule - some stuff you can easily do on alts while krab/being in fleet.
---
Had to change the circle to 7 days to stay sane
---
What's the range, alpha and DPS for a high sec sentry gun? Ship size matters for sentry locking time in this case?
---
&gt; Something they can understand why it happened.
---
I'd say it's not the best way to describe that. The loss must be a part of adventure, and it's not loss that makes it fun and/or motivating most of the time, it's just that interesting stuff in EVE tend to end up with a loss for inexperienced people.
---
Being blapped by powerful yet dumb NPCs which you could've avoided by taking notice of one of roughly thousand interface elements you're not yet familiar does not make for a good adventure.
---
Everyone knew sort was going to get down on his knees and start sucking when the heat was on like he usually does.
---
They will learn by putting themselves in situations they shouldn't have. Not by being put in those situations by bad game design.
---
One could certainly make the argument that people looking to kill other players should  leave the area of space with no restrictions on doing that to do so in the area with  the most restrictions, but that would be a really stupid argument to make.
---
Consider an anchored fleet where the anchor gets webbed, and everyone bumps. instantly taking 80% of the fleet to hull.

See for yourself:

I only restarted playing a couple weeks ago, I quit in 2013. The fist week that I looked at zkill there was only 1 page of stats on me, but it seems that the more I go there, the more shit from my past starts showing up. I have no idea wtf is going on really.
---
Maybe look up OTEC: goons, nc., Pl, etc agreed to control the price of Technetium to all get rich. And even formed fleets as allies to defend each others moons.
---
This guy is responsible for like 1/3rd of new eden intact plate supply ... so quite probably
---
Judging by their presentation from a year ago, CCP have but an abstract idea along the lines of "hey, let's make a FPS". At this point I doubt there's some sort of vision beyond that, or understanding what to do besides trying to copy random elements of some CoD-piece, R6 or what have you.
---
What they have shown us a year ago did not look like DUST tbh.
---
Wouldnt come as a surprise. After all, they are doing their best to make their old players leave as well.
---
I don‚Äôt think what subreddit you‚Äôre in excuses being a massive dick for no reason.
---
I‚Äôm 100% sure that if you were actually a halfway-decent human being in this thread, we‚Äôd see more upvotes for you, as well as more people replying that they agree with you, because I, for one, think you have a point, but that‚Äôs not an excuse for being a douchebag.
---
Lol, I have him blocked so cant see what hes writing. But judging from the topic and the responses it seems I made a good choice.
---
Well some NPCs can shoot to +2k km. Cap battery neut resist does not work against old rats, not sure about diamond ones tho.
---
Resubbed my highsec alt yesterday with 25% off. I didn't receive an email about it.
---
It is a new feature, but I'm confident it will be patched after a few weeks once they collect data to ban lots of bots.
---
Burtakus has been camping that system for years.
---
Cause who ever does QA for them does not play the game and does not think at all about the end user. So it is never about the experience, just about requirements.
---
This guy doesn't understand game design, nor the limitations that come with programming an AI that needs to compete with a player.
---
Making an AI that is capable of competing with a player and providing a challenge without "cheating" is very difficult, especially given the resource limitations of the average consumer's computer(s). Humans can adapt to changing situations, adjust strategies on the fly, and coordinate outside the game in ways that no AI is yet able to do. 
---
At the same time, a lot of AIs in games such as CS:GO and Offworld Trading Company have the opposite problem: Not being limited by human reflexes and being capable of complex number-crunching far faster than a human, AIs in these games wouldn't be fun or enjoyable to fight, they'd win every time because instantly snapping to an opponent's head or out-trading a human on a stock exchange is relatively trivial.
---
So game designers have to program their AIs to cheat, artificially limiting them in some ways (for example, adding reaction time limitations in CS:GO or restricting the trading model in OTC) and artificially enhancing them in others (for example, letting them lock at extended ranges in EVE or giving them bonus resource generation in Stellaris), because the main focus is fun and engagement, not competitive ability.
---
The issue for making AI in EVE is that EVE is the sort of game that is difficult for AIs to be competitive in. There's a reason why while the more trivial and repetitive tasks have been successfully automated (eg. mining, trading, ratting, etc.), there as yet is not a bot capable of being competitive in PvP on a level playing field (eg. a bot capable of regularly winning frigate 1v1s against other players). Human players can adapt to changing situations more easily and effectively and adjust strategies on the fly, while AIs can't do much more than execute a few pre-programmed loops. Add in the need to heavily optimise AI to be able to run hundreds of thousands of AI players in parallel on one server, and it becomes extremely difficult to make AI that is competitive.
---
So, again, CCP makes the AI "cheat", giving the AI advantages that no human player would ever have in order to make the AI more fun and engaging to fight against. And, for the most part, they generally succeed. While run-of-the-mill rats are tedious to fight, anomic burner rats can be exciting to new players...before they figure out the patterns and optimise, because at the end of the day the AI is still just executing a few pre-programmed loops.
---
AI in EVE cheating is not "hurr durr CCP lazy", it's human developers doing the best they can with what they have, making the best and most engaging AI they can using as few resources as possible. And as annoying as it might be to be pointed from 500k away by a rat, I guarantee fighting rats without these abilities would be even more dull and pointless.
---
Great example of Chaos Era.
---
You dump some ideas to improve the game in a direction, but instead players gameplay and ingame mechanics force the game to go anywhere but in the direction you wanted.
---
between april and September, we went from 36,000 to less than 26,000 at peak times on Sundays and Saturdays. During the week the numbers were lower at both start and finish but the percentage change was as bad or worse.
---
 neat kill.
---
song used:
---
# Halogen - U Got That
---
Got any clips of Grath dying?
---
Because they are lazy and don't give a fuck.
---
Honestly, makes ShitStain look normal.
---
dipshits accusing dipshits of being dipshits. funtimes.

Looks like TheBigRedBoat with beard
---
If you are not sure about what Kangaroo Court is, you should sue a case against Corp Leadership for not providing your with the bare minimum information required daily dinoforumino.
---
&gt; What are you trying to expect?
---
He actually written at least a single thing he wanted: info on which of your reports were confirmed.
---
Can we see the killmail?
---
They have to choose to go to the triangle system though.
---
And the game warns them of the dangers of the triangle systems.
---
They can't even undock or enter the system without acknowledging and dismissing the warning.
---
Honestly man, its been like this for quite some time. And all over, not just Eso. If you want fights solo or with some friends its always been better to go where more new players live, like Horde or Brave space. Also outside of blocs and specific places that vary.
---
Blocs pretty much only respond to big threats and a solo ship isnt that. Right now theres also a war and its a very hectic period atm so people are just focused and tired. Not to mention that NS lost a lot of players during the last months.
---
So reading a dialogue saying "this system is currently being invaded, we can't keep you safe" and then going in anyway and dying doesn't result in learning?
---
I used to play \~2014-2015 I had a friend who was in a WH clan and game was fun would have stayed but clan fell apart and haven't played since. I left the game with 19,000,000SK i see that lots has changed I lost mastery on some ships and now theres omega and F2P. Where can I learn more about the changes cause I was outfitting my Astero with a guide and noticed new items too. Tried the discord link but its expired or something.
---
If we had the lossmail we could probably explain what happened.
---
Killmail? What's your character name?
---
Never seen someone look so Australian. Like a blend of Jim jefferies and chopper read
---
By requesting people mine the ochre first, the belt can be mined out so it respawns in hours instead of days. More good ores faster is better for everyone
---
I tried to make him looking like Kano from mk 11. He's Australian
---
I feel like your post contradicts itself a lot
---
&gt;there needed to be a significant trust in place usually from years of ingame interaction.
---
How is a newbie who is 'worried about his salvage' supposed to have already developed that, exactly?
---
&gt;None of the risk was on me, and I always told people ‚Äújust be aware that I could steal all your stuff if I really wanted to‚Äù
---
How exactly does this help the newbro? Like, what can they do differently once you tell them this information? They're still gonna contract it to you, and you could still steal it.
---
&gt; transporting in highsec should be fairly safe or have a harsh penalty for random ganks
---
granted. luckily, this is already true.
---
&gt; This pirate didn't seem to get any Concord repercussions in a 1.0 sec.
---
if you base this on zkill intel, then most likely the api is not linked, and the kills are uploaded manually. that is why you don't see the losses of the ganker.
---
Thanks a pic like that was exactly what i wanted &lt;3!  lol sorry but i dont even know what pyfa is, i am very new to eve and i did try to search before posting here
---
&gt; Didnt Hilmar say he wanted to keep everybody guessing and uncertain?
---
Including Hilmar himself, you mean?
---
They do other things as well, offering location and retrieval are one of them.  There is also Signal Cartel, though that seems less their deal.
---
I kinda like this plan.
---
Lol thats awesome. This post bought your entire crew goodwill. This is how people should post.
---
Well done brother!
---
If they write to you there will be an option in messages. Probably an easier way but thats how I do it. Bait out a reply then clicky clicky:)
---
they could move bumping service to the cloud  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Clearly the real spy was the alliance director who pinged out the instructions to use no collateral.
---
Dont fight children,  you both RMT
---
Or even a horde/brave/karmafleet/othernoobcorp alt for that matter, can spy while building a backstory for your spy.

---
&lt;too late, warps anyways&gt;
---
BRAVE would need an FC and at least 2 logi for that.
---
Wat? Not sure is shitposting..
---
Two 1m sp grants from promos and a 250k sp grant from RAF along with the 5m sp cap.
---
&gt; Himmler hates null, and had made it so you make less in null and lowsec than you can in high sec or wormhole space, turning the game on its head because he prefers that style of gameplay
---
Of course, we shall ignore that Null was terrible to live in for the majority of EVE's lifetime, something that changed only in 2015 (or so) when sov support structures were revamped finally ensuring people don't have to run hisec alts for money and nullsec alts for fleet PvP, and keep inventing alternative history where this villain Hilmar destroyed nullseccer's promised lands something around 2010.
---
Or maybe someone is just nostalgic about chain belt ratting, I dunno.
---
its a little thing called community. a game community infact. that we have the power not ccp. to make the game good and fun.
---
its the famous saying 'kids these days'. people just cannot, and dont have the skillset to think of others or how to better themselves lol.
---
when your surrounded by retards thats fine. but some of the more experianced players? the ones ive known for 3 years? i wouldnt mind jumping to thier cyno, they know just as well how to place a cyno as anyone.
---
Ok, so they are advised to see a carrer agent. Then they get 'don't its scary there atm'
---
So what options do they have? Log out until the triagles leave? They dont even know if the triangles do leave.
---
You seem to be delusional enough to believe otherwise, but when you began eve you didnt know wtf half the shit that you came across ment either.
---
I really feels a bit 'special olympics' conversing with you so I'll leave you dribble on and be wrong since it's obviously your 'thing'.
---
Fun fact - you're the 1st window licker ive come across from Wingspan who isnt just roleplaying.
---
i mean, its not somthing you can 'see' differently. i learnt it watching countless youtube and twitch pvpers, i encountered it myself through countless fights. especially in a active tank battleship. and my firends also know these facts and i assure you. if you watch any pvp that goes well, and is in cruiser or above. the things im pointing out about baittanking, bump tackling, are 100% correct
---
&gt; How is possible for someone to blow my ship up in warp?
---
it isnt possible except someone is using sb's which basically noone uses to gank haulers
---
&gt; This pirate didn't seem to get any Concord repercussions
---
he definetly did if he agressed you without wardecs/killrights
---
&gt; This is the kinda shit that makes me want to leave for another 5 years
---
if it only takes that little, eve is definetly not for you
---
&gt; transporting in highsec should be fairly safe
---
it is fairly safe if you follow simple rules
---
let me guess, https://zkillboard.com/kill/79085855/ this was you?
---
the rule about hauling 1b in a t1 industrial today was the same 5years ago. dont be stupid and do that.
---
My guess is that this carebear was flying a shuttle or corvette  
---
and was smartbombed in Jita on Perimeter gate  
---
while his shit PC tried to lad the grid.
---
will  ESI display if i aid alt with ships/modules/loot throught ejecting from  ship  [freighter] then board [freighter] with omega alt and sell it? or transfer that way ships for missions,exploration,mining?
---
Fully agree. 
---
But honestly, this sub thrives on salt and since there wasnt much from NS over these changes people just ignored them. Plenty of people Ive talked to here during the blackout didnt even know about the nerfs yet they were arguing that more were needed. 
---
Some even had a frame of reference going back several years, cheering chaotic changes due to things that havent been in the game for a long time. Age of chaos was simply disruptive, nothing else.
---
We absolutely don't need Falcon who does nothing but being an asshole over media channels.
---
CCP don't have people we need more of anymore.
---
right, in general. But as I said: At least learn to run away.
---
And... if I remember it right... didn't i get a warning before undocking in an invasion system?
---
Or, to turn this around: Why should only experienced players get attacked by Trigs? This is a lore threat, that's all for all ;)
---
So from my point of view, it's okay. Even though i also got shot by Trigs sitting on a station. But only because i stood there watching to find out what they do ;)  Learning by burning ;-)))
---
would dual rep marauder do them or dual rep domi navy?
---
Career agents are all over, not in only one system. There are a lot of career agent systems.
---
You're complaining about an NPE without even understanding the NPE.
---
The hauler channel is indeed great for advices, cool people
---
The best is to have an out of corp alt so your alt hauler is not subject to the permanent war mechanism.
---
Also T1 industrial can't tank much ( fit rigs and mids by the way), a Deep Space Transport is more or less fast to train into. Also use the cloack+mwd trick if you feel something is fishy.
---
About the dst to go to it's you preference : impel can reach incredible tank for high sec ( and wait for concord response) but for low sec you can go shield tanked dst ( like the mastodon) so you can fit as many warp stab as you can in the lows ( or inertia stabs for speed).
---
Cargo expanders also lower your tank as their drawback so use them with caution.
---
Using an hauler alt also allows to let him in Jita to 0,01 isk and have better margins than just selling to buy orders.
---
Last advice : abandon the state and join Minmatar militia !
---
I play on 2500u, dual-channel RAM. For most things you should be able to comfortably run one-two instances on medium or more on low settings. However, abyssal space is generally more demanding on the GPU then the rest of the game, I had some stutter there.
---
At this point I think the only save will come from PA. It might go well, it might go to shit. But I think the age of chaos just did too much damage to CCP credibility. They will have to pump out the best expansion ever to halt this and I think we both know they wont.
---
smaller groups wouldnt need a daily JF to sustain them. thus, less work for the less population.
---
New people will learn the game however it is at that stage. and will stay or not at the same rate they do now. if they start while its easy and bliss like it is now and experiance the changes with some bad timing on thier playthrough, then you risk quitters.
---
local blackout was a negative thing for krabbers in big groups or small groups. however, it was worse for the bigger group imo, a small group, you dont know how many friends they have in system, if you attack say, goons, you knew theyre response times or how many are nearby just by knowing thier location. 
---
and i bet my last buck that if they did as you say, bring back blackout, with some form of counter at a cost, you would be crying at ccp saying its too expensive for a small group to buy for just 5 dudes. its not fair, always thinking of the bigger guy. because the hard truth is, bigger groups are stronger and more adaptable and more powerful because they are bigger group. its kind of one of the advantages
---
EVE it's a pain. 
---
Be ready for it each time when you log in.
---
Smartbombs can.
---
But mostly, I feel like all of these details are missing something.
---
Do you have killmail?
---
i want estamel invul bpo
---
yeah, if it exised it will cost you about 10 tril.
---
Taiwan Number 1! Free Hong Kong!
---
It gives the player a feeling of pride and accomplishment to.... WAIT A SECOND!
---
https://evepraisal.com/a/np4x6
---
Is that a Falcon BPO or just a copy?
---
If you have been playing for two year‚Äôs you should know about ganking. 
---
Bad bait is bad.
---
Judging by the OP, probably only through tears of laughter.
---
Ganking haulers carrying expensive stuff is done by suicide ganking groups. The person who agressed you got concorded but managed to kill you before that could happen.
---
Yeah yeah yeah keep doin that. And remember to free Scotland, and California NO.1.
---
(Seriously I truly believe California should go independent therefore Californians wont suffer from that high crime rate :p)
---
This here is why I even got into this game. Beautiful.
---
It's where people with enough courage to undock solo PVP.
---
In all fairness, it's easier for an experienced player to shrug off losing 1/3rd of their wealth than for a new player to shrug off losing even 1/5th of their wealth. The experienced player has lost a lot before and understands how to make their losses back in relatively short order, while the new player has less experience with loss and doesn't yet have the skill, both IG and IRL, to know what to do to make it back quickly.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Let me explain - CCP tried to some easy fixes and :               
---
* introduced drifters -&gt; OP NPC spawning on top of you and shooting stuff you need to defend instead fighting others. Made some people quit.  **IT WAS REVERSED**             
---
* introduced Tax changes -&gt; just raised taxes ... well we need isk sink so it is a good one. Minimal effect on population big effect on isk removed. **CCP forgot to include citadels under this tax**             
---
* Introduced blackout -&gt; made K null working like WH space ... just without ability to close the WH and full esi feed when and where something is happening. Shitload people quit. **IT WAS REVERSED**                   
---
* Introduced Cyno Changes -&gt; Only half of recons and BO can light cynos. People adapted, less targets to shoot, no way to move capitals ... it is actually cheaper to insure and self destruct cap rather to move your carrier and lose a recon in the process. **To Be Reversed**              
---
* Introduced bumping changes -&gt; 3min and you warp off. Killed many play styles for potential help with new player retention.  **To Be Reversed**           
---
Over last few months CCP tried but failed hard, annoyed many players and help many to win with EVE.            
---
Single good change related to taxes, but as usual only implemented in half as non NPC structures are excluded.
---
bad bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.55606% sure that Capable_BO_Pilot is not a bot.

---
Man...many African countries, Italy, Greece, Turkey are also Capitalism.
---
Well at least you learned two important lessons:
---
- use an alt in an NPC corp to move stuff, so you don't have to worry about wars or fw.
---
You don't need a new account, just create another toon in the same account and sacrifice some of the training on your main for training it as hauler (or buy a multi character training license).
---
- hauling in a T1 is crazy even with an NPC hauler, with that setup a Vexor can kill you and get isk positive even if he get killed by Concord.
---
Train a blockade runner and travel safe.
---
Faction warfare is already chaotic. Warp into a plex and suddenly recons.
---
Sure. Still hurt though.
---
I think I logged off for the rest of the night. Didn't have much else to do anyway, but definitely like "...what the fuck..."
---
But nerdrage is still not beneficial or practical even for a new player. It's more of a sign of incompatibility.
---
good bot
---
Yeah now you need alts for other things, null sec is still shit, the money making has just moved to something else. And in the eyes of the Devs if they knew what we were doing to make isk they would try and 'fix' it. But the CCP Devs are clueless.
---
Converting LP can be a bitch: https://zkillboard.com/kill/77490495/
---
Because there's no proof? FRT has had people banned because of it while AoM has had a guy getting accused of it?
---
With this logic everyone is RMTing.
---
This always gets me in Eve banter.you always have this way to wrap a concept up to describe it in Eve player terms that seems like it can just blanket it over and give it a valid description and fleshed out theory. 
---
Risk management is one of those glorious buzzwords that we think drives all player actions yet I still see saint people like saint Lucifer shoving bills a day into a lowsec meat grinder or that legend guy who loses 10 supers a week and gets berated by the playerbase for it
---
lol
---
I started EvE a month or so ago and just read about the Trig invasion.  
---
Roamed a bit outside Jita for mining and when warping back, got my ass handed by a Trig squad in seconds.  
---
Was more awestruck then slightly tilted wondering how I'd even have countered that.
---
Cloaking is the real tank.
---
Read Innominates post again and look at EVE 2019.
---
ISK/the price for those ships has and will always fail as a balancing factor.
---
three fucking letters : K W fucking G  
---
"but but but... they were renters" yeah maybe, and maybe Legacy leadership chose to harbour these fucking botters and to accept their """"""rent"""""" despite knowing EXACTLY where the isk came from? (thus morally cautionning what KWG was doing 24/7 for months if not years)    
---
Cmon man, it's ok to trashtalk WC since we're on reddit and there's a legacy/WC war going on but open your  eyes : legacy DID happily use KWG botting money at some point, saying otherwise is silly at best.
---
This wasn't even a gank though, it was faction warfare.
---
Someone give this man gold.
---
Have my upvote good sir I‚Äôm currently on the way to work on the hard shoulder with a flat tyre cheered me right up üëç
---
As a proud member of both Karmafleet and Karmafleet University, I'm going to disagree with this. There are basic skills pilots should learn, and having the opportunity to learn those skills while being exposed to but not forced into nullsec will make the transition less jarring in addition to making new player expectations be met with support instead of disappointment. 
---
We're still saving them from highsec, just in a way that has a better chance of retaining players than before.
---
Yeah, it takes about 2.5m SP to get a blockade runner with market skills.
---
Definitely worth it.
---
Have brought this to the attention of the relevant team again :)
---
Capitals are the easiest ships to multibox. Especially in TIDI.
---
They wont bcs CCP's Q&amp;A is one of the worst ive ever seen (does it even exists?). We are one of the most forgiving community ever, we are able to keep going despite everything CCP throws at us, but that isnt generally true for FPS. Imagine Fornite being broke for a day, there would be no playerbase day after.
---
Oh, yeah, I don't disagree with you there. I just want to add to what you say by noting that it's pretty natural for a newer player to become quite upset at a minor loss, even if it's not full-on rage.
---
I mean, he'd have nothing to gain from proving anything. Either he proves it and he will get banned himself or he doesn't prove it and the r/eve mob will still consider it as true.
---
Skill injectors solve your "problem" of titan/super sitters.
---
you hotdrop an AT ship, mass ultra wideeyed hardcounter him. he dies in 2 shots.
---
pilots says 'gf' in local
---
props to the pilot. gf man, gf
---
Sure. But it's a harsh world out there.
---
That's what makes EVE EVE.
---
We don't have lifetime insurance like star citizen.
---
Make kill marks bigger and add skin packs for them.
---
God as if my voice wasn't high enough pitch already. I feel sorry for you man.
---
I think dual rep marauder would be great but too overkill I guess??  
---
Any battleships will do fine I guess, if fitted to high ehp/s..  
---
I used x-large shield boosted machariel..
---
I suppose semantics aside, it was a solo hic, a passive sigil would take a long ass time to merk either way, and our hapless pilot might have had a chance to phone a friend.
---
I hope you have nanite paste with you.
---
I must be conditioned to see steel blue as big business, money grabbing Caldari.
---
Chaos era is just an excuse from CCP to troll sov null Pilots, but the pcu countertrolled CCP.
---
Add 100% ship reimbursement in new concord training academy constellations, where new and old players can learn the game risk free, in a sandbox environment. Some limits obviously to this but think similar to gw2 arena pvp system.
---
This is some durrhurrdurr shit
---
Hey, CCP put 70% of their time in trying to get the player retention up, this is the best they were able to come up with.
---
Alsavoinen and vlillierier are lit.
---
What is wrong with you?
---
Why always this childish raging? Is your life that miserable that you need to try to be a edgy badass on the internet? Were you beat up in school too often? Did daddy give you too much love with the jumper cables?   
---
Was mommy the only woman in your life that touched your wee wee?
---
Can you even image typing out a sentence without raging and insulting others?
---
Do you have like a low IQ or aspergers or some other diagnosis?
---
Add arena pvp where people can spectate, think like a citadel with a huge bubble that you can cruise upto and watch people duke it out.
---
My goals have changed a bit from when I first installed 15 months ago. Currently my goals are more in line with a focus on socializing and asset acquisition. I'm in a pretty good place for the social aspect. Current and previous asset list goals are:
---
Buy a Dagon for my 1 year anniversary -met
---
Buy a titan shortly after -met
---
Buy a Chemosh for my birthday in August -late but met 
---
Buy second titan by spring 2020 -in progress 
---
Buy Molok as final piece of Blood Raider Collection before 3rd anniversary -not started
---
Now go buy an AT ship and lose it.
---
Revamp all the existing pve content in the game..
---
Could you imagine the homicidal rage of the poor sod who mortgages his house for a virtual ship he loses five minutes into the game?
---
Just go fight other wormholers :p
---
where you infact in lowsec? inlowsec smart'bombs' can AOE you to death in frigates and shuttles as your landing.
---
if your inhisec, its most likely you were flying with loot. and you got seen with it. its a lesson everyone has learnt about one way or another. trillions of isk die each millisecond inhisec. your not alone. eves harsh, and has some tough lessons for people refusing to join a group and be given advice.
---
with a kill link we could say what happened.
---
If they are a tiny minority they are not bad for the game.
---
Make T1 frigates, dessies &amp; cruisers easier for new players by rebalancing their hp/CPU/cap/Pg, and adjust what skills apply to what size ships, get new players into better ships faster. Break the back of the initial weeks of training. Or even better just give every player magic 14 to level 5.
---
eve is literally full of this stuff. people making up rules. commanding others to follow.   the bigger the group the more publicly known the random rule becomes. smaller groups rule about a smaller area less people care about reap less coverage.
---
Eve is not slowly dying, it's dead. It died years ago.
---
Add the recognised short hand to the game. In documents and to the market. For example if I search mwd on the market it should bring up microwarp drives.
---
so much cringe
---
Just get your allaince to build everything locally, stop using jita
---
I'm well aware that he was banned for it. But if you think that violence, especially something so severe is in any way acceptable over a damn video game you're in desperate need of professional psychiatric help.
---
What is this, 2008?
---
It's new, and basically lets you pay a fee and it moves your items to a lowsec station.
---
The alliance pays the haulers after the fact.
---
Shit suggestion sunday
---
Imagine trig recon party attacking me in Molea at the graveyard while I was paying my respects... u/CCP_Falcon
---
We are demi gods, give us an entourage/staff to do all the boring shit for us. Like putting in multiple manufacturing jobs, fitting ships, etc.
---
I see what you did there... Sneaky man. 
---
Have an updoot
---
My friend doesn't get the joke, could someone explain it for him?
---
Thanks Falcon!
---
Can someone explain why do ppl allways have empty midslots? Like, shield extenders are kinda cheap, and saved my newbie ass a few times.
---
cHaOs eRa
---
grr jetors hat jetors
---
did you understand what mistake you made?
---
&gt;We are one of the most forgiving community ever
---
:thonking:
---
ah thats good to know. Do u know if discord functions in china?
---
*glances towards the original Everquest*
---
all it takes is writing style analysis. Larger the sample the better.
---
Can still fit stabs to any other cheap-ass frig and do the same as a venture did
---
People do that already with the stock market. Some people probably took huge loans to buy bitcoin before it crashed.
---
The tiny minority is large super capital brawls.
---
What's bad for the game is abuse of capital umbrellas which is much much more common.
---
It does look good, but yeah, boring as hell... At some point you can't clone CoD and expect to be better than the dudes who have been making actual CoD games for 15 years.
---
I mean, give me Dust 515 for PC, or a PlanetSide 2 reskin or whatever, but I've played enough Black Ops 1 for now.
---
Man lockbrajer bombs are useless
---
The again part is the scariest bit of all :(
---
Well, cyno changes are actually quite decent for FW, isn't it? A bit less likely to be dropped on by capitals...
---
Cant get dropped inside plexes im pretty sure
---
dude was using it to kill explorers in pre-scanned relics sites and didn't heat away from a covert cyno. gf
---
That statistic specifically refers to loss caused by other players, not NPCs who are neither explained to the player nor expected in a new player system. [(The CCP presentation you are probably thinking of)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A92Ge2S8M1Y)
---
"Players would try and kill me?!"
---
Ofc, but lowsec and FW lowsec has always been plagued by capital drops. Plexes doesn't matter if getting to them, or making any decent sized fleets or killing the ihub will get you dropped on...
---
my boi Lancer
---
i mean, isnt this what the caedes is best at? frigate hunting in prescanned sites? :). im not sure how else you could use it and be somewhat safe ish. i also thought cynos couldnt be lit in a scanned down site. shows what i know about this explo stuff.
---
We brought up a few changes.
---
There isn't going to be a revamp. CCP don't have the space for that on their internal roadmap. But smaller changes may be possible to fit in amongst other work.
---
nice !
---
Now it's time to take care of their C4 :p
---
More. 
---
No, I don't have a count for you, but more than that.
---
Really nice!
---
I once started a spy alt but got bored pretty quickly and dropped it, so I really admire your patience; glad it was more than properly rewarded.
---
And Nosprey !
---
If you look closely, you can notice there is something slightly wrong with this face.
---
I've always wanted to try something similar with an orca or freighter as the ball, and with macs to push it around.
---
MVP
---
not to literally shit on you, but from the videos ive watched of yours in the past, its clearly an attempt to include content, and give a good video, but you can dilly dally a bit. more compressed content rather than spending 30-60seconds on each joke as you usually do would be an improvement, otherwise your videos are usually not bad.
---
poor me having to wait until my work break time to watch this video.
---
Wait, I thought the meme came from the regular BOB BBQ.         
---
Though it is highly likely that after they gloated with that for years, they later got mocked by it.
---
(from the perspective I got after reading empires of EVE and other pieces about that era)
---
Sure, but this thread isn't about a new player system.
---
It's about a career agent system.
---
One the player has to willfully go to and be warned by the game about the invasion.
---
So it is explained and expected and not in a new player system.
---
Give NPCs actual ships, with actual modules, affected by actual virtual NPC skills. When destroyed, NPCs are subject to same drop rules as player ships(50% chance) instead of arbitrary loot tables.
---
**This** is what people mean by "not cheating NPCs". Not fucking Skynet.
---
In fact, this theoretical new model only requires two AI changes: tell NPCs to web/scramble if they have an appropiate module and tell them to try and "warp out"(despawn) when in structure.
---
Why do you want one specific type of response to your specific content request from a certain group of people in one region your hole went? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I know what you mean, but you are expecting something that have not happened for quite a long time. Personally, I have my main subcap char deployed and I wouldn't clone back to Esoteria unless shit is real. Why should I gudfite a token wormholer when I can have plenty of fights in Detorid?  [https://zkillboard.com/system/30000492/](https://zkillboard.com/system/30000492/) 
---
I lived in WH for a while and I reckon every now and then it is hard to find targets. It happens everywhere because the map has too many systems and very few players. So, if null-sec players refuse to be the landscape for wormholers "farm-simulator" game, don't blame them.
---
You seen shadoo around lately?
---
id be interested to think, if capitals could jump unlimited ranges, but you got 1minute red timer for every light year you jump.....i do wonder what would happen.
---
yes you can jump to an enemy region but you cant jump out for x time
---
Aren‚Äôt there only four? Career training agents only exist in the starting systems for each race I think. Other agents are everywhere, but the agents that you‚Äôre directed to after the tutorial are not.
---
if anyone crys loud its wormholers. i too feel any changes to wormholes is not worth the aggrevation
---
Literally killing eve from inside.
---
Clearly a corp set up by NPC rats to pad their killboards
---
On the way to B-R5RB, stopped by the Amarr homeworld and noticed this cool little formation. 
---
Hey CCP maybe next Chaos event cant be these lads doing a little roam.
---
Incursion -&gt; you enter someone space to burn it or achieve specific objective to pull out at the end.            
---
Invasion -&gt; you enter someone space to take permanent control over it.              
---
Check any dictionary.
---
it's why most people that actively use the caedes in null end up dying before long
---
well that and going 2.5km/s 10 seconds after a cyno was lit
---
Photoshop?
---
Thanks, that's cleared things up a bit.- What are some examples of the very black and white enforcement of the rules?
---
Nah mate, go check out the Royal Guard location at the Amarr Homeworld - its there
---
Sure, and do some alliances create rules/laws that the smaller ones are made to follow?
---
Faction police do fairly negligible dps, and can be entirely circumvented by baiting them to aggro a drone receiving rr.
---
Intriguing - do you think it was a formal agreement or something more casual (ie, 'let's all make money together')?
---
People like to think they wouldn't get ganked. I see those "economeme" fits all the time. People expect to move billions of ISK in unfit ships safely, or generally don't fit the ships like it matters.
---
Imho well deserved. When people like to call suicide ganking "low effort gameplay" they should think about why suicide ganking takes so low effort and put in some effort on their end to raise the effort needed on the other.
---
Dont do ejectors kids
---
Is that 10b a month profit after costs? Seems like very little profit for that amount of effort lol
---
But if I gank a newbie in those systems, I'll get banned.  :thonkingface:
---
This is great - I think the whole theme of 'do what you want' is really a strong factor pushing against large, highly regulated organisations. Also, I had come across being made to sing in coms - that kind of thing is great - public humiliation is a classic really.
---
Awesome man, that would be super useful - tax seems to be a bit of a rarity in EVE
---
So,... How much do those toons make in a month?
---
Is it really efficient looking at the investment needed and the head struggle?
---
They're mostly only good in high class wormhole sites if you multibox 3 of them. They aren't really used anywhere else.
---
Nope.
---
For 1, there are more than 4 starting systems, there are 12, one for each "Education" thing.
---
And there are also a handful of career agent systems per race.
---
And the tutorial doesn't direct you to a single career agent system. It teaches you how to find them and lets you pick (though most will pick the closest one)
---
This is just a formation, not actual players right?
---
Correct, just lifeless NPC's. I'd imagine there would be a similar fleet at each empires homeworld's. 
---
Its just a bunch of each class of ship copy and pasted.
---
Remove fleets all together so fleet battles are as chaotic as they are in star wars
---
Ye like the 4 titans near amarr hub
---
It was planned since day 0 of Halloween war, as natural counter to famous slowcat doctrine, used by PLNC. The only question was where exactly it will happen, not if.
---
Ok, I was curious because I‚Äôm pretty new to the game and I didn‚Äôt feel like there was much of a choice. And if I had started getting blown up right outside of the school I was directed to, I probably would have stopped playing.
---
Some bumping logic 
---
X bumps Y - Bump Timer on Y and X 
---
X bumps Y  before timer runs out - no collision for X and Y
---
Gives you 1 bump for certain amount of time.  No fancy code but not sure if it opens exploits for no collision
---
I dont think you understand how fleet comms works
---
It is literally not that easy.
---
And you'll also need more cyno pilots.
---
That's not what he's talking about, he means the volume of the activation as well as the volume of the ambiance being poorly balanced
---
when the first loki loads grid the caedes is going 1800. i presume the caedes pilot did not have his prop mod on to track and kill ASAP. then a cyno goes up, you see his speed go from 1800 to 2800m/s and fast so still plenty more to give, then he is triple webbed. TRIPLE webbed and sort of stabilizes at 400m/s, id say he was overheating his life out of that prop mod.
---
This is really in depth, thank you. The treaties between EVE entities are probably similar to international law, and I'm guessing have an equally spotty record of enforcement. Also, if you are interested in how the game mechanics form law, check out Lessig's free work 'Code Version 2.0' ([http://codev2.cc/](http://codev2.cc/))- the mechanics are actually closer to the laws of nature in real life. EVE might be a bit different though as it has its council. 
---
I see what you mean - the rules in corps are really more like the regulation of activities between individuals taking part in a shared venture. Are there any rules applied by groups over specific territory (like CVA in providence) - I heard the Imperium had considered implementing tithing agreements of some kind?
---
It's literally something two interns can do in two months. Complete with going over every fix PvE spawn and decreasing the amount of NPCs that spawn(since these changes would make them much stronger &amp; to not flood the market with new 50% drop rate modules)
---
He's a bit of a maniac, but a strangely loveable one. I'll definitely take an in-depth look - RP is one of the strongest 'glues' in these games that can overcome the strongly anarchistic bent of most players.
---
NO, he is saying that your content is boring and not worth their effort.   You may want to rant over that fact with hisec insult garbage but you made yourself look stupid.
---
Id use is as the wh exploration version of the orca
---
Selfie of a minmatarr ship with the amarr fleet behind it. Brave lil ship.
---
Actually they are used for supers and titans. They are super cheap and you can use their SMA. 
---
Other than that, a cool and fun ship for mission running if you dont care for being super efficient.
---
man this is genius
---
well. if your following say 'big group 1's rules' your more than likely just taken thier name as your own.
---
there are corperations in game
---
and alliances in game (officially)
---
so a small group (no alliance but own own corperation name) are happy to follow big group rules. they join the 'alliance' through a mechanic in the game that shows everone they fly that flag.
---
in lowsec/moreso hisec. a small group enforce thier rules on just random groups or people in 'thier area' that they claim to be thier only by player words, no ingame way of truly owning hisec area
---

---
Wow, I have to say the variety of playstyles in EVE is pretty fantastic. Looks like they have something similar to a code of practice for certain professions
---
Awesome man, thanks! So it's mainly a collective decision making process? Also, if it would be alright, could I PM you to ask some more questions? I'd like to compare it with the actual law pirate ships used to implement
---
Add this xyz person to watchlist. He is your master-FC and anchor.
---
Sub-FC¬¥s listen to FC comms and do what Master-FC does. If needed relay some info to the monkeys.
---
Thanks for flying with "Master-FC Airlines" in this fleet wich could have been more fun but fleet fight got made more of a logistical challenge thanks to reddit.
---
The IQ one would need to have for a statement such as this. Maybe limit the number of people you can have in corporations aswell along with how many groups you can color blue. Surely this would make a difference
---
queue nauros (or however you spell it)  telling people that it is their fault for listening to the pings.
---
Interesting - I see the possibility of Alts makes things even more complicated
---
So why not get rid of Fleet and just fly 1000 man fleet solo and in kitchen sink üëç
---
That pretty sums it up - can I quote you!
---
What is dead may never die
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/79081210/

If it's this one, you just seal clubbed a smaller group, -10 WH Coin.

128 limit would be pretty dope :)

A least you died to a player :)

AAR I took my L4 missions golem for a spin after a long break. Missclicked and didn't deactivate the bastion module in time to gtfo.... Never drink and drive ;)
---
Well listen up buttercup, you cane to eve and its a game centered around pvp. Not making you feel safe and cozy. The game needs to go back where anoms spawn after DT and ded are scannable sites only, or local and cynos go bye bye. You want a game where you need consent to pvp, go play wow
---
Nice haul! 
---
However as player who often runs spy alts I really don‚Äôt understand why you needed the 10 months back story on your alt. I rarely struggle to get a spy in an alliance, in fact my regular spy alts have all done AWOXING in the past yet still get in alliances easily enough.
---
It has some niche uses, but really benefit from being in a fleet.
---
If you're just running missions they can be fun.
---
They are fairly pretty.
---
add  projectile need a clear line of sight to hit the target and we can get this shit started
---
The thing that most annoys me with the trig invasions is that it is very harsh on new miners.
---
Using a venture it can be quite hard to get out when they show up, even in non trig space, without being destroyed or sustaining significant armour and hull damage.
---
Obviously, you can do better by adding shield extenders and other defensive modules, but most new players either don't know about them or have the skills to use them effectively.
---
This effectively makes the mining career impossible to get into without doing hundreds of mining agent missions on repeat until you can move into a barge, or moving into it from another career.
---
This is assuming they can make npcs fly ships that are built like player ships. Even diamond rats aren't proper ships as you have listed here. They just took the stats and abilities of ships fitted as such and transposed them onto npcs.
---
If they didn't even fit the athanor properly is it even really that big of a loss?
---
Yeah it's funny that highsec invasion/incursion fleets are a thing but null is all about soloing/multi-boxing/cap farming. Kind of why the crazy swapping high and null idea that gets thrown around is so curious. It really does feel like HS is more like ns used to be (before the cap umbrella age), and NS is what high sec used to be.
---
I‚Äôm returning to Eve after a five year hiatus. I‚Äôve seen plenty of trash talk directed at those skill injector things but I still have no idea why they‚Äôre so reviled. Could someone please fill me in?
---
And what is the practical difference?
---
(And I seriously doubt diamond ships are in any way based on real ships)
---
Didn't they ban be tires from plexed?
---
So it did get A change.
---
If you use the Reddit app, it's easy enough
---
well yeah the point is to heat before getting caught
---
Hi, can you bring also to attention of relevant team that lowsec is missing gate to Stain? Thx
---
true, fast frigate should be able to escape. and to be fair it did, if it was not against a triple skirmish link, dual sebo triple web loki thats literally only good for catching fast frigates.
---
fair play to those who caught him, not takin that from them. they did it and did it with the required ships. but i think being what? 37km away from the loki that landed and still being pointed and triple webbs has to suck ass.
---
Surely that's what injectors are for
---
Hey rats can scram and point you and they will not get concorded!       
---
Players are 9th class citizens in New Eden.
---
Everything in system was low power, there were fuel blocks in one of the structures so its safe to say the group had quit playing.
---
1) remove jump freighters from the game, allow pilot to remap skill points elsewhere.     
---
Alliance logistics used to be a group thing, organizing a defense fleet and scouts, securing a logistics route, chance to gank enemy alliance logistics fleets. Used to lead to tons of fighting and tons of PvP content. It would also perhaps break up the mega Blocs as they couldn't just have freighter monkeys bouncing back and forth all day. Resupply and sell off used to be a group activity with a chance of PvP that actually has a point, and something to lose.      
---
2) spool timers on Cyno's. Was mentioned in the big Reddit suggestion thread. Only one ship can jump through per x amount of time. Dropping your cap umbrella would need other subcaps to go defend the cyno lighter while you jump in your caps.    
---
3) massive changes to sov and structures/timers. Need to be much now vulnerable and destroyable. Impossible to take ns space in any meaningful way at the moment. Lots of newer HS/ls corps and alliances would love a chance to carve out some null. There is no point to even try right now. No one can beat a test/goon/ect super fleet dropping on your face.     
---
Null sec is broken. Cap superiority is broken. It's boring. Everything is too easy. Resources need to be depleted from a system and force you to spread out. JFs make logistics living in the lowest fringe truesec systems we are all supposed to be warring over to easy to farm. The big suggestions thread from earlier this week by that goon had a bunch of great ideas to fix null.     
---
Basically roll back most of the changes to null of the last several years. Highsec and lowsec are good right now I think. As are wormholes (significant risk comes with living in one, no local, an opening can pop to anywhere, no asset safety).
---
They are in fact, the biggest thing is tho that they don't respond to scrams (scrams don't stop them from MWDing) and they don't have cap (so things like Guristas Ospreys don't have cap transmitters and don't need to cap chain to keep repping.)
---
Don't make me dig up their stats and try to achieve them in pyfa using same hulls
---
There are things directors can deal on their own (like stepping into a fight between members or asking someone to calm down, be more polite or such), or take emergency measures like kicking someone on the spot if there is an immediate threat of some kind.
---
Besides that we have internal channels where whoever picked up on the problem lets the rest of leadership know what happened and what was done or proposes something to do; we dedicate whatever time is needed according to the issue (from lenghty debates to "yeah, well done!") and them take action.
---
Usually things go: warning &gt; "are you stupid? I warned you already about this" &gt; kick out of corp &gt;&gt; "We are gonna burn everything you own and make your life (in game) as misserable as possible until we get bored of poking your corpse". Depending on the gravity of the situation.
---
And sure, feel free to PM me.
---
Oh,here we go,as the saying goes: The major Chinese problem lies not so much in foreign invasion as in its internal strife.
---
TL;DR:          
---
Give others easy kills.
---
How?
---
Fill the UI team with people that actively play. Or, at least, ask people that do. 
---
* Fix the default overview. It has been bad since before I was even born and multiple ***MUCH*** better versions exist within the community.
---
* The repair and insurance menu should only show relevant ships. So ones with broken parts and no insurance respectively
---
* The "Fleet" and "Corporation" buttons should be on the default sidebar.
---
* Playing with a big screen is... weird. If I play in 3840x2160 all my UI scaling fucks up and is super tiny. Using the dedicated UI scaling option is finicky. This is more of a nitpick but I think it should happen automatically.
---
* Less of a problem with the 64-bit client, but there should be a button to put all options to minimal (i.e. potato mode) instantly.
---
* Some options aren't self-explanatory and aren't explained either. What does "Auto-Target Back" do? Is it just a free Automated Targeting unit?
---
* A search option for the hotkey menu would make it much easier to use.
---
* The market could use some decluttering. For example "Ships", "Ship Equipment", "Ship and Module Modifications" and "Ammunition and Charges" could be combined into a "Ships and Fittings" folder. The several sub-folders of those categories could also use overhauling. Why are all types of modules just listed and not broken up into, say, high, mid and low slots? There should also be some naming consistency. Why is it called "Ship Equipment" and not "Modules"? Why is it "Ships" and not "Hulls"?
---
* It shouldn't take a few seconds to open menus.
---
I think he was, but i think when the players did the same towards CCP.      
---
Finance people didn't like being uncertain if they will have enough cash to pay for the bills or not.
---
Stain relics are main source for intact plates in New Eden.
---
Yeah ok but how is 1 person responsible for 1/3rd of the whole supply? Is he using bots or what?
---
Bittervets are salty because injectors let new players catch up to skills they spent time training so they aren't the only people who can fly Titans any more.
---
why not just fit some tank?  you can tank most BRs easy to take 3 nados to  gank which is gambling at that point since the nados are more than just the BR hull
---
Don't worry i won't, [because it's already been done.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Forward_Operating_Base)
---
Maybe not for every single individual diamond rat but enough to convince you hopefully.
---
Skill injectors allow you to instantly fly any ship in the game. 
---
Before injectors it took months or years \*) to train into a viable super, titan, or rorqual.  
---
Now, with the help of a credit card, or a good business plan, anyone can create an army of rorqual miners, super ratting chars and so on. 
---
Now many believe that this broke the end game; and further increased the distance between people actually playing the game and the nullsec power blocks (assuming there is still more than one).
---
\*) a long time
---
&gt;I think plex buy receipts count for that just like GM interactions.
---
Complete nonsense.
---
Jesus this was 3 months ago. You stalking my post history? lol
---
Haha nailed it
---
No
---
RMTing botters slapfighting RMTing botters, EVE 2k19
---
Years of practice.
---
Aom is far newer than wc, give them time and they'll be fighting for that top spot.
---
If you got smartbombed mid warp, dont cry because your ship is gone , but smile because it happend. Its an art of killing on the brink of extinction. I have only seen it once beeing pulled off with reliable success and im smartbombing a lot. If you get pissed so much by that i bet you have a real joy when you do it to others, at least i had/have.  Got my ass beaten by the rancer pipe bomb camp in the early days..now im laughing at these guys.
---
mumble was choppy for me without VPN. Dotlan never loaded properly without it. I could barely get discord working even with the VPN.
---
This is some serious bullshit.
---
Remove all standings on top of that! This would be fun!
---
discord never really worked well for me, even on the vpn. I had to use the browser version. the app wouldn't load.
---
Also KWG just bought PLEX to pay TEST ... the 18 Nyxes in Omist and 300 Gilas in Feyth did nothing wrong ...
---
How is Endgener. Corp, TESTs newest aquisition of "active" players doing ?
---
You cant add someone not in fleet to watchlist
---
&gt;  They were the most famous RMT and botting group at that time, and it was AOM who defeated them. 
---
So,that's the reality edition:"Dragon Slayer Finial Becoming A Dragon"?
---
Google smartbombs
---
They are used to it for years now, thinking of the hundreds of Bots that KWG had running in Legacy space
---
reminder about the need of removal of the 3 minute warp out timer
---
Major changes; renew EVE and makes EVE interesting; for the community.
---
It‚Äôs fairly trivial to just run more fleets and relay targets.
---
That character had no shield skills. Couldn't even fit a medium t1 extender.
---
Ah, I see the potential issues. Thanks for the explanation.
---
This cannot be true, honourable Legacy would never admit RMT and botting in their ranks.
---
Also nice how AOM now tries to build the narrative, that FRT were the worst RMTers, while in fact its the huge pile-up of PIBC (AOM/PLA on Serenity) that crashed Serenity Eco with their RMTing ...pathetic ... I mean nice roleplay of koolaid drunk hypocrites ...
---
Higsec piracy is dead unless this is niarja and uedama and you are unlucky to move when fleet is formed.           
---
The same for higsec freighter industry.
---
This is so accurate it fucking hurts.
---
They are quite flexible, yet niche ships.
---
- they can be used as fleet support (massive amount of remote repairs, the only battleship-sized logistics, the smallest ship which allows others to refit)
---
- they can be used as combat ships (drone damage + some guns/neuts), although quite weak. But:
---
- they have low mass (low enough for unplated fit to pass through class 1 wormholes), which indeed makes them appealing choice for some wormhole action
---
&lt;3     
---
My man.       
---
Putting 9b in a hauler and undocking it in jita !        
---
If we only had more people like you.
---
You would be surprised how well the entities respect the treaties, at least among the larger ones, especially the ones that are still extant. Aside from the non aggression pacts of course, those gets broken all the time with one side claiming the other violating it (so even that needs some sort of justification). For agreements involving compensation, the smaller the entity the more likely they will backtrack on their agreements; for larger entities, they usually got what they want on both sides anyway. In general, agreements between large blocs are probably as well enforced as the WW1 Treaty of Versailles.
---
Thanks for the link, will take a look later.
---
There are rules within groups that are geographically dependent. For example, the *renter alliances/corps* are people who pay rent for exclusive ratting rights in certain systems and limited access to security/local infrastructure. In return, the landlord alliance will renounce their right to rat (kill NPCs for money) in those territories. Other examples include that alliances may assign certain territories special status and disallow their members to do specific things inside it, for example, building structures without the alliance leadership's approval. The Ochre rule, a rule that certain types of ore must be mined first before miners can mine others, is sometimes only applied in a few constellations in some alliances as well.
---
There are no rules enforced by a group to their enemies, aside from whatever the game mechanics allow. In reality, this mean "shoot 'em when they enter our sov". The tithing system is called "Viceroy program" or something and was essentially Imperium's attempt on imposing its will on some lowsec regions; I was AFK when that happened, so I don't know the details of it, but I would imagine it probably involves Imperium fleets smashing nonconforming entities. It backfired, and the results slowly led us to today.
---
The usual Internet-culture equation of "something I don't like very much and/or a mild inconvenience" with "life-destroying disease causing immense suffering for large numbers of people". OP doesn't like skill injectors.
---
Could they hold their own in a fight just in case im attacked buy player pirates?
---
Blob fleets are like 8 people lol
---
Put blasters on a naga
---
you are trolling right? i bet my left testicle, 75% of all injectors bought, are bought by vets injecting toon number gazillionthousand, for another rorq, carrier,jf..or nowadays a new cyno toon.
---
and the newbros  u expect to buy all the injectors...they inject into battleships maybe.and then they waste their credit card on plex to get isk to max bling out their ships..and then feed them constantly.....
---
Or create constraints within which to min max.
---
"How can I make the best kiting battlecruiser"
---
Well played.
---
And here I thought it was MY fault new players quit, since that's what everyone always says.
---
Skill Injectors. REEEEEEEEEE
---
ill do what i want
---
Best meme in a long time.
---
Absolutely beautiful
---
I think people overstate this stuff. You get these agreements yes but there's no legislative or enforcement body. They're always between two parties enforced by "what you gonna do about it?" and the damage to your reputation.
---
Well there are persons that are responsible for 70%+ of all moongoo supply on the market, so 1/3 of 1 single item is not extreme.
---
Tbh for that moongoo oligarchy it took 40k+ brainless lemmings to fuel his ponzi scheme ...
---
it's probably a rough translation of a chengyu, which are hard as fuck to translate properly
---
Small guns on battleships can be good fun. Or rocket bombers.
---
That'd be the end of flying logi though I think, since good luck repping anything without a watchlist or broadcasts. And what about cyno mechanics? Or "warp to fleet member" type stuff? 
---
Also I think people could just anchor up as usual, get a specific overview setup and sort by range/name/type to switch it up to avoid spy shit as much as possible. Tidi fights would become even slower since targets wouldn't die as efficiently but it definitely isn't going to stop big blobs from being blobs
---
You still need fleetwarps logi broadcasts and anchors.
---
Damn I forgot that, good point!
---
No worries, I'm always happy to hear constructive criticism. At the end of the day it's always going to be a balancing act between trying to make the content more 'engaging' and bringing in my own personal opinions/commentary, or having it be a more scholarly look at exactly what happened, as different segments of my audience enjoy different things there. 
---
My main goal really is to make sure I never feel like I'm "filling air" which is something I personally see as a problem in TiS/Meta Show/other "Talk Show" based EVE content.
---
ok so for you is everyone who participate on fleet a f1 monkey ... like dude, wtf
---
and your idea is stupid, as less people in fleet will lead in bigger demand to people's time as more have to be FC's and prepare before fleet etc. EVE is not a fucking job, it's a game, deal with it
---
My first big loss was a badly fit rattlesnake. I didn‚Äôt understand that rats could warp disrupt. Gj for having fun and not getting angry.
---
as a viewer (you do way better than i would do trust me i admit that) but as a viewer SOMETIMES your videos do fill like the 'filling air' thing is happening, not sure if its speed, or the freqencey of comedy. but each to thier own.
---
Exactly!
---
Geez man I'm just memeing
---
Oh I don't disbute this would be annoying to adapt to, but the overall comms issue if what to primary ect ect wouldnt be overly impacted.  This puts more strain on getting logi/ support ships for each fleet thsn on the overall command of the fleet(s)
---
That which is easy to conceptualise is rarely easy to implement. Literally the first rule of programming.
---
Why let other people dictate how you have fun?
---
Lol no.
---
As someone has pointed out these things are killing people as they undock before they can warp in rookie ships... all that teaches you is that logging in was a mistake.
---
well you were dabbling in a very advanced topic so i assumed laziness as I do with everyone :))) 
---
pyfa is a fitting utility - you should check it out it's pretty useful. 
---
https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases
---
Wormholes are the future.
---
Just find yourself a nice little hangout and let the null blue donut collapse in on itself
---
I don't disagree with your general point, but this comes across less like a cogent airing of grievances and more like a really petty ramble with no real purpose.
---
If you bought the p1 mats to turn them into p4. 8b. So I see it as 2b 'profit' or 10b revenue. 
---
The effort?
---
5 hours per week. If I spent that time super ratting I would make less than 1/10th the isk.
---
for some people is grinding the "fun" for some is loosing shit not a big deal and some of them "shine" with podkills ... everybody is different but OP has got a point.
---
Issue is in fact eve is n+1 type of game, so your time spend on trying to kill shit is greatly wasted when you deal with n+1 blobsing everywhere. Even so there are people to give hones 1v1 but to find those is harsh.
---
the only lesson being taught to the players getting killed doing the new guy missions by god like rats is they would be better off playing something else.
---
It wasn't good in the pre-Phoebe-Time when PanFam instaprojected acroos the whole map ... It is not good now when weaponized pve-autism is the only I-Win-Button ... cyclejerking about that now makes you look equal to PanFam guys helicopterdicking forums in 2013 .... just saying ...
---
Dotlan didn't work for me when i was in china too, but mumble worked fine lol
---
\&gt;  Our was war with WinterCo had kicked off again, I decided to try and get  a spy into WC. I‚Äôll keep how I did to myself in case I do this again. 
---
"Hey (Director), I have been playing this game for x time in highsec but it's pretty boring lolsmileyface.  Would like to try out life in a nullsec Alliance and I saw you guys openly recruiting on the EVE-O forums so assumed you were the softest target in your Alliance."
---
It's not rocket science.
---
CCP will deal with the bot issue. not your complaint
---
The safest way to transfer wealth is either ejecting exploration loot or plex.
---
Exploration loot isnt recorded, and plex you can always be like "lol just worked overtime and bought some"
---
A thorough comb of esis will show you have possession of a new ship hull you neither purchased nor built.
---
They nerfed PIRAT's playstyle, had to find a new way to make the game toxic to newbros.
---
I've started messing around with utility mods (not just highs) and honestly it feels like i'm flying my own ship rather than generic explorer #312. It's much more interesting when you can act in unexpected ways, it's potentailly new teritory for your targets, less muscle memory . Sure, you lose a bit of DPS but more of New Eden opens up to you when you're fit to engage with it.
---
[Check out this EveAltruist article](http://www.evealtruist.com/2012/04/risk.html)

That's really it, unfit ventures were everywhere.
---
imagine getting so triggered at realising your in the number 1 botting alliance
---
Or, I don't know, just spitballing here, maybe go play better games instead
---
I've been saying this since these stupid randomly spawning trigs started. They are doing far more harm to the noobie community than anyone but all anyone focused on was the blackout. The randomly spawning Raznaborg are absolutely devastating the highsec community especially new players that have zero ability to do anything about these.
---
Killboards need to die.
---
Its been reported and brought to their attention several times. This has been happening since these were implemented and the new player community is getting hit hard.
---
Yeah I run 15 orcas afk in high sec. About 1-2b a day.
---
"inactive corp wormhole" - the excuse for evicting any corp ever.  
---
Go ahead and start a new thread complaining about how low J-Space activity is and that more corps should join J-Space :\^) delusional mfkers
---
These Raznaborg spawns have been absolute cancer since they were implemented. The only people seriously affected are the new players that have no ability to do anything about them.
---
remember when you flew with test and were cool? :(
---
It was a better game then, and test were the cool guys :(
---
&gt;will ESI display if i aid alt with ships/modules/loot throught ejecting from ship [freighter] then board [freighter] with omega alt and sell it? or transfer that way ships for missions,exploration,mining?
---
I've been out of the game for a while so take this with some salt, but *no*.
---
Here's the thing: A freighter suddenly appearing on your alt's wallet history as sold raises just as many red flags.
---
Try plex. AFAIK your irl purchase history is sacrosanct - if you say you bought them to sell, they can't tell otherwise.
---
This was pretty funny, but I was a little concerned when you kept wiping your eyes with the napkin.
---
Can I have some bils
---
&gt;all it takes is writing style analysis. Larger the sample the better.
---
If you can find a person who can competently do that you can find a person to run as director for your alliance holding corp with 100% trust, tbh.
---
They're much rarer.
---
Once it took you 20yrs to learn everything..  now its 20hours
---
It would certainly be nice for CCP to do ANY DEVELOPMENT WORK WHAT SO EVER.
---
No ship can hold against undefined amount of player pirates, and Nestor is not an exclusion. It is mildly tanky and its offensive capabilities are also quite average. So if you want to do that - there're better ships for this job, e.g. hyperion.
---
Create an alpha and see how far you can get without buying anything. That was loads of fun.
---
no mobile depot in your cargo? shameful
---
Memes aside it's what I used to recommend.  You'll build a killboard activity sufficient to pass most corps standards, get the skills to fly most brain-dead mainstream doctrines for your true end target Alliance, and you'll learn the kinds of information your handlers/FCs want to know and what to filter out. 
---
You can of course throw all that out to the wind if you are a verifiable girl.  Free pass.
---
Anyone who has experience in 0.0 knows TEST and WinterCo are both as guilty as possible with botting. For fuck sakes TEST is not only protecting AOM (new huge botters) but XIX and their pets (the old huge botters). KWG had several people leak how they were botting and they just kept on going.
---
I wish blackout was still around as the was the only thing that had a noticeable affect on botters. Lets be real though CCP doesn't care about the economy anyone so you might as well just bot like everyone else.
---
Go for it
---
CCP data states otherwise.           
---
FRT and NCPL are the biggest boters/RMT and harborers of those kind of 'players' in New Eden.   
---
[Unless you can prove otherwise based on CCP data - this is the current data from CCP we got](https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/whogetsbanned.jpg)

**This is hard data not players speculations**

dude why are you so fucking triggered 24/7 atm lmao you used to be cool

I approve of this post.

&gt;	how else can you fit your Talos with neuts?

[That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying since 2012!](https://zkillboard.com/kill/24184634/)
---
Imagine thinking the CSM has any power whatsoever and exists in a capacity more than just a made up position to stroke the players into thinking they have a real representative.
---
Most definitely tied to POS code and cannot be changed.
---
&gt; Yeah now you need alts for other things
---
You probably needed them for those things before as well, except overall level of play was way lower back then, not being optimal in everything wasn't critical, personal wealth on average was lower and people weren't expected to run things they are expected to run these days etc...
---
&gt; null sec is still shit
---
For different reasons I'd say.
---
&gt; And in the eyes of the Devs if they knew what we were doing to make isk they would try and 'fix' it. But the CCP Devs are clueless.
---
Or maybe they aren't actually out to get you, considering how easy for them it would be to see where you money and stuff comes from if they cared.
---
I won't argue that. I'd rather have real good fights, win or lose, than hell dunks or blue balls.
---
All of the structures were low powered I think thats fair to say they were inactive right?
---
It's beautiful to witness this pilgrimage, but comparably nasty to be pilgrimated tbph

He should have heated the instant he was pointed and before the cyno

Reddit for me is like that ex gf you keep coming back to once a month to get some bent up emotions out
---
Except that its like daily for me. I swear im not like this in person/comms lmao
---
&gt; Before injectors it took months or years *) to train into a viable super, titan, or rorqual.Now, with the help of a credit card, or a good business plan, anyone can create an army of rorqual miners, super ratting chars and so on.
---
I would say that's not so much breaking the game by itself as it ensures that balance issues are instantly impactful. But creating some "endgame" which isn't balanced just by SP holding people back in a sandbox game is... problematic, to say the least.
---
Look how big that Goons slice is lmao botterz\~\~
---
I'd be down for this
---
Sadly apart from doing missions in a few systems per NPC region there is too little consistent opportunity for PvE (except for mining moons). NPC 0.0 space should be considered ADM 4 (for PvE only) internally and stuff should spawn accordingly. Players would not be able to influence ADM but have stuff to do... maybe that would help NPC 0.0 a little bit.
---
ty v much...didnt reach 200killmarks :)))
---
Both of them.
---
how much crystal meth rock must one snort in order to brain hemorrhage a post like this?
---
indeed i was...saw the cyno too late,i was busy switching ammo.noob mistake
---
Spai
---
my guess was ,at first was dbl webb...saw later on video 3 webs...once again was my late reaction to cyno that lead to killmail
---
yes, its common for pilots in high dps kiting ships, to get close to really finish the job. in my head you were half way through this manuever when the cyno dropped, and it took a few seconds to actually notice he had lit.
---
you were using the ship. hope you had fun with it.

I like how the Royal guard is Proud of its Capital industrial ships

If I buy blueprints in the market, those blueprints are original or copies? The info window doesn't show any info related to this. How can I know if the blueprint I'm buying is BPO or BPC? If it's BPC, how many times can I use it?

dual web is enough for the loki to catch you, at least to your own web range. triple web your basicly not moving its like a 97.8% web total putting 3x fed navies together i think pyfa said a couple years ago when i looked
---
So you're saying botters are fine if they are a product of their surroundings?
---
It's fairly capable of decomposing and stinking though.
---
Choo choo, Laser-Rokh!
---
There is no better game than small corp wormhole industry and PVP.
---
Well lets ignore the obvious issues with the data first, like a quarter of those alliances got closed like 5 years ago ( Which is extremly scary to think that they are still in this list, suggesting they were massive{I dont even recognize half of those but v0v} OR that CCP really doesnt ban that many people)
---
But ok, so currently: The biggest offenders xXDeathXx and Solar, for a long time Panfam associated, are in Legacy now. Add to that Red, KWG and Wings which are all part of or collapsed into legacy , youd realize that, while we cant say for sure if they are still botting or not, as the data provided is historical, we can absolutly say that a SIGNIFICANT portion of the previously heavily botting alliances are in legacy now.
---
So the only thing your "hard data" proves is what players were speculating anyways: Every alliance is involved.
---
&gt; https://evepraisal.com/a/np4x6 JSV 64.22bn JBV 41.71bn
---
If those are all fully researched 10/20s (which I suspect they are) those values are understated by nearly half. Those appraisals are at NPC seed value when they're 0/0 research.  After getting to 10/20, they're worth roughly 1.55x - 1.80x more.
---
mate is just pixels after 14 years in game im not mad at all for the loss...happy i lost it to competent pilots...in the past i amost lost the ship on gate 2 rats going afk and 1 time to a blue munnin with shit overview
---
SE was released alongside the 6S so it fits that category. Not surprising they would boast better compatibility with iDevices than the fragmented mess that is Android compatibility...
---
You can't cargo scan blockade runners. So shooting every1 you can and hope for jackpot is the only way.
---
you had more fun with it than most people do with thier titans (priced the same) so its for sure win win.
---
plus you were lucky number sleven to loose one.  o7
---
Like if we only had new data - aka what happened since then we could see top offenders.
---
Correct...but let's be real here, if you're running a massive RMT bot farm via Alphas, you're probably not too concerned with the whole EULA violation on the VM shenanigans...
---
Now i know why intacts are spiking recently.
---
Maybe ;) seeing two whales slowly killing each other could be fun XD
---
Fascinating. Are you referring to the Technetium cartel?
---
Signal Cartel is well respected, and it's frowned upon (though not enforced) to kill them while on their apointed rounds.
---
This data doesnt show what you claim, but who am I kidding this is r/eve so who cares.
---
after blackout they went down...eve become a boring game,with sources of content beeeing nerfed along the years.biggest shit ever was citadels
---
Good catch and from the looks of the dark blue... that might actually be a BPO... unless EVE Praisal can't tell the dif between BPCs and BPOs from the text copypasta... /u/Cab-Ron
---
I heard WHSOC was a bunch a krabbers that would rather mine then pvp.
---
I don't know how you run fleets. But in general I have more then 5 people busy doing stuff on fleets and think on there own. From FC, target caller, backseat, dic/hic pilots, scouts, logi anchor(s), recon, spy's, organizer for the boosts and not to forget hackers in a enthosis op. 
---
They should make fleets bigger imho. Not smaller ;)
---
Thats quite a leap. I'm saying CCP still hasn't done anything to address the ease of botting and this has resulted in mass botting throughout most of 0.0.
---
Makes you wonder since the early career missions are largely brain dead easy
---
KWG was a rental alliance, as in people just paid to be there.  Before we got involved they absolutely catered towards botters.  After we took over from the previous ownership, we gutted the program and removed any bots that we found (mirroring the policy of our other rental alliance that didn't even make the list of botting alliances, despite being almost as old as fraternity's who was #1).  We simply reused the shell because it was a trusted name in the renting community.  If you have any actual evidence someone is botting, please forward it to CCP, then me so I can kick them while CCP is investigating.
---
The average line member has no trustworthy source of information against which to check what they are heading from leadership. Not one that feels like it is worth reading at least.
---
Ahhh rumors. Gotta love'm.
---
No            
---
To fix NPC :                                 
---
* make Null stations bonuses similar to T1 rigged EC ^(new people can move in and get good bonuses without private structures, but still can upgrade if they wish to)                     
---
* remove burner missions or introduce new usefull items to LP stores ^(npc null stores is mostly T2 implants - so small market, or ships if they are op - like guristas)                         
---
* increase combat signature spawns in NPC nullsec ^(all people can come , search and run those so people living have double bonus hunting the sites and people that run them)              
---
* boost belt ratting or anomaly ratting in NPC space - aka one completed in NPC nullsec have like 80% to give you escalation ^(so more people move in or are willing to come and do those)                 
---
* Fix logistics issues for areas like Stain or Venal (best examples) huge regions without access from lowsec. Not healthy thing after all changes over all those years. People need to have ability to move in or out fast, even if this will be ceptors or blockade runners.
---
"so you might as well just bot like everybody else." is your closing statement. You are thereby encouraging people to bot even if it is as part of a statement in which you are venting frustration.
---
webs do have stacking penalty, 2 60% webs reducing the speed down to 20%, 3 webs - about 13%
---
correct. your point? did you (unlike me) bother to pyfa the true web amount with 3 60% webs? im pretty sure it was around high 90's. it was a long time ago i looked
---
We're already very good at exploiting any balance topics. Making us faster in doing that only makes the whole system less stable.
---
As long as many aspects of the game scale linearly or more, the winning strategy is n+1
---
just run your own bots and put your alliance on a level playing field, duh
---
bill pls
---
Undertale memes. Truly a man of culture with the dankest memes.
---
&gt;if you are a verifiable girl
---
Do traps count? :p
---
Wew.. show us on the doll where big bad Vily touched you ;)
---
I think its common knowledge that every alliance with a renter program has a lot of bots associated with them (mostly in those renter groups). I dont think AOM pays rent, but accepting KWG-money was probably getting too "hot" for TEST leadership and so AOM was a good alternative...
---
Yep.       
---
CCP biggest mistake was to remove NPC stations from null regions.       
---
Like if we could have those stations CCP could move there all assets from removed structures and freeport those stations making them neutral.             
---
Now it will be nightmare to remove structures in any way ... as where you move people assets.         
---
I seen good idea on r/eve.        
---
Make all taxes region wide so people don't drop raitaru in each system to get the lower tax.
---
Also test are infact little gaybois and it makes angerey
---
I still want the "last year only" that he promised too
---
lmfao this retard slapfight
---
The fire is already nice and toasty,  we don't need more petrol on it
---
Well as much as I want to hate them they are just trying to survive in their country. If you think about it they probably make more farming isk than they would working. It's literally their job. You're not going to stop them. #thefreemarketprovides

---
Yep, this is what i hoping to get.
---
You must have a hard on for Legacy. And still provided zero proof except hearsay and conjecture that ‚Äúmaybe Legacy leadership‚Äù this and that....
---
Quick history lesson for ya bud. KWG has been in the south even before Legacy invaded and took space from their Stainwagon overlords. They‚Äôre not Legacy proper and nobody really gives a shit about them in Legacy. They simply paid for blue status to whichever power bloc was occupying the south at that given time.
---
That‚Äôs the nature of renter organizations. They have zero loyalty to any group and will happily pay the next power bloc that comes along so they can stay in said space.
---
Good thing KWG is pretty much dead now so we can stop talking about a non-Legacy entity that really didn‚Äôt matter.
---
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Well i am sure others who are more clever then me will find a way to work around.
---
how do you get that perfect alignment?
---
Its a no-win situation. You either decide to accept bots and compete with other entities on a level playing field (because people are already doing it. Or you accept you have to fight people that have literal endless isk where as you just dont. 
---
Competitive people will always default to option 1, people with cleaner morals may go with 2. Either way everyone loses because ccp cant/wont deal with how rampant botting is.
---
you said 3 webs have the strength of 97.8%, thats 5 times more than it is. thats all i wanted to point out.
---
Like why not.      
---
There is plenty of dead groups here if we can get the same graph but based on the data that happened since the initial release we will see where people bot and what alliance is doing the most harm to the game.          
---
If this lead to someone deploying against someone or like 95% of hunters moving to some area to kill botters **i am all behind this actions**                
---
While only CCP can ban bots and RMT'ers - alliances that invite this kind of players should be also hold responsible if not by CCP then by other players.              
---
Like trust me if some alliance will invite well known botting corp ^(like honestly it is known) and then suffer from players constantly raiding it space for months ... no other group will accept botters again.
---
What happened to the CCP rhetoric that any alliance found knowingly harbouring bots etc would be punished too.   This has NEVER happened.  Why CCP?
---
Ask Elo
---
They are go√≤d in wormholes due to their remote repair bonus and good resists. Flying it on its own will get you killed
---
They're NPC's , they never move all day every day.
---
A group isn't going to start a war because of a team security pie chart lmao
---
It happened. Some alliances got neg wallets.         
---
The main problem is that CCP cannot disband alliance if they found botting corp in it.          
---
A. Players cannot be sure if someone is botting and there are ways that players cannot detect it  ^(like simply botting corp active in different TZ)          
---
B. You cannot punish majority of innocent players in the alliance.         
---
But if we get this information ... like will you join alliance known for a huge bot bans?         
---
Will players hunt more in the area that is having huge number of bots?            
---
Will you do diplomatic deal with the botting alliance?         
---
Groups hosting botters will suffer in many way without much harm to the actual players done.
---
Oh I agree that CCP dealing with botting more effectively would be good. I just don't think encouraging people to bot when it *shouldn't* be happening is a valid choice.
---
I was pondering this yesterday. On Serenity given that botting was effectively ruled as legal does  that make the people who botted on Serenity bad? They definitely faced the scenario where not doing it was shooting yourself in the foot.
---
The problem is around adjusting behaviours of people who come from one game environment to one with different rules (all be it the same mechanics). The more we get wishy-washy about botting being bad on TQ the harder it is for them to make the effort to learn and adjust. It's a bit like helping addicts to quit.
---
my apologies, i have after this comment had a look (i did say it was a LONG time ago i looked)
---
but it is 2x vindi webs that web for 97.8%
---
and triple normal webs do web for 87.3%
---
Yep, that‚Äôs why XIX still controls the dronelands- whoops they don‚Äôt. Oh hey, and kids with guns got evicted. And B0T watched their space get burned by Unspoken and lazerhawks.
---
Guess money doesn‚Äôt do a very good job buying sov.
---
Never for the life of me will I understand why the hell they did that.
---
you forgot to say please and thanks...
---
Oh shit ok well let us know when your done.
---
I think at this point there is no higher authority on the subject than you
---
I would simply make it based on mass and tank.  If I outmass you and have a fitted tank and you run into me over a certain velocity you get take the hit.  If we are equal mass and we run into each other over the same relative velocity, we both take the hit.  I would say if you are fleeted, noone takes the hits.  Might be a good reason to bring back battleship meta and make them your circle of wagons against ramming attacks, or a new suicide bowling ball mechanism.  
---
As for who bumps whom, the server is already doing those calculations to determine what direction and how far ships move from collisions.
---
EAT MY ASS
---
I think the problem is he promised it, then looked at the data after, and it was like 60% frt, 30% NC/PL renters, 10% everyone else, and decided it was too "political" to release and then just hoped we'd forget about it.
---
Speaking of posting quality, what happened to Naz? While the content of his posts was rubbish he did at least make some effort to make them entertaining.
---
If you think that was about botting than a decade old grudge....
---
We might; you don't know what my kinks are
---
Yeah for real.
---
We really don‚Äôt want botters in Test.
---
Even thinking about it gives me an itchy trigger finger.
---
Increase fleet size to 500.
---
Bringing the chaos to high sec
---
Yeah, that should work nicely, but is probably way more work for CCP (and alll extra work is bad for them).
---
Gate to Stain would be nice. Gate to Venal i dont know, Venal is separated from Empire by normal 0.0, a direct gate to Venal would cross over that space, where in Stain there is a big empty corridor to empire, perfect for a gate connection.
---
Ah this was all we needed to prove it.  Thanks for finally sharing the missing link of info that ccp was needing to finally convict KWG, TEST and legacy. 
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll build you a statue or something!
---
Interesting. Especially the module "quality"
---
Hey all he needed was a good excuse
---
Quality that we need but not deserve on this subreddit
---
Dran blows them up with his own special diplo drop team, and none of us ever get in on the kills. He really should share.
---
Dont for get the Dark Ochre Rule.
---
Mine the dark ochre first, and then mine the rest of the belt. Cherry Pickers get DDd!
---
Did they finally move the Titans from Amarr that have been there for years since the last event?
---
Eject!!!
---
I put my application in for the firing squad months ago
---
If you link the killmail or the character name and we can look it up to help you with exactly what happened. You probably hit warp and didn't pay much attention because there's nothing to pay attention to really you just hit warp and wait... My best guess is that it takes probably 10 seconds from when you hit warp till you are actually IN warp. In that time, someone could lock you up, warp scramble you so you can't get away, and blow up your ship in 1 shot if you have no defense modules (tanky-ness).
---
no worries, i too did shout the wrong ansver in the math class in front of everyone being sure im right xd
---
Injectors are for people with no patience. See, I don't really mind the 80d queue to my Skiff (well its 80d because of other stuff), and I am not being ironic the least.
---
But for other people it's nice to have the option, and it's good money for both players and CCP :)
---
I only have injectors to give
---
LOL
---
you fucking wish
---
CCP, please stop it's your hurting the wrong people!
---
You can see by the fact that the Avatars have tasteful matching skins and not a horrible hodgepodge of colours.
---
please see disclaimer,
---
'' its **like** a 97.8% web total putting 3x fed navies together **i think** pyfa said **a couple years ago when i looked** ''
---
hey, after all that time not thinking about it, i remembered the vindi web amount! ill take that as a win.
---
if your going to get all smart with me boyo, you had 2x loki, so go on, tell me 6x fed navy webs are not 90 somthing % web :D
---
[removed]
---
Gee, at least use night mode, space is dark.
---
I'm fairly sure Darkness was red to me a couple of days ago. Are you sure we just don't hate you enough to help them if it means we get to kill you guys?
---
There is absolutely 0 desire to bash any structures in jspace from small corps unless they are low powered.
---
Fuel your shit and you are almost totally safe. (Unless you sit on valued real estate).
---
filthy krab doesn¬¥t even have camera shake disabled. disgustang!
---
Blueprints that are bought from the market (and not contracts !) will always be blueprints with zero TE and ME research done. The info windows actually shows you a lot of information about the blueprint you‚Äôre about to buy, but generally you can tell the difference between original and copies by the item‚Äôs picture. If the background if a very light blue, almost light grey/white, it‚Äôs a copy. Original have darker blue tones.
---
You cannot sell BPCs on the market, you have to go through the Contract systems, which is pretty good for BPCs if you know where to look at. When a BPC is posted as a contract, it will show the research done on it, and the number of runs.
---
Concerning the number of runs on a copy, it depends of its creator. If it‚Äôs a copy of a T1 BPO, the owner can decide the number of runs each copy will have when copying the original blueprint. Concerning T2 BPOs, I don‚Äôt remember it fully, but IIRC : it depends of the d√©crypter used when inventing the blueprint. It can range from one run, to multiple.
---
They did blackout lol null krabs screeched to hard tho so they can bot again
---
Thanks for the gold, capsuleer o7
---
Some guy sacrificed a Tornado worth 20 mil to steal over 700mil off you cause you hauled too much in a cheap ship and put 0 tank on it.
---
But what do they need all those Providence-class Freighters fo -- oh right, slaves.
---
Your best bet would be the Ivy League. It‚Äôs the alliance of EVE University, you‚Äôll be able to learn a lot from them.
---
If the "online numbers" drop down like with the blackout+cynochange, game is doomed. CCP would be worried as fuck if number is too big. So would be players in case they publish it.
---
&gt; We really don‚Äôt want botters in Test.
---
Yeah that's why they were in KWG lol
---
The freighters look more like badass warships than the Apocs do.
---
Skill injectors allow you to pay money for instant skill points so it enables botting and other shit nobody likes. Aside from that pretty much everything on this sub is nonsense garbage other than some memes. People said eve was dying and I shouldn't bother 4 years ago so its fine
---
Balls of rust
---
Stain is also separated by SOV space.      
---
For me stuff like NPC delve or NPC fountain (small space) separated is kind of ok, but stain and venal are just to big to be cut off so new people have hard times to get there even not mentioning moving some stuff into the area and out of it without a JF.
---
Fw is dead cause it hasnt changed in half a decade..oh just like everything else in eve. Ccp releases content and never updates it.
---
We have the same missions from 10 years ago. Wormholes havent reallly changed much directly (but have benefited from new content like PI).
---
Ccp is always releasing new shit like Trig invasions and ignoring old shit like Incursions.
---
Not only percenteages but also numbers.
---
In addition to how many botters game has, I'm concerned about how many individual warm bodies connect. Not account's but players or at least computers.
---
Why it is bad that i want new players to be able to move in out of area and that from time to time someone moved a (super)capital fleet by this gate to contest stuff like period basis, paragon soul or esoteria?
---
It was docking.
---
Overall it's pretty safe.
---
I do it fairly regularly.
---
It's hard to catch a blockade runner.
---
Pretty please!
---
One would think you know best
---
Guilty by association. The association here is Chinese.
---
Well goons based on this steam rolled north kicking NCPL from it.
---
what a noob
---
i dont need to sell the freighter and ships/loot from boarded ships,i can use them to build my wallet so  should be notthing?
---
&gt; As someone has pointed out these things are killing people as they undock before they can warp in rookie ships
---
I don't believe everything I read on the internet.
---
These also aren't even talking about rookie systems.
---
Nor does losing a rookie ship matter. Leave the system in your pod and get a new one.
---
That's just how EVE goes,  
---
You get another ship and a brand new clone.
---
You can ship scan though. But the chances of getting a lock on a blockade runner anywhere other then when landing outside the docking ring is basically impossible.
---
This is just to cut this kind of speculation.       
---
We get now security dev blogs so CCP have the data ready to create this summary quite easily.
---
Actually it is not.       
---
If botters are hurt and people who make botting easy then right people are getting hurt.
---
No, based on the same thing as the last 10 years, goons went and shot nc just like they always have done.
---
I played for 11 years, I quit right as they were about to add this crap. 
---
Never came back but still miss what was.
---
When did they remove NPC stations? The conquerable ones don't really count in this context.
---
Nothing is really wrong with them, there is just a wheel that people spin on what to complain about. Since blackout is gone this leaves a blank space on the wheel and the injector section was enlarged to fill that spot.
---
They count as they were conquerable NPC stations.      
---
Like 1 to 2 per region.          
---
Those were always special cases.
---
No. If you are attacked by someone in EVE you will probably die. It doesn't matter what ship you are in.
---
Devs dont disclose that information, at least from the MMO's I have played.
---
Ive seen hostile diamond rat frigate squads cheat and repeatedly warp to a kitey fit destroyer from 80-100km as said kitey fit was trying to burn clear of them. (Players cant warp to a target within 150km)
---
I happened to fly through one of these invasion clusters not long ago, the gate was littered with corvette wrecks lol.
---
&gt;Never not link the soundboard
---
Whoever made this was some kind of genius
---
How dare he not play like me.
---
The MSR will continue to give monthly updates on any banning that happens.
---
Next one is due start of October and will deal with September's action taken.
---
He didn‚Äôt, he gave BJ then blued
---
If this is legit I guess I'll have to join Amarr...
---
Are we pretending serenity was the botters vs the non bots now?
---
The association is they were both heavily botting.
---
Is the process of updating largely democratic amongst the higher echelons of the diplo corps?
---
They still die to rats just in different ways?
---
Good thing Test didn't take xxDeathxx under their wings.
---
Well, yeah. The fact that that people don't get useful feedback remains though.
---
Although, being fair, I have no idea what do people intend to do with such information and why is that so important.
---
Removing them was no different from removing the player built outposts. You could use any of them assuming you could actually conquer it. The bonuses varied but they were still a base of operations.
---
will it include which alliances they were banned from?  bonus points if it lists the corp to so the leadership that you want to help you on this gets some kind of usable data to actually help you on this!
---
This is a myth perpetrated by scumbag Amarrians.
---
The rust makes us faster.
---
The rust gives us wings.
---
In rust we trust.
---
There is zero evidence that botting stopped during Blackout though. There were still posts here pointing them out.
---
&gt; 60% frt, 30% NC/PL renters, 10%
---
0% imperium and legacy ofc
---
Thank you.
---
I had fun with it too. But a few people having fun at the expense of everyone else is still bad for the game.
---
And when undocking... unless you have an undock bookmark. But then why don't you have also a dock bookmark?
---
Blaster range and ammo consuption, entropic desintigrator fallof, artillery rate of fire, missile alpha, energy turret cap use.
---
And the speed of heavy drone.
---
According to EVEInfo, an Amarr sentry gun has 170-ish DPS, and an alpha of about 308. Still following EVEInfo‚Äôs page, the same amarr sentry gun has an optimal range of 500km, and a falloff of 50km. I don‚Äôt know about their locking speed however, but they appear to lock frigates extremely quickly on lowsec Gate fights.
---
Solo dropping my blops was some of the most fun I had.
---
O was pretty wreckless with it but got some funny kills.
---
Ya know i think I‚Äôve heard that somewhere too....
---
i kinda wish my provi was a carrier
---
I too watched an episode of CSI once.
---
+1 for fuck efficiency and have fun
---
and then there's the diamond rat Arbitrator, that hits you consistently from 10k km away
---
I had undock bookmarks but for some reason was missing an instadock. Literally before I set off I was like "hmm...I should really make an instadock in Jita....oh well"
---
Sigh
---
he landed inside the sun since cyno died ya know.
---
The ‚Äústill are botting‚Äù post was that thy moved to high sec and we‚Äôre making like 1/20th what they made in null. Dotlan was telling me that there was no botters killing rats/mining in these dead end regions that they rent.
---
Adding to Bo's comment regarding no evidence about bots stopping during the blackout, having them move out of null into highsec or whatever a few people claimed, doesn't solve the botting problem.
---
Doing a big change like this 'only' to combat botting is also bad. Turning off local doesn't require any development time. In comparison to figuring out a system that doesn't hinder players, but is a pain in the ass for botters to deal with.
---
Their super cap FC needs a good talking to.. Not nearly enough faxs for that many titans!
---
GSF entities are at a whopping 2% on that list. And yet they are able to not only compete against, but dominate, those groups with proven botting problems. This disproves your theory that the only way to keep up with botters us to bot.
---
What ? How ? You mean you stick your man with your alt in the mission pocket, and when it‚Äôs completed both get the standing boost, but not the standing hit for the main ?
---
I mean the Ochre first law is pretty serious business.
---
Just because the Vedmak you can build doesn't have launcher hardpoints, it doesn't mean that the Trig's original one doesn't either.
---

An overwhelming 40% of those permanent ban are under legacy's umbrella (incl previously DRF now XIX) but FRAT treasuray only accounts for 5% so do imperium (init. and Greater west co) Btw AOM was NOT included in the data.

Why sacrifice training on main when you can just use an alpha account to haul stuff around
---
Smartbombed in Perimeter.....
---
You don't play Eve do you?
---
No.
---
mirror mirror on the wall  
---
who's the most innocent of them all
---
Go shoot them.  Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr just let them play how they like.
---
Because it was bad change punishing players more than bots.
---
perhaps a bitterbro or newvet, depending on attitude
---
Joe would beg to differ.
---
Until a Corp or Alliance has a way of identifying a bot I dont see what the point is. How do you tell who is a bot vs who is a college kid taking a semester off poopsocking their way to a titan or something? Report those you suspect and let the professional security people figure out the rest.
---
This is why i am asking update of this data showing what happened since this graph was created.          
---
This data show all bans from the begining of eve to specific moment not long ago , and since this moment a lot happened.
---
In GSF most internal rules enforcement falls to me. Generally speaking we try to keep our rules simple to follow, designed in a way we can enforce, and leave little room for interpretation. Often this leads to refusing to create a rule for something because there's no way for us to enforce it. Or in creating rules which don't cover every possible case, but still achieve the basic goal.
---
As we're a dictatorship we have room to make judgement calls on people who are just bad for the group. We're also quite hostile to people trying to lawyer their way around rules.
---
The standing hit only comes from actually killing the NPCs.
---
What most people in FW mission running do is have a puller (or multiple) in FW pull missions, then warp around and bookmark all the sites, then give the bookmarks to the runner, and the runner goes and does all the missions.
---
Repeat.
---
This will become even easier with the bookmark changes that are coming.
---
I'm certain that last 10% is us.  We try, but we're not perfect.  And how can we be? All we can do is go off of reports, we have a lot less data than CCP does to actively track botters.  Remember, the 23/7 gila bots already get banned for having inhuman schedules.  It's the carrier or domi that rats 6-8hrs a day that otherwise looks human that's hard for us to find before CCP does.
---
What we do, is run our rental program with standards, force the interactions to be talked out in person so we can try and gauge whether or not the client intends to grow something or intends to bot, etc.  Again it's not perfect, but the initial CCP pie chart should show you the difference between actively encouraging botting (frt. treasury making 5% of the all time bans despite only being like 2 years old) and rental programs like ours that do not tolerate botting (MEMED is similar in age yet didn't make the list at all)
---
hey guess what
---
This is pretty accurate, but it looks like the chat servers are actually working properly which kinda breaks the realism.
---
yes you Can shot you a Skill in your brain :)
---
\*sad face\*
---
You must really hate typing since your post never exceed 6-7 words
---
Oh, nice then
---
Buy tempest and fit with with small guns! Tempest has nice(perfect) mid/low slots, your tank will be huge and the utilities too. Then undock to some 10frigate man gans and rape them.
---
Legitimately, I'd be really interested to know why you guys don't want to release that data.  From our perspective, it would be really helpful.  Suppose I have a rental corp that has bots banned all the time, and the corp leadership lies to me about it. how would I even know if I don't get reports from other players and find them before you do?
---
Wait, none expected spread out bombers? That's literally the most used (non-capital) structure basher setup I've used. We did it so much pre Tribute when I was in welpsquad that I thought this was the norm.
---
Wait, you can turn that off?
---
Stuka fleets aren't as used in WH space simply because usually we don't have the spare pilots to field...usually...
---
At least its undocked and not sat in a station with no subscription like all OPs ships.
---
My friend had a good run flying a double nano Nestor - basically, like a Navy Omen but driven in reverse, and with a ton of utility in the mids + defensive neuts. I can't find the lossmail, so perhaps it never actually died.
---
Because on an alpha you can't use a blockade runner
---
Just as much purpose as all the Legacy threads blaming others. Don't get me wrong, I know Cache and IronCrown, I know Fade/Deklein/Branch and GWU/RR. It is simply disgusting how Legacy uses their dreddit votebrigades to spam the board to disguise that Legacy itself is amongst the biggest beneficiaries of Botting and RMT, disguised by proxy alliances.
---
It was as they were older than the outposts.       
---
Tbh i always will regret that CCP did not make them just NPC freeports.
---
It's More than conjecture, look on reddit, there have been multiple threads and comments about it. 
---
Your justification is kinda ridiculous tbh, saying that they would have paid anybody for protection is without a doubt true but why didn't legacy erased those filthy botters from the sov Map if botting was such an untolerable practice? Let me give you a hint : cause legacy happily closed their eyes since they benefited from it. 
---
Botting is shit, no matter who gets the isk in the end, no matter how they get the isk, especially if they know how the isk was made (and let's be honest for a couple minutes, who's not aware that kwg was a botting empire? I can't believe your leadership didn't back then, neither do the rest of Eve)
---
I think they have a few Titans around the trade hub or near it. These are at a beacon you can warp to in Amarr that I think were part of the pricess guard deal a while back. They have maybe 20 capital ships all lined up in formation there. If you look at beacons in the Amarr system and warp to them you'll see them. New players should check it out not often you see capital ships in high sec.
---
Ah, a graphics setting macs can actually handle.  Nice.
---
Can we get an update on what‚Äôs planned next for chaos or is it over?
---
Summer of eve was the best it‚Äôs been in years
---
I think they're pretty cool, why not leave them?
---
Thats what proxy/rental alliances are for, but the Billions ended up in Legacy Manhattan Project
---
Please give us this data.          
---
We will burn evil alliances no matter if we have blackout or not.
---
Makes me want to quit my 5 year hiatus
---
If an entire corporation is shut down because it's just an RMT/Botting ring, then fair game.
---
However, if there are people removed from a corporation or alliance that the majority of players are genuine, law abiding citizens, then it's unfair for CCP to tarnish their reputations by association. 
---
The last thing we want is corporations or alliances being victimised because of the rule breaking behaviour of a few bad eggs.
---
Bot hunting is about cleaning up EVE and sending the message that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated in our game, it's not about starting witch hunts.
---
Why is deadspace green?
---
KWG is on that list, XIX as well, keep negating what can't be nagated.
---
He isn‚Äôt in wingspan. He just has the flair.
---
Why such a cheap fit?
---
These are not decision that I make and i'm not involved in the discussion relating to them.
---
You'll have to wait to see what's announced next - no time frame for that at present.
---
I wish my big losses were as cheap as that, its all relative of course
---
This is for the CSM where you quit after you were banned, right?  Because it's easier to take credit for stuff on r/eve than do the real work?  Kinda like your whole eve career, amirite?
---
This is why eve is dying btw.
---
I know but we have often cases when botters move from one alliance to another with obvious and constant PVE loses.         
---
On top of that letting players know what alliances have the most botters will allow players decide to not join some alliance due to this.       
---
Something that is not possible today.
---
This is why i asked for data since this data was presented?         
---
Instead of player speculating why not see actual numbers for last few months from CCP.
---
The graphics were different. The services available were different.
---
The capability to use them for basic staging and a home was the same as outposts. So "removal of NPC stations" should really read "removal of conquerable stations". Which I personally agree with. Part of the reason for reduced mobility is that previously you were able to conquer an outpost and have basic facilities ready "for free". When you lost an outpost you didn't (mostly) lose a big investment in creating it. Now if you move it is potentially really expensive.
---
I'm pretty sure he's also referring to things like the vr project
---
Training things in real time is a right of passage
---
dattebayo
---
Because certain things are broken within the game and skill injectors take the game from "this thing is broken but there's a little bit of time to fix it before it becomes a major problem" to "everyone is abusing the mechanic within an hour of release"
---
I mean it's an AT ship, screeching is warranted.
---
To be fair, if you and your three accounts have been signed since 07/09 then your probably in a category of people deemed unlikely to unsub. Not a lot they can do to cause you to sub more accounts or anything.

---
You mean that unhealthy looking cokehead that could be my son agewise?
---
xd we did it reddit
---
Yes, it's one of the first things I do when making a new alt
---
CCP doesn‚Äôt seem to want to feed propaganda engines with damaging stuff for the meta.
---
How is a 95% decrease in bot effectiveness a bad thing though?
---
But if the premise is that the Alliances have absolutely no possible way to tell who is a bot how are they at fault? There are a ton of Eve players who somehow(I dont understand it) actually like to PVE big time and grind out sites all day long. Reporting is the only recourse possible and you see here all the time people have reported "obvious" bots a dozen times only to continue to see those pilots in space for months on end. What culpability does the Alliance have in that case? They are not a cyber detective, they have no mandate, and they have zero tools.
---
Fucking excellent, but you have a legitimate copy of office without the red bar saying you need to activate, so it breaks the realism of real life. Now we need a IBM unix command line version. In green. Please.
---
lets not forget choosing to favor xix, the decade(?) spanning turbobotting drone rmt lords, over their coalition mate, and then being the one reason that cancer didn't die after being assblasted by skillu(and providing them with more botting space, hello pizza maker!)
---
On the flipside of that, (running a megacorp also) I wouldn't mind if dreddit got called out for a bot every now and again if it came with a name too so that I could go through our auth system, and make sure they don't have any other characters in TEST.  But I appreciate the answer, I hadn't thought of it from the legit corp perspective.  Would your guys maybe be willing to send that data to corp CEOs?  or alliance execs?  Add to the workflow ban --&gt; ceo ingame mail or something?
---
Good one
---
Too many to sort through ;)
---
I don't know if it's "cheating" but there are lots of NPCs that do. For example a Guristas Forsaken Hub has a rat shooting inferno missiles heavily tilting the dps to thermal.
---
This is fair.
---
Rocket bombers was how I started camping explorers, was extremely fun
---
Until recently Pandemic Horde kept highsec plex market under its control and removed anyone trying to get a share of the market. Then TEST moved in dropped a Keepstar (biggest citadel  in game that is nearly impossible to kill because capital ships aren't allowed in highsec). It all devolved in to nullsec entities deploying to highsec and as a result turned plex market in to a shitshow and nearly killed one particular highsec pirate alliance that got caught in crossfire. Now PH, TEST and goons formed a syndicate to control highsec plex market. What makes this story weird is that TEST and goons are actively fighting PH in nullsec.
---
because you are colorblind
---
injectors literally killed Eve.
---
more people die with cancer than from cancer.
---
injectors obviously worse.

Don't underestimate the democratic nature of voting with one's feet.  Day to day decisions are of course made unilaterally by directors, but a corp/alliance/coalition that's not fun and worthwhile to be in will quickly find itself bereft of members, especially the FCs and other useful people that make things happen for them.
---
Best representation of EVE... for ages, up-voted

I am pretty sure you could take a look at corp taxes and go from there.
---
That's shitty :/
---
It's actually not that bad m8.
---
I don‚Äôt really get invested in killmarks or dying, but I brawl in frigates, destroyers, and cruisers as a general playstyle. Encouraging players to think outside the box is a good thing, keep it up!
---
I personally feel that plexing is more a pvp focused activity (or, facilitator) that can have a major impact whereas all the examples you listed are PVE. You should be able to stop pilots from plexing that will inevitably lead them to flip your system beyond swatting them away like flies only to see them return a few minutes later.
---
you see, normally when you lack info about something you make it clear-or at least mention it - and don't post as "hard evidence" without proper context, but who am I kidding, ncpl is gonna be dead and buried and they'll still be in your mind.

How does it feel to have a bunch of has been turboboomers eternally burned into your psyche?

Agreements like these come from the highest echelons of power.

---
someone should try to bump them or gank them :)
---
I mean, you could in theory, *talk* to them.
---
~cHaOS~
---
I have actually, it's a mostly wasted effort. Most people just farm the novice and small plexes.
---
Lmao what the fuck happened to you mate. Used to be a solid dude, now are randomly withholding information on reddit about botting like the rest of these nullsec idiots. Morons that are going around typing with heads up arses that conveniently double as an echo chambers. Replacing facts and logic with straight up drivel inducing accusations they find up there.
---
&gt; but Sony insisted it be PS3 exclusive
---
Sony did give them a bunch of money for exclusivity and development though, it's a pretty normal practice. Doesn't make it any less shitty for the consumer though.
---
I thought the ship doesn't make a good pilot? All I see are bigger and better KMs from people that don't know what they're doing. As if that was ever a bad this..
---
Why would a meth dealer care about it's users or the community
---
I wasn't even thinking stuka. Just plain torp bombers. As soon as you get targeted you warp away and then back again. Never used it against a keepstar but it was very effective against all other structures.
---
Eve gameplay should be colder and darker than it is... not the servers haha
---
Thanks for the response. You are the man
---
unironically I like that one mechanically; hate to think what kind of calculation load that would take serverside though.
---
louder for those in the back 'ON ITS OWN, YOU DIE'
---
Repeat business?
---
people would just have notepads of who to lock when landing on a grid.
---
Yeah i came here to post this.
---
Truthfully, nobody closed their eyes. Most pilots in Legacy just don't give a shit about groups like KWG, or even  IGC/BSIT that moved in to replace them.
---
It'd be the same if you ask any NC. pilot if they care about what's going on with the activity in BOT space, or SkillU (rip) about their HRE renters. Or even WinterCo renters who you barely see on fleets. You'll most likely get the same answer every time: **we don't give two shits about renters.**
---
Most pilots of these organizations don't want to be associated with their renter organization. **One**, they don't participate in coalition fleets. **Two**, why remove them when they're not a threat, only to allow another neutral/even enemy group to claim said space. **Three**, the minute they fuck up, they're gone (just ask KWG how that went, wait they're dead now).
---
***Tldr***: don't associate scrub level organizations that pay rent/blue status to the main local powerbloc as being ***one and the same***. Got a problem with said rental organization? Go farm them to the point where their botting activity can't keep up with the losses and they leave the game. I'm fairly certain your average Legacy line member wouldn't even bat an eye.
---
&gt;if for instance skill injectors were limited in use by the amount of time a character has existed?
---
So you mean skill injectors are restricted to only being used by characters above a certain age?
---
Well, skill injectors are designed to give new players a way to rush ahead in training and become competitive sooner, so this would pretty much destroy that possibility. And botters/RMTers could just make a dozen alpha accounts and sit on them, switching accounts when their mains get banned to get around this limit.
---
Lol:)
---
Hes gotta be the saltiest bittervet Ive ever seen on this sub. But he grows on you. Like a rash:)
---
Shouldn't Deadspace be blue?
---
More fleets more indivual people busy doing these things.
---
look at this guy, min/maxing fun
---
To be fair, his flair says "wormholer" and the "never talk in local" has probably been bleeding over into social media. :D
---
It's like that anyway dude, it's like any game a level of commitment to the task.
---
As a self appointed defender of the EULA? I dont condone botting they are absolute dogshit and a blight on the game but whats the difference between a completely AFK myrm and a botting myrm when I try to open a convo? Im not so sure I want my time in Eve to be chasing around perspective bots instead, I could in theory, play the game itself on my terms like everyone else?
---
Well thats the "joke"...
---
Like classic eve? Bring a shield sniper bc. Form up on me.
---
Sadly I guess that train is gone, CCP missed to get on board.
---
Also I am a guy that can give credit to Imperium Lead for what infrastructure they have built with the means CCP gave them, just as I can give credit to PL old guard for using the meta at that time to get ahead (Goons already had several times more members but still failed to keep up, although they could had they made the same decisions as PL at that time like personal moons to fund Titans)
---
No. It was a stupid idea to ever present it. Instead of showing worthless pie charts they should do some data mining to get more bots banned.
---
Actually kinda okay with this. You assign your top tier FC's to tie up hostile top tier fc's and let skimish commanders and other dudes get the experiance of fighting on a major grid. The added tactics and such would be refreshing at first, until we find a way to min max it of course
---
Outlaw cynos in low sec!
---
Maybe he isn't a dirty goonfucker.
---
It's easy to take credit for the things I actually did, yes. As opposed to folks who will never actually do anything, like you.
---
Delete skill injectors
---
Love grath. His unique view on this game and how he stands up to some of the egos on this sub/game is epic.
---
No, I live there, and with some 650 Mio SP over 3 accounts I do not only fly Frigs ...
---
?
---
The Imperium has a whole subforum for rules and policies.
---
Injector cooldown would be curious to balance it out.
---
Yeah it worked effectively against the Keep. If we had been able to get our people in, we had roughly 50 Longbows to hand out which would have made short work of them...
---
But again, even with normal torp bombers, its usually a case of not having the numbers. Wormholers aren't a particularly big bunch...
---
Aim to mine for just 60 minutes and try to optimize it until you squeeze close to nominal value out of it. Interrupt cycles, scan and pre-mark asteroids, try to get only the best types of ore etc.   
---
Shipping a DST with \~1b of the shiniest, most perfectly stacked bricks of compressed dense veldspar to a customer's drop-off location gave me shameless good feels :)
---
It shows that having 20 rorqual alts sitting in belts pretty much afk is as effective as botting, and just as bad.
---
Let the downvotes come! LOL
---
Create chars each day , use them few months later when old ones are banned?
---
Yea it‚Äôs actually showing where he is and not where he was 30 minutes ago. 0/10 realism

Where's the FUCKING DSCAN.

All default settings, camera shake, sounds etc. Is this on sisi?

Shut up valk
---
look guys goons killed an idiot boson ratter!!! they're really our enemies and dont actively form up for our timers on our side and never shoot us when shit actually matters but nevermind that!
---
Can you send me your overview setup please?
---
If you got out before citadels as well then you really had some good timing.
---
I don't get it... you just posted a screenshot of eve online. 
---
OHHHHH i see it now... hahaha you don't have netflix playing on your 2nd monitor... hahahah
---
So asking someone which cutting teeth of the chainsaw hurt him seems like a reasonable defense to you? So basically asking people to be more specific until they run out of time. Time honored stone walling strategy of the guilty  conscience.
---
I've been playing for just over 3 months. All the bittervet complaining about people injecting rorq alts or titans have a point. At the same time, waiting 2 months (literally over half the time I've been playing) so I can fly logi in small gang pvp or incursions isn't fun when there are limited things you can do.
---
Its the main reason I run incursions now, to inject skills. It's a way to progress without waiting literally months to try something new.
---
What people forget is that waiting is a lot different when you're greatly limited in what you can do already.
---
Most def. Which is the only reason I actually read his stuff. He isnt ignorant like most shittalkers on this sub.
---
Quite the leap there, from my understanding I was told the smaller guys don't need local? Not sure if you're one of the people but this sub changes opinion quick. 
---
I have talked to new players, and people that have never played the game. Tell them they need to escort their freighter in eve 2019 only to get titan dropped in low-sec. No.
---
I saw on a youtube vid the other day the ability to number targets, been trying to fun how to do this in game but can't seem to find it. Even Google failed me :(
---
Can anyone steer me in the right direction?
---
Min/maxing IS fun.
---
No drones tab? Or is the screen too small for that?
---
bruh
---
they are new players, they dont own a freighter, nor do they get put in charge of logistics.
---
tell a new player, hey come follow our cargo, we almost DEFINATLE will get dropped on and theyll be some huge great fun fight, oh and youll only loose your ship worst case. - different story.
---
and where did i say smaller groups DO need local? i literally am saying the lack of local isnt as bad for smaller guys than the larger groups.
---
Doesn't change the fact that this sweet botting money benefitted legacy despite knowing how it was generated by kwg. I didn't Say legacy was actively botting, i'm saying that they didn't gave a fuck that kwg was botting and accepted the money, which is pretty much the same. Money laundering is the same shit as botting, it isn't morally acceptable. 
---
Yet, botting and how those filthy chinese dudes "botted their way into titans" was all over the place when the war was Raging. Don't you see how ridiculous it sounded for everyone not drinking legacy's koolaid?
---
Cool, new flavor of the month. Who's next, Panfam? Shall we go back to shitting on people like Ranger Reg or BOT for the same stuff?
---
Show me on the super where TEST touched you.
---
So, how do you fight the blob? Other than resource scarcity, which would do a great job to be an incentive for people to spread out, which would thin defensive shields somewhat.
---
***CHAOS ERA!***
---
Or just massively reduce the amount injected for capitals so that people can't inject into carriers or rorquals.
---
Well, op is obviously a null sec krab, he only rely on local
---
I'd love to see faction navy rats fighting the triglavians when they show up in newbie systems. Give the noobs something pretty to look at.
---
Well said. "Age of Chaos" is nothing more than frantic twisting of the dials in the hope of somehow boosting numbers to qualify for the contingent cash portion of the PA buyout.
---
I can honestly say that in my two months i have not run out of things to do. But i do like mining...so i may be one of those weird people üòÇ
---
You know what's disgusting? Being outraged at someone else for doing something they like, that has no impact on you. That's the worst kind of person.
---
Sorry, wanted to link it but I didn‚Äôt knew if Reddit authorized comments with links in them, or if they were forbidden like in 9GAG &gt;.&lt;
---
But yeah, that‚Äôs the one I was talking about.
---
Crap p2w game.
---
The sub FC's exist in each 50 man fleet and they keep track of the main FC.
---
What scares you more:
---
&gt; A bunch of goons that afked their way to their supercapital army but didn't bot.
---
&gt; If AFK rorqing wasn't a thing, then the botter groups having the overwhelming advantage in the game.
---
except horde ;)
---
Nobody but the goon recruiter is saying that.
---
Or I purposely place a ship in front of you/your exit warp path and cause you to bump into me. You get penalized. WEEEE
---
Man that‚Äôs lame
---
what if we don't understand old languages and glyphs because they're old memes. we just need a format scheme and bam we know all the shit. think about it. in this one, we wear masks to fight snakes, we have shitty beards under our power armour and we eat through the back of our heads.
---
None of the big alliances/coalitions actually cares about botters as long as they can profit from them and not be held accountable.
---
They have no problems with accepting thieves/scammers, if they profit from them, so why would they care about botters? 
---
"Our renters were botting?" "Oh sorry CCP, how could we know?!!?" 
---
Big alliances/coalitions wouldn¬¥t be as big if they cared about morality.
---
I don't even know why i am replying but here we go, wew lad.  
---
First of all you seem to have missed that i am making a joke. The joke was targeted at you, a leading member of goons, calling someone out for having fun at the expense of the gameplay experience of other players. This is what goons and all major null entitities have been doing ever since the MER metas inception.  
---
You are just intentionally ignoring it because it furthers your own goals.
---
While Grath might not be a very comfortable person to argue with, he is the sort of player that we need more of in the game. His abrasivness is refreshing, if more people were as strong headed as him we'd have more ship explosions.  
---
Yes, the blackout hurt ccps bottomline. Yes it probably wasn't sustainable.  
---
But let's ask the more important question. Why did blackout "fail"? In my eyes because the sov-null population has become too pampered and whiny to deal with the tiniest changes. We have moved on to a game state where having a super or titan is viewed as a right, and not a privilege. That is pretty fucked.  
---
And you, once again, as a goon member, have had a major part in pushing the game in this direction, which is why i was making a joke about that. Sorry that you are offended by me stereotyping you because you are a GSM :)
---
With that out of the way, i do agree with you fundamentally speaking. Change is good, blackout was too drastic (but nevertheless we had to test it to figure that out, so shittalking ccp for the change and then reverting it is boneheaded) and there are a million ways you can attack issues that the game is having that don't involve local chat.   
---
But for the love of god, can we as a subreddit collectively just learn our lessons from blackout and move on? Constantly berating ccp because of it won't exactly help either.
---
I don‚Äôt Black Fraternity Legion likes you very much.
---
Actually, the faction police (which respond to low security status) are pretty OP as well. They tackle, web, and rapidly kill even the thickest tank. The faction navy (which respond to low standings with an empire faction) are the ones that merely web and tickle.
---
This is what I've been hearing for months as well. The thing is that it isn't only the invasion spawns but the random Raznaborg ones killing them in belts in a 1.0 system as well. These people will not be coming back.
---
You mean ‚Äúthe sneer on their faces as they kill your oddly fitted ship‚Äù  don‚Äôt you?
---
Soo ur saying that more players is a bad thing because ccp makes revenue from players resubbing?
---
Hmmmmm.... PanFam quality players.

I call fake, or at least out of date....

Give it a month or so and PanFam or Goons will do something and the neckbeard bastion that is /r/Eve will once again be overwhelmed by people who quit playing years ago telling us all about **nullbloc group X** is killing the game and how they could fix it because they took a Python class on Codecademy but CCP never listens to them and Eve is dying and we should all invest our RMT money into Star Citizen and Avon.
---
It isn't called the spreadsheet simulator for nothing
---
Does every faction have something like this or just Amarr?
---
It helps them know not to just trust people because they say they're trustworthy. Kind of like "Hey I'm actually helping you here, but if I were trying to take advantage of you, there's nothing that would have stopped me. Be aware that some people will take advantage of your trust."
---
He said the i-word! Get the pitchforks and shout "got gud" at him!
---
"dick head"
---
Could sending this info to Corp/Alliance executors balance this issue?
---
For instance, TEST wouldn't intentionally cause a witchhunt against itself (Okay, maybe test would, but a competent alliance wouldn't), but TEST knowing of botting habits in its own alliance can help put internal pressure against those entities to self-police.
---
Is there a Solid Cruiser/ BattleCrusier fit for clearing out the Emerging Conduits that are spawning in highsec?   I tried Shield tanking a Myrmidon with as much Omni tank I can muster but they seem to just melt through it in one wave.  Is it a case of the ship just being too slow?
---
Look at your blues list instead.
---
i don't wanna coin it the skillu approach because it still hurts too much that we lost you guys from the game. but i guess as a truly elite alliance you really knew how to win eve all along.
---
Pitchforks are only 20 isk in Jita right now..
---
You could, but since the majority of ratting was done almost entirely AFK pre-VNI nerf, how would that actually work out?
---
You have a good chance of the AFK myrm responding to your convo when you do it at a time that needs player interaction (warping to new site and drop drones). 
---
The only real counter to botting is making tasks hard for bots (I don't think there is many Abyssal bots around for example). This also means you get angry multi-boxers though.
---
I know it won't happen, but rerolling Lifeblood would do a lot. Groups like us would unmerge again into the small PvP-Entities they were before with about 200-400 members. Even the 1300 player group i am in now feels to big for us.
---
Well, that would be one way to reduce f1 monkey blobs.
---
U must not get out much lol
---
Keep drinking koolaid, or whatever drug vily shares with you ...
---
And they do it all for what? Being gentrified pets of goons.
---
Well AFAIK neut resist did in fact work for me in blood raider 10-10s about a year ago. The only rats I know that can actually hit things at infinite range are some bugged diamond rats. However, rats yellow boxing from anywhere on grid is a thing near gates or stations, probably a relic from the old times when grids were a couple hundred km in radius.
---
I like supers being rare because it‚Äôs more satisfying to kill them. It takes a lot of effort sometimes going and tackling one and then getting the fleet there and all the organization to kill it. Think scanning WH chains, moving cynos, moving bridges, getting nerds in ships, using spies to watch intel to make sure we aren‚Äôt scouted/watch for fleet pings. With everything that goes into hunting these and potentially going for a tackle... even being ready for the escalation... I don‚Äôt want these ships to be worth less. It will take away from the satisfaction of the kill. Then you‚Äôll see some of these groups just say screw it I don‚Äôt want to work so hard to MAYBE get one nyx kill. And of course people will say ‚Äúoh well go ahead and be lazy and quit‚Äù but that‚Äôs taking away from potential content for you. 
---
I don‚Äôt think reducing the value of these ships is the way forward. I think it‚Äôs more on FCs to just use the ships more frequently and encourage ppl to get them replaced.
---
&gt; As for who bumps whom, the server is already doing those calculations to determine what direction and how far ships move from collisions.
---
Except what it currently does can't meaningfully determine who is a the bumper and who is the bumped.
---
4 months of more data won't show much besides adding aom to the legacy tally
---
Bro that is so boring lmao
---
Look, much like CCP and game changes, I find adding the circumflex too much Effort‚Ñ¢ given my American keyboard.
---
Only touching Vily gets is from Mittens. :P
---
Can you even read? Also it is usually me who touches TEST Supers, last time it was 10 at once
---
No idea, justs know this one is in Amarr system.
---
I would legit play this version.
---
You see, what you've just done is identified the one flaw in the only way the common EVE player can "identify" a bot. 
---
In reality, there is no difference between a bot running 10 accounts each spinning a site than a single player with 10 accounts each spinning a site.
---
It's an unpopular opinion, but it's the truth. "Oh did that guy run away when I jumped into system? Bot. Oh, did that guy not run away when I jumped into system? Broken bot."
---
And that right there is the reason CCP has such a hard time identifying and banning bots. Because the gameplay systems are so simple (click here, click that, come back in 10 minutes) it's incredibly difficult to identify who is and isn't a bot. I've said it before, but there is no way for CCP to hurt botting without also hurting a whole lot of real players.
---
You can make a t3 product en masse and make a good amount of money.   I do find that shipping can always be an issue at some point. 
---
I have had good luck with Nanite paste. If you know you're going to dig into an area set up nanite past is hard but in the end its super-profitable, easy to ship, and great cash.   I make approximately 500m per week making nanite with my  30 Planets.  CCU V is not required but since you already have it that will help a lot with creating more extractor heads.  Once you get a fair amount of ingredients in your station then you just start throwing materials in with blueprints for nanite paste, i think the bpo is like 50m?   If I really optimize and set things up super well I can pull probably close to 700m per week. doing only Nanite.
---
I used to do this as well, only with a mobile tractor unit as "goal" (If you get the "ball" close enough to the tractor unit, it gets sucked in, thus counting as a point for you team).
---
If Alliances knew who got banned for botting they could get rid of the offending players since most established groups use some form of tracking of characters belong to the same player. This way you'd force bots apply from scratch or use less lucrative space.
---
Very true, and I drafted (but deleted) a similar comment touching on how smaller groups like corps and SIGs do have a measure of democracy, but since he's looking more for formal psuedo-legal systems I left it alone. But it would be worth a thread to explore varying levels of democracy vs autocracy in Eve organizations.
---
\&gt;the most expensive faction battleship  
---
\&gt;super cheap
---
lol nice job on that pretty sov you have up there. Glad to see it's working out.
---
Because seeing a pie chart means that CCP is not also data mining to get more bots banned. Nope. Only one or the other, can't be both.
---
Same with players. Either you're a filthy krab, or you're a pvper. Not both.
---
What, where, when, who?
---
Should probably focus on finishing that current war before going to war with Mangos.
---
I always wonder .. why.
---
It's not possible to make changes that don't punish both.
---
On the plus side if you played for 11 years you've probably got some characters knocking around with large amounts of SP.  You can extract that and become an instant trillionaire (well, instant Titan owner for sure).
---
But I like minmaxing. That's half my fun.
---
Also, Check out John Drees Art of Poor series on youtube. It's not as crazy as you suggest but it's very interesting and in the same vein.

Netherstar
---
Both scares me the same.
---
If afk rorquing is a counterweight to botting, doesn¬¥t it mean botters act as a counterweight for afk rorquing too?
---
Both should stop immediately imho. It is just wishfull thinking, though, since the loss of all the subscription money  would hurt CCP, which means they have no intention to "fix" that.
---
Nah m8 this is r/Eve, where no one reeds and downvotes because they didn't like something, not because it didn't contribute.
---
I killed a daredevil with a brawling condor.
---
Okay, 2 brawling condors, but still.
---
Uh.. gottem?
---
It's not just a right of passage, it's devalued veteran status.  Being a veteran is no longer of any real value in the game.  The prestige it used to have has gone too.
---
Doesn't exist
---
Yeah I'm aware of this, but obviously this effect would take much larger distances than are in Eve to have any significance. I was just curious. Thanks anyway :)
---
Gotta have somewhere to put all of the slaves
---
You can also try to join Red VS Blue, great for learning tactics with solo and fleet. I also believe it's frig/cruiser size only... I could be wrong with that though.
---
lol thanks
---
In a WH, P0-P2 works just fine at IV IV. Can't say for anywhere else. I have one planet that's a bit slow, the rest are on par for 18k/hr or just a tiny bit under if I don't move things around enough.
---
Lol fair enough. From the vocabulary they use I assume warp travel uses something like the Alcubierre drive. As for relocating your conscious, idek what you're talking about, I'm very new to the game, sorry lol. With the third thing, again, I assume it's just turning off the Alcubierre drive. Max speed on ships is in a lot of space games, and, although it doesn't make any sense, I've just learnt to accept it.
---
wo worries x) Thanks again! yeah I figured it wasn't worth from what I gathered when I originally tried to find out.
---
Imagine pretending this hard you‚Äôre relevant
---
Haha yeah because the world is gonna run out of junkies
---
Don't forget to go potato mode.
---
Hmm, the one word I understood from that is 'basically'.
---
One thing I like is how compatible is in-game data with excel, you can basically copy-paste anything from in-game tables and it would appear properly formatted in excel.
---
Well, watch the video!!!
---
It's not just mechanics explanation, its a thrilling narrative.
---
Small groups move from a big group to another big group every now and then, often because of the rules.
---
I do this kind of thing often. It's fun when you confuse the hell out of someone. "Why is this porp burning at me???"
---
I think Hilmtard is hoping that if numbers drop hard enough, Papa Pearl Abyss will let him leave early.
---
CCP just trying to kill playerbase. They destroyed null, abandoned low and now actively killing high. Whs are next.
---
Some people have been playing the game for more than a decade. Now in the same coalition, later against eachother. Friendship, trust and hate are very common feelings among the community, including alliances leaders.
---
I've seen that. It's a nice handy insta-mobile depot for my ships.
---
Your a scummy little person, corp thefts are one thing, but you just stole off line members. Corp should pay back the line members for the dumb mail / instructions.
---
I thought about that but man.. I‚Äôm emotionally attached to my toon. I‚Äôve got so much stuff &amp; isk bc of an alliance I ran in sov imploded after the N3/CFC war of B-R. I let my market toon freight stuff around for almost a month before I got tired lol.
---
Bots worked just fine before injectors so any change there won't affect them much. It's not like skilling up basic myrm pilots takes very long.
---
This would also make them useless for new players looking to catch up, which is the only positive thing about them to begin with.
---
If they're gonna change injectors i woudl rather see this; Give injected SP a separate pool, always have injectors inject the full SP amount and then penalize when the SP is applied based on skill rank, so rank 1 skills are injected at 1 to 1 ratio, stuff like caps at rank 12 or whatever are injected at 12 SP from pool for 1 SP in skill. Tweak numbers to suit whatever. Event SP from the event pool is always 1 to 1.
---
Everyone can inject low level skills easily, injecting caps and shit becomes stupidly expensive.
---
Because, as we all know, our "accomplishments" in a video game are truly what define us as people.  I am starting to understand why you harp on your in-game accomplishments so much... You must be a terribly shallow person IRL.
---
Not even coming soon?                
---
                
---
Meme's aside normal local is too strong and blackout was too strong perhaps some mid ground is needed.
---
Why do you think he's in a pod?
---
Just go to the sun and wait.
---
Awesome!
---
&gt;Edit: got gate camped. Does test watch all the entry points into its system?
---
Find a route through Provi/Jamunda or use a Wormhole.
---
You def need to learn how to fit your haulers.
---
where is AOM who buying 2000 bils?
---
I'm sorry your parents are disappointed in you, dude. If following me around like a puppy and disparaging things I've done makes you feel better, please feel free to keep doing it.  There are too few things in life that give people joy, and I would hate to deprive you of yours, even if it's at my expense.
---
Vily doesn't do the touching. It's when others get close to touching him that they suddenly turn blue
---
I'm surprised he didn't DDoS coms.
---
Yep. I understand.  Don't do it for that reason.  It gives a totally empty feeling.   Do do it if you don't like you characters though (simple things like not liking the names you have them when you were a kid back in 2003, etc.).
---
Here are some known uses.
---
* C4+ PvE
---
* fleet logi (healers) in some armor doctrines.
---
* "Shit has gone sideways" mobile depot for capitals
---
* Disgustingly good shield nano solo pvp
---
Here is what is can't really do and you should just forget:
---
* Exploration
---
Seriously just forget the hacking and scanning bonuses exist.
---
No, for that you have to shout enhance at the same time.
---
&gt; I didn't Say legacy was actively botting, i'm saying that they didn't gave a fuck that kwg was botting and accepted the money 
---
In that case, you picked the wrong thread to comment on my dude, see below.
---
&gt;  Legacy has been constantly pointing the finger at WC, but really should take a look at themselves. 
---
&gt;Since you know so much about Legacy, how about you provide proof of rmt'ing and botting within Legacy members? Otherwise, you're just another internet troll.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We'll wait.
---
My post was a rebuttal to the claim Legacy should look within themselves. KWG isn't Legacy and has never been officially. Again, that's like saying BOT is NC. or HRE is Skillu... which is just silly and rude.
---
&gt;Yet, botting and how those filthy chinese dudes "botted their way into titans" was all over the place when the war was Raging. 
---
We roamed FRT space when they lived in Curse, circa mid-to-late 2016. They had less than a dozen titans then. Mind you this is an alliance that's been around since 2013. Fast forward to 2019, they're fielding **200**\+ titans. Even groups that's been playing longer than Frat can't match those numbers, alone on grid by themself without a batphone, based on BRs where titans have been fielded (Snuff/Init/Tri/DeadCo etc).
---
Impressive WinterCo titan numbers, indeed. I don't know how many of those numbers were achieved through legitimate means, but it doesn't matter. We'll still fight it regardless, should WinterCo ever decide to throw down and not hide behind the cyno-jammer cancer. Funny that CCP wants more titans to die and yet introduced gameplay of not only one cyno jammer, but three in a system. So much for flashform cap brawls in 2019....
---
What about starting with those who have 36 ticks in a row with no real drop between them to indicate food or toilet breaks in those 12 hours?
---
&gt; Now we need a IBM unix command line version. In green. Please.
---
And done in Minecraft with a complicated array of wool and pistons to get a refresh rate of 1 frame per 5 seconds.
---
Just the map change alone would bring so much life into the game, I honestly feel like.
---
It would be logistically hard to implement, sure, but with null in the middle there‚Äôd be no cut-off corners these huge alliances can hole up in.
---
You need to fix your overview my guy, not even a logout button smh
---
Just use a praxis.
---
Fairly accurate
---
eve ironman btw
---
Hate to come across as ignorant, but who are AOM?
---
well for what its worth i tried to get what a spy that was previously in brave they flat out rejected me, imperium on the other hand received me with their arms open :)
---
Legit players left in droves, but you want to say that was just botters, when there is zero evidence to support that. But sure, keep you head in the sand.
---
I don't know if it would count as laws, but pretty much every nullsec group has internal rules for their players that govern in game aggression.
---
ratting ticks come in chunks every 20 minutes.  It'd be pretty hard to tell the difference between a bathroom break and a poor tick due to a bad spawn, or downgrading to a smaller site based on system availability, or docking up for 5 minutes due to a neutral entering system.
---
They were super cheap, then blackout happened and prices got rekt. Neat ship though, only logi battleship in the game.
---
Ahh i see, I played dust, never got to mess with Valkyrie
---
I'm not sure what any of that has to do with this thread, but I'm always down for someone dunking on StainGuy's NCPL complex
---
Go to test server and there‚Äôs a system dedicated to it
---
Given your repeated trips to the mom/parent joke well, I expect you'll be back in a month or two to tell r/eve how you invented the mom joke.  It was all part of your plan, right up until CCP thwarted you from actually accomplishing anything.
---
I highly doubt Hilmtard even knows Faction Warfare exists.
---
You look like a bug there :P
---
Leshak.
---
rude?
---
yes, asset safetied into the legacy structures in 03- that takes 5 days instead of all the way to lowsec in three weeks.
---
Make coalitions illegal
---
No drones in a pod
---
Hey, I go with what works.  Which means, obviously, that I wouldn't be going with you. 
---
See what I did there? I can keep this up all day, spanky.
---
Most landlords have the courtesy not to get on a narrative soapbox about "the eeeeeevil botters", though.
---
But my background as a nerd has left me unprepared for the unbearable shame of loss!
---
Its great fun  when you do a24hr hole lockdown durin anchoring or unachoring of structures i secretly had a faction ecm fitted :D
---
I get what you're saying, but I don't think it's quite that simple, or practical.
---
Accurate file name.  Also lol
---
Right so all I have to-do then is to create a sitting toon for multiple supers to sit tethered outside and logged off? Fair enough!
---
Army of Mangos, the new Chinese alliance that migrated over from the Chinese server.
---
Nah, it's wherever people go after being afflicted with the Fountain curse.
---
So you want Frigates banned from FW now?
---
Thank you, that is actually reassuring. 
---
My nightmare is that CCP are not willing to invest to make Eve a better, and more, say, up to date game. (What is better? I know there are a lot of opinions...)
---
I do hope that they are doing just that, ie making Eve great again!
---
IMO, Eve is one of the best games ever. CCP have gold, they just need to make it shine. How? r/eve has a lot of suggestions...
---
And people are blaming Rorquals...
---
I can't speak to how null was back then. I stupidly stayed in high sec till 2016, "because it was safe". I was an idiot
---
You mean the keepstar you anchored specifically to provide you with a safe evac route to cache right?
---
or in this case a minuscule fee with a much shorter wait to redeem them in the legacy structures in O3-4.  No lowsec needed.
---
That doesn't even make sense.  But that's cool, keep telling yourself you're superior.  I'm not the one who got banned, then quit in a huff.  Then continued to tell everyone how great I am.  Shouldn't you be booking a room in Trump Tower for some Saudi oil baron or something? Or greasing some shady GOP shitbird to pass a bill to make sure oil companies can frack in Yellowstone?
---
Advice and warnings are pieces of information that the recipient can act on and use to influence their decisions. If you told them, 'this specific person is untrustworthy, don't work with them', then they would know to avoid that specific person. But you're warning them about *all* 0-collateral contracts. You're warning them against people like *yourself*. If they have no other way to transport their stuff, then they're just screwed. In other words, there is no way for them to use this advice you are giving them - it doesn't meaningfully impact their decision making. 
---
So what you're really telling them is, 'it sucks to be you'.
---
That's a ludicrous stretch.
---
all I've got that Little Focker is a Littler Socker
---
Even if the world won't, eve might - looking at the pcu.
---
all I've got that Little Focker is a Little Socker
---
They NC "undocked".
---
Got the fleet on comms, had them hold off logging in (Dont want to have to Omega that char if it isnt gonna undock.) waited until they had a good excuse not to do anything then called it off.
---
This is courtesy of the little astra that could crew.  
---
Its on the alliance for issuing such dumb instructions.
---
Every single variable in a combat situation means you need to write a code response to it. Individually, these variables are not usually complicated, but they stack together and can massively change expected behaviour even if the effect sizes are small. Attempting to write an AI that can process this into a pattern of behaviour would be a logical nightmare that would require hundreds or thousands of manhours of tuning just to even begin to resemble a basic understanding of gameplay. The experienced and highly analytical playerbase of EVE will figure out and exploit these decision making patterns in a fraction of that time.
---
You're asking CCP to spend a massive amount of money and effort doing something that we will ruin for ourselves within a month. Why should they bother? I'm not asking this because I'm some sort of retarded CCP fanboy, I'm coming from the position of a developer who has had to walk away from a project because it ended up being useless. What's the point of developing something that doesn't actually change the experience in a meaningful way? Example: walking in stations
---
So you are going to have a bunch of logs suddenly showing you selling ships that you have no record of purchasing? What is your story for how you acquired them?
---
Just transfer plex. Its easier and safer if you do it in a random system with nobody in it and in a safe. Get close to each other, eject plex, pick it up, dock, put it in your plex vault, move to TTT, and sell it.
---
Exooki just updated us.  CCP has came up with a fix.  They have a few adjustments to make before it's deployed.  No ETA but assuming soonish.
---
^This, moving stuff for long time friends in game is based off the trust established. moving stuff for newbies who are in a pinch and either don‚Äôt have the skills or ability to move things themselves, comes with the warning that it‚Äôs not a good habit.
---
Yet it would give you an idea of who to take a closer look at when they are doing none stop ratting for over 12 hours a day, everyday.
---
Your editing delivers every time
---
But CCP rewrote the old chat system. Granted, it took them more than a year to finish, but they delivered. And it's now 100% more efficient and up-to-industry-standard.  \*badum tsss\*
---
shhh shhh shhh we root for the little ~~bot~~ guy here.
---
It's okay. you may be autists, but you're OUR autists!
---
I‚Äôd play it
---
Imagine still mad posting on the internet about a game post 40.
---
Yep saw it on PB. Good news indeed.
---
Willing to share the fit?
---
All the Retributions I sold last weekend to people wanting to small-gang with Dharen Wakefield say otherwise.
---
If they make it an autistically difficult qualification, like project discovery, then I think even gaming it would be too terrible.
---
Because presenting data to the community properly costs time. A pie chart of 25 different numbers is pure garbage. Many people here also forget that number of bans doesn't equal number of bots in a group. But only that number of bans. With CCPs track record for banning that can mean anything.
---
Based on the email itself, I think it would be automatic, as it's totally just copypasta
---
Pretty new, I kind of want to check out Wormholes and find a Corp for it.
---
What‚Äôs the basic requirements besides exploration and combat skills und learning how to scan before I venture out? I can fly Minmatar BCs (and lower).
---
Its funny that we are getting daily checks that the patient still has a pulse and is still breathing, that means you are winning right?
---
Abyss t3-t5 guarantees you 1x1 when proving conduit gates spawn, but you will not learn there anything
---
Just remember what was going on in their renting space.
---
Hey I play in a Mac with good settings! Though I must admit it's not the best
---
source?
---
o7
---
Wouldn't effect botters much, they will just create a bunch of alpha characters and let them sit for a year! Boom 200 injectable characters or more
---
Yes but this is CCP Games we're talking about.
---
I can't get EVE to work with OSX Mojave.  Anyone know of a workaround.  I'd really like to be able to play at work.

This can run every c3 site in roughly 15 minutes solo. It can be deblinged by using the rigs for fitting/cap taking the price from 1.2b to 600m, but it will be slower and riskier. Bring some faction ammo also for the one site that has webbing cruisers that orbit just outside of Rage range. You can still catch them but if you have to chase them down the site takes a lot longer. Once one or two are dead, the rest can be caught with rage easily.
---
You can also debling it by removing the pvp mods and making it focused on PVE, but where is the fun in refitting?
---
Eeeeew, green is for poors
---
My post had/said nothing about its use, I wasn't talking about the use of said KS, but yes that's the reason why it went online. 
---
For you to jump in so quick to made your comment would suggest your allaince is some what dismayed that you allowed a KS to online.
---
No need to become so triggered, eve is but a game, hope you're okay. I wish you well in space 07
---
The problem is that big shit is balanced bad, not that people get into bad balanced stuff faster. You are trying to cure a symptom not the sickness.
---
Yeah I hate the new fitting warnings telling me all my fits are bad.
---
I am the king of blingy yet still very bad fits myself, ask my exasperated corp leaders.
---
So, you forgot to ask yourself "why would they bother to respond to my one ship that isn't a threat?"
---
There's a war on.  We're not starved for PVP content like PH is, 'cause we're constantly roaming FRT space.
---
You flying around Eso alone, doing nothing in particular, is not all that interesting.  Especially when almost all the solo roamers run when we show up in something that can fight them.  And thanks to all those wonderful cyno changes you WH folks demanded, we know you can't bring in anything interesting.
---
and also forget about the laser range bonus
---
I thought the new player quests took you to a similar setup for your race back in the day.
---
Infallible intuition.
---
It's actually deserved.
---
FW needs a revamp that makes it unbottable. That requires work so CCP just puts little bandaids and calls it a day.
---
Talking points, what are they?
---
You couldn't gets caps in plexes so it doesn't have that big of an impact on FW. Lowsec in general, yes, but FW, no.
---
I remember with one of my old corps we did like a fun fleet idea where everyone had to come up with the stupidest fit they can think of and fly that. I came up with a cruise missile orthrus. Probably one of the most fun fleets I've had.
---
maybe I came across a little like a a-hole in my reply. there is quite a bit of pseudoscience in EVE trying to explain why it's so strange. not sure If anyone linked it yet or not. if not, search on YouTube, there should be a presentation from one of the ccp event there somewhere talking about the "science" of EVE

how about this monstrocity

Yeah, but they are _our_ pathetic bigot hypocrites.

I'm not sure that statement means what you think it means.
---
I got banned and reinstated with an apology because I did nothing wrong. I didn't rejoin the CSM at that point because there was less than a month left in the term, and after two weeks of international news I didn't want any more drama.  
---
I point out where things I've advocated for have been added to the game, yes. This is a perfect example of that and I was one of the only people who was pushing for more transparency on botting reports. So yes, when I see that what I pushed got added, I'm going to point that out. 
---
How many reddit accounts is this for you now?

And you think the players wont scream autisticly again when their playstyle of 110% safety is getting reduced by 1%?

who's next is entirely based on who decides to try and claim the high ground when they're at least as dirty as everyone else. If nc, pl, dead co, etc comes trying to do the same they'll be criticized just as much, the difference is that they aren't.

Ouelletta is where Stay Frosty usually stages from (around there or Avenod is where you are most likely to find us), and any member that agrees to have a 1v1 with you will honour it.

Feel free to ask for advice aswell is you get blown up.

Evan Mclean had constant PvE losses, and moved from Alliance to Alliance. He wasn't a bot, just a moron.

Still lags in huge fleet fights. :^)

I love it
---
&gt; Every single variable in a combat situation means you need to write a code response to it.
---
No. Use prop when out of range(they do this already), orbit and shoot at optimal(they do this already), run the scrams/webs(they do this already) and try to warp out when in structure. This is all the AI NPCs in EVE need.
---
YOU are the one who wants a full blown AI, and then you put the blame on ME because it's impossible to do? lmao get the fuck out

I mean, I have convo requests turned off (keeps folks from sending random fleet invites and fleet warping my titan after all). Does that make me a bot?
---
Good luck getting a convo request through to those of us who autoblock convo requests
---
This, it's also partially about the veteran aspect but that was still mostly about you working with your corp/friends to work out what to dedicate your SP learning time into so you could fill tactical &amp; strategic needs. Things like getting Logi5 or a bubbler were significant milestones for a fleet's potential.
---
Now everyone can just spend isk to refocus their main char onto whatever's wanted the same day/week/war, and any weakness in the meta/balance is immediately exploited.
---
Botting in null regardless what alliance you are in is rife with bots. The issue is that it is mostly undetectable unless you are a moron or your corp mates tell on you to ccp. Mostly for the latter, this happens not as much and the bots in renter spaces are more in the public eye and take most of the flak. 
---
CCP lost the war on bots and RMT years ago and why it keeps coming up.
---
I had tens of trillions of isk squirrelled away on accounts and corp's that I had strategically placed in the event of my banning. I will say that I never RMT'd to this day and sure don't believe me... But ask me if I have now :P
---
RMT in many forms is widely accepted. eg. someone paying for their Hotel room at Vegas and reimbursing his mate with in game ISK.. is this RMT? Well I guess we all have our own version of what is right and wrong. 
---
I myself may have made deals in the region of around 50 trillion isk... I will never disclose who and how but all you need to know is that CCP have no idea wtf is going on. 
---
You can rar rar all you want at CCP, they will never actually give a fuck nor will they take any further steps to prevent it.
---
They did that a year and a half ago when I joined. I'm still kind of wondering why they removed that little quest chain, it was cool, and it couldn't have been hard to just add the current sleeper investigation on top of it, rather than replacing it
---
Grrr injectors, grr cyno changes, grr CCP, grr Hilmar, grr  last Eve Vegas, grr blue donuts, grr that change to which ships can steal those blueprints...  there a starter list.

This is Reddit.  We all shitpost and aren't rooting for anybody.  We are more hoping everybody else fails and dies.
---
&gt; What people forget is that waiting is a lot different when you're greatly limited in what you can do already.
---
But holy shit people have is so much easier these days than before. There's all manner of viable T1 hulls, there's T2 logi frigs, T3 dessies, legalised drugs, burst reps, etc. You can be so much more potent with a few weeks of SP compared to months of it a decade ago.
---
Just this one my friend.  Just this one account.  
---
I like the "international news" bit - can't help but toot your own horn once more, even when it's about your ban.  It's almost like a sickness for you. Hate to break it to you, but Imperium News isn't exactly CNN (Or Hannity, since that's probably where you get your "news")
---
The best fit I've ever seen was a 5x XLASB scorpion with t2 shield boost amps in the other 3 slots. It had upwards of 4k dps tank cold, without drugs (after resists).
---
I wonder what type the largest organisations have? I suspect as a result of the game mechanics it would probably be more autocratic
---
Intriguing - fairly like the amish throughout America. Members are free to move to different communities, which provides a degree of accountability in rule-making.

How much market bot tax isk do you think PH is making every month?

Spreadsheets are usefull for playing EVE. But not required to play EVE.
---
No its a pritty genuin question which "small" allainces did we go for?
---
You do understand that PL is infact a small to med sized allaince and over the last 10 years has had around 450-550 real people in it  so when you say we were picking on the small allaince plz name a single allaince who was smaller than we are/were. you will find that list to be small to nonexsistent.
---
You've been on reddit for a month?  And you spend this much time on my nuts?  Right.
---
No, INN isn't. But Variety, Kotaku, PC Gamer, Polygon, Yahoo News and a bunch of other sites that carry the story are.

Jesus, you can't even criticize me correctly.

All of that implies you're using capacitor cheating like AI currently does, so it's still not like a player at all. You're the one who asked for that, not me.

Hi mum, love you xoxo

lvl up with just $10 and defeat that scary monster
---
No body said that in this thread? They simple said that blackout **DID** infact affect the botting (causing them to move to HS). I know reading comprehension can be hard, but this isn't rocket science.
---
We fixed that bug but........ we broke chat again
---
Only one I see getting triggered is you at us not giving a poop about it. It's in insomother. Pretty irrelevant at current and since keepstar are a dime a dozen now anyways. Even more meh.
---
Cruiser pulse's, MWD/scram + some cap mods in mid so you can't get neuted out and brick the hull out in the lows with transverse bulkhead rigs
---
They won't know wtf is even going on
---
just delete drone auto agro lol ez
---
I keep hoping we'll see some announcement at Vegas or Fanfest next year.  IIRC they were taking feedback and reworking Nova to suit the requests of the players who got hands on. 
---
I loved dust and really want to see an in universe shooter.
---
GRR GONS
---
All Liminal and Zorya variants come with the EM/Kin (50/50 split) missile launchers. They do significantly more dps then the base ship even at full ramp up.
---
Pretty sure this was to force players to build ships for omni resists instead of pure Therm/Exp
---
Everyone who couldn‚Äôt contest your super fleet counts as small in this context.
---
Great detail - it's very similar to international law then, where nations often resort to force but usually always give a reason or justification for doing so. A coherent normative system may have begun to coalesce. Like int. law, it reminds me of prisoner law and how its main goal was to ensure the prison was orderly for the good of the community (ie, so we can all makes lots of money). In EVE it seems there could be tension between players who are happy not to fight, maybe even profit out of low-conflict, and those who want large-scale war (ie, in the criticisms of the 'blue donut'). 
---
Is this a tension you've observed, and what are the main reasons that something like the blue donut has been maintained so long? I heard about some kind of plex scheme between TEST and other alliances in other comments - maybe that's a possible incentive for order.
---
I‚Äôm feeling cute, I might victor later, idk
---
Not everyone is a pirate in life.  :-)
---
A lot depends on what people really see as the ‚Äòworst part‚Äô of injectors.   I think most people would probably say injecting capitals and super capitals.  
---
Why not just not let injector SP not apply to core capital level skills? 
---
Maybe it would not fix everything, but it would be a simple harm mitigation strategy that would not really impact either the basic monetization strategy or access to a mechanism for newer players to get ‚Äòcaught up‚Äô.
---
oh thanks.. didnt know that  boarding ejected ships leave  red flag.
---
more  fit into cargo than 3200
---
afaik they are too new to even be in this pool of data, but I could be mistaken?
---
Your cap booster has a limited capacity. 800s are smaller than 3200 meaning you can get more charges in with each reload.
---
Could you link the threads you're referring to?

In fights, I take it you don't have much of a problem getting your members to participate? Water pirates had a bit of difficulty getting their crewmembers to engage in combat (ie, probs out of fear of being killed), but I guess the lack of death makes life a bit easier for a virtual spaceship captain. 
---
Also, how do you build up enough trust to promote members to higher positions in the corp? I'd be terrified there would be a spy and they'd try to break it down from the inside.

My first big loss was a nightmare, ended up playing with the group that killed me for many years and still in contact with several of them
---
Marauder can tank the sites pretty easily however the Leshak's are OCD about orbiting you at 45k. As soon as you get any closer they quickly speed up to about 1k m/s or more to maintain the distance so you have to be able to hit out at that range. My Golem was rolling through the sites with ease until...
---
The other problem is that roaming trig fleets will occasionally jump to the conduit sites and those fleets are 10x more dangerous than even the worst spawn wave could hope to be for minor conduits. Auto kill if you're stuck in bastion.
---
So the main purpose of the rule is just to clarify what you expect from people and less a communal way of establishing how you're going to run the joint? I've heard EVE online is hoochin' with lawyers - it's more the spirit of the rule right?
---
All CN should be banned ya'll a cancer to majority of games in the world with your bullshit. pay to win can go fuck itself. There is a reason you had your own server and fucked it up.

---
A decade ago you also didn't have people with 15+ years lead on you.
---
Every MMO has some kind of issue like that. In Runescape, you were gated by the need to do a *ton* of grinding. In WoW and those type of MMO's you need to do less grinding to get to max level, but there's more effort into getting good and finding a raiding guild, for example. In Eve, its a time gate. Sure, implants make it ~20% faster, but outside of injectors, there really isn't a way you can *do* something new without just waiting.
---
For example, I wanted to fly incursions when I found out about them. Should I have waited 2 months to get into the hull? Or inject and be able to fly within a few days? After all, when you're new, ISK isn't much use if you aren't solely PVP focused - ships are cheap. So I use it on injectors.
---
If, like me, your goal is to get to "end game" stuff, waiting months or a year isn't appealing. And quite frankly, if people who have been playing for years and can do that stuff already don't like it, I don't really mind either.
---
had zorya leshak.... dont need to know more. tried to isolate bitch but nope.
---
ok dude, no need to get upset about onlining a ks these days.
---
Age of Chaos
---
&gt; I'm saying CCP still hasn't done anything to address the ease of botting
---
Except that one time when they made it an order of magnitude easier with skill injectors
---
Using 3200s just nets you more cap/s. And using navy 3200 lets you have more of them in your cargo. No point in using 800s except if you are in fleet and are being neuted and need frequent cap injections to sustain guns/hardeners/prop.
---
UPSHIFT IN YOUR MIND THEN
---
Very true. Ok then let me change that. What about...
---
If it were made in office for mac 2001 it would have been the icing on the cake...or word perfect even.
---
honestly let ccp add a drone faction with 0.0 space in the drone lands + give it no lowsec gate so stainguy can campain for one
---
Doesn't come close to rorquals lol
---
Navy 800 and navy 3200 have same cap/m3
---
Will suffice!
---
As a fellow Mac user, I‚Äôm also disappointed. Have they even mentioned it anywhere?
---
Oh great another "quick fix" that in reality would change nothing, the bot program would just have to "sort by range, attack)
---
Making all drones behave like fighters would help but its still not impossible to script and would make every drone boat cancer.

---
I haven't seen anything yet.
---
ye right super krabbing and multi rorq mining totally doesnt affect me....ever heard of plex? and ingame economics?....
---
Advantages: 800 take up less space (even in proportion) and if you need to run something like a hardener under cap pressure it will not make much difference if you inject 800 or 3200 as the cap will be neuted dry anyway.
---
Disadvantages: injecting 800s as a rule of thumb gives you less overall cap than 3200 even when factoring in reload time. Not always true, depending on the fit, but in 99% of the cases it's so. 
---
Protip and something I didn't notice myself until it was pointed out to me: if you plan to cap inject the biggest cap charge size that fits in your cap booster go for meta (more fitting space), if you plan to use undersized cap charges go for t2 / faction (can store more charges than its meta counterpart).
---
That‚Äôs all you need to play eve
---
as expected a lot of " muh let him play...." comments.
---
i know its pathetic to be offended by someone doing spaceship things in a sandbox spaceship mmo.
---
but actually im offended by the fact that this is normal nowadays..vendetta ratting...super rattin in general, and titan ratting ( still a thing?)
---
the retarded thing is, that its even possible to do that. spacerich krablord, uses spacerich spacetoys to get more spacerich on top of his riches..man its ridiculous :D
---
what are people doing with all that isk? right buying a vendetta to make ..more isk? that seems to be a very dull way to play eve. but whatever floats peoples boats i guess . right?
---
but pls dont complain about plex prices going up and shit. because a lot of nerds decide to super krab and multirorq......
---
reddit is a fun place. lot of spodbrains immune to reality checks.

vOv
---
You have not sufficiently argued your point to change the fact that you are still some basement dwelling dick head that needs to tell someone else enjoying their time that they are bad and should feel bad for it.
---
What about instead of doing this, get rid of skill injectors and replace them with boosters. Make for example a booster that gives 500.000sp with a duration of 2 weeks. Which is essentially the same as being able to use an injector every two weeks (but without getting the sp instantly).
---
this is the best answer, on sisi, enter it with the dropdown in the bottom right in your launcher, everything costs 100isk, use /moveme in chat and go to the main testing system, there are becons called "Combat Arena", sit on a keepstar tether next to a CA1 or 2 and wait for oppontents, you can also just ask someone for 1v1s and test fits against each other.
---
No endless roams through dead space, content on-demand, no PvE to get to the arena, it doesn't even matter when you close the client cause you have to go. 
---
You can do it while in a boring fleet on TQ.
---
However i'm not sure how active the CAs are nowadays, might only find people to play with in EU prime.

‚ÄúWhy? Cuz fuck‚Äôem that‚Äôs why!‚Äù

---
XD
---
We are together because we like to shoot people, so if anything there are questions when we ocassionally ask people NOT to shoot someone xD
---
By fights in my previous comment I meant verbal discussions between corp members.
---
Promotions are rare and usually done to fill voids in leadership due to people leaving the game or the corp, and are done at a discretion of the CEO previous consultation to the other directors to see if there is any issue he's not aware of. The decision is made based on trust over time playing together and if the person can contribute to the corp... as a rule of thumb, we don't promote people that ask for promotions.
---
But spies are a reality in EVE, and trust is the most valuable asset anyone has... worst that could happen is that someone steals whatever little riches we have as a corp. We have real bonds that keep us together, and those can't be easily broken, if anyone tryies stirr shit or create drama we swiftly deal with them.
---
As a group that promotes "solo" gameplay and fun amongst their ranks we don't tax our members, most of the funds for different activities we decide to do or infrastructure we use comes out of leadership's own wallets at their will (as an example, me and another director have hundreads of ready to use combat ships on contracts at a very very small markup so people can just buy them and keep fighting, and the money put into it -that is recovered if the contract is accepted by member and redirected to supply more ships- comes from our own pockets). So there isn't much material posessions that a spy could actually steal from us as a group.
---
The last splinter group that attempted to steal from another corp in the alliance not only failed (we got everything returned to the allied corp), but we destroyed every structure they had, infiltrated their ranks, seeded drama and confusion and spread the word about them being corp thefts around Lowsec (the area of the game we operate in).
---
&gt;Legit players 
---
Are we still doing that meme? Everyone knows a massive chunk of that were people that unsubbed their krabbing alts and only kept their main and maybe few alts active. If you want to push a narrative, goonfleet.com is that way -&gt;
---
Oh shit. For a second I thought it was my account.
---
you now thats a lot of effort, pos trapping and days of waiting and all that, just to pad my killboard ( as loot goes to FC or shared with fleet..not much profit to be made by that kind of piracy)....no thanks ;)
---
Ahh man... I could do some pretty game breaking stuff if I could write VBA macros to control Eve.
---
how dare his playstyle keeps fucking up eve economy...
---
Ah. I haven't played in months since there isnt anything I really find enjoyable in the game anymore. The ship was around like ~300m area. Didnt know it went back up.
---
there's already a diminishing return on high sp characters that's so high nobody bothers with them after 50msp or so.
---
THIS IS WHY THE AWOXING EXISTS. BATPHONE IF YOU WANT BACKUP
---
To add to the story, CCP didn't like that Yulai was a trade hub and wanted trade to be in every region and in every system. That's why they removed the central location of Yulai, hoping that trade would move throughout the game. They kind of gave up after Jita became the main hub and focused on lowering the lag on Jita by removing mission agents and routing gates around Jita so that you only go in Jita if you want to trade, any other travel has you passing near but never entering the system.
---
For a long time Amarr, Rens, Dodixie and Hek were also big trade hubs and to some extent, they still are. As the game moved forward though, most of the trading slowly got concentrated into Jita and all of the other trade hubs suffered. Amarr is still a decent trade hub, but Rens, Dodixie and Hek just aren't as big as they used to be.

Tbh, building 200 titans in three years isn't that difficult if you're committed to it. 45b minerals is quite easy to mine when multiboxing a shitton of rorquals (thx to injectors), those roid suckers are scaling very well. Don't misunderstand me, 200 titans is an impressive fleet, but the IG mechanics have evolved and times where building a titan was a pain in the ass are long gone. 
---
And about cynojammers, i Wonder how will react legacy when goon will rush esoteria. Fighting against two or three times your own numbers on some fights doesn't leave that much options. Would you have committed your titan fleet knowing you'll get blobbed and raped? I don't think so, nobody would.
---
That being said, cynojams and ansiblexes need to dissapear from the game asap, they're broken as fuck.

If you don't let them shoot it more it repairs itself.

Oh I have zero issue with RMT, like none. If CCP enforced a ban on botting I'd be happy with people promoting RMT.
---
CCP loves to place a dim light on RMT quoting crediting card fraud/theft, slavery, stolen accounts &amp; botting to RMT when in fact all these things exist in game due to CCP &amp; player incompetence rather than RMT. If CCP bothered to enforce a bot ban then RMT should not be viewed as a negative thing as it's just players cashing out on normal game activity while others pay for that head start. RMT literally has zero effect on the EVE economy only botting does in that regards. Having a botting back bone is essential to be succesful in both RMT &amp; as a major null entity.

 When not been neuted using cap 800‚Äôs in a longer fight is more efficient as you can keep your cap lower meaning you get more natural cap regen from been in the 30-50% cap range rather than using 3200‚Äôs and going from 30% cap to like 90% in one blast.

You get it xD

Maybe you should have had a better understanding of the defense mechanics before you anchored your own structure. You now have a timer you have to defend. If you succeed the structure repairs itself, you don‚Äôt need to rep it.
---
what kind of degenerate types in all caps you ask!? not this kind ;) \^\^ that kind...
---
Sustain vs burst capacitor, depends how long you want the fight to last and what you're planning to fight. Short brawl, no neuts? 3200s. Longer fight? 800s. Of course, against heavy neuting, like a curse of two, neither is going to be particularly effective.
---
Bigot.. fml
---
Yes, yes we should.
---
Don't you like ChAoS?!??

I come home from work yesterday and my son who just started playing EVE after hearing me talk about it for most of his life, says "Dad, I finally started playing EVE today, but every time I undock from the station, I get blowed up by these trivgalaviananans.  What am I doing wrong?"
---
Son, it's not you, it's CCP.  
---
It's always CCP.
---
So it was not fulled.... do you know what attacked it? 
---
In 4 days when the timer runs out who ever shot it will have 30mins to attack and kill it.
---
You actually can if you have ping bookmarks beyond - you can warp@100 to a BM or warpable object 150km away. This is great for dropping on top of people in sites with asteroids or collidable objects in scenery a long way from the centre (as long as they're not deadspace obviously).
---
Actually it does.
---
"If the repair timer naturally expires, the structure fully recovers from the attack. Its shields, armor and hull are restored to full values."
---
It was a war from a corporation claiming the station that was abandoned
---
Yeah, MWD + cloak is almost guaranteed safety - most gate camps and ganking groups don't run with the light tackle needed to get a decloak and tackle on you in a single MWD cycle.
---
I still okay fine with a Mac (? Maybe because I don't use wine?
---
But limiting data to past x years is better than all time.
---
A couple assfrigs? What scrubs have you been fighting to think the orthrus is that trash?
---
Just make your ship tank ready and you'll survive most encounters. And don't use something like Iteron MK 5 unless u like living dangerously, use fast industrials like Nereus and tank it.
---
What if the real chaos era was all the subs ccp lost along the way?!
---
found the QFC rules: https://pastebin.com/v8UH4rHA
---
Probably about the same as goon and the holy bot crusaders in TAPI.
---
And more to the point, how exactly would you propose a market owner track and remove bots from their public market?  The tools to hunt renter bots are pretty bad but they at least exist in some form, and you can kick players/corps found botting.  Pretty hard to do anything at all like that for market bots.
---
How I bashed my first POCO
---
&gt; You can be so much more potent with a few weeks of SP compared to months of it a decade ago.
---
And still not be potent enough for PvP without several more months of SP because everyone you're fighting has every relevant skill maxed out.  Injectors are an inevitable result of a skill system that rewards ass-sitting with objective performance improvements.
---
Most be up to t2 haulers way better.
---
Calm down miner.
---
I have a rattle that tanks 2.24k and deals a little over 130o dps. I havent undocked it yet, but someday
---
Because the character bazaar totally didnt exist
---
Veteran = time not SP to anyone with a brain
---
isnt cache actually owned by iron crown?
---
or is it just me?
---
It will die.         
---
This is very soft target also you don't sound like you could form a defensive fleet for the timer.
---
&gt;Or a better prediction. The missiles in EVE are just really dumb and just burn directly at the target with no prediction whatsoever.
---
You can't predict other people's action. You can predict orbits when there is no external force but gravitational forces. When your target has thrusters your prediction is nothing more than a wild guess. That is why air-air (fighter vs fighter) missiles burn fuel constantly.
---
&gt; but the Billions ended up in Legacy Manhattan Project
---
Citation needed.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt;There's a video of actually shooting down something in space that is  moving.
---
Moving due to gravitational forces only, which makes the movement very predictable.
---
HOW DARE YOU! 
---
We at CODE are the most honourable group in EVE. If you have your permit in your bio as you are instructed to and you are following the CODE you are more than safe!
---
PLUS you can choose to move said stuff to another citadel in system for free. That avoids the regular tax on asset safety.
---
Implying they undocked.
---
do you know why?
---
because chicken thigh
---
The diamond rats and burner missions were another example. They took player fits, plugged them in, and spit out Africanized rats.
---
I'm looking at the graph - it says you are wrong.
---
FUCK OFF WITH THAT CAPS LOCK ON BULLSHIT  
---
#HOLDSHIFTGANG
---
Nice
---
For what it is worth, if you are thinking of flying solo in a brawling Thorax/ExNI/Vigilant seriously consider dropping a gun for a Nos - cap is your weakness and you have plenty of dps to withstand the loss of a gun. Then you can dual prop/scram/web it as well (point not scram for the Vigilant is probably a better choice).
---
Just a thought...
---
Yeah. But this fit is like 120 mil after insurance.
---
&gt;the retarded thing is, that its even possible to do that. spacerich krablord, uses spacerich spacetoys to get more spacerich on top of his riches..man its ridiculous :D
---
&gt;
---
&gt;what are people doing with all that isk? right buying a vendetta to make ..more isk? that seems to be a very dull way to play eve. but whatever floats peoples boats i guess . right?
---
&gt;but pls dont complain about plex prices going up and shit. because a lot of nerds decide to super krab and multirorq......
---
Poor guy is super butthurt he's not good enough to kill krabs.
---
Democracy doesn‚Äôt work well with space empires. It‚Äôs been tried before to hilarious failure. 
---
The best-run large entity in the game, The Imperium, exists as a benevolent dictatorship managed daily by a directorate of people with highly specific jobs. Any rules are clearly spelled out so that if policies are broken, the varying levels of punishments are justified.
---
I know that if I follow the rules, I‚Äôll reap uncountable rewards. And if I go fuck-goons, I‚Äôd be commissared immediately.
---
The Falcon is BPC. I've been asked that question a lot, understandable with the recent changes.
---
that was much more complicated and you couldn't just get 10 rorq pilots over night.
---
The Cap parts are BPC's, 5 run each 10/20's.
---
I do wish the moons were better though
---
Let's suppose that you're looking for a corp, and I'm an officer in that corp. You tell me you're looking for a corp with the best refer-a-friend program. Most refer-a-friend programs that I'm aware of (e.g. CCP's) are 1-time benefits given when the referred friend does something useful (e.g. pays for a month of Omega time).
---
From my perspective, neither of you are loyal members of my corp yet. You're asking me to pay you a 1-time bonus for the act of doing something useful. This is highly transactional. After you've done the useful thing and I've paid you for it, what evidence of your loyalty do I have?
---
For most corps, taking in new members is a cost that we pay because we need to replenish our crew from time to time as members leave. We're already in the hole taking you on, and then recoup our investment over time as you prove your loyalty and activity. Most member benefits I'm aware of are benefits over time. For example, my corp provides free replacement Sabres. Many corps in fact have some form of ship replacement program, and most of those preferentially replace ships that are needed by their fleets (often expensive tackle ships and logistics ships).
---
isnty whs full of bots too?
---
You have to understand that the "delete drone aggro" argument isn't intended to affect botting in the slightest. It's using botting as the moral framework for removing quality of life from actual players. The aim was never to impact botting in the first place, only visit harm upon those the poster deems below them.
---
and yet, someone has to do that. they have to build something that will pull that data, squirt it into a BI tool (or troll it by hand - gross), and spend hours after chasing after and shadowing suspects.
---
instead of just playing the game.
---
i hate botters as much as the next guy and i love getting to drop and gank one (doubly so if it's a blue), but even at my level doing corp leadership i'd rather /wrists than do the equivalent of data security analysis in a game. especially when the game owners have full access to their own database and can do it faster and more effectively (and get *PAID* to do it).
---
How, in the sweet fuck, are you supposed to play?
---
I‚Äôd also suggest reaching out on Twitter to The Mittani, leader of The Imperium. He‚Äôs a lawyer by trade and well-studied on organizational theory.
---
I don't take advice from anyone stupid enough to still be playing EVE in 2019.   You need a break from your addiction, kid.
---
Generally you get dropped outside the plex by a cloaked super and their alt
---
cHaOs is a ladder.. or exit door.
---
Thank you for your advice and taking the time to look at some of my matches. 
---
Most matches I've had they came to me. I didn't want to get into buying drugs just because my budget is tight and I figured if I dont have basics down, I shouldn't worry about it anyway.
---
Notes from you responses though.
---
- approach (depending on fit) the minute they are the overview.
---
- set auto reload off on reppers 
---
- overload reppers when necessary
---
LOL, that's true, I had planned to do it before the 10 months but just didn't have the time IRL to dedicate to it until then.
---
i was more thinking limiting skills that can be trained by skill injection, like how alphas have certain limitations. though a bit late now
---
Air-air missiles have to fight air resistance.
---
Most EVE ships aren't moving erratically. They are moving at a constant velocity following a predictable path the majority of the time.
---
Remember, ships have have thrusters but they also have drag, so they just move at a top speed.
---
So is it worth to even invest into missiles further? That means maxing them out, like: Torpedoes to V, HAM to V, support skills to V (i.e. missile bombardment etc), with some T2/3 hulls which are missile-friendly (like frigs/destro/cruisers, ergo jackdaws, hawks talwars, bombers) AND then after all that some turrets?  
---
OR keep them at current level, while switching to turrets and hulls
---
Being jammed by rats on an adjacent gate 16,000km away is also a fun one.
---
It's an orbit.
---
Of you're moving in an orbit it's the same.
---
Constant velocity in a circle.
---
It is irrelevant the forces being applied to make that happen.
---
You are never truly safe, even in High security space. Pvp is discouraged but still allowed, so never fly a ship you can't afford to lose. Also, if you find the PvE grind boring, there are other options available to you other than running mission, you just need to dig a bit. Fly safe o7
---
Hi! 
---
There are lots of ways to have fun in EVE, so what do you enjoy doing? 
---
The best recommendations I can give you are to try lots of play styles, and to join a corporation. (Like a guild in other games)
---
* Join a Corp. This game is a lot more fun with friends.  If you dont like that Corp join another Corp. Repeat until satisfied.
---
* Dont let the salt level on this subreddit have any affect on your fun. If you enjoy your time when undocked thats about all that matters.
---
* Dont worry about the pursuit of one gamestyle or the other. If you try mining and dont like it go try something else. Same goes for ratting, missions, ganking, hunting, ISK making, whatever.
---
* Not everyone is trying to scam you.  Dont give people your things but also dont worry too much about a conversation or a chat with a person somehow turning into some grand ruse to trick you. When you are new you have very little that is worth the time to try to steal.
---
* Have fun.
---
Thanks for your advice! I dont in impossible matchups though :). In fighters there such thing as 8-2 matchups that recommend the player to switch characters.
---
Still, I'm not at that point yet, and I will learn more fighting shils I'm not completely outclassed by to to your point.
---
Is there a good *free* recording software I can use? Tired of being trash at PvP. Trying to learn from my mistakes.
---
Yes, so one can be left behind.  It doesn't take cargo-space when fitted.
---
Of course that's not practical anymore.
---
Not to mention that the kind of software needed is *hard to make.* If it was easy to make, you'd see one or more of this list of things.
---
* CCP would catch bots dramatically more often than now.
---
* There would be an open source forensic accounting suite for catching bots, whose use was enforced by community peer pressure.
---
* Spies would use it to punish hostiles for harboring bots by prioritizing reports/etc on bots being harbored by hostiles.
---
And so on. Turns out, software of this caliber simply isn't available at all. The people who can make it are using these talents to make actual money, not play unpaid forensic accountant for a space-themed spreadsheet to the benefit of an actual for-profit real life corporation.
---
I challenge anyone out there to develop an open source forensic accounting software solution, if it's so easy.
---
Good point, do girls even get ESI checked?
---
Don‚Äôt fly anything you don‚Äôt want to lose. Join the Z-S overview channel in game and follow the instructions. Makes the overview actually worth something.
---
just you.
---
By the way this is Version: **17.08.1573360**
---
Continue with the careers agents, it‚Äôs good isk and an ok tutorial of the basis of the game. The next step is gonna be hard cause you are in a sandbox game but the my best advice is try different style of gameplay and find the thing you have the most fun doing and learn how to make isk doing it. 
---
I see a lot of new player looking the best way to make isk at day 1 and burn themselves out not realizing they created a new job for them...
---
Ships are ammo
---
Safety should always be on red
---
Never not fight adapt with your losses and you will learn 10 faster than any tutorial etc will teach you.
---
Join a corp but remember there is many paths in this game with many twists and turns.
---
Most important have fun!
---
Ok, lets put this as basic as possible:  A Raitaru has shield, armor, and structure, just like a ship.  However, if you are not running any services in your structure, its defenses are really weak.  When you are running at least one service, attackers have to hit your structure three different times:  Shield, armor, and structure.  Since it appears you were not running any service, the shield and armor can be taken off in one attack.  Like others have said, if the attackers do not come back for the next timer, your Raitaru will immediately repair to full.  If they attack it, and you don't have a way to defend it, it's probably going to die.
---
I'd start moving stuff out to an NPC station before that timer expires, so your items don't end up in Asset Safety.
---
Not that ive seen
---
Thanks for your advice! There were a few times before I went off I forgot to load my nanite paste or my booster :/. Something I never did, was set my distances:/ so I'll def do that now.
---
As far as zkill goes I need to use that more, but I guess if I warp in a area of 20+ people I'm not going to look all of them up?
---
I guess this is just information just incase I run into them later?
---
    ‚ÄúIf your opponent is of choleric temperament, seek to irritate him.‚Äù
---
Did Sun Tzu invent shitposting?
---
You can tell that these guys are still new to TQ, they think onlining a keepstar is a big deal still.
---
What am I suppose to do?
---

---
I think it would be ironic if test did a propaganda series with fake sun tzu quotes from chinadino.
---
That would be even better, since you didn't lose the ship but still push your goal
---
fuck you all mine
---
I spent way longer looking at this than it had any right to occupy my attention.
---
i usually load 3200 into my BS. But I dont put 3200 into cargo hold. So when you go into fight 1st use that loaded 3200, then switch to 800.
---
Get out there and get blown up, then go back with what you‚Äôve learned
---
I love the premise behind your research. Eve is probably one of the few games where such a complex and colorful government simulation can operate. This is sometimes called meta-gaming and takes place well outside game parameters. 
---
That‚Äôs how you get so many space jobs that exist in Eve (but are undefined by the actual game) like spies/counterintelligence, diplomats, internal affairs/compliance, finance directors, cartels, recruiters, marketing/propaganda, military strategists, logistics managers, DARPA-like teams and others. 
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible for corp/alliance leaders to do their thing without ever logging into the game. It‚Äôs easy to do with external third-party tools and a solid organizational infrastructure.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
The red flag is a sudden gain in assets with zero reasoning on how you got them. There is no transaction log for getting an ejected ship so they won't see that. If you make your transaction history filled with buying and selling stuff you can probably sneak it in but Plex is easier and easy to explain
---
Yea that doesn't bother me at all. Again my background is fighting games and I dont play top tier characters. I'm used to 8-2 matchups :) thanks for your advice!
---
Sooo like how pirates work?
---
It's a bit of both. Most of the time we follow our rules to the letter, with the rules carefully spelled out to achieve the goal. But we're not above booting someone who has just figure out a novel way to be a problem.
---
Depends on situation like everything else. 3200 is better for most situations but I can see 800s being better IF
---
1. Your essential modules can be activated with 800 cap
---
2. You're under heavy continuous neut pressure (like enough to neut away a 3200 in a tick)
---
So that way you can pop cap booster and your mods in 2 ticks  and stay alive.
---
So two cans are the goals each side, another can is the ball in the center of the pitch. The idea is to use tractor beam to drag the can to the goal. whoever is tractoring the ball can be jammed and his tractor beam will turn off.
---
I would just say that a lot of people are going to tell u to go to null and join a newbie corp but I don‚Äôt really think that is as beneficial as it use to be. If you want to do that to learn the basics it‚Äôs not a bad idea but the isk making potential is awful and unless you go completely out of ur way u are not really going to learn anything beyond the basics. On the other hand, if u want to be apart of a community and just kind of go with the wind, large null corps are the way to go.
---
Grr, how dare people have fun/do what they want with their own money and time!  
---
Quit being a bigot...
---
Didn't want those players anyway.
---
Tappits has the right of it.  If you're not facing neuts, you want 800's, its just a better fit, however considering how often you get neuted smart BS pilots will pack 3200's because the increase in the amount injected will often times allow you to do more under that pressure from the larger pool.
---
\&gt;Legacy members parrot for evidence  
---
\&gt;Evidence is provided  
---
\&gt;Legacy turns out to be the host for a dozen historic botting corps/alliances.
---
i don't have any problems with a gameplay style of "abuse whatever is most broken at the time" but it is somewhat passe to whine that you have to change the particular broken mechanic every so often
---
iron crown, the ally of WC you mean? or even a part of WC? I can't really remember
---
Trim the bulk of course.
---
I don‚Äôt know how to do that? Unless you‚Äôre trolling.
---
IMAGINE A FREE INTEL CHAT CHANNEL BEING THE ONLY REASON YOU PLAY THE GAME
---
Asset safety goes to npc station.
---
Then quit cloaking coward
---
Try checking your cache for corrupt files from your launcher, might be that but idk
---
Implying they could move 127B in one undock
---
I really liked the blackout but I do a bunch of smaller scale shit and it made our lives easier and our fleets more fun since we could surprise people more often. It seemed like it was hurting CCP in the wallet so they got the yips and pulled it back. 
---
What else can they do as far as large scale shakeups? Nerf the ever living fuck out of citadels(please), somehow deal with TZ tanking because it fucking sucks, find a way to shoot bots out of a cannon and into the upper atmosphere, and either create gameplay for supers/titans or delete them entirely and(maybe) watch a few thousand subs walk away. Im all about the big shakeup because I dont have a pot to piss in and nothing to lose so what did I miss?
---
The amount of r/whoosh in the replies made this so worth it
---
So people with alts aren't legit players? You are a special kind of stupid.
---
The point is no player can do CCPs job. No matter who is crying about the bots on the wrong side of their war. You think anyone liked bots for the decade that NCPL was running botting rackets? They couldn‚Äôt enforce any more or less than Test or FRT.
---
Idgaf about cloaking carebear
---
Get out while you still can...
---
booooooo
---
join lots of corps, preferably ones with free ship handouts or reimbursement programs so you can get involved without having to worry about making money to be involved.
---
Only it is only conjecture that they moved to high sec. The lower numbers on DOTLAN only show there were fewer characters ratting, not whether those players were bots or not.
---
A massive ban wave hit at same time as blackout. That event probably did mote to help combat botting than loss of local ever could.
---
I agree with this one. I like to have a 3200 loaded to start the fight off.  That way I can see how the initial fight goes and then be able to dump back to full cap instantly... Then it's on to the 800s in the cargo to sustain the fight
---
And totally removed the risk of getting caught by adding alphas on top of injectors.
---
They gotta be in fleet together too.
---
Sadly had to wait in the rain to get recovered  no spare(nanite paste) luckily I had my ship insurance do it‚Äôs work 2 new tyres needed for me now though üò≠
---
Lets do a titan roam at somepoint ^^ xD
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Try as many playstyles as you can. 
---
Once you've found what you enjoy, find a corp that does that.
---
If you don't like being in that corp.or don't like doing the activity you once did, change corp/activity.
---
Jita is the games main trade hub.
---
EVERYTHING in Jita chat channel.is a scam.
---
Don't try to earn isk to pay for your subscription until your earning shitloads of isk (I don't do it at all because it makes the game feel like work)
---
Defo try the PvP, you will die but you will also.learn.
---
As others have mentioned, the Amamake area is great for solo.  However, the real trick is memorizing the locals and not engaging some who will always blob.  Using local, dscan and szkill, you can get good intel and know if you're going in 1v1, 1v2 (sometimes fine) or if they're about to bring backup.  Off the top of my head, avoid Smile n Wave at all costs, they literally always blob, often baiting with t1 frigates and bringing t3s, and be cautious around Ushra Khan, hull pen, and DHSJ
---
Sounds nice!
---
You can't really expect them to respond manually to each and every single report though. C'mon...
---
people already break up large fleets into separate wings anyway, can u imagine trying to logi with 1000 people broadcasting at the same time?
---
yes but  you can put more navy 800 than navy 3200
---
It will suck him in! He will never know the sunlight again, the simulation will become his life lol "What do you mean EvE isnt real life?
---
* Download the Pyfa fitting tool. 
---
* make fits and theorycraft while bored, or watching netflix or mining, or ratting.  Read about the ship stats, their layouts, resists.
---
* familiarize yourself as best you can with the ships in the game.  Look at killboards and see which ships are at the top, who the top pilots are and look at their fits.  Try and learn how and why they are fitting their ships a certain way.
---
* watch a bunch of youtube video tutorials on PVP.  Even if you never PVP, those skills will help keep you alive and will allow you to learn how to avoid fights and if need be, take a fight. 
---
* DO NOT FLY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.  
---
*ACCEPT THAT THE SHIP YOU ALREADY UNDOCKED IN IS ALREADY DEAD AS ARE YOUR IMPLANTS. 
---
* If you aren't having fun, try something different. 
---
* make friends.  Eve is a very social game.  I have been playing 7+ years and am pretty close with those I have flown with and am a better pilot and have more fun because of it.  PM me if you ever have any questions.  Friend or foe I will always be happy to help.  Also scams are real, so double check, verify and if it looks too good to be true.... It is probably a trap.
---
That doesn't add pixels
---
Thats not the lowest setting.... you didnt turn color off
---
just dont forget to manually reload 800's :D
---
Hey thanks for answering and giving the extra tip! I was doing the math over here and I couldn‚Äôt find one benefit in using the 800s. 
---
Thanks everyone else who answered as well! Lots of useful info!
---
o/
---
but does it come in a 64 bit version?
---
You can also go on Sisi test server and ask in M-O for a 1 vs 1.  tell them in local you are new pilot and some people will be happy to help.  Don't over bling your fits even though they are free as it will be a crutch to you when you get on TQ.
---
We all know that banning bots is totally pointless unless you prevent bot users to create new accounts and build another bot army to replace the previous.
---
CCP should change the launcher and use it to detect users in a precise and objective way, for example using hardware data (Windows do the same since ages).
---
In this way when someone get caught botting will be banned with all its accounts, and will not be able to create new accounts.
---
In this way the botter is forced to change hardware, which is expensive or inconvenient for most of the people.
---
Today on reddit.. spin the Keepstar
---
Well, if we did that, then people wouldn't inject into blops day 1, then buy a few marshalls, and then proceed to lose over 200 billion isk while only killing a ceptor
---
Sorry. I just absolutely do not care. 
---
(only because of what subreddit i'm in)
---
Those who know; know the goal is -50 per day. When eve stopped being fun I started pvp on the forums. The combat is far more satisfying as everyone takes it seriously again, just like the good old days. Sadly I sometimes make good points and perfectly good troll posts get up-voted. 
---
Shit happens. Now fuck off.
---
anything is easy to multibox in tidi :/

CCP doesn't want witch hunts which you seem quite keen on
---
Having actual formations and getting a bonus for staying in them during fights would have been awesome. Get some real fleet commander perks going on.
---
... unless it spoils your risk free or near-AFK (which is almost impossible to distinguish from botting) ratting, of course.
---
holy hypocrisy batman
---
https://www.thealphasguide.com/ This is a good place to start. Then you need to join a corp, like other people have said. I'd recommend Brave, Pandemic Horde, and maybe TRU if you want a smaller group. I don't know too much about them, but they might be worth a shot. Just be aware you can jump to Horde or Brave if you don't like them, or visa versa.

---
&gt; These are not decision that I make
---
Yeah we'd noticed, your manifesto for the future of Eve sounded great though.
---
Yes, injectors made it more convenient, but that's it. I don't see how acting like you haven't always been able to buy SP isn't disingenuous. I'm probably just in the minority, agree to disagree, etc

lol, most orthrus pilots arent smart enough to stop their rapid lights while the ADC is running so they waste part of the cycle and end up in a long reload. And, there are PLENTY of bad orthrus pilots.
---
Ahh the fabulous mechanic of instant catch-up for our dear new players. It is just a coincidence it came up prior to investors selling CCP to Koreans.  It was just by chance, CCP waited for so long with fixing ghost training exploit.  It was just a slight oversight that completely unregulated use of  injectors benefit older and already established players and whales way more. 
---
In my opinion they have widened the gap between new and older players, highlighted economy issues helping exploit endlessly respawning resources in null (another very fucking questionable mechanic).  Also they diminished the consequence of your actions/reputation in game - you can just suck your burned spy/awox/scam alts and create new one on a whim.  
---
Skill injectors would be so much better for the game if they actually let new players train new player things, not putting everyone and their dog instatnly in fucking capitals. It is too late now, damage is already done and we have to live with it.  Watching IronBank injecting fresh char into max SP on stream was a sickening experience, giving insight for a future of EVE

Pretty sure you can still get 1v1s in RvB. Red Corp and Blue Corp are still at war with one another.
---
I'd suggest uninstalling and reinstalling. Something may have gotten corrupted.
---
You could just buy another toon off the bazaar though. The genie is out of the injector.

I would upvote if it was actually Excel for MacOS.

What's hypocritical about that? I've never claimed to care about the quality of life of other players. I have never wielded fake video game morality as a cudgel.

"It's just pixels" is a lie (space) rich players like to tell. Because it's not just pixels, it's also the time you have invested to build them. They're a goal you have achieved. They're your source of in-game income which enables you. Space rich players have forgotten that and plexers never did, because they're just throwing money at a screen.

But they dont do anything, yes there are system wide effects, but they're not interactive in anyway
---
Right right. I forgot that Bot developers have crack teams at work, quickly rewriting their bots to no longer use the most useful source of intel available to them, instead relying on "gate camper" bots to provide the intel to the Bot. Also, -everyone- who bots in Eve has access to those same super spiffy bots, and therefore removal of local had no affect on any bots whatsoever.
---
If you *truly* believe all that, instead of simply pushing a narrative, then I have a bridge to sell you my friend.

It's pretty clear at this point that CCP wants this game to end.

It's interesting to try and see how rapidly you can advance an alpha without being subsidized by a high SP omega or plex. On the bright side you can start managing your own corporation pretty early. All you need is one cheap skill and about a million isk.

tbf Solar isn't in Legacy now, it's just dead. I think MACTEP is the only one who is still in SOLAR anything and plays.
---
Just fit 5 XLASBs, 3 SBA, and then the rest is pretty simple. Enough cpu lows to make the fitting work, a damage control, and then cargo expanders (to hold more cap boosters). Rigs are just resists.
---
That's been phased out. The NPE is now just a series of 5(6?) quests lead by Aura.
---
There's landmarks in a lot of systems that have little things like this, but CCP has a very heavy Amarr bias so they get the lion's share of new landmarks.
---
True true
---
The fact that CCP hasn't added new anoms or signatures, a proven working system, throughout the years is just breathtaking. Seriously add some new and interesting content CCP. Hire a mission/anom/signature designer to just add a new mission/anom/sig every few weeks. Some of the old event sites can even be re-used to add new anoms/sigs.
---
This is all low hanging fruit that takes minimal new investment but greatly prolongs the life of the game.
---
They'll just enter warp after 3 minutes.
---
The problem is this doesn't jive with the looming threat of alliance leaders not witch hunting for bots.

Why is it unreasonable to feel like these things are mutually exclusive?
---
The fuck is a Neon Ishtar?
---
They also happen to be systems that are described as 'rookie systems' by CCP, and as such receive specific protections because of it [(list)](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing). Imagine if there was a type of incursion that made some systems suddenly but temporally NS. Would it make sense for those invasions to extend to tutorial systems? Sure, they get a warning before entering system, but a good number of people are just going to click through any popup message they see, they are just going where they have been directed to go to continue the tutorial after all. Arguing that new players need to HTFU for get out is all well and good for the memes, but new players are leaving the game for something as simple as getting such on a rock when trying to warp, imagine how they react to getting killed by NPCs on a gate when they try to enter the next tutorial system. As much as we like EVE to be one of the hardest games around to master, a 2% player retention rate after the first 30 days is incredibly bad for the long term health of the game. Besides, I'm yet to see an argument that this should happen, only arguments that say we should do nothing to change the sandbox, even if it makes things easier for new players.
---
The most infamous is the "ochre rule" of goonswarm. Which I think was referenced elsewhere in this thread. It is simply that if you are caught mining anything on grid besides ochre or mercoxit while ochre is on grid, your ship will be destroyed.  
---
Often times people try to argue about when it should be allowed to mine something other than ochre under some specific set of circumstances. However the response has always been that the simplest rule allows no room for interpretation or misunderstanding across the GSF's thousands of members from dozens of countries and no room for mistakes or questioning the judgement of the half dozen or so officers responsible for actually enforcing the rule. You were either mining something other than ochre or mercoxit and you're dead, or you weren't and you're fine. No grey areas, no appeals.
---
junk
---
this is ¬£5 per skin in GBP. it's ¬£40 for the pack.
---
in contrast, i just logged in to ED - they have switched to using a premium currency vs straight up buying skins for cash. 
---
their version of plex is like ¬£3 for 5000 units of currency. 
---
their skins for the ship i have range from 625 units of currency, to 2500 units of currency - which is anywhere from around ¬£0.50 to ¬£1.50.
---
and this is why i've always described skin prices in eve as offensive.
---
Honestly I'd love to see CCP make an entire seasons release based around completely retooling FW.
---
Those green tinted ones you see on a lot of Erebus

Wrong. The number of Skills now are more than 500m points than 425sp i am sure, because i am the creator of [esiknife.com](https://esiknife.com) and i have a function to show to me the points needed by a "ideal" maxed character calculated by non logged users (esi knife reqy}uest anonymized, non logged users).

I'm just not a fan of running demonising campaigns and wars against whole groups for having a small fraction of their members botting. I also think it's a tad hypocritical to do this while harboring bot alliances in your own Coalition.
---
The fact is every coalition has bots but most don't demonize others while saying they themselves are innocent.
---
Really? If Doink hadn't deleted Kugu's DB I'm sure i could laughably show you doing exactly that.  Seems kinda funny, especially considering the whines for nerfs of other peoples game plays have historically come from you and yours.

Until we see evidence you have zero way to prove that.

He's an eve player, ofc he has aspergers

I don't trust anyone coming from Serenity. We all know botting was tolerated and standard operating procedure over there.

To be fair, the names of Drifter ships are completely different from any sleeper ones

and i'm sure people are absolutely clamouring to have a decade plus of progress wiped out and a myriad of quality of life changes reversed so they can try and accumulate shit you just deleted with a ui that you wouldn't put up with for more than 5 mins if it were released today.
---
I think we're talking about two different things here.  First off  I don't harbor any bot alliances and if you have any actual evidence of this please forward it to both me and ccp.
---
Second, there is a huge difference between me probably having bots that I can't find and wanting to get rid of them and their literal alliance executor getting banned for botting and RMT, along with [600 accounts](https://twitter.com/ccp_peligro/status/1125796764148224001?lang=en).  Notice how you won't find anything like that about our rental holdings alliance, any of the real alliances currently renting from us, nor any past rental alliances during my tenure as their landlord.  There are massively different philosophies at play here that you're discounting as hypocritically equivalent.
---
Oldfag here. OP sounds like everyones retired army veteran grandpa who refuses to get a credit card with a chip because "that's how they getcha". Old eve was garbage. So is current eve. Eve is and has always been garbage but it's never really been about the game itself. It's been about the people, and how they all interact, intersect, and collide in a beautiful cacophony in virtual space.
---
Stop being a whiny ass and l2p OP.

Explore the overview settings. There's a lot of understanding to be gained from digging through everything. I also recommend the Z-S overview pack.

Thanks! It works now. I wounder how it got corrupted; I must have done something stupid while the game was installing the first time. Thanks again.
---
How long would it take to farm that back with a max level character?
---
About the same it would take to farm with a well planned 40m sp character.
---
I wouldnt care one bit.  I have hundreds of billions in space assets that mean nothing.  I could well my titan and buy another one the same day.  Wheres the accomplishment in that?
---
Back then alliances were so poor that they didn't srp anything.  Lost a ship?  Better go belt rat to replace it.  Dying meant something
---
Iirc; the map you see in-game is flipped upside down compared to the map you'll get when you render it from the coordinates from that data export. It's one of eve's first bugs.
---
According to the laujcher they just launched ANOTHER amarr skin line too, Crown and Swords.  Its really fucking sad that over the last few months, the only "development" EVE has seen is flipping a few switches for zero-effort blackout changes, and an assload of skins.  You go CCREEEEEE.  Please let me know where Hilmtard goes after he leaves/gets fired so I know who to never buy games from.
---
How do I indicate the corrupted files?
---
Yeah a corpmate lost a duel due to neuts
---
What was wrong with the last patch?
---
I'd gladly have all my assets wiped. It's a freaking video game MMO - how is that different from everyone willing to do the same in WoW?
---
That said, if they roll it back and don't fix some of the core issues - what is the point?
---
I didn't say that. But Blackout wasn't just a weekend. There was plenty of time to get them back out there. There was several suspected bots killed at start because they were just running without local intel.
---
Sure but for every player your "saving" from UI changes and decades worth of loot they've built up their are at least a dozen others that don't enjoy the grind to capital ships online. Those that feel the time **investment into "$4,000" titans that youtube still promotes isn't worth it.** That giving killed by OMGLULZ T9000 Cruiser which requires 1+ year of skill training to get into isn't worth it.
---
If you literally start at 2005 the HIGHEST fucking investment was a **BATTLESHIP**. People were blowing their load over that one dude with a megathron. Ravens were:

Sure, we would be turning back time to a point that's insane, that's my opinion. Because it spells something that we had that made the game for me: FUN. **Tough love I guess, EvE players actually are just risk aversive cucks that haven't unsubbed yet because they would lose everything. lul.**

stay away from the super active FW systems in the warzone (amamake, tama, etc).  Realistically, it's a shit place to learn because people will buy in with ships worth a hundred times yours, and piloting won't matter.  FW Systems near to these in novice plexes will be the places to get 1v1s with people that aren't in 600m worms or huge blobs.

The fact that I can jizz a bunch of ships up the wall and not give a fuck is why I keep playing. If I had to endure the shit pve for 10 hours to replace a cruiser... I could think of many other games that would be way more fun to spend my time on.

I black screen randomly undocking, or gate jumping. Many others with the problem if you google search it.

We are the Trig, resistance is futile scrubs.

Sorry what? Cruisers are cheap, and they were semi-cheap back then too? Not anywhere near 10 hours to replace...
---
Nope since 500 plex is just a month's sub.
---
Let me add that you'll see a bunch of negativity towards mining and it can be miserable and boring. But it can be fun and relaxing - need to find a corp that does everything so you can try everything and while mining you all shoot the shit and get max mining boosts. Ignore most of the negativity you see in this subreddit.

---
Really not all that hard to cook up some different numbers for a fresh virtual machine instance... most of the serious offenders aren't going to be running a client in such a way that the host machine is easily identified. A little VPN routing beyond that so it looks like the virtual clients are all from different spots at quick glance and well... Lets just say that bot removal is an always evolving cold war.
---
&gt; people are just going to click through any popup message they see
---
Yes, they CHOOSE to go into dangerous areas anyway.
---
&gt; where they have been directed to go to continue the tutorial after all.
---
After the tutorial they aren't DIRECTED to any one place.
---
I think clarity about having it indicate when agents are in an active invasion system could be a good QoL, but needing to protect even more systems from invasions doesn't seem worthwhile.
---
Let people fuck up. That's how they learn.
---
But also, in your world, do they now have to make every system along the way from a rookie system to a career agent system invasion free? To keep them from dying on gates?
---
Where does it end?
---
Career agents take them to nearby systems to. Do those need to be protected?

I did mining in an Osprey. So yea I know.

I meant the $500 plex packs. You can buy any amount of pled you just need to contact ccp about it. So you could buy a pack 600k plex instead of buying 40 packs of 15400

The difference is that WoW isn‚Äôt that difficult to grind. You can play for a couple weeks, be max level and do all the things in the game. Eve, on the other hand, is a multiple year journey before you can do just some of the things.

I never talked about network address because it's so easy to use a vpn or to spoof a different ip, even Mac address is useless, too easy to spoof it.

Regarding vm, there are no thousands of hypervisors, and they are easily detectable by hw check I mentioned before.
---
Once you identified VMware, or VirtualBox or kvm you get all of them, it's quite easy to detect them and they can be put in a blacklist.

Lile every software Eve has requirements, I don't think vm architectures are included.

---
&gt; Wormholes are shit.
---
Nah, the opposite.
---
Everything outside of wormholes is shit.
---
We need a wormholes only EVE.
---
Thera will be the market hub that behaves like highsec, no statics as they currently are but a guarantee of 10 holes to random places.
---
CAPS LOCK IS BOTTING
---
$500 not 500 plex.
---
Erm...I thought you don't lose skill points if you just keep injecting. So it always injects 500k SP as long as you don't use them to train skills and keep them.
---
Bullshit you coward
---
Well fuck me then I guess. Was just trying to share fun :P but I guess min maxing is the way to go, better google the perfect rattler fit
---
Was a multiple year journey
---
bots? in drones? gasp!
---
Yes, let's split up an already dwindling player base, split up dev resources between two games...
---
**OR** (and hear me out here) CCP just works on fixing the game...
---
Because its still took fucking time to train those alts and they were finite in nature.  If you can't see the difference Elo needs to drown you in a tub.  
---
You have 100 titan pilots for sale on the bazaar, you sell them all you have zero, with skill injectors you can buy non titan pilots off the market and transform them into titan pilots meaning there are no longer 100 titan pilots, there are basically an infinite number, or rorqs, or supers.
---
:(
---
Not if there is a dockable to you citadel in the same system it dont.
---
Jita 4-4 undock, spam duel.
---
&gt; Very large gas clouds (which whole systems are covered in) 
---
Only if they provide free sunglasses for everyone...
---
Ok, let me spell it out for you since you seem to be an especially dense exemplar. 1 person with 50 alts logged in = 50 players in the pcu but only 1 "legit" player. The drop in pcu consisted of way less actual people than you guys pretend.
---
The solution is to increase distance, reduce jump distance, open more routes between types of space and nerf Citadel spam/mechanics. LS suffers because people bypass it, NS suffers because of the stagnation of it and WHs are like a "hole" different game compared to the rest of Eve. Not that WHs are bad, but they could fit in with the rest of Eve a bit better.
---
Going backward is what happens when someone runs out of ideas and doesn't want to try to fix things. "Let's go back to things were less broken but favorable to certain groups... instead of shit for everyone."
---
I love Eve, but I know it isn't perfect. There's a reason so many of us unsub for years at a time. IF the game made better use of each type of space and wasn't so full of meta-games and career paths that spin the heads of newbros... maybe we'd have more numbers. More of us would stay subbed if we had a better sense of identity, and newbros would stick around if they could find an identity before they are 5 years deep into the game.
---
I'll agree that "too many paths" is kind of the reason, but removing some of them isn't the solution. Just need to define each better, create more conflict between them and related rewards. Battles between sections of space, industry, exploration and somehow creating more balanced content in those areas... that's the solution. Just a very very hard one to come by. Unless you can limit fleet sizes and guarantee people more fair fights, while letting them acclimate and get those fights faster, I just don't see how it can be fixed.
---
I miss the old dual bonus typhoon. Yeah it wouldn't allow you to min/max but it just seemed more fun.
---
yeah how‚Äôd you guess that
---
Spot on
---
I'm going to go with a controversial choice here and say Rubicon.  I think the peak of eve was right before the citadel release, and that an eve without citadels, but with jump changes, and monthly balance tweaks would have been the dream.
---
BUT THE BLACKOUT GOT RID OF ALL THE BOTS...RIGHT? RIGHT?????
---
The gamne has disiminishing returns and if have not, anyway the price is 2x For move 2m points you need spend 1m points of isk value.
---
In few words, first 5m SP no penalty, and pass  At 80m SP aprox you are at 150k per inyector. My clauclus are not lilteral, but tou need at max 3332 inyectors, probably 2800 are enough.
---
Gonna have to add my no to the chorus of no's in the comments.

10/10 art work
---
I see that difference, although i should probably still be tubbed, I just don't think it's that big of a deal. Like I said I'm probably in the minority
---
Let me break it down for you.
---
50 characters not logging in = 50 less targets to shoot at, not matter how many humans are controlling them. 50 less subscriptions means less income driving production. Lower income causes panic, which then causes idiotic schemes to try and raise money.
---
How many real people left is inconsequential. It is all about numbers of people logged in to shoot at, or to mine, or trade. Without them, the economy takes a dump. Without them, other people also leave, as there is nothing to do. Without them, CCP/PA don't see the income they expect and potentially shut us all down. 
---
Every Omega account is income. And from a business standpoint, THAT is what keeps the server turned on.
---
So sure, tell me more about how Blackout wasn't all that bad because it was just alts leaving.
---
The 30k people with Titans do
---
See, something like this should have been here in the beginning. Adding it now won't undo everything injectors have done so far

You're like where I was at a year ago. So in like a year your going to be at where I am. I agree with everything you said but you're wrong about one thing.
---
EvE can not be balanced. EvE is asymmetrical faction warfare. The "Balance" that is needed is that both PvE and PvP need to be nerfed to everything bellow capitals, and T2+ needs to be wiped off the table. They don't add anything gameplay wise T1 didn't fill a decade ago. You can argue, all you want but Battleship brawls were fun as fuck. 
---
It's a completely different game, and level of scale was so different, that's so alien to what we have today.
---
That‚Äôs why they are in hisec
---
I wonder if CCP planned for this many keepstars to be dropped for no other reason then to use as a jump route.
---
Because modern EvE players can't be classic eve players... Humans are incapable of doing two things in 2019.
---
I love how CCP marketed skill injectors as a way for new players to catch up, but then allows people to just inject into titans lmao
---
Nice, they rocking! üíì
---
If you join a group you don't need to do all those logistics yourself.
---
You can also just Safari in a t3
---
CCP will never nerf injectors, they make too much money. The best we can hope for is for them to nerf "endgame content" (ie supercaps) into irrelevance, but they're probably not going to do that either because... well, there goes the majority of injector use.
---

&gt;Introduced bumping changes -&gt; 3min and you warp off. Killed many play styles for potential help with new player retention. To Be Reversed
---
I don't think it killed many playstyles. 
---
This is one recent change I think is a good idea. There's no way you should be able to infinitely stop someone warping without using a point.
---
Your assets were never wiped with WoW.
---
People were buying their way into titans for years before skill injectors. SP sale was not invented with injectors. Before injectors people trained titan pilots just to sell on eve-o for isk. They did it with supercarriers, carriers, dreads, mining barges, everything specialized alt, and unspecialized character you can imagine.
---
This was great for veteran pilots with big piles of isk. It was unreachable for new players.
---
Skill injectors did not change this. They only opened the market to newer players who didn't have the isk to inject all the way to a titan. The advantage to skill injectors goes to lower SP pilots looking for small bumps in training.
---
Gravity rapidly diminishes in influence very quickly as you increase the distance from the actor.  For instance, a blackhole the size of a tennis ball might have a catastrophic effect on it's immediate surroundings (inches)  farther away however (feet) and you might just feel a slight breeze as your atmosphere begins to fall in.   
---
This is why escape velocity is a thing.  Most folks who think of objects going in a straight line forever are confusing space with a perfect vaccum.  Space isn't empty.
---
This is why I think spreading out the areas and increasing the distance/risk in LS and NS is worthwhile. The main reason people don't BS Brawl and do smaller-scale PVP... is they just think they'll get hot-dropped and/or blobbed. Capitals... it was always my dream to fly a carrier. However, they are boring PVE ships and used in PVP blobs most of the time. I always envisioned fighting a battle with 1-2 capitals on each side, fleet support and a balanced fun form of PVP. When you play an RTS or FPS, there is a balancing factor. From there, it becomes about skill. So, in each of those you have limited resources and balanced numbers. On a Battlefield (FPS) map, you have tanks and vehicles, machine guns, airplanes... etc. However, so does your opponent. With the same number of people per side. An RTS limits resources and rewards the person that builds the better offense/defense while managing those finite resources.
---
To do this in Eve, you'd need a "Myth: The Fallen Lords" style point system to compose fleets. Then you'd need instanced battle areas for major conflicts to create an exciting and fair battlefield.
---
Not really possible in Eve, unless you increase distances to avoid huge support numbers arriving too fast, or limit mass in each system. This is why WH PVP is sought out by people, because they know that the field will be limited in a way, because of WH Mass restrictions. The problem there has become the amount of ISK and the fact that every bit of that mass is blinged out depending on who you are facing. The force-multiplier has just looked inward in those cases.
---
Anyway, a bit of a ramble there, but that kinda defines the issue. There is no solution really. Other than creating scenarios and locations where you can find a certain type of content, you can't dictate what players will do in this sandbox. Limiting the player isn't fun, but may be necessary in order to create engaging gameplay. The people this hurts, are the ones that use those things and abuse them in the current meta. So, you make a change like "Blackout" and those people scream, take their ball and go home and then you lose numbers. The remaining people don't fill the void that's left and you realize the game is full of "safe pve" players more than anything else.
---
FW is a nice idea, and combat that can be jumped into quickly is what will revitalize the game. Grabbing that audience is difficult, especially when they can load up an FPS/MOBA/BR game and get action in seconds. They don't even have to be good to enjoy the game (which is lame, imo), but Eve doesn't really allow for that.
---
FW is close to the answer though, imo. If you could create conflict zones and borders. Ratchet up the benefit of controlling territory based on faction/corporation, then you might see more action to secure that benefit.
---
ISK bloat is the issue. If you remove Caps, then we'll go back to the old Battleship blob metas and they'll all just be blinged as hell and people may even use BLOPs as carriers, along with Marauders, etc... anything that conveys an advantage for the same cost.
---
Yeah right? lol
---
Yeah, it would be really awesome
---
Yup, tho the game looks great already
---
Moving supers across the universe is very expensive and dangerous; you're probably not going to get any bites unless you tell people at least what region it's in.  Good luck though
---
This won't end well for you.
---
Cap bonuses are not `logi bonuses`.
---
Yes it says so, but it does not unless you train skills. You can have 80m skill points to spend but unless you spend them actually on skills, you will keep injecting them at 500k. That is what i heard from this sub anyway, months ago.

How in the world do you play Eve without Wine on a Mac? 
---
Ever since the recent change, I could not start up Eve in 64 bit. It was giving me an error that user data could not be found, I believe. I downloaded and started up the 32-bit version, it worked fine. 
---
It always runs using Wine by default though, there isn't native compatibility with Mac OS as far as I'm aware. No?
---
Is every ‚Äúsystem‚Äù on the map and in WH space actually just another solar system? I always thought it‚Äôd be cool to be deep into space far from any solar system
---
That 2 billion today isn't as valuable as it was 10 years ago. Yes you can purchase more stuff with it...because there's more stuff to begin with. Things are not as rare. Flying full pirate battleship fleets is not some crazy pipe dream. So yes you can buy more with your ISK but even in your argument that shows that's only because of the strength of plex (or weakness of ISK/in game materials.)
---
Fine. I'll give up the location. Hel is located in catch.
---
lol, time is getting desperate in CCP ... prices are getting higher on shit items but show must go on.

I'm wondering how many people is that dumb to buy this shit

I dont have time to grind mobs for another fucking 15 feathers that you need because of reasons

Great adventure my ass
---
Well I sure hope you're wrong!
---
Is it docked or in space?
---
But it still took time to train those characters, it didnt just take ISK to instantly have a Titan toon, someone had to spend years training it.
---
Why should a titan toon not be unreachable for a new player?
---
Shit, foiled again

FYI, you can edit your original post.

Picturing this in my head I'm having a smile that's hard to conceal lol
---
This is now my favorite drawing of dino and panda.
---
seasons and instant arena-like pvp would be honestly pretty damn good for FW lowsec in current year; it would attract new blood in this new generation of gamers and give motivation to rebalance ships and modules more often
---
however, given CCP's track record, it would be half-assed and essentially turn into abyssal pvp or something dumb like that.
---
While I don't know for sure that that's incorrect, pretty sure when you use them they go to unallocated, which still counts towards your "total sp", which is what I'd assume the check goes by. I don't use heroine, so couldn't say for sure.
---
&gt; After the tutorial they aren't DIRECTED to any one place. 
---
You mean, aside form what ISD would recommend if they asked in the rookie help channel, or what the EVE-Uni wiki would tell them if they found that as a resource, or what the agency would recommend as a nearby next step. 
---
&gt; Let people fuck up. That's how they learn. 
---
Sure, but what are they learning? That triangles are dangerous? That jumping a gate can lead you to getting killed by NPCs? That going where you are expected to go as part of the normal new player progression is risky? Normally invasions are something you need to seek out, or something you would upon as you explore the game. Them spawning in career agent missions is like a tutorial in a game that randomly spawned late game enemies that for the player to encounter with no meaningful explanation given. In this instance they are not making a mistake because they are already doing what they probably should be doing, but getting punished for it anyways.
---
&gt; But also, in your world, do they now have to make every system along the way from a rookie system to a career agent system invasion free? To keep them from dying on gates? 
---
Now you are just arguing a slippery slope fallacy. That is a complete misrepresentation of my position. What I am arguing is that specifically CCP designated rookie systems, systems that contain needed tutorials, should be safe from unpredictable and highly dangerous NPCs such as are spawned by incursions, invasions, and FOBs.
---
Unallocated skill points still affect diminishing returns.
---
Your were not told wrong and not right :) Unallocated sp counts towards total sp, the only way round it is if you have sp pools left in redeem but that is minimal and fairly hard to come by in large amounts
---
Its docked.
---
So you meen no one then... Every time other than 1 time some one contested the PL super fleet we lost...
---
There should be a .0001% that a Stargate sends you to some random location.

What a rip off, CCP literally gouging the few customers they have left.

Yeah the last time I proper fought SF it was like 100 ravens with a couple dreads ... they couldn't kill my fax. It was AIDS - then BBC dropped some stuff and got a little hazed (but I think they won the points war ... hehe)
---
&gt;immediately getting jumped by a couple of insta-lock destroyers on the Gate

The irony there is those are probably Spectre Fleets xD

This **was** Eve
---
You don't have to be a good pilot, you just have to be better than the other guys.
---
Are they bonuses to remote reps? Yes?
---
do you allow people to bring ewar/logi or do you rather keep support roles for more seasoned pilots (e.g. a tusker)
---
sounds interesting, i'll keep it in mind if i get back into an omega clone

" Nor does losing a rookie ship matter."

It does when you just started playing and can't figure out why the NPC in the new guy system are killing you in highsec while you just try to learn the controls and run the learner missions.
---
You would.

Join this corp because it's the best one for helping new players get started: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) 
---
Sparing that, most non-scam player corporations are much better experiences than default NPC ones that you will automatically be part of simply by not being in a player one. The best other option would be to join a good Faction Warfare corp to get an experience of the PVP side of things (E-Uni does a decent amount of PVP, just not enough).
---
Don't be reluctant to go into Low-Sec and Null. High gets boring fast.
---
Don't listen to most of the negativity in r/Eve.
---
Solo mining is an incredibly boring activity, but if you sit down with a bunch of your friends in the corp and talk about whatever bullshit you feel like talking about while crunching rocks together, it's a lot of fun.
---
Solo PVP will get you killed more often than not (still quite fun), but  your odds of killing something go up drastically just by finding one person to fly around with. Be careful about going with too many, though. After a certain point, people will see Local spike and everyone who doesn't have a fleet (they'll specifically go for whatever hard-counters your dudes) will hide so you will not be able to fight much.
---
Slippery slope isn't always a fallacy.
---
You said "being killed on a gate".
---
Well, gates aren't only in the destination system.
---
So do all the systems in between career agents and the start system need to be safe? Or not?
---
The argument you used to justify removing it from that system applies to all those other systems.
---
&gt; You mean, aside form what ISD would recommend if they asked in the rookie help channel, or what the EVE-Uni wiki would tell them if they found that as a resource, or what the agency would recommend as a nearby next step.
---
‚Äã

None of those say "this is the system you must go to."

2 things:
---
-Im not accusing or not accusing anyone based on one source of banned botters. Its better than nothing, but not by much.
---
-Yeah GSF have a fucking million people who do exactly what bots do all day. And they probably still bot anyway.
---
That's not the new guy system we are talking about though.
---
We are talking about other systems, which require the player to OPT into entering.
---
&gt;Here is a pic I took at Eve Berlin of a max SP characte
---
Thanks. I try to seek some pilots of Caldari Totan to round my numbers.
---
Such is life.
---
Ewar is a good role for new players, especially someone with low sp. As long as they can use meta damps and sit in a maulus. If there are logi on these roams it will be a solo scythe. That is alot harder of a ship to fly and although it wont be required to be a skilled pilot since logi isnt critical to the gang comp, it is recommended for more experienced pilots.

Injectors allow imbalanced things to form vicious circles to feed the imbalance.
---
Capital ships are good -&gt; Capital ships allow you to grind for injectors -&gt; Injectors allow you to fly capitals with more alts -&gt; You can grind injectors even more.
---
Without injectors it would take long time before unbalanced capital ships become problem. With injectors the problem grows at accelerating pace.
---
You can see rub made it in, you're worthy enough!
---
¬£40?! A bit expensive to be honest.
---
Nobody you ever fought wasn‚Äôt also able to kill all your supers on their own? Reality calls.
---
I think you kinda miss the point and reason. 1 WOW only launched classic after killing multiple severs that ran older versions ( note losing more players ) 2 WOW is still losing people at a fairly steady rate. 3 WOW classic will lose its appeal in short order as does every expansion they have made had a peak at first then a drop of 50 % with in months. 4 splitting the player base drives numbers down. I could go on for hours about how you lack the understanding to make a case for your ideas, as they seem poorly thought out.
---
I have no idea what Spectre is lol. Never really been one for in-game politics and such if it didn‚Äôt concern my Corp(rip my old Corp tho. When I was taking a 6 month break, it imploded from the inside out- long story lol)

You too must've noticed their price dropping. Do i need say more, or are you familiar with the little economy 101. Speaking of economy, i wouldn't mind less targets if that means less alts injecting way too much into the ingame one. Or do you think 35b Titans or 600m carriers are a good thing?

This is what some people have been talking about recently (and not so recently).  Fights are too binary due to logistics (and other things), which promotes the 'helldunk or blueballs' with a dash of 'bushido', like your example of two almost equal fleets, a so called 'honor fight'.
---
Aww, *sniff...* He hates us poor wormholers who'd quite happily pod him back to where he cane from
---
 I think we have some points to clarify.
---
1. Recruiter: A member who is allowed to recruit other pilots. They talk with capsuleers and help them find the team. They sell the idea which is the main challenge for recruitment.
---
2. Recruitment Reward Program: It's an investment from a team to fund, value and motivate the recruiter career and results.

If you are flying double or triple rep battleships you know 800's dont cut it.

Again, NCPL didn't set themselves up as anti-bot crusaders like TAPI have.  I'm not blaming TAPI for having bots in their renter groups (although KWG is pretty egregious), I'm blaming them for going all holier-than-thou about bots when they're *at least* as guilty of profiting from them as anyone.

Sure but, I'm advocating pre-Capital ships online. Marauders, Titans, Dreads and Carriers didn't exist, and the only way to get to your enemy was to burn to them, and start shooting each other. Things were a hella simpler back then. Hot drops never factored into your battle calculus. Whats on the field at that moment is exactly what's on the field. Reinforcements heavily aided to the defenders because burning to attack meant you had to jump several gates to get back to the battle. There is more skill involved because the battleship comps actually mattered and were more accessible. Fights happened at the more local level, because a lack of jump anything meant your group had to live more statically, and redeployment mean, back then, the massive move of an entire alliance, forcing your faction to live more cohesively, and closer to the enemy resulting into a quasi ongoing battle daily.
---
Hot drop meta adds a level of uncertainty to every engagement that frankly makes meta level faction fights not happen, as the battle calculus is already determined. Blinged battleships is not something to be feared, but enjoyed.
---
Trying to fix EvE around jump mechanics is a lost cause, in this you can't change my mind.
---
[assuming no effect on PLEX and injector markets]
---
Yeah but how much does it cost at $3/bil because that what it actually cost him in lost sales lmao
---
Spectre fleet is a public NPSI community. Not Purple Shoot It.

We host fleets of various styles and lengths across new eden.

No politics though some fleets/campaigns run by specific FC's may contain politics; they're by no means necessary.

"Nobody" other than the people that did. I get it Big bad PL... We did have alot of supers compared to alot of people but we never had the most. but from B-R and over the last 2-3 years we have been massavly overtaken to a point were the numbers we could/can field are not even relivent. there is a scale issue now, back when we did have alot we are talking about 20-40 titans max, for most normal ops between 2010 and 2015, 20-40 titans are semi ingageable kind of... now in 2019 there are single allainces not includeing goons that could fill a full fleet with titans and supers on a normal op....  our numbers back in PL's prime were oppressive yes, But the numbers people are fileding now are totaly outrageus. Like frat haveing more titans for there keepstar than were in B-R on both sides.

Hi, PLEX is primarily used by Omega accounts for account subscriptions. The price is dropping on the PLEX because people aren't using them for their subscriptions, which, speaking of Economics 101, is called decreased demand. The price of PLEX has no bearing on cosy of Titans or Carriers. I am fine with 600m carriers, they are a throwaway ship 15 years in. I would like to see Titan prices go up, certainly, but when that happens ALL other ship prices are also going up, causing PvP to have a higher barrier to entry. 
---
Skill injectors are the biggest problem in EVE, not alt accounts.

I‚Äôm really interested in this. Tell me Rub do you have nav skills to 4? üòè
---
We need more sps from injectors for us bitter vets. 150k is trash for 850mil.
---
Time is a flat circle.
---
  We were the bad guys after UALX last year.
---
  We were the bad guys when we kicked PL out of Provi space
---
  We were the bad guys for fighting CO2
---
  We were the bad guys when we took the south from Goons/Stainwagon
---
  And we continue to be the bad guys because urgay pwned
---
  Next it'll be GOTG or Goons
---
This is why I have so many alts, my main only needs like 60m sp and my alts pay for themselves in afk myrms.
---
Classic WoW is good fun
---
Hi, bots want empty systems, competition lowers their ISK/hr, also makes it easier for them to be noticed and reported. This makes Delve a terrible place to bot.
---
With that being said, there have been bots, but when found, they get kicked and reported to CCP, which is all that can be done from a player perspective.
---
You're not wrong, Rubicon would be a good pick! After all there was a THREE YEAR GAP between rubicon and citadel. There was a more interesting carrier meta, and sov mechanics.
---
Did TAPI just finish up winning a war again? Looks like 'GRRR TAPI' is back on the menu bois
---
What if I‚Äôm part of a massive blue donut but want to join in?
---
Make a hauler alt that isn't in FW, so that the risk for gankers is much higher. Use it to move things around safely.
---
My mind is blown not by the Sabre or its 32 killmarks but by the caption on the image

Please tell me you don't go to UoI?

Agreed

These SKINs on the market rn:  [https://evepraisal.com/a/nqdal](https://evepraisal.com/a/nqdal)   Didn't even make it in a paste-able format for evepraisal/multibuy. Couldn't even paste all the names into the market because of spelling mistakes (Metamaterial&gt;Metamateria).   AND I'm pretty sure that Gila SKIN isn't even the one pictured...
---
Who knows what CCP are doing, I dont even think they do.
---
&gt; 1 WOW only launched classic after killing multiple severs that ran older versions ( note losing more players )
---
Cool, lucky CCP has never had a private server problem otherwise they might be out of a JOB. HA!!!
---
&gt; 2 WOW is still losing people at a fairly steady rate. 
---
All games lose players at a steady rate. That doesn't mean that they are failures or that the games cannot generate a profit. Only that iterations of the game must be released to revive interest and entertain the players.
---
&gt; 3 WOW classic will lose its appeal in short order as does every expansion they have made had a peak at first then a drop of 50 % with in months. 
---
Yeah but 50% drop of several million subscribers is still 1000% more than EvE. Hurts your black heart don it?
---
&gt; 4 splitting the player base drives numbers down.

My money in on Goons. I'm not sure who they'll be cyber bullying yet, excited for the next narrative!

I'm proud of you.  Did your mommy clip those out and put them on the fridge? I too am proud of the time my video game friends were mean to me and I was sad.  You're a clown.
---
No bhaalgorn. Worthless sale
---
at times its handy as you can park chars in different stations.  at times its a royal pain when you need to consolidate, move, or find a particular BPO
---
Yeah you have to use something like seat to keep track of who has what assets where.

its 2019. supers arent special and you dont need to make a reddit post about it.
---
I want to know the status of the DirectX 12 implementation and if/when we will get to test it?
---
true story i made an alt corp and stuck it in KWG in 2015, had 10 nyxes going just for RMT cash. paid my mortgage for 4 years.
---
I'm happy for Goons to invade us finally, let the nightmare of sovnull end
---
The only EVE stuff on sale are the packs, not Plex alpha injectors or game time.
---
So it really only helps if you want to start new characters if you didn't have all the packs already on your account
---
Everyone is free to join as long as they're willing to learn/improve and are chill enough for the comms.  
---
So there would be no problem in our end, but if we're heading towards your home system you might want to step down if you don't want trouble with your friends, it's down to you,  just a NPSI with an intent to make the small gang style more accesible for less experienced pilots, no compromises
---
you simply talk to one of our brokers in game and give them the details of the system you want found and our slack bots ping out the order and when its located our broker contacts you and we get you moved in and we leave and you get 48hrs of no torp delivery
---
Well.... Cant really help you there
---
well... tue^^
---
What‚Äôs funny is they didn‚Äôt even ‚Äúrewrite‚Äù it. They took a rock solid chat protocol that had been around commercially and freesource for 15 years called jabber (XMPP) and somehow managed to break it. Lol
---
funny, my first real logi experience was solo scythe -the other had died while we crashed gate rip- had 0 idea what i was doing but ended up producing a visible amount of positive hitpoints
---
appreciate the info, thanks
---
yeah except for the stupid skills like acceleration control
---
tbh i did that with a FW toon and it was pretty fun. I killed a rather expensive Slicer (Faction point) with a cheap rifter and that bought me SO MANY RIFTERS!
---
Make an alpha, buy the pack, send all the stuff to another account.
---
Shit I thought I was looking at one of my alts on another monitor for a second.
---
Because it's Chaos era my dude
---
Ahhh didn't know that.
---
Please yes let's go to lowsec and call it a day.
---
I presume this some low-effort joke, considering that it can ru on high settings on a five year old Mac?
---
I get where you are coming from, but part of the appeal to some is the natural escalation of things. Capital ships and the other ships make sense, but they are implemented incorrectly. A Carrier should be support and Fighters, maybe even players launched from the ship instead of drones/fighters. Dreads should be used to shoot big things and weak to small things. They should, however, be able to field drones. Having a drone bay on a frigate that can hold 5-10 drones is crazy when you see that a Dread can field ZERO. There should be counters to that, of course, but they should be the way a big ship deals with a swarm of smaller ships.
---
Since it is essentially a naval simulator, it should behave like one. You have 3 carriers/capitals on a grid somewhere, cool, but no one should be able to show up from 7 light-years away instantly with a mega force to wipe you out. The escalation should take time as should getting those 3 capitals to where they were in the first place. Reward tactics and planning, devalue the "umbrella" coverage. Distance increases and nerfs to jump range assist in this. Longer spool-ups, Cyno changes and more Micro-Jumping would be conducive to tactical and smaller-scale warfare.
---
I agree with CCP that Titans were a mistake, and Capitals how they exist currently. They should exist, perhaps, but be limited more.
---
Skirmishes/battles should be dominated by sub-caps of various sizes and all designed to support each other. A group should be rewarded (whether tactically or with a buff of some sort) for having a proper fleet comp a la naval warfare. A carrier by itself should be somewhat vulnerable, but exact a toll upon the force that assaults it. A carrier supported by smaller craft, should be as deadly as they were in old naval warfare. CovOps should be like Submarines, frigates like PT Boats, Destroyers like... uh yeah, and so on and so on.
---
People will always game the system, unless the system is more restrictive. Does that kinda go against Eve's sandbox mentality? Sure. But that's why we are having this discussion. There need to be some fences, some rules and only in an effort to make gameplay more engaging. You can still build whatever you want, take over systems, shape the universe... its just more inclusive now. A smaller and more battle-savvy corp could go toe-to-toe with a larger corp because of the engagement limitations that make for an interesting, lag-free and anti-blob campaign.
---
Anyway, pipe dreams for the both of us.
---
Games have shifted to instant gratification, and we are unlikely to see what we want come about unless it is in a smaller package. Multiplayer, sure, but not MMO-level, imo. More along the lines of multiplayer 4X-lite.
---
Props for taking initiative mate. Just be emotionally prepared for the shitty situations where you get blobbed/ecm'd to hell or what have you, and you're golden. The fun is out there waiting for you.
---
lmao u lost

I will give CCP $3.50, final offer.

That moment you do you first pvp fleet.  No matter how big or small.. the blood is pumping..  the excitement burns in your chest !   Absolutely exhilerating!

Good luck.
---
Just join a newbro friendly, PvP corp, in lowsec or nullsec. Not just some random highsec retards, that will promise you riches, if you waste your time mining in a venture for them.
---
Lol well you two cutie pies have fun with your back alley pseudo intellectualisms, I don‚Äôt really have the time or patience to unpack how unhealthy a reaction that is
---
Is there something wrong with UofI?
---
Mining can be fun and relaxing, when you have the proper skills on your alts to make decent isk and have learned the basics.
---
Starting as a miner right away is stupid and you miss a lot of interesting things if you do what 80% of the newbros do.
---
you swapped alliances again ? Where is your ingame loyalty at ? ( not a troll question btw)

Hahahahahaha

i too like cynabal because  more cynabals can fit into bowhead than machariels
---
While I would absolutely recommend joining the Eve University chat (I found it to be way more useful then the official help chats when I was a newbro) joining E-UNI themselves isn't for everyone. They have some pretty strict rules that they enforce in order to maintain their neutrality and is a reason I never joined them. 
---
That being said joining a newbro friendly corp is definitely something OP should do and I would recommend they do a little research to find one that will work for them. Myself personally I ended up with Brave and have been quite happy there.
---
Trigger Happy - UFC knew I was only going to be there for a little bit, as I mostly wanted to help them in EUTZ to bolster up their war in Pure Blind, which ended exactly 2 days after I joined lol. They're a mostly USTZ &amp; Blops focused alliance other than that, which whilst fun isn't my jam as an EUTZ duder who likes 30v30 to 100v100 fleet combat primarily.
---
To be real with you I've not been a part of leadership/FC team in anywhere since Provi (barring my TERRIBLE MISTAKES with trying to run an alliance), and I've been just going through places trying to find a place that felt like a home I wanted to defend since. Maybe Trigger will be that, maybe it won't, just gotta see.
---
literally says nothing
---
The more neut pressure you're under the more 800s shine. 3200s for any other situation.
---
Have you ever done the math on RMT?  It's kind of depressing actually.  I'm not going to sit here and say I wouldn't sell space pixels for a real estate empire if I could but let's run through it anyway for shits and giggles.  You can buy a trillion isk from CCP for like ~15k usd.  If you can do it legit for that I'm guessing the isk black market has to be what, half that? Let's say $7,500usd  A nyx makes like, 200m/hr ish?  Gotta not get banned, so lik 8hrs/day max?  That's ~50 days of running all 10 8hrs per day, minus Plex for the accounts, minus electricity for the server running all ten to make that trillion isk.  That's assuming you don't get banned at all for running that hard and have to make new accounts, or lose any of it laundering. This is also assuming we're running an isk selling site directly, and not cutting anyone else in, which is more overhead in terms of serverspace. Also remember, there's only like 100T in the entire eve economy so moving that kind of volume has to be dangerous as fuck.  But you seem like a smart guy, so let's say we even figure out how to beat CCP, and RMT 10% of Eve's entire economy per year without losing a single isk, or getting a single account banned, and also we're running this isk selling website for free somehow.  Best case scenario between two people we're talking napkin math ~$1000USD/mo for each of us.  12k/yr.
---
In some countries where the USD has more buying power I could see that being legitimately tempting, but in the USA with a college education, I can do a hell of a lot better than 12k/yr and leave eve to a healthy hobby.
---
It was a doozy... point is I guess I hope we can tango soon. Youll need to bring more than you did for those guys if you want to kill even me by myself though ;)
---
I don't know them, but wanted to say that Snappy Crocodiles is a wonderful name for a corp!
---
Manic Velocity died trying to get it for us from Area 51. If you watch last weeks Open Comms show you will understand.
---
One can hope.
---
It is when you're in test üòÅ glad I joined.
---
Cruchyroll. Netflix runs out of content way too fast.
---
That somebody across the fucking internet, who has no fucking clue who the fuck I am, could have any idea who I fucking am.
---
Heres how I usually play it. Astero for exploring and making money, Stratios for ruining the lives of Explorers, Nestor for when I wanna fuck shit up, and fuck a lot of it up.
---
Yes
---
Exception to that last rule is if you're carrying a lot of charges for prolonged fighting in something like a battleship. The navy charge reduced size is important for fitting more in that battleship cargo bay.
---
Great success!
---
eve keeps reenabling 64 bit
---
i multibox like 10 clients and dont want to be on 64 bit, so i disable it. everytime i relaunch the launcher, it reenables. why?
---
Jesus. Imagine flying any drone boat brawler in PVP. Can you imagine the cancer of actually having to micro your ship and drones like fighters?
---
Honestly i would prefer it. I could play it at work...
---
Click on the button in the upper left of your launcher, I believe it‚Äôs called cache settings. It should automatically scan
---
While it is technically possible, I can‚Äôt think of a reason to use a t3 instead of a praxis. While the t3 can escape easier, if they use a suicide tackle bomber or if you let your guard down at all, you‚Äôll still lose the t3, and that‚Äôs a lot more expensive than losing a praxis
---
&gt; Mobile Refinery Operation
---
&gt; Astronautic Engineering
---
But what is Max SP without including skills that aren't even seeded in the game anymore?
---
I mean, I know technically its SP, and technically some chars still have it, but its not realistically attainable by anyone who started a character after 2004 (or whenever the supply of books ran out)
---
Try autoit
---
Correct, demand has decreased. But not proportional to the supply, hence the dropping prices. Meaning, not every lost omega was lost income for CCP. I'm not saying there was no loss, but it's getting overexeggarated.  
---
And yes, price of plex doesn't have anything to do with ship prices, on that point i was referring to your argument about less targets in space. Also you are right, skill injectors are a big problem, allthough you should not forget they're used with a goal. One of the bigger problems is what was done to Rorquals. If we still had the old rorquals, almost noone would inject into them and there wouldn't be more ore around than realistically could be used in the time the game still exists for.  
---
Supers and Titans pose an issue aswell but theres more things that enable this problem. Keepstars for example.  
---
Regarding entry level, there is much more that would need to be done. Hard to say where to even start tbh. Something like an income method that earns good and can be done as a newbro while not scaling with alts. Something like exploration but either less outlandish, or CCP needs to do some fixing on that like the unfinished sites issue and also guide newbros better, but the NPE is a whole different,  massive issue.
---
The answer to all those questions is yes. Often, it's botting. Sometimes it's a dozen of PI alts, or market alts, or mining alts, or SP farming alts. 
---
And sometimes it's cold, hard, irl cash money funneled into the game through that shiny, shiny PLEX
---
Bold of you to assume there will be targets to shoot at ;)
---
Damn you guys are bored or something
---
[Skill injector concept art](https://i.imgur.com/y2RJx7I.jpg)
---
I‚Äôll see you guys on Friday.
---
mkay buddy, so we have like 1-2 dudes that are FRIENDS of our guys from separate alliances, yes technically you can say we brought lots of alliances, but not LOTS of dudes from LOTS of alliances
---
i mean I wouldn't be mad if PL came at all, it's just they had to bring in like 60 dudes to help bring your numbers way over us, if they had only brought like 30 dudes or even 40 it would've been more even
---
but it's okay, we'll keep farming you in the meantime
---
What roadmap?
---
EVE's development seems to go like this:
---
\&gt;Try to change spaghetti code written over a decade ago that no one understands
---
\&gt;Completely fail, but introduce strange bugs
---
\&gt;Tell the players that said bugs are intended, while desperately trying to figure out wtf just happened
---
\&gt;Wait and see if people quit the game because of it
---
\&gt;If they do, finally assign a person to try and fix it
---
\&gt;If they don't, tell them that they finally "iterated" on &lt;insert some bullshit here&gt; and that they're always listening to the playerbase, see?
---
FeelsFuckingGoodMan
---
Big fan. Especially since its one of the few ways I have found to see all the contents of the ships and secure containers in asset safety.
---
Are there practical guides to becoming excellent at Caldari ships ECM? I've read the Eve-U guide, but want to get some practical experience as well as learning the minutiae of 'git gud'. I guess I just gotta fly a bunch of Griffins / BlackBirds / Rooks and get them blown up until they don't blow up as fast? And same question, just with Stealth Bombers? 
---
I've applied to a couple of high rep newbro corps so I'm guessing they'll run proper classes
---
You can still occasinally see books for some of those on the market. Black Market Trading is the only one I know of that never had a skill book associated with it.
---
Ah the one thing as a trader I refuse to trade.
---
Mostly by actually playing the game with alts. Isk is easy to make if you dedicate time to the game. Or with bots/rmt/Plex.
---
in raw ticks maybe, but you would be running max planets + max upgrade PI, max reaction queues, max build queues, max invention queues, max trade orders at max distance, with lowest sales tax and broker fees.
---
Plus you would get max refining output as well (assuming at that point you also spring for max implant) 
---
oh right, plus you would have 10 jump clones for either movement or holding alternative implant loadouts. 
---
If that guy can't make isk.....
---
There's only one (video)[https://youtu.be/V1mtJSkHW6o] which ha the right for that name
---
Till the server shus down....
---
From a quick bit of Google, it seems that safe math works out to about 100 mil per hour for a single Rorqual out mining or a single Carrier out ratting. So in a single day of AFK, that one ship would bring in 2.3 Bil which is almost enough to buy 2 months of PLEX.
---
Use that to set up 2 more accts to sit in their own Rorqs or Carriers, and the next day you've brought in 6.9 Bil... Those 3 pilots could make 150 Bil is 3 weeks.
---
If you really had 8 alts going, you'd be making 18.4 Bil per day, and you'd have 150 Bil for "stuff" every 8 days.
---
And that... is why they try to do stuff like Blackout to reduce the torrent of ISK pouring into the market. And why all the Rorq and Carrier pilots were crying big fat tears about having their income hampered.
---
Ouchhhhh
---
Ok Dr. WhyYouMadYo. Your diagnosis would be really helpful in this situation but it clear that you‚Äôre busy with other patients. In the mean time I‚Äôll be in my back alley pretending to be smart.
---
yup, I don't mind being one of those 976 brainless F1 monkeys, The people that are better at the game then I am lead me to get sweet kills like these.

My friends taught me a tried and true method to make money --
---
Step 1:  join a laid back corp
---
Step 2:  make friends with your corp mates 
---
Step 3:  learn how to rat or mine from them
---
Step 4:  help your alliance evac by accepting all their no collateral courier contracts
---
Step 5:  fail all of those contracts
---
Step 6:  laugh at them on discord
---
Step 7:  profit
---
Rorqual mining is an isk neural activity though, in that there is no isk added into the game, it only trades hands.  Ratting is what adds isk into the game. 
---
Rorqual mining does inject a metric fuck ton of minerals into the game though.
---
Simplified to....no where.
---
For fifty bucks, you would think they'd have put in some SKINs that were actually desirable.
---
The "Age of Chaos" *was* the roadmap
---
Buy high, sell low. I think.
---
Or, you can do what I did. The first thing you do is wait for CCP to change Faction Warfare and find an exploit where you can endlessly generate LP from thin air and dump it all to the learning implant market. The second thing you do is wait for TEST to abandon Delve after a loss in 6VDT and ninjasiege and tower all the moons for yourself, exploiting a diplomatic blind spot between major powers, as well as an overtaxed logistics team for your own personal benefit.
---
Market shit, high end PvP like the alliance tournament; basically make at least 150bil per person if you get top 3, afk mining, mining R64 moon goo, afk ratting/titan ratting.
---
Keep and get turrets, you might want to boost specific missile skills later but wait for a specific need or fit to fly.
---
At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do.
---
you can still download the game... can play on windows 8, havent tried any higher
---
Other patients? Yea, no, I had this dingle berry hanging off the hairs around my asshole all day today, so I‚Äôm really busy scratching the swollen aftermath of that whole situation.
---
The same is true today. It doesn't just take isk to instantly have a titan character, years of training went into it.
---
&gt; Why should a titan toon not be unreachable for a new player?
---
Because new players can get the isk for a skill injector, they are not generally sitting on the many billions of isk necessary to go all the way in on a new character.
---
What do you envisage a pulsar looking like, exactly?
---
I think you'll be disappointed by reality.
---
Gosh what are you even talking about? Like i dont understand what you are arguing with me about?
---
You just sound stupid.
