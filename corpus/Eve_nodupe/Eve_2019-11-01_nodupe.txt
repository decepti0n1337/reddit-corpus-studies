&gt; murdering his account
---
It's EVE 2019, getting into groups that have at least half a pulse doesn't matter to people anymore
---
Yeah that kinda sucks. It's hard to save people from themselves. Too many in the game feel the only measure of success is how much isk they have and unfortunately the most lucrative ways to play are embedded in the blocs.
---
did you struggle reading the post, mr dinobrain?
---
Who would win:
---
6000 player battle that involved supercapitals and lasted 21 hours
---
Or
---
1 hauly boi
---
Well then I would assume typical shitty job from ccp security. Hope you get it back.
---
Love them trying to fight bots but the amount of false positives is kinda silly these days nvm there ambiguity with stuff like macros n shit.
---
If you haven't petitioned ccp yet do it. I'd also Burge your system of any secondary programs like ghost mouse n shit that could be construed as a macro tool. I'm expecting them to ban gaming mice soon with how abiguties this shit is.
---
lame af
---
What utter horseshit. Classy move, FYI, trying to spin this into "Provi are mean IRL". Very classy.
---
Check the timeline. He was still in CVA while all this was happening, only gone after he killed off a lot of his valuable ships, with the help of many Provibloc members.
---
There was nothing preventing him joining the Provi Mumble (Provi doesn't use TS...) for the duration. We were actually talking to him on Slack. People were quite worried about him on there. - I know he was on RC TS for a while there, but that wasn't because we didn't want to talk to him or had kicked him off our comms. That idea is just you being an asshole.

Guess Goons can now be permanently KB green
---
I used to carrier rat for at least 2 hours per day a while back, which I did for quite some time also. Most of the time I didn't take any breaks during that 2 hours session, sometimes I took a short break after 1 hour.
---
Been doing more or less what you've been doing. At the start I find the havens by cancelling warp, which is a well known technique to filter them out easily. Then warp to a site, command fighters to orbit an object, then orbit their targets. Kill everything, move on like you did. Only change is that I'm not calling my anom anywhere and I don't have keybinds to change targets.
---
Nothing have ever happened to me while I've been doing this. So if you're telling the truth something's off.
---
Access to pretty much everything, but depth on any of it will take both getting character and player skills built up.
---
Well done, Hive Mind. I'll personally be headed there as an individual to pay my respects to the bloodiest virtual battle ever. A battle that started because the rent was late.
---
What’s the point of this exactly?
---
How to manipulate markets in one hauler is more like it.
---
There's definitely not 22 trillion ISK in value in that hauler.
---
That CCP abandoned and is completely useless and valueless. Sadly.
---
There is not actually 22 trillion ISK in the hauler, however.
---
 A goon decided to market manipulate a few worthless, forgotten items into 22 trillion ISK of "value" for lols.
---
I think this just proves how empty eve is now
---
No one knew what these items were until now, because CCP completely and utterly dropped the ball on some pretty awesome drifter wormhole content.
---
Their value is far from the 22 trillion stated, but in drawing attention to a little known aspect of drifter wormholes, it may be priceless.
---
Priceless or worthless?
---
Also it isn't asking for login details just having them turn off 2 factor
---
I use a 1.5b tengu for c3s, but I can be cap stable under even the heaviest neuts in any of the sites, be 800dps, permatank everything, and run a scram and web, all while cloaky.
---
So my Tengus likely have more utility than yours.
---
*\*hyperventilating\**
---
Sigh wtf
---
yeah was watching his stuff earlier and was like well yeah he is 100% correct this ship is utter crap... and i started to theory craft on how it could be fixed.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I concur with adfdxd. I'll further note that while this is, undoubtedly, a *bot*, CCP's policy against botting and input broadcasting specifically bans their use to gain an advantage in game. One would be hard pressed to argue that Twitch Plays EVE is gaining any sort of advantage over a human player.
---
Thanks!

Sometimes stainguy also has good ideas. I always hate the scrolling with the mousewheel or manually adding a couple k

Yeah I had the idea that initially they were good to use till the 4th Nov tho noticed yesterday that they expired on the 1st
---
Ah, I misunderstood and thought he meant during the fight.
---
probably something something dude carrying shitloads of stuff, something something freighter... OP loves semen...
---
Sir, this is a McDonald's
---
but also yes what u said
---
While you are at it....make it so you can't jump the ansiblex gate when you are tackled or atleast hic pointed and/or increase the spawn distance from the gate. Atm using them has way to much benefit w/o ant risk
---
You wasted an opportunity to just RMT the ISK into cash and at least pay back some of the money you wasted over the years...
---
This is the only sane way to implement this change.
---
they discussed this with ccp at eve vegas and got approval from the devs before doing it. Normally this would be considered input broadcasting, but this is a special case and it hascoffical support.
---
This "event" encourages players to stay docked... well played CCP.
---
Absolutely no flex structure should be 'grandfathered' in. Either idea to force the change is good, the first one being preferable. They could also give a 1 week grace period to unanchor the sub-500km structures at an accelerated rate (maybe make it an hour or something).
---
So how many people where there ? Besides you and wilson
---
What did these things look like anyway?
---
Quite the opposite, it encouraged us to go out and blast people !

Paradox bought the IP from ccp in 2015 -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_Wolf\_Publishing#Purchase\_by\_Paradox\_Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Wolf_Publishing#Purchase_by_Paradox_Interactive)
---
Nobody’s ever activated yet... Including CCP.
---
where is that from? seen it a bunch of times but never got a source
---
Pfft who cares about Null? Ppl who want content are just moving to WHs.
---
Imagine being able to throw around assets like that without alliance/coalition having a say.
---
No wonder they are in the dumpster
---
&gt;People who hate risk or danger chose a bad game to play.
---
I guess that's why you only fly 7 million value catalysts on targets that are certain to be an easy payout? :P
---
While i agree eve is typically always risky and dangerous, your chosen playstyle here is SPECIFICALLY super low risk with no way for anyone to counter you so you shouldn't be using that line. ^^
---
Glorious combat!  This video never gets old.
---
But... that sounds like... effort. That doesn't involve skins or injectors! From CCP? Can I have what your smoking?
---
I think you mean envious?
---
If your alliance lost your supercapital staging keepstar the war is already lost anyways.
---
You did.
---
&gt;A public discord server isn't a private residence. It's more akin to the sidewalk in front of someone's house.
---
The sidewalk of someone's house is publicly owned. A "public" discord is not.
---
&gt; Also don’t allow anyone on to change the ACL of a structure once it’s under attack.
---
Going to make it harder for smaller groups to get help.

Bob requires sacrifices. It sounds like you’ve been lax.

:honk:
---
This happened to me on a wh camp jumping into hs. I was in a corax, warped into a bubble on the wh. Burned to the wh and made it out with about that much structure left. It's pretty exhilarating, nice job.
---
It's a gate, not a jump drive usage.
---
Indeed, an item that was worth 10 isk few days ago, now it's "worth" 1 bil each. Yeah, I'd go with 1 bil being the true value.
---
cool fights. song name?
---
Was it not the one with FAX reps landing on a cruiser or something, it was going from 0 to full to 0 every second?
---
I’ve been giving them ideas aplenty at Fanfest. I don’t need to get money for it, I want the place to thrive.
---
No problem man glad you posted, the more this is highlighted the better chance of it happening.
---
Hisec doesn't mean Safesec. These lads are doing the game a great service.
---
Literally made me "Lol"
---
So what you're saying is that a minmatar ship could have killed it?
---
Common fit for a sabre is MWD + scram + 2x MSE. Assuming you don’t shield tank your eris, what utility are you missing in comparison?
---
Value shown is based on price it was traded for, not listed for.
---
So you just trade a few items with 0 traded in your own citadel and you can set your "value".
---
rogue.
---
rouge is a colour.
---
Pretty sure .Code does it with 12-15 Talos' and a JF to scoop the loot. Can't wait to see what they catch during the 100% loot drop...
---
Add to that how badly blasters have become outclassed on small and med size hulls. Considering the cap cost, and now inferior tracking and dps to disintegrators. Just waiting for a trig dictor now.
---
guys i really miss trash talk mondays. some people need no know they are turbo shi- uh meanies.
---
Good call, check the killmail below.
---
Just let us anchor 2 per system for a month, but only allow one online. Then give a dead line of after a month and offline anything still to close. It's without a doubt the easiest way to do it.
---
CCP logic. "Lets give away a skin for a ship that 99.5% of player will never see on field, much less own and fly... DDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!!!!!"
---
Even eaiser than accelerated anchoring is 2 per system. Still only allows one online but let's nullsec people live them with ease.
---
&gt; Their best option is to leave them alone and let people move them on their own.
---
The problem is that it would only effect new structures. We’d basically have to wait until another major nullsec reshuffle before we even get half of them moved. It could be years before the new system is more common than the old.
---
So long as the repositioning script they use is decent enough to mitigate the more likely oddities, the devs could still work in other ways to fix the outliers. 
---
They could do a system similar to how they did the conversion from outposts to fortizars. Move all the structures that can be moved (or even notify players of their new position early so they can decide) and then anything that doesn’t work has a 7-14 day window before it goes offline on its own.
---
The priority here really should be to deliver the impact of the change sooner, rather than later. If they do it right, there will be some grumbling and frustration for a couple weeks, but that will be less than the frustration from a change with no teeth.
---
My first loss in eve was a venture mining in a 0.6 system. I left it mining while I had two hob 1's out. Had to go handle an issue with one of my kids. When I came back I was floating in my pod next to the venture wreck, the two hobs and three rat wrecks. I like to say it was four to one and I got three.
---
I agree. Remove one high slot from each.
---
I've been on for a month, and found a good Corp with an active Discord that had resources to help out newbros (Superhuman Scouts). They've gifted me 60 million ISK, gave me a haven, introduced me to a slew of third-party websites (EVEWho, EVEPraisal, Pathfinder, etc.), and have several members that like to impart knowledge. 
---
Best advice so far is do all of the Intro Career missions. They're worth ~10 million ISK and you'll finish with like 6 ships. Beyond that, your Corp will have pre-set ship fittings. You can piggyback your Corpmates' scan results (get their scan results without having to do the scanning yourself), along with a while host of gameplay suggestions... not to mention fleet ops (which I'll be ready for one of these days!)
---
Basically, find a group, and don't be a stranger. Oh yeah, patience anfernee to help too!
---
Oh give it a rest. Any "content generation" that makes people want to undock (in this case hunting pvp loot) you could argue would make everyone on the receiving end want to dock because of it. With this idiotic narrative, there's nothing CCP can do to please you because if more PVP players are undocking, you'll see carebears dock. If, god forbid, CCP adds PVE incentive to undock, this subreddit will lose its shit. It's a lose lose.
---
PvP approved zones and gold ammo, you guys are a match made in heaven.
---
Take away damage bouns add scan speed bouns to all. Take 1 low or mid slot away too. All should have 3 high slots.
---
I've seen people go afk while ratting in nullsec with VNI (a droneboat), and come back to find that they'd been attacked by a Loki, and the loki had died to their drones.
---
Super ratting in ranger is def a bot. This doesn't sound like a false positive
---
I used to FC for test before I won the game, so it's all stuff I watched happen.
---
Is this a meme.
---
The Helios is the best ship for its actual job, every other covert ops envies its 5 mid 3 low layout.
---
The opportunity cost involved is quite high. You can go hours actively scanning and scouting only to find nothing worth ganking. It's quite easy to avoid being ganked, either by flying cheap or playing smart, so the gankee has a major advantage.
---
I just can't understand why they would chose to do this. It does nothing but reinforce the current sandcastles with no ability to do so for newer groups and those forced to move from their grandfathered structures.
---
I started the corp to help new players, they only have ventures lol.
---
The root problem is that I am looking for a system  to settle my corp. I want to settle in 0.5 for moon mining and a tatara for that 4%, if we were to settle in nullsec we wouldnt survive at all.
---
It's a cynabal, so in other words honorary half-minmatar.
---
There is plenty of counterplay. A competent player is highly unlikely to lose a ship unwillingly, and that is just as true in highsec as it is in nullsec. If you refuse to play smart and expect "high security" to protect you, you're going to die, and I don't think that's a bad thing.
---
For a risk, there must be an unknown outcome.
---
Pretty sure they grabbed him as he came out of the abyssal (suspect flagged)?
---
If you 'feel it' when you lose in those games where the consequence is waiting 30 seconds to respawn.. god bless you. Enjoy it while you can.
---
Or just warp to every moon mining beacon. Usually they arent avtive tho
---
Multiboxing krabs getting salty that they can’t be the carebears of null and canceling their accounts! Oh no! Such a big failure! It was the equivalent of eve removing neutral NPCs to be honest.

The Price of that item is set by the effor for to farm. That items has been farmed for years waiting that CCP use it for something. For to farm that items you need to kill Drifter at a Drifter Wormhole ( not c5 or c6). That Drifters (Apollo, Artemis and Hikantas Tyrannos) have a dd with 750-850k EHP. For to farm the item you need a fleet with arround 20 - 40 pilots. If that pilot loss their time making it, but you pay their time (100m/h like a normal null farmer ), the price for to farm that items is arround 6000m pero 10 units ---&gt; 600m per unit. For that price, people normally try to sell at 1b or a few more for to make isk with elements. People actually try to collect that items for the future and sometime sell that arround 1b.
---
I understand that people who not try to make that elements say its market manipulation but speak with the alliance [Arakata Reseach Consortium](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006168/) , a proud lore player comunity that make that elements 1 time per week, and know the effort for to make its.
---
We just reactivated the normal price at market for to make our halloweens kills. We could make 100b or more per element like we made in the pass, for to make a Big Kill, but actually, with the 100% halloween drop, we made a legal kill, at normal price of that elements. If that elements are used for anything, the market say their price and wasn't market manipulation. Not everyone buy stuff for to use, just for to collect.
---
While I am all against pure negativeness that has no goal other than be stupid, I am also totally against censoring of constructive criticism. Every voice matters, as long as it is constructive. People that don't agree, that are disappointed by something, deserve the same right to speech than people who support a dev or whatever.
---
A few years back, I was Reddit moderator of a game called Aftermath. I quit when the devs asked us to nuke all negative comments, argumented or not, and this is not okay.
---
People have the right to speak, in good or in bad as long as it is not being a dick for nothing. Sheltering CCP from negativity isn't going to do them any good.
---
After mid December they will offline
---
yup my bad I put the date of the update
---
boomer is a state of mind
---
Praise baby jesus

the system works!\*

\*after 950 upvotes on reddit

Important correction to OP - existing Ansiblex structures won't be offlined until a follow up update in early December. It's not all happening at once but it will happen. Thanks for your input on this one.
---

---
I've also gone back through wormholes I'd just come through to find myself somewhere else than I should've been. I wish I'd had my mapping program set up the last time that happened to me, so I'd have proof. Only seems to happen to me in drifter holes and shattered holes, maybe it's a legit mechanic meant to fuck with us?
---
Out of curiosity, why does your CEO forbid mapping programs? Is it an opsec concern? If so, most of the mapping programs that already exist are open source, so you can host your own instance (like I do for my corp), and restrict access to whoever you like.
---
Spooky space best space.
---
yup date's on me I rushed the title too quickly :(
---
The average IQ of r/Eve has dropped over the years... just as the game has been dumbed down...

post less

It's ok friend, I got excited too.

It's ok friend, I felt excited too.

Genos will cover all kinds of sins, my son.
---
All skills trained?
---
900 upvote because it doesn't negatively affect any of them.
---
CCP pushed this off on the players and are basically costing a player 3 hours per bridge. We have to pay them to be able to fix their mistake.
---
Nah. Helios is the best pure scanner; none of the other hulls come close. You can use a depot if you need to swap in a cyno.
---
The fifth mid lets you go double rangefinding and the hull's agility makes the ship align in under 3 seconds with double istabs plus a nano, leaving a utility rig (after the requisite gravity capacitor) for a hyperspatial or whatever. 
---
I also have to say: fuck all the haters. The ugly duckling kickstand aesthetics are special and wonderful and shouldn't be altered in any way by the hateful Spaceship Symmetry brigade. Perhaps some warp animations would be nice, but otherwise leave it be.
---
Make it more difficult for zero-risk gankers?
---
You're getting a month's grace period to continue using the un-nerfed jump gates. They did ease the burden of the changeover.
---
Yeah, mate, hes totally gonna have a choice coming out of that site!
---
I wonder how much of this was because they were getting brigaded by reddit (and thus general bitterness) and how much is day to day practice? I shit on them a bit yesterday but once I took a bit to think about it and approach it realizing that a brigade was ongoing it swayed me a bit. 
---
But that's not really for me to say. I know mod teams get heated during these kinds of events but I don't know enough to say that was the case.
---
Not really.
---
What do you call what happened this passed summer? Mind your narrative.
---
Our conversations on Open Comms aren't coherent enough to be hateful, so we don't have this problem.
---
Because forcing them offline instead of moving them makes the the players do the work instead of ccp. So this only hurts a small handful of people and everyone else gets to celebrate.
---
Maybe ccp should just move them.
---
Surely you can't be serious.
---
Do beacons and gates need to also be 500 from eachother?  It would be really nice to get a clarification on that before we start so we don't have to do this twice.
---
Oh that makes total sense. Thank you.
---
You are implying I should be able to trust more people and I am saying maybe ccp should stop fucking us and make it so we don't have to. I am not attacking a strawman I am attacking ccps constant fucking laziness. There are a ton of ways they could make this less awful for the player base but instead they just throwing up a giant middle finger and say fuck you guys clean up our mess.
---
&gt; and probably one or two others I am forgetting
---
Brand Newbros ;)
---
Every alliance is going to watch your killboard before inviting you. Some might give it a big importance, some may not, so your statement is pretty much bullshit.
---
That's not how the market works.
---
That is one way to pad your killboard.
---
You literally have it the easiest.
---
You could also just *not* be in a large group.
---
&gt;  it either gets moved or it becomes a monument. 
---
Which seems reasonable and is what makes the most sense to me.
---
I got them through the events/giveaways so they were free to me :D  
---
Still have 3-4 sets laying around that I could open up if I really wanted to.  
---
Price goes up a lot between the events that bring them out again.
---
I get that it can be quite draining to listen to "Fuck CCP" all the time. 
---
I get that some ppl want to talk about something  else. Especially in discord. But there are other ways to achieve that despite banning ppl from stating their opinion. If ccp sucks to them then ccp sucks and who can blame them for thinking like that. It's not like the hate comes from noway 
---
A solution?
---
A: be a public forum and just accept it. TBH freedom of speech goes in both ways. Positive and negative opinions 
---
B: Ban ppl and then don't pretend you are a forum for the community, just a community. 
---
C: create a positivity / safe space channel in discord like every other alliance with a brain and moderate this one
---
Meh. someone hit 10k on the first week
---
well just seems foolish to me. maybe make them be not anchorable near keepstars (as i would say the dd is oppressive.)
---
"I shouldn't have to trust people!" 
---
Your brain on spod. 
---
If there are people you don't trust, don't blue them or recruit them.
---
This is another one of those times when ccp should ignore reddit. Which is also all of the times.
---
We used to play a game when I was a kid called knock down ginger. As a child it was hilarious but with the benefit of hindsight and a doorbell to call my own I can confirm that it was in fact bullshit.
---
People dont underestimate the CAs it's the opposite as time sure most estimate the insane price and go meh I'll gimp the ship a little instead.
---
I dont understand why you choose this title or why you uploaded this but...ok.
---
Yes but I made a page here at [http://2kjl3h2khhkjf2kfk2f3lfjkhluivhsdohof2.angelfire.com](http://2kjl3h2khhkjf2kfk2f3lfjkhluivhsdohof2.angelfire.com) it's free and it took me like 15 minutes to make.
---
We did it reddit!
---
&gt;I really don't know where you get these ideas from and how you're still playing this game with such naivety. 
---
You mean like wardecs, links, and command broadcasting. The shit that was once in the game, but is no longer or is illegal because it was always shit.
---
Ganking as you know it is probably next, but we are apparently on "CCP's schedule" so it takes a few years of abuse.
---
&gt;If anything, EVE Players prove that adaptation is the key to success.
---
What a joke. Every time CCP steps in, it's because there is no fucking "adaptation".
---
&gt;Whenever a change/new content is implemented, players will have to adapt. 
---
So move gankers to lowsec. Then they can "adapt". You want other players to adapt while you sit there taking zero risk. Typical dishonest trash.
---
&gt;And the mechanics are neither broken nor abusive. They are permitted and even endorsed.
---
Zero risk. No counterplay. No consequences. Links were claimed to not be broken because "just bring your own". Proven dumb.
---
&gt;Like I said, CCP doesn't consider ganking problematic. 
---
Oh, really? You speaking for CCP now? What's your dev name?
---
&gt;If you undock, you consent to PVP and that includes the possibility of getting ganked. If you want 0 risk, go play something else. EVE isn't for you.
---
Absolutely false.
---
&gt;All I can say is I'm happy with how things are and a lot of players in this thread share this sentiment. So keep spilling salt and feed the gankers with your tears. It's what drives them!
---
Of course, you like zero risk and no consequences. Abusers said the same thing about everything they abused. Never been ganked in 10+ years.
---
