No they don't.

To clarify, this subreddit is salty and occasionally toxic as fuck.  The in game community is much, *much* better.

Technically Sapporo Jones is the TEST leader/CEO and Dran is 2nd but yeah, Vily and PGL pretty much decide what TEST does.

Huff gas.

The autistic players I know have their shit figured out.

It's a trap!!! Ops wrong scifi reference...
---
&gt;Is EVE in a good place right now?
---

---
no, but why not it's free
---
Create an alt. Dump isk and stuff from your main into your alt for skills and stuff, and go find a good lowsec PVP group. Specifically Faction Warfare. They'll teach you solo/small gang tactics, and you could get some nice fights kicking around in lowsec. Look into Amarr lowsec around Amamake, or better, Caldari lowsec in Black Rise.
---
I think they are assuming the RMT pricing is based on how often CCP catches a RMT transaction.
---
So they are using the difference in price between buying ISK (plex) from CCP vs buying from a 3rd party website to in theroy come up with % of being caught RMT.
---
It is a big assumption to assume this is a major factor, let a alone the only factor influencing the price of ISK on a 3rd party website.
---
You should contact /u/365degrees. He's the one who painted it and I'm sure would be happy to do more (when he's not busy with other stuff). It was also a paid commission so keep that in mind.
---
No it's not.  Game has probably 18 months before Pearl Abyss shuts it down.  But it is f2p to try, so why not?
---
Nice.
---
Petition: for just 50 minerals and 50 gas, we can make it so that you can warp to any corp keepstar in EVE
---
He's like that on comms too. While everyone else was all "grrr \_\_\_\_\_, fuck those guys, camp them back to hisec" he would be saying a bunch of crazy positive shit. He's like a camp counselor in a room full of ax murderers. It was hilarious.
---
We had meet up today at Apex Wings!, we try to meet monthly - join the eve NC discord Raleigh/Charlotte meetups!  https://discord.gg/7qBwGKe

Shit maybe we should delete PANIC then?
---
When you walk through either end, do you get a report of all the structures and people 14.3 meters around you, and for 60 seconds, people are strangely unaware of your presence?
---
Have a feeling CCP might be announcing some exciting new implants like shield slaves

i think gigx came and cut them

There's a reason self-report studies are bottom barrel in the scientific community: the data they provide is useless.

Zoom in on your ship, weapon noise scales based on your proximity to what you are looking at. If you are doing any pve you are probably zoomed out too far to hear anything
---
Hull tank and a full rack of neuts.
---
Nice

he's an updog for sure
---
The top 0.1% of eve multiboxes 10 rorqs.  In any mmorpg you have your 0.1%. Most dudes just have one or two maximum.

Seems like a good place to partake in such activities.

ANSWER THE CALL
---
Vegas is a blast there is a lot of space stuff during the day then partying and hanging out at night time.There are a lot of different events both CCP sponsored and otherwise as the week progresses people do all kinds of random shit since Vegas is the kind of place to get into weird stuff. 
---
Its a lot of fun and when in doubt just walk up to the hotel lobby bar and look for fellow space nerds. Goons usually send about 200 people you shouldnt have trouble finding them if you look.
---
At least you have to be at keyboard to activate PANIC when you get dropped. If you do nothing during the PANIC duration you die at the end of it.
---
Ships that self tackle like the Rorq need something like PANIC in order to get people to use them. Without PANIC Rorquals will disappear and it will be aligned orcas doing the boosting.
---
I've tried that, I also tried zooming on the other ship, but there is no sound whatsoever, and I'd love to play
---
Bots can't do what comes after, which is coordinate a response fleet to come save you after PANIC ends. If a friendly fleet isn't on field after PANIC ends you die all the same. Rorquals is one of the few PvE activities that a human should be able to do better than a bot.
---
Well, at least for now. Maybe bots can be programmed to D-scan, copy paste the results to a parser, and send the link to whoever is in charge of the response fleet.
---
how bout dat panic on faxes, dreads, and marauders tho
---
Who uses faxes, dreads, and marauders to PvE in cyno enabled K space?
---
RL EVE meetings are great. Good job!
---
It’s a great time! If you’re not going with anyone you know from in game don’t worry, you’ll meet a crap ton of new friends and have hours worth of stuff to talk about. 
---
The day time is full of conference type stuff, from CCP devs to player presentations. A schedule will come out with who’s doing what and at what time. Along with conference type presentations there will be round tables and Q&amp;A’s sprinkled in where you’ll get a chance to chat with devs and ask questions. Before, during, and after presentations there’ll be mingling with other players and devs which is also fun. 
---
The nightly stuff is completely different. Drinking, lots of drinking! This year we’ve got the axe throwing on Thursday night, pub crawl on Friday, and the big Saturday night party at Caesar’s Palace. These events are a blast! You drink and party it up with Eve nerds! Even if you’re not a drinker, you’ll still have a shitton of fun. 
---
It’s a huge social thing, so meet everyone and have fun. I’ll be there working the streaming side of things, if you see me (my badge will say Torvald Uruz) say hi!
---
Are there any other games like EVE Online?
---
Check your settings.
---
If you have missiles and effects turned off you also won't hear them
---
Just my opinion homie. I've explained my position. Conversation terminated
---
You use them at the range they can shoot.
---
They CAN be, depending on usage.
---
They don't need to travel but you lose half your dps.
---
Generally against frigates, destroyers and most cruisers, the sentries are better.
---
If you are going to be killing lots of Tanky individuals or things clumped tightly together, heavy are better.
---
I dont really know of any corps that fit that time zone, but heres a way to find one. Go out into lowsec that you'd like to live on, and fight people. Do your best and show you have some balls and some talent. Convo everyone who kills you, be nice, give GF's in local, eventually you'll be recruited by someone who is doing EXACTLY what you are looking for.
---
None of them are ever active during my prime time sadly (USA west, so 3:30 - 6 eve time)
---
Try Faction Warfare. Its a good way to start and Ull die a bunch of times. But that time u get ur first solo kill it will be so satisfying. 
---
I did some FW then moved in WH living and Hunting in my Stratios during Blackout.
---
Then I did some exploroceptor hacking in Catch and my next plan is to do fleet pvp in WH or Camp catch with smart bombs ;)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
theres always new stuff to try, dont be discouraged when u keep dying, it took me 10 deaths to get my first FW tristan kill
---
Not really.
---
Are you on the Horde discord? We ping for things to do all day long. When give out free ships for combat and mining. Contact a NBI rep in the chat channel and get hooked up with ships. Get on cons an joining the fleets or ops, ask questions. Everyone will try to help you out bud.
---
None are even close. Just do the free trial of eve, find some cool dudes, do some research on the e-uni wiki, see if its for you :)
---
Hook up at the moosearmy party and go with my dudes for a great time. All welcome at their gatherings.
---
I dread krab in a C5. I'd say you're right!
---
I mean I know I'm retarded. It's why I like to pve and not pvp
---
I overcame this problem with solo pvp in lowsec. (and sometimes null) 
---
Belonging in those big alliances was, in the end, quite boring. You anchor up and shoot, no brains needed.
---
Solo pvp on other hand makes you actually think and act, gotta do all by yourself. So find a corp that has other solo pvpers and ask them advice. Sometimes go on small roams with them etc. Much more fun than being just another grunt in someone's RTS.
---
lots of words to say 'they don't enforce rmt '
---
BOTTING is already a Breach of the EULA.
---
So I don't think RMT is really a stretch. That's what most of botting is anyway.
---
And there was still far more than enough, considering less isk sold for more money, especially before plex
---
If you're running a farm, you likely have the auditory alarms set up for all the different crap which allows you the head farmer to ping for help and then light the cyno, while your bots auto tank.
---
Those aren't bots, they are active and engaged players.
---
wdym diamond rats?
---
Actually was able to find a group this way, it’s good advice!  I was solo roaming in Lowsec, saw a fleet pass through and looked them up.   In this case they let me roam with them once, I should reach out again. I’ll keep trying
---
They normally sit on stations, gates, &amp; belts. And their icon is a diamond
---
Did you try to naruto run through it naked while making warp sounds and saying "Warp Drive Activated"?
---
Yeah, even as an enemy I've gotta give them credit, it's a great logo
---
New to the game, but my best friend and I are going

doesnt matter, we're talking about invuln modules on self-tackled ships.

Really loved this, primarily for monitoring alpha character queues. I feel like the new app is nice, but doesn't deliver at an easy glance what I loved about [Skillq.net](https://Skillq.net). Perhaps it will just take some getting used to but it was really nice to be able to just open my always pinned tab, glance at the 30 or so characters I have training and see if any of the alphas needed to have their queues updated.
---
Thank you so much for building this tool in the first place, it was a huge help to me.
---
How do you recommend to update the overview?
---
20k people are playing, down almost half from 2-3 yrs ago.
---
20k people are still playing!
---
No, the game is not in a good place right now, and in all likelihood CCP (the devs) really *are* winding it down. There have been a bunch of layoffs, they've cut down a lot of the big events (Fanfest went from an amphitheater to some guy's house this year, and the Alliance Tournament has been "on hold" for 2 years), one alliance has basically "won" the game, and the player count has dropped significantly over the summer.
---
That said, **for** ***you*** **this is probably still a good time to join.** As bitter as I am about the state of the game, joining it as a new player will still be a super cool experience from your perspective and the overall health of the game is at a place where you have at least a couple of years to run around and pew pew to your heart's content. CCP also has at least one more "last hurrah" up their sleeve before the lights actually go out.
---
So yeah, the health of the game is declining but it ain't dead yet. It's basically in it's late sixties, in human years. You can still do a few lines of coke and bang a couple of hookers before the pacemaker gives out.
---
EVE is a good place, /r/Eve on the other hand is filled with bittervets, that complain about things that happen, things that don't happen, changes made, changes not made, changes reversed, and why CCP doesn't reverse other changes. 
---
r/EVE has become similar to how kugu, Scrapheap and Failheap were once upon a time - filled with bittervets, while at the same time some new upstarts, who had banded together on this thing called Reddit happened to make an alliance as a TEST, and with them a breath of fresh air came to New Eden.
---
Its worth trying. This is quite an amazing game if you dont focus on perfection and if you avoid all the naysayers around. Good luck with your search :)
---
You ask as if anyone here actually plays EVE

---
The Typhoon works fine. I mean, it's suboptimal, as you seem to be aware.
---
I never moved the goal post, that was you friend.
---
My point was singular and has remained the same throughout this discussion. Current null sec PvE is a broken mechanic under super umbrellas. CCPs stated that, players know it, the economic reports show it, the massive increase in Titans and Supers speak directly to it. 
---
As time has moved on since super umbrellas became a reality, more and more people have embraced it and began upgrading / creating PvE alts to use it. As a result the ISK / Minerals MADE are going up including over the last two years in spite of CCP's best effort to balance it.
---
Reading comprehension will show you that my statements have not changed from that point since we began.
---
Understanding isnt really the point is it though? You understand that Null Sec PvE is broken, is just broken in your favor. It is likely why you are so desperate to scream that Null Sec PvE is getting 'nerfed' in order to create a narrative that will allow it to continue.
---
You never had to address 'points', you had to address to singular point I raised above. You never did.
---
So yes you are intellectually dishonest. You are trying to deflect attention away from a mechanic that is broken in your favor. 
---
In any case.  I have better things to do then argue with you. Its pretty clear where your heart / wallet is.
---
I did use arty maelstorm that did fine on l4 mission, but I have been able to upgrade to Machariel which is better overall for me..
---
This idea comes up alot. I ask you to have a read of some of the more logical responses to it as a concept. Particularly id be very cautious in your concept of how long is OK to stay cloaked.
---
There are many many situations where being cloaked for long periods of time are essential pieces of active content in eve.
---
I would like to also highlight to you that you have used a interesting phrase 'not healthy for the game'. What does this mean. Ill take a risk and assume you mean that you (and your buds) dont want to undock to PvE because of cloaky camper x. Additionally you believe (with good reason) that cloaky camper x has more accounts in other good ratting/mining locations and despite the size of null your group has you few other 'uncamped' options for you? Sure that sucks, but with the cyno changes his options for attacking you is more limited and more wothin your reach to defend yourselves.
---
Some people in the game go to great lenghts to find content for people. That cloaky camper could very well be a link in a chain to create content. When he 'boogymans and tackles you' and a fleet comes in, it is days, weeks, months of game time he has put into that and probably hours of pings, organisation and coord to get a bunch of people onto grid with you. Your team then gets to use the time to ping a fleet and you now have content. That is healthy for the game no?
---
Eve is generally referred to as a PvP game, because frankly there isnt a single player mode. So you need to identify that different parts of space, when you undock, trigger a level of risk. That risk is rewarded (not always fairly). As an example you could rat in the very system you want on the teat server, its very unlikely camped and even if it was, nonconsensual PvP is not allowed there. 
---
I agree that it sucks feeling like you cant 'do what you want' because another might interact with you, but take a step back and realise its an MMO and content is healthy for the game. There are many options in eve to do PvE, being in NS you have chosen to make your PvE time in a location where you get local and get good isk returns for your time spent.
---
omfg...
---
There's a lotta dudes in your own alliance who would beg to differ. An entire military division of them, to be exact.
---
Yeah damn goons always taking space...oh wait

I don't know about you but if I need to get a couple of foreign bobs and papers I head down to my local Bureau De Change.
---
You should try wormholes. Sounds like the type of play style you seek.
---
I don't run missions/play anymore but I suggest you go for a tempest or any turret based platform. T1 auto's are actually pretty strong and aside from not being able to use t2 ammo do pretty decent dps
---
*Warping to Stargate; warp drive active.*
---
*Approaching Stargate*
---
*Autopilot disabled; waypoint reached.*
---
Goonswarm Federation already has a flag.
---
Panfam though?
---
How much do you like level 4 missions? Do you REALLY like them?
---
If so, I'd recommend using either a Cruise missile Typhoon or an Artillery Maelstrom for now. While grinding isk with either of those, start training for Marauders (at least level 4) and then fit up a Vargur.
---
The Vargur is easily the most badass ship for L4 missions. A Machariel (not a minmatar ship) is great for Blitzing the missions as quick as possible. But a Vargur is, by my testing, unmatched in terms of full mission clear speeds. 1200dps with autocannons that reach out to 77km with a sub 60 second Microjumpdrive CD and an INSANE amount of tank in Bastion mode.
---
With high grade crystals, a single rep cycle of a Pith XL Shield Booster combined with a Pith Shield Boost Amp reps for over 5500 shield hp in bastion, more than half your shields. The ship is completely overkill for level 4s but it is a lot of fun to fly and I make over 100m an hour just doing full clears and no burner missions.
---
Like you, I'm a Minmatar only kind of guy and the Vargur is the absolute king of Minmatar mission runners. Training time may be long but it is worth it.
---
This guy rorq mines.
---
Scamming
---
But make sure you're dead set on level 4s being your primary income for a little while because Marauders are not good for much else.
---
Yes, yes and yes!

For the Maelstorm i was going to try this fit.

Actually very doable for a dedicated explorer.
---
Hey i think most of the giys are right with searching a corp that match you better, withon Horde or somewhere else. 
---
But i have a Question: have you tried to get something done with our standing fleet? I mean not only join it: joyn standing and get on comms. I mean we met the last 4 days something around 3 Newbeans and tried to help them getting into the ships they wanna fly and start hunting with nearby backup. 
---
I understand if you feel like a number or lonely but getting involved isnt that hard. Try the standing flight while some Sheriffs and NBIs are around and just ask if somebody can be your backup if you are going for a target within our borders.
---
Gas explosions? K space? 
---
The venture mines gas fast Enough I would prefer a gas forman ship like a porpoise with gas harvesters.. because there is no real reason to have links unless you have 5ish plus ventures going the bonus is meh vs another venture huffing.
---
And if it's not better than the veture why use it.. I don't use the prospect because of this.. it's just more slots for more isk.. no huffing bonus compared to venture.
---
nice play

Something doesn't have to be new to be entertaining. Now, if they were *claiming* it was new, tha'd be different.

don't you ever wonder how cool it would be to be one of those 20 cynabals that keeps coming to kick your shit in every single day  
---

you can. its not that hard. why dont you try out some public fleets to get  your feet wet into smaller pvp groups to see if you like it. try to go in with an open mind.

---
just saw the prices. insane. but everyone keeps recommending the vargur so now thats my goal.

Because he's the one that either presented or came up with it for the day. We don't credit the smartest caveman every time we describe who made the wheels on our car.

Alright, I get it. You guys are very proud of yourself and won't let anyone to fuck with your self-esteem.
---
I am in horde and I was in a very similar place to you not too long ago. I even quit the game for a while because I was so frustrated with being a new player and not being able to do anything. After I came back I did manage to find my way and start enjoying myself. My advice is to not rely on any one thing. Diversify just a little bit. I do pi, manufacturing, reactions, mining, ratting, and of course pvp. Don't listen to people that tell you that you have to max out skills in any one thing. Develop a good base and figure out what you like to do. Not everything should be about the isk/hr.
---
Personally I don't really care for big fleets and I can't stand tidi fights so I rarely do them. We do have a lot of roaming fleets that go out looking for fights. If that is something you are into there are more than enough people that would even help you learn how to FC one of those fleets. I have a great time going out with a kitchen sink fleet and dunking some nerds or getting dunked on. As far as learning pvp, some lessons are just lessons you have to learn the hard way. It sucks, but if you stick with it you will get better at it. 
---
I am not here to try to convince you to stay in horde. If it's not for you it's not for you. You should try to find the place where you fit in the best or join a corp that is doing the things you like to do. What I can do for you is help you get up on your feet. PM me and I will give you my in-game name. I can help you out with getting some ships past what we offer rookies because I know that can get kind of boring. I can help you set up some goals as far as helping maximizing your fun/hr if you would like.

The Vargur and all other Marauders have a problem though: they're active tanked, and Bastion Mode doesn't protect against cap warfare. Should be fine if you're not dealing with Blood Raiders, though.
---
So there are videos on setting up your UI but basically there is a little button with about 4 lines to the left of the word "Overview" at the top of the overview window. Click on the tab you want to adjust ( I use the tab labeled "combat) and then right click that little button next to "Overview" and you get a menu window. Select overview settings and then click on the "entities" group. In there will be the various types of ships it will show. I believe the one for the invasion is "precursor invaders" or something like that. I just select all and then unselect the collidable items, just keeping the ships.
---
Terrible description but I hope it helps.
---
Eh, WTM Incursions takes Vargurs.
---
Second on the Arty Maelstrom. It's not perfect, but it'll do the job.
---
They would need to find that undock button first.
---
You love to see it
---
Pepehands
---
Yeah, the T1 minnie battleships are kinda bad because none of them have a range bonus, and ACs really need a range bonus to be usable in most mission ranges.
---
1400MM arty Maelstrom works and is easy, but its reallllly boring and slow because the DPS is pretty bad.  The alpha is hilarious though, so it can be amusing to 1-2 shot battleships.   But waiting for the recycle is painful.
---
Honestly, the Machariel is a MUCH MUCH better option due to great DPS and a falloff bonus while being super fast, so ACs are usable; it is one of the best mission ships in the game while being relatively cheap now.  It is only half Minmatar though, but uses their weapon systems.
---
Vargur is on par with the mach (mach is better for blitzing) but as noted, is expensive as balls, takes a ton of training that isnt' good for much other than missioning, and is slow, so kinda painful on travel missions.  It's the ultimate pure-Minmatar mission runnier though.
---
Hey man, if you want to report me, there's nothing stopping you from doing so. I'm just not sure that an effect of the game we all play will really lend you too much support in CCP's "ban this guy, he killed me" department.
---
&gt; Any fellow Goons going?
---
Tons. Follow the forums, jabber. We will have a telegram group for coordinating. All goons are welcome anywhere people are doing things.
---
I think someone pee'd in your cheerios my dude.  Or you need a Snickers .
---
I don't know what CCP was thinking when they thought that allowing placing flex structures so close to Citadels was a good idea.
---
Anyway, nice one.
---
On the flip side, their tank is such overkill for L4s that even cap warfare doesn't really matter as long as you prioritize the neuters.
---
If you're planning to do full clear missions, you want as much range and dps as possible to kill all the rats quickly. You also need good application to make sure it actually hits. I would recommend MJD sniping. Minimal tank, max dps and application and you use an MJD to get to range and just kill everything. Typhoon fleet is great for this.

1173 dps out to 100km. You can use the sentries to blap frigates as they burn in and use the missiles on cruisers and up. You can always MJD back to the gate when you're done so there's no downtime between killing stuff and taking the gate.
---
Bless you Signal Cartel. You guys will ever be the single corp I never fire upon while in NS space.
---
Ill agree on that point. I didnt attempt to break it down more. It is extremely plausible that your super risk free C5 farming methods skew the entire thing.I am sure hundreds of C5 anoms get run a day with 0-1 losses, since the only way you die in nestors/snakes is pretty much DC or pilot error

Neither do I. Anyways, thanks for the compliment.

I started with cruise missile typhoon, switched to Vargur, but now fly paladin because I really like armor tanked laser boats. It's slow af, though.

To take in the fact that you don’t even know what type of ship I’m in but I just ground a whole system to a halt by my presence.

Spoiler alert: It’s just a Astero and a Prospect.

Goddamn, that's funny as hell. Hope you get many more kills before it's inevitably destroyed.
---
Gas harvesting is strong but not top tier income. It's multiboxable but has natural limiting factors in that you have to find gas clouds, and the frequency of finding those clouds can be pushed up or down based on how much lower tier gas you're willing to huff. The existing "upgrade" ships each have niche uses with powerful upsides and powerful downsides so that there isn't an obvious best strategy.
---
I was going to ask why you think CCP should spend their dev time on this, but on reflection I'm just flatly opposed to a gas exhumer. They've got balance right for once, so let's not mess with it.
---
It's hardly a unique solution. You were using or at least trying to use chaining of KS's DD for quite some time. Creating a path isn't exactly new, but I guess innovation this time was that the target was moving into chain range as DD was spoiling.
---
If it works it'll claim at least few attacking ships, and costs defender next to nothing. At least few battleships were lost that way.
---
Dealing with that DD also requires attacker to clear site of any wrecks and cans, because they can be targeted, and used to start the chain. Overall all, lot's of pain for just setting on timer on highly replaceable structure.
---
Nah man, no reporting here. Reporting cuts the entertainment short. I want to see how far this can be pushed.
---
This post is bad, and you should feel bad.

Signal Cartel is pretty awesome. If I wasn't a fan of PVP, I'd probably join. And I have absolutely no plans to blow them up ever.
---
Donated to the corp because this is so wholesome lol
---
&gt; Moreover if the person is really just AFK all day long (and in reality  is just there to discourage ratting) then that same player who just  logged in can start to rat and have fun. 
---
That's a hugely flawed argument, because nobody cloaky camps to be AFK 100% of the time time. I've seen a lot of cloaky campers, many of which varied greatly in their activity level. But not once have I ever seen a totally inactive camper. It makes no sense to do that. Why waste an alpha account in that manner, knowing that your targets will simply ignore you? - No, they know that the camper must be seen to act at least occasionally.
---
However it doesn't require a *lot* of activity on the cloaker's part to become that constant threat. Even just a 2-3 minutes at random intervals a few times per day will do. ("Random" being the keyword there.) - The remaining 23h 50m of the day you can stay AFK and the residents of that system will have to assume you are active every second of that, or they will feed constantly during those few minutes of activity. Which nobody will ever do willingly.
---
That, in my mind, has always been the *imbalance* in cloaky camping: it demands absolute, unyielding effort from the defender to counter; but only minimal, sporadic efforts on the attacker's part to do. - This entire branch of game play desperately needs some more options, both for attacking and defending. Right now it's basically just: drop blops/assorted cloakies to attack, and have a permanent counter-drop in place to defend. That's it. No real variation on that exists. Capital escalations, perhaps. But even then the first part adheres to the limited formula. - And that formula is almost laughably skewed in favor of the attacker now.

In the context of your question, No. There are no third party or reverse engineered server instances you can run on your own similar to WoW and mangosdb etc.  However, SiSi is a public test server that is always online, and as others mentioned, CCP occasionally opens up their other test servers to the player base.
---
This subreddit is always a dumpster fire. But don't worry about it. Go play some EVE.
---
there were lots of small scale conflicts over money moons by small corps.
---
Probably a service for those stuck in wormholes without a way to scan out an exit.
---
Typhoon hands down, it's arguably better than the Raven because it has an application bonus rather than the useless(for PvE) range bonus.
---
Typhoon is also one of the few Minmatar ~~scrapheaps~~ ships that actually looks decent.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

The rest can also be quite profitable (i know its relative). You can always cargo scan the cans.

That falls into the n+1 mentality though. You could add in some easy limits to prevent abuse. If you wanted to prevent attacker abuse you could make the NPCs not follow standings (except not attacking their owner corp/alliance). Then if several groups sent harassment NPC fleets to one location, they'd end up shooting each other as much as their owners intended target. After all a human fleet doesn't keep focusing on Goons when TEST shows up. It switches to the best killboard rewards.
---
All these "huge boost on a large cooldown" abilities are cancerous WoW shit and shouldn't exist.
---
Yeah, this was in April. I was living on a highsec island in molden heath. There was  industrial Corp there that I started a fight with because I started to mine their ore (athanor). They got mad, I told them to F off. War started and I lost all the fights and lost two structures. It was fun but I lost and moved out.
---
Just. Loot. Everything.
---
Mining is totally fine. What isn't fine is that you can have alts.
---
I sadly think I earned more through mining than I have with explo.  Even in nullsec and wormholes, the loot just isn't very good.
---
Cherry picked sites are the worst.
---
It’s most efficient to just get to hacking really fast and loot everything, sometimes I carry a cargo scanner, but not often, rather have the extra mid, with frostline, ziguma, or T2 scanner and T2 rig and blackglass implant you go through cans really fast.
---
Cherry ~~picked sites~~ pickers are the worst. 
---
FTFY
---
nah, i'm asking for less boring game. more challenge for everyone. there is no harm to be recloak every hour to show that you alive, give people more content. i'm in

So I can have 6 toons doing PI, dualbox gas huffing Prospects, and tackling/scouting for my main.

Unlike normal rats, diamond rats are enhanced for PvP.

Yep, but explo is wayy better if you don’t mine moon goo or in a orca/rorqual. Also gameplay wise it’s much more entertaining and active. I’ve been my alliance scanning/wh guy for a while and the blackout would have been harder to deal with for us if I didn’t explore for my isk, and I managed to encourage 3-4 others to do what I do and we’ve been farming some good fights out of WH’s since,
---
Start an ISK hunting fleet or something and recruit some pilots for an excursion. 
---
In another game I play called Squad it only works if someone is brave/social enough to be a Squad Leader by creating a squad for people to join in, pick a role and await orders. Same philosophy could be applied to Eve.
---
Just tell everyone you're a newbie FC so they know to help.
---
Sorry I'm relatively new to EVE, what happened? (other than a dreadnaught getting fucked?)
---
Weird, in the time that it would take me to explore 3-5 C2/C3 holes for explo I could get triple that either doing mining missions or just mining 5%/10% in highsec belts.  I would have fresh spawn pirate sites that would have half the cans *empty* or containing a carbon or two.
---
It was genuinely pathetic; I'd get more money doing Blue on a daytrip than doing explo.
---
I keep hearing this, but never with details as to what those fixes should look like. If you or anybody else has an idea on what the new EvE UI should look like then PLEASE, let me know. I want to see it for myself so I can sing its praises.
---
Wardecs without having an alt
---
If you're only gonna go for the IAP cans take the 10s extra to explode the other cans (hack twice insta failing to destroy them) you're only fucking yourself over if you don't despawn the site as it'll stop new ones spawning
---
people are talking about EVE being dangerous, prepare to die while undocked. and yet, some people are untouchable
---
Glad to hear signal cartel is still putting out great pilots! I got my start there before I became a pirate. Sad to see how heavily they are preyed upon in thera. You would think with so many great wormholes to roam from, people wouldn't be camping paleo undock to kill helpless frigates. Hope they are still doing alright!
---
you have balls to camp and kill people, you have the ball to die. not one-way advantage
---
Signal Cartel is undoubtedly one of the nicest &amp; most interesting pve group I've ever had a pleasure to deal with ingame. Same goes to PushX. @whoever runs the show in these groups - you're breathtaking
---
Anyone that is untouchable from cloaking can’t touch you, once they uncloak you can both touch each other.
---
Main: Subcap main, rorq pilot 1, market alt

Alt 2: Fax pilot, rorq pilot 3

At least 1 pilot per account that can scan and the 3 rorq pilots can also use assault frigs for triple boxxing t5 abyssals.

1.7 billion ISK in-game will allow you to purchase 30 days of Omega without any real-world currency. Hope you choose this and stay with the game. 1.7 billion isn't actually hard to come up with, once you know where the money is.
---
Whenever I see Signal Cartel I take my fingers off the trigger and move on. Too good people. :D
---
They were thinking "well jump bridges were in POS gun range". I don't think it's right, but that's clearly the thought.
---
so, why do you undock to be cloak? if you stay cloak you are invulnerable but people you try to "touch" is not? there is no harm to be recloak every hour if you really play the game. if you are not, log off
---
Keepstars have a doomsday that strikes one target and bounces to others near it. The enemies were sitting just out of range, so what they did was flew a friendly ship out towards the enemies and just as it got to the edge of the Doomsday range, fired at their own ship as it coasted out of the range and adjacent to the enemies who thought they were safe, killing them. There's a bit of spool up time on the doomsday so as long as it's activated while the ship is in-range it will still work, allowing the suiciding ship to coast even a bit beyond the full range of the weapon.
---
 Thanks mate
---
Signal Cartel are Bobs divine will given form. They are sweeties and shall be treasured now, and into perpetuity.
---
:O. and if u have good standings they fight for you like said above?
---
Do they call in reinforcements for u as well?
---
Never not upvote squishy.
---
Youve played this game awhile, perhaps too long. Lol kidding. Thats interesting you unsubbed your accounts since then. Even for spy purposes and scout purposes, im surprised you had unsubbed your other accounts. Thanks for your input :)
---
A reminder that faction guns can use T2 ammo now.
---
hope you safe and stay cloaky in your mom's skirt
---
No probes? Surely a wormhole would have popped up eventually
---
Don't forget that free to plays didn't exist back then, so it's entirely possible that half of the concurrent users aren't even paying now.   Also, a lot of those F2Ps are high sec bots.
---
you are what is killing the game, pls unsub again
---
Yeah I asked them about it in voice chat, they were all very..."meh" on the idea.  So I used my Maelstrom in their groups for a bit until my Vargur training was ready and now I just make the same amount as running with them but solo. Plus I don't risk my Vargur flying it 25-35 jumps every week when the Incursion moves.
---
Although I've been considering training toward a Paladin since I already have Marauder V out of the way, cause the armor tanked Incursion group (can't remember the name right now) takes those in their doctrine. I have zero Amarr skills though, would take a bit.
---
Right, good point. Where I grind my level 4s there are no Blood Raider missions so I never thought about them. That said there is a target priority toward killing certain Amarr ships in L4s cause one of them is a battleship with neuts, so watch out for that.
---
I still remember watching the Fanfest streams every year, not for the information, but for the escapades of the staff we know and love.  Anyone remember Mimic getting shaved, Guard getting kicked in the head by an MMA dude, Dolan getting paintball raped, etc?  Big speeches from clearly excited devs about the roadmap they're working on?  Now all of these people are either gone or stuck in a dungeon, not interacting with the playerbase at all.  
---
Now all we get is some fucking retard talking about how great their next instanced garbage is, or reports from people that look depressed and on meth talking about why the game's really not dying.  It breaks my heart, 10 years ago I talked nothing but praise for CCP to my friends.  Now?  Lol.
---
k
---
CCP has been counting on these retards to prop them up for a while.  Now, even some of the retards are starting to leave...that, in itself, is pretty alarming.
---
Eh, there has been plenty of examples.  They could \_literally\_ take one of the premade overviews that everyone links and make it the default, and it would be 100x better than what we have.  At least it would be usable.
---
The cyno changes plus bringing local back basically killed my gameplay. I was hunting supers with an active hunter (cyno tengu, to be specific). Managed to grab 8 rorqs and a nyx in the last weekend of the blackout, but now it's all over. Back to the same super safe krabbing as before, where you have to use a cloaky camper to avoid everyone docking up while you're still 10 jumps out.
---
I keep my main subbed for hanging out and helping my friends that I've been flying with for the last few years. Otherwise I could care less.
---
Especially when they think "NPE" means "first 30 minutes of the game" and they ignore the 15 year old fucking shit that people are dumped into after their shiny remade x20 NPE ends.
---
ill be fighting serpentis rats
---
I host my own game of soggy biscuit.  I'm always the winner.
---
Think of cloaking as bandits hiding in the desert outside your walled fortress.  
---
You're all safe and warm, you have fat sweaty girls to fondle and slim sexy pigs roasting on spits.  You have wine and music and probably some juggling fools to throw cups at for a laugh.
---
The bandits only have sand to build castles out of and scorpions to fondle, there is no wine or sexy pig... 
---
Don't be mean.
---
So people can’t get me when I’m traveling or waiting for a target.
---
But if you tell me where you are I’ll park a cloaked alt in your system all day.
---
I’m down to clown.
---
&gt;to be specific The Russians paid our little 900 guys to plow into the soft meat of the vassal states
---
Why does this statement make my pants feel funny?
---
If you’re getting more isk mining than doing explo, you’re doing explo wrong.
---
Thanks CCP
---
NOPE
---
* Go to 0.0 space (null/Wormhole)
---
* Find pirate relic/data site
---
* Hack the four cans
---
* Walk away with \~20-30k in loot
---
That's a normal explo for me.  Consistently less than 50k/site, with Data sites being a bit better than Relic.
---
No you're breathtaking
---
Maybe they'll announce tiericide
---
Loot all the cans or blow them up. Else I'll log in for once and hunt you
---
Won't be long before the grid is filled with titans and supers and we destroy it
---
Get a cargo scanner and stop wasting your time on shit cans. Maybe find better space to run in, too - I don’t remember the last time I ran an explo site that was THAT bad. It’s no get rich quick scheme, but 100m is normal for an hour of low-effort explo. 
---
Also, if you’re in friendly space, intentionally fail the shit cans so the site goes away. If you aren’t in friendly space...fuck ‘em. Let the local idiots pick up the carbon.
---
Watched it get reinforced. You guys are so skilled :thumbs up:
---
Literally every can is a shit can.  Fresh sites in C2/C3 space that just spawned have less money in them than either huffing the gas in the hole or shooting sleepers for blue.
---
100m/hr is absolutely outlandish for explo, in my opinion.  I've never found the string of god cans that people claim to find every single time they go out, since the most I've ever had in a single can is maybe a couple million in salvage, but I can count the amount of times that's happened on one hand.
---
[1420.] Is always going to be a personal +5 for me.
---
If you're dead in the game and you don't know what to do next, maybe give Sig Cartel a shot? They're always online and active in some capacity, bursting with knowledge and activities for you to do. If you can keep your finger off the trigger you might just have a fantastic time in Signal Cartel.
---
Are you trying to say that literally anyone wouldn't do the same thing?
---
Why would you not throw everything you have at a large enemy structure in your space?
---
I’m gonna get downvotes for this but I’ve been running relics for 5 years and I know what I’m doing. The people who tell you to loot everything  are the poor guys who get stuck with empty cans you leave behind.
---
Keep doing it. It slows down and frustrates other relic runners. Despite what they tell you, it *is* a competition and the harder you make it for them the more likely you (1) slow them down or (2) make them quit. It also saves YOU a ton of time so you make more isk/h. People hate it - but leaving behind cherry picked cans is good for *you* and that is all that matters. If you want to maximize your profit, don’t worry about other people.
---
Cargo scanning is by far the fastest way to make money - and yes, it fucks over all the other relic runners (hence they’ll always tell you not to do it).
---
If you don’t force the site to despawn for them, you’re an asshole. That’s fine. Be an asshole. You don’t owe anything to your competitors. You’ll make more and your competition will get mad and quit.
---
P.s. The people telling you that you’re fucking over yourself as well are 200% *wrong.* If the sites are still there by the time you get back you’re not covering enough ground.
---
then everyone clapped
---
Joke's on you, I can't even fly capitals.  I've been winning EVE for a few years now (Lack of time due to work, disagreement with structure proliferation, disagreement with fozziesov) but when I did explo the numbers were consistently so bad that in a week of doing local wormholes (20-30 sites a day) I did three veldspar runs with a Retriever and actually made *more*.  So I decided to just skip the sites altogether and cherrypick ABC from wormholes, before moving towards Blue.  Just before I finally stopped completely I was putting in serious thought of just taking over a C1/C2 and doing sites with a Svipul/Myrmadon but felt that doing it alone would be boring and no fun at all.  Nullsec was kind of out of the picture (Again, lack of time means no ability to go on OPs) and none of my friends really play due to either lack of interest or lack of attention.
---
&gt;That's because you don't know shit about how it works.
---
Lmao
---
&gt;From your perspective they decloak, cyno goes up, and you die. From their perspective they have to get a cyno into system, either dscan you in seconds or wait hours until you feel "safe" enough to rat again,
---
That's not how it works though. Cloaked camper alt hides near a belt/anom or someone safelogs in system and warps to a belt/anom, or there is an alt of a Hunter in corp, things like that.
---
&gt;Once the target -- you -- is dead they then have to coordinate extraction without getting their bridger killed, which is not easy if the people in fleet aren't experienced hotdroppers.
---
Wormholes are also a thing, surprise Kiki gangs aren't easy to deal with.
---
&gt;Kill the cyno on a gate before it gets to you;
---
Assuming it's gating in, and not a camper/safelog that is a possibility.
---
&gt;Kill it when it decloaks to get tackle;
---
In my experience, cloakys generally attack things that won't volley them off the map, and bring numbers for things that can. Cyno changes have made things harder, but before it was less difficult to just cyno in your mates if ratting ship 738383 actually fights back.
---
&gt;3. Have your own recon cloaked up to counter drop them;
---
This is only a thing in the past month. Before you could just have a anything
---
&gt;Use combat probes to catch the bridger on extraction (this will really fuck up their day, that ship is 2-4bil).
---
Easier said than done also.
---
Roaming in a cloaked t3C/ a gang of them in the blackout wiping out industrials and subcap ratters was absolutely the most risk averse, no counter playstyle imo. Nothing would get on grid before the target was killed. It was OP.
---
I probably should apply to signal cartel...
---
Using a sledge hammer to drive a thumb tack is not fun. Large bloc alliances are what's slowly making this game so utterly boring.
---
I own a c1 wormhole and run a mining Corp.
---
 You, sir, are an idiot or a liar. 
---
 10 million isk is a bad pirate site. You're either getting already mined sites or are incredibly bad at exploration. 
---
One of my characters can make ~30 mil per hour in a exhumer using faction drones and orca support on a wh moon mine, before refining and industry. 
---
You can make that doing explo, easily, in wh space so long as you put in the effort and have half a clue what you're doing. Even an alpha pilot can.
---
kys
---
If you got +2 standings they become neutral to you and won't attack. If you got +5 standing they will be blue to you and will actively support and rep you.
---
I'm getting freshly spawned sites, in a C2/C3.  A good pirate site has a piece of blue salvage in it and that site usually gets 5-10m. A normal site has maybe four to six pieces of orange salvage and is often worth 20-50k total, if that.  Data sites usually are a bit better with some decryptors netting 20-50k each if you're lucky enough to find a few. 
---
This is all my personal experience, and why I pretty much avoid exploring.  I always ask what people are doing so wildly different, and get the same attitude every time.
---
Its online...online is a good place for it to be
---
Resubbed w/ isk or w/ money?
---
Can someone send me the POS setup that does 5 million HP damage alpha to anything in the game thanks.
---
Yup, annoying other relic runners by cherry picking is worth more than earning isk.
---
BOB is a god of explosions and death. BOB is also a god of kindness and hope.
---
Not farther than last night a streamer made 1b in 3 hours doing explo in NS all on stream so totally legit.
---
I myself do about 200M/h in NS/WH.
---
You are totally doing it wrong.
---
I expect CCP to announce that they have realized that WH have been broken since they were put into the game and they remove them from the game until they can fix all the bugs / exploits.
---
 Large bloc alliances are what's slowly making this game so utterly boring.   
---
LOL, coming from the group that just made the biggest WH donut
---
Flair baited? I'm in V0lta my dude
---
On the subject of Cherry Picking, here is where/when you probably should or shouldn't do it.
---
If you're in an alliance/group it's probably a bad idea to cherry pick your own space or your own wormhole, or wormhole chain etc. since you'll just be fucking over your own guys. Also, if you regularly probe the same space, i.e. you live in Venal, and you login to explore venal everyday, it's a bad idea to cherry pick. Since unfinished sites will clog up your route for tomorrow.
---
You should know how exploration sites respawn, whenever a Data or a Relic site is completed, it respawns somewhere else in that pirate factions space of the same security band, i.e. if you run a nullsec relic in Delve, it will respawn somewhere else in Querious/Delve/Period Basis. If you run a site in lowsec Aridia, it could respawn in any lowsec system in Aridia/Bleak Lands/Genesis/Kador/Khanid or Kor-Azor.
---
This is important to remember, because if you're running a circuit for example from Querious through Delve down to Period Basis, even if you're not part of the locals and got a wormhole down there, you may want to consider not cherry picking because potentially the site you left uncompleted could respawn somewhere else along your current route. You may want to consider full clears for the first half of your route, then on your way out start cherry picking. The Angel Cartel however, literally have 12 regions so the chance of a new site respawning specifically along your route is approximately 4x lower than that of Blood Raiders, so Cherry Picking there all the time is likely better.
---
There are other benefits to cherry picking other than ISK/HR too. Can slow down rival explorers if you notice other players around that you can't take like a Stratios and you're in a Helios as an example. Also can provide more 'noise' in wormholes which makes it take longer for hunters to find your site.
---
Also site note, you don't need to actually complete the hack and take the loot. For harder cans you can just deliberately fail the hack on it to destroy the can.
---
You glued that poor child into this necropolis of mayhem, death and destruction. How could you!
---
i think it might be sample bias, tbh. I've got level 3 sites worth 100m+ in one go.   
---
Sure there are shit sites too, blood raders are shit, angels are semi-shit, but sansha oh man ....
---
You're talking shit. Things have never been that bad.
---
combat recons are immune to dscan and can't light a cyno that is only force recons
---
covert cyno  Can only be fitted on Black Ops, Blockade Runners, Covert Ops, Etana, Prospect, Stealth Bombers and Force Recon Ships, as well as Strategic Cruisers equipped with Covert Reconfiguration Subsystems.
---
&gt; Multiple gates is no worse than multiple wormholes - you can either have multiple people watching them, or you can just watch the ones you think enemies are likely to come through, or you can take the risk. Same as we have to in J space. 
---
they are a 100 time worse than multiple wormholes. Wormholes need scan out and they have limits on them thus can be rolled
---
important, but did you play AFTER the rework or before? a few years back all the sites got changed (does 'loot explosion' ring any bells?). Data is pretty shit now that POS bpc are useless, relic is where its at. some regions just have shit salvage too (local rat type)
---
I'll be getting in super late on Wed, so hopefully Thursday morning I can get some sight seeing in before the events start.

Not to mention you can ping for a roam yourself.

Why would CCP give a fuck if someone self identifies as a nullseccer though? If you spend most of your online time in highsec but consider yourself a nullsec pilot you're still a highsec pilot because that's where you actually play?

It was not a Spectre fleet, it was a Friday YARRRR roam. I have the logs.

You were asked politely to refrain from being juvenile by someone who had the right to do so, and you didn't make a single peep to justify your behaviour. 
---
If you had a problem with it, you should have spoken up, rather than scuttling away in embarrassed silence and then ranting about it on reddit like a twit.
---
Please, grow up.
---
Hey buddy, did you just said boring?
---
Do your heart racing when ratting with a camper nearby? Adrenaline rush when your carrier unaligned when local spiking? Cold sweat when a bubble popped on you?
---
That cant be boring can it?
---
Hello,
---
Does anyone know how the abyss pvp sites are setup?
---
Should we be able to meet people using the same rift meta as we used or can we meet someone doing meta 5 when entering a meta 3 proving site?
---
Can we do tryg PVP using 3 frigates?
---
Thanks!
---
Very clever, well played.
---
It isn't redundant.  There are a small number of people with 100+ character skill farms (or there were before the economics of it started failing).   For 99.95% of people life is too short to set that up.
---
ok stupid question here: if the citadel was freeported, why did n't the nid dock in the first place when it landed ?
---
This

Try a wormhole corp. Even the beans has a campus I think. You cam definitely find content but it means that you need to use your scanner more.
---
low effort shitpost.
---
Don't get an alt unless you NEED an alt.
---
My first alt was created about 1 month after I started Eve.  I consider him 'my shadow', as his job is to make my life easier.  I train him for whatever is needed at the time.
---
My alt started-off hauling ore when I mined, reprocessing it, and salvaging missions.  That lead to fleet boosting.  He also hauls, and is added DPS; he can only use drones, but can pilot anything with drones ... or even excavators and heavy fighters.  He's sort of become a specialized capital pilot, but most of my alts are capital pilots now (I've been around since 02/2009).
---
When I lived in w-space, he was my site salvager, which also required archaeology and hacking.
---
Back in the age of POS, he also trained to rep anything in any ship capable of repping.  Of course he can also control weapons of POS and any Upwell.
---
His jump drive training lead him to be my first Black Ops pilot.
---
Because one can never have enough PI or industry alts, he's also helps with those.
---
I mean, you joined PH. What were you expecting?
---
3 Yo player :
---
main : almost every subcap pvp ship
---
alt : explo/bomb/cyno/trade
---
i don't need more to have fun and make isk.
---
Imagine getting asshurt because someone plays more efficiently than you lmao
---
Goddamm it i knew it. Maybe its time for an intervention
---
I leave them in jita unsubscribed
---
Perfection.
---
Exploding the bad sites meants that the site respawns in the same region  / constellation
---
Imagine getting upset over words on a screen. It's almost as pathetic as policing memes in fleet chat.
---
It's likely not a sound place to invest money and time if you have any intent to garner a sense of accomplishment from.   You'll need to expend hundreds of dollars and twice as many hours to feel competent.  Given the direction that the company has been taking it and what player concerns they've acted on versus ignored, it doesn't seem that the platform will retain the diverse gaming population it once enjoyed.
---
I can see why a highsec player would be upset at the idea of people multiboxing rorqs, but it really isn't that great. Even before all the nerfs, it took hundreds of hours of mining to pay off one rorq alt after injectors and the ship/fit/drones. They really don't make that much money (100m per hour?), and it's even worse now.
---
Ncdock
---
Lol, the top 10% of EVE doesn't need to undock to make isk. People who make their money by mining or ratting are poor, and nowhere near the top 0.1%.
---
I haven't done lvl 4 in ages, but I really liked using a [Vargur](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/4253871/#post4253871).
---
Dive into 20 km range with MWD, siege (and coast), and just shoot everything, regardless of triggers.  A lot easier and faster.
---
Imagine being so upset about getting corrected you go and make a post about a mean FC cracking down on your language.
---
It was a open fleet lead by a FC, that FC can enforce any level of policing they want, in this case they are asking for professionalism in fleet chat
---
To clarify this, if you show up on the Sotiyo/FOB grid you will be attacked by the rats. They are always hostile no matter what.   
---
The roaming rats that spawn outside the Sotiyo grid will be blue to you and will leave you alone.
---
You missed the point. 
---
This isn't about characters. It's about _players_. Regardless of which of their characters they log in on.
---
CCP do work to join them together.
---
if not for the blackout we´d have reached the same numbers within the next 6 months.
---
did anyone already told you you scream like a girl?
---
Ccplz add Exotic Dancer, Fedo to the loot table of dark blood drops
---
The trick is after you undock, you have to untether
---
Best thing I ever did in EvE was join SC!
---
We don't need this, Hilmar said it don't want to see that anymore in his game
---
ha, so not a real freeport then :d 
---
which leads to my next stupid question: why did the nig warp to it in the first place if it cannot dock ? Stupidity ?
---
[This video shows it quite well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivCEbJ4rfQ)
---
Such is the way of Bob.
---
I can't tell you. it's illegal in all but 3 states.
---
I made my second account before my first toon even had a full million SP because it seemed so obvious to me that it was such a big part of the game. I made 3 more accounts and had 5 by the 6 month mark.
---
The game's a little different now but basically the themes were this:
---
1. General Purpose subcap pilot
---
2. Freighter &gt; JF &gt; Carrier Alt
---
3. Freighter pilot (eventually to fly a JF)
---
4. Logistics (scanning/cynos/hauling)
---
5. Dread Alt
---
There's about 100m SP of subcap skills worth training so number 1 was busy with that for years. The other toons were able to do all of those things I described within a year. Since then I've just been cross training them where possible, e.g. That carrier alt got dread skills too then the dread alt became a titan pilot, the logistics toon got fleet boosting skills and now has mostly the same subcap skills as the subcap main.
---
For really specific toons I started training things on another slot on the account, like a JF pilot only really need 10-12m SP which you can train in 6-8 months so I paused that and trained a super pilot from scratch twice on another slot.
---
The long term goal is to cross train these toons so that you've always got a free hand to juggle whatever needs done. The trap most players fall into is to continuously train into bigger and bigger ships until they're in the amusing situation where they have like 3 or 4 capital pilots and no cyno alts. Don't do that, if your cyno alt on account can do everything it would ever reasonably need to do then just pause it and make another character on the same account.
---
REEEEEE
---
Structures are a problem, wormholes are a problem, warp stabbers are a problem, PvP is a problem, PvE is a problem, Fozzie Sov is a problem, mining is a problem, FW is a problem, the Triglavians are a problem.
---
Are you sure you don’t need a psychological support group because you guys could make a career out of professional whining. If it was an olympic discipline you would fucking hang yourself with the amount of gold medals you’d win.
---
Care to share your fit? Was it a drone fight or do you have a weapon fitted?
---
I'm sorry to disappoint, but reee doesn't offend me.
---
It wasn't me who corrected OP. Carry on ❤️
---
Cap gameplay is a style CCP has made clear they wish to diminish. No point swimming against the tide on that.
---
I'll resub my cap accounts if CCP unfuck them at a later date, but for the time being im having fun with subcap activities which requires less accounts - that's fairly normal for a lot of null players currently, really shouldn't be that unexpected.
---
Hence the reason I separated them out in the first 2 points. I should have been more clear though. Just substitute Force Recons where I just use the word recon and cynos and my point is still valid. And Combat recons for dscan immune ones. Sorry Ill try to be more clear next time.
---
Have to have a personality to lead. OP lacks that.
---
I use them to multibox in a wormhole (used to multibox fw missions).
---
I live out of an Orca. It's thrilling and fun!
---
Certain pirates in low-sec are sort of infamous for occasionally shooting people wo have good standings with them. Never trust anyone, I guess, even a pirate... =\]
---
 Ppl like me will help the stranded guy by just shooting him and afterwards give him feedback on what he can improve to avoid that situation, but New Eden needs good guys like her too.
---
This game would be boring if it only has villains and pirates in Space.

Nice play right there! :D
---
thera scan alt, a hauler/ganker/hi-secwardecer and a null toon in a small alliance is the 3 toons i have on the only alt acc i have subbed right now

but altof frig cyno alts and dread/carrier pilots are unsubbed right now
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/79158654/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79158654/)
---
&gt;I'm wondering what you guys use your alts for.
---
Nothing because they're literally cancer
---
Agree but my point are :         
---
I travel to get to trade hub to buy sell stuff.  ^(because we have jita i need to travel by lowsec and get to higsec)             
---
I check area around to see what can happen. ^(wh are spawning so i need to venture into WH space check what i can expect)            
---
I target nullsec players that i consider enemy.  ^(nullsec people tend to abuse safety of higsec industry so due to mechanics they are vulnerable in other way)        
---
---------------------           
---
So lets to be clear if we had a WH **only** between K and K space ... **i would not venture into WH space**)       
---
If "jita" was a nullsec trade hub that is reachable only by nullsec route - **i would not visit lowsec to light cynos and move my JF**         
---
If enemy logistics could be target able in a way that it was till recently you could do it in higsec - **Why the hell to do it in higsec**        
---
Since CCP removed to ability to target enemy logistic routes in higsec for last 2 weeks the only char that i logged in higsec was 4-4 trader.
---
ha yes, sound. Makes sense xD 
---
And I see you got ahead of my next question :D Thx

little aar / tldr of this fun from the NC pov
---
On 2019.09.28 21:51et i got this ingame notification on my toonie:
---
Ownership of structure "Y-OMTZ - Frostwolf" in Y-OMTZ has been transferred from Affenjungs Inc to Best Friends Forever
---
First, i thought, its just another structure in Malpais... Than i checked it and i was like "dafuq?!" and than "ok lets have some fun".
---
So it was done...
---
I set up a allButGoons access list and had a look who was around to have fun. 
---
Squishy was the first one to come, so he got in the chair. 1 hour after the citadel was transferred, goons had allready reinforced it so we had only a little hope for kills.
---
This nid that you can see in the YT vid took us 50minutes of work. Short, he fell for the "Trading super for carrier" deal. xD
---
This is what also died:

CHERRY PICK 1h before DT...after DT relik is there ,ready to open like flower
---
You are still gimping yourself 🤦🏼‍♂️Running/completing the site you have a change that you have new intact armor plates in the next system.
---
Unique solution... 
---
I wonder if any of you have heard of ships?
---
hence auto targeting missiles got nerfed into oblivion
---
can you use t2 ammo without skills though
---
&gt; but if you are part of the megacoalitions then you are a nullsec player.
---
The problem is with nullsec players using alt accounts to represent themselves as more players than they really are. It's just the loudest voices drowning out everyone else, keeping everyone else from actually being allowed to have their opinion displayed to CCP.
---
Before making statements like "easily verified" you should think things through and research things a bit to see if it's viable. Using the same email doesn't work; different accounts used to **require** different e-mails to be made. Even afterwards, many players have used different e-mails for different accounts. It doesn't work for tying accounts to a player as a result. IP's don't work either; external IP's change, many ISP's do this every 24 hours and i doubt CCP keeps track of every account's previous logged on IP's to link account owners together long term. So people could easily do 4-5 "different player votes" for their own opinion one day, then again the next day, then again the next day, etc. until they've had dozens (or in the case of some SP farms, hundrreds) of times their own voice. Even if only a small number of people took advantage of the loophole, the data would be worthless as a result.
---
&gt;But honestly a system that can qualify me as a higsec players is bad
---
If you know a better solution, i'm sure CCP would love to hear it. Problem is that it has to deal with the actual complex problem, not just a simplified version. Like the voting thing, you state it's easy to verify yet i just could easily point out how both are absolutely nonfunctional in reality. Tracking different accounts to "an individual" (even if anonymous and you only care that it is one person) is very difficult. It's even more difficult if your userbase is tech literate and may have a reason to find and exploit your methods.
---
Just put the Rorq back in the POS where it belongs.
---
minmatar ships look fine, trashbin is no exception  
---
to each their own tho
---
I would say get rid of cov ops cyno on stealth bombers. i mean they are extremely dedicated anti-ship platforms. I totally understand that they should be able to use covops bridges but not really why a normal cyno can only be lit on a recon while covops can still be lit on a frigate like the stealthbomber
---
Pretty sure if you contract it it destroys the name but some of the more avid collectors might know more
---
Way to suck that last little bit of joy out of Eve, guys.
---
Thanks for the note, but I have already checked it. The name won't show in the contract but will appear as female corpse, but as soon it is in your inventory it will be with the original name.
---
You’re not dying properly! Get a ship hull (frig), read it, spend time fitting it yourself, go fight, record your fight, find out what you could have done better/improve on. Unfuck yourself, repeat, several months later, welcome aboard elitist.
---
1 Yes, but you have to go on the eve page and give your steam account an unique accountname 
---
2 yes
---
3i just use my bank card without credit function or paypal or whatever other options are there, mostly depends on your country.
---
Half bots,  half alts. We talk about a mmo with roughly 10k real players. Thats pretty sad to be honest if you take into account how big this game is.
---
Building off this answer, the rat types you should be looking for are Sansha, Guristas, and Serpentis and you should focus on finding their big ticket items. Sansha has the best one (Intact Armor Plates), Guristas is a fairly close second (Enhanced Ward Console), and Serpentis is a clear third (Drone Tranciever). Angel and Blood Raiders sites are garbage - their big ticket items are ~50% of the value of Intact Armor Plates.
---
Perhaps. But then killing the game faster isn't good for players.
---
Is there a bot to add your chars to esi?
---
Can someone from CCP confirm this is real?
---
Glad to hear it :) better safe than sorry with relics
---
u/BasilVulpine nice shot m8
---
Great vid, good work prolonging the fight with your Guardian
---
hey i have a challenge for you. shut the fuck up for a day.
---
&gt; The name won't show in the contract but will appear as female corpse, but as soon it is in your inventory it will be with the original name.
---
oh, that sounds nice
---
*notes scamming opportunity*
---
Oh wow, I was on a role players group shortlist as having stole that body as they had a screenshot of me in scoop range of it but you got it first. Well done.  I got a bit of heat over that lol.
---
If you want rid of it I'll gladly store it for you.
---
No one's gonna tell you where they're running level 5s dude lmao.
---
This is a pretty solid scam. Corpse has a lower case L not an I? Plus hard to confirm with that missing full name.
---
Signal Cartel. &lt;3
---
The only group of people in New Eden that I would never shoot or show any hostility towards.
---
Nice scam attempt, funny that this post is during downtime where Jita local is unavailable.

Eve is fine, find some good people to play with and you'll have plenty of quality time with it!
---
Nice try dear.
---
Use a polarized vargur
---
Only if he is one of the 6 people in the region when it is removed. So, I guess yes..
---
Yeah if you use a rorq then maybe
---
It's Loki now that CCP relegated the Proteus to the dumpster

What is the name of the pilot? I'd like to send the newgal some ISK.

 [https://zkillboard.com/character/95728348/](https://zkillboard.com/character/95728348/)  the one in the event was Jamyl Sarum I. However, seems to be a scam since OP's corpse has a l instead of the upper-case I

It's not like its hard to track them. If i wanted to gank em, I'd be there already.
---
What the F?
---
No weapons. 200mm plate small ancil rep. Drone damage amp, EANM. Scram web. Small Exp pump. We traded drone volleys well. He lost due to not having a plate. Like i said my alt char has like 7mil SP. LOL

Hangovers, food, hangovers more food and yes lots of goonies without their toonies

Why "deeply sorry"?

TLDR: i just wanna cloaky camp and kill VNIs
---
Main Account - Dread/Super and SubCap fun (My main toon), other toons do PI
---
Alt Account - Cyno Alt/HS Incursion Leshak Pilot, other toons do PI
---
Alpha Alt 1 - HS Suicide/LS frig fun
---
Alpha Alt 2 - HS Suicide/LS frig fun
---
I've had to change my Alt account training pattern with the cyno changes.. I like running 2 accounts, but my main char is the best and where I put most of my effort, my alt is utility and extra fun where necessary. Running more than 2 accounts is too much work for my liking.
---
It's player's like you the game needs. People were spouting that garbage back in 2017 when I just started playing too. The game is great and I'm having more fun now than ever.

You are forgetting that for most alliances, blue-fucking is punishable. Cherry picking your own constellations IS blue-fucking. It's hard to prove, but if your directors are given proof, you'll get your ears pinned back for it. Repetitive behavior will raise the penalties. In enemy/neutral space, cherry pick everything.
---
train more cloaky campers
---
Alright I'll poke around at some point soon, I normally avoid busy places in null but you got me feeling cocky.
---
I tried an Eve private server once, and it is the only one I've ever heard of existing. It was awful. The game needs a full time dev team to keep it afloat or it's just shit. So if by chance you ever see one, which I truly doubt. Avoid it. The real thing is better.
---
I've recently been told to go fly frigs in FW systems, but not to join FW. Just go looking for the PVP. I feel that I need to get control of my nerves and this, I am hoping, might help with that..

I guess he tREEggered them?
---
The term "bittervets" implies a sense of prestige. In all reality the phrase "inflexible, unadaptable, unmotivated lurking trolls who just happen to have an account creation date of 1-10 years ago" is a much better description. I refuse to use that term. Fuck em.

You can meet people from any tier of abyss site that can generate a proving conduit to the PvP room. Having said that, pretty much everyone who doesn't accidentally  enter the PvP room comes in through tier 3s as there is less chance of losing their ship or timing out (plus they can get there quicker most of the time).
---
Proving conduits will not spawn in frigate sites, so you can't do Abyssal PvP in frigates.
---
Note: The different levels of Abyssal deadspace are most commonly referred to as 'tiers' or t1-5 as an abbreviation. 'Meta' levels refers to a (partly outdated) way of separating modules of the same type based roughly on performance.
---
Wow thats pretty excellent. Well done!

You come here to type all this bullshit out IN A GOD DAMN SPACE SHIP GAME like this is the US Navy.  Telling someone else to grow up.

THIS IS AN ONLINE SPACESHIP GAME and you're telling someone who is having fun it, to "grow up" and take it MORE seriously.

---
nice exploit
---
Not upset, found it hilarious.  Please post the logs so everyone can see how "unprofessional" "lol i will fight until the end ree" once in local is.  DO IT.  But you won't, because you're a righteous SJW that is super upset you're not in control of your life, or other people in a video game.  You live a sad life and have sad people surrounding you.

We're doing great! Feel free to pay us a visit, anytime. You can find our pilots just about anywhere... :-)
---
Turned them all into Alphas..

this :)
---
Did you try clicking on the Play button?
---
I love AC-Tempests. They only suck when you re up against TDing rats. "Hello, Sanshas..."
---
Honestly then your doing it wrong easy 100m per relic site.
---
Try to switch off 64 bit application, settings icon is right under the Play button.
---
Yea that's 100 opposite.. relics give way more than data.. you have abbad databset try again. Get a t2 analyzer
---
Nice one. Didn't think you guys had any structures left in 03-
---
Hey 10 more of those and you'll be isk positive!
---
I remember the loot explosions, and believe they got rid of it, no?  Now it's just stuff in cans.
---
Bad advise is bad. The only sites you'd want to scan are the ghost sites. Only douche bags and Communists cargo scan other sites.
---
Typhoon fleet issue. Cruise and sentry
---
Good explanation. I couldn't be bothered to type the words
---
Not great, not terrible:)
---
Then go with the MJD fit. Start with plenty of tank and keep replacing tank with DPS until you reach the opint where death is too close.
---
Mission rats never scramble so you can always use MJD to escape (unless it is in cooldown period).
---
I think I fully T2'd my cheetah back when i did this.  Didn't fail any cans but they all had pretty laughable loot.  Even out in 0.0 I was getting loot as bad or worse than highsec sties.
---
What an awesome story! Thanks for sharing it with the community. I'd love to post this up on our SC group blog, if you can reach out to me directly on our forums or in game mail. Fly clever!
---
That's exceedingly rare though.  I've had that happen exactly once for me in the hundreds of sites.
---
Missiles have really nice dps already and the armor tank version can easily fit 3x BCS. More than that won't help much due to stacking penalties.
---
It also needs all the application modules it can get so it can apply well on cruisers and below (especially if you use fury missiles which are great).
---
Most WH corps will be happy to have you as long as you're willing to scan down signatures and keep in communication.  The most important thing in WHs are eyes, since that's how you find targets and keep from becoming one.  Just make sure you can fly cov ops first.
---
Operation hugeroo. Love it.
---
I’ve been running rescues for more than two years and this is our most common method for guiding pilots out. To date, while we have lost rescue ships, it’s never been by someone we fleeted with. Bound to happen eventually but it turns out most pilots being rescued don’t like to blow up their guide.
---
True, but autocannon t2 ammo sucks ass.
---
Im confused. Isnt that a Marco? It tells my computer to execute two commandos at the same time?
---
more like clever use of game mechanics
---
Most players are in a corp or alliance. Tally up where that corp or alliance has most of their structures and you have the classification, works for the majority of the palyerbase
---
It's not 2 commands, it's a modified click. Holding Ctrl doesn't do anything by itself, it just modifies whatever you press next, such as Clicking or pressing F1 or whatever.
---
A macro is a single keypress that starts a series of separate commands. Such as having 1 button which tells your ship to Orbit, Target, Deploy Drones, Engage Drones, and Fire on the ship you're currently selecting. That would be a Macro.
---
I find Wormhole data's alright, I live in a C3 though with some mates. I generally run the sleeper sites and combats in a rattle and leave the cans for my mates to loot up. Got an extra 70 mil on the site the other day, but had a Talocan can spawn that was 50mil of that.

Used to haul for pushx for a short while, very chill yet active people, freighter hauling has the best isk/effort, multibox friendly and if you get bored you can just make more money with a JF or get a 5b contract through the Rancer gate camps for the kicks. Not the best ISK, sure, but at lease you're providing an actual service instead of shooting crosses :)
---
They're preying on us? I thought they were helping us practice safety protocol.
---
...officer mods with good abyssal rolls?
---
I mean, that's the basic answer, but I'm really not sure why you're asking, and I would strongly encourage you \*not\* to do this if you need to ask the question.
---
One stay at amarr, 2nd at jita as traders.  And main.. Thats all in same accout.
---
You do strange things for fun.     
---
Unless you are girl then it is normal
---
What are you trying to do with your Rorquals?
---
*Generally* an active shield tank with a PANIC module is a good start, but it all depends on your circumstances.
---
This is why I love EvE so much.
---
If I'm in a random wormhole would Cartel actually be able to rescue me ? They can't possibly find holes everywhere
---
Offtopic but why is Telegram now preferred over WhatsApp?
---
I love that Signal Cartel braves the most dangerous spaces, that they do so in peace, and that when they do get shot they don't cry about it. They know it's a part of the game and move on.
---
In an age of risk averse everything, these guys quietly are out there helping keep the sandbox alive.
---
It is indeed, hope all is well for you too!
---
Did you check in the audio settings in-game if the sound effect was enable ?
---
The trouble with this flag is that it has a cross on it. Which historically speaking is a reference to the countries christian heritage. Most countries that have abdicated their kings have adopted the tri-color/colour(however you want to spell it).
---
SC sounds like my kinda corp. I've been playing off/on for the best part of 2 years and not found a corp as suited to me as this sounds!
---
https://youtu.be/Bfe4TxvUOiw?t=28
---
Nothing, all alts and main unsubbed for the past 6+ months...
---
ye 100% pvp guy is botter. kek
---
keep us updated  
---
p.s fuck chinnese botters
---
Also you could create your own corp, and have corp shared station hold.
---
It's allowed as long as you the human are pressing the button combo to initiate an action.
---
If you then set up a cycling macro to repeat those key presses automatically then it would be bannable.
---
xD :D

[Eve is fine](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/05/us/05onfire1_xp/05onfire1_xp-superJumbo-v2.jpg)
---
[Eve is ~~fine~~](https://fsmedia.imgix.net/6f/fd/68/f5/211b/43dd/bc62/ce9278275c82/this-is-fine.png) on a very steady downward slope for the past 5-6 months, so it's not in a good place right now, but that's not going to stop you from playing it anyway, so why bother asking if you made up your mind already...
---
why dont they make it burn fuel like everything else? The clloak cycles like other's so why not make it burn fuel so nobody can throw a 1 day alt with lvl 1 cloak into a system.
---
A single Rorqual is not worth it if you're just looking for ROI. The ship will make you \~100m/hr and costs billions. The main thing for Rorquals is that you can do Rorqual*s* *plural*. It's already been nerfed, but I think people are still using them, so either it's not too late or there's a lot of sunk cost fallacy going around.
---
I'll forever be a proud member of SC
---
no no, its still school start time! All the EVE players have to go back to school now, thatswhy playercount is low!!!11
---
aaaaaaaaaaaahahaahha
---
This. Back then we also still had several powerblocks who were fighting for sov. Today its just the imperium. No more real wars. No more stories about huge fights, betrayals, spying, etc that make into general gaming news.
---
Our members roam Anoikis daily. To replace caches, so hack cans or just to travel. This results in an awesome coverage of J-Space =) While we cant guarantee a time frame it usually [only takes a few days](https://evescoutrescue.com/home/)
---
Okay. I got it. When I'm on it's from 1600 to 2000 or so, EVE time.
---
I haven't. After all this post though I'm going to give it a try
---
Because ratting without risk isn't boring?
---
Signal Carter sounds like the most wholesome group on Eve.  Much respect.
---
How can I stop getting blown up? As a returning player I'm re-learning the game, but I'm to the point of venturing out of high sec. Whenever I try to do something, someone decloaks with a warp scrambler and I'm dead. I have a DSL connection (yay rural life) so half the time my game will freeze and I'm one shot from death before I can see I was targeted. Is there a module that can stop the warp scrambler from working? How can I make more money efficiently to make up for my now 5 blown up ships?
---
The Guardian was a nice and unexpected touch.
---
CCP still hasn't removed them? Wow. I showed EVE to my friend a few months ago, he got randomly killed in hs after I told him it was safe. Shitty mechanic, doesn't have a real purpose.
---
Oh, is EVE dying again? I enjoyed watching the last 10 times it died, it was fun. Maybe I should start playing again so I can witness the 11th death personally and get some shit piled up to prepare for the upcoming 12th death of EVE.
---
Hmm that texture seamin the neck, so hot.
---
rr have much gila mission bots in n5y. and try to make all control for botting
---
We’re doing great and our friends in Thera just like to keep us on our toes. :)
---
Perhaps someone above is looking out for you.
---
Are you sure its pirate faction based rather then region based? When i used to live in Tenal i bmed everything and i could run explo all day long almost on my own. And whenever i finished one side of region, i could always be sure there would be new sites in other part of region.
---
you mad bro
---
understood... yeah totally differen't prime time for me.. you must be eU ?
---
You maybe went to soon to nullsec. Forget WH is too spensive for a new player.
---
This game has a lot of facets, try them before give up.
---
I suggest you doing small scale pvp in low sec, FW space. Totally different to null sec fleets, where you almost anchor and hit F1.
---
Find a pvp oriented corp, they will teach you. 
---
You'll learn 1 vs 1 in cheap ships and small gangs. Which is very grateful activity. You'll have also big combats when the systems switches of faction.
---
Factional will fund your looses easily.
---
Expect to loose a bunch of ships before killing something yourself. Once you did it, most os us got addicted for years to this game. Be patient each lost ship is something you learn.
---
In this places even your enemy will give you advice if you ask them. The pvp comunity is very friendly here.
---
Nope. I'm in the US but this puts me squarely in between groups logging out and logging in. Mostly EU and some times I log in when I get home from work and I meet some small groups of Australians logging in as I'm getting ready to log out. Basically, I end up being a solo pilot even when I'm in a corp because I'm the only one there. That's also why I need a larger corp since there is a chance other corp members will log in some days.
---
Once I finish my 1.5 degrees next Spring I'll probably go full neckbeard on it. I already stopped out of college once, so I need to stay focused this time until I'm done. That said, I've already gotten back into my childhood hobby of Warhammer painting. Eve and Everquest must be next 🤣
---
I haven't even played in like 6 years lol. I have been quite reclusive while finishing my degree though. My gaming these days revolves around Rocket League and Sea of Thieves mostly
---
From my recent experience it seems that corp level activity is also on a prime hours system. If you're not on during those hours then you still end up being a solo pilot. Might as well be in an NPC corp when that happens. Just as little activity without the hassle of a useless wardec. I can't tell you just how disappointing that was to discover.
---
With the amount of ISK you can make doing L4s and 5s (who the heck is sharing L5s with other people anyway? Your alpha isn't soloing that) you can easily PLEX your account and actually contribute to the game instead of being a freeloader.
---
I've found Amarr space to be the least profitable space, for the work.  The rats are too tanky and do a ton of damage as a shield based pilot, and the loot is usually worthless.
---
Though in wormhole space, you get all sites.  And they're all pretty consistently bad.
---
I'm US west coast but on in the mornings. There's even less to do. I'm actually jealous of your evening hours.
---
CCP fozzie needs to rethink his stance on the cyno jammers drastically, being so opposed to changing them is wrong and he is frankly wrong about them in general.
---
not alliance public fleets, just npsi fleets
---
If that's what you want to believe lol.
---
I'm talking ANY fleets
---
&lt;10: Roll Backs and Cynos and Minutes Oh My!
---
The crew talks about a recent CCP Rise attended meetup in Portland, Blackout roll back, Cyno changes and useful alts in small gang.
---
This episode is sponsored by THE AESIR. They are a c2/null c5 corp that recently returned to EVE. With a Tight core of players going back 9 years they are offering great smallgang opportunity. If you have an interest in small gang and a bit of experience with small scale pvp, The Aesir wants you. Join “nullstatic” channel in game to get in touch.

Wait, what? What rats? Why does it matter if you’re a shield based pilot? There should be 0 rats in explo sites and the value of the loot doesn’t depend on what kind of ships you fly
---
I mean living there in general; the sites were laughable, and ratting (belt or anom) was difficult since I'd get shredded in two or three shots from frigates.
---
Besides, there's nothing of value down in that region anyways.  What's there, Provi and Stain?
---
if you reprocess multiple kinds of ore at once it probably lumps them together
---
This is true. I tried one of these "newbie" corps. It was no different than being in an NPC corp. Sadly, a complete waste of time.
---
r/evejobs is probably the most active recruitment tool right now. I would say that most corps do zero advertising at all though, so it's very hard to find one that works for you. You can't join something that's hiding itself.
---
&gt; EVE is a good place
---
Lol, bullshit, which part is in a good place?
---
Ncie
---
What ship were you trying to rat in? And did you ever do actual exploration in that area?
---
Because it sounds like you have 0 idea what you’re talking about
---
My usual ratting ship; a Sleipnir. Speed tank, Arty fit.  Even with EM/Therm resistances on, I'd get melted.
---
And I Think I did do explo, and the loot was pretty awful.  Though this was back when it was still lootbombs, not just popping a can and seeing what's inside.  Even after that change, the loot's never been good enough to pay for my time when I could do belt ratting in lowsec, or mining veldspar/omber.
---
Yeah. I have the exact same settings on my desktop, the sound works there but not my laptop
---
Signal Cartel is cool. We don't blue them, but most of us in Catch/Impass won't go out of our way to shoot them
---
Yeah theyve tried to kill my burner pullers.
---
I hit a data site the other day that had 2 27m cans and a few 8m ones. Unfortunately I lost one 27m to hitting restoration nodes 3 in a row (God I fucking hate restoration nodes).
---
Ugh, and not really anything on getting supers and Titans to die more, very not cool.
---
Yeah it's definitely important to find a corp in your timezone or that otherwise is online at around the same time as you.
---
That it is, my dude. That it is.
---
This is 100% a macro.
---
One button is performing two actions - that's a macro.
---
He could just define Lock Target to that extra mouse button in game, which would not be a macro.
---
But programming a button to mimic holding control AND clicking is the literal definition of a macro.  One input is responsible for multiple actions.
---
There’s no way he did it with money. Another useless 21 accounts.
---
One account. Main do stuff, then I have a builder and a Jita alt for buying and selling.
---
just remove alpha clones 
---
the idea to let players try eve again after a break was okey but now most alpha clones are bots or ppl that just want to leech isk /ships from ppl in corp
---
You can have fun talks with yourself in local... Not saying its worth any ISK, but it can irritate or entertain others in local ;)
---
Oh you poor poor soul. Get into an Astero and do relic sites... That's what they're taking about
---
I hope you land in a bubble.
---
I use a Cheetah for those; used to be fully T2'd when I was Omega.  Still more profitable to do blue in a C1 with a Svipul, strangely.
---

---
Squishy Round 2
---
They still exist for some godforsaken reason though.
---
You're misinterpreting what he is saying. In eve ctrl+leftclick = target... You know that is what he meant. Stop being so pedantic. Its fuckin irritating
---
TLDR: I just want to krab with 0 risk.
---
Then he should just bind target.
---
Look, just because your alliance openly supports botting doesn't mean it's not against the EULA.
---
r/evejobs
---
Post in r/evejobs but add some details like sp and what you like to do etc
---
Sit in Frat fleets, identify targets for ganks, laugh as they loose billions a day.  Copy salt to my "Tears of Eve" document.
---
Lol.  Absolutely this.  
---
‘Now you may clap for us’
---
They did learn (or hopefully should have learned) a few things though.  
---
They could not give away enough free SP to actually keep a large number of people from leaving the game.  
---
Telling a good chunk of your fricking player base to ‘HTFU’ is not a substitute for discussion about and messaging of big changes.  
---
People will leave the game if you totally turn of a basic gameplay and that their really is no 1000s of people ready to take their place.
---
If you're short on probes, or have no gear fitted but can refit, we have scanning supplies cached throughout wormhole space, usually 70-80% last few months.
---
Like everything else we do, service is free to all, no strings attached.
---
My alts:
---
1. Sits in Jita, very rarely undocks and even then it's usually only to perimeter then back.
---
2. Leftover mostly drained Indy alt. Still has some hauling and Indy skills on it and minor mining just when I feel like doing an event or something, or process BPCs into better selling ones.
---
3. My ex-main. PvP oriented, used to be ns toon. Now just mostly vegetates parked in LS.
---
4. Logi and salvage alt, can help in PvP or pve in combat too, but combat ships and skills no where near maxxed out.
---
I should add, other then my Jita alt rest of them are mostly inactive, I activate and use one here and there with Plex once in a while, maybe 2-3 times a year for the rare times I feel like dual boxing. I kinda hate doing it, it cheapens the game a lot but unfortunately in this game sometimes just don't have a choice.
---
https://signalcartel.com/join-us
---
Let me just press a button to let my 40 myrms rat till downtime and warp off when neuts show up in local.      
---
Logic minmaxing can create some interesting results, so CCP doesn't give a clear cut rule. Otherwise people will dance around the line and take dumps on it.
---
alts are cheap once you train them to whatever you need them for.  after extracting, it only costs a few hundred M isk to sub.
---
Makes it sound more realistic when he's trying to scam people with a fake body.
---
Hell his character's name is rip empress (You can see it on the Impairor) so unless he magically knew she was gonna die before he created the char its pure bullshit.
---
Even if the game were at its prime, there is a 95% chance you're going to leave. And the game is not at its prime. Enjoy!
---
Fake, L instead of an I at the end of the bodies name and the char is called rip empress. Unless he is fucking psychic he's full of shit.
---
The longer this goes on the more confused I get. Why would you ever rat in a sleipnir? Why were you unable to tank forsaken hubs/havens in a sleipnir? And currently, explo in Sansha’s space is about 100-150 mil/hr
---
This alreafy exists in game. Look in the top left below the name of the system you are in.
---
right on, thanks for the heads up!
---
I was unable to tank Havens in a Sleipnir since I'd get hit twice and I'm already bleeding armor. At range.  The rats did so much damage compared to literally every other rat in the game.
---
Addendum edit: I was also told that "to do Drone Hordes (in Cobalt Edge) I needed to be double boxing Machariels or using a carrier, otherwise I would be doing them so slowly I'll be getting 10m/hr and would be better off doing Hubs." and they would do them at 100-150km with Sniper Battleships.  I would kite the enemies around the area while brawling at close range in a Sleipnir with AB always on, and my shields would never drop below half.  20-40m ticks easy.
---
End of the night, think to yourself "just one more wormhole." Scan one down, splash the hole, collapses behind you. NBD, safe log and scan out tomorrow.
---
A voice calls out to you from your speakers: "Captain, there is an active Rescue Request for this system. Please check my console for more details." Allison. You update my chain in Tripwire, and inside of 20 minutes there's three other pilots scanning other routes out. Pings fly out on Discord, and inside of an hour you're escorting out a Nidhoggur out into NPC Lowsec.
---
All in a 12m ISK frigate.
---
EVE doesn't have to be expensive, and fits can get way more creative when you don't care about guns.
---
Where can I contact you? I have a good home inmind for you if you'd be interested.
---
Oh dear God stop! The Ideas can only get worse for so long before i start cutting myself.
---
pretty good! you should come hang out on the /r/eve discord
---
Just typing up my info on eve jobs but my mains name IG is Capt Murphy, we can start there! Looking forward to our chat!
---
No, one button = one action is the rule, you can use macros but not if they combine multiple actions.
---
He isn't.  He's using a modifying key like control, alt, or shift to bind an action to the button combo.
---
Ph is used to re/introducing people to eve, with lots of veteran corps as well even the most mature players will find a home in pandemic horde.
---
It also helps we are easily the most active and content rich alliance in PamFam.
---
Rodman in Space
---
They... do have a clear cut rule stipulated many places on ther forums and in their TOS.   If you automate any part of the game that is a net benefit to your player while you have no other input than to start the automation, it is against TOS, and bannable pending an investigation.
---
Yes I get that, that's where it gets blurry. If you're just using the macro to bind your mouse button to a key combination that will perform one action that'll be fine. If you were binding it so that it performed multiple actions in game simultaneously then it's not. 
---
Lots of misinformation in here as macros are not an issue unless used to perform multiple actions or to repeat without more input.
---
You... just defined a clear cut and not blurry line.  Seems like you get it just fine.
---
hey, I just woke up when I posted. Can't think of everything :d
---
Did it ever occur to you to use a VNI like a normal person?
---
I considered it but I didn't have the drone skills, and this was well before the age of injectors.  Besides, I'm probably closer to capitals than a kitted VNI, and the only reason why I even have Gallente/Caldari BC5 is because I had BC5 before the split and Gallente/Caldari Cruiser/BS skills.
---
Pandemic horde is a open corp, find:
---
"Pandemic Horde Inc" in game and hit apply it will be accepted when a recruiter is online normally within a few hours.
---
In the mean time we live in R10- in TKE. But please do not enter enter our null sec till you accept the invite to join. Standing fleet lives in LXQ and it will end baddly for any one jumping in not ready for a fight 😀
---
I doubt your rig is strong enough to kill two Commandos at once.
---
That's only 14 rorqs. At least do 15 jesus got to keep it to round numbers dude.
---
Swackle!
---
Since no one seems to see this, and i do not bother to look into this social media stuff, ok :(
---
Just good bye.
---
What Corp do I contact to get the lowdown on getting local in wh's cause I hear y'all have had it all along
---
Have you ever met any of the "elite PvP krab hunters" ?
---
They're not interested in fair or having balls.  Mostly just easy kills. 
---
But seriously, no.  This is a bad idea, a bad thread and you're a bad poster.  
---
Please stop posting.   Thanks.
---
I was able to find your recruitment channel in-game, many thanks!
---
They also dont give a fuck about highsec incursions... ever since they reduced them down to 1 spawn they have been declining
---
Did you read the post?
---
Always impressed. Hope to see you again soon and bring a proper fight this time :)
---
GSF openly supports botting? Not last I checked.
---
I'll trade you cap drain on cloaks if mining drones drain cap with no recharge. Deal?
---
If someone could quantify 2017 salt vs 2019 salt, I know which I'd bet isk on being saltier.
---
I'd be happy with this and going back to a free trail but say 28 days
---
This.
---
The saltlords who tell you to steer clear are partly correct and partly not. Don't start eve now planning to enjoy it and grow with it for another 5 years. But eve isn't devoid of fun by any stretch currently or in the near future.
---
The CCP fanbois who say "hurdur eve was dying in [insert year before present year] too but here we all are still" and "r/eve is just a vocal minority of bitter vets who don't even play anymore" are partly correct and partly not. Eve IS still here and there ARE quite a few negative nancys on r/eve. But CCP is also cutting staff, cutting events, not honoring promises about development, continuing to build on their track record of failed non-eve ventures, and being bought out by an eastern p2w game company.
---
Sooooo...
---
Yeah, there's fun to be had today and tomorrow. But there was more to be had yesterday and the day before. And this trend seems to be continuing or even accelerating, on the whole.
---
Just looking for the perf fit setup for each ship and just want it to be bling as possible :)
---
Tonight it's up 3k from blackout. Clearly not.
---
Still not as ugly as a character in the Oblivion character creator.
---
That's an hour long. Could you be more specific ?
---
Goons going to clean out WH space...tldr
---
why

---
&gt;a long recording
---
nah
---
Sad day
---
Are you getting bent out of shape over something boat said?
---
as someone who jumped into WH-space at around the same skillpoint amount, can't really recommend WH-space at this point to you, because you will find the gameplay annoying and slow without lvl 5 scanning/hacking skills and all the alts that you need to do things independently when most of your corp-mates are offline. That said, most WH-corps, no matter the size, are tight-knit and you will find good friends for years to come, as everybody shares the risk and responsibility of keeping and maintaining the home hole and structures in it. Most successful new players in WH-space that i have met, have started out with EVE uni, so maybe that would be a good place to start if you're considering WH-space?
---
i think it's amusing how the rhetoric goes...Goons must be bored in Kspace.  Looking forward to how this new set of targets will go...will make things exciting.  I was opining on the "vastness" of the Mitanni's dollar empire &amp; how bent out of shape he seems to be on WH's...and how wrong many of the WH statements were tbh
---
ExookiZ went full Tekashi 6ix9ine on wormholes
---
Thanks for the tldr kind sir.
---
Ya know, I'm normally pretty antigoon, but good for them if they plan on trying to nuke WHers out of existence. WHers love chaos and all that shit anyways right?
---
Oh damn! I'm there buddy...that sounds fun
---
learn to count?
---
That happened to me and I’m on MAC. I have to switch off the 64 bit in the launcher window. It default as such every time you log in.
---
You are wrong dude, just admit it, learn and move on.
---
Have you ever shitposted so hard that you made a coalition deploy?
---
I'm not in a place to log in and double check, so im going from memory when i say double click usually aligns/approaches  you rather than target anything by default.      
---
It's a thing i do without thinking usually, so i might actually be wrong. But i don't think i am.
---
Now you know the reason he got kicked from imperium...
---
*Sad HK noises.*
---
Hope you got Theran to pay up, they paid 400+ bn for Fade.
---
Man those are some sharp blades [of grass].
---
Mine it in npc alts
---
It could have easily been a holding character made after the fact.
---
The pixel thing is the giveaway
---
The other day one of their JF pilots used our public beacon and donated a few billion to our fuel bill, so I guess that kinda counts?
---
If it stops dumb krabs from claiming w-space is safe im all for it
---
Considering the sponsor's nickname is little rabbit , I think the RR alliance can change their name to rabbit regiment and their logo to a snow white rabbit instead of the dragon 🤣
---
I quite enjoy the hurfing. Most people know Mittens is whipping up the crowd so we'd be more motivated to join "burn wormhole" fleets, and TBH I think there's a lot of people who would be down with that even without the hurfing. Wormholes is the one place where goons haven't been to in large numbers and there's a betting pool of how many fleets we welp to WH mechanics before a major eviction. Init has their methodology down, the question how to do it faster, with a few days of prep rather than months.
---
INN gives me cancer, what did Exo say?
---
Looking forward to seeing this..also, how to do it? numbers helps.  Mass does not.
---
What...?
---
Nah man. I like fighting and being in wars but while multi boxing with my alts.... 
---
Look dude im like two bowls deep right now. 
---
I have a main char and then I made an entity filled with my alts that feels like it’s a main char. Like the Corp is the character. Whoa... 
---
I like playing eve as a squad..: it’s like an rpg in continuous turned based mode. 
---
Holy shit.:. This is a play style.... whoa
---
Edit: Like fallout tactics. I miss that game
---
The return of the Memettanni
---
all for more NS activity in WH's...
---
The sponsor of AOM , AKA little rabbit , invested tremendous amount of isk to Ranger Regiment. Then the former CEO of RR declared that the little rabbit has become the new CEO of RR alliance now.
---
Init did their's with Stukas, no reason for things to be different. Will probably see more Kikimoras as the prices for those things have dropped quite a bit. The bigger issue is the logistics of supplying the staging C4's.
---
My alt is a capital alt, with some industry trained. Or sometimes he flies a sebo griffin and my main in a stiletto to instalock
---
There is no perfect.
---
The difference between a 1 bil cruiser and a 100 bil cruiser is going to be 10-20% stronger. So that means 1 extra t1 fitted cruiser would tip the scales if it was on the opposing team.
---
Yeah, looking at my post it seems my mind confused the overview with the UI in general.
---
will be good to find lots of Goons rollers that have rolled themselves out when the new mechanics get deployed...
---
yeah 28 days sounds like a nice nr, gives noobs a time to try the game
---
Dare I ask for a link?
---
Sounds about right.  I would definitely not be doing this just to plex accounts.  Is worthwhile to do with accounts that are already plexed 
---
Also working as intended from CCP's point of view I think - not worth it to have accounts if all you do is PI in this manner (note there are guys with factory planets that make more ISK, but more intensive).
---
Can I have some of your salt for my popcorn?
---
Done worse tbh ¯\\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
---
this is why no one who understood wormholes wanted exooki on the csm and were very worried when he got bloc voted in anyways
---
the information he supposedly gave these people on the csm based on what was said in this vod is so wrong and clearly exemplifies that either he:
---
- doesn't actually know what he's talking about
---
or 
---
- wants to get wormholes gutted by ccp because of personal relationships his corp has against the groups in the space with more power than him
---
either way goons have a dude in power who told them what they wanted to hear and are gonna run with it all the way home because they have nothing better to do at this point 
---
dead game

TIL there's a flag-designing subreddit. They've got some sweet concepts there! Hilarious ones too, like [the flag of Flanders with Ned Flanders](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/day3j4/flag_of_flanders_with_ned_flanders/). :D
---
I don't doubt that a lot of higgs battleships will die trying to roll holes because people can't count.
---
And how many Rorquals will die while the usual response fleet is busy rolling holes.
---
harpy/bomber/kiki/boosher swarm should work

Your mom.
---
But seriously, from hauling to tackle.
---
ain't no sodium there compadre...I'm looking forward to all of this...Goons being paid by CCP for more chaos...and likely it's only INIT who can pull this off anyway
---
&gt; the information he supposedly gave these people on the csm based on what was said in this vod is so wrong
---
then please, set the record straight. what did he say that was wrong, and how does it really work?
---
so i'll just leave my skill farming alts docked in TTT.
---
this changes absolutely nothing.
---
A macro is sequential resulting in multiple in-game acts. This is combinational resulting in one act.
---
It's all in the CSM minutes plus some extra bits that he shared with the csm. Even if you don't like INN it's worth watching just to see the range of cartoon expressions on Mittanis face, it's pretty funny. Starts at 12:45
---
Please make a public fund campaign I will personally donate 10bil for the great cause of evicting all those smug wormholers.
---
3 easy steps to fix skill extraction:
---
1. Delete skill extractors
---
2. Delete skill injectors
---
3. There is no 3
---
But how many Rorquals will die trying to roll holes.
---
Guys i'm on the other side of the hole, gonna panic, oh shit can't panic.
---
Nothing we havent already been complaining about for years. 
---
Also dbrb gets tons of facts wrong and runs with it. 10/10 will watch again when bored
---
4. Just stop playing.
---
Seems to be a popular one as of late.
---
10b? that's it? Start krabbing in a C6 make real isk, actually probably for you a C2 first.
---
join theta, light cyn..oh
---
This is bait.
---
I wish it was bait. I'm being 100% honest.
---
Robot regiment sounds better because that's what they are.
---
the end was intense! thank you for the awesome content
---
Same, It's an unwritten space law.
---
Bit implants when?
---
not gonna come into a thread of goons and fact check or argue, just wanted to share my opinion on how this vod makes it sound like wormholes are being represented in the csm
---
**either that or he's fine at it's all big spin
---
I like this.
---
Didn't they already evict the largest wh alliance just for lolz?
---
Rip HK
---
"evict"...HK is back in Rage and was not long after the "eviction"
---
I don’t have the logs because I wasn’t there.
---
I don’t think telling someone to stop something annoying makes one a SJW, not that encouraging to be nice is a bad thing.
---
The only one not in control of something right now is you, getting mad and throwing insults, going WAY outside the game.
---
Chill, and be glad if you don’t get excluded from future NPSI fleets.
---
I went afk for a few months, came back and found out my 100m sp character got perma killed?
---
How about permanently remove your reddit account if one of your posts dropping below   0 vote?
---
I'm pretty sure that will make shitposting interactive and less cancerous
---
&gt; Wormholes is the one place where goons haven't been to in large numbers
---
free Hole Squad, we dindu nuffin
---
lol
---
So RR will be the pet of the pet of TEST?
---
See, this exact attitude is why you guys deserve to be exterminated.
---
If he was so wrong, can you enlighten us as to the truth? Would love to know the truth about wormholes and whether what exookie said was correct or not.
---
&gt; Even if you don't like INN it's worth watching
---
doubt
---
@mods can we start banning people that make "HERE'S MY SIMPLE SHITTY WAY TO FIX X"
---
You are talking as if you are actively doing it but telling us in your other comment that you haven't played in years. 
---
Your information are just false, getting 20 to 30m per site is pretty common, making 100m+ per hour not unusual.
---
lol exterminated
---
double click is align not target lock by default
---
It is mentioned that wormholes have "super local" with the probe scanner.
---
It's true that incoming wormholes show up as a signature and you know someone just jumped into you if it formed a new connection. But you don't know who they are or how many ships come in without real local. You also can't see if a spy is cloaked up watching you who is camping in your hole. Exooki himself had hostile dreads logged off in his farm hole and he was ganked and lost 10b+ of farming caps recently. He himself is not "safe" to farm with caps and has to stick to subcap farming if he doesn't want to get ganked this way again, since some groups don't like him. So yes, it's odd for someone who can't make the best ISK in wormholes due to it not being safe, to call it 100% safe. I don't think Exooki said this exactly and since he wasn't brought on the show to speak for himself, things were taken out of context.
---
Additionally, saying that when a new sig appears that you can just "safe up" is incredibly wrong. This is only possible if you fly with subcaps and can MJD out of sites. Subcaps make much less ISK/hr than cap farming. And everyone including the people who abuse this tactic agree that rats in wormhole sites should scram to prevent easy extractions with MJDs since it is too safe. Also, Astrahus Drifter farming is something that pretty much all wormholers agree shouldn't be a thing. Again, this is only for subcap farming. Dread farmers do not use Astras to kill rats. Exooki's corp is one of the most notorious corps for having subcap farms and doing Astra farming. The "elite" high-end wormhole corps who actually make really good ISK/hr do not use these tactics and they farm with capitals.
---
However, cap farming obviously means you are sieged and you also get hard pointed by rats with 30+ points of scram. So it means if someone "rolls into" you and you see them on your "super local", you probably are stuck on grid for another 5-20 minutes with no way to extract. Any competent PVP group will cloak sabres out of smartbomb range and keep you permabubbled while they form a fleet to kill you. So you usually die unless you are farming with enough caps to actually fend off the group that rolled into you.
---
TBH since Exooki was not brought on the show to speak for himself I think it's clear that his statements were just taken out of context or with very little understanding of what they actually meant.
---
Keep in mind that wormholers primarily hunt in wormhole space so we do not want it to be safe here either because it reduces our ability to hunt. Which is why most of the changes we've been lobbying CCP to make for a long time originated from wormholers themselves.
---
Flying a capital without drone skills would be much fun for you.
---
gotg was already a goon pet.. and by association blue against panfam with test
---
Ok I think I’ve got OPs logic.  He’s essentially saying that as the black isk exchange rate is triple the official one, then assuming perfect information CCP is catching ⅔ of all rmt.  
---
If this was not the case, ie a certain chance of 1mil isk is worth the same as ⅓ chance of 3 mil isk.  Ergo if this was not the case, no one would buy black isk.
---
Op has noted that the catch rate is likely to be lower due to the ‘costs’ of CCP sanctions eg a ban.  However he has ignored normal people’s risk aversion and that plex buying is easier than RMT I’d assume (I haven’t done it).
---
There’s usually a 50% sale at Halloween

Nah dude how dare you treat it as a competition, you’re supposed to be a nice guy /s
---
W/e I bought a faction fort with my relic loot, their downvotes don’t make them right. FWIW I use a combat astero with a neut in cargo to swap for the probe launcher and I kill every other explorer I encounter. Why would you care about them getting stuck with cherry picked cans if the plan is to just kill them if you see them anyways?
---
as opposed to having no one from any WH entity in the past...Exit Strategy, are you NS'ers now?
---
Then you're pretty fucking useless aren't you, bud. Your opinion doesn't mean shit to anyone. But if you have evidence that would mean that this televised circus was in the wrong, that's kind of valuable.
---
Otherwise you're just a troll. Nullsecer btw.
---
I could run wormhole sites tonight and record it.  50k/site always has been the norm.
---
Because goons
---
Neg karma in this instance means I triggered some salty cunts..
---
I've had some issues logging in to Eve recently too.  I had delete and reinstall it a couple times before I found it all stemmed from the 64 bit client.  Maybe try unchecking the box that says use 64 bit client and see if that helps.  I don't know anything about tech and such, this just helped me when nothing else did.
---
Well I have most drone skills but not enough for T2 heavy/sentry drones.
---
Someone sold ownership of the alliance for RL cash.
---
Not just Goons.  Pretty much anyone in NS, who did PvE in a meaningful way, said no thank you.  
---
This was not so much an organized response that drove people away, but it was just people actually not being totally stupid and ignoring that Blackout and cyno changed changed the meta.  It shut down Super/Titan PvE, multi box excavator Rorquals,  and multi box PvE.  Their was really no response other than to stop PvEing in NS using these ships or feed expensive things.  
---
When it looked like CCP was going to keep up with the changes, people that enjoyed the above activities unsubscribed, because why have accounts that are of no use.  
---
Absolutely not a ‘boycott’, but a response that anyone with a passing understanding of NS and Eve could have predicted.
---
In other news: the blue donut is finally complete.
---
Well, internet connection is an important thing in an online game so it's going to be hard going around that problem. Because even if you do all the right things - know how to dscan, have spacial awareness, have safespots, know how to gate crash or mwd cloak trick, &lt;2sec align time and etc. if you start lagging, nothing is going to save you apart from fleetmates. The only things you can do is use ecm drones to break the targeting of an enemy ship (but again, it won't help you of you're lagging and can't take your drones out of the drone bay) to escape or use a covops ship. As for making more isk read up on running DED sites. You can do them with fairly low skills, and they get good loot if you encounter overseers which drop faction loot.
---
Gonna be exciting to see TESTs high commands plans for the future, to be certain. Who will we fight next? We don't have any red neighbours: Frat is evicted, RED is set blue, Provi can't fight a war and we got a NIP with goons.
---
But I am sure vily has a plan of some kind.
---
Buyout for what?
---
Late edit: Translation of the screenshot, courtesy of the real OP of this thread (so not me):
---
 018 Logistic Director: "I want to know how much it took to buy RR"
---
008 ﻿Director: several tens of trillions?
---
Little Rabbit: 5
---
018 Logistic Director: 5T?
---
Little Rabbit: "I don't care" (alternative translation:"not my responsibility")
---
Where did their idea of moving to fountain even come from? Init would have to move out and there's no way in hell they are going to since they just moved in. All their logistics people would quit.
---
I didn't know you could send distress signals.
---
With local the only way to actually catch anything is to cloaky camp and when people get content hunt them down. Otherwise as soon as you come up in local people just dock up. I know you want to be 100% safe unless you make a really really really stupid mistake but thats not how it should be. Its already safe enough and theres no reason to add another layer of it
---
Tell him to burn WH space with Goons :D
---
The price tag for buying out RR.
---
The picture is from AOM's director group chat with Miss rabbit saying "5" and others filling her words for 5T isk
---
Tbh if your idea fundamentally reduces the amount people spend on plex/extractors, just wad it up and throw it in the garbage because it's not going to happen.
---
High risk high rewards. Theres a good chance hes afk so just go out there and do what you want to do and stop expecting to be able to control every situation 100%. If he does drop something on you then get your friends to help.
---
Also, the description of "arranged fights" is pretty off. There is no way to predict which other wormhole groups you connect with on any given day. When one PVP entity connects to another, they might see they have Rorquals or ratting dreads out in space and they'll flash form to gank them, which will turn into a completely organic fight with their response fleet.
---
Also plenty of groups dislike each other and evict each other (without asset safety), which usually result in hundreds of billions being lost on one side. Is that supposed to be arranged? lol
---
The only thing that's semi-arranged is that let's say one PVP entity connects to another. And they know this entity is big enough to fight them. Sometimes things are dead. There's nothing in space. They're all ship spinning or playing other games. So you wave in local or you bring a fleet into their hole or you ask one of them who you might know on Discord to fight since you're connected. I don't think this is really any different than when nullseccers want to fight and so they go "roam" in enemy space. Flying a subcap fleet into certain regions is a way of say "hey, wanna fight?" So the other group forms a fleet to fight you. It's not as organic as a gank/response fleet. But sometimes it's all you can do.
---
I was expecting a photo of Merkelchen.

The race is on for goons to burn it down before test blues it

I hear Jita 4-4 has an okay selection of ores.

---
TL;DR
---
TEST's pets best pets
---
Why bot against other alliances while we could bot in a happy blue donut
---
Ores real high right now. Lol the blackout killed the price. Something about no local scares people. Hope it drops soon now that it's over.
---
Upvoted for honesty you dirty little karmawhore
---
Sounds good!
---
FRT: goons and test are killing the game, WC is the last stand against the blue donut!
---
Also FRT: pls gons give us a few systems we'll be good neighbors we swear
---
:thonking:
---
Interesting post, zero evidence, but interesting
---
If I had 10k dollars to blow it definitely wouldn't be on this fucking game... just sayin
---
Well Anything from Tenal down to insmother now belongs to the same coalition basically. And panfam decided to bend over for them some months ago after the last war already. We have finally, 100%, reached serenity.
---
You can find some screenshots and stuff in the other thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/db1p1p/leaks_from_baidu_on_winter_coalition_their/
---
Nothing you can convict on since screenshots can be faked, but atleast its something.
---
Just cross referencing with [the other post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/db1p1p/leaks_from_baidu_on_winter_coalition_their/) Someone brought Ranger Regiment with trillions of Isk is 100% confirmed. Hard evidence of the real money trading though is nearly impossible to come by unless the involving entities decide to leak it themselves.
---
Do you say dear in every post?
---
tl;dw Goon leadership heard the complaints wormhole players have had for the last 3 years and manage to misconstrue them into things we want to keep.
---
Hookers? And booz?
---
Ive done that, no luck I'm afraid, just the same message and nothing.
---
No luck there sorry, just the same message and menu.
---
I'm more of a hookers and blow kinda guy
---
Really?
---
imagine him being a leader
---
So, what the fuck will happened to all the Winter co alliances ? Are they gonna go in their separated way and join either Panfam or the Imperium ?
---
PLA, the goon chinese alliance is getting a deluge of refugees. But most of the alliances will, as it stands now, move to Drones with the rest of the coalition. But I can't say anything for sure, of course. Pandafam will be a reality then tho!
---
its really hard to say honestly.
---
The Chinese style of alliance management/sale/control is very foreign to the way things generally work on Tranquility. So i don't honestly know how this will change anything.
---
Attention actual girls in Eve: Signal Cartel must be one of the best corps you can join if you’re trying to avoid this mentality. There are many actual women not just in the Corp, but in a number of leadership positions (starting, of course, with our Space Mom Mynxee) and you will be respected.
---
Yea thats what I've also experienced with corps in general since I play on autz. I guess just find a corp that's active when u are
---
What is AOM ?
---
Army of Mangos, one of the four larger Chinese alliances in Tranquility. Blue to Legacy.
---
I don't want to move, yet again.  Too many ships, caps, and mods, and all hauled way too far already.
---
I'm going to take a romantic candlelight bath with the toaster.  
---
X up for my stuff.
---
I mean have you *heard* Boat?
---
Makes me suddenly start rooting for AOM.
---
AOM bought RR instead of fighting them, thats like next level blueing, you taught AOM well
---
Interesting.  So now, you have helped to created a bigger mega coalition by destroying Winter. But heh, Test and Goon still have their Imperial legacy megacoalition thing...right?  
---
If no, then Legacy/FIRE will be stuck between Mega panda and Mega Mitten.  
---
F
---
X
---
aww
---
Can I see an alliances set standings toward everyone OUTSIDE of the game?
---
This is what the ideal capsuleer body looks like
---
*tapi note taking intensifies*
---
Ouch. Then Dead Coalition will lost RR and the Tenal frontline will collapse asap.
---
pack light, hehe xd
---
I think he means on the map which was always a thing.
---
full link?
---
We'll see I suppose. I have never heard of this happening before. I don't know about Chinese culture but that could easily failcascade a alliance. Its possible that nothing changes and Miss Rabbit will just continue with RR business as usual. Or not, we'll see.
---
got all of that RMT cash
---
I was just thinking the same thing
---
No, but why not ?
---
Just find a highsec moon mining operation in 0.5 security. 
---
Mine their stuff for free, and laugh at them when they demand payment.
---
Didnt goons and init form up last week to defend deadco's KS's? Only panfam and winterco are left to form the ultimate blue donut.....
---
How many alliances do they think you can jam into Fountain?
---
I have one alt. I'm interspersing useful things that I don't necessarily want to take the time on my main for. I've trained mining skills pretty far, Sabre and scanning are also likely things.
---
Dear Parth, when will you understand that SM3LL &gt; DICE ?
---
Makes sense, for the same reason test and goons are killing the game. You either get more blues or you die. FRT has just learned this the hard way.
---
That would be tough to do, lots of wormhole groups, and theyre easy to just set up in a new WH
---
propaganda tag?
---
The tapirium of the galaxy grows even bigger. Just kill this game already so i can poach my corpmates into squad and albion.
---
I'm sure somewhere in there its NCPL fault.
---
Frat purchasing the use of Elo's super fleet would be a better parallel to this situation.
---
Join our chat channel in game we will do our best to find you and extract you free of charge to you.

start small experience the game take it in stay away from toxic r/eve post
---
if you’re away from r/eve then yea it’s a fun game xD
---
A man needs a name so i can donate to this brave pilot.
---
At least 6
---
no i believe they defend you
---
10% or we will starve you to death :P
---
Damn does SG pay a bil to extract someone?
---
run that error check thing from launcher
---
In doubt, always blame the ex Band of Brother shitlords.
---
Its high risk low reward actually. I have nearly perfect skills and a dominix would earn right around 60mil/hour. That's 4-5 hours it needs to survive to not be in the red when it dies. It creates a very shit prospect. Sure you can bait them out, get them to drop and you guys smash the drop. But your dominix still died unpaid off. Your killboard may be isk positive but your wallet isn't.
---
well the game has always been made to reward risk security wise
---
I do wonder if we get the same level of smug after GSF ran evictions for 2 months straight and then realizes as soon as the leave the hole new structures get anchored.
---
While I appreciate everyones ability to point at a fire and accurately state: "that's a fire"
---
What is the tldr fix?
---
What is the ideal next step for ccp?
---
The problem is: CCP has is seemingly tied up in the lack of consensus on this front.
---
If the eve community were to agree on a next step, what would that be?
---
[context: someone from AoM essentially just bought Ranger Regiment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/db1p1p/leaks_from_baidu_on_winter_coalition_their/)
---
And CCP wonders why their subscription numbers are in the toliet.
---
I'm more retarded for even having read this. Thanks
---
Goons don't go there because wormholes deny them the only things they're good at, blobs and supers
---
&gt;Dead Co. with the largest active super fleet and they been demanding CTAs from other coalition members over the protection of RR structures in Branch/Tenal for a while now, it's easy to say RR has a huge influence in terms of decision making within 
---
Yep and a couple of days ago.
---
Yeah... Rereading the question of OP now with halfway awoken mind: Actually I d like that feature he is asking for.
---
Join fleet...
---
probably helping goon and their structure bash until they reset you
---
Oh cool less wars  ingame /s
---
Hm, I did that years ago and havent got banned so far... ;)
---
I kinda hope that Legacy tries something against Imperium eventually. It's not in their favor as things stand, but what else is there to do? Fight the final boss of EVE?
---
you used the word "killing" in present tense. I think its pretty much done for a lot of people at this point.
---
I think it’s probable that Exooki has some idea of what he’s talking about, and that he either miscommunicated to the CSM, had the CSM misconstrue his statement and believe these weren’t communicated as problems that have never ever been mentioned before, or that INN is a disco record of spin.
---
its an investment for them. They expect to get their investment back via RMT.
---
Invade Geminate again
---
I will confirm that what Moozhe has said is very accurate, and paints a better perspective on these particular WH issues than what the CSM members featured in this stream VOD have presented.
---
Almost all minerals are at an all time low.  Get your facts together
---
Eh, maybe. There are still quite a few people playing. I don't dispute that the numbers are down, but they aren't totally in the toilet yet. CCP still has time to recover.
---
I have so much shit in random Detorid and WC huts.  Probably just all going to lowsec.
---
How long before lowsec evacuation ops?
---
DSL is a good high speed connection. Maybe you mean dial-up.

I feel like $10k doesn't go far for hookers AND blow....

Shoutout for Squad, are helicopters in yet?

Nope she is just good exploring she had over a bil in cargo when she decided to help the man SC members are fearless.

Oh, you seem really upset about a middle aged edge-lord calling you out for being a hermit krab. I especially loved the visual you inspired of the buried hermit krab yelling " bring it on! " from somewhere underneath the sand on a beach. God if I had a talent for making memes.

Maybe in 2012

Yep, if I had 10k to blow I’d need to rebuild both my peen and my nasal cavity a couple of weeks later.

Donate to SC they will use it to fund greater player retention.

Blue donut completion status: 75%

I normally source my hookers from the clearance section that way I can get the good blow.

As long as you don't mind the burning sensation afterwords when you rock a piss it's all good.

They had a shitload of blues.  I guess the lesson is to win wars instead of lose them.

In testing, you can play them on the test client

Sigh.... *Unzips*

Can I get a TLDR of the recording?

They still get a 1000% rainbow bonus to sensors.

CCP would have to actually create the new mechanics first, they haven't announced a thing since the cyno changes.

Honestly I'm not sure what the point of playing null sov wars is anymore. There is so many long blue lists and such a general power imbalance at this point that the entire region of the game is just uninteresting. We are at Bob levels again and honestly I can't see a reason for the majority of the null pvp base to log in besides killing npcs. Why bother fighting a war that means aboslutely nothing.

A spectacularly beautiful chick.

You make SC so much better than it would be otherwise I'm glad to be in the same corp as you.
---
That is so nice of you. Tyvm

I'm pretty sure Bob is friends with Johnny.

I don't think taking any political decision from random timer is anything good to prove a point, for example I could say "Goons are friends with PL because they once work together to burn one of Lenny's assets" or "PH are in war with NC because they fought for a different side during the winter war (or whatever this meaning less war name was)" What really matter is what happen during big wars and huge battle, it's well know since they join Tranquility that Panfam have good relationship with FRT and don't get me wrong, I wish they could have more people joining them to "kill" goons
