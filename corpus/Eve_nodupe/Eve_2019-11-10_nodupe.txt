Pico gang play-styles are generally representative of a vocal minority.

---
Everyone wants FW to be better and FW does a great job communicating their needs. CCP just doesn’t seem to be listening regardless of representation.

---
Deal with some relogging, or pay an additional 1.8bil isk/month or $15US per month. I know i'd rather deal with a lil relogging.
---
DOWN LOW....
---
TOO SLOW....
---
Alright, I am not going to continue to go round and round. Everything you are saying is addressed in the above.
---
The lowest? I've never observed such a thing, it always goes to the highest that can accomodate the whole stack. If someone is buying 100 at 0.1 isk and someone else buying 70 at 40 isk and you are trying to sell 80 units then it will go to the 0.1 isk unless you break it into a stack of 70 and 10 then you will get 40 isk for the first 70 and 0.1 isk for the last 10.
---
I disagree. Given your "professionalism" and "general command of Eve" criteria, we still couldn't reduce the candidate pool below 20.  With "typically underrepresented expertise" one can point at three or four who should be on top of the ones list.
---
Dopamine already confirmed how valuable the diversity of expertise is on one of the TIS interviews and exookiz exemplified it in the summit so I don't see the point of us keeping debating over this.
---
Of course I'd know how to respond and how it would effect that environment. I spent a year talking to the FW guys and getting their feedback about what their biggest issues were and what they'd like to see. There's nothing in the NDA that prohibits me asking FW folks what they'd like to see or what their concerns are - in fact, that's fundamental to being a good CSM member. Olmeca has an entire discord server designed to help him gather input. 
---
If you play this game enough that people know who you are, regardless of what reason, you're going to know enough about EVE to be able to contribute on the CSM. 
---
You don't need to be an expert to serve on the CSM. You need to be an active player who cares about the game and actually plays it and if you meet that criteria you're 90% of the way there. 
---
It's more amazing how many people get on the CSM who don't fit that criteria, honestly.
---
Buy a Fedo, highest on market. Those are the purebreds. Feed the accelerator to the Fedo, and throw it on as cargo in a tri-tanked Atron. Put some exotic dancers in there with some tobacco and just watch the shit hit the fan.
---
So it's np with you when null mega empires get 70% to 90% representation with %25 to %30 population but suddenly small gangs are just a vocal minority to even deserve 10% representation.
---
I second this. The refer thing is nice. Just don't redeem until you are 5mil SP. That way you get past alpha cap. Or redeem all the way if you are omega.
---
We're going to keep debating it because you keep bringing it up. And with all due respect to Dopamine, he's not an EVE player and he's been on the staff barely a year.  I don't know how he can say categorically that diversity has value if he doesn't have the experience with past CSMs that were far more diverse than this one (this one is 8 nullsec guys, 1 high sec and 1 wher, after all). 
---
You keep trying to win this argument with me and you're not going to because you're wrong.
---
&gt; $15US per month
---
Yeah, but this gives CCP more money to spend on useless projects they will abandon later.
---
better off hul tanking an amarr ship imho
---
Totally agree, it was awesome!
---
If you end up using it on an alt, there's a skill that extends the duration of accelerators. I can't remember the name but I can check when I get home. I would suggest training a couple levels.  I'm not at my computer atm but getting level 3 shouldn't be too long. Just don't go for 5 just yet. 
---
I don't know if the training time will end up being longer than the accelerator duration increase, if anyone knows please correct me, but in any case it's a nice skill to have when they do a login event that gives you such items
---
I was gas mining in a venture in a wormhole. I had minimized the game while browsing the internet for... uh... the weather. When I finished with that, I pulled the game back up and hit d-scan, and see some Chinese dude in a stratios on there. At that exact moment, I notice he's not just on d-scan, he's on grid with me and locking on. I just about shit myself and panic scramble to warp out, thinking "well, at least I might get out with my pod/implants"... and watch as my shields, armor, and hull just vaporize in seconds. Then I get into warp, only to realize that my venture actually survived with ~20% hull remaining. I think I laughed and hooted like a crazy person for the next 10 minutes straight whilst periodically yelling "suck it china man!" at my monitor.
---
You asked me if my being a lobbyist was better than being an expert. That's why I answered the way I did. I wouldn't have brought up what I do for a living otherwise. 
---
Yes, communication alone allows that - how do you think elected officials in real life do their jobs? They can't possibly be issue experts in every policy they're asked to vote on or help craft. They have to be able to access experts and advisors and staff to help sort through things.  I don't need to do any of the things you're asking me if I could do because I know who to talk to to get that information if I need it. Generally you don't, because that level of detail is too in the weeds for what the CSM is used for by CCP. 
---
I agree, I don't want any airheads either. But I've found plenty of experts who are bigger airheads than the folks who care and want to be there and put the work in to try to do a good job.
---
Never let anyone tell you, you dont have talent sir, and if they do drop a couple hels on them. Keep up that fantastic artwork sir! I look forward to your next artwork upload.
---
Based on the data presentation during Vegas, I'd say it's a solid yes.
---
Yeah we basically have a bunch of T1 ships Battlecruiser size and down with mostly T2 modules. We do go into wormholes regularly, so our ships are omni tanked, but its still a far cry from pirate faction battleships and rattlesnakes.
---
Filthy Gallente. Have my up-boot
---
This was a great battle , got a cool killmails and I also found out that Elise was my dads lover ,
---
Check /r/evejobs
---
Off the top of my head, you're looking for Academy of the Unseen Arts CEO'd by Eric Shang. Newbro friendly and a big part of their operation is their HS mining. There are almost certainly other/better corps for you but this was the obvious call and a point for you to start from.
---

---
They don't need to, the nullblocs post the Approved CSM list to jabber/discord and that's how the sheep vote.
---
Finally some decent content around here. More baking!
---
Super TLDR: 
---
Hogs collective placed a fortizar in Hek, primarily for the Halloween 100% loot drop event, during which we had over 200 concurrent wars. The aim was to generate as much content as possible. And boy did that deliver.
---
Almost 100b killed overall. With the fortizar included, the isk fight was about even.
---
Fortizar was lost, but it served its purpose and generated one of the biggest highsec fights in a long time.
---
If anyone out there thinks eve is dead. Clearly you aren't looking hard enough for content! This was in HIGHSEC damn it. 
---
Thank you very much to everyone on both sides who came and made some explosions, that was an awesome fight!
---
I love eve &lt;3
---
he was quite a fat cunt as far as i remember. He probably died from a spider or smth, bastard.
---
Did he do it for 72h? What about a week? Month? These bots will not stop unless CCP bans them.
---
You are not supposed to talk about that.
---
Drones for life
---
If you can fit for them, shield curses are very good at pve content, in no , and can easily be augmented for high sensor strength to avoid getting scanned.
---
 If you're looking for something a bit more substantial for defense, have at least 2 people running logistics to back a buffer tanker fleet up. Even something as simple as a Caracal can be ferocious with logic backing you up, and if you have a dedicated tackler you can win most fights since often times roaming fleets wont have logi backing them up.
---
Choose your space carefully. A great way to check  safety of a low or nillsec area is to see how many ships have been destroyed there over a few days. If you pick the right one, you shouldn't get dropped on.
---
Ok so you will defer to Olmeca then as your representative? You are ok with that?
---
I don't know what you mean by "defer" but yes, he represents me because he represents the entire playerbase.
---
There's a first time for everything. It was fun as Hek.  
---
Don't judge me, I'm a dad.
---
You are really talented! I chose watercolor painting as an activity during my alcohol addiction recovery. I painted one picture.
---
So a few times we definitely fleet warped to avoid getting alpha’d by the tornados. I know a couple times we bailed with reds in structure. But bigger picture, right? Lol
---
No.
---
Inside the cake is 5 smaller cakes
---
The [WRECK] fleet admiral who cooked up this doctrine deserves many thanks - he provided endless warp-ins and yet didn't get a single killmail. Thanks, Dave!
---
&gt;every other group in history has failed and find a way to drag the inhabitants of high sec OUT of high sec?
---
Blatantly false.
---
So, if others can do it. Why can't the north?
---
So you ran out of arguments.  That's ok.
---
People will say something like a procurer or drake makes the best bait because it will survive. But they are dead wrong. The best bait is something that the target you intend to bait out can kill. Because bait that doesn't get bitten on, is bad bait.
---
It's a half-decent pun. Not the first time for us, but thanks for coming to the party
---
I guess that's the end of the discussion then because i have no more argument.
---

I knew a nerd that ran a sigil that was was literally nothing but tank and some tackle. It was disgusting to watch him warp around with an unnamed sigil from hole to hole and sit there like he was afk. That alt had a super clean kb of nothing but industrial losses and the occasional pvp kill in a fleet. It worked like a dream.
---
And when someone you don’t like moves into your Corp, you harass them until they leave?
---
https://www.pushx.net/ cheap and reliable freight service, set a collateral.
---
alternatively look for "rita jita" (i think?) ingame and join the "hauler's channel" in her bio ("haulers channel" i believe if you wanna join directly); a bit more effort, but it's cheaper and often much faster.
---
I hear you my dude. I've been trying to find this one porno I saw about five years ago with no such luck yet.

There's an EVE discord server?

No good loot, worst "boss" reward, made around 80mil isk.
---
Met cool people, learned some interesting eve history, got a small glimpse of how crazy space fights can get.
---
all in all, defo worth the risk of posting and trusting someone who answered.
---
Had fun.  Lots of room for the little guys and plenty of opportunities for the smaller alliances to come and kick them.
---
Nice that we got the kill mail on the fort too.   We had to switch to shooting the fort toward the end.. was very close.
---
GF's all round.

But if you want some fun and an actual war in nullsec, you should maybe look for another game.

CCP refused to fix sov and citadels, which basically killed th big, interesting wars.

I tried that one but i want the windows side by side and in a good resolution

---
Amazing write-up dude, just going to clarify on some things for the HOBO's side.
---
Our first objective at the start, before the BL Ravens warped in was to pause the fort timer with drones and kite away from it's dear, and the obj remained that way until PIRAT switched to Hecates.
---
At that point I switched into tackle and our main obj to hunting down the hogs Naga's and pirat hecates, as well as getting that fort finished off right at the end.
---
GF's all round, one of the best fights I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in!
---
Will miss you, good luck on where you go
---
Do not aggress do not aggress

You have no idea what you're talking about...
---
No different than WH posters saying blackout good.
---
One thing I still don't get is why you chose to partner with the only other source of content in your TZ down south (RC) against a group that has almost no pilots in your TZ (Provi)
---
Not that I'm saying you should have done it the other way around - I doubt anybody in Provi would have accepted it - but... seems like you're kind of shooting yourselves in the foot with this move.

I just don't shut up in local, huh

Why do I need to spew anything but the truth when we have you projectile vomiting bullshit

---
Your entire argument is essentially this:
---
- There are more players in HS/LS combined than NS, so obviously they should have more CSM seats.
---
Yet you either fail to recognize (or admit) that voting participation / solidarity is vastly more important than those eligible.
---
Booo low effort copy pasta salt.
---
Lost me at blue donut has no down side.. Try again when you understand the game friend..
---
most of his votes came from 3 pp with LOTS of camping alts lol
---
But game mechanisms fuel diplomacy, no ? If I take my own area : most of the FW civil wars were because people on a same side were disagreeing about what the Tier should be or if it was the right time/worth pushing the warzone ( effort and burnout as you rightly say).
---
Some FW alliances almost failscaded because of that, corps leaving alliances or even switching to the opposite militia. Just because of the Tier and warzone mechanisms.
---
" point for things to get interesting and break the game " what do you mean ? Sry i am not a native english speaker.
---
Hello! I've made my first billion hi-sec ratting. People will say there is no money here and they are wrong. If you know what to do, you can make some good money. Of course, luck plays into this. One day I can get 100 mill from 1 site, another day I barely get 1 million from a bunch of sites. Also I recommend you use at least a cruiser and a Mobile Tractor Unit to scoop up the loot fast.
---
There are 2 ways to go about this. Farming for escalations and hunting for good sites.
---
Farming escalations is pretty straight forward: clear every single combat site you see. Eventually one will escalate. This leads to a new combat site which usually rewards good loot. For this method, the escalation itself is the source of the money.
---
The other method I use is what I call "hunting good sites". So what's this? Some sites are better than others and drop better loot at the end. Idea is to only do these sites and ignore the ones that don't drop good loot (or have lower chance). Now in order to do this you will first need to know which sites to run and also you need to be able to scan down signatures, as most good sites are hidden.
---
If you want to know more, feel free to ask.
---
I just noticed you mentioned low-sec and not high-sec. I'm stupid.
---
I really doubt it takes much longer than 10-20 mins of flying around to find a clone. But again you can't count on LOW SEC anoms they don't respawn. If you die with them in your hold that's a you problem maybe you should drop your cargo every tag instead of carrying them around.
---
The biggest point here is I think your comparing null anoms with low anoms and they are wildly different. I'm not going to say tags are better than null anoms as it's comparing apples to oranges.
---
check advanced audio settings with eve running and see what device it is using as it's output. windowsw advanced audio settings lets you assign individuual programs different output devices. Mine was ann over the place after recent windows update.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
you're sitting there pretending there's nobody to recruit, at all.
---
come on.
---
No room named Falcon? Too soon?
---
Maybe the unisex toilet?
---
*SOLVED* It was the Nvidia update. I've got music and stuff now.
---
Great stuff right there :)
---
You can't compare a rely able income that he's not asking about asshat.. It's like me coming in and saying yea get a dread and a c5 and you'll make billions.
---
Most corporate meeting rooms are referred to as Hel, regardless of the nameplate on the door...
---
Try maybe 5k, at most. And not all of them are PvPers. But regardless, everybody said the same thing about BoB.  PL was only a powerhouse because they had high skill point characters + a large (for the time) capital fleet, not because of numbers - nobody expects PL to be a big group, that was never their thing. 
---
Horde, Legacy - these guys are all playing the game the same way Goons do, and they're increasing in size all the time. It's only a matter of time before they catch up.
---
Damn space libtards
---
&gt;It isn't any different than what's going on right now, or was ever going on.
---
Yes, that's why eve isn't in the best place right now for new players, yes I know there are a lot of other retention issues but I certainly hear a lot from people who feel they can't catch up.  It was less prevalent when there was less proliferation but there's no turning back the clock on that.  CCP now needs to balance based on the fact that titans and supers aren't rare.
---
&gt; "balnce by cost" means "any bullshit flies if cost of it is high enough"
---
That's typically what balance by cost refers to however, that A &gt; B in every way but cost.
---
&gt;As for winning side issue and it snowbolling situation into monopolar server, I think it's simply inevitable in any game like EVE, it's just a matter of time.
---
Only because the game in the current state is group with more titans wins.  The state of hunting makes that even more reinforced
---
Unless you're only fighting wormholers btw, when you pod someone you're getting them back in a ship quicker than if they self-destructed or had to fly home.
---
When did we piss in your bath?!?
---
Uh...elected officials are generally advised by specialists in the relevant field who hold an office dedicated to telling their airhead what to do. 
---
Lobbyists on the other hand have an agenda which they push without gathering all the data.
---
It seems to me that this entire thread is just you lobbying to have more lobbyists on the CSM lol. Which is funny because a lot of them already act as lobbyists when a topic is broached that they have no knowledge on. 
---
For an example I could point you towards exooki’s talk at CSM which all but dumbfounded the entire CSM and ccp. Everything exooki presented is common knowledge to any high sec wormhole group.
---
Picture your worst case scenario. Now look at it and say "it will never be that good".
---
Great combination, enjoyed it.
---
Nowadays you don't even need to google resistances, all the information about damage and resistances are available in the "show info" panel.
---
We are still alive and kicking! Come learn with us we have new bro joining daily.
---
We have a arranged fight with R draw tonight in 3 hours time.
---
So if you want to jump in the deep end get yourself to ichoriya and prepare to have some fun!
---
That would require thought being put into the state of the game instead of CCP yeeting shit at the wall and see what hits the floor last.

Idk. I had fun in null. I dont live there anymore but I have found memories.
---
dropping 100+ dreads and not killing anything :peepo:
---
Drop 121 dreads to kill nothing. I don't know how supers didn't die with only 13 Apostles on the BR.
---
How many FAXs did xix have??
---
It’s not communism, it’s like super nationalistic capitalism.
---
Neither do I, that's a crushing amount of DPS to drop
---
&gt;try content
---
&gt;get blobbed

&gt;lmao, 121 dreads and killed nothing

Where should I go to brawl with some Ursha'Khan folks :) ?

---
ingame (no ban pls)
---
1. one of the backups was in system. he died on warp-in
---
2. Dreads did have armor and shield, with backups
---
3. We had several dictors tackle them, and bubbles to anchor (never called for them to be anchored, but it didn't matter in the end)
---
4. Second dread wave was waiting on cyno ship number 5 and 6 to get into system...xix did a good job camping the route and our cynos moved slow. and the second wave of dreads dropped like 15km from the bus that was dying at the time. by then xix brought in more fax though
---
Like for all the salty dudes out there saying we suck, we gave it a good try I dunno what more you want. Cyno issues cost us a titan kill or two. Dictors died too fast so we struggled to keep them bubbled. Been semi-quiet trying to move 100+ dreads in goonswarm for two weeks and coordinating before like 6-8 groups. It was a few seconds of a cyno living away from being a good trade. Such is life.  
---
Goons don't do shit but krab in delve - fuck you krabs  
---
Goons try a dread drop and die - fuck you suck (never mind the other 6x titans my corp n a few others got this year)
---
It’s goons no skill just bodies
---
\&gt; blue everyone around them
---
\&gt; blue 80 - 90% of null
---
\&gt; why no fights SAD
---
you said there aren't enough players to recruit in order to get parity - you also said the imperium makes up less than 50% of null.
---
simply "the other half" of null are enough to make up parity, and on top of that you have "literally everyone from outside of null" to recruit from.
---
there are more than enough people - YOU just pointed that out to us all.
---
Eve has changed therefore skillpoints and capitals come second to sheer numbers. Of course BoB was considered unbeatable at the time, but that was when Eve was still growing. Hopefully you realize that the goons current policy is going to stagnate this game until the servers close if they don't change anything. The policy is = blue/consume entire alliances into the ranks; such as Blue Legacy. You can say the Legacy is an NIP all day, but you and I both know it's only in place so that the goons can recruit unchecked and not be at risk to any supercapital engagement.
---
Evictus owned most of Immensea when I was flying with them 6 months ago before I went off grid and only have online access at work.  Good group of folks there, I had a lot of fun.
---
Legacy, pretty much TAPI-pet status, unless things changed dramatically in the last few months.
---
bruh?
---
Someone hasn't read the lore.
---
Must have been some fight.
---
I'm a newbie that's been based out of Hek for the past 1.5 months; it's amazing that something like this happened in my system, and more-so that I found a huge write-up on Reddit!
---
I love this game.
---
Hey! That's the most work you put into ships in, I don't remember when.
---
Is my English so bad ? :) half of the people here think i want the black-out nerf bat back, the other half think I am protecting a stagnant blue donut.
---
It's the opposite : the proposal is against the blue donut. But without nerfing smaller alliances.
---
Basically my idea was to give in-game reasons/reward to betray your allies if you are part of a blue donut.
---
And if players want to go full map painting, the more they conquer the more they will have rewards but at the expanse of their local and cynos.
---
TLDR : you can full donut but betrayal and pirates will exploit it through game mechanism to bring you down since satisfying your greed brought drawbacks.
---
needs more purple.
---
Wormholes are great... wormholers on the other hand....
---
1 FAX counters 6+ Dreads shooting a Titan (Before RR diminishing returns).
---
According to comments they had 30+ FAX so unlikely you can break a Titan at that point.
---
Hard af maybe but throw another dozen dictors at it and maybe you don’t flush 120 dreads down the drain
---
[https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FkGt2sx9Kxm5fiNqK](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FkGt2sx9Kxm5fiNqK)  &lt;- Add +30 Bil to that, this is the right battle report. But hey 30 bil there, 30 bil here. It was hell of a fight ;)
---
UI changes should of happened about 14 years ago
---
Logi, delete logi. Worst part of the game atm.
---
Propably (with tickle leaving) the funnest and competentest test pet.
---
Reason why wh players have trig doctrines: good for whaling, and it's the only thing they do: hunting defenseless rorquals and run away ASAP when response fleet shows up.
---
The Grind of waiting for skills get tedious and quite honestly boring. Injected my first carrier just yesterday after spending 4 years in sub caps. Just didn’t want to wait any more.
---
I think the only ways you could piss off external alliance diplos would be breaking a promise on cooperative ops and backstabbing, dropping citadels where they shouldn't be, or cloaky camping in the wrong area.  Like I thought test was almost always fair target for dread bombs - the restrictions came in leaving cloakies online and placing citadels in paragon soul or esoteria. if test is a fair target, why would test pets be any different?
---
biggest downside is moving 100+ dreads into position for a high chance of failure.  if they aren't moved quietly ahead of time, the higher the odds groups are prepared for them.
---
thanks for sharing
---
Linemember #7628998! You're late for the moon extraction! One of the damn finest empire builders our alliance has seen! The way you dropped your 3 nyx alt on the 4 man subcap gang, you're amazing at fighting outnumbered. You're blue donut medal will be coming through the mail shortly.
---
Don't forget the empire building narrative!
---
Goons and test have historically shot each other a lot living next to each other in the south.  the only thing is there hasn't been sustained campaigns.  more like "daily 17:00 fleet coming through".
