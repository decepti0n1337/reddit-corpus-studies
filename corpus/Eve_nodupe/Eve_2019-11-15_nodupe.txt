Groen actually talks about it in a way that highlights the connections. It's all one contonuous narrative but very few people have actually played that long and were in positions to know why the article making wars happened. Fascinating stuff and, to me, more interesting than a game like WoW where the story is written by a, at best, novice fantasy writer who has a corporate agenda they have to follow.
---
---
---
well crap.
---
Why are your icons up so high?
---
Rookie numbers
---
Nah. Fire DD. go cook breakfast, get more coffee, run a load of laundry, go for a 4 mile jog, quick shower, wax the car, then fire next DD. I get more done during tidi than regular eve play.
---
Yeah I was just about to post the same thing. I don't think it's particularly healthy for me to sit in a cubicle for 8 hours, but here we are. And that is presumably the "normal" life that gaming can interfere with lol.
---
Its the cheapest hull for chemo fleets
---
Ask the maximiser of fun/h. I take some time to stack pvp ships in a lowsec system, set death station there. Then I can loggin, undock and start hunting in 5minutes
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Chemo fleets? As in.. Cancer fighting?
---
indeed
---
Is CCP Burger the source of the fear culture that pesters and suffocates the organization?
---

---
Have you checked if someone involved in the direction of game design may be involved with RMT and is therefore pushing changes favoring bot-aspirants?
---
This whole thread had me floored. Thanks r/eve.
---
Asking the real questions.
---
&gt;how hard would it be for new group to take such system, upgrade it and possibly expand. 
---
in practical terms, nearly impossible, but you really don't need to be a krab and go for -0.8 systems
---
&gt;by that I mean, how much does citadel being on grid and manned affect medium sized fleet battles?
---
a lot
---
&gt; how realistic is it to fight outnumbered,lets say 4:1, during sov warfare?
---
I thought it was a girlfriend.
---
Generally speaking if you investigate and choose an inactive area it's pretty easy for small groups to hold a couple systems.
---
Not a bad idea really. And if you by any chance wander into another clueless explorer you can fry em like an egg.
---
Setup is tedious but maintenance is no problem.
---
I enjoy them quite a bit as well!   I have been running emerging conduits a lot as well lately, mostly as an excuse to fly this Drekavac I built :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I really hope they push this type of instanced PvE going forward, I would love to see sites like these for ALL the major factions!  Or maybe expand for bigger ships and/or fleets!  There is so much possible down this type of rabbit hole!
---
I have heard a lot of 'hardcore' pvpers complain that instanced space negates a lot of the risk that should be inherent to a universe like New Eden...  but fuck that!  There are 1v1 pvp options at the end of abyssals, and I would love to see group pvp via fleet abyssals!  Imagine 10v10 abyssal fit pvp battles!  The timer could even be extended to 60 min!  Imagine that!!
---
It all has meaning some of that meaning has just not happened yet.
---
Hey CCP Devs,
---
Make an alert that reminds players to call their mothers.
---
That should go over well.
---
Gets boring too quickly though. I've been finding it far more exciting to work multiple jobs and repair electronics instead. Or even read a book.
---
Fucking talking to someone with some insight.
---
Burst Aerator II gives you more DPS than the Collision Accelerator II, and for ACs you don't need to worry about reloading in fights and there is no additional cap cost unlike hybrid/energy where that might be a concern.
---
Regarding the extra heat, that is true in longer engagements however in shorter ones before you have much rack heat it doesn't really matter. Mmore cycles means more times your guns will take damage while heating, but since the %heat on the rack scales the same regardless of whether you have collision, accelerator or any rig for that matter, until your high-slot rack heat builds up to above 50-60% or so you'll see almost the same heat damage from both rigs. Since the ROF rig will cycle more often but it will cycle more times at the low rack heat where it is unlikely to cause damage.
---
Most Frigate fights end pretty early, especially the ships you're going to be fighting in a Claw, either you or they are dead in around 30-40 seconds before the heat rack damage builds up to high amounts so it's generally better to just take the extra DPS.
---
If you don't have it already, download the program EveIskPerHour. Quite complex the first time you use it but it's super useful for working out what's worth building and what you need for it
---
your point?
---
Lots of commitments and way less payout if you're used to hyperspartial Super ratting or have 10Rorqs in belt.
---
That had better be a flairbait, or GSF has gone to shit. Actually save your breath because I know it has gone to shit.
---
EVE is a PvP game beyond question. EVE is fundamentally, at its core, a PvP game. If a consensus ever emerges to the contrary then EVE will have died.
---
CCP has an utterly atrocious track record of investing in other games beside Eve.  As the CEO of CCP, why do you keep repeating the same mistake over and over again?
---
Bonus: have you had your finance team run scenarios outlying the ROI that could have been realized by focusing investment in your core instead of frivolous side projects?
---
What's the alternative? Six years of loyal membership affords him the right to break the rules? That'd never fly.

Wonder who made the call
---
    do not start eve again
---
    you will lose sleep
---
    you will die and rage and cry
---
    you have friends and relationships you need to uphold
---
    don't do this again, Dibble.
---
    that will be $3.50
---
The question is, can Alliance Tournament qualify as an esport?
---
The answer is hard "no" btw
---
True, but still, log in, enter ship and undock is way faster than, buy ship, enter ship, undock in massive lag, do 4 jumps through at least one gate camp, then enter tama.
---
Kill mail or it didn’t happen?
---
Whatever you are doing, want to do it. Only mine if you want to mine. Find what you want to do, then get paid to do it. 
---
Shield Missiles are Caldari and secondary Minmatar tertiary Amarr. The ships are fast, so the missiles work very well with them.
---
Turrets are Gallente, Amarr with secondary Minmatar and Caldari. 
---
Drones for all. 
---
 
---
There are other combinations that are quite good, but I find that this unlocks the most options. Once you get your first tank, you can cross train. At that point you now have a shield toon and armor toon. 
---
 If you find a specific ship you want to try, just roll another toon. A million SP for each one of them from the buddy code means you can jump into almost anyone thing instantaneously, then continue to train to get better.
---
Or worms. Their light drone bonus is really helpful in abyssals.
---
you know people can just read the thread on goon forums where he says he was forced out right
---
OP, maybe? But I've liked Pitts since I first joined his corp, and he's been nothing but a straight up lad. I left because of the policies of the alliance, and now that they've reared their ugly head, he's been kicked.
---
Don't deflect. Why would you kick someone for pvp?
---
Pitts, I'm truly sorry that you didn't have someone sticking up for you like you did for me. Hopefully your friends join you and you continue to enjoy, play, and lead fleets in EVE. I was so very looking forward to fighting you one day.
---
All the best wishes. o7
---
Yeah, I'm in Horde so I have to hate with every fiber of my being every single person out there who's in Goons. Of course.
---
Dumbass.
---
Sry I think u are just making assumptions....
---
Welp, that alternative theory got shot down fast.
---
so the op just decided to not bother posting any evidence instead. got it.
---
How many Alt accounts are we counting? Darksiders is chewing away at Geminate and they can fit their entire Alliance into a single system.
---
Like your sex life
---
Man u must be a salty bitter vet that doesnt play anymore. As someone who has enjoyed this game for very nearly as long as it has existed i can tell you that isk/h is not as important as isk/acc or another way to say it isk/effort.  You know why rorqual mining anoms is more popular than super ratting even if you only have 1 or 2 rorqual? Bc 0 apm &gt;any apm  same holds true for pre nerf vni and currently ishtars and gilas. The isk/hr is irrelevant vs isk/effort
---
 When i do capital incursions i have 1 maybe 2 caps in fleet then for each alt i have doing useful things like cynos, fax  or eyes i have an alt to soak up a share of the profit. Bc those alts have to be subbed  and I sure as hell am not paying for it with money 
---
Per your example btw it would entirely depend. Which one has less effort and overhead? Which is more fun? 
---
I dread rat. 1 toon making as much as a super does most days. I enjoy it and its only moderate APM. I would not trade that in for 2x as much isk/h if it requires 4x as many accounts and who knows how much apm.
---
I would and indeed do throw out n+1 rorqual however bc i can play other games and watch YouTube at the same time which is fun.
---
Anyway have fun with your saltines and water imma head back out and enjoy the game ccp made for us 
---

Lmao.. this big dumbo took to many goons away from the spod, ruining the delve hour count and harming the monthly ego jousting MER! Thank god he is gone. No more stupid PvP distractions.
---
We all lean over and inspect David’s card and Price quietly says, “That’s *really* nice.”
---
A brief spasm of jealousy courses through me when I notice the elegance of the color and the classy type. I clench my fist as Van Patten says, smugly, “Eggshell with Romalian type...” He turns to me. “What do you think?”
---
“Nice,” I croak, but manage to nod, as the busboy brings four fresh Bellinis.

Lucky for you he left then.

Yeah...no.

Vasectomy without sedation is more fun than goons.

What are his views on the “krabification” of Eve?
---
I mean, Hedliner wouldn't be so gentle if an FC of his did something he didn't like so... yeah...
---
The skilling spree crap is a reason for me not to log in tbh. Hate the grind for xp mechanic, the fact eve didnt have it was a reason to start playong
---
FOMO
---
`TAPI and Goons aren't blue, we fight all the time`
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
How big is his golden parachute by now?
---
It wasn't about the rorquals, it was about using citadels to stage from which were specifically agreed upon to not be used for that. Still lame he got so much shit for it.
---
You had me at skins.
---
remember, they cancelled AT to concentrate on game play...such good game play was released this year...
---
Not really, it‘s a little bit more behind that than he lost 300b. That‘s a short thought. 
---
Unfortunately I can‘t talk about that.
---
I appreciate your sarcasm
---
At least it's better then everyone just doing the second the battle start's.
---
Yowza
---
this message will end eve as we know it
---
That was not included in the scenario
---
Not all of it is though. People bitch about anoms being dull, but they can incursion or run abyss instead. They just don't, likely because these aren't afk-able. You can choose to do PVE that isn't boring. 
---
Personally I have a lot of fun running abyss sites. It's not always easy. It's definitely not AFK. You also have to pay attention or you'll lose your ship.
---
Can't wait :-D
---
&gt;no I either have to do boring shit to fund my pvp or keep paying for plex every other day in addition to subbing
---
How many ships do you lose if you need to pay for Plex every other day??

Yes, I agree. I didn't want to add extra detail but you are 100% right.

Though the pirate NPC epic arcs are a good way to fix that, as you can run them even at negative standings, whereas the empire faction ones are next to impossible as you are shot by customs teams just trying to reach the agents! :P

All TEST is able to do is blob! This is disgusting!

please don't be this retarded outside of reddit, and don't reproduce, thanks.

Git gud, son.

i you want to take your revenge on them, after they killed a friendly. form fleet got to the eve scout page, look for thera conections, find the closest, jump in and engage them in thera.
---
You know the AI part is a good point.
---
No it shouldn't. Risk vs reward. Pvp is the risk to my carebear reward
---
Kicked? No. Bullied out of PL? I'd say you'd find a lot of examples.
---
Hedliner being chill? No, that's about as hard to believe as Mittani sucking Molle's dick.
---
Not exactly infinite since it relies on booster charges but a dual large ancil shield booster onyx with rapid lights does about 400dps, has a 30km scram and tanks a buttload of dps. Without any bling it tanks about 5k for the duration of the damage control and 1.5k without. Great for taking fights vs frigate / dessy gangs since it shuts their MWDs down and applies dps well. Damage control lets you hold on long enough to de-agress through gates in some scary situations. Havent flown one in a while but i assume it still works.

Watch out for goon scammers!
---
Let me put this in context.  I was in null.  Had my titan, super, various carriers, lots of sub caps.  Black out comes and ruins my game.  I sold everything, unsubbed my accounts and parked myself in highsec. 
---
Unfortunately, I paid for over a year so I come home from a long day at work to logon and kill my 1 NPC in the belt.  Takes 5 minutes then log off and get on with my day.  If I dare get the odd 5 to 10 npc kill requirements, I prepare some snacks. 
---
The black out ruined the game for many of us.  Many friends used it as the final straw and left the game.  I'm just waiting for my omega time to run out and I'll do the same.
---
I can agree with the risk/reward, but the attacker gets no risk, because they are prepared in advance. Plus most often a PVP fit will beat a PVE fit. And a PVE fit can't web/scram you.
---
out of your 12 hotkeys.
---
1 should be lock target,
---
2 another to be to unlock a target,
---
3, 4, 5, and 6, at least to be assigned to a module slot. and put things like, guns, tackle. prop and repairer module on those. more if needed
---
7 could be a hotkey to open or scan on the directional scanner
---
8 might be nice to easily approach and loot a wreck
---
9 if holding shift isnt your style you want all in one hand 9 could be the button you press to overheat a module when you click the corresponding 3 4 5 or 6
---
10 could be? erm. orbit?
---
11 keep at range
---
12 jump (as in jump stargate or warp to)
---
the 12 options of my first guess. me? i just use the default hotkeys provided, but i dont really use hotkeys that much myself.
---
What is his opinion on the obvious loss of around 50% of the playerbase during the Era of Farms&amp;Fields patches (Citadel/Ascension/Lifeblood) between start of 2016 and end of 2018 ?
---
I have made no statements about who the burden of proof rests on, I am becoming increasingly more convinced that you're just a troll.
---
Delete yourself.
---
(ingame)
---
I'd suggest to join a player group, not renting. Renting is good when you want to suck money out of a corp or other player's work via taxes, it's not good for growth since you'll be subject to your landlords' brainfarts and could lose everything anytime.
---
I'd rather join an established alliance or coalition who will offer way more growth opportunities.
---
The nyx came to grid to loot a wreck like an idiot and sat there until we decided to bubble him. His hardeners were running showing he was a ratting shield fit so he had low EHP. Cheers for the assist. Always amazes me that people with supers dont have enough fax alts.
---
For goons being so rich yadda yadda they for sure care if they welp a few dreads lol
---
you're right, should've mentioned it in summary. They could deliver it with other ship, but, I guess, they decided to stop.
---
This
---
Sure. Let's remove even more content from the game and make the ever growing safety of nullsec, safer.  We've taken booshers and pretty much stuka fleets out the game, now let's go for WH groups &amp; Thera because we want to krab in even **more** peace, with 3rd party programs that ping us when enemy fleets are several jumps out.
---
Seriously, you are the cancer that it killing eve.
---
/salt
---
So something I don't think people have mentioned is you don't want to start of owning null. You want to live in it first. Find a NPC null system that you happy with and that has a station.

Get some stuff moved there and use a station as your home base. Live there for a year and then you can look at moving into a proper nul sov once you happy with the move.
---
enjoyed the vid, what i see if why i dont just mess around with a carrier anymore.
---
back in the day, a carrier could run around solo and it would be fun for both sides.
---
now a solo carrier, or even 2 carriers can even put a dent onto subcaps if they have so much as 1 dedicated logi ship. and carriers not having a rep bonus means capital reps suck ass on them. this guy sends an apostle, but way to late and with no stront anyway. once the first archon dies, he knows he cant kill anything and gives up i guess
---
&gt; Let's assume that's what happened and that OP has a responsibility to source everything
---
you literally did - i know this because i read your post. it's not an assumption that it's the OP's responsibility to provide sources. it is, it's not an assumption.
---
V0LTA.
---
IS.
---
TRASH.
---
man we should totally make krabbing safer. Like remove wormholes man its hard for our newbros to super rat if they don't check the agency tab every couple minutes that shows all the sigs in our area and like all the new ones as they pop up.
---
i mean come on. we'd have to take jump bridges across two regions in 2 jumps to save him. or we'd have to drop our caps on these guys who cant bring caps through their wormhole.
---
but yeah
---
Trash.
---
If you do smallscale there is literally no way around kiting, except you fully accept to be blobbed to death. If you go into an enemy staging system, or even on a staging citadel grid with 3 people and 30 in local, kiting is the only way ...
---
Old, little use. Clean the dust ?
---
That's what she said to my Nestor.
---
What are future plans for EVE? Do you have any intention of keeping bittervets interested in the game? Or you expect to replace them all with more casuals who will get bored of highsec mining/missioning grind after few months and leave for good? Do you have any methods of catching botters or you just rely on reporting from other players? Why CCP Falcon didn't make an official goodbye? He was one of us bittervets who enjoy the punishing EVE gameplay, so I reckon his leaving is a sign of EVE becoming more secure and PvE-oriented, with more upcoming nerfs to ganking and highsec PvP. Will CCP ever become more transparent towards us players and release information like number of active omega accounts in the open?
---
That's why I leave rolling to kondorsssson lmao I'd get is rolled out so frequently....
---
this has to be bait. no one is this retarded.
---
good meme.
---
Great content for members is not what Imperium leaders are interested in I'm afraid.
---
Looked at this yesterday and with lvl 4 cyno skill you have to rig it with 3 x cargo rigs and 1 expander with lvl 5 cyno skill you need 2x rigs and 1 expander
---
Go to Jita 4-4 undock, duel people, end up getting ganked.
---
I suspect he'll have a blast in Trigger Happy. It sucks he was told to leave, but I am happy that he'll likely have a lot more fun in his new home.
---
Only these days?  Goons fucking designed the state of blue null and ccp keeps sucking mittens cock
---
That's the r/Eve spirit I know and love.   :-)
---
Everyone has their own style.  I have a stressful job and I used my game time to relax.  Whether you liked or didn't like the black out isn't up for debate because I don't care.  It's a sand box and people are going to do what blows their hair back but I feel like paid (prepaid for the year) for monopoly but was given mouse trap.
---
I don't think they prefer to do it that way, usually it's a case of "we didn't think about that" before making the change.
---
You were evidently a turbokrab that didn't contribute to the health of the game anyway.
---
So we should all disband and join PH, Brave, Karmafleet or EveUni. This is absolutely the only way of playing that is worth of it.
---
This is why I don't even bother to log anymore.
---
No I'm not! You are!
---
Any blues?
---
Cheers for the assist. was very good timing. Nyx was clearly a spodbrain. TBF i cant remember when it was the last time i killed a super that wasnt caught via blue eyes / blue covert cyno. Thanks for helping out.
---
P.S.: backstabbing you after the fleet crossed my mind. pew pew
---
You should look up what a sandbox game stands for. Clearly playing the wrong game I'd say.
---
Ruining other people's fun and gameplay experiencing is considered toxic in any other game, but not here. Just because it's accepted, but it shouldn't be. If you team kill in R6S or CS:GO, you get penalties.
---
Korean games in a nutshell.
---
Meh. I think I could've done better than to insult someone with unoriginal virgin jokes.
---
But hey, I took the opportunity.
---
Besides Peaky Bois, who wanted to stay in their own alliance but are an integral part from day 1, nope.
---
I'm not saying it should be safe. I'm saying that what people do is borderline toxicity.
---
This is how my first corp operated for a while. It will not work. You'll end up with a bunch of bored renters in nullsec bitching about the hi sec guys not pulling their weight, dividing the corp into two rival factions before it inevitably implodes and you'll be left with a dead corp filled with the dumbest people in the room.
---
Also renting sucks.
---
I dropped a mom joke earlier so don’t feel bad.
---
Not quite. I consider it an opinion.
---
in the fitting window you can check for damage.
---
I would highly reccommend Pyfa. it's a windows application in which you can fit ships and play around, seeing prices and comparing items
---
Long gone for the most part
---
Glad you're enjoying it.
---
How come you're only just getting to it if you wanted to play since you were little?
---
I miss sigma squad :(
---
Too real dude:)
---
Are they really though?:)
---
I really enjoy the proteus. It has has align time + warp speed on the same subsystem and can fit an outrageous buffer tank whilst getting decent DPS with drones/hybrids. Brilliant for hunting War Targets. Unfortunately, this doesn't fit the kiting meta and there are better, cheaper alternatives for brawling.
---
I have a space job does that count ?
---
So for a more passive/pve focus, would it be safe to assume that if and when a war happens my Corp should have basic resources to help supply a defense?
---
And if so, assuming I'd want to help spearhead a navy fleet initiative, how many ships do people usually have ready? I've seen between 5 and 10 of each ship you want to field per pilot. Does that sound about right?
---
Surely he got hit for dread bombing blues?
---
Like who, or what? I haven't seen goons do any other "kick arse balls deep content".
---
Literally the boldest post this sub has seen in years.  Do you also fish with dynamite and drive on the wrong side of the road?
---
My question : When will you fix faction warfare?
---
Its better for you to just sell the ore I presume. You need bunch of skills at max and other stuff to make reprocessing for minerals worth it.
---
The problem is that otherwise your income might be lower compared to just selling the ore directly.
---
You have that in Highsec basically, the ganker gets punished and loses his ship if he attacks you.
---
So all of NCdock maxxed it out?
---
That explains things.
---
Yeah it's never been a NC thing TBH, it's just the only thing goon FCs have been able to say when they don't get fights 2:1.
---
This is solid advice, thanks! And when you say "many" how many would you say? Trying to get a  budget in mind, and to figure out how much I could afford in a week.
---
Day tripping wormholes.
---
Ive seen you guys run plenty enough when you didnt have to. But I have also seen you take fights you didnt have to aswell. So I wouldnt just call it a narrative but out of the WH groups you guys tend to be the most fun. It is however no secret that WH groups tend to run at anything that might kill them.
---
Dude shut the fuck up
---
Easy there edge-lord
---
I'd say you should join a corp and see how things work firsthand, before you try to spearhead anything. Eve is extremely complex especially in terms of alliance structures and fleet pvp, trying to jump in and start organizing both of those at once with 0 experience in either is just not possible
---
&gt;This would be the equivalent of asking one guy working at Wal-Mart why another guy left, but that other guy works at a different store in another state.
---
Except they don't work in different stores in different states, they work in the exact same building and know each other, do they not? They all work out of the main CCP location Iceland, right? It's not even a very big office, a couple hundred employees. 
---
Falcon wasn't a "nobody" employee like some intern, he was a well know fixture of the company. 100% guaranteed they heard what was going on with him, even if they didn't work in HR or were on a different team. I've worked in companies 10x larger than that we always heard the gossip when an important person left the company.
---
As for the Post and Times, you are right, they would have reached out for a statement. And when they didn't get an answer back they would start digging and asking questions.
---
&gt; i have 270gb worth of recording of exactly that but can't find time and/or will to start this project full scale. 
---
Do a little bit everyday!
---
&gt; Did the FC get approval before organizing the XiX skirmish? If not, I can understand why he would have been kicked. The skirmish could have escalated if a third party got involved and Goons may have been dragged into an unwanted war.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I recognize this is all very any-fun, but leaders can’t have FCs thinking it’s ok to do stuff like this, so they have to send a strong message.

alpha can use T2 but only light drones except faction and T1 for medium and heavies...that's quite unfortunate...the nerf kind of hit the wrong ship, myrmidon was worse than VNI due bandwith and signature, after the nerf...well VNI is kind of better version of vexor now, and myrmidon is doing only 410 dps for alphas now, which is better than VNI in PVE but still to low dps in comparison to 
---
I save the description on other command battlecruisers, harbinger shines against sanshas....can't tell anything about brutix with blasters since I have no experience with guristas. Anything else is average on 1 or another lvl.
---
I have to imagine with my specs I can handle a 64 bit client, especially with a video card that is only 1 generation old.
---
Any way to force it to run the 32 bit client? 
---
Also I used DirectX 9 14 months ago. Now on 11.  Could that be related?
---
He didn't get kicked because of the 250b loss...
---
Eve Aether Wars emails mention helping improve EvE... How will/is Aether Wars impacting Eve since the tests involve a twitch based combat system completely opposite to eve's? 
---
Is Aether wars R&amp;D purely to impact time dilation/latency or will Eve finally see some core gameplay changes?
---
Sorry you got fucked over Pitts. I'll miss flying with you. PM me if you want to set up a discord thing. --Kalahn
---
"2M Skill points will be awarded on Singularity for this mass test". 
---
Nah I'm good, give me 2 mill SP on Tranquility and I'll be there!
---
Cool
---
That new dread looking pretty sweet
---
I am still wondering if you are just trolling to get attention or honestly do not understand the game.
---
You want to play with your kiting toys and they want to play with their big toys, you both get what you want don't you?    :P    
---
In truth I got seriously bored with yet another kiting ship turning up.   Generally if it was people who I knew just kited doing the same boring (to me) shit in the same ship again and again and again, and there was not any good players around who knew how to tackle I would just go and dock up and not bother jumping into a PvP ship and just wait you out, more fun actually.   And if that gets you annoyed well tough.
---
There are people that get yelled at for Rorqs (PL) and we use that as an example to compare to Goons who actually awox for mining wrong ore types. 🤣
---
That is always my thought. Make the rewards for tranquility and I'll make sure I'm there
---
Because you used to be able to permatank a vindicator, and now you can't.
---
You can still pump 800+ DPS and have a respectable tank, and cloak. The problem just lies where other people noted, brawing requires committing to the fight whereas kiting you can pick off what you'd like and gtfo.
---
Ree CCP why did you not stick with the entirely unbalanced change that was killing the game.
---
We would have been so happy once every PvE player had left the game and we had nothing to hunt. Its not like the ingame economy relies totally on them. Right?
---
Starting to wonder if I shouldn't just use my Imicus for scanning and get on Myrmidon when I'm omega
---
Yeah it really does.
---
Are you using the 64bit client yet?
---
They have higher turret tracking right? So I'll hit for less damage but more often?
---
That sucks. Best of luck moving forward, I guess one thing to take from this is that you're no longer blue to 3/4 of the map and you get way more opportunities to create content
---
why the fuck not ?
---
So you got kicked for executing a high risk/high reward dread drop that your alliance leadership and coordination team was aware of beforehand.  
---
Despite you being on the other side of the line, I've always thought you were one of the more rational and pragmatic Goon FCs.   
---
Your alliance did you dirty.
---
Farewell and thank you
---
Tho you were far from beeing an easy person, i appreciated beeing in your fleets and honored your energy and engagement.  Thank you for the fleets.  Hope you be happy there.
---
Not sure. Probably not. I just launched the same exe I used 14 months ago, and it patched, then let me login.
---
“Please don’t do it again” maybe but boot dayum that’s harsh.
---
We're recruiting and a pretty small group down in Scalding. Can certainly fit that niche.
---
Other groups you can look into are people like Pandemic Horde, Unspoken Alliance, Brave Collective and even TEST/Goons if you join the right SIG.
---
How much alcohol do you have around?
---
While it‘s on one hand good to see goons honoring and respecting agreements with their frenemies, its double worse to execute someone publicly for what everybody knew beforehand. It rather loved too see a war arising from that incident, instead they do such a dumb decision. Poor management and we can see where their loyalty belongs to.
---
Stop using that word "hope". It has nothing to do with EvE or CCP, they are just your average greedy company that does not give two shits about you or the "playerbase", all they care about is their fat wallets.
---
They will obviously say some generic vague shit that they will "think about it", but it will never happen. AT is gone, get over it and maybe finally quit this failing cashgrab of a game...
---
I like rookie channel, but seriously it always the same question 
---
1/how can I split stacks 
---
2/how can I drag people/name into chat
---
even if it takes 2-3 mins to run, multiply that by 10+ accounts. Thats 20-30 minutes DAILY before I even "start playing". After a while its not worth the effort of switching clients and going through session changes. I'd rather actually enjoy the game and not tick boxes.
---
Please pay attention to *what he didn't say* as well as what he did.  He told you, "my assumption is the use of capitals from the hy- fortizar" which correlates with the fact that *due to a NIP Goons are not supposed to stage capitals from that Fort*.
---
Kinda like the state of EVE/CCP as a company
---
Now... somebody translate the text =)
---
Why don't you tell it to Oprah.
---
&gt; Thats 20-30 minutes DAILY before I even "start playing".
---
this is why it was removed when they trialled it a few years ago - it didn't get people to log in and do shit, probably because they were too busy cycling through alts because it's a better use of time than any other activity in eve. even more so, because back then i don't think we had injectors either.
---
Check out Fancypants Inc, we operate in and around horde space and there’s tons of fighting to be had
---
And I'm sure none of the big wigs in the op with Pitts knew that ...
---
did you try to "escalate" or did it come directly from the top?
---
I don't think it's fair to say that CCP doesn't care about the community. They quiet clearly do, anyone that has spoken to the Devs at fan fests can tell you that. Sure they made some really boneheaded decisions in the past that has led to a lot of resentment, but it's not because they don't care, it just because they made some bad choices that aren't easily resolved.
---
They aren't willing to make any new tools because right now they don't see the AT as that popular and worth the effort. If they see that there is interest they may reconsider. It's up to us to show them there's interest. I'm sure they can find ways to monetize it. This would benefit themselves as a business and the community as well.
---
Mouth breathers love to make assumptions.
---
What's the point of a Coord if they can't advise FCs from doing something that will get them kicked?
---
“My experience... as limited as it is with wormholes”
---
Alright then imma head out.
---
Different issue, Laz couldn't bother to login and put in his new API after CREST, and the alliance policy was that everyone had to be on API no exceptions. Even people like Scott Manley got kicked for not having API.
---
meofcourse
---
I didn't like it the way it was. I like it now. I'm not the only one.
---
If "the game" is afk bot mining and ratting, then sure, Blackout was killing "the game". Otherwise, it was fixing the unbalanced issue with Null Sec having free and immediate access to flawless Intel on who's in your system with you. Without it, they'd have to actually protect their borders and patrol their space as if they owned it, as if they were the authority for it.
---
Cry babies bailed because they can't handle the fear of a boogeyman lurking in the darkness.
---
No, that is not what I am saying.
---
I am saying that having the same people come in all the time with the same kiting ships and the same way of playing gets boring as hell.   In fact you deserve each other.   It get's stale so very quickly and to be blunt a major turn off.
---
I used to get a little fed up when the guys with caps dropped anything that moved, especially when it was people with brawling ships and stuff, but when it came to people who kited, I told them to drop as much as they wanted.   You only have yourself to blame as it takes two to do a boring tango.
---
ok boomer
---
well, if you're already skilling in, get this baby to a T2 wormhole or chip pve/pvp option...otherwise I recommend to skip Battlecruiser class completely for PVE and go for BS's. Praxis does an awesome job (pretty friendly beginner platform), alternative is Rattlesnake (expensive but worth some money if you through some bling it can do up to 1,5 k DPS if I recall correctly, however it only applying in a certain cituation, but than it's awesome - however for that needed investment you better upgrade to a carrier ISK wise), otherwise passive rattlesnake  = cheap capstable solution....if you like some skilling get armageddon good choice as alternative for rattle for at least half the price (you lose some DPS and you'll be armor tank instead of shield tank though)...
---
from my point of view unless you wanna fly exlusively myrmidon do so, otherwise either up or downgrade...yes command battlecruisers tend to have same amount of hp as BS, but only do cruiser size damage. Due bigger signature they nearly eat the same amount of dmg as BS having most of the time only half of the BS repair rate...
---
Had 4 x 20 man+ goon fleets in Test space in the last week alone, and that's not unusual. Numbers of 50+ are common; I've been in the responding fleets. Plus our own roams to goons (or wherever else). I'd say that counts as "fight all the time".
---
CSM Dunk Dinkle told me yesterday that he knows CCP wants to make major improvements to the FW experience and that he hopes CCP will be able to discuss it soon.  tm
---
Welcome Capsuleer.
---
I love laser boats. Instead of thousands of rounds of ammo, I can carry a handful of crystals. And a set of T1 crystals will last forever.
---
Didn't Pitts say SSTAT would get kicked if he didn't leave?
---
Yes this is how to bitter vet.
---
I want the AT back badly. I hope you are right. While I do see some sort of competitive play, in an e-sports format coming to EVE, the AT as we knew it is gone forever I think. The employee infrastructure to run AT is gone. There are no voices in the boardroom to bang the drum loudly to bring the AT back. There is no direct monetization from the AT so it's hard to justify the man hours when you are a CEO trying to get a bonus. I've gotten one tweet from CCP Rise in two years about ship balancing. I get tweets every week from the EVE twitter account about some skin in the store. That is a pretty good indicator of where the momentum within the company is. The company has been financially mismanaged for a long time. There is a literal graveyard of failed projects that CCP has undertaken, that the now departed playerbase of EVE bankrolled. CCP Hilmar kept diverting resources into his delusions of grandeur and now the thing that makes EVE great, the players, are gone. CCP Hilmar, while from all accounts a "cool boss" never fostered an environment that allowed subordinates to speak truth to power. The people who shared his vision found themselves driving the change in the game. Those that challenged him or tried to hold him accountable are gone. CCP Hilmar was never humble enough to realize that he had struck gold with EVE and to foster and nurture the eureka moment of his life and put all his energies, and the companies energies into that. Instead they kept trying to make the next WoW, secure in their delusions that EVE would always be there to cover payroll and keep them in "designer jeans" (shout out to my old school players who get that reference).
---
The investment in new player experience is 10 years too late. Citadel mechanics have ruined the game. There should have been a reworking of the core code to root out all the spaghetti &amp; legacy code 10 years ago.
---
A lot of us could say the same about goons
---
I agree this is something they should have done a long time ago.
---
My only suggestion would be CCP should cater it a bit more for character age so the real noobies (or new accounts atleast) can get the 50k daily for a few weeks to help them out. Yes it will help vets too but it really isn't as significant for vets as actual 1 account noobs.
---
I don't get it help
---
Most people are going to want to keep irl politics out of their eve lives (eve has enough of its own politics to worry about.) But most people are center-leftish in my experience. 
---
Extremists from both sides are typically weeded out because of the aforementioned no irl politics thing due to being unable to keep it zipped.
---
It's now open again.
---
In my early days, Goons were this massive force of misfits who would gleefully throw a thousand T1 cruisers at a target if it meant even a chance at victory. It's sad to see them turn into the risk-averse carebears of nullsec who only want well-scripted fights with guaranteed victory.
---
If their political views is the most important criteria for choosing who to play with then I pray to god that no one is gonna play with you, because you sound like a big dummy
---
If he's brave enough to go into low sec at all when so many vets are too afraid too then i think hes doing something right.
---
'm Korean...
---
We... can't deny that tbh
---
Everybody is shit at this game, some are just more tryhards. Whole "elitism" is just a detriment to fun.
---
I see TRC bois and girls undocking and doing stuff solo or in gangs in and out of their space all time time so in my view they are fun neighbors.
---
you gone, redline gone, not sure how many FCs are left in goons that I can easily remember having a fun fleet with. Maybe a few peacetime roams but not any stratops
---
The problem is all these diplos are the same people for the past 10 years. They've developed relationships they don't want to destroy so their internet spaceship guilds don't fight each as to not upset each other.
---
The same people are recycled over and over again in leadership positions.
---
Here's all the planning that went into this. During blackout my corp staged dreads and had some successful titan kills. We kept up the content and tried some more. Eventually we figured lets try xix...they always drop caps stupidly when we get a rorq. So we went up there with my corp and a few others + subcaps and killed a ragnarok  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/79578434/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79578434/)   
---
XiX obviously counter dropped us. So I had the idea lets kill that drop. Test isn't in range....we can have a real fight for once. Not some premade bullshit cap roam like some of the other people have done. So I hit up several groups: Private dread dropping group in Goonswarm, INIT, SV, Blackops asking who would join saying we needed about 100 dreads. I linked the above kill saying counter drop this is the target, we would stage in HY-, midpoint, then kill it. Everyone posted up who would come and a few more who were in those groups asked if they could bring their corp. I of course said yes since we wanted over 100 dreads, and we added in a Bastion group, as well as several corps in Goonswarm.  
---
INIT wanted to do it sooner than later (I had initially planned for Christmas time) as the Stuka nerf was coming. So we bumped it up and told everyone get their stuff moved. Did several move ops and rough count was 150 dreads to include INIT. So the weekend before the stuka nerf was the target date. One of my friends even imported dozens of dreads full fit to sell to people who were too lazy to move a cap. This was also posted to everyone telling them we have dreads for sale in HY-, all you have to do is get a jump clone there.  
---
Then, Thursday or Friday before INIT tells me they have timers for some R64's...they rf'd them for the wrong day. So we lost a handful of dreads (I won't say numbers) but continued on with the plan. Day of I told people be on 30min early so we could brief everyone in the caps. I again told them the location, sold some of prementioned dreads, and got everyone sorted with extra fuel, cap boosters, fighters, subcaps for SMA, etc. Then did subcaps after we were set. The rest is history.  
---
I have some screenshots of the specific post I made on the goon forums where clearly people replied saying they would join after it listed out every finite detail. Don't know that that adds much, but no less than 5 topmen were joining.
---
Because watching people rage and do mental gymnastics is more fun :)
---
\&gt;  Like, centre right or actually left in general? 
---
FTFY ;)
---
You are of course free to voice your own opinion, but you should realize this is more than an "established norm". It's literally how CCP designed the game from the start and how it has been played for over 15 years by million of players. So it's doubtful that your opinion will have any constructive impact whatsoever.
---
However if you really want a pure PVE expericence with Eve Online, there are some options:
---
\- Stay in High Sec (mostly free of PVP)
---
\- Join a big Null Sec alliance and stay within their protected ares (mostly free of PVP)
---
\- Play on the Test Server (Singularity)
---
But I hope you don't do any of that and instead fully embrace the unique experience that Eve Online has to offer.
---
We tried to in Tribute but you ran away.
---
When you realized how new the character was/how many mistakes they made you could have just held them pointed and talked them through things, then let it warp back into highsec.
---
From a purely outside perspective of watching a few imperium streams from time to time and knowning nothing of how INIT works internally, I highly doubt brisk would let INIT leave the Imperium.
---
Yep
---
Yes.  Chasing Miranda around the Normandy for the 158th time is more fun anyway.
---
Did he say it was because of whelping a fleet? Nope.
---
I'm pretty new as well, but cargo expanders are almost always a sign of a bad fit. This ship has mostly low slots, and would have much more survivability being armor tanked. Add it is, they only had space for 2 or 3 shield mods, which is not much for a battleship.
---
Use it to pay off my student loans
---
Check how much is fitting + hull. And tell me how much time you need to earn that isk.
---
No.
---
So:
---
&gt;I don't have enough experience and skill to do it myself, but its fine  
---
?
---
It compares so 25% of the players making 25% of the ISK in null, when in WH space 5% of the players make 20% of the isk.
---
Seems fine though right?
---
ok fair enough you good.
---
Would be pretty neat to see artwork of ships mid-combat :D
---
Blasters are not the highest dps in the game with triglavian disintegrators. Lasers and hams frequently come very close to their raw damage as well, while both systems will typically apply much more damage. 
---
I said for their respective range, their tracking is not very good. Have a thorax orbit  another at a typical 3500 meters (optimal range) with ABs on, see if they can hit each other. Now take two mallers and do the same thing at 8000 meters (optimal range).
---
I just compared a rail ferox fit to a beam harby. Rail ferox only had 9km more optimal at 94 vs 85. Meanwhile, harby had 30% more dps.
---
That was all ignoring triglavian, which has roughly double the dps of blasters, more tracking than blasters, 4 times the range of blasters. 
---
Trust me, I’m a hybrid advocate. I keep trying to find a niche use for them and they’re honestly outclassed in every practical situation outside rail ferox. Proteus is garbage, Deimos is pretty trash, Megas are useless and hypes are just bait. Best use case is going to be cost efficient thoraxes and Enyos/hecates.
---
Damn dude, that's so fucked. I remember you being one of the most active FCs in Goons when I was over there like 3 years ago... absolutely shameful for an alliance to kick someone who's put in that much service because they're QQing about losses on a totally non-strategic objective.
---
Hope whatever you do from here on out is a success.
---
The Gnosis guys in Jita at the undock and perimeter landing are 23/7 bots.
---
Point well taken.
---
is real, it is stolen
---
I mean, obviously its not perfect if your stuff was "stolen" (fyi dumbass it wasn't stolen lol)
---
Yes, it's a couple thousand dollars for "pixels" that I don't even own, of course I'd take that.  I'd even consider "never play another CCP game again".  It's a stupid question, imo.
---
I paid subscription voluntarily, and got my enjoyment out of the game at the time(s).  Nothing is owed.
---
I killed a newbro caracal in nulsec yesterday, best thing you can do is convo them, give them tips and advice and throw some isk their way to help them along. If more vets remembered where they came from, we'd retain more players imo
---
Yeah back in the day, BoB and Goons "HATED" each other. There were some true bad blood fights between alliances with scores to settle. Now its the friggin United Nations and you have what amounts to practice fights between coalition members because anything too rough will be "inconvenient". 
---
So unless some Goon personality schisms from Goons can can cause a civil war or something. The game is going to stagnate and content creators like this guy will be punished for daring to upset the status quo.
---
Btw whoever decided that. Your a dumbass and you lost a decent FC it sounds like.
---
That's fixed by training Wormhole Living
---
1. Any good corp does this.
---
2. All depends on the players and what is about at the time. If it is a good corp then they will always have a stock pile that they won't need to ever worry about unless there is a MASSIVE push going on for systems with 24/7 plex battles.
---
3. Never. Or to put it another way, how many fitted T1 Frigs and Dessies can you buy with 1b ISK? 1 player in the good corps (and I mean regular player not a Director or CEO) can happy throw 1b ISK in the corp wallet to buy new ships and never think about it again. The main issue is moving those ships, but with Gal/Cal FW space so close to Jita even that is not an issue. And then again with the new moon mining they can easily get the minerals they need to build the ships in their lowsec home systems. When I used to do FW in S0TF we would happily hand out ships to people in fleet who were not even in the corp or alliance, including Fitted T2 Logi or Faction BS.
---
The main point is that the corps want their members in space, in fleet, in a ship. Even if that ship is a T1 frig with only MWD and tackle or ewar, they can be very useful in FW plex fighting.   
---
Good luck 07
---
What?
---
You gotta change the location of your image on the screen so that you’re not blocking the overview and your targets, or you have to move the place where your targets show up in your UI.

Spend a bit of time organizing how you want both your Eve UI and your streaming overlay to work out.

I’m glad you took the time to record and upload this; keep at it!

The last line to me seems to imply that they're going to use it to bash structures, probably the new CONCORD observatories would be my guess
---
Overreped that much he died ayyy
---
Yes, of course I would choose my money back.
---
Any Intel on why was it closed?
---
No. EVE hasn’t been that expensive and it has given me things that I would never have thought possible.
---
Because of EVE Online I have hugged a Playboy Playmate. I’ve gotten to know some really awesome people, had outrageous fun, I’ve gotten to know Iceland, I traveled a bit of the rest of the world, I can follow nerd conversations that scare the people \[Schiphol airport, I love you!\], my name is on a fucking statue. I’ve been addressed \[along with everybody else in the room obviously\] by the president of Iceland. I’ve seen a set by Saucy Miso \[some of the best electronic music I’ve ever heard\]. I am at home in one of the nicest, cosiest art house cinemas I’ve ever seen.

Reducing EVE to the cost of a subscription and some SKINs is *completely missing the point.*
