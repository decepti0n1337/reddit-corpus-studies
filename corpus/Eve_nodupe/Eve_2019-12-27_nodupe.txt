They all get one light drone, except for the Velator which gets two.
---
---
---
Ofc it doesn't make sense because you, naturally, only care about bloc level cap vs cap warfare.
---

---
In 2016 the ratio of capital vessels per active nullsec player was way lower. That's what has changed since then. The mechanics aren't the problem. These ships were designed with their rarity in mind, which is (relatively) no more. And that change doesn't happen with mechanical changes in a patch. It happens over a span of time in the form of ecosystemic change (which still depend on mechanics, but is realized over a longer period of time). That's the meta change since CCP promised shield slaves.
---
I understand as leader of a shield doctrine coalition you want a better balance between armor and shield capitals. We could have achieved that by merely taking amulets from armor capitals. But now I might miss multiple Hel kills on a weekly basis just to balance the coalition level fights you have twice a year.
---
Lol just talking shit :)
---
Probably because I have a fucking brain and understand the basic concept of why people use ships and fittings... which is definitely more than someone who hasnt updated their flair since 2010.
---
&gt;week 1 newbros skilling themselves into dreadnaughts and carriers then dying on highsec gates because they didn't have enough out of game experience to know how capital ships work.
---
The learning curve is there for a reason. You can buy the titan but that doesn’t mean you know what to do with it. And why you’d want one and in what context to deploy one.
---
This is the reason to make your newbie mistakes when you have no money. You make the rookie mistakes and they cost practically nothing. This guy got hold of a titan and then actually thought he could fly one without fitting, in EVE Online, as if it meant nothing.
---
This is what they should also teach newbies: it’s not about the money you spend, you have to know why you spend the money.
---
We have peopel being payed to make the game... leave it up to them :)
---
Some stupid armchair developer is not needed
---
&gt; Another way of achieving the same benefit would have been removing  amulets from armor caps as well. But that'd mean a nerf and angry  people. 
---
They could just buff base armor hp on these ships to compensate.
---
Ya because they dont have an entire council of players to help guide them... fucking retard.
---
My recommendation is to use 2 Nestors and a drone bunny like an Eos to assign drones too if you're multiboxing. For fits, put remote reps on the highslots on the Nestors, maybe 1 or 2 remote cap transmitters and enough tank in the lows it can tank the sites while it's repped by one other Nestor. (If you're solo multiboxing if not it depends on how many ppl you are bringing). Bling as much as you're comfortable/necessary but the fits shouldn't be more than a bil each and you can do it I think with just t2 or cheap faction/dead space modules I think. 
---
Check this site for the DPS etc.

---
Increase stacking penalties, especially for fitting, rep amount, capacitor and hp.
---
Buffer modules should just give a set amount.  No commutative multiplier.  
---
That was easy.

I would too. OP has like, two, customers now.

Carriers aren't alliance assets. They are common, low cost ships.

---
Rorqual for sure
---
I like vexors for cheap or vni a lil more for more isk..
---
You must fly something people will engage.with vni and vex many ppl will think you are a crab. 
---
You can fit speedy or tankie. A point, sensor damp to bring targets close and force to commit. Nos or nuets in the high maybe some toss on some blasters
---
This will be the millionth time someone has asked for this.
---
Nice! When I was a kid I would always build the lego Tempest or the Chimera, seeing this brings back nostalgia!
---
Nice job on this and the venture... keep them coming :)
---
It is difficult (possible, but difficult) to fit a Stratios incorrectly for random PvP and a drone focus. Also, most attractive ship in the game.
---
I've had a lot of fun messing around in a hecate lately. It's not drones but the run and gun style is challenging and a lot of fun. Plus it's not very expensive so if I do something stupid and die I don't feel too bad.
---
stick to booshing
---
I would stream just for that
---
And then you get to that fun point of having all the skills to fly something but no money to actually get it XD.

The Fountain War sets the stage for "World War Bee" in 2016, when basically everyone ganged up on the Imperium to evict them from the north. Unfortunately I don't have any good links for that.
---
After WWB the Imperium grew in the south while the rest of us fought among each other. The next major conflict was the 2018 world war (which has no name). I wrote a (biased) piece on it [here](

&gt;There's no such thing as citadel spam...

Who has actually ever said this since 2016? Everyone has been saying that Citadels would be spammed since CCP announced that they would not be limited like Stations (1 per system) or POSes (1 per moon).

Someone please link Jin'taan's YouTube channel, too. For some reason my phone won't give me a shareable link.

Ah. Chess. The first time I ran into them a few days ago, I almost lost my exploration tengu because I was just astounded by the number of Raitarus and had to count them.

BTW, you're supposed to roam after you jump
---
if you're expecting to jump somewhere with HIGH ACTIVITY and stay in the same area for long enough for a group to form 40 dudes. and NOT get blobbed on you should maybe try roaming around rather than sitting still.
---
You only want an alt if you want your main character to stay in its current Corp or if you don’t want to ruin your standings with the factions. If you don’t care about that then just join with your main.
---
but then why aren't crystals niche if increased rep amount isn't beneficial?

I honestly don't see what the problem is. The gambling is pretty meh and I could see an issue.

The rest? What is the problem?

Lego Palatine

I can't read that title without hearing Khan from Star Trek II.

So, your point is that you have no evidence that ticket velocity increases as number of tickets sold increases?
---
Or just... get rid of the implants for caps and *not* give them more hp, stupid fuckers are tanky enough as is. Be nice to see a flat hp nerf across the board tbh, for all caps, or at least titans and supers
---
This is a friendly reminder that a full passive implanted Avatar has basically the Same EHP as a Ragnarok. Anyone that thinks shield slaves are a good idea breaths through their mouth.
---
Woah, those cheap ones became really good. I look at photos on Amazon - models can be printed with fine details, no layers to be seen
---
maybe it's finally time to get one...
---
I upgraded from Heron to Buzzard back when I was running relic sites and enjoyed it a lot. 
---
Train Cloaking to 4+ and Covert Ops to 5 and all your Astrometric skills for scanning and you have a very stealthy exploration ship. 
---
It has role bonuses for relic/data scanners as well as the covert ops cloaking bonus that makes it possible to stay cloaked almost all the time.  (Cloak while warping with covops cloak 2 and 5 second reactivation time role bonus)
---
Absolutely not I am friendless
---
&gt; a full passive implanted Avatar has basically the Same EHP as a Ragnarok
---
but is the rag passive aswell? being invulnerable to neuts (atleast regarding your buffertank) is a huge advantage,    
---
esp after jumping into a battle, where cap is low and neut pressure is high
---
More interesting is that the volume of these rounds don't change. a regular project round is 0.025m³. If try to 'fit' in a 1400mm cannon you're basically shoot discs.
---
When us Brave gonna up their handout ship game to caps? I want a few free Revs.

Good eye. Just posted them tonight.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no

Well there are a bunch of great corporations focused around exploration (which is a great early money maker) such as the many branches of Eve University and this will help get the isk you need to get omega and be more useful in PVE.

Yes they do.

ty, I was really confused, he was making it seem as it if were because he was doing them on Sisi, idek. thanks!
---
The first part of your question is too big to answer properly. There are many major pvp corps, and who is considered important changes depending on where you live.
---
Re: the second part of your question, the biggest difference between low and null is the effect of bubbles on the meta. Most importantly, the potential for interdictor and heavy interdictor bubbles means people need to be much more careful about using their Supers, as they can be much more easily locked down. This changes how fights develop in a wide variety of ways that would take a long time to fully explain.
---
The second main effect of this is that many people in null don't fit points on their ships. Since a single interdictor can lock down an entire fleet, having disruptors on every ship is a waste of a valuable mid slot. However, most lowsec pirates wouldn't be caught dead without a disrupter or scram on their line combat ships.
---
You can always leave via a wormholes as-well, if there are sigs to be scanned down in the system your in.
---
your never too many jumps from hs ls once you get into jspace.
---
it’s never too hard to get out unless you’ve jumped into a dead end pocket where to be fair your an idiot if you stay there too long, if you have a decent grasp of the map you shouldn’t get caught with or without filliments
---
Sometimes it is just to sell the goods quickly.  Other times a typo.  Most often it is market pvp.  This is one part of eve pvp that goes unreported because no one wants others to know how much they made, how they made it or that through their alts they have cornered the market for a specific item.  Rarely is it a dumb move unless they are market pvp novices.
---
What are trying to do in their heads? Take it to Jita to fit it?
---
just a few days ago I got bubbled one jump from highsec and lost a good payday worth of relic site loot, but the guy gave half the money back. :)

Most of the defenders aren’t interested in content it’s why they bring a 35 man fleet to take on a 3 man frig gang

---
As already suggested, learning to use Dotlan to find targets is key.
---
On a more nuanced level, knowing the timezones of the people in the areas you're hunting is important. If you run through a whole region and it's empty, it could be because the people living there aren't active in that timezone. Like a US alliance won't have many people online during the AU, and so on.
---
Ok Greta :P
---
Find a corp! This is the most important thing in EVE. Find a good group of people you enjoy playing with, that enjoy doing what you want to do, and make some friends. EVE without friends isn't worth playing. Then set some goals and work with your new friends to accomplish your goals and theirs.
---
Do these two things successfully and you'll still be playing in 10 years, like the rest of us.
---
Alright, this is futile so go educate yourself on consumer behaviour and read a book or two instead.

---
Where our shitler pubbies die to Bombers Bar, Volta daily! Sure we have some real retarded people in our Alliance that feed Supers daily but then -by accident- you drop a Theta guy, or one from Capswarm, SSTAT, KMW with proper fitting and connections and get your ass handed to you.
---
But yeah, Injectors are good and bad.
---
Had same thing happen to my character yesterday. Me and my bro had a good chuckle.
---
It depends on the item. If you're selling Tritanium, then sure, you adjust by 0.01 isk at a time, because it's a low value item and small amounts add up when you multiply them by tens of millions at a time. But if you're selling Praxis battleships, worth around 140 million each, then relative to the value of the order even 10,000 isk is not really significant.   
---
However, the time you spend managing that difference could be. What I mean is that an order worth 140m isk has 11 digits - 9 whole numbers and two decimals. Likewise 1,000 isk = 6 digits. So, all the figures up to 1,000 isk = 6/11ths of the total, which means that if you just completely disregard them and update by 1,000 isk at a time you've eliminated over half the total digits you have to think about. That makes updating your order faster and less tedious, which means you can handle more orders, which will more than compensate you for the 1,000 isk or whatever you lose by moving faster.   
---
In other words, you have to think about the cost in terms of time and effort as well as isk, not just isk alone. The greedy trader fights for every last space penny, but the really-greedy trader concentrates on the big picture.
---
I love your idea to spin this on some Isk but as your aware it’s far from the truth. It was your guys talking shit &amp; salt, not fighting , then running in feroxs and forced to drop dreads and we still held grid.  
---
It’s sad even with exact same numbers and up-shipping you couldn’t hold grid. 
---
We are a single corporation outside of any of the bigger alliances in this area. That’s who you couldn’t stay on grid with !
---
Good attempt and no one cares about isk lol
---
Or just stop being paranoid about using Windows and use Windows and not have to worry about having to install WINE or Proton and having to do all these workarounds just to get a game to work and then the game updates and breaks everything in WINE or Proton and then you can't play until WINE or Proton gets updated.
---
Damn this is like triple gay
---
Not that odd.
---
I think over Christmas I went through about 1B in handing out ships to corp members (Shiny new Nemesis' fit for bombing to 6 corp members who tagged along to Null for a random last-minute Filament fleet) &amp; giving donations to people.

Now set it outside in the rain for a few years to make the color accurate.
---
&gt;filaments are unfair because the defender isn't able to completely shut down any and all attempts at generating content.
---
that's not his argument and you need to be an exceptional smoothbrain to think it is
---
I agree so much.
---
Imagine making a reddit post for 400m
---
So momentum can help you mainly with tackling situations - if ship A is stationary and Ship B is moving across it (towards it but not directly), when they get into scramble range of each other, it shuts down MWD's. The ship that is in motion can potentially "coast" out of scram range because it's existing momentum isn't lost as soon as it is scrammed. 
---
Therefore it's possible to use the above mechanic when tackling - if you think you might have a really bad time as soon as you're in tackle range - i.e. you eat shit because whatever you tackle outclasses you, you can handily use momentum to potentially carry you outside the range of the thing. It works best on battleships and stuff but with skill it can be deployed by ceptor pilots against other ceptors, allowing them to hold their target but not be held in return. 
---
Angular velocity 
---
Something moving towards you is easier to hit than something moving across you, which is pretty standard, so the lower angular velocity means it's essentially not making the guns track. Think of holding a rifle and someone walking towards you vs running past you - the former requires no motion of the gun, the latter does, and thus makes hitting more difficult. 
---
You can also cut down on enemies angular velocities in a variety of ways. NPC's often like to orbit in a certain range, you can manipulate positioning to force them to fly away or towards you and cut angular velocity. 
---
The same is true in PvP. Players obviously don't have a particular set distance they always try to achieve, but you can initiate manevoures to try to reduce angular momentum for your benefit. I haven't got a video link to hand but particularly cruiser sized PvP, obviously using guns.
---

Only 2 of the barrels work thanks to legacy code

Sadly pando got nerfed , but he is still around causing chaos :)
---
If you want to join the blue donut, Brave is still probably one of the least demanding. Other Alliances in Legacy often have fleet participation requirements. And if you want to goons, most of them also have some sort of activity requirements.
---
If you want to go somewhere (large, and in a block) else, there is also pandemic horde. Not sure what their rules are about doing indy/ yolo stuff while on a stratop though.
---
There'd probably be counter-measure missiles to hit those missiles. It'd have to be combined with deflector shields or something though, or they'd still be hit by the shrapnel.
---
I didn't even think about all the radiation.
---
OP, have you ever been to an entosis op?
---
As long as they are separate accounts I fail to see the problem here. If there is a problem it's not really for you to worry about. You get more time, or they will reverse the erroneous time, either way you lose nothing but it is possible they will give you something in return for being an honest boy scout about it
---
They do, but RL financial markets typically have a pip size roughly 1/10000 of the value of the item, i.e. a GBP/EUR trade point will be 1.12094 or similar. So it doesn't make sense that you can 0.01 ISK a 300 million ISK item - if Eve's markets worked like real ones that market would have a minimum increment of probably 2000 ISK.
---
Soak in vinegar overnight for true rusty look.

Those players are much better suited for other, more peaceful games than Eve. I recommend Farmville.
---
[Link to the system's killboard you can watch for kills over the next few days.](https://zkillboard.com/system/31002002/)
---
There's a few reasons to do this:
---
- The current sell price is so high it's unlikely the market will move at all. (Markets like Rens are like this for most items.) I will put my item up at a realistic price.
---
- I am trying to stop someone 0,01ing me by showing that I'll reduce the profitability significantly if they keep doing it
---
- The price has gone down by an annoying amount and it's quicker to rekey a new price than press down arrow to 0,01 ISK the current order

---
While you have a point, I disagree with the idea of forbidding injecting into capital skills. I have no plans on ever flying a titan but if I was going to then I would want to create an alt and inject it with exactly what I needed. My main has a lot of skills which would be wasted if I stick him into a titan. On the other hand I've been playing for a couple years now and wouldn't want to wait the months (years) it would take to skill a new char into a titan. 
---
Also, while a day old newbro *can* tag along in a frigate and have fun friends who have played for years, being able to inject straight into a destroyer with good skills (with the guidance of said friends) is usually going to be more fun because you're on a more even level right away instead of waiting a month or so. 
---
Injectors have been controversial since before I started playing. While I can agree they sometimes cause problems, I think overall they do more harm then good. I've never used an injector myself but I would be frustrated to find out the only way for me to "catch up" with people that have played for years is to stay subbed for years and watch the skill points slowly build up. Eve isn't like most other MMO's where you can increase your in-game skills by performing an action. I can't go out and fire off missiles to increase my missile skills nor can I "powerlevel" myself by killing rats quickly and efficiently. Really the only problem I have with injectors is newbros skilling themselves into ships they have no clue how to use and extractor farms but I also can't think of a way to fix either of those problems without getting rid of them entirely.
---
See above. Someone else asked.

you kinda put your "give a fuck" underwear on though by posting in this thread

Have u seen the number difference? It's about balance. Bounties in high sec could double and it would still taken roughly 6 months to get to null sec bounties for a single month. I'm sorry but broken is broken. I'm not asking for a null nerf.

pants = trousers, no?

but anyway, as I said, I'll watch the fun in my thong, giving easy access from both sides

How to kill eve in 7 simple steps.

How about...no.
---
Amazing! It's true matar ship! Don't paint it!
---
there is nothing wrong with the afk-ability of nullsec sites, it's more to do with the insane safety provided by local to where it's nearly impossible to lose a ship as long as you are sitting at your keyboard even when you run 20+ accounts
---
I've yet to see a single PvP sandbox mmo survive without a hisec. By all means kill eve.
---

Just because you get triggered by him giving you a bit of constructive feedback in local does not mean that he is salty.

I would guess pirate factions fighting each other.

Like Serpentis &amp; Angels battling Guristas or Blood Raiders shooting Sansha's Nation.
---
Might need some tweaks on the lore but sounds like thing with great potential.
---
That's a proximate argument, but a bad one. Each of those mechanics as limited in range and sets up new strategy and tactics. They don't collapse space, so much as create new vectors through it. Even with jump drives, you still need to *move* your fleet in an essentially linear path, often plotting complex chains of hops through potentially dangerous territory.
---
Except you can’t krab the sovereignty level up. Plus, contrary to popular belief, not everyone enjoys krabbing. A bulk of my alliance mates hate doing it and the fact the game requires you to on an alliance scale to maintain ADM’s is super trash. Personal opinion, having sov based upon sitting static and krabbing to death isn’t good for the game
---
"Relax" is not an argument.
---
think of ships less like gear in other MMO games as there's no "final ultimate ship of smiting" to work for that you use all the time. instead it's more like gear in action games "this gear is for water world, this gear is for fire land"
---
To better clarify, the faction mods would just receive an increase in module HP, not have that linked with any kind of set bonus. This would add value to them individually as heat sponges if you only have one or a few of them, like faction armor plates or shield extenders.
---
A Hecate with all fed navy gear and a set bonus would be hilarious,  tho. XD
---
It's already happened.
---
Sad but likely very true. Also inadvertently when they patch that the boot.ini will self delete again.
---
Would be on market too, probably.
---
It is eve online! The most large-scale wars all of MMORPG games ever... what honourable brawl u are talking about? If we have 1 hundred people in our fleet t3 for example, and enemy will undock 40 Dreads, will be that fight are honourable?  Or, do we ask our players to not participate,  it will not be fair to them !  Such a game, as many as it plays !  This is not a tournament or an arcade game.
