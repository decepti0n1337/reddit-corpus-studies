Are you serious? That sucks!
---
---
---
That's really fantastic, man. Keep up the good work.
---
That’s awesome man! Yeah it’s extremely fun. Just getting on to see what people are doing and not even really flying. Having a good community in the Corp is probably the most important thing to keep the passion alive for the game.
---
You and everyone else.

These have all been updated as of the September 24th - courtesy of http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/
---
So... 
---
Have those who came back for the blackout now gone? 
---
Those who left due to the blackout have returned but are now less than those who came back for the blackout?
---
Has the reversal backfired or is this cyno rage?
---
&gt; What's in it for me?
---
Exposure.
---
Ok, thanks
---
its dumb because they only killed a vanquisher with it
---
sure they can hate all they want. when the master pulls from the leash it wont matter :),
---
I have been playing 10 years. Been frustrated with the direction of the game the past 3, played more than ever when blackout came around. After reversion decided there was really no more hope for my playstyle as its clear whom ccp  listens to. 
---
Unsubbed all 6 accounts and have only logged in to liquidate assets since. (No you can't have them...)
---
The true bot / farmers all came back. But I think for a lot of hunters and small gang pvpers this was the end of the line, as well a good chunk of the bears whom got offended from losing some safety for 2 months and found other games that are more fun to bear all day in.
---
I've thought about how the wardec system might be further refined, and so far I came up with a system where any player who wants to avoid one can stay in an NPC corporation of their choice, with a small circle of about ten or so friendly players being able to form little "contractor" groups that can move from one NPC corp to another and benefit from the protection they offer. The downside to this is you have to deal with their tax rates *and* you get heavily penalized for any criminal acts committed while working for them since your behavior reflects upon the people employing you. (You might not even be allowed to set your safety settings to red)
---
By contrast, if you want to have the freedom offered by running your own corporation, you have to accept the dangers that come with it, like wardecs. This is something you would be told in no uncertain terms when you first try to set up your corporation.
---
Of course, there are probably multiple glaring issues with my idea that I just can't see because I lack experience with the system, so if you or anyone else wants to point them out and explain why my idea is a bad one, please do so. I want to understand the mechanics of this game as best I can, and constructive criticism can only aid me.
---
People I've spoken with that stoped playing recently are put off by the perceived lack of direction on CCPs part. They're taking a wait and see attitude, hoping things stabilize again.
---
It looks like Hanzo’s bow.
---
Still great work.
---
None of the changes CCP have done in the last few years have added to the game or helped with retention.  Also the fact is Goons &amp; Test make up a big part of the game now as things like the CSM give advantage.  Honestly, this game is what CCP has made it by pandering to a small vocal group of 'experts'.  I'd have thought by now that CCP understood their fans and their playstyle.   
---
For two months now i've been trying to restart my community and between harassment, blackout, more harassment and morale that is completely in the toliet i'm starting to doubt even my own awesomeness to turn this train wreck around.
---
Yea I get that, dude in alliance was complaining that they’re griefers, I’m like nah dude, it’s aggressive business, he didn’t get it, kept bitching about non-consensual PVP.
---
What eve and other games never seam to learn is that when they do things that cause people to leave the game 90% of them never come back.
---
laughs in PVP stratios killing  bling rattlesnake.
---
That’s cool, glad you have been safe.
---
Meet a pilot trying to do that in jspace with two alts, for whatever reason, they tried to set up a POS in our system, so we had to put an end to that.
---

What was/is your play style?

can you ever restore &gt;-2.0 standing with an agent?
---
One of my fav ships, nice!
---
I will throw money at you to paint a megathron, plz.
---
if it goes under -2.5 i dunno, i dont think so
---
lmao fkn brutal
---
Go run a few c2/3 sites maybe?
---
Your rigs cost maybe 50m and the rest of the fit is pretty low cost so you couldn’t get it back just selling it. Maybe build a frigate for hacking, you can make 100m easily at one crystal quarry
---
nice
---
I've been running t1 and t2 darks in a navy hookbill solo. Can run t3 darks with a group of three.
---
So, tl;dr is "Bring back wardecs against new player corps."?
---
It's a bad idea because wardecs against new player corps was tremendously damaging to the game for years. It's a bad idea because it requires a tremendous amount of work from CCP and the creation of new mechanics and in-game organizations. It's a bad idea because why would CCP invest any effort into bringing that back?
---
I used it as an example for a reason. The one-sided highsec wardecs against corporations which essentially acted as social groups was entirely destructive and benefiting only a few players. The structure barrier, besides being necessary for the system of structures in highsec to work, also serves as a good marker for a corporation that is no longer just a bunch of newbies, or random people trying to play together.
---
numbers are coming back up...its not instant.
---
pirate is a blessing=free content
---
If you're in the right time zone, have done reasonable skills, can follow direction and are keen, you can still make good Isk in the one remaining high sec incursion.
---
&gt; Sell them to rorqual botters for mining
---
Fixed that for you
---
What if they like, just limited the amount of accounts you could own
---
That fit can run c2? I can make millions with my Astero, but never heard of a crystal quarry.
---
Or made to show in a static location.  Using an addon to do that in WoW helped a lot.
---
Can my fit run T2?
---
For a fit to format correctly on reddit, you need to put two spaces at the end of each line.
---
Not gonna lie, the original dev blog is from 2017 as well so it feels like an eternity until it's actually made it into the game. The takeaway from that could be that we're super bad or it could be that we're committed to delivering things even if we have to battle to find room for them no matter how long it takes. You guys decide I guess but I can see the argument either way.
---
Personally I'm happy to see this feature arrive even though it's taken a long time. I hope we continue to deliver on old promises.
---
The alliance folks didn’t set it that way, for doing zilch to defend themselves I think there are lucky to have only lost one unfueled Astrahus.
---
Bye
---
e
---
The venture is the best alpha mining ship right? Also anyone have a valid discord invite link to the server?
---
Won't work. 
---
Strippers are only fittable on Barges and Exhumers.
---
I think you overinvested with the rigs
---
sweet thanks for the info saved me like 5 mill XD
---
I don't know do you have an issue with eve players?
---
When i make errors of that type, i put trhe ship in a contract in Amarr, normally sold eventually in less than a week. You need put a message in local chat anytime you enter.
---
If I thought they were paying to have the CSM show up to completely disregard them entirely, I wouldn't have mentioned it.
---
I really hope they bring this back into the light. Too many needed differences to list though, and I can't complain because I'm unsure how to fix them. Whining isn't my strong suit
---
Top comment, friend https://discord.gg/tWeMAek
---
I was renter with you in Immensea, you an arrowbounty are nice people.
---
The problem with getting your ideas from novels is you only get the concept the author expounded upon. Yes ChAoS did what it did in the book but it was never going to translate to a reality where one can simply choose to leave. 
---
The previously chaotic loss of local made blackout a forgone conclusion, with the only difference being "on purpose" and "indefinite", that led to exponential losses.
---
Sure local should go, but so should the things that balance against it. It's a old and complicated balance that none of us understand fully, but flipping a switch was half-assed. And half-assed solutions never work.
---
Nice! Artists always have the best signatures, mine looks loke chicken scratch!
---
Yeah sure anyone, we could make a public playlist.
---
Lol, that is awesome!
---
Maybe try it on the test server
---
Try it on the test server no harm no foul.
---
You can always find this out in game by simulating a venture fit and trying to put one on it
---
Carcal won't survive in whs straight up. 
---
He will have a better chance clearing t2 abyss
---
Crystal quarry is a NS level relic site
---
With the right fit it should do fine. Not saying yours is right haven't looked at it.
---
Btw
---
Doubt
---
Sceptre Fleet has an ingame chat channel.
---
This is exactly the boat I'm in, this whole "chaos error" was horrifically executed and communicated, and until it looks like CCP has acknowledged that trying to surprised the player base with unannounced changes is a bad idea I'll be spending my gaming time and money elsewhere. To many rapid fire half thought out changes in a short period of time.
---
Shitposting in a dying subreddit devoted to a dying game. Feelsbadman.
---
Hope you guys update these when you nerf/buff ships. Would be horrible to list fits that  cannot ever be fitted (because the slots changed for example)
---
&gt;What was/is your play style?
---
Probably a semi-skilled pvp player hunting completely unskilled solo pve ratters while jerking himself off and simultaneously bragging on voice comms to alliance that he’s so elite
---
Yeah same here. These fits will be curated by our ISD volunteers who are amazing. Over time there'll be rebalances to some hulls and with each addition of new fits old ones will be reviewed. We genuinely want these to be contemporary and useful.
---
Mostly it was finding dev time to move them into the client. That's done now but now some of the originally submitted fits might be suboptimal. That's where you guys come in.
---
Wow. This was a constructive post.
---
this. they have to "earn" it by at least responding and not being a salty fucktwat
---
The best thing that you can do with this ship is repackage it, cry a little bit about your rigs, sell it, and buy a VNI instead to tide you over until you can fly a HAC.
---
So how has the new player retention been since the change?
---
Grinding for plex is an inane waste of time.
---
Makes sense to me. Guess I've just been listening to too many people bitching about how highsec is too safe. Thanks for the explanation, I appreciate it. :)
---
Pub theory crafting best theory crafting

would you rather want to hear what the dinos :tm: would like to say about the recent changes
---
&gt; non-consensual PVP
---
That's one of the cornerstones of EvE. If he doesn't like it then why play the game?
---
[A majestic pod](https://i.imgur.com/0mNzfs7.png)

The belts still take a few days to respawn even if you kill the miners.
---
I don’t know, it’s a silly term, I understand I can blown up anywhere, from my first time I lost a Catalyst belt ratting in low-sec 10 years ago, to flying into a dictor fleet in my Astero last week, this is Eve.
---
I'm sorry what?
---
That paragraph was pretty good.
---
Neat, good job.
---
Considering that EVE PvP is currently more akin to gang-rape than anything else, perhaps they've got a point.
---
That downtick looks about the time that classic released.

&gt; Member when you could see the supers in build before you nuked one in build?

never?

See I don’t get this, that group could be making more with one-two Orca and the rest in barges.

:thinking:
---
CCP give us some triglavian structures to anchor in wormhole space so we could augment/compensate positive/negative star effects
---
What was going on in 2016?
---
My opinion is that non-consensual because the defender doesn't get a choice on whether or not it happens. If someone attacks you, then you're engaged in PvP, whether you wanted it or not is irrelevant as far as the mechanics are concerned.
---
 Sheeeit
---
Like how do you nerf them more than they already are?
---
Like NS static holes are already horribly nerfed NS wandering until recently where a massive rarity because CCP nerfed them after the last round of null tears. 
---
like unless you want to remove rolling ( and that means basically killing wormhole space ), there isn't all that much you mechanically can do to make the holes shittier than they already are.
---
you've always been a big inspiration in the game for me, your art of poor videos made me love eve thanks for this one!
---
What is a HAC?  
---
I have the same problem with my  tengu that deals  650 dps and it is energy stable even with the afterburner running. I tried doing some C3s but was either about to get killed or did not make that much Isk /hr.
---
Does it stack if you put 50 of them in one system tho
---
When is the last time you shot a ratter and it resulted in anything other than blue balls or hell dunk? ( oke technically not blue balls you got a rorq or myr kill great ).
---
I just recently had a spooky situation... Did some travelling through null with "my old lady" ( I always imagine her like an old travel-bag with thousand stickers from different airports where its been. It has mined in Ammatar, Minmatar-space, Amarr-space, Querious, Branch, Deklein, Fountain and Provi so far :D ) and had to sit out about half an hour cloaked no more than 200 km away from 2 hostile dreadnoughts... Jeez, I love those moments in EVE :D

*'You will arrive at end of warp tunnel in...error...number exceeds daily downtime allotment.'*
---
Going to assume it's just one per sun.
---
So... wormhole effects generators? And what is that about Triglavians taking the system?
---
It's also accurate. These people claim to want fights but eventually they admit they just hunt krabs.
---
Say wha-? Something else to increase mining amounts? I mean, I luv me some mining, but isn’t “over mining” an issue in the game?
---
I want my interceptor to have the warp speed of a titan
---
WITH THE DPS OF ONE TOO
---
From most of my krabbing I got ore, which I turned to minerals, which I turned into ship-hulls, which I turned either into ISK or into fun... vOv  
---
Point is: EVE is no "pure PvE-game", it is neither a "pure PvP-game" and it absolutely is no arcade game. If you wanna have instant PEW with nothing else stoppping the pEW, try some MOBA.
---
I get get the idea behind the term, people just need to get over not wanting to get attacked or take measures to be able to escape the situation.
---
PBUH*
---
Warp speed reductions...wonder how that'll feel in tidi.
---
Yeah, that can take some getting used to, but I'm learning to handle it. :)
---
Bet that had you on edge lol, just goes to show a good pilot can deal with hostile situations, even in a giant industrial ship.
---
Do diamond NPC miners get a benefit out of these system boosts too?
---
Wow man that really makes all the effort feel worth it. I appreciate you saying so. Hopefully more videos to come soon.
---
Good, there are folks that refuse the truth, even in null and jspace.
---
No smack, srsly: If "just over hundred mill" is lots of ISK for you, do NOT invest it in a single ship. Especially not if you plan doing daring things with it, cause EVE gives each ship just one life. And EVE likes taking back what it gave...
---
What book?
---
I actually subbed a third account during blackout. I hope that if CCP keeps speaking to us, finds some compromise so people can kill bots, and lastly brings some sort of resource scarcity and boosts to subcapital activities. Then maybe, Newer players will come to play in sneakier small group activities (Stealing moon goo/gas through an ns wormhole, hit and lightning raids through ns wormholes). Then people will start feeling like they don't need to be part of a giant corp to be able to do anything or live.
---
They need to put up the 2007-2010 average logged in numbers.
---
Christ. The way this chart is drawn, the downward slope began *the exact same day I started playing*. What the fuck?!
---
I've always loved small-gang roaming, and the blackout was tremendous fun, as your group might just smash into another roaming group with almost no warning. That said, I completely understood the upset ratters, as blackout completely destroyed my ability to multibox a bunch of ishtars. I eventually moved to another way to make isk, but it seems that a bunch of people had the same idea, and now the market is tanking for that LP. I feel frustrated, listless, and almost paralyzed. I just don't trust CCP any longer. Massive changes, full reversal, and then the history of taking years to 'fix' things? I dunno. I kind of feel like, if a damn game is depressing me like this, maybe I just need it out of my life. Extract everything and just make a single, casual pvp character? That idea is sounding better and better
---
I have to admit, adapting isn't easy.
---
What the fuck is this shit?  4-5 subcaps, I don't care what they are, gives you enough time to drop a mobile Depot, jerk off, watch a family guy highlight video, grab a cup of coffee, and switch to corestabs and fly away.
---
The only fucking thing that can hold a carrier is a swarm of points or an interdictor.  Even then.  Switch to an armor fit, then a hull fit, and pray something escalates further before they can grind you down.
---
If you die to less than 7 points you're retarded.
---
Those who do not accept the truth will suffer it.
---
If the structures tinker with subspace and impact warp speed, a pretty straightforward wormhole system effect to manipulate is scanner probe life (e.g. launched probes consume more energy to initiate warp and disconnect if not pulled in before 10 minutes rather than 1 hour) and travel speed (make it faster or slower to scan down sigs).
---
Just looks like they're making a source for the existing Invasion effects. Before it was just "things happen because they're here" but now it's "things happen because this is here" and if you destroy it the effects go away.
---
it's PBUH  
---
  
---
[for your reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him)
---
The reintroduction of tax farms isn't all that great for eve ( this now made a come back mostly because shutting them down is now mechanically impossible ). 
---
Along with removing some many niche high-sec game styles in favor of well I have more dudes so I win. 
---
The general theme I found was that either people that don't live in high sec or run missions are trade hub campers enjoy the changes and everyone else well dislikes them like all it seems to have done is increase the bad wardecs ( aka sitting on the Jita gate and farm ) while hitting the fun wardecs small group of folks hunting miners with another nerf bat it clearly didn't need.
---
But it really doesn't shock me that almost all the people that pushed for it either have never lived in highsec or are part of a bigger wardec group.
---
Technically you mine more m3 with a t1 battleship and a full set of mining lasers. But for practical purposes, the venture is better.
---
You can have a corp, as long as you don’t anchor a station you are immune to war.
---

Works for all of them.
---
What I think is missing atm is the "space is a dirty, dangerous place, stay on your heels, know the locals, make personal contacts, have a reputation"-part.  
---
And I blame bi-blocs for it to a wide extent. And, yes, I ve been in one. And in the aftermath lots of actual gameplay felt like a chore. Dictated by someone who doesnt even know who you are or that you exist. And ppl do not join "fun games" for being treated exactly like IRL.  
---
Whatever CCP might eventually do to split up the big power-blocs into smaller entities d be welcome at mine.
---
the ishtar was the ship that really made most of my isk.
---
Its been awesome... srsly... When I saw the dreads( being there to ninja-stab a JB of the locals) moving off and the local defenders( unlikely to shoot me) appear at the gate I uncloaked and raged through the gate( with my scout at the other side). When I warped off that gate one likely cloaked baddie at that gate just said "WTF" in local :D  
---
Jeez, I felt like Han Solo on crack :D
---
Nice work!

The 2019 rolling averages do tell a happier story.

---
While it was bad for player numbers, they began to recover immediately when blackout was lifted. I am hopeful that a few months will be enough to recover from most of the damage.
---
A normal carrier has no warp core stability. A falcon, sabre and 3 Leshaks will fuck up any normal carrier hard.
---
I just got contact stoke, this kinda stuff is what I’m after.
---
Crytsal Quarry is a type of relic site that has more and better cans than any other type, only spawns in wormholes or nullsec
---
F
---
Not in the amount of time it takes to drop a mobile Depot and fit to core stabs dude.  That's the beauty of a massive ship, it can have and change to multiple fits while in combat.  
---
You should have half a dozen fits in your hanger.
---
Myrm grew on me.  When I was skilling up I found it hard to fit  when I first could fly it.   Later I'd moved on to the T3 BCs which I found easier to fit for my skill level at the time.  I could get more bang for the cost.    At one point I had moved a lot of gear into Provi just for the heck of it.   Rattled around there for a year, but really never got along with the scene there.   So When I finally decided to move out is when I found Provi was very dangerous.   Lost a lot of ships decamping the region.   At one point I was looking through  the remaining junk and realized wow...  I have a Myrm Hull and all the trimmings to build a nice one.   So I built it and tried to fly it back into HiSec...  Got jumped by a Strat who decloacked and started laying into me with missiles.   I don't think he was expecting a long range rail fit and the heavy armor tank that Myrms love.   The missiles were easily tanked, but I couldn't get close enough to him to lock him down.   When last seen he was warping to a BM 500k off the gate with 1/3rd hull.  :D   Managed to get off the gate before the rest of his posse arrived.   One of the few victories I had trying to get out of Provi.
---
Has tidi been a issue in invasion systems?
---
Give it time. Most are probably riding out the storm. But I dont expect everyone to return. CCP fked up big time on this one. They let people kick the habit and its a hard game to get back into it. Both they and a lot of others underestimate the time and effort it takes to a join a corp/make a big move in the game. 
---
And overestimate how much boredom people are willing to put up with. So I doubt the ones who just left will be back for a bit. It will certainly help if CCP actually breaks their radio silence and give us some things weve asked for.
---
I would say the opposite. The worst changes have come from CCP pandering to a small number of people on reddit who fit their confirmation bias while ignoring the experts.
---
This is working but has not been implemented yet. Thanks CCP......
---
I mean, unless he's rockin a POS....
---
The three body problem, iirc
---
No and training implants are mostly left here because they’re one of the main commodity for cashing out LPs.
---
these are not the normal invasion effects listed tho: far from it
---
Shhhhhh
---
what a wonderful painting! I'd hang it in my living room
---
john drees videos are truly the best.
---
Dude, the bots moved to faction warfare during the local outtage. The ones in null were in myrms/ishtars. They never left. Botters adapt faster then game devs, that is why they are everywhere.
---
I'm pretty sure that's your whole skill queue seb
---
You lost a bet or what made you suck dicks in public?

You're an amazing artist.

See T1 magnet facepalms, really guy's warp mechanics depend on hole numbers that the second istab is useless on level 5 and level 0 skills, why have it in there at all?

Looking at the 30day rolling average isn't going to be the best thing for a change that occurred 10 days ago.
---
Guys if Blackout is done why are all the bots still leaving?

fuggen yeeeee

&gt;structure

Lasers missing your ship always look cool as hell, but a static picture will never fully give them justice.
---
You gotta make a gfy
---
Alphas were introduced
---
You are speaking combat theory. I've been in the carrier a dozen times. I'm just telling you what would work in real world situations.
---
I actually had a billion Isk when I bought it. I’m just trying to understand CCP’s reasoning. I was looking for the scalability of starting at one point with x ship and eventually make enough Isk doing that one activity to move up to a harder more rewarding one.
---
Got it.
---
Really I think the slow spiral started when the developers were banned from playing the game. I remember when having a Dev in your corp was awesome (although most of the time you wouldn't know.) They were able to get feedback from not only the players but through experience and that made a huge difference. Now what we have is a Dev team that has zero experience of what its like to play the game. While their are some Devs that were former players they played so long ago that the game is an entirely different beast altogether.
---
And the bears now in the majority lost their shit and got the best of it reversed. OP’s point proven.
---
Do want.
---
I actually agree that the big blocs are a problem, but the fact is they are a symptom of the punishing nature of playing eve. Banding together into large groups is the only way to beat the game mechanics. Living in nullsec requires logistics, it is more efficient to have a team of logisticians than to have everyone fending for themselves. Fighting wars requires hideous amounts of man hours just to organize, plan, and FC, never mind the ships in fleet to actually get things done. Managing organizations in Eve, even small ones, requires significant IT resources. Just administering an alliance is a massive HR nightmare. All of this makes it hard for smaller organizations and provides massive incentive to combine resources into larger groups. n+1 in fleets is a thing, but n+1 in organization management is far more 
---
One thing Hilmar is right about is that maintaining large organizations is difficult, and personality conflicts act as a force to separate them. But right now the game mechanics are a more powerful force keeping groups together.
---
The way to break up the blocs is to take the tools that only the big organizations have and to build them for everyone. A few ideas:
---
* Alliance taxes and Moon taxes: The large organizations have resources to administer these without in-game support. These should be built into the game so that organizations without the IT resources and management bureaucracy can also collect the taxes.
---
* Goonmetrics: This is a tool available to Goons which tracks our market and tells importers what is needed and what is profitable to import. Improved market tools available to everyone could make it just as easy for other groups to build their own local markets.
---
* User management: Big groups all have their auth systems, tied in with their comms of choice. Smaller groups use discord which has made this step much easier but managing permissions automatically is difficult. If CCP could somehow provide or vouch for a bot that would link discord users to in-game characters and automatically add/remove people as needed, it could provide much of the functionality bigger groups take for granted to everyone. There are also countless other ways a similar goal could be achieved, and other desirable features.
---
* Corp Insurance: Rewrite the corp insurance system to act as a corp funded ship loss reimbursement system requiring less manpower to administer.
---
There's countless more things you could do, but it boils down to making the things that only the big groups can do available to smaller groups with less organizational resources.
---
&gt;Really I think the slow spiral started when the developers were banned from playing the game. 
---
Yeah, that didn't happen
---
7day rolling avg vs 30day rolling average is pretty important for a change that occurred 10 days ago.
---
This is good advice. Have an upvote.
---
I recently got one of my friends into the game and he loves it. I always encourage him to struggle and try dangerous things because there’s no better way to learn. Occasionally, I’ll give him a BPC for a ship as a reward for being adventures, but never stuff like a billion ISK. Little encouragements make strong players, but big hand outs make bored entitled ones.
---
With the freedom to play the game however you want there comes responsibility for the players. CCP can try to steer the gameplay to directions that make most obnoxious gameplay styles hard. But for example if most players decide that they want to use local intel as a tool to watch netflix while doing afk pve activites then we are fucked.
---
Stealth + PVE don't match. If you want hams + covops + pvp go neut legion, if you want rapid lights/arty + cloaky + pvp go loki, if you want hams + pve  go tengu. If you want to smartbomb people on the rancer gate use a machariel, or a really really blinged proteus
---
Tell that to all the nulli ded-gu's.
---
It’s called a “Destructible Triglavian Structure” so i assume you can destroy it and stop the effects
---
&gt; Hunters act as content to remove some tedium of PvE/mining.
---
lmao how far would your head have to be up your ass to believe it
---
highseccers
---
I fly a carrier every day.  I fucking crab in amamake dude.  It's easy as shit, just carry multiple fits.
---
Ya first thing I thought was PvP based of the title lol. I don't know quite as much about mitigating dmg in null. 
---
I use a cloaky Loki for C3 sites. AB, hams, x type xlarge shield booster. Stable and can tank and put decent dps out.
---
I think you might be blaming CCP for wrong reasons. You might have done few errors when buying and fitting that ship. Might have chosen the wrong tool for the job. You don't go cutting trees with a hammer.
---
I get it’s HS, but why not have a lot less ISK on grid and mine faster?
---
Two Orca, 4 command bursts, all the barges dump to the Orca, Orca take turns dumping to stations for compression/refinement?
---
Enjoy.
---
You are patient zero!
---
Another stupid question:
---
I'm thinking of getting into station trading, would it be smarter to start out in a smaller hub like Amarr rather than Jita?
---
Mate you might be right but don’t forget that there is a lot of way to play eve, some will stick to FW, othera to incursion, others to mining expedition and others for mission. They are all fun to do. See? I am in null with sov warfare but I really miss the incursion fleets and roaming lowsec and etc... null isn’t all that eve has to offer
---
Agreed that did not happen. I know plenty of Devs who are very active in game. One thing that I really love about CCP dev's is their passion for the game.
---
Forgive my ignorance. I thought a T1 caracal could run T3 abyssal. There something I'm missing about this fit that wouldn't punch thru abyssal site?
---
While this is a good thing, the best thing would be to make sure this has a big fucking obnoxious spot on the launcher when it is deployed so new players couldn't possibly miss it.
---
Have you tried doing that deep behind enemy lines? It might sound easy but it actually takes bit skill to pull off. Try it sometimes.
---
Because problem with comments like this is that the poster has no idea how the stuff works. I have tried ratting gamestyle and its fuuuuckiiiing booriiing. Your turn to try our gamestyle.
---
The only consistent part of the Chaos Era has been Goons posting flawed analysis.
---
Hunting krabs is legit pvp tactic. Bit like in WW2 when the u-boats hunted soft merchant ships. If you don't like it then stop krabbing and become a hunter yourself.
---
Nice
---
Bitch about nothing to do.  20 bombers show up, they drop couple supers, 10 haw dreads, some light tackle, sneering to the bombers when they run away. Bitch about 20 bombers not giving a fair fight when they drag a carrier into an inhib'ed sight with HIC tackle. "elite" pvpers for sure.
---
Blaming players for playing the game wrong is like blaming the wind for making a bridge collapse.
---
Technically it can be true but it's not the problem.
---
I actually just got the fit from an online guide. It says not to try it on tier 2 abyssal
---
never said they were playing it wrong, just stating a fact.
---
Or... 100 Titan alts?
---
Assume a tech moon(or any other resource) produces X isk per month, we expect to be able to hold it for Y months, and it's going to cost us Z isk to take.
---
If `x * y &lt; z`, then it costs more to take/hold than it is worth and so is not worth fighting over. When multiple groups bordering each other see the same results of the equation, it becomes advantageous to work together as a cartel.
---
Your "risk aversion" is just basic arithmetic.
---
There you go again thinking logically like someone who doesn't live in highsec.
---
And?
---
you are still proving the point.  the players are also to blame for the lack of fights.
---
You need serious help if a local chat blackout in a video game shattered your mental state that badly
---
To be fair there is no such thing as a "fair fight" against hot drop bombers. You either force them to leave or they kill whatever they dropped on. It's not a combat doctrine. People dropping in bombers weren't looking for a fight, they were looking for dank frags and easy kills.
---
And what good is there in winning once you're the only one left because you made everyone else quit?
---

---
2017-10-17
---
That's why they should change it before this eventuality.
---
Yes, it is the players fault for playing the game as it is designed.
---
&gt;Might have chosen the wrong tool for the job.
---
What job is the Caracal Navy Issue actually for?
---
No hate on any play style, but why not make the best ISK/hour?
---
My guess these are not the same person or corp, and are all just solo mining, then the Orca makes sense, and you can leave it a while, but god, the ROI on that must take forever.
---
I don’t mine ore or ice unless we have a corp op, then I can field two barges.
---
I do splash around for gas though, it doesn’t even feel like the same thing, what you go through to get it is way more involved, and my pair of Prospects fly away from each site with 60-100m in gas just ninja mining for 20min each.
---
Expanding on NPC sotiyos for precursor dread, maybe?
---
How has your ship not been killed?
---
You misunderstand me. They don't think logically because they don't understand. They haven't seriously thought about it. That's how they end up in situations like this.
---
Got it, sad.
---
I don’t have a lot of time to fly, I try to make the best of it so I can have fun fighting for our hole.
---
I thought I had high English literacy.
---
Thanks bro
---
Hook bills can do 4s with a group of 3.
---
It can. It just needs some bling.
---
100%. I could never. I do my c5 ratting to buy T3Cs to whelp em cus i'm shite a pvp. Mining, esp in highsec with multiple orcas? I don't get why.
---
It mentions Triglavians stealing the system, maybe this is their solution to people wanting fewer systems to compress the playerbase.
---
Trigs invade, you either stop them or the star system vanishes.
---
English is not my native. Don't hesitate to point out typos and mistakes i made here
---
People dropping supers on everyone in their space aren’t looking for a fight either, but rather dank frags.  Its two sides of the same coin here.
---
This should have been done so long ago.
---
fake news, GOON and TAPI krabbers are back in full force!
---
Now its going down as all the people who returned out of interest in the blackout and CCP shaking things up leave.  Clearly CCP has no endgame and they blinked when they removed the blackout.  The krabs rule Eve now.
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE REEEEEEEEEEE
---
I literally have zero clue - it isn't a typo or mistake - its the syntax of the sentence.
---
&gt; This completely defeats the purpose of *having* hisec. That's where you were supposed to be able to play if you don't want to PvP. 
---
Hi-sec is not meant to be safe, only safer. Id dig up some quotes for you to swallow if you'd like?
---
High-Sec is full of people who don't know what they're doing, fly excessively expensive poorly-fit ships to do relatively low-ISK things which would get faster ISK with a different ship, and it is generally not worth the effort to kill them and give an incentive to switch ships or learn how to fit/fly well.
---
Praise James. He and his noble followers have sacrificed many ships to provide that incentive.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Source: time spent in E-Uni, the campuses which do a significant amount of mining either have a lot of AFK Orca bullshit going on or are in Syndicate, where it's much easier to give people an incentive to not do this. Great corp, I'm doing my best to help the newbros figure out that the lazy-fit mission Rattlesnakes and AFK Orcas which are sometimes most of what's undocked in certain systems aren't what the game is about (when I was a newbro a few months ago, I was looking at getting into Rattlesnakes for this, but I realized that I could throw together adequate solo PVP fits and head out one gate over from the Orca orgy to do something a lot more enjoyable even though I never killed anything).
---
Yep. There blackout was sustaining eve. Fuck nullbears
---
I'd say it's a fairly even split. A lot of players just want to gank for various reasons such as tears and loot. A lot of other players, me included, hunt krabs as a way to force their alliance to fight us. Yes, it's still skilled vs unskilled players, but at least the unskilled players general outnumber and outship the skilled ones. Not unlike a zombie shooter, the challenge comes from seeing how many you can take on before being overwhelmed. We're frustrated about the state of the game because nullsec has devolved into an almost pure gank or be ganked meta; fighting a supercapital response is not possible, so the main playstyle left for roamers is to quickly gank krabs and to extract before the inevitable death by fighters and boson.
---
Miss the videos (and having time to play)
---
Bro, all your work is really well done, I hope you get your dream to do what you want, because it would appear you do it really well.
---
Who are the experts?
---
&gt; all the people who returned out of interest in the blackout
---
dozens on them
---
dozens
---
Small componies grow, but their decision makers usually don't. - I've experienced that first-hand with another gaming company. They wasted hundreds of thousands of Euros on a TV advertisement campaign that was futile, because (as they found out later) it never reached the intended target audience.
---
I think CCP is going the same way: Decisions are made based on "I created this game" mindsets and (empty) apologies are made after the fact in case of failure: the same way it was done back in 2011 with the monocle-gate. We've seen ambitious projects being pushed - and fail again and again and again. Ever wondered why nobody stepped in to stop this waste of resources?
---
There is no learning curve for the decision makers, because their "brain-child" has never really caught up with reality and they hardly ever get negative feedback from their staff upon failure: In contrast, Eve Online players have realized and adapted to changes fairly quickly and know quite a bit about the product "Eve Online" in its current state. But the choices they have are limited. One of which is to simply abandon the game to never return....
---
Um. I'll argue since I was here from 04 until 16 and just returned in 18. PVP "leet" used to heli dick with Caps anyone and everyone and tell all to HTFU and adapt or die long before it got thrown back at them when they didn't adapt.
---
If blue loot is such easy ISK, why don't you prove it: move into a wormhole and document how much more ISK you'll end up making for a month before moving back to whichever NullBloc you feel like?
---
I think he meant t2 abyssals. I would not take that ship into wormhole space
---
Take 3 hawks + 2 mates = dank isk.
---
T5 is really good fun if ran with some people, money is half decent too.
---
Well done, Geo.

Player Unknown's Battle Haven
---
I have to admit, soon after I started flying again I lost a fresh PVP fit Thorax to James’s followers that I was autopiloting out to LS from Jita
---
At first I was frustrated, but I learned to avoid that situation, that was the day I learned warp to 0km was a ting now.
---
Then the other day I needed some mods to turn my VNI into a blaster brawler, I took a naked Venture and empty clone out of my cozy hole to Jita.
---
I should not have been flying that night for two reasons, and fell asleep at the helm, woke to the sound of a hull alarm and sure enough I was in Jita, in a fresh medical clone.
---
It was then I understood the PURPOSE of James’s faith, clean up, without them HS would be littered by trash and lifeless ships.
---
I don’t share the faith, but I now accept it as necessary, if not inconvenient in our worst times.
---
At least it was a PVP fit. You were doing something right.
---
Is it just me or is this right here a better post than all the "you guys bot because i saw wrecks in a system but the guy got away" or "eve is dying because everyone wont cater to my playstyle" posts, this is just a  simple interest in the game.
---
No it wont work btw, the module is simply not compatiable with the venture.
---
I had just started flying again, joined a random LS “all-around” corp, I didn’t know what to do yet, so I just decided I was going to try to kill everything that could shoot back in that system.
---
Lost a lot of ships, lol, then one day this dude popped out of a wormhole that opened up in system.
---
I proceeded to feed the guy a few frigs and a destroyer before following him into the hole he came from.
---
I was all like WTF is this? He told me a bit about jspace, they invited me to their corp, but I joined a jspace corp the next day and that’s been my thing since.
---
can we please queue guns to fire after they've reloaded?
---
i don't mind having to manually turn my guns back on, but the fact that i can't just queue it kinda pisses me off a lot.
---
this
---
Seriously would pay for a Cane in this style.
---
If you can’t even tell them what the problem is then you shouldn’t say anything.
---
That's totally what I said
---
You need help with reading comprehension and critical thinking
---
I’m currently the CEO of a small corporation I made for tax avoidance. I am now leaving to join another Corp, but want to keep my alt in it, to keep my Corp open. Will CEO automatically revert to my alt as the only person left? Thanks!
---
Good
---
what would make sense is that ships are not counted as import/exports anymore.
---
that would explain that all of eve see a significant drop in import/export volume
---
maybe unpackaged ships are not counted as import/export anymore. that would explain why the drop is persistant through new eden and stays low after the fact
---
pve is like gambling vs having a job.
---
a few bad losses gambling and you're in a tough hole to dig yourself out of.
---
having a job means you might never own a ferrari but it doesn't matter because you've always got enough money to fill your spare time with fun shit.
---
People can can make billions a week risk free with null sec local, yet why do they get upset when they have to actually risk their ship in a blackout? 
---
It's sad this game has become all about isk and no more risk. Inject a toon and never put in the time and effort. 
---
But hey, what do I know. I guess I'm not that into ship skins. Looks like that's all the new content y'all be getting.
---
but there is only one star named sun in the whole universe
---
I disagree, yes it should.
---
&gt; yet why do they get upset when they have to actually risk their ship in a blackout?
---
i don't know - maybe because at that level of risk it isn't worth their time in the slightest since literally every alternative is better?
---
Wow, your very good.
---
Did exactly the same thing.
---
and a titan ))
---
If you find the answer to that question, let me know. I’d like to listen to people who actually know what they’re talking about, because they’re sure as hell not on Reddit!
---
So like I said... they want zero risk. If they can't 100% avoid conflict it's not worth it. That's a player issue, not a game flaw. I was fine in the blackout. Many were. They adapted ships to make a loss less of a pain. They just didn't bling out a faction modded ship knowing full well a red dot in local is all they need to safe up. 
---
Many didn't belong in null to begin with, and should have simply moved to low or high sec.
---
Angel titan when?
---
Miss you too bud.
---
:) thanks man. Glad to hear people are enjoying this one, it felt a little underwhelming because i only had the duration of the blackout to capture recordings. Anyway, I'm hoping to start some new series soon. Thanks for watching o7.
---
I only wish I had some smooth UK accent lol. But I appreciate the sentiment.
---
Teraflops???
---
I think tera-flops. Which is a real measure of computational power
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS
---
did you trace it first?
---
&gt;20m/hour tops
---
With skills 200m/hour tops in hisec. People just can be getting tired of risks and constant loss.
---
Much of null has pretty safe space. Thank the blue on blue waves for that. With local back, the latest technique has been for hostiles to fly friendly "spy alts" ahead to scout. So blue ships travel through, get your location, and then a hostile jumps in and warps right to you. 
---
Now I'm not a game designer, but if that's the best way to find a target then something is wrong. The blackout worked in my opinion. Those who stayed in null adapted and took on the added risk. We had small fleet roams back. Bots moved and left. But the player base dropped and the Goons whined the loudest. 
---
I don't get it. CCP caved. Given more time and some adjustments, Eve would be better off, but a full on reversal just fails. Now people are complaining about cynos. I expect that to be reversed soon.
---
They are green, and also free from oppression
---
please stop.   
---
1) fw isk making =/= 0.0 isk making  
---
2) the 3 major bot programms that are being sold, could not function in 0.0 blackout, they are local based to auto-configure and run. Only custom made ones were able to read from multiple screens.
---
Yeah let's leave it up to packet loss and your country of origin and random chance
---
Except when you don't and retreat instead.
---
Correct but don't complain when the soft targets bring destroyers to destroy uboats. Or in eve terms don't be shocked when ratters bring capitals to stop you from hitting soft targets. I don't have a problem with people hunting krabs, it's when they get mad people bring overwhelming force to stop them.
---
No they aren't looking for frags they are looking for you to leave their space.
---
Same here, I just can’t put time in a game where I don’t know if it will exist tomorrow or not
---
Wormholes are pretty great. I suspect that before the end of the year, I'll be trying to join a wormhole corp.
---
Unless you want to invest in a second account this is the best you can do, or try harder to find a corp.
---
them not returning and non-bloc pvp players realizing who ccp is listening to, bb eve.
---
&gt; With skills 200m/hour tops in hisec.
---
What is that activity? I'm sorta out of the loop, but we're talking about people running mining barges. That wasn't going to get you much more than 20 mil/hour back when I was playing.
---
Well don't think that pirate want to fight people that can fight back.
---
They are really happy to farm people with bling ship and logi cloack or on the other side of a gate but as soon a there is a risk they will dock.
---
What are you doing now?
---
Obviously I endorse WH life, but I like anyone that uses them for travel and daytripping.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
WH ratting in solo unplayable. You will loose more that farm. Just do lvl 4 missions in HS and learn skills for incursion sites.
---
Teraflops. It's a much better measurement of computational power.
---
Hz isn't actually very good for this, and even in the real world is only good for comparing very similar CPUs.
---
Note how in the real world, cores have increased and clock speed has reduced. The flops on these newer cards is higher but the speed is slower.
---
mice
---
Ah, very well. I thought it was just an example.
---
Oh no that thing wouldn’t survive in a c2 I’d just bring a drake or something cheap, maybe run c3s in a passive one. I was just suggesting a way to make it back, also the crystal quarries are the highest level relic sites. You want the sansha ones for the intact armor plates, they’re the best bang for your buck.
---
No.
---
Then you can too easily manage situations like pointing Marauders coming out of bastion with no actual skill or awareness.
---
None of them are asking for a fair fight or bitching that they have nothing to do, they bring that level of ships to make you fuck off.
---
If someday I will get second acc how can I help my main? Just sit semi afk near wh entrance? I don't know much about using multiple accounts
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
yeah you are so smart and educated that you don't even need to use punctuation.
---
Aren't purger rigs normally better than extender rigs? For passive fits?
---
I spend some time operating out of E-Uni's C2, doing stuff out of there (which is generally either krabbing the C3 static or assault frigate PVP, sometimes moving up to a Brutix doctrine, significantly more rarely a Sacrilege doctrine which most of us actually don't have the SP to fly). Otherwise, I'm generally either killing Triglavians, getting killed in solo Low-Sec roams, or sometimes showing up to mining fleets (High-Sec mining is really boring with barely any ISK but having a few beers and talking with friends, getting a little bit of ISK for almost no effort, is a lot of fun). So I already know a fair bit about wormhole life, I'm more thinking that I'd move to a corp which is primarily wormhole rather than one which owns a wormhole but most members are HS carebears (and probably higher class than C2).
---
&gt;disconnect if not pulled in before 10 minutes rather than 1 hour
---
Oh that would be a PITA.
---
That is where analogies with real world stop working. Eve is a game. Easy "I win" buttons shouldn't be possible.
---
Also this becomes huge problem if players always drop capitals on top of subcaps and forget how to pvp in subcaps. FC's stop getting training. Quality of playerbase starts to drop. Soon only small minority of players remember how to actually fight. Players start quitting because content creators have stopped doing stuff. Both subcap AND capital pvp should be in healthy state for Eve to continue being fun.
---
there is one conclusion to all this, if game is safer and loss free the line will go up and ccp/kakao/pa all 3 respectable companies will earn more money.
---
And have overheat persist when modules are turned off.
---
Blitzing L4 missions can be around 200m/hour, but you are absolutely right about mining, it can be even below 20 in hisec.
---
Teraflops. Units of a trillion calculations per second. It's actually a pretty sensible way to measure CPU amount when you think about it.
---
I have never heard of twink used in this context. What gaming communities do you come from?
---
Anyway, to answer your questions, only a bomber can instantly lock after decloaking, a Loki will have about 3 seconds before he can start locking.
---
If you are aligned an attentive that is more than enough to warp out.
---
One thing you skipped over was scanning down the chain. You should go see what the current chain is like elsewhere in the pipe.
---
Yesterday I was in my c3 and it had a c2 connection. I had an extra character park on that hole to watch it. Had I scanned it down I would have seen it only connected to HS, meaning it was unlikely anyone was going to come my way and I'd only really have to worry about any new wormholes appearing in my system.
---
Your ship is cheap, so it will pay for itself in 5 sites, which should barely take an hour.
---
I do the same
---
 But in J-space.
---
So I have combat ships in my orca and I keep it cloaked up at a safe.
---
That requires active management.
---
It doesn't have to be a russian corp if you're good with english :) Make some friends!
---
You're missing the most important thing about wormholes - hole control. After you get in the hole you scan everything and close holes you don't need. Rolling praxis is the cheapest and can be flown with brand new toon. That should be your 2nd account.
---
When you are leaving you will select a CEO.
---
Of Boone has the leadership skill, then you can select anyone.
---
That is so coool!!Why dont you just sell them??For isk and for Money!!!
---
I use 35M Caracal and can do 80% T3 sites then RIP. Since it's 80% I'm isk negative overall
---
Depends.
---
You won't have to update your orders AS often, but volume is much lower.
---
*invasions
---
[removed]
---
You should set up a pos in a c3 with lowsec static, roll the k162s with a higgs battleship, then roll your static and don’t warp to it or scan it. It won’t open by itself for 4 hours I believe, but I never risk it more than 2.
---
Not just a mining boost, but a drop in warp speed giving Miners longer to get off grid before a potential hunter lands. This is a bad combination of effects.
---
Haha, you think t5 abyssals are 20m/hour tops. Cute.
---
Are they worth doing? How hard are them? Can I do them w/ 930 dps praxis with 63% all resistances and 258 shield/sec without implants and boosters?
---
Ofc they wanted low risk, since the pay out is piss poor.
---
I wouldn't bother with any appreciable risk for the piss poor isk you get anom ratting in a subcap
---
Thanks but im already in a great corp that help everyone out
---
I’ll give that a try.
---
Look this site, the best farm in HS http://newgalaxyage.ru
---
That means t2 can be done.
---
Cool, I applied to Eve-U but joined my current corp at the last moment.
---
Been living out of a C3, killing sleepers, exploring, and huffing gas, I like the group I’m with, real stable situation, but am wondering where the threshold to move up is, as the leadership seem real content with where the corp is.
---
With only 4.5 million sp I would advice you flying a explo Gila. You are doing DED site with it and you can get a pretty good amount of isk out of it and you can get decent skills with it fairly fast except to skill into a bs.
---
Yea, that’s what is comes down to I think.
---
If I had billions of ISK to spend on ships and modules then I’d sure as hell be doing PvP whenever the opportunity arose. What the hell else would I use it for, if not funding more opportunities to have fun?
---
nice job being an asshole
---
Unfortunately my speaking English is too bad to actually speak in voice chat.
---
Regarding closing holes - is it possible to do solo with praxis? Assuming average c3 max mass that can be transported closing it solo using a single battleship looks like it takes hours to do isn't it? And how can know which holes do I need and which I don't need? Is there any kind of "strategy" I don't know about?
---
Killing frigates
---
2 dozens to be exact, it was worth those 5 thousand ~online~ krabs.
---
Do you not understand how rolling averages work?
---
What’s funny is that most of these 100 man bomber gangs are usually led by other null blocks.
---
Meanwhile small gang people were still small ganging
---
Strat or T3C to scout/watch, worst case try to chase off or ECM the attacking ship.
---
Or train to fly dual Prax/Rattle/whatever and be more intimidating to a solo hunter, and clear sites faster, but that will probably get a whole fleet dropped on you at some point with no scout.
---
Use lazzzzzzzzzzzzz^^aap ers!
---
We can analyze all we want, but they have all the real data, I really do hope they learned something.
---
To have come back after so long it would be sad for this to be the beginning of the end.
---
Eve is very nitch, and there are very different types of players at odds with each other, and there are technical concerns with intel and automation.
---
I hope a solution and balance is found.
---
Lol and once again I say:
---
Afk/bot carrier ratting and afk/bot mining in safety in nullsec IS NOT A FUCKING PLAY STYLE. Swallow that!
---
By scouting you mean sitting at static entrance? Sorry for stupid question
---
CCP didn't respond to people 'drowning them in manbaby tears' they responded to people voting with their wallet.
---
The only tears here are from you as far as i can tell. Look i get it, i loved the blackout too. But the fact of the matter is that it didn't bring the balance that's needed and now its gone because it was hurting the game. 
---
And you aren't helping by stoking the fires of animosity between play styles. Just trying to farm some easy karma.
---
Sell it and buy better ships?
---
For reference, twinking is using a deceptive build. In eve generally it would be called bait, or something with a bait tank (lots of hull hp on a traditional armor ship) or a combat exploration ship (the Probe is really good for that).
---
What your describing is just standard alt behavior. And you really should have a scout alt for anything done in a wormhole.
---
We've been seeing actual increase in mining barge population. Which means at least some people prefer those pitiful gains over whatever else they can do in null or anywhere else. Which is what I was saying in the first place.
---
How much isk should I invest in pos? I'm not so rich (around 1 bil atm). And how do I use and protect this pos?
---
This exactly. Proposed change is not a QoL improvement, it's handholding design at its worst
---
Yes, to watch anything coming in, although if there are more holes open I would watch the ones coming in from deeper jspace.
---
Sometimes you can’t watch everything and put the shout where dscan and cover the most.
---
I welcome it.
---
We don’t know what the actual effect on subs was though, only CCP knows what changed during it.
---
While we are at it, I'd add putting modules into that queue if they enter state which stops them running.
---
And please, ability to queue reloading charges when you do so while running module using them.
---
Or, to put it simple: reloading with 2 clicks instead of 4+having to spend time and attention to cycle timings.
---
I've been asking for that for years.
---
I’d just bring a small one and a container for storage that way you’re not risking much and they unanchor fairly quickly (15 minutes or so I think) 
---
Shouldn’t cost you much more than 100 million and another ~60 million for the passive drake depending on the fit you go with.
---
If marauders are a problem, change marauders instead of relying on interface to make its pilot fuck up.
---
Thanks!
---
Haha..
---
They may get some players back if they roll the cyno changes back. They won't do any good with the playerbase decreasing as it is.
---
Now it makes sense to me, thanks a lot!
---
No, they never said how long it would or wouldn’t last.
---
The drifters came and wrecked some stuff, now they’re gone(?), and local was restored, and according to the Scope the SCC can’t guarantee the stability in the future.
---
It didn’t present any challenges that haven’t already been overcome by people that live in jspace, and possibly gave CCP the data they need to disrupt intel bots.
---
You really want to get stuff moving, kill asset safety and vulnerability periods, and no reinforcement for low power stations.
---
It's possible, although it takes some time with only 1 praxis. [Use this chart until you're good with rolling theory](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/257276494357856256/567825338118176778/rollholes.png)  
---
Let's say you've got 2bil hole. To close it you need 4 passes (1 pass = 2 jumps, in and out). You'll have to wait polarization timer 3 times (last pass you close the hole), which gives a minimum of 15 minutes spent to roll this hole. If you have 2 rolling ships you only need to wait 1 timer, which redices rolling time to min 5 minutes.
---
Ideally you want to have 0 holes and unopened static (scan new one after rolling but don't warp). You could leave 1 connection and have a scout on it.
---
Just test it in pyfa.
---
They aren't the problem.
---
There are lots of situations where having a module magically turn on once it can is hand holding at best.
---
Pointing while burning to catch, or webbing.
---
No, if you need to press the button again when it will work.
---
You cant just approach scram and then have it automatically do it once it's in range.
---
I was just using Marauders as an example. Part of the bastion strategy with preventing pointing his exactly that chance to have someone forget to repoint once you drop bastion, or forget the scram and they mjd away.
---
So warp in and have bubble automatically go up?
---
Instantly apply cloak when warping in or decloaking off gate?
---
Right
---
Yeah, broken.
---
i mean, people pay 100's times more for a small bonus from t2 to faction....dont think twice.
---
paying 100x more than faction for the same improvement again if just as efficient.
---
i know what your saying. but you keep reinforcing your belief that those little improvements arnt worth it, when they are, its just alot of isk to splode
---
I agree with your points.  Eve to me needs a road map, you need it to plan your training accrodingly.  Nothing positive has come out the age of choas.  In eve the saying goes adapt or die, but how can you adapt in this game if the game is one way one week and different the next.  Even frigate 5 takes over a week to train :D
---
Or you can join a russian-speaking WH corp. A bit like mine, and we have a C3 static like you might be interested too :P
---
Love it.
---
I have put “wait and see” into my request to suspend my Omega year ago.
---
Active tanked ships (shield booster/armor repper) don't necessarily have to be stable with everything running.        
---
You do need the AB running to speed tank, but only hit the booster when the cycle doesn't waste energy in over reps.      
---
This applies more so to shield than armor reppers, because armor is that much less forgiving when it comes to surviving a short dps burst.
---
Doing that frees up room for more dps, resistances, speed or range. Whatever is best for the job.
---
Because you're a good player and have already got your settings sorted out.
---
you are arguing with a goon about isk making, dont do that
---
Because it's the closest things to botting you can get away with. ISK\\hr isn't amazing but who cares if you get that ISK\\hr even if you're asleep?
---
While we're on the subject. You can shield tank with midslots, lowslots and rigs. But you can only armor tank with low and rigs...
---
Fix the imbalance ccp.
---
Well PushX prices in LS went up from the cyno change, and since a few weeks ago I feel like my corp’s hole has been swiss cheese, I’m not complying at all, more gas and relics for me.
---
Think of the sweet money they made having half of EVE inject into trig ships, rorquals and overpowered supercaps. 
---
Just don't buy injectors if you don't agree with it. You can actually play the game without them.
---
Don't think it will... I don't have the tool tip issue either... Come to think about it, I've never seen a tooltip, other than when hovering over my modules in space.
---
The real question is why they keep accepting the invitations. Its a real simple "Would you like to die now? Y/N?"
---
And they kept clicking yes.
---
Funny is that i just finished to building up my cyno ships ^(like this took a fucking while)       
---
During this time i didn't subbed some of my accounts as ... why if i cannot due some stuff due to cyno changes.     
---
This costed me a shitload of money and time.          
---
While i know that cyno changes are bad to game i would be so pissed if they reverse it now due to fact how much cost me just to **adapting to the change**        
---
This is one of EVE main problems that changes require a lot, like a lot of work from player side.
---
Since CCP bumping changes freighters stopped to die in higsec ... now mostly new rats kill them.             
---
[This](https://zkillboard.com/kills/freighters/) is not sustainable by higsec economy in long run.            
---
Gankers/pirates ^(whatever you want to call them) removed trillions of goods /month.           
---
Now we no longer have this huge sink that also created a lot of work for industrialists.
---
You mean botting ventures?
---
Ok now we just need a different frontpage post saying "Don't assume new players want advice, many want to explore the game on their own and not be told how to play #notallnewplayers." and we'll be gucci.
---
That's not about isk though, that's just the toxicity of the game.
---
You're thinking align speed. Warp speed matters once you're already off grid.
---
Great picture, set as a desktop picture, thank you.
---
Work is good, if nothing blows up no one will need to buy anything.
---
I standed down when i realized ccp is not willing to do drastic changes anymore to save or instant kill the game rather than let it bleed slowly.
---
Flair checks out. PVE isn't gambling, you have insurance ffs. 
---
And what about a poor working PVPer, they have to find the damn krabs and set it up. You seem to ignore that cost completely.
---
How am i supposed to be a f1 monkey  then ??? Do you really expect me to actually put some effort into this game???
---
I can only see cancer and cancer accessories. Clickbait.
---
Maybe in max tidi, but for day to day fleeting i actually like this.
---
I like very much yes
---
Good luck trying to coordinate targets in a non tidi battle. We've done this in Max tidi with DDs, so pretty much endless time and it was still aids. Good luck doing that in lets say a 500vs500 low tidi  brawl
---
Reduced warp speed means decelerating out of warp takes longer. Miners will have slightly more time between “that guy id showing up on grid” and “that guy can lock me”.
---
I use a dual small shield tengu, thing tanks like a boss, small outlay but you make it back in a day.
---
Solo eve gameplay is boring, especially in WH space. Unless you're the specific kind of people who doesn't tolerate other people, i'd suggest joining a corp. English corps won't mind your accent, and you'll get better at speaking.   
---
If you decide to solo: 
---
\- setup a raitaru in an empty c2-c3/hs, fuel it. Upcost of \~700mil, but its worth it. Provides endless c3 farms and an easy way out for getting the loot out.
---
\- it will provide you with relic/data sites within your c2, plus you'll be able to run c2 sites until you get used to it enough to run c3. Plus a safe spot to drop your loot.
---
\- learn to roll your c3 static, you'll be able to pick the c3 you want (more quiet, bigger, more sites, etc.)
---
To stay alive in wh, in general: 
---
\- scan the system you're planning to farm in, check its connections, if you have time close, or are afraid of losing your ship close them.
---
\- try to farm in bigger systems, bigger - less chance you'll be d-scanned in a single go, and more chance for the hunter to drop probes before they'll see you.
---
\- bookmark a safe spot. When you see an enemy don't warp to any wh, you'll get caught.
---
\- spam d-scan, non-stop, watch out for probes, watch out for new connections. 
---
\- fit a disruptor/scram and a grappler to your ship, if a single t3 tries to go on a praxis, you can try to blap it, due to high dps. 
---
\- get friends.
---
Solo rat with alt on every entrance
---
Intel bots are the dumbest urban legend of this subreddit. There are no Intel bots besides mar5hy and his alts up in deklein as far as I have ever seen. Goons most definitely did not run something like that, we just had 10+ people in every system, at least one is not lazy enough to not report you. Same for TEST, INIT, phorde...  
---
The actual botters, the ones who make and sell isk and shit, who are indeed everywhere, were stopped for a couple weeks. But maybe you took a break from this sub, because there were several people who saw new myrmidon/dominix bots, with pod scouts sitting on gates. If disrupting bots was the intention, blackout was a failure. If it was to stir content, it was a slight success for a week, then all the regions besides delve and wherever TEST are deployed rn died. Did you look at adms or go roaming in deklein, provi, catch a couple weeks ago? Dead systems everywhere, maybe a couple ratters per region, no response anywhere. I wanted to believe in blackout, but it was a colossal failure no matter which way I look at it.
---
Correct.
---
Why 2007-2010?  I remember when it was 2,500.
---
&gt; although most of the time you wouldn't know
---
Sure you would.  It's the guy with the Cap Recharger II BPO.
---
This is me, lmao.
---
I don’t get it. I went to school and worked for side cash. If you have time to grind out isk in game, dont you have time to put in 3-4 hrs a day at McDonald’s?
---
So eve is dead? :D
---
It’s a negative feedback loop. At some point it collapses on itself if the game only attracts hyper krabs who don’t know what’s good for themselves.
---
Unfortunately I had a major crush with work through most of the blackout, so I didn’t have a chance to roam null a lot, I’m a bit upset it ended.
---
But why where they dead, that’s what I want to know?
---
Was it risk aversion? 
---
I don’t get it, my corp has 12 people on, in a good day, and we can secure and control our and any neighbor systems and do whatever we want and catch whoever comes through.
---
 
---
With so many folks in null why can’t y’all have scouts on every gate, you have infinite combat anoms to farm, you can pay people to scout, and you still have caps, even if they are a little harder to jump now (thank Bob).
---
I really want to know, what made the blackout SO bad for null?
---
broken??
---
It just safes you from hammering that one button like mad for bubble/cloak/etc.etc.
---
You specifically did not answer the very direct question I asked.
---
Why it’s always about playing in nullsec against nullseccers? Aren’t new players have the whole game to play?
---
Boo hoo
---
A wealthy nullsec system e
---
How does it compare to a similar Tengu?
---
I do an A type large on the tengu and that handles the sites well enough, but you do have to manage transversal.
---
Ham cloaky Tengus are pretty strong though
---
Was this during the free skill point give away that they used to mask their own numberS?
---
CCP starting something, making a big deal about it, half-assing it and then abandoning it like it never happened.
---
I'm shocked.
---
Hammering cloak is going to get you killed from a double hit.
---
Timing is important.
---
We shouldn't have the game made in such a way that people can't even make mistakes.
---
You understand that these are the numbers while having all the Serenity migrated here. Imagine the actual numbers without em.
---
I remember the days when Officer mods were a lot more common than X-types. Wish CCP would go back to those days.
---
You don't need to buy, build or mine anything.         
---
People only see freighers but all ship involved in kill also died to concord, with half of the modules on them.          
---
Like this is also gone ... wait , no the other way around - this materials also now stay in game and will need to be sinked by already crashing economy.
---
You might want to look up chaos in a dictionary
---
Yes my fits tend to be CPU tight and were working only with implants.
---
this should go on r/eveporn
---
Really pretty :)
---
It's a matter of how spawns are handled.
---
Officers spawn rarely and aren't influenced by consumption.
---
But signatures actively respawn to maintain a density across the region.
---
So more explorers means more ded sites.
---
More officer hunters won't increase the amount of officers spawning.
---
Solid work!
---
If current EVE shut down and CCP or PA will try to release EVE II , like how many players will start again  ?             
---
Assuming that majority players will move.     
---
What issues it will solve?           
---
Will person in NC join new Goon group or will Goon members move in different places ?       
---
90% no because you play with friends and if you will still want to play you will want to still play with them.
---
r/eveporn worthy
---
It feels to me as if the "Chaos Era" was Hilmars last hurrah... but it was bad for player retention and they had to reverse most of it (drifters/blackout). Now Hilmar just does not care anymore before he will finally leave at the end of October (maybe, see bonus deal with PA), so nothing more will happen. After he is gone  what will happen i dont know, probably even CCP does not know right now (apart from NewPlayerExperience)...
---
I know what Chaos means, but we got information how 'Age of Chaos' will look like :             
---
&gt; Hilmar: "We want you on your toes, we want you to feel like the blanket is being pulled from under you every single week, your heart rate is going up, you need to take stress medicine to keep focused, that is the chaos era, and it is on".             
---
Do you feel stressed with the current 'Age of Chaos' changes or annoyed by them?          
---
Do we see weekly iterations that have such effect as stated above?
---
Have 5 regions dark at a time with some drifters mucking about, would be a great compromise.
---
Incursion like sites and no local, would be a playground for pvp and pve
---
You do realize that Goonswarm being the way they are today is primarily the fault of the players, right?
---
Signatures and anoms use to spawn once and only after DT. Hence why office were more common. Ore anoms didn’t exist and you went to the belts for ore. This great increased your chances of running into a officer. Density wasn’t an issue back then nor will it be now. It lowers the isk skink thus increasing it value. Spawning anoms and having some escalate is why the game is over saturated in pirate ships, isk, and resources.
---
I remember the days when officers mods were more common than X types.
---
Oh, I remember the days where you only needed to rat a day or two, buy a month of game time, stash some isk away for ships and fittings, spend the rest of the month pvping.
---
THIS GAME NEEDS MORE MINING YIELD
---
said noone
---
PocketsDK has videos on the CNI for abyssals on youtube, alpha friendly
---
Abyssals dont need anything except a ship. Doing them in hisec is the "optimal" way of playing. Zero assets on the field in structures, no commitments etc...
---
Blackout made you an idiot if you stayed to live in null (if it was gonna be permanent)
---
Wtf are you on about, I have to buy or build everything I use, someone had to mine, refine, or react the stuff everything is made of.
---
I know how suicide ganking works, what is your point?
---
The economy doesn’t feel like it’s crashing, see recon ships, huge spike with blackout and cyno changes, then it reacted and level out, that’s a T2 cruiser, lots of little bits to build, if things weren’t ok, the price wouldn’t have gone back down, or the demand would have caused every T2 ship to go up and the price would not have recovered.
---
The best reward/investment ratio I know is in WH with some cheap T1 explo frigates or a venture (even better in C5/C6)  
---
However it's also high risk activity. If you know how to do it's very rewarding.  
---
Years ago, I make my first B with a stabed imicus, diving into WH from HS where I lived  
---
As a WH veteran, a major part of my income come from gas and relics, just like when I was a newbros (but today, with an optimized setup)
---
Lice
---
NUUN is recruiting
---
Make it april 1st, that way more people think its a joke hehehe
---
Better to be a carebear than a f1 monkey
---
So they don’t have to interact with anyone else and to get back to stacking isk in isolation?
---
With the Loki's worse resists it's the easiest way to get similar results as the tengu. Still reps a bit over 800 dps and puts out at least 600 to throw basic numbers off the top of my head. I put a range rig so it hits out further since no range bonus. 
---
 Definitely modeled to do the job of a tengu at a healthier price. Was a lot cheaper when I made the fit but is still less then a bill. 
---
Might chech it out on sisi and see how it does.
---
No kink shaming.
---
Im thinking of starting playing again, I havent been playing for like a year. have I missed alot?
---
I agree, but I think it should be very short. Like a half second tops. Enough to smooth out activations, but not enough to ignore timing when activating your modules.
---
Are you replying to the wrong post?  I didn't say it wasn't.
---
Was probably confused...it being a "grrr ccp" thread and all.
---
The very fact that an overwhelmingly unstoppable force can be dropped on undesirables is the crux of the problem for many. It’s no surprise that you want to defend your space, but you’re advocating for the odds to be laughingly tilted in your favor, bordering on an I win button. 
---
The reality is that these directly conflicting play styles are hard to balance. Hunters want their play style to be viable, and krabs want the hunting play style to be eliminated - coming directly from you with very little reading between the lines.
---
I'm not in null anymore, but I get what you mean. Honestly, I'm wondering the same. Goons are huge, their space remained fairly active AFAIK. But all the other major alliances are, well, major. Aka big. I wish I could tell you why it was that bad but I honestly don't know.
---
I think it's okey to give money directly IF
---
\- they need it right away to do something they want
---
\- they just lost a ship, and you simply replace it (give about the cost, not much more)
---
\- give them money for something they do. (shows that there are a lot of ways to earn isk, especially when it comes to player interaction)
---
I can assure you that each Goon has at most a dozen "friends".  And, moreover, the strength of Goons is the out of game management infrastructure, i.e. tools not coded by CCP and not available to any group that wants to form as a consequence.
---
He decided to graduate from high school instead of playing eve or something similar.
---
No
---
So me and my 15 goonies can camp out your Gila?
---
Yeah, I just toyed in Pyfa.
---
I do it with just 470dps tank.
---
But I run a scram and web on my tengus, so I don't need to refit for pvp.
---
800dps outbound with rage to 24km, and like 500+ with javelin to 40km.
---
But I do run a mid grade crystal set (with low grade omega). Fit is only around 1b, plus the 500m for implants.
---
Rating without scoot is preaty challenging, but le danger can be lowered :  
---
everything about seting up a pos or a raitaru or join a corp is right, but I'm not sur it's what you are looking for.  
---
choise a C3 with few connexions, 2 max (including a Kspace) imo. Kspace hole are not realy dangerous, NS/LS guys rarely try to kill a WH krab and when they try, they are less sneaky than WH people. easier to you to spot them and run away.  
---
if you know your neighbours and no agressiv people living there, ignore all the signature in your C3. you will see if a new signature are poping, it's maybe a new hole with new neighbour. a potential threat  
---
drop a mobile depot next to you when killing sleeper. if someone tackle you, refit with stabs or MJD and GTFO  
---
About the alts, they are heavily usefull in WH. but thanks to Skill Injectors they can cost almost nothing. Skill an alpha acount until you hit the 5.5M SP limit, then use it as SP farm. with a good remap and a couple of +3 implants, it cost you ~200M_isk/month but he doesn't skill up  
---
Good luck =]
---
The only thing that is annoying are the constant CCPLZ posts on this sub.
---
The local changes definitely had the effect stated above, even though it was mostly out of game, because you can't force people to log in.
---
Can’t wait for Falcon to come here and say that real chaos should be truly unpredictable lol got you get fucked, hope you’re enjoying it. 
---
Also you’re StainGuy you’re not allowed to post things that make sense. I’m shocked mods let that one through, now look all the mess it is.
---
&gt; Skill an alpha acount until you hit the 5.5M SP limit
---
Alpha stop training at 5m, and you thne have to get to 5.5m before you can extract.
---
To be the butt of jokes...you wanted the Osprey Navy or better yet a Gila, the Caracal Navy is a terrible ship with no redeeming features whatsoever, I'd tell you to sell it but it looks like you dropped more on it in rigs than the hull is worth :/ Oh well, now you know.
---
~~alts~~ friends are op
---
Dudes..... I always thought the number represents now many 286 16Mhz chips are installed on particular ship.... Was I wrong throughout my entire EVE career?
---
I was talking about number of people who preferred to mine in hisec in barges to staying in null or whatever they were doing.
---
I'm not even saying it was the majority or anything, just the fact there were such people.
---
When you think about it, claims that those were AFK accounts/bots feel more substantiated.
---
I check here hoping for dreadbombs and political drama. Haven't played in years.
---
From what you say I understand that you bought this fit as an upgrade for another ship in which you've run abyssals. I would assume you used a normal caracal before. While the caracal navy issue is an upgrade to the caracal it's not that much better for abyssals (and also in general). The logical upgrade from a caracal in abyssals is an gila. A cheaply fitted Gila can run T2 abyssals and usually also T3. (proper effects of course.) Blinged Gilas can go up to T5 (again for the right weather). So you did a bad investment. Cut the losses and switch to an gila for the abyss if your skills are in caldari cruiser and light missiles.
---
Maybe. Tbh it doesn't make sense for them to be anything but AFK accounts / bots. Something people were, on a side note, fiercely denying when it was convenient.
---
But eh. Getting into arguments on blackouts merits and sins wasn't my intention. Given options available to people, staying in null at the time feels rather pointless except maybe keeping PvP alts / clones there.
---
And when you dock/jump
---
You gonna make us happy and enslave us in your sandbox? CCP must pay for this year Era of chaos.
---
From my point of few if you can stop playing for a month you will feel relive and lose all interest in EVE online "Invasion" BETA testing.
---
Oof.
---
Cool thanks :)
---
It might be valuable for CCP to consider the points made in [this Game Developers Conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_5S55jUzk).
---
Increasing the risk without increasing the reward is just going to make people leave. CCP did this, don't try to turn it on the players.
---
Go Character Sheet -&gt; Interactions -&gt; Combat Log -&gt; Losses. Here you should see the details, including your fit. Alternatively, browse your notifications for the killmail.
---
It's less minig yield, not more. Cycle time bonus, so adds to cycle times.
---
you missed the bus  
---
that time is over
---
&gt; We don’t know what the actual effect on subs was though
---
We can however make a [pretty solid guess.](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-fouryear-compro.png)
---
Well, when I was posing initial comments, I was mostly thinking about internal reasons that prevent your modules from being used regardless of what happens around you, so mostly whatever has mostly something to do with interface clunky-ness.
---
We can have an abstract argument on your examples, but it's fine to me for them to remain as they are.
---
&gt; I really want to know, what made the blackout SO bad for null?
---
I'm not going to pretend it was one thing, and I didn't have to deal with any of this myself, as I don't really do much "back home" these days, but these come to mind:
---
1) The blackout disproportionately hurt subcap ratters.  Prior to blackout, subcaps generally weren't saved by the umbrella: they relied on local and some vigilance on their part.  The main "viable" subcap ratting during the blackout was myrm ratting, and that was mostly a matter of accepting that anything out there was going to kill you and it was pointless to even worry about it, so: get as many ticks as you can before they notice you and hope you'll come out ahead (and maybe your alliance will SRP you).
---
2) It made space feel even emptier.  This is a bit more wishy-washy, but tons of players aren't gathering together to feel alone in space.
---
3) There are easier ways to make isk that don't involve being in space.  I suspect some players just moved to those activities, because why not?
---
&gt;and you still have caps, even if they are a little harder to jump now

Even before the cyno changes, subcaps weren't really worth trying to save.  Chances are you wouldn't land in time.  Post-cyno changes, that expands to normal caps:  carriers are now just going to be max-krab fit, because it's pointless to try to save them (that is: chances are, you won't, and even if you do, you're going to lose a recon, and carriers are cheap enough that burning the recon is probably not worth it).
---
&gt;and we can secure and control our and any neighbor systems and do whatever we want and catch whoever comes through.
---
There's a huge difference between protecting your home + a few neighbors from roamers vs covering a region from potentially large, dedicated threats.  In the latter, you need to be able to respond to a BIG threat, anywhere in your region of concern, 23/7, which means either having a ton of nerds ready on a bridge, or utilizing the tons of nerds you already have logged in in the super/ratting fleet.  The latter is way easier to put together, so it's the hammer of choice.  Borders are porous enough (wormholes, nullified stuff, npc stations) that you're never going to just keep everyone out.
---
That’s only how many users logged in, you can’t guess nothing off of that.
---
The difficult part right now is that I can't loot my ship wreck without dying to the pirates occupying the deadspace. Any advice for that?
---
It’s not so simple as risk / reward. The blackout was very binary. That throws a lot of room out of the window in terms of risk reward balance. A lot of pve players will not risk anything without a very high level of control.
---
That's been edited, right? How are the colours so vibrant? The resolution so high? I really need to upgrade my RAM :0
---
Fit frigate with tank and mwd, buy a mobile tractor unit and take it to the mission, anchor it in a safe distance but still in range. Then try to loot that instead.
---
Beware that MTUs can be killed in high sec without Concord intervention, so don't keep that out for a long time.
---
&gt; That’s only how many users logged in, you can’t guess nothing off of that.
---
That's why I said guess. Do you know what happens when people unsub?
---
When you leave because you got bored, or are taking a break, or life gets in the way, then yes. You may come back. But it still takes something reminding you of it, and sparking the interest again.
---
People who leave because they are sick and tired of CCP's shit, those will probably never come back.
---
Rats wont shoot your pod so go there and bookmark the wreck. Go talk to the agent and cancle the mission. Grab a ship and warp directly to the wreck.
---
Tooltip delay in the general settings tab in the ESC menu.
---
15 minutes? When I started in EVE it was an hour, right in the middle of my local playing time.
---
&gt; It’s not so simple as risk / reward. The blackout was very binary.
---
And that's why blackout was doomed to fail. If blackout was introduced in stages or only to a couple systems/constellations/regions at a time and accompanied by (much) higher rewards, then blackout would have had a much higher chance of success.
---
Aside from that I disagree with your notions about risk vs. reward. If the reward is high enough people will start taking more risks. If you increase risk but all else remains equal then the people willing to take the risks for the same rewards will reduce. In contrast, if you decrease the risk and all else remains equal then more people will start doing that activity. Very simple.
---
Let's not forget that past two years reward was increased with no corresponding increase of risk.  
---
Furthermore player organisation has removed much of what risk there was left so Null is now more safe than ever AND richer than ever.   
---
Hence insane inflation.  
---
Sov null is killing Eve nothing else :)
---
Thank you for your explanation, it puts some of this in focus for me.
---
“utilizing the tons of nerds you already have logged in”
---
Just gotta say, I live this sentence.
---
So you're telling me that's not a B-wing?
---
Yeah I get putting them on ultra heavy assets, you lose a shitton of money either way if your super goes boom, might as well make it as badass as possible before then. 
---
But yeah, my mindset is coming from a place where I do not fly capitals. I never have. I have decently good carrier skills, just never bothered buying one. Subcaps with that type of bling seems excessive unless they are some AT ship and you really wanna do some silly shit
---
a 9/10 shot i am not going to gatekeep from being posted here, because i've only just done it for another post
---
on the other hand, if enough people post their screenshots maybe we can finally close r/eve
---
If the risk turns into being shot like a fish in a barrel only very few fish are willing to jump in that barrel, regardless of the rewards.
---
Quiet you, we can’t bring logic into this ....
---
Remember, pve under super umbrella is a ‘high skill activity’.
---
no
---
&gt; Let's not forget that past two years reward was increased with no corresponding increase of risk.
---
Perhaps this is the case with mining, but this does not hold for combat sites.
---
&gt;Furthermore player organisation has removed much of what risk there was left so Null is now more safe than ever AND richer than ever.
---
Players will always optimize their playstyles. You can't blame the players for playing the game according to the ruleset that is provided to them. CCP has made it possible and easy for alliances to ball up and make space safe, so players will naturally do that. CCP has the power to change that (without drastic measures such as blackout) but they haven't. Instead they have removed drivers of conflict from the game over the last few years, have made sov war a hassle through fozziesov, and made citadel warfare absolute cancer. No wonder people don't want to go to war with eachother anymore unless absolutely needed. How can you blame the playerbase for this? This is on CCP.
---
&gt; Quiet you, we can’t bring logic into this ....
---
There is no logic in his post. If you're not flag baiting you should know better.
---
I feel like your comment is wrong.
---
Because a properly fit Orca in highsec is basically un-gankable.
---
When people stop logging in, they stop paying, because why pay for a game you are not playing?
---
lol that would be like rolling blackouts, people would just log out and wait for it to end and come back at the end of the time period.
---
Yeah, gotta love those stacking penalties from modules that aren't the same.
---
&gt;I really do hope they learned something.
---
They learned enough to end it, after losing 30% of the logged in players.
---
Everything has already been said, but not yet by everyone, I guess.
---
It's a bit like farting. It creates some relief for the guy doing it while everyone else wonders for a second where the frick this is coming from now before moving on as normal.
---
when you sit in your huggin webbing 100km away, (in the usual kitey douche setup) next to your buddie with a 90km point in his lachesis next to your 130km Estemel Jam Falcon, next to your heavy neut long range (actually never done one) curse... with the ability to drop a fax at any moment.....
---
this is when these expensive mods can be fun.  well flown ships with bonuses is where its at, even a well flown kiting bhaalgorn with officer neuts and webs can be hard to take down.
---
&gt; If the risk turns into being shot like a fish in a barrel only very few fish are willing to jump in that barrel, regardless of the rewards.
---
Look, I get where you're coming from. You're positing that the risk was so high that barely anybody would play in blackout regardless of the reward. I disagree with that, I think the rewards could've been made high enough (considering a lot of pve can be done afk). But then again, we have no measure to test this, and the blackout is over anyway, so this discussion is kind of moot.
---
If I use my paid vacation time, the money I spend is free.
---
Economy is crashing as we have to much materials and build to many things when we compare this to what is destroyed.
---
Bit late. Nice tears though, manbaby.
---
&gt;Furthermore player organisation has removed much of what risk
---
false, its has lessened its affect, but it is in no way removed, just go look at the kill boards and see all the dead rorqs, caps and supers that died under umbrellas. The risk was never removed, the WH's just started screeching because killing caps they found while roaming became actually hard and risky.
---
Combat sites? You mean the ones ran in supers?  
---
If you think Sov was ever a conflict driver wake up. It was always cancerous. Cit bashes are shit but frankly so were the POS bashes. That is nothing new.  
---
And now nullibears who are comfortable in their little pit are blaming CCP for trying to kick people up the butt while at the same time complaining about game being risk [adverse.](https://adverse.You)
---
If you want a war make fucking war not wait around for a SANDBOX dev to do something. It's not their job to provide content - their job is to provide environment - It's players job to make content for each other.  
---
I am FUCKING SICK of this WoW themepark bullshit mindset.
---
 You get the EVE you play. If you play shit you get shit.  
---
That's what sandbox is about.
---
&gt;I'm shocked.
---
said no eve vet ever.
---
Come talk to me about how you overcame the same challenges when you get static gates into j-space, j-boy.
---
Hear hear!
---
The Chaos Era was ... ill-conceived.   Time to move on and rebuild.    CCP, you've lost the trust of the player base.  It's time to re-earn it.     Actually TALKING to your players about the game might be useful.
---
When you can crab up a carrier in 3 hours loosing one is not longer risky.  
---
Ease of making isk made more and more ships disposable ergo reducing meaning to loss ergo reducing actual risk.  
---
People torch billion isk ships like they are t1 cruisers.
---
&gt;Do you know what happens when people unsub?
---
Their accounts become alpha and still playable.
---
CANT GANK FREIGHTERS WHAT WILL WE EVER DO FOR PVP EH NOW WE JUST HAVE NOTHING
---
Just because they aren’t logging in doesn’t mean they are not omega.
---
Sigh with your minute text can’t you just write like an adult
---
Have really enjoyed looking through your works, Thank you.
---
Because you are still training and can have a ton of industry jobs and research going?
---
you'r right, I missed this point, but you get the idea
---
Yes
---
&gt;  take the tools that only the big organizations have and to build them for everyone
---
Yes!  I think I replied to someone on another thread earlier with precisely this point.  The players have done what CCP refused to, from Zkill to Mumble.  
---
What we have here is massive underinvestment in the game over time problem, nothing more.  I feel it's probably too late to reverse any of this.
---
They literally said they were finally able to increase the reward thanks to blackout and then they removed blackout
---
Big isk big risk
---
It is sad that you considered this a PVP activity.          
---
For me it was mostly piracy       
---
&lt;3
---
More players is more of an economic stimulant than the pathetic economy of high-sec ganking.
---
They didn't even have the guts to announce it as basically killing off highsec freighter ganking completely and instead came along with some bullshit about getting stuck in models when it was pretty clear that the goal of this was to remove an entire playstyle from the game.
---
&gt; Combat sites? You mean the ones ran in supers?
---
Yeah? Payouts for those haven't changed in a while.
---
&gt;If you think Sov was ever a conflict driver wake up.
---
I didn't say that.
---
&gt;Cit bashes are shit but frankly so were the POS bashes. 
---
You can't compare the two. Citadel bashes are way more shit than POS bashes. If people could choose between citadels now and citadels with pos reinforcement mechanics nobody in their right mind would not switch to pos mechanics.
---
&gt;I am FUCKING SICK of this WoW themepark bullshit mindset.
---
Are you okay buddy? Calm down a bit.
---
I get it, you don't understand that player behavior is in a large way influenced by the ruleset of the game. If you can come to grasp with that concept, then maybe you can understand a bit more that taking away drivers for conflict or to make conflict more bothersome will make less people want to get into conflicts with one another. Now, I am not saying that the players are without blame, but it is **very** narrow-minded of you to just put it all on the players without at least trying to understand the role that CCP has played and still has to play in all this.
---
Logged in toons doesn’t equate to actual players, that’s what we don’t know, CCP knows what accounts belong to the same person.
---
Can you be more precise?     
---
English is not my primary language.    
---
Never learned it in any school (so like you probably see) mostly learned it by listening what people say
---
That’s inflation, a crash is different and much more sudden with domino effects.
---
What are these effects - mining boosts sigh
---
oh boy..just check market history for armor plates , lorentz fluids and all components fromr elic sites...and then tell that again...
---
Now if only the war structure could be made killable.
---
Destroying structures in high sec takes so long that the defender can easily time their reinforcement times so that the structure can not be killed during the war.
---
The right answer was they stop logging in.
---
&gt; made me really goddamn excited
---
Grow up.
---
&gt; Just because they aren’t logging in doesn’t mean they are not omega.
---
You know what you're right, I am sure everybody just stopped logging in but also kept paying for their accounts. Marvelous.
---
Lol, that’s probably not going to happen.
---
&gt; they were finally able to
---
But they didn't.
---
It’s more likely than you think.
---
Ok i should write "Economy is on the verge of collapse"
---
EVE players think the weirdest fucking things are "skill".
---
Most EVE players still click their modules. It's about time they give up this idea that there's any mechanical skill in 99.999% of EVE gameplay.
---
dude..did u even read the full post? or any of my replies...i follow this shit for 18month now..and im not the only one having an eye on that..this is actually commonly known across eve, that theres tons of explroation bots..i dunno..u might live under some rock somewhere..or be blind to reality.
---
what if i would link allthe botting vexors and nyxs and whatnot...u probably tell me " nah no proof thats probably all afk players ...." man...i dont even know what ro reply ...
---
nope. they scan it anyways, because, as i already mentioned multiple times, they run in circles and will come back to that sys at some point, and if sys is clear they hack the relic they scanned down ealier ( if its still avaiuable) the scripts seem all to wrok the same way..bot enters sys..warps safespot..probes sys..and either goes for relic or leaves , according to local...
---
&gt; loosing one is not longer risky
---
Newsflash to you all, most people don't do a risk v reward calculation.  They do an effort v reward calculation.  That is to say, "what effort do I have to put into this in order to do it whilst remaining 99.9% safe".  The only people who work on risk v reward are botters.
---
I did after he re-shipped.
---
Right .....
---
Imagine yourself this in Uedama &lt;3
---
ok so obviously you cant handle criticism..or the truth..or anything that doesnt comply with your view on eve. well i cant help that. but calling me entitled coward, for simply criticisng your pretty stupid reply....makes u an entitled coward actually. vOv.
---
Thankfully doomsdays are not considered as normal damage source by ingame mechanics and affected by them.
---
That only matters if you come back. The longer you win Eve, the easier it is to keep winning.
---
don't forget: module enchanting
---
Nothing in Eve is real until its on TQ. Not even then:p
---
Seriously would pay for an Astero or Stratios in this style.
---
If CCP is serious about player retention, this is something they have to improve on. The lack of vision is off-putting. CCP cannot bank on EVE being a niche game forever. And when it comes to time and money, people value both and if EVE looks like a waste of both, people will go elsewhere.
---
I like EVE but CCP is mismanaging the game.
---
Reddit, he did it!
---
I dont think its over yet but ye its looking grim. We can hope that they turn this around. Im more than happy if they start with non-blocs. Thats the place that has needed much love for quite some time.
---
I just got here, but lets blow some shit up!
---
Oh this. Well the small text is when i talk to myself ^(the doctor told me it is normal and i should not worry to much about it)
---
gawd, that was cringeworthy. im not here for praise. i just state facts. and people go apeshit about it .
---
simple said botting in any player driven economy game, ever..is pretty much destroying the game over time, sowly but steady...
---
if u feel like you gotta bot to compete ...well i cant help that. it just makes u a subhuman being in the eyes of most "honest" players vOv
---
I blame White aero
---
WELCOME TO ROTE KAPELLE BOIS
---
ok u dont see evidence..what if i link one of those thousands of botting vnis..or nowadays myrmidons..you probably still ask for evidence..even if i would link banned botfarms to you..you still be like " needs evidence " XD
---
you probably one of those guys who needs proof that 1+1 = 2 and not 3.
---
anyways.im out of this threat for the sake of my own sanity, the ammount of 20IQ people in here is sad.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
I'm not sure why anyone would find it fun to kill citadels. It takes over a week and you probably have to take a day of to meat the fucking timer. All to kill a structure that is what? 300mil ISK or something? That will drop absolutely nothing because even if they are offline for a week everything will be magically teleported away?
---
I'm not sure what player base CCP is designing those features for. People without a live and job? Not sure if they have money for a sub...
---
Why would you keep PvP alts in null? There aren't really any wars going on other than tests slap fight with frt
---
They couldn't afk rat anymore, what you are talking about involves effort and exerting that effort means diverting ones attention from Netflix and dropping your nth alt into the next anom, to the modern null krab, this is unacceptable. It sounds like you are actually playing the game which is probably why you don't get it.
---
I'm sorry, but you're just flat out wrong here. Feel free to downvote/make snarky comments.
---
Here are the facts:
---
* Unsubbed accounts can still log in and play, via Alpha clone status.
---
* Subbed accounts can still abstain from logging in and playing.
---
* Those two facts alone render your assertions to mere speculation.
---
* All accounts can have shorter play sessions, causing a drop in PCU.
---
* Many of the unsubbed accounts were alts (as per "unsubbing X alts gg ccp")
---
There is an answer here, but only CCP can know it. Therefore, you are just wildly speculating, seeing in the data what you *want* the data to say. Since the playerbase does not have access to the actual raw data, anyone making definitive claims on (the very thin) evidence of PCU should be treated with hard skepticism. 
---
TL;DR no one should take what you say seriously because you clearly have the scientific acumen of a cucumber and are simply blowing it out of your ass.
---
having midslot damage mods would completly destroy the games balance (yes its actually quite balanced)
---
fit a whole bunch of ships up. fit them 'normally' to thier hull. youll find your putting one dps slot on armour hull. and 2 or 3 on a shield equivalant. but the dps is almost the same. aside from small changes like, less dps on longer range hulls etc etc. ie: eagle to diemos....
---
Sm3ll ya later?
---
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 🎈
---
Ditto
---
Lady blame the canadian.
---
maybe
---
Bummer man maybe now you will have to shoot at so.ething that shoots back...
---
Yet we all do it. Weird huh?
---
It is not about shooting but about getting the cargo.    
---
If you eject your stuff you can go, it is not about getting a kill.
---
It wouldnt have mattered man. The BO was unbalanced and no amount of increases would have actually made a difference. If they had balanced it first then we would have gotten the reaction many thought would happen, weed out the weaker ones so to speak.
---
This just killed off most.
---
Not unplayable by any stretch, but it does require some preparation, setup, and multiple Alpha accounts.
---
Panda Power!
---
It works exactly this way.          
---
Because most of the the cases those are different friends so it grow fast.
---
Hi. I'm looking at doing some invention using T1 bpcs.  I know that without decryptors they'll return 1 run T2 bpcs,  but I can't find a consistent answer around the me / te values.  Some sites say they'll be negative,  others say it's 0/0. Some of the industry planning resources don't display negative values - are they still a thing? Thanks
---
You couldnt even active Rat readonably anymore. With cloaky stuff everywhere you are dead as soon as you are caught. As long as there are No real solutions to cloaky campers. Its not like your little desolate corner noone bothers to come through
---
I don't think this impacts the game so much.
---
is this a botter myrm?
---
I appreciate the freedom to do whatever you want
---
Leave a Canadian in charge for 1 day and he does this....typical.
---
You've got two good options at your disposal, depending on the circumstances of your death.
---
Option 1 is to fly out to the scene of your death and bookmark your wreck.  As /u/captain_skinback  noted, mission NPCs won't attack your pod, so you can fly out there and right click, bookmark.   If you return to your agent and fail the mission, the site will despawn completely, leaving your wreck alone in space, able to be recovered without interference.
---
Option 2 is to take your insurance money and buy a completely new ship to complete the mission.  You have about 2 hours (usually more) before your wreck despawns.  If you go this route, you'll have redundant fittings after you recover your wreck.  As you'll quickly learn in EVE, though, there's nothing wrong with having extra ships - and you'll plow through fittings (and ships) pretty quickly early on.  
---
The third, slightly more risky, option is to enlist the help of a friend.  If you don't know a friend, then a wingman from local or corpchat.  The risk here is that, in EVE Online, you never really know the type of pilot the other person is going to be.  Maybe they'll be generous, blitz through your mission for you, and leave the wreck.  Alternatively, they'll finish the mission for you and then take your stuff right in front of you.  That's basically the core gameplay of EVE Online!
---
Most certainly not! This is the very best type of Myrmidon, well fitted with an experienced solo player behind the wheel, come to your space (because frankly, most players are too lazy to go anywhere!) Looking for a good fight, providing everyone they come across with content!
---
Just wave and wush it good luck o/
---
But isnt null in a state of to much reward with fuck all risk? Shit why dont we tier the sec system? Hs is worthless to all but new players. Low is a good middle ground and null is full risk full reward
---
Think is a term that WoW players use to describe a lower leveled character they keep at that low level to beef out and stomp in PvP battlegrounds or its a skinny cute gay boy 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
\[12:49:48 PM\](WhiteAero): Mercie is in charge. What's the worst that could happen  
---
Guess you found out :P
---
9 years in NC. and now you join PH, good luck with the rules over there :P
---
Why not just play and figure shit out as it happens? The last thing CCP needs is you bitching about why they didn't follow their roadmap exactly. 
---
Maybe because games are complicated and they're working on a dozen different changes that all need testing. Use your brain for once.
---
No npc space in range of omist, m8
---
&gt; Feel free to downvote/make snarky comments.
---
Alright, here it comes, you ready?
---
You have worms in your brain.
---
MATE!
---
Your posted are either NOT BOTs or VERY BAD BOTs. It's NOT THE CASE that THESE characters crashed the markets! 
---
HOWEVER: THERE ARE bots, that farm in asteros very efficiently. I saw them too. But it's not THESE characters! These characters are shit in botting, if they were, and will not crash the markets.
---
Glad you like them, always a huge boost getting comments like this which sometimes is what we all need to give ourselves that little push
---
If they wanted blackout to have any chance of working they should've introduced benefits in tandem. They didn't, people left, they reverted blackout, they failed miserably.
---
Aye probably but I want to focus on things that grab my interest and as a long time Eve player its given me a lot of inspiration for a variety of things. I find it harder to work on commissions or stuff that hasn't grabbed me and despite being a Star Wars fan since I've not had that overwhelming itch just yet
---
I didn’t expect you to have a rebuttal to any of my points. Take care. 👋
---
i'm happy i can sit with a warm coffee and watch my orders in the market and relax
---
1k updoots! A pleasure everyone, I'm gladd so many people liked it :)
---
No rebuttal is needed, you're a retard if you honestly believe the massive drop of average logged in players doesn't correspond with a drop in sub numbers. But you're right, we can't scientifically determine anything because we don't have the data that CCP has. That's why I said GUESS.
---
Dumbass.
---
Dear CCP,
---
Listen fockers, jk:)
---
I know people havent said the nicest things about you guys in the last months (or ever), me included. But for me its business, it was never personal. I might have issues with how persons within your org have handled things but in the end its business, its issues against your direction of the game. And you were/are making a massive mistake with the age of chaos. And you had a really bad attitude in regards to your players during all of this. Basically, you hurt people and many just left. And its been going on for quite some time, this time you just went all in without pretense.
---
But it is what it is. Mistakes happen, everyone is human. Even if wormholers are somewhat subhuman, theres still a part of human in that, jk. Not really:)
---
The worst part tho, honestly, its your radio silence. I dont know why you arent even trying to convince us to stay. Maybe you are scared that shit will become worse, I get it. But at this point its honestly better to just bite the bullet and start talking to us. Let us know how bad or how good it is, doesnt matter. 
---
Just say something. Tell us to go fk ourselves, just talk. Not business talk, just talk to us. We are still willing to support you guys but give us a reason to do so. Dont squander the last of loyalty and goodwill you have with us by trying to be diplomatic. 
---
Its real talk time.
---
Just download some more ram.
---

lass will be undergoing her driving test in the next hour, should she fail her pod pilot licence i fear the blackout will visit me in a domestic rendition
---
Wouldn't you have to actually be at your keyboard  for something to count as a playstyle? *thinking*
---
Usually long range weapons are better, due you have to move less or nothing to find the next target. Or avoid damage on your ship beacause your shoting out of the rat range.
---
But you'll have less dps, or will have problems with the smallest rats.
---
Nothing is 100% better on this game, it always depends of something.
---
Just try what is better for your PVE style.
---
This is a great step in the right direction.
---
&gt;if you honestly believe the massive drop of average logged in players doesn't correspond with a drop in sub numbers. 
---
I never claimed that. I simply pointed out that you’re wrong in claiming that unsubbed accounts don’t log in, and you got upset. :(
---
&gt;But you're right
---
Naturally.
---
&gt;we can't scientifically determine anything
---
So we’re in agreement. Excellent!
---
Members of a corporation could see jobs in build on xl csaa’s
---
seems like a good idea, i'm waiting for the post to tell why your wrong
---
Why do you think anyone who has a rorq out is a botter?
---
And again, just compare the ships on zkill of the ones you say are bots, and the ones CCP banned
---
Then compare those two. See a difference?
---
\- confirmed bots die ine a rookie ship once. Then always in the exact same ship/fit for rest of their deaths.
---
of the ones you accused: 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/2115505203/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2115505203/) 
---
died 3 times in a cheap, low skill fit (compared to the higher skill fits of the bots) at random times. It started not even a week ago, so we can't say if his just an alt, of a person who wants to have a dedicated toon (and is on vacation) or if CCP is already on him  
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/95544457/](https://zkillboard.com/character/95544457/) 
---
died many times, with HUGE difference in time. So who has a bot, that stops running for 3 months before starting again? And please don't tell me that a regular bot in a non-warpcore stabbed and obviously playing in blackout does only get caught once. And also changing the fit every time it died? looks pretty pretty human to me...

yee... scanning bots using well fit gilas for lowsec pvp. I see this daily... these bots also want to have a variety of gameplay... and all one bot. very intelligent are they nowaydays...

same story as above
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/2115635183/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2115635183/) 
---
no way you can read a botting behaviour from zkill
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/2115183205/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2115183205/) 
---
finally, this guy might be a bot. congrats, 1 in 5 you got nice... Although it might also be just a random guy earning his isk on a dedicated scanning character, as it is very lucrative
---
I use z-s overview so the game is playable
---
Nah, wormholes are 100% safe for farming, some mouthbreather on reddit told me so
---
I would love seeing you crab a carrier in 3 hours or even 6 or 9. We are talking about nullsec here and not high wormholes like C5 or C6. A carrier will take you 10+ hours of constant ratting without any disturbance or other losses if its fitted cheaply and I am talking here from normal carriers only and not supers who take at least double that amount if not more and that was before the blackout and nerfs to combat sites were rolled out.
---
I like it.
---
But why not go a step further and only have a single timer?
---
You can run t2s in a rapid heavy passive standard caracal so I bet you'll be able to do t2s.
---
Possibly
---
i appreciate how clear and easy it can be to set up short, medium and long term goals for eve.
---
Clearly not, as was seen on dotlan.
---
Ez answer is offline raiding. Its bullshit to lose something when ur offline. 2 timers is good idea. I like it. 
---
O shit we got attacked. Now we know when the real fight is
---
You're not capable of upsetting anyone buddy. Take care.
---
Never plan more than a month ahead. Set goals, but don’t strategically plan in a rigid way beyond one month.
---
This. The kinds of fights you used to be able to get by roaming around to someone's space and harrassing ratters is extremely rare now. They usually just drop a load of capitals on you, and you either leave or die.
---
I miss skirmishing on a station undock in small stuff.
---
Well it will have single timer.          
---
You remove the shield, get "armor" timer that it is the final timer.    
---
But instead of structure dying instantly after armor is gone people need to also grind the structure down.
---
It is a single structure that you pointing out.          
---
Possible abuse is a rogue director declaring a war and putting your keepstar as a war structure.         
---
But then you can always defend it until war ends.
---
Hmm I mean there are 40m Caracal fits out there who can run T3 abyssals, so you overinvested into a suboptimal ship + fit
---
Cloak stays on, it still gets a bonus to the rep power tho not quite as muchh. And I hate the look of the subsystem on the loki that gives the full 10% bonus to reps.
---
I wonder that too. Maybe they are saving them for a full expansion?
---
Are you the guy that nearly lost his super to a dozen tristans? If so, that was funny shit my man.
---
Goob morning everyone
---
This is what happens when u bunch into one region and in particular 3-4 constellations... cloaky hunters go where the targets are
---
Look at the link in the comment above, there is a Stratios painting among his work. And its very impressive.
---
EVE is just like every other MMO: the carebear majority pay the bills. Cold, hard truth. Sadly.
---
This is only for offender War HQ.         
---
When someone declare war on you he need to specify citadel in higsec that will act as a War HQ.           
---
If defender will kill this structure War ends instantly.       
---
**The reduced timer only apply to structures declared as War HQ**
---
I think it bears mentioning for new players that ***most*** mission rats wont shoot pods. I think Burner rats do because its supposed to mimic a pvp situation.
---
CCP resoning : "high risk, low reward" , for the most PVE . 
---
Keep that in mind
---
Same here. Doing allot of scifi/character art and lots of people asking if I do commissions. So far haven't accepted any due to not wanting to be bound to a person's demands and having deadlines etc etc.
---
the reward is already high, what we certainly don't need is income creep.
---
Sorry, Just woke up. 
---
One thing many people are complaining about that I don't see much argument against is that citadels are cancer to kill. Between timers, damage caps, and defenses they're ridiculous.
---
I would probably support something even stronger like changing all citadels to only have a single timer, never mind just war HQs.
---
fren elaborate pls (◕‿◕ )

#JustCCPThings
---
What did you expect, Them to actually release them on time for once after 3 years of promising them but never delivering ?
---
&gt;which summer
---
Happy birthday pandemic pandas!
---
Wish you the best!
---
Don't be stupid.  By that standard the whole of Eve is a single organisation as most of us know players in other alliances.
---
took them 15+ years to implement a confirmation step for the trade window... I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
They are not banned from playing, but they have big restraints with how much&amp;what they can do.  Play casually in highsec mostly solo, sure, i guess a lot of them do at least that. But being in a null alliance, trickier. Be in a position of power in a null alliance, impossible. Look at all the CSM drama this year alone regarding insider info. If there would be even a hint of a DEV related insider scandal again EVE would explode (would still be fun to read reddit at least ;) )
---
Oh wow, it's really good.
---
CCP dev told me at eve vegas last year that they don't have any competition so they don't feel rushed about getting changes out, they just worry about a change that would cause a max exodus of players
---
Thanks dear, happy to be there !
---
&gt; Cit bashes are shit but frankly so were the POS bashes.
---
fuck off idiot, this is simply not true.
---
The number of POS was limited by the moons (in some systems very low single digit numbers) and had just 1 timer instead of 2 to come back.
---
half of logged in toons are probably even bots.
---
That would be the same if everyone is more spread up. And thats also the problem with botters. You need some way to get out of the way of hunters if you pay attention, but then a bot can use this too. Ive heard about more acceleration gates into ratting sites, which I would say could be an interesting way but also very annoying. I personally dont have an idea where hunters and hunted can be in a decent equilibrium while bots are completely unpractical other then random effects or tasks to make it as hard as possible to program bots. I mean what I also would love is if the rewards from killing rats would go further away from pure isk and more towards specific loot used in production. Maybe even regionspecific which would enforce trading or at least süreading out more to have the necessary resources. That would also mean that even with infinite spawns the loot loses value with too heavy ratting while its also cheaper to lose ships in heavily farmed constellations.
---
&gt;littered by the eyesore of a thousands of unfurled dead stations.
---
Yeah, I came back to the game to find all of my assets scattered throughout high sec in asset security. There were a ton of stations unanchored with that change.
---
They're coming, right after they finish tiercide
---
By default, your ME/TE will be 2/4, but your decryptors can change that.
---
Also, not all T2 BPCs are one run, things like ships are, but other things like ammo are multiple runs. Again, decryptors can change this.
---
In my experience, decryptors aren't usually worth it, but sometimes I use them.
---
Because there are to many of them and you can just drop way to many of those and lets be honest current mechanics are motivating you to drop multiple structures.          
---
**Ideas how to solve the structure spam**            
---
* Make EC have 6 rig slots so you don't need multiple structures to cover the same tasks.                  
---
* Make industry tax apply to constellation or even a region. So people don't drop the same setup in each system to have separate tax.              
---
* Make that unanchoring structure also let you recover the rigs in the process - so people pull down all the unused structures that are still in space as the hull cost 700mil, but rigs inside 5bil (so why to pull this thing if you maybe could use it in a year of 2 again)        
---
* Make unanchoring structure faster.  Like i have structures up as i don't want to wait a week to pull it down. Especially that it need to be at specific moment you start unanchor week later.       
---
* Give EC also bonus to refining so people don't drop a refinery next to it just to refine stuff, instead they can just add a rig.
---
i've returned home last sunday after staying in montréal for three months, learning irl gallentean and stuffs (◡‿◡✿)
---
Firstly, look for a c4/c2 corp with a c3 static, not a c3 corp, if you want to rat in a c3. A corp that lives in a c3 will never have enough sites for everyone to run, but if you have a c3 static you can always roll it over and over to find more.
---
Second, you don't need great English to talk in voice, unless you just can't speak it at all, then you should be able to find a corp that won't mind.
---
And lastly, what you want to look for is c3 wormholes with no other j-space connections. Then, ignore all signatures, and keep the probe scanner window open and off to the side. Now bring the Praxis in, start ratting, and if you see anything on dscan, or any probes, or if a new signature spawns (that could be a new wormhole) then you warp off to k space, get safe, and switch to the scanner.
---
Oh shut up and quit already.
---
Yeah, i dont think we even broke 10k concurrent players for the first time until late 2005/early 2006.
---
Well yes, my point is that if you currently play with some people you will want to play with them also later.
---
Hello /u/SquizzPlease help me install Eve portal 2019 on my phone, i'm very old and this is my phone model

---
In other words please keep the SkillQ running, you're doin an awesome job and whatever you choose to keep it running or shut it down THANK YOU VERY MUCH for the effort and the great job
---
Icelandic culture is such that they hate to publicly admitting to being wrong. Declaring chaos to be over would be admitting it was a dumb idea and wrong. Therefore they’ll just never mention it again and pretend it never happened.
---
Thanks,  so if I invented a T1 rig,  I'd get a 1 run 2/4? No negative me / te values?
---
So you want bombers to be able to trade evenly against all ship classes? Even ignoring capitals that is insane. If they can't trade evenly overwhelming force will always exist in some format. 
---
 I never said or implied I want their play style to go away, what I want to stop is the tears and crys for ccp to nerf when the opponent doesn't bring you a fair fight. This is their space that they are trying to defend and you are invading it in the briefest sense.
---
Just CCP things.
---
Players didn't like blackout?
---
They probably just want more mining then, yeah! Lets give them bonuses to that instead!
---
So you answer is no I take it lol. Krabs always complain about how easy it is for hunters to gank the unsuspecting krab but have never done so themselves so have no real appreciation for the effort it takes. 90% have only ever fired a shot from a super or 100 man fleet.
---
Nope feel free to continue going in and killing ratters, just don't cry to ccp when they show you the door. What these nerfs would have led to is no ability to stop hunters and then it would be the reverse no interaction. There needs to be a middle ground but until ccp reversed on blackout the side with hunters was all changing full blackout only. Now they are willing to talk about a middle ground but are hypocrites for it.
---
You realize *throwing a wrench in the works* is not a good thing, right?
---
So without diving into other aspects of citadel spam cancer and creating a complicated patch, could we solve this timer issue by removing current timers in their entirety and reverting back to Stront Bay fueling mechanics for Citadels?   
---
I could be wrong, but feel like this is basically what StainGuy is arguing for... I'm simply recommending maker timers COST something.
---
Because you only have to come back and check on your orcas once an hour.
---
im grateful that the game exists, where i can live out my fantasies of being a space trucker like those space truckers in cowboy bebop (episode 7, heavy metal queen)
---
The graphs are quite similar except for a downturn around the end of August. 
---
What happened at that time?
---
The biggest online MMO of all time was re-released.
---
Lol you think ccp has adevs working on eve outside their lunch break?
---
It’s almost as if the company that owned them in Korea looked at plummeting sub numbers and said to Hillmar WTF are you doing!?! Reverse your changes right the fuck now or you’re fired.
---
There was a bus?  All I got was a stupid crate.
---
this \^
---
There are tools that can record soundcards output without any loss if the soundcard can do it. I use Goldwave for that but surely many others can do it.
---
Dont get me wrong, ive accepted a few because its part of the territory.
---
￼I don’t get the autistic obsession by Blackout apologists to pedantically differentiate between. Players vs Characters.
---
To CCP a player that has 5 accounts that are all Omega is more valuable to the company than 2 players with 1 account each.
---
You can jump up and down and throw a temper tantrum and absolutely detest that fact, but it’s reality.
---
rules? what are those
---
its great, isnt it?
---
Try to kill clone soldier in lowsec. Can be quite profitable. Highly recommend Verge vendor lowsec. It is full of clone soldier rats..
---
The only people who die while doing exploration in nullsec are bad (not being able to run past a gatecamp), lazy (not checking zkill for the people in local to find the explorer hunters), or both.
---
this is part of the new CHAOS! plan.  
---
CHAOS! does not include things coming out on time.  That would be ridiculous and ruin the whole point of CHAOS!
---
Why shaming? I m just interested...
---
Mmhmm. 👋
---
Hey idiot who doesn’t understand the math behind they graph: this is the graph you’re looking for  http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2019.png
---
(hint: it’s going to take about 25-30 days, post-blackout, before you see the graph in the OP link start to go up)
---
They've been talking about more implants for YEARS... why do so many people think THIS year will be any different?
---
I spend some time mining in barges in HS lately. I guess thats as close to "doing krabbing without reward" as you can go in EVE. So, I d answer "yes".
---
Stolen... by pirates.
---
Soon ^TM
---
Thanks I will do that - your last stream seems to have no sound though.
---
I remember loving this ship.  It was my first 'big' ship in the game when I was playing.  The memories.
---
No, the only consistent part of the blackout era has been the revelation of how numbingly ignorant wormhole players￼ are and their consistent inability to understand math and graphs.
---
What I d wonder: Would PvPers still go roaming and ganking random folks if there d be no KB showing what they did?
---
Just a joke mutey
---
I don't know if we could, but I would love that. Citadels would be a bit easier to time than starbases were because it's much easier to have spare stront and a pilot there but that's probably a good thing.
---
I don't think cost is the main benefit, stront costs essentially nothing. What it does is provide play and counterplay between an attacker and a defender and give both sides the ability to influence the final timer. They also mean that even a citadel with years of fuel if attacked would lose its timer unless someone was actively maintaining it. Even if the citadel self-repairs, unless someone adds more stront there would still be no timer.
---
It's a more complicated solution than just removing a timer, but it worked well in the past to break stalemates due to timezone warfare.
---
&gt; Lol you think ccp has adevs working on eve outside of ~~their lunch break~~ making skins?
---
FTFY friend
---
I don't have a soundcard :( maybe you could? If you can do me a favor and record it for me please. Just go up to an npc and shoot it.
---
I am sick and tired of listen to this assholes. You think its easy to mine and rat? I can tell you why. Because none of you do the leggwork to go around and secure the pocket systems around you. You log in and find your breakfast plate at the table that your mom put there and think everything must come easy. You have experienced the game as a leech and think everyone does it the same. You are the salty one here that wants to change the game by making rating and mining a nightmare. I thougt people wanted te get rid of the botters but somehow from that they switched to crabers. WTF is going on?
---
There is an issue with stront timer. With alpha accounts you can have alts in every structure your alliance owns .... per person
---
I am really enjoying Eve Online at the moment.
---
You lost, #moveon
---
And the ship types hunters still continue to be the most evasive possible. Even now with the capital escalation path eviscerated most hunters aren't coming in fleets that are meant to take fights. So the stated goals here don't line up with what people are actually doing.
---
Haha. If they worry about it, that doesn't mean they are afraid of it. 
---
I think their main concern is concentrating on getting the game tailored to new player retention so that they can eliminate veterans from the equation safely without fear of flat lining the game by removing things like rorqs titans and supers outright.
---
Cause they announced the release of them? strange how that works
---
Great troll
---
henlo frens (◕‿◕✿)
---
Nice!
---
The things that make Horde a bit crap sometimes :(
---
If I abandon a ship in space will it stay cloaked ? And how long ?
---
Was wondering if I can make some kind of 2nd home / secret safehouse.
---
I saw somewhere that the maximum grid size for an object was 8000Km, so it will be unlikely to be bumped.
---
Yeah, CCP is odd regarding "supposedly higher quality-ships that suck at things you d expect em to be good at". It either takes hours of numbercrunching yourself to find out what ship and fit is best for what, or lots of asking around and trying to filter the questionable answers from the actually helpful ones.  
---
Or you dont give a F about "efficiency" and try MAKING that hull you want to fly work in the situation you want to fly it in. That might be hard and demanding you to pull every trick outa your sleeves while fitting AND while flying it, but it can be fun. And you might have something to brag about... "I ran a \[fuckin hard site\] in a \[ridiculous underpowered/unfitting shiptype\]!" :)
---
Second Galaxy is far too good for a mobile game and trumps out eve in many aspects in my opinion, worth a look.
---
i wanna move to hisec and just appreciate the reading material in the npc missions
---
I've done hundreds of NPSI fleets behind enemy lines over the last several years. Sizes ranged from medium-ish (15) to large (100+).
---
This includes you, you petty asshole.
---
That requires being at the computer
---
1 drone per rock, come back in 4 hours
---
That is a ridiculously terrible idea. That removes all skill from those situations. I'd even go further and say that autopilot shouldn't immediately dock when landing from warp, to prevent all of the people that just turn it on mid-warp so that the ship docks as soon as it lands.
---
Damn... I remember when PLEXs were just 300mil each!
---
No, deeps. :|  
---
This is DEAD SRS! :|  
---
( We re in r/eve, ofc its a joke :D )
---
2 timers.
---
First timer is standard shield.
---
Second timer is split between a phase of armor and then final phase of hull. Armor phase provides a damage cap, hull phase is full vulnerability with no damage caps.
---
Getting into hull phase considers structure to be critically damaged and can no longer be manned and all services and modules go offline.
---
If successfully defended and there is no more incoming damage after X time, then structure begins repair.
---
open a blueprint / simulate a blueprint in the industry window - you can right-click the arrow on the left side and "copy" all the materials needed.
---
What do you expect? EVE is a game about numbers, not words. That's why no one here read, understood, or believed the word "temporary."
---
They used the weasel word indefinite as attempt to play both sides. Literally every change in eve is indefinite unless stated otherwise.
---
I propose "board my doctrine ship" for 100 plex and "board me titan" for.. whatever is the equivalent.
---
Monetization, more moneys for SeeCeePee?
---
Well... with respect, how many games have we created that have survived for more than a decade in spite of everyone since 2003 saying that the game was dying/dead?
---
Can someone translate this into English for me?  I never talk in local you see.
---
Please source your two years of buffs in that, because I have the source in only 2 years of nerfs.
---
it is indeed. this is the first game i've played with such freedom
---
Oh man you’re preaching to the choir, I’m so bad at lining shit up in that game. Never understood why it’s like my depth perception leaves me in the mining universe
---
It's a lie.
---
Was the reason I retrained my main from caldari to gallente
---
CCP still doesnt have the funds to mount the expedition into their graveyard of promises.
---
I have been a 8 year casual player and I just came back to really experience EvE to its max. I did HS the whole time before and just joined TEST to really learn null. Found some great guys that have been helping me learn the real game.
---
Ya but then they decided instead of increasing the reward they removed blackout. And why not add blackout and increase the reward at the same time.
---
Coffee contains lots of sulphur and is also a diuretic, which will dehydrate you.  In combination with the sulphur, you'll start to get very bad breath.

deep joy all around
---
So, wait, what???  You want a button to produce an industrial ship?  How does that help local production?
---
They renamed Slaves to Amulet just so they could bring in Slave implants but as a boost to Shield HP... did someone have an aneurysm while making this decision?
---
&gt;Slave (Sansha implant set that improves shield hitpoints)
---
This. CCP doesn't, and shouldn't, GAF about opinions they see on Reddit. They **DO** care about how people vote with their wallets. Obviously the Blackout and Cyno changes caused some changes in subscriptions/PLEX purchases, since they reversed them. Blackout was always intended to end at some point, but they made multiple reversals in like 2 weeks, which means statistics showed them it was a bad idea.
---
No matter how I feel about blackout, it's obvious the playerbase didn't care for it...and CCP would be stupid to make decisions irrelevant of revenue, since EVE would be shut down if they did.
---
New players *only* have trouble if they try to fight them. Simply using warp to 0 and not loitering, they have yet to break the shields on any of my t1 alpha fit frigs (gallente, btw, so armor fits). Anything small enough for them to nuke should be able to warp before the shot, and anything too slow will have the tank to take a volley or two.
---

How much sp does your char have? Might just buy that off you if you won't use it
---
I think you are right!
---
WoW. I never heard of such thing as clone soldiers. I’ll look into it.
---
carrier could kill titan if he was obviously afk
---
if they are all afk boson titans (you just cycle doomsday evry few minutes then do rl stuff again) then they all will be dead
---
In NPSI fleets you are hand-held and told what to do by the talented FC's that run them. They might have several years of experience doing what they do. 
---
Try that stuff alone or FC your own fleet and see how it goes :D
---
Not sure if there is a tool to do it in bulk. There are scripts to fetch prices for Google Sheets\\Excel and you can make your own little table. 
---
[khon.space](https://khon.space) works amazing to calculate the requirements for a single item with a lot of simulated conditions though.
---
This is disgusting. We log in, try to plan for the future and CCP remains radio silent. Litteraly. There is just no plan to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
*runs haven in nano nidhoggur with webber,goes as expected.
---
Be very wary of new sigs after you've fully scanned your WH.  This is a new incoming connection that someone has jumped through.  I tend to leave probes out as well, so I can scan for combat recons.
---
niarja
---
This is a very good idea. I would be out solo bashing these thing all the time just for the module drops Amd salvage.
---
Summer of 2024
---
This is a fair point; especially in terms of scaling timer changes out to null. Im imagining this could be resolved through putting a cap on roles in corp/alliance management? IE maxiumum of "x" chars can have role "A"  
---
And while yes Stront is cheap (perhaps another item could be used) the cost I should have referred to is the time by whoever manages the structures to adapt to the play &amp; counterplay we had with old POSes.
---
It wasn't a meaningful long term change is the biggest issue with it to me.
---
I was hoping Blackout was stage 1 of a much larger lore narrative to actually implement some big and needed changes to the map, citadels, and SoV mechanics. 
---
But no, just a little experiment that overall changed nothing and now its over I guess.
---
Is it though?
---
Fuck krabs.
---
nah, it actually works, ofc depending on what you want
---
needs banana for scale.
---
Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.
---
I’s sure they’re the only ones with rules.
---
SB-Nano-Nids FTW! \\o/
---
would be interesting if triglavians could start actually capturing systems and then expanding their territory system by system and if noone tried to stand up against them, they devoured entire regions
---
https://eve-industry.org/calc/
---
This does exactly what you want
---
This is a rather mild "reeee" but it'll do for the day.
---
Agreed, once I got to 60b I opted for committing all that isk to PvP
---
I laste6r 4 months. Now I'm fucking space poor again smh
---
You know what the problem with Blackout was? It was too easy for Hunters.  See most people in Null like to live in parts of Null that's relatively close to the rest of Eve (AKA not Dronelands).  Well the problem with that is there are a ton of NPC stations for Hunters to use for staging, so for if they died it was relatively easy to reship.  Compare that to Wormholes.  Yes you cannot see the people coming with "free intel" in Local chat, but you also only really had to get rid of them once and then you rolled whatever hole they were coming from.  So a PVE/PVP combo works because you could go back to PVE after you were done with the PVP.  No such luck in Null Sec.  You killed some bombers with your friends? Well here they come again in 20 minutes. It makes PVE impossible if you were not part of a group with a Supercapital fleet that could respond to these constant threats, and not everybody wants to be part of that. So you saw entire areas just die out.
---
What are you talking about?  You said it yourself, it's going to take more than 10 days before the graph OP posted is going to show an uptick.  Yet you aren't the one who made the thread, OP did, posting his conclusion based on a misunderstanding of how to perform the analysis he was attempting.  Granted, you're supposedly both goons so I guess you're not all manipulative idiots.
---
who the fuck doesnt kill anything they see, esp in bot areas that there arent people using caps etc.  
---
Also botters are hurt if with the same money you can buy less isk, they want plex prices to be 4m+ so people buy more from RMT, also no its not relative to the curve, its relative to risk and time spent, when before they could do \~100m/h with rattles and gilas in drones and now they can do 10-20m/h, they deem it unprofitable and move to other games (like wow classic) to make more money. If to sell 500 plex they need 75h (meaning make 10euro) they will just move to other games, botters arent here to be space rich.
---
CCP help I'm lazy
---
You mean how the numbers of NPC kills dropped dramatically after the blackout? That's a lot of people who loved ratting even when there are far better rewards elsewhere. 
---
The problem wasn't the blackout. The problem was players became too comfortable without risk.
---
They show you new skins and texture for wormhoes instead. Face palm
---
idk how to post image and text at the same time so :/
---
Good bit
---
I’ve got some specific tools I’ve found and put together to get the sound files out of the game - I could probably post a little tutorial and the stuff needed later (though it’s a little tedious to find what you’re looking for often times)
---
Agreed.    And:  they have real competition these days.    For a long time EVE was the only real space game available.   (Don't even start on Star Citizen...)    Now there are other options.
---
I don't think they've really grokked that yet.
---
Stop. Right. There
---
Pve tengu without cloak subsystem is begging to be killed/ganked.
---
No. It was only worth doing because of the minimal risk
---
Cap on people with roles - no.    
---
Like this could only create issues.        
---
Same for disallowing alpha players to refuel structures.
---
Probably for the best that you unsubbed.
---
&gt; I was hoping Blackout was stage 1 of a much larger lore narrative to actually implement some big and needed changes to the map, citadels, and SoV mechanics.
---
You're not alone man. Feelsbad.
---
It's sad Orca are not better, I fucking love the idea of having an orca surrounded by tiny barge mining ore, then, time to time it have to reach the EC nearby to drop the ore and come back
---
&gt;Icelandic culture is such that they hate to publicly admitting to being wrong.
---
CCP:   HTFU!     Adapt or die!
---
(Sorry, couldn't resist.)
---
Problem is, there are several classes of pop up that are actually useful, eg the ones in fitting window. If they could be enabled/disabled by class and the delay for those that are enabled be switched, that’d be just great.
---
Please explain the rus bots that could read the event log that detected all warps on and off grid regardless of cloaked status?
---
Gotem
---
Probably saved you from losing a ship. Its for the best.
---
Like a stick-POS, or a citadel?
---
wait till dran sees this
---
Fucking what lol
---
Its the same, you just get to split the loot less ways.
---
We found 'em, take 'em away boys.
---
dry them man baby tears op
---
They could give character bound extractors to cover nerfs. Personally i find it very upsetting when i trained and planned on doing things whih they just remove later.
---
If you abandon a ship it will decloak. 
---
What you can do, is use a giant freight container, a mobile depot, and an alt with an orca to nomad around. But you do need an alpha alt for this to work
---
FYI Implant sets are getting the chaos era treatment, bonus amount/type will be randomised on every session change.
---
Birch we still waiting for logi on killmails. Get in line
---
i hope this isn't contagious...how bad can one post?
---
To be honest when was the last time elo killed a fleet...its not really a trick when you kill them everyday.
---
Love it. 1600 double rep Myrmidon was my go to PvP ship back in the day. Before the dark times... Before the battlecruiser rebalance. Gotta love that aesthetic though. I always thought the Catalyst should be orientated vertically like the Myrmidon as well.
---
I was talking about killing the pirates/gankers
---
Lidicusss
---
On a very basic, fundamental level, nobody is free.  We're constrained by the laws of physics, for example.  I would define freedom as the ability to manifest your desires in the world.
---
Ok recons are pretty useful. 
---
Tbh i am just training one type of cruiser on my chars so all can use the same type of cyno recon as the skills for recons and covert cyno most of them had.      
---
It is simply that this change (without arguing if it was good or bad) costed a lot of people $$, ISK and time one way or another.        
---
Now if this was good change ... well ok.        
---
But if this was bad change and it will get reversed or even battleships will be allowed to light the cyno - well then many people will be pretty angry, with all right to be so at this point.           
---
This mean that CCP need to rework those recons to be more viable and had big chance of survival and/or reduce the cyno on them to like 30s in order to allow single player capital movement.
---
Thanks for that in depth answer :D
---
Just gotta point out, however, CPUs does not need an apostrophe, seeing as it is just a plural, not a possessive or contraction.
---
Nah, I've discussed this idea before. If you make the exit spit everyone out into random safes then you'd actually have to dive in and try to catch the person before they can reach the exit. Would allow some counterplay for the defender while still being an opportunity to catch someone for hunters.
---
Can you list other options. 
---
Thx
---
With the current state of Eve NCPL should just disband and merge with Horde. 👌
---
If this was a true experiment then all the data they got from it is useless.
---
When they implemented Blackout I was hopeful for 2 things, 1: That blackout might actually reinvigorate the playerbase and 2: It would give CCP an idea of what the majority of the playerbase wanted from the game. 
---
All they needed to do was implement Blackout and see how the playerbase responded via login numbers. However they tainted their results by deciding to run the SP giveaway at the same time. Any info they got from that period is unusable in the long term planning as users remaining for the SP giveaway or logging in alts they hadnt logged in in years just for the free SP  screwed the daily login number, returning players numbers etc. BTW its no coincidence that it was after 3 months that CCP pulled the plug on the blackout.
---
3 month subs are the largest income for CCP Subscription wise. (Plex is seperate.) So when after 3 months they could see their biggest non Microtranaction money facuet (To use a Dev term) essentially drying as people failed to renew their 3 month subs they realised how badly they underestimated the player feedback (The dev response went from "HTFU" to "Its coming back Monday, please clap." over the space of 2 days. You only make that sort of 180 when something is very very wrong.)
---
Well then if "literally every alternative is better" then why do it?
---
I proved people loved and enjoyed it. And if they had other alternatives to make better isk why did they all leave?
---
Maybe it was the player? Not the game.
---
&gt;EVE is full of people who don't know what they're doing, fly excessively expensive poorly-fit ships to do relatively low-ISK things which would get faster ISK with a different ship.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
What is OOS botter
---
If you had less orders than the alpha cap, it's possible. I've lapsed a few times to alpha with too many orders. Could only change prices after deleting some.
---
NO. Managing your modules is one of the things that differentiates good pilots from average. Removing that is just dumbing down the game. Please don't ever do this.
---
someone at ccp should lose job.
---
People did. As we saw on dotlan.
---
NONONO NO SB..they sucks untill you fit the officer ones for maximum strenght of being wealthy.
---
I still think blackout in npc 0.0 would be awesome.
---
But imagine having to actually log in after 50 days to add more skills to the queue.
---
They reversed cyno changes?
---
Did you happen to notice the date of the original post?
---
Literally unplayable.
---
It's so weird to see people actually believing in these sort of throwaway bits of social engineering we used back at the turn of the decade to convince people to train drakes.
---
Rip eve
---
Aye
---
How they interact with Jump Freighters, yes. There was a lot of pushback that the cyno changes ruined JF Services, and CCP changed the approach.
---
It's a stupid approach, but still.
---
I don’t disagree
---
He's talking about uninterrupted hours of Cap ratting and burning 1 bil isk ships with no thought.
---
Of course he's a Wormholer.
---
I mean that’s how I started EVE... figure shit out as I go along. That’s always the best part about coming back from the six months to year long break… Too lazy to read blogs, so I just figured the new shit out as I go along
---
You are thinking of Wormhole space.
---
Unlimited Cap use as theres no way to be dropped on. The ability thanks to a CCP designed Module to insta close any Wormhole you can see an enemy coming towards.
---
Hell even the current wormhole CSM member has said how easily they can get intel and the ability to insta lock down any wormhole is an issue and when the Wormhole spokesman is saying its too easy to get intel in WH space then you know there is an issue.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Agreed but in my experience by the time you're two days into your 50 skill queue, assuming they're not all level 1 skills, you've probably already changed your mind about what to train next.
---
Considering that you didn't have a chance to read the minutes before posting this, I suspect calling you a pessimistic SOB isn't going to be inaccurate.
---
hi mercie
---
Your skin cancer in 2019 isn't bad, imagine having lymphoma in 1960.
---
My skill que right now is 506 days.. I'm good for awhile.
---
Ah, right. Thought they reverted it completely.
---
Shit, I remember them announcing the implant changes at fanfest 2014.
---
Don't take the downvotes too hard. You got an upvote from me because that was fucking funny
---
T1 explorers are going to have a hard time running a gatecamp.  Covops are better but it's still not foolproof.  Instalign ceptors are a bit too good at it, but at least sacrifice scanning and hacking utility for it.  Besides which, gatecamps are only 1 way they die, people prescanning and camping sites in Sansha space can be pretty nasty too if your reaction time isn't perfect.
---
Contrast that with umbrella ratting, where you can be full yield fit 100% of the time without sacrificing any safety at all unless you're completely braindead.  And even after all that, explo yield is capped at a certain point because you run out of sigs in a way that absolutely does not happen with rolling combat and ore anomalies.
---
Explo is the model PvE in my opinion - accessible to new players, requires them to learn how to travel and use resources like zkill, and cannot be endlessly farmed under an umbrella.
---
I really enjoyed the blackout for a while, ended up getting hundreds of kills and roams ended up feeling more rewarding. 
---
But then there were times I wanted to come home from work and just relax by ratting or mining, and doing that wasn’t relaxing anymore, so I stopped playing. I haven’t come back because my entire corp also stopped playing. Oh well.
---
Stop talking bullshit. It's very doable.
---
What about defending yourself *before* you get tackled.  Before the cyno-drop-supers-I-win button I've been in corps that had roaming defense fleets, gate camps on pipes, or bait ratting fits.  I agree, blackout isn't the way to return to those playstyles (*cough* nerf fighters &amp; titans *cough*) but the pre-blackout strat was not healthy to the game.
---
Simple -- they are exempt from TQ. I don't like wormholers because they get to play on a different shard. They should have to play in the same sandbox as the rest of us.
---
Because they are the spooky people that appear out of no where and kill you and then disappear again.  Plus they give zero fucks about the rest of eve other than as targets
---

n i c e
---
&gt; spooky people
---
Meh. I find people in highsec more spooky than wormholers.
---
The problem with blackout is that there was no counter to it
---
If we had gotten the ability to anchor sensor beacon structures at gates which would make anyone on grid show up in local then it wouldn't have been bad. However it just fucked everyones play styles. I thought CCP would actually make changes but nope.
---
A lot of people have made this mistake in this thread, but as this is the top answer I'll post it here:
---
FLOPS isn't an objectively better way of measuring performance; it's just that most of the interesting things computers do these days (3D maths and such) involves floating points - so this measure is often of more interest than instructions per second or whatever else.
---
In a sci-fi space future using alien technology, it's actually quite a boring measure of performance imo. :P
---
How are they exempt?
---
The same sandbox... they’re connected to Kspace tho aren’t they?
---
Only when they want to be.
---
Are you hoping that the guys who caught your carrier won't switch to the mobile depot the second you drop it?
---
Some botters.
---
The whole War HQ is a bad mechanic, all it does is force the attacker to be part of a larger bloc so they have less to worry about in terms of HQ.
---
There is also the fix cost issue, so the % of the cost paid by the structure get's lower the more wars you declare.
---
This means if you have a 100 decs the structure cost is like 5 million per wardec where as if you have 2 decs it's 250 million per dec, so it's adding a base price to being able to declare war. 
---
So as a small group you can't do a fun dec without a large fixed upfront cost and as a large group you don't give a shit about some HS structure dying, as the relative cost per member and per dec is really low. 
---
As for mercenary groups well independent mercs kinda died with the war HQ changes, as you have to be able to stand up to well pirat in order to be a functional merc group in HS otherwise your structure will go boom and you will lose the wardec. ( see all the other groups merging into pirat ).
---
i dont get it
---
Testing...l had a full belly laugh at that one. Well done sir!
---
The reward is high for how it is now, post blackout, but thats only because player have put time and isk into making the space they rat and mine in profitable. (Dont believe me? Go to a unclaimed/ un-upgraded system in null and try running anoms there.) With the blackout in place the effort vs reward ratio isnt there.
---
CCP made ratting and mining in Null too much effort to be enjoyable. Which unfortunately meant people stopped playing as they stepped back and went "Do I want to play a game thats making it less and less fun for me to play so a small minority of players can have fun at my expense." And the answer that most people found was no.
---
I imagine this thread will end up at, "olmecca man bad!"
---
They already have like 2 devs left so…
---
I don't want to harm feeling of elite PVPers, but I don't think that EVE really has concept of skilled pilots.
---
The game complexity is expressed in inter-group interaction, cost of losing, consequences of decisions, ways of earning money, people management, process establishment, etc... The game does not embrace one-man-army, rather people and tactical skills matters. 
---
Eve is more about group but not individual achievements for me
---
Only when we need to sell blue and to buy new ship
---
Grrrr goons
---
I'd love to see where that was said as I distinctly remember CCP saying that there was going to be No change in ticks. Infact they reduced anom spawn rates in Null only the patch before the Blackout went live.
---
Ah ha! Don't you get it fools? This is the chaos! A deafening silence that keeps you on your toes. CCP has taken a page from modern horror movies and are working to build up the suspense by doing nothing then having no real payoff at the end. GENIUS!
---
&gt; CCP Rise says that they have
---
KPIs but it's tricky with the number of changes implemented to determine whether they were
---
achieved, we are working on better analysis
---
If only people had asked them to test things one at a time so they could, if nothing else, walk away with useful data.
---
See another great idea that CCP could use to implement Blackout.
---
It will never happen as CCP couldnt give 2 fucks about compromise or Balance.
---
"Aryth asks Dunk Dinkle if he would engage 20 Sleipnirs in 20 Thoraxes, he would come out ISK positive by just killing three of them. Dunk Dinkle doesn't want that, He wants the hostiles to get the hell out of his system."

---
Should we leave test again for our 13th y/n
---
Most people's experience with wormhole groups is the 3/4 C2/NS groups, they mostly do ganking because there isn't all that much small gang pvp left in nullsec and they can't escalate so people get killed and start complaining. 
---
Outside of that it's because wormhole space in the eye's of many shouldn't work, it has all the mechanics that nullsec claims case stagnation but somehow it's alive and doing relatively well.
---
Why would you leave NC. To join PH? Hiw has PH gone from.just noibie alliance to bigger and attracting more vet corps than PL and NC.
---
Are we seeing beginning of the end of NCPL
---
I think a big strength of goons is they concentrate on building and maintaining their economic power first and foremost. Then they use this power to feed their military power.
---
You can't just cherry-pick some events from long ago to try to argue that means EVE always works in a particular way.
---
Because there's a mountain of counter-examples.  These stand out because they were unusual events.
---
"big isk"
---
haha holy shit i was just cracking up at that
---
Right. If you could that would be great.
---
Have you spoken with a wormholer?
---
Fuck mouth-breathing gankbears.   ;-)
---
They are such a bad game dev. It's like they accidentally fell into this amazing game and don't know what to do now. It's a shame really.
---
And put it into reinforced?  So what?
---
It's like you guys don't even play the game.
---
.. and retarded and blind?
---
Well, yeah, obviously alphas can't run a gatecamp. Once you get a covops or astero you shouldn't die unless you're just bad
---
People camping sites is avoided if you aren't lazy, and do your work checking zkill, especially on people in corps that either don't normally belong in the area, or people in corps that camp frequently.
---
Null is fucked and needs way way more changes than the blackout was. I would have preferred it to stay. But hopefully that was just a test for chaos era.    
---
I haven't heard anything about JF changes, though the best thing CCP could do would be to flat remove jump freighters. Moving things around in low/null space should require major fleet ops. The ease of alliance logistics with JF is part of what's made nullsec complete krabland: nothing to fight over that has any value.
---
Good thing that stagnation and boringness isn't hurting the game.
---
OOS or Out of Sight is small npc null (based in Venal) alliance. If im not wrong Heavy Grapler or Pavel XL is a ex leader of OOS and i hear story like long time ago he accused of RMT and Botting. I think this China members know something about this guy and why they trolled him OOS botters. Not sure about all story at 100%, thets what i hear about this guys
---
For 2 reasons. Traditionally the worst krabs have lived in holes. They also have a holier than thou attitude. Those 2 things combined mean most folks look down on them.
---
Yerp
---
I blame the damn furries
---
Lot of stuff in there that I cant believe made the final minutes pass. I hope this provides additional insight into how the process works and what the CSM experience is like once you get in the meeting room. Just a bunch of nerds trying to work with other nerds to make a nerdy product more fun.
---
6/10s are the "shit" i dont understand why people dont run them more
---
What are you wondering about? I had pamfam's withdrawal to Dronelands come to mind. Which brings to mind (this is a theory) if goons took all those Titans and supers and left a token defence specifically to attract the jackals onto the dead weight Krabs who would not deploy.
---
Wont hear me say that.
---
Yeah I talked the entire stream and then i found out at the end of the stream that only my friends chat audio streamed lol.
---
I've been waiting since that announcement. It says summer 2019. The leaves are yellow and red outside. Deliver.
---
This is what I have been thinking too, that they are keeping quiet until Vegas.

---
Overall it's the best, yes. 
---
There are two other contenders but they're memes and a bad idea. 
---
The first is a T1 battleship, like the Apocalypse.  8 mining lasers, lots of lows, and ample fitting. It'll have about double the yield of a venture, but also about 100x the cost and a tiny cargo hold. Some people will gank these out of principal. 
---
The second is the mining miasmos. It has a huge ore hold but only one turret hardpoint and no bonuses to mining.  It will mine about 1/4 the speed of a venture, but can hold around 10x as much.  For AFK mining somewhere safe this can be better. But there's nowhere safe so that's moot. It also has no way to AFK defend against rats, so even if players don't blow you up rats will. 
---
Really the venture is the way to go. The bonus means it's like having 4 mining lasers, the ore hold is important, and it's cheap enough that it pays for itself in a trip or two.
---
And the effect of forcing bot out of null was the best bit of the Blackout. Except they didnt leave the game. You can see the same ex Null bots from KWG, Drone Lands and Frat are now in High Sec corps doing mission running and courier runs, now under the even safer protection of no war corps with Concord protection.)
---
But even if half of the leaving 30% were bots. That ment 15% of your paying playerbase stopped playing.
---
That is too large a loss for any game to take at once and come out safe the otherside without some Major course corrections.
---
Most people you see pooping on wormholers are linemembers in super duper huge nullsec groups, who typically try to blob wormholers with N+1 caps. Some of the groups kill those capitals occasionally, most others leave grid, and as such end up killing a few krabs and idiots before they get blobbed and roll/dock in their hole. A lot of the time you see these people complaining because wormholers won't fight their blob, disrupt their krabbing and from their viewpoint have no viable counter. These people pretty much complain about anything that disrupts PVE/Industry and realistically you can just ignore them - they aren't the military mastermind behind any of their groups, they're for the most part just nonames posting on reddit.
---
That being said a bunch of wormholers are insufferable.
---
Throw a scanner on and do some hisec combat sites. You can’t die if your monitor is on and there’s potential for 100m+ loot drops off the occasional pirate special spawn
---
rorquals who have compression always make my day. nothing to worry about when i can watch my proc mine goo for hours while sipping coffee
---
and don’t get me started on buybacks
---
Uhm..... do you? Cause if you did, you'd know that while the mobile depot is deploying it will not go into RF it will just die.....
---
&gt;Innominate mentions the attributes as an example of this complexity and how
---
important this system is. CCP Burger responds that it is a system that adds unnecessary
---
complexity and both the CSM and CCP agree it should just be removed.
---
We think learning attributes are bad, CSM thinks learning attributes are bad, CCP thinks learning attributes are bad.  
---
At what point can we get rid of learning attributes?

So... Seagull was right?
---
my corp is in fact always connected to kspace
---
Time is an issue here. Changes take development time.
---
As is replacing attribute implants in the LP store.
---
Solutions have been suggested (repeatedly. I think they're sick of me) but time is the real constraint.
---
GOD DAMN WORMHOLERS!  THEY RUINED WORMHOLES!
---
wormholer btw
---
Love to see this one go through. Having these remaps and shit not only makes it ridiculously complex but it often leaves newer players with this feeling that they have wasted a bunch of time by not being perfectly "optimized". Maybe you can leave attributes on various kinds of implants so people can still accomplish it who really want to but the average Joe just chugs along without every worrying about that stuff.
---
Correct.    And yet CCP turned of BO.   What does that tell you?
---
Did you actually read them this time, or are you still going by your gut reaction, which you posted less than a minute after I posted this topic here?
---
Says the guy watching local for neutrals about the guy watching the probe window for unknown signatures.
---
CCP dropped more content here than they have on TQ in the last year.
---
Underatandable, they're probably busy with all that stuff on the development roadmap... Oh wait
---
Don't be disingenuous.   You know damn well what games to which I'm referring.  If  you have a point, make it.
---
thx.
---
Olmeca Gold and Gobbins mentions preventing players from jumping through gates when scrammed. CCP Fozzie says this is to keep them in line with stargates.  
---
Fozzie! My man. Everyone can use a stargate. Not everyone can use a jump gate. They're not the same thing.
---
custom made, how many did u see? there were also some chinese bots that read overview and transmitted to another client blackout did not erase bots, it erased low effort mass produced bots. Now my turn, please explain to me this:

When you expect to fight against fleets with more logistics than you have ships, brawling just isn't viable. You have to out-manoeuvre the enemy fleet until there is an opening in their defenses for you to exploit. This isn't about being risk averse , but just how high level PVP is done. You'll see very similar tactics used in the alliance tournament, where the concept of risk aversion doesn't exist.

Did you actually read them this time, or are you still going by your gut reaction, which you posted less than a minute after I posted this topic here (and have subsequently deleted)
---
Or possibly after your second deleted comment?
---
Yes, recent blackout was interesting
---
i'm happy that i have classic wow to play with all my friends since eve died for me with the million scam for the anniversary event.  it's not much yet, but that event can take credit so far for at least $100 lost revenue.  probably just a rounding error to ccp

Events going Imperium vs Legacy war, and we need it for the game's future..

Lol uh maybe I didn't say it right. 
---
You can't contract something that is in a container in a courier. So if I fill a can of stuff make a contract to push or frog they can't contract that item to anyone else * this is kinda how they work* thus making any public structures extreamly risky to work with.
---
Does that make sense?
---
That's not really a problem, this was always true in the PoS days for the large groups, it would be true in the citadel days even without alphas. My suggesting the idea already assumes this is the case. Having a pilot there is easy, that's fine. Having someone able to respond has always been the trick.
---
God damn CCP is retarded
---
In a year full of annoyances this one is right up there. I read that as they wanted it to be the same as stargates because they are re-using that code and this is the year they decided to do no coding.
---
Where are the Angel capitals?
---
It used to be unlimited for some time after they updated it. But then CCP decided to make it limited -_- I don't remember why
---
I don't understand
---
What's the relationship between ur mum and the turf war

ahahha true, that canadien fix spy !

\&gt; We even playtested a new in-development feature and had an hour and a half long AMA session with CCP Hellmar
---
Freudian slip?
---
&gt;Or possibly after your fourth deleted comment?
---
It has to do with there blue doughnut ideas not working in wh space cause a few minutes can change your neighbor. Also they don't generally understand the work that corps do to make there life slightly less a pain in the ass.
---
ahaha, i am awesome at following rules ;)
---
daily active user, monthly active user?
---
Hellmar's his CCP name.
---
When your cyno dies to rats you don't waste a cyno. Clearly you dont hot drop on shit. Also, botting doesn't cost them effort. Its CPU time which is scalable via VMs to the max their computer can handle. So they do not work 75H. The cost of a resource is relative to the supply. Of overall supply is down the cost goes up. So ratting in 10 ishtars is still potentially profitable as long as it covers monthly plex and still can be sold for cheaper then plex to isk conversion. The fact that you reddit warriors think botting was impacted at all is hilarious. When everyone else stopped ratting because it was less safe I promise you the botters didnt care and adapted faster then the changes were made. Addtionally, as was posted about a month ago here, there is a logger leak that allows your client to detect when someone is on grid with you cloaked, or enters system. It was verified by several people. Coding a bot to watch a log is easy and it's used for many SA tools for large alliances to watch Intel channels.

Hoo boy, here we go.

&gt; Merkelchen asks what measurements does CCP use reliably categorize players as pilots living in highsec, nullsec, etc. CCP Larrikin clarifies that it is based on where they spend most of their active time in the game. This confirms that Aryth, Merkelchen, and Innominate are all highsec pubbies. Aryth suggests excluding Jita from these metrics as they are probably just alts and may not accurately reflect the actual type of a player.
---
How is daily active users different from the daily active customers mentioned on the Blackout section?
---
Never claimed that we didn't engage in similar behavior. In fact, my claim is that we *do* engage in similar behavior. J-brains like to pretend that they can't.
---
&gt; They just worry about a change that would cause a max exodus of players
---
Jokes on them, their inability to make even the most basic changes is whats causing the mass exodus of players.
---
I enjoy WH groups
---
 Some of best fights i have had where against them. And they aint no joke. Bunch bling fit frigates just.hammering shit in their way. Gotta respect em.
---
there are lot's of fantasy and urban legends about WH. Especialy from 0.0 guys who never lived there. We can krab several bilions isk/h all day long long with 100% safety. some WHers (few in fact) are realy elitst (even between diferents WH "castes").  
---
In french I could say "he fart above their asses"  
---
Maybe that's why some guys don't like us. We don't know and we don't care. That's why we love the WH, we don't give a fuck about people opinion.  
---
To be clear : yes there are turbokrabs in WH, small chill corps and big corps, sometime a kind of blue donut, sometime a toxic guy and lot's of pvp. Just like every where else
---
What did he said?
---
They learned ancient art of blue balls.
---
When a "fanfest" happens and all they have to announce at it are some new visuals and changes to one ship... phew... lol.
---
&gt; Dunk Dinkle asks for Tech II salvage drones
---
The hero we need
---
Expulso That also affect time to get into warp? It balances out if the miner takes longer too.
---
Because most of us have a content driver mentality, and we don't aspire to be an NPC in this game.
---
&gt; Olmeca Gold asks if the Alliance Tournament is gone forever. CCP Dopamine says the 
---
community team would really like to see the AT come back because they understand that it was 
---
special to an important group of EVE players. CCP Falcon says he loves the AT and has a long 
---
history with it. He identifies some issues in bringing it back including space to produce the 
---
stream, the development time to make sorely needed updates to the tournament tools, staffing the tournament since in the past it's been a passion project and relies on CCP volunteers, and 
---
general stagnation of the format of the tournament.
---
  So, we went from "there'll definitely be an AT next year, it's just a one year hiatus" to "uuuuh maybe we don't have any resources to make one".
---
  F
---
This was main reason to kill it even faster with Chaos era :D
---
The gate cloak is a lol.  “let me cloak and dscan where my targets are without them knowing for easy kills plz”

Hunt things that fight back
---
Lol. Third time you’ve posted it. Let’s see if you delete it again after getting smacked down.
---
If you do take commissions I would like to aquire a Hel.
---
No, there are definitely people who think that highsec is too safe. You can find them on the forums and Reddit both. No idea if they're right or wrong, I'm just going to sit back and observe so I can learn more.
---
I'm waiting for the retard to post on it again
---
Just add it to the pile of lies.  Careful, the pile is so big there may be an avalanche.
---
They cry harder than everyone else to get advantages to ruin other people’s fun.
---
They cry harder than anyone else about safety while they all make their isk undisturbed compared to everything but the mega alliances
---
Point is they just cry.  And they get RIDICULOUSLY mad and aggressive when questioned on what they do, they’re just unpleasant individuals with a mixture of elitist and entitlement mentalities
---
Sure.  Some might not be.  But the majority are.
---
Hurts the most when I realize my first year in game was with them. I remember the era of having our station undock camped by PL supers and being extremely excited to throw some atrons at a roaming dread. Now we're here. Rose tinted glasses maybe but it feels like brave was so different back then, we got farmed but we were kindred spirits.
---
RIP C6 space
---
I guess they are implying they bot missions in venal
---
you have completely no idea what you are talking about so its ok, branch malpais cobalt edge etc losing almost 90% of their ratting activity, was real players leaving? Massively used bots like h\*\*\* / m\*\*\*\*\*\*b and i\*\*\*\*\*\*r cannot START working unless you have local and supposing you could speak in local so you show up and it aknowledges the local chat as local (doesnt work if it shows empty or even if it is any other color than the black one) it offered completely NO COUNTERPLAY if someone entered system, they werent checking dscan and only responded to you once you decloaked on their site and even then they wouldnt warp out cause they never leave their drones out so they had to recall which meant by that time they were already caught.   
---
Do custom made bots exist? Yes they do. Did they work with blackout? Yes they did. Did massive botting got nerfed during blackout? Yes it did.   
---
Btw way to move the goalposts from fw to 0.0 printing again cause numbers werent adding up.
---
Which is fucking hilarious, because they don't realize that no matter how many times they change the first 30 minutes of the game, players aren't gonna stick around when they're funneled into 15 year old shit PVE afterwards.
---
Oooh, are we getting our own “spodbrain” insult variant? That’d be rather fun
---
I’m merely saying large scale wars dont have plans that exceed 1mo out. I have been in the majority of the large scale wars since fall 2011.
---
wormholers are like veagans, they cry an complain about everyone who isn't a wormholer. They also have to announce that they are wormhole to everyone.
---
While I would like to see attribute remapping leave, I wouldn't mind keeping attribute implants how they are. You have a couple months of per/will skills in your queue at the moment? Pop in a perception and a willpower implant to speed things up. And implants can easily be pulled out, no worrying about 1 year lock on your training (if you want optimal training).
---
Concentrated players with defensible space.
---
Civil people having opposing views on the CSM is important.
---
&gt;CCP Nemesis asks if smartbomb battleships in anomalies are bottable, the CSM says that this is
---
the case and is a common tactic. CCP Nemesis asks if they have heard of any verified
---
supercarrier bots and the CSM says absolutely. CCP Nemesis asks if anyone is actually titan botting and Vily says yes.
---
&gt;CCP Nemesis reaches for a bottle of Jack Daniels.
---
&gt; We're up to what, a dozen starter experience changes in the last couple years before it dumps you in the same shitty career agents?
---
And they're getting progressively *worse*.
---
attribute x = 25

attribute y = 25

attribute z =25

attribute xx = 25

attribute yy = 25

Pay me millions of dollars ccp
---
Be nice.  Hilmtard's niece is the lead dev, and 4 year olds have a hard time with attention span, its not her fault.
---
Reading those minutes makes me want to quit eve, like really wormhole space is the whole CSM and CCP is clueless with ExookiZ doing what is effectively a welcome to wormhole space speech ( like this basic mechanical knowledge not some deep secret you can google this ). 
---
Then we have Aryth trolling the whole session injecting horrible idea's for wormhole space ( i'm hoping he's trolling because the alternative is worse ). 
---
The rest of the minutes really not all that much better, I'm wondering where the CSM got there positive feeling from after that meeting.
---
Dear god please don't nerf any sub cap logi
---
Hey buddy
---
Too real
---
CCP has allotted 15 minutes of development time per month for Eve. Sorry, that doesn't leave enough room for the AT.
---
Is anybody shocked the AT is cancelled like most people called that last year.
---
*EVE Playerbase
---
so what,eve  will die?
---
I mean, they kinda did.  Anyone responsible for EVE's success left the company a long time ago, the current retards (other than Hilmar, but he was AFK when the game was actually good) literally are coasting on someone else's work.
---
you see powers this is why these conversations suck, time and time again branch drones and others have proven that they are botting regions but for the sake of being right people will ignore AND FORGIVE everything.  Concentrated players with defensible space, in branch, man i dont know what to say anymore. So out of touch.
---
LOL we announce it cause we find it funny how triggered others get by it. Wormholer BTW
---
Oh I always thought it was CCP Hilmar my bad!
---
They could absolutely give this out. If they knew what was going to break next so it would be a “feature” and not them having broken shit.
---
point proven
---
Excellent as usual and great choice of music. Fucking loved it. I missed your videos.
---
We still have a community team?
---
Wormholers are Vegans
---
What do you need an unlimited skill queue for, don’t you all have phones?
---
Removing attributes and remaps is one of the best things CCP could do for new players and would have very little impact on veteran players.
---
Yes point proven that you are Triggered
---
You mean that *BRAVE* doesn't do long term planning.    That's not meant as a dig.   You guys don't tend to initiate large-scale wars, that's all.  
---
Other nullsec alliances do put more work into their war planning ... particularly if they are the ones doing the invading.
---
How can I upvote more than once?
---
then don't.
---
just flat out normalising attributes would go a long way.
---
remove remaps and set all attributes to the same value. that's pretty much the same as removing them. then it just comes down to learning implants which aren't as bad as the whole remap bullshit.
---
Do you have any examples?
---
Fifth time, actually. :)
---
I suspect he thinks he's being witty, or smart.
---
I dont think sobby posts will work. Except for karma whoring.
---
&gt;Me, a lowly alpha, who probably won’t even be able to afford one

:(
---
I appreciate to fly solo in a battleship and run into a gate camp, lock up targets and after the lock timer has finished after some 10 seconds there are still some frigates and/or cruisers within scram range, securing me at least a kill or two before I die horribly. In this way Eve is still somewhat predictable.
---
If you're talking to yourself why are you burdening us with the text?
---
They are normal sized fish but they live in a very, very small pond. The pond has alot of isk in it. Once a week they might get a small fight and that makes them feel elite.
---
Their local game is the worst in all of eve by quite a large margine.The  ass end of heimatar has better local bants than all of wormhole space.
---
J-Brain BTW
---
\&gt; rip eve
---
It's just /u/joecuster being an idiot, as normal. Maybe he thinks he's being edgy, or possibly original. Nah, not the latter. Not even he could be that dumb. Just following along with people smarter than he is. (which is hardly difficult, honestly)
---
Not sure how you came to that conclusion without seeing any emotion.
---
how are we defining 'active'?
---
cos like, logging in and being afk while at work isn't active. nor is logging in for 30 seconds to update a skill queue and logging out again.
---
Killah rather play wow classic than participating in the CSM meeting in RL.
---
Glad I voted for you.
---
Fight CSM leaks by not participating!
---
I can think of 4 right now and all of them have big issues. 
---
Star Citizen - Scam  
---
Dual Universe - basically just space engineers multiplayer with a few more features, terrible surprise for EVE fans that are banking on it.
---
No Man's Sky - drove away too many people with the flop start to be taken serious.
---
Elite Dangerous - let's not kid ourselves, that game is just straight up bad.
---
I helped evict notorious botters, White Noise. from branch in december 2011. I see the same numbers from people who don’t bot in Delve.  They hole up in a pipe. Horde and others pvped the shit out of current branch people.
---
What are you going to do? I would consider the people who might bot in siberian squad and ranger regiment to be in the minority. I’ve tackled ranger regiment guys who are ratting and gotten hotdropped on, so the guys I tackled in anoms weren’t bots.

More Ships need to explode. Logi in its current form is bad.
---
That's the half assed version of removal. 
---
To go to three quarter assed, you'd also want to remove the attribute screen, to get rid of any mention of remaps. Though that would get confusing as you'd no longer have any mention to let people know why they'd want learning implants. So maybe just the remap button. But that's still not fully assed. 
---
Fully assed would be ripping out attribute implants, removing all mention of attributes, and adding in time limited boosters (like the cerebral accelerators, which persist through death) which are available through the LP stores, giving a flat percentage boost to training times.
---
You can go out to null and mission for them!
---
Who are those on the picture?
---
Anyone know what it's saying?
---
Steam account has a unique steam login and characters on that account don't show up on standalone. 
---
Standalone accounts can be added to steam account and accessed through steam. 
---
I usually buy steam bundles on sale, and transfer from my steam character to my other account character, which I already access through steam.
---
This actually makes me sad as a person who started in brave
---
Saying what?
---
...How do you know someone is vegan,  LGBTQ, very religious, does crossfit, owns a dog but doesn't have children, or lives in a wormhole?  
---
Don't worry. They will tell you.  
---
Add any other obnoxious group who thinks they are cool because of who they are or what they do even though nobody actually gives a shit. :)  
---
P.S. Wormholer BTW...  
---
P.S.S. Just kidding, tool.  
---
:P
---
That's assuming 1 day per skill,you could have to log in after a few days if you trained a bunch of skills to level 1
---
Noted, guy.   Apologies for triggering your epeen.
---
Ye except, even on my pirate mission char(because I don’t want to really get negative standing with the high-sec regions and get attacked on sight) my best is being able to do level 2 Serpentis missions :/
---
Witty. I am cut to the bone.
---
Well I guess I've got my answer.
---
Clearly not ones knows it's a thing in the first place.
---
If you put a container say a freight can in a contract. That contract can no longer be contracted again. So it can't be double wrapped or even given to an alt to deliver unless done through trade window. Does that make sense?
---
This makes perfect sense. I'll probably do this exact thing.
---
Why u get erect from insult u freak
---
What all can alphas fly? I don't know about dealing with other people but a domi/raven should be able to do l4
---
Seriously.  Clicking an icon isn't "skill."
---
Everyone in this thread says we cry about shit, but the only people crying right now are you nullbabies freaking out because we assfucked you the split second you entered a real no mans land.
---
So pick a system where the anomalies are off scan from the gate.
---
Wow, suddenly certain space has value again!
---
Sounds cool. Would like a tag like that.
---
What is your point?
---
That bots exist?
---
We all know that already.
---
Most Wormholes can't maneuver capital ships like Null seccers, so any fight they start is generally a gank or hit and run. They don't want to participate in the obviously enjoyable N+1 Capital Escalations that isn't very common in J space.
---
Merklechen addressing rorquals. Finally. Bless.
---
Not even. They’re just going to tell you that I’m a shitposter, but help you understand the mistake in your post.
---
Wait when did that happen??
---
Not sure why you keep replying
---
Another mouth breather who wants to see 321 logons in eve.  But as long as they play the game your way,  it's ok.
---
Remove asset safety for All but forts and keeps, and have those limited to same system, maybe constellation for keep, must place a new fort to access.
---
yo yo
---
Thought you might like those back. Still doesn't fix your grammar, but I can only help you so much. You have to do the rest yourself.

i found my first corp, and being the only woman in there i get so much help! hope to become a useful logi soon ^_^

As opposed to having max reward vs minimal risk with local?
---
Happy bday brothers and sisters!
---
He claims some thing that isn't true and doesn't back it up with facts. So ya his post is worthless.
---
Sure. It's still much better than clock speed though.
---
As clock speed only tells you how many cycles it is doing, not how much actual work is getting done.
---
Teraflops isn't perfect either, but it's better than clock speed.
---
Soon tm
---
1 yes after the initial sign on. You don't need steam anymore.butntonmakebthe acc yes you do.
---
2 no there is no "steam" launcher it's all the same thing. Steam accs are just tied to your steam email afaik. But I only have one.
---
3 idk Visa debit card? Lol getting a cc isn't hard either tho. I think ccp accepts PayPal lol. Maybe steam is the best way. Idk.
---
You should avoid steam unless your getting the bundels tho.
---
Okay a serious post, the r/eve wormholers tend to be shit lords that have no manners and are toxic af, or at least most of them are. I've mostly lived in null, so when ever they are running loose, they just want to to gank. They will shit talk, and be edgy af. 
---
The reality is that most wormholers are nice to their kind if you can get in their circle. They aren't complete asshats to each other. For some odd reason they demand some space bushido? quite often.There are wormhole people that are actually nice upfront, or at least don't belittle you.
---
Maybe this is just a meme, but wormholers tend to just outright ignore you play style. They would rather you feed then to form up and fight them. They usually fly nano so chasing them is rather futile. Most people that are not wormholers are not that well versed in the art of pvp, nor do they have to. So when people say, "just fight' it usually ends in the slaughter. Very few wormhole corps will respect everyone. 
---
Wormhole people on r/eve are shitlords. Ignore r/eve as it does not represent the WH community entirely.
---
That I can't speak to, as CCP haven't shared that with us.
---
I did ask about the definition though. Received some assurance that is was more involved.
---
You must be new around these parts
---
It used to be that you could chop and change the order of it before committing to the changes. CCP decided that was bad too.
---
Well, for one thing, we can only get 5 million free SP, but can hold up to 20 million from injectors/expire omega; so as such ya kinda outta specialize in one faction as an alpha; on my main it’s Gallentte, on my Alt(which I’m currently training up) it’s Caldari
---
Anyway, we can fly t1 ships, including faction ships like federation navy or some pirate and such ships; we can fly up to battleships(t1 Heavy weapons tho, whereas we can get t2 small and medium, but not heavy)
---
Also, no cloaks, not even prototype cloaks :(
---
forgot vaping in there
---
One that's growing, actually
---
Just give everyone unlimited recaps and leave in implants for now as is.
---
I bet u don't eat ass u degenerate
---
Not to mention that most active gates currently have a Chain Doomsday protecting it that will instantly kill any sub-capital ship.
---

If you put container in a contract it becomes container-in-container situation and start some fuckery with legacy code adding a ton of limitation on what you can do with it and the creature above is trying to tell us it's f'd in the A. 
---
To which I can reply "duh" and point to the graveyard of ideas that CCP made over the last decade and a half. Doubt it's gonna get fixed before EVE is ded.
---
It seems very important to you that I (or we) know who you are.  Why don't you just tell us?    If I'm wrong about Brave, fine.  Educate me.   (Assuming, of course, you aren't flair baiting.)
---
You must be some sort of null bloc leader with experience with this sort of thing.  I'd love to know more.
---
Is there a statute that says I have to?
---
i guess they got tired of the smell that is a rotting alliance

Max thonk
---
I'm starting to sound like a broken record... but
---
Tiericide and new implants? - Not even a single mention of it.
---
Despite that, the discussions on all topics were pretty sound and interesting.
---
Many on board audio cards can also record the output.
---
First enable it. It is most likely disabled by default.  
---
On windows 10: Sound settings -&gt; Manage sound devices -&gt; Stereo Mix in the input section. Set it to enabled.
---
If the stereo mix is not listed there you can try downloading drivers from manufacturer.
---
Then on the sound settings set your sound input to "Stereo Mix".
---
Now your audio output is being used as your audio input. Any program that can record audio from mic will now record the audio output. 
---
Audacity is free and should have all features you need.
---
you do realize there are multiple renters living in branch and other areas in the north and not only ranger regiment and sb-sq live there (who bot as well a lot) like blood demons citizens squads and during blackout many others that have left now like dead heaven etc. if you claim that branch from NUMBER ONE REGION IN THE UNIVERSE in june in rat kills fell bellow 20th because of real people, you are naive and i know you are not naive but you are trying to prove a non-existent point.
---
Honestly this is the solution to perfect Intel unless they're going to do observatories.. if blackout proved anything it's that no local is to good for the hunters. So we need to find the balance between perfect instant Intel and no Intel at all. IMHO the gate cloak is the easiest way to impliment such a thing.
---
And so what if they can DScan you it's literally the same in wh space. You have one min to find me before you decloak and I know your there. That seems fair.
---
You can't blob wormholes without a *fuckton* of pre planning and praying your target doesn't notice your eviction fleet. That's why most null blocs hate them.
---
“They fly nano ships so chasing them is futile.” 
---
I’ve never understood that logic. Why not just form your own nano ships and fight?
---
Sooo can't read this cuz you can't find the enter button.. it's just a wall of text.. sorry mate.
---
What? Are we going to ignore the countless threads where wormholers 'complain' about why they left the game because of capitals. Are we going to ignore the countless statements made that small gang is dying? (which I can agree with) Or are you going to ignore that?
---
The problem of CCP is consistency, not the lack of ability to throw a wrench in the works. I've never seen another game dev company flip flop so much in such a short time on so many gameplay features.
---

This can only be good for the meta.

&gt;Aryth suggests making the AT grand prize the Palatine Keepstar gets moved to the location of the winner’s choice.
---
How would they not know the answer to that? Can't they just fly an invisible ship that's not on local and teleport around the areas that are accused of botting and look?
---
Its not summer in Australia...
---
Why do people have to conform to your nano ships?
---
Unable to make basic changes like blackout?
---
Max reward lmao.

You don’t. I don’t mean to suggest that at all. You can fly whatever you want. But ONE effective way of fighting nano is with other nano instead of just staying docked. It’s one almost assured way to keep the opposing nano gang on grid as well. Undocking 20 supers or a 200 man eagle fleet, which is the usual response, will NOT yield content.
---
This. We also have weird cult-like tendencies and pagan worshipping. Not just my corp, I'm talking almost every wh group that's out there that I got in touch with, and I spy for a living.
---
Finally out :D
---
Let me get that right.
---
You're in the salt mine... Asking what's up with all the salt?
---
I didn't think it could be summarized so well in three words, but there it is.
---
Praise be to bob
---
I would assume a lot of their profit margin is also boosted from stealing the money people pay them for assets/ISK and then also gaining access to those player's accounts and stealing all their in game assets/ISK.
---
Wait, are you saying CCP did not follow through on something? They must be too busy working on their unannounced MMO project; but, hey! The *did* change the name of the armor implants from "Slaves" to "Amulets!" That's something, right?
---
I am not sure what you mean by "WH Space is the whole CSM"? Unfortunately, i think the WH session taught a lot of people things they didnt already know, so while it absolutely may seem like it weas just a silly welcome to WH intro, it gave  devs making decisions a lot of info.
---
Yeah it's bullshit, ironically horde is more brave then brave these days.
---
Actually, the best way to counter them is with webs. But quite often when people do this, the nano ships run away. If you wanted content you'd bring something more fun. I've seen very few wormholers willing to bring brawl ships into null. I respect them A LOT. Obviously null isn't the best place for content, but don't be surprised that when you bring kitey nano ships, you get a counter to them.
---
Why argue with the truth?
---
You mean the will to brave the \~legacy\~code\~ and attempt to make a change.
---
Why are they asking for the esi to give them more intel so they can find players. Why should this info be available for free.  I d prefer the fog of war method.
---
I heart this so much, you have no idea. CCP you should mean what your say. Language constructs the world around us, and this is decidedly some words that do not construct a picture that corresponds with reality. :D
---
I doubt it is trolling, Aryth represents Nullsec, and Nullsec feels like wormholers have been on a campaign to fuck with them.  So, nullsec has decided to try and fuck with you a bit.
---
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.
---
In GE- they post "Go to FW if you want fights"
---
Wrong! People who don't roam all day in bombers and live in wormholes add absolutely nothing to the game.
---
"CCP Fozzie asks who would want
---
to have asset safety removed in nullsec, people show hands, he then asks who of those would
---
do it for the betterment of the game and now there were no hands."
---
&gt;  it gave devs making decisions a lot of info.
---
how. do. they. not. already know this shit?
---
can CCP hire someone with people skills who takes information from the players to the devs?
---
I would love for such an Eve. But it isnt possible with the current amount of players. New Eden is too big and if you live somewhere in bumfuck wherever you wont have enough roamers to make it worth having a standing subcap fleet. Cause you need a rather large one to actually cover a region and you cant fully defend still since there are WHs that can drop a full fleet on the other side of the region. So how are you gonna defend yourself before you get tackled?
---
Reality is, the low amount of roamers will result in a small standing subcap fleet. Big fleets being able to randomly drop behind enemy lines whilst being ultramobile and very OP in general requires caps/supers. At some point it just becomes easier to drop caps/supers on everything which will dry up roamers which in turn will dry up the want/need for a subcap fleet.
---
And fighters and titans got a pretty harsh nerf not long ago. They are really not that good anymore. And we even have the cyno change now. Its still not doing what people are saying it will, bring back playstyles. I dont think anything would honestly.
---
Reason being rather simple, the issue isnt just the blocs. You can keep nerfing blocs all you want, it wont give you the result you want. Blocs are just scape goats for all that is wrong in Eve. But theres a lot of issues with the game. And forgetting about the most important, we have too few players, will make every change fall short.
---
TLDR: Nobody is gonna have a standing subcap fleet for some potential roamers in deep null. And if they do they wont be able to actually fight the big fleets and need to use big toys for that.
---
&gt;Arythpoints out that scamming has been mentioned a lot throughout the meeting and suggests that they should ban scamming rookies for 30 days
---
How would this even work? if someone with less than 30 days of gameplay sends you isk as a result of your double your isk ad and you don;t send it back doubled you;re getting banned? or what if they fall for your margin trading scam? you get banned? Or what if they give you your stuff to move to null sec and the jf "dies" alog the way? what happens then?
---
I never understood why they defined 'new player experience' as the first 30m to 2 hours of the game. In Eve, you are a new player for *at least* the first month or two of gameplay.
---
Hallowed be his name, for bob giveth and bob taketh away...
---
The wormhole space section in the minutes, sorry that's likely not the best writing in the universe. 
---
So the wormhole section in the minutes is the whole csm and ccp being clueless about wormhole mechanics and listing to a newbro speech. 
---
I'm not blaming you here for giving it, but the level of ignorance is really unacceptable for what are the 8/9 other people representing the player base (let alone the level of ignorance from the developer).
---
You may be right as well, as long as you acknowledge that nobody has an entitlement to a playstyle free from interference by other players. Everything is subject to PvP.
---
Where have you been the last two months? I think it is mainly blow back for how annoying most (not all) WHs were during the whole 'blackout' thing. Particularly that guy who was all, "what do you mean null sec isn't profitable anymore, you have no imagination... why don't you null sec guys just day trip into wormholes?"
---
I honestly don't get why they would rename the sets. It is just going to cause confusion when people read older (ie, anything put out even today) documents on what implants are good for what.
---
Just name the new implants something different that what already exists in the world.
---
The tools required to make the AT happen are essentially GM tools. CCP has been (understandably) less than keen on providing those to organizers on Tranquility. Honestly, even with a full license to +10 Gaming to act as an an official Tournament Organizer, it's likely beyond their scope.
---
it's kind of a weird question because CCP has teleported verified botting titans to highsec to kill in their 'bot killing' events. some of which were titans who were initially banned/hadn't logged in for years.
---
Wouldn't that be a clear case of meta gaming the CSM ?
---
Don't know what her thought was.
---
I'm not knocking any playstyle or judging anyone.. I'm just resigned to the fact that my craving for a 'dangerous world' to play in is so niche, it can never really be realized (funded) on MMO scale.
---
Honestly they just need to flat tax them and let anyone use them. Either that or re-introduce jump fatigue. 
---
Right now they make space feel absolutely dead for roamers, because no one has to actually use a regular gate.
---
What happened to CCP Socket Closed?
---
The CSM is the definition of meta game.
---
leave it to wingspan to bring the torps
---
69 is the sex number.
---
Im not sure id go that far.
---
Because its probably tied to a bunch of other shit that will break the game since this system hasn't been touched since like 2004
---
Correct, which was my initial critique I think I got down voted into oblivion for. Having no road map, or guiding purpose, is a terrible way to run an MMO. Throwing random mechanics changes at the wall without forethought into how they will affect the rest of the game, is bad game management. 
---
Being completely unwilling to even announce that something that will require actual dev time (versus just turning some switches in the database on and off) demonstrates, whether it is the case or not, that the company no longer has: the capacity or desire to do significant development on the game, and that the game is not in maintenance mode.
---
Do what mr_eti said just to see if anything is there worth looting. What did you really lose? Is it so expensive that you need to fly back to get it?
---
Since you still have the mission, fit properly, do the mission before it expires and loot your own wreck.
---
You’re fine with the ingame maps perfect intel
---
Just not with the other side using it
---
If you want anything to be fair advocate for more than JUST one side
---
I wasn’t aware that it was sustained for 6months. That is pretty problematic.
---
A guess from someone who doesn't know anything about anything. Maybe a customer is someone who paid? So either people with sub, alphas who paid for alpha injectors, people who buy PLEX, etc.
---
I hope you’re not implying webs are somehow exclusive from nano gangs (ever heard of a Hyena or a Huginn)? Won’t see my alliance running from an even remotely engageable comp that includes those. 
---
We’ve also never been afraid to drop heavy armor or dreads in null. The thing that gets old is having 20 supers dropped on your 3 man nano gang. Or shit, even your 20 man heavy armor gang. That’s not a counter, it’s just a fuck you leave our space. 
---
That’s maybe the difference between WHs and null that you’re not defining well. In WHs even where a lot of times dreads/fax are easily possible to bring, we don’t because we’d rather actually fight, which brings me back to my original point. Why not undock and fight it out and risk losing a ship or two, instead of rage pinging for 100 eagles and 20 logi with supers on standby? Fighting is fun, which is why it should be encouraged, not ultra-hard countered in the best way possible.
---
I honestly could scroll through the reddit, but i won’t.  They’ll flame and downvote me hard here with or without me putting in more effort
---
But i just answered your question
---
Oh no, i’m just flairbaiting. If were on mumble or jabber at all, you’d know this.
---
The real reason they are nerfing logi is because they want to nerf it so bad that people forget about adding logi to killmails.
---
Have faith
---
I suspect some of those were the fruits of botting and not the actual botting ship in some cases.
---
I would assume a lot of their profit margin is also boosted from stealing the money people pay them for assets/ISK and then also hacking/gaining access to those player's Eve and Bank accounts and stealing all their money as well as in game assets/ISK.
---
You got to realize a lot of these RMT types might not actually have ever played Eve for any personal interest and setting up bots in a virtual game is just one of many skills in their criminal career. RMT itself only being a means to gaining access to people's personal info and accounts for real money and more assets they can easily steal to use and sell back to other RMT customers.
---
I'd say very few are supposed average RMT bot who simply got into the trade after learning how to cheat in a game they have played for awhile but simply criminals learning another way to make money illegally.
---
Fighting PL in Fade is still one of my best Eve memories. I know, looking back, that PL was intentionally fighting with one arm behind its back, but the fights felt big and meaningful \*because\* home was at stake, and we were so clearly outgunned. Trying to delay a couple of carriers on an in-gate was amazing fun as a new player. 
---
So was trying to catch Grath and Cotty's bouncy Marauders (and usually failing), but that wasn't existential - it was just them being dumb, having fun, and sharing some of it with us.
---
Yep can confirm it was repeated at fanfest 2015
---
It's because of nesting and how that works.
---
So in case you didn't know, you can only have 10,000 unique stacks in any hangar or container. This is to preserve performance. You can also only have a nesting depth of 2, so you can have a container inside a hangar (effectively a container itself) or a container inside a ship but you cannot have a container within that. Besides effectively creating a hard limit of 10^(8) items within a single location, this nesting limit also prevents an infinite space exploit. Secure containers are actually bigger on the inside than they are on the outside, so if you could infinitely nest them you could with every nesting get some "free" volume and thus create an infinite volume of, say, cap charges or warp disrupt probes. That would be balance-breaking and also cancerous on both sides of the usage.
---
Packing containers must also be subject to this restriction because you can create packing containers at will, so having them exempt to the nesting restriction would be problematic at least for the issue of nesting depth beyond 10^(8) stacks.
---
where does it say 69?
---
\*Everybody
---
Which is why my suggestion is, let everyone use jump gates to make them even more like stargates
---
I mean, or this can just not be an unnecessarily annoying hurdle
---
The chaos failure showed that randomly adjusting annoyances for one side to appease another is shit
---
I had this problem earlier this year. I hope CCP don’t mind me sharing the workaround they told me about. It also fixed an issue where everything in the UI seemed blurry:
---
Create a new profile and launch your account using the new profile.
---
- Start the launcher.
---
- Login to the account in question - but don't click play to enter the game.
---
- Click on the Cog wheel next to the account in the launcher window.
---
- Click on manage profiles.
---
- Click on new profile and give it a name like 'testing' or something and press enter.
---
- Click close.
---
- Select the checkbox for the newly created profile.
---
- Close the options window.
---
Now click play, the account should now launch with the new profile you just created. The newly created profile will have its settings restored to the default options, hopefully resolving your issue.
---
not when engine fail and pistons starting to smash the ccp office.
---
Why do we ping for eagles and basi's when you form to 'fight'? The answer is easy, you will stomp on MOST people easily. The strange thing I find about worm holers is that you insist that people fight. What if they don't want to? Or can't? I've come across people that no matter what they do, they can't pvp well for what ever reason. They simply do because they have no choice. This only applies to the bigger groups. I remember a long time ago, I decided to fight a worm hole group in my rattlesnake 1v5 and came out on top. What was the response? Had 30 fucking gilas and basi's coming out the wormhole looking to kill me. I was not under some 'super umbrella' at that time. I did not have 30+ nerds to ping. Why do you demand people conform to your play style?
---
Not a wormholer, but I do often visit (spent last evening in one, for example - alt in Signal Cartel), and my first nearly 3 years of Eve was spent living in w-space.
---
I think it may have something to do with the hit-and-run nature of wormhole life, which makes retaliation very impractical.  Also some of the benefits of nulsec without many of the risks of nulsec (aside from no asset safety).
---
Lastly, despite small numbers compared to nulsec, they are a vocal community, and often are able to 'bend the ear' of CCP.
---
It's out of context, but run with the meme anyways.
---
I do think at some point they should probably condense the map for that reason, it's pretty annoying to go 20 jumps from places to find content.  It would also solve Eve's problem of time:content ratio, the vast majority on a lot of activities seem like travel is the biggest time consumer.
---
Lol you think ccp has more than one dev and he's working on eve on anything but making new bad skins
---
Imagine being this salty.
---
Just pretend they are gate guns /s
---
I see you switched to firefox

---
Promises made, promises kept

It would take the serious talent away from planning all of the mediocre Eve \*enter sad city name here\* events.
---
Until they fix AFK cloaky camping, I'll never be persuaded that CCP is run by anything other than fucking morons who couldn't pass a 2nd-grade exam on any subject.
---
Dear lord... Welcome to few hours ago.
---
I think it was brought more of a catch-term than an event with beginning and end-date. It means theyre in the mood to try different things
---
may his passing cleanse this world
---
I don’t think I’m convincing you, not that I need to. My point isn’t about play styles or even really about wanting to fight. 
---
It’s more that fighting is fun. And in null there’s too much of the time, an anchor and F1 mentality, that people grow quickly complacent with and that’s boring. So it’s that or nothing while there’s a whole dimension of pvp that’s completely untouched (small and nano gang). It’s not THAT hard to manually pilot but the mentality of null is that it’s “scary,” and those that do it are super l33t. I’ve spent time there so I know - it’s a meme on comms to even mention manually piloting. 
---
More people should try it. And if you don’t want to fight then fine, stay docked or bring your supers, and enjoy your no fun allowed zone.
---
Un-ironically this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNuu9CpdjIo
---
Ah yes, the Elite Suitonia, thinks a good fight is his 120mil SP pilot in a kestrel getting to demolish 5mil so new to in an strong.
---
Agreed. Firefox is a definite improvement.
---
You poop on WHers because that's how you make more WHers.  Otherweise, what would you do with all that poop?
---
Can confirm, was WHer.
---
Main reason I found this annoying is creating skill plans in evemon, then attempting to import them. What results is the above.
---
So, I have to manually add a bunch of the lvl 1-3 skills, wait two days THEN I can import the skill plan. Sometimes, particularly for new characters, this skill plan is only a week-long skill plan.
---
I'd just run Audacity and record it.
---
Oops yeha that's right.. I am good at the game ok?
---
it either did very recently or it's in the pipe for the next release... I read it in a dev post recently.
---
Sorry.
---
dead meme for a dead horse
---
But can you dodge a blue donut?
---
I think the lack of willingness of small gangs to engage with anything other than kitey ships is because the ships/capsule they use are so expensive (usually 1-2bil+) that flying something that can't easily disengage means you're guaranteed to die when fighting outnumbered.
---
No money for staff... proceeds to spend shitloads of money on Useless CSM morons
---
DO YOU NOT HAVE A PHONE!!! Get in with the times man. They are throwing all their chips towards the mobile mmo. Worked so well with Blizz/activ. with Diablo abandoning pc for phone.
---
It only takes like 5mill SP to max out skills for a T1 frigate. Beyond that the remaining 115 million make no difference.
---
WORMHOLE MAN BAD
---
Same reason people hunt in bombers.  Less risk, less isk lost. Less chance of loss for return
---
It isn’t rocket science to see people don’t play eve to feed as hard as possible to the egos of people who are far more risk averse
---
Haven't you been reading r/eve? The games been dead for over a decade
---
CCP, you ignorant slut.
---
Hm, this is actually fair. CCP must be moving to Brisbane!
---
There is no summer in Iceland, baited on a season lel
---
Sure, but it's a weird emphasis. Subcap logi is a burp of a problem next to the hurricane that are FAUX in subcap fleets. Focusing on subcap logi now is kind of like running into a burning building to blow out a candle you left burning.
---
If an eve employee is fired in Iceland and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? 
---
Wait...
---
If an eve dev makes a change to Eve and no one is playing anymore, does the change really take place?
---
PS. Shield slaves now please ..... Mmkay thanks
---
.... cries about too much change... cries about not enough change.... cries about stagnation.... cries about chaos... now stainguy is crying because why now? lack of chaos... yeap. lack of known chaos roadmap... check. Look. you can't have your cake, and eat it, while somersaulting, while skydiving, while reading the color coded correlated version, from the safety of your bed. seems mad yeah? welcome to /r/eve :)
---
I don't think you get it, some people don't want to do that. Yes, they just want to sit there and mine. Yes they just want to krab, that way they can afford to pvp. Yes they are those 'subhuman' krabs. I understand what your saying, but when you go around in local calling everyone shit, you don't exactly explain them how cool manual piloting can be.
---
over 75% of the convos I had in local with wormholers go the following or something similar
---
Wormholer 1 &gt; Get fuck
---
Wormholer 1 &gt; Fucking blue donut blobbers
---
Wormholer 2 &gt; Undock and fight me
---
Wormholer 3&gt; Caps are gay
---
When you chat to random people like this, why do you expect that most null seccers don't like you? This was especially something that happened when ever I came across Chessurs gang when he was still around. Very RARELY did I come across a positive chat experience with wormholers. In the end I have to shit talk as well because you toxic shitlords don't know how to properly communicate with people. 
---
Start with being more communicable then MAYBE, people will start thinking about manual piloting. You've never been a null corp before. Otherwise you'd know that there are A LOT of sean mcleans out there.
---
&gt;Dunk Dinkle raises a concern about being outgunned when defending and that this would remove one of their force multipliers. With this change, he believes that he would take fewer fights whereas ExookiZ and Aryth believe they will take more fights. Vily does point out that this may result in nano-crappery coming back. Aryth asks Dunk Dinkle if he would engage 20 Sleipnirs in 20 Thoraxes, he would come out ISK positive by just killing three of them. Dunk Dinkle doesn't want that, He wants the hostiles to get the hell out of his system. There seems to be a very unhealthy state enabled by the logistics to go into a fight and lose nothing and  destroy everything. Aryth points out that Dunk Dinkle can zerg but he says he can't.
---
Context makes you look worse.
---
Chrome tried to take away my adblockers. Never again.
---
cos gankbears are pussies
---
Part of enjoying the game was to create a silly fit, learn it is bad, and improve it.
---
At this journey you would connect with community and develop bonds to the gane.
---
If we have all fits ready for newcomers... this might take something from the process.
---
What you think?
---
They weren't all bots, either. [One got banned by pretty shitty circumstances by CCP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c18ffs/skill_urself_20170412_20190616/erbzb4d/)
---
Calling it a botting event seems kinda silly.
---
Get a ship that can actually crab. Passive Drake, or really, most of the fits here:

---
5 mil is probably too low, there are some pretty expensive skills behind a maxed out frig pilot. Guided missile precision is one mil by itself, so is acceleration control, weapon soec V, etc.
---
"useful" is a subjective term tho. In their case I'm afraid "usefulness" is determined by how well the data supported the result they wanted to so, and they made every effort to make sure the data did that. (And failed, I suspect.) Including things like attempting to skew the data in that direction by contaminating the experiment.
---
I'm kinda interested in this game, is there anything I should know before getting invested? Like will I be able to keep up if I only spend a couple hours a week in this game?  How viable would it be to not be a PvP player/be a manufacturer or mining sort of person?
---
Id love to hear a couple of examples of when wormholers have "bent the ear" of CCP.
---
CCP did not think about cyno jammers problem before CSM meeting.
---
Cynojammerbtw
---
The logistics of getting implants to far flung alts already sucks, but luckily it is not an oft-repeated process.  I'd hate to think about having to routinely take "attribute accelerators" to those same far-flung alts. 
---
CCP does seem to like make living in space more tedious recently, however, so it fits their current game design.
---
Snuffed Out
---
Delete C4 btw
---
very true. if folks created ANY kind of content in game (example, lowsec mining those sweet mins in a venture and dieing in a fire, or making much more than highsec) rather than complaining that CCP isn't doing exactly what they would do.. we wouldn't be in this mess either. CCP could improve for sure, but most of the complaining (as usual) in this sub sets up lose-lose scenarios so the /r/eve raging neckbeards feel vindicated. god know how many of these folks even play the game anymore.
---

Strong energy from RR, in particular SWF. here, a group which repeatedly violates blue standings and is well known botters in their own right (Gemini Whale United was started by them, and their Corp offshoots have been the worst botters by far in northern nullsec)
---
His fit looks more like a buffer fit than a passive shield regen fit. If he wanted a passive shield regen, he'd need to also replace some damage mods with shield power relays too.
---
Last paragraph summs it all. And it is how we fight in wh space too. Very often we roll in to the hole of an established wh corp and if they see us in frigs they undock frigs if they see us in BS they undock BS.Resulting fight usually ends with compliments and good wishes.WHers want a quality fight and some explosions whereas null seccers just want to blob.

More than that they announced them renamed them in game and moved them to a different lp store and loot table.

Dunk Dinkle brings up the Primae at the start of the Ship balancing discussion
---
3 pages later
---
CCP Rise confirms that he heard about a request to rebalance the Primae.
---
Glad to see CCP thinking about the important things 👍
---
&gt;Time is an issue here.
---
A small simple tweak such as removing the time limit on respecing could be done without causing a major disruption to other things.
---
I think they should be 1,000km off a citadel. The fact that they are within Keepstar Doomsday range kills any kind of content that you can get by camping them and waiting for the enemy to form, since you lose your most expensive ship to an unmitigatable 5mil damage nuke + point (within 300km) as soon as a gunner is awake, and it requires stupid doctrines to reinforce them like /u/ronUSMC having to use 260km+ Rokhs to engage an Ansiblex outside of Keepstar effective ranges while the enemy brings nothing to fight with except the citadel. 
---
We need tools and tactics to be able to provoke a fight. Sitting on a staging/high usage ansiblex would be a good way to do that, brings back the old outpost camping/sitting on the staging undock for a fight. We also don't want to force people into coward sniping doctrines instead of good fight brawling stuff.
---
It still provides a fortified position, you can still send fighters over and have an invulnerability ping and easy way to extract from a fight if it goes badly for the defenders. 
---
We need to make people need to use ships instead of citadels to defend them.
---
Dr. Pepper Pulled Pork is sexy in your mouth. Satire or no, HOW FUCKING DARE YOU!? :P
---
But players have reduced the risk of living in null by using Intel bots and programs.
---
So ccp has to rebalance to make the game worth playing again.
---
Also, Coke and DP  are two different things.

How do you spot a wormholer?

They'll tell you they're a wormholer.

Olmecca joins goons on Feb 29, 2020. It is written.
---
I'm sorry if it wasn't clear, I completely agree with you
---
"Do you know who I am?"
---
No.  Taking an unwinnable fight for the sake of being "ISK positive" is just stupid.  It's being farmed.
---
And... What? Because of that one guy who flamed you, you're attacking all wormholers as some sort of vindictiveness?
---
Which one(s) were your biggest surprise?
---
He's completely wrong though. Most PVE is pretty safe and has a pretty good reward. Only the initial levels of PVE have very bad rewards (T1 abyssals, level 1 missions, C1 sites). You can run C2-C3 with a passive Drake for 100mil+/hr, T3 abyssals with a 50-100m fit for about the same income, nullsec ratting with a cheap T1 ship for 60m isk/hr (all with low chances of dying). Even running Level 3 and Level 4 missions can net you 60m isk/hr with a good ship.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
---
*am i doing this right?
---
Just a vegan?  I’m a level 5 vegan. I won’t eat anything that casts a shadow.
---
Yes, that's exactly how it works.
---
can't see why not honestly
---
Wormholer here. I haven't noticed any shitting on wormholers... But I also don't really care about nothing and moaning nullbears, so I may have skipped some of their comments and threads. Eli5?
---
I think 5-7mil SP is where you max out on easy gains. You can be about 90% as effective as a maxed Veteran at around that SP bracket if you train one faction and one weapon system. The remaining 10mil SP or so to be 'true' maxed (MWD cap skills/weapon spec V/Warhead Upgrades V/Utility Sensor Skills/Rigging skills etc.) only gets you the extra 10%.
---
Very touchy subject for you... :honk:
---
&gt;holier than thou attitude
---
&gt;most folks look down on them
---
Are you sure it's the *wormholers* with that attitude, my dude?
---
I demolish 7 year old Hecates and faction fit Garmurs on 2 million SP Kestrel Alpha accounts too.
---
The HIC changes spring to mind.
---
&gt;Dunk Dinkle can zerg but he says he can't.
---
This is the internet after all.
---
&gt;But quite often when people do this, the nano ships run away.
---
"FC, what is Sabre?"
---
Lol this is impressive nonsense even by your exalted standards.
---
Yep, it's really sad because one of the first iterations was actually quite good...it was just incredibly jarring because it was so short and ended dumping people into the old old shit with no direction.  Instead of working on the jarring shift/shitty later content, they just scrapped and remade it worse 10 times.  Great job, CCP.
---
as an independent capsuleer i'm of the opinion that all nullsec linemembers should suck on wormholer dicks and pay no less than 30% of their income for it
---
sorry what was the question again
---
Impressive projection here my dude, given that you are a nullblobber and the nullblobs just cried so hard they got CCP to revert a change because they couldn't accept any risk to their undisturbed isk printing.
---
They arent hard to implement, but they would just be fucking broken.
---
I mean it is. I'm not arguing that its not.
---
Are you seriously claiming that the statement the ‘last couple of years null sec has become very safe’ is not true given citadels / super umbrellas / skill injectors?
---
Null became one of the safest most rewarding areas of the game.
---
See you get it.
---
Since 2003, actually.
---
Change Cybernetics skill to give +1 to attributes per rank. Remove attributes from all implants, remove training implants from game. Combat implants can be the LP sink in place of training implants.
---
You got flair baited. just accept that you are an emotional kneejerker and move on.
---
r/eve in a nutshell
---
Literally you guys did this for years, taking outgunned fights with a swarm mentality and fucking up veteran players with the newbro swarm, now you’re worried about my guys dying and not ratting/mining to expand the coffers.
---
What happened to y’all, it’s always been go to GE- for fun fights now it’s go to horde space cause Brave is mini test and drop carriers instead of supers on fleets.
---
This is really something that bothers me. it shows CCP aptitude to keep a schedule or a plan. ZERO !!!!
---
Not trying to even be remotely edgy, offensive, or dickish. Your reply seems to indicate that you believe I am. Just want a discussion not an argument which I know r/eve may not be the place for. I won’t belabor the point further. But in short:
---
1) want to mine/rat in peace go to high sec 
---
2) trash talking is usually just a tactic to get a response (undocked) much like pointing and holding a procurer without killing it. I’m sure there is plenty of edgelords out there, but generally speaking, I’ve had quite the opposite experience. Sorry yours is so negative 
---
3) I’ve been in Dreddit and Therapy. in TEST, and Lethal Injection when they were still in TRI. I usually went after WHers when they came to my space in something small and fast and got a few frags here and there. Got my rorqual bubbled by Odin’s Call while in TEST once and soon after joined them because I was impressed by the size of the balls it took to try what they did in the heart of Eso. 
---
4) I’m not nor have I claimed to be. Nano gang is fun but that doesn’t mean it’s all that is nor does it mean it’s for every last pilot. I think most would greatly enjoy it and find it’s greatly superior to titans online if they tried it though.
---
If this is the case, what in the ACTUAL fuck are they being paid for right now?
---
&gt;Most people's experience with wormhole groups is the 3/4 C2/NS groups, they mostly do ganking because there isn't all that much small gang pvp left in nullsec and they can't escalate so people get killed and start complaining.
---
Yeah. Pretty much this. Additionally there are a few dudes here on reddit who talk a lot of trash.  
---
There are also the high class groups which mostly stick to themselves. But from nullsec perspective they are as much blue donut as null. Sure they shoot each other (INIT and TEST do that too) but they don't truly go after each other. They are less likely to be grr nullsec in my perception.  
---
And there is also the general low class population which are pretty normal dudes and dudettes I guess. Just doing their thing. Some PvE, some PvP. I think I'm degressing here...
---
&gt;Outside of that it's because wormhole space in the eye's of many shouldn't work, it has all the mechanics that nullsec claims case stagnation but somehow it's alive and doing relatively well.
---
Honestly, as far as I can see, wormhole meta is currently leshaks in space. If you have some other insight there I'm happy to learn more.
---
They’ve given normal players Polaris frigates and shit like that before not too out of the question
---
Dr Pepper isn't a cola
---
If CCP actually has to ask these questions, it's more hopeless than I even thought.  Where the fuck have they been for years?
---
It's actually the other way around. Roamers (not just wormholers, but wormholers in null are by definition roaming) have to fly nano because you have to be able to burn away from toxic cyno gate camps.
---
I'm sorry but nothing compares to a pint of Old Legthumper or 0.600475 of a quart of Beard Bender
---
&gt; The strange thing I find about worm holers is that you insist that people fight. What if they don't want to? Or can't?
---
Everyone can fight. Not necessarily win, sure, but anyone can put together a small gang of T1 ships and take a fight.
---
This is CCRetards.  Half of them probably were innocent, just eating a bullet for PR.  Look at how hard it was to get them to re-open the Brisc case, and then think about how many innocent nobodies have likely been fucked by CCP's god complex with zero recourse.
---
Because they are the last bastion of pvp left in eve and they can't be dealt with by blobbing aka the only thing null has.
---
&gt; This was especially something that happened when ever I came across Chessurs gang when he was still around
---
Chessur isn't even a wormholer, is he?
---
I actually really liked having the margin trading skill when I started trying to play Market PvP with limited liquidity. I found that I could target several low volume items at once with larger buy orders for when people would dump multiples at once, and quickly cycle them into sell orders to keep my profits going. It’s a very useful skill for traders that were like me.
---
(We'd quite like to see margin trading go away)
---
Good thing I didn't go with my spag bol recipe. You'd probably burn your PC. 😁
---
In that case, remove cooldown on remap?
---
Ah I see.  That's true, yes.
---
&gt; Clearly not everyone understands what I'm saying so I'll try again .
---
Good. Try again next month.
---
Isn't it also a bunch of newbies learning to fight in literally disposable ships? 
---
On the other hand you're teaching them the current meta quite well. Don't get better, bring caps and FAX instead 👌
---
I can't stand when someone who used to be in wormhole corp starts every sentence with " back when i lived in wormholes".
---
Cmon now be fair. It's also Drekavacs in space.
---
It was _really_ obvious what people actually meant here.
---
Orly? TIL. Dr Pepper isn't really a big thing in Australia. I've had it but didn't realise there was a distinction. To me it tastes like Coke cut with cough syrup.
---
https://youtu.be/czEMdSWodI0
---
Lol can CCP not literally type in Supercarrier bot in YouTube and see the fully functioning supercarrier/rorq bot and soon to be implemented titan  boson support soon. 
---
Fun fact: discord of this bot was closed  for “maitnence”when blackout was on. Really makes you :think:
---
was very interesting toying around with the at tool a year ago thats for sure. sadly, with every patch something breaks and after logibro was gone no one took over (hope the guy that was supposed to do so isnt fired too lol). we still have duality to do stuff on, so we can do some fancy tourneys there but then again the whole tool is broken for a good while now (at least most of the stuff that was used to make the at happen)... time for a rework. never gonna happen, i know. one can dream...
---
Well, one of them is me. And one of them is Dunk.
---
Killing some expensive (Sleips, Ikis, whatever) in some cheap (Caracals, whatever) is great and feels good, even if you don't hold grid. You can't hold grid on every fight, but you can pick an immediately achievable goal and have a hell of a lot more fun FIGHTING than docking and hoping they go away.
---
TISHU! ALL HAIL THE REICH!
---
How can you be being farmed if you are isk positive?
---
I live in Texas, so maybe it's different with the HFCS vs sugar stuff, but usually regular coke has a more... distinct flavor than DP.
---
Well now we know for sure where CCP gets their "80% of players are in high sec" bullshit, at least.
---
I take it you don't gank then.  You know, being committed to fair fights and all.
---
Advocate for 24-hour cooldown on respecs  as a bandaid fix.
---
That's not really half arsed, it is about 90% of the arse, for about 5% of the effort, and it doesn't stop you from doing the high effort version later.
---
They said summer, never summer 2019. So summer 2029.
---
You have to admit, there are a fair number of loud assholes who are eve players.
---
My wife makes a pulled pork that is banned in 6 countries because it the flavor leads to rapid weight gain. We're actually having some this week.
---
The more alarming part is that people are actually still surprised that CCP devs/mouthpieces have no issue lying to the community when they think its what people want to hear.
---
Structures should only be able to shoot BACK.
---
Was this in the talk about the diversity of play styles?
---
You wont, drones dont reassign to diffrent rocks.
---
Yes, and this is true for all FLEX structures. Being able to deploy them under the guns of a citadel is retarded. I know jump bridges were attached to a POS, but taking a fight on a hostile POS was a completely different kettle of fish to a hostile citadel (particularly a Keepstar).
---
At this point I'm fully convinced that EVE only exists still for the sole reason that most of this community is retarded and takes CCP on their word no matter how many times they're flat out lied to.
---
Pretty sure the other guy isn't a good.
---
God no, the implants are the worst part of it and even with citadels is a driver for people to NOT undock for fear of losing expensive implants.
---
&gt; nor is logging in for 30 seconds to update a skill queue and logging out again
---
Hey, that's me! Well it's usually to eat an accelerator and stare at the undock button for 15 seconds before I realize I have better things to do. But close enough.
---
surprise level 1/10
---
disappointment level 12/10 though
---
Can confirm dreks is where it’s at
---
Being totally honest here, ganks are more of a means to an end for me personally, at least in null. I roam solo or with a very small gang most of the time now days and a lot of times, I’ll point something I know I can’t kill just to get another small gang to respond to the ratter or miner being pointed. 
---
Your comments imply ganks are somehow an unfair fight for the person being ganked. In nullsec at least, the contrary is quite true. If you’re bad enough or afk enough to get pointed with local and intel at your disposal (which very heavily favors the ratter) you still have every chance of escaping if you have even a handful of friends around to come defend you. That’s not a fair fight, but many aren’t in Eve so I’m not complaining.
---
It's covered under Texas law.
---
AT was shit.
---
My proclivities are hardly a concern here; however, the preferences of my partner are important to me.
---
Duration is unlimited. 
---
Probably. Someone with a bunch of high rank skills at level 4 should toss them all in and see how far out it stretches.
---
I mean, there hasn't been meaningful development in years so  there comes a point when "it takes time bro!" isn't a valid argument.
---
Classic non-iteration ccp.
---
Let's not try to tweak it, let's totally go way overboard so everyone will hate it causing us to do nothing or to do it and then undo it.
---
oh for sure, but the guy didn't accuse me of building a real estate empire on hacking accounts and selling isk as part of a well rounded multi-game RMT portfolio, he accused me of building it off the back of his 10 nyx bot farm.
---
Well, they have been running multiple events this year. It's not exactly simple, you know.
---
The new code from these devs is worse than the legacy code
---
I find DP helps soften up a tougher or leaner pork.  But if it is a fatty pork shoulder then DP is not necessary.
---
It's definitely different everywhere, but I doubt it makes fuckall difference for pulled pork.
---
Giving players like Rhiload a GM ship on a limited account on a testing server to make a promo video isn't the same thing as giving players an actual GM account on Tranquility.
---
Thanks for going, to all of you guys. It's appreciated.
---
Not, at least, until after FAX get hit with the nerf hammer, since they're a massive problem.
---
Subcap logi is pretty bad for fights though. If you are outclassed but if you take the fight you might kill 5 ships and lose 20, some people will take that fight for fun. But if the enemy has 3 Guardians then you can guarantee you will kill 0 ships and that is never going to be fun. Logi is bad for fights.
---
And at a larger scale it's bad for weapon balance because you have to have alpha-heavy doctrines to kill anything.
---
B-but all of the reddit and CCP nerds assured me that they could filter out all of these other changes and see ONLY the data they wanted!  They have the metrics!  Surely this was true?!
---
What do you think the CSM is?
---
Eve Economy Session.
---
&gt; You have to admit, there are a fair number of loud assholes who are eve players.
---
oh i agree.  even though the Office Space comparison is kinda funny, they really do need someone who can liaison between the players and the devs.  I don't necessarily blame the devs because i don't think they are getting the right information.
---
you were clear.  it is kinda funny that that job position is actually incredibly important in some fields, e.g. sitting between game devs and the fan bases these days.
---
Jokes on you, summer *never* comes to Iceland.
---
There's nothing wrong with margin trading when you can cover the orders, but orders that violate that should get taken down immediately (or at least on a high frequency periodic check, like 5 minutes or less), not only when someone tries to sell them. Margin trading scams are dumb because there's nothing the victim can do to check whether a buy order is legit or not.
---
You aren't banting with the correct crowd then.
---
I've been sick and on meds and generally off lately, but I'm genuinely uncertain what that was supposed to mean, so... what's the obvious meaning for my busted brain? :p
---
I never drank Dr Pepper but Coke goes well with all "heavy" or spicy food
---
Pick a big one, say "diggy diggy" and fuck off for a few hrs
---
A lot of this sound like "we want safer nullsec" =(
---
Seriously, dont Listen to other players. You can have fun completely lost in the game, playing several hours a day and make "fast" (From a week pov) or you play it like you said and enjoy it that way.
---
Pve is nearly the only way to make isk. Pvp is not giving you much, if you dont know how to do it properly. Mining and manufactoring is totally fine! Both can make fun, if you enjoy what you do and you can simply go off to other activities
---
When 1 skill takes 506 days... You know its a Capital V skill.
---
Coca-Cola (coke) is a different brand/flavor than Dr. Pepper... Unless you're in the south and they call all sodas coke (Sprite coke, Pepsi coke, grape coke, coke coke). The south is a magical place.
---
How do we know that?
---
I here I was anxiously awaiting the next sophisticated scheme of awards distribution which results in one guy making away with hundreds of billions worth of at ships while the other participants walk away with promises without hope of ever seeing a penny.
---
Good riddance
---
Because most of the people in this subreddit are NullBloc line members who have never been anything else and the only thing that they know about other parts of the game is the propaganda which gets shot from Mittani's dick straight into their mouths.
---
That would help the problem of making long term mistakes early on but if it's going to be touched at all I think it's worth the extra effort.
---
I think a more complete solution could be done without too much more work. Just set everyone's attributes to be the same, hide them, remove respects, remove learning implants, replace learning implants in LP stores with cerebral accelerators that don't get lost when pod-killed. In the future then there is more room to slowly add new stat-based implant sets.
---
It's my fault for not specifying it, but not all wormholers do that. Trash talk is nice and all, but if you don't follow up on it, that's all people will see from you. Some time ago came a cross a group that was trash talking. Later on one of them mailed me saying that is was all trash talk and not to take it serious. I never too it serious, but that is the first impression they gave and was happy that they clarified that it was just banter. 
---
1) People can mine and krab WHERE ever they want. I'm not sure why you're the decision maker for that. The efficiency of it is a different story.
---
2) Trash talking is nice, follow up on it though. You can make friends like that. First impressions are important.
---
3) Surprised to see you didn't come across any sean mcleans in test.
---
4) You say that, but here you are telling people where they have to be to do something in a sandbox. People will do what they want, you are not the curator of eve.
---
I said his gang, a lot of them were worm holers.
---
Villy happened to them. Blue up, Krab up.
---
You’re an idiot if you believe any of the vitriol you just spewed into your keyboard
---
No offense
---
Yeah, it's mostly just there to be sugar.
---
They will fold into FRT. Owait
---
On top of not playing/understanding the game at all, this leaves them in quite the pickle.  It's surprising the game is still even online with these yahoos in charge.
---
Giving someone a supervised joy ride isn’t nearly the same thing as giving access to GM controls. 
---
The only places players have access to any of those tools is on test servers. Stuff like /moveme and sov index boosts
---
No they gave someone a QA Spectator boat that got killed by a keepstar
---
Coke has chocolate in it, and can digest an iron nail in two days. 
---
Dr. Pepper has prune juice, slightly less sugar/corn syrup, and had a thicker consistency. 
---
Heathens.
---
A full base of core armor, engineering, shield, navigation and targeting skills (with all armor, shield and targeting compensations and rigs to 4 and AWU to 5) is close to 30 mil SP.
---
If I've learned anything about CCP, if they refuse to give details, its probably because they don't have a fucking clue and are just trying to make the players feel better.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/63711228
---
~~It's just the dev's teenage nephew actually.~~ Never mind that would be fine.
---
There are two different carrier Vs in that que, but mostly it's just wrapping up BC V or BS V in each race that I don't have and a few other similar items that I never did on my main.
---
You are wrong. You are wrong because I come back to games that I left because the devs made some kind of retarded decision. I come back if I see the devs have made a decision I approve of that will make the game better.
---
Example 1. Planetside 2 - The devs make awful decisions dating back to SOE and Daybreak Games inherited the stupidity if you will,  but there is no game like this MMOFPS. They nerfed my sunderer playstyle, I left, they added some cool new things over the years such as weapons and good shit like that so I came back briefly. They still haven't released Oshur and they spent Planetside 2 money developing a BR clone called Planetside Arena which will fail as well as other pointless things like the dumb death cam. 
---
Example 2. EVE Online - CCP continues to cater to the lowest common denominator a do not realise that without long-term players then their new players will drift away more easily and has largely forgotten that eve is a pvp game. They have forgotten the HTFU mantra which is one reason they abandoned BlackOut so quickly and seem to rely solely on statistics to do their thinking for them. They are continually incapable of learning from their mistakes but I dare say they are not the only devs to do this but when you rely on one product because you cannot competently make new ones this is pretty much a death sentence. 
---
But I came back despite the war dec nerfs \[not that I war-decced that much anyway but its the principle\] because they added things like assault frigate rework and BlackOut because they change the game in meaningful ways. They certainly do not interact with eve players like they used to do way back and while I understand there are more sperg-mongers these days they could be more attentive. CCP are chasing unicorns, the magic demographic that doesn't exist.
---
K - A - R - M - A and karma was his name-o
---
I'm sure "crappery" is a euphemism for a much less classy epithet that somehow people still like to use in yool 2019 :sun:
---
Wait hol up, they discontinued the alliance tournament?
---
That's dangerous advice for abyssals... If you can't clear the site in under 20 minutes... Well then your tank really doesn't matter.
---
I mean, blind faith when all evidence points to the contrary is...well...not generally a good way to approach things.
---
Human nature is to blame other for you're own flaws that you are too blind to see.
---
Wormholer btw
---
Try Brave
---
His flair says he is.  You aren't insinuating people would go on the internet and lie, are you?  Preposterous.
---
He claims the reward has done nothing but increase in the past 2 years. I am saying the reward has not increased and in fact most money making has been nerfed in the past 2 years.
---
Sounds good.
---
So in one session you;re talking about how diversifying play styles is good and in another you propose to remove playstyles?
---
Makes little sense to me or maybe i misunderstood the first part
---
True, we used to have much larger numbers where using the inferior ship/doctrine could be used in mass.  But currently, we don't have those numbers.  Being outnumbered and outgunned is a different situation than the past. That's my point about force multipliers making a difference.
---
Yay finally a decent reason.. someone understood what I was getting at. I was talking to push about it trying to figure out why they are soo... Hostile towards public structures. You can't tell there is a can in it before you accept it which locks you into the collateral.
---
I didn't think of the nesting issue.. this can probably be better solved than no you can't use them like that but it's at least a reason so thank you.
---
&gt; God no, the learning implants are the worst part of it and even with citadels is a driver for people to NOT undock for fear of losing expensive implants, else they gimp their training speeds.
---
This.
---
The issue is that a single logi reps more damage than multiple similar sized ships can put out, and they do it from longer range and without application issues.
---
Being ISK positive has nothing to do with being farmed.
---
Will try this. Thank you.
---
Damn.  Wasn't SM3LL the last remaining original NCdot corporation?
---
\&gt;is gm ship  
---
\&gt;doesn't tank keepstar doomsday  
---
\&gt;smh
---
I think most people will disagree with you here. Just because you lose the objective, lose ships or do not hold the field doesn't mean you were 'farmed', quite the opposite infact. 
---
[The most fun I've had in the past year or so involved a corp that flew mostly low-SP 4mil ISK fit thrashers in FW](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7onk9g/go_out_there_and_make_your_own_content_eve_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and just throwing them into absolutely everything that came our way, sure we'd gift tons of kills but we also made Dal the most dangerous system in eve for over a week, easily surpassing tama and on one day it had [almost 1,000 kills](https://i.imgur.com/uUtioaf.png). We netted several bling Garmurs/Kiters, 1.7b Lokis, 2b Phantasms and with the help of our mains, and mostly u/tikktokk smartbombing, killed over 80b worth of implant sets in a month in a single system. All reimbursed by the loot we recieved to be turned into more 4 million ISK Thrashers.
---
Learning to take bad fight isn't good.
---
And we aren't teaching them your strawman argument about dropping caps, but run with it, you might get upvotes.
---
&gt; I'd hate to think about having to routinely take "attribute accelerators" to those same far-flung alts.
---
Allow them to be remote activated like skill extractors, SKINs, etc.
---
The only way is not to cater to one demographic over the other. You can only be true to one and if the other if sacrificed on the alter to appease the gods of the other, then that is what has to happen. CCP deny the human nature of tribalism.
---
Come join BUMS. so you can SM3LL the dumpster.
---
Wrecks last for two hours. Get a small cheap ship and a mobile tractor unit. When you land, immediately deploy the MTU. Come back the next day.
---
Everyone has somewhat conventional doctrines. But counter play is very much alive and well.
---
2 things, one whelping endlessly isn't fun. When every single time you undock you unequivocally whelp the entire fleet people lose interest. 
---
And 2, dunk i love ya you are a great guy but he doesn't represent the interests of those who live in catch. He represents Impass, where they capital rat, mine and drop capitals on roaming nano gangs. None of the brave leadership give a single solitary fuck about what goes on in catch, or are probably even aware of what's going on unless someone comes to them begging them to do something about it. 
---
People will still likely form up in GE and fight you. But when they never win and whelp every time people get discouraged. There's a bump in participation when wins happen and a drop off in participation after long strings of losses. You can't form a swarm to try and fight an outgunned fleet if everyone is so demoralized from the 10 previous whelp fleets that they just log off.
---
Dude I basically just did it's broken for both sides. And how is the map perfect Intel? Isn't it delayed by an hour or something? 
---
Even if it's not And on noes.... They know I'm activeee ohhhh reeeeee I cant undock into perfect saftey from 10 jumps away..I'm no longer safer reeeee... Is how you sound..
---
If they can increase the risk for our pve with simple changes like this they can increase the payouts we get. Why is every pver so hostile to any change to it. Like wow grow a pair it's not like you can't see them coming 5 systems away.
---
Nerds want asset safety for loot to drop but dont want asset safety when it comes to their own shit.
---
Matias wept
---
Pfft. Snowflakes.
---
Remove attributes, give constat Skill Points per tick rate
---
ALL (and i mean ALL) learning implants that have any kind +N to attribute value are changed to accelerators, BUT they expire (pirate implants loose their +n value below, keep reading).
---
Accelerators then are classified in effect / duration:
---
* High SP per tick, long time (requires high skill in Cibernetics)
---
* Low SP per tick, short time (requires low skill in Cibernetics)
---
* High SP , short time (avrg skill in Cibenertics)
---
All Implants that boosted learning attributes are rechristhened Cerebral Accelerators,
---
All expired Accelerators can then be adjusted to the new system and become relevant again.
---
Pirate/Faction Implant sets no longer give +N to attribute, they only give ship bonuses and are renamed "Capsule enhancers"
---
All hardwirings implants are renamed "Capsule Enhancers".
---
Accelerators and Enhancers are lost if podded.
---
NO MORE REMAPS, NO MORE ATTRIBUTES
---
You don't need all of that though. You don't need any Compensation skills in a Kestrel, You don't need repair systems, drones, capacitor skills, high fitting skills. Hull Upgrades/Mechanics are fine at IV as they give you marginal EHP increases, you don't need great sensor skills, you don't need all the navigation skills, Nav V is nice, Evasive Manuvering IV is fine as is Accel Control IV. Also you only need to train relevent skills, for example, if you are playing on a shield frigate you don't need armor compensation skills/any other rigging skills other than shield/launching rigging.
---
When you guys began the turtle up strat you fucked up. Test already had that and ultimately you made it a situation to have people to just sit there and choose where they would rather make isk. 
---
You guys needed to be a niche thing to survive this, what does horde do? They fight more than anything and through fighting they make isk for new folks. They don’t sit there and try to become something they are not like y’all are doing.
---
I get what you’re saying, but this mass exodus you had of people leaving to Test is on you for thinking Brave could turtle up and make isk and be okay with Test doing the same thing but 100xs better. 
---
You should have stayed true to your nature and provided content that literally gets delivered to your door steps everyday that woulda made you survive and thrive. But what do I know bro.
---
&gt; I think they should be 1,000km off a citadel. The fact that they are within Keepstar Doomsday range kills any kind of content that you can get by camping them and waiting for the enemy to form, since you lose your most expensive ship to an unmitigatable 5mil damage nuke + point (within 300km) as soon as a gunner is awake
---
Matias was about having fun.  About not caring about being "ISK positive".
---
My corp has around 10 people going to Eve London this November. We have rented a big house for us all to share over the weekend so should be a riot!
---
It's socially acceptable because it's punching up.
---
the game is dead anyway, with half of the map being occupied by goons and friends and the other with bots. With all the safety and citadel spam. From me CCP can shut down TQ it isnt fun anyways. Saying that as someone who played since 2008 and owns 6 accounts accumulating around 1260m SP in total.
---
I don't consider taking out a couple Sleipnirs with 20 disposable T1 cruisers a bad fight. But it's all in your attitude I guess.
---
If you were talking about bringing subcap logi then I apologize. Based on the context it really seems like you're talking about FAX.
---
Module Tiericide anyone?
---
People tend to criticize stuff they don't understand. Especially if they consider the grass could be greener.
---
I mean the naive optimist in me likes to think it's a body of popular players trying to advocate a better game the cynical pessimist thinks a body designed to advocate game changes that helps particular in game entities.
---
Can you actually list them? I wanna look them up but I'm at work.
---
We fight everyday.  
---
We lost a lot of people and regions because we couldn't counter caps &amp; supers. You don't hold space without them. OF course we want to build our strength in this regard.  
---
Somehow you want the clock turned back to 2014 to a situation that was bad for people as the solution?
---
Good enough
---
The key with combat sites is quantity. Find as many as you can wherever you are and knock em out. Look for the named rats that spawn and loot em (use eve wiki and google the site name, look for the loot container in the list and loot that one.) if you get an escalation, set destination to that and do everything on the way too.
---
Never said you shouldn’t have built supers and caps but revolving around specifically that and only that ala Goons/TAPI isn’t what you guys specialize in
---
You don't really need shield comps if you don't use passive shield hardeners. Rig skills are also very minor.
---
The context was "if there were no logi" would you take a fight against an equal number of far superior ships (slep vs. thorax).  I said no, it's an unwinnable fight and being "ISK positive" is worthless.
---
Logi are a force multipler that would let the Thoraxes take the fight.  That was my point, but /r/eve is not a place for subtle points.
---
What happened in DEC 2016 that made the huge spike?
---
They turned their back to living in our loving known space for their 1%'er  private enclaves so all wh exits/entrances should be despawned immediately and all the WH'ers should just float together in their private hell forevermore.
---
Make it so CCP.
---
That's not really clarifying.  Is the implication that "do it" is, what, voluntarily turn off asset safety on your own shit while everyone else has the option to leave it on?  Or that the people who's hands were up weren't in null?  idgi, and I'm not willfully being dense here.
---
CCP Fozzie asks CSM: who wants to have asset safety removed in nullsec
---
&gt;hands
---
Who of you would do it (do what?) for the betterment of the game?
---
so this basically confirms AT is kill, ok cool thanks.
---
&gt; Your comments imply ganks are somehow an unfair fight for the person being ganked.
---
In Eve?  It's the definition of a gank.  You don't call a fight "fair" because someone can avoid it, you call it "fair" because there is a reasonable possibility for either player to win assuming similar skill levels.
---
&gt; That’s not a fair fight, but many aren’t in Eve so I’m not complaining.
---
You are.  That's all you've done in this thread.
---
Your posts above are complaining about people forming fleets or dropping caps as a response to gankers and telling people they should respond by fighting you with the ships you want to fight, but now you turn around and say "it's fair to be outnumbered against ships built for killing you."  All I'm saying is you're a hypocrite for complaining about people doing to you what you do when you gank: engage in a fight you know you can't lose.
---
The rewards couldn't have been made high enough without truly ruining the game.  
---
For example, If I'm going to risk a ship worth 1b, I want a reasonable certainty that I will keep it long enough to pay for itself and make a reasonable amount of money. 
---
Since the lack of local means that a hostile could be in system without my knowing, I would need to be making ~100 mil PER SECOND for the risk / reward to feel fair.
---
Alternatively, ccp could add ways to control your space, (cloaky probes, gate jammers, covert cyno jammers etc,) before removing literally the only way to know if there are reds in system.
---
the absence of local works well in wormholes BECAUSE you can close the gates and you won't get dropped on. Taking away local in null without also adding ways to control access to a system was doomed from the start.
---
You should be punished by losing your shit due to actions in-game, not out of game.
---
Not going to lie, I see a shocking amount of "we don't have the data for that" or "we are only now just stating to collect that data" for a 15 year old game. You would like that alot of this would have been asked before.
---
being isk positive is not really a good measure of fun and or winning.   Especially if your doing home defense.
---
In the live broadcast from eve Berlin was a few minutes before they said they were removing blackout
---
Well then Cybernetics V is mandatory before you train anything just like learning skills. Don't do that.
---
Yup seen them before in the wild. They can also mess up the time for contract to be completed. Saw a goon courier contract that had a year long expire date. It was containers filled with random containers with random amount of items.
---
That's not what we'd say in boonies back in the day. :)
---
I went from null to high/low and there is more action in the latter.
---
People just projecting the blackout changes on wormholers because they've always had blackout, so clearly it's their fault.
---
We fight everyday. 
---
2014 was getting our asses handed to us repeatedly and hanging on due to sheer numbers, leading to the complete shitshow of 2015.
---
My corp has no rolling ships.
---
I was thinking about upvoting when I realized it was a shitpost, then I saw this:
---
&gt; 2nd division bog snorkling team.
---
Goddamnit, I'm in the middle of a library and struggling to hold in my laughter! That's the funniest thing I've read all week. Upvoted.
---
But if your defending your space then all of that stuff you said does not matter matters.    
---
That is the context he is talking about.   Not the mention who ever you fought will come back for a few weeks to do the same thing over and over.
---
yes
---
I guess I just remember 2014 Brave differently, sure PL was bullying us for lulz or whatever but all of that shit was exciting, especially for someone new to the game. Comms where lit up with hardship but community, like that shit was awesome no one I played with quit the game during the hell camp of GE, especially when the speeches before fights and shit where given. Idk maybe it’s just rose tinted glasses but I miss the fuck out of that.
---
This is the kind of crap that kills this sub. Learn your fucking place you didn't create and maintain the mmo that has lasted almost 20 years.      
---
You can disagree with decisions (personally I would roll the game back to 2010) but attacking the developers in a personal way is worthless content.
---
I mean, they did rename slaves to make room for shield slaves so it's getting closer relatively.
---
You also don't shower or use deodorant cause nobody can smell you in local.....
---
This may be true for you but most people find it hard to overcome what they see as the game developers forcing them to play the game in a way they want to play. These are the people who never come back.
---
As for there being nothing like eve out there many people play different types of online games and will switch games often.
---
You can tell who doesn't know shit about cooking but love being masters of the obvious by the posts saying "BUT Dr. Pepper and Coke are different sodas LOL"
---
My favorite ship to hunt with. Beautiful painting man.
---
Iirc it persists when you dock in a citadel.
---
That was the old system.
---
Before it changed to 10% and 20% bonuses. In like 2013
---
A confirmation window defeats the entire point of trade.
---
Weapon tiericide announced for summer 2016.
---
\#Neverforget
---
Probably based on when most players quit.
---
Any half decent group that want to declare war on someone else can just put up an undefended raitaru in some backwater and call it the HQ. That's like a 500-600m ISKs investment and the vast majority of wardec targets could not kill an unfit raitaru if you gave them a cap stable polarized oracle.
---
Use a fitted astra (1.5-2.0B?) with a logged off gunnery alt or two in it if you want to defend it.
---
By the standards of highsec wardeccers (lol faction/deadspace fit Leshaks with Nestor reps and Loki webs) 2B is nothing.
---
Because wormholes are independent of the man children overlords of 0.0
---
I can neither confirm nor deny...
---
Agreed, CCP/EVE does not need CSM in its current state.
---
Probably referencing the CSM Minutes, if anyone is curious. Looks like there isn't much of a promise, but to be honest it would be a surprise if the tournament came back next year anyway.
---
&gt; Olmeca Gold asks if the Alliance Tournament is gone forever.CCP Dopamine says the community team would really like to see the AT come back because they understand that it was special to an important group of EVE players. CCP Falcon says he loves the AT and has a long history with it. He identifies some issues in bringing it back including space to produce the stream, the development time to make sorely needed updates to the tournament tools, staffing the tournament since in the past it's been a passion project and relies on CCP volunteers, and general stagnation of the format of the tournament
---
Oh, they don't like public structures because those structures can quickly turn not-public. Couriers in low or null are especially wary of doing anything outside of structures they don't own.
---
That requires active devs working on the game to do the changes. Ain't got no budget for that between all the booze and flying neckbeards out to Iceland.
---
I honestly have no ideas. In all my experiences and conversations with WHers, I have never known a more polite, intelligent, well spoken and sociable group of players. These are the guys who will go out of their way to be nice to you, go the extra mile for somebody who needs a little help, and they are always willing to get your back when you're getting crapped on and don't deserve it. 
---
These are the very best people out there. Trust me.
---
Yea but it's because they can't contract it back to the main to deliver it. They use alts to haul and the main to accept/contract to avoid wars n stuff.. but in doing ng so they can't accept containers contracts.
---
Sad to see the extent of Catiz's reformation is just better-centralized feudalism, not the abolition of feudal military organizations and reorganization along modern lines. The Amarr Empire has finally reached a 17th-century understanding of command practices.
---
&gt; propose to remove playstyles
---
When that play style is depending on the client lying to a player, I'm quite please to see it gone.
---
The other use is acceptable collateral damage.
---
I think [the Tyrannis trailer](https://youtu.be/Ms95NKFnhCU) was the most amazing way to show what you can expect from playing EvE. You can do almost anything and fly almost any path imaginable, but it's not just *you* out there. Thousands of other players who may or may not share your goals or ideals inhabit this living universe we play in, and you *will* clash with them at some point.
---
Accept it, embrace it, and you will find more joy in EvE than you ever imagined possible.
---
It becomes even more subtle when you consider the Sleips would obviously bring logi of their own. But not FAX. Not carriers or supers either. See that's how you win guys, every time.
---
But like I said, that's the meta. It's become the meta because it's objectively better than everything else. I don't believe in handicapping yourself for some sense of space honor, it's just sad that we've lost so much diversity to this over the past 3 years. I'm sure it occurred to all of you that nobody would roam in 20 Sleips these days.
---
What's your solution to cloaky camping?
---
The fucking game in it's current state is bad. You want ships to die? Stop allowing ships to escape in a nanosecond.
---
People stuck their hands up that they'd like to see it gone. 
---
But it was obvious (from body language) that they weren't being serious.
---
I tried to get people to FAP (friendly agression pact) instead of NIP (non invasion pact), but the nippers won out.
---
Something something classic wow
---
I made an alt with the sole goal of "I want to fly perfect enyo" and I think I ran out of relevant skills to train at about 8 mil SP then started training for new things. So perhaps my 5 mill estimate was a little low but the point still stands really.
---
I'm covered for 254days....
---
^^^^^
---
This. So much this.
---
If you wanna be a pirate, sure. 
---
But WHers wanna be a pirate that cannot be attacked. Just surprise buttsex wormholes that they jam through, find some guy in space, kill him or get dropped on, then run back into their hole.
---
well DU have a lot of potential but they didn't even implement the PvP, probably before chrismas, wait a bit before judging it
---
You're reading something into it, that wasn't there.
---
Fozzie was not suggesting it was removed completely.
---
I remember having to log in everyday just to update skill queue because 24 hour limits. Then I would chat with clorpies and 6 to 8 hours later realize I spent a whole day playing EVE.
---
Now I dont even use a skill queue and just buy injectors as I need them.
---
Also something something PCU.
---
as an independent observer i've got this to say: if wormholers think their skill entitles them to easy kills, then they should be able to outskill fighters and bosons, full stop. otherwise don't cry when you run back to your hole with tail between legs.
---
i'm sorry which thread am i in again
---
Maybe they will fold into TEST so the donut can grow
---
yuuup, recently bought a set of +4s as a newvro and it's probably the worst thing I could have done. Now I have to jumpclone if I want to do anything dangerous and I feel like shit being locked out of my training clone for 24hrs (which is usually waaay longer than I'm actually pvping/exploring/whatever. The alternative is just saying fuck it and undocking with a 100M pod that doesn't even give me any kind of combat bonuses. That also feels like garbage when I inevitably get popped, esp when even the t2 frigs I fly are half the price and 100x the excitement of boring "number go up" implants.
---
i think it would be nice if we had another weekly thread like this, one where we post all our stories about the funny things that happened to us in the game. the sub needs more light-hearted positivity! (◠‿◠)
---
But if you're defending your space against 20 Sleipnirs and you don't undock with your 20 Thoraxes you're still sitting in a station interior doing nothing until the Sleipnirs decide to leave. Who cares if they come back after you fight, you can take another 2b from them at 4 sleip kills for 400m in losses for a full wipe in disposable 'raxes. 
---
I believe Aryth's argument is 'If there was no logi on the Sleips side'. If they have 4 Scimitars with their 20 Sleipnirs you never even achieve a single kill, thus you do not undock Thoraxes under any circumstances. Compared to trading the Thoraxes for a 5:1 ISK ratio advantage and achieving a pyrrhic victory. 
---
It seems you have circular logic similar to that of a level 4 mission runner. "We must not give any fights at all or take any losses and blueball players as much as possible so we can get the best mining/ratting ticks" - so we can have a super fleet so we can keep our space, so we can keep blueballing and not giving fights and building more supers and titans to compensate for the bleeding of our members who have left our alliance because we're only making ISK for the sake of having ISK, just like how the Level 4 Raven Navy Issue pilot makes ISK to invest ISK in his Raven Navy Issue to make more ISK to invest more ISK... until he gets too many purps and gets ganked by CODE ofc.
---
Ahhhh, okay, that summary makes perfect sense then.  Thanks.
---
Your post was shit.
---
Australian time, Summer 2019 is Nov/Dec
---
At this point I've seen people who clearly are not wormholers say "wormholer btw" to trigger people because everyone gets bent out of shape by j-space weirdos. Honestly I'm tempted to do the same.
---
&gt; LE: and if i think about my begging as a intra and inter regional trading that's where margin trading helped me the most and then when i decided to go into more expensive items. Nowadays i could &gt;cover 2 chars worth of orders without margin trading so it doesn;t affect me personally but i still feel bad. Like when plex mover disapeared as a profesion
---
That's my edit to my previous reply. It has it's legitimately uses as well. And btw did ccp show any data on how many people fall for the margin scam?
---
&gt; they get RIDICULOUSLY mad and aggressive when questioned
---
&gt; You’re an idiot
---
hmm
---
&gt; Suicide Kings
---
[perks up] Is that a Freespace reference?
---
Yes, agreed, particularly with the range and application point (and also resists don't affect logi).
---
My point is just that FAXes are completely game breaking, whereas subcap logi is just a bit of a problem, and so CCP should direct their attention at FAXes first.
---
You're going to have to define what you mean by being farmed then, because it would generally mean someone is repeatedly coming to you to fight you in the hope of gaining something. If you're isk positive then clearly they lost more than they can loot from you.
---
If it's about killboard stats and killmarks then who cares, they have no material meaning.
---
Can confirm. Takes me a while to undock because of switching clones.
---
really enjoy my corpmates every single one of them. can't wait to get off work just to fly with them.
---
You know wormholes work in both directions, right? And you can go onto their turf to attack them back?
---
I was told I'd have the tools I needed to take care of it this year. That ended up not being the case, and I doubt most of the competitive community is willing to put 3 months of work in to promote CCP's game for free after being lied to like that.
---
DP is a ... regrettable acronym
---
&gt;People will still likely form up in GE and fight you
---
Yes they form a cap blob and gate camp for 7 dudes lmao.
---
&gt;Dunk Dinkle doesn't want that, He wants the hostiles to get the hell out of his system."
---
It's mostly just people upset about blackout lashing out. And since a lot of the people posting in favour of blackout are wormholers, because they understand that playing without local is not only fine but more fun - Eve PvE is boring, the risk of becoming content makes it more exciting - it looks like they're having a go at wormholers specifically.
---
And then the Goons propaganda department sees that and uses it as an angle to metagame the blackout away.
---
The "quote" in the meme is a paraphrasing of the CSM minutes.
---
Spaghetti code. That's what prevents things from happening.
---
Remove learning attributes and you may not train at all. 
---
They removed billboard at one point and it broke stations and Stargates.
---
There is literally evidence that they moved to FW space and I personally have seen those that stayed in null downship to sub caps. I dont understand why you're so convinced that blackout did anything. The only people left in space were botting myrms. All blackout did was chase away actual players who will never come back.
---
&gt; A lot of pve players will not do and risk anything without a very high level of control
---
That's the thing that needs addressing and CCP wimped out of trying to actually do something about that.
---
&gt; You cant really compensate the increased risk here in terms of rewards unless you go crazy, which is undesirable
---
Not really true, people rat in C2 and C3 wormholes and the increased reward there is not crazy. There is plenty of counterplay to blackout - dscan, gate scouts, response fleets.
---
see you and Aryth are  making the mistake that killing 2b of ships is an achievement it aint.   Because the goal is to hold the field of battle and drive the enemy out of your space.   
---
The 2b of isk  is a salve to make ya feel good for when you have no other choice than to take a fight.  But it is not a condition for having fun.     Fun is at least having a chance of holding the field.   ie if mistakes were made and you killed nothing and in returned were slaughtered  that sometimes is still a good fight. 
---
btw this is different for various people I do realize.
---
oh, i remember that story and for me it feels like the trust between the player base and ccp is broken on so many levels, not only in regards to the alliance tournament/tournament tools. i havent finished the csm minutes yet but... eve online roadmap, anyone?
---
They dont bring brawl ships into null because capital escalation and super cap umbrellas. Brawl ships are used in J space quite regularly.
---
&gt; For example, If I'm going to risk a ship worth 1b, I want a reasonable certainty that I will keep it long enough to pay for itself and make a reasonable amount of money.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Since the lack of local means that a hostile could be in system without my knowing, I would need to be making ~100 mil PER SECOND for the risk / reward to feel fair.
---
No, this is retarded. Wormholers rat with 1 bil ships all the time, and accept that there is a risk they might lose it. Yes, you would hope, if you play well, that you won't die (at least on average) before it's paid for itself. But that risk profile is not on the basis of seconds.
---
Do you lose your ship every 20 seconds? You must be a really bad player.
---
My eyes still read the old values, lmao
---
:'D
---
It sounds like that's what the CSM is working for. That, and we want more punishment for smaller entities (less ability to defend, less asset safety than big alliances, less mobility, etc). Null Sec is absolutely 10-ply (impossibly soft). It's not surprising that CSM is more "business as usual".
---
&gt; People keep talking about risk/reward but this wasnt about that. It was the lack of counters that caused the issue. If you cant control when you are tackled
---
FC what is
---
- dscan
---
- watching gates
---
- having friends nearby
---
- tank
---
can't you just use grindr to find friends like everyone else?
---
&gt;So, we went from "there'll definitely be an AT next year, it's just a one year hiatus" to "uuuuh maybe we don't have any resources to make one".
---
A total shocker.Nobody could have predicted that.
---
&gt; when the Wormhole spokesman is saying its too easy to get intel in WH space then you know there is an issue
---
But when he's saying that you know it's also bullshit when nullseccers claim they can't know what's going on in their system without local.
---
here i am training to get into a fax pretty sure its going to get nerfed which to be honest I think all caps should get nerfed but thats just me
---
Yeah. That made me laugh too.
---
no ship will escape in sub 1 second, because of game limitations.
---
I have never eaten pulled pork despite living almost a damn year in the US, please send recipe.
---
&gt; The reward is high for how it is now, post blackout, but thats only because player have put time and isk into making the space they rat and mine in profitable
---
How is local chat anything to do with 'players having put time and isk into ... the space'?
---
All the infrastructure you talk about was still there during blackout.
---
"Temporarily."
---
F's in chat for characters who weren't born before the Battlecruiser skill split
---
Are you talking about those bombers being bridged onto you repeatedly?
---
I do think that a balancing change to go with blackout should have been made to covert cynos and bridging/black ops drops. That's the one area that the nullbear 'no counterplay' argument actually has some legitimacy.
---
If you're talking about hunters gating a bomber fleet then there are plenty of obvious counterplays to that around the gates.
---
Faction war? :D
---
Simple solution singularity instead of TQ
---
this is the correct answer
---
mmmh
---
In the name of Anoikis, and of the Suns, and the Holey Spirit, D-Scan.
---
It seems [the Dragoon](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Opux+Dragoon+Yacht&amp;ids=25560) has *less* EHP than [the regular Opux Luxury Yacht](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Opux+Luxury+Yacht&amp;ids=635). Not sure why. Maybe they just use Polaris frigates or Cockroaches if they don't want to die and everything else is considered fair game for killboards?
---
The blocblob exists here, too.  And the Chaos era changes infinitely affect sov space but not us nearly as much.  I'd be tired of listening to us, too, if I weren't us.  Long live us.
---
Messed with the colours and contrast in Lightroom but it's at original resolution.
---
Yea, they wanted to make all these big changes and they were making noise all over. Now they announced the end of blackout and its been dead quite. No updates on whats to come, no updates on what they learned...nothing. Players continuing to not log in because they're starting to about the game as much as it seems CCP does at this point...not at all.
---
We need a long term plan for where they want Eve to end up, yes. I don't think demanding a weekly schedule is sensible - it's hardly chaos if you can plan for it on a weekly basis, is it? But we do need to know things like, are CCP planning on doing anything about nullsec ISK printing in the long term (having bailed out of \#deletelocal)? Are they going to change how wormholes work? Are they concerned about highsec incursions or highsec abyssals? And fundamentally do they want an Eve which encourages PVP, or do they want farmville-in-space?
---
At the moment they are losing PVPers because the game today is farmville, but they are also losing farmers because they are worried that will stop, and new people reading about Eve don't know which sort of game it is either.
---
And again yes they did move to fw, which is preferable. I dunno what you are trying to convince me of, but ok. I prefer bots in lower income places so they dont inflate the economy cause ratting super and plexing venture cannot be compared.
---
A control tower.
---
Sub 100m character detected
---
Ain't wrong
---
Dont be triggered , i'm not forcing you to do this.
---
Its the best place to ask for this
---
Granted the new sword and crown skins knock ot out of the park.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Eat shit retard
---
No roadmap. 80% dev time on NPE.
---
Thanks to Classic WoW, I now think of something besides one of my favorite ships, when I see the word 'Myrmidon'.
---
I have no idea what you might consider to be a genuine competitor to Eve.
---
Im in the same boat but its all capital 5 :(
---
After being cloaky for so long, sometimes it's nice to let them know we're here.  ¶=
---
I was thinking of shortening the timer (taking away the ability for the defender to set the day, maybe) instead. Certainly, there needs to be some mechanism whereby the final timer is guaranteed to be during the war, so you can actually force a fight.
---
Lol. no. It's corrupt to it's very core.
---
It looks like a clear case of sheer audacity paying off for the offender. Why would CCP search for that on YouTube if they never thought anyone would be brazen enough to post it there.
---
Of course, that would probably require the video to *not* be over a year old.
---
There are some skills which are "IV might as well be nothing", the range and navigation skills are the worst about it, since not enough range or speed in a kite scenario might as well mean 0 range and 0 speed. The application skills also have an outsize effect in frigate scale since usually nobody is applying perfectly and the worse that damage is applied the more that a little bit more counts.
---
If you consider 1-2 caps a blob of caps then sure. The only time i've seen what i would call a blob of caps in catch was during a rorqual save.
---
This is less an issue of what you remove than it is about how you remove it.
---
There are ways to non-destructively isolate code snippets without accidentally deleting all of highsec space.

We are only vegans in the sense that we refrain from killing innocent animals and eat ethically sourced capsuleer corpses instead.
---
The only reasons the big entities of Eve hate black out was because it snapped their bot back bone.
---
This is the one that I think is most needed.
---
Hasn't needed CSM in any state since they have never really listened to CSM anyway.
---
No, this is a really bad idea, as several other people have pointed out. Being able to time HIC bubbles, dictor bubbles, cloaking and anything else that is local to your ship is a significant part of the skill of flying a ship.
---
The one I would like is 'start firing after reload' on guns, because that's more of a chore than a skill.
---
Yeah nerf fighters for sure because it's the most scalable thing in the game cough. Please dont look at the real issues like botting or the meek rorqual/mining farms. Lmfao
---
I know a guy who forgot to update his clone and lost battlecruiser V a week or so before that patch. He still hasn’t got amarr or caldari done
---
You dont need these tools to run a tournament.
---
Maybe corps and alliances should aim to keep a certain culture and encourage anyone who fits in to join. If they start drifting away from the culture in question, then help the player to find a corp that suits them and wish them all the best when they leave.
---
Not everyone is going to want to play this game the same way, and there's nothing wrong with that. As long as a corporation or alliance keeps its identity, then isn't it all good?
---
Audacity is a remarkable free program.
---
T2 Rockets apply to almost every frigate in the game perfectly? As do most close range weapon platforms.

No it doesn't. lol
---
What is this max reward and how do I get it?!?@
---
No I mean even if you killed them they can reship immediately and be right back on top of you. It's not like they were gone (more or less) for the day like in a wormhole. You knew they can immediately come back and often times they did. Add in the fact they can pretty much come in from anywhere within 8 lys meant Null Sec was like  a wormhole with 30 unrollable holes.
---
At that point, the rouge director might as well just transfer the keepstar if he has that level of permissions (not into corp permissions assuming you'd need to control structures to set them as war HQ)
---
blackout was the first time I made a shitload of isk off exploration, plus a killmark on my Stratios

The number of people that use or operate courier services is actually rather small compared to the population at large.  
---
Anyone that does use them knows exactly what you're taking about and finds it infuriating as well, but that's how it's always been so most have reached acceptance.
---
Dunk also said he would like to see 200 vs 200 fights rather than 200 bombers killing 1 person... yet is apart of the coalition that drops supers/titans on anything which resulted in slippery bombers being the meta
---
Or, Bob forbid, there's a yellow wreck nearby. You can blow up MTU's all day long but watch out for that dangerous, off limits, very *special* yellow wreck - "*it's another player's property*" they say...
---
\*not bitter at all\* lol
---
It's not one guy, like 90% of WH flairs were saying similar things. Also has an "us vs them" mentality when wormholers were enthusiastically cheering on CCP doing stupid shit because it makes life harder for people who live in null and trying to get our economy nerfed when wormholes shit out 500m/account dual/tri boxing in a much safer enviroment.
---
Whats the actual quote?
---
If you can't fight, you are expected to feed or face eviction. That the wormhole code.
---
Join a corp, soloing in a wormhole is less fun and more risky than having friends.
---
If you can't roll the connections then yeah, researching the hole and keeping a close eye on dscan is about the best you can do.
---
This is a sad thing to heat on a Friday evening. But hey, at least I got to participate and get killed in the last very AT.
---
Really not true. C3 ratting will make probably about 120m/hr while actually in the hole with the Praxis. You don't die every two hours if you're paying attention.
---
You gotta stop saying DP... Lol either that or I need to get my mind outta the gutter
---
Happy Birthday Sm3ll!
---
That's if the hole isn't critted by the WH fleet going out then coming back in. Getting into a specific wormhole is a lot harder if you aren't in a hole yourself, no statics.
---
Literally nobody thinks Dr. Pepper is a cola.
---
So you *are* talking about those bombers being bridged onto you repeatedly?
---
"CCP Falcon says he loves the AT and has a long history with it. He identifies some issues in bringing it back including space to produce the stream, the development time to make sorely needed updates to the tournament tools, staffing the tournament since in the past it's been a passion project and relies on CCP volunteers, and general stagnation of the format of the tournament." - posted below
---
The worst thing about wormholes is that its full of wormholers.
---
This is the issue with balancing a ship used both for PvP and PvE, an option could be to increase the radius of the rats so a carrier could still apply well to them but I'm not sure what side effects that might introduce.  I would also like to point out that nerfing fighters and nerfing/changing rorq/mining aren't mutually exclusive.
---
But how do we get our cap fleets through holes? /s
---
It's Pop you fuckin heathens!
---
That's true but most nullsec roams won't be a fleet big enough to significantly mass the hole.
---
Pretty sure they eat each others' meat daily, so this isn't true
---
Because Sabres apparently also web web so a bubble is effective for more than 3 seconds.
---
Move it a citadel with a clone bay you can swap clones instantly in a citadel without a timer.
---
Yeah i was going to say. My que is around 700 days last i checked... I think I only have 8 or 9 skills on there...
---
I have not even really checked this year. Why watch the worlds slowest paint dry?
---
It's winding down folks.  So many memories for a lot of years, but, nothing is forever.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was the last CSM.  They're whittling down the staff to just what they need to keep the lights on for as long as EvE still flows cash, then, it'll be lights out.
---
they need to alter the cap/rep dynamic IMO.
---
cap needs to be the ammo of reps. and it needs to expire rapidly.
---
remote reps need to extend the life of a ship, not make it invulnerable.
---
after a few dozen cycles, if you're using all of your reps, you're capped out.
---
they need to remove the potential for net energy gain from logi transfers in all forms. the absolute maximum efficiency of a transfer could be very high, but it should never be above 1/1. 
---
you could fit a booster, but now you're fitting less tank, and significantly less tank at that. boosters cost precious grid. so now you can be squished because you couldnt fit that plate or extender.
---
and if you wish to fit energy xfers \*and\* remote reps... ouch, your poor capacitor.
---
they wouldnt need to adjust any rep values. the problem of fight longevity fixes itself. after a couple minutes, your reps will be dry or dead(because you fit them for cap stability instead of tank) and ships will start dying.
---
Methinks you aren't from a pulled pork zone like NC.

Leshak meta is because Leshaks are kind of very strong and have several qualities that fit Jspace. Firstly they do a lot per head, and are very mass-efficient in terms of how much utility/damage they can bring and due to their stats scale very well with bling. This is important in wormhole space because mass limits limit fleet sizes so it's a quality over quantity situation compared to null. Fights happen at smaller scale, so brawling has always been more common too, and combined with mass limitations which push towards slower armor comps the Leshak's biggest weakness, low speed, is less consequential. The tracking is also ridiculous so there's no way to counter by bringing damage mitigating comps of ships as they get shredded all the same.
---
I think overall that's partly just Leshak being a good fit for the space and partly a balance issue with triglavian tracking/projection/dps triad. They have the tracking of autocannons but the projection of beam lasers and dps in blaster territory at spool. The weapon should be looked at, I think.
---
That said there are EW counters like TDs or ECM to break the lock which has been pushing the meta a bit away from the initial leshak rush although I think lesh/drek staple will be here to stay for the forseeable future.
---
This is, pretty much, the reason I want to have learning implants changed to things like the cerebral accelerators. So it's just a 'boost all kinds of training' with it, with no chance of loss of it. But with a longish duration. (variable, of course)
---
In the lussy video i linked they (tried) to camp his small gang in with 4 caps (they were 7 people).
---
GE- btw.
---
The idea of an infinity of a lesser order relative to some other infinity is old news in mathematics. In this case we have something all together different: The skill queue is a finite container for a potentially infinite content.
---
Abyssal sites lvl 3 make the same isks without any risk.
---
I think you're in the clear bud.  "Age of Chaos" was their last gasp attempt to breathe some life into EvE.  I think they're done.  Hilmar will sit in his office now and count down the days until his earn-out contract is up.
---
It was an experiment in little (effort wise) changes that might shake up the status quo and make a big impact and re-energize Eve's player base.  The experiment failed.  What they learned was that what actual people are left playing in 2019 just wanted their status quo back.
---
So, I think you're now in the age of the slow downward spiral, and the status quo.  If you enjoy 10 boxing Rorquals and if your bank account and hanger are how you keep score in EvE, you should enjoy what's left of it.

You can only be hit by smartbombs if you're still on grid and in warp,  even if you're accelerating slowly you can't be targeted anymore

you don't have to dock anymore to deliver to a citadel

Ccps greatest failure was not letting you put your exotic dangers into your captains quarters when you could walk around in it

3/4 assed would just include give all learning implants a description that says "a small/medium/large increase to skill training" and then have it bonus all attributes by +1/2/3.
---
98% of people from kspace have literally no idea about the details of WHs, so cant even have real discussions (and the converse is not true, lots of the WH corp old members have been on/led significant sov campaigns). Given that, we pretty much just mildly troll here outside of specific threads

honestly i could really do without the lore BS if the resources go somewhere useful. seems the RP folks in eve are quite few and far between
---
oof
---
&gt;  I don't think that EVE really has concept of skilled pilots
---
Skilled pilots disagree.
---
Again, wormholers weren't over producing titans and supers that killed the game.
---
Don't pretend that having a thousand Titans is somehow "balanced" in any way. This is why the blackout was bringing people back- your oppressive hand killing bullshit was rendered dangerous to actually use.
---
The blackout was sustaining eve, even if you vehemently cry salt crystals about it and deny it as much as you like.
---
First, that's irrelevant to the incorrect statement you made before about C3 ratting being 'unplayable'.
---
And also: Don't think that's actually true. https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9ax0k1/loot_from_50_t3_electrical_abyssal_sites/ this thread from 2018 suggests an overall payout of about 150m/hr for C3s, yes. But if you update the loot value for today's prices (http://evepraisal.com/a/j2ov6?live=yes), the overall payout for 12 hours of sites is 800-900m, which is only about 70m/hr.
---
While true, Citadels have really influenced the staying power of entities in WH's.  That said, I fucking love no asset safety.  Just lost our fortizar and I've never felt more alive.

Infinity Battlespace just released into early access.  Its fun as shit too.

Actually in modern English both CPUs and CPU's are acceptable phrasing for the pluralization of initialisms.
---
he meant 200 supers vs 200 atrons
---
No but you do if you transfered the package to another character for the haul. If you do that you cant contract it back.
---
What blackout?
---
Just form up 200 bombers and pay evescout for the hole you need. Suddenly they are not so spooky.
---
&gt; to prevent all of the people that just turn it on mid-warp so that the ship docks as soon as it lands.
---
These pilots are already using skill and preparation, because this trick is only reliable when you're warping to an insta-dock BM with your destination set to the station. IOW you're asking to remove an option for skilled play that defeats gankers.

If attribute-enhancing implants *were* to stay, then they should work like this:
---
* No more remaps, give us maxed available attributes without implants in every area. You need to be at essentially peak human capabilities in every way to even *qualify* for Capsuleer training, so remapping is not just a bad mechanic, it also breaks with the lore.
---
* Generic attribute-enhancing implants stay with you when jumping to another clone or after getting podded, like Cerebral Accelerators and the Genolution 'Auroral' AU-79. Faction implants no longer provide attribute bonuses.
---
* Basic attribute implants have a fixed price and are available from designated NPC sellers across all of New Eden, like BPOs.
---
* Tying into the previous bullet, buying a more powerful implant costs less if you have a weaker version already installed. For example, if a Basic Ocular Filter costs 7.2 million ISK and a Standard Ocular Filter costs 19 million ISK, then upgrading from basic to standard will only cost you 11.8 million ISK.
---
* Once you buy a basic attribute enhancer it's slotted in, you can only buy a better one. This will keep people from scamming newbies (I *hope*).
---
* Optional: Faction implants that occupy the same slot as attribute-enhancing implants will be changed to work in tandem with one another. Having a better attribute-enhancer in the same slot as your Grail/Snake/Talisman will give it small bonuses.
---
I fully understand if none of you want or even care if this idea is implemented, but I figured there was no harm in throwing the idea out into the open where you can all criticize it. Just be civil, please. I'm perfectly willing to toss an idea into the bin if no one likes it, so there's no need to yell at me for being an idiot.
---
Aha! It does say that!
---
Well, that negates my previous.
---
Keep the box closed and in mint condition. Pass it on to your offspring. Admonish them to pass it on to theirs.
---
Five generations down the line there will be an antiques roadshow type situation. If we still have a society as a species, somebody will sit at the table and have this kind of conversation:
---
“I don’t know whether you noticed when you first opened that box I was a little taken aback.”
---
- Yes
---
“That’s because one rarely sees something like this. I’ve got to say, this is quite the find. Where did you get this?”
---
- This is an heirloom. My great grandmother got this from a distant relative who got this from his grandfather and who was told to hang on to it. Not really knowing what it was he kept it in a cupboard in his den. It sat there for decades until he passed away and it was given to my great grandmother’s mother who was told to pass it on. My grandmother died last year and this was part of her estate. I recently got married and my husband thought I should have this appraised to see if it had any value at all.
---
“A fascinating story. I’m sorry for your loss of your grandmother. Do you know what this is?”
---
- Well, the box clearly says ‘Tempest, collector’s model’ and ‘EVE Online’. We have done some research and we were able to establish it must have been some kind of video game? We tried to find more about it and the internet archive has quite a bit of material on it. We saw some references and images to this precise model, but the context... the people who played this video game appear to have been... quite strange, actually. It’s hard to put my finger on it but they seemed *weird*. We don’t know what to make of it.
---
“You’re quite right. This is a model of a spaceship, more specifically, a Tempest is a battleship class vessel of the Minmatar, as it was called, faction in the EVE Online universe. This was the first ’single node’ sandbox video game that could be played form anywhere in the world, and it was. It had a vibrant player community that would regularly meet up in a multitude of places anywhere in the world. The game originated from a gaming studio called ‘CCP’ [Crowd Control Productions, to give you an idea of how they thought about their customers] in Reykjavik, Iceland. The game was later to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art in New York [that is, the New York before the Great Flood], and it had passionate customer base that was won’t to engage in absurdly elaborate schemes to wrest control over player corporations, alliances and the regions that made up the game world known as New Eden.”
---
- I had no idea! We got that it was some kind of experience, we don’t understand how it worked.
---
“Trust me, even in its heyday there were not a lot of people, the game developers included, who truly understood all the ins and outs of the game. The rules being open the game was actually only limited to the imagination of the players. A fascinating world indeed.”
---
- I’ll say.
---
“Looking at this box which has, in all this time never been opened [quite an astonishing feat!], this box will contain a model of the Tempest ship and, if there was no other kind of damage, which the outside of the box gives no indication of, the model should be in mint condition.
---
- It was always kept in a water-tight package, I’ve brought it along, we don’t know whether that came with the original product.
---
“I don’t believe it did. The shrink wrap you see here would be the manufacturer’s wrapping, it would be packaged in a shipping box that was standard for the day."
---
- I see
---
“There have been instances of counterfeit or ‘home bew’ printed items, but the markings on the box indicate that this is a genuine model, from the very early days of the company. This is as genuine as it gets.”
---
- That’s astonishing. Aside from some remarks in an electronic file we knew nothing of the antecedents of this model.
---
“Have you had it insured in any way?”
---
- Other than general fire insurance, we haven’t taken out any insurance, no.
---
“Well, that is something you might like to look into. Do you have any idea of the current value of this item?”
---
- We have no idea. We think, because of its age we might get $500 to $1000 Dollars for it.
---
“*coughs loudly* Dear me. I’m sorry, I lost my concentration there for a second. This is a rare item that is seldom auctioned. However, there is a specialised market place for vintage gaming paraphernalia, especially from the dawn of the computer age where video games were new experiences that not everybody had heard of before. They are now, of course, well-established forms of art, back in the day, and this is late 20th century, early 21s century [EVE Online was released as a product in 2003, yes Two Thousand and Three!], that was definitely not always the case.
---
- I can imagine.
---
“So, without further ado, I hope you’re sitting comfortably, this is the actual, genuine product. This is a unique, one off run of one of the iconic ships in the New Eden universe. Furthermore, it is in mint condition, there are no blemishes on the box, it does not appear to have been opened. If that is the case, and the model is present and in the same condition, I would make an appointment with my insurer and have it insured for anything between $1.5 and $2 million dollars.
---
- *GASP!!*
---
“Yes indeed. You have brought one of the greatest treasures in early video game history, right through that door over there. We often see model kits from back in that day. They often are in terrible condition and they don’t come in the original packaging. This, though, this is such a rare find, I would be amazed if I saw another one just like it, in the same impeccable condition as this box. This is video game archeology at its very finest. I sincerely congratulate you on an extremely rare find.
---
- I don’t know what to say.
---
The RP community is actually a decent size. Plus we'll be here far longer then pure pew folks.
---
yep.
---
If CCP thinks it's customers are bad, try playing with them.
---
You did not link any video.

The reward has always been there. There was no risk, CCP introduced risk and the crabs cried.

---
They're Eve's equivalent of vegans.
---
They are absolutely sure that they have found the One True Way, and will constantly talk about how they have found the One True Way and are dismissive of those who are not followers of the One True Way.
---
They tend to be ultra wealthy and fly mean hunting ships because of it.
---
Only wormholers will decloak 20 lokis on you to kill you then fade away.
---
They are seeded through missions. When you blow up certain structures, they drop in the loot cans.
---
Literally anything you can name in EVE probably meets said description, actually.
---
Those people were always there, just literally no one listened to them.
---
thats some heavy hearsay there sir
---
Not that I can think of off the top of my head... I'm not an EVE historian though.
---
I think CCP disallowed alpha players to restront the towers.
---
The lore is probably written by ISD volunteers with like 5 minutes overview by CCP person to double check it, so... ok?
---
defo, the time wasted writing this could have been better spent. I bet someone could have made it to the coffee shop down the street and back
---
A worse warp speed means there's longer between a hostile hitting local or dscan and that hostile landing on grid.
---
first of all i like you use of the word probably. i too can make anything up and toss that on the end. then its a waste of time, regardless of the magnitude probably
---
Everyone has a corpse collection. Mine just happens to include several of my own. I mean, you all would fuck yourself.
---
Orcas Always make me think about the Covenant Dropship from Halo Combat Evolved
---
&gt; Because the goal is to hold the field of battle and drive the enemy out of your space. 
---
by not engaging those sleips at all, you aren't acheiving either
---
feel like at this point you should just bring more dps then.
---
I had BC5 but no amarr skills. So I dont feel like I missed out on anything.
---
It could be far less!
---
50 level 1 skills could probably be crammed in 1 day even!
---
I've played off and on since 2004, the csm has always been a mediocre idea with mediocre at best results.

It causes way more problems than it has ever fixed or improved.
---
Blitzing the site. Good advice thanks
---
Read what I said, wormholes =/= k space.  
---
Wormhole space has system control mechanics that lower the risk of loss, (No hot drops, closing wormholes, etc.) that compensate for the lack of local.  
---
In k-space, without local, you can be ganked by a fleet of reds with absolutely no warning at any time with absolutely no counter.
---
PRAISE BOB
---
Logged in to contract some stuff to a buddy the other day, realized accounts with alpha. Oh well.
---
Yes.
---
The long-play April Fool's joke. :golfclap:
---
it's not an airport. can I have your stuff?
---
Exactly mines over 450 days so I don't have to worry for long
---
Then interest from both teams and spectators falls off massively. That the AT involves actual loss and consequences is what makes it uniquely an Eve event. That there is something actually at stake is why people miss betting on these sort of events.
---
Imagine if Eve was the game people like to pretend it is.
---
Pretend like you can't shut down access to a wormhole at will.
---
It wouldn't matter if they were cloaked or not, if they catch you you're still dead...
---
Of course you could setup scouts on the gates and watch for new sigs in your system but that involves effort so most didn't bother and most died as a result.
---
What a nonsense thread
---
People hate on wormholers because they live in the safest space in the game, despite producing an inordinate amount of ISK.
---
No, they're not.
---
It's not being worked on in Reykjavik
---
I've been keeping the faith
---
&gt; it's pretty annoying to go 20 jumps from places to find content.
---
FC, wat is wormholes?
---
Yeah I figured it was just scapegoating.
---
but you weren't going to achieve that goal anyways so what the point of feeding someone kills and making em stick around.  Even if it is cheap stuff because you are not having any fun and they are having a ball.
---
Hahaha nice try
---
Yeah, remaps aren't a good mechanic. Don't get me wrong, I *like* complexity in video games because it can give me more options and choice on how to play, but that only happens when it's done right; it's "good" complexity. "Bad" complexity is when there's no real purpose or benefits and you're left frustrated, confused, and put off from the game.
---
IMO, good complexity is like playing Factorio: you start off completely ignorant of how everything interacts aside from what basic intuition provides you, gradually learn how it all works over hours of play until one day you manage to create the perfect assembly line.
---
Then you step back and watch as the intricate logistics chains you spent so much effort setting up feed raw materials into refineries which in turn send the refined materials to the machines which will use them to create more complex products. All of it is working *flawlessly* without a single glitch or hiccup, and the satisfaction you feel at watching your efforts pay off is something you'll treasure.
---
Maybe EvE will never be *quite* like that, but if this game is going to be complex it should be the kind of complexity that will pay off in ways that give players that same feeling of satisfaction.
---
I dunno, banning Brisc was an entertaining source of drama.

Don't fly in nullsec if you don't want risk of an involuntary fight.

Rahne was given an account with very limited GM powers that allowed her to use the tournament tools and spectate inside the arena. That ship was never supposed to leave Jove space, but she had a friend doomsday her with the keepstar while her GM hax were off.  We all clowned her about it for the next month or so.
---
Yes, but in combination with the easy staging. The fact they can be bridged in and out of your system safely if the covert cyno has a deep safe there without any indication of anybody coming in, AND that hostiles could pretty much do it endlessly since the hardest part is undocking from an NPC station without getting caught, made it impossible for smaller groups to do anything PVE related in Null Sec.
---
For sharing the truth?
---
And yet people fly covops ships to go there
---
How ironic :)

I suspect the mtu will be worth more then the loot it will recover.

Lots of players feel this way don’t feel bad years and years of obsession And it’s coming to a end Chinese will eventually own everything and will be goons 2.0

It's ok. Most At Pilots have quit playing over the last year anyway
---
You should try it! It’s really fun. There is a subscription but you don’t have to buy it. The game is detailed but very rewarding! The game is based on a skill system so you train skills to get better and those skills work in real time. 
---
You can play the game and not ever get into PVP, but that doesn’t mean other players can’t attack you. There are zones that are high security and low security and you can stay in high sec and be fine. But exploring or mining in the lower zones grant better rewards.
---
All in all, give it a try for a week! Use this link and you save 80 days on skills and you receive 1 million skill points which is incredible.

I'm kinda sad but glad that I can finally move on.

"They don't want to fight or can't." Are you fucking kidding me? Then too bad, EVE REALLY REALLY isn't for them.  Or stay in high sec.  Or pay more attention to dscan/local.
---
In your example, if he's sending 30 dudes to kill you you should just dock.  Every second he waits for you is a second you're winning.  Nothing should be able to punch up to 30x their numbers.  If they outnumber you that badly, you don't get to fight. Go do something else for 30 minutes.
---
Very true.. Alot of LP stores have no options due to tags so learning implants are basically the only cashout.. See Khanid Navy...
---
For all that people rag on CCP, I personally can't help but feel awed at how well they put up with all the shit flung at them. I would *never* be able to handle that kind of stress.
---
&gt; is the propaganda which gets shot from Mittani's dick straight into their mouths.
---
This sentence alone wins the thread
---
With that defeatist attitude, yes it will, try getting out of your comfort zone abd creating content. The game will only stagnate if the players choose to, it's a player driven sandbox game after all.
---
We all sadly knew this was the reality. Falcon is simply a spinmaster 5000 who's full of shit.

Are there any freaky-weird themed sex parties?

Asking for a friend
---
&gt; I don't necessarily blame the devs because i don't think they are getting the right information.
---
One of the downsides to EvE's constant information warfare and propaganda is that I'm almost incapable of telling what suggestions would actually be good for the game and which are made in bad faith or by the ignorant.
---
What is skilled about it? Lol I’ll give you preparation, but skill?
---
You wormholers sure are a contentious bunch.
---
Agreed as well. They have no road map to discuss. No real concrete plans of any substance. They're figuring out how to put the game into maintenance mode without publicly giving it that kiss of death.
---
Agreed. Falcon is just spinning the company line and is full of shit - can't trust him. CCP is looking at how to put this game into maintenance mode without giving it an overt, public kiss of death.
---
First of all, nobody farms in their own hole, the returns on that are pathetic.
---
Second, the hole you rat in is usually 2-3 connections out, which provides ample time and space for ambushes, drops, camps, you name it. 
---
Compare that to multiboxing in your Rorqs, watching Netflix, and feeling your brain cells die. All you have to do is have tank and cyno, be in a fleet and on comms. The fact of the matter is that y'all are used to getting ISK with minimal risks.
---
That's solid advice. Thanks for hearing me out. I will now delete this post.
---
There are no bugs, only unannounced features...

Oh, it gets better *(not)* when you realize that some of them are probably doing one or the other at different points in these meetings, quite possibly both at the same time. There's no grand cosmic rule saying "this helps the game" and "this helps me/my group" are mutually exclusive goals.
---
I have come across what seems to be roaming trig dudes in non invaded systems, although if I'm not mistaken it wasn't far from an invading system.
---
Correction... SOME hunt in bombers. During the blackout I saw all kinds of fleets and a huge increase in solo roams. This isn't about the ship. It's about seeing a red or neutral in local. Zero risk to anyone in that system.

I've heard tell of there used to be Salvage Anomalies. I think systems that have a high number of wrecks made over the last hour should randomly spawn like a graveyard of wrecks from a massive battle that took place. Faction Salvagers and Drones. 
---
Have the loot table for salvage be divided by skill level with bonus added for strength of salvaging equipment. This means not the better your stuff the more likely you are to get salvage, but when you do get salvage, the better the rewards. As it is skilling up is pointless as it only saves time, and not enough to be useful.
---
A Rorqual - but can scoop wrecks directly into the Scrap Hold for processing. Seige mode breaks down wrecks on board and acts as an Immobile Tractor Unit.
---
It still amazes me how many people don’t know what’s going on in the game, weeks after patch notes and changes have been introduced...
---
Ok thanks
---
If you mean try to constantly evict each other that’s not really conducive to keeping the space alive. Having an eternal Russian roulette of opponents is better for long term fun.

Yeah, like I said I think the next thing they did after removing local should have been to look at hot drops and bridging. Most of the nullsec complaints were just whining about having intel taken away, but it is much harder to counter black ops drops or detect them.

People forget that the CSM came into being as a result of CCP T20 being caught red handed spawning T2 bpos for his pals. From the get-go the CSM was nothing but a pressure valve to let the wind out of angry players, now it's something much worse - a lobbyist group for those with the most ingame voting power.

id guess theyre already derailed from the planned "chaos roadmap"  
---
blackout was probably step one in a series of changes designed to significantly impact the landscape of nullsec  
---
but when 10k turbokrabs ragequitting over the very first change they implemented probably made them realize two very important things. 1. theyve literally fucked up the last 4 years of development to the point that its no longer recoverable and 2. they no longer have control over their own game - and any change they make will have to be essentially approved by the remaining status quo or they risk legit going out of business.
---
Oh fuck off. What "resources" do you think are spent writing a lore article compared to the work needed to fix eve? You think the insignificant amount of time this took to write is the issue with why Eve is so fucked? I'm willing to bet more man-hours are wasted beating off in the bathroom in a given month than spent on this type of work.

at this point you might as well just put a tag of "maybe it'll never actually be done" on every single proposed change because i'm pretty sure ccp are having a fucking existential crisis

Yes. Im a disgusting krab. Clack clack go my claws. I dont pretend to be abything else but a blue doughnut loving krab. Wormholers act like they are better than us when they are the same.

In theory you would have people playing the game that understood the mechanics be able to sort through the forums and r/eve to rely information to the dev team about imbalances and game breaking mechanics.  CCP seems to have a few people in that position, but either aren't very good at their job or they just like being trolls (see Falcon for an example of both).

It's why everyone hates crossfitters and vegans, because they can't go one minute without telling you they are a crossfitter or a vegan.

I honestly think we could lose half the map and still be more than okey. In such a universe it wouldnt be hard to maintain a subcap fleet to do the things that most want in the game. It works great for all the places near HS, like in the north. Constant roamers create constant fighting. But the rest of the map is pretty fked. 
---
And in that sense I totally get why people have issues. You roam half the map and dont see anything. You finally see some people and you get dunked by big ships. Its frustrating no doubt.
---
It's still vegan if they spit.

&gt;Huh, okay then.

&gt;BTW, does the AT take place in that little pocket of systems with active stargates in the north of the map? I've heard that's the case, but never got a reliable answer.
---
Historically it's taken place in Jove Space - where that is in terms of cardinal directions I can't tell you.
---
There's a script which moves participants to the system, and then an active overview beacon which you can warp to at ranges (your choice of range). IIRC the direction you warp in from is either polar opposites or semi-random... it might have changed in the past.

This is what it sounds like when you try too hard to be funny

... Killing afk ships and running from anything that targets you inbetween cloaking is about as much content as myrm botting

Implants are also a majority of the sinks for all LP in the game, which means that if it disappears you something else to sink LP in.

If your botting detection system is "I physically looked at him and based on no criteria at all I assumed he was a bot" you are gonna be in for a bad time.
---
While I do like blops, I also like cheap cruisers that I can just throw at stuff, I've done wormholes but it's a bit of the role of the dice, if you don't find the chain for where you want to go quick it can be even longer to find that good hole.  Either way I don't think the tediousness of jumping through empty systems is a good design.

Watch all the Scope videos on youtube and read the patch notes my dude.

I get it. It’s his job so he has to tow the company line.  It’s also entirely possible that things changed within CCP from last year to now that made a liar out of falcon but there’s no reason the player base should believe them anymore these days.
---
Can you cite an official source from CCP on that?
---
nah, im not like you

But effort.

You're both right.

Now all three of us are.

You could try not blueing everyone within 20 jumps.

Uhh wot. Bro the entry level to learn to play is at least the ability to research and read.
---
Bookmarking this thread so I can write a dissertation later.
---
Well on one hand you are correct usually everyone in 20 jumps is blue, or more accurately purple, because the systems are empty except for the people in fleet.
---
You have to understand
---
I think it's funny that when a major conflict happens, someone always seeds dancers to the staging.
---
This makes me sad
---
Wasn’t NullSec overproducing ISK too? To the point CCP has to raise taxes for everyone else?
---
I think he means the cyno limitations.
---
I could have sworn they fired/pushed out the last of them a year ago.
---
- Cloaky ships still show up on dscan when they jump in.
---
- Multiple gates is no worse than multiple wormholes - you can either have multiple people watching them, or you can just watch the ones you think enemies are likely to come through, or you can take the risk. Same as we have to in J space.
---
- If you get blobbed so hard you don't see them coming you didn't dscan and scout the next system well enough
---
- Narrative is something that nullblobbers try to manipulate to further their farming ends

HTH

They need it now more than ever, but there is no point in having it if they are simply going to ignore every suggestion the CSM makes. The point was having them act as liaison between the players and the company, but you don't need someone to do that if you don't care what the players think, say, or want to begin with.

No its not dude. Wormholers tend to just be obnoxious in general. This isnt a mystery, just read the comments.

It's generally considered better to not go through steam, but in this case that does make payment options more limited. The EVE website only accepts PayPal, Webmoney (Russian Paypal), and card. Card includes credit and prepaid cards (you could buy prepaid cards in stores with cash just like gift cards). Of those, thy accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Visa Electron, Visa Delta, and Carte Bleue.

Grrrrr bureaucracy

hilmar is literally the only person who cares about daily logged in users and that's only so he can try and argue he deserves a max payout for how "good" Eve is performing when they cut him his sale bonus check. The rest of the game goes by weekly and monthly numbers and all log ins count toward that.
---
I have always felt like the AT only appealed to the actual AT fighters. It makes sense that they would drop it to focus on stuff that has effects on more players

sounds like you wanna be fed. 20 gates is too far, you don't roll for content. tell me you're appreciative of the guys who hunt for you at least.

If you don't know what an acronym means then maybe google it before you embarass yourself.

With small tweaks these are all great suggestions. And I very much like the idea of having a roadmap so we atleast know we are moving somewhere.

Sooo.. the fuck... what... Other than being just more worthless fluff and back story, how does this effect the actual game?

Hi buddy

You do know about ranges? And that not even in the smallest systems will you be likely close enough to a gate.
---
Ah dude stop with the wormholes again. NS isnt WHs.
---
FC, what are cynos?
---
Right, and thats why your own CSM rep straight up states WHs are the safest place the game. And the most rewarding. Dont project shit dude.
---
Stay in your frigates. Let me know when you have actual modules to manage not just your guns and point then we can see if it requires skill.
---
Damn that should be enough to block any NSA Mircowaves being directed at you but a Satellite? I think they are just scared.
---
Shouldn't those groups who represent a lot of the games players have a way to get their desires given to the devs since keeping those large groups happy keeps players around.

I didn’t say anything about bombers. But if posed the question directly I would say no, and also that they don’t trade evenly against all ship classes. A bomber wing is fucking gold for anyone on a home defense fleet in an anti-support subcap. 
---
You do imply that you want a play style to go away. And it’s evident from your post that you want invaders to fuck off. Not sure I see you point here aside from trying to seem reasonable to both sides, which you don’t. 
---
The tears you constantly, and also tiringly, appeal to don’t exist. People leave when their play style is nerfed - not just krabs but also hunters. You don’t seem too concerned about that. I guess that’s fine but it’s also leading to hello kitty online on spaceships which is not healthy for a world that aspires to be meaningful.
---
Never said 20 was too far, I said it is annoying when you go 20 jumps and it's through dead space, it's just one of those things that's like why does there need to be 5k systems for around 20k people at any given time.  I think you would see a lot more fights on a much shorter time scale if everything was a little more compact.  There's no conflict of overcrowding because there is luxurious amounts of space for everyone (not to mention that each system itself can support so many people).

Blackout barely put a dent in titan production because Rorquals are among the ships least impacted by blackout.

---
You think there should never be overwhelming force, for that to happen it would require every ship to trade evenly with each other, or someone could bring a class of ship that overwhelms you and kills you or forces you off the field.
---
Again I never said that you can't hunt, and plenty of people did that before blackout. Just admit you aren't looking for a fight and just want kills. You know what happens when you roam into goon space and kill a krab but when you don't get the fight you think you deserve you whine to ccp to nerf their ability to escalate.
---
I also don't ask for hunters play style to be nerfed and stand by we need a middle ground between full and no local, this would actually buff hunters. Unfortunately most hunters screamed adapt or die when krabs were nerfed so I have limited amount of sympathy for them. Maybe we could have all sent ccp the same message during blackout saying hey this is to far but hunters wanted their paradise and didn't consider the cost. As for these tears not existing go find all the threads asking for a middle ground after blackout was announced to end. Most of those were made by someone who screamed adapt or die.
---
Not like this hasn't been posted already.

Yeah, I guess I would... I mean... I free-fly as close as possible around structures at times and spend my time ingame in other ways that do not generate any ISK. If I d feel like that d be fun for me at that time, why the F not? vOv
---
But now your side: Why is this precise question so important for you?
---
Good fighters should go where they like
---
You seem misguided and biased.
---
This was literally the brave MO for years until you went to legacy
---
It's not like the players help out that much in that area.  Make a new alt and shit around for a bit and the predatory recruitment begins.  Usually put to work mining to pay for the retard CEO's next hulk loss to code.
---
As long as the isk from those blackout regions were vastly increased to wormhole levels or near it, then that would be fine
---
I bet these were Bots
---
That would fit with the suggestion that 80% of the dev time was spent on the NPE
---
Because I personally would quit eve so quickly it would make your head spin if all that existed was krabbing and zero isk. It would be a mindnumbingly painful game to play with no point at all. I also don’t believe that you would do activities such as krabbing for zero
---
Isk. I think that the isk is why you partake in those activities. I was curious how you would defend krabbing for no isk, which I think is an absurd point of view.
---
That was cringy to read.

In other words you were playing the game like Brave did before they joined legacy to krab.

My question is for White Aero: what happened to Atlas alliance and Bobby? Those were the best years of eve for me.

so do they undock or do they just have someone haul their things to another station? how does it work?

Knowledge of have mechanics is a skill. Or a collection of them.

There are skills that are not motor skills. Kind of like how it's possible to be a skilled programmer or writer.

LOL, I thought the original issue was that the faucets were too big in  null sec.... now suddenly we need massively higher rewards to tempt people into actually taking the new insanely high risks brought about by blackout... Sounds like blackout un-balanced the risk v reward that already existed
---
Holy shit, I've never been this excited for salvaging!
---
They've lost the trust of most of the playerbase.  They have done absolutely NOTHING to regain this trust, if anything their lack of any coherent plan mixed with cyno changes has only made it worse.  The blackout itself was only a tiny part of a greater failure at CCP, and its alarming that they don't even realize this.
---
Same as anywhere. The paid positions were eliminated, but they tossed the title on to some other poor, overworked bastard along with a vague quarterly goal.
---
Do you have any statistics to back up your claim?

There were 4 trig scouts in Stacmon the other night jumping through the belts, that's not an invasion system. I was drunk, so I undocked a dual rep vexor into them and actually tanked them for a moment. I exploded spectacularly though.
---
Sounds like good experience for when you move out of highsec.
---
Sitting in system with a cloaked ship. Preferably a covert ops cloaked ship.
---
As long as there's player interaction and chat there will be RP. And even player interaction isn't a must have.
---
You're in the minority.  There's a reason any real business bends over backwards to keep customers, because it is nearly impossible to get back a customer after they feel they have been burned.
---
Same with local
---
Don't bother, use a cap battery Tengu instead. It's pretty easy to make one that tanks the neuts and still puts out like 800 dps. Use the rattle for supporting dps if you want, I guess.
---
If you die because of a cloaked hostile in your system, you're an idiot. Thats what local is for. With the blackout, cloaky campers didn't exist.
---
B-but 2 dozen means they can form like 9 of their "smallgang 360 noscope FPS I demand content NOOOW" retard-roams!
---
not even the point of discussion
---
No, they shouldn't because that will result in the game snowballing heavily in a particular style of plays direction ( or in other words how we ended up where we are today ).

Such a shame. With a revised structure, CCP could turn the AT into a league/series that every EVE pvp'er gets excited about, and translate that into viewership numbers in twitch, and get some new people interested in eve.
---
Proper esports companies are able to _make_ money off tournaments like this, hell all they'd have to do is get a couple of sponsors (EVE players have money - brands like that) and it'd pay for itself. Even add AT skins in the store, or copy what DOTA's doing for prizepool... So many ways to make a big esports tournament work given effort but they'd rather take the easy road.
---
Fade is still probably the largest recent brave has ever formed for stratops
---
New catch is just too krab infested
---
They did, supposedly CCP has been hiring and there's a community team again. I'm sure Fuzzmeister will be around to ~prove~ it shortly
---
PL grinding in Catch, horrible decision making, then BL in fountain to finish them off. The Brave that emerged from that had little of the old leadership and culture.

Or do them in high sec, rolling blackout zones that come with concord leaving system. Idk man, anything other than the half assed blackout we already got
---
Stop applying wh context to nullsec. You arent getting you super or rorqs dreadbombed in whs. There isnt a marshy / bombersbar with alts in a shitton oh wh systems.
---
Did you really expect them to be smart enough to not count market alts as "highsec players"?? This is CCP we are talking about here. They have "Fixed" the chat issues 4 times now and the channels are still fucked up with the same issues as before.
---
The issue is non-existence as long as your group is blue or has some agreement with pirat the moment you don't well guess what if any of the targets figure that out they pay pirat to blow up your structure and rip structure. 
---
Sure it's only like a couple of decs and a structure so like 800 millionish, but unless you have the volume read number of folks to make that up in ganks/extort your targets for it your unlikely to make that back making the whole operation well a money loser. 
---
Meaning if your not the biggest merc group on the bloc your best move is really to either get them blue or join them.
---
They announced last year when they failed to support the player run tournament like they promised that the issue was the guy who used to maintain the tools for tournaments was doing it on his own time previous and had since left the company and no one else knew how to do what he did. So it shouldn't really be a surprise they aren't going to bring it back, they already admitted they have no idea how to do it.

---
To what end? Seems awful boring.
---
Why because I think there should be a middle ground to the local question? Or because I have little sympathy who screamed adapt or die at people who didn't support the change? Or maybe because I understand when you attack someone in their home, they will bring everything to stop you? 
---
Which of these is a bias? Which is misguided? Or are you not equally as biased and from my point of view just as misguided?
---
Why did you switch to personal attacks instead of addressing the debate?
---
just turn them into a new type of drug like the existing learning boosters. Make them purchasable from the LP stores, they apply when you activate them, they last for a set period of time and getting podded doesn't remove them. Problem solved.
---
I'm fully aware that the ships in EVE are fucking massive, but I liked the idea of the Minmatar being an island dwelling empire and sailing the ocean on space ship looking crafts. 
---
I know how impractical all this is, but that doesn't matter in a game full of magic and gods.
---
Players left and recruiting declined. It says 6000 members, but there's maybe 250 active plus their alts.
---
All these people talking about how sad they are that their starter corp declined just need to look in the mirror to see why. Ya left ya bois. 
---
Pretty hard to take any mid-size fleets roaming through our space these days when half the people only krab and the other half is 10 people plus alts in Catch Standing and half of leadership is playing wow classic...

Eve Portal 2019 app should take care of this pointless reee.

Eve Vegas isn't happening sponsored by CCP next year. It'll be in San Diego as it was shared by Falcon on Eve Pulse. I believe Mittens is working to still make an "Eve Vegas" happen next year.
---
Well the cloaky camper originally showed up to kill someone. Chances are people saw an unknown or red show up in local and they warped to a safe or docked up. Then it becomes a game of waiting. Who can out wait the other? The problem is the cloaky guy can do what's called AFK cloak camping. He can essentially just sit there cloaked and go to work, make a sandwich, play a game, whatever. And the guys in system have to deal with his constant presence. They don't know if hes hunting or afk. If hes afk then they're sitting there doing nothing. If they think hes afk and go back to ratting but hes not afk, they die. Theres no way to deal with a cloaky camper (who may or may not be afk) but roll the dice. Or get friends I guess. 
---
At least that's how I understand it.

---
Not really, goons alone could take down any current alliance. I'm not even sure how a goons vs the world would turn out.
---
Maybe there could be a way to prevent this by outright removing the ability to commit actions that would - logically speaking - damage the stargate, like using Boson Fields and other DDs on it? If a titan or Keepstar is on the same grid, it can't use a DD. Justify the change as CONCORD patching a hole in their "keep capsuleers from destroying civilization" software that runs in the background of everything we do.
---
Another idea: Cynosural fields aren't the endpoint of a jump corridor, they're *beacons*. A ship doesn't *have* to lock onto a cyno unless it needs to get somewhere quickly. There's nothing stopping a capsuleer from calculating the jump themselves aside from the amount of time required making it more convenient to use a cyno. What if players could use a special kind of structure that would spend a week or so calculating the coordinates for a jump, then feed those coordinates to a Titan or Black Ops ship to open a jump corridor?
---
Who else thought of Waterworld seeing this?

You know me?

&gt; I've heard tell of there used to be Salvage Anomalies. I think systems that have a high number of wrecks made over the last hour should randomly spawn like a graveyard of wrecks from a massive battle that took place.
---
I've thought of something similar. We see all this wrecked/disabled/nonfunctional hardware at anomalies and in deadspace sites, why can't we salvage them or cut them up for scrap?
---
I feel we will see new Amarr Houses S. K. I. N. S.!!!
---
That is great!

I love lasers!!! Pew Pew!

That definitely got a raised eyebrow from me, and I'm usually one to give people the benefit of the doubt.
---
Actually, the skill list is a finite topological space since there is only a finite number of skills you can train - it cannot contain an infinite content by definition.
---
Hence CCP is lying.
---
I'll remove my tongue from my cheek now and go undock instead.

That's a big oof my dude :(

Maybe they should try to get someone from the Uni?

You fuck right off my logi.

Cassie Helio, CEO of PushX here

OP is spot on. This is why we have issues with public structures, even with the Citadel Deposit thing. If a courier contract has an assembled container in it, the only way to complete it is to do an in station trade with our hauler alt. We do not haul on out PushX toons because we would be war dec’d all the time and it keeps our haulers anonymous. 
---
If a contract has a container in it then the destination citadel can revoke its docking rights and there is no way for our PushX toon and hauler alt to dock and do an in station trade. 
---
If the citadel is the pickup, we can’t tell of there is a container in a contract until we accept it. So in order to be safe we’d need to have the PushX toon and the hauler docked in the citadel before we even accept it. Then if we do that and there is a container in the contract that’s a problem for us. If it’s a freighter size contract that makes it real dangerous. Gankers love to kill double wrap freighters. So this becomes a huge security risk and resources management issue. Resources being our haulers time to move all those contracts. 
---
I was in a focus group with CCP and there was talk of them flagging a courier contract that has a container in it before you accept it. It wouldn’t reveal any contents except that there is an assembled container inside. But that was 3 years ago so...
