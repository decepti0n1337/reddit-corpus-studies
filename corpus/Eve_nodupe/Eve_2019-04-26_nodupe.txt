I'm asking for what I think are very surgical nerfs which would mitigate their effectiveness in wormholes, where they present a significant problem to the combat ecosystem due to the limits in being able to stock capitals, and the lack of non-specific counters which can effectively engage it make it an incredibly effective eviction tool.

I salute you, sir. You have the right attitude for this game. We need more of your kind.
---

---
Jesus Christ I'm even a weirdo in EvE
---
Read up on moon ores, like loparite, what u make in highsec mining veldspar having to deal with people like CODE is not worth your time compared to how much you can make in null in the safety of an athanor.
---
Now if you don't like social stuff, u dont' have to mingle for a start, plenty of newbie corps out there like horde etc that let you do what you want basically until u feel comfortable.
---
k.
---
By eve standards.
---
I said I'd do my best to get a tournament to the people I invited, and I intend to keep that promise.
---
damn do you ever make genuine posts
---
Alright. For example:
---
&gt;how is blue scouting or neutral scouting different?
---
You can't get blue alts into groups that don't recruit. I have a feeling you are not as smart as you think you are.
---
If you weren't a total fucking retard you'd know that breaking an NDA can have actual factual repercussions for a lawyer.
---
He was named/shamed in the original post which means if his state has laws about disclosing these kind of things, he has to be reported to the bar association. Either by himself or another lawyer.
---
Oh and guess what, Texas has those laws.
---
Stop shoveling your own shit into your mouth for 10 seconds and do a quick google search.
---
Shuuuuuuuuuut the fuck up

You forgot this mentally unstable fucknugget

They weren't high profile people with intertwined irl and gaming personas who could claim irl damages.

Try the no stupid questions thread.
---
&gt;You can't get blue alts into groups that don't recruit. I have a feeling you are not as smart as you think you are.
---
ah yes, but you can get blue alts into 99% of groups out there, and groups that don't recruit wont ever get more people and will die out fairly quickly
---
Yea you left at the right time then. CCP has been a dumpster fire for years now.
---
This is just the diarrhea icing on the shit cake.
---
Nice portrait
---
Ok thank you!
---
If 'the best way he knows how' is to sound like an untrustworthy politician, I won't apologize for saying that that doesn't inspire me to trust him and that he probably should have considered not doing it that way.
---
If I had actually made a mistake or done something I felt I had to apologize for, I would. Not that I expect that to deter anyone, the pendulum is obviously swinging the other way right now. But if someone's going to bring up what I said, I'm going to explain why I said it.
---
In fact, go away forever thx
---
best week of my life
---
Chintilleresting
---
Bit of a silly question but.. Surely you travel back to highsec to sell your loot? I'm in nullsec but I go to highsec to sell
---
Or are there trading hubs in nullsec too?
---
Because skillfarm alts are real people
---
Sillychinteresting
---
Nope

Whats a good newbie drake fit for c1 wh anoms?

with this fit I can get around 200 dps and around 46,000 ehp
---
If you can't understand the difference I don't think you can ever understand this game.
---
[indeed](http://i.imgur.com/jVk69Qo.jpg)
---
Code is not really much of an issue.  He lost more than you did to gank you.  Its a rare occurrence to run into one.  Best is to just not reply to them at all and ignore.
---
It would be interesting to know what was their millionth kill. I wonder if there's any way to easily get that sort of thing from zkill?
---
oh there is a difference in reality, but hardly in functionality
---
That was hard to reread, you need to edit and throw in some punctuation and what not - no offense.
---
If you want to be that way, then I'd say that a JDCV Jump Capable ship can go even faster, depending on how long it takes the server to load.

That would be cool, maybe TEST could pitch in and buy them a lucky 1 millionth customer prize (-:

Ishkur is awesome
---
Hey, if you set home station at Period Basis and got podded somewhere Tenal, the you traveled through the entire universe instantly!
---
yeah idk bots are super safe and will be as long as local exists
---
what a dogshit sticky
---
Most established nullsec groups have their own trade hubs.
---
Awh, did I piss you off? Poor baby.
---
My argument was that all the mechanics and ways to abuse them have made HS wardecs waste of time to deal with for majority of players for years. Theres only been 5 groups left who have had those turbonerds doing it. 
---
Now that some of it is fixed it might be bit more interesting. But they still has major issues which make pvp in other parts of eve more worth it.
---
No matter how victimized you feel because of your experiences, it can often times be prudent to limit with whom you associate.
---
sir i am a wormholer and i only have 36 corpses and 13 Mongolian slaves in my basement
---
praxis ftw
---
Since I'm already looking at zkill, here's the top 10 ships used by all 3 alliances that have reached 1 million kills on zkill.
---
Special callout to TEST who have the Capsule at number 7 on their list.

---
Give me a fucking break
---
I think the low alpha of eagles give a much wider window to activate adcs. While a fleet of muninns just erase an eagle if the eagle pilot does not stay on the ball.
---
My theory is make rats in null drop blue loot that has to be sold in lowsec. Won't solve the problem but will help I think.
---
Hi Garth
---
2-3-4 all ways depends
---
1 Scout which you move off or use for Tackle when you land your self U Fleet
---
Sabre works nice with the scout
---
3+ Proteus close and hit fire
---
try not to dual box 2 Self Repping Cruisers like the Orthus, thats hard, one will all ways get caught
---
If its 2-4 Caracal's same orbit or approach and fire.
---
I now have 4 Perfect Proteus and it scares the shit out of people when you land 4 of them at 0. the problem with this is that if they don't run your going to die as they have friends so reseach who your're landing on lol
---
Sort... of? 
---
Its less a matter of 'less advanced' and more of a matter of that an _Emperor_ class Battleship takes decades to build, even if its done with modern proccesses and proceedures. Now, you can have your Battleship yards handle that and those are few and far between. On your 'average' industrialized world, your yards can churn out the ever useful Lunar class Cruisers and lighter hulls in a matter of years and that's without doing silly things like a 100k void suited slaves pulling a keel into position. 
---
The Glorianas were Mars' gifts to the Primarchs and _not_ standard issue.
---
In order for brisc to successfully sue, he'd have to prove they acted with Malicious Intent.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_figure
---
Entertainingly, him being a RL public figure is actually what might save CCP from an actual successful lawsuit.
---
&gt;CCP have possibly damaged someone's real-life career 
---
I guarantee you that the real world doesn't care about a video game. I know this because I've left the house and been there.
---
[Wheeee!](https://i.imgur.com/pzWjsqr.gif)
---
Yeah, they come up all the time. I just ignore them, I doubt they’re even legit bots, they probably just give you a virus
---
They are frat renters after all
---
the differences in those lists is really interesting. Sabre appears to be king, stiletto is also apparently a serious killer, hound too. But then, differences!
---
It really shows what the favored fleet comps are.
---
If you just wanna fool around a 50mn punisher is very cheap to fit up.
---
Care to show me a few good fits for the drake?
---
Blaster rokh sit on a gate wait for a frigate fleet to tbink your rail fit
---
&gt;damn do you ever make genuine postsq
---
Well there’s already that ECM burst thing. Problem is there’s no slot for it on a freighter. Plus bumping doesn’t give aggression so you’ll get concorded.
---
your idea does nothing to fix it, help it, and is based on a bullshit premise
---
Capital ship, any.
---
Cyno at the center of a sun.
---
Bounce.
---
Congratz, you achieved faster than light speed without warp tech.
---
where’d you find that nebula-lookin thing?
---
Oh, ok. I've never seen one before.
---
This is my favorite thread so far
---
If you look down the list even further there's a whole bunch of other stuff that is also really interesting. PL is the only group with a battleship inside the top 20 with the Mach at 10. The next closest is TEST with the Mael at rank 21. 
---
The first BS to appear for Goons is also the Maelstrom, but it doesn't appear until rank 41. 
---
PL and Goons both have the Nyx as their most used Super, both inside the top 50, TEST's most used super is the Nyx, but it doesn't make an appearance until rank 58.
---
removing local would hurt real players more than bots
---
Honestly i dont remember. I was flying through a nullsec system when i saw it and thought it looked pretty.
---
"But they are goon pets. They are bad so they have to be guilty..."
---
 fixed that for you
---
Couldn't have happened to a better dude.
---
Witch Hunt! No corruption, no collusion! Who will investigate CCP???
---
LOL, pathetic.
---
E) invest in tinfoil
---
You sound like a fucking autist
---
He mentioned 'nerf' which wasn't in the title, so he either read it or you're not talking about nerfs
---
And nothing of value was lost, lol.
---
BEE!
---
Depends who you ask. If you ask the wardeccers then they don't want any changes that will make them lose ships/assets more often. 
---
And my premise is based on actual statistics. Yours is based on some nerd fantasy of being a baddass virtual space pirate.
---
TEST capsules are no joke
---
Damn propaganda level went so down. 
---
Throwing random numbers especially the ships loss math xD
---
COINS, is the rental alliance of Fraternity, like Fuel Blocks for legacy or Rate my ticks for Panfam. 
---
So its multiple corporations that are not specifically related to each others. so adding those numbers doesnt make you a genious, it just shows how stupid you are. 
---
You want some awesome numbers ? cuz i can tell you for a fact that those numbers are rookie numbers compared to KWG for example. those SB machs and Gila's make a load of money :D
---
Pinged him 15+ times in elysium. It's the only way /u/Jibrish tries to get someones attention.
---
Get your ass to nullsec.  
---
I think basically every major block has some kind of newbro program now, and any of them are going to produce a far better gaming experience than chewing on veldspar in 0.8.
---
Interesting position to take.  We have a keepstar there, and your superfleet ran home the moment you extracted.  Your side chose to stay logged out after the node crash, thats totally what victors who control the grid do right?  Our losses were mainly in insured dreads versus your supers lost, your dreads dropped onto your own titan blob to act defensively against our dreads.  We were just finishing the last few tri faxes when the node died, had that not happened we were getting ready to dunk on their supers.  So..
---
If you want to say the node crash saved your ass go ahead, but victory?  Thats fucking rich. :)
---
thanks for the shiny!
---
This is the kind of material you can show your kids as an example of how to not be a half decent human being.
---
idk about the mails. i don't even know much about the lore. but i have it on good authority that the new playable race that capsuleers will be able to side with in the (upcoming?) trig vs sleeper conflict will in fact be the sleepers and not triglavians.
---
enjoy an actual dank leak. feel free to set a reminder or whatever :)
---
CCP needs to refund every rorqual lost during the downtime.
---
I can't give this more than 1 updoot, but it deserves 100,000,000
---
Haber for csm
---
Yeah that's actually really cool. But they need to be really strong or have some inter-star-system weapon otherwise they won't be used.
---
What's the best way to catch Interceptors when camping a gate in nullsec? I always seem to get to 0.1 seconds until I lock him but they always warp out.
---
If I get a ridiculous sensor resolution like 2000 will I be able to lock them fast enough?
---
And is it even worth it if it's in hostile space because I will have 0 tank?
---
We are in a group of 5-10
---
'hurt'
---
it would help real players, as docking up whenever an enemy is ever able to initiate pvp on you is dogshit game design
---
I’ve gotten an abyssal 50mn mwd claw 17km/s fitting is tight but you can add a small cap booster as well this is before boosts and wormhole and only mid grade snakes. So a lot of room for improvement
---
&gt;Depends who you ask. If you ask the wardeccers then they don't want any changes that will make them lose ships/assets more often.
---
it's just a boring dogshit gamey non-sandbox change
---
&gt;And my premise is based on actual statistics. 
---
citing random statistics without valid reasoning or understanding is pointless, you've given up all your arguments and failed to defend any of them
---
Stunt was cancer he deserved to be banned.
---
The same shit people got mad at Vily at for saying he said 10x worse every other sentence.
---
They’re not called Winmatar for nothing, off that graphic. If you train any other race first you’re either a Jita trader or doing it wrong.
---
&gt;you've given up all your arguments and failed to defend any of them
---
Same to you.
---
It’s heavily redacted!
---
*~ only 5% is redacted ~*
---
A 30 second local delay is all we need. Turn bots into killfarms.
---
Let the slaughter begin.
---
Nice. Well I hope you enjoy the fit dude.
---
Thank you for the reply. I’m sorry that happened to you, I have been playing for a long time and I would be pissed if something like that happened to me. You handled the issue with class.
---
(By the way, I’m not “white knighting”, it’s called being a human being to another human being)
---
Hahaha what a crock of bullshit.
---
I love that feeling
---
I have and always love the stabber, it's a frigate disguised as a cruiser but I still like it due to being able to use missiles and autocannons. You can surprise a few people or pull off tackle frigs quickly
---
Next thing he'll say the water is turning frogs gay
---
There are bots in every alliance and every region of null.
---
Until CCP puts a solution in that makes these guys vulnerable to sustainable gameplay resolutions (for example, a 30 second local delay would turn bots into killfarms), it's just going to keep on going.
---
&gt;WAAAWAAA CCP no give me free dank frags
---
Yes, it takes character to be threatened by lawsuit to actually do a proper investigation...... And then reward them.
---
neat!
---
@u/CCP\_Falcon 
---
So riddle me me this? Who was the CCP bitch Dev that ran with this without checking internally? Good luck with dealing with the A-10 that is K-Street, CCP is about to find out what it is to be truly hot dropped...
---
You're a baboon!  You should be going ape over it!
---
Know thy enemy.
---
Agreed. If you watch one stream you can tell thats how he says idiots because he has an accent.
---
Hey Ho Peligro must go
---
Hard to be a pet when you have 10k members eh?
---
Can confirm. We went to Harry Potter world and he was the big spoon one night. Have pics to confirm
---
Where you press f1 of course.
---
I cant wait to hear what Moomin has to say about this....
---
Your reasoning is terrible, it sounds to me like you're just trying to cover your own initial response to the situation with a defensive explanation of how it "could have been true," rather than looking at both the facts and lack thereof.
---
In the position of the three whom were banned, what do you think your stance would have been if it were you? Oh, wait, I'm pretty sure what it would have been: The Olmecca rage quotient would've risen to all new heights.
---
How about you just leave it where it is and stop theory crafting some nonsense to make yourself and others who jumped on the judgement train with garbage information and ran with it?
---
I've been having a huge blast with solo exploration. Wormhole and null mainly in a T1 heron.
---
I'd like to upship so I can run combat sites, sleeper sites and salvage after. As well as doing the relic/data sites.
---
What ship should I be looking at?
---
I would have gone with "underhanded".  We'll just gave to wait the judges call.
---
Watching Matlock reruns. That's what I'm doing at least...
---
You need to move to Iceland or Ireland or UK and have a fast internet connection, so that your lock can land in time.
---
I appreciated this post.
---
It made me smile.
---
Keep a backup fitted venture in the same system and when they gank you immediately get in it loot their wreck and start mining again. Better yet warp out if they don't have enough points on you after they engage. If you really must stay in high sec and want to use a barge use a procurer/skiff. They want you to fly the less tanky ones, don't do what they want you to do. The passive salt you mine from just showing up on dscan in an orca/skiff/proc is massive they just don't say anything about it.
---
A trilitium torpedo is 2m long or less and can destroy a star system
---
You god damn right they did, I can't wait for the meta show on sat.
---
Vote brigading? [No sir not on this sub](https://imgur.com/sohWhy9)
---
You were wrong lmao
---
 I cant wait to hear what Moomin has to say about this....
---
An astero would work well for many normal combat sites.
---
Not too familiar with WH sites, but a Stratios might be able to tank them, if not an exploration fit T3C would do the job.
---
Smartbombs.
---
This aged poorly
---
Briscghanzi investigation come to a close. Glad it turned out this way.
---
Uh ohhhhh this sure aged badly
---
Nice
---
I use light mode on reddit is fun because I can't see the post I've read with dark mode. Not messed with it to see if can add to contrast.

I'm fairly sure it's this goon shuttle
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76309103/

It's fairly easy to check since zkill pages are 50 each. Just divide by 50, go to that page, and count down the remainder

i remember you, your eve streams were some of the weirdest i've ever seen.

didn't you used to ramble on about bullshit conspiracies and ban anyone who basically said anything
---
I think it might be closer than you think.  Pandemic Horde is nearly double the past 90 day kills of NC and is 332k from 1m while NC is 173k away.
---
Nearly 25% of hordes kills have come in past 90 days.
---
There are a couple of posts you can expect following anything that’s considered news on this subreddit. A Wallymarts shitpost, a Stainguy shitpost sometimes good post, and an Olmeca Serious post. These have their merits in their own rights, regardless if you care for them or not. 
---
Now, every once in awhile; the Angels descend from the heavens and deliver upon us unworthy beings, a cultural breakthrough, a transcendence into the next age of mankind if you will, a NazAlGhul post. You can’t rush these, you can’t demand them. They just happen.

All we can do is pray. 1 upvote = 1 prayer 🙏

For combat/sleeper sites, I think a praxis is good.

For pirate relic sites, astero.

Don't try to do both at once, ships in eve can be fit to do one thing very well, but if you start multitasking they usually end up sucking at both
---
How many fathoms in a league?
---
You do understand what minutes are?
---
I'm guessing no based on your comment. The minutes are what happened in an official meeting. The tip probably did not come during a meeting. So therefore, would never be in the minutes.

What’s the best cruiser platform for dunking a triple-nos/neut Stratios with a 300 sos omni tank?  Can it be done with a brawler, or am I going to have to hop in to an orthrus or cynabal or something else that can kite and control distance?
---
Yeah that's him.
---
me too
---
Will see who gets 4th.  Might be a tighter race than you think.
---
NC is currently at 827k while PH is 5th at 668k.  173k vs. 332k.
---
Right now PH is 2nd at 60k/90 days while NC is 5th at 32.4k/90days
---
6th all time (AAA) is an obvious non-factor.
---
INIT and TNT are both top 10 in alltime and recent, but are under hordes total and a far cry from their monthly totals.
---
Shut up white role

Wormholer btw

Except you didn't.

vov reread the thread then retard
---
imagine thinking real humans are capable of flawless intel networks.  
---
also imagine being mad that finding targets that aren't made to shoot back is harder.

ever tried to engage in pvp that isn't onesided globster?

Alright I'm starting to feel like you are actual idiot but here we go:
---
&gt;and groups that don't recruit wont ever get more people and will die out fairly quickly 
---
Did you know that pvp groups often restrict recruiting with vouch-only or closing recruiting for certain amount of time to avoid awoxing/blue scouting?
---
What else did you "refute"? Can't fucking bother anymore with a retard like you. There is a valid reason why everyone thinks highsec wardec players are the lowest thrash tier in Eve. I hope some nullblobbers just keep killing all your citadels and you quit the game.
---
I've been mining belts on and (mostly) off for years but I've never had visions sent by god.
---
Prophet muhammed stopped making people mine asteroid belts long ago.
---
T3C is a bit of a train. Could go in a T3D today, would that be any good?
---
&gt;imagine thinking real humans are capable of flawless intel networks.
---
1a. something doesn't need to be flawless to be broken. thinking this is retarded.
---
1b. 3rd party programs that can ping you and autofocus a client for you to warp out adds a non human element that basically makes it on the level of bots
---
2. thinking bots can operate better with local removed is retarded.
---
3. just because local is removed, doesn't mean payouts can't be increased or other things can't be added in. I'm not saying "only remove local" i'm just saying that currently, removing local is overall much more positive than the status quo.
---
&gt;also imagine being mad that finding targets that aren't made to shoot back is harder.
---
it's not my fault they fit their ships so they can't shoot back, or fly ships that can't.
---
just because people make retarded decisions doesn't mean that the game is balanced or that those retarded decisions should be buffed to make up for stupidity.
---
&gt;ever tried to engage in pvp that isn't onesided globster?
---
wew we're already there aren't we?
---
the VAST majority of eve online kills are one sided, and most of the ones that aren't are usually fought from the perception that it is.
---
I'm not here to honorably 1v1 people at the sun, or have 5v5 dota matches, i'm here to damage peoples in game space ship assets and have fun. There is no fun is destroying something someone could care less about losing, there is no weight in that kind of fight. I much prefer to destroy things people don't want to lose and will fight to defend.

Doom is a bitch lmao

Hmmm, yup, sounds legit.

I know you can get a 50mn fessor to go pretty quick without breaking the bank

Just judging from what I see people doing, relics. I think sleepers are only better if you live in a wormhole and have pretty good skills, and maybe an alt to dualbox
---
Gottem
---
I think it's cloud ring
---
&gt; Did you know that pvp groups often restrict recruiting with vouch-only or closing recruiting for certain amount of time to avoid awoxing/blue scouting?
---
did you know that groups are blue to people?
---
&gt;What else did you "refute"? Can't fucking bother anymore with a retard like you. There is a valid reason why everyone thinks highsec wardec players are the lowest thrash tier in Eve. I hope some nullblobbers just keep killing all your citadels and you quit the game.
---
ah, you finally lost it after being shown you lost the argument
---
rager alert lmao
---
Sort and Killah are to obvious, it was Jin'taan

No man can escape the Emperor's Justice.
---
People are still going to say that even though he has been exonerated, he's guilty. Just like Rusdiagate.
---
The ban wasn’t the issue.
---
Why the CSM resignation?  CCP hint that having you physically in the office might not be a good thing?
---
Hey, as another rape survivor as a child orpheus381 feel free to pm if you need to talk.  We are survivors and what was done to us as children doesn't define us our take away from us.  If anthing if makes us stronger.  
---
Please be strong orpheus381, life can be beautiful in dark times.
---
It was probably at the direction of Hilmar.
---
so at least we agree on the point people who play by the rules have it harder and thus can be hunted easier.
---
bots can adapt to the removal of local much better. botters having alt accounts at gates to detect whats coming in is something that is already done for years. do you wanna remove gates too maybe? or maybe make them move around in the system and change their destination every few hours. wait a second.... maybe you should try hunting in wormholes, sound like you cup of tea.
---
   
---
ships for pve are fit differently than ships for pvp. fitting according to purpose isn't retarded, it's a perfectly normal thing to do.
---
so in short: you ask for the game being changed in order to fit your personal playstyle. you want people to adapt to an enviroment that you want to be changed to make the game easy to you. sounds kind of ironic, doesn't it?
---
We did that the last time we were there and I have a great photo of her with this “we waited in line for that?” look on her face.
---
I was asking for it. Dressing all sexy.
---
&gt;did you know that groups are blue to people?
---
Does not work 100% of time. In highsec it's extremely easy to use neutral alts.
---
&gt;being shown you lost the argument
---
I still didn't lose a single argument. You have problems with fantasy and reality.
---
It was at that moment that I had an idea of what happened - why this was clearly a mistake. I haven’t breached the NDA or leaked confidential CCP information, period.
---
You don't know me foo!
---
How do I petition to get the karma i lost back, from when saying CCP's initial press release/reaction was heavy handed.
---
*his tinfoil level!, It's over 9000!!!*
---
Thanks IPX!
---
my client would 100% believe I was looking at spreadsheets allday, outlook and they might go "WTF, you never check your emails!"
---
I would love that CCP spend some real Dev time to properly build some tournament support tools.   My observation is a noticeable portion of the customer base would support this as well.   What's so difficult for CCP to understand that EVE needs every bit of exposure it can get?
---
A lot of victims have that perception put on them that they are the reason it happened. You should have been able to dress however you wanted orpheus381, however it appears you are still coping with what occurred... Let me know in PM if you need any help finding resources.
---
Are there even profitable belt rats any more? I've been back a year and with all the anomaly sites I forgot that belt rats where even a thing.
---
Yes!
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
nah CEO's are not normally hands on unless shit hits the press
---
I'm not the fucking loser going back to reply to shit over 2 weeks old.
---
I mean if someone brings a specific comp, you should need to also bring a specific comp to counter it, right?
---
If someone seeds Boosh ravens to counter a standard doctrine why shouldn't they have an advantage?
---
correct, most of them aren't, but some of them can be...just looking to have a little fun.
---
I'm slowly working my way through fittings for the ones that look like they can...just wanted to see if anyone knew ones off the top of their head.
---
That never happened.
---
&gt;so at least we agree on the point people who play by the rules have it harder and thus can be hunted easier.
---
yes, generally cheaters do have an advantage
---
&gt;bots can adapt to the removal of local much better. botters having alt accounts at gates to detect whats coming in is something that is already done for years. do you wanna remove gates too maybe? or maybe make them move around in the system and change their destination every few hours. wait a second.... maybe you should try hunting in wormholes, sound like your cup of tea.
---
You seem to forget that cynos exist, and blops can bring in and remove people from systems. If a bot sees someone enter the system, and they bridge out, the bots have no idea, and will either
---
1) never farm again
---
or 
---
2) farm when there could potentially be hostiles in system
---
pick one.
---
&gt;ships for pve are fit differently than ships for pvp. fitting according to purpose isn't retarded, it's a perfectly normal thing to do.
---
yes if you're going for maximum isk/hr, if you fit more tank, a tackle module, and have people willing to group up when solo hunters or small gang hunters come in you'll have
---
1) content
---
and
---
2) meaningful pve
---
&gt;so in short: you ask for the game being changed in order to fit your personal playstyle. you want people to adapt to an enviroment that you want to be changed to make the game easy to you. sounds kind of ironic, doesn't it?
---
my change massively decreases the effectiveness of bots (this is factual)
---
my change increases the pvp content in the game (factual)
---
what's hard to get?
---
&gt;Does not work 100% of time. In highsec it's extremely easy to use neutral alts.
---
so your entire argument on why highsec wardecs are broken is "neutral alts are easier to get than blue alts"
---
you're retarded.
---
&gt;I still didn't lose a single argument. You have problems with fantasy and reality.
---
when you are refuted, you drop the point and pretend it never happened. this is delusion.
---
I can't read these kinds of comments any more without hearing the Shia Leboeuf song.
---
Paladin is fun. No one ever expects it to be fit for PVP. Even zkill is like "are you sure you meant to do that?!"
---
&gt;so your entire argument on why highsec wardecs are broken is "neutral alts are easier to get than blue alts"
---
No.
---
&gt;My argument was that all the mechanics and ways to abuse them have made HS wardecs waste of time to deal with for majority of players for years. Theres only been 5 groups left who have had those turbonerds doing it.
---
&gt; you're retarded.
---
I think you might actually be.
---
&gt;you have dropped every point
---
No I haven't.
---
&gt;reddit is full of the dumbest motherfuckers and shitty gaslighters i swear
---

Well, it turns out CCP doesn't use common sense and use lawyers when dealing with real-life contracts. Whowoulldathought
---
This is a public relations disaster for CCP and no matter how they spin it, it is (should be) on Falcon.
---
Where the admins of the 3rd party app doxxed Stunt in order to deepen the brown shading on their nose.
---
WAT?
---
Happens all of the time. Even EasyAntiCheat gives false positives
---
Have you no eye for aesthetics, man?
---
Yeah he seemed like a pretty chill bloke IRL when I met him. Same with PGL... asshat in game but hilarious asshat IRL ;)
---
Has your NDA expired yet? When are you writing your memoirs?
---
If I remember correctly it was because someone close to Brisc sold off a Molok before the fax nerf.
---
I might be wrong though.
---
CCP claimed the CSM as a body raised this to them and that they discussed it with the other members before acting.
---
According to the CSM whitepaper (CCP's rulebook for the CSM and how it should function.)  all the meetings and official inter Dev /CSM interactions are recorded so yes by CCP's own rules on how the CSM is supposed to operate any discussion they had with the CSM about then ban and the information they supplied should be available in minute form very easily.
---
CCP clueless? I find that hard to believe...oh wait not really.
---
yikes
---
One other possible solution is extending the lock and weapons range on some ships, especially ships like titans and dreads. It would make sense for dreadnoughts to be able to out-range battleships. That 300km range limit honestly seems a bit like a leftover limit from back when grids were small. 
---
I imagine that it would have quite an effect on the meta, but I think it might be quite worth it after some other changes.
---
Fly a tanked Procurer as soon as you can. PM William Savior in game and I'll give you one.
---
I'll take it
---
&gt; However, I would not want to vote for someone that would not have the courage of their convictions to challenge me to my face if something didn't look good.
---
That's the exact opposite thing you'd do in this situation. It isn't a ballsy tough-guy move, it's giving them suspicion to hide any available evidence.
---
ok, i'll pick: set up shop in small systems and place a bunch of alts in a network that provides proper dscan coverage. jumping while cloaked is kinda hard. ofcourse that system isn't resistant to errors because of deep saves, but effective enough. and combat recons can neither be bridged by a blops nor use covert cynos so against these the gte coverage still works. (before you come with that: yes ofc you could log out one of these in every system, but we already know how bots go about this stuff now, don't we? just resume after some time. if you're lucky you get a lone vni now and then, hooray)
---
there surely are many more solutions but i'm not a botter so i can't be arsed to think about them.
---
______________________________________________________
---
1 - people who are trying to make money are usually not trying to get "content" in that moment.
---
2 - what the fuck is meaningful pve supposed to be? the only meaning my pve personal ever had was getting money for pvp ships. 
---
your change fucks over bots at first and even more fucks over people who don't bot effectively, this is factual yes.
---
your change increases pvp content that only a handfull of people is asking for and most don't want, that is factual yes.  
---
the only thing that is hard to get is why you so desperately try to take bots as an excuse to ask for changes while not thinking further than your own nosetip in that regard. you won't get this either way.
---
The better options would be LR turret platforms like Rokhs and Nagas (maybe even Machariels). Otherwise both raven fleets can just boosh away and effective outrun each other’s missiles.
---
1. Add CODE. as Negative 10 in your contacts and dock up if they're actively killing in your system. 
---
2. Scout yourself
---
3. Don't AFK in highsec
---
4. Don't provide salt
---
5. Don't speak Hieroglyphics (Russian Insults) at me!
---
Grats test. Keep it up. More powah!

If stunt was to ever be unbanned, now is the time.
---
classic BO-LD

Man I would feel smug as shit right now if I were you. The shit thrown at you on the day the ban was announced was beyond fucking horrid. This community not only attacked your character, but career, and took every cheap pot shot imaginable while you were blind sided.
---
Here comes the vni nerfs again 😵
---
thank u naz, very cool
---
I could ask you if you'd ever post without exposing your massive victim complex, but I know that would be fruitless.
---
Like put them on the shelf collectables or actually fly them?
---
So it was actually you who lost all points and arguments. Cool conversation.

Research ultralocking.

It went well beyond "fuck that guy"

Lol of course :)

If you don't want to move to Null, you can scout out some really dead space in hi-sec to mine in.  A lot of 0.5 systems or "islands" which are hi-sec areas surrounded by low-sec systems are dead.  The system I used to mine in I would rarely ever see anyone in.  Usually it was just people popping in from a wormhole.
---
but he banned 7 bots in Q1 of this year /s
---
Stratios dank ratting.
---
It was a Hard Knocks twist the knife revenge psyop. They've been planting members in the CSM for over a year.
---
Iirc it was for dev impersonation which was/is covered in 3rd party apps.
---
He was previously banned for other stuff and CCP was probably just sick of his shit.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tgKkcHo.gif
---
It can be painful at first but it opens a lot of new possibilities. You can either get your alt into something that helps your main, take on 2 completely different roles or just meme it up with something more interesting.
---
hi grath
---
if it really was just because you sold a molok then everyone involved are the dumbest people ever.
---
hey cool. you got Claws nerfed because you hated combat cepters and spent a year getting CCP to fucked them over to the point they aren't even used at all. They were the most effective counter to a boosh doctrine by probing and warping an entire Claw wing, pinning down booshers and vaporizing them ... and now you're wanting boosh fleets 'fixed'? You literally fucked yourself over. I'll never forgive you for getting combat cepters nerfed. Ever. Ever. /u/jintaan

" Dear Citizens of New Eden,

Following on from our statement on April 26th, we have completed our review of the \_dumbledore\_ investigation and determined that our initial findings were incorrect. \_dumbledore\_ did not bet ISK in illegal gambling to obtain an in-game advantage."

Ever.

481 days NC  
---
498 days PH
---
I miss the old avatars so much. They had so much more character than the ones we have now.
---
I hate to rub it in, but..
---
But if that happened to you, would you come back to the game even if you were unbanned?  I know I wouldn't.
---
\-dabs-

&lt;3 Jin. Still super hyped. Can’t wait to shoot gons. Disappointed that it won’t be streamed but that isn’t your fault. Thanks for organizing this. 
---
Grr CCP
---
&gt; a single load of ore pays triple for my ship
---
this is exactly the right response. replacement tank is still tank. 
---
if instead you reduce your yield, to have more buffer by fitting armour modules, you gank yourself every hour you mine.
---
either sell to local nullsec manufacturers or export to jita using your groups jump freighter service. dont haul with your main as your alliance will be wardecced by highsec griefers . worst case you haul with your own out of corp alt, but return for time on that is likely terrible.
---
i understand it might be a bit confusing for you
---
unlike rorqual mining, running a pvp (scary, but bare with me) tournament requires more than just the bare minimum of attention
---
especially when ccp doesn't let us use the tournament tool
---
I RMT'd 2.9 trillion isk on my way out of the game last year, over the course of 2 months, and not one of my accounts is banned.
---
nice projection
---
:joy:
---
No, it was not "as a body". It was one or two people. I say this because the original announcement caught most CSM members by surprise, they had as much clue about what was going on as the rest of us.
---
&gt;damn do you ever make genuine posts
---
the eve way would be to infiltrate them, gain roles and steal anything that isn't nailed down. but they probably know they are a target for this and are set up pretty safely.
---
I'm kind of amazed how bipolar this sub is. It jumps from Init Man bad to PL guy bad seemingly monthly. And I'm an Init guy and it's apparently not our turn this month.
---
Give Doom a break, sure he got it wrong, so did plenty of people. Everyone does. And he's not a shitter, he is pretty cool in-game. Not Elise Randolph cool, but he's alright.
---
Sorry I had to.. no hard feelings yeah?
---
Imperium Easter, every April 25th, Brisc Fleet (bourbon mandatory). Fantastic.
---
Somebody better ping quick

I mean I've got some "hard feelings" a little lower down about how special I am to people now
---
But muh threas brigade
---
&gt;victim victim victim victim victim victim
---
I'm definitely not going to recant what I said. I would never put blind faith into someone that has anything remotely to do with the American political system. What gets me is all the people in this thread extolling his virtues when mere days ago they were the same people shitting all over him. Nothing I said shit on Brisc personally, and I even wrote that he was the most active and responsive CSM in another comment. If you want to count me in on some fake wall of shame, feel free I suppose, doesn't make me feel any different about what I said.
---
 "MITTENS TAKE THE WHEEL!"   
---
LOL love it!
---
&gt; but effective enough.
---
you can't differentiate between people jumping out and cloaking up via dscan. that entire paragraph is nonsense.
---
it'll take dozens of bots just to achieve nothing
---
&gt;1 - people who are trying to make money are usually not trying to get "content" in that moment.
---
imagine a world with meaningful pve that interacts with pvp!
---
&gt;2 - what the fuck is meaningful pve supposed to be? the only meaning my pve personal ever had was getting money for pvp ships.
---
one where you're rewarded for succeeding and people want to try and stop you, lmao, not just simply afking in a site and docking up when ANYONE THREATENING comes within a jump of you
---
&gt;your change fucks over bots at first and even more fucks over people who don't bot effectively, this is factual yes.
---
what does this even mean? of course it fucks over bots retard
---
&gt;your change increases pvp content that only a handfull of people is asking for and most don't want, that is factual yes.
---
yes, the point of introducing non-consensual pvp
---
&gt;the only thing that is hard to get is why you so desperately try to take bots as an excuse to ask for changes while not thinking further than your own nosetip in that regard. you won't get this change either way.
---
i'm using both reasons, hth
---
Believe me dude, you were one of many who got this wrong, you're not special. Reddit jumps on the lynchmob bandwagon against everyone in a sizable alliance when it's their turn. It seems to be PL hate month for this cycle, and Init is now the super cool dude again. Tbh I don't know whether I should hate the bipolarity or just embrace it.
---
ISKWAR: WON ☒
---
OBJECTIVE: WON ☒
---
KEEPSTAR: DESTROYED ☒
---
TRAPPED: ☐ This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
Why has God abandoned us
---
ah yes, bringing up the multiple times i was wrongfully banned by CCP when directly answering a question is playing the victim
---
for being so quick to call people mentally ill you sure do check many of those boxes my dude
---
What if I told you PL and INIT are shit
---
H E R E S Y

Man, every time I see someone mention a new Naz post in jabber is the only time I come onto this god awful website.

It is a great read and I loved the analogy.

how far is WH space from Period Basis?
---
Love you too! And never stop posting here or anywhere always post all the time
---
How/why do you know...?
---
Was at the PL dinner at the Braziliam steakhouse. Ron was pretty cool, Doom was just douchey. I dunno, it was just my perception of him from that evening.
---
For someone willing to lecture him there about "taking things out of game" your posts ITT are pretty special too.
---
The problem with trying to shield tank Amarr ships is that their base armor is significantly higher than their base shields. You'll just get more mileage out of armor tanking them, fitting for armor resists gives you more ehp than fitting for shield resists, armor rigs are more beneficial than shield rigs, etc.
---
Replied to pgl but he was pretty douchey at the PL dinner. Just the way he came off. Ron Mexxico was  pretty cool tho.
---
Naz as always :)
---
Ah, good to be in the presence of the true Decepticon leader.
---
Well I kind of blacked out at that dinner because I had fasted for 24 hours in preparation for unlimited meat and then had a bottle of wine at the bar before we were seated so I uhhh... can't really judge

How many other people have CCP banned unjustly, that didnt get investigated.

was hopeing to see the talwar in at least one of the top 10

You already know where this is gonna go.
---
Why even Google search it man? Just opens the door for suspicion
---
trigs not being heavily used?
---
wha?
---
you have obviously not seen incursions, some wh groups,  or any nullsec group structure bashing.

remind me in 11 months

Dude, tell me about it /u/Agent_Orange7. I'm still banned despite not doing anything.

np habibi

Nice read.
---
&gt; I know that that Triglavian ships are not being used to heavily by capsuleers
---
you know nothing...
---
i mean.. having and using are two different things...
---
&gt;I know that that Triglavian ships are not being used to heavily by capsuleers and I have an interesting idea that could make them more viable.
---
What are you talking about? The Drek and Kikimora are both in the top 10 ships used in the last 7 and 90 day stats.

Eh, it wasn't drunk Doom (drunk Doom was actually pretty cool). Like I said, it was/is my perception of him and until we both meet again, it's going to stay thay way.
---
however to jump out they'll need a blops. behind every bot theres a programmer that can add in behaviour patterns according to the situations to maximize income / minimize losses. just add in a pattern for blops showing up. that aside a bot can react much faster to someone suddenly decloaking on grid than a human ever could.
---
 &gt; it'll take dozens of bots just to achieve nothing  
---
make it hundreds, who cares. keyword alpha clones

let me tell you a little story about my first solo pvp kill (if we dont count kills where alts are used that is). i was running a maze in a rattlesnake and an Orthrus tried to hunt me down. i docked up and reshipped into a deimos. i warped back to the site and caught the orthrus in the first pocket.  
---
i know this is a very unlikely case but for me in that case the lack of a local would have taken away my possibility for an even fight. what makes your prefered way of pvp more important than mine?   
---
you cant even read a whole sentence and call someone else a retard because of that.... how do you like to say? yikes!  
---
"you consent to pvp the moment you undock" people put their heads on the plate for you to grab. you're literally just complaining CCP isn't making it easy enough for you. feels like we're back to square one here.
---
Cruor. Little more expensive for frig but has good web range. Decently fast..and can brawl or kite other frigs depending if you use beams.or pulse. Its drone is a nice little extra addition too
---
Fuck off lol
---
You can take it wherever you want.
---
My original account for instance.  CCP is awful, but sometimes Eve is not.
---
I also received this email, and I felt ok after trying it out
---
I paid my rent for 2 months by doing this, no consequences.
---
All the more suspicious!!! 
---
CONFIRMED! OMECA BOTS AND RMTS!!!

team security is incredibly opaque and bans whoever they want

I had a similar idea once while I was in the shower. I thought to myself, what if I installed three bathtubs on each side of my shower so I could bathe even more effectively in my shower/place of bathing.

I will not be standing for re-election as I have noted previously, even during my campaign for this year, as I wish to focus on my university studies.

The Retriever is a bit of a pinata - an easy gank. As others have noted, a Procurer is more survivable.  Otherwise, flag CODE red and Always Be Watching Local.

Make code red, when someone in code warps into system just dock up.  It is a bad play style since there is no real way to fight back save for just stop what you are doing and will probably be looked at soon.

They very occasionally venture into Geminate (probably due to proximity to The Forge) to fuck with krabbers, but PH... Disabuses them of their notions.

thank you, but these were choice booty shorts. I'd parade all fancy-boy style around the house, waving my arms in the arm, dancing to whatever was on the radio. Latent sexuality oozed from my pores as I rounded the living room into the hallway with each passing minute.

&gt;however to jump out they'll need a blops. behind every bot theres a programmer that can add in behaviour patterns according to the situations to maximize income / minimize losses. just add in a pattern for blops showing up. that aside a bot can react much faster to someone suddenly decloaking on grid than a human ever could.

just because both decloak, doesn't mean anyone jumped out.

you cannot script this in, you lack info.

I put it into an investing (aka pure gambling) account, wrote some tracking/alerting scripts, got extremely lucky and made +50% in a couple of months, and that ended up being just enough to pay off all my debts before I go into grad school.

no worries, you'll disintegrate during reentry.

Someone on the CSM meta'd gamed CCP, maybe he's tired of the bullshit and rightfully so..

Hilmar’s too busy mining in his venture in highsec

While I appreciate that CCP took down the relevant blog about Brisc, I find it dishonest not to edit said page with the final verdict that Brisc did nothing wrong as opposed to just making it 404 like this fiasco never happened.

&gt; At the time I posted that we had nothing but competing assertions from the two sides, and not a shred of actual evidence either way. I'm not going to draw a conclusion in such a case, and I did not do so in that post.
---
Ever heard of innocent until proven guilty? Seems like most people here have it reversed.
---
Very good article.
---
as i said the ways of setting this up aren't completely failproof and admittedly i can't think of a way right now that is, but then again i don't need to. Ofcourse writing a scripted reaction based on propability leaves room for errors.

CCP probably didn't even go that, far more like "here's a 100k SP sorry we shit all over you life and career."
---
Most non-blob alliances will have a significant amount of people in fleets dualboxing sabres/ceptors in a PvP situation, sometimes doctrine ships if the numbers aren’t great or if it’s an easy doctrine to dualbox (I dualbox logi if we’re low on numbers, and machs are very easy for everyone with a Nag alt to dualbox)
---
This is nothing like when you got Erotica1 banned. CCP is infallible. There are "facts" and there are facts.
---
&gt;Also Sniper Harpies and or jaguar will eat them too if you have the numbers and support to give good warping.
---
Have you heard of heavy interdictors? non-nullified tackle is basically pointless against a boosh fleet unless the FC is asleep.
---
Sometimes I like what he says, but the rest of time he is a moron.
---
If you read carefully, there are enough letters that spell "Yes." Everyone is guilty until proven otherwise.
---
If they get rid of him you know they won't replace him and then there will be literally no one even attempting to fight bots. I don't think he's bad at what he does, just over worked to the point where his efforts have become a punch line of the larger issue. That being that CCP refuses to put money into key parts of the game because they just don't care about them.

Honestly, I still kind of hope it happens, so we see the whole sordid affair resolved for certain one way or another.

can we get some trends over the last year on actual kills per month. Horde keeps growing. I'd imagine their monthly kills are still on the rise whereas NCs are more static.

Solution 1 would be a very bad idea IMO: it would remove an edge case of booshing a hic off of a tackled super. If you want to remove Boosh Ravens then just give the MJFG a 250k ton max total mass so you can only boosh 2 BS or 22 ish eagles at a time.

Its somewhat surreal coming back to the game after a couple years and seeing entities that have been around for a decade as empty shells, if they even exist at all. Seems as if Solar failscaded too.

Nah, its a myrm. I dont fly rust buckets :P

He is a registered attorney - CCP publicly claimed that he broke an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). In a scenario where CCP stuck with their claim, and due to public notice of said action, Brisc would have been required to report this action to the Bar association and possibly loss of his license to practice law. Had CCP excluded the part about actual irl legal violations it might have carried out differently.
---
In other words - before you go shitting on someone with your armchair poor-man's Dr. Phil you should probably educate yourself and get up to speed on the details surrounding the topic.

That would be too manly to be Olmeca

The only person we know for sure was involved is the person who wrote the blog post. Peligro on the other hand has been known to take so long investigating player reports that they are banned months after being reported. I would like to think that given that history of slow moving bans had Peligro been in charge of the investigation into the brisc accusations we would have never heard about it because he would have realized it was false.

I think it says a lot that the Drake STILL being in the top ten for TEST's killmails, even though it hasn't been used in a main doctrine since like, the Fountain War.
---
Who's home?
---
Can someone explain how capsules are on killmails?
---
I’m glad you took time to be unhelpful.
---
So we are going back to posting BRs with no accompanying AARs?
---
Who? Because I don't see them on the BR.
---
General BR: Sleeper Dreams put up an Athanor in Protostarr of Wrong Hole. Alliance's home. They also burned down the shields on all the structures in system. Through out the day Wrong Hole pulled in a fleet to defend Protostarr's home.   
---
At the time, the suspicion was eviction as Sleeper had RF'd structures in their home a couple weeks ago, as well.  
---
Wrong Hole managed to get in a fleet of 78 through out the day with a constant back and forth of fighting for control of the hole with just a few people, with Wrong Hole's forces building up.   
---
The anchor timer for the Athanor rolled around and Sleeper logged in with less pilots than they originally started with. Regardless, they took the fight.   
---
The fight lasted about 25 minutes off the Athanor. Both fleets got hit with booshes and both managed to recover from it. In the end, Wrong Hole was overwhelming the field and Sleeper Dreams evacuated through the static C3. Wrong Hole &amp; friends finished killing the Athanor.  
---
All in all it was an awesome fight.
---
The EvE lore should be replaced with this &amp; minted outside Jita undock in the purest of Goon Spods. Or in undecaying mobile depots, whichever comes first.
---
And work under a NDA...
---
just threaten to sue them...seems to do the trick
---
Sleeper Dreams is the alliance on the BR, D E L E T E L O C A L is in that alliance.

Protostarr.

What would be the point of headshotting Brisc and friends? Could have done a LOT more damage going after Merkelchen, since he is in charge of the day to day for the entire Alliance and therefore Coalition.

purple is the only color i dont shoot

called you calling it
---
Well I have no clue why they went for who they did, of course we don’t know for sure if anyone did try to do a setup, but I would imagine there was a reason for it being pando and shines. Like there being a somewhat believable excuse for it. But again idk and no one besides ccp really knows what actually happened
---
I honestly think it's hilarious.
---
Brisc, if you're watching, I'm sorry, but unfucking a chainsaw may do more harm than good.
---
Correct me if i'm mistaken but was this not defending their home instead of a random skirmish?
---
Gigx?

do only enter if you are a cloaky warper or your allign time is below 2 sec

Whoever draws penises on keepstars deserves a better flair
---
I was one of these people many years ago. It took over a year but they eventually they took a look at what actually happened and unbanned all of my accounts. Fuck you GM Nova, if you even still exist.
---
That's under the assumption that they RMT all that shit, a lot of it might as well go to sponsor the alliance itself. They have really grown in terms of infrastructure, capitals, supercapitals etc.
---
If it stood, he would have been forced to disclose the NDA breach to his state Bar. There is your IRL damages.

think with everything its about 52km/s, heat, links, implants ect in a C6
---
Nah i think they should work it out even more! , make it like a simple RTS minigame.
---
And make looking at your planets even more exciting!
---
The problem is planets are different sizes so minimum proximity of two structures is always going to take a different amount of pg.
---
&gt;as i said the ways of setting this up aren't completely failproof and admittedly i can't think of a way right now that is, but then again i don't need to. Ofcourse writing a scripted reaction based on propability leaves room for errors.

leaves room for people being able to hunt bots consistently*
---
&gt;i think you don't understand how this works. i am talking about additional ones. there would be just as many bots ratting and even more additional ones to ensure a relatively safe intel network.
---
why would people just not run tens of thousands of additional accounts when they apparently can by your own admission?

people can run 5 vnis and 5 scouts or 10 vnis

pick one

can we talk about the YT link for a sec? WTF?

i don't understand at all that kind of attitude towards a small gang pilot , who does not abuse falcon alts , does not chase noobs in high sec with neutral logi etc. We all have good and bad times, considering how often EVE client misbehaves in certain way.
---
My money on Jintaan
---
Tribalism is a funny thing to watch. Some of the same people who quickly condemned Brisc were the same people who vehemently defended Manny, 1ronbank, and lennykravits2. And now I see some of them imply that they are guilty, and they knew it.
---
And bitters! Tower defense! Logic circuits! Logistics robots! Modding support!
---
the unexpected 800 dps gang Eris can be extremely funny

How the hell are you getting 800 DPS out of an Éris ._.
---
that F1 pressing was intense .
---
If you’re shooting someone and die, but your friends finish him off, often your pod will show on his km.
---
200 dps is going to be kind of slow. You really want to be doing 450+ if possible. Your tank is more than enough. But go out and try it and see how it goes

Ah, so TEST also has a penchant for dying in the process of killing others.

---
Can’t make it too easy as, at scale, there’s way too much profit to be made. I mean I feel ya, it would be great to set down entire P1-P3 factories, or the P1 extraction colonies that have to be moved around so much. But if you make this stuff too easy it will change supply levels dramatically.
---
What is this r/CCP? 
---
Can we make a new sub for CCP stuff, because the CCP hate circle jerk is getting in the way of ingame propaganda and politics
---
Wow, talk about new levels of utter and total incompetence when it comes to handling a sensitive situation. Makes you wonder how many other bans and punishments by CCP are "based on unsubstantiated assumptions " and would never have happend if  CCP had "taken the time to review the information with greater scrutiny". 
---
And meanwhile, the game is invested with countless botters that get reported repeatedly for literally months and years and nothing happens to them. 
---
Seemingly you need to be in a high-visibility position and a public figure in the community to have \_any\_ hope of getting semi-decent and half-competent treatment by CCP. 
---
Perhaps putting unpaid interns in charge of such decisions saved you operating costs and allowed the upper management so snort even more Korean coke then usual but it sure didn't pay off in this situation.
---
This would be dope, I'd love to see expansion of PI. How dope would ground-to-air defenses be too
---
It's funny how when this first came out, everyone bashed Brisc for being a lobbyist and assuming he obviously did something wrong and now that he is innocent, everyone bashes ccp
---
Darkshines sold his Molok yea.
---
gm nova is one of the worst ones lmao
---
In your condescension, you misunderstand me and, I think, the post. It sounds like they are going to use the tournament tool, however it is in such bad state that it takes them 20 minutes to set up a match, and I can't for the life of me imagine why. I wasn't criticizing the staff in any way, I'm not sure how you got that from my comment. 
---
&gt;We would like to thank CCP for taking the time to get the tool to a point where we can run competitive matches on Thunderdome.
---
[...]
---
&gt;a broadcast would take up too much time (20+ minute breaks for 10 minutes max of gameplay)
---
Yeah like that some people could harass them irl and ingame, such a great idea...
---
Very good article and good solution.
---
The killmail shows your ship at the moment, when the victim explodes. If you shoot someone in your Drake, then quickly switch to a freighter before others kill him, you'll be shown as a missile firing freighter.
---
It kinda looks like a dragon. And it is the remains of Caroline's star.

---
If you could no longer boosh HICs with there bubbles up, what would stop people from using a couple of dictors to replace them to create drag bubbles? From my understanding boosh raven fleets don't generally fly fast enough that you would be flying through the bubble, and dic bubbles can be booshed. The bubbles would no longer be perfectly placed but a couple of dictors could still probably keep the fleet bubbled enough that it wouldn't make a diffrence.
---
You seems unfamiliar about the concept of NDA and discretion relative to the game development, not everything is in the minutes.
---
Before acting like morons by rushing their decision they should have investigated, their poor decision (CCP) affect not only a player also his irl life which is quite sad.
---
A man is supposed to be innocent before being judged gulty, at least it's like that in France, for brisc it seems for ccp it was «oh we heard he could be guilty, let's burn him.... oh wait we made a mistake»
---
If it's what happend to a known played, what happened to unkown ones?
---
Even if you enjoy doing most things solo, I would still recommend joining a corp/alliance. Makes it easier to ask questions, and if it's newbro friendly corp, they'll love to help.
---
I mostly roam around lowsec solo looking for pvp but I still like being part of a corp to chat with. You can basically have both.
---
Cause bots are so much worse at spamming d-scan than humans.
---
Daedraah is a really good pilot and it's a Wolf vs a Taranis, nothing about this clip is too crazy
---
True, but once you place the blueprint, you could modify it as needed, or break it up into smaller ones. Once the tech is in place there are tons of small neat things you could add. Or you just have a blueprint for different planets etc, modified from a base template you built.
---
To gain enough access in CODE. to steal at least a halfway decent haul, one has to first become a top dog in the trade, and by that time he'll be making a lot more ISK dunking freigters with his alliance bros.
---
I dunno maybe? It's all still gated by timers and shit. They would definitely have to be careful if they implemented something like this.
---
u/CCPFalcon imagine how it would be better to work for the company with a good reputation.
---
CCP don't have the balls to follow through against the pissant forum warrior asshole, more at 11.
---
It's literally so good though.
---
Depending on the system size, you might already be in warp to that anom when you show up on dscan.
---
Local delay will not ruin botting but it helps, imo.
---
Good ol’ Probag, even after quitting you can’t let  EVE go.
---
Posted after I posted ;)
---
I’m biased. Have spent far too much time doing Planetary Interaction. Made a lot of isk but eventually just quit PI entirely and started playing factorio. ;-)
---
Your victory conditions seeem to be; The position of our dreads, that you have a Keepstar on the grid 2 days after the battle, that you were about to start winning, that we didn't start the battle again after it ended, that we didn't continue kiling your faction forts or kill any more keepstars in the weeks following the battle.
---
If you want to say you won the war in the south go ahead, but we all know goons invading the north was the decisive factor. Maybe you were going to win on your own, we'll never know.
---
Tbh you did win a defensive war in the current meta so you get to revise the history and also name that war, what imaginative name would you like for it ?
---
To be fair they mostly just reported goons.
---
/u/dumbdwarf how do you feel about this? :chinthink:
---
Thanks
---
&gt;dualboxing really helps when solo 
---
so how many alts in game considered as """solo""" ?
---
Eve players... putting in a crazy amount of effort to farm salt?   No, not the Eve players I know.
---
I haven't approved this many goon posts since WWB. I think that's why I actually did something about those posts. Old reflex? lol
---
lol, what kind of logi? have you heard about the roraqual changes?
---
So you say.
---
Why should I use a Barghest over a Nightmare? If its battleship vs battleship what benefit is there to using Cruise missiles vs the  Large Pulse Guns ? How should a cruise missile Barghest be flown?
---
Fuck yes
---
RMT is one of the few things CCP does right imo, I think they actually require having evidence and if none exists they do nothing. I've transferred and received significant sums of ISK from people I've never interacted with in game and I've never been banned for RMT.
---
At least, to my knowledge, I was banned twice for no reason and unbanned but it was unlikely due to RMT suspicions.
---
I approve.
---
u/CCP_Falcon imagine how it would be better to work for an organization with a good reputation.
---
The perfect ending.
---
it was a thing back in the days, ask you grendpa for details
---
That's unfortunate.  He should make that break permanent.
---
Factorio is my favorite game to play while playing Eve

Facts are stubborn things.

My god, you can see how poor we are just by comparing those lists.
---
It highly depend with how ans for what you’ll use them. If it’s for PVE, Nightmare is one hell of a beast, despite everyone telling you to go for a Rattlesnake. Basically : you’ll have an excellent tracking against a wide range of targets, and the AB bonus will help you move faster inside sites. Also, since you only have to fit four guns, your capacitor will have way less troubles supporting the heaviest lasers.
---
For the Barghest, it’s not the same. It’s the most expensive faction battleship currently, so losing one will cost you way more than a Nightmare. However, Cruise missiles have a way better range than lasers with good skills, so you’ll still apply full DPS after a MJD Jump. Also, since your missiles go dumbly fast, distance and travel time won’t be a problem. You also have selectable damage, so if the place you’re ratting have rats that doesn’t have EM/Thermal resists hole, you’ll do better than a Nightmare.
---

Hey, thanks for the very detailed reply. It is good information. I am aiming to use the Barghest in smallgang situations only. PVE'ing is heretical.

Soo ccp is going to ban whomever brought these false claims against him right?
---
So the problem is not that boosh ravens counters a few doctrines. The problem is that in order to fight boosh ravens you have to form a specific fleet or you cant really do much.
---
Dscan have a very small cool down, but it have one nonetheless. This mean that any cloaking ship can just pinpoint the bot’s ship, warp on it cloaked and then decloak. With an oversized prop mode, they’ll have not enough time to warp out before being tackled.
---
Or just use a Combat recon, which are invisible on dscan.
---
Mind you, the *first* fountain war...
---
Now think about all the bots that go reported and un-banned.

Why do you want to remove boosh ravens?

Jintaan is the CCP we need.

Grats on fulfilling support tickets faster than CCP
---
&gt;After poking around a bit  I heard some interesting information
---
What would "poking around a bit" in a cesspool of ignorance give you?
---
&gt;This was basically decided using the same standard of proof as other similar cases
---
How did you get to that conclusion? Was it at CCP you were poking around? Anywhere else and all you have is rumor and conspiracy theories.
---
Your reply seems to insinuate that all previous bans has been completely justified and that this one was only overturned because of a potential lawsuit and not for the fact that they actually made a mistake.
---
There are a lot of speculations what might've been the reason CCP thought there had been a breach but we know nothing about it. There were talk about a Molok sale being the reason on The Meta Show but even though one would think The Mitanni would have insider information about this it is still just speculation. We know nothing. Especially since all CSM members seems to deny that they themselves brought forth the initial accusation.
---
They have some success killing the odd afk proc or two with blinged out garmurs and kikis. Then promptly eat shit. Geminate is detroit, and whether they want to or not our krabs learn to pvp.

he loaned that cruiser afaik, so he didnt loose 500b , casper did
---
Which totally makes sense, since TEST has only most recently became a powerbloc with a super fleet. \^\^

Kind of. You can still do it warping 100km on a player next to the sun hitbox. Lotsa work tho.

The main reason they opted for missiles is because the to hit calculation for turret weapons on a citadel would be hilariously broken. I don’t know how you’d even begin to make it work.

For each second you sit down and trying to find how to avoid CODE you waste time. Time you could have fun playing the game and time you could use to increase your isk. 
---
I lost 50 ships in the first two months of the game and I never even blinked. I did not just follow rule of not flying what I cannot afford to lose but I made up my own rule to not fly what exceeded 10% of my wallet. I did not avoid, I went all my way to find them. Now I am making in 2 hours the amount of ships that I lost those two months.  Even when I broke my own rule a couple of times I did under the assumption most likely I would lose the ship. Fortunately I did not but then I did not actually push my luck  either. 
---
We had a russian in our close by systems sitting (in a null sec) , attacking and killing our members. Did not turned out very well for him because we organised gate camps to randomly attack anyone coming from and going to high sec.  He brought some friends the other day , we run for the hills. Next day we were once more there gate camping and we will be there the next and the day after that so on. As a result he had to retreat to more distant systems.  
---
I am new to null sec , being here for a week I lost 90 mil ship to him which I could have avoided easily but that's what makes the game fun. Ironically I lost 300 mil ships to NPCs.
---
But I could have been angry , worried , scary but then there is the tiny detail I made 2 billion ISK in return. 
---
Avoiding ganks is pretty simple, if you are in high sec avoid being in a corp that is in war. My first corp was in war with Marmites , I came to EVE for the PVP , so I came to this game to lose ships and have fun. When I felt that I wanted a break from the random ganking when I came back, I dropped to a NPC corp and I did not lose a ship for months. 
---
Now that I am in null sec dying has become more difficult , which is kinda funny because I am suppose to be in an area where death is normal. But our Intel channel that warns us for any incoming fleets  + the fact that anyone that appears in the system is considered hostile + the crazy amount of isk one came makes in null sec = null has been for me the safest area of the game. 
---
So my advice is to use all the tools you have in your disposal, even zkillboard alone can alert you about potential gankers coming your way, gate camps and the usual random kills. Be smart , use those tools

I'm a simple man, I see a new Naz post I upvote.

Stop undocking guys that's not whAt Eve is about!

No. For a killmark you need to get the final blow. So you would need to eject and board the new freighter while your own killing missiles are still in flight. I don't think that's possible.

CCP unbanned him after a full investigation you fucking retard.
---
It amazes me to this day that people STILL trust Falcon on anything, when he's proven **repeatedly** that he's about as trustworthy as my hemorrhoids.
---
I mean, any reasonable person would assume CCP has plenty of solid evidence before performing character assassination on a public figure.
---
Of course, anyone who's dealt with CCP's incompetence long enough should have known better.
---
Or we could all just refuse to vote for all current CSM members ever again until they own up to their mistake.
---
If it really was just a mistake then they should be able to show it from their point of view. If not, then they can not be trusted and should not be allowed anywhere near the CSM ever again.

Still not brag worthy.

Indeed, Nullsec isn't your only option however, Lowsec space is easier for solo players and doesn't have all the same mechanics as high-sec (no bubbles), Wormhole space has bubbles and can be a bit spoopy (and you have to be insane to solo live there) but the PVP is some of the best in the game and there's some of the best isk making oppotyunities with Gas huffing, Ice Mining, normal mining and sleeper sites, also tons of exploration if that interests you.
---
Saying that, living in WH space can be hard and really requires T2 cloaks, specifically the cov-ops cloak for scouting around and exploring.
---
Dunno... did the same thing like you. Calling ppl fucking retard and then crying after getting the same answere... i dont know. Are you a pussy? A little Princess? Or also just a fucking retard ?

I called you a retard because of your inability to understand simple concepts like the fact that it wasn't the CSM who unbanned Brisc.  I can see I'm wasting my time trying to talk facts to a fucking paste eater though so I'll give up.

Dont give up! At some point you will understand that you are wrong.

If you want to earn good money for new bro, without leaving High Sec. Get a exploration frigate.

But i don't think [Sylvanas Windrunner United Fleet](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98575120/) are 100% bots they probably just accept bots or harbor them.
---
The 3rd zkill link might be just a coincidence.
---
as per the other guy, about 95% of the armchair lawyers assumed brisc was fucked because CCP wouldn't DARE make a public post like that unless they could throw the book at him

but apparently they actually had about 1x post-it note ready at best

It's also entirely possible that the other CSM members just brought some concerns based on potential coincidences, and CCP, being CCP, went full REEEEE on the information provided.  It's not like CCP has shown much competence in the last 5 years.
---
Baboon
---
you mean like my group?
---
It's also entirely possible he is actually guilty but CCP doesn't have enough solid evidence to counter a possible lawsuit.
---
Still absolute shit handling by CCP, as per usual.
---
Sounds good actually
---
Does the bubble have to be *exactly* in line with my warp to catch me? For example, if I know there’s a bubble on gate B and I’m warping from gate A, can I technically burn 500km perpendicular to it and warp without getting caught?
---
Everything is pricey because it's an island in the middle of nowhere, so everything needs to be shipped from far away to get there. You will still be spending less than $50 for a really good outing to a restaurant as long as you don't go crazy with alcohol. I've just looked up prices for some of the best rated restaurants in Reykjavik - even 'gourmet 3-course dinner' costs less than $100 per person.
---
So really unless you are going there for food tourism and eating the best food possible, you will probably be spending less than $100 / day. Add in car rental for a week at $350, admission prices add up to something like another $200, and souvenirs are up to you (let's say you buy something nice so another $300).
---
A full week in Iceland, all-inclusive with activities and souvenirs comes to $2350, round that to $2500 so you can throw in one extremely nice dinner in there. Considering that it's the type of trip you wouldn't be making very often, that's very reasonable. It becomes even cheaper if you are in Europe with flights costing &lt;$500 round-trip (I can see next week tickets for 260Eur), so the trip comes to &lt;$2000 in that case.
---
&gt; you're just trying to cover your own initial response
---
Nobody cared about my response. If I wanted people to forget it I'd just not talk about Brisc anymore.
---
&gt; In the position of the three whom were banned
---
In that position I'd knew if I cheated or not. If I did, then I'd suck the punishment up. If I didn't, I'd understand why people still might think I cheated given evidence available to them.
---
What a great year for EvE this has been so far : )
---
go to bank . withdraw 2 grand. repay loan. problem solved.
---
&gt; CCP is protecting the CSM members
---
Why tho. Would have been easier to divert blame to some member.
---
&gt; Hence we must assume there is none
---
There is something that is not a word of mouth that prompted CCP to ban. I don't think they'd ban people on words alone. So the question is that was it really not insider trading, or it was the case that CCP just couldn't prove it on court?
---
&gt; Looking at this now its obvious that CCP's current banning procedure is at best extremely lax
---
As I said, the evidence CCP uses for most bans wouldn't hold at the case of court. And they don't need to be. And this doesn't mean most of the bans were wrong. It just means CCP is not the police and can't do detective work, but they need to ban people anyway to protect the game, so they use partial evidence.
---
&gt; To ensure the "Integrity" of the CSM 
---
Instead of taking the PR hit it would have been much nicer to blame it on a rogue CSM. They did stuff like this before. Didn't hurt "integrity".
---

I think op meant it in a way that assuming somebody isn’t plexing all of their scouts, which I’m curious about as well..

Mordu’s Legion ships are extremely good choice in PVP. You can be a heavy tackle because of the long point/scram, and the massive bonus to Missile velocity will just negate the disadvantage of missile in capsuleers vs capsuleers engagements :)
---
Nightmare is a good choice too, but you’re more vulnerable to neuting than a Barghest, and you’ll also have a smaller tank since some of your mid slots will be taken by capacitor and tackling module. But even a frigate under scram/disruptor and à heated grappler will take full damage from your pulses !

you cant use cloak on alpha, so yes you have to plex all of them

/u/redalert447 I was recently reviewing footage from 2018 of us reinforcing FRT's fort in LK1K-5, and the guy FCing our SS fighter carrier fleet on that day literally turned around to progod after progod said "\[FC Name\]  get those fighters moving" and said "progod shut up please". 
---
And that's in the middle of a 10% TIDI fight. Imagine if we didn't have TIDI, and the absolute chaos that would be occurring in FC comms. PGL's tendency to yell in fleets is somewhat frustrating, especially if you're one of the line members that's doing everything you're asked to do.

Why ? Because they’ll have to actually watch DSCAN for incoming threats ? Wormhole people had to do it since day one, and it’s certainly not a problem.

I don't get it. Can't you have a blued carrier at distance locking everyone up, streaming it to a non-broadcasted stream with zero delay, chop the input as part of the overlay in OBS to show health bars? Then just stream the fights with commentary?
---
Will it be perfect? No. Will it show EWAR? No. Will it still work? Yes.
---
Streamfleet tournament without a stream is equal to shitting without toilet paper.

Acting as though this community, with all its bandwagoning, wasn't complicit in "the Brisc thing" from the very start. If you want to hold CCP accountable, be consistent in doing so.

Between series maybe, but individual matches within each series were minutes apart (long enough to let the players chill out for a minute).
---
There is a lot of repressed self-hate in the eve player base.
---
it was approx 10mins between matches - and already the stream was uncomfortable with that timeline.

And shooting PH mining fleets is also great fun!

tbh if tomorrow we learn that anti-Imperium CSM (not pointing finger but people like sort dragon for example) are the one who did it, there is a real issue to work on

You gotta bookmark the wormhole you entrered from so you can get back without needing to scan it down again.
---
Ofc it is. But was the tools available that feeds you information the issue, not the rest of the production?
---
I'd still take a stream rather than no stream. Oh well... Recaps it is.
---
different gas sites spawn all kinds of NPCs, some you can kill as a alpha with a destroyer to some even marauders don't want to face. It's common practice to look for specific better sites, then mine the first 20min until the sleepers spawn, then kill them to be able to continue.
---
However as a Omega it's possible to speed tank the very best gas site with a prospect so the sleepers just sit there with you and basicly defend you.
---
No need for a tanky ship when mining Gas clouds, dont warp to "Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir", as those contain several sleeper sentries. Any other gas site will have sleepers warp in after 15-20 minutes. Use that time to get as much gas as you can and warp out once the sleepers arrive.
---
They already did that.

I know there’s at least one guy running 60+ off a Dell server chassis with a dual proc Xeon and a Titan cludged into the frame since it doesn’t fit with the lid closed. That lets him use isboxer, scale the windows to minimum resolution, run them with capped fps and then rdp from his main machine to the server (run locally) to control them.
---
Idc as long as I’m having fun.
---
Btw buy crystalline isogen.
---
I prefer it on my phone. I lay in bed and browse all the things. When I'm at my PC I'm generally working or gaming. I've only used the reddit is fun app because it's like the old reddit which I much prefer. I'll have to try that one linked above

Icelandic people eat rotten sharks and pickled bull testicles for luls. A shitburger is nothing.
---
I believe he still runs this chat bot that gives points for you just being there. Even when the stream is offline. 
---
You use these points to win in-game items packs and maybe other things. 
---
You can also connect to the Twitch chat servers using any IRC client which many people still use for other purposes so being connected to one more chat server isn't a huge hassle.
---
Sometimes I really wonder whether these screenshots are taken in game or from trailers. The details and lighting of Eve is really top notch.
---
Would be a bit strange considering Jin is also in INIT ;)
---
&gt;Feel free to let me know what is your opinion on this.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuiX9mlDY9E
---
And yet you read the whole thing. Baited on a free wall of text
---
In fairness, you wouldn't've expected Brisc to have deliberately tried to cheat or breach an NDA and you wouldn't've expected a multi-national corporation to proceed against a high-profile figure in and out of game in such a public manner without having solid evidence. Based on the information to hand, the logical conclusion was Brisc made a mistake.
---
I don't think even the most jaded of us could have understood just how much of a shitshow CCP must be internally and how little they care about their game and their player-base to have allowed both this and the situation with the Streamfleet Showdown to happen.
---
However, we also must admit when we're wrong and I was and I also apologise - not that it matters if I do as I'm fucking nobody. These past few weeks are making me wonder if I should bother continuing to play the game after my sub is up as why should I support a company that doesn't support its game nor its players?
---
So I'll either end resigning myself to the state of the game as it is in 2019 and go gently into that good night or get angry and run for CSM and not get elected because I'm a nobody 'but at least I tried to make things better'.
---
TL;DR - a nobody writes a wall of text - might leave or might fail at trying to change things. CCP is more shit-tier than even the biggest autist on r/Eve could have predicted. Sorry Brisc.
---
&gt;That 300km range limit honestly seems a bit like a leftover limit from back when grids were small. 
---
It was only fairly recently that it was increased to 300km.  It used to be 250.
---
Yeah i know, but i somehow cleverly bookmarked the entrance one and forgot the exit one LOL
---
And then came x47

"godfather of streaming"
---
You mean a retard that "debates" other retards on Twitch?
---
An Abyss of ~~competence~~ Pearls is whats happening
---
sounds like they were assuming the accounts were not plex. If you have an alpha account open, that can be your only account online. So you would need some sort of set up to spoof it to look like you only have one alpha per pc.
---
But since a cloaking device takes an omega account.  THe player would need to have all the accounts plexed.
---
What a fucking idiot.
---
maybe launch a bomb amd switch board a freighter. That has to already sit unpiloted on grid next to you... hmmm.
---
sidenote: you can swap from one ship to another unpiloted one in one session timer, right? Or do you have to eject first.?
---
What exactly does this have to do with EVE? I see this as a twitch issue, not EVE/CCP.
---
Sleepers spawn after 20 minutes. You can "ninja harvest" and only harvest for 20 minutes, then leave. I can kill most of the low class sites in under 20 minutes with 4 ventures. It's some of the best isk in the game.
---
They still can bump him for as long as necessary... venture should be fine barge is slooooow
---
Astriania ~~informed~~ uninformed accusation specialist
---
They envy your autism.
---
You can counter boosh raven with current mechanic. Just use it. A shame that he has not spoken about that
---
PL was using boosh rokh. Try it. Less dmg but instant application.
---
Oh that's a good one, i'll keep my eye on those "Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir" ones, last time i was successful with getting away with some gas i had lead the NPCs to following me a few Km away from the site, then warping in and continue to harvest for little longer, surely it takes more time, but i guess those ones were pretty week, unlike the Sleepers that just 2 hit my venture into oblivion HAHA
---
Don't quit your day job for anything involving storytelling or analysis.
---
EVE 2019, wherein Wallymarts is better at PR than ~~CCP Online~~ Pearly Abyss Spaceships Online
---
It even has a desto. 64 kills in Tama in the last 1 your. Checks out (for a year ago maybe, when Black Rise wasn't dead), followed by Kedama.
---
If you ever upgrade to a Prospect, then you can fit a 10mn Compact AB and sig tank the sentries.
---
Sleepers in Vital and Instrumental sites will 1 shot a venture. It's best to just move on after the rats spawn.
---
I only have one account and i'm mostly a lone wolf so yeah, i don't think i can do all that :P
---
But yeah it's definitely super rewarding, i got lucky with my first try and netted little over 12 million from just one run, i was also dodging the pesky NPCs by leading them far away from the site and then warping in, giving me a little bit more time to harvest LOL
---
Do not mine, do not waste time in highsec to feed these noobs.
---
Join a newbro oriented corporation/alliance. Learn how to PvP and make the isk required for it in nullsec or lwosec.
---
I'm not even gonna call it posting at this point this is high literature.
---
"pretty cool in-game"
---
:bigthink:
---
You do realise CCP ISNT bound by the CSM NDA right.
---
Only the CSM members are?
---
Last 3 years of krabbification of Eve expectedly resulted in a big scarcity of daily or major (wars etc) content. There isn't much for people to login anymore. CCP is now trying to revert it back but much more drastic measures are needed to ensure interesting content. I'm afraid these measures would fall beyond CCP/CSMs imagination, or would require more work than CCP would allocate, or would be seen as too risky/controversial in that they would anger the big empire builders/members. 
---
Even if the changes were realized, things would have to go worse for a little while more before going better (much like how it happens when you interfere an economic recession with good measures). Organic growth is harder compared to just pushing Rorqual multiboxing to motivate people to get many accounts and spend on injectors.
---
Here is an incomplete shortlist of what needs to happen to bring content back again:
---
- Further anom nerf to ensure a single umbrella range can only support something like 1/15 of the entire null population.
---
- Mobile cyno inhib revamp to make sure people actually have to warp in (and not cyno in) capitals or obtain subcap superiority on a grid to save a tackled friendly PvE capital.
---
- A mechanic that would give the 15% asset safety tax to the destroyer corporation of a citadel, given that the attacking side held grid control for an entire week (like how it works in wormholes).
---
- More connectivity between highclass wormholes and nullsec. Nullsec statics for C6. And even C7 wormholes which would support multiple dreads in and out.
---
- Nerf carriers/supers to levels before the citadel patch. Take back all the damage/application/ongrid speed/targeting speed buffs they have received during the transition from drones to fighters at the citadel patch. Disallow gate bosoning.
---
- A local delayed covert cloaky ship that is actually specialized in cyno hunting (recon ships were what CCP had in mind, but are a joke for hunting, they are actually good for EWAR support), particularly to handle botters.
---
- More NPC stations to create hostile bases in jumping range of most regions. Ideally convert these stations to citadels which allow neutrals/blues to tether.
---
Then CCP's claim they discussed it with the CSM is even more shady and we need a better explanation than them going radio silent.
---
You should be happy they brought you some ASCII genitalia
---
They don't. Only that super elite PvP corp that joined CODE for tye memes, go.
---
The CODE core do bot even think about it - ugh, PvP and risk if dying to a player, disgusting'.
---
How big is your sample size?
---
Good, so eventually the people who keep saying that, including you, will lose this form of entertainment that is Eve Online, and it makes me happy.
---
be careful he might unfriend you on FB
---
I disagree with krabbification. 
---
It wasn't that krabbing was pushed on people, it was that conflict drivers were removed.
---
Krabbing is just all that's left.
---
You're 10 years late with that logic
---
lumio is now part of provibloc as holder of 9-f0b2 and is still alive and kicking (ass)

His store sells eve stuff. It's a lovely loophole.
---

---
people make fun of it, but more and more in 2019 its proving itself to be massively overpowered
---
That could've precisely been the reason why this went so wrong..
---
I lost it at, "I am Xenuria."
---
Oh boi. This is getting out if hand!
---
This has something I've wanted for a while. Overlay a hex grid onto a planet and make all the buildings snap to the grid (except extractor heads, for obvious reasons.) Allow the player to select a portion of the placed buildings and save the pins and their configuration information using relative grid coordinates, instead of the latlon they use for placement now. This can be completely client side. Of course, for extra credit, have server side storage, too, with the only use case being sharing of planet blueprints, if the blueprint data (after protobuf + base64) was too bulky for sharing in chat.
---
use isboxer
---
it helps you run more clients for less cpu/ram
---
you can also use it for input broadcasting
---
just remember to deny it whenever you get caught
---
Called it!
---
Wiah i knew sooner.
---
Thanks for the article, nice and clear summary.
---
Small nitpick: cruise FOF missiles have a maximum range of 200km, so the 300km Raven needs to be shooting regular cruise (doesn't change any of your points). Also, shame having to click on INN to read it. Still, thanks for the work!
---
They need enough evidence to convince themselves. And it didn't even suffice for that...
---
Yeah but you really think that they will throw under the bus one or several of the csm member and becomes even more ridiculous? The csm is one of their commercial argument, they can't.
---
And how will players and people outside would see that ? CCP made a huge mistake, they rushed their conclusion, it's their mistake of not doing the proper investigation
---
Agreed. Not sure why no one is making a bigger deal on its drone buffs. It can field a full flight of mediums.
---
Both things are at fault imho. Rorq-/Super-Crabbing has lead to sub 20b/50b Supers/Titans and caps becomming throwaway ships, and shit like bashing an 800mil Asshaus over 3 timers, each one with a 30min damage cap and up to 12d of RF only for everything inside beeing automagically teleported to safety has driven down motivation for conflict.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Or run skill farming with +5 imps on one/both of the other 2 characters you got on your account? It's not like your cloaky campers need any further training.
---
Found the guy who thinks cloaks should run on fuel
---
Long live the GSM
---
not anymore they changed it 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Council_of_Stellar_Management
---
&gt;players were required to run for the CSM under their real name, but that requirement no longer exists
---
Ones not blue to brisc
---
6,042 meters long last I checked. Those things are massive
---
So you'd rather CCP stay silent than know about CSM members who are abusing their positions to try and get ingame opponents banned from the game using false and fake information?
---
PC wise as others mentioned even a mid end pc can be engineered to run 10 accs+ without difficulty. Isk wise you only need like 8-9b to set up these chars to do their thing then extract after making them close to free.
---
You bring up some great points, although C7 wormhole kind of goes against the point of wh space. Wh space is it's niche due to a low amount of capitals via the soft cap mechanics currently in place.
---
Reasonable lmao
---
Nice snuggly rating
---
Darkshines sold the molok, supposedly because pando told him something brisc leaked to him. 
---
But that was speculation fairly early on. Maybe there were better theories i missed. It tied all three people involved in, which is more than most other speculations do.
---
I have to admit, that im curious what exactly went down as well.
---
You join a group in null/lowsec (or even wormhole space), make way more ISK and learn to play the game the way it’s meant to be played (with people not in highsec), and never have to deal with CODE again.
---
no
---
I'm not proposing to bring supers/titans in whs, but to have wormholes that can support something like 7-8 carriers/dreads in and out. Carriers/dreads already exist in highclass (or even lowclass for defending people) wormholes in much greater degrees. The only difference would be that it would be much easier to seed these C7 wormholes with capitals (15 at a time rather than 3 at a time), which I think would be only a limited influence on the wh meta.
---
Lynch mobs are a real.
---
&gt; What do I do in this situation?
---
You Praise James 315 of course. He is the Supreme Protector, Father of the New Order, and the Saviour of Highsec. 
---

Him and the xRaynorz guy give you points for just watching. Im sure plenty of people are afk and muted 24/7 so they can get an Orca or some shit for free.
---
So, his mistake was not keeping his transversal up while trying to close distance on the Wolf? I assume that the plan with the 75mm rails/web/scram vs an Arti Wolf was to get in web then scram range, and then on top of the Wolf to finish him off.
---
Where did the perception that asset safety is somehow reducing conflict come from? Outposts didn't drop loot. They didn't even meaningfully reduce one's access to one's trash after losing the outpost. There's no past analogue, unless one deludes oneself into thinking that POS storage was ever used outside j-space.
---
Dark mode is for emo cutters.  Light mode is for those bathing in the holy fire of righteousness.

I still like the Proteus. Even if it got nerfed harder than anything has a right to be.

Last time I played it was slow af though

Switch your skill queue for combat and drone skills, do jot chase barges and exhumers. The progress when you start as miner is so slow, compared to the other paths you can take in Eve. You will thank me later. ;)
---
Thought for the day: It is divine to purge the heretic with the holy flamer.

What shio/prop/effect was this? I'm assuming a black hole environment and links.

Peal Abyss: We want to buy CCP Games for its great interactions with its Community, its successful PvP Tournament the Alliance Tournament as well as supporting player run Tournaments and its long running interactions with its player-base through the CSM.

CCP: "Hold My Beer"  Kills AT, Ignores Community created tournament until day before, fails to provide even the basic support of their own tools, Publicly bans one of its own CSM and has to backtrack with egg on its face when truth actually comes out showing their innocence. CCP refuses to speak to the community about any of this.

You know you can just go to any station with a clone bay and self destruct? Or just SD

Lmao you're fuckin retarded брат
---
But, but Hilmar said thousands register every month! How dare you?
---
both meta shitfits

First apply to karmafleet. Then just wait 72 days
---
Do you know if you can cap FPS through EVE-O? I haven't looked into it myself.
---
There are only 2 ships that gas mine and they're both very similar.
---
Protip: Ordinary perimeter reservoirs are the ones you never warp to because they always have rats, even when you first get there. Of course, it's the site with *ordinary* in the name that is the exception.
---
Thanks CCP. 😟
---
Andromadrama?
---
This period starts in June, not in December, as correctly stated by OP. Last couple of years Spring was usually always at a peak. Instead we are seeing numbers that are typical for August.
---
Removing anomalies would also ruin botting, doesn’t make it a good idea
---
it's about Devs if the game is gonna fail...always
---
Yes, people could just be keeping it open all the time (or not closing for a long time after stream) just for this. I actually won that EVE starter pack he had on raffle like 2 years ago!
---
Orbit the rock you're mining at near your max range for your mining laser. Harder to get warp in on a moving object, also harder to apply damage.
---
NPC corps are actually 11%
---
Yes, you need 1k plex in your vault and then open a ticket on the support site for a character transfer, will take some days to get it done
---
Thx!
---
Idk, people hype up the murder capitals of the US and I visit them monthly. Yes even Detroit. Delivered and slept in my 18 wheeler near gratiot/7mile, grixdale, Lawton st, Harper/vandyke. Anywhere near Dearborn smells like sewage so I don’t even remotely stay that way.
---
Brightmoor, highland park. Yup been to some gems alright.
---
Isboxer has all the features for assigning cores/tweaking fps, etc. Eve-o is super basic iirc.
---
I use a vaga quite effectively in t4/5. Its pretty fun.
---
&gt;Where did the perception that asset safety is somehow reducing conflict come from? Outposts didn't drop loot.
---
No, but it nevertheless hurt the enemy more and actually "taking away" the assets from an enemy is a bigger motivator than having them teleported to safety for a small fee.
---
&gt;They didn't even meaningfully reduce one's access to one's trash after losing the outpost
---
They did tho. While theory getting assets out via a character in the hostile group wasn't that difficult, it wasn't a trivial thing for the average linemember either, and certainly not compared to "press button, get assets back".
---
Fireselling meant that the aggressors had the satisfaction of beeing abled to snatch up some good deals, and the enemy actually lost those assets, instead of receiving them back(even ignoring the fact that "perfect" fireselling often wasn't possible with some items/random stuff that wouldn't get bought up).
---
Me personally would pick the Drake.
---
Though not the best choice, but way more fun 😊
---
Think it will be enough for people to question CCP permabans with no explanation?
---
Not a chance in hell.
---
My advise is to ninja the first 20 minutes, run away when the sleepers come.  
---
come back with a random passiv drake, it can kill the npcs of any gas site except vital and instrumental. you can make 20M in 10 minutes killing sleepers in bountiful or vast gas site (blue loot is love).  
---
Once it's done, come back with your venture and relax yourself while huffing the rest of the gas.  
---
If you can't or don't want bring "big" ship to kill sleeper, you can just travel through wh, scan, 20 minutes huff, repeate. in that case, search C5 and C6 WH (biger sleeper and best gas)

Every time I finish one of these posts, I'm both entertained and horrified that I read the entire thing.
---
okay - if true, that is a fair point. I've no problem admitting I didn't know that. I am now more informed than I was previously. thank you :-)
---
All your suggestions revolve around hunting people in delve.... or making them easier to hunt.
---
The reason no one wages major wars is because bashing citidels is toxic and we really get no advantage of bringing out our big toys to bash them. Sure adding a payout may boost activity a little but its just a drop in the bucket
---
If you lower anomaly spawn timers we will spread out of course but we wont break up... We will just host more reponse fleets and smash your shit just as easly as before. People want to use the ships they spend years training into and the only way to use them right now is to rat for the most part.
---
Or maybe it's just people changing from 10 omega'd alts down to 5 o 7?
---
What does your battle Heron look like?
---
1. get a fax
---
2. get a lot of domis
---
3. add them to your watchlist
---
4. pew pew fleets
---
The things you're describing are personal motivations for wanting the old system back. Wars were never sparked over the desire to acquire firesales after the war was over. You can't use loss of firesales to claim that conflict is being reduced.
---
If you want to reclaim this personal motivation, shoot engineering complexes and reactor-fit refineries. These structures have only partial asset safety in the form of active jobs dropping their material inputs (or finished products, if undelivered) on structure death.

just more rorq alts and day old super pilots mate

Maybe it's the same person that's overzealous about adding new skins, to the point that old bugs get forgotten forever...
---
I regularly warp in on salvaging destroyers and snatch salvage out of their salvage beam because of the 25% faster cycle time. Despite how well known people in brave are for salvaging most people don't have Salvaging V for T2 salvagers or T2 salvage tackle rigs.
---
I was considering using a more dps oriented praxis instead of cap mods in the lows and using a cap booster and a hoarder alt to keep it supplied but then i realized that 2 praxii would be better
---
Unless you are well skilled relics.

You will be able to finally krab in pease and in 100% safety. Unless CCP release PvP bots.

You're absolutely right, I should've posted some kind of proof alongside that claim.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/N7EkULt.png) is a screenshot I took before I withdrew that money and got rid of Robinhood. I got extremely lucky to make that profit, but I started fearing gambling.

Not shown offscreen is the arty Thrasher using a passive cargo scanner on the heron in hopes that the bird's cargo is full of juicy exploration loot.
---
You are implying he is bullshitting us?
---
Dare you how?
---
Oh fuck. I am...definitely surprised.
---
I'm still not ready to fall in to the whole 'CCP got metagamed narrative'. There is literally no proof of that. It's more likely a concern got raised and CCP just smacked the ban button then and there.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
I'd argue that in trade only with trusted partners it's less, might get down to 300$ (according to botter I talked with (no not frat, kwg))
---
lol
---
Wow you're going to be insufferable now. 😁
---
Welcome back.
---
I mean yes, but why not throw some cheap implants in the cloakies too and extract every so often?
---
Don't buy anything in Jita thats spammed in local chat until you can spot the scams.
---
Ah the test whelpcanes.
---
omg (mittens) this is awesome!
---
I'm pretty sure it's going to cost less to buy daily alpha injectors than buying the BP for a character per ship.
---
30 sec delay is bizarre, people will just place scouts 1 jump out...  
---
I know, logoff traps, but botters will adapt as they always do, in contrast to real players.
---
Well Markeedragon has been around for many years as a streamer and from what I can tell personally he is completely legit. I get that he is not going to be everyone's cup of tea but seriously dude I feel you are being rather disingenuous here. For one he does a lot more than 'just' mining as you put it and over the years has done many different things. I often catch his Youtube channel for a bit of chill at the end of my EVE session as I wind down and can't say I ever felt the presence of bots or what not as you suggested.

I think you will find his trick is to engage with his listeners and he even goes as far as organising stuff in game that his viewers can be part of if they so choose (i.e. moon mining). In that sense he is very much providing "content that matches the viewer base" and I would say puts in a fair of effort into it.
---
BTW - I can't say I have never paid him or in anyway engaged with his in stream stuff - I just like kind of lurk &amp; enjoy listening.
---
I used to run 3 clients on 1 screen, had the clients setup zigzag on that screen so I could quickly click between them. On a 19 inch crt with 1280x1024. I could probably do 2 if I really focused on it today. I hope.
---
Haha I did that once. I watched his contract trading video on Youtube and it was just so relaxing I almost dozed off.
---
what the fck happened anyway?

As long as you're having fun now, who cares if eve survives 2,3,4 or 20 years?
---
Is this another lie? I remember when you said "It's Reddit Bro EVERYONE LIES!!!" 
---
Just stop all the lies.
---
Basically, fuck you to nonbotters?
---
Wars/deployments are fueled by each sides members logging in and joining fleets. Personal motivation has everything to do with the sustainability of conflict.
---
The motivation isn't personal gain, it's the enemies' loss.
---
And losses from active industry jobs are nice and appreciated, but too limited due to the obvious limitation to industrial activities/structures/players.
---
***LIES!!!***
---
You don't know anyone you've been in Central Russia on an LDS Mission!!!
---
#LIES!!!
---
At the same time... reporting that a game banned a player based on X doesn’t really require a retraction because well... it was true. Any follow up would be just that. A follow up. I don’t know why everyone has jumped on this retraction bandwagon. It’s not like any of these articles were breaking investigative pieces claiming they discovered some crap. They literally reported on a press release. The basis of the press release being later found to be unfounded doesn’t exactly make the news articles about it incorrect or require a retraction. Most will probably “update” their articles and some may do a follow up but.... it’s not like they were the ones to mess up.
---
Again LIES!!!
---
Stop covering lies with more lies!!!!
---
You have a problem good sir!!!
---
Don't run for CSM
---
I 100% recommend doing the tutorials. The tutorials give you a tiny taste of a lot of different ways you can make money in the game. And in the end, EVE is about PVP and making money.
---
If you haven't signed up yet, using a referral link [like this one](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=764316b2-fde3-4e79-bc46-d3f9446604df) will net you a free 750,000 skill points when you log in, which accounts for like 15 days of training. You can use anybody's link, but hey why not use mine, right? :)
---
The first thing I did when I started playing last year was join EVE University. They are an extremely helpful hisec corporation that will teach you the fundamentals of playing the game. *BUT*, if you want to get into some real shit and have a blast, you can hit up my buddies at [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/), which is an ingame corporation (think guild) that specializes in having a blast PVPing (and we're all from Reddit!). We have a really great mentorship program for new players where an individual person will be assigned to you that plays in your timezone and has the same interests as you. We also have a crap ton of free ships and skill books and implants for new players.
---
Message me here, on Discord (Aimsucks#0001), or ingame (Aimsucks) if you have any questions.
---
The quality of which tends to vary quite a bit as far as what you can sell reliably. Of course there's always the ol buyback scam.
---
I don't know why you care you only have access to Skype to message your mother on mother's day.

Get back to work Elder!!!

Look at the MER, btw test has left us with 6 months of krabbing.
---
Please use that prophet shouting to preach the word to those in need in Central Russia. And stop offending those kind readers of this Reddit with your capitals!!!

Repent today for tomorrow we die.

Sounds like you're not being a good missionary.

Doom is a Hillary voting-for cuck who would eat the creampies of other guys from his girlfriend, IF he could actually get a girl to hang out with him.  I mean, seriously, his alliance is a fucking irrelevant joke.  One word: ULAX.  Everyone in Eve saw that trap coming from miles away yet he and his cohorts insisted on humiliating themselves and getting thousands of caps trapped.  Dude is a disgrace and should be sued for libel, but there's really no point to that, because you actually have to have assets to make litigation worthwile.  Seriously, for the sake of humanity, suck a shotgun like the massive anonymous cocks you suck at glory holes and pull the fucking trigger Doomchinchilla.
---
Please put your shoulder to the wheel I pray this time you will listen.
---
Stop abusing you P-day internet privileges.
---
There's always one guy in fleet that does that. It happens lol.
---
good job test, who is the next in line to reach 1m killmails?
---
No just do your job and get off Reddit. How many souls have become forfeit because you have this addiction?
---
That wont work, KWG bots for example, they "report" intel. basically they put eyes, when someone enters a specefic system, all ships warp to the POS. 
---
Only thing that counters bots, is blue scouting. and work something out to catch them without burning your blue alt.
---
So here are just a few of the many threads that come up when you search "tips for new player" under r/eve alone.

&gt; I don't have a problem with accepting when I am wrong.
---
Goddamn tourists coming here for 3 days and leaving thinking that more than 1% of the population can actually stand eating that rotten traditional garbage
---
I would really love to be able to fucking copypaste PI factory clusters.
---
Why does your mother cry, because her son does lie. Please get back to work or I will call your mission president.  This has gone on long enough.
---
I think this would require a LOT more than "dual" boxing.
---
I would rather CCP stay silent than speak  that coule lead to a witch hunt, IRL threat and doxing like were able to see against some players (judge, kenshin things and so on).
---
I would definitely prefer that CCP correct their investigation system because to be used like that ( if it was a real attempt) it is a huge problem.
---
If some csm members wanted to damage brisc which is possible or not (nobody can affirm one point over the other), sure ccp should do something against them but not publicly.
---
Csm members can have suspicion, only CCP had and has the tool to investigate. They took the responsability by rushing things
---
Add the alliance as a contact with negative standings so that they will always stand out in local chat.
---
ACTUALLY WATCH LOCAL.
---
Move out of Caldari space where majority of code seem to hang out.
---
If you insist on mining in highsec and dont want to move to null, then relocate to a 0.9 or 1.0 system with a level 1 security agent.  Run security missions until you get a L1 Unauthorized Military Presence mission.  This is easily clearable in any decent frigate, and cakewalk in a destroyer.  Clear the enemies, collect the item.  DO NOT TURN IT IN.  Keep the mission open and mine it out.  It has about 130-140 million isk worth of ore between its two pockets and will stay open until downtime.
---
Being in a deadspace pocket does not make you immune to code, but most of them are too lazy to bother probing people out and will instead go for the low-hanging fruit. 
---
Being in a 0.9-1.0 system provides a large amount of deterrent as well as Concords response time is fast enough that many gankers tend to avoid activity in those systems.  Again, you are not immune.  You are just stacking the odds in your favor.
---
Kree?
---
IDK man. I'm having fun. I have daily ops.
---
It sounds like you/others just need to join a group that has more fun.
---
Yours is today. There are souls to save so empower yourself through prayer and save them you beautiful missionary in central Russia.
---
Dispersions will not make your two years the best two years.
---
You should probably quit then.
---
I don’t think removing that edge case is bad - Why shouldn’t a HiC be able to sit and tackle a super and expect that to stick? They can’t be repaired in that state anyway, and due to the bubble penalties lose most mobility, I don’t see why being MJDFG immune would be a bad thing overall if we want to see more supers die in the game.
---
Join a newplayer orientated group. Joining a group is probably the most important thing you can do as a new player as people will teach and help you understand and grasp the game. This game is a PvP game remember that, even if you're mining in highsec its still a PvP zone, so you should play it as such. Apparently "Eve University" is a good place to start (member of "Ivy League" alliance), Brave Newbies and Pandemic Horde are much bigger groups where you'll be one of many, so it might be harder to engage with them or feel like you're really part of something rather than a number in a fleet (this can change if you step-up and do different roles in your alliance/fleets).
---
I see you subscribe to the CCP method of justice. Accuse someone with absolutely no evidence, by making unsubstantiated assumptions along the way.
---
Stop, listen,  hear that sound. It's your fingers on a keypad...get back to work.
---
Board ship
---
Undock ship from station
---
Open map F10
---
Select nullsec(0.0 - 1.0)
---
Fly there
---
Get destroyed by capital umbrella
---
Drop salty tears
---
Get reborn in station
---
Repeat until no more tears.
---
Now u are a MAN.
---
Whalecum to EvE the land of Snowflake tears.
---
So get back to the people Cactus.
---
I quit because I became a bittervet, and bittervets get triggered when they see this kind of stuff on their reddit front-page.
---
Canada back, nobody actually gives a fuck about connectedness here. The vocal minority has that twat pm wrapped around their finger and now we look like a bunch of sensitive dick pouches. 
---
Fuck him, fuck them, fuck political correctness.
---
Don't be afraid to go to low sec and null sec.
---
Even if it means you'll sometimes die, if you can afford to replace your ship, it's a great experience and a good way to make more money than sticking to high sec and being scared of ever leaving it.
---
Once you have a bit of money, go explore the universe ! Even just roaming around without stopping is a great way to check out what it has to offer.
---
Well you get what you paid for. Actually you are quite a bit more than you paid for actually. The purpose of free accounts is to remove the financial barrier to entry for some new people. It is hook you into the game so that a subscription(or plex) comes a more attractive option. The limitations are a part of that.
---
Removing that limitation just makes it more likely that people won't pay more money. Do you really expect CCP to give you more without getting anything in return?
---
people who want to continue having fun for 2, 3, 4 or 20 years?
---
&gt; You can also connect to the Twitch chat servers using any IRC client 
---
I wondered about this. Easy to make fake viewers yourself with clients, or bots with eggdrops and energymechs.
---
Not just delve, dude. This would impact every null empire. You think delve is super special? It would change Esoteria, it would change all of Test's space, it would change everything the Russians do. If the rumours are true and NC. logs in it would change their shit too.
---
"Personal motivation" is describing YOUR personal motivation, not a collective motivation among all participants. The total amount of firesales from any given outpost eviction was available for exploitation to a dozen possible players. Maybe less. It's utterly insane to claim that firesales are a significant motivating force to initiate or sustain conflict.
---
When you describe "the enemy's loss," you're conveniently forgetting about all the ships they lose in combat, all the infrastructure they lose in the conflict, all the evacuating of assets and the loss of morale. I guess none of that matters, but the tiny handful of people who firesell their shit after an outpost is lost does?
---
A shitload more people engage in industry at any given time than were in the narrow slice of people who couldn't evacuate, yet were active enough to put up a firesale during the small number of wars resulting in outpost conquering in Eve's history. There are individual structures out there with trillions available for looting. That's actual assets, not shit you acquire at a discount.
---
Oh, it would actually be dual boxing CPM wise.
---
1st box: Fax
---
2nd box: Drone commander. 
---
Rest of accounts - assist drones on the commander and leave them be  (or the 2nd option, I always forget)
---
&gt;  from what I can tell personally he is completely legit. 
---
In the past he was a major figure in gold farming/selling in other games. He's a dirtbag.
---
They don't meow I checked
---
Its just a game man, it can be replaced.
---
We need, as players, to start creating content that attracts people to the game. Giant blob fights are cool in theory, but that's not the only thing Eve needs. Empires need to be responsible for their own actions. It's literally the eve equivalent of pollution. All of the risk aversity pollutes the game and makes it more boring and bureaucratic, or outright impossible, for anyone to do anything.
---
CCP, r/eve, EVE Online in its entirety
---
no u tho
---
\*injustice
---
I'd say B, C, and go fucking kill them.
---
Get rid of asset safety.
---
Stop helping us horde stuff. Make us pay for being a bad. How can you expect the market to get better if things don't blow up and die forever?
---
Make citadels easier to kill. 
---
CCP has made it  cancerous beyond the tumour level. We thought POS spamming was bad, wtf CCP? Krabs keep krabbing, more and more is in our wallets. So much ISK that any noob can buy and plant a citadel. Make them more expensive and make them easier to kill like they are in wormhole space.
---
Change the upwell system jammer mechanics. CCP has made it seriously cancerous to invade systems. We want things to blow up, you are preventing that CCP.
---
It's almost as if CCP wants their baby to fail. We are constantly krabbing, rich beyond rich. Make objects mean something again. "OMG IT'S A TITAN"! Remember that? Remember when it meant something? It doesn't mean anything now because CCP made it too easy for people to buy things that are meant to be expensive.
---
There needs to be a Galactical Recession.
---
New Eden needs to start becoming like Old Eden. The reason the wars started in Old Eden was due to RESOURCES! In reality the amount of mining per m3 in this Galaxy has already out weighed the actual celestial mass of asteroids, moons and planets. There should not be the same "replenished" m3 of all the glorious ore that we are mining. 
---
Anokis 2.0.
---
Resources are meaningless now. No need to fight over RESOURCES because everyone can sit and make the same amount every single day.
---
Make things special again. Make it meaningful. Battleships used to be meaningful. Look at what they have become. Wormhole rolling paper weights and throw away insurance jobs.
---
Bots are better at reliably dscanning than human players.
---
Real players don't know if hostiles are around either. 1 of 2 things can happen:
---
They undock anyway, which makes them just as vulnerable as bots. The difference is the bot already ran for 10 hours and will run for another 13 after the gank, so he just factors in some more losses and is still gucci.
---
Or they don't undock and the change drives activity down and there is even less to shoot. 
---
Both don't seem to me like magical solutions to botting.
---
Cloaky camping or roto jumping until they whitelist you works just as well as getting a blue alt lol.
---
I keep forgetting you can do drone assist...
---
If they equalized all character attributes, removed skill caps on alphas, make alphas train 0.5x normal speed, omega accounts train at 2x normal speed, and throttle back skill injector caps to 30m SP it would have the same effect. Not that anyone wants this at all, because they dont.
---
His mistake was clicking approach and thinking the game would do the rest.
---
DUDE... challenge accepted.
---
Loaned without any collateral?

---
Almost haven't logged in since that war, but I guarantee you that there is still a guy that wants to bring a Drake to every fleet...
---
So, what did the rolls look like?
---
And hunting bots is bad. It’s a PVP game, if delayed local ever become a thing we’ll all have to adapt and mash DSCAN, because it’s your life and death.
---
Delayed local mostly helps the bots.
---
Must be a meme, but that's not code per say, it's hydra roleplaying
---
No ?
---
The bots will have to add a script to constantly mash DSCAN, so hunters will have to use either fast tackle ships (= Interceptors) or cloaky ships/Combat recon that can negate the DSCAN.
---
And if you can’t press the V key once in a while, you deserve to have a blowed up ship.
---
You want frags, fights and explosions? Then leave the fatigue system as it is. If not then you will bore the life out of power blocs and this game will surely die. It's bad enough as it is due to citadel and jammers being cancerous.
---
Do the tutorial, do some highsec “security” missions to get a little isk and learn a little about combat, join Faction Warfare to kill people and make more isk.
---
Cloaky camping IS causing this.  As a casual player why log in?   What’s the point.  Look @ Delve, it’s new player base is burning down because of it.  Hardcore null’suckers adapt and create content around it.  New players die and say F’it.  Other games after a period of inactivity log you out... EvE should try the same.  #CCPlease fix this crap and you’ll see a return on investment greater than any ship or skill injector “balance” will create.   Let the downvoted begin.
---
Even my high sec alt's Vargur and Mastodon agree.
---
Except the Provi. Sorry Fenrir.
---
Imagine if u/CCP_Falcon actually worked for a real gaming company...
---
man i wish i had a custom flair
---
Why you keep harping on about profit from firesales when I already explained that they are not a primary motivator and barely mentioned them in a half-sentence in my original post while conveniently ignoring the rest of the posts?
---
And neither do I understand why you are mentioning the satisfaction of destroying ships in an argument about the satisfaction of destroying structures to be honest.
---
Baited on a free querns post?
---
scripting dscan on cooldown is far more reliable than mashing dscan on cooldown as a player.
---
Bot or bot apologist?
---
When NazAlGhul starts posting propaganda, this usually means war is soon to follow!
---
You guys don't run links drakes? Because if you do, then you'll have a drake in almost every single fleet that utilizes them.
---
It expires May 12. I was thinking about doing an AMA that week sometime, or maybe the following Saturday, idk.
---
&gt;Real players don't know if hostiles are around either.
---
good
---
&gt;They undock anyway, which makes them just as vulnerable as bots. The difference is the bot already ran for 10 hours and will run for another 13 after the gank, so he just factors in some more losses and is still gucci.
---
The player can cooperate with other players, and when someone attempts to gank them they can fight them off, while the bot just dies
---
What are you talking about? In the context of asset safety, the only thing you've described is a desire for firesales and a desire for conflict. Hence, why I mentioned the "satisfaction of destroying ships" -- that's part of seeking conflict. Conflict is what you're after, right? Not firesales? Which is it?
---
Hey buddy, if you happen to kill the initial objective and lose more titans only to have the objective revive itself the next day or two, I think that constitutes a loss.
---
Only point I will say is when you're deciding on a nullsec home, "join goons they have the best industrial setup" might not make you happy. All the big null empires have solid industry backbones and their own culture. Join the one that has people you like being around and doing shit with. Or at least sounds like it.
---
It's hard to really get a feel for it without looking like a spy, try talking to some line members in the different groups on Reddit. They'll all be biased towards their own alliance. :)
---
I just came back a few days ago so I can't even really speak for Test, but they seem way more chill than the spergfest I was in 3 years ago lol.
---
Happy cake day good sir.
---
Test's got Brand Newbros too, and it's a fair bit smaller than Brave and Horde. Also, having been involved in all 3, less toxic.
---
I would assume this is a virus
---
Why use a drake when you can use an actual command ship?
---
Yes, although with 4.5k vs 4k cold it's hard to really do a whole lot. Closing the gap with heating was the right move for being aggressive but it was a bit too late from Radakos here. If he weren't just approaching he could also have maybe aimed ahead of the wolf's turn, or started to disengage himself and made the wolf have to come in to secure the kill. It just comes down to getting those last few km to catch web and scram and hopefully survive with aar inside that range.
---
Realistically though this is a pretty difficult fight for the Ares to win 1v1 because the wolf tracks decently and has great speed. The best chance the Ares had was when the web landed for a brief moment; if a scram had landed in that time then it would have been a very dead wolf, especially if the Skiffs suddenly gained the presence of mind to add drones.
---
Have an alt remote seboing your ceptor. 5k should do it. For true instawarp ceptors you’re rolling the dice on the server ticks, anything else gets caught.
---
Weird cuz every time we go into protostarr's home they all they seem to want to do is yacht roll their connects, maybe this was the only way sleeper could actually get any content from you.
---
9 out of 77 is a poor formup for your own home defence , and 3 of that was the ceo lol
---
You made it to reddit frontpage!
---
https://i.imgur.com/uDRDsH6.png
---
Not my cup of tea, but back in the day you couldn't just buy that ingame. MMO are grindy, services like were providing a shortcut for money. Now you have skill injectors and all sorts of similar stuff, directly from the gampe companies.
---
I'm not saying a retraction but a correction. I also stated that I expect CCP to inform publications in which it appeared out of good faith - not that those publications have to run the story (unless local convention or law states that they should) - so the publications involved are informed and can take appropriate action where they see fit.
---
Or that same person that is working on shield slaves that took 5 years to come up with a name.
---
you seem mad
---
You guys should deploy to Curse and go fuck with wicked creek / scalding pass botters.
---
EVEO is strictly window replication, you can technically cap fps manually with Windows CPU affinity but ISBoxer is a lot easier for doing that
---
Asic miner btw
---
theres that too. 
---
but he was the first one to inovate they way people streamed. when streaming was at its infancy
---
Gold magnate with 50mn, snakes, drugs, links &amp; black hole.
---
Warp off, get into another ship. 
---
A HAM Drake should be able to clear most sites. As an alpha you might struggle against the spawn with 8 sleeper cruisers. 
---
They only spawn once. After you kill them, you can come back in a venture and be at peace. 
---
Always loot the wrecks it's worth it. Salvaging takes some good skills. You might need a ship with salvaging rigs which is definitely not worth it for you. As getting a third ship in the whole takes to long. In that time the gas you mine is worth way more.
---
Am i missing all those Keepstar kills for some reason? The only fortizar that im aware of that got killed by ravens was the holesale one and the guys almost failed several times even though they had the numbers advantage. It actually was an unnecessary risk if you ask me (which you dont ofc).
---
We have been using boosh ravens since 2017 and to claim "they spread around the game fast" is weird to me. Why not include some killmails and/or fights that were won by boosh ravens to show us that "wave"?
---
So i had a look (you know maybe im wrong... who knows): There has been ONE (1) legit boosh raven kill against a fortizar that was "defended" and not just a casual structure bash since the eviction of HK in rage and thats the holesale one. 
---
So lets dig a little deeper: There have been 2 single fortizar kills that were made with comps that look like boosh ravens. One in WH space ([https://zkillboard.com/kill/76070270/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76070270/)) but it was undefended (not sure about first reff and armor timer so maybe a case here?). And the other one in providence which was also undefended but also looks like they had lots of backup ([https://zkillboard.com/kill/75903693/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75903693/)). Maybe im biased but those two kills dont really demonstrate anything other than they applied enough dps for long enough till it died. Then there has been what looks like one op with 3 fort kills in nullsec which all went uneventful also and could have been achieved with any other doctrine really.
---
To stretch this into a "wave of using this doctrine to evict wormholers" is ridiculous.
---
Dwarf, could you please explain a Cancer Judy doctrine? Is this a fleet comp with Mordu Legion ships?
---
He once broke a rifter in half (the usb hub)..... bob clearly does not like him afterwards
---
Nobody tell him about capital bumping.
---
Yea, looking at it now. I run a few 2060 card and at 9 screens in EVE-O it seems to turn the fan on. So, going to read up and swap so I can throttle fps. I have a dread of a 9 man dread bomb!
---
Yes - don't play it. Live your life. be happy.
---
Low sec gas (cytoserin?) are just as valuable as wormhole gas, if not more. They need no tank, but they're only found in lvl 3 gas nebulae, so take a bit of time to find. You can mine 40m-80m isk worth of gas from a single site. You can try consulting the Eve University page about gas mining. It's the gas starting with 'cyto' that's worth mining. The other gas starts with 'm' but is worthless.
---
Let me just say, what without a very specialized fleet comp, the Nightmare is nearly impossible to kill, all while he is decimating your fleet.
---
I heard hagilur was camped last weekend :o
---
because it then costs additional plex.
---
One day our civilization will crumble and a new one will arrive and discover a husk of what humans used to be. My hope is the future archeologists find a naz post and think it's our bible
---
&gt; If they get rid of him you know they won't replace him
---
idk what the source on this is, it would probably be not terribly difficult to find someone else to put in the post - unless peligro builds most of the technical tools needed to autodetect bots, for example.
---
Cancer Judy's are rokhs, fit to shoot out to 300km, it's the exact same concept as boosh ravens, but rokhs; NC. Released the comp during a syndicate campaign against INIT to counter their boosh ravens, worked perfectly.
---
Later on SkillU adopted the comp to roflstomp on XiX in the drone lands - You can watch a video of Skillu using them here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVB9FgjMArE.
---
For gas huffing your tank is your speed. If it's a venture you benefit from warp stability. If it's a Prospect you can just cloak up (always orbit the cloud between 2000 and your miner range, never ever stop moving).
---
For sleepers you need to kill them with a combat ship if you want to continue mining the cloud after they spawn.
---
And Karmafleet and Ascendency in Goons too
---
To be honest, while I replied to your comment it was more broadly directed at the dozens upon dozens of threads/comments of people demanding media outlets print retractions. I think we both agree that it is CCPs issue to retract/correct. Any media coverage would be optional unless landed by local regulations (if those do exist but I’ve seen none so far).  👌 just tired of all the outrage tbh. Both in the beginning and now with a bunch of people having no idea what they are talking about. (Again. Broadly directed. Not at you specifically)
---
I'll give him this much, I don't think I've ever laughed so much at one self righteous prick on the internet.
---
So he's good for something at least.
---
Then quit tapi lmao
---
I believe you can gas huff in any ship with turret points.  There are only two ships that have any kind of bonuses for gas huffing so while it's probably not worth using a different ship, it might be interesting
---
I want the character attributes to be equalized, just by itself. Right now training leadership skills and a host of others is real painful because a Charisma remap is generally not worthwhile.
---
Onion head
---
Earl grey? Camomile?
---
Agreed.
---
Considering many people find mining relaxing, I can fully believe that people are using his stream to help them get off to sleep without risking their own ships, hence a larger proportion of people being on his channel AFK after he leaves.
---
Similarly, Streamfleet channels when ending a stream raid other streamfleet members meaning that they are less likely to have people AFK in their stream remain in their chat. I cannot attest as to whether MarkeeDragon raids any other channels but I would imagine based on those numbers that he doesn't.
---
As we have learnt recently, not everything that could look bad is bad. If you have concerns, it is right to report them to the appropriate channels but to bring about a public shaming before any investigation could take place is not appropriate or necessary.
---
There is often a simpler explanation that foul play and, now more than ever, we should treat people as innocent until proven guilty.
---
Wonder if Nolak will get a second look :thinking:
---
Well, I contributed to that, by going from 5-6 active accounts down to two. Finances plus some burnout. I got out of mining too, which negated the need for so many accounts. I even sold one character. Working again now, and expect to activate at least one more account, to satisfy my own need for skill injectors.
---
Exploring is sick.
---
My current method of exploring is to get from Hi-Sec to Null through WHs to avoid gate camps. You can't control where you land in null, but with a bit of patience can finally splash into a region with decent Relic sites.
---
A 5-6 hour jaunt usually makes me 1 billion isk.
---
You just have to have your wits about you to avoid getting ganked out there. Every pilot you come accross is either trying to beat you to the juicy sites or gank you.
---
I don't mind getting ganked, I just mind the ganker stealing all my hard earned loot!!!
---
I completely agree with you and figured we were looking at the same problem through different eyes, hence why I wanted to clarify :)
---
Who cares? Are you saying they won't still be there? Like in between matches people are just going to go to the store? Let them. Just keep streaming and they can come back when people come back to watch the next match.
---
There are probably hundreds of people that would take their positions for them and be there to work the entire time.
---
It is a great read and I loved the anal~~ogy~~
---
fixed for u friendo :)

Why would you though?

Transfers cost $20 cash, or $40 worth of PLEX.

This is the official soundtrack of this post. Don't @ me.
---
I didn't know there are any goon opponents on CSM.
---
Skill injectors is one of the main reasons I've had no interest in ever coming back to EVE even when they released the whole Alpha/Omega thing.
---
As a pitchfork manufacturer, you're making my industry suffer.
---
As someone that has attempted to do so while leafing roams several times, can confirm.
---
Make it easier to gank bots
---
This is shit
---
Why? I just came back to start running and flying in small gang, getting into corp deployments, and creating more intelligent content. I do not believe I have to be responsible for awoxing test ratters or to stop every bot-aspirant behaviour in the game.
---
Instead of believing empires are going to disappear overnight, be the change you want to be IN the large empires. Make nullsec fun again.
---
Haven't been in either of those. Not a big fan of the way goons do things in general; the whole "weaponized boredom" risk averse culture has never inspired me to consider joining. I know there are deployment groups and sigs that actually play eve, but I hope for the sake of the game they infect the rest of goon culture.
---
Pretty sure the skillbooks for alpha-usable skills are pretty cheap though.
---
Am I the only one who still 100% believes he did it and the only change is PA forced ccp to come to their senses on the amount of effort to put into a dying game?
---
but do joes cust
---
The time to update on a daily basis all your char won't tho.
---
Thank god a naz post now all is right in the world!
---
How’s this for a theory: ppl like markee because they just do. 
---
You don’t have to. But some do. Weird right
---
But it didn’t revive itself.
---
it's still common to hear someone say "can I bring a drake?" as a meme, but there isn't anyone who actually flies one anymore.  I think I've seen an average of one meme-drake in fleet every 6 months.  We did use them as entosis ships for a few months during the invasion of ESO and "defense" of the DRF.
---
I dunno man, every time we roam to Goon space we have really fun fights.  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004716/201904250400/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004716/201904250400/)
---
None of them. Just someone that want the game’s risk to peak up.
---
I’ll ask you the same question : 
---
Retarded carebear or retarded nullseccer ?
---
PH of NC.  Close race.
---
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!...
---
Oh wait... he can!
---
So you didn't like the idea of retards stepping into expensive ships they dont know how to fly?
---
Lol please. I'm having the time of my life. I'm someone who never runs out of things to do and even can't catch up with all my projects. It will be rorquals and me at the end of this game.
---
Doesn't change the general state of the game for others.
---
no the reason for free accounts is to encourage P2W, and whaling. just the same as every other f2p game.  
---
If they were interested in making the game available to more people they would do plex sales, to supress the price in isk, so more people could afford them.
---
Small gang fc
---
Yeah I don't know what I was thinking. Was alpha but got wind that having more characters was good for either future multiboxing (hi incursions and wormhole farms) or skill farms. Ended up alphaing 10 accounts in my spare time
---
Two big items I would suggest.  
---
1. Don't wait for XYZ skill to unlock to play.  
---
2. Make friends.
---
command ship &gt; command dessie &gt; link cane.  Bringing a link drake is basically saying "kill this dude first because he's the only drake on field and obviously carrying our info links"  At least in a cane fleet the ghetto link ship blends in with the rest of the alpha ships.
---
Roleplaying code after killing a miner in null is pretty fun.  Give it a go sometime.
---
This is EXACTLY what I've been expecting since last week.
---
Plain common sense.
---
The shit really hit the fan on this one. I think no one involved had the slightest clue of the possible consequences of their actions.
---
Mistakes where made, starting with Brisc essentially doxxing himself. Something was leaked, be it intentional, accidentally or in good confidence, whatever. Someone snitched and ccp dropped the hammer.
---
Drama unfolds. Oooh the popcorn.
---
Realization kicks in. This can be a real Live-Changer for everyone involved. Brisc, CCP, the snitches , everyone is going to hurt if this escalates any further. Just imagine this going to court, wherever, anywhere. International something something. This could potentially ruin everyone involved. Including CCP.
---
Brisc went silent, CCP backpedalled like Louis fucking Armstrong on fast rewind.
---
Believe me, those ppl were going overtime full steam the last few days to figure out the legalese to save everyone's face.
---
CCP taking the blame was not the easiest way to accomplish this, it was the only way.
---
We'll never know what really happened as it will be NDA'd. And I don't care. Another one of those legendary stories that make EVE unique.
---
I think this is the best solution because at the end of the day, remember that this is just a video game, and I think a video game shouldn't ruin anyone's life.

Delve is the face of most problems with this game. That being said if you think this is all about delve then you are being a sensitive snowflake.
---
Just as in real life, specializing in something narrowly focused is a huge personal risk.    
---
If the specialization didn't exist, it wouldn't be special as everyone would do it, and it would ultimately have no value.
---
I was half expecting an anecdotal point about you guys getting a fun fight out of goons (my experience: they'll give fun fights when they roam to YOUR space but get off their lawn) but no lol they just dropped supers on you.
---
Uh, yeah... in real life death is permanent.
---
Lolwut
---
I'm saying that instead of a 6 hour day, it would be an 18 hour day for the organisers and competitors. That's a big ask on Jintaan and co. just so that you can watch it live instead of a day later or whatever from the comfort of your sofa.

On more serious boosh Ravens are pretty gay both to fight and fly but I think they're just a symptom of shitadels being so awful to fight on grid with. Defanging would fix 90% of the issues
---
Before the announcement, was there any evidence he hadn't done it besides "it doesn't make sense" or "ccp is full of shit ?
---
I know this sounds really snobbish. But for some people lack of isk to buy plex in game is not a big issue.
---
I think you get a killmark if an NPC delivers the final blow and you were the only player-source of damage.  Maybe you could shoot a player in a combat ship, switch to the freighter, and then have the NPC deal the killing blow.  You might also be able to do this with a citadel, if you fire a bomb, undock a freighter, then watch the bomb get the kill.  It should show as you getting a kill in a freighter with the standup bomb weapon equipped.
---
Thanks!

Thank you! I had no idea it was given cakeday for me lol

No lives or value to society. Pretty much sums it up.

So why didn’t you just say you don’t like Markee Dragons stream? What makes you think this is worth a Reddit post?
---
We get it you like watching other elite pvpers, that’s not everyone’s cup of tea. So you come to reddit to try to defame a streamer because he does mining and industry streams? Get over yourself.
---
Markee Dragon has a very public and open past in the RMT business and I believe is even making(already made?) a documentary about his experience with this. Welcome to Eve, everyone here already knows who Markee Dragon is and that he is a krab streamer. So maybe instead of trying to stir up a witch hunt about some presumptuous bullshit that’s already common knowledge, you could support eve streamers and lift up the community. We are a rather small but dedicated group and anyone creating positive content that’s not legit scamming people(like that streamer that “streams” afk “giveaways” all day for your ad revenue but doesn’t actually give people their “prizes”) is a good thing for this game.
---
Stop encouraging everyone to join goons or any other massive blue donut Corp. It’s nice to help a newbie and most of this stuff is great, but this game is stagnant bc no one fights anymore. At least suggest alternatives that don’t just turn every newbie into a risk-averse turbokrab.
---
It can still be done, it just takes a little more effort.
---
Not just mods! I too, am gay!
---
Cloaks should be like ECM. No, not worthless... but run on a cycle with a probability of failure. 10 min cycle with a 15% change of failure (scaling down to 5% chance with cloaking V) is fair. Differing from ECM in that when it does fail it doesn't recycle and they are permanently de-cloaked until activated again with 100% cloaking chance to start.
---
What does metagamed mean
---
ok but be gentle.

gentle.

I was thinking of maybe doing it in a cormorant, or try to get a gnosis, i can't really use that many ships yet, also i don't believe the venture has gas cloud mining bonuses, it says it has for minerals, i'm not sure if it affects gas clouds, at least i don't think so
---
What amazed me was to see that the footage in the trailers really was from inside the client. It really does look that gorgeous.
---
That was my first appeal in EVE. It cost me my n00b ship :-).
---
It’s only ever getting more beautiful.
---
indeed
---
I convinced a GM to reduce my perma ban to 2 weeks, so there's hope for some of us :)
---
Does the Prospect have an integrated cloak system? Last time i saw, only Omega users can have cloak devices, so, will i even be able to fly the ship?
---
Eve provides a great outlet for many neurodiversities.
---
You do know Goons and every other entity are getting fights, especially lately ? TEST/Brave and FRAT. have had several capital brawls lately, Goons are taking part of those fights on a less invested part, Horde is getting fights on a regular basis too.
---
&gt; At least suggest alternatives that don’t just turn every newbie into a risk-averse turbokrab.
---
They are here :
---
&gt; There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
&gt; Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
&gt; Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
You give CCP way too much credit.
---

That logic is silly. You don't get people dropping thousands of dollars on your game because it's F2P.
---
Skill injectors
---
RIP Gypsy Band as well, they weren't major sov holders, but my alliance flew with them sometimes on major ops.  The wonder of being a newbro in 2012
---
That's why I said you/others because I wasn't sure if you had the same complaint or if you were just echoing the sentiment of others.
---
I agree with all of your points. But at some point the player needs to take their own fun into their own hands. This is Eve after all. There's content out there. If you don't like what you're doing, go somewhere else. If you're bored of krabbing, don't stay in a group that would rather krab than fight.
---
However, it costs less plex per character skill queue on average that way. 2 MCT + sub / 3 chars is less than 1 mct + sub / 2 chars.
---
no.
---
hey you're a pretty smart guy here's a solution i've been thinking of
---
what if there was an active citadel module, maybe mid slot, and it goes like this - you can make every ship on grid warpable for anyone who's on the citadel's acl
---
Step by step: [https://eveskillboard.com/guides/transfer](https://eveskillboard.com/guides/transfer)
---
Oh look, another person who thinks that the solution to everything is to have sales and gimmies.
---
PLEX are a secondary subscription method, always have been. Essentially, they're CCP's way of getting in on making money through RMT in an official capacity. Frankly EVE could have gotten away without ever offering PLEX or any similar subscribe-using-game-funds method, but it offers a possible route to basically allow the sale of the PLEX buyer's time for the seller's IRL money.
---
That the price has inflated is irrelevant, because this fallacy that PLEX are supposed to be easily accessible to every player is dumb. It is just another trade good. This bullshit notion that everyone in EVE *deserves* cheap PLEX necessarily damages the otherwise free nature of the economy.
---
As has been said for years and years, if you're playing EVE just to make the ISK to PLEX, then you're on a fucking treadmill and might have a problem if you find the feedback loop satisfying. You say p2w, but at least now there is some method through which people can play without having pay, and while it obviously has restrictions, it's better than it used to be where you couldn't play at all unsubbed.
---
Finally, it's kind of disingenuous and self-harming (in the sense that you are discouraging playerbase growth) to claim alpha accounts have no bearing on new player introduction. It's certainly a higher amount than the old, what was it, two week time limited trials?

---
Doomchinchilla is a piece of shit.
---
No, it costs more. The NEED here is 1 toons per account, with omega state. It's not to farm injectors. The injectors farming is just a way to lose less per account. Making an alt with +5 to farm more does only cost the initial investment.
---
Remember than extracting those 60 accounts costs a lot of time. Extracting 60 more COSTS double that time.
---
Not really, there would be no reason for people with high sp alts to pay to keep them subbed at all ever

This won't ever come back to bite init. Ever. It just cannot happen! Nuh uhhh!

This is cute, but doesn't change the fact that charisma is extremely limited in its applicable skill trees.
---
Perception and Willpower dictate all the zoom zoom and pew pew, Intel and memory dictate all the tanking and banking (I wanted to keep rhyming, anyways I mean industry and research); but charisma dictates... Very little in the game, whether or not you do combat.
---
Wall of text warning.
---
Let's look over the problems in your write up: 
---
Now what kept snipper battleship setups out of the meta historically ( or well put pressure on them where faster cruiser doctrines that could hold them down and well kill them ). 
---
As the sub warp mobility of battleships is REALLY bad, given you give up a lot of tank/utility for the range it often means that t2/t3 cruisers will beat you if they get in fighting range, something that's highly likely because there faster so they get to pick range. 
---
This is what changes because of chain booshing, you on grid speed is completely irrelevant. 
---
Now i write this because let's look over the solutions: 
---
&gt; 1. DISALLOW THE MJFG-ING OF HICS WITH THEIR BUBBLE UP. 
---
This wouldn't solve the issue it would make it easier to catch boosh ravens to some degree, in reality a 0 landing just means you kill a couple of command destroyers before there booshing again, now in a wormhole this is more problematic because it means you will lose a couple of pods for a couple of pods on there side ( trading pods is almost always in the attackers favor ) because they tend to be the ones that come in with pod advantage. 
---
&gt; 2. MAKE THE MJDFG GIVE AN AOE SIGNATURE RADIUS PENALTY DURING USE
---
This solution fails on multiple levels. 
---
Let's assume it's 150% your turrent dreads are not gonna track command destroyers ( as the need cap guns for the range ) and well your target isn't gonna be webbed because of range. 
---
So you have to pop ravens, the reality is you will be able to swap the ravens with cerbs and do the exact same thing, the ravens are doing now.
---
Unless you make the sig bloom penalty massive, but then i suspect the offensive use of them becomes way to strong. 
---
Along with this being a nerf to AB based snatch setups.
---
It's humor, not asking for salt.
---
Skill caps, not item restrictions. Reading is hard, I know.
---
Over 10 tweets in one day... yikes.
---
You can buy PLEX with ISK.
---
Can somebody tell me what a claoky camper is? I know it's someone who sits in null cloaked but what's the issue with them.
---
Not memeing honestly don't know.
---
if they are actively killing in the system you have 15 min before they can kill you.
---
Because farming more than one character is a net loss.
---
It makes you wonder if CCP or the GM's ever have a clue or if they're wearing blind folds, and throw a dart on a wall of names to figure out who to ban.  I'd like to see their actual  process (if they have one) that the GM's follow.
---
Probably because it's just dumb to not use is boxer with your setup.
---
Small gang fc does not prevent you from being a carebear. And sadly, Providence is just a region, there’s multiple of those.
---
That would require reworking the way they gate keep what shit you can access seeing as they do a lot of it by "you need to be omega to have the skills to use this" removing the skill caps effectively does that
---
You know what's better than a lambo?
---
Oh huh, you're right. Skill farming is a really slow loss over time, it looks like.
---
How long has it been this way?
---
I bet this dude lobby's oil, lol thanks for your service to our world
---
That is the real question.  This mess with the "Fountain 3" now calls into question every GM banning ever done.  Does CCP have a process or is it all knee jerk reactions or who is more believable?  Is evidence collected and if so, 20% of the time?  50%? More? Less?   Pandora's box is wide open and now everything will be questioned.
---
This entire conversation is pointless because it's not going to happen, but yes, rework is implied with every change. Luckily, it's probably all documented this time around instead of the old days where the server code was not documented at all.
---
Drake has 6 mids and a resist bonus, cane has 4 and DPS bonuses.  Relying on random chance to avoid your links dying is garbage, and even that assumes your enemy is too dumb or lazy to see which ship the bursts are coming from.  Even in a situation where both die, it takes more DPS to kill the drake than the cane, so now I'm ahead in the DPS killing race.
---

hi friends
---
You can board empty ships directly from another, yes.  Not sure how that interacts with killmarks though.
---
You realise you can just ignore them yeh?
---
Not relevant for this exact situation, but stop mining. I feel like so many new people mine for a long time then quit the game. Mine or do missions enough to save up for a t1 exploration ship with a bare necessities fit. Hop into wormholes from high sec and do relic and data sites. A million times more fun and way way more lucrative.
---
I only run two accounts. Also we fight all the time, but we don't tell our members to bend over and lose ships because someone has a superiority complex.
---
Not grrrcat but I don't think that would fix it. Mjd and citadel's both need a nerf. I still think the objective should be getting frags
---
Also your flair is out of date. Shekel was lame
---
well the drake is absolutely better at the job in isolation.  you're not really relying on 'random chance' with a cane though.  If you run a cane fleet and have a single drake in the mix, you're basically just hoping your enemy decides not to shoot it.  If you run a boosting cane, they at least need to look for the one that's boosting which is easier said than done.  We're talking about an alliance that can easily fill a fleet, so you're looking at a ball of 100+ canes all clipping into each other while anchored trying to find the one that plays a burst effect every 2 minutes.  Also considering the fleet size, DPS is not too relevant because every ship gets alphad.
---
Rust is lighter than steel, thats why they are so fast.
---
Sad part about this, Brisc apparently was doing what a good CSM member was supposed to do - listen to the players and bring those issues to the forefront to help the player base and ultimately improve the game.  For that he gets accused (we don't know by whom) and the CCP stazi kick the shit out of him on someone's say so and tossed in the gulag.  The investigation shows Brisc was innocent, the squealer(s) are hiding, CCP has egg on their face and there are a lot of upset people.  smh.

Exploration is your best way to make isk and is pretty entertaining, especially if you start exploring in wormholes. With a bit of luck, you can make 100 million isk in a couple of hours.  Here's a decent cheap ship to start with:
---
\[Imicus, Imicus alpha\]
---
High Slot: 
---
Core Probe Launcher I
---
Mid Slot: 
---
Data Analyzer I 
---
Relic Analyzer I 
---
Small Shield Extender I 
---
1MN Afterburner I
---
Low Slot: 
---
Warp Core Stabilizer I 
---
Warp Core Stabilizer I
---
Rigs: 
---
Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I 
---
Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I
---
Ammo: (to put in Core Probe Launcher)
---
Core Scanner Probe I x8
---
From there, you can add a Cloaking Device in a high slot (especially if you're exploring in a wormhole), get Tier 2 versions of modules (except for rigs).
---
Something else you can do: join a corporation. Social interaction is the life blood of Eve online and you'll be able to find people able to help you, answer your questions, and often give you a head start (free ships and skill books).
---
So.. what's keeping you away is that you can't come back and play for free to mine in a barge?
---
Time to place 3 bombers in that system and let them sit afk until they get comfortable and ignore them.
---
Brutix is bae
---
What is a good price if i want something hauled from npc null sec to jita?
---
The whole point of a Drake is to be harder to alpha than a cane and cheaper than a command ship.  You take it in situations where either the fleets can't alpha it easily or they'd alpha a command ship too so you reship/bring redundant Drakes instead.
---
Even in situations where the Drake might get alpha'd too, it's over twice the EHP of a typical cane.  That means you need twice the number of canes cycling on it instead of volleying 2 or even 3 canes per arty cycle.  If you let me trade 2 or 3 of your DPS for every 1 of my links ships, I'm gonna come out wildly ahead even if your links stay up.
---
join a new bro friendly wormhole corp. NOT a null blob

This is the EVE that I love.

It was pretty hilarious. We were easily ISK positive. We also killed a retarded Hyperion on the way:  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30003953/201904250300/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003953/201904250300/) 
---
We also dodged an Erebus boson when we went into Delve. It was fucking great. I've never had more fun. No sarcasm intended.
---
I think eve needs decomposable aggregate functions first
---
I suggest doing some security missions or combat sites to learn how to fight in this game about space fights. Otherwise fit an afternurner and orbit the rock at 5000.
---
While the article is correct about the tactics etc. I see this proposal as an overall bad idea.
---
Game has too many citadels and not enough ways to effectively take them out. So this CSM is proposing to further reduce effectiveness of one of the few such ways. Going further, the game lacks, and not just lacks but **extremely** lacks tactics which work or at least partially or situationally work in spite of n+1, this CSM is proposing to effectively remove one of the very last few remaining ones.
---
CSM Jintaan proposes to further reduce already pathetic effectiveness of sub caps vs capitals and supers in one of the last remaining niches.
---
CSM Jintaan further proposes to make it even more difficult to remove and deal with excessive structure spam.
---
CSM Jintaan further proposes to make Delve as well as any other botsec blob space safer, naturally and as expected.
---
CSM Jintaan  further fails to make any proposals that would actually deal with the games main issues, such as large region / area content denial mechanics.
---
CSM Jintaan further fails to propose anything meaningful that would affect the current status quo and at least help shift the paradigm, such as for example adding more nullified ships / modules instead of less into the game.
---
CSM Jintaan fails to come up with and/or propose with anything meaningful that would work against n+1
---
CSM Jintaan fails to propose anything that would make taking out structures quicker and easier as it needs to be
---
My overall feeling from this proposal is that CSM Jintaan is just fishing and spewing more self serving crap for CCP to swallow hook line sinker in order to negate the effects of some of the recent already grossly inadequate capital and anomaly changes.
---
Overall, while this change in itself is small, it is a wrong step in the wrong direction for the game.
---

Damn, this is twice today I've been trolled into reading a post like this. My guess is you're either trolling stupid hard or you're about an hour into the game? There are dedicated services for this. Also, someone could just do a public courier contract.
---

Nope. Just maritime. I tend to fight the oil guys.

Wait, I wasn’t before?
---
CCP was metagamed.
---
That's right, they should stay in hisec and mine themselves till they quit right?
---
And if you do deny it with threat of legal action
---
&gt;As CCP originally found him guilty there was something dodgey that happened regardless of whether he directly did anything.
---
That's not how it works.
---
&gt;Oï !  
---
&gt;So, recently I've been looking up the Tech Tree of EVE Online, and I often stumble on some ships that I can't imagine really ever being used, in a PVE or PVP application. But maybe some of you guys out there like them, and if so, why ?  
---
&gt;Example : I've seen a lot of ship, but never saw any of the Navy Issue battleships, the sole exception being the Typhoon Fleet Issue...  
---
&gt;So, what're your thoughts on this topic ? =)
---
Vedmak.
---
Both PvE and PvP. It is sub par in light of Kikimora and Drekavac, and yet, I find it more fun then both of those. It can do PvE content that a Kiki can't. PvP wise its weird because you have to hang back a bit then fast burn to target while unloading mad DPS on what is basically a glass cannon fit. The best thing is people do not primary it because everyone thinks they suck, so you can take advantage of that.
---
On PvE front it requires very active gameplay, much more then any other ship in the game and its capable of doing T4, T5 Abyss as well as L4 and equivalent difficulty content up to 6/10 DED sites and escalations.
---
hah,  the bot master is smart,we try today but failed.may i can try your suggest.
---
If your goal is to fight bots, this will ensure that only bots  do ratting while players won't mostly take the risk anymore. If you're looking for no local to harass people, well... Go to WH I guess?
---
The bot solution should not in any way affect regular players.
---
This is the state of mind people who have issues with "lobbyists".
---
They are so enamored with the perceived scarecrow low-key communists have created for them that they lose any kind of sense.

I believe an appropriate anecdote is a notorious high school senior bully trying to steal a 7th grader's bike. He sets up an elaborate and typically overwhelming attack and makes his move to find a gang of ragtag middle-schoolers ready to fight for their friend. Senior says "I can take some tweeners" and then proceeds to get bloodied and run off.
---
Blobbing says you. Bully control says we.

Venture has gas mining bonuses, 100% on yield (role bonus) and 5% per mining frigate skill level on duration (so max 25%)
---
All they need to change is so that you don’t appear in local until you decloak, this would help with catching bots, get a hyperspatial ceptor an it’s easy. It would also help with the over security of nullsec. Just my opinion
---
Do whatever the hell these guys did: https://zkillboard.com/character/96521842/
---
Venture has a 5% Gas Harvester cycle speed bonus per level. More importantly, however, is the specialized cargo bay that can hold the gas. If you use a turreted combat ship, your cargo space will be severely limited. You simply won't be able to carry near as much of the gas as you would in the venture. A rough estimate would be about 10% the carry capacity.
---
I have a better idea.
---
Come join us over at GasRat Cartel, we'll teach you how to huff, clear sites, make T3 components AND boosters as well as give you a FREE Prospect if ever you skill into one!
---
We can always use more huffers over at GasRat Cartel, contact Kentaro Alfrir or Lady Data in-game to learn more!
---
A shortcut yes, a shortcut made possible by buying gold wholesaler from people running sweatshops filled with people farming gold for 12 hours a day. It's just as bad as all the RMT we whine about today, if not worse since bots were not nearly as sophisticated back then. Mark was heavily into this exploitative world of video game cheaters,. I for one will not give him a thin dime or a second of attention he may gain from.

---
Yourself already said this is not a good idea
---
Triglavian ships are already very strong, they don't need Ewar
---
Asians are doing EvE the right way.

You can, though, you just can't use those skills.

this is the way this game was meant to be played

---
The only tea in Eve is Salt-tea.
---
Thank you for your reply :)
---
Sadly, I do think the HAC will follow the trend of the heavy assault cruisers we already have : excellent application and speed, and with specialized fit it could have the tank of a battlecruiser.
---
I mean what are you asking for?
---
Do you only want to use one fleet and not have a disadvantage vs people who can be flexible and field multiple different doctrines?
---
Nice.
---
It has been going that way since ccp stopped plex sales.
---
Well it makes super ratting more difficult too, encourages people to use lowsec and adds in a risk for an all too risk averse nullsec activity. I agree the botters may adapt, but at least it adds another layer of complexity for it.
---
just remove local
---
What they will eventually get, I hope it's not something binary.
---
I just wish there was something it was useful for other than getting cabitals dropped on it.
---
Look on the bright side, our average accounts per player slowly keeps on rising ...
---
And let's not forget subsystem skills, which are split between two separate remaps. CCP logic best logic.
---
The issue with using a tankier ship for gas huffing is that your Gas Harvesting skill limits how many harvesters you can have active on a ship. And with the Venture's role and skill bonuses to harvesters, you're going to get more gas out of a Venture (or Prospect) than any other ship. (If you get to Gas Harvesting V, and slap 5x T2 Gas Harvesters onto a Gnosis or something like that, you can pretty much match the Venture; but that's 'match' not 'beat' and also training Gas Harvesting V is an Omega thing.)
---
The nice thing about gas huffing though is that, because of how effective a simple Venture is, gas huffing is a zero-investment money printing license.
---
if you have more than 5.5 million SP you can extract those unusable skills and turn them into money
---
Terrible idea, but how about projected heat? Some sort of EWAR module that can be scripted to overheat the target high, medium or low slots.
---
Ook ook
---
Because people fly more based PvP doctrines.
---
I think he is asking, if the triglav line were to be extended to include all hull types and classes, what might be the EWAR option for those specific hulls.
---
I still enjoy the game, and will probably play until it closes. There really is nothing quite like it. 
---
But, we must admit when we are wrong, and learn from it, and grow.
---
It is someone who cloaks their ship in a system at a "safe" bookmark and keeps the account logged into the game 24/7 thus always being in local.
---
It is used as a "spend three days wading in the water until the sea turtles get used to you" approach to killing stuff.
---
Anyone wanting to rat/mine in the system cannot know if the guy is at his computer or afk. Since the character is always logged in then eventually they will just rat/mine with him in local.
---
Then we the guy does sit down at his computer, he can scan the system, jump in comms, and light a cyno on the ratter/miner.
---
The "issue" is that there is effectively no way to counter this- the ship is cloaked and therefore cannot be scanned down, therefore if there is a cloaky camper in your system then there is nothing you can do except go somewhere else. With the introduction of skill extractors, these characters can be farmed for their skill points to more or less break even on the cost of the Omega account (since you must be Omega to cloak). 
---
The counter argument is that cloaky campers are a nerf on ratting and mining in nullsec.
---
Specifically, OP was asking how people run (CPU wise) dozens of cloaky campers while still being able to play the game on their main(s).
---
Because the nature of Triglavian ships and how players could obtain precursor skills and bpc, they don't need Ewar in their shipline
---
About 20 M skill points are marked as Alpha, but you will stop training when you reach 5M skill points.
---
So you can train into a battleship and get good gun skills for it, but then you're capped at 5 and you can't train any other faction, missiles or drones, even if they are Alpha skills.
---
Trig's ewar is a faster spool up time, just look at the tiamat
---
Exactly.  Perfect answer.
---
This guy is right, OP. You replied the correct way.
---
No, please drop $2000 to P2W Eve.  I need a juicy Titan kill on my KB.

You are correct, I'm thinking the Triglavians' ship line will expand to all hull types that the empires currently have.
---
if you target the sleeper and type /consent off , they won't touch you and you can mine the whole cloud while your sleeper buddy defends you from pvp.
---
&gt;It sounds like you/others just need to join a group that has more fun. The most krabbing I do is keep a vni going while I'm online.
---
The fact that you have to keep a VNI spinning instead of getting what you need to support yourself via your primary activity pretty much speaks for itself and perfectly illustrates a good portion of complex issues the game has.
---
+1 Delay null-sec local.
---
The points are useless now though, they are used for nothing. You have to register on his store site for every giveaway and it's one entry per person. Stream points no longer used for giveaways, unless something's changed again recently.
---
That's not really accurate. You're not wrong that the game is stagnant, but these bigger corps/alliances have TONS of resources to make things smoother for newer players. Sorry the game isn't as cutthroat as it was in the good old days that you remember, but today's players aren't going to spend weeks bashing their heads against the wall in a game they can't figure out. They're just going to play something else. I'm not saying that's good or bad, just that if you want to retain new players, you've gotta make some sort of effort to show them the beauty of eve behind the walls of shit
---
A lobbyist isn't a politician though.  He'd have a strong case that he's not a real public figure.  Also I assumed his case could be about the NDA and not libel/slander.  You can't simply claim someone broke a legal agreement and walk away.  The other parties usually have legal recourse to challenge in court whether they have actually violated the contract.  I'm not a lawyer though so maybe NDA are different than other contracts.
---
Agreed. The way to get the most out of it is exploiting both its drone bonuses along with its weapon bonuses, so that you'd have about roughly 50-50 damage split between weapons and drones (which then allows you to get more than 1000 dps on the Praxis).
---
Not only that, the ship itself looks very amazing and so is its warp animation. Simply perfection.
---
This is an aphrodisiac. Use responsibly.
---
The rifter bit back though, cut his hand lol.
---
ewar that weakens remote/local reps would be cool
---
Makoto has posted the translation. But I would also like to say the system in question is Hatori in the Bleak Lands. 0.6 system.
---
We've had people rush there and scour it. Both Core and Combat probes over the whole system and 20 AU around it, nothing out of place. So for now we're just watching it and trying random tinfoily ideas there.
---
&gt;AFK Cloaky camping IS causing this.  As a casual player why log in?   What’s the point.  Look @ Delve, it’s new player base is burning down because of it.  Hardcore null’suckers adapt and create content around it.  New players die and say F’it.  Other games after a period of inactivity log you out... EvE should try the same.  #CCPlease fix this crap and you’ll see a return on investment greater than any ship or skill injector “balance” will create.   Let the downvoted begin.
---
This is an unfortunate side effect. AFK cloaky camping is de facto necessary in the game to at least partially counter the vast networks of intel bots. If CCP clamps down on one they have to clamp down on the other or the game will run away in completely opposite direction even worse then it already is. 
---
The second part of your issue is unfortunately pioneered by non other then your own coalition. As a new player in Delve you are most likely in Karmafleet which is part of goons. Goons have basically pioneered mass runaway krabbing and capital proliferation. Sure it was there before and was/is being done by others too, but not even remotely close to this scale.
---
So now what is happening Delve has become major target for any ops that are meant to put even a little dent in it. They don't succeed very well, but they want to. As a new player, you a re collateral damage of such ops.
---
And drones.
---
Aww, lazy null-sec ratter doesn’t want any risk?Just go ahead and bitch about non-consensual PVP.
---
Don't buy anything from local anywhere, unless it's being sold by a corpmate that you've known for at least 1 month.
---
They *could* trigger a salty reaction from some people though
---
Being an inbred, sister-fucking nazi has obviously ruined your.... everything.
---
It would be, and it would make sense with their background (orange filament cloud I think?).  Furthermore it might be better for smallgangers, ramp-up might help mitigate faxes, and since it doesn't touch EHP, it could be made more powerful than the resist damps would be.
---
OTOH, it's no help against strong buffer fit.
---
Good idea, wish I'd thought of this!
---
IF TOU CAN READ THIS - YOU ARE THE RESISTANCE.

---
Except...the tournament is still happening the exact same way. They're just not live streaming it. They have more breaks in the middle, that's all.
---
And, either way, my point stands: There are hundreds of people that would gladly do the job for them, if that's the issue.
---
I love that the simple t1 Hurricane is the #1!
---
Its cool. CCP has only had 2 years to update the tool. This just shows that CCP is not interested in doing this. 
---
I have operated the tool for both AT practices and the "spectator" mode and tbh if they updated to tool we could run tournaments without CCP needing to be involved. 
---
Thunderdome is great but if they ported it to SiSi (which more people have access to) we could do everytjing there. Patches would be up to date and no worries about interferance because it teleports to jove space. 
---
Bottom line is CCP saves face saying they will support player run tournaments but actions speak louder than words and their actions speak very clearly.
---
There was such a thing as low sec before FW as well ;)
---
If the sowrd disconnected
---
Looks like it was AFK
---
Lmao, get rekt
---
&gt;That is very true. The CSM is supposed to work on our behalf and be transparent.
---
The CSM already ***is*** working on behalf of the GSF. Just take a look at the other thread on this page. 
---
Jintaan wants is going to push for CCP to make structures in major botsec blobs (but Delve especially) even safer then they already are. He wrote an article for you to read and put it up on INN even and is looking for validation to make it look "solid" as "players concern" for him to bring it up to CCP.
---
No joke, this sickening shit is actually real.
---
That would require a modicum of courage (and even that's a strong word to use) to enter nullsec that escapes the average CODE. pilot
---
They use asic miners these days

This. I use a rhml praxis and like u said i get about half drone and half missile dps

Afk people getting stuff is better than people actually watching his stream as a new player and hoping to get real game info lol. The one time I watched him an event was going on and he lost a 2b t1 battleship for looting someone elses stuff and got whacked isntantly when they sat right there hoping he would loot lol.
---
In games where it was legal/kosher with the developers. He does not do that with eve.
---
&gt;Also, disallow gate bosoning.
---
Actually, it'd be really funny if you let a gate to be bosoned and the gate then spooled up and fired back some sort of a super doom interdimensional energy beam at whatever it was that bosoned it.

Dont like chance of failure to cloak.  My opinion on this is different.  Each charge is 0.1m3 and lasts for 6 mins.  Module holds 1m3 of charges and has a 60s reload time.  Allows sustained campinh but not 24/7 afk cloaking.  Also rewards people for spamming dscan and using combat scanners for that brief period of uncloaked.
---
Damn shame I can’t make it to my computer for another hour or so. The Semiosis thread must be going *wild*.

---
I'd normally agree but if a CSM member did act in bad faith and decides to run again we should be given the details to allow us, the people who are supposed to be represented by said CSM, to decide if that CSM member belongs there.
---
If the CSM did nothing wrong then releasing the details will show that and none of the CSM's would have an issue with that.

Buying gold in WoW from Blizzard was not a thing back then. Gold sales were all  illicit RMT and he got quite rich off of it. That he doesn't do that with Eve doesn't make him more honest or legit, it just means he's deemphasizing his history to keep his brand profitable.

Any suggestions on which corps to look at in that regard?
---
Gluck off fobby
---
Stuff dies all the time in nullsec, even in what is supposedly the most secure region (Delve).  It just takes a little effort and research to get kills.  You can see the pattern if you spend long enough in theta coms.
---
One of the few games where "footage captured in-game" isn't a white lie.

---
&gt;CSM Jintaan further proposes to make it even more difficult to remove and deal with excessive structure spam.
---
I was literally on the CSM that pushed CCP to stop working on navigation structures in order to implement Low Power mode lmao. Without this CSM you guys would still be rolling with Void Bombing citadels and 2 week long timers that happen regardless of fuelling status.
---
This goes along with, dont trust anyone in this game. Not even friends...family is even a risky click
---
lol well, the more people the less safe it is, delve is only the safest region for people flying rorquals and supers. The whole reason is the super umbrella and I would love to see them drop titans on a vni that got tackled
---
I’ll for sure be there !
---
least the Shekel knee pads are not wore out and they dont have a tinge of something white and flakey on the lower lip....
---
Even there I see Rorqs and Supers dying fairly regularly.  Not everyone's on coms and paying attention.
---
If it was super easy to do, everyone would do it. If everyone was doing it, it wouldn't be worth doing. Pi is annoying to set up, and annoying to maintain, and annoying to move around. Not hard, just annoying. That's what keeps prices up.
---
I mean it kinda makes sense to split from a realism aspect.
---
True, but if you look numbers wise, the percentage of rorquals and supers dying in delve isn’t high compared to regions like malpais and the spire, where almost every super that undocks gets dunked
---
Doesn't matter. 1 character will be the cloaky camper. Running cheaper +3 implants. And 2 running +5 implants. 
---
On it's own it's a net loss. Close to a billion per year. But you can utilize the 2 other characters for building slots for your super cap production. And researching blueprints. 
---
You could even use them for PI if you hate yourself. 
---
Skill farming on it's own is a loss. But it's also a way to recoup some of the ISK you spend keeping the account active and making more isk with other things.
---
oh right, another "i want free ratter kills" thread, masquerading poorly as an "i want to solve the bot problem" thread.
---
TBH Id be saying the same thing if this was an all PanFam CSM and a PL CSM member was banned then readmitted under the same circumstances. 
---
The CSM was setup as a response to CCP's lack of transparency. 
---
Now even the idea of transparency in the CSM level, nevermind at CCP, is laughable.
---
Right now the CSM is another tool for CCP to hide behind and use  as a distraction or way to avoid blame. When its supposed to be an advisory council representing the interests of the playerbase. 
---
If CCP got the details from a CSM member and are doing nothing about it we should be told why.
---
If they only used the CSM as a way to justify the ban (Which people on r/eve have been trying to push as what happened.) Then both the CSM and us should be demanding to know why.
---
CCP's complete refusal to discuss this is the problem and its another sign along with the end of the AT (No I dont believe CCP will bring it back.), the failure of CCP to support the community organised Tournaments in any way and the lack of communication on a monthly basis shows they are  no longer interested in building the community. They just want us to stop asking questions, buy as much plex as we can afford and then some and pay our monthly subscriptions to Rorq mine like the good little whales we are.
---
I mean you name the problem yourself why the doctrine is a problem specifically in wormhole space eviction defense is almost always fighting outnumbered like it was a freaking miracle in the HK eviction that lazer so early. 
---
Now the issue with fighting out numbered is that you normally use faxes and carriers and dreads to make up for the lack of numbers, now ravens completely destroy that as an option as well the doctrine is well strong against capital defended structures, this means realistically as a wormhole corp if more ravens then you have members show up your best play is pray they get bored, now most groups likely would not say this publicly it's kinda bad for member moral, the doctrine also has the ECM effect in that using it feels really boring and fighting it feels worse. 
---
The reason i suspect this happens is because almost all of the meaningful decisions are moved from members to the FC so the feeling of having a impact is massively reduced leading to a doctrine that feels boring. 
---
This is for me personally with despite it not being fielded daily in wormholes it's a doctrine that has a negative impact on the space rather then a positive one and there for needs a nerf ( yes that's a long way of saying i don't like it please nerf it ).
---
Haha.  And yet they still undock?  What is wrong with people.
---
Maybe not a virus, but it sure is a good way to lose your CC info so ccp can get your money for a new sub.
---
&gt; lazy null-sec ratter doesn’t want any risk?
---
aww, lazy nullsec hunter doesn't want to put in any effort to get kills.
---
Snakes are helluva drug.
---
ok seriously can they just get to the point. this crypticness is getting annoying instead of mysterious
---
Maybe this is how CCP introduces the Forward Operating Bases. Have the Trigs use one in an ingame storyline first then have Upwell reverse engineer them for mass production in a few releases time.
---
&gt;I was literally on the CSM that pushed CCP to stop working on navigation structures in order to implement Low Power mode lmao. Without this CSM you guys would still be rolling with Void Bombing citadels and 2 week long timers that happen regardless of fuelling status.  
---
&gt;I feel like people don’t remember the state the game was in in 2016 and how much worse it was than now - With the exception of Ansiblexes negating subcap fatigue.
---
You were also on the CSM that removed nullification from ceptors and was/is pushing for more stuff to make your space safer.
---
You were also on the CSM that defanged cap changes and got us the current joke PR shit instead of some real changes.
---
You still are on the CSM that is fighting to preserve regional content denial mechanics ***instead*** of making opposite changes
---
Just for starters ...
---
On the other hand it would make space even more safe then it is now. And would inflate the economy even faster.
---
Top notch analysis! I really like the expression of how the ranges affect the volumes of concern. Something we've all been dealing with but to see it represented so cleanly and precisely is nice :)
---
us? yes.
---
investors? ha, they know exactly where their revenue is coming from.
---
That's a good way to lose trusted client status with every CC provider ever, have 3 years of retroactive chargebacks dropped on your head, then get arrested for collaborating with credit card fraud.
---
That's just an added bonus.
---
I pretty much only do it for ADMs. I have better isk making methods if I actually need something.
---
"Oh, we had no idead that those cards were stolen."
---
I tried watching that stream once, 5 minutes in he starts eating lunch, 2 minutes later half his lunch is in his beard and that was about all of the stream I could take.
---
&gt;You were also on the CSM that defanged cap changes and got us the current joke PR shit instead of some real changes.
---
We argued for the cap changes to be harsher than they were. I personally requested - as noted in the minutes - to remove the point and web from support fighters and replace them w/ damps and paints, as I feel that tackling should be an important subcap domain rather than a captial one.
---
If you don't think FozzieClaws were a problem, you didn't fight in Sov Warfare at the time.
---
And, I'd like you to provide evidence to that last point as I personally have argued for buffs to the Cyno jammer (which we got), nerfs to Rorqual mining safety via Mobile Depot and PANIC nerfs (which we got) and nerfs to Bosons (which we didn't get). This is all on the minutes, publicly recorded by CCP.
---
Free skill points will makes this all better.
---
Definitely not any indicator of how the PIBC wave will turn out.
---
A little OT: Many game information site I view in Italy usually host their channel viewer in auto play, this way every visitor counts as viewer... Everytime i pause the stream to block the counter.
---
Is it considered viewbotting?
---
Can I report to twitch?
---
Maybe people should spend half the time they spend writing CCPls article actually countering doctrines. And yes this was basically only an elaborate CCPls article and you need to explain doctrines in CCPls because CCP doesn't understand the game. Kinda sad.
---
the man loves spaceships and ass
---
Sounds good to me.
---
Come to nullsec, and you don't have to worry about CODE.
---
I've used [BlackFrog](https://red-frog.org/black_calculator) in the past with good success. It has been a few years though.
---
Haha, I love this cheese. I guess the only counter would be the 'ransom caracal'
---
Well people don’t know what’s going on, that’s how everyone dies in those lol
---
just fit it with small remote reps in high, and let the enemy wonder wtf the reps are coming from.
---
Ganking is not pvp.
---
All these changes would do is force people to hover under umbrellas. 
---
I can guarantee that none of these changes will make people go after the goons or test or panfam krabs, they just want it to be easier to go after the people that don't have an umbrella to fall back on.
---
Idk if he's using a bot or not but you can achieve this with a good computer and isboxer and that guy you are talking about is always in comms...
---
The Music is very nice and the pvp action is actionful.
---
I don't know what your Discord name is, but I'll go ahead and offer my apologies for the way I responded and my multiple "get fucked" messages. Most of my ire was directed at your real-world profession, which I still disapprove of the very existence of, and the fact that you do so in Virginia. I suppose it's not your fault the system is the way it is, but that doesn't mean I have to like or approve of it. However, I was wrong for what I said, I apologize for my comments, and I am glad that you were reinstated once it was revealed the allegations were false. You never should have been banned preemptively as you were, CCP really dropped the ball on that, and you certainly did not to be treated the way that you were, including by me.
---
No lol, it can pack a 50 m3 of drones, but the bandwidth is still 25.
---
Or was I baited into some pre-drone bandwidth existence reference?
---
Don't be in a rush to join a corp/alliance yet. Also don't join Goons. Nobody likes Goons except goons and they don't have a good reputation.
---
EvE University ?
---
I think local should make an audible noise when a hostile or neutral enters system. That way everyone who wants easy kills can go to WHs and compare sizes.
---
Or small beam lasers.
---
I bet you can rap out Mike Jone’s phone number, doesn’t mean he’s produced any solid tracks in the last half a’ decade.
---
But no t2 gun :p
---
Holy shit dude calm down
---
Shit is different
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2016-04-27/
---
You can still do the tag thing
---
Oh right, didn’t realize that mb
---
I thought that's what multifit is for
---
I heard it from a reliable enough source that I posted it. Make of it what you will. 
---
 I wonder why all of the CSM members are now mum after promising to make a statement regarding it?
---
You are going about it wrong - firstly you need to define what you enjoy about eve. Do you want to do industry, PVP, exploration? Once you know what you like, look for a corporation specializing in that, in the space you want to try (Wormhole, null sec, high sec, low sec, whatever) 
---
If you don't yet know what you want - I think just stay in an NPC corp, or join one of the corps that takes new players, but I would do that only to find what your gimmick is.
---
PvP with large groups are market manipulation
---
you too
---
You'd probably fit in with Pandemic Horde. Or else if you want to stay out of nullsec for a while, you could look up RvB (Red Federation or Blue Republic or something).
---
Let's first of define the term hard counter vs soft counter: 
---
In my mind a hard counter is something that will remove most of the win conditions from the hostile fleet to the point where really they can't successfully fight. 
---
ChemoLokis, really are not that effective because you still have to chew truth a good 35k ehp for the command destroyers, i mean it works better on the init version then on the Sound/HK version but it feels iffy either way.
---
LR Dreads honestly have tracking issue's with the command destroyer and feel iffy in there application against ravens, it might work but doesn't feel like a hard counter ( i would barely call this a soft counter ). 
---
Distributed Carriers Not really you might be able to spread fighters but like if the ravens have 5/6 ships on fighter cleaning your crying. ( i think the Sound/HK setup deals better with this then the Init setup ). 
---
Slippery Steves can work, but the problem with them is there way to slow in disabling the command destroyers if we look at the hole sale fight well they use a slippery doctrine and just lack dps to clear enough of them fast enough as you need a really high kill rate of command destroyers to force the ravens off, then you need to somehow utilize that advantage to prevent the ravens from returning, you kill rate has to be really high to make a meaningful impact this way.
---
What's worthing Lyao here?
---
I have already stated my point and you did not respond to it.
---
What? you can do that? that seems too easy, way too easy...
---
Wouldn't a Curse work better?
---
It really is stunningly beautiful.
---
Just look at the suns. What they are today versus what they were ten years ago. A-ma-zing!
---
You are saying that you think it is unfair that you have to form a specific fleet to counter boosh ravens.
---
I am saying that should be intended. If someone brings a unique and specific doctrine and you don't have the tools to defeat it, you should lose.
---
chineese soul reaper core... pretty safe to assume they are all bots
---
Neuting stratios are hard to brawl, but they have relatively low DPS. Burning down his drones will take forever, but so will burning down his tank. I wouldn't want to engage a Vagabond, kitey or otherwise, Deimos, Sac, Proteus, Gila, anything that shits out a lot of dps while being reasonably tanky and not having too many cap problems, either by being capless/passive tanked or cap injected. A lot of solo HAC fits meet this standard. Might even be able to do some weird passive tank blaster Eagle lol. Now I want to try that. Might lack enough room for tackle to be good tho.
---
You definitely have an easier time if you can kite him and tank his drones until he runs out. Omen navy is a good pick for that, as is the orthrus and cynabal you mentioned.
---
I recognize this couch. I shouldn't, but I do.
---
Just to get you ahead of the curve, here are the responses your going to get on  r/Eve.
---
1. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Eve is dead.
---
2. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Fosiesov.
---
3. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Bots.
---
4. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Chinese.
---
5. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE CCP doesnt care.
---
6. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Injectors.
---
7. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE its free to play/payto win.
---
8. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE did I mention the Chinese?
---
9. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE nerf Rorquals.
---
10. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE delete local.
---
11. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE nerf/buff my favorite ship.
---
12. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE nerf ratting anoms/OMG they nerfed ratting anoms.
---
1.  Sorta.  Changes in jump mechanics make it a bit more complicated, but on the upside dreads (and force auxillarys) have ship maintenance arrays and the same jump range as carriers now.
---
2.  Suicide ganking is healthy.
---
3.  Dodixie and Rens are not what they used to be.  Amarr is still decent.  Jita is the ubiquitous trade hub still though.
---
Astero's nice to go murder other explorers in too, as you can drop a mobile depot and refit for dual scrams (fuck your warp stabs). Watch out for bait. Part of why T1 explo frigs don't get ganked a lot is because of how often they get used for bait.
---
Join EveUni and learn the game, stay away from the null blocks.
---
go to wormhole space , issues solved
---
I've also seen shield prophs
---
BELO-CHERNO means WHITE-BLACK
---
The fuck is someone going to do, probe down the guy going 4500 in a frigate lol? By the time I get a probe hit and warp you're far enough off me I need to warp again. Maybe if I bring a 50mn svipul just to run you down but why?
---
Only if you're omega. If your account is alpha, you can't extract any skills that alphas can train, even if you were omega when you trained them.
---
heh heh heh.
---
If you haven't signed up yet, make sure to use a referral link [like this one](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=764316b2-fde3-4e79-bc46-d3f9446604df) to get 750k free skill points. It really goes a long way (15 ish days of training). The learning curve is nuts if you make it out to be. As long as you take the correct steps, you'll understand most of the game in no time.
---
The new tutorial is *phenomenal* and explains a lot of the basic ways to make money and do combat in the game. When I started I wasted a lot of time in hisec, or high security space, dicking around and doing nothing. In my opinion, the best way to play EVE is to just jump down the rabbit hole and join a nullsec corp like [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/).
---
We are super fun and we love new players. We even have a mentorship program where someone can help you every step of the way in your journey. We also hand out free skillbooks and ships.
---
Message me here, on Discord (Aimsucks#0001) or ingame when you get home (Aimsucks) and I will gladly help you get started. 
---
Trust me man, EVE is the best MMO you will ever play.
---
Then you MIGHT be able to defend the charges. You're still out of business, unless you think after being found untrustworthy by a private audit you've got enough money to sue Visa.
---
I've literally audited two major cases of this in the past year. We're talking billions of dollars. CCP doesn't have that kind of weight to throw around.
---
Just wait until all the Chinese players settle in... That graph is going back up soon.
---
I'm a Goon living in a Wormhole at the moment, so no. My idea isn't perfect - just an idea to bring some risk to Null while also making it easier to kill bots. Finding a WH null exit and seeing all the bots instantly dock up is frustrating.  I'd also find this a fun thing to have to deal with when back there. 
---
You could contribute to the discussion or continue to be a worthless highsec scrub.
---
I was thinking of the mass modification, but more on a general term.
---
Mainly, I think mass modification should be added to warp disruptor/scramblers, and later on have the warp mechanism changed from "required align verctor" to a timer based on mass. 
---
Typically, you gain X aligned mass per tick, depending on your ship size and warp strength, and you warp at the end of a tick if your aligned mass is equal to your ship mass.
---
This would need many tweaks because it would break the current game (you can't be aligned to insta warp so higgs become useless, you can't keep someone on grid indefinitely, insta warp frigs would not be a thing anymore).
---
With that done, points modules would become either add X mass to target ship,or add X% mass so they need more time to warp, and at the same time become less agile with prop mods. This also means the pointer should be subject to the same effect that it inflicts on its target, with some specialized ship  having a dedicated mass gain reduction.
---
how were dodixie and rens?
---
I am in WH space. The problem still exists when exiting a hole into Null.
---
Chemos got ninja nerfed you can't smart bomb till your sensers recal. Ccp didn't even make an entry in the notes for it.
---
I also think Eve University provides excellent exposure to the game. Also, their website provides a lot of information to the game as well.   
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
Does this "Invasion" theme point to Triglavian incursions as the next Big Feature?
---
It was a memorable event in 2016, after the first  Astahus had been built.
---
Off fuck globby
---
Used to be only slightly sub-par to Amarr.
---
Now they're more like old mission hub system markets.  You'll find some stuff, but not everything you might need.
---
Got any salt for me?
---
I'm a bit bigger than my bro, but if Mike Tyson punches either of us we're getting alpha'd.
---
Oh shit, I didn't know that. TY.
---
Likely so. Could even be a full rebuild of all incursion content, with a possibility for overlapping/competing incursions.
---
If someone writes to you with lots of salt after you gank them - that is good. Send the receipt as a reply. If they are totally fine and you have to try to get salt by sending them a letter first - that is sad.
---
How about a cooldown on appearing in local after exiting a wormhole?  Say, 30 seconds.  That's long enough to warp and get a point.  Something like that I think would be OK.  Close the hole or be at greater risk than you are right now.
---
Otherwise it is just another "I want free ratter kills" as Dave says, except he should add that there's no logic to the idea making ratters die very easily will result in more ratter kills.  It won't because there will be fewer non-bot ratters.
---
I think that EVE is better in groups. When I play alone I feel very lonely and isolated.
---
Trying to play this off like its bad for me that he is innocent? Lol
---
Im over here downing a steaming pile of my own words. But, usually i mean, thats normally the case.
---
The US is so fucked if you hear lobbyist you know its probably some sleazy fuckhead.
---
Sure, there are 2 versions that I know of. 
---
[Heron, Battle Heron]
---
Micro Auxiliary Power Core I
---
Medium Ancillary Shield Booster, Cap Booster 50
---
1MN Afterburner II
---
Warp Scrambler II
---
Relic Analyzer I
---
Rocket Launcher II, Caldari Navy Inferno Rocket
---
Core Probe Launcher II, Core Scanner Probe I
---
Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
Small Ancillary Current Router I
---
Small Core Defense Operational Solidifier I
---
Hobgoblin II x3
---
Warrior II x4
---
Navy Cap Booster 50 x54
---
Caldari Navy Inferno Rocket x1180
---
Sisters Core Scanner Probe x16
---
This is the version I use, you can actually swap the relic analyzer for a 3rd ASB, but I usually use it as bait, and the relic analyzer helps with that.
---
The otehr version it an armor fit with TDs. I don't fly it but an example can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=390&amp;v=Iqn7ngVY26E). You can also fly that fit with a plate and 3 TDs. The armor version is more geared to specifically hunting sabers, where the shield version is designed to tank asteros until you can de-fang them. Both versions will wreck any stealth bomber you can find though.
---
karmafleet sucks tried to get an awox alt in there and they didnt respond to me for weeks on end (the alt was clean and a few months old, looked like a new bro)
---
that analogy sounded a lot better in your head before you typed it, huh
---
true but look at my name :P
---
You *can* buy Alpha injectors, though that's bullshit in and of itself.
---
Knowledge
---
&gt;There are hundreds of people that would gladly do the job for them, if that's the issue.
---
And yet there aren't hundreds of these tournaments going on, so I don't quite believe you on this.
---
I believe that if it were possible then Jintaan would be doing it, as he's been working on this for a long time and has put a lot of effort into it.
---
Maybe he shouldn’t have broken the nda in the first place then?
---
That’s what zkill is for, no one takes the time to take a new alt and die a few times just to gank a random combat astero/bomber
---
I came back recently as did a lot of old players I know. Seems to be a good time for it.
---
1. Yeah you can do that
---
2. Yeah you can do that
---
3. the market shifts but how to trade hasn't changed much unless you're in citadel markets.
---
4. yup
---
I'd recommend getting your bearings then heading to a Faction Warfare corporation to learn how to PvP and make friends. If it's stagnant, find another group until you find a decent fit.
---
that's a great video!
---
nothing of value was lost.
---
Well that's a relief
---
In before some cuck says “how do you know they’re botting”. 
---
CCP, do your job and save our game.
---
I wish

Join a corp where you leader doesn't call you a retard
---
I have no problem with having several alpha accounts.
---
I have my main account which is subbed and currently 3 alpha accounts. Basically only use them to scout systems, run empire missions (I dont want to deal with empire standings on my main), and FW.
---
Though one of them is for my son, who's 8, tried the tutorial for the first time a few days ago, and got stuck because he decided to just warp 5 jumps away for no reason...
---
Kinda like how EvE was before the tutorial...
---
Great read but....who is Gunjar?
---
Trigs don't need ewar bonus.
---
Our dps is our ewar.
---
Except FAX pilots on that scale are quite literally the alt of a super.
---
Groups like skillu mandate that all members have fax alt. Faxs aren't glorified as the pantheon carriers RnK once were.
---
Solo fax in wormholes is probably the peak solo fax gameplay, however the lack of balance in wormholes, removal of combat refitting have removed much of the skill ceiling that groups like RnK reached and documented.
---
Solo small gang logi and tournament logi is what I'd consider to be peak logi skill.
---
Big ships aren't the "eventually" type end goal anyone should have. Their blatant overpower and wide margins of error make them among the dullest most uninteresting ships to fly in the game.
---
You cant level up skills alphas can actually use. Thats the problem.
---
Tree fiddy.
---
Please stop posting.   Tia.

1isk

Probably a pretty reasonable price really.

it's cheaper to just invent in the short run

God damn loch Ness monster....

The NPC Ralof has you take armor from in Skyrim

---
I have to wonder how many chevrons does this gate take, and how do I dial for atlantis?
---
If he was one of the best CSM members the level must be very low
---
Having local makes it too easy though, when we get null hole, we will exploit it, but then I have to worry about another more paranoid member/xo deciding that the local is too hot and rolling the hole while I want to go out and explore or huff/mine.
---
I don’t hunt in null, it’s not profitable to me right now, I don’t seek pvp for the sake of pvp, my KB is red and I dgaf. I’ll pop out to grab any ice, gas, relic, and combat sites I see though.
---
I get into plenty of scuffles with other explorers. And I’m definitely not risk adverse or lazy, lots of close calls at sleeper, gas and relic/data sites.
---
The fact that I have lots of close calls, and the occasional loss, while still making bank, shows, I think, that I’m out there doing a variety of things, causing things to move forward.
---
I’m a bit sorry for being so snarky with my first reply, but that is so overdramatic saying no one will do combat anoms if local is nerfed.
---
as soon as someone sees a curse they tho "oh neut boat" the entire point of this strat(ios) is the element of suprise
---
No one cares, they fucked up and apologized, story over
---
Was it expressly forbidden by Blizzard at the time or was this before they did that? If it was before Blizzard made it forbidden, what is the problem?
---
That's probably cus SP has a pretty well defined value. The cost of enough SP through alpha injectors is the same as if you just subbed and trained for a month because people squeeze any possible profit out of that margin until it's gone.
---
And then a few more people try squeezing blood from stone and the price ends up more than the value of what you get.
---
Does it include delivery to Jita?
---
Lol thank you needed a good laugh!
---
Well I thought Stratios was always another neuting boat, I mean, who fit lasers on it?
---
It's in Dodixie? Knock about 60B off of that then. That other guy was right though, cheaper to just invent in the short run. Would need YEARS before that thing ever became a real investment as far as what you get from it. Or, just sell it lol
---
You can extract skills that are omega only (like mining barges) while alpha.

You are not an ‘old EVE capsuleer’, you are a capsuleer on hiatus.

Im in iowa and whoever decided we are election important should be beaten
---
That's horribly disingenuous and you know it. When this poster wrongly says Eve is p2w you know he's primarily referring to skill injectors not fucking sub.
---
Wow that's alot of players. Last I thought about player count it was 20k or less
---
160
---
I had a fun thought while reading your comment, what if there was a sort of "barnacle" module, that tethered your ship to theirs, if they wanted to turn they'd have to pull you along, they could maybe even warp, but to do so they'd have to drag you with them.
---
Someone needs to turn that fight scene into an epic anime fight. With triple-D breasts and the ass of an Olympian.
---
It sure did! It was cap stable with 475 DPS or something like that, I forgot hahah. But yeahit was a blast :D
---
&gt; The fuck is someone going to do, probe down the guy going 4500 in a frigate lol? By the time I get a probe hit and warp you're far enough off me I need to warp again. Maybe if I bring a 50mn svipul just to run you down but why?
---
Well, yea :) The only thing I could think of is possibly some weird warp rigged nano sniper fit. But then again like you said, but why ? Just not worth the effort.
---
I'm definitely not part of "The people...". Think you got a little something there on your lip though.
---
Okay! so let's run with that one skippy.....I don't normally waste my time with people I consider retarded, much less make a Reddit post about it......keep sharing those TCU Killmails! Cheers!
---
well at least hes not some twitch thot. or a wife beater
---
I don’t think local should be removed, the gates are there, the empires put them there, they provide the minimum of communication allowing clone-jumping.
---
Now what could happen, is a cataclysmic event destroying null-sec gates, and giving pilot groups the ability to launch upwell gates to other systems, or bring them in pieces through worm holes. Then local as we have it now can be a rig on the gates.
---
Tuned in to see one of his Orcas get ganked. First time his stream ever had any content.

I was a newbie playing for a few months, doing mining/hauling, and started doing frigate shit for pandemic legion and TEST during the start of the Fountain War. 
---
I’ve been away for a long time, and I don’t remember shit, but I want to get back in to it. 
---
Can I get a run down of some fun shit I can do right off the bat? I remember liking relic sites, and mining and selling ore.
---
Wondering what race is best for frigate fiestas, and what’s best for mining/hauling. I remember my old miner/hauler was Caldari.
---
Down for some piracy if anyone wants some extra tackle. :)
---
Also quite possible. :3
---
you're an embarrassment to TEST and Sapporo said you smell like goat cheese

true story

So nothing has changed ? :D

😂

great video. also banging tunes. What was the second one with the "come with me to the dance floor" lyrics?
---
Sounds fun :)
---
Just a question : what Missiles were you using ? RLML, HAM or HM ? Thanks :)
---
&gt; You could contribute to the discussion
---
your idea is shit - just like it has been the million other times other people have suggested your unoriginal crap idea.
---
does that contribute enough?
---
Oh hey - silver! Cool! &lt;3 thx stranger
---
Using t2 bpos in anything but copy slots is a terrible idea for ROI
---
&gt; Ganking is not pvp.
---
Your personal feelings about ganking (getting ganked?) aside, farming exists so that gankers can gank farmers. Risk/reward is a mechanic that is inherent to core Eve game design. You can either farm in safe spaces (e.g. hisec) and get low rewards, or you can farm in risky spaces (e.g. nullsec) and get better rewards. You can find that much even advertised in many Eve trailers. What's the main risk factor in nullsec? You guessed it right, getting ganked.
---
Ganking is good for subs. One Rorqual getting ganked becomes content and a reason to keep subbing and playing for a fleet of 25-150 for a night. That's why the decline in player activity and reduction in ganking content are inherently connected. Ganking is not only good for subs, but it is good for the game's economy as well, for it keeps farming in check. Don't get me started on negative effects of unchecked, ultra safe farm on Eve's economy.
---
&gt; All these changes would do is force people to hover under umbrellas.
---
People are already as hovered under umbrellas as possible. Many changes actually make sure to undermine the umbrella.

&gt; I can guarantee that none of these changes will make people go after the goons or test or panfam krabs,
---
If you think things like mobile cyno inhib revamp then idk what can. Our recent titan kill in Delve shows that umbrella space is not much without the umbrella (the titan was inhibbed). The problem is that it's incredibly inaccessible/hard to pull those tricks. As a result, right now, safest/most organized regions like Delve lose only 3% of all their farm to gankers. That should go up to 15% in a balanced Eve, and up to 30% in the least organized regions. Think of it as a content tax that farmers need to pay for the health of this game.
---
seeing people in local isn't a problem.
---
an interceptor can warp to me faster than i can align out with a 100mn cruiser.
---
however, i have way longer than that because i can see them from 5jumps out because of intel channels. you can't exactly stop people talking to each other though, can you?
---
I will be more than glad for some free sp

---
&gt;To be fully transparent, this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the integrity of the CSM as an institution.
---
&gt;We would like to take the opportunity to thank CSM 13 for their transparency and their respect for the council as an institution, which was demonstrated by their coming together to condemn this kind of behavior and report it to CCP.
---
Either use your Ally's Hauler Service of ask those guys from [PushX](https://www.pushx.net/) they're reliable!
---
&gt;What’s the best cruiser platform for dunking a triple-nos/neut Stratios with a 300 sos omni tank?  Can it be done with a brawler, or am I going to have to hop into an orthrus or cynabal or something else that can kite and control distance?
---
You basically have 2 options. Either kite and stay outside of range, or go for a minimal cap use fit thus laughing at neuts. The kiting options are a bit cheaper and less skill intensive but harder to execute.
---
For the passive you can fit a HAM Tengu, Loki, Gila, etc. 300 omni tank is not that much and you will easily break it. Also Stratios will usually carry and launch a mix of drones, just kill the big ones, especially if you see a Gecko, or any heavy, your tank will take care of the rest. If your tank can't keep up with just mediums from Stratios that means he is fit with extra Drone Amps, in which case his tank is low so you can win the DPS race.
---
No what actually keeps me away is 800k sp in lvl 5 cruisers. I just used mining barges as an example. Ive checked my hero turns out it isnt that bad, but wasted sps are annoying af. It makes it optimal to create a new hero, on new account to get 750k free sp for refferal, and thats already too much effort, so its easier not to play.
---
I quit eve when they introduce bigger ad on the luncher, it ruined my gameplay..
---
Link where my specific idea has already been said. I'll wait.
---
Or just come play and make friends and don't worry about ship limitations.
---
Lol that’s so funny! Kinda like how it was funny when Tony Stark snapped his fingers and died, and Captain America went back in time and got old. LOL awesome tweet my dude! : ) lol xDDDDD
---
&gt; Link where my specific idea has already been said. I'll wait.
---
do a search and see it suggested a million times.
---
i'll wait for what you should've done before posting.
---
it is though
---
I just recently joined a new alliance after puttering around by myself in lowsec for a long time. My first day there a fleet was going out. Because I had Logistics V and Remote Armor Repair Systems V and a few other things, they handed me a 400M ISK ship kitted out with faction and deadspace modules to fly, and when I felt bad about getting it welped in an unexpected bubble, I was told "Don't worry, logi flies free."
---
No one drops 150b for the "short run"
---
copy time wise it actually comes down to the same thing
---
You're assuming that they don't re-sell the BPO later....It is an investment.
---
3.) Structures have created a sort of highway (mostly through The Forge) of super low tax, Hi-Sec, high volume trading.
---
him and his stuffed bears?
---
please tell us how you really feel im getting mixed signals
---
One for the collectors (no, not ME 2).
---
Which CCP can nuke anytime they want. Never ever see a T2 BPO as an investment.
---
I clearly said unless you sell it.
---
&gt;Yourself already said this is not a good idea  
---
&gt;Triglavian ships are already very strong, they don't need Ewar
---
Obviously a Trig EWAR ship would have to have lower DPS total.
---
I would welcome different EWAR in the game, some of these mentioned here are actually pretty nice, but I do fear that since lore wise the Trig are related to Amarr, they will just end up with neuts thus being kinda meh at best, unused and pointless at worst.
---
Seriously why is nobody on the CSM considering disabling cyno and panic from being active at the same time ? 
---
Like it seems the perfect solution as it encourages more subcap rorq defenders and well less cyno jump to rorq behavior. 
---
Looking from you post it seems like you want subcaps defending rorqs, so why allow them to be a unkillable cyno ?
---
Basically anyone that has decided to focus on making money in the game instead of shitty attempts at PvP will be branded a bit from now on.
---
Love or hate it, what CCP had done to Capital ships and Rorquals did gave many new players an strong incentive of keep grinding for the shinny big toys
---
Can CCP give me those?
---
It's so good I want to see the whole thing :(
---
It would take you about 15 years to sell 200,000 covert ops cloaks.  I'm guessing 1,000 a month or so and then of course with your constant demand, you'd raise the price of associated components (of which there are many with cloaks) and decrease the price of the cloak at retail, squeezing your margin.  So it would probably take even longer to break even.
---
You woulda sounded a lot better if you hadn't ranted like a mad lil bitch.
---
The ransom Caracal ? What are you talking about ?
---
Nice video =)
---
And got, the payouts you get from those wrecks ! I know you won't run into Curses with Cormack's stuff in them, but gosh, that's an expensive wreck, with 2 billions dropped!
---
The combo of disintegrator + utility high bonuses + formidable amount of armor + low mass is already very strong regardless of specific hull bonuses, if you break anyone of the Triglavian niches then why don't just design another brand new shipline
---
Wont matter as much when they allow t2 ammo from faction guns
---
Memory bad who were you
---
Nice link, highsec trash. You learn to copy and paste in the Special Olympics?
---
What Robbie said.
---
You counter cloaky campers with a cyno and friends
---
dude who asked what was up with the chef outfits.
---
&gt;even if it was done with ill-intent isn't the solution.
---
Can't disagree with you enough here, if they were intentionally trying to meta game CCP into banning an in-game opponent then they absolutely should be punished. Yes shame on CCP for being stupid and not checking the facts, but that does not change the fact that a CSM member acted in bad faith to get another CSM member banned and paying players banned as well.
---
Sounds like someone hasn’t had their Bud Lite and new round of Molon Labe stickers yet. Poor little fella
---
I'm only a day old in this game and I am really loving the mechanics. I did the plex right away but right now I am still in the starter corp mining ore. Looking to branch out and do some massive courier missions and then who knows?
---
And about when will you be making the delivery? In game name?
---
I think you just wanna show off your watch
---
Not one single idea like mine requiring dscan and being in grid. I'm thinking you're just a prick being a prick for the hell of it. Anyway, we're done here.
---
It was absolutely forbidden
---
[with a rack like this you can hold up to 30.](https://i.imgur.com/ShaZogq.png)
---
Yeah there are a lot of pseudo Bulgarian words in their language. I can help translate more if you link me some text.
---
Why don't you all suggest the one fix which would make it harder to have Intel networks with local rather than trying to nerf local? There is an easy solution which has been around forever which doesnt take much client modification to perform. 
---
Could also encrypt packets from the chat server with a rolling code in order to stop packet sniffing by bots from leading chat packets. 
---
Yall dont have to keep crying about needing local. CCP just needs to want to stop people from using local as an Intel channel. It's not hard unless it would hit your check book. Oh wait.
---
One screenshot and no context at all? Was their evidence of broadcasting? Did you see patterns in behavior? Try poking them or eliciting any interaction? Sure report it to ccp if you seem certain, but IMO the low effort bot accusations arent reddit worthy. A lot if these guys are used to playing with this number of toons and it wont be changing.
---
&gt;fun fact: this subs activity has dropped by 60% in average daily posts in the last 7 month alone
---
another fun fact to add, illustrating general worldwide interest in the game since 2004:

---
Shooting said ammo still requires T2 skills. Besides, alphas can still train for T2 small and medium sized weapons.
---
where's the rest of it?
---
&gt;conflict drivers were removed
---
and / or too many content denial mechanics introduced, especially at high end that could be most noticed on the MERs.
---
&gt; Join EveUni and learn the game
---
This is a good piece of advice. They're good people and have a lot of good resources for new people.
---
&gt; stay away from the null blocks
---
This is not good advice. There's some excellent corps in the null blocks like Brave and PH that offer great experiences and resources for new players.
---
Caracal in triglavian pvp zone. Too fast to catch, pay ransom or lose 3 bill ship 5 bill implants.
---
you can both bot and be in comms. managing 50 procurers is going to be a lot of APM to keep them emptied.
---
&gt;Wh space is it's niche due to a low amount of capitals
---
Give us WH or alike space not bogged down so much by idiotic amounts of scanning necessary to function on decent level and remove rest of caps from it and the floodgates will open. WH / scanning caused carpal syndrome FTL.
---
Assuming you can sell it for the price you bought it for, you’ve broken even before you ever even use it.
---
Hi Naz, men are blond, women are blonde. It's one of the few gendered words in English. Fun fact: brunette is technically gendered as well, it's just extremely unusual for someone to refer to a man as a brunet.
---
No fuck off. Or not and stay. Either way, hello.
---
i do?
---
I literally have a discord devoted to burning fountain and moved a bunch of shit out there and have autistically camped it.
---
But yeah, totes
---
you forgot to mention how the average number of bots has also increased since 2006, 
---
big round of applause to CCPs security team for cracking down on account sharing rather than botting
---
would rather see caldari get thier 2nd ewar ( since the main one has been nerfed to shit ) before we start adding another racial
---
Men who aren't blond are called bronettes. Neat!
---
I don't see any AUDEZELCD-4Z Open-Back Over-ear Headphones.
---
It smells like broke in here
---
Slow clap....
---
...Well done
---
No, intel channels are great, you’re on top of your situational awareness.
---
While I feel the frustration that we shouldn’t HAVE to police botters, CCP SHOULD do that, that’s where we are.
---
There are additional issues with super jump response fleets, I don’t deal with it directly, and haven’t been back to EVE long enough to have a educated opinion, but looks like a change to local would help with people’s complaints.
---
I came back when I learned Eve was f2p, when I scanned down my first WH, I was all like “WTF is THIS”, and subbed right away, decided I had don’t my time running mission, hunting belt rats, and being a CTA f1 drone.
---
ok thanks :)

Wow! thanks for the fit :)

[I'm interested](https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2015/04/Bronn.jpg)

&gt;Delve is the face of most problems with this game. That being said if you think this is all about delve then you are being a sensitive snowflake. If you think you will do fine despite my changes then why be upset about them?
---
It isn't just Delve, though the current status quo and paradigm have been basically pioneered and perfected there. If you remove Delve someone somewhere will just take its place. The blame lies squarely on CCP and their lack of foresight, or their drive to create more "financial whales" for short term profits.
---
Delve would not have happened if CCP reacted when a reaction was needed. Now its too late and the damage has all been done and is in parts irreversable or will take years to reverse. Also now CCP has trapped itself because if they do too much to curb Delve and alike other regions, they will lose their whales as people will get upset and quit, and if they don't then they will continue to bleed players that get sick and tired of the bullshit its causing. So they really fucked themselves with this, dammed if they do and dammed if they don't.
---
Lack of spreadsheets - 10 points
---
Probably an amarr supporter judging from the gold  - 1000 points
---
I used to play and see the big titans and think how cool they were compared to all the other ships. 5 years later now I've got two of them.
---
its not a problem , and don't use a exit hole into null
---
You mean like they did to Brisc?
---
1.01
---
And scame might be related to [scamă](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scam%C4%83)  as it seems to be a plural of that word. But then again I don't speak any of the East European languages, so this is just google and guess work.
---
Damn it.
---
I appreciate that. As for my profession, I’m a lawyer first and the lobbying is what pays the bills. It’s also a protected first amendment right and largely misunderstood. But hey, I get it. There are some folks I work with I don’t care for either.
---
Sorry bro, the ISK must flow
---
We have suggested that to CCP previously (during the pre-PANIC nerf days, even). As that has not happened, we feel it is best that we suggest alternate solutions to the problems.
---
&gt; It isn't just Delve, though the current status quo and paradigm have been basically pioneered and perfected there. If you remove Delve someone somewhere will just take its place. 
---
My proposal wasn't "remove Delve". They were about balancing the mechanics that enabled it to break the game so much.
---
&gt; they will lose their whales as people will get upset and quit
---
Yes. This is why I said if actual fixes were applied, things will have to go worse for a little while more, before getting better.
---
OMG! You used CSM &amp; conscience in the same sentence !
---
My sides hurt! Take your upvote you magnificent b@stard.
---
&gt;Well, I contributed to that, by going from 5-6 active accounts down to two. Finances plus some burnout. I got out of mining too, which negated the need for so many accounts. I even sold one character. Working again now, and expect to activate at least one more account, to satisfy my own need for skill injectors.
---
And you are not the only one, many people have put their alts on hold, some have stopped loging in due to the steam regional price changes, some because of plex prices etc.
---
And yet with that, we have 1.6 accounts per person and rising. What does that tell you ?
---
they only changed the drone bay size from 5m3 per AF lvl, to 25m3 role bonus. Or they just added that 25m3 and no more mentions it's a bonus.
---
Dammit, where's the rest ?
---
&gt;Currently we have 23,000 pilots online. Thank you for the graph.
---
Dont forget 1.6 accounts per person, so actually around 17k players, and that is being really generous and rounding.
---
No, they DID state that it was brought up by members of the CSM, they never once implied it was the entirety.
---
Jynn Minomo is also an actual pilot. [https://zkillboard.com/character/92369505/](https://zkillboard.com/character/92369505/)
---
I've seen strat pings with awesome fc's require follow-up pings for useless spodbrains to get into fleet. It used to be that fleet would fill instantly, then you'd need 1 or 2 overflow fleets. we need war.
---
Is this Dack? 1v1 me at the sun bro.
---
ok - lets be clear - the tournament has needed to make some changes due to the restrictions in the tool - so we are not running exactly as was originally planned. Such a simple thing as only have 1 arena vs 2 makes a massive difference to how a show like this is produced and the downtime between matches.
---
I can assure you - there are not hundreds of people waiting to take our place - not to the quality needed - do you see any other tournaments taking place right now?
---
the thing is, any change to local is just going to make the whole cap umbrella thing worse.
---
if you can't see an enemy coming you have 1 choice to defend yourself - be able to summon an overwhelming and disproportionate response fleet at will.
---
if i can't do anything about you until you're on top of me, then you're not going to be on top of me in something that can't kill me - therefore my only counter is to just drop an entire super fleet on you the moment you enter grid.
---
enjoy that.
---
1. if you want to. fatigue is max 30 minutes.
---
2. code sucks. Miniluv are kings of hisec.
---
3. plex are expensive.
---
4. yes
---
&gt; We did use them as entosis ships for a few months during the invasion of ESO and "defense" of the DRF.
---
Brave still uses them because they're a good low-sp replacement to clownnose as they can fit a cyno and jump drive.
---
absolutely - it was not an easy decision for us to not stream the tournament - we have all put so much work into this and we wanted to complete it - but its about the players and we are not sacrificing that.
---
Maybe something to do with the pilot? [https://zkillboard.com/character/92369505/](https://zkillboard.com/character/92369505/)  
---
Its an old toon but could be useful to locate where its at.
---
Honestly, the 5 mil SP soft cap for alphas doesn't make any sense, just have them stick to the 20 mil SP hard cap.
---
This whole idea of alphas buying skill injectors to go from 5mil to 20 mil is not logical, as that same ISK is way better spend for alphas to just PLEX their account to omega.
---
Fair.
---

---
You're right in front of your computer. You don't need that watch.

Fuck, you won this time.

It was simply a matter of outsmarting the bots.

Putting large faction gun on alpha clone is crazy. Yes you can but should yoy? No.

Congrats. Enjoy the taste of their blood 07
---
We live in a world where people have been given the options of 'Yes' and it have been called democracy. I am pretty sure there are those that are going to say 10% turnout is democracy.
---
That said, I rather like the fact that we have the CSM, even if I agree with you that the process might not produce the spectrum of player-insight that the game might need.
---
u/jibrish please help this poor soul
---
Yeah they will but they have a volume cap
---
They're really too fast to catch ? And even if you pay the ransom, can't they just keep kiting you until the timer runs out ?
---
hero... Those guys are called capsuleers mate. This is not lol
---
The flair fits (GSF).
---
We are all oppressed on this blessed day (:
---
If that's their plan, it's a good one, but they gotta keep it up.
---
Drama every day!
---
I still remember my first days.
---
Just trying the trial to see what this game was all about. My mind exploded when i was sitting there in my pod and Aura said i had to fly to something. I logged off because i didn't understand one bit what was going on.  
---
Didn't do nothing except reading the EVE Uni webpages and the EVE Wiki's the first days.
---
Then i logged back in and was settled to go. 
---
After 2 days i looked with full proud at my fully fitted T1 Trasher and thinking i was the King of EVE. Even mining in my Venture was top notch. Just looking around in space and zooming in on the planets while listening to the music. Earning like 100k isk a mission and thinking i was fucking rich with 10m isk in the bank. Scrolling on the market and gazing at those multi-million ships that i thought i could never buy. 
---
Man...i miss those feels. I never got it in any other game than in EVE. 
---
Embrace those feels, man. They will be gone after a while lol
---
[https://youtu.be/p2d45H0BSXY?t=381](https://youtu.be/p2d45H0BSXY?t=381) check it
---
Structures have made things a bit different, but the content is still mostly the same (what you make it). 15 year capsuleer here, the water's fine.
---
The problem is proving ill intent by the reporter. They will always claim they were just passing on relevant (in their mind) information. As you said, the issue is with CCP not fact checking like they should have before acting. 
---
When you punish the reporter it has a chilling effect on future reports. 
---
TLDR; ccp
---
Tik tok is only 15 seconds guys, sorry LOL.
---
I understand all that. Almost every change like this will have a period of decline before it levels itself off and things start rising again.
---
The thing I would like to point out though is that the 130m/hr for a 5b ship is a result of oversaturation and the fault of the players engaging in it on large scale and was multitudes higher in not too distant past. So I would not care if it were actually temporarily removed altogether until something comes into place, or just let it decline until the 5b ships become completely not worth it.
---
One of the major issues for me are content denial mechanics and lack of accessability. Things such as intel bots, multi bubble gate camps, lack of nullified ships, etc. etc. Let the floodgates open and watch what happens.
---
Sure, small stuff such as cyno inhib buffs, the balance patch we got and all that will help a little, but not by much in the grand scheme of things. These are steps in the right direction, but are just far too small.
---
Seriously I would like to see a temporary nerf to all cap, super and titan EHP, large nerf, let the stockpiles go down to whatever X target, then bring it back up. This in addition to dealing with the content denial mechanics.
---
cool!

Gold magnate with oversized, overheated MWD, max links, black hole C6, snakes and Zor, quafe and Agency 'Overclocker' SB7 Dose III
---
So...it works like it's intended to work?
---
Incentivizing them to plex their account to omega is the whole point tho
---
&gt; If you trade any of the Triglavian niches for an Ewar bonus then why don't just design another brand-new shipline
---
I like their theme and how Trig ships in general operate. Love flying them. They are simply the most fun ships Eve has to offer at the moment, so I would like to keep that at least partially.
---
You can copy exactly as fast as you could build off it
---
That's pretty much how all ransoms work in EVE though
---
Brave uses them for salvagers don’t lie.
---
How about they first fix ECM after they fucked it up so badly that multiple Caldari ships are plain worthless. That or remove ECM and make new ewar for Caldari.
---
Honestly I feel like in a New Eden where the Ishtar can field 5 sentries or heavies the ishkur fielding 5 mediums would be ok.
---
Modifying resists?  
---
Sounds like the Phenomena Generators on the titans

---
I usually just swap the cloak out for them on when I run toast. Sometimes I forget the entosis link, but at least with the salvagers I'm still useful to the fleet.
---
tell me an investment which CCP cannot nuke anytime they want. Don't forget, its all theirs.
---
Probably a corp mining op.

Can somebody show me how I can join an alliance with these aspects please

why so expensive, is this an exceptionally rare one?

&gt; the ol buyback scam
---
I'm not spending the time getting my shit shipped to high-sec. I pay for the convenience, I think for Brave it's generally ~0-10% of jita buy depending, and I'm certainly not going to spend the effort station trading. vOv
---
Time per run for building on a blank bpo is 3:15:00, time for copying is 2:36:00.
---
YEah
---
I can confirm (I "farmed" AFK markee gold at one point)... the leaderboard is very competitive.
---
It's actually pretty damn generous for free.  The original alphas were way too limited, but the current ones are damn strong.  You can fly T1 sub-BS ships very nearly as well as a paid account.
---
Ive got haptic feedback on my phone off, so I didnt expect much sound as I typed. Beyond that, I'd say expectations were met.
---
Tbf, if CCP was smart, they would’ve had the evidence needed before they banned Brisc. It’s kinda like being jailed for doing illegal shit, but being exonerated later on in someway. At that point(but before being exonerated) have fun proving you were innocent.
---
Welcome to the best part of this game! I'm assuming you're Russian because of "on this barn...)." Just thinking back to that recent post I saw with a guy explaining all the terms you guys use. Anyways, awesome story, and here's to many more \*pours glass of vodka
---
It's another failure of CCP's "soon".  It was supposed to return as a normal option shortly after the PLEX changeover; here we are, years later, and you still have to petition.
---
To be fair, the GMs seem pretty good at getting them done pretty fast usually.  When they don't though (had one take 2 days) the buyer can get pretty upset.
---
I’m afraid you’re dead wrong friend, I’m a frenchy XD

But cheers mate, and thanks for your comment !

Damn it TEST pawn, leave the poor noob alone! This is why they leave! \*pssst, just kidding, push em in the dirt, it's the ones that get back up that make the game better!

Yep, probably can forgoe the SPRs in C1, BCUs like the other reply said would be great.
---
SOB! I knew it lol still, Vodka is awesome and everything still applies as far as what I said.

CCP Buffed capital jump ranges. So compared to back then you have less jumps to make on long distance routes. So in, short.

I'd say try out some abyssal PVP. Its high risk - high reward kinda thing. Guaranteed 1v1 so no more being 95% surely baited in low/nullsec.

It sounds like you're suggesting nuking the log chat to file functionality along with chat server  traffic encryption, is that correct?

CCP stated, on record, that he did not break the NDA. Are you stuck in a hole or something?

Fair enough.

A buddy asked me about this exact thing the other week. After a bunch of shitty ideas i had one that could be viable. Allow a single new, ramp up, ewar module that requires scripts. You can script it to any ewar, and as usual starts off decently less efficient than a single bonused/scripted ewar mod and ramps us to double-triple stacked mod levels. Not a great idea as is me thinks but was the best i came up with at the time.
---
Ahh, that explains the "K162 exists but is invisible/not a sig" state, thanks!

---
Save yourself at somepoint and get into lowsec warfare madness, nullsec might, or wormhole insanity.  Those three are where the game is truly at.  Get into a community that you vibe with and quick.  If they're good folk they will show you the way.
---
&gt; We demand the head of the GM
---
I think you are getting confused with the words 'I' and 'We'.
---
You'd have to be on the ball with putting new orders in after the very limited run was finished. So every few hours for a month if you compare them two.
---
If I recall larger orders are get a better ISK/Unit cost ratio when compared to smaller build orders.
---
++++
---
*Clearly you're uhhh... An uncloaked covops cyno! Yeah, sure, that must be it. Kill him!* :P

But yeah, in seriousness I'd probably agree, unless they're serving as a tac in a fight, a random ongrid frigate isn't likely worth the effort catching.

If you're out 8 bill already, is another 300 mil inportant? This is the decision every ransomed needs to make. And to your second question, that's how all ransoms work in Eve. Certain people are known for doing it though
---
Yep. When you start fighting professionals only 1 or 2 pilots is all it takes to have a bad day. Whether that's a gatecamping t3, or a bubbleceptor, or a cloaky recon/stratios... You gotta take care in low/null because those fights are 9000% unfair. :)

Look at the graph at when the fall starts for summer. If you look at the graph you will see that the fall is starting from the start of the year in 2019 when it only normally starts historically in May to late June. 
---
This is not the start of summer yet.. The issue is when summer sets in, how bad is the player count going to get, considering we expect lower returning players after the summer period than pre summer...
---
Hum, good question. The radius of a bubble is quite large when you land on them, but the actual answer probably has to do with how warp ticks are handled. Probably a question left to Seamus Donohue of eve uni q&amp;a: http://calendar.eveuniversity.org

Duuuude, Venture mining was beastmode.
---
Now, with 7 Hulks, one Orca and a Rorq underway, I feel somewhat engorged.
---
I think he's suggesting a 4x difference? But yeah, good catch, alphas are already slower.
---
Since these groups are smaller than null "empires" hard to say. Try just flinging through r/evejobs and joining discords and talking to people. get a feel for places and the people to see who you mesh well with
---
Mmm lunch.
---
I'm not 100% happy with the launcher because those ads take up RAM and I feel like ir lags more, but it seems to work well enough. Definitely not unplayable x)
---
Glad your streaming now and trying to be part of the eve community, trashing another streamer or worrying about what goes on in his stream is kinda sad IMO. Build your stream and community and worry about your own shit.
---
The only way you're gonna catch them is by having 23/7 cloaky campers in every single system they are operating in. In response they will either not undock at all, ever (which is technically a win but boring af) or eventually the guy running the accounts might decide to risk undocking after getting fed up with waiting you out.
---
Theran was fine for him. we went to brave briefly and now is in a 1 man unaffiliated corp.

---
Far as i know an agent will never send you through a constellation or regional gate.  Meaning that they can only pick systems in that hub systems specific constellation.
---
If your hub is right in the middle of the constellation, you should never have to go more than a couple jumps in any one direction.  If youre at the end of a string of systems in one constellation, you could get sent from one end to the other.
---
I do not know if special missions like Epic Arcs obey these same rules as ive never done one.
---
You mean like take all of the syndicate moons away from NC. single-handedly?
---
&gt;Earning like 100k isk a mission and thinking i was fucking rich with 10m isk in the bank.
---
Lol, I remember those days. After I had a couple billion in the bank I thought I was super space rich. Granted, I was a Hordeling (in its infancy) at the time, so comparatively I kinda was, but now I need to add several more zeros before I feel even slightly financially secure.
---
So in 2019 guy can’t figure out how to right click uninstall a program... not surprising he’s not into eve
---
If you are an English speaker you have a few options if not native English you have different options. There are five big newBro alliances, Test, Goons, Brave, Pandemic Horde and Eve Uni.
---
As others have said Eve Uni is an amazing place to start, it focuses on lessening that learning curve. If you want PvE this is one of your best starting points.
---
If on the other hand, you want the big arse fight you read about in PC Gamer the Null Sec alliances are where you want to go. 
---
If you choose PH as your alliance you will be given your starting ships for free and most of the skill books you need for your first 90 days. You will be encouraged to join a caretaker fleet where your FC will answer every question you can throw at him, whilst earning the isk for a big shiny ship.
---
Again being in a corp is super important to you not hitting a brick wall, choose one that sounds fun and gives you benefits.  I will leave this here for you [https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jj16ThL.jpg)
---
Why would you want to stop winning?
---
I think there's a slight markup on daily ASIs, actually: they're 20 PLEX or 80m, but you need 30 of them per month. With a plex sub that's 500 PLEX (25x the cost of ASI). So you effectively pay up to 25% more just on fees, and then like 35+% over a direct sub. I'm not sure how MCT affects that, but if it's worse than a plex sub it's probably even worse than a 485 plex MCT.
---
I personally like the flexibility of daily ASIs if I still need random skills on different chars, but also don't need to be omega (although I've been multiboxing and playing a lot this month so it has been worth it), but now that I've actually had a thought about how high the markup can be, I might have to have a think and stick to month long investments in training :)

Week after buying it CCP release faction cov ops cloak that drop like rain and are better.

In league they are called champions, m8

I still do not give a shit and call everything heros. Aside from DOTA ofc, that game has champions for sure.

---
I cannot claim nor deny being Dack due to EULA and TOS for Eve.
---
Yes because brute force uninstalling is always the best method.
---
If you are in Qindows go to Add or Remove Programs. Uninstall the game from there. Then go to MY Documents and delete the EVE folder. Next you have to hunt down the data in APP DATA by opening My Computer and in the command bar type %APPDATA% and search for any remaining Eve folders and delete those as well.
---
Suitonia has some videos of it I think
---
Given that you're not on the CSM that's interesting in itself, and lends a different angle to the line you were taking in the first thread.
---
Originally, T2 BPOs were handed out in a lottery-like system to try and keep T2 stuff rare.  CCP figured out this was a terrible system, and now most people use Invention to make T2 BPCs.  But the BPCs you can invent are never as good as this 10/20 BPO.
---
Who is interviewing who?
---
Feeling kinda cute, might play later idk
---
One of Us
---
5 years, chief. ends in a few weeks.
---
Make jumping cost more?
---
First, this BPO isn't leaving the inside of a copy machine any time soon.
---
Second, the BPO still has value and can be sold again when you get tired of running the copy machine.
---
NO COLLUSION. NO OBSTRUCTION.
---
when you're looking at a ship worth 1bn+, how expensive do you think you're going to have to make jumping before cost becomes a factor?
---
It's almost like alphas aren't designed for people to use them as main accounts because CCP still want some subscription money.
---
For me, alphas are already too good. You can train up an effective Gila or Rattlesnake (or VNI) ratter for free, for example. You can station trade as an alpha, at least for less high intensity hubs. You can use an alpha to move goods around in HS, to explore with relatively low risk, to do incursions, to play FW. There's already too much you can do without paying CCP.
---
1.) if you are scrammed you wont be Booshed
---
2.) you dont need to lock a target to boosh it so sensor recalibration is unimportant, you just need to be 6km or under.
---
Gender is subjugated rather intentionally in this work.
---
5 second spool up. Hmm. I'd have to be dam quick. Also learning about this thing has given me a great idea for ganking T3C's that hop into my WH 😊 previously I struggled to figure out a way to get them away from the hole but this might work.
---
Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.

How about you just put mjds on your rattles?

With that said, not enough rust.

---
Isn't that a storyline cap booster or sth?
---
For trig recon I would like short-range ewar module which decreases amount of RR ship can receive (with spoolup, from say 1% to 80% reduction). I dislike resists idea because effect has to be weak to not make it OP, while with RR only it can be made stronger.
---
Secondary ewar doesn't matter, but to make ship more useful would be nice to have some anti-drone anti-fighter weapon (like deviant automata suppressor).
---
Lol a new player in fw will only lose money unless they run from everything
---
While you won't be booshed, whoever is scramming you will be!
---
It can't boosh capital ships or Orcas, I think I recall that it's forbidden in hisec too.
---
Good work from the fourth estate.
---
&gt;Theran was fine for him.
---
That's for him to answer not you. 
---
&gt;Karl didn't tell people what to do. I did.
---
OK boss.
---
&gt;Further, you are also a liar and always claimed to just be there to kill botters. Yet the vast majority of your kills were newbros in ventures. 
---
This can be very easily proven as the blatant lie that it is with a quick look at my killboard. You are the liar and you are also an unstable douchebag and an asshole. Now get back to extracting ISK from taxes and super expensive JF services from your poor newbie alliance mates and shut your dirty lying mouth when adults are talking. Nobody respects you.

Umm, ratting battleships are 1B+, carriers are dozens of B, supers up over a 100 I think.
---
I don’t know the logistics behind umbrella fleets, but moving a load of giant ships should be a strategic decision with strategic costs.
---
I don't know the exact numbers but I wouldn't be surprised if there was more than one of these for the most common T2 mods/ammo only.
---
Oh, you're talking about your own CSM NDA? That wouldn't apply to things that happened with Brisc though.
---
&gt; Umm, ratting battleships are 1B+, carriers are dozens of B, supers up over a 100 I think.

you've clearly been away for a long time, friend. you're overestimating by a factor of at least 4.

This is how it starts. Two years from now this guys is going to be terrorizing his enemies with his pvp skills and be a good pvper.  Keep it up duder.
---
That is exactly because I care about "worthy" streamers that I care about that. Think it through for a minute : when he is viewboting and therefore is stealing the top spot of the eve streams ranking, most of the lurking viewers will see his stream before the other ones. Do you find it fair ? It should be merit based and instead the whole embedded/viewboting thing is basicaly killing the low but worthy streamers. I personaly dont give a single fuck since I am streaming for the French community so he is not stealing my "potential viewerbase" but I think about the other EN streamers and the merit they should earn to be on the top spots and yet they dont get it.
---
Thanks but I already have one. The profit is roughly 1-2m per unit and you can build like 25 per day. It's a component that there's always a need for but you still don't do more than 25m a day.
---
I also had a 650mm arty II BPO that is like -1m profit per unit.
---
Gtfo
---
You can boosh off the tackle with a mjfd.
---
Here's the issue with that -- everyone will just switch the intel tools to read from something CCP can't kill.  Jabber, discord, whatever.  It makes it the tiniest bit less convenient, but not really in a useful way.
---
Is that true, really?
---
Who are those “we” you’re talking about? It’s certainly not me.

I think you’re just talking about yourself.

&gt; the 5 mil SP soft cap for alphas doesn't make any sense, just have them stick to the 20 mil SP hard cap

Jesus. CCP gives an inch (free racial alpha) and another (no racial restrictions, T2) and freeloaders just want more.
---
Did you have to do anything special to get those notifications? If I could get that to work on my galaxy watch I would finally have purpose in life

you can jump out before you even get tackled with a mjd...

It's definitely broken on the old map. Very annoying. I don't know why you are getting downvoted.
---
Not really...I downloaded the eve app and whenever someone emails me ingame or I finished a skill I get a notification.

Well, that’s something on the long long term, but maybe one day... That’s a goal to be set, friend :)
---
For now I need to train up that goddamn Weapon Upgrades V, because every time I try to make a fit I either have to run to the market and buy a fitting implant or completely redo it &gt;.&lt;
---
 I lurk in his stream all the time because i want to, so does everyone else, they enjoy what he does for his community as well as others, he has spent years building up his community. There is no viewboting.

 What have you done to deserve people lurking in your stream? Stop crying about numbers others have earned and earn your own. Maybe one day you will become a success too...

this ios why i voted for you and always believed in ur innocence. u so nice

They're all 1x skills, not really worth worrying about being offmap on a 1x skill

That's a work computer
---
These things are so idiotic, and CCP should have just put a bullet in them years ago.
---
They been marginalized so much that any producer who knows anything about producing wouldn't touch one, ever. And the idiots that did buy them at prices like this are having a negative impact on the natural invention economy. 
---
They really hurt the extremely niche markets where demand can be largely met by the blueprints, making invention perpetually unprofitable. Offhand example: nighthawk.
---
It's easy to sweep industry stuff under the rug because it's not very glamorous, so they've sat there being annoying and stupid for years.
---
Just get rid of them already CCP.
---
Ladies first.
---
Damage caps are the only way to prevent larger groups from just cynoing in a hundread titans and erasing things from existance in a single volley.
---
What is it exactly what you don't like about it? If it is the limit I think we could debate where to draw the line for ages, but the concept itself is kind of needed to things to actually not be shittier than they already are imo.
---
If only I had the isk to drop on it. That would he one juicy piece for my collection. lol!
---
He does have some informative content so who cares.
---
You should finish this.
---
I have ransomed several people in a caracal in the proving conduit. The ones that pay I either let them kill me or flew out. Whatever is agreed upon. I honor the ransom every time. People are not willing to pay much, btw.
---
Check the systems the character died in. No  podkills, but it's the only thing that makes sense.
---
Ransom caracal is not that much faster than this. He would be able to catch it and neut it out.
---
So the thing is he actually talks about the game while streaming he is the only one that is actually trying to have a good stream everyone else is just playing while annoying music is playing in the background.

First big loot run from exploration, terrified something is going to catch you. See a blip right when your warping out. Good times.

Skip training beams. I love lasers but they just don’t hold up later in the game
---
Procs aren't a terrible ore capacity / throughput combination though I'll admit I've never tried 50. Now if it was covetors that'd be madness.
---
They did give free skill points over the holiday. granted you got more with omega but still.. free skill points as alpha that's good stuff
---
Just out of curiosity, if it needed to go further, would some variation on defamation have been your main claim?
---
Oh back when skill queues finishing actually happened regularly... 😥
---
Unless they use a scram bomber to get 1st tackle.

Then plex came out and you could just buy isk?

Did you lose most of your armour elsewhere or did that gaggle of procs almost pop you with drones?

And the horse he rode in on, too.
---
In your perception this may seem generous but the way this game is advertised, which is a F2P game, alpha status still is way too limited for the average F2P player.
---
Eve Online is simply not a proper F2P game. Yet CCP is adverising it as such and they're shooting themselves in the foot with being so misleading.

I've run three and there's really not a lot of APM to it. Procurer's mining rate is low enough and their cargo hold is big enough that I could see a human handling 50. If you get a cycle going I think it could be workable.

But super unlikely.

Things used to be so expensive. I remember grinding high sec missions to get my standings high enough for a jump come (ya, newbros jump clones used to be a pita). Anyhow my first bs was a typhoon and cost an absolute fortune at the time (42 mil). Took me ages to earn that much isk it seemed.

---
&gt; As a man of science and industry, I know that you always need a reference to do a proper delta comparison.
---
Ugh! Such cringe.
---
All that you have is that the ratio of viewers between on/off stream periods is lower for MD than other streamers. That is all!
---
* You have in no way demonstrated that such a ratio corresponds to viewer bots.
---
* If off-stream idle viewers means bots, then you very conveniently decide to miss that—from your own writing—it goes from ~60 to ~200 when the stream is on. So... even though the majority of viewers *do* in fact exhibit what follows to be legitimate behaviour according to your own writing, MD must be illegitimate because a slightly larger minority if his viewers—than the corresponding minority for another streamer—behave in a particular way that you have arbitrarily decided corresponds to bots. I said a lot there so let me repeat that. *You are saying he must use bots despite that you said that the **majority** of his viewers behave like legitimate viewers.*
---
* Your only other argument is that you don't like MD's stream and there must therefore be something amiss.
---
&gt; They all have very respectful viewer base and provide content that matches the viewer base.
---
Let me break down what OP is saying in the above, "MD is boring and therefore it doesn't make sense that he has so many viewers: must be cheating."
---
What a great man of, "science and industry," that can't understand the completely subjective notion of taste and that others may not like precisely like what you like! Not everyone is a prepubescent teenager that likes presenters that act like loud, aloof, fratboys [1].
---
Forget all of the other points that people have made that it's common for IRC chatrooms to be mostly filled with AFK users, or that his channel rewards time spent AFK in the room with stupid points that mostly mean nothing. (I believe he changed the way you get prizes that no longer requires the in-channel gold) You have presented a long thesis about MD which at its foundation has a pair of ideas that are completely feeble and break down at the first touch of scrutiny. It says much more about your ineptitude at reasoning than MD's stream.
---
[1] Not necessarily trying to say this of any of the other streamers OP listed, just making a point.
---
P.S. Worst streamer ever: you didn't even plug your stream.
---

Then why is there a 20 mil cap in the first place? Also this whole force-to-Plex thingie doesn't work. Plexing your account is just too grindy of an affair that simply sucks the fun out of your game. Forcing your players into having a bad time is an incredibly ineffecient way to make them pay. CCP clearly doesn't understand how proper F2P works.
---
Im not gonna read that sorry not enough time.
---
coming from an asshole not in TEST, you're comment is predictable.
---
They are really super awesome licenses to print ISK for people that just up and won one on the lottery and sat there making them till now.

More NPC sotiyos. They actually clean citadel spam until run.

Intentionally frustrating alphas is just horrible game design that does nothing to make them happy omega campers.

So, first off the race you choose doesn't matter much aside from determining what system you start in. If you have access to your old account I'd highly recommend just using that instead of creating a new one. As far as exciting things to do as a new player, the first choice is frigates in FW. You can get good fights at a low cost where you don't need 50mil SP to be competitive. Exploring is also a good option. I don't know what's fun about mining, but if that is your thing join a newbrow null corp, they can get you setup with good corp mining fleets, as well as actual PvP fleets. Though rather controversial, you can also suicide gank an a new player, though to do so you should probably join an established ganking corp as you need friends to be effective when ganking.

True, and yeah it would be nice to have some sort of anti-fighter EWAR since the jammer nerf (story: the first really good fight I was in, I flew a BB and neutered a combat carrier someone dropped on us, I think that's how things were supposed to be).
---
I just threw in the tackle idea because it was interesting, and because most empires have tackle as T2 EWAR.
---
I like both of these ideas, they have solid lore backing and encourage anti-blob warfare.
---
I felt the same way for years. Ended up going with a Fitbit Charge. Awesome battery life, shows notifications, is a cool smart  watch at a decent price. I also have tiny wrist and most smart watches looked ridiculous so I was really happy with the size. Bought it from a TEST bro actually. Friendship best ship.

---
The first 2 sentences were enough. With 25% more ghost viewers there is no debate. Especialy if you look at the numbers of the competition
---
I won’t spam.
---
Interesting...
---
Ohhh, my bad.  Now it all makes sense.
---
Epic arcs require significant amounts of travel, but can only be run once every 3 months, so it doesn't piratically apply here. Courier missions will send you to different constellations if I'm not mistakes, but they should be the only normal mission to do so.
---
That would be a great change.
---
Man you should upload it to Wikileaks
---
Congrats! Once you get the finger shakes, there is no going back.

Amarr watch
---
Just play a fun pve game on the side lol.
---
yeah this one is the regular eve app
---
will do!

“Having a second job you have to pay for”
---
Right in the feels..

Had a few strat fits planned for the abyss, never took them out because lazy to go buy filaments or to do actual abyss pve :( all 3 fits were just 10b so would have been a good fights.

You don't fix lynching with more lynching. The dudes are letting bygones be bygones and are already back to rustling rorq jimmies all over the cluster, so let's just let it go.
---
Thanks doom.
---
Bardzo ladnie sobie rozmawiacie wszyscy w tym temacie. Piszcie wiecej o Triglavianach, nie krepujcie sie serio... 
---
plus sandtrack (nie mylic z sandboxem) do tematu: Hus - Eleven, prawdziwie tubylczy kawalek, na pewno znajdzie sie na mikstejpie. Co tam piloci u Was, dalej pierdolicie o jakiejs konkretnej osobie uzywajac zamiast jego imienia np. nazwy czolgu? Invincible... untouchable... cnn... yeeeeh. A niech strace, pozdrawiam rowniez cale CCP, bo tak jeszcze poczuliby sie odrzuceni, a to chujowe uczucie przeciez... zamieszanie z Brubalem sie juz skonczylo? Alez Wy CCP to macie pomysly, bez kitu. Eve Russia sie zbliza, dacie rade tak jak zapowiadaliscie w mailach dotrzec do kazdego pilota w okolicy, czy tak jak wAmsterdamie bedzie powalajaca liczba az 350 osob?. Wiecie co CCP? Na meczach Muszelki Ogardy za moichczasow bylo wiecej ludzi, a tutaj mamy do czynienia ze znanym na calym swiecie mmorpg, najtrudniejszym, najbardziej niszowym, z najwieksza baza graczy, jednym z pierwszych oraz jednym z niewielu ktory ciagle znajduje sie na szczycie...I tylko 350 osob na EVE IT? A nie popierdolilo sie Wam cos i ten caly Event toczasem nie byl przystanek Rudego z cala swoja swita, zastepami sluzacych, pokojowek, bawidamkow i klaunow? Z Wami to nigdy nie wiadomo, wiec i tak moglo byc. Mam nadzieje ze Petersburg rozjebie system i bedzie dla wszystkich calkowitym zaskoczeniem, takze z wywiadow po, najczesciej spotykana odpowiedz na pytanie jak tam bylo to... ja nawet nie wiedzialem ze tak mozna...No i wiadomo ze czekam na ta triglavianska inwazje..na nowy obiekt badantez czekam.. to chyba wszystko na co czekam... w planach dalsze pisanie a co do pisania zwiazanego z Wami?... nie wiem, moze pociagne dalej ten watek z ostatniego mojego wiekszego posta i zaczne pokazywac to wszystko co dzialo sie od 15.05.17 po 16.11.18. Jezeli tak bedzie to bedzie to w formie, socjologiczny hip hop, zaangazowany spolecznie, czyli ten najbardziej niewygodny dla Was.. kurde do roboty musze sie zbierac a tak mi sie fajnie z Wami pisze...nic trza zakasac rekawy i stanac do tej nierownej walki z drifterami i sanczami tak jak tookrutny los dal..

Latajcie odpowiedzialnie

How would a new player know about market manipulation? Someone’s need doing some homework or isn’t a ‘new’ player.
---
&gt;one guy
---
Either you are optimistic or go on small fleets
---
 the_judge ... It’s not like the guy hadn’t betrayed his own before either.
---
Ask him.. see if he denies it. It was something to do with discord.
---
Why did they reject your application?
---
Ayyyee you’re in God Less Horizon! Make sure you yell “CAPTIAN ASHEN LIED RONA DIED” in coms and see what he does.
---
DaOpa? DaOpa anyone?
---
Without boosts it fills up in 11 minutes, with boosts its can get down to 5. It is doable and was seen before the rorqual changes.
---
You new guys have it easy. I had to mine in a bantam!
---
I was in their Discord checking once a day if their website was up (it was down at the time) and I think the HR director thought I was annoying and rejected my application personally.
---
Programs...? Get a good computer, get multiple monitors (or one BIG ass one) and you can easily control / run plenty of clients. Not hard at all, not challenging at all, just more involved.

20 mil sp is for people who were veterans who had 100 mil sp chars, quit the game and now CCP wants to encourage them to come back. They get an advantage for years of paying for subs (This game is 15 years old after all). The 20 mil limit has nothing to do with people joining the game now for the first time. Although it is very surprising that you can skill inject to 20mil or even use skill injectors as an alpha...
---
I haven't played in a long time, is the break even point on t2 bpos 4-8 years?
---
Hey, I think I helped save the pos this blueprint was in!
---
Oh hello Mr Pot. How is Mr Kettle?
---
https://youtu.be/B203twyaMfM
---
How does a T2 bpo end up with negative profits?
---
*Just wait till only one skill takes 30+ days
---
Ftfy
---
And if you decide in a year you don't want to wait that long, you just sell it again for the same price you bought it for, meanwhile you've made 18billion for 2 hours of work.
---
You’re gonna need to provide some evidence for that statement if you’re just gonna state that
---
delete injectors
---
Genuinely wondering what the safest way to transport something like this would be, cov ops?
---
I wouldn't say there are hiccups per say. Just some apps do more cool things like skill planning. Simulating things, and ship builders and stuff.
---
&gt;TEST pawn, leave the poor noob alone! This is why they leave! \*pssst, just kidding, push em in the dirt, it's the ones that get back up that make the game better!
---
Amen, brother. Ain't that the truth.
---
What do Sound and HK do differently?
---
This is an interesting topic, but not one that I'm willing to have publicly. :)
---
which means you fucked up in the first place by not closing connections, not watching dscan or not watching new anoms pop up.
---
if you follow these three things and have mjd's fittet you should never ever get caught.
---
Haters will say it's fake
---
This is some really cliff hanger shit right here
---
&gt; because almost all of the meaningful decisions are moved from members to the FC
---
Lol what meaningful decisions do you usually make in an F1 fleet
---
You are right. I joined a smaller start up alliance that has just gained 3 sov systems and i had more Fun there Then anywhere Else in Eve im feeling like i belong somewhere. That i make a difference we conquer build up etc not waiting arround and doing static null Warfare for the huge alliances  i think the Big empires should fall that it Will all turn into small alliances and coalitions to make nullsec cool again with battles going on and actual changing of systems instead of the static 1916 Frontline it is today.
---
God I love his videos. Probably one of the few YouTubers that I have watched religiously for years.
---
I totally agree.  You should post this message as a seperate post on Reddit. You have a good Point though  null is to static these days no big changed no Massive north VS South or big coalitions vs big coalitions Warfare with fleets and battles every few hours . Eve needs a huge war again that Will attract people again   Bring the excitement back
---
&gt;Imagine being stupid enough to fail to comprehend what you read yet spewing hate lol.
---
You're too stupid to see the irony in this comment...
---
Literally who
---
How very surprising.
---
&gt; I will be coming out publicly live on The Meta Show tomorrow at 4pm EST
---
That's very courageous of you! Have you told your parents? Hope they're supportive.
---
oh very nice!
---
Not everyone buys isk. And plex has been out for well over 10 years
---
Large populations of people who do nothing but suck up resources without producing anything are never good for any society over the long term.
---
it was me
---
sorry to ruin your surprise
---
Sometimes its not about the additional loss, but rather denying the other person financial gain.
---
So, dirty admission: this was later corrected as 'scale,' though we didn't catch it during the initial spread. :x
---
Part of what alphas are for is to provide an active user base, and therefore *content* for the regular subscribers. CCP knows that it relies on the continued subscription of it's dedicated core following. It's less about significantly expanding the base of subscribers (CCP knows that EVE will never blow up much more in popularity by the very nature of the game and how long it's been running)--although luring in potential new subscribers is part of it--as it is ensuring that EVE has enough activity and content to keep it's core group of dedicated subscribers playing. 
---
Content is other players, and like any food chain the weaker and newer players further down provide fresh content for those further up the chain. Alphas ensure that there is a steady stream of newer players coming in, and also has the other benefit of serving as a great avenue for former players to jump back into the game and potentially resubscribe. If CCP hadn't implemented Alphas then chances are the population would have steadily begun to shrink, to the extent that long term players would have certainly felt the game was dying and begin abandoning it in droves. 
---
Omegas may be what's bringing in money to CCP, but Alphas are keeping EVE alive and healthy as an MMO, and without that there wouldn't be any subscription money at all. Alphas aren't intended to be just another "trial" account like in other MMOs (where you can get to level 20 or whatever before having to subscribe to see the rest of the game), they were clearly designed to be able to engage and experience enough content that they are actually regularly playing alongside and with Omegas.
---
Could have fooled me.
---
Also, the spam wasn't what kept you out, just giving others fair warning that they must promise 100% uptime on all of their services.
---
Not a new player.
---
Fakers will say it's hate
---
Was not reason. I personally shat all over your application (figuratively, not literally). If you want someone to blame, blame me.
---
Thanks for the honesty. But seriously, don’t be a dick.
---
mmm
---
I am pretty sure everyone that has a job has too
---
Most new player groups in null give out free frigates to die spectacularly in.
---
Nano Vedmak is pretty fun. It’s just the frig that sucks :(
---
When did they report them?
---
Everyone vs you. Your stupid.
---
The item it produces is less valuable than the input material maybe? If memory serves many T1 items are produced at a loss.
