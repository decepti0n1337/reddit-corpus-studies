Uh, plenty? Like on in the last few minutes of the stream he struggles a bit to find one of the keepstars (plural? wat?) in system (and holy shit that's a lot of citadels...)

---
With the right overview you just switch to a travel tab, and all ships disappear so finding structures etc becomes easier.

---
That's said in hope not expectation, sadly.
---
Some of us still keep the old flame alive
---
I joined Dreddit because of Reddit.
---
It might not be as Reddit based as it was in the past, but there are still quite a few of us, and it's still a big part of our culture.
---
But whatever. You know us better then us I guess.
---
Oh ok, I never played Runescape, thank you for clearing that up.
---
You have no idea how triggered I am at the fighter management.
---
No, you're still not getting your freaking Lowsec gate.
---
Jesus Christ I can only get so erect
---
Are we blue to PL/NC/GOTG? I never knew
---
me and my corpmate were talking about that for hours, to both of us it was obvious he's mental state is not great. i wish it was easier ways to help out people you dont know, but you stil want to reach a hand out to. even if your only connection is that both are playing the same videogame. mental health is no laughing matter.
---
'Grow' and 'bot' are two different verbs, btw. Not synonyms as OP thought.
---
IIRC, incursion groups use bowheads to move they're ships and ammo around. But they're generally not going to a trade hub.
---
&gt;People bot MORE elsewhere. It doesnt mean goon have no bot.
---
People who get caught more bot elsewhere
---
Well, that's TAPI. They'd suck anyone's dick, as long as it is not PanFam or WinterCo. No matter how bad ot swarmed with bots.
---
PanFam just mad we didn't get them on our side first.
---
So... Turn everything into wormhole space? :D

.......disturbing.

Aren't we pretty much at that point now? UALX, X47 etc

That's why he didn't match TAPIrium's gameplay of blueing everyone

Goons didn't come, so you gave up.

Sorry dude.

How does it fare in structure bashing? I know incursion runners can be fond of the Leshak when they have towers to hit.

There's euro/au/us members in FRAT too.

Preaching to the choir, I agree with you.

nice karma farming, you gonna sell your account for what, 2? 3 quarters?

I'm around.  I don't do negotiating on behalf of test anymore because we have better people than I to do it (there are many with examples of how bad I was when I did do it, looking at you detective avery lewis), I don't do military stuff much anymore because we have pretty good fcs so I don't have to, I just hang out with dudes on discord and mumble and wait patiently for the day that someone finally decides to coup me.

I don't know. I really enjoyed evicting the north with TAPI and holding it ever since. Kind of like World War Champs of World War Bee. It's been good space for sure and I don't see the goons getting it back.

Holy shit, you weren't kidding lol.

It's popular for soloing in HS.  I think against a defended citadel it might be a little harder because of how close range it has to be but it still works well.
---
dont know much about sort dragons dignity, but i know my boys have stuff bigger than atrons to deal with anything of this size. we have dropped titans on shuttles, so do expect at least two battleships and we will lose one of them at the 1dq gate.
---
Yeah exactly.
---
nobody wants to have to listen to him complain about the goon conspiracy that CCP is only banning him every time he comes back because the csm told them in the leaked alliance recordings it was funny the first 3 or 4 times then it just got old.

And absolutely nobody is surprised

Actually you're blue to the entity that is 80% larger than us
---
Exactly so its only fun when you're on the titan blob side right?
---
Won? Doubt it....TEST is probably taking a short break or NIP with FRAT so they can have time to build up AOM to help them win on that TZ cuz they tanked and fed like the Salvation Army feeds homeless.

Reek- Racism Endangers Ethical Krabbing
---
They defamed a guy whether intentional or not and they had to correct that. There is no question on the other hand that GigX did in fact do what he was accused of doing. 1 situation was them correcting a mistake that could destroy a person's career and personal life, the other was them enforcing a policy regarding threats of violence against another player. You comparing apples to axes, there is no comparison to be made here.
---
oh i'm quite space rich, just haven't played the last 2 years or so.  sounds like i'll definitely need to make some contacts either way

Legacy alone reaches 1k+ on ctas
---
Basically, daddy goon didn't come in big enough force so we couldn't blob hard enough to beat the tz issue, instead we enlisted the support of the entire remaining serenity server to come in and help blob them, they agreed because you can still rmt isk on tq for decent money, but they're starting from 0 so we gave them omist so they can get their bots working and iron out the kinks in the programming so they can get enough titans to be relevant, it's gonna take a little bit but don't worry we'll get them, I know it's not easy when you're fighting all of eve and at risk of eviction
---
We what all want to know is where will PL go after Tribute falls, because it will.
---
i for one support the removal of europeans
---
it sounds like the perfect place to kill a lot of bots outside umbrella range of everyone.
---
That's quite a step down from the cool bands we had in Vegas 2018. It was amazing when those things finally worked.
---
wtf i love dinoposters now
---
Or the OP?

Absolutely based.
---
Champion of the turtle under the flat earth!

We didn't win the war with titans. Nice try though.

Would you stop being so damn articulate and sensible!

This is already hard enough as it is without you being all nice and strangely attractive!

Will miss you guys!
---
&gt; TIL winning is boring 
---
i mean... i woulnd call ''blueing up as many entities as possible, thus removing a fuckton of content'' winning but ok.. you do you i guess
---
Sperging about it in local is at its core a crude attempt to get random nerds from china in trouble with the government, petty, futile and only harmful to one single demographic
---
Yeah like KWG is sticking around for more than a few weeks. Lol.
---
&gt;I actually have a bit of hope that this is gonna have somewhat an impact on how things are at the moment..
---
you only want that if you don't plan to actually be part of this "war", for you to have any impact on any halfway big entity's space there will be literal months of structure bashing. Offensive wars are dead in the age of citadels.
---
Just stop. Put the shoe on the other foot. Then kick it. (I’d make a glove reference but ya know..)
---
Same. They should be gone by breakfast. Some sort of breakfast exit.

As we all know the German government has gone to great lengths to cover up the holocaust and censor information about it to the german people. Oh, wait. I think you miss the point entirely
---
I’m not sure if the first part of your sentence is directed at me personally or not, but Brave is pretty active in the test vs frt war and we do all kinds of shit, including boring structure bashing..
---
We can even call it Serenity.  No wonder we're embracing the refugees from there, they're subject matter experts on her to getter done!
---
I dunno, is it?
---
Why not?  This time they promised!
---
&gt; cuz they tanked and fed like the Salvation Army feeds homeless.
---
solid 7/10 burn
---
And as such, dead coalition was my invention, I have removed my approval for its use.
---
Yeah but aren't GOTG botting with the Chinese?  It takes bots to defeat bots!!
---
&gt; I really really hope, CCP has actually thought of Triglavian incursions  well enough so that they can actually do something good for the game 
---
Lmao, CCP would have to actually play their own game first.  Here's better it's just a reskin PVE shitfest of the sansha/drifter incursions.
---
That's part of the problem.  The current sov mechanics are so fucking broken that it doesn't really matter.  The Legacy VS FRT war has been going on for a couple months now and neither side has made any meaningful offensive progress, basically to the point where both sides have more or less given up.
---
But hey, CCP's on this, they're releasing...more PVE Assbyssmal shit content.  Oh.  Crap.
---
That’s what everybody has been saying that it will be another forgotten pve content, but nothing wrong with having hope and being positive right? 
---
I’ve been around for only about 4-5 months so I’m not really familiar with how CCP runs things, but I try to hope for the best regardless..
---
Maybe it's time for test to leave the goon nest now??
---
it is directed to you so far as I believe you're being very naive about it, you can be active all you want, being active does not make incredibly boring things not boring. 
---
I hadn't noticed the flair but now that I know you're in brave let me ask you: how's simple farmers doing? cause that's like what? 20 dudes in your space? extrapolate that to the sizes of any big coalition, with their own chains and having to do it all in hostile sov and maybe you'll get the jist of the cancer it would be. Nullsec wars are dead in this game, pure and simple.
---
GOTG are pretty much Imperium pets at this point, so yes to that.
---
2/10, needs more effort tbh
---
&gt;I told him to buy less carriers and get a 2nd monitor
---
&gt;falling for the one acc per monitor meme
---
you managed to give bad advice to evan mclean, that's pretty impressive
---
well that’s an obvious given.
---
KWG is almost surely test/frat 'renters'
---
Well said sir
---
hey... 20 isk is 20 isk
---
Yes and I was stating that I’m participating because you assumed that I wasn’t, I enjoy any kind of wars regardless of what kind, as long as there is pvp involved. 
---
Anyway, so having hope and being positive makes me naive? I never said that I believe those things are going to happen. Also simple farmers are making their own content, it’s basically them against everyone that they can tactically overpower or surprise that’s their play style..
---
I think you looked too deep into my post, I don’t see what the problem is or what did I say wrong lol
---
I thought whole EVE is fighting Test, not Goons.
---
We have tried, legitimately tried. There is only so much you can do man.
---
Thats actually better imo
---
Frat kicked Legacy even further into the dumpster so test is now hoping PIBC will help defender xix in tenerifis because with out goons at every timer test can't.
---
In fact TEST is worst than PIBC, they kill all their enemy by being blue with them.
---
I 100% hear you. Keep trying and bring some sense to people when it gets out of hand is all we can do. Don't go with the crowd of people cheering him on. Thanks for trying to do the right thing. 👍
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that too, people seem to be getting burnt out pretty fast from the test vs frt war, I’ve noticed the test fleet numbers declining for the past 2-3 weeks
---
&gt; content
---
&gt; winning
---
You realise these are two separate things right?
---
mmmm, donuts....
---
Wait, there's a war going on?
---
nothing.
---
Please just crush GOTG and get it over with, don't give them this last-leg bullshit even if it is for an anti-panfam vendetta. Let someone else take that space.
---
&gt;Yes and I was stating that I’m participating because you assumed that I wasn’t, 
---
??? there is no offensive war to be participating right now, no big one at least. And no the legacy v winter co slapfight isn't one, hell test effectively gave up on the idea in the first 3 weeks.
---
&gt;Anyway, so having hope and being positive makes me naive? 
---
yes?
---
&gt;Also simple farmers are making their own content, it’s basically them against everyone that they can tactically overpower or surprise that’s their play style..
---
i'm speaking about brave, the sixth(?) biggest alliance in the game, being unable to evict 20 dudes in their backyard solely due to citadel mechanics, and now scale that up.
---
Didn't experience it but was around when you could hear a lot if stories. Kind of miss that.
---
They are definitely Test renters, paying a sizeable sum for "protection". Will be interesting to see if they force AoM to be blue to their KWG vassals.
---
They are seperate things? What? Rell me more...
---
They have become the very thing they swore to destroy
---
One can only hope. I posted what I thought were well-reasoned arguments back in 2015. I even pitched them to the CSM rep from LAWN at that time, but it obviously never went anywhere.
---
Imagine when your only content is in Delve :( Sad days, it's like burst jamming Bjorn Bee Fleets.
---
The last 6 months has been peace. What are you forming for exactly?  
---
When the chips counted and we bore the brunt of the Goon sigs+camping, we were there and yes, [outforming DARKNESS at times.](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3681&amp;b=8046930&amp;e=180&amp;t=bqb) Even in [caps](https://br.inyour.space/?s=2902&amp;b=8000400&amp;e=150&amp;t=e).   
---
These aren't something to brag about but just something to counter the idea that somehow peace time metrics is what matters. It's what happens in the trenches. Good luck in your next war.
---
So when will they have reached the critical mass of ISK to be a stronk independent entity who needs no western devil ?

LMAO at the test members coping in thread

I see many Goons hate Sort so much on reddit about the bots? But I don't understand why Mittani wants to work with him.
---
Let me know if you end up looking to go entosis some more sov... :)
---
Stop reprocessing in an NPC station. Find a friendly Freeport athanor or tatara
---
Ah, a special, tell me, why exactly do you care who goons or test has blue, unless they're blue to the north they're removing none of their content.

See the latest red pen where Theran outformed Slyce

A quote from our FC after this was all over:
---
"Sadly, Evan survived" - apple pear
---
Are they blue to you?
---
the people who actually play the game in your alliance decided to stop and think about what an offensive sov war entails with citadels, and they came to their senses.
---
well they fed quite a bit too but lets be honest that hardly is an impediment on their scale.
---
One thing I know for certain; I sure as hell wouldn't like to be called REEKCEO
---

That’s more of what I meant and hope. We’ll see what happens!

What level of darks?
---
Peligro gave us data about who was permabanned.
---
There are botters who aren't permabanned.
---
There are botters who arent banned at all.
---
There are botters who don't ever get reported.
---
There are even botters who bot for a year, get kicked from alliance, then get banned.
---
It doesn't reflect any of that.
---
So you can't infer "no bots in delve" from that data.
---
True if big

There is no moral obligation for the watchers of the stream to not buttfuck him for everything he is worth if he chooses to continue doing it.

hi friendship thread thanks for the mention! i was on a plane, wifi was spotty so i couldn’t say goodbye to those that flown with me in the past 4 years in gotg, this was so sudden, just want to say thanks for all the fun times fighting together during wwb, hakonen, and finally taking our losses on the last war. victories and loss, it’s what keeps eve healthy and keeps us humble. i still remember all the stressful super and dread fights that had little tidi, they were so much fun though.
---
so far panfam, winterco leaders have been very gracious and specific! hopefully in the coming weeks we can find a home and transition 4 years of infrastructure from dek. im thankful sort and i came to an agreement to have a transition out until major unanchors are done. goodbye txme we will miss you.
---
I haven't either, I just show up here to wave the flag from time to time.  CCP needs to make some major changes to shake things up if they want power blocs to stop forming.
---
This like a new form of Goon fishing?

I took look at players from a hostile country, who burned down our own server and come to our own, and then proceed to rampantly bot and engage in the same shitty behavior, while living in a country known for anti-western sentiment and racism, and look at the response of people going "FUCK CHINA" as just...

Hey Riot, I mean to say this with all respect as an ex-SLYCE member, but this just makes you look really disconnected. There were many frustrations even internally with SLYCE not being able to form fleets and being rife with people who drop comms and continue to rat as soon as fleets are pinged, especially when they regarded an FC as 'junior.' It has picked up a bit lately but for the months I was there and actively in fleets, most FCs struggled heavily with forming fleets, and reaching a form of 60 dudes was rare and something only. A few of the more junior FCs trying to get started and get fleets running regularly got 10-15 dudes at most in home defense response. After Jhannis left this problem only got worse, and there was really only one "main" FC that could form anything larger than "small gang" in USTZ, and that was still a struggle.
---
There was frustration with your level of activity during that time, with you saying that you wouldn't come back if there wasn't a war. This last 6 months of "peace," I've seen a huge void of fleet participation from most corps, and a huge amount of FC frustration, from December to April.
---
I know you're trying as an alliance lead and coming back lately, and maybe it's true that we outformed Darkness. There are also some corps like SBBAL, SGU that had great turnout, great attitude, and really sunk their teeth into it. However, only being able to form around 20 dudes on average--that's real. That's a factual problem we were running into.
---
Left out a zero there. Fraternity alone has over 10 000 members.

We're number 1! We're number 1! U-S-A! U-S-A!

This music, it is amazing. in combo with the memes g8 m8 r8 8/8

That would require Test to display some independent thinking. And courage.

So no, it won't be happening.

The real boggler is why anyone would STILL work with Shart Dragon of all people.

Lmao Tapi is San Fran. Well, i guess Omist is San Fran and Test are the politicians hell bent on ruining it.

So, we are allowed only invalid opinions?

this week was a good week, i found a cozy wormhole to hang out in and gave some exploration frigates a fireworks show. One of them brought friends to enjoy the fireworks too! good fight, many explosions.

So... TLDR: Briscgate is not the same as GigX meltdown, though his meltdown can compare to Dead Co-Gate. Also note: per Mango and Dead Co... anti-botting is racism

The Test-Frat war ended a week ago.

Test needed goon support, which didn't come. Now goons are off to Tribute so Test has gone back home.

Yes I like that, like a watermark just to keep at a target level and it keeps you safe in case you slip.
---
Popping in here to ask, what is going on with those bot swarms? It seems like CCP will deface public figures quite quickly, but won't address the botting problem.
---
Yikes. I would actually say the same thing if it was the scenario you are talking about. We disagree quite a bit. I understand where you're coming from, just want to try and change the conversation and point out that the audience has some power to influence, and therefore has some moral responsibility. That may be where we disagree. He literally says on stream, "chat told me to do it, so I did it". Whether you want to believe it or not, the community and audience has an influence over him and therefore we have some responsibilities to not wring him until he's fucking dry man.
---
Actually I'm quite connected. Some of it was on purpose:  
---
1) **Don't depend on one guy or create a culture of half baked flash responses**. I think that's a fair call out if the design is a strong dependency on a singular person during peace time to run fleets. Or that we are attempting to create a strong rapid response force with pilots ready at the helm with one FC ping.  
---
2) **Stay sustainable.** I've ran daily fleets from 2014-2016? Maybe half of 2017? It isn't healthy. Having such frustrations on non-strategic engagements means there's too much dependency on people to be constantly ready, and stress levels and shouting (guilty on this too).  That becomes toxic.  FCs have to learn to chill.  
---
3) **Schedule the fun fleets.** This is most important. Sometimes I'll get 20, sometimes 75. But at least people knew it was scheduled and it was an option. Ignore the troll roamers. It's not a real fire, you don't have to ring alarm bells everytime you see 5 people come into local. You don't even need 50 dudes to fight 50 dudes, [sometimes 8 people is okay to fight a fleet](https://imgur.com/a52cuU5).   
---
  
---
4) **Let it be a fun game**. The new sov and citadel system allows for defenses on your best days. That means on the other tz's/days, have scheduled fun. Do bait ops. Stop worrying about random trolls.   
---
Now I've explained this quite a bit to every FC I interact with, in alliance or not, that this is what I have learned.
---
Obviously sometimes you gotta let folks learn for themselves.
---
B O B, Motherfucker!
---
But... but... jet fuel can't melt steel beams.  9/11 was an inside job!  WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
---
Yeahhh, but IRL politics would suggest thats up for debate. 🤷‍♂️
---
So, to hunt the china(wo)men in eve online we just gotta harass Test alliance? 
---
Easy peasy. Now to learn some mandarin and infiltrate their comms.
---
Maybe you should have thought of that before you evicted us from Vale and then followed us south and sat on our border for months.
---
Maybe you should have come hit goons with us after WWB.  
---
Maybe you should have hit goons after evicting us from Vale.  
---
Maybe you should have grown a pair before it was too late.
---
What is it about this, I’ve gotten all hyped up in other games, but the thing my heart does when something decloaks on you, or you’re about to decloak on someone is crazy, what’s up with that?
---
I'm not complaining friend. I'd rather have content than blue anyone who threatens me. Myself and my alliance mates welcome the "invasion".
---
Ben Shapiro, please DESTROY this shitposter.
---
I agree they have influence, but as a streamer, one should treat the intel for what it is: intel from an untrusted source.   This game is cutthroat and not everyone should be streaming it.   I think we do disagree fundamentally on the responsibility standpoint.  I feel if you are streaming, you 100% know the risks associated with it, and therefore the audience has no obligation to mitigate the risks the streamer is taking.     
---
I would say they might have a moral obligation to educate him about why he should quit streaming or not listen to bad intel/trolls, but I don't think its morally bankrupt to troll/kill his stuff, because he should know as an adult the risks associated with what he is doing, similar to gambling.  
---
If he were mentally ill and people were taking advantage of him I'd agree, but it appears he is of sound mind and has terrible decision making skills.  Perhaps you think he is mentally ill with an addiction to Eve, but I think in this case it is just a person making poor life decisions (CC warrioring).
---
Occasional mass banning of bots a few times each year, usually when player complaints reach boiling point. 
---
Whether it's because the security team is totally at capacity or CCP just wants the revenue and only acts when called out repeatedly, who knows for sure. 
---
Personal observation, but CCP seem pretty passive in regards to fixing actual issues and proactive at increasing(or rather, salvaging) revenue via new content and promises of change. Take from that what you will.
---
Can fly Stealth Bomber or Proteus?
---
One donut is like 70%
---
"We are the primary target"
---
No, this one is entirely on the leadership.
---
Wow, Finally a real answer, I’ve been asking for over a month and this is the first response I’ve seen.
---
Try forums.pleaseignore.com.
---
what was the funny meme that accounted for your other 30,000 blues?
---
"maybe you should have formed the big blue donut" "grow a pair".
---
Lol.
---
reek ?= stink
---
&gt;blue anyone who threatens me
---
Says the dudes that showed up to every Frat timer.
---
70% of null is going after 16% of null. 
---
This is Serenity for all intents and purposes.
---
They forget that the entirety of the South + PL were barging down our doors and were going to evict us, but hey they have to hang onto some narrative.
---
PGL has been doing exactly that on Tranquility, when the 2nd biggest group bends the knee to the biggest, the donut is simply too big.
---
So this is absolutely normal for him.
---
Don't question the narrative, okay? NC./PL are the only ones with renter groups that bots.
---
No, I think people are trying to explain how TEST have become the biggest enablers in turning Tranquility to Serenity.
---
And isn't NC/PL part of the same coalition, just like GSF and INIT happens to be in the same coalition?
---
You're vastly underestimating how hard it is to "address" the botting problem. CCP is doing work behind the scenes. There aren't any known standard fixes to the problem in the games industry--no magic wand that CCP can wave. It appears they're choosing to err on the side of limiting incorrect bans (i.e. CCP only takes action when they are quite certain the target is a bot, and not when they're only *mostly* certain).
---
Imagine being salty about smth that happened 4 years ago in a videogame
---
I will take that as a compliment :) it is true, just one of our corps alone has outformed all of slice every timer since we got here.
---
yeah lmao imagine paying 10b for a hel in 2019
---
Boooooooringgggg.....
---
Maximum TIDI fights and Goons can't lose whhhhhooooooo so funny.
---
Caps online have fun nerds! I'm staying in my WH where fights are fun and small.
---
This is over a year ago.... When we had a timer against skillu a few days ago where were these numbers? When we had 2 timers against snuffed where were these numbers?
---
Make sure to let rick know if he didn't try to control what people named themselves on discord maybe he'd still have an active alliance.
---
No, this one stleast isn't on the devs. This is purely on the lack of TEST leadership's lack of testicular fortitude. 
---
You're the second biggest blob bending the knee to the biggest, you're effectively the single largest blue donut. 
---
You're singlehandedly the biggest enablers (intentionally or unintentionally) in turning Tranquility to Serenity at this point in time.
---
I've relayed my concerns by removing the most active corps from their homes and placing RR/GWU renters, who seem to be all botters, will likely not drive up participation. We gave the best systems to the best PVPers and removed it from them.
---
As an actual legacy line member, its stiffling. Brave has a lot of blues that we wish we didn't have. Thankfully (dank leaks) we won't be fully blueing Mango or PIBC or whatever they're called. While neutral would be nice, guess bluetral is what we'll have to settle for.
---
They'd be the only fish left to shoot after goon, legacy and reek are done with the North.
---
PIBC leaves Serenity, joins Serenity.
---
It's not *all* on alliance leaders.... The biggest corps/alliances in the game are big because lots of people want what they offer and join them.
---
I'm not salty.  It's *your* problem that you couldn't think more than 2 months in advance.
---
&gt; It felt weird to have a separate server.
---
So close to being woken.
---
Your communist government forces everyone to partner 50:50 with Chinese government companies so that they can control what you see and hear. So they can influence your thoughts. We never wanted seperate servers that’s just life.
---
你的共产党政府强迫每个人与中国政府公司合作50:50，以便他们能够控制你所看到和听到的内容。 所以他们可以影响你的想法。 我们从来没有想过那些只是生活的单独服务器。

---
Tl;dr I changed my mind. We should welcome our chinese gamer friends. Remember #GamerGate and how some girl trying to hide her Blowjob story eventually woke up gamers to the News media collusion and first introduced the concept of Fake News...  think about where that’s lead. If we welcome then with open arms and point out the difference in quality in product between tranquility and singularity then we can i think we have the opportunity to troll the Chinese government into re-upping its censorship laws and problem solved.
---
WTB exotic dancers
---
GoTG can easily do that. But who is making up the bulk of those fleets? The Skillu timer was 200+ RR, 150 darkness. but none of this really matters, honestly. You talk about "exiting cleanly" yet this entire thread is a flat out awox. "we'll transfer our structure to whomever will try to hurt gotg" what the f is that and what does that say about your guys? Get a grip. None of this has anything to do with poor fleet numbers or bots or anything else. All that is BS narratives. All of it has to do with the level of toxicity. You can see that in the OP and you can see that in the root reason for the kick. being super toxic with other members of the coalition who otherwise get along fine.
---
Recruit better
---
Too bad they bought out the keepstar and assisted CO2 downfall.  Gigx would have provided you guys a lot of content.  Sure they stuck it to him, but really, where are you going to find a better chance to get an escalation and a bunch of supers to kill.  
---
Sometimes, evicting your enemies the old way and letting them rebuild across the map is the best way to ensure more fights in the future.  
---
The whole total annihilation thing only helps your leaders ego, all the line members lose.
---
What if I told you PIBC and frat guys used to be enemies...
---
Was its cock cut off?
---
Talk about spin lol, you’d have to be medically retarded to think that TAPI is good for the game
---
Eh, moot point. The ratio of dudes to fake bot accounts on there pushing for thirsty dudes to buy micro transactions are probably on par with east meets west and BGcupid.
---
Probably just an eve player tryna capitalize on our pay2play-ability.
---
I can smell the axe body spray and Cheetos
---
I mean. Look at the reaction it's garnered? Lots a folks seem upset which in itself is somewhat amusing.
---
TEST may have a tonne of blues today but think back to other alliances that had blue donuts. BOB might be the earliest I can remember getting called a blue donut. Then goonswarm when they were up north. Heck toss in the Russians back in drone lands.
---
Not exactly a platinum strategy in the long run.
---
(Disclaimer : I haven't played in a while so my memory could be fooling me)
---
I looked up the BBB rating for the company the owns it, and its absolutely appalling
---
Trying to determine whether snakes or halos would be better:
---
Dual Web MSB Hookbill.
---
Already has the speed to control range in most fights, so wondering if the halo's would be more useful in this situation.  Though the speed from snakes could make some of the harder fights more doable maybe.
---
Both sets have pros...just can't seem to make up my mind about which pros are better...opinions?
---
Ok Google. What is a sandbox MMO?
---
&gt;this entire thread is a flat out awox. 
---
LOL
---
Should tell panfam to stop helping FRAT then. Unblue GOTG or at least go fight them.
---
You know what they say about a fool and his money
---
MFW anyone not Legacy or Imperium is 16% of all of null.

Re:Zero − Starting Life in global server
---
I always have blamed The Judge for blueballing an entire late summer's worth of content. Damn shame. Tbh, buying out the keepstar was the only option - letting the goons own a keepstar in Impass? Probably wouldn't have gone well.
---
Sometimes you buy and ship, and it's just a bad ship. You never get good fights in it, you never get any final blows, you have weird things happen, etc etc.
---
Also, yeah, it's bad luck to rename a ship (unless it's a placeholder name for contracts or something), and it's bad luck to take a ship into combat without naming it.
---
Goons 2.0
---
pack light my ass!!!!
---
Haha ))
---
Well if you haven't matured by late 20s...
---
Duuuuuuuuuust in the wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnddd
---
Well, halos are cheaper by a large factor, and if you aren't relying on just speed to tank they are a good option. Snakes are great for most frigates though, so if you don't expect to lose your pod often then they will benefit more ships in general.
---
The age of Eve players more like Old Spice.
---
Having run a coalition rental program for over a year far larger than the one here there's literally no way to weed out botters until they arrive. Absolutely none. And when you're managing thousands of people it's impossible to check on them all while doing all the anchoring, iHub upgrades, logistics, and so on and so forth. You keep making this about bots and it's not about bots. how slyce handled the situation was piss poor. The GWU manager is new at this and I know for a fact he doesn't want botters in his rental program. I was the first to tell him about them and his response was effectively "oh sh\*t, I don't want to get in trouble like PIBC, how can we get rid of them?"
---
 Aw, c'mon big guy, it's kind of funny.  And at least I didn't quit before it was done, right?
---
Theres probably better ways to encourage small gang. For instance right now if you don’t defend your ESS you could lose what you worked up to. What if an ESS like structure is required to actually gain ratting isk in a sov system and you have to actively defend that structure or attackers will get your isk. This to me has a balance of risk and reward without really punishing the sov holder who already outrageously pays.
---
is this a game of thrones reference?
---
Literally everything
---
weigh the risks and rewards, you sound smart, I think you will do well. message me in game and I can send a few iskies your way in the form of some starting capitol for whatever you are going to get into, it isnt much a few million but its something.
---
Advice: Have fun, Eve is a game as much as anything. If you are not laughing you might be doing it wrong.
---
 take care, o7
---
my name is F3ND1MUS in game.
---
It’s TEST, it’s the only thing they’re good at these days.
---
&gt; Some time later we were replaced by renters
---
replacing blades of grass with renters is an upgrade tbh
---
Yeah what are people talking about, TEST are barely active here, and anti-TEST comments definitely DO NOT get downvoted 20 times. 
---
Just ignore them, namaste

Sadly, most testicles fall with old age.

wtf toxic somi
---
Gonna try to get up there. Should be able to drag along a corpie :)
---
Sixth biggest alliance on paper, you should pass by our space to see how many people we have active lol
---
More Dignity than PH/PL and NC combined though.
---
Did it actually? Honestly not surprised, as others have said that war was getting nowhere
---
Not gonna lie, I've been pretty impartial about TEST's decision making for a long time (I even defended Sapporo several times) but this is a fucking dumb move. PGL spergnig about Chinese botting one minute with FRT, the immediately turns around and blues the admitted largest botting alliance from Serenity. The group who, you know, destroyed their server. I'm letting my dislike for PGL color my opinion fractionally here, but it makes me look even less favorably upon an alliance I used to love.
---
What wasn't there can never be removed.
---
Looks like an awesome time. Care to give me a bit of a rundown on your corp?
---
"What's your name?"
---
...
---
"My name... Reek"
---
Wait NC PL Horde pretty much blued up frat..  what's the issue with Test blueing Mangos?
---
They are. Therapists are an alt FRT alliance. I think that was the joke.
---
Happy Thanksgiving!
---
Hey you blues Frat first... come on..
---
That's already the case, really.
---
Mate sorts a cunt he already threw Slyce under the bus once. When you guys were fighting goons and he moved the staging from Do6 to was it ZOY. So most of Slyce space wasn't covered by the super cap umbrella, which was were most of the fighting was going on.
---
Anyway i hope you guys in ROI are doing alright mate and find a nice new home for yourself o7.
---
To the wall with ye.
---
Well EM isn't flying around in 300-member fleets, either.
---
was fun and enjoy very much the fight yesterday.   o/  see you again on the battlefield
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
I'm remember watching that as a kid, with the guy infront of a tank.
---
Beep boop beep.
---
I was a member of test during the fountain war. Test was in a similar state and had gotten soft, eventually losing after a strong rally in the first half.
---
It then wandered around low sec, trimming the fat and building back to what it should have been.
---
The cycle continues, it seems.
---
True. From the reports 25 is a big fleet for them.
---
I hope they invade, take over lands and end the pain and suffering of what remains of eve  
---
Complete the donut then we can all go play scam citizen
---
Panfam is around 16%.
---
So kwg are better at not getting caught?
---
I love how i'm being dragged into this.
---
well alphas are free, it's not like it's going to cost you anything if you just want to dip your toes in and mess around with spaceships for a few hours every now and then.
---
You went to a good school. Upvoted.
---
Except it's effectively killed the game  
---
I miss the 2013ish days. not the terrible game of megablobs it has become  
---
Also from your anology, Legacy/test have teamed up with the "new bob" to ensure the dounut (the very thing that PBIC are leaving Serenity) will stand
---
So this comes after you guys keep failing at beating Frat? asking for a friend... :)
---
You must have a very long laundry list
---
No game will make you more pissed off nor will any other game give you a bigger adrenaline rush!  Plus, WoW is lame.
---
Hate to spoil it for you but tapi has deals with PanFam , look at the deal regarding the high sec trade for exsample , progod will suck anyone off for a bag of peanuts , but then so would I !!!!!
---
Nerd
---
What do you mean?
---
I'm past the alphas from before I think.
---
Mind to share fit? And which level of the darks?
---
Just curious who are you, you use my alliance tag.
---
If they don't work for pve then fucking pvp man!! Go get some kills!
---
Why do you think wow is lame? I dont like how it has become easier over time but most games have.
---
AAR: Corpmate managed to kill an [inserting hurricane fit,](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76669786/) the linked kill revealed a god-tier fit. His most *interesting* fit was this tempest.
---
That first bfg by those two titans. So bad
---
Used to run the Minimatar militia group for deadco to get TFI BPCs.
---
Yet this is probably how spaceships are fit in sci-fi movies.
---
Brut original for me thanks.
---
  Also nothing wrong with Old Spice
---
But who are you. Again just asking because it's the alliance I created and we are still active (just deployed in a different alliance right now)
---
Will DM.
---
Good to know TEST is the only relevant alliance in your eyes and are single-handedly responsible for keeping the entire game alive. Last I checked there were many other risk-averse alliances who are just as guilty for the current state of the game. The ongoing cold war of defensively bluing everyone is not as much of a TEST-created problem as people are trying to make it, everyone would do it if they could. There is simply no appetite for large scale wars in the current political climate and game mechanics.
---
Two autocannons for close-range defense, one blasters for heavy close fire support, two artillery for long-range engagements, RHML and HML will be complement for artillery
---
Doesn't seems wrong to me
---
I think part of the issue is how fucking awful CCP has pushed Sov warfare to be.  Not being bluetral at least to people nearby just leads to endless shit sov trolling that takes 10x more effort to counter than it does to perform.  Add to that, CCP changes have made non-troll offensive sov warfare practically pointless unless you like grinding structures for 6 months.   
---
All the while, CCP buries their head in the sand and keep devoting expansions to instanced PVE and incursion reskinning.   EVE is in a terrible place overall, but I guess that makes sense when the devs don't play their own game.
---
"Holding" the north lol I mean I guess you could call it that, only because goons have no real desire for that space anymore. Nobody lost a war harder than you guys lost to goons last fall. Absolute steamroll.
---
Okay, Magic 14 I will do.
---
One question. I am using also Astero for Relic/Data sites, but what ship would you then recommend for ratting in low-sec. or w-space if not Stratios?
---
Because Stratios can do both, ratting (DED) and relic/data. So I thought it would be best for my needs.
---
Just check contracts and the forums, you don't need 100s of billions. Think the last one I saw was around 40-50?
---
Was a great fight, thanks for inviting us along for the pew. Looking forward to the next one! 
---
Mea culpa are recruiting as well ;)
---
You do realise 5mil isk is nothing
---
Sort doesn’t like Panfam. Goons don’t like Panfam. That’s all the reason you need
---
could use some music...
---
Then you need to get over yourself and just accept it's part of the game.
---
Relax, its a new bro operating either without or against fitting advice.
---
Sort shouldn’t have signed that deal and everything would have been fine. Hard to be allies with someone who might turn on you any second, and it’s better to get them out of the way now than have them go traitor in the middle of a war.
---
Test poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague onto our houses!
---
As you say, hard to be allies with someone who could turn on you at any time, gj horde
---
After horde even got out of the way scurrying to geminate and leaving a power vacuum in fade.
---
Remove standings colours on overview. Job done. If you want to blue half the world you can show info check your targets or deal with the drama afterwards.
---
Thank you will try it!
---
Bob’s blue donut was at least territory they had conquered and let their pets own for them. 
---
Test is just blue’ing every major threat that it can
---
Don't worry when PIBC gets enough supers and titans, them and goon will probably just widot legacy, which would be fun to watch.

You're just jealous you can't be a mediocre FC with a shitty standing desk on twitch.
---
We don't care.
---
Can't really do that when 80% of null has some kind of agreement with test
---
I hope so
---
Well, PIBC made a whole announcement about how they weren’t going to carry over their previous wars to TQ and weren’t going to be pets of s nullsec alliance. 
---
Guess they were lying on both counts, which isn’t too surprising, but still
---
You are much larger than those combined, you are also allied to goons which makes you over 50% of eve.
---
Maybe? We can speculate all we want but the facts wont change. Elo joined an alliance that is running a massive botting operation while running for csm under the “kill the bots” banner.
---
Yea, 1DQ1 is a special place that will make you remove citadels from your overview. The last time I bothered to count it was well above 50, and it's only gone up since then.
---
He was pretty important during B-R, right?

This has been the norm for years.

---
join rvb, we have casual lowsec roams every night
---
Actually we had extensive talks with them about botting as it is a requirement for our protection.
---
Leadership will be kicking botters as much as they can.
---
Honestly, after KWG I doubt it can get much worse.
---
Another thing is that if KWG get stomped they will just go to other alliances that bot and we will have no way of controlling that
---
Oh yeah, good idea, although I'd have to check the mass limits of the C2-C3 static to be sure. I've not run a rattle before but good tip :)

why did you not pm this guy how to fit a ship you neets

Goons actually were not that outnumbered in wwb. Far from the numbers we see today with imperium+pets being over half of eve alone
---
Human rights are racist now.
---
Init forms almost as much as nc. Though, with snuff numbers are equal
---
Yes, conform to the censorship and suppression of the truth. This'll help the chinese nerds.
---
Pretty accurate AAR from UK perspective as well, other then not sure about the last part about phoons. We just undocked what we had three after the Thrashers. All in all super fun semi chaotic kitchen sinky and pretty even fight going on for hours, without being interrupted by some third party dropping 12 capitals and a titan. Thank you, and GF. o7
---
If TAPI makes up more than half of null players and goons are bigger than TAPI, that's over 100% of null players without even talking about all the other groups in null.
---
We're doing something similar in PB and tbh, it's discouraging as heck to just fight for nothing.
---
The ass-end of the universe is an excellent place to rat in peace and build a super fleet.  Won't take long for them to contribute to EVE 2019.
---
Hey bud, you're a fucking retard, that's all. Have a good day
---
I'm not that old
---
Rhymes better with Weak
---
What is the limitation on 'dick things mean people in EVE did to us'?
---
Oh, you're a frat pet, nice.
---
TEST is constantly on war, exactly to prevent becoming soft. I really wonder why ppl think TEST should be on war, when, if you look at the wars, most other alliances are in peace or in a truce state. And still, it's TEST who should not blue up, and create content?
---
I don't get this...
---
"boooo panfam attacked us once so I am forever butthurt".
---
Congratulations?
---
"booo you attacked us 4 years ago so we refuse to risk more than two dictors since then booo"
---
Now that's a cultural victory, the spirit of TEST forever broken.
---
Frat was not the largest entity on a Serenity, maybe?
---
Yes, a battle of blue donut against the only remaining enemy.
---
Are you still claiming you're totally underdogs?
---
Yeah I really don't understand how you can look at serenity and think that FRT are the bad guys and PIBC are the good guys who you need to help.
---
Making me upvote a goon ugh
---
Then again, it's getting harder to buy plex and omega with in-game grinding from what I've heard.
---
Maybe a post on reddit with about 300 upvotes?
---
Sadly no. Restricted to T1/Pirate subcaps. No cloaks or cynos either, for obvious abuse reasons. Some fittings are off limits but it's a very short list.
---
Still pretty good for F2P.
---
so what if Tests was larger? its not a 1vs 1 honor match at the sun
---
No, not everyone is blue, there are still lowsec and wormhole groups or even relatively independent although small groups in null. You are just looking for excuses to stay in your blue donut, my friend.
---
Lol
---
You didn't really expect that to happen, did you?
---
两个他妈的拦截舰!!
---
(google translate so it might not be perfect)
---
Friendly pre arranged fights have been happeninv since 2011. What did you smoke
---
After this probably never. Or maybe one last war for blue donut to smash the only coalition that is not in a blue donut and then you can all crab to your heart's content.
---
I clearly said that this is the only content that there will be if this keeps up.. 
---
I didn’t smoke anything, but whatever you did is making you dyslexic it seems.
---
no its 99.9999% basically its everyone blued except you.
---
I had the same problem, and someone told me that I'd eventually want a Heavy Assault Cruiser, so I'm training for an Ishtar.
---
Bigger ships lead to bigger profits, and that's what PvE content users mainly focus on. It's also way more costly if you get it blown up though, so be careful of that.
---
Not exactly sure about this though, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I don’t need an excuse to stay in my blue donut, I was talking about my personal experience as a new player..
---
Poor guy must have gotten his fittings from ccp's gameplay trailers
---
I bet in few months or years you'll complain about how CCP is so dumb because there is nothing to fight in null anymore and how it's so boring. That would be so funny. And also sad, I used to love this game.
---
Hey there! &lt;3
---
Must be fun to be in Test. Deploy to tye other side of the map for content.
---
That's already happening. You are under absolutely no risk of being evicted, some of yours even claim it's a positive thing.
---
Finite resources do not exist in this game.
---
Your definition of "half" is weird.
---
No?
---
There will always be Care Bears, I’ve been considering joining a WH Corp lately..
---
&gt;Telling people to put their money where their mouth is
---
  &gt;"LOL YOU'RE JUST MAD AT PL"
---
  :ok_hand:
---
I am confused. So is it TEST vs all of EVE or not anymore?
---
Stop leaking TEST strategy on Reddit.
---
which is also a blue donut...
---
Sounds like a boring way to think of this game.
---
What did PL do after the war?
---
salty!
---
whats this to you? more targets.
---
you dont?
---
Middle ground could be setting up in dital, you have a nullsec system next door for pi while living in hisec.
---
BS, if you are in TAPi and dont like it .. you can leave. If you are not in TAPI, more reds for you .. which is, according to the salty responses here, good
---
Wow. I feel flattered that someone's talking about me!
---
Looks like a meme fit
---
When did they stop attacking us?
---
Anything else
---
if it fits you narrative
---
Have fun getting in on conflicts driven by their blues.
---
How dare they grow so much the ncpl cant push them around as they chose anymore. That’s just bad for the game.
---
That hac makes me moist AF
---
Agreed that we need to do something about it but something fun. Not the sov bull shit.
---
Interesting.
---
So Tengu would be a better option than Stratios?
---
It's strange, because when I put in pyfa the DPS of Tangu with T2 (UniWiki PvE fit) is lower than Stratios with heavy drones.
---
Well let's get on that.
---
Renters Endorsed, Encourage Krabs!
---
I wonder how things would evolve if every region had an NPC constellation or was bordering a NPC region.
---
I get why CCP is going big on abyssal - most players are highsec and its content they cane access - but this would be an interesting shakeup for null.
---
There are 15 regions in the game that either lack NPC null or don't border a fully NPC null region.
---
Angel:  Impass, Impass, Feythabolis, Omist, Tenerifs, Immensea, Wicked Creek, Detroid, Insmother, 
---
Drone:  Cobalt Edge, The Spire, Outer Passage, Oasa, Perrigan Falls, Kalvela Expanse
---
Serpentis:  Fade
---
Of these, 2 border regions with NPC regions, but aren't fully NPC (Fade and Kalvela).
---
We see the local battles of small alliances that occur in Etherum Reach due to its access.  Its a shame we don't see that in more of drone lands.
---
These regions - many of them have been fairly dead for content for years, with wars being won or lost long before they see anything.  Look at some of the most active regions:  Delve, Fountain, Esoteria, Geminate, Catch, Providence:  all have high access to NPC areas.
---
My opinion?  a new, maybe 25 system NPC region, Drone Nest, and connects to all the regions with drone NPCs - with its one non-drone connection being to great wild lands.
---
Similar solution with angel space, or possibly add an NPC constellation to both Tenerifs and Insomother.  Give paragon soul a gate to stain.
---
Said no CCP ever
---
okay, that explains why I couldn't get through those level 2 missions, I didn't turn them on...
---
Nice bro!
---
in numbers that actually matter, like supers/titans yeah. id say its half v half. count krabs in, sure imperium/legacy have more
---
I see Squishy, I upvote
---
1. End the agreements
---
Or
---
2. Grab non-null players
---
Or PRK (people's republic of krabs)
---
have you seen this guys killboard? He feeds like its a play style.
---
The Chinese have to find this hilarious. Announce they are coming to the server and within two weeks some guy comes to suck their dicks for standings. They didn't even have to form a fleet.
---
What management? For almost a minute straight he repeatedly clicks on the torp volley and missile volley buttons but doesn't bother to read the pop ups telling him his fighters are out of range. I can't figure out how he managed to kill anything.
---
If he sticks around it might become one.
---
That fucking frigate trying to escape though lmao.
---
Give it a few months and gotg will be.
---
Can whoever is "alphaempire" on Reddit please DM me on Discord?
---
from CCP Peligro's recent post i though Init was the goon botting SIG
---
Based on research, the Tengu is known for it's long range missiles and flexibility, and it's tank. All of which the Strat lacks.
---
Plus you know that heavy drones don't always achieve the DPS they promise you they will, especially against faster and smaller targets.
---
The Tengu also sees use in lots of other things, not limited to PvP and missioning. Which the Strat doesn't do nearly as well.
---
It is way more costly, but that's to be expected of anything T3. Strategy Cruisers can be fitted to become HACs that are slightly better too, but if you're going to stick to exploration, the HAC might be a better, and definately cheaper choice.
---
Meanwhile Mauraders are going to be the epitome of sub-cap PvE content, but you are going to lose a small fortune each time you get blown up. Everyone and their grandmother will try to blow it up.
---
 Sino-US Trade Agreement
---
wut?
---
Just his thing, leave him do it
---
So PGL, who's dick is smaller: the Chinese or the Mittani's?
---
Guess which renter group most of the renters in PB came from though
---
we already know what happens when everyone bands together to murder zone goons. the coalition breaks up soon after and everyone goes their separate ways into several different groups.
---
now what would happen if goons and some friends evicted panfam? do you not think goons would then take out the next biggest super fleet, then the next and the next? do you not think we would have serentiy 2.0 soon after?
---
we never claimed to be good
---
Honestly he wasn’t even looking at where his fighters were, just mindlessly clicking buttons *facepalm*
---
Plenty of us who fought in it are still here.
---
wouldn't it be MAX IIII since the last war for goons was essentially them burning most of two regions to the ground and then headshotting all the staging keepstars making that war MAX III?
---
A lot of people use random alliance tags they don't belong to on Reddit. It was a popular meme for a while to see PL alliance leadership with imperium flair etc.
---
Both Russian and Chinese groups in games have the reputation they do for good reason.
---
Good.
---
You seriously think they won't bot? Botting isn't 'bad' for them.
---
I'll be waiting and I'll be killing the bots while being legacy. And if I'm kicked for that, fine, but I won't be the only one moving to enemies of TEST. I like legacy, I really do, since I've join it really feels like home. But I will not accept to blue botters
---
knife twisting intensifies
---
Not that they won’t bot. 
---
It won’t be to the same extent as leadership will put pressure on them.
---
It will be bots as in any other alliance be it TEST,Goons,PH etc.
---
This. Fckn lack of dignity. Gj test. Your contribution in making eve broken is silly. You should be evicted prosuckdickheads.
---
Here we see the magnificent Rorqual in it's natural habitat, where it will convert space rocks into a nutrient called ISK for the rest of its life.
---
When enough ISK is stored, the Rorqual can then use it to create lesser spawn; these new creatures either assist the beast in it's activities or defend it from deadly predators.
---
Sometimes, enough ISK is stored before the Rorqual has its routine breeding season, and the outcome is something even greater than the Rorqual itself.
---
Needless to say, 'Titans', as they are called, still feel affectionate feelings toward their mortal creators.
---
A single Rorqual can have as many as 1500 Titans ready to warp in its location.
---
Somebody needs to make a documentary on this.
---
Thread summary: NC members with no resolve literally think Eve is over if they are removed from their seat as the biggest haven for botters
---
I was thinking last night about Tangu - that's why I didn't use my skill injectors. I would also like one day to fly a Window. But that is long haul.
---
Hm, maybe I shouldn't specialize so much in Stratios then. Thank you!
---
I think I will use my skill injectors to get to Tengu. Since I can then change roles easily with Tengu based on my criteria for fun. :)
---
Yeh it's almost like an alliance is made up of thousands of members who might a thing that someone else in the alliance did was wrong. I don't remeber a doxxing incident involving us except the dumb DBRB thing.
---
++
---
you and all the other nullseccers that have been coming to us lately &gt;.&gt;
---
The difference there was that we were at most a 1k char nomad incursion who would set up shop at your doorstep, provoke some "good fights", if necessary with SBUs (great mechanic...), sometimes temporarily push you out of your space, but then move on to the next place.
---
Goons alone have 34k chars, before counting whatever hang-arounds you list that particular day. They have grown to big for any sort of content of that nature and by scaring the TESTs and ... well I suppose they're it now, of the galaxy to "non-invasion" blue status, there's no room for any single alliance to go create that content either. Hell, they even blued up the incoming Serenity crew before they could ~~train~~ inject Cruiser I!
---
My bitter-vet might be showing at this point, but I have my best memories of this game from the time where you would team up with Russians to fight NC one day and TEST to fight Goons the next and no one really knew which side BL or TRI would be on until the shooting started.
---
The fact that EVRY TIME someone does ANYTHING wrong deserving of a ban people start the 'the Mittani with the wizard hat at fanfest' rhetoric is pretty much a meme now. You don't need to compare every single breach of the rules with a thing that happened ages ago.
---
The reason the length of time is important is because in the intervening years the rules around what can be said in game have been tightened. Back when Mittani did his thing the rules about what people can and cannot say were far more lax. Now they are stricter.
---
Also nobody is suggesting  Gigx doxxed, he wasn't banned for doxxing, he was banned for making real life threats against a person's safety.
---
Plus leaked intel is pretty much always dangerous, including large fleets.
---
*Especially* large fleets.
---
You know the saying, one spy can do what a hundred ships cannot.
---
There's yet to be another game that pits this many people against each other, and just letting you in is a security risk.
---
You could always fly solo if that's what fits your style, or even start a new corp.
---
Just remember that any corp without the test isn't a good one at best.
---
Wrong. Because:
---
The biggest critics of the current Israeli government are Israelis. Example, see haaretz.com
---
What is « frowned upon » is equating Jews to Nazis via the « Israel Shortcut ». 
---
Israel is in a geo-political situation that is very different than China. 
---
Israel is a democracy with free elections, free speech and freedom.
---
Hey mate been a while nar I left half way through the goon war went back to j space came back to slyce to help Sheppard form icarus expedition and since then sir fuck alot has just been screwing slyce over an over again 
---
So who you flying with these days
---
I think he went full retard...
---
They have become what they swore to destroy.
---
While T2s are specialised tools, T3s are swiss army knives. You can do a lot of stuff in them.
---
Just be careful to not blow up that many.
---
Again: incorrect. Zionism is the political current that strives for the autodetermination (= the ability to decide of their own fate) of the jewish people in their historical homeland. 
---
The conflict relies in the exact definition of the borders of the country.
---
Delve, Esoteria, and Geminate have the highest concentration of players. Why roam for hours on end and have VNIs dock up before you load grid when you can have short fun sessions in cheap 60M hecates in densely populated areas.
---
His troling u. He god dual monitor setup plus projector on the wall. Thats why his allways turning his head to right. His stream is on that projector

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
I agree with you. It’s not racist but it’s stigmatising, has a clear objective to make Chinese players uncomfortable and points the finger at Chinese players. 
---
The events at Chienanmeng were horrible indeed, but it’s not the fault of the chinese players. 
---
If we all have this attitude, the Chinese players will leave international alliances and stay together, isolated. Is that what we want ?
---
Although im posting  this on a saturday morning, I'm having a lot of fun playing this game. (◕‿◕✿)
---
I got this reference.
---
goons forcing sort to rise against his former allies is some kind of satisfying irony to mittani probably
---
in reality none of us really ever gave a shit about them to begin with, and a lot of panfam would have been happy to invade deklein
---
it's hardly a betrayal when we were only ever allies out of convenience
---
leave the colourful euphemisms for mittani, this is reddit not goonswarm dotcomme
---
Hahaha, I'll do my best.
---
'Swiis army knives' - I like the sound of that.
---
Thank you, really. I am so looking foward to flying Tengu.
---
It's something new and special. I feel great.
---
&gt;  Or would you unblue everyone around you and start wars with everyone?
---
Well, yeah....
---
Personally I hope TEST backstabs them and keeps them from thinking twice about coming on to our server
---
I don't see how Israel being a democracy gets them any kudos to be honest. If anything that's worse because it means the populace choose that shit.
---
Everyone sucked their dick, test just sucked it best, I guess the rest of you need to up your game if you want to compete.
---
You start in a newbie npc corp, when you leave that and rejoin an npc corp (aka leave a player corp) you're moved to a new npc corp. Forever after, THAT is your npc corp
---
The bots can only farm with default overview
---
That's what I think is the number one priority in sandbox games, or games in general.
---
Setting yourself a goal and doing what you can to achieve it.
---
Good luck on your future voyages o7
---
Wow must be a fun and engaging gameplay for the members.
---
KWG will pay off anyone that deploys to shoot them.
---
Isn't every alliance working towards being the best? Not saying test is the best or strongest alliance but all from the top is competing. If they weren't test's allies they would be others allies. It's just how it works at the top
---
There are ways you just have to implement them.
---
Do blues follow this guy around for content too or just mostly ppl tryna kill him?
---
And yet you do. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
deklein isn't tribute my guy
---
Yet you are in Brave, one of the big cesspool alliances/coalitions. I don't mean this as a personal attack and it might be the only way to survive in null nowadays, but you're still part of the problem.
---
Everyone tried, test did it best, panfam are salty about losing again.
---
&gt; At this rate, in the next 2-3 years I can only imagine “friendly” pre arranged fleet battles and 0 wars, in other words whole of Eve would be blue.
---
Yep, it's what happens when all the movers and shakers sit in the same chatrooms and discord talking all day for 10 years, new blood would fix this but you all follow the same old leaders with the same old friends.
---
&gt;dinobrain
---
not sure where you're getting that from
---
did mittani tell you that was happening in this thread and then you just believed him because when has he ever lied to you?
---
Because seeing noobies apply standard MMO equipment logic to eve ships is adorable :D
---
weird flex from victim complex please ignore, but okay
---
I'm  sure your leadership would blue them too if they were open to it. Test just hates the colour red because It's the colour of communism, whereas blue represents freedom so they need as much of the map as possible to be blue.
---
Omg that's terrible, why would anyone do that?
---
Exactly. 
---
You too. o7
---
wow, i think perhaps this "meming" business has gone too far!
---
You weren't evicted ftom Vale, you ran away from there like little pussies after panfam finally managed to take Tribute.
---
good point. i am going to look in the mirror and say "Dark Ochre" 3 times. if He accepts my request for an audience, i will plead for Him to intervene
---
they constantly get told that it is, so, yeah, fun right?
---
I’m so thankful Origin joined frat for this war...if they hadn’t joined frat wouldn’t have gated a single fleet into immensea and my victim complex would’ve been sadly unfulfilled.
---
No salt, just amused.
---
how to bait people into giving me views on my youtube channel
---
TEST can look forward, and realise that the Chinese migration of the largest Blue-donuts ever created in Eve online aligns exactly with their own interests.
---
Is it *any* surprise that TEST would spread themselves wide for one of the largest landing-zones of Serenity to Tranquillity migration?
---
Is it any surprise that TEST can foresee one of the largest alliances in Eve online and attempt a political marriage during PIBC's infancy, this shotgun child wedding ^((I love metaphors)) being the perfect leverage to *maintain* blue with an alliance that, if the migration becomes a flood, may soon out-grow them in member-base. Like a kid holding up a Tranquillity Baby-photo-album to block bid Papa-Pan's swing ^((I got carried away with metaphor))
---
**TL;DR:** *"Surprised Pikachu Face"*
---
Just curious, just don't want people on reddit starting shit or saying things and my alliance getting dragged under the bus because we have the dankest logo in game. :)
---
You mean "going the easy way" but at the same time bragging about how elite it is to do pvp in the ebil south.
---
theres no need to because most bots are russian or well chinese
---
Fucking right, more big scale invasions pls
---
Haha fuck those guys
---
It doesn't fucking matter. Are you just pretending to be a morron. Or are you a morron. 
---
If an alliance of any size. Let's say the size of brave's active members can not evict 20 dudes spamming citadel's and evict them in their own backyard with a cap/supercap force. How the fuck do you want to fight an offensive war against an alliance like fraternity?  That even has sov mechanics to make it even more cancer to evict.
---
I was about to post something like this then decided to scroll down to see what I’ve missed the last 24hrs
---
you got an extensive blue list yourself. you are just salty because you couldnt blue the newcommers yourself. TAPI got enough content anyway.
---
Did they blue mangos?
---
your alliance is cancer, being blue with these chinese for is yet again damaging to nullsec, love how that post was like 3 paragraphs of bullshit to make out that it would be a good thing
---
test is not about that anymore, just a shitty crab coalition with supers, apart from that they don't like any form of war anymore.
---
I hope they will evict You until end of 2019.  Bot hunters will have a lot of fun in omist. Thank you TAPI. Well sold.
---
Should have pre-seeded supers last year
---
I get it, but yesterday in the chat stream no one was helping there may have been 1-2 people out of 300 that weren't cheering him on to do it. 
---
I'm sure you guys are trying to help him, I wasn't accusing you of not. I'm not in Goons, I don't know. I just said I HOPE you guys are, and it sounds like you're trying. Trying is also getting into his stream chat and helping him out. 
---
I don't know the answer man, but I'm just saying what I saw yesterday was a thirsty mob in the Twitch chat and I thought that was pretty shitty and I wanted to point it out.
---
Wasn't named that. Unlike the first two.
---
TLDR - we sorry, we blue, gg?
---
weird times, we live in, indeed
---
Did you even read the comments here?
---
buy orders
---
&gt; Comparing PH to legacy is a bit of a stretch isn't it?
---
Telling other people to make hard choices for your entertainment while sitting safe and cosy inside your own giant coalition makes it little more than a warmup routine.
---
Meant something else, changed it
---
Change yours to imperium, we all know you’re a spy for the good guys
---
You're missing the point. Most of us who roam thru dont give a shit about your politics and narratives, we just want to fight and kill ships. Ratters, miners, gatecamps, or response fleets, doesn't matter.
---
I GoT this reference.
---
Are you kidding? Literally everyone in mango is a botter.
---
Although Frat also has major botting problems, at least they aren't the group that completely killed a server.
---
That would be quite a shortcut
---
Go back to the abyss! Fall into nothingness that awaits you and your master!
---
It's Riotrick FYI
---
450? Whoa
---
Bots don't feel bored
---
Your alliance's culture is diluted thats fact. 
---
Same as most people in goons not knowing why they are called goons or what sma is.
---
I'm just waiting for someone I know to show up in one of these so I can relentlessly mock them. 5/7
---
This reeks of bait
---
Anytime PL/ncdot/horde would join up with FRAT as allies to fight TEST, TEST would batphone GOONS. There is no reason for anyone to want to fight in a war that is 99% of the time blueballs and 1% of the time 10% tidi. But that is TEST's strategy, and it has been successful in preventing any serious invasion attempts, so nice troll?
---
MDL is Michael Donnelly, not Markee Dragon. His name in RL is easily found, and this case wasn’t against him.
---
although I think you made some good points, keep in mind that a really big amounth of gsf members are actually not interested in any kind of pvp. 
---
yes, they are able to form an absurd number of people for single timers that they hype 2 weeks in advance, but at the same time Condis pvp Squads like Space Violence struggle to form a 150 man fleet with 2000+ characters online in EU primetime.
---
&gt; MSB
---
why not crystals?
---
Well good luck with the clean part. It hasn't worked well for alliances with gtog in the past
---
Not racist. just something the China players can get in a lot off trouble for see. 
---
There gov doesn't want them to know about it.
---
Suspicion of the skin being a twitch prime one is based on vellication. 
---
&gt;Vellication definition is - the act of twitching or of causing to twitch
---
Rise finally got a change that he wanted put through
---
Isn't the problem that those members even accept it?
---
To be fair, you can't exactly expect them to contest a nullsec alliance with new characters and few resources.
---
can't they put it on a ship people use
---
Wormholes as well, Leshaks are neat
---
how many weeks until this alliance falls apart, boys? I'm taking bets!
---
Honestly, this just shows how good GOONS are at the game. If you can manage to save evan mclean from dying in a capital, you've basically made it as an alliance.
---
Deploying to the other side of the map actually is fun.
---
I couldn't just set in Eso and krab while I wait for people to come to us the way PH does.
---
Vellication definition is - the act of twitching or of causing to twitch.
---
What is this witchcraft?
---
If you're talking about the LED ones, they actually worked the whole time. 
---
They were radio controlled by the DJ, and when people kept turning them on, we were turning them off until the part of the performance that we wanted to use them for :P
---
You couldnt, because literally everybody on your side of the map is blue to you
---
time stone
---
Just goons alone has like 2x the amount of titans as PANFAM
---
Good thing I like it like that then.
---
That mechanic is kind of impossible in eve, considering the vastness of available territory and variation on number of players over time. Should CCP just increase/decrease resource spawning rates every week based on concurrent players? Because that's a pretty hard sell on top of not exactly being certain if it'll work out well for the game.
---
Incentives could work better. If you can earn 10% more in one area than the other, that's going to be a reason to get over there and use that space. Lesser differences can also make certain space better than others, especially if it means different things (this space good for ratting, this space good for mining, mutually exclusive so it forces some spread, the absolute best ones require spreading out far whereas people happy with "merely good" don't need to go as far).
---
GOTG OMEGALUL!
---
You don't
---
Jesus thats painful to watch, i dont think ive even see carrier piloting this bad. Don't goons have like a basic capital training program or something? 
---
Good on him for still getting kills though :)
---
Acquire plex. Generate game time
---
If I were you I'd try just living with Spoopy for a month.
---
Look at br, EU
---
they physically can't due to the spaghetti code.
---
they told you this when they introduced them.
---
&gt; Your blueprints are at risk while being actively researched
---
No they're not, the only risk is losing the progress on current job.
---
So i just have to call Thanos?
---
But makes it even worse
---
Well that sucks, guess i'll have to wait then
---
Dang. Hey, thanks for educating me on this!
---
same here friend! I missed this friday time bc I went straight from work to playing, gotta get ready to move out of dek! :) 
---
have a good weekend.
---
Lmao nice retort
---
Why are you so bitter lol?
---
Read my original comment again. I said that I KNOW I'm biased. And this is not for *my* entertainment, it's for everyones.
---
But as I also stated, it's very unlikely. Don't get all salty over it
---
You're in brave you should be used to people who are new in dumb fits
---
He's obviously a new player who slapped things on his ship without an idea.
---
Wanna help him or just meme him? We were all there until someone told us what we did was bad
---
Sort Dragon in making :D
---
Hey penif! where arth thou molok?
---
You plan on going AFK for a period and want to pause the gametime? The only way to make use of the time is to have lots of skills queued to train while you're away
---
the fucking undertale music, the music that memes are built upon
---
Sort Dragon’s Avatar and his force of personality is why we won B-R. He is a legend no matter what he does now.
---
They're not blue to goons, they are neutral, the overview says so. No, they don't really shoot eachother, just for funzies, but whatever, they are definitely not blue.
---
Thanatos is the best I can do
---
this is the dumbest move ever ...
---
Wait, who are the *good guys*™ right now?
---
Counterpoint: LXQ.
---
Less salty more weary of the "the only moral coalition is my coalition" bullshit. Groups in EVE work together to fight other groups working together, and have done so since the beginning. The losers whine about it and have done since the beginning. 
---
The only possible answer to foolish demands to quit one's allies made by people with massive numbers of allies of their own is  "Sure, right after *you* do it".
---
Tapi is on the edge of extinction, they have to do it or they will get evicted, it's not their fault
---
You can't do this yourself, but you can file a support ticket and ask CCP to kindly deactivate your account. I don't know if they still do this, now that EVE is F2P though.
---
&gt; TEST is a primary content denier.
---
That's bullshit.
---
I've been back to Eve for half a year. In that time we shook up highsec, deployed to fight with Horde and started a war with Frat. What do you call that, if it's no content?
---
I this real????
---
Yep, and you can't do shit about it but madpost, get fucked.
---
Test grr. Test successful.
---
No i just wanted to get tons of Daily Alpha Skill Injectors, and i completely forgot i couldn't use them as Omega, and since i'm in Singularity, the prices for regular skill injectors are off the charts, it's nuts
---
i think it is a bonus, allows people who spend big on modules to not get fucked on their killboard,
---
Exactly.. isn’t with slyce ..
---
There are even Screenshots proving your point
---

Having a ton of fun with this nano HML drake lately. Heats a web to 15km and points to 34. Shoots out to 96km with a max lock range of 81.
---
Mango #1
---
Wrong, a lot of people are that simple minded, or just are playing that little attention, it's quite common for such retards to krab
---
We know enough to distinguish retards from bots. We have seen plenty of each.
---
edge of extinction? please explain you facts on this.
---
The best bit is how they're acting like all their HC wasn't also trying to get pibc to join them, just salty they could offer nothing but incompetence.
---
please explain your facts on this
---
I personally welcome our new friends to Omist.
---
Please undock (yeah right) and come down and back up all that whiney posting you faggots are doing.
---
You won't.
---
Im homeless
---
Choices in Eve:
---
1. Blue up all your neighbors so you don't have to deal with frequent border skirmishes and can provide long term safe bearing for members. This leads to a strong Supercapital force - the only thing that truly matters in major wars.
---
2. Make all or most neighbors neutral so you can fight them frequently but you don't have enough time to carebear. Your players might get better at anchoring and pressing F1 but your supercapital force is delayed. You then get stomped by a group with such a force (See: CO2).
---
Hmmmm, what is the better choice to survive as an alliance/coalition... :bigthink:
---
Wait didn't PH literally go fight GOTG until Test announced an invasion of Geminate? And isn't GOTG about to help the Imperium invade Tribute? I'm pretty sure GOTG has switched from the pamfam blue donut to the goon/test one...
---
**livin' on the edge**
---
Look in your redemption thingy on the login screen. It is all the way on the bottom. I think you have 180 days.
---
Cheers my dude! Expires 2019.11.07. Dunno how I missed that ))
---
Just claim the item and it will be saved in your reedeem window. In the reedeem window its directly stated how long does the item can stay there untill its gone.
---
Cheers.
---
Its called sarcasm
---
Time to make more insecure manchildren unsubscribe.
---
any sane person would remove citadels/structures/stations/gates from general overview. You can make a travel/dock overview to get those.
---
(to be fair gates can remain when you often play around gates)
---
Do your own research you lazy fuck
---
FFS I wondered myself if there are really people who ENJOY making 6 times more click rather than use ONE shortcut to do the same action.
---
Now I have my answer.
---
what's cap ? what's point ? - evan
---
And this post is what? A confirmation on your ability to pvp or you being mean?
---
Cause that is clearly a new player and instead of teaching him/her the right concepts in fitting a ship you mock.
---
Kinda low.
---
Lmao was that a “ bling bling “ vocal at the end ???
---
Can't you redeem SP while undocked? I'd give that a try, as it creates no item but increases the character's free SP pool.
---
hey now when something keeps turning off on us unexpectedly some people might call that broken :P
---
Mock my balls
---
Because I meant MSE :D
---
i want that, only because its purple
---
So you’re playing on the test server?
---
Taiwan #1
---
Cheap
---
Test is economically very weak. Our Titan prices are still in the tens of billions.
---
not bitter just saying it how it is
---
now thats not a way to treat an alliance member.
---
PIBC were in talks with every major group, go ask your HC or PIBC if you doubt me, any group that didn't would have to be monumentally stupid.
---
Everyone's been telling the North their leadership is incompetant for 3 years at least now, they've been proven right time and time again. The old guard haven't got it anymore, they're just happy to keep making cash and nothings going to change anytime soon.
---
Thanks :).
---
!RemindMe 3 months
---
40b at GSF
---
Well that is until you get awoxed by blues for gating a JF.
---
Seen it happen.
---
if you thought this had a happy ending, you weren't paying attention
---
thank you. im out to sea currntly im just trying to gather as much info i can from reddit the navy doesnt really allow much communication to the outside world at time lol reddit is all i have for game updates. hell i cant even look at evenews24. so im pretty bummed. also im super stoked that one of my own alliance members thinks  im lazy...
---
mango only has 1100 members stop bitching..
---
42-49b in Test depending on corp
---
40-45 bil in GSF, paid 43 for my avatard.
---
yes, do it.
---
Reddit automatically removes quickmeme.com. This is good because your post is terrible.
---
I dont like to go for easy mock. Your genes did enough.
---
This entire thread: "nerf diplomacy"
---
Is that a real skin?
---
Maybe. I brought out a three man dessie and frig roam the other night  that escalated to a capital gate camp. Wish I was joking.
---
You meant Congratulations!!!!
---
About three fiddy.
---
DCU not a great example, they were always just trash.
---
to be fair some people in test actually believe this
---
Impressible work from Legacy diplomats.
---
Come to Provi
---
What happened with skillu?
---
A fucking item hangar migraine
---
Ok taef, enough posting for you today
---
There’s a solution if they don’t listen:
---
1): Kick them from fleet.
---
2): “Primary is the Harpy, and kill the pod.”
---
If words don’t do the job, that will.
---
lmao, init alone is bigger than pl and nc put together
---
in that case, just do a snake set with halo omega ^4head
---
Do you want TEST to just role over and let you butt fuck’em? Getting every advantage possible is how war works, fuck fair fights, this isnt low sec 1v1.
---
The major turning point in WWB, the Battle of M-0, after which CO2 swapped sides, was about 3200-3300 vs 1500-1600.
---
not in terms of super numbers.... it's easy to account for PI &amp; Jita alts
---
Look at all these salty cunts lmao
---
Because people stopped logging in, because leadership literally said we're not defending this space
---
Numbers were even, fleet numbers were not
---
omega implants without their counterparts don't do anything
---
what big coalition is TAPI blue to on tq? their definitely not blue to goons, we fight like every day.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
WOOOOOOOSSHHHHHH
---
the goal for them isn't to be right, it's just to yell loudly
---
You need to get organized now, but it's possible to kill caps. 
---
For reference my corp lives in a c2 and our static nullsec connection can only fit 2b of mass through, thats 1b of mass if you want to be able to get home (with variance sometime the maximum mass is 1.8b, 900m mass for 2 ways).
---
Have a good support and ewar wing, booshers for extraction/splitting, links, a bhaalgorn or two, etc. 
---
If you know what you're doing you can pull off some crazy stuff.
---
I can't tell if you are just being optimistic... but you ACTUALLY beleive that? Lol.
---
impostor detected, elimination protocol sanctioned
---
I guess the point I was trying to make (and failed spectacularly it seems) is that this shit never lasts. TEST used to be tight allies with CO2 and that didn't last. I'm amazed anyone still allies with Sort Dragon but he seems to have a knack for kissing ass or something.
---
We're not down here for good fights.  And we don't care about if pgl or vily thinks we're blobbing.  They've talked so much shit about PL and how we aren't committed to our deployments and how TEST is this battle hardened group.  Well we're here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They're going to be homeless soon.
---
Pepperidge Farm always remembers.
---
well this is eve. see last year? everyone blued each other to pile on tapi so ofc natural choice is to seek help from elsewhere. would have been nice conflict between hre and winterco vs legacy since super numbers were somewhat even, but panfam gets involved and that drags goons to fight too who would have guessed. blob or be blobbed
---
Your narrative is such a mess I'm not even sure your spod brain line members are buying it anymore...
---
Free because I mined it myself
---
Lucky he never came past JU system and seen our camps.. i mean stations
---
Nah you can’t.
---
please point them out, i'll wait.
---
Ehm, you know our glorious leader Sapporo said so himself right? Frat is almost blobbing us out of our sov
---
in case of SP rewards, you can drag and drop them in your character select screen and they go to unused SP and you can apply them in space  
---
also for all the rest of the rewards once you claimed them, they will stay in your redeemable items queue for 180 days so as long as you get into the station you want to collect them in those 180 days after claiming the reward you are fine
---
Sapporo.
---
imagine being a guy that thinks TAPI is narrative driven in current year.
---
- Some frat FC, probably
---
Imagine if this guy actually think he isnt a goon pet
---
isnt tapi on the edge of being evicted by a huge coalition? whats wrong with them having allies?
---
2k alliance deploys against 30k coalition, 40k coalition brings 50k coalition, people gets shocked when they loose.
---
Losing 4-500bil in machs is a weird way to not defending someone. Mine was one of them.
---
look how dumb you are
---
Yes yes, some of those are dead and only lasted for a little while but you get my point
---
So you are saying you just want the other null factions to feed into you. That definitely sounds like the solution to test blueing everyone
---
you just need a character in skillu, trade lorq vonray for your erebus/avatar as long as you're not some blow in shitter
---
So your saying they already won Eve?
---
Word on the street is if you know a guy, it's roughly 35 bil
---
"We must defeat the evil chinese botters!" "It's us VS all of eve!" "It's the norths fault we need more blues." "If we don't win we're going to get evicted by the chinese botters!"
---
I know I'm reiterating an argument that you have definitely already heard and I already know the usual responses to, but:
---
&gt; Your players might get better at anchoring and pressing F1 but your supercapital force is delayed. You then get stomped by a group with such a force (See: CO2, DCU, Tri).
---
I was sucked into EVE by the constant conflict and fights. I've never seen anything in another game quite like it. While no one wants to be on the losing side you've got to accept that every fight has a winner and a loser. I understand carebears who just want to shoot red crosses all day and never be bothered thinking coalitions are great, but for folks like me who actually enjoy the pvp fleet aspect of the game it seems shortsighted at best.
---
Where's goons?
---
Legacy is larger than frat+nc+pl+horde.
---
wew
---
i think you are highly overestimating Condis ability to execute a campaign of this size against a coalition like panfam. 
---
hyping all the krabs for 2 weeks to get a fleet together for a single timer like they did in x47 is one thing. 
---
maintaining high fleet participation for weeks or even months against an experienced pvp-only group like ncpl is completely different.
---
I just want to farm salt, thats all, farm it as effectively as possible
---
Goons paid CCP to omit them from the chart those cheeky cunts
---
You're not like me, Haef\_, I'm an advanced prototype. Made of mimetic foreskin
---
If you think sub caps could win that war you dont really know alo about it, i'm guessing you were another f1 pusher with no real sense of what was going on.
---
Truth is you didn't defend with all you had, you could have.
---
My main point was you not logging in anyways, numbers were even but uou failed to utilize that
---
also getting evicted isn't bad because you lose the space, it's because you lose the members
---
kinda wish they'd address that in eve
---
Which is pretty fair, i dont understand how they dont understand this.
---
so you've got headcanon?
---
in that case is the age in days done from the opening to the closing of the alliance, rather than the opening to present day?
---
Your point?
---
Ssssshhhh. I dont think he knows that it gets wiped and anything he does there, doesnt matter
---
Scheduled t1 cruiser fight yickes lmao
---
Look at your flair lmao
---
on the bright side, i won't have to bother with a twitch prime thing since the skin will be pretty useless.
---
Super Cool.
---
Noob question - what data is available for you to do this? Does eve have apis for devs/modding etc?
---
If true usually you get membership time with prime things winwin
---
start at 6:30
---
Oh man, thank you! It was because I was trying to redeem the physical item as well - can’t believe that wasn’t obvious to me. Cheers bud
---
[deleted]
---
55 bil in Providence
---
what else do we spend our hundreds of bot earned isk on?
---
You're retarded.
---
The coordinates are available in ESI and the SDE.
---
kind of pointless if you don't also stop adding days when the alliance stops existing
---
Any docs/resources for that?
---
❤️
---
https://esi.evetech.net/ Have  à look at the `/universe/systems/{system_id}/` endpoint. I'm not sure the coordinates are relative to the centre of the universe. Maybe relative to the constellation or region.
---
There's a public data dump that includes map information among other things. There are some APIs but mainly it is more for external tool development. I think there are strict rules against any kind of modding.
---
Yeah, dead alliances are irrelevant should’ve removed them from the chart altogether
---
that was not what i intended to imply
---
Here's hoping - The HQ System should FORCE some fights at least,
---
[https://giphy.com/gifs/MJ0sxcBzT3mTu/html5](https://giphy.com/gifs/MJ0sxcBzT3mTu/html5)
---
Yes, but currently it's data is only on the test servers.
---
Very strong argument.
---
Right, because it's wrong of somebody to come back later and say "Hey, remember this half-cooked feature limited by technical debt that I as a player would like to see finished? It's still limited by technical debt you will need to clean up at some point, and I still want that feature to become cooked through." 
---
It's a StainGuy post. He knows they said they couldn't do this before and is mentioning it again because, like I said above, it's a feature that was rolled out half-cooked to get the new shiny in-front of us and somebody would like to see it finished. It just so happens that somebody is yet again StainGuy, so for the next week you might expect to see nothing except horrendous spin-off ideas from randoms suckling at the teats his incessant shit-posting, which i'm sure will get the creative juices flowing some more awful ideas on how to fix FW, racism, or whatever other dumb shit the community wants to screech about next.
---
can confirm, probotlegend showed it to me.
---
Funny last I checked we weren't blue.
---
&lt;3
---
I feel the need to mention this was not done via coordinates, as this is explicitly to do with jumps and not distances.
---
Damn. Really proved me wrong there kiddo.
---
The black monolith is not black, its translucent
---
Then what's stopping you? Oh wait we should make things easy for you and drive away our allies so they can instead help you?
---
So relative ban rate = days/total ban %age? Never heard of a rate without time on the denominator
---
I actually really want Peligro to release where we are in the rankings. Are we #26? #50? Lower?
---
The prices are see listed here make Titans look like pretzels.
---
Back in the day they were 150 bil sans fitting. 40 to 55? That’s a fucking joke.
---
I used to join russian botters but it wasn't on tq. And there was always at least one guy at they keyboard to look after everyone else. You guys assume bot runners are stupid but many are not. Some are very talented pvp players as well. If you were to bot under an umbrella in a dozen supers, why would you not keep an eye on them making sure they are safe.
---
They're just salty
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Just like you throwing ad hominems and talking about how subs don't matter proved that goons weren't outnumbered in wwb 2 or more to 1.
---
62-80b in BOT.
---
To be specific:
---
Call ESI (EVE API) for system IDs
---
remove jove/wormhole/trig IDs
---
get system data for each system ID, grab stargate IDs
---
call stargate IDs, get destination IDs, use to form datastructures of form ["Tanoo", "Akpivem", "Sasta", "Yuzier"] (which means Tanoo is connected to Akpivem, Sasta, and Yuzier)
---
turn those into lists of links
---
["Tanoo", "Akpivem"], ["Tanoo", "Sasta"], ["Tanoo", "Yuzier"]
---
feed into networkx
---
run algorithms
---
grofit
---
You were outnumbered because you didn't commit.
---
Someone doesn't appreciate easter eggs
---
If your settings are somewhat between "I run this game on my calculator" and "I want my game to look like a Discovery Channel space programme" THEN it might look completely black (like, Vantablack black) from SOME angles
---
An alliance with 1 ban wouldnt make it to the top list btw
---
wrong? no.
---
stupid as fuck and a waste of time because no amount of asking will change the facts that it can't be changed no matter how hard you request it? yes.
---
*Citation Needed.*
---
Honestly PL is pathetic. Shadoo is probably rolling in his grave. They've basically completely lost their mystique at this point. Before they were always "special" but at this point they're not really any different than any other nullsec alliance and are at best third or fourth strongest strongest. They can't even get anything done in the AT anymore. They're no longer "cutting edge innovative". Their stable of top tier active FCs is at a low point. Compare them to NC. which has adapted pretty well to the changing meta. They can't even dread bomb anymore, just look at their last few attempts on TEST Alliance and INIT. And yet somehow when an up and coming group like CVA decides to dread bomb them in lowsec, they lose a super carrier? Horde is a way better alliance now, and so is NC, since PL has just refused to adapt to the current meta. Sad
---
Nothing's stopping me. I have no blues and I roam freely anywhere. I'm not in a large nullbloc.
---
Calling me mean names won’t help beat TEST though
---
They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
So did peligro post another pie chart or are you taking the statistics from all bans and saying that they are bot bans?
---
With Bob, all things are possible.
---
then what is your formula? because i assure you
---
 
---
    365.25 (days in a year) * 12 (approx years since alliances existed)     
---
    / 0.01% (lets assume 1 ban is 1% of all bans, even though it definitely is lower)
---
    =&gt; 4383 / 0.0001
---
    =&gt; 43830000
---
pretty sure that's higher than the .009 at the top of your graph
---
i'll pray for you.
---
I also wanted to see where NC and PL where at on that list
---
Dont really care about beating test though
---
I can honestly say Test is bad.
---
Then quit bitching about it
---
The meta changed, the mercenery renter platform doesnt work anymore
---
Pl didnt change, the game did
---
Eh, I wouldn't expect anything magical out of that. They've spent their entire existence petrified in fear of lossmails, which causes anyone who wants to krab to generally avoid doing it under their banner, bot or otherwise.
---
They extorted botters into rmting unnatural titans to hand out to their members.
---
I'm not the one acting like test is a pvp powerhouse that stood against a bigger enemy and is in danger of being evicte, when the reality is that you are the 2. Largest coalition, allied to the largest coalition.
---
This is really nonsense because most of the alliances that look better than the first ones are the ones that have long periods of inactivity. You are also not taking into account the size of the alliances which is quite a huge deal.
---
‘Back in the day’ of 350m pled too. So the actual value was absurd.
---
I recall when CO2 got stomped out of Tribute and Test held Vale they didn't even bother to fight. They folded like lawn chairs and ran south. Proving to me at first sign of any invasion they will fold again.
---
&gt; I guarantee you the majority of their member base remembers their time there fondly. 
---
I was in CO2 in I think 2013 or 14, can confirm. GigX was a nutter, Tiggeress was a massive a-hole, Alphastar got us awesome fights, although his voice hadn’t gone through puberty yet, and Kief / Lucien got me fucking drunk and high on every op (drink smoke drink drink!) and I am absolutely grateful for that time, was a blast.
---
This is pre emptive brown nosing of the highest degree. 😆
---
So which is it? You ‘know’ northern leaders tried to get the mangos to join the north, or the northern leaders were monumentally stupid and didn’t try and recruit the mangos to the north?
---
When was i crying about being scared of being evicted? Alright whatever bro, ill make sure to feed next fleet to make it more fair. Fly safe bud👍🏻
---
200 dollars
---
Test showing their friendly nature 😊
---
They had a lot of zoom, and some fins, but not many mid slots lying around, but they decided to give it a go anyway and here we are.
---
Correct. They didn't understand the original pie chart and are trying to repost it to push a biased narrative.
---
Ye but once you get some more space the members come back and fully utilise it again
---
I feel like he just wrote the fraction upside down in the graphic...
---
Free in Branch.
---
Monoliths being hidden jump gates when
---
You really want to full universe data for this kind of analysis. You can get the full data dump from fuzzwork: [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)
---
Best to load into a database or analytic tool of your choice. Then you can go nuts.
---
SDE actually has coordinates for all stationary objects in space down to meters.
---
w8 aren't you going to war cus NC and PL is botting so much?
---
Considering the trend now is to bot on 750k sp alphas that get routinely banned, it's not as fair of a comparisson to the nightmare bots of old. Both PIBC and Frat have had some of those throwaway botters, while the older rental empires didn't exist.
---
Please don't spam the APIs if you just want to extract coordinates for all systems. Instead download the SDE. Much more efficient. [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/)
---
&gt;So which is it? You ‘know’ northern leaders tried to get the mangos to join the north
---
Obviously its the bit stated and not the bit you tacked on, I know understanding is hard for you Harvey but but I have faith you can get this.
---
I know this is sarcasm but I would like to post this anyway.
---
Nobody can go extinct in Eve post March 2019. Thanks to the triple jammers and superb time durations they have. In fact, the sov map will be static until CCP changes the mechanics.

Going to war for something to do.

There is always some story to role-play along to to help motivate people, and direct propaganda.

Tangentially relevant, IIRC Jita has the most adjacent systems within 3 jumps.

This guy just got out of statistics 130 I bet.

&gt;maybe you should read what i wrote a few times more...
---
I have to say: Theons hopeless charge against the Night King himself. You need to have balls for that!
---
Wait ...
---
Interesting
---
And fall Titans under SRP?
---
very valid concern but I was having trouble getting python to properly traverse the SDE. also again this is not to do with coordinates but jumpgate connections
---
Blue ocean is under represented, but is good overall.
---
I can only hope to be this good at this game (or that rich in real life)
---
Whomsd't is the Sun?
---
One quick blowjob in all alliances
---
i bought a new titan so i am very happy and hope all the bright eyed newbies who want titans can someday have one or ten
---
That's why accuracy is important, little mistakes like that present much, much different data
---
So update since down loading again after 7-8 year hiatus. Also first pc game in almost as long period.
---
Lvl4 in Dodixie with my Absolution (they changed the model but i remember my ship 😍) poor drone control had me warp out and abandon drones to go back in and scorch pop frigs that were webbing. Took 1 more warp out from battle ship fire with one more frig left.
---
Remembered to right click and warp to way point rather than personal assets, right click station, warp to..... which was the only way i remembered.
---
Went back in, cleaned up playing with range and ammo types. Scooped drones up to redeploy, didnt lose any.
---
Grabbed my dessi salvager, tractor and salvage all. Turn mission in.
---
I remember why I loved this game after just a basic lvl4 mission. With a WHole omni tank fit Absolution with two empty high mods.
---
Now to figure out what I want to do. My subcap training is quite clean with 3 factions and moat weapon types close to or at t2 mods. No hybrid or Gallente training.
---
Sadly my play time is weekday nights for few hours at a time. I am turning to this post looking for some advice in where to focus training, and what kind of viable solo or small group skirmish/pve I am able to do at current experience and training. (64 mill SP predominantly combat trained)
---
I caught you stalking me on MySpace.
---
Did they poison the water with something that turned frogs gay?
---
Look at all these people you can't shoot lmao
---
Based on the salty expression, panfam
---
Nice
---
I’m just surprised that NCPL would want to befriend a bunch of new players instead of kill them, do you have any sources for this ?
---
I have faith that you can back up what you said, and in so doing help me to understand.
---
Cool for you bro
---
Check r/evejobs you can find corps there, also just a personal advice, if you’d like to bond easier with people aim for a smaller group or maybe a wormhole Corp as you mentioned you’ve been wandering around in them..
---
lawl
---
as most bans where forced because they got reported you'll not find goons on this chart.  
---
Mittens say that goons are not allowed to report other goons. SO yeaha. No goons.
---
I like that the back of the float is a blue donut with sprinkles.
---
And how will zkill know if that officer module roll destroyed it's stats to be as bad as a t2 module? Are you going to value a broken module literally no one will want at the same level as a perfect roll that's worth more than a super?
---
Critical thinking must be a growth area for you.
---
Does EVE have music anymore? Whenever I'm out in space, some weird thing tries to play but barely resembles music.
---
not true, I recall a mango destroyer fleet looking for content in BWF-ZZ a few weeks back.
---
Dinosaur is missing a few scars, being eves most battle-hardened alliance and all
---
\&gt;.&gt;
---
Thats...  sad...
---
Hopefully Trig invasion will preoccupy cap fleets and encourage more small gang, sub cap content.
---
I'm flabbergasted that you guys have any problems with cyno jammers at all tbh they are extremely easy to kill and you can prevent new ones from onlining simply by shooting it with a cepter to give it a repair timer.
---
Looks like the finest quality.
---
Didn't we pass that over to high sec a while back?
---
yes but what if you just want to shoot NPCs all day and not care about anything tho m8
---
Could use a smiling, buzzing bee.
---
Lmao, not to be a typical salty ex tapi dude but Jesus Christ. 
---
Test and it’s ability to hold rhetoric from top to bottom and have the current player base repeat anything the top says and hold it as gold is incredible.
---
Think about this, y’all are effectively blue to the same alliance we used to meme on and laugh at for ruining serenity. And here you guys are giving them space to bot and mine in, all so that the economical powerhouse can keep going. 
---
Test culture is dead, krabs and isk rule test with a iron fist now, anyone that opposes it gets the boot. Anyone that asks questions to leadership about how something like this would be a good idea for the game, gets the boot, 
---
I really hope Test gets its shit together and stops this turtle up strat.
---
Yeah I get those people, it's the ones who enjoy PVP I don't get. I know loads of them hanging around in pretty much every coalition.
---
I've worked with on a legacy system work as much technical debt as eve. It *can* be fixed, it just won't be.

Then go be a renter because you functionally are one but you're afraid of being called one.

Yea you just have to go pick it up in catch right?
---
Lots of angry Chinese players in the comments section down below. I guess the OP is racist like me now. \\o/  
---
I pointed out the influx of people botting with the "coincidental" arrival of Chinese players to the server a few days ago.
---
Your math is wrong. The formula you wrote rates older alliances with fewer bans as the highest.
---
The Rorqual is a fair and balanced ship
---
Ok on second thought its not a well thought-through chart
---
 [https://sov.space/](https://sov.space/)
---
Honestly no. I think you’d have people getting evicted but refusing to engage their supers. Goons would leave and go shoot someone else and they’d retake the space without goons actively defending. I also doubt goons want to evict everyone. They’d keep nullsec as a natural game reserve where they go farm people for fun ever so often.
---
Perimeter has quieted down since the major blocs agreed to form a "mega mafia" to control the local markets. But in the run-up to the agreement, there were some surprisingly decent and fun battles.
---
Even the 4-4 undock camps were sometimes fun when another small group of war targets would come around to try and evict us. 
---
It was a good change of pace from the typical nullsec fights. Definitely miss it.
---
by fixed, you mean rebuilt from the ground up and replaced because that's less hassle than untangling the spaghetti ball of code that is killmails? like they did with poses.
---
That’s still a super recent development. Frat went from a joke to a bloc player in about a year. 
---
PIBC announced coming to serenity about a month ago... so we will see.
---
This is fine
---
Try the no stupid questions thread, or the sovmap linked below. (They're not directly allied with any of the groups you mentioned.)
---
Because you buy them from TEST
---
Every time I go to delve I end up stirring up all their ratting titans into gate camping me on every damn gate as I flee for my life.
---
ELI5 Sort Dragon?
---
It is very hard to get a good gang vs gang fight in high sec. The same +1 issue is there and generally it only happens if an FC screws up as most are pretty risk adverse. All hail the gnomes!
---
Very nice touch.
---
Cute mango
---
I thought gigX was back
---
How can it have more than one center?? A circle only has one center right?
---
but they try REALLY hard :(
---
Yeah you either kill a solo cruiser in a 10 man gang.
---
Or god forbid we come with a fleet and IF you decide to form you need 2:1 to undock and that’s after waiting an hour for you to form.
---
Now if you are part of HTP,WAFFLES,NSH(?),PHEW I’m sure it’s great content but otherwise no
---
You're assuming those players stick around on TQ for long enough to get to that point. Can you imagine if Horde had moved to Branch instead of Pure Blind? Or if Brave had moved to Period Basis? They never would've been able to retain player's interests. Eve null PvE is objectively boring. I truly feel sorry for these players.
---
No they don't. Go look at Co2 losing Tribute to NC/PL and Test held Vale. They gave up Vale without a shot being fired. Didn't even bother to fight. So them trying hard is adorable. 😂
---
I am no longer in PL so I have a semi-unbiased view here. I think TEST could stand on its own 2 feet against those forces and probably win.
---
I think TEST and specifically TEST leadership doesn't want to though, because it would be potentially hard for them as they are largely incompetent and exceedingly risk averse. My guess is that in a war you'd see TEST lose a few adm's to elite pvpers for a few weeks, but then panfam would make a mistake and bring out their armour titan/super fleet to a timer and would promptly get stomped on by TEST's shield super/titan fleet (TEST has a huge advantage here). TEST would probably lose 20-30 or so titans, panfam around 50-80 and panfam would promptly fuck off back North leaving FRT space largely free for the taking, which would take a month or two of grinding. Although it's worth pointing out that TEST doesn't actually need the FRT space for its ratters, as it largely has everything that it requires in Esoteria now that scarcity is no longer a thing. It would be nice for renters though and as strategic depth. This timeline would probably take 3-4 months.
---
The alternative is to call GOONS in, blueballs panfam, grind out anything resembling a forward-operating base, and go back to ratting/mining/jump-cloning to next week's version of PGL's poorly thought-out, unorganized deployments. This would probably take 1-2 weeks.

It takes 30 mins to reinforce at damage cap, good luck doing that in an intie

I have no problems with adding all those wonderful Chinese players to our server.

Just ask them to leave their bots behind when they come over would you?!
---
That's a good one.
---
Then go back to lowsec.
---
Underrated comment, this.
---
ROC &gt; PRC
---
If the playerbase was like you the null game would actually be fun.
---
It's not a circle though
---
Not a bad try for a gwailo, but the Chineses have been seeing similar things with better content, grammar, and formatting continuously for the past two decades.
---
In a way you've answered your own question.
---
1. I applaud this comment, its something truly debatable and well thought instead of “ughhh TEST giv me no kills, you retarded”
---
2. I pretty much agree
---
Oh, hey, it's Probotlegend.

They can see your hangar, but they cant do anything with it

Progod was wheeling and dealing and looking for the perfect time to stab CO2 in the back for months.

Didn't someone do this maths like 5-6 years ago and figure it was Amamake?
---
This isn't a circle, this is a network. And networks have centres.
---
Just blew up server from mega coalition... Any mega coalitions recruiting?
---
I think this is what you mean but that actually makes the price fall even more crazy. Plex price increases by about 7x and titan prices drop by 3x.
---
the definition of 'center' for a graph is as follows: the node (or set of nodes) with minimum eccentricity, with the eccentricity of a node defined as the longest shortest path from a node to another node in the graph.
---
so if two nodes both can reach every other node in 10 jumps and no others can  (and no node can reach every other node in less than 10 jumps) they are  both 'centers' of the graph
---
SHINY AND CHROME
---
Buy 20 frigs and start undocking
---
I doubt this is incorrect as it agrees with the source from ages ago on both radius and (one of) the centers. So maybe Amamake was using a different definition of 'center'
---
I see, thanks
---
It's looking like a high sec only incursion with only one constellation active at a time. So doubt it.

Yugoslavia was a great country. You could easy find a job,the crime rate was low and the people have been happier. Yugoslavia had also a great army that has been one of the strongest in Europe. Also different types of sports were extremely developed. We won FIBA Basketball World Cup 5 times. Serbo-Croatian was same identity of Serbs and Croats. We're 77% population of Yugoslavia.  Our language different is smaller than Mandarin Chinese and Min Chinese.  Serbs and Croats started genocide each other during Yugoslav War.

In my opinion, China solve many problem that we can't solve. If China were prepared to defend globalization against the seeming threats of protectionism and isolationism emerging in much of Europe and the United States, the rest of the world, or at least most of the nations of APEC, were prepared to stand behind it. And, if there had been any doubts concerning Xi’s commitment, they were allayed two months later when Xi became the first Chinese president to travel to the epicenter of globalization, the World Economic Forum’s annual January gathering in Davos, Switzerland, and deliver yet another rousing defense of globalization.
---
In several respects, China is already a leading pillar of the globalized world. It is the largest trading power in the world; tens of millions of Chinese travel abroad annually; and of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, it deploys the largest number of peacekeeping troops in the world. Throughout the 2000s, China also became one of the world’s top recipients of FDI, welcomed foreign universities and NGOs to assist in the country’s development,and sent as many as half a million students to study abroad everyyear. China’s military is also expanding its domain: it has established its first logistics base in Africa, enabling its military, for the first time, to boast a global presence, and Beijing is developing ports in strategic regions that serve not only commercial but also security interests. In addition, Xi Jinping’s initiatives, such as BRI, the FTAAP, and the AIIB extend well-beyond the Asia-Pacific region and establish China as a creator of new institutions that promote a more globalized and integrated world through lower tariff barriers for trade and greater ease of investment. The current Chinese leadership has also assumed a greater role in organizations such as the IMF and hosted the G20, the annual conclave of twenty of the most important economies in the world.  
---
Globalization implies the free flow of information, capital, and people, which, in turn, contributes to an increasingly interdependent and integrated world. The China that has emerged under Xi Jinping, however, is ambitious to lead but embraces globalization insofar as it controls the flow of ideas, as well as human and financial capital. While this rejection of an open market for ideas and capital brings with it inefficiencies and waste, these are costs that the Chinese leadership is willing to bear to realize a longer-term strategic vision.

May your country better.

&gt;I realized that Minmatar ships can't dock at Gallente stations, and vice versa.
---
that's not true.

in stations, create a contract from one character to another.

in citadels, just right click and 'deliver to'.

New killmails were promised a long long time ago and nothing has come of them yet, as you can see [here](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/blob/master/new_killmails/770fa307-c769-46d6-bf80-21985ecab5a0.json) there are example data which includes the specific item ids that was activated by each character on the killmail
---
While this would allow sites to see how many shots you fired, how much capacitor your siphoned and if you repped the guy it's all there which is dope, with the addition of the item ID you can grab the dogma attributes (read stats) of the item which would give you the exact abysall stats including it's original item IIRC
---
but when this comes out is up to CCP we shall see
---
It's not going to, the side with the numbers advantage will get the structure time while the other side doesn't undock.
---
You're looking for contracts. With Alpha status, you can create 1 without needing extra skills. Select the items you want to transfer, then right-click and Create Contract. Set it to private, and fill in the name of your other character. If all your stuff is in one place, you can do it in one go. Otherwise you need to repeat for each location with items. Log off, log in to your other toon, and open the Contracts window (you'll find it in the menu) and you'll see that there is a contract assigned to you.
---
You can dock at any NPC station at any time even if you were say part of the war against that faction. And the Gallente and Minmatar are allies anyway.
---
Just select all the items and chose create contract. Set it to private contract and put the other character's name into the box. When you create the contract log into the other character you will get a notification you have a contract and when you accept it you will get all the items from the other char.
---
We have a patch on the side.

It’s utterly crazy and i love for that guess some of it is the potential for loss

The word 'center' here is being used strictly in a graph theory manner. I explain what that means in another comment in this thread.

Hey man, I've seen things on Reddit and heard Anveri's side of the story, from what I can see mistakes were made, but the failure wasn't only on his part. I'd like to hear more though.

Yep, also the same group that murdered one of your titans infront of your entire coalition while you watched from our hic bubbles on your undock.

I know that, i just want to test some stuff, and i noticed i could get plex and omega so i can test some things before i go in blind, the problem here is, i activated omega and later realized that i couldn't use the daily alpha injectors because i was omega, so i kind of wanted to remove it so i can train stuff even faster, or... i could just make a new character and test it there, problem might be the money at first LOL

"If it seems to good to be true, it probably is." Will need to be your motto until you learn to recognize scams and traps.

Sorry if this comes across sarcastic, but I’m new to this game and I’m legit curious. What is your Corp/alliance doing differently than these other groups?  I’d like to join a group that’s trying to fix these “problems” rather than contribute to the problem.

vOv you asked, I answered.

Amount of mining I think. More dudes mining = more ore price competition = lower prices = lower mineral costs = cheaper titans

I love this comment, man. You learned something, and voluntarily took ownership.

So if you wanna do some small gang or solo stuff you could try out wormholes, idk how much you know about them, but wormhole mechanics make for small pvp oriented tight knit groups, and the pve is more than enough to support being bad at pvp. the time investment may be a little more than you want, though plenty of corps are pretty chill about that. If you don’t want the wormhole life you can try lowsec faction warfare, either solo or in a fw Corp, fw is a little messed up at the moment, but it’s possible to get good fights still. You could fund that with missions or incursions in highsec, or abyssal sites, which are new instanced pve done in cruisers/frigates with friends. If you wanna try out some cool ships, the new triglavian lineup is really well suited for smallgang/solo, there’s a new trig HAC and assfrig, which’ll Be interesting and probably fun.

You're surprised about a lot of things, go ask vince or PIBC themselves.
---
Capitals are everywhere yes. But the cyno mechanic is what gives them power. Make cyno an anchorable module that takes 1 min to anchor and its going to be very different.
---
You kill few caps /week while production goes into hundreds.
---
no, people who cry so hard in intel channels at people doing alliance logistics during a strat op, ultimately getting themselves killed because they weren't paying attention, get the boot.

Just curious, did you use disjoint set to find the shortest distance?

Sorry you guys betrayed Co2 and stopped supporting FCON. Bluing up XIX was just another way to prevent content in the South for the sake of "safety".

And what's your evidence for this?

Yeah, Steve is Fuzzwork. The dumps are basically the SDE in more usable formats.

Says someone who more than likely has spies in every alliance and then acts like it is morally acceptable. I cant claim to be Minerva here and I can deny it.
---
chase the farmer out and go in with a stabbed active tank maller with rat specific tank and just wait until rats are ontop of you then warp out (rats only apply 1 point or at least FW rats do) 
---
when the jackdaw farmer lands inside after coming back (they always do the greedy krabs) he will get pointed by the rats almost always cuz "lol its just rats " but the seconds he needs to get rid of the rat is usually enough to come back in something to get point yourself and kill them
---
you can actually make isk with that since most of the jackdaws are active tanked with bling boosters and MWDs
---
Welcome to what is known as flair bait on reddit since reddit does not require you to use the flair of your corporation. If it had some way to enforce it you would see the real corporation for everyone which by far would be much different for many people than what they have as flair.
---
You can blame it on the bots
---
Join #hoboleaks on tweetfleet it was put together there. It's a combination of leaked files (such as the LP and isk payouts), first hand descriptions from when it was live for two hours and conjecture. Things like channel ID distribution for the incursions were also looked at.
---
Because there would be shiit posts everywere over how they am making mining make more isk. 
---
l spent a long time getting into my frist rorq and l would be happy if ccp would give us implants but its a very long shot
---
Yea nah, co2 betrayed us.  They sided with tri against xix while the majority of test was staged in xix space for a content deployment.  their actions could have cost us dearly in an attempt to get home.
---
It was every other legacy alliance in agreement, and co2 taking actions against the consensus of every other member alliance.
---
Like gigx said, I'm doing this even if it costs me my alliance.  Those are the words of a man taking an action without regard for circumstances or others.  In the end his disregard for everyone else, well it cost him his alliance.
---
I know none of this will assuage your years old test hateboner, but as usual, your view of events is obstructed by your own colon.
---
So a one time thing changes the fact that you can’t do shit to a coalition that forms 100 ppl after an hour formup.

Also you heard our comms then? He was laughing about it.

He got srp’ed so it was all fun

ace!

Just because you cant figure out how to drop a procurer fleet on a moon doesnt mean they are shit tier content. Moons are better tier content than shooting a pos which barely can figure out how to target anything because of really shitty programming.

"Making progress" in your mind means taking sov doesn't it?
---
:)
---
But actually, i'm not certain what you think we'd be trying to accomplish in provi.  Most of the of the content is just for amusement, there is no overarching objective to do anything other than farm them, which we do pretty consistently. Everyone needs to eat and I live on squashed hopes and dreams of roleplayers.
---
because a lot of goons never read the forums and even more aren't interested in pvp, so they need to hype all their crabs to make their quantity over quality doctrine work ;-) 
---
ok and to be fair, there are several goons that got a lot of talent when it comes to these kinds of art, I think it is one of the fascinating things in eve that parts of the gameplay happen out of the actual game
---
In some area's of space 100 ppl is considered a lot of dudes.
---
Hang out in the EVE-Scout in-game channel for sure.
---
Tornado warning in Gaston and Mecklenberg counties, hope everyone is safe.
---
because you can get 3 pap links without joining the war, absurdly easily.

hell, at war it's even easier to do it than during peace time - even if you don't deploy.

nobody gives a fuck - they hand out paps like candy. the minimum requirements are a bar lower than most guy's standards on a friday night after a copious amount of alcohol and a lack of self respect.

a $100k battle would of been 6-7 titans getting killed circa 2007.

You got the boot for being an entitled asshole though.

Every dictor pilot after the FC says the famous words. ''DICTORS COMMIT, COMMIT, COMMIT!''

A ban today is worth more than a ban tomorrow. A ban today is somehow also worth more than a ban yesterday. Ban everyone today to achieve maximum gains?
---
&gt;Well, there's a battlefield that hasn't been touched by caps yet and it's high-sec.

---
Can’t lose if everything is blue right?
---
I think they just fucked up lol
---
literally just read up on your alliance´s history and the place it originated from. There should be some history threads on your forum or some shit
---
Who is slice and what happened to them?
---
$200 would get you a super. Titans are about $400-500.
---
Forced to attend?? My friend, you can accidentally get enough paps these days. No one is "forced" to do anything.
---
You do realize that every noteworthy nullsec alliance that has survived the test of time has some way that they monitor activity. We use pap links because we could care less about kb's. Other alliances use killboard activity. 
---
If you don't track activity when the shit hits the fan and no one logs in because you had no idea half your alliance was afk who is to blame?
---
How's harrassing suicial people going for you? You insufferable twat.
---
Do mangos turn pruple? I thought they were orange...
---
A great summary of the situation :D
---
So all your saying is we need error bars? ;-)
---
I love how a whole region of pilots can’t deal with a single small alliance. Qfc is a joke.
---
&gt; why does goonswarm have propaganda
---
It is fun to make and read even if you are not in goonswarm. Plus one toon in a ewar ship when all their other toons are mining is not that helpful. They, like all alliancies, want close to 100% commitment for a cople of hours durring start-ops.
---
I'm sorry, I can't be arsed to read all of PDL's 2nd grade blathering. Is the promised apology for the constant racist remarks anywhere in this bloated post of his?
---
Nice retort
---
p much. Ty for your content btw sometimes man
---
There are several types. The orange ones are smaller and sweeter. Plus they are seasonal.
---
Then there are the bigger ones which are green with a dark reddish side.
---
Further updates to come... (like we took the sov back from goons themselves)
---
Yes, also published some footage from when I was in CVA while I was in Init. I also have some footage from the LAST time I was in CVA, that I will likely publish.
---
MFW you think everyone not legacy or imperium is gonna work against imperial legacy.
---
I agree with your POV there. I agree that its probably in poor taste. Only eve politics should be in eve :)
---
Because threatening your members based on pap links doesn't create a good culture and we want our members to actually be happy lmao
---
no one cares, it's 3 paps, who gives a fuck. you can literally get 3 paps by accident
---
Dino also cute tbh.
---
have you seen this magnificant dude in this marvelous alliance, something called "... fuerchtenix". dont know him, but he seems to be the magnificent one man army, everyone is talking about.
---
would love to meet him once.
---
I heard he does kickass gnosis fleets
---
I'm in Hoboleaks and ARC and yes while it was triggered live for two hours on Sisi, that doesn't mean there's only one and it's highsec only.
---
The capital shipyard in the abyss appears in multiple systems showing concurrent construction progress of multiple ships so the Triglavians do have more than one. 
---
The Invasion was triggered by the Devs to test it out but only briefly, the whole system itself wasn't turned On so to speak but only what they wanted and shut off immediately after. 
---
Most of this seems to be adapted from Incursion mechanics and there's nothing to say that like Incursions, Invasions wont have multiple High, Low, and Null simultaneous Invasions.
---
Next week...
---
Rooks n Kings join Test
---
Blue jammers are more stifling tbh.
---
For real like, we exist for our line members, and we afford them a lot of freedoms and rights.  We don't want them to be unhappy and we don't want to threaten our people with dumb stuff.  People play Eve for fun (for some reason idk) and they want to go on fleets, join wars, etc. because that's the fun shit - Rorqual mining sure isn't.  So rather than threatening people to get PAPs, we invite them to join some stuff.
---
If your coalition/alliance/corporation is threatening you with PAP compliance to make you fleet up, you should probably consider joining a better corporation.  Make your fleets fun and take care of your people.

How are wormholes irrelevant? are they irrelevant because they aren't nullsec?

How are you dealing with the recent nerfs? :D

To be fair, 3 paps per quarter is just the improved version of 1 pap per month. It gives people some room for times where they're inactive for a couple of weeks (examns, vacation, busy work schedule etc.).

  Do something about it then, invade us, kick us out of nullsec- Apparently we're terrible, so now's your chance.
---
Not mad 70% null coming down on us, looking forward to it infact. Let's fight it out and close this chapter so that we can all go onwards to some new overarching narrative. This storyline is kinda getting bit stale tbh.
---
Sad that Sort is gonna squirm out of the long overdue comeuppance for a while longer.
---
Okay I laughed at the propaganda video, and overall nice job fragging these nerds out of sov.
---
Yeah, sorry if true. I don't come here often and just assume everyone is a wise ass.
---
I’m not surprised that you have no source and just assume the north asked PIBC to join them.
---
So how were you kicked from TEST then?
---
am i tho

You do realize none of the BRs posted includes LAWN right. BTW we miss you guys in Kor Azor, you used to poke us every now and then.

Thermo 5 is definitely worth, but unless you're overheating everything regularly, I wouldn't make it a priority skill to train.

Sounds like we'll be easy to defeat then. When's the mighty coalition coming to kick us out of null?
---
I've been doing Incursions with TDF, other than that i've started to do stuff with shoot first in lowsec. It's a good balance i can make good isk from the incursions and get security status that i can then spend in low pew pewing. I'm just starting to get back into the pew pew again though.
---
Awesome, I feel dumb for not just right clicking and checking myself, thanks for the info.
---
They sided against FCON which then joined the DRF for protection and got the boot over shooting Solar structures in their own space which were agreed to be removed in the first place. But you spineless lizards prefered taking the bot isk XiX shoved up your ass instead of supporting your own coalition members..... a real Sort thing to do.

Oh boy, you are in for a treat. I'd imagine EVE has some of the most accessible data of just about any game through their EVE [esi](https://esi.evetech.net/latest/?datasource=tranquility#!/). One of the CSM members, [u/FuzzMiester](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuzzmiester) has done a lot of work surrounding it since (at least for me) time immemorial.
---
What's a good ship to kill the VNI hunting ships that I see roaming?
---
As I recall, they weren't c02 systems / towers at all - gigx just decided he wanted them, renegeing on a prior agreement.

Yes to your question

Irony detected

That along with generally being an asshole to everyone who's not  CJ, he was on his last of many, many chances and chose to continue being his usual asshole self to people with the power to give him the boot.
---
super fun if u want to try the solo/ small gang/ lowsec playstyle
---
I think i remember that pasta
---
I agree with more differences in space, that would make it more interesting but overall everything needs to be reduced in null.  
---
Lets take Delve as an example, it is approaching the cap of resource collection and that cap is insane, if resource gen was about 1/3rd of what it is currently then the following things might happen:
---
A) Goons could expand east into "hostile" territory causing a war with Test
---
B) Goons claim fountain renter space from init/bastion potentially causing strains between those groups
---
C) Members leave annoyed with overcrowding of resources, or infighting over who gets to use "better" space if areas get split by corp/alliance for example.
---
Yeah sure this is all based on miner/ratter drama but that can lead to internal or external conflicts.  Incentives on the other hand probably wouldn't cause goons to move or these conflicts.
---
Citation needed.
---
Go ask.
---
That's actually really easy, thanks.
---
#tackly4exec

Because 90% of goons are krabs that would never join a fleet if not forced or getting massive massive hyped.

How many blues does FRAT have? How many bluetruals does GOTG have? Then you have Provi with "only shoot people who are red". I have nothing to do with anything remotely related to leadership whatsoever- But it's hilarious that so many people buttmad about TEST dropping Kids with guns- But gaining a proper temp blue instead- while also having their own delicate list of diplomatic agreements for groups right next door. PANFAM have been buddy buddies to GOTG for years now- Likewise whoever lives next to GOTG they desperately ally up to them as fast as possible. FRAT (who could seriously do real damage right now) call out to PL/NC the moment things get hard. 
---
  At this moment, it's Legacy, XIX, and Mango. Legacy without TEST isn't even that large. Goons? We're neutral- yes yes something about NIP- But that doesn't stop goons from rolling around eso every day with hunters alongside every other hunting group from WH space and Stain + FRAT.
---
  I'm not disputing what's taken place- But it's painfully ironic given that the OTHER HALF OF EVE do the same thing, yet they're mad. (inb4 BUT 90,000 PEOPLE!)
---
  I recall TEST did the same thing with FRAT- Allied with them when they were new to TQ, then they became enemies since. Might get a repeat after they've outgrown their tank.
---
  Finally- "other side of eve" need to learn how to get more members frankly. Why don't people flock to GOTG? Or PL/NC?
---
Can it track multiple accounts? Does it keep statistics? Can you set destination from right clicking the K-space? Can you keep track of multiple chains? and does it save the wormhole sigs so if you or someone else rolls into it  will already be populated with old sigs from a few days ago? Lastly can you do a bulk add &amp; delete nonexistant signatures like siggy can? I really dont mind paying for siggy. Or something better. I really liked siggy.
---
Ah yes, but apparently it's "TAPI's fault". Funny how the bitter exes are so keen to buttmad themselves all over the sub whenever the topic comes up.
---
Well.. A lot of EVE Players only play to mine salt from others.. And for these players, its much more satisfying to actually see the reaction of the guys they kill/gank -&gt; even if u dont share intel, the effort to track you down isnt too big for them, if u get mad(or so) on stream after..
---
Preemptive f
---
Oh is that the narrative now after noone bought the one that no such an agreement didn't exist in the first place? Sorry i'm not actively following the "Test is a poor victim" narrative adjustments.
---
There are two ways to do this:
---
1)  first pilot private contracts whatever stuff you want to transfer to the second pilot (private contract can be limited to just one pilot, and done at zero cost to the receiver) in an NPC station that both can access (most of them, if you've been a good boy).  Second pilot goes there, accepts the contract, takes the goods wherever.  This costs 10,000 isk for one transaction.  You can transfer as much stuff as you like in a single transaction for the most part (there is a 999 stack limit, but you should probably not have that many different types of items anyhow).
---
2)  first pilot moves the goods to a player owned station that both have access to.  He "Delivers" the items to the second player.  Second player goes to the station, looks in his delivery bay, retrieves items and does whatever with them.  This way is free, so woot, you're up 10,000 isk.
---
A bait VNI. 
---
Full rack of neuts in the highs, scram/web/ab in mids, and damage/armor tank in lows. 
---
You can even get some t3c’s with a good fit, although that relies on them being bad pilots, as a decent Loki will web you up at 20+ km and keep you from ever getting tackle

I only see it when I see goon members asking for a ban on something like doxxing and I consider that a fair point. While it happened ages ago it was never addressed properly, and it probably never will be. Until it does I consider it a valid response.
---
There probably still isn't a rule against "telling people to get someone to kill themselves at fanfest during your panel". There likely won't ever be, most people have the tact and decency to not do that sort of thing :|
---
We ain't talking about Frat. We talking about Test. Being a follower because everyone else has 5000 blues isn't trend setting nor is it helping the stagnant gameplay and so movement. I don't play anymore. My last stop was Test. Making giant coalitions isn't healthy for Eve. If it was the Chinese would still be on Serenity.

Yes to multiple accounts. For us it shows everyone in Corp, what ship their in, and the name of their ship in each system.
---
Not sure of the statistics it keeps. I don’t use that for anything so not sure what all it does.
---
No, to set destination as far as I know. You can set which systems you want to show jump distances to, and if you click a k-space it will show how many jumps away safer or shorter.
---
Multiple chains yes. Just add tabs on the top.
---
And yes to saving wormhole sigs. As we’re scanning it shows the stuff from the last time we rolled into that hole. So we usually start out by deleting the old stuff and copy pasting in all the new anoms and sigs.
---
Yes to bulk add and delete. You can just copy paste from scanning window. Then mass delete there’s checkboxes by them on the mapper and a select all option then hit delete.
---

&gt;My guess is that in a war you'd see TEST lose a few adm's to elite pvpers for a few weeks, but then panfam would make a mistake and bring out their armour titan/super fleet to a timer and would promptly get stomped on by TEST's shield super/titan fleet (TEST has a huge advantage here). TEST would probably lose 20-30 or so titans, panfam around 50-80 and panfam would promptly fuck off back North leaving FRT space largely free for the taking, which would take a month or two of grinding. 
---
This is pretty close to how it went last summer, except the curbstomp was cut short with the server crash. NC/PL fled, Tri folded, Frat had their shit pushed in so hard they paid TEST to stop.
---
It's even harder when most of their fleet ops are unsuccessful
---
I haven’t used Vippy for a long time, but back when I did it’s UI was absolutely atrocious especially in comparison with Tripwire. Tripwire will automatically organize a chain for you as you scan, where Vippy needed complete reorganization every time a chain changed. Unless their UI has changed significantly I would say that the time spent manually organizing the visual layout of your chain is not worth using. 
---
Also... 10m per month is like... one C2 site. Are you a wormholer or a poor? #nopoors
---
War deccing so the null blocks can fight over citadel trade hubs. Trade taxing in perimeter is super lucrative, because even like a couple tenths of a percent can be worth billions. There was even a period where test and brave has stratops in hisec, I remember having to gate halfway across hisec to get a clone installed in jita.
---
So you don't like large coalitions due to stagnant gameplay but want to wipe out smaller groups in their inception?
---
Dunno, I may have recalled wrong. I don't really get all emotionally invested in spaceship politics, I just like shooting stuff and having a good group of friends to fly with. All the space opera larping and pearl clutching isn't really my bag.
---
Yeah I'll ask my capital pilots to help
---
Why even bother shooting caps/ Nightmare with a solo Moros? You cant kill them. The only way  to do damage to them is to shoot their heavy fighters then light fighters

that might be cool

But isn't that what makes the game so unique?

So you don't? I mean I hang with the guy about every day or so on comms shooting the shit along with a bunch of other line members, he's pretty transparent about his opinions and the state of TEST at a given moment.

Idk fam. Maybe it is just me.

I feel yah, intel shit is for intel but seeing the intel channel light up while everyone was doing shit for the alliance just kinda made me aggravated.
---
And maybe we should have had that discussion somewhere else, but it didn't occur like that, do I apologize for disrupting something if there was actually something viable for the alliance occurring? Absolutely do. If the alliance was using the intel channel at that moment for anchoring a citadel or something or scoping out areas to use as fuel stagings or some shit, I'm sorry.

However, I know this wasn't the case as the people that diplo'd up where all no leadership roles. All folks that where just salty that their test intel website pinged them while their 10 rorqs where cycling making them actually check to see whats up.

I think I saw the lawn dudes shooting that fortizar that was transferred to us. We had some friendly smack talk back and forth and mutually agreed the turncoat was quite a special guy. Felt like a romantic missed connection; would love to see you guys around again xoxo

Not to mention the time progod was Facing while on SoK during the Halloween War, or when all the FCs were in during 6VDT.
---
I miss SoK and Kugu, r/eve just never felt the same to me.

You try harder to be relevant then just about anyone else on this subreddit.

It’s insane I’ve seen it before. But just last week I warp into our trade hub and no one had told me this was an opportunity to pull the avatar 😂

Or they just didn't take inactivity into account when looking at the numbers.

As long as you guys don’t bring fucking typhoons I think it’ll be fun.

Nanite interfacing and Nanite operation are the two. Thermodynamics V is absolutely worth it but it really adds up when using T3’s, destroyers or cruisers. There’s a bonus reduction to heat damage taken, allowing things like Overheating the Abyssal 50MN on my proteus for a minute and a half

---
The fact that one of the rich goons in the game got banned recently makes your narrative look pretty dumb.
---
The best Eve has to offer is J-space, the true home of proper supcap brawls and small gang pvp.
---
I never said it was TAPI's fault fam. I own up to being a disruptive asshole to the alliance's day to day operations, as the day to day operations where not aligning with alot of the original values that made me want to join test. And before you go "hur dur entitlement", it may be some of that, as I spent well over 4-5 years of my life playing this game with the Test banner, through the highest highs and the deepest lows, and I'm honestly scared at what Test is becoming now, its trying to do the Goons 2.0 thing and y'all don't have the internal culture/drive that Goons do so I don't know what can come of that, only time will tell I guess, all I know is that time after time people are fattening up, getting rich, buying titans, and ????, because actions like this are taking away the "do shit with those titans" part of the game. Feroxes and eagles (when we're feeling extra wild) is the game now, and it's ruined null bloc warfare for me, with actions and general ideology like this occurring it'll only keep driving this game into the ground unless CCP do something wild with the game. 
---
I was hoping the new trig shit was going to lead into space revolts or sov loss, but alas it just looks like another form of incursions so idk.
---
Anywho, yes, it's not TAPI's fault that I was kicked, it was indeed my own fam.
---
the internet as a whole has become soft and Test itself shows that to an extreme.
---
They may not appear on the list, but their pets put in a good showing.
---
wasn't there a thing about the goon renters getting banned only a few days ago?

WTF, feelsbadman

The system you are referring to in feyth is R97-CI.  It was never co2s, nor was it supposed to be co2s, rather because it had a couple good moons gigx got all grabby over that system.  But no, it wasn't supposed to be co2s, and when they started shooting structures they had no right to shoot in there it caused an incident.

If you genuinely don't like where you're at, leave and go do something you enjoy. The game is a sandbox, go do what you find fun.

You can never get your money back therefore you can never leave. Mwahah!

Well that's true enough but I was more wondering whether I should bother with any other nullsec corporation or join a lowsec group instead.

What a load of shit.

yeah but whyd you put the money in

Gallente Federation is a group. Gurista's Pirates are a group.

It's a Gurista's Pirates ship.

yeah i saw it, would be interesting to see it split over time.. NA hasn't been active for years, so those 6% should, tho i can't check or prove it, have happen many years ago
---
whattheactualfuck
---
I’m in legacy and between The WH roams into impass/esi/feyth/catch, strat and social ops called 2-3 daily, active hot war in Immensea and detorid...  plenty of content to be had to someone willing to look and make an effort.  
---
You’re either too lazy or this is a troll post meant to drag on test for being blue to “all of eve”.  Literally goons and imperium were bombed last week by test.  Are they blue?  No.  
---
Just a whiner.
---
Where the hell were you when I drew this?!! :mind blown:
---
I think the over time one would be a much better reflection of current times because you have to imagine the large majority of those russian bans were back in the days of them living in the drone regions and running their renters out there. And it would be interesting to see an actual number of total bots banned instead of just a percentage graph, because then you can assign actual numbers of people banned to certain groups.
---
yeah exactly, i'm p sure at least the 6% from NA is p old seeing as that group has been dead for so long, but i can't know with out the over time info.. so let's hope ccp gives us some more info to bring clarity in the issue
---

---
Always overheat everything, every time. Even with thermo 1.
---
It shows that the game is in a bad state when I read your title and think about skill injectors before cap injectors...
---
Most nullsec is like that.
---
There are nullsec corps that are very pvp active, but they are harder and harder to find these days.
---
Look around a bit on zkill. Maybe you can find  some very active pvp corps on it. 
---
If you want some roaming and getting shot, join some lowsec corps, npc null corps or wh corps. Those guys are always looking for a fight. Lowsec is gonna hurt your sec status, npc null is a hassle to live in and wh is, well, a bit different.
---
Can someone get on the fucking narrative here?
---
you've barely posted lately
---
not that this is a bad thing, don't strain yourself
---
infact, maybe keep it up
---
Different corporation, find one that actually does things and functions as a corp, sets objectives as a corp and works towards them. In my experience the best corps in the game aren't just an alliance ticker and have their own identity, similarly the worst corps are ones that exist as a shell for mining and ratting, often enough these two types can be part of the same mega bloc coalitions. Use https://zkillboard.com/ to see how PVP active corps are, who they are flying with and in what to make a decision on who you should join. With what you've said i'd recommend looking around NPC 0.0 areas for active corporations in your timezone.
---
Zulu fed a lot of that after kugu died.
---
I don’t care about your low life tbh
---
you are quite likely the dumbest fuck presently operating a keyboard btw
---
I do have a question for you. Why do you use some punctuation in some places but not others?
---
The Drone Regions were full of spineless renters and krabs building supercapitals or ratting in them. When the Drone Regions were being burned down, those locals firesaled their supercaps. Many of them either sold to spies or didn't really care who was buying. Either way, SkillU is widely believed to have gotten most of their supercapital fleet (or at least their nyxes) this way. 
---
Of course, it's entirely possible that's *not* what happened, or that a lot of nuance is missing; SkillU being the small, insular alliance that they are.
---
It was hilarious to see some of those cruisers just evaporate.
---
The tank was looking rough there for a minute.

You haven't auth to any of the groups have you. Legacy is currently at war and there 2-7 fleets up a day.
---
Are you just butthurt I mentioned TEST? I can't see any other reason why you'd be so presumptuous about my motivations. I glanced at your post history and it seems like all you do is carrier rat, so either your brain is so benumbed by that one activity that your standards for engaging content have hit rock bottom, or this is just you having a knee-jerk response to your favorite alliance being maligned - monkey see, monkey do, that kind of thing. Go fuck yourself.
---
Jita scammers found the subreddit. What kept you?
---
Literally said this like a few weeks ago
---
&gt; Our behavior of late is creating costly setbacks in our attempt to prosecute this war and, if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space and the execution of our famous contingency plan (which, all jokes aside, would actually drive corps to leave TEST and put us back where we were 6 years ago).

Hey nice I'll give it a shot, I have three of them now thanks to CCP
---
Pretty much everything the north is not doing.
---
Moving with the times is the biggest one, test/goons adapted to the meta instead of complaining about it and doing nothing, that's literally all the north has done since the changes YEARS ago now.
---
The north are still relying on a rental empire to fuel the dwindling machine, the south moved on from this years ago. the northern FC team's cannot work together effectively on even basic operations as they've stated many times in public, the south regularly works together and delegates responsibilities. They failed to do any planning at all to adapt to moon mining changes, other people planned in advance and are reaping the rewards. Certain groups have ego's that wont allow certain other groups to be 'under' other groups FC's they feel they are better than and should be in charge of and many more problems.
---
The bottom line is those at the top tables of the northern alliances are old, tired and out of ideas, they're still trying to play this game like it's 2008 and it shows in the complete lack of success.
---
Many of the active waffe guys also have spacejobs, not like you are freeloading
---
amazing argument 11/10, i imagine a fat bald guy living in his mommas basement. now, gtfo
---
Critical missing link - you assume Peligro is acting on players reports. 
---
He has to rely on non-player generated telemetry data as the rest is just hearsay. 
---
Unless you want to claim that Grr Goons have spethul-spethul bots, they should get caught in the dragnet at the same rates as other alliances, in proportion to the number of bots that are there.
---
Personally, I'm surprised Goons didn't show up there, but it'd be unfortunate if I let "grr goons" tint my shades.
---
This is a good tactical choice for Mango Alliance.
---
Yet we still live up north, which we took from the goons.

IIRC, The maths was done after X-47 last year Vs. B-R5, I don't remember the numbers Exactly, But it was roughly:
---
B-R had $300K destroyed in the fighting.
---
X-47 was barely scratching $50K destroyed, With barely even $300K actually on field.
---
Yet both were roughly about the same ISK value destroyed.
---
Thats how much its changed even in the last 5 years.
---
I think he's calling you out because you hit every single negative talking point people bring up about null, and you don't sound genuine at all. Furthermore your knee jerk sperging suggests that you are indeed just looking to shit on TEST or null in general.
---
The deal clearly was Solar would give up their Moons in Feyth, even publicly confirmed by Vily. No matter whether Dronewalkers or whoever would get them, the Solar towers had no business there anymore.
---
What is it ?
---
What's your ingame name?
---
That narrative is being rehashed quick eh
---
Clearly this guy hasn't heard of Chrome Remote Desktop
---
Nice job Lasker. Loved that one.

It could be that these talking points are rooted in the actual experiences of many players. Are you retarded or something?
---
all big blobs are shit mate
---
this is fucking awesome
---
I don't assume it.
---
I see bots in delve. Hunt them. Kill them. Then reconcile that fact with peligros data.
---
Test originated from Reddit and Reddit has also had numerous instances of Doxxing occurring - should we hold the members of test responsible for that?
---
Yeah it's impossible to be spontaneous when the biggest wig doesn't know who's who in EVE right.
---
So you think people will warp to random anomalies in nullsec till they find content while burning money on frigates that can't kill a basic ratting ship.
---
It's the reason you should have steel cardinal skin for flycatchers
---
QFC are blue to each other?!? Then whats the the point of still calling themselves that, idiots?
---
Remove yourselves of that region, slaves.

In unrelated news, TEST Alpha membership and ratting taxes skyrocket leaving scientists baffled.

If you keep joining different groups of a blue donut then why are you surprised that everyone around you is blue? Do you think people in PH have the same experience, or even people in lowsec groups?

Probably because it's a bit of fun and it's a game after all.

3 paps per 3 months is 1 pap per month

But it is true that every corp in GSF have different pap requirements. Some have 1, some have 5, I think a few even have 0, etc.

You live there because we allow it????????

There will be more Dead KEEPSTAR this time around. Sice GOTG blue the Imperium to save them self from the Goons.  So it will be Goons/Test/GOTG Super knocking down PAMFAM Keepstar most likely

---
&gt;So you think people will warp to random anomalies in nullsec
---
people do this
---
&gt;while burning money on frigates that can't kill a basic ratting ship.
---
what is: teamwork
---
you have a very naive understanding of nullsec my friend
---
we're not EVE's most battle-hardened alliance anymore, we've slumped a bit, need to get back to form.
---
Narrative control, yet another thing Headliner is bad at.
---
Are you still trying to work on a narrative where goons can't crush NCPL any time they want ? You know X47 Happen right ?

aar?

I give him credit for just rolling out, i like that style, but to fit the ships in right way and use right modules would just give him so much more :l

AAAH  A BEE RUUUUUUUUN
---
The only facts you have are 5% of permanently banned users in frat Treasury, 2% in KWG, and 2% in wings wanderers (who have since dispersed into primarily KWG and LBFB), so let's be honest, you have little reason to be acting high and mighty.
---
Flowing like the breeze
---
your stuff?
---
New player here. Why does an alliance leader have all the control to announce a war, and then delay it. Like once you say its war time, it is war till someone loses?
---
Is the SKIN actually on the server or is it just the icon? That's neat and all but I kinda wanna see what the actual SKIN looks like, not just the icon &amp; description lol
---
if someone comes at you in drakes you come back at them with drakes the fuck?
---
I like Pathfinder the most, but you need to host a private server (which is annoying to set up).
---
because that's precisely not even slightly what happened
---
Who?
---
why are you stealing u/xtra_squishy  content, unless he pussied out and made a new reddit account
---
PBUH
---
join a wormhole corp :) or hop in one of the handful of public discord servers that are around for wormholers or just everyday players (TIS, Praisebob...there are a few others).
---
Oh dawg if you’re in wormholes and want to talk to people just hit up local. 
---
There’s always someone watching. They sometimes talk.

Chori is so salt  
---
Much wow
---
Same, been meaning to find a use for them.
---
And slight edit, if have trouble fitting it just downgrade the extender or drop the probe launcher. :)
---
&gt;the State of the Goonion will be delayed by a week.
---
uh you do realise today was the announcement of the SOTG not a delay, right?
---
not a very good intel agency if you can't get basic shit like that right.
---
Ignore the angry, neckbearded bee who responded to you cuntily, it's their way.
---
The "announcement" didn't come from official channels. The planned invasion was leaked ahead of time by "spies," which caused the invasion to be delayed while they try to get their shit together.
---
The reason it can be delayed is because the enemy they plan to invade is quite far away and no real conflict will take place until pilots and ships are moved to the staging point in order for the conflict to begin.
---
Lol okay
---
911 help pls there's been an assault
---
what nerf ? just get a extra rorq that took care of the nerf and l mine more = l make more isk ;P
---
Not really stealing hes posting my youtube link

Spinmaster 9420 over here lmbo
---
I sadly had the misfortune of living in Querious over the last few years. I actually felt bad for Darwinism. I will explain.   
---
I was a member of the only PvP group in Querious. The rest were always blueing up with each other and did nothing to promote the idea of the "fight club". None of those other alliances could muster more than a few pilots for defense ops. All they did with their time was Rorq mine. Every time a new group would announce that they were joining the QFC all the krabs would offer them sov for isk and blue standings. Our group had to defend all those carebears for years until the mass majority of our member base just got tired of it and quit Eve Online.   
---
No one wanted to take over from our leader because we all knew it was because of his commitment and generosity that the QFC could even keep sov. We all knew that we would end up baby sitting the crabs. Most of us left the game. The few that stayed moved on. Our leader was so nice that he just handed over everything we owned to one of the renter corps. They gave nearly half of their systems to another alliance that were goon pets. The QFC is a joke and killed our alliance. 
---
Just imagine trying to find content when everyone around you is completely pvp adverse and wants to afk mine all day while you defend the sov they can't even be bothered to defend themselves.   
---
TLDR: For any carebear high sec afk mining alliances looking for easy sov. Just join the QFC. You too can be given entire constellations for doing nothing and someone else will defend said sov for you.   
---
I wish Darwinism the best of luck. o7
---
I like to see TEST is still doing well.
---
So with that example of running a 50MN for 90 seconds, does that mean that heat damage is completely consistent if you have all the same modules and module set-up when you started heating? 
---
Basically, I thought the heat damage had a factor of RNG to it that would sometimes cause damage and sometimes not, is that wrong? Can I expect to heat my entire rack of guns every time for the same length of time before they break, or is there some variance involved?
---
Amazing
---
What happened was pretty much
---
"War coming, prep up, more info next week when we hold SOTG"
---
Mate you are the worst. What was with that whole fake news about you getting jacket!?
---
The fake loss was literally the best prank I've seen in eve. Fuckin rolled an entire alliance.
---
🤔 so About 1000 plex?
---
I think I have a research agent in Evati. Used to be pretty empty down there.
---
but why should they?
---
What are you on about?
---
one day, they'll actually win a supercap slugfest
---
one day
---
They earned their by ruining server after server and game after game with their decisions to bot and gold farm, its not like this is something new.
---
its not like their former allies didn't try to evict them immediately following the previous goon invasion or anything...
---
It's almost like they are a nullsec alliance that goes to war regularly. Fuckin' weird, I know.
---
Attempts, he says. Look at this guy.
---
how is it different from normal ratting day in delve?
---
People don't kill people, hammers kill people
---
hes trying to take your karma
---
Would someone mind explaining what happened? Keep up the good work Squish.
---
K.
---
Pap link requirements don't require you to participate in particular operations, and you need people to fleet up a lot more often than once a month to have a good campaign in a war.
---
Thanks for the thorough reply dude! As a new player, who would you recommend joining? I’m ok with not being part of some major player mega Corp if I am able to start having a positive impact as a new player. I’ve already started a second account to try and build up capital skills (which seem to be a requirement for a lot of these groups). I just want to join a group that is adapting positively to the changes in the game.
---
Titans are build cost in INIT. and are covered by SRP with replacement hulls.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have deployed deep into a neutral regiom without talking it out with your allies? Oh i forgot, test doesnt have neutrals, its all bluetrals
---
I looted an expensive abyssal web, pretended to have died with it in my cargo... video starts
---
hahahaha no, that's not ready for war. That's just another day in 1DQ
---
I just recently started playing again but I love watching your videos. They inspired me to get back into it. Keep up the good work. Hope you are doing better these days.
---
Thanks man, sorry to hear you burned out due to that.

Seconding Signal Cartel.  And when you are done with those, join a small, fun WH corp.
---
It's not that even:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76673084/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76673084/)   
---
More like 150/50
---
Ahhh very nice were still unsure of what's going to happen in the comming weeks or where we shall go hopfully a new home with wicked content but also stable enough to rebuild the empire
---
It's the one subcap ship class I've never trained. I get that enough in a scimitar, thanks but nah.
---
Or it shows that botters in Goon space are better at not getting reported or caught by CCP.
---
Need a new web, mittens' muppets are getting ideas again
---
CCPlease chrome with black skin for the Sabre &lt;3
---
yoo thats really cool! i spent the first few years of my eve career next door to amamake, it used to be gate camped almost all day for years
---
we'll find out next weekend
---
Lol yer good point suprised we never got any comments about that
---
Booooooooooooooooooooo
---
We get removed from that pocket 3 times a year on average.
---
Yup.  Entirely.  Just banging down the usual shit on test list.  I’d like if someone could be a little more creative when they shit talk their own alliance.  We know this stuff already.
---
&gt;I'm honestly scared at what Test is becoming now, its trying to do the Goons 2.0 
---
  TIL it's bad to use your own space. Which is something PL and friends failed to do. Rent can't built titans.
---
Have you ever considered that veteran players who just pvp would not have unsubbed supers in lowsec from years back? Something they could resub and move when a need for them suddenly arises?
---
question mark?
---
More propaganda than reality.
---
Not any more, no.
---
K I’m the low life who’s pissed 400$ (or more) in a game he knew nothing about.  Riiiiiiiiiight.
---
"we're talking about test"
---
  Translated: ignore our allies, don't look at us- BUT TAPI
---
Killing PanFam never gets stale.
---
the heat damage you get is inconsistent, sometimes you'll get away with no damage applied, sometimes you'll burn through one third of the module hp. however, there seems to be a maximum possible heat damage for each cycle, so you can work out a life expectancy for your modules. with mwds for example, each cycle after the second is risking it, assuming no heat damage reduction (aka t3) as mentioned above. with constant overheating, the rng evens out, so when a module goes offline you know you've been heating it for at least some while.
---
one also needs to keep in mind the other factors in play- other, adjacent overheated modules can and eventually spread damage to each other. this works to the detriment of gun racks, but surprisingly they can be heated for some while, even on destroyers. utility high slots can be placed between guns to act as heat sinks, they need to be full and online though. a single gun going offline from heat damage will render the whole group inactive, so make sure you ungroup them to fire the remaining guns when that happens.
---
the other factor is the duration of overheating. with each cycle of a module the high/med/low slots start stacking up in heat status (keep track of this with the heat indicator between hp and capacitor indicators). this means the rng is more biased towards more frequent/higher heat damage as you keep overheating your modules. once you stop overheating, heat status starts diminishing, albeit at a slower rate than stacking up.
---
Vippy is terrible don’t use it.  They literally had a guy Corp hopping trying to get corps to use it.
---
nice troll, loved choris reaction
---
You sound pissed about a stranger spending money in a game, that shows how stupid you can be, how many people start Ève and actually stay playing ? Just be quiet
---
Mittens tweeted about it, spies had nothing to do with it lol
---
What is this? A super fleet for ants?
---
I got a sweet deal 39bil for 10 rag hulls in Winter Co and 41 in GFS  before rorq nerf this year.
---
Nobody is forced to attend anything.  All it means is you have to attend *something*, around once a month.
---
Come on, burn out of it, burn out of it, burn out of it, I'm there!
---
Nope I'm dead. 
---
Every fleet I've had a sabre alt in ever.
---
NOOO if you look really close you can see gila getting ready to run missions ^^
---
Je suis Escal zephyr
---
Then why not use siggy?
---
No im not pissed at anything I think you’re a colossal dumbfuck and you wanna keep litigating this.  Keep rage posting it feeds me the daily diet of salt I enjoy.
---
Then EVE probably isn't the right game for you because the PVE in this game is fucking horrendous. It's almost like CCP designed it to be simple as hell so people can do it easily so they can fight more.
---
Yes.  It's not like people are prevented from leaving Goons is it.
---
/r/eve: RENTERS BAD!
---
Test: Ok, we hear you, we kicked out some of our renters and installed a new up-and-coming group that might introduce new content in a few months. Yes, Omist is a bit out of the way for Panfam but reasonably close to FRAT space where they can find TZ-friendly content - but not close enough so they get stomped in the first week.
---
/r/eve: MORE BLUES BAD!
---
Test: The fuck? The region was blue before so nothing changed but the new guys might actually be interested in big-boy PvP later
---
/r/eve: CHINAMEN BAD!
---
Test: You know? I'm done with this shit.
---
free because he bought it himself
---
LMAO some dude lost 15b, be chori and sperg out on comms about it like it's 1T.
---
Are you a poor chori?
---
You can. See dronelands
---
Y’all are posting like they have 30 keepstars and 2 full Titan fleets.
---
better plottwists then in game of thrones season 8
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
Not really. High-sec can use some content besides saving the damsel
---
Is that why your campaign failed a few months ago? [Since you and Init failed](https://youtu.be/SlV-Grsy_fM), your leadership had to blue 50,000 people (goons) and went to the Chinese server to get another 30k+. I wouldn't get it twisted that it would take anything less than the entirety of nullsec to evict us.
---
Ask init if test shoots them lol
---
Thanks for the details, this mechanic is definitely something that does not get mentioned enough, especially how it works. I know new players have enough stuff to worry their heads about when starting, but stuff like this should probably at least get a rudimentary mention that it exists and can make a big difference if used properly.
---
I mostly asked because overheating had just saved my ship in an abyssal site and I wanted to be able to better use it to my advantage instead of just relying on chance that I be saved by it or be screwed by it.
---
it was started to fund the AT team and then it apparently just got away from the guy who started it.
---
You were in TXG, probably the only good group in there.
---
Come on up and see what we've done with the place since evicting you
---
You didn't need to blue up, TEST had 3 titans. You did blue up everybody to take the north from goons though. You blues up with everyone to try to follow TEST yet again in the south. You didn't need to blue up anyone to take out Hero because they didn't have shit either. Funny how only time PL complains is when they're not the big boys.
---
even if it was a tril that they actually lost, who fuckin cares that much
---
who's talking about holding anyone responsible for anything?
---
Very fragile people that derive their sense of self worth from others.
---
The three fleets in three months rule only applies to Karmafleet, and if you're going on fewer than one fleet a month, why even join a null corp? That's less "they force members to go on fleets!", and more "removing people who are totally inactive or so obsessed with isk making that they can't be bothered to contribute one hour a month".
---
Like in UALX?
---
No what matters is that someone enjoys EVE so much they spend their time creating art for others to enjoy.
---
Seems just like a regular locust fleet to me
---
Or you can get all your old mates to join the worst pirates in Eve ;)
---
Yeah living next to the biggest and most powerful alliance in the game is very dangerou...
---
Oh wait, they are getting evicted by the chinese alliance smaller than themselves that they tried to invade. But yeah, the few Hordelings and NCdock that burn down for some timers definitely warrant blueing everyone that can't run away fast enough.
---
Maybe if you count the 90% of Brave that hasn't logged in for the last year.
---
This is super cool info. Thank you!!!!
---
I'd be pretty annoyed too if I trusted someone to haul out/sell super shiny loot from a fleet and they lost it in such a retarded way.
---
So we are getting a new big war ?
---
PUBH
---
Yes. I can't log in with your password either.
---
High sec Fight Club when?
---
You just described the whole population of EVE, could you narrow that down please?
---
No problem man, have a good one!
---
So goons are gonna fight who this time ?
---
I want to have my haw dread on this kind of things... But i'm afraid my enemies will be smart, and will drop anti cap dreads / bombers or keep me bubbled and I'll just die being kitted.
---
yeah I know I feel bad for all the people in Indonesia that wanna log into my account but can't ;-;
---
We used Vippy like 2 years ago or something and it almost killed our corp.
---
You.
---
Actually, there's more Titans actually undocked than I remember
---
Not everyone has a pap minimum
---
Where's GOTG's recruitment and memes boasting their coalition?
---
Honestly, with some of this shit people have said to me in game, telling someone your going to cut off their hands doesn't even rank in the top 20.
---
&gt;Utorrent
---
  *Hmmmmmmmm*
---
Kinda suck that the "number that actually matters" ***IS*** the number of ratters and krabs. If Panfam looses ten titans, how long do they need to replace them? A few weeks maybe? Now how long do Goons need? Is that even still measured in days?
---
It seems PL prefers to deal thermal damage
---
That's just one everyday goon multiboxing their ratting fleet.
---
what are you even talking about
---
Ooohhh I get it
---
Cap = Capital
---
Your mom's
---
"All of the south and PL were trying to evict us!"
---
"So what that they couldn't because they are smaller than us, they were trying!"
---
The CEO should create a FW accou t and learn to lose, then eventually win solo. Then start growing from there.
---
It was always fun fighting with you guys.  Sad that things have gone downhill for Querious since the Brave/Rote/PFR/Squirrels/Etc version went down in flames, but it was obvious that that experiment wasn't going to work long-term without some ring kissing.
---
Test isn't a wh corp. 
---
Rest of the post checks out.
---
In said "golden era" caps were not there to kill/gank subs
---
Mining Chat, It's Off the chain.
---
I don't even understand how these retardo pubbies think anyone's getting away with botting in Delve with it full of autistic VNI boxers that attend court-ordered anger management sessions in regard to the incident which transpired the last time someone beat them to the rock haven respawn
---
Cheapest I have seen around 40-45b. Averages were 50-60b still. Really just depends on the builder frankly.
---
The Ti, she will be Di
---
yeah, I was once in WI. for a few years while unsubbed and only after I came back did I eventually get a mail telling me I had to get a couple of paps or get booted. Slightly less than the once per month mentioned above.
---
Time to start cap production in bot
---
Which is really the summary of why this game sucks right now. 
---
"You should be winning but sucks for you that we decide the timing lol"
---
whats a hard knocks
---
Whatever floats your boat dummy
---
As long as you're having fun and making friends.
---
You can always pay people.
---
now do that to every system, with all of the cyno jammers being in either keep or cit grids. The problem isn't dealing with one timer, but the huge amount of systems you'd need to evict someone. You ain't gonna see sov being taken piecemeal, but one side figuring that it's not worth it anymore and leaving it all. I'd kill myself before grinding in tidi an entire region of cyno jammers
---
true, I miss the Brave Rote version of QFC bud
---
Best time I had in Querious is when pandemic legion messed around. Annoying? yes, however our infinitely wise lying leader forgot to blue all the blues. Friendly fights commenced with a gentlemans agreement of only sub caps, and leaving rorquals alone. That was the best time.
---
Jita sometimes lags.  Give it some time maybe
---
Hello 911 I've just witnessed a murder
---
... yes I'll hold ...
---
found the dickbutt
---
Now come in with an Eris and see nobody lock you because they have no clue what you are.
---
I've never flown a carrier but will be getting one soon, is there a fighter management 101 video i should watch?
---
Woah woah woah... it’s shitstainguy.  Carry on
---
How long did the shading on the mango take?
---
Is the OP eng native speaker? It seems he gets it all wrong ...
---
^^quietly ^^re-approaches ^^gate ^^without ^^agressing
---
name it ares and you're basically cloaked
---
Nerds having fun. good stuff
---
1. The armor timer in X47 had, the kill timer [however](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1967,1967,1967,1967,1967,1967&amp;b=8206080,8206170,8206260,8206350,8206320,8206530&amp;e=90,90,90,90,210,90&amp;t=ickiQsIaaaaaaaaaaaaaaae)...
---
2. The fleets you can field don't tell the whole story. The security krabbers enjoy in Delve has given the Imperium the handy advantage of being *much* more able to replace any losses. When the north lost less Titans numerically on the X47 armor timer, it still took a much bigger hit economically, despite killing the molok and the vendetta.
