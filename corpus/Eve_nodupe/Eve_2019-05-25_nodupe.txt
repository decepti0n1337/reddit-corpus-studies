i spin ships docked in high-sec while being in an npc corp now, feeling all warm and fuzzy dreaming about the days of being in a fleet of battleships pressing f1 against other fleets of battleships pressing f1; wishing it were so once again. worth the $15 a month.
---
oh my sweet summer child....
---
Explorer hunters are gonna have a field day.
---
Go find Ripard Tegs recent AMA about his NDA's on CCP while he was on CSM. Hilmar came across like one of the single most out of touch people at the company from some of his stories.
---

---
That was years ago but, either he is finally aware or someone gave him some feel good talking points. 
---
As an example, Hilmar couldn't imagine why if two fleets were fighting why a third fleet not aligned with either of those two would join the fight.
---
You "bullshit" your customers.
---
They are gonna try a new kind of incursions, which already exist in the game but it's pretty old, and if it works they are just gonna replace one for the other.
---
That's what all the lore pieces about they hating Sansha's Nation is about.
---
The isk stolen is baffling. This must have been a full time job.
---
The one thing I'll say is that the music was way too loud for your voice so the commentary was difficult to hear.
---
Nice video and well commentated! May I just ask why you decided to burn into the battleships instead of just being at 30km range with mwds off? Given their heavy neuts, high dps and webbing capabilities its certain death going close no? Maybe death was unavoidable given the hel and bombers on grid, but wouldve gotten a few more then atleast :)
---
Loved the few things we did with DPCI in fountain. Olmeca is a true content creator and I'll happily give him my vote for csm.
---
@u/jestertrek thoughts?
---
as a newbro, an explorer, and nullsec player I can say there are enough people doing exploration that we map WHs almost as fast as they appear. in my area we are even strating to roll them is we don't want them around.
---
 this changes nothing.
---
No.
---
Not sure if meta or just ...
---
&gt;It's not our job to report bots, that's CCP's job.
---
Thanks for getting me kicked from Bombers Bar. It genuinely widened my gameplay experience lol.
---
o7
---
It'd be funny if the evidence ccp released on bots actually happened to have some goons. But it didn't.
---
Don't go shaming ass eating.
---
The burst jammer can break lock but it doesn't have the best range.
---
Dude eve is pretty lazy in general. It is a bunch of really easy game mechanics hidden behind complicated ways to make them work. I don’t think adding this will be any more game breaking then having the ability to use dot lan or eve marketeer
---
We did, sadly. With squads and sigs the fights were fun for quite some time until the batphones and the cap drops started happening. The north will get 0 sympathy from me on this one.
---
Fighting outgunned/outnumbered and emerging victorious is the most rewarding thing in this game, you should try it some time. I challenge you.
---
Nah mate, I'm just being dense and trying to pick a fight.
---
So you use dot lan or eve marketeer?
---
You just got third place on my ballot. Excellent work
---
So even if they make bots harder to detect, you dont want to ban VPNs?
---
On a non-business connection,  you get 1-2 addresses.
---
Oh yeah, those titan blobs are fun.  Not that sitting on the Jita undock is any better.
---
please roll more holes, this is never a bad idea
---
&gt; So even if they make bots harder to detect, you dont want to ban VPNs?
---
they don't make bots harder to detect
---
that's a false premise.
---
&gt;On a non-business connection, you get 1-2 addresses.
---
you can get as many as you ask for.
---
There's a typo. 2229
---
daily downvote FeelsOkayMan
---
I am really tempted to unsubscribe all 5 of my accounts so I am not a part of this stupidity. You are taking away what makes Eve, Eve. What am I exploring if I can see exactly what is what 1j away? You also managed to introduce more safety for the krabs in Rorqs and supers as they now have an easier way to determine if there is a wormhole nearby. Keep it up CCP, you will lose revenue at this rate.
---
&gt; Just try less hard for once
---
goons try really hard at this game, and yet are pretty bad at it
---
It's gotta be the reverse. Some dev hopped on, tried exploration for two minutes, and went "wouldn't this be easier if you could see where you should go next? Yeah, I'm sure the players would love that!"
---
You had no problem hunting and farming FCON to literal death.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Reading the note, it looks like it's just the anoms that are auto revealed anyway that don't require probing out.  Am I reading this wrong?
---
Excellent video
---
What I've also noticed over the past few years is the increase in effort or "autism" or whatever needed to get meaningful content. I think it's one of the reasons why so many people unsub.
---
For example, a guy who logs in once a week and calls for a caracal fleet often gets dunked on by cap umbrellas more now than ever. Having 60 alts seeded is impressive in and of itself, and you certainly deserve the content you get (and maybe a bit more), but it's a bit absurd that this has become one of the few ways to hurt megablocs. The fact that you need so much preparation to achieve something meaningful is one of the reasons I think eve has trouble retaining new players
---
While I hate being jammed as much as the next guy, that seems like a hella nerf.
---
&gt; If you weren't trying to maximize isk then just ignore this change. You can pretend it never happened and it won't effect you at all. 
---
I see this sentance structure all the time.
---
But everyone knows that everyone wants to use all the tools at their disposal regardless of if it goes against what they want to do.  
---
Their game has now changed for the worse for those people who didn't want this.
---
The game has also improved for the better for those people who find this helpful.
---
I would love to be mining in a venture as an alpha clone if it were as profitable as exploring. But the choices that EvE has made has lead to me not mining because I simply can't churn a solid profit.
---
We're all negatively effected by the changes that effect the meta in a way we find undesirable and it's foolish to think that just ignoring it is an option people would choose as if we would choose to play in a sub par manner.
---
We all strive for something and generally following the meta is just the best way to reach those goals.
---
100% this. PH deployed Supers against Sig&amp;Squads.  Like ni**a please, we would have a hard time vs a full PH subcap fleet alone. In top of that you had NC deploy to the area aswell,  so please, stfu about blobbing
---
c s m h y p e s  
---
just don't let the spodbees distort your manner of providing feedback, very interested to see what you'll bring to the table if elected
---
great content also, though i was distracted a lot by the windows interface, it could be cropped at parts that didn't involve multiboxing imo. it may be just me though.
---
If you have one IP address from your ISP and you want to connect 50 bots, this is easily detectable.
---
&gt;you can get as many as you ask for.
---
To be honest I don't really see the crabs watching that window like a hawk, and dispatching a scanner/rollers as soon as a new sig pops. If you're rage rolling a NS static, you appear in local for them anyway, and if your hole has been there for a while then they could've just as easily spotted it the old-fashioned way. 
---
I agree it's a silly change and I can't speak to the effect it will have on exploration, but I don't really think it makes crabs that much safer than they already are.
---
&gt;imagine being this triggered about a good change in the game
---
A keepstar would like to talk to you.
---
Someone just told me highsec only? Holy shit CCP you are stupid. Give the content to the thousands of people that actually keep your game going and draw news for your game. Not some rando's in highsec that won't even actually fight them...what a waste of coding.
---
Pros: it mentions me  
---
cons: its olmeca effort posting again
---
I agree and you're totally on point.
---
It's not that you can't kill a titan under Delve's supercap umbrella. But you have to be really at the higher edge of the spectrum for that to happen. And even then you also need dumb luck.
---
plexing also lets you go beyond it by virtue of training alpha compatible skills
---
I’ve seen goons drops multiple titans in solo t1 frigates, wtf you know about blobbing whine?
---
&gt; No.
---
yes
---
first it was hon, then it was a snapping noise, then it was pap which turned into mine and then it degenerated into a complete cluster fuck
---
What's the logic of doing that? Just curious.
---
Yeah Eve is much less pretty since I got into multiboxing. I have to use potato mode too. It's one of the unfortunate side effects. But the most exciting parts of the game for me actually occurs when I multibox.
---
Gotta rewatch this again later :)
---
&gt; You have the safest sapce for PVE
---
this was a core part of our strategy, you know? it took effort and other people were too lazy, or too culturally conditioned to look down on anything other than leet pvp, to do it.
---
&gt; Going voluntary to a less strong side which will mean harder game (pve interrupt by camping, being dropped, ,evicted, with smaller defense fleet and so on) isn't in the current way of playing games for quite some people.
---
it ain't like a large part of the recruitment base for NCPL over the years hasn't been guys that wanted to join the winning side. PL's specialty in a bunch of wars was recruiting the FCs from people they beat up on.
---
the question every alliance has to ask is what keeps people playing with them and what would make them leave. if a large part of the answer is a promise of "all we do is win win win" then you have a potential problem.
---
What’s the “Hon Hon Hon” reference?
---
running out of memory on your gpu doesn't crash the game, just slows down the rendering as it has to fetch textures from main memory. (which is why the 5 FPS and 10% GPU -- pulling textures from system ram is a horrendous choke point.)
---
Nah
---
A coalition of cluster fucks you could say
---
No mention of suspect timer on T4 and T5 abyssals. Anybody know if that made the cut?
---
This says cosmic anomalies. Not cosmic signatures.
---
I have a dedicated dread alt almost cooked. How do I join this group to assist in the death of delve safety?
---
Also amazing video, you'll get my vote mostly because I miss my Redeemer.
---
 if u check dscan  u can see The Imperium forming up at 6RCQ  for ther new home in tribute
---
thats midle of night in working day of week in EU it was  3 AM and if u check dscan u can see  thats just armor fleet titans mainly
---
so qwestion i would ask wher is all the  rags and levi (shield fleet) if thay are not  NORTH??
---
anyone nows?
---
Play it as you want, if playing the no risk cap blob game is fun for you, ok, who cares about your point?
---
But you are basically saying: “Fight us! Yes, we are going to jump multiple cap fleets on you and you will die very fast, but WE (Goons) will have fun, and thats what matters, right? Just pixels! That you will fight morons in Delve? Uuugh, I dont understand you, why you not fighting us and making game fun for me, you meanie!”
---
Your comment reeks of entitlement.
---
Am I bringing a harbringer or are the ships probided1!
---
Did you not read the first half of my comment?
---
Right, which still has nothing to do with 64 bit.
---
right.  I've seen a fair share of different fights but the one I still value the most was one with my tiny ass alliance fighting other tiny ass alliances. Was a moment's whim thing and I think those moments are more memorable and fun than any 8 hour long tidifest. Tidi fests are what get people hearing about and getting into eve but it's those small spontaneous fights that get people staying
---
Since that one pack went free and grants me a week of Omega, I’m thinking of setting up some PI for when I return to Alpha, to get some passive income.
---
Here’s my plan. I’m researching the skills needed right now. When that’s done, I’ll set up a PI facility on a nearby planet. I’ll run that and keep it running when I’m in alpha. Since when I’m in alpha I can’t use a customs office, I’ll use a launchpad I’ll set up to grab 500 m3 of resource for a quick cash boost whenever I need it. I’ll leave the rest in the facility to accumulate.
---
This is the second time in recent history where EVE gave these free Omega clone state giveaways. Who’s to say they won’t do it again? Either way, whenever I get the opportunity to get back to Omega, I grab all those resources and enjoy a huge payout.
---
Will my plan work? Will I be able to maintain the PI facility in Alpha? I’m also setting up a facility on a planet with 9% abundance of the resource I’m extracting; is this enough? What can I do for a lot of cash, preferably passively, when I return to Alpha? Thanks :)
---
2j out? Fuck, Ive killed Krabs in the same system as the connection.
---
This video is a masterpiece, congratulations Olmeca you probably made the best eve online video in 2019. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wish you luck in your CSM Campaign, I make fun of your posting style a little, but there is no doubt you are one of the most creative, intelligent and dedicated players in eve and if you get elected you'll do a great job at representing all of the hunting playstyles which have stagnated due to safety in nullsec.
---
There is no ISP that will give you unlimited public IPs. You know they are scarce, right?
---
https://www.ripe.net/publications/ipv6-info-centre/about-ipv6/ipv4-exhaustion
---
&gt;If you have one IP address from your ISP and you want to connect 50 alts, this is easily detectable.
---
Your point? The idea is most people dont do this. So if you run 50 bots off a single address, they will be easily detectable.
---
&gt;the 'removal' of VPNs wouldn't make bots be caught easier, only increasing the ease at which we can link bots to individuals. 
---
Because you cannot get many address from an ISP, you need VPNs to spread the bots out. This way, VPNs make it more difficult to detect suspicious numbers of connects.
---
Thanks. And thanks for the Gold.
---
You once told me Delve/Goons live rent-free in my head. But at least now you know some of the reasons why.
---
This video is why i love eve, seeing how people adapt, create and try unheard of things .  Well done, and keep bringing the content!
---
Can you get pi of the planet without the customs office? Idk if you can
---
Exactly. Daily fights is an equal or superior source of content compared to timer fights. Particularly in the age of citadels, where people really don't have an ingame incentive to be on the offensive.
---
The spod must flow
---
Wow you’re an angry idiot. Ok. Have fun with your smooth brain.
---
we'll have ships to hand out
---
Great video my dude! I've always been curious as to how you do it, but it's a really cool setup you have. :)
---
This actually happened to me the other day and I can't remember it happening before. Could be a new bug, someone should reproduce and submit a report if it is a result of a recent patch
---
And the moron of the day award goes to ... CanumFerox!
---
Congrats, dude!
---
&gt; There is no ISP that will give you unlimited public IPs. You know they are scarce, right?
---
you don't need infinite
---
&gt;Your point? The idea is most people dont do this. So if you run 50 bots off a single address, they will be easily detectable.
---
Most people already don't do this, so your change is pointless
---
&gt;Because you cannot get many addresses from an ISP, you need VPNs to spread the bots out. This way, VPNs make it more difficult to detect suspicious numbers of connects.
---
I want to make ISK fast as an alpha and none of the PvE options seem very good...
---
So I’m wondering how I could go about doing work for other players with basically no good ships, and getting paid decently! :) :P
---
What options are there to get paid significant amounts of ISK by players, preferably a way I can do passively without investing so much time (or like where I travel long distances on autopilot to pick up a few things; I don’t have a big cargo hold).
---
The ISK grind is my least favorite part about EVE. I want a way past it, I basically want a job. What are my options?
---
(Please don’t say get an IRL job and buy PLEX to sell for ISK. I’m looking for an ingame way)
---
&gt;you don't need infinite
---
Nor could you get 16, 8 or even 4 in most cases.
---
&gt;Most people already don't do this, so your change is pointless
---
Botters do this, except they use VPNs to hide. Do you see how getting rid of VPNs would make detection easier?
---
To be fair they did in fact undock for a short time last night but only long enough to feed us a little over half their munnin fleet and a half dozen caps.
---
Amazing video, felt like I was watching Rooks and kings.
---
We killed one titan that was neither and I was referring to that one. The others were either afk or outside range, thats true.
---
This one: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76385004/

Correct, there's a bug atm where they were not receiving the bonus but nobody can read apparently.
---
No, been playing so long I know where stuff is. Got an alt in jita
---
Bravo, that's a great video.
---
Yeah, you've got my vote. We're not always on the same side, but you're pushing for a style of gameplay that I love but I think is slowly being made extinct by (unintentional?) nerfs from CCP. We need that voice on the CSM.
---
Excellent video.
---
Reddit shit talking for my space tribe. I loved this. And I'll keep being in the response fleets who drop on you. But I definitely don't want you to stop.
---
I'm hoping for a Trig star, planet and jump gate buster weapon and some radical editing of New Eden geography. That would be a proper threat.
---
You are bringing up rando excuses to somehow offset you being a lazy pos, from this to “I don’t care” bullshit. Clearly you do care and clearly you are the lazy trash that needs hand holding for your gameplay.
---
send 500m to DJ's retirement fund
---
There needs to be more high quality Eve videos like this. Eve YouTube is lacking and I feel that you can be the change needed.
---
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in drake
---
you can see something spawned, but WH's aren't a part of the list of things that will be shown, so it will just show a signature
---
I checked out the comments just to downvote all the goon sperg that was bound to be here. I'm doing my part :)
---
Lol wow. No I just don’t understand why this is ruining your day it literally has 0 effect on game play you can already see these things and exploration is just random warping around. So how is a tool that would let you plan a trip the end of the world. Honestly I will prob never even open this tool cause who cares there are anoms everywhere
---
&gt;Nor could you get 16, 8 or even 4 in most cases.
---
i get 16 and it costs me $5 a month
---
&gt;Botters do this, except they use VPNs to hide. Do you see how getting rid of VPNs would make detection easier?
---
well you could train some alpha compatible skills and keep them
---
But you don’t freak out about all the third party tools for the game the same way? In most games tools like the ones available in eve are cheats
---
You should be a lot more concerned about nothing ever actually happening after hilmar talks then goons blocking changes. We have been a loud voice for several changes including ones that benefited us because it would make the overall game better stop drinking the grrrr goon koolaid for a second.
---
Only omegas can vote though. So all those alpha votes are just whispers into the ether.
---
Here’s the deal I understand why you could be upset about this. We had to play the game the hard way but we also don’t know how this plays into CCPs bigger picture so why not just stay positive about it and see if it helps generate interesting content for everyone.
---
Yeah, noob doesn't know to just crit the wh and leave it.
---
Oh wait :S
---
You fucking legend, you have my vote
---
I'm not seeing where he's talking about loading from disk. Higher levels of graphics settings consume more memory, which means that even if you have a time-traveling PC from 2059 you will hit the 32-bit application space barrier.
---
replace "RAM" with "allocated memory" and the post was strictly true.
---
&gt; Gfx memory counts towards an applications address space.
---
but it can also hold duplicated data, or directly access memory in other locations, without allocating more address space
---
You clearly care since you keep posting...my day isn’t ruined, I just find this wholly a “hand holding” experience that does nothing for actual exploration as it stands. It is one if not the easiest gameplay already yet you want it all done for you. 
---
Only real challenge comes from the DED sites the rest is cake town.
---
What is the avantage of ventures over other frigs when deplexing ?
---
Pay less for subscription fees. I currently have 4 characters with enough industry, pve and pvp skill sets across the board that I really only need 1 account to play.  With the consolidation of power blocks in the game there is no need for everyone who does not own a super to have their very own cyno chain. I have never nor feel the need to get into the meta game.  I like to violence space pixels.  The tunes I am likely to keep have years of training time in them.  The most combat oriented toon has the ability to use all subcaps with full support skill and some capitols in the same boat.  The others are just more specialized in industry and buggery.  I can simply biomass my market toon once he has transfered all assets.  The other toons are, to my knowledge, cyno alts.  I might just log in to be sure.  I am not running links for small gangs or solo.  I love playing in small gangs, and if I need to have the links, I will do it in a vulture an eos or a damnation because they can fulfill a smaller but notable role at the same time.  Shit I could do that in any t3 and not be a liability on the field.
---
There are only two corporations that are being held by those toons that are worth holding alive so placing those toons to hold them will suffice.  I think Kenny still has the original corp so it doesn't matter one bit.  All of that is simply for nostalgic reasons and holding good names off of the market. 
---
This was a game for me, and never will be a hobby.  I choose to spend my time with other games as well as other healthy hobbies when I am not grinding IRL.  
---
Why would you need to have more than 1 account in my position?
---
So who’s testing on Linux?  I’m going to set up a wine install through Lutris for this alongside the current 32 bit version.
---
Got my vote, keep up the good work.
---
'99 called, they want their stale memes back. 
---
Thx bruv.
---
Negative, eve marketeer isn’t always correct and has delays in the info. Dotlan almost all of it has a ingame feature that states almost everything if you know how to use it same as dotlan. Only difference was kills and Corp player info both of which don’t work unless they fixed it since last I checked it out. Also most of the “tools” you say are cheats most games have or have had for quite some time.
---
Nothing about this is hand holding if anything it’s going to make it harder to do it. It will create more competition for sites and prob will change the meta of care bear scan ships to be more equipped for pvp to fight for sites. I just think you should keep a open mind about it. If anything lobbying against this is the QQ mindset of a carebear that just wants their sites to them selves. I bet you we see a huge spike in the cost of the items from these sites and a large increase in the number of exploration ships blown up.
---
It plays into lazy people being rewarded for being lazy. My mentality is punish the lazy like eve is known for not give them a buff.
---
Still means you can't go some places. You're locked into period basis. And the alliance you have to join probably has war decs active.
---
So you are ok with selective handholding from third parties but not with a QOL change from the actual developers of the game. CCP has made a game that you have enjoyed for a long time imo give them some credit.
---
Just goons trying to make something out of the blue balls war.
---
Missed the part about the \~10% FPS improvement eh?
---
That is our job as players and this change will give us a tool to do just that!
---
I got the reference, updoot for you.
---
Capital proliferation? Lets just add moving keepstars to the meta. Great idea m8 you should apply to CCP.
---
It has a warp core stability bonus so it is more resilient against scrams or warp disruptors.  
---
It is an underrated and often overlooked ship and can be dangerous in the right hands.  
---
Not sure if those are alpha clone hands, but it is a fun ship.   
---
Not that d-plexing is much fun.
---
Not sure how much being an alpha clone affects running missions, but that might be an option... FW missions can be kinda fun.
---
&gt; What options are there to get paid significant amounts of ISK by players, preferably a way I can do passively without investing so much time (or like where I travel long distances on autopilot to pick up a few things; I don’t have a big cargo hold).
---
there is this line from a movie that translates roughly as "i don't want my drink spilled but i don't want my ass fucked either" which is a terrible translation but the moral is, you can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
anyway, since you are at a very early stage as evident by "I don’t have a big cargo hold", veteran players are basically looking for excuses to give you money. if you join a new player friendly group (not necessarily some null bloc or whatever), fly tackle/scout in fleets and ask cute newbro questions, you'll eventually accumulate a tidy sum of isk that will carry you through these early stages. this is not very passive, mind you, but newbros usually don't get to say "i don't want to have no isk but i don't want to spend effort either"
---
also if you have any skills irl that may have an eve application such as illustration, writing spreadsheets or erp, you can make a nice living out of commissions. do not be afraid to step up and inquire with people who may be interested in your woodworking experience.
---
Dotlan isn’t any different than the eve map, so it isn’t a cheat. Only a couple of select things on dotlan are hand holding but 90% of it is the same info as in game only people went out of game to do it.
---
Eve marketers isn’t always right, you have to be in system for the actual profitable market trading all day everyday (of which I have a trading alt to do and know my niche markets)
---
Dubstep was extremely big when new and everyone shoved it everywhere even if it wasn't thematically fitting. Glad that ended.
---
Fucking great story telling my dude.
---
Brought me back to my RnK video watching days. Awesome
---
&gt;i get 16 and it costs me $5 a month
---
Unlikely. But if true, you either belong to an incredibly small minority, or you have a business plan.
---
It is not pointless because it forces botters to use fewer addresses.
---
&gt;you seem to confuse the difference between banning people and banning accounts
---
Why is that relevant?
---
&gt;VPNS do not allow you to detect bots easier-
---
Im talking about banning VPNs because getting rid of them makes it easier to detect bots.
---
Lucky you are here to tell everyone how elite you are on every thread, noone would know otherwise.
---
Right, you can see "something" spawned, which makes it either a combat sig, a WH or a relic/data site. Odds are someone is running relic/datas and will check it out soonish and then if its a WH they will let folks know.
---
The issue is that you don't need to just hop systems and hope to find an un-done sig, you can zip straight to new ones via the agency.
---
This is always going to be an issue with corps like this.  The trick is to carve your niche in the alliance, though you do not need to know what that is if you're a newbean.
---
Do not forget you still know and there is so much more in the alliance that you have not seen because of op-SEC. Whenever you join an alliance you will always feel like the new kid on the block. 
---
As for tips, join ever single fleet you can make that is pinged in the "pings" channel on discord. These will always be pvp fleets and there is always someone willing to help. 60% of the time we get newbeans in the newbean comms too, this is because I want comms to be open. Ask anything even if it is not even directly related to the current objective.
---
If you do not know already we have an open pvp group called "partisans" look them up on the forum. 
---
Also, remember an NBI will give you a free ship any time you lose an NBI ship. The easiest way to learn is by failing and trying again.
---
Once you know what you want to do in eve, join "The Padawan Program", you will be matched with someone in vanguard who is online at the same time as you and will teach you everything you ever need to know about your chosen subject.
---
If you ever just want to chat and be social: Gem standing if you do not mind talking to a bunch of 4-year-olds. Mining coms is great for being social or talking about the game, including PvP. 
---
"partisans" coms is a decent mixs of both.
---
Hope this wall of text is some help, fly safe dude o7
---
Cool. We're Serenity.

Trit prices rise in Jita
---
Fuck you.  TAQOSQAD will not stand for this treachery!
---
Go to x system for 5 sites......gimme that salt bear. The system will make dudes like me who can scan most of a system in a couple mins burn all the good sites and leave casuals like you grabbing the trash. This takes any and all effort and achievement out of exploration and will punish new players. Expo is done by new players because it doesn’t require pvp intensive skills which take a long time to get and train. This also won’t change the “pvp” mindset of new players as they don’t have that yet and most explo ships can’t really fight back anyways aside from the sisters ships.
---
You’re the guy in this that forgot to switch out his pod and I’m the Garmur pilot &lt;3
---
PL is alive and thriving, deploying fleets to participate in elite Pee Vee Pee activities such as gate camping, fleet invite/fleet warp ganking, and unanchoring structures to avoid fights and deny their enemies kills.
---
Truly the pinnacle of the Eve.
---
&gt; NC and PL needs to know how good we are at making fun of the French Language!
---
Don’t worry. Everyone already knows how cringe worthy goons are
---
No it won’t, it is the exact opposite.
---
And just like that eve is no longer dying
---
Ok thanks !
---
I don't think that's part of the deal. just non aggro and defense pact.
---
So I get a 70b ship. finally! Go on a few ops with it. great! Go on vacation with the family. Come back, station it was docked at is gone, along with ship.
---
This is your proposal?
---
Great video, and I will say you have my vote for CSM.  This is the way I would love to play as a solo player.
---
The downvoters do not know de wae.
---
cry more
---
&gt; Unlikely. But if true, you either belong to an incredibly small minority, or you have a business plan.
---
so you're wrong
---
&gt;It is not pointless because it forces botters to use fewer addresses.
---
Most people already don't do this, so your change is pointless (ie makes no measurable impact)
---
&gt;Why is that relevant?
---
because it's what i'm saying
---
you're trying to disprove what i'm saying by saying something unrelated
---
&gt;Im talking about banning VPNs because getting rid of them makes it easier to detect bots.
---
this is factually untrue, banning VPNs has no impact on detection of botters
---
let's do a small thought experiment: if CCP knows 100% of who uses a VPN and doesn't, why not just investigate VPNers of botting without banning them?
---
Then we shall take to the forums to complain to CCP!! Wait...
---
I see this as an improvement and positive life choice
---
Yup that's what I thought.
---
Me and u 1v1 at the sun
---
You can passive train into a Rorqual alt in about 3-5 months. Injectors are a problem but removing them doesn't stop people from getting into Rorquals, it just makes it take a little longer.
---
Rorquals need to be removed from being a mining ship altogether, and turned into a real boosting platform. Nerf excavators by 90% and commensurately reduce their cost. You can still mine in your Rorqual, but the real power would come from enhancing a fleet of barges and helping your corpmates. Or your 20 alts, I guess.
---
What kind of developer works customer support? The structure is usually L1 (usually handled by client or in house), L2, L3 (sometimes), then development.
---
Well done. Very good video!!
---
Didn’t expect to be as captivated as I was. Masterclass storytelling. Incredible gameplay. Well done.
---
this sounds like a stupid fucking update
---
There was some funny ASCII art in local, that was a positive.
---
Fuck off, baby.
---
Lowsec 2019

---
FWIW I think you're a really smart, innovative, and imaginative EVE player, far more than I am. This video, along with your BB one exemplifies this. I still like one of your quotes from that other video - "They said I am just one guy, what can I do? Well let me show you" (roughly paraphrased, going off memory)
---
Where i think you come off as a huge cockbag is the way you dig your heels in and believe that your ideas, your analysis, and your way of playing is the only thing correct.
---
I would get back in, and gladly shell out bucks for a character avatar.
---
You thought a stuart little copy pasta was real and started trying to meme about how "What if my family was jewish".
---
Well, mine is. Fuck you. Bye.
---
If they undocked earlier, could this have been prevented?
---
Maybe you prefer to see more botting and RMT like the rest of EVE space is being used. Look at drone lands is that the sort of thing you would like to advocate for? Goons use the space as its intended and is one of the entities that supports a newer player getting to null sec. 
---
You need to look at cause and effect. What causes this style of play to occur. Solve this and you just might assist fix other concerns within the game. Many people just see you as an anti goon and therefore you lose some of the influence of your argument as one could claim that you are biased due to your hate of the goon alone.
---
This is really good insights and well put together. Well done Olmeca.
---
Fuck stuart little
---
Those dogs were good bois!
---
omgggggggggg I WAS THE CATYLEST
---
oof
---
Imagine being triggered this much by one person.
---
Exactly brooo
---
&gt;it was toxic as fuck.
---
welcome to 75% of the internet
---
So PL never report Bots ? now that makes total sense as panfam renters are on that graph much. thanks
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, there's a ton of edgelords in Eve, and they're very vocal. It's annoying attention seeking behavior.
---
There are also a ton of people in Eve who aren't. Surround yourself with those people, don't waste your time on the others. Just be aware that every alliance has a mix a both.
---
Also, there's an Eve discord server? Good god, I'd never want to see what that's like.
---
This guy got mad at a staurt little copy pasta then pinged multiple mods demanding we nuke everything. He also started trying to strong arm on behalf of the jewish people (he isn't jewish) so tl;dr implicit racism. 
---
If anything his ass getting banned lowered the toxicity.
---
Is it bad I didnt even know this was a feature? I just jump into a system if I want to know whats there
---
Aka the imperium harbors racists
---
&gt; it won't fix desync
---
As you mention desync: At least two times in the past (one in 2010 and the last one in 2017) desync (to be exact: position desync) was caused by a different precision when calculation collisions on the 32bit client compared to the 64bit server. This was fixed by somehow forcing to use a lower precision (if I can remember correctly).
---
I am not aware, that there are any desync cases still caused by the difference of 32bit and 64bit calculations, but it is for sure  a possibility. Unfortunately we could confirm a tiny bit of position desync in one of the 64bit mass tests (but in this case it was too little to be noticed without dev commands), so we can be sure that there are still other reasons around.
---
Thank you for ur service dad

what's the usual acceptance response time for this medium-sized to larger corps? i've been waiting a few weeks and i just wanna know if that's normal. i'm so new and i'm so lonely...
---
I am full of shit, not intentionally, I completely forgot about this AUTZ time one you alarm clocked for when nobody was online.
---
Always full of excuses... Hows the bubble camping going without your super cap umbrella?
---
I'm not referring to myself in that comment, I'm referring to others.
---
Gaze upon my field of fucks, and notice they are empty

How has this not been beeen deleted by the mods? It's terribly racist
---
Lmao

Do et

On reddit and calling smthn toxic hmmmmmm
---
NEED MORE HEALERS
---
Hi! Thanks for your comment and watching my video! 
---
Yes, I do it by holding approach key (Q), and double clicking!
---
The background music for me was very loud compared to the speech. (During the intro)
---
I like this one. I’m going to steal it
---
You've earned my vote.
---
This OP has to be satire, no one could honestly be that much of a flake.
---
Dude, so many downvoters. Like guys take a joke, jeez.
---
&gt; I am just curious why so many care of you don’t like it don’t use it problem solved. 
---
Like sorta like the whole copy every sig in well eve into a tool then copy them again when somebody rolls there K-space static is gonna become a thing rather quickly, meaning if you have a k-space static well rip hole control. 
---
But let's ignore that it gives advanced warning to everyone in a region that a new sig spawned so if you roll into nullsec the time you have to find somebody goes down massively as well everyone in eve now knowns a new sig appeared.
---
The playful banter was cool but them diving in and acting like they have no clue what is going on doesnt seem true. 
---
There seems to always be guides people follow the moment new exploration stuff pops up , unless they are portraying right at launch.
---
Just look at the Reddit history
---
If they really want to do this, they should just make it so that instead of showing a number, it shows a vague description of "signature activity" or something, so you can see where there are sites but not how many (i.e so you cant tell where wormholes appear)
---
the war for the north
---
a war in which imperium announced they were going on a roadtrip up north so the north started kicking down their own sandcastles and then had one fight before imperium declared victory and went home
---
It only has 3 launchers, but they're split to different sides, because missiles will always *roughly* fire at the enemy. You can watch your launchers closely and see which ones fire and when.
---
Wrong ammo and implants. Should have started off asking he could be his Drake.
---
The whole of Reddit doesn’t really give a shit about your corny in-jokes.
---
No
---
People who want to play WoW classic mostly don’t remember WoW classic.
---
your members and leaders posting in every thread that mentions hk shows that you actually care quite a bit about the respect of random third parties
---
Are they just free killmails though ?
---
It is actual eve lingo though.
---
Because he only asked the question to further strengthen his view with the answers.Any one of those not fitting in with the narrative are looked over of course
---
anyone experiencing minor lag?  Like one or two seconds in a nearly empty system in high security space?  I try aligning to a station.  The ship moves forward a few feet before returning to its original position.  Also, CONCORD and faction police ships move back in time.  Minor problem.  Issue usually happens after I jump through a stargate, I think.  I guess the game is loading data from my hard drive.  I can't afford a solid state drive.
---
Oddly enough I didn't notice the problem in the Didoxie system.
---
This lag issue only appears in Eve Online game.
---
it's legit  
---
btw im venture (the guy who said holocaust joke)

So I giit playing game for like five year came back and all my stuff is gone and skills as well what happend
---
Does it matter at this point? 
---
Like it seems clear to me CCP is aware of the negative implications and just doesn't care, in a way I'm almost hoping they ruin the last few interesting things and I can just biomass and be done.
---
Are there normal people playing this game?
---
I was wondering when you would show up.I mean it is a comment with a PL flair, you have to correct that noob, enforce the mighty goon narrative.

Good question. I guess we're going to find out.

we're shitting on tribute because fuck NC.

Never miss a chance to show the folks who claim to be good at supercaps how awful they are at supercaps, it is known. They are 0 for 3, lol.

It feels like WoW where fear was turned from a CC in to more of an interrupt....

Wow. This must be your first Mmo. Or possibly your first interaction with another human. You realize we're all garbage, right?
---
so you are missing items? have you tried contacting support?
---
It's kind of disgusting how this subreddit promotes racism. I mean if people love the game how do you expect racism to attract new players?
---
I didnt get shot first!
---
HTFU \^\^ its only for your benefit
---
It is just us having a bit of fun, sitting around a 1k people totally silent for hours and Asher let us let loose for a bit.  Same as the Tosche Station stuff from the last war. Although I think Tosche Station meme was better.
---
MFW CCP should directly interfere in the sandbox. Ok.
---
Discord is gay. Prove me wrong.
---
So if design has a new system then art will work with that idea to incorporate that in, think the torp launcher/bomb launcher spots on a stealth bomber, for these kinds of concepts its purely just its a ship that moves stuff, what does the trig as a race do for that.
---
Yay!

Keep up the fight man o7

How the hell do you even function in the real world? Does everyone around you just coddle you to death, or are you the type to screech until you get your way? Either way, it's people like you that are toxic and ruining this world. Go away.
---
got to make it more easyer for them probe bots to cherry pick
---
am whale. I had fun
---
TAQOSQAD!
---
I get worried with how they might botch it.
---
Me too. I spend considerably money and time in the eve universe and my salt is derived from the constant spitting in the face CCP does to myself and the rest of us here. 
---
I'm pretty fucking pissed about the whole god damned thing. Not because it's "not going my way" or "pvp isn't hard enough" -- But because nothing. Just nothing. Monitization and token events to drum up noise and more NOTHING. 
---
"CCPLEASE do X" threads here EVERY day highlighting REAL problems... Nada. Silence. Years go go buy and they throw some QOL shit at us in the same vein as what the dungeon finder did for wow... Death of community. 
---
I wan't to have hope. I want to have it for the Sake of EvE. But you do know what I have? 2 jobs. Software engineer... Space Industrialist. And being nuts deep into my 30s I just don't want to have to go learn a new game that probably doesn't exist anyways lol.

I always wondered why I never fly in stright lines even if AFK-cloak-camping for hours even days, changing directions now and then... Now I can tell the voices in my head that I WAS RIGHT TO DO THAT ALL ALONG! MMMWAHAHAHA!!!
---
...did... did you read my comment at all? That's not what I said at all. In fact I said the opposite of that. I even *asked* for dissenting opinions to understand the other side better.
---
Are you retarded? Or just hurf about on every post that has the word "Goon" in it?
---
Sounds like your account got stolen and stripped. This can happen when you choose a weak password, reuse your EVE password elsewhere, if your e-mail gets hacked, and/or when two factor authentication is disabled (2FA was introduced in Apr 2015).
---
Ever heard of safe logging? It worked for 15 years prior to citadels
---
Yeah, I do a little bit. I want big fights and stuff.
---
But I'm seriously trying to get a read on why nobody is even going to try, y'know? Something besides "ger goons hat goons"
---
I love the modding community one day we might see eve ships in garry's mod.
---
Keep it up mate, you got this!
---
Glad you find joy in this game, see you in space o7
---
Inspired by the Chinese corporation who bought them
---
"hey fleet me" "send them fleet invite" "join fleet" "fleet up" "they have a fleet forming up 5 jumps away"
---
Not "hey, let's fleet in that null-hole we have" "Thanks for letting me fleet with you through Lonetrek"
---
Maybe I'm overthinking it but that's not good grammar even by Eve lingo standards, this is totally from a english-only perspective so maybe I'm being a dick,  but I don' think so.
---
Ironic that PL are upset being chased by supers after years of "then PL dropped supers"
---
I still don't like you for what you did to all the line members in 745 and tried to shift the blame to others.
---
That being said....
---
I did enjoy the video and you most likely have my vote.
---
We need to be heard, and I like your PoV.
---
This might shock you, but highsec has a higher population than low and nullsec
---
I fought someone like you - on a much, muuuch "fewer accounts" level, but it was back in 2010, so, even doing 3 combat accounts back then was unusual... I never won, and oooh boy I hated him and his smug redeemer-face, but hot damn he was good, I would be the first to admit. Salute the playstyle &lt;o
---
sarcasm aside,  yes PL is alive.
---
they went into a period of inactivity after the hell camp, and so majority of them were idle or occupied when the Imperium first bashed into the north.
---
following this, they ended up doing a large reform, kicking and resetting parts of itself.  and is active again
---
though, are they at the strength they were in the past?  no.
---
As a player who has never been a PVPer or a member of a null alliance, this was a great video for seeing how the game is played out there, and I like the way you explain and illustrate your process. However, like some here I'm also disappointed to see another example of effective solo play requiring an absurd amount of accounts. I commend your patience in dealing with the logistics of that! Anyway, thanks for the awesome vid, I look forward to voting for you.
---
I remember when they removed the eight gun.
---
I remember thinking how they butchered the aesthetic.
---
FINALLY!
---
the 1,000,000 skill points must have been used to train attention seeking skill to lvl 5
---
You become like everyone else, and grow a pair. Welcome to Eve.
---
There is also specter and bombers bar. Though i know nothing about it or if you could be a fc. 
---
As others have said make a alt in an alliance you are connected to.
---
Thanks!
---
How much plex do I have to sacrifice to send them to delve
---
Welp, they ruined Kikimora.

"Lets create Russian-themed ship expansion. And then nerf it to hell."-CCP.

Please, diamond rats are npcs too, and pvp players completely avoid them at all costs.

LOL, d1~&gt;d2 was not fun, but now people are like... I wanna do that. People forget the suck.

It doesn't promote racism, little troll. It does, however, let it happen.
---
Funny a guy from LAWN is talking about Pathetic.
---
Last time I checked LAWN was bottom tier Pet Alliance.
---
Ah one of the classic blunders
---
Well, seems you are the retarded one here,  as I read it. You received exactly what you asked, an opinion. Now you dont want it?
---
What you want is the other side to fight a losing battle with little to no-chance whatsoever. All so YOU can have fun, because “just pixels”, amirite? And at the same time you whine that your enemy is killing idiots in Delve because thats not fun for YOU. Newsflash, pal: Who cares about your opinion on whats fun? If NC/PL, or whoever, engages that Goon fleet, they’ll not lose just their homes, they’ll lose their supercaps, aside of giving YOU an easy fight and some green tint on your killboard, how will that serve those alliances?!? 
---
So easy to ask for a fight when you know you will win and pretend you want “fun”.  You comment is fine and all... if it came from a position of weakness, to inspire others to jump their ships on a hopeless battle, defeat assured, but that might be fun. But nope, you whine that people not suiciding their fleets on your super blob of doom.
---
If Panfan wants to gank idiots in Delve, and they think thats fun with the supercap unbrella offline, then why you care?
---
Just pixels, right? Just play along it. Any of this wont matter once you log off, of course. :D
---
DISALLOW Cynos in lowsec.

TIL Eve Online has a discord server. Sounds as bad as I would imagine Jita local having discord would be.

Does being alpha not allow me to see any of my stuff

it did?

Consider this war a preemptive strike from goons. In the end of the day, you don't need a reason to start a war. you just start it.
---
You could try -legasp- exploring inside wormholes. C2's with 2 ghost sites and 7-12 unran relic/data sites are pretty common.
---
Looking at any Thorax or Apocalypse hull does it for me.
---
Do you know da wae?
---
Kick ass IRL so we can keep kicking ur ass in-game!
---
Seriously hope all is going well!
---
That is 100% incorrect. Sort was the only one to sue for peace and he even paid for his allies for 1 month. The others just bitched afterwards.
---
Just make first tier pay 0. No isk invested no return.
---
Goons don't have to be good, just outlive the opponents. They did this quite well.
---
I misread this and thought you said Wow was the first MMO.
---
Does that make Dirk Macgurk your grandfather?

This mother fucker right here.  One of the greatest eve videos ive ever seen!!  Sorry ccp but you just got whaled!!!  My vote goes to you man.

I’m sorry to hear about your medical problems.

I hope it all works out well for you. Keep doing whatever it is you need to do to kick this thing.

"PL dreadbombs" never stopped working, ppl just lost interest in actually doing the required prepwork.

Very inspiring video, keep up the good work.
---
TBH, EVE Discord is cancer.
---
On the other hand, yes, gtfo.
---
Oh please, the month was so it doesn't looks like a total shit deal.
---
Goons and everyone would need a month anyway to shift fronts if required.
---
&gt; Fix it so that there is no "Name" column in the overview and you'd almost instantly solve the issue of head-shotting and the need for Monitors.
---
You can always zoom in on the enemy blob and see who the anchor is.
---
Honestly how many skill points in total do you have? Might be wise to get a friend invite and get a free 750k skill points to boost you
---
prolley
---
So is a c2 with a bunch of cloakies camping it. Not going to risk asteros with half a bil in cargo to chance like that, and I don’t want to be heading to hisec to stash loot every 30 minutes
---
There's been a mod that ported the models into gmod for years, but it's old so no new Tristan or Tempest or anything like that.
---
Once? I'm sure he did it more than that
---
Full jump cloak timer or riot.
---
Why not fly a ship to highsec, then? It'll give you a reason to declare wars over there as well :)
---
There is a seat for every butt.
---
I forgot that private citizens owned multiple aircraft carriers and thermonuclear warheads.
---
You could join a more pvp focused alliance but remain blue with your old Corp, and just have them use a channel that you’re allowed in for chat instead of the default Corp channel. If it’s one like PH or Brave they won’t care too much that you spend some time with a random Corp.
---
Thank you very much and sorry I didn’t answer sooner :D I confirm that with a ticket and some screeshots, I got the two repackages skins within a day
---
This is incredible.  So many of the play styles I attempt are met with the "oh you used to be able to do that" replies from the Eve vets I know.  I am starting to look for another game to play at this point but this lit a little fire in me.  Keep up the good work, you have another supporter.
---
Can you do that with existing characters
---
But that makes a worm hole less safe how is that bad?
---
Best eve video Ive seen years. Your flair should say mad scientist! Captivating! You are doing Bob's work. All my votes for you!
---
MULTI-BELT DRIFTING!!
---
This faction warfare sounds cool until you realize you will lose about 10x more ships then you can win as most fights will be 2+vs1
---
&gt; how do you expect racism to attract new players?
---
You can just leave instead of crying this much, you know? You don't have the skin to handle EVE, and that's fine, lmao.
---
So TEST care about you spending time with a random corp okey lol.
---
They are still unidentified, you just know which system has the anoms in.
---
oh my god he's a parent
---
looks like rule #1 is working
---
?
---
Good job and an awesome and very well made Video...the propaganda aint bad either !
---
Best of luck
---
You're an idiot.
---
That's an inspirational story bro -  respect for mastering your playstyle and making your own path in this game.
---
This is by far the most incredible video I've watched in a long time - rivaling that of the epic RnK videos.  
---
You have my vote !  
---
Hopefully people like you stick with the game and help battle the stagnation.
---
10/10
---
they are not thinking.
---
DD that bitch ass cancer!
---
Literally thought this was real until the gif at the bottom.
---
I had a lot of fun flying the dual rep Incursus, with meta guns, even. Check for fits in zkill. I can't link one at the moment, but I hope you check that out.
---
Who’s stain guy? 🤔
---
AGREEED
---
AHAHAHAHA
---
yes, they are
---
You mean you don't?
---
Spectre Fleet or The Beehive
---
lol you brag about coming back after everyone leaves and killing a structure. sad.
---
Can I have some of what your smokin?
---
No worries, glad to see it worked out.
---
Definitely sound possible. There have been other weird things along similar lines such as logging in to find shield damage of an offline mod as well, though those have been around for a while. CCP seems to be stepping up there game though, introducing new bugs before patch day even arrives.
---
Defenders decided it was easier to go whaling instead, leaving the structures to die. It was a pitiful and thoroughly disappointing sight to behold for all those looking for content.
---
It shouldn't. What stuff in particular are you unable to see?
---
I can't understand why they left  40B structure for us 
---
tyty
---
A structure worth more than your entire alliance has killed this month...
---
That depends on the corp. I've seen groups that are any where from same-day if they are piratically fast, to over a month if they are slow or lack recruiters. Waiting several days is normal if they do any kind of background check, but if it's been close to a month you may want to contact a recruiter as something may have gone wrong.
---
Lol, whatever man. Not even gonna bother because you couldn't even be civil from the get-go. It's like you likely you have reading comprehension issues or something. 
---
Your entire comment could be summed up with the typical, autistic "grr goons hat goons"
---
I miss my Panther. :(
---
&gt; Wouldn't it be great if Eve combat actually required you to aim
---
no
---
&gt; or dodge?
---
that's what booshing is and people complain about it
---
&gt; And if the Triglavians actually invaded space that people might care about and took the fight to over-entrenched player groups?
---
also when the triglavians kill u in game u die in real life
---
I'll flood it with downvotes until they decide to rework the current agency system that reveals the anomalies in every system in k-space.
---
took me a minute too, car games are crazy
---
&gt;Added the Board My Corvette button; Corvettes will no longer be made available automatically on docking in a pod, instead the player can choose to be placed inside a corvette using this button.
---
BEST. UPDATE. EVER!
---
Act on what you preach then if you want civility as it seems you can dish it out, but just cant take it.
---
And this has nothing to with Goons, just you. Goons doing what they have to do, for this game always had superpowers. Today is the Goons, tomorrow will be someone else. The way of pewpew, the circle of life, whatever. But your entire comment could be summed up with the typical “I want fun at your expense, and I whine because you not engaging on my terms” entitlement.
---
This makes me sad.
---
You forgot: "fighting all of eve"
---
So you recently discovered Internet huh
---
Dino brains:
---
"FRT should do something about botting"
---
asked what TEST would do about botting?
---
"What FRT would do"
---
That looks quite nice...
---
Getting the subs in for the CSM votes. 
---
Dont see any other reason to start the war now, could have been at any time, same outcome.
---
isnt Eso closer from Delve?
---
Wonderful video! You did a great job story telling and articulating your point.
---
Idk but i See only 1 super
---
Sorry kid, Eve is for 18 and up.
---
It's not even a challenge since he started on a max skilled alpha char and not a new account. It would have been months of slow training to fly one of the battleships let alone two of them.
---
Excellent!
---
You are already a god but are you ready to be a king?
---
dont cry like a baby
---
This was the most invigorating eve video I've seen in ages. As a mostly burnt out small/medium gang and former tourney pilot, you'll get more votes from me than I was planning to give anyone this year. Even though our play styles are drastically different, I trust you to represent the heart behind what I value in this game more than any null bloc rep could. 
---
Thanks for offering to throw yourself at CCP's whim.
---
I wish you all the best and hope you win the fight.
---
people make fun of you, not laugh at the post.
---
CCP is thinking that if they dumb down the game enough they'll get the WoW crowd.
---
&gt;That’s EVE. You don’t play it safe, you go find yourself some trouble and kick as much ass as you can along the way.
---
People would rather just not die and not spend another 3 hours grinding isk to fly again.
---
Jesus dude, this literally is a list of things to make the game way more tedious.
---
Pog this is some golden era of eve quality
---
I had multiple ships gone had a industrial base on a planet gone skills gone
---
Wait until you see reddit
---
Fun for you, unfun for the people on the other side cause they'll suffer a crushing defeat because of your superior numbers.
---
Glad we finally got a fight
---
Wow dude, best video ever since RnK videos - never voted but I guess you have my vote
---
GREAT STUFF !
---
Long time no see quality video like this.
---
Ez pz, just make plex more expensive in real currencies after each big fight
---
This video is the best I've seen since rooks and kings vids. Keep it up Olmeca!  
---
A tip since you're using RnK vids as inspiration, in your "cinematic" vids, make sure you get them as high res as possible, (RnK vids were great at filming everything with top gfx, hard to do when you're multiboxing, but in the cinematic parts you can!
---
"Why do I even play with you guys?"
---
Most realistic line ever
---
Why am I not surprised? Good job CCP, good job.
---
Who?
---
LOL at the irony when talking about good fights at the end of the video when, untill that point, it was only about ganking.
---
But at least i managed to watch it all so that's an upvote
---
&gt; Woe to you, oh earth and sea
---
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
---
Because he knows the time is short
---
6x Accounts here voting for you
---
What nationality is Shadoo? Russian? Spanish? I really can't tell
---
ah gotcha, thanks.
---
I ve never been into whaling. It always seemed to autistic to me but this video made me wanna try it.
---
" Lipstick now applies consistently over facial augmentations that change the color of a lip "
---
Now this is a reason to play the game right here. Tell your friends, this was everything the whole world was waiting for before joining EVE.
---
Click click click
---
Keep up the fight!
---
Can’t wait till another smart update in EvE ❤️

---
It is obviously on a progress path....
---
As long as there is a low sec station to hide in there will always be pl. Although I once thought the same of co2 and they decide to become hands off in the game.
---
Yeah to me this just sounds like wormhole daytripping :S
---
Considered trying out the game so you joined the discord instead of making an alpha account and actually trying out the game.... makes perfect sense. go fuck off m8
---
It's very possible to do what he does with friends, but it requires everyone knowing what to do and being online at the same time. Small groups do this across Delve (and iirc Esoteria sometimes too?) but Olmeca's perfected it as a single player.
---
Most of the wormholers on praise bob are voting for Mort (if ccp fixes him being on the ballet) Stitch and company
---
NC refusing to undock, hide in low sec, and trade all their goods says more about them than anything the goons could do.
---
This is the first time ever I will vote..
---
I am 70% sure this is how it happen, I would be more certain but my gut struggles to believe they ever log in and play.
---
Looks like PH is recruiting all corps of the fallen/dying alliances in the north
---
So your judging an entire community on the comments of the few? Congrats, we don't want you
---
its only gay if your ball touch
---
There mist be like 5 people total in the game who still do that, camp a relic for hours and have no life.
---
This is a retarded change for explorers mostly. Perfect, instant information in any aspect (exploration, sov warfare) is what is killing this game and the amount of logged users and Zkill prove it.
---
RiP Eve if no drastic measures are taken and retards proposing that are fired.
---
i know i would...
---
Irony, some of us understand it, some don't...
---
So that's why they said hull tanking was for real men! Those Fedos were hiding under the POS hull all along! :O
---
\#nopoors
---
You can analyse the server records, like he completed an abyssal, he was market trading, etc. you don't need humans looking at the data line by line. 
---
Then you can easily correlate activities with the satisfaction score of the day.
---
Win that fight!
---
As is often the case, that mechanic giving you the edge sounds lovely in theory -- until you're forced to do it in order to be competitive with everyone else :(
---
Who ?
---
Learn to read mate, I've never said it will have docking capability, just anticap weapons... One does not help proliferation, the other does, I hope you understand the difference... If not why do you even play this game?
---
This lore story about the first capsuleer covers it
---
https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/short-stories/the-jovian-wet-grave/
---
"As you know there is no sound in space, but when we were developing the capsules we found that people wanted to use as many of their senses as possible, thus we added the sound. By letting a computer create three dimensional sound we also add to the awareness you have while in battles, for instance."
---
I'm assuming that you are a returning player? IF so it could be that you are in a different station from you ships, try checking you assets window. As far as your skills, you may be filtering your skills such that some of them aren't appearing. The other possibility is that your account was hacked, and you were drained to between 5 - 5.5 mil SP, and your assets were stolen. You can submit a ticket with CCP if that is the case, but getting everything back will be slow going.
---
I don't mind the duration of the module, but a flight of EC-300 getting lucky was just too overpowered
---
I would redo how I-hubs are fit. 
---
Make it more like citadels as far as you get slots. And have to maintain some form of fitting resource.
---
Mining, ratting and/or Intel could compete for the same slot. You could have mucho rats, but you can't know if a hunter's logged in/wh group has rolled into you. 
---
Go all the way, and then give you tools and force meaningful choices that could be rewarding, or could be dangerous. 
---
But I don't play anymore so w/e.
---
When i got to nullsec from wh i used to fly around for a while looking for relic/data sites. Now i'll open agency, see nothing around and won't even bother risking meeting someone. So less content for everyone, and safer for me.
---
You mean Spod's work.  I build and sell those ships.
---
This is a more accurate depiction of eve coms
---
https://pics.me.me/in-space-no-one-can-hear-you-scream-reynolds-turn-30166244.png
---
it's funny how you think it's so easy to hunt bots... no bot is on all the time. they take shifts, they have built in irregularities to mimik player behavior etc.
---
botters are not stupid. and so isn't ccp. it's just a cat and mouse game
---
please do when they invade they give de-duffs to the area and one big buff they affect mining cycles so we would be mining more so please send them all you like KRAB KRAB KRAB
---
Honestly the idea would be it would literally do that automatically, and hit other parts of space (maybe multiples at once). If a group were totally unable to do anything about it, it would burn an area down but then not return for X time or something. Fight citadel spam, fight against people blobbing and forming super safe hotspots in the game. Create it so it can scale up and actually fight and kill titans/supers.
---
Remove all killmails.
---
Only the most cancerous players would quit the game if killmails were removed.
---
they could, but it still would be hard to followup.
---
if they introduced that sort of feedback ability, there would be ppl complaining that ccp ignores their feedback. so, there is actually a drawback to give more options like that
---
there incursions 2.0 with the start of FW rework with the AI tech they have for this
---
I wouldn't think you were an autistic weirdo if you hadn't used "surprise buttsex."
---
Blackwater USA.
---
They are and will be top dog in north. PL is dead, NC will be soon ^(imagine how many members will quit when they understand that they are not in 1st league any more)
---
He didn't exclude Brand :/
---
Old PL Corp
---
This! Whenever I run incursions I mash that recall hotkey at the end of a site. Some use shift+R, I use O myself, but it's a handy one to have.
---
You mean, those bad guys who disturb your 23/7 krabbing?
---
Had no idea AAA were still together
---
If you don't actually play your game and think this would hold newbros' hands (that you need badly, since veterans are already quitting), maybe you would come up with something desperate and stupid like that.
---
you spelled internet wrong
---
Spot on. Somebody they recruited recently as backfill. Or just some new tram lead, that has equally zero understanding of the game.
---
Delve have way more neutral roaming there than for say bot space (you know this renter alliance who belong to ncpl and end up in some data ?) 
---
So you mean neutral who barely roam in bot space report more bot than neutral who roam in delve?
---
but you see, muh farming pve empire wont succeed without being able to avoid 100% of pvp interaction as long as you're at your keyboard!
---
Well we don't call it taxes when it comes to renter but yeah you got the idea why that top 25 was fill with anti-goons renter group
---
I remember the days when they made you shit bricks as they spike in local, now all 3 of them remaining join Horde.
---
That she needs to have that many accounts just to snipe a kill under an umbrella is the sadder part of the game, but you do you.
---
Great vid, props to your skills. You have my vote, Sir
---
That's some flat earth society level of denial here
---
it seems like most people complaining about this have not went in to sisi to test or see for them self... for cosmic annoms it shows that there is something there. not what it is. so it could be relic/data/DED/wormhole. there is no filter by wormhole feature. it give a direction to go so your not going in a direction for 10 jumps only to find nothing. helps speed up content and keep people playing. and not wasting an hour or there only hour that day to find something that was never there.  Im for this feature. it will allow me to go do more with my time instead of wasting it going in the wrong direction.
---
replay why this is a bad feature not: my nostalga or Back in my day
---
this literally just makes getting to content faster. ya there will be the one group with a dedicated comic sig scanner but those already exist in groups just now they know were to go.
---
Joining the ranks of other mega active corps like Bat Country I see.
---
I'm glad I left goons before they start having the same culture as ph
---
Well I'm not 14 anymore to laugh at this kind of coms
---
Watching the difference of alliance pilots from later years compared to this year hit real hard knowing that those alliances we once fought will no longer be able to fight back. Seeing those goons number just makes me feel a little sad NGL. Great video, amazing job at describing the current state of Eve and its issues.  You've got my vote o7
---
I haven't played in a while, what do you mean valuing game skills &gt; metagame skills? Is fitting the ship metagaming? Or do you mean joining the "right" alliance?
---
only if you actually go there, NCdocked seems dead set on avoiding fights so why would they go to a region where the players are willing to drop titans and super caps when they have neither?
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/2014367342/ such an active corporation will surely bolster the ranks of pandemic horde
---
SJW's are the real problem with the world. A generation of coddled spoiled self entitled asshats. Your Virtue Signaling will impress no weak minded women here. Go back to your therapist and let them know the internet was mean to you.
---
The best answer to this is the best time to play eve is after a year of subscribing and Skilling up.
---
Best wishes and fight a good fight!
---
I agree 100% with /u/Jintaan . Ping me when features are formally announced for an upcoming expansion. Before that point, talk is cheap. CCP has recognized the core problems with EVE for years.
---
After listening to Hilmar in this video in comparison to what you said regarding how out of touch he seemed, I almost feel like maybe he got talking points from someone to placate the masses at this get together. I want to believe he is sincere, but everything you said pointed to the exact opposite.
---
the active members of busa were rolled into snigg and the corp was ejected from the alliance
---
once it was out, it was taken over with a share vote by a former member who'd left to join insu
---
busa joining phorde is not a story about a corp seeing that pl is garbage (you smoothbrain), it's a story about how eve's mechanics are dumb sometimes
---
When i was new-ish i regularly took my astero, went to the nearest thera entrance, picked an exit far away and tried to make some ISK.
---
Teching me how to dodge gatecamps, watch d-scan, and not getting murderd by other asteros.
---
So is your formating.
---
upvoted, I realy enjoyed the video
---
&gt; built in irregularities to mimik player behavior
---
they COULD have, but 99% of the bots in eve dont!
---
most of the bots are just orbiting hubs 24/7 initiating warp the second a neut appears in local. resetting/warping to sites after x amount of time when local is clear..
---
shouldnt be to hard to filter out stuff like that.
---
On a cosmological scale, yes. In the mean time, space is big, and very empty.
---
alteast he acknowledged the game is stagnated...phew glad we got that threw atleast
---
WoW was the first MMO
---
The point is to encourage encounters. This is helping pvpers and player interaction. You all cry that eve is stagnant and boring then shoot down any idea that adds chaos. Gg
---
The amount of response fleet looks like he was afk more than half the ordeal
---
Ships always provided friend :D
---
YUP seems legit!
---
How do you expect us to attract new racist players? They have just as much right to play Eve as anyone else! Hell, maybe they have more of a right to play it seeing as they are always discriminated against just because of their personal opinion!
---
wow blackwater is still hanging around
---
Sad
---
once it was out of the alliance, it was taken over with a share vote by a former member who'd left to join insu, and filled up mainly with insu members to join bl
---
busa joining phorde is not a story about a corp seeing that pl is garbage (no matter how much you want that to be the case), it's a story about how eve's mechanics are dumb sometimes..
---
Parts are correct. Dexter was founding CEO of BUSA then left to form INSU that joined MC then BL, both where great to be part of and have a great deal of respect for both alliances. Once Snigg took most of the active pilots Dexter took back control and INSU formed into BUSA, and now BUSA has taken the next step to find content because that's what EVE is about and we look forward to a great time in our new home.
---
I dont think these people are paying for their titans with Plex
---
I don’t get it
---
Thanks for making this and playing the game Olmeca! +1
---
Burn jita again everyday until they change back
---
Guys, english is not my primary language, but "play" has a lot of meanings even in real life. You can hear it a lot when listening to the recording of soldiers comms during gun fight, so its not necessary an immersion breaking.
---
It is Mittens looking out for the health of his little bees. (Insert song into your brain on repeat) He is trying his best to save them from spending too much time outside in the hot, skin burning sun.
---
It would be cool if they basically functioned like the Antarans in Master of Orion 2
---
Put a nos in a high slot and focus the webs / neuts first, depending if your hp or cap is dying faster
---
With a new server we'd be back here in 2 years. 
---
There needs to be a reason to not use titans and supers, and Rorquals are too safe. 
---
There needs to be a reason for people to fight in small and large skirmishes.
---
Loads of ideas have been suggested, and honestly none knows which ones will work.
---
we have never undocked a fleet that large but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess
---
&gt;im moving to a 128GB platform shortly for other applications. use all the memory you want.
---
God bless PC gaming.
---
And /r/Eve posters are its war criminals
---
&gt;PL is dead
---
you can repeat whatever stories you want to yourself but we are more active by basically any metric that's available.
---
But since you're just hedliner's shitposting alt you already know that.
---
&gt; "Legacy drop 20 citadels in detorid"

Is that it? Real small fry numbers there.

Primary the shit out of that cancer, friend. News of a spacebro getting better will never be TMI.

See you when you get your next rorq
---
&gt;10 years ago was 2009
---
Oh god that feels like yesterday.
---
Similar story, fairly casual for the past 10 years. Someday I'll push into null to see more :)
---
fight the good fight my dude.
---
If you are going to call someone else's play style disgusting and damaging you should not be surprised when they return the sentiment in kind.
---
What are you talking about he's perfect for EVE!
---
As u/LegbeardCatfood already asked that question. As far as I am concerned you are not able to use POCOS as an Alpha, therefore maintaining PI is not possibile. Besides, dropping to Alpha will block all skills regarding.
---
"I'm tired of getting non blingy marauder kills so don't fly them unless you bling them for me to kill."

You are basicly saying "How can I make money without working?", if it were so easy, we'd all be trilionaires \^\^. 
---
Getting to a point where you can make a lot of ISK reliably requires an investment at first. Incursions can be a great way to start, but you'll need to invest into a fairly expensive Battleship at first. Reaching that point, you could try getting into exploration or DED Site running (even in HiSec), which can be done on a small scale even with low skills.
---
Haha stupid idiots killing ships in Delve just makes us more money 
---
That’s what you sound like
---
Imagine my surprise when a BUSA dude was spotted in local this morning
---
Faggots basically
---
IRacing.com
---
You basicly answered your own question in several different ways. All of these are viable. 2-3 Logis can be ECMed fairly easy, even with something like a Griffin. As it is a rather small cap chain between guardians you should have success with that.   
---
For neuts you would require a lot of neuting power, as the guardians capchain, or with other wors fill the other Guardians cap up constantly. Switching it off completely is possibile though.  
---
For the Alpha Strat, I am not completely sure if it'll work.
---
All biggest battles was from an error
---
From the outside it looked like they fed two or three dreadbombs and couldn't take down a titan with them due to fax proliferation.
---
Yeah you can. Invite yourself on a different email address. Might not even need to be different but thats how i did it. Link below:
---
https://www.eveonline.com/recruit
---
And if the new account is upgrade to omega the original account gets given 350 plex which you can use any way you want on either account.
---
" The Mittani Was Right About it for Once. " you heard it here first folks.
---
This is terrible for the few people (because CCP shafted that incomesource hard) who still dive into hostile nullsec to run sites, combat or hacking. Previously you had the benefit of travelers not knowing what you were doing in their space. Now they instantly see "oh there are two combat anoms, he is clearing them"
---
Most other Triglavian ships are still really strong, especially against anything that has a lot of hp (caps + structures).
---
 Combat Anomalies, Ore Anomalies, and Ice Belts show the exact type of site from within 1 jump away.  
---
I'm reading this as meaning it WONT show the sig type if you are 1 jump out because sigs aren't anomalies. Can you explain what you mean?
---
It definitely helps to have a covops with the appropriate rigs and mods to speed up the process. Anecdotally I spent like 2h probing down about 30 sigs on an alpha in a t1 frigate, but something like a third of that (40m) in my Omega with astro 5.
---
My first reaction was: Meh 27 minutes, ain't nobody got time for that. But then again I was expecting something more dubstep heavy. My reaction 27 minutes later: Awesome video! Great story, good editing, good narration. 27 minutes well spent.
---
Lets make EVE dangerous again!
---
You got my vote right there
---
l love Yumens streams
---
Could've done that before that as well..
---
Hi! Thank you for your comment! o/o/
---
I went for a corp interview yesterday. First question asked on open Comms:
---
You've been in a car accident, your cock as chopped off but doc can give you a new one. You have the choice between a 2 inch white one or a 9 inch black one. Which do you chose? And why?
---
I immediately knew I had found the right corp. 
---
Sorry buddy, you need a thick skin to play this game or you will be eaten alive and triggered by 99% of the game. Whether it be being scammed, shit talk in local or Comms or non consensual PVP you probably won't like it. 
---
O7
---
that just means the corp died in PL, just like NESW, BAT, N0X, VERA, SAS... etc
---
Ok now I wanna see a black hole in the style of Earth-chan.
---
Not to mention local.
---
I have thoroughly enjoyed watching your vid. Thank you very much for your time.
---
You were not on my CSM radar but its become abundantly clear that you have a feel for what is needed to make EVE risky/scary again. Have you seen that clip from the Down Under AMA where Hilmar expressed his wish to make Eve scary again?
---
If you get in the room I know you will push for that.
---
Think I get 2-3 CSM votes. You, Stitch and Insidious are on my list.
---
Hah, i love the sweet smell of double standards and hypocrisy in the morning.
---
I did see the clip. And that's one of the reasons I wanna be on this particular CSM. If they want to make Eve dangerous again my input should be valuable.
---
I think its best thing to happen to explo since integrated analzyers.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/238510404/
---
hey they have an active ishtar ratter at least
---
not at 2x speed and while being subject to sp limit

Nothing of value was lost.

Why hardpoints if you fit smartbombs? I dont get that

Next week a new sheriff is in deteroid,, dino

Stain is better than Delve!

Realistically if our enemies decided to curb stomp us when we relocated to Delve in the first place and killed us off before me got established it would of been a totally different landscape right now. This is all NC/PL's fault pretty much
---
We also have a few hundred in Delve and still enroute to the war front
---
95% rather \o/
---
yeah kinda my idea, it not out fault we grow while every one else did not, they have access to the same things they just did not focus on growing  pushing industry to the side to be " elite pvp's"  with out the industry  to back it up.  
---
look at provi block there been around for age's but because they are content to not grow there not much off a threat, but they are good fighter's
---
Can you explain the difference between actually being retarded and just saying retarded things for attention from strangers on the internet?
---
From over here, I can't spot it.
---
LOL it's EVE all corp's and Alliance's come and go,  people burn out or just go play under another pilot to enjoy another part of the game. I've been playing off and on since 2005 and have watched ASCN and BOB die with a lot of alliance's that always reform into other power house's like NC,PL,Goons, and TAPI. EVE is always about the friend's and connections you make to make your game fun.
---
&gt;Exploration window gives megakrabs the option of perfect Intel regarding dangerous wormholes, pointing towards systems with sigs that are potential WHs
---
So I actually have a lot of experience on this subject and I don't think this change actually effects wormhole raiders.
---
Yes, major groups like goons etc will have new sigs logged in sort of system, but people are caught not through floating randomly moving sigs (i mean they are but) the big kills are either planned ops (ala HK) or through rolling holes and SPEED ala Volta/Inner Hell/K162.
---
This new sig system is not going to stop a hole being rolled and 30 sabres sitting on it spamming in every direction. You're ontop of a target in seconds.
---
Local needs to get smothered with a pillow IMHO to fix all of these problems. We need to rip the bandaid off.
---
no it didnt. 
---
the camera moved up to fade in the triglavian titan.
---
thats definitely not opening a rift and following the garmur
---
Good luck Sir!
---
P.s. link the vid in ur empty trolololol CSM Google doc :-)
---
Best campaign video ever!
---
CCP needs to get some sort of referral partnership with g.skill asap
---
I thought the point of all the titans was to look like giant space-dicks.
---
#8 should be #1 tbf
---
*Make an alt, join horde, ping and die to goons.
---
If OP’s information checks out I support his position.
---
If everybody knows what’s going on in the client without even being logged in then we have a problem.
---
I fully support giving the players the opportunity to royally screw the pooch because they made a mistake or because they did not have all the information they would have needed to avoid it. They should be able to gather that information, assuming being logged in and having more eyes to scout out the situation. No problem there, so long as you have enough guys to do the work and you have to be logged in.
---
Null and K space being dangerous is entirely the fucking point.
---
If you can’t stand running the risk of going “Um... yeah, I didn’t mean to start a 5000 ship fight, but since you’re all here anyway...” then you have to do something else.
---
I have been inspired, and I’ll keep repeating it, by Judge Sarn. He goes out with his itty bitty frigate, he drops a drag bubble on a Goon star gate and he waits for guys to come challenge him for it. 3 Goons got popped, and one pod.
---
That’s doing it right.
---
The principle should be very easy and simple to understand:
---
**IF YOU WANT THE THING, YOU HAVE TO WANT TO FIGHT FOR THE THING**
---
If you can’t be bothered to log in to see whether your effort is paying off, why should anyone indulge you by allowing you to avoid risk.
---
If you want to avoid risk, go play WoW. The music is nice, the quests are simple and you can ignore the screaming children.
---
This is EVE Online, if you grab it and you can get away with it, it’s yours. If you get your boat shot out from under you: get a fucking new one and carry on.
---
&gt; What is missing is drive for conflict and motivation for "nomadic playstyle", similar to PL in the past
---
You can't have that when you have blob mechanics that allow one side to have 2000 capitals and supercapitals deployed wherever they want in the cluster. There is simply no way to fight that.
---
Sounds like you might not have the reich attitude for Eve Online.
---
Well, I accidentally heard it from him, while the Boat wasn't shouting like deaf, on their Metashow.
---
Correct me if he didn't say it first
---
A player, showing inocal has to be delayed for as long as they hold cloak. Period
---
I will check partisans out! Thank you!

---
You know when I first started playing, I hated that there were Killmails in the game. I'm with you, rip out local, rip out kill mails. At least for a month and see what happens.
---
By far the biggest content killer for roaming PVP are supers teleporting 20 jumps to a cyno. Local is nothing compared to that, by itself any change to it won't generate any real content. Maybe a few more botter ganks, but that's it.
---
I already play EVE in a 64-bit wineprefix, so for sure i will opt-in to the 64-bit client :)
---
what the reson behind this CCP?u gone full retard or what?
---
not really it makes it more of the biggest batphone wins scenario, also how does it make them less safe? 
---
o wait you don't know hole mechanics no you can still get a k-space static in a state where it's closed that's a non-issue, the issue is you can no longer get to an asymmetric entry known scenario because as soon as you jump I known the sig that just appeared is the new k-space.
---
There could be ways. Its not like you can't produce mechanics that aren't allowing disruption of such forces.
---
Until then, the "other side" could have just worked together to assemble similar forces. Instead the north drove itself into conflicts.
---
Legend has it he still didn't return that Chimera.
---
I’d certainly be up for a reduction in jump range. But I also think that many people need to realize that for these groups they just pull back and roll back. That’s their whole gig. I think the problem is that many of you think that the game is trying to beat nullsec At their own game. You have to play around that.
---
Hit-and-run, black ops, fast-moving fleets, dread bombs, Bummer wings, slippery Pete’s, spearfishing, etc.
---
Better to die a hero, than die as a goon
---
I think a much more compelling and interesting change would be making it so that people entering the system through worm holes do not show up in local. If you go through gate, you show in local
---
gentleman's club represent
---
If your dick looks like an Erebus, seek medical attention immediately
---
So no promotion but it's a sanctuary for racists, nice very cool and exciting
---
No i didnt.. and that is what is saddest of all
---
you obviously dont hold sov and i can guarantee, you have not been in a bloc scale sov battle . It is litreally aids fighting for nodes with out without intel .
---
number of alts per player haven't really gone up that far though.
---
Your comment confuses me? Are you asking if i know about 3 man frig sites? If so yes.. yes i do i may or may not run a giant community devoted solely to doing abysal pve. I also ran a null incursion community with the OP and others for a good while. Thats part of why ccps trailer disappointed me so much
---
How is that obvious while I spent at least 3 years in sov space and participating in sov 'wars'?
---
Fozzie just have to unfuck the retarded sov system he created, but that's another topic?
---
Thats fair...
---
You can do a launch through your command centre but it must be piped into your system, can only launch a limited amount (IIRC a few thousand m3 max?), and has a lengthy cooldown (something like 18-24 hours I think?). So TL;DR yes it's possible to export without a customs office but it's a tedious PITA.
---
Amazing video. My new and modern Eve hero Olmeca\_Gold. You have  my vote.
---
I don't want a reduction in jump range, I want 3-4 unsupported alts in supers to not be the standard solution to every problem in null. It's completely screwed up balance on small to medium scales. The fact that all but one of the comps you suggested are designed around running away efficiently says a lot about the state of nullsec PVP at the moment.
---
If you have stairs in your house.
---
Not sure if woosh
---
imagine being this triggered, show me your killmail
---
Because you think intel is the problem . INTEL is not issue with sov or structures . getting notifications of who or what attacked you system or sov is a basic feature. Any fucking game(world of tanks or warcraft) you base is attacked you get notification who attacked it and when and with what size of a force . If EVE does not have it the company will be burned the next day . It is the time given to defenders to prepare after your first attack . you need to go through multiple timers , sov battles by the end of it you dont even know why you started the fight . I will not respond more to you because u have fucking 0 idea of the mechanics or the problems with it . Just a 5 yr old spergging on reddit
---
Well, given the context of my initial response in my reply I’m talking about small numbers of wormholers trying to take on large numbers of no bears, of course the whole fight is going to be about taking as many kills us we can using surprise and tactics before withdrawing from the fight.
---
You’re making my point, the whole point of my initial reply to you was that people need to stop thinking that the game coming out of wormholes is about trying to take on nullsec at their own game.
---
There is positively absolutely and completely no way for me to take 30 people out of a c2 and do anything other than “ running away efficiently”.
---
def r/woosh
---
This is why a lot of corporations/alliances have an interview process to join. We screen personalities and avoid bringing in toxic people.
---
Eve is 95% awful and 5% awesome. Now you want to make the awful worse. No thanks.
---
I don't think the size is the problem, but the difference (or lack thereof) in value that is a problem.
---
PART of the problem. Even if they unfuck citadels and sov in some miraculous way, the problem of perfect information will persist and deny access to interesting events.
---
Isn't it? It is much better than EVE.
---
It would benefit the game overall because so much of the game is completely dead right now.
---
But it is pretty much impossible to do without royally pissing someone off and would require a huge time effort to do (rearranging gates, resources and what have you).
---
I'd disagree. There are countless systems across nullsec alone that simply aren't used.
---
Lowsec similarly has systems where maybe 1 person parks a character and that's it.
---
OP you are the piece of shit in this situation.
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
sure about woosh
---
I agree, I think if you reduced the space it would encourage more blue not less because your only option would be fight constantly, which no one wants, or blue and be even more safe.
---
I would argue we need more space, not less.
---
Yeap it’s a woosh
---
Is that 50% increase a constant increase, or a 50% increase to the minimum memory usage?
---
If I login to a character and use, say, 500 MB memory in the 32bit client, that'll increase to about 750 MB in the 64bit client I assume... But will it also increase the memory usage in a fleet fight from, say, 3 GB in the 32bit client to 4,5 GB for the same fleet fight in the 64bit client, or does the increase get less and less intense as usage goes up?
---
why is the dude getting downvoted? No kinkshaming pls.
---
This is a great video showing the plight of Eve. I've not logged on for a couple of years now but its great to see someone still fighting against it, both in game and out.
---
smh lol
---
Why
---
Very nice dude. Thanks for more even inspiration - I now have even more incentive to make a video of mine proving that [DED runner hunting is not dead (yet), and can even be done solo](https://zkillboard.com/character/94888963/ship/22430/year/2019/month/5/). Also good luck, you have my vote.
---
This sub is full of Drama queens that bandwagon with the first person that says "OMG bad feature, it will kill the game omgwtfbbq" 
---
Literally unreadable, I'm unsubscribing.
---
TL;DR if you have the the skills to fly a ship trained, but not the prerequisites for those skills, you can still fly the ship.  If you have a skill trained to level 1, but you don't have one of the prerequisites for that skill, you can still train it to higher levels.
---
WH gameplay mechanics are fantastic for wormholes because at any time each wormhole in New Eden probably has on average 1/10th of a person in it. Then you can feel good about finding that tenth of a person on dscan hunting him down and getting away.  
---
For null with dozens of people in populated systems at a time using dscan to get info if you're the defenders is nearly worthless. As you said yourself roamers and wormholers still get plenty of kills. Sigs popping up on some newbie-oriented interface is not an issue and neither is local.
---
Is that why NC unanchored and vacated their territory? Becuase of their disposable ships and our reputation?
---
Please we all know these am signs of from our lord and master The Mitta ... Cthulhu ;P
---
Current system is far from being perfect information, though, especially the whole entosis stuff.
---
What kind of "interesting event" would happen if you were to not receive a notification? All you'd get is an entosis contest 2 days after having spent 15-60 minutes being afk on an ihub.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6uce93/init_drops_haw_titans_on_nc_tc_sc_mc/
---
Man you guys are dense as a fucking brickwall lmao
---
It should be a mother ship, allows sub caps to dock, it can move and jump at normal cap jump ranges, it can warp to locations in system providing the destination is at least 1 au away, it should have massive anti capital capability but should be lame against sub caps.
---
The vital important thing about this is that it cannot dock, or tether itself, its a mothership so only 1 is allowed per Alliance, before an Alliance can even build it they need to meet some criteria like have a minimum of x total active members and possibly some other criteria so we can rule out people making fake alliances to get one.
---
Their purpose would be acting as a mobile forward operating base for invasions of space, you would jump them into the target system and then you have an instant fob, since its a ship and not a station it should have a shield timer like a mobile depo, so only 2 days not a week.
---
Having something like this could help with the proliferation of structures, their easier to kill if you defeat their supporting fleet, and at the end of a war or invasion the thing goes home and does not just leave stations all over the place.
---
You can be notified 5 minutes after someone has started toasting. Even if you are not logged. There is no way to surprise a large alliance with ninja toasting and timers creation.
---
Downvoting the fact that EVE is ptw now🤦🏻‍♂️. Miss the good ol' days.
---
I too cannot find the logic behind this change. Can anyone help with my confusion.
---
Just those numbers won't mean anything. AOM is growing fast and KWG will lose members anyway from losing space. Show if they are the same corps and/or players
---
baited on a free copypasta
---
No, without killmails I could look like less of a threat :)
---
Can't wait to see your vid!
---
horde &gt; pl
---
There's a balance to be struck tho. 
---
On one side there's the people pouring resources like organising intel channels and response fleets in order to make their space safer on the other there's the roamer who spent 60mil on an ass frig and feels entitled to content cuz he just did 20 jumps with nobody in sight. 
---
We had rorq nerfs and carrier application nerfs which is fine with me as both a rorq and carrier pilot. At the same time as a solo pvp player I don't feel like I deserve to be invisible until I land on a PVE ship. If people want to stop mining/ratting because they saw a white square in local 10 systems away that's a fine trade off. If they want to keep mining/ratting they're doing exactly what you ask of everyone - taking a risk to get the reward.
---
Man that would be nice.
---
Great video, I loved it
---
I didn't know NC roleplayed.
---
I bet he has a ball in Provi
---
Yes. It wasn't popular.
---
&gt;active by basically any metric
---
Station spin count? Or was that NC.. O no, right, they don't have any stations left.
---
You need 0 Accounts.  
---
Best thing you can do at the moment.  
---
:-P  
---
But for real:  
---
I have 4 accounts and unsobbed 3 of them.  
---
If you wanna do PVP you dont need more.  
---
If you wanna do production you need atleast 2.  
---
Butr if you just want to make mony and build things youll get more and mroe accounts.  
---
Join goons, ROrqual Mine the whole day or rat and youll pay your account with ingame money.
---
one of the most experienced/famous pvp'ers in our group is a single-boxer who never uses more than one account
---
exploration certainly does not require multiple accounts, it's one of the most recommended options for a new player because of its ease to get into. it's definitely not suicidal. 
---
so yes, it's definitely possible to be a singleboxer in eve 2019 if that's your jam. I personally wouldn't because I enjoy the challenge of multiboxing and find it fun, but you're not really as "stunted" you make it sound.
---
if you don't want to multibox and don't want to grind your soul out, then set your expectations accordingly. why not get really good at exploration? why not get really good at frigate/destroyer solo pvp? why not become a really experienced tackle pilot for your corp for roams, finding content in a ceptor/interdictor?
---
Are medium drones fast enough to kill wolf's, and jaguars?
---
Try lowsec pvp, quite different pvp.
---
Mre oriented to small gangs, 1 vs 1....
---
I have 2 accounts. It does really well for me. A lot of my corp mates have 3+. 
---
But basically, I have my sub-cap main on my ain't account, and capital alt and Indy alt on my second account.
---
Enough accounts to make your own life easy, but not too many to burn yourself out on keeping track of everything.
---
Game quality is approaching the same level of shit as most of the player base's personalities.
---
What exactly can a hunter use the knowledge of `Every system in this region has 40 anoms` for?
---
How does automatically mapping out every wormhole for you to roll them with ease encourage pvp? Unless ofc you count sabre vs sigil as pvp.
---
Are we the baddies?
---
As if you’re serious with that name
---
You need at least 12 accounts:
---
Minmatar subcaps
---
Caldari subcaps
---
Amarr subcaps
---
Gallente subcaps
---
Abyssal subcaps
---
Jita alt
---
Dreads
---
Carriers/supercarriers
---
Faxes
---
Titan
---
Rorquals x ?
---
Reprocessing/industry
---
Just kidding... I have 3.  My all PvP pilot, my rorqual pilot, and my alpha Jita alt.
---
I really should have split subcaps and capitals into different characters, though. 53 million sp main and I'm adequate at best for the things I can actually fly.
---
Map out the number of sigs in every nearby system while you're idly mining. Once you see wormholers appear on intel you then can open the signature list and only look for the systems with +1 sig.
---
Is your statement a proven fact or just what you saw?
---
Because I doubt that you monitor bots for hours and hours to check how they act. And what I heard, is that bots do NOT farm 24/7 but take turns for a few hours, then another bot takes over. Simply to mask the the bot, they also do not stay always the same time amount in the citadel, after docking up etc. 
---
The simple bots are not the problem, it's the professional bots. And those know how to mask their stuff...
---
It's just arrogant to assume you know it better than the ppl whose job it is.
---
To late for that
---
If you want to fly capital ships, you need two or you wont be able to move anywhere without somebody helping you. If you just want to explore or pvp then you only need one.
---
yes, but what you said is exactly why you do NOT need a way to explain what made the day good/bad.
---
They can already correlate the "good/bad" with the activities
---
Problem there isn't too many systems, but rather the ability to pack way too much farming into a small amount of space.
---
Back in ancient times, when the only null-sec ratting available was bouncing between static asteroid belts waiting for rats to spawn, there were far fewer players but we were spread all over. Because the very limited amount of ISK that could be made per system made it far more profitable to move to a less desirable system (with fewer asteroid belts) than trying to share a more desirable system. Right now you can pack all the ratters from a large alliance into one or two constellations.
---
And this is even worse now for mining, where a single system - with the downright idiotic re-spawn mechanic of mining anoms - can conceivably contain an entire decent sized alliance. It used to be that you'd have to move the mining op to a system with the resources you needed, and could only get so much of it before the system was empty. Now you can just plant a few Rorquals in one system and farm everything you could possibly need non-stop.
---
So yea. tldr: resources need to be spread out.
---
I would personally say 3 is the optimal number once you're settled in. That allows you to do plenty of things including capital combat and hauling, and use support alts in combat. Any more than that is just for making money really.
---
"gorilla warfare...''

---
Imagine being this much of a salty faggot
---
&gt; It's not exploration, it's merely scanning now.
---
You do realize that the only thing it is showing the exact type of is shit that you don't scan down anyways... I fail to see how this changes anything for explorers.
---
&gt; There is positively absolutely and completely no way for me to take 30 people out of a c2 and do anything other than “ running away efficiently”.
---
For about 13 years you could take 30 people into nullsec and do more than run away from supers. CCP has ignored this problem for so long that it's become the new normal.
---
just take a camper and put it in one of the known botting systems/regions, wait until he gets blued up and watch. (thats what i did with multiple toons)
---
in 99% of the time its nothing ''advanced'' just plain crab 24/7 with the ''usual'' cooldowns.
---
im fully aware that it is possible to get/write something advanced as you said. but why should one run an ''advanced'' bot if a simple one nets you more, doesnt get banned anyways or if he gets banned made more than enough isk to just inject into a new one?
---
Once you are in blessed beans, which I assume will be next month. There is a bunch of other pvp sigs, each one that is more active in certain time zones. Partisans is just the easiest to get in.
---
Chanur Corporation
---
Sirius Syndicate
---
Project Nadelkissen
---
Those three left KWG and joined AOM.
---
What in the hell is the point of the CSM if decent feedback you provide is completely ignored without any discussion?
---
you need one, you can have just as much fun with one as you can with 20.
---
We need a reason to not put 30k dudes in one region, we need less people in more regions, not more people in less regions
---
This video is incredible masterpiece! All hail Olmeca\_Gold o7
---
Well let's hope it Will Bring change and not another legacy alliance
---
!Remindme 1 year
---
I could hear the crack as every miner's and ratters and ded runners collective balls just shrivelled up. wonder how long pvp will last when no one wants to mine.
---
Can we fly drifter battleships yet ccpls?
---
the why is simple to answer: 
---
Since you need to replace the bot anyways eventually. You can just start with 2 bots, that have a longer survival time. Though in the end, it's just a question of how much longer masked bots will survive...
---
Not only the lack of value, regional resources need to be a thing again and regions today can sustain too much people

Keep on the fight
---
Don't worry I heard they'll iterate on it
---
I understand your point but I can’t quite agree.
---
The guy in the lolfit frig is entitled to his content. We all are.
---
You are entitled to be able to scan. But not as an automatic process. Come on.
---
Also, scanning a guy 10 jumps out, I think that’s overdoing it. Nobody says that this guy is coming your way. Also, I can’t believe that there are that many nulsec systems, maybe on the rim of the universe, that are 10 jumps away from empire-controlled space. There are nul regions with one .5 system in it. Do you scan that guy too?
---
I’m not blind to the idea that you want to build things and that mining requires a sustained period of time where you can do serious harvesting. I have had neuts enter system, everybody was galloping towards the POS and stayed there so long as that guy was there.
---
That’s the risk though. Is it nice? No. Is it heaping problems on the miner / ratter? Yes it does. I made my first billion in a Drake [many Drakes] in Fountain. I’ve lit up the skies with entire fleets of miners in Tenal, Venal, Cloud Ring, Querious, Providence and Insmother.
---
Believe you me, I understand your predicament. I have entire pages of mining barges and exhumers that went *poof* in nul. I lost three Orcas. And you know what, that’s just the name of the game.
---
As a miner you can’t help but become rich. It simply doesn’t matter which ore you mine, so long as you mine enough of it you’ll get rich. I mined ice in hi-sec, when there was still ice in hi-sec. We mined in Tennen, Sivala, Hatakani. I ate an entire belt by myself in Unel :-), because I wanted to do that. Took me a while, I ate the whole thing :-).
---
In deep nul we spawned belts with huge rocks and let our golden beams, in the tens of them, chew through them like a toddler chews through cookies.
---
And it was dangerous. Spotting the guy 10 jumps out... really... that means nothing. We were mining in Providence and we had some shooters for protection. One of them was in a Maelstrom. Guess who decided that that was the day he was going to AWOX and take out a Hulk on the way out. Guess whose Hulk that was? My #6 Hulk, lost to an AWOXer. Knowing there are guys coming at me 10 jumps out would have done me precisely no good in that situation.
---
I totally understand your perspective. I’ve been where you are many a times. I still don’t think we want to be 100% safe in our endeavours. That’s not what you go to 0.0 for. That’s not what you [well, at least not I] play EVE for.
---
&gt;When it comes to EVE Online, it’s often said that the community aspect of the game is the best part about it.
---
That would make EVE a pile of dogshit
---
When the meta in eve 2019 is 40k strong coalitions you will never have that scary group again, all coalitions have strong enough super fleets to defend against anything you won't see moving
---
Dscanning in a system with you being the only friendly s fine - as in Wormholes.
---
Dscanning when you have a hundred friendlies in system moving around is worthless in terms of establishing if there's a neut.
---
Turning off the lights for everyone is a shit solution.

AS per the edit I think introducing resource sparsity across regions would bring content in a much more reasonable way than kneejerk turning null in WH space only with hundreds of people in systems instead of less than one on average. Making large alliances move their mining/ratting operations every day/week/month etc. would make space much more interesting.
---
If you have predictions feel free to post them.

/u/suitonia
---
Dumb question, whats the blue and red mean?
---
See with less space you are presented with those options which is you fight or you blue up . Right now neither is necessary. You have space for all . Goons attacking tribute move to vale and Branch . Test attacking immensea move to spire, cache . Also this gives more space for wormholes to spawn . Like i get a wormhole in malpais and i do like 13 jumps to find a vni on a weekend around say 16:00 . that is sad on so many levels . A good example of why less space works in Delve . Every system you find a rorq or a super doing something stupid . because delve is densely populated . Its always why we have multiple groups going there for content . Larger space also means higher chance of your fleet to be spotted . Like dare say you try and reach OMIST without being pinged on intel chat ever 20 times . Not even right now like two years ago i was in Omist and gated my super 10 jumps solo with no fear because the renters rolled most of the wholes and have intel as far as impass . Ask anyone from kids with guns . this is true .

Ya exactly what it makes work life life less carebear
---
a bot paid for itself after 2-3 days.. its simply not needed to run ''advanced'' bots.
---
One Acc. Three Chars. Works for me.
---
Sooo.. it was totally ok when NC/PL was steamrolling through SF space with their supercap fleet. It was totally ok when all of the eve was again CFC during Casino War. Now, once Imperium brings 1300 titans to Tribute - it’s time to break alliances into smaller entities? 😀
---
No man. Not today 😎
---
Why do I feel as though that was the biggest battle I will experience in this war?
---
Hi, I'm 2009 player, I use 1 account only.
---
&gt;not even 4 minutes in, already with at least 2 alts
---
fuck this game
---
Do not misunderstanding, you need more accounts to be optimal. You do not really need more then one account, this is a game and you play for fun. If you do fleet pvp or pve you do not need more then one account at all. Make friends and fill in the blanks with other dudes.
---
How sad for you
---
So true! 😁
---
standings
---
I am told they were the best.
---
I think Matterall or Exooki will take the Judges spot.  I don't think he is going to be top 3 on any ballot.  Could be wrong though.
---
mate... the ppl running bots aim to optimize their $/time (for fewer it's isk/time invested) invested. So they as long as they can optimize that efficiency, the will. The "no need to optimize" is okey for actual player, but not for bots...
---
Please no. Dont let them put the nail in the coffin.
---
if intel is perfect, why do things die
---
I 99% lurk here, but I have a moral obligation to post here and proclaim that this is indeed fucking terrible.
---
We can only hope that ANYONE takes his place for the next term.
---
Hmmm. Try hard. If he was any good he would need to rant like so.
---
You know there’s going to be several ways to go about that.
---
I’m all for having resources distributed more in certain regions than in others. So that it becomes a good reason to go ‘persuade’ people to share the wealth.
---
As far as removing local... I’m not sure about that. I talk to people in local a lot by initiating a conversation from the local list. That’s easy. I can see the value of removing that list in K space. In null... are you really going to ping D scan the whole time to get a partial view of who’s there at any given time? That’s going to be tiresome.
---
There’s got to be a way to handle that elegantly, I’m not smart enough today to suggest a working solution that satisfies nulsec EVE pilots. And, you want to trust me on that, I have an intimate idea how insanely impossible satisfying EVE pilots is, let alone the nulsec dwellers.
---
I feel there has to be risk. If only for one reason: I got chased in deep null by two russians, for *ten fucking jumps!!!* in my Iteron Mark V, and, my hand to Bob I’m serious, I had the shakes so bad I had actual trouble clicking the interface element to allow me to continue to jump to the next system to get away from them. Was it risky? FUCK-YEAH! Was I nervous? Like a motherfucker! Was it fun? You goddamn right it was.
---
In other games I couldn’t give a shit about dying. I’m not losing anything anyway. in EVE I’m losing the boat. I lose what’s on the boat, what’s in the boat, I may lose my head metal. You better goddamn believe I’m motivated to stay in one piece. THAT is the thrill of being in null / K space.
---
I want a balance between manageable and reasonable. Safety to the point where you can see what happens in the client while you’re not even logged in [maybe for structures...], I’m not a fan.
---
I’m a great believer in the meta game, and you certainly don’t need to be logged in for that. As far as the game mechanics goes, you need to be there. That’s the point of playing the game. You need to show up. The prizes of the game should be for the guys who show up.
---
I might vote for you just to see you and Aryth in one room followed with a black hole of autism :D
---
Highsec is the true endgame. You need to catch up.
---
Structure attacks can also be automated through ESI and forwarded out of the game, fyi.
---
Amazing work in this video and I love the history and explanation. EVE is in dire need of some change to remove the safety levels of these giant groups and make it possible for smaller groups to have an impact again.
---
The rest joined IGC
---
I guess I see your point but only if they were easily connected I think. I don't think we want people to be further apart
---
Provi was better when Valkorsia was there with his ultra-cringe m'lady'ing
---
damnit those are rookie numbers compared to sv5....
---
I wish you nothing but good health and good fights out there buddy. Keep kicking ass. Cancer sucks, but you got this thing.   
---
We're all your brothers and sisters out there, even if we shoot each other sometimes!
---
thats the thing though, if people lived more spread out there would be more action in every region thus making everyone closer, not further apart. 
---
The only difference would be that we would have lots of small alliances and medium scale fleets instead of titan dunks or blue balls
---
Hahaha, that would be the worst fucking thing ever.
---
Like the gate is a checkpoint...  I would also say if come through a wormhole, but at any time you are on grid with a gate you should then appear on local too
---
I'm not sure that we would end up with smaller alliances. I think it's more likely we'd see mega blocs spread out a little but leave space abandoned because they simply don't use it. Small and medium gangs would also likely have to go further to get decent content.
---
Yeah, almost as if I mentioned it in the post. :)
---
What if we conspire with Sid to kidnap and clone Dunk 9 times, then put Dunk and the Dinkles on the CSM.
---
Just wondering, that’s the spot represent anything? Or is it that normally 10 people are chosen to be part of CSM?
---
killah bee is blue now ?
---
so, the countless vnis i watched orbiting hubs 24/7 initiating warp as soon as a neut pops in with all of them having the same cooldown are what then?
---
since you say real botters use ''good'' bots, are those now real players pretending to be ''bad'' bots because everyone would use ''good'' bots. and thus they dont look suspicious?
---
srsly.. just put a few claoky campers in known bot regions and watch. its so fucking obvious
---
Because they fitted in those 90% predictable situations, where you know it either dies to N+1 or it doesn't.
---
jesus you bit this bait hard
---
One account perfectly works. Wise planning of the three characters is, however, much advised. If I were to create a longer term one-account plan, with one main and two alts, eventually ...
---
- I would train my main as I want, what I find interesting and/or worth training and/or fun.
---
- I would train up a highsec t2 hauler alt. This is the alt I found the most useful through the years. Being able not to enter highsec with your main for any reason (wardecs, standings, sec status, other issues) and ferry what's needed from Jita independently from others is a perk I found invaluable. This pilot will not do any missions/combat/etc to keep a clean record to operate in highsec. Alternatively, you can train it also into trading and trade in Jita, or supply lowsec hubs, etc.
---
- I would train my third character into some money-making profession. Factional warfare missions come to mind first, or, if you go to nullsec, a ratting/mining alt also sounds good. Being able to separate isk making from my main pilot is a thing I did when I was about 2 years into the game, and I like it very much. You can keep your main always in the action, in a deployment, or in a good system to gatecamp, and if you are done, you can log your alt in to farm. Also, you don't ruin your main's standings, for example, if you decide to train a FW missioner alt.
---
Sure, it involves a lot of training issues as the alts need SP too. I would train up a t2 hauler first, then train my main and if I feel fit throw some SP to the 3rd character.
---
Things I'd miss mainly if I were to go down to 1 account (from the current 2):
---
- not being able to light cynos to myself,
---
- not being able to keep cloaky eyes on the other side of the gate while camping,
---
- not being able to do two things at once in general.
---
Yup I totally should have pulled range but was sticking to my original gameplan of trying to kill things before triage landed, and before I could really react to the situation, I got headshot!
---
Metagame is when you use things outside the game to win inside the game. Like getting your opponent alliance's leader banned to eradicate the alliance. Or flipping senior management of opponent alliances to steal their structures. Or trying to get someone kicked from their corporation because the corporation is renting from you. Or trying to isolate people, downvote brigade them, trying to get them banned, be generally toxic toward them on social media to suppress their ideas. Or influencing CSM feedback to get the game mechanics you want to the best of your ability.
---
These are all examples of things actually happened.
---
10 seats, 10 spots on each vote ballot.
---
Keep on fighting the good fight Bro &lt;3
---
From what I am reading it would say 
---
4 Havens 2 dens and 3 rally points. Ext I don't know the exact sites I don't krab. 
---
Yes it may say that there are 4 "unnamed" sites but there would be no way to know if the new site is a wormhole without scanning it.
---
It's a likely future, unless we do some sort of time heist to change perceptions.
---
ah, true.
---
I understand now, thanks :)
---
Hold my beer.
---
Weren't you the botter that was going to back Elo Knight?
---
SP farmers shutting down their accounts due to unprofitability might hit him hard lol.
---
If we share votes we might both have better chances. Just dragging a single name into the 1 slot isn't helpful to outsider candidates.
---
Botter? I have never done PVE in my life lol.   
---
Shows what you know about this game hey. A bot is something that's automated by a program without human interaction.   
---
Maybe you are getting muddled up with input broadcasting?
---
Happy Reddit birthday dood
---
We've just free'd up like 50% of local scout bots
---
We are sharing votes with people of a similar mindset. I don't think you are of a similar mindset. At least not similar enough. And not because your flair or affiliation.
---
I hope for exo personally, having someone on the CSM who actually knows how wormhole mechanics work would be useful for hopefully preventing them becoming unintentional collateral damage.
---
I'm going to shed some light on this question. It is entirely possible and completely playable to do everything in eve with a single character on a single account.
---
Mining, exploration, industry, PI, PvP, and PVE can be done with a single character. Of course some of these activities are scaleable.
---
Yes you can jet can mine with one char, but 2 is better. Indy is more efficient with the extra characters.
---
When it comes to capital ships you can Yolo them or have mates help, but a alt allows you to use them more freely. And yes this includes titans as well.
---
Alts add flexablity and give you self reliance, however unless you sub your accounts your going to have to grind out 2+bil per 500 plex for each of your accounts. So if min/max is your thing, go for it. But if you want to enjoy the game here is my suggestion.
---
Character needed/preferred
---
PvP-1
---
PVE-1 /2-3 (depends if c5/6 ratting)
---
Exploration-1
---
Mining-1 / scalable to your limits
---
Industry-1 /2-4
---
Planetary Interaction-1 /2-3 
---
Carriers/dreads-1 /2 (an alt to light cyno)
---
Super/titan-1 /3 (a fax alt and a alt for cyno)
---
As you can see, everything in eve is accessible with just 1 character. Having a alt or 2 helps but it isnt necessary. If a Corp requires multiple alts and you dont want to grind or don't have the time/money then walk away. There are plenty of groups that will accept a solo alt player.
---
New phone, who dis?
---
for continue \*bot\* farm inside omist 
---
FIXED THAT FOR YOU
---
You uh, do realise who buy products from those industries yes?
---
I appreciate this attitude. We are all nerds loving the same videogame. It's general well-being should come prior than ingame affiliations.
---
I agree. Tell your friends to vote o7
---
People with 1 account can make all the difference when it comes to important stuff. More accounts is just a means to be able to do things easier.
---
What the fuck did you do in eve then
---
Get spare alts. Join DPCI Discord. We already have lots of NC'ers.
---
What is blessed beans? And my time zone is utc+2 (I think)
---
Are you saying your mindset is Anti- CSM Reform? If it is I don't think you will find many people to help you.
---
If there's one man who should be rooting for blops representation, sure enough, that'd be you :p
---
You are missing 90% of the game
---
Explore and mine
---
Maybe, I use neither because I am a purist. Tell me something, can input broadcasting be used to cast votes for CSM?
---
So here is what I would do. I would buy like 20 frigates and move them to a high arc near faction warfare space. Satcmon is a good system. And just take out those frigs and learn how to fly them. Look up guides and stuff for your preferred frig. Pve is boring. Work an hour and buy plex instead. Pvp is where the real heart pounding fun is.
---
Ask people for fits and try stuff. 
---
Train support skills.
---
So once upon a time, you had to drop a Multispectral Probe.  This would list the types of site that were in the system.  Once you knew the type of site, you'd destroy the probe and start warping to each planet in the system, dropping a 4AU Quest Probe at each one.
---
Because you couldn't place a probe within the scan area of a second probe, you'd end up with gaps in your coverage (all sites would lie within 4AU of a planet).  You'd get around this by warping across the system, creating mid-warp bookmarks so you could cover as much of the potential site spawn area as possible.
---
You'd hit scan, and wait.  You could be sat there waiting minutes for the scan to complete.  And then, once it was complete, you'd get no results.  Maybe it was because you hadn't covered the entire system.  Or maybe the site was so hard to find that your probes had been unable to get a hit.  So you'd hit scan again.  And again.  And again.  And eventually you'd get a hit.  If you were lucky, you'd get them with your first set of probes.  And it would be a weak hit, but a hit nonetheless.  **Progress!!!**
---
You'd warp to your hit and check it's quality.  Quest probes would be able to scan within 4AU.  Pursuit would scan within 2AU.  When you got the hit, you'd see the 'distance', i.e. distance of the site from the probe, and the 'deviation', i.e. how accurate this distance was.  If you ended up with something like 1.9AU +/- 0.2AU, there was 25% chance that you wouldn't actually hit the site with a Pursuit probe.  So you'd destroy any probes within range, drop another Quest, and start scanning again.
---
Over a period of sometimes an hour or more, you'd slowly get closer and closer to the site, warping to new hits if their distance and deviation were lower than the last one, and dropping a new probe at its location.  As you got closer, the scan time got shorter, but so did the lifetime of the probe.  When you got all the way down to 0.5AU, you'd be down to less than 10 minutes flight time for the probe.  But it wouldn't take more than a couple of scans of a Sift probe to get a 100% hit.  And then you could bookmark the site and finally return to your station or outpost or POS and switch to a ship that was capable of running the site.
---
That's assuming there was only one site to probe in the system.
---
It was a mind-numbingly dull process, made tolerable only by the banter of your buddies on TeamSpeak, the distraction of belt ratting on your main, and the knowledge that that gas site you were probing down was worth a month's subscription.
---
And then Apocrypha came out.  Gone were the 17 types of exploration probes for different site types and ranges, replaced by only one which covered every site that existed; all that time wasted buying and researching blueprints.  Gone was the long scan time, down from several minutes to mere seconds; all that time wasted training Signal Acquisition V for the reduced scan time because the power of probing now came from the power of the probes, not the time taking to perform each scan.  Gone was the chance based system for getting your first hit on a site, replaced instead by a triangulation method.  And gone was the static nature of probes; you now launched them individually, then dragged them individually into position across the system or around the site.
---
Whereas before you had to drop a Multispectral find out which types of site exist within the system, now you could drop a single deep space scanner probe on maximum range, run a scan, and, based on the signal strength of each hit you got and the level of your skills, eliminate all the sites you knew weren't what you were after.
---
It was frustrating at first given how dumbed down the system had become, how so much of the time that I had put into the old system had been so devalued by the new system.  But I had made that time back in ISK several times over.  And the new system made sense.  Exploration became accessible to the masses, opening a new way of living to many players that had since been ignored by many, yet still required practice and skill to truly become a master of.  22s was my record between jumping into a system and fleet warping the tackle onto a DED running Tengu.  I got high off that Tengu kill for fucking days.  And then, a year or so later, I left.
---
When I returned last year, the system had changed again, dumbed down even further.  No longer did you have to drop a probe and perform a scan to find out what was in system, it simply shows you how many signatures there are when you jump in.  No longer did you have to launch each probe individually, rather you would automatically launch 8 in one go (IIRC, your Astrometrics level previously influenced the number or probes you could launch simultaneously).  They would be launched in a neat little pattern.  You moved them all in one go.  And you adjusted their range in one go.
---
These changes sped things up significantly, increasing accessibility further, and I'm still undecided whether they were a good changes or not.  And there were certainly some losses too, at least with respect to the depth of the exploration system and the removal of high-level play.  No longer did you have to think about your individual probe placement.  No longer could you probe multiple sites simultaneously.  No longer were you faced by that difficult choice when combat probing an enemy as to whether you spend longer launching more probes to boost your hit chance at the risk of giving the enemy more time to flee, or go with fewer and hope that a combination of the time saved by not launching so many and your own personal skill level at probe placement would let you find and catch them before they warps away.
---
And now we see it dumbed down yet again.
---
In 10 years, we've gone from:
---
1. Jump into system, drop multispectral probe, run a scan, wait 2-10 minutes for the scan to complete to see if any sites are in system and what type.
---
2. Jump into a system, drop any scan probe on maximum range, wait around 10-15 seconds for the scan to complete to see if any sites are in system and how many.
---
3. Jump into a system, open the probe scanner to see if any sites are in system and how many.
---
4. Open up the Agency and know exactly which system you have to go to for sites.
---
What the fuck CCP.  Have you even looked up what exploration really means?
---
Personally I wouldn't feel safe walking out the front door every morning without the knowledge that if mugged I can wipe out the entire east coast with the 16 R-29R missiles (each carrying 3 MIRV warheads) aboard my Soviet surplus Delta-III class SSBN.
---
Heat your weapons capsuleer, stay cold, youll be looting your enemy very soon.
---
Amazing content dude, even tho im not the biggest fan of the playstyle, the production quality on this makes me gain a whole lot of respect for what you do
---
Yes you can legally use input broadcasting for many things according to the eula. Something which you know nothing about again?  
---
The blind leading the blind as they say.
---
nc. is merging with INIT after pl is confirmed dead
---
Its a bit like this. Eve + youtube/netflix,  or eve + eve. Multiboxing is not required but you will inevitably gravitate to a secondary activity. Lots of people choose this second activity to be more eve and get a second account.
---
It's a little too late now but I probably should have removed the conditional formatting for this document before posting it publicly. NC. isn't merging with INIT that I know of.
---
Sort won't make it without Imperium support, GOTG is a lot smaller than last time, and their new additions will probably not care that much about CSM, last time he was on PANFAM ballots too. 
---
Same with judge, unless imperium puts him high up he wont make it. 
---
I'd also not completely rule out Olmeca
---
It's not perfect intel, and you are referring to largely big alliances or coalitions that can defend their space and have the ability to do dev work for ESI notifications. 
---
If you are simply chasing an idea is that there must be a way to punish large orgs for their success and troll them, sov warfare or poking their structures is not the answer. 
---
It's either guerilla type hunting like what Omelca did, BB, and enjoy your content that way, or form an alternative successful org to fight. 
---
No idea listed in this thread will resolve the fact that they can bring hundreds of paying subscribers to push back against your small gang of subscribers.
---
but the memes
---
Than how come nobody has ever been documented using it to cast votes? If it's legal and legit than there should be just as many tutorials and videos as their are for mining and fleet warping.
---
TAPI needs it pls understand, there's a threat of eviction.
---
You're more explicit about it in the first bullet. Suggestion is just for consistency.
---
Sad but true. I never had that many accounts, but I know plenty of people who played with 10+. That statistic CCP threw out about there only being something like 1.6 accounts per player is bullshit. That probably figures in every account ever created in Eve, not just active accounts. 
---
They'll never limit how many accounts you can have, it would hurt their bottom line. CCP has figured out what other game companies have figured out, you can suck just as much money out of a handful of whales as you can a whole group of regular players. Whether it's paying for all those accounts or buying the PLEX the other multiboxers purchase so they don't have to grind ISK, whales are dumping as much money in to Eve as hundreds of single account players would. That's why CCP will never go too far in restricting their playstyle.
---
More like CAD, that shit is more intensive than some games.
---
One common ground among many issues isn't enough. CSM 14 needs people who'd make a good case for making nullsec and specifically heavily guarded umbrella space less safe. Your voter base wouldn't vote for you again if you did that.
---
Besides, [you think](http://prntscr.com/nt6sqk) me or Gobbins running is scary. You wouldn't be scared people like me if you had enough common ground. Even as a rival candidate, you'd be more scared of people like The Judge or random Goon FC #4 getting elected.

Perfect intel help more hunter than farmer.
---
Perfect intel is when you can find you're target beacause the map said to you " X people undock in this system". You will see anom from far, you can check witch anom dispaear (or not) and deduce where are people BEFORE enter in system.
---
And no they will not see WH from far if you are a WH roller. Remimber, people don't see you're static unless you travel across. You know what it means ? it means you will be on system when you're WH appear. So if people have decent intel they know you are here same time as now. 
---
And if you "remove LOCAL REMOVE LOCAL" you actually kill the game. Beacause basically people will have 2 choice : stop farm or use more manpower. Big entity could have more man power and so it will change nothing for they. 
---
If you want to see what will be a 0.0 without local just check a regionw hen you have permacloacker everywhere : Big entity don't care little stop farm. 
---
You don't have more target you have less target. 
---
And don't said " remove local counter bot" it's the opposite. The only thing who make removing local will coutner bot is time they're dev adapt. When they will adapt you will have only bot who can saffely farm beacause you will have a bot army of cloacky syrvey gate and probe signature when pop to communicate to other bot. 
---
A big problem in eve roammer mentality is they want change to hunt easier but they forget one thing : if the change is to powerfull you looze target and you will cry "50 system empty i see no people". If change is not powerfull you will have a lot of target during some weeks and after nothing beacause people adapt. 
---
You have a proof of this : Delve when war start.  No more defense people are happy and kill a lot of super/titan. Now you have a shitons less people in delve, and you kill only few people, less density of population, less general content.  
---
So please before speack for a change, think to the global change , and not only make 1 perfect showcase for you. Think to all thing who will change. 
---
If you remove local you make all space like WH but with more predicatable gate to go roam, AND perfect intel for hunter in map...
---
This change kill more little entity congrats Kill more eve pleaze
---
I think you vote on the eve website right? So people would probably just run a script or something if they have 200 accounts. Its nothing to do with the game.   
---
Jesus you are a dumb dumb hey... Poor guy. Just read the EULA it clearly states what you can do with input broadcasting.   
---
Are you jealous of my success or something? Why so salty?  
---
Ah I just zkilled your toon "**Xenuria"** as I was unaware who you were. Now it all makes sense.   
---
Where did the stealth bomber touch you?
---
Short term another legacy alliance. Mangoes need yo put stable roots somewhere. Make iskies. Train skills and   maybe 2yrs down the line they can afford to shift allegiance.
---
Till then... Blue donut :)
---
will you be staying true to your proposal and only voting with one account
---
That statistic is bullshit. See if they'll tell you if that's for active accounts or all accounts. They never describe how they extrapolated that data and the graph even lists it as an "estimate".
---
not sure he was the first but he has been saying it for ages
---
Are you Fuxking nuts ?? 
---
Ok fine if you wanna delete any system , delete all non starter system highsec systems , and where ever chribba mines , that mining ship of his needs to die !!
---
this is dope
---
Maybe Rework POS to be short term bases. If you want a beachhead smack down a pos or ajust create a small structure.
---
Hi , is this the new kugu revamp thread ? 
---
If so I’m in ! 
---
If not I’m gay for jay !
---
Only to be killed by no less than 12 Black Legion spies.
---
2019 and there are still people unaware of the navy seal copy-pasta.
---
I mean... You got to have some high sec space right? Otherwise new players will just be camped in
---
Soooo that is not pve?
---
You havent played much abyss right? It is kinda solvable, but randomization is huge. Yoi can be good at it, but sometimes even best abyss runners die to mistake in piloting / very difficult EWAR heavy wave.
---
CSM gives feedback, not orders. Not to mention at this point I think CCP realizes the CSM is useless because it's used by the big blocks as a tool to push their agenda
---
Shooting rocks and shooting NPC is basically the same thing except rocks are even more boring
---
That's way too long. Find their public channel and ask.
---
7 days is really not enough to do anything from an only alpha build. 
---
I would how ever find any short omega skills that you have access to and put them in to lvl2
---
I am just confused as to why Baltec wasn't structure bashing in a mega..
---
Yeah that just sounds like a whole bunch of fuckery at the start. I think at some point you have to realize a game is entertainment and people don't want to stare at the fucking monitor for 10 minutes waiting on a 'Scan Probe Result". 
---
What's with you weird fucking people that think playing a game needs to be like chinese water torture?
---
Watch out we got an Einstein here :)
---
Staying true to my proposal means doing my best to make it a reality, which means voting with many accounts. 
---
But hey, given the alts we got between Mar5hy and me, by proposing 1 person = 1 vote, I am already leading by example. I am arguing against my own personal interests, and for the overall health of the game. You folks can do the same. You can, for example, add me to the Goon ballot to have diversity in the CSM body. I know there is already casual talk of it too.
---
You mean to say by solo mining with a rorqual I can earn enough money to pay for a second account with plex? How grindy is that though?
---
lmao
---
Did OP just rage quit reddit over this post?
---
N+1
---
For every Jesus feature, a Judas feature
---
Tbh I don't watch Netflix while playing EVE and if a game were that boring I'd quit it and enjoy a series or movie instead.
---
joke, your head, etc.
---
Agreed. I also know my wormhole mechanics and would do my best to avoid the HIC incident again or to correct when people (Brisc) say things like "wormholers were never intended for long term living".
---
Well? What did you choose ?
---
Jebaited by this in 2019, ouch.
---
* Removing region specific resources was a mistake : It was done to help little entity to develop and avoid embargo from bigger entity and make market mroe accessible. It has work as entended but by making this you reduce the itnerest of invading neighbourg.
---
* Defending is too strong, sov needs a change to favour attacking : Problem is not the sov in this case, it's citadel. To many timer, and you can server tank big battle. 
---
* Local is too strong: It's why you have a lot of kill in 0.0 ... local is not to strong, local help little entity. Big entity in reality don't care of local they could just jump shitons of super to save someone. If you remove local you kill one big interest of WH.  And remimber roammer have perfect intel with map and npc stats... farmer have nothing to predict ennemy if they do'nt have local, so if you want kill little entity make mroe stagnation and kill game... remove local.
---
* The game needs a shake up bad, and that he would rather they overdo it and shit hits the fan than to let it keep dying : You need a shake up, but not the one you actually think. In fact you need to solve 2 problem inside CCP to make the shake : FIRST is to have a general direction and follow it (like end the citadel change before triglavian). SECOND is to stop to make change on symptom of problem find and curse the rootcause AND think to all possibility not only optimal one. \*

Came to the last fleet, will come again if I can make it, I'm guessing T2 lazors?
---
&gt; It takes a measure of achievement away from it 
---
I think some of us have enough achievement in our own lives we don't need to sit down in front of a game to get it. 
---
I sit down for entertainment, to be a Jedi or a starship pilot, or a wizard battling a dragon in a deep, dark dungeon, or a soldier battling it out on the front lines, not to get some sort of sense of accomplishment that I'm lacking in my own life. You fucking no-lifer "you should have to sit in front of your PC for 18 hours grinding and earn X" are a fucking cancer on the video gaming community.

Fax proliferation doesnt matter. 15-20 Fax will cockblock a dreadbomb. It doesnt matter if they have 1000 Fax instead of 200 if only a fraction of them will negate all dps. "PL Dreadbombs" ( whatever that even is supposed to mean) always banked on controlling fax numbers in one way or another.
---
haha dae pl is dying xd
---
It's kind of the best kind though
---
But it has a low sec gate...
---
You can FC for spectre. They’ll even give you a backseat FC to help if you want tips. Message me in game and I can get you started. Fisher Kel (won’t be able to respond until Sunday night)
---
&gt; Fax proliferation doesnt matter. 15-20 Fax will cockblock a dreadbomb.
---
As far as I know, until some point Goons didn't have this many that can respond to a dreadbomb at a moment's notice. That's been the Goon side of the story, hence my point with proliferation. By proliferation I didn't mean fielding 500 FAXes, but I meant being able to field the minimum amount at any given time.
---
&gt; "PL Dreadbombs" ( whatever that even is supposed to mean) always banked on controlling fax numbers in one way or another.
---
Stuff like [this.](https://imperium.news/pl-dreadbomb-350b-destroyed-delve/) happened multiple times. You can't replicate that today. Your dreads will die before PANIC expires. That has nothing to do with PL interest. It has to do with Goons being able to respond more swiftly and with more ships.
---
Fight on bro! Ill be sure to gank a volta in your name as revenge :)
---
sounds like a way to get you to see what youre missing. Not sure if you can train 5's for ship skills (ie cruisers 5) but if you can it will give you a week to realize you never wanna fly tier 1 ships again.
---
You do you, but pve can pay for pvp which is fine. But if you are good at pvp then it can pay for its self without having to pve to make iskies
---
Oh I don't disagree that the original system was cancer.  As pissed as I was when it changed, change had to happen and what they did with it was great.  But then subsequent changes?  Eurgh.
---
I bet delve guy actually lives in stain.
---
Nice deadpool reference.
---
The Problem is Sov, it's annoying.
---
OpSec, shhhhh 🤫
---
I've been saying it for years, but zkill is bad for eve. Having all that info completely fucks the game play of the unknown. Instead of judging by ship and eyeball intel, we get massive amounts of data about what our potential combatant is flying, what kinds of fits they use, and how good they are.   
---
Not only this, but zkill and their ratio system have totally borked politics since all people in corporations care about is not being shamed by a bad zkill. I played the game before zkill was a thing, and my god it was so insanely mysterious going out there, but so much goddamn fun. KILL ZKILL.  KILL PERFECT INTEL. Destroy ESI.   
---
TL;DR: DATA MUST DIE.
---
How so?  The current state is pretty boring where is the worse part?
---
I guess you can go exploring with a cloak now.
---
Yeah, you would work. I think exo would be better for wormhole representationg because WHs is basically all he does and he has perspective on how high class WH space works. Also stitch kaneland as he is the closest I see to a suitonia replacement, the CSM needs someone who can look at the stats of a ship and have a good idea how it will break the game.
---
I agree. I will have them both in my ballot.
---
There still someone's grandma out there finding the game too complex.
---
2018 called, they want to give me the big die.
---
Amazing video, the music does drown the sound of your voice sometimes, so next time lower it a wee bit. Definitively voting for you in the csm elections, i too am pissed off at the game becoming capitals online, cant even have fun BS roams anymore without some loser dropping caps on you. o7
---
They care enough about QA that the servers are mostly stable on a daily basis. If they didn't care about QA, the game would've died 10 years ago, after people mass quit after the servers don't boot properly day after day.
---
QA is about verifying that things have been implemented as intended and they haven't broken something else at the same time, not that the mechanics make sense. The job of QA is to make sure that the mechanics work as intended, and for the most part, they do. We can expect that the current changes in the patch notes are going to happen. Even if the mechanics as intended make the game worse.
---
You can change the color of your overview windows
---
lol  i know eve WAS hard but this? really? seriously ?
---
Sounds like you're pissed again, but maybe change needs to happen
---
i wanna join in to say wow what a movie. amazing work. thanks for making 98% of us fell like fucking retards playing this game ;)
---
also legit question. what is the source of the amazing footage the last 2 minutes. i know i play pretty close to potato but where do you get this crazy level of camera panning and explosions seemingly after the facts in a big fight.
---
i wish i could see the face of the mackinaw dude when his daywent shitshitshitshitshitshitshit WTFFFFFFFF
---
to think of how my heart pounds when i try and fail to kill an astero.. having so much stuff going on is really impresive.
---
yes, it was tested a while ago on sisi and found to be the case. Really doubt it's patched tho
---
I wonder if the CSM were read-in on this change?   
---
Did they try to tell CCP it would be a bad idea?  
---
Was this change a result of direct GSM lobbying? /s
---
As someone who does exactly this, I recommend staging out of Ichoriya and flying around Black Rise, or staging out of Rens and going to Amamake. Both are high sec trade hubs two jumps from factional warfare space
---
indeed
---
Killmails are fun. Just because it's not your fun..
---
I mean. I see no harm deleting like period basis, outer passage, omist, and cache from the game.
---
Meh, eve has only seen significant growth when the universe grew. Given up arguing this point. EVE is already way to small. That's as much effort as I'm giving. Carry on.
---
Maybe the Triglavians will delete the Deviant Automata Lands
---
It's so boring and grindy that the suggestion is to just tab out and watch Netflix instead.
---
Exploration is perfectly fine for a solo player. You can also do combat exploration by scanning down unrated or DED sites. The unrated ones in the Dronelands are easily blitzable and done in a relatively cheap Tengu, and net you some really good loot (Sentient faction stuff + Drone materials).
---
CCP Rounding
---
I get a 404 page not found mate :(
---
Cancer?  I'm no doctor (and I suck at Eve too) but I'll still recommend faction anti-matter charges in a heavy ion blaster.  Should work like a charm.
---
Hm, i just started getting that now as well. Might be due to a quick edit. Try it again.
---
&gt; also legit question. what is the source of the amazing footage the last 2 minutes.
---
Oh, those are scenes from many old trailers of Eve lol. I definitely didn't shoot them. But some of them are wonderful. Go watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIhIMizrkWk&amp;list=PLQvKSs1k6DLM_A7Y5dbK5uH5kOwNDALK7
---
if someone buys at 1bil it shows up in price history
---
I just found one of my CSM votes.... excellent stuff, respect....
---
That's what TEST was saying 2 years ago.
---
Clearly you need more EVE accounts.
---
ok
---
When your account reverts to alpha you wont be able to use the omega skills even if you train them
---
enjoy your skillpoint boost
---
it ded, making new post.
---
The title translates to 'Hatred Will Prevail'
---
Sorry for 2nd post on this, deleted 1st as the link died. Should be good now.
---
This story, and this video, is a thing of beauty, but also inspires a certain melancholy.
---
Your level of excellence and dedication is astonishing and paradoxically inspiring. On the one hand, I am inspired to seek my own kind of excellence. On the other hand, you are so far beyond the level to which I might hope to aspire that I am equally inspired to un-subscribe and take up another hobby. 
---
I cannot even manage a bait alt, much less multiple fleets. With nothing but admiration for your achievement, I am nonetheless saddened that the pinnacle of "solo" operations in EVE is managing scores of accounts.
---
Manic Velocity and ExookiZ have an uphill fight to knock you from the top slot for my paltry two votes.
---
That’s how willy wonka and the chocolate factory started.
---
Shift to what 2 years later? There'll be only one donut.
---
I don't really care much about kill-board elitism. Calling me dumb for soliciting advice from an expert input broadcaster is kinda silly.
---
&gt;Remember that the biggest battle in gaming history happened after an error and happened without planning.    
---
    
---
Actually it happened because of a bug that was later fixed by ccp mostly under the radar.
---
Your friends are correct. 
---
You will need multiple accounts to do anything and be competitive at it. 
---
And this doesnt even including dedicated combat alts who will be logged off the entire time except for when youre actually using them. 
---
But any of the basic professions, you CAN play with 1 account, it will just be limited in scope really. So i was able to sustain myself with 1 rorq mining, right, but its just better with more. Lets say you wanna do capital ship building; 1 account is DEFINITELY not going to be enough. For most other things too.
---
I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt but I suppose that was my error. Also you lightshot lol?
---
in 1999 Iceland came socond after 10 years in 2009 they came second again after 20 years in 2019 they will win eurovision
---
So what you're saying is we'll either end up with the Dunkest CSM possible, or a bunch of chocolate-making spraytan goblins. Tbh, either way the citizens of New Eden come out on top
---
It's working as intended and has done since I can remember if your not piloting the ship it will have base stats when you look at it if you jump into the ship fill it to the brim and leave next time you look it will say 16.458m3/3900m3
---
also when a fleet catch a solo pilot they should let him go cause of fair fight ?
---
A hunting fleet in null who hunts pve caps is also a blob ?
---
Is it me, or are those big sov-holders getting even more free intel to keep the Spod flowing with more security?
---
Do I have to really convince you that I have kills? At least killmails should only include what dropped. At what point do you learn that there was a damage control onboard if it blows up with the ship?
---
VERA died long before PL...
---
this is why marketing majors should be shot on sight
---
Lol don't say that. I'm good at anticipating people's moves, thinking like a whale, researching game mechanics and using it to the best of my ability. But I'm actually a terrible pilot even after all these years. Notice (in the earlier sections of the vid) how I am killing that Rattlesnake in my proteus, while actually forgetting to point it.
---
Eve is wonderful because there is an aspect for everyone to master and self-actualize.
---
I'm with Bill Hicks on that.
---
Wow that’s low.
---
When people rather join the kids than the parents.
---
I have one account that was a bit of do everything until I found my way. I mainly do ganking / piracy and hauling on the side on one character. Security status is a bit of a pain but I make enough isk to fund my endeavors. Also don’t do mining.... I tried it and I almost quit EvE due to how mind numbing my boring it is. It might take you longer to accomplish your goals but it is doable. Just focus on one thing at a time and don’t try to do it all at once.
---
I can't add you to any ballot much less the goon ballot, I have no control over these things. You mistake me for somebody else.
---
I'm not sure if we have ever seen eye to eye olmeca. But, this was a great video :) PvP players should vote for your CSM campaign. I hope you're able to make some breakthroughs should you manage to get elected!
---
I did my first gank this week and f'ing loved it (the salt shall flow!). Obviously I know about CODE. - a guilty pleasure has always been minerbumping.com and I read it daily - but is there any other playstyles or groups of gankers in the game or has CCP killed them all off?
---
Do you have to have multiple accounts to gank? Most people seem to suggest you need a minimum of 3 or 4 omegas but I have to herd too many cats IRL to be that organised in game too.
---
Can you make enough ISK to fund ganks through ganking or do you have to find ISK in other ways too?
---
So good to hear that you're doing well and are fighting it &lt;3!
---
EVE helped me through some of the darkest times in my life too and thankfully I'm able to work on it now, which sometimes feels a bit ironic.
---
A big part of what kept me going when I was at my lowest wasn't the spaceships themselves (although they helped). It was the amazing people and the shared experience, running my corp and playing with people who've become some of the closest friends I've ever had.
---
The people are everything, and you're one of them. Keep fighting the good fight mate, and good luck with kicking the fuck out of cancer - sounds like you're doing an amazing job so far!
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
So, in summary, you lost a ship, and gave up.
---
Anyone joining RvB or any other highly active pvp organization can expect to lose ships...lots and lots of ships.  Especially if you're there to learn pvp.  
---
Try again, but this time bring at least 3-4 cheap reships to the staging area.  Ask questions on comms.  Reship and get back to fleet ASAP.  RvB doesn't do hand-holding well, that's true.  What it offers is a place to learn by flying, without being yelled at, and advice when it's asked for.  That's not a style or fit for everyone, but those high membership numbers means it works for many.
---
Well the problem is that this change removes the exploration part from exploration, cheapening the experience and forcing people to use the agency, which blocks out 80% of the screen. Besides that its intel tool that is bad for wh gangs, explorers trying to fly under the radar, etc. Its so stupid I cant even.... Furthermore, if data/relics are now easier to find, it means the same isk/h due to added supply. So no feeling of exploration, having to use the agency that breaks immersion is tedious and fills up half the screen (its not like we have anything else competing for screen real estate right?) and lower rewards per site due to it. On top of that safer nullsec leading to less destruction, and thus also negatively impacts the prices of both salvage gathered from relics, as well as being bad for mineral prices and plex inflation.  
---
Please tell me how these changes are in line with the spirit of exploration?  
---
For every Jesus feature a Judas feature apparently
---
Mate, me telling you that we don't have enough common ground shouldn't change your opinion about me. 
---
Looking at your platform, I just don't see enough common ground to vote for you. Meanwhile, if you looked at my platform, and wanted to give me the benefit of the doubt, me telling you that I wouldn't vote for you shouldn't change that.
---
Stop thinking about this politically. It's all for the good of the game. This is not a competition for a free trip to Iceland. Not to show everyone you're relevant. Not to derive a sense of importance.
---
Base your vote on principles you believe in, about what would be good for the game. Not who you're friends with.
---
Yeah just got the email. Hope they have a sub sale or reduce the amount of plex to sub would be nice.
---
Something tells me you haven't looked at my platform...
---
This type of marketing is illegal in most civilized countries
---
Any idea on how that roadmap is coming along? Or even on being told who's in charge these days?
---
I really have to sympathise with anyone who has been in the CSM these last couple of years. It looks from the outside like a number of bloody heads have been caused by CCP's brick walls...
---
Pretty much an average Friday night out in Reykjavik if you know where to partay.

No, there is not casual talk to add you to the ballot.
---
The 2 inch white one. Might as well stick to what I know.
---
Perhaps that was too strong. Let's say there are jokes about that.
---
Quote from Suitonia from the other thread on this:
---
&gt;I brought it up to the team responsible for this and gave my feedback and linked all the community threads, they said they would take it into consideration, seems like they decided to launch this without any changes, and are going to see what happens.   
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I highly recommend everyone who dislikes this change posts on the official eve online forums in the official Invasion feedback thread (if/when that thread goes up).
---
Exactly.  He has you labeled as someone who staunchly rides the "party line" for GSF.  I guess he doesn't realize that you are perfectly capable of thinking for yourself and tend to piss off the rest of GSF on the regular lol.
---
'please be shitter at what you do so I can kill you'
---
PL are just a jabber ping alliance just like NC.
---
Tbh when Elise, Jeff, Shamis and then Shadoo took a back seat PL just stopped being PL.  Garth was the beginning of the end and well Hardliner just simply the end...
---
I Miss those days when PL where the significant game changer but like NC. 
---
they became more about  Supers and Caps.
---
Now others have caught up and surpassed they've just become another alliance with high SP players.  But again now Skill injectors CCP soon fucked that too where experience and time spent in eve means completely fuck all nowadays...therefore they became irrelevant because they also had no one constantly mixing shit up.
---
Seems like it, especially when a WH rolls into one of their systems and they immediately know where and what it is.
---
can you math?
---
I know I'd hate getting my PVE ships blown out of space. But you, sir, work very hard at it. You demonstrate skill and ferocity, which this game allows you to take to new levels. This kind of professionalism deserves my praise.
---
PS: Sound mixing could be better. Good music but we had troubles hearing you at times.
---
PPS: If it was some female contralto narrating the entire thing, a myth and a legend would have been born today :)
---
PPPS: I intend to fly a Rorqual some day. I never AFK. Except when docked. Please, don't hurt me.
---
Just like the valentine's day "sale," ccp just mixed the "free" plex numbers up, it's not a real sale.
---
I did. 
---
My interpretation of it is as another Imperium candidate who pays more lip service to other playstyles due to him being at a low position in the bloc vote and needing outside voters. 
---
But you'd fail those playstyles where it really matters. Where their interests clashed with null mega empire interests. It's basically another Brisc case except he has the entire RL politician angle. Like him, I'm pretty sure you and I would agree on most problems of Eve, and would disagree on most solutions.
---
This kind of shit happens all the time.
---
CCP : "Please don't buy isk from third parties, its bad for business."  
---
Also CCP : "You're English, of course your plex prices should be like 50% higher than the rest of the world."  
---
Also CCP : Subscribe to the game with Plex! £16.99 for 1 month, or just pay £10 for 1 month anyway making this entirely pointless!  
---
Also CCP : Look at this HUUUUUGE Plex sale, Instead of 16.99, it's not 14.89   Whopping deals.  
---
Also CCP : Why are people buying isk from russians for 5 dollars a bil?
---
1 account is more than enough. Stop looking over the fence into your neighbour's yard. Just get good at each activity one at a time. Become an expert. It will all be more rewarding.
---
Right? "Imma just toss in an outdated euphemism for rape, that's the extra kick my medium article needs to win people over"

Thanks! This means a lot. I loved your content and was really upset to see you leave. o7
---
What?
---
The comfort trap. You think you want to suffer less but really you just want your suffering to mean more.
---
The music overwhelmed your voice at some points but overall this was an awesome video. It almost gave me a sense of a professional documentary.
---
The "you" there was addressed to "Goons" in general. Not you in particular. Sorry about the misunderstanding.
---
Yeap, they totally do, since main content creators started returning from hibernation
---
Russians. Looks like My Little Pony Industries (the remains of OOS) joined that alliance recently.
---
Remember scamming is a legitmate strat in EVE.
---
i want my praxis hit 400k ehp dual tanked
---
Bat Country was dead before they joined PL?
---
"Fleet me" implies someone inviting you to fleet, therefore "fleet" in this sense would be a verb. Which can then be used in context of "why do I even fleet with you guys". Or I think so, at least, I'm not well versed in english grammar shenanigans.
---
That being said, I've seen and heard "fleeting" used as "flying in fleet", so "why do I even fleet with you guys" isn't so far off.
---
Imagine caring if someone from an alliance you don’t like wants to run as CSM. I thought it was all about the game’s health and future ;)
---
At the end of the day we are all space Pixel nerds..
---
Big o7 to you and all good wishes to pod the cancer

Yeah and they are in Curse.

So much for mangos being anti-bot.  Number of people surprised:  Maybe 3?

This, a lot of this!
---
Choose your favourtie frigate (for the looks, weapons, kind of tank, whatever makes you prefer that ship over others) and go lose one after the other until you learn how to fly it and murder people with it.
---
They built a lot of the faction stations in Wicked Creek, 1L included my old home.
---
How the hell do you make isk pvping?
---
do you not live in America?
---
&gt;or to correct when people (Brisc) say things like "wormholers were never intended for long term living".
---
Brisc, if he said that, was quoting (or paraphrasing) CCP
---
As the Praxis is supposed to be linearly split due to the Jove line/lore, it would probably remain the same. Also, its a "special edition" ship (allegedly), so it doesn't really fall into the typical balancing meta.
---
Well, there goes the "wow look what I found" feeling for new players. All for the sake of... Krabs? I'm not sure who this benefits.
---
Get kill and you take the drops which sell for isk it's pretty simple
---
I still think Permaband could have won eurovision.  Well, before CCReee fired half of them.

So the pack that cost 99 before now costs 84 now and contains the same amount of PLEX... Please show your work, or you will get a failing grade...
---
lol love the attitude with rorqs
---
He said that in the CSM discord, either as his own words or words that he backs up. People linked it and talked about it a lot. It was infuriating and a breaking point for me. Not because the changes discussed (they gave us a new rolling module anyway) but any CSM should have known many of the emergent valuable playstyles of Eve are unintended by CCP.
---
Are you kidding me? That's pocket change.
---
There is one skill:
---
*Infomorph Psychology*
---
Bring it to 3 or 4 **and create all clones**
---
When back to Alpha, you can still use them to get araoung
---
EVE is just one big scam.

Join Dark Side! (we have cookies)

Alpha can use level 4 ship skills only
---
Alpha can use T2 small and medium weapons (and drones)
---
I look forward to seeing how this bites tapi in the ass down the road.
---
Member when they had actual sales?
---
This is amazing
---
They still finished behind Australia though. AUTZ best TZ.
---
And also give a titan to everyone for free
---
Wish you all the best, keep fighting!
---
Wait KWG was like 2-3% in botting/RMT perma bans. NC related stuff was like 16%
---
Shit that's a lot of bourbon...
---
I'm seeing around 15% off? 500 plex were normally about $20. now $16.99 ?
---
Lol, why is anyone surprised?  This is the way CCP works; have no clue about the game, put absolutely pants-on-head retarded feature on SiSi, everyone tells them its retarded, they release it anyway, more people quit and a year later they admit it was a problem.  Then they seem confused as to why the game is dying.

You want to get the hell out of that corp. They're hazing you, and *there are nicer corps out there that won't do that*. The corp you were in drove you out of EVE. Please come back, and instead of quitting EVE, quit the toxic corporation.

honestly, if you roam Esoteria and then roam the Detorid/Insmother pipe, it becomes really obvious why TEST is massively falling behind compared to FRT in terms of titans/supers/etc.

the amount of Rorquals you see going through the Detroit/Insmother area is insane and any time you fuck with their krabs, they are quite quick to form something to respond
---
going through Esoteria, it's far more inactive and unused, not nearly the same amount of Rorquals or the same tendency to form up to get rid of roamers. 
---
so all in all, TEST people who make that argument are idiots. I hate the EVE 2019 "meta" of massing rorqs and just building a shitload of supers/tits, but it feels a lot like FRT has embraced it better than TEST ever could
---
and both sides have bots out the ass
---
Still really bad
---
I think he’s Finnish, although he doesn’t look that Finnish imo
---
See when anom disappears and logically condclude that someone's crabbing? Then go to the system adjacent to the crabbed one and see what exactly they're doing
---
This is the type of play style that every pvper in EVE should be drooling over. The amount of pure dedication and intelligence to pull this off do the degree you have display here is absolutely mind boggling. I love the transparency in this video and you are spot on with everything. This is how eve is meant to be played.
---
I haven't noticed many bots in Test as a group, but KWG is like one of the top botting-only entities in the game. So those will be joined by another known botting group under TAPI's wing.
---
To be honest, I've been waiting to pick up a bunch of MPTCs for my rescue alts, and with the 2860 pack, I can buy 50 plex off the market, and have 6 MPTCs ready to go.
---
Didn't those stats include bans from long ago? 
---
So considering how long KWG have been around and how long NC. has rented out space the only real conclusion you can get from it is that renters bot a lot.
---
The current patch note reflect exactly the opposite if his statements.
---
Ok
---
DarkSide were ballers, people who don't know them haven't been around long enough. they were one of the strongest small-to-medium size PvP alliances from 2009-2013ish
---
hopefully they stick around and frag some shit
---
I feel like I've seen this post before. Just replace test with nc/pl and frt with goons and then the regions.
---
Or both.
---
Not fixed on Sisi.
---
Also CCP:  OMFG guys why is this game dying at record speed?  WE DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!
---
My math agrees with @Fuzzmiester.
---
I predict Sort will get less votes than the UK did in this years Eurovision song contest.
---
Even though he has been inhaling large amounts of goon dick lately and shielding his bot empire in Dek and Branch i don't think it will be enough to get him elected.
---
Tide pods.  Holy fuck.  People eat them all the time so they can't be that bad!  I don't mind them.  Willing to try it
---
Ideas for quick, low effort fixes from a CCP resources point of view is why you are on my CSM ballot.
---
So vote for one of the most logical solutions
---
When you first enter a system, you're invulnerable. During that time you should also be cloaked in local chat
---
This doesn't fix the other automated functions that CCP has allowed to spring forth, but it definitely helps make the game a bit more riskier than before
---
I kiss when plex was half off for a year
---
Well, Shit Olmeca Gold!  I remember seeing you whaling out in CE.  Great times, you bubbled my buddy and I in our 3 marauders.  That day didn't work out for you, but you have my vote \*3 today.
---
Reskinned Sansha invasions MK 3 (since the last one failed hard).  Whodathunkit that CCP was devoting tons of time and marketing towards...this.
---
can i bring a drake
---
It's great that CCP still hasn't patched this garbage out of the game.
---
Thanks for the video, very informative !!! !
---
Dexter is responsible for GC, Atlas, -A-, Explicit Alliance, MC and now BL for dying.
---
if ccp isn't going to take enforcement seriously it's in every alliances best interest to bot, otherwise they fall behind
---
not that it's a good thing, but if there's not going to be action by ccp then botting will continue to increase and those who bot will have a larger and larger share of the resources
---
Unironically, one of the strongest russian groups you could encounter back in the day (2010-2011?).
---
They became famous for their Drake fleets that shit on literally anything that tried to fight them. Drakes with links, Lachs, Huginns and Scimitars. All of which were still somewhat of a novelty.
---
I was on that fleet ~_~
---
you forgot MOA
---
ive been advocating this type of local for a while, it makes logical sense rather than some magical omnipresent know all mechanic
---
So nullbears will know when there's a wh in their space at any time?  Gay.
---
I did not read everything, but :
---
the raven is supposed to be a  sniper platform. You are not supposed to fit tank, keep those highs for sebo+MJD and those  cruise missiles will tear through ennemy (I guess that's the idea)
---
IMO the ships should be built around a very algorithmic approach.
---
* hull is a function of the mineral required to build it
---
* same for CPU/PWR/CAPA base stats (minimum + linear function of the minerals).(also target, etc.)
---
* Then the ship is chosen a main weapon bonus. This "main weap bonus" adds and remove some base stats. eg "missile" type gives more CPU, less capacitor.
---
* Same for secondary weapon. All battleships should use at least light drones as secondary weapon.
---
* Then the ship is chosen several tank bonus. It can be armor/hull/shield buffer/resist/cycleduration/repbonus. Every one of them should go with bonus and malus. In the case of the raven… it has no tank bonus :) .
---
* same with weapon bonus, then with slot bonus (base=5 for battleship). etc.
---
Then the T2 fit would use the base T1 fit and add bonus baed on T2 table (ADC, -95% torpedo, covert cloak, etc.)
---
Not in goons and not even in nullsec so well...
---
Wait whut? Story time, please and thank you.
---
just a stainguy post. he hates his life.
---
He is better than other canidates atm
---
*cough* sortdragon *cough*
---
"Technically", aren't they camped into HS anyway? :)
---
Create new character "None of the above."
---
Run for CSM.
---
Lore says ships broadcast system wide to allow for interfacing with the systems on the gates that relay your brains to your clone station when your pod blows, so it's not so much magical as already clearly explained in the lore
---
Just sayin
---
You twisted a lot of stuff around but ultimately it boils down to no, no one *deserves* content, just because you want it. You go find it, and if you can't then shit happens. There is no owed anything in this game except understanding from the devs if their game breaks objectively and you're interested in them looking at it to see if you should get your ship back. Not even owed it back. What kind of retards actually believe they're owed something just because they want it.
---
Since when do Sanshas are allowed at the Eurovision ?
---
More salvaging ships would be neat. It's a shame these are no intentions on these because it'd be great to have the Trigs fleshed out more and accessable as a "Elite" race so to speak.   
---
Small, Medium and Large Salvaging ships sound fun though. Beams that get better chance of salvage success the more you charge, dedicated salvage bays? Yis plz
---
&gt;so you're wrong
---
In your case, yes, or you are lying.
---
&gt;Most people already don't do this, so your change is pointless (ie makes no measurable impact)
---
The claim is that VPNs are used by botters. I believe this to be the case. The reason is they can distribute clients on many IPs.
---
&gt;you're trying to disprove what i'm saying by saying something unrelated
---
You are not saying much.
---
&gt;this is factually untrue, banning VPNs has no impact on detection of botters
---
If a botfarm runs 500 clients, how do they connect to eve?
---
&gt;let's do a small thought experiment: if CCP knows 100% of who uses a VPN and doesn't, why not just investigate VPNers of botting without banning them?
---
They likely dont, but if they did, there is information "lost" by allowing people to basically use any IP make a new account, and it also allows distribution of bots. At some point, it might be possible to ban an IP range because only bots use it. Any search based on clients per IP would show nothing. Banning VPNs would be one of the things done to clean up the game.
---
They were actually one of the very good pvp alliances in Curse.. then suddenly died.
---
BTW there were already request for CCP to add XLSE and 3200 . No answer.
---
Is Eve likely to switch the meta away from primarily very large groups in the coming year(s)?
---
I don't ask this to troll, I've been away for quite a bit now. I loved playing solo almost exclusively and preferred using cheap t1 ships like the Crucifier (non-NI) to get fun kills.
---
So I know full well that you \*can\* play solo / small gang in Eve.
---
But I left because it took an inordinate of time to just find people that weren't in large groups or under an umbrella - please keep in mind I took all kinds of dumb fights, I wasn't being picky. 
---
The meta when I left was heavily in favor of supers, carriers, etc. and a very large majority of players wouldn't leave "safe" areas - ever.
---
So my question is - is that just Eve? Or will the game change away from that meta in any meaningful way?
---
But Auz is upside down, so in fact we finished above them.
---
Mate that was my first ever blops drop, ever! I just had barely skilled in my Sin, still with JDC 4 etc. 
---
I remember internally debating whether I should drop a Sin on 3 marauders but the trap was too good to pass. 11/10 would drop again.
---
Stitch this is a severely flawed analysis. You cannot _possibly_ talk about comparing tanks without looking at fits or resists. That's insane. You're also ignoring the flavour benefits of shield vs armor such as front loaded reps, resists, passive eanms vs active invulns, etc. The raven you posted is solid renter tier as well and since it doesn't designed to fill a particular role, there's no such thing as a "gang/fleet" fit.
---
If you want to talk details I'd love to but you've just tried to distill one of the most complex subjects in EVE to cartoonishly simple version of itself.
---
tl;dr looking at raw HP in isolation is completely meaningless.
---
Use your free 7 days of Omega to vote for the CSM
---
Nuking someone for implicit racism = promotes racism? :O
---
Also: "Look at me, dad!"
---
Adding someone to our ballot just for the sake of diversity vs experience and merits isn't the best way to vote. Also there is no casual talk of adding you to the ballot, you need to check with that source as they are giving you misinformation.
---
Not if you know what to kill.
---
&gt; the raven is supposed to be a sniper platform. 
---
EVE is a sandbox and all ships are the sand. There is no specific fit a ship is "supposed" to be. The Raven has a range bonus, which also applies to torpedoes, which gives them better range/speed to hit targets with. While it is a capable sniper/cruise platform, that is not its only singular use.
---
&gt;  You are not supposed to fit tank 
---
Step away from nullsec only doctrines and PVE in wormholes where you sit at max range. Battleships are supposed to fit tank, they are ships of the line. One of the issues is their tank is lackluster at best compared to other options in the meta (especially t1 ships). Non sniping platforms like RHML and Torpedo fits do fit tank. Even other cruise fits that aren't going for max range fit tank.
---
&gt; keep those highs for sebo+MJD and those cruise missiles will tear through ennemy (I guess that's the idea) 
---
You would use Mids for SEBO+MJD. 
---
&gt; Same for secondary weapon. All battleships should use at least light drones as secondary weapon. 
---
Every battleships can use light drones, except maybe the Marshal since it doesn't have a drone bay
---
The rest of what you're saying is toocomplex and would change the fundamental basics of ship fitting/design in EVE for little benefit.
---
Cool and original post
---
Do you think there will be the usual gametime sale soon (not plex, just gametime)? Im about to run in 1 month and i am not able to afford the plex.
---
We did this when you could warp to the middle of the sun. Siege up when you land and you wouldnt stop for a good hour or 2
---
That depends on what you kill, what you fly and how often you die.
---
Many smaller groups have made their entire living off pvp, even if it’s always getting harder to pull off.
---
Honestly I couldn't guess, CCP used to have a pattern, but for the last 8 months or so, they haven't had one. I wouldn't expect a gametime sale before the end of Q3 2019, because their new pattern seems to be a sale of some kind around the end of each fiscal quarter. BUT there isn't really enough data to back that up, it's just a hunch.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
&gt;While it is a capable sniper/cruise platform, that is not its only singular use.
---
And I did not say it was. You do what you want with it, does not mean it's not \*supposed to\* be used in a specific way. replace "supposed to" with "designed for" if you want. 
---
The FACT is that the raven has a huge range bonus, which makes it \*supposed to\* be used at increased range. You can not advocate a change based on how you use a ship in a different way than it is \*supposed to\* be used. otherwise people can complain that the stealth bombers need more tank to make a correct use of smart bombs.
---
That could be viable for hunting botters but unless you're sitting 1 jump out with a prober heretic the information isn't that valuable.
---
Well those are Africanized npcs
---
Right after shield slaves
---
What do you think about the Tempest? A damage and a ROF bonus, and it barely holds up in the DPS department AND ehp department. And the utility is a joke when compared to the Leshak or Dominix.
---
After the past 5 or so years of their decisions, do you REALLY have to ask that?  Yes, of course they are.
---
Cause the right ammo would have saved him?
---
"highly anticipated" lol, most people don't care about Abyssmal shit
---
oh lmao it wont even work because anoms respawn now, will it?
---
Ok dude.
---
As a new player, what are good corporations I can join right now to help me get started? I had a friend who played a while ago in Pandemic Horde but we weren't sure what the current state of the corps was.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
In theory, maybe.  A lot of people (myself included) during the SiSi stress test actually had WORSE FPS than on live.  In a decent sized SiSi fight, my CPU/GPU were getting under 10% utilization yet I was sub-10 FPS regardless of settings.   Hopefully it has vastly improved since them.
---
How much is 500 plex worth in game?
---
Very appropriate username. I approve of your love of the Praxis, since I love it too.
---
2.2 bil
---
2.1b, give or take a few million on price fluctuation.
---
so which bots you rockin?
---
Hmm might be time to get some plex for that 2nd pilot training license.
---
I mean, the odds that release will be significantly different than beta are pretty small, soo
---
I sold 500 yesterday for 2.1b
---
Anoms dissapear for a while before respawning so you can probably use it to tell when a super is switching site, which might catch bots/max dumbos.
---
&gt; You cannot *possibly* talk about comparing tanks without looking at fits or resists.  
---
I listed an example with a fit and EHP. 
---
I listed HP stats because i was comparing all T1 ships HP values to the Leshak, which is also T1. This was to show that even though the Leshak is T1 (has the same/similar HP values as other T1 ships), with its HP focus in armor, it provides enough tank (without any tanking bonuses) to be capable in various ways against larger target or lots of dps.
---
&gt; You're also ignoring the flavour benefits of shield vs armor such as front loaded reps, resists, passive eanms vs active invulns 
---
You're getting hung up on the example. I could have gone through multiple examples, but it was a simple thought experiment. The Raven has the poorest buffer out of all shield battleships unless you dedicate all your mids to tank, this is due to how the HP is allocated. Simply adjusting HP gave it a 12% increase to EHP. Armor would be similar and most likely in the 15-18% range (due to higher average resists and better layout/utility). Is a 15-18% increase to armor battleships really going to break anything in the meta? No.
---
To add on to that, if you feel armor battleships would somehow gain too much of an advantage, then the changes can still be more conservative to keep the % increase comparable to shield. Nothing is set in stone on specific numbers. Again, they were examples.
---
&gt; The raven you posted is solid renter tier as well and since it doesn't designed to fill a particular role, there's no such thing as a "gang/fleet" fit. 
---
I outlined it wasn't optimized, it was an example of tank. It does fit a role, its a cruise sniper. Something i'd expect to see in home defense fleets (which i've fought before), or in a gang where you have tackle. Its very similar in operation to how i fly an arty machariel in small gang (get at range, shoot things while your tackle/support handles locking things down). I also have a torpedo kite raven for a small gang comp (Hyena/Anti-tackle support), and its only got \~58k EHP. I can showcase that one too if you'd like. Would still be the same effect of a \~12% increase to EHP. I could have just left launchers off of it if thats causing confusion, but i didn't want to see the comment about "its not a full fit and not realistic". Would of preferred if i removed the MJD/SEBO and put a point/web instead? It really doesn't matter what its "role" is, its an example of tank, not its combat capabilities.
---
I usually fight solo, so I've come to gather a good ammount of isk from loot, but that's hardly worth considering a decent isk source.
---
Then they should also not see local until they break cloak.
---
Tempest is actually really flexible and still has a bunch of utility. Its faster than the domi and has 2 heavy neuts without having to sacrifice weapons/dps. Can easily hit to 900 dps and with rigs/tracking enhancers can apply a good chunk of that damage out to 40-50km.
---
Its EHP is low because its minmatar and they tend to sacrifice EHP for speed/utility. 
---
Both the typhoon and tempest just feel like really big BC's, but they're super flexible, fast (for a BS) and good to have in a gang. Not great at fleets, but there are better options (mael/mach).
---
But first it swelled with smug euros who wanted a boosh into PL.
---
Not that im disagreeing. But I'm worried it would just push us into another cfc 2.0 but then again I guess force projection isn't as good as it once was.
---
What about XL on sun? L on planets, so on. Would you limit them to 1 per celestial?
---
The triglavian salvage ship would make a pretty nice looking drone, if scaled down.
---
Faster travelspeed while 'closed up', slower when 'opened up' and need some time to get ready for shooting or whatever. \^\^
---
I don't like you on a personal level since the BB incident but this is some awesome shit and you prop also will have my vote for CSM because of your play style. +++
---
A range bonus is a range bonus. That range bonus applies to both torpedoes and cruise missiles. Do you need at 100km with torpedoes? No, however, it does increase the base range of torpedo's to hit past point range. It helps all weapon systems fill different roles, its not an indicator of what that ship is "supposed" to do. You can fit RHML to a Raven too and get a decent brawler and it doesn't even use the range bonus.
---
I think you will find i will get ranked lower than not on that list
---
Darn, it was 1.5bil last year
---
&gt;Where do people figure out if there ship is good enough to tackle X activity? Like missions or pvp or ratting. I enjoy trying messing with the ghost fittings but don't know if anything I come up with is useful.
---
The test server is a great place to try stuff out.
---
Hord, Karmafleet, and Brave Newbies are all good corps if you are interested in null. EVE University solely focused on teaching, and has activities everywhere but sov null. Signal Cartel is also a good place to go if you enjoy exploration, though they strictly forbid initiating PvP from their side. There are no piratically good groups for FW  LS unfortunately, but most corp active in FW will happily show you the ropes if you are interested as a new player, just ask around. WHs are in a similar place, assuming you don't want to join the WH portion of a group like E-Uni of Signal Cartel.
---
Except profitability will go down, more supply, and a bit less ships dying in null, thus less demand for salvage
---
&gt; Do you need to be at 100km with torpedoes? No, 
---
And I did not say it did. Whether you like it or not, it has a 50% bonus to range so it is supposed to shoot from 50% further.
---
This bonus comes at a price of having lower HP bonus on the shields(0).
---
Just because you want to use it with torpedoes does not mean it's not supposed to be a sniper (yeah, 50% bonus range means sniper). It just means you are a complete idiot who wants to complains a fork does not cut the meat.
---
A lot depends on what you consider to be "profitable." Are you trying to plex your account as well as support YOLO-PVP purely with gameplay? That is going to take a lot of time. With the rising price of ISK, it's actually worse now than it was years ago. The most efficient way to go about this is do literally anything IRL to earn $35, then buy the subscription and plex for ISK. Spend your game time doing what you actually enjoy and don't worry about making it profitable. It's entertainment. The moment you treat it like a job, you're losing on multiple levels.
---
That being said, playing with multiple accounts has its benefits, especially if you find it impossible to make even small amounts of income IRL. You can still get by with a single account, though. If you can train an alt into incursions, for example, or just about any industry activity, you can keep them on the same account as your PVP main. Personally I don't often play industrial activity on multiple accounts simultaneously because I just don't find it fun. Any activity I can do AFK probably isn't worth my gaming time. I've had as many as six accts running simultaneously for capital move ops or fleet reconnaissance, though, because it's both necessary for the task at hand and because it's actually fun to juggle it all in those cases.
---
Of course
---
no michael this is emergent and exciting gameplay!
---
&gt;Whether you like it or not, it has a 50% bonus to range so it is supposed to shoot from 50% further.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This bonus comes at a price of having lower HP bonus on the shields(0)
---
A Rokh gets a 50% range bonus and it is a Sniper, and it also has about 3k more HP than a Raven and a resist bonus
---
Where is the Rokh's sacrifice in comparison to the Raven? If as you say, all sniper ships get less tank, how come the Rokh gets so much extra tank?
---
Enlighten me, how could such an obvious contradiction escape such keen eyes.
---
15% is shit, this will not change the price of plex or plex derived items in game at all.
---
did I say the rokh was correct ?
---
well, lets wait and see what the statistics from CCP will show. Peligro said he will publish the yearly ban statistics. then we will see who are the active botters and who not. (Frat. was on the top on the all-time one, despite, their botting alliance being the youngest of all)
---
 I see moving goal posts. 
---
Was a nice chat, i'm done though if you're going to say one thing and then completely make up your own rules.
---
If you are solo you need at a minimum  2 accounts, one to kill the target and a second to scoop the loot. In a group you can get away with 1. The only other group I know of is a Goons SIG (I don't remember their name), though there are many solo gankers out there. Ganking can be wildly profitable, anything from hitting T1 haulers on a station undock with a single nado, to hunting freighters with 20 catalysts. You can even gank abyssal runners for good ISK if you are patient enough to hunt down the profitable ones. A good way to manage multiple accounts is [EVE-o Preview](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-o-preview-v4-0-1-quatrus-ii-multi-client-preview-switcher-2018-04-04-beta-2019-05-05/4202). ISBoxer also work, but keep in mind that input broadcasting is a banable offence, so leave that option turned off. If you want to go solo, I recommend starting ganking haulers on a trade hub such a Jita as you only need 1 ganking character. From there you can move to hunting bling mission runners as it still is relatively light on the number of characters needed (though as with any ganking, Catalysts ar the best ISK/Damage, so if you can do a gank with just them it will be more profitable then just using Talos's or Tornadoes.)
---
So why hide the system, but don't hide the system squad in fleet?
---
He is not omnipotent and cannot ban all of them.
---
Because you outnumber them approximately 4 to 1?
---
Says the idiot who makes up his own rules.
---
"Raven is bad because I say so". Raven just does not fit your vision. I don't say it's good ; I say you are blind and can't judge it with those eyes.
---
Then you are the one making strawman left and right.  I did not say a fucking word on how the rokh is or not correctly tank balanced, yet you are affirming so. That is just pure retard from you, after the "but raven can be used in other ways" that implies I said they can't.
---
They are botting out the ass already so I'm sure it won't take long
---
Its actually a good thing imo, its good for roaming gangs as they have a way to get loot safe.
---
Why don't we help these tri guys to destroy New Eden so we can win Eve?
---
yup, IGC Gilas all over the old botting pocket in Feythabolis
---
Yep. Always will be inflation on plex it seems of about 20-40% over the course of a year.
---
Yep. Always will be inflation on plex it seems of about 20-40% over the course of a year. If you're taking a break from the game, buy all the plex ya can and you'll be better off when ya come back.
---
This change gives no more information than most big blocs have been parsing through intel bots and players using 3rd party tools. In fact, it's much less, yet every time someone brings up trying to change an aspect that would nerf that, Reddit would explode with downvotes and complaints howling about how the change is not needed, it's dumb, etc. Much the same as it is now
---
That's my concern. I hope it's just not another trivial mob addition.
---
&gt;because your only option would be fight constantly, which no one wants
---
But... but... I want that...
---
Bruh, he's right. Ships are just platforms. What you do with the platform is up to you.
---
"Dorkness"
---
I could get behind this
---
Or we could just unanchor all the citadels in the area before they arrive
---
&gt;I want 3-4 unsupported alts in supers to not be the standard solution to every problem in null.
---
/u/ccp_falcon
---
Rokh has range bonus too, yet it's also one of the highest base HP battleships, with even a resist bonus.
---
They used to go dunking on nerds all around null. I remember living in Deklein way back in the day, I'd get giddy any time I saw Flesh Rocket in local because I knew we were about to have a stupid crazy scrap.
---
&gt; I listed an example with a fit and EHP.
---
You listed a single fit, a bad one, with no real context of who or how it would be used or what it's supposed to do.
---
&gt; This was to show that even though the Leshak is T1 (has the same/similar HP values as other T1 ships), with its HP focus in armor, it provides enough tank (without any tanking bonuses) to be capable in various ways against larger target or lots of dps.
---
The leshak's tank isn't actually very good btw. It's just slightly on the higher end for T1 armor BS but nothing note worthy. It's primary attribute is that it does 2500 DPS, everything else about it is quite mediocre. I also know a lot of people in WH space were keen to do shield versions of it but it's not really viable because of the exact hp layout you're advocating for. Off the top of my head of things I know people have actually shield with some success:
---
* Shield bhaalgorns
---
* Armor ravens
---
* Armor scorpions
---
* Hull domis
---
* Hull mega
---
* Tempest both armor and shield
---
* Shield Nestor
---
* Shield vindi
---
* Armor and shield machariels
---
* Armor nightmares
---
* Armor and shield barghests
---
* Also obviously Praxis
---
That's just "Battleships" in the T1 sense. Every blops has a viable armor tank too. Pinning things into shield or armor ruins a lot of options.
---
I'm also not quite sure where you got this "tanks 1-2 capitals" figure because that's so vague. I mean what are we talking about, a shit fit chimera with t1 fighters or a glass cannon haw dread?

&gt; You're getting hung up on the example. I could have gone through multiple examples, but it was a simple thought experiment. The Raven has the poorest buffer out of all shield battleships unless you dedicate all your mids to tank, this is due to how the HP is allocated. Simply adjusting HP gave it a 12% increase to EHP.
---
I'm not getting hung up on the example, I was talking about armor/shield. Armor has the benefits of a better spectrum of bling tank mods, utility mids, slave sets, the ability to sacrifice DPS for tank and of course signature. Shield on the other hand has the benefits of typically higher DPS, generally better resists, invulns giving you a more slot efficient tank than eanms, better speeds, and the ability to deck out hp with PDS's.
---
You ignored every single one of these when talking about the armor raven and went "uh smaller tank number".
---
You're also ignoring that the Ravens poorer buffer also lines with it having by far the greatest effective range of any battleship in the form of range and damange bonused cruise missiles.
---
&gt; Is a 15-18% increase to armor battleships really going to break anything in the meta? No.
---
18% on Snuff's signature machariel fit is 75k EHP. 18% is more than the difference in tank between an Avatar and Erebus. 18% is almost the difference in tank between a Hurricane and a Ferox. That's an enormous difference on the right stat.
---
I'm not quibbling over details, I'm just pointing what a naive statement "oh 15-18% would probably be fine" is.
---
&gt; I outlined it wasn't optimized, it was an example of tank. It does fit a role, its a cruise sniper. Something i'd expect to see in home defense fleets (which i've fought before) ...  Would of preferred if i removed the MJD/SEBO and put a point/web instead? It really doesn't matter what its "role" is, its an example of tank, not its combat capabilities.
---
Then why use it as a point of discussion? You're trying to talk about a ship using an idiot renter tier fit. What you should really be doing is looking at best in breed. How are [C0ne using to fight Snuff in Pure Blind?](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007284/ship/638/losses/), how do [INIT use them in boosh comps](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1900696668/ship/638/losses/). What fits do people use successfully to solo with them? How do these fits work? How are they FC'd/flown? Do they require absolutely require certain support ships? Do some real research on it.
---
Again I'm not getting hung up on details, I'm just pointing what an immense array of considerations there are to be had against what you proposed in the article. You're drawing a conclusion on a broad topic with even scratching the surface of details impacting it.
---
Am I alone in thinking CCP is doing the minimal EULA bot enforcement to save enough face that its "doing something" while profiting from the remaining botters who are a liable and semi predictable Plex consumer.
---
A dominix uses drones that can be defanged, has significantly less damage and is generally application focused. A leshak is 3x the price.
---
lmao the irony of that post
---
Do you still play?
---
of course not. but the relative numbers from where the bots were banned is more or less the relative amount the bots come from. Even if he only catches a sliver of the bots..
---
Except of course, you say that he has a blind eye on certain groups?!
---
&gt;The claim is that VPNs are used by botters. I believe this to be the case. The reason is they can distribute clients on many IPs.
---
This is correct, however most botters do not utilize VPNs as CCP's detection is based solely on botter uptime.
---
&gt;If a botfarm runs 500 clients, how do they connect to eve?
---
The majority of bot farms run no where near 500 clients.
---
The majority of bot farms run 10-20 or fewer.
---
I don't think a single person utilizes over 100 bots at any given time. (I know one guy who does 100)
---
&gt;They likely dont, but if they did, there is information "lost" by allowing people to basically use any IP make a new account, and it also allows distribution of bots.
---
It allows the distribution of bots, but does not make the detection of bots easier. For the 50th time.
---
&gt;At some point, it might be possible to ban an IP range because only bots use it.
---
And this is nigh impossible, as there are hundreds of thousands of IP ranges used by VPNs.
---
&gt;Any search based on clients per IP would show nothing. Banning VPNs would be one of the things done to clean up the game.
---
And ban thousands of legitimate players in the process. unacceptable.
---
No it's not. If you want your loot safe, get your ship with loot back home.
---
Haven’t played in a bit, is one plex still one month? Can I get 500 months for 17$??!
---
botting is as much a negative as a positive for CCP, it detracts from plex sales at some level, but increases pcu (not in a good way)
---
For me, this is the greatest eve video I've seen.
---
Jeeze.. I've been in and out of the game for a long time.. I remember when even seeing a titan worked up a full chub. The proliferation of Titans is honestly kind of a downer as someone who started playing this game in 2004. Like.. what's the point anymore? Everyone's got a giant space penis. CCP needs to pull a  Blizzard and release an EvE Classic, a fresh start before Fozziesov, before T3s, before skill injectors, before all of this alien triglavian weird shit. Back when you could count the number of Titans in the game on your fingers. This game truly is dead.
---
So what ?
---
The raven is a better sniper platform, which it trades for being a worse brawler platform. Now you can do whatever you want with that platform. But don't complain it's a worse brawler platform.
---
Nope, plex is a currency now. 500 plex = one month.
---
No, 500 plex is 1 month now.
---
No, 500plex = 1mo
---
I wont say "You only think you want that" cos that's pretentious as fuck, what I will say is actually think about it for a second, what would life be like practically if you logged into EvE and had PvP 24/7 on your door step, sounds cool I know, but walk through it for a moment, what do you do when you'v had your fill of PvP, it's not like you can just go chill out and mine, or rat, or explore because while your done for the day and looking to relax other people are just getting on and looking for that dank killmail.
---
So if space was reduced a lot so that everyone was in each others face all the time simply ratting and mining or hauling PI or hauling anything for that matter would become a total nightmare, there wouldnt be any down time, walk through this hypothetical a little more, where are all the ships and modules coming from, where are all the miners who provide the stuff to actually fly or shoot, their not out in space gathering resources because its suicide, jesus think of people like Marshy with his 500 clients, reduce space enough and hes suddenly able to camp the whole universe ( its a hypothetical just go with it )  , and hes not the only one doing this there are lots of people doing this, so you would have to factor in and compound the effect they also have on industry.
---
It's just not a good idea.

Great video. Wish I could see more like this.

This is the most braindead post.

I’m a new player and I had an idea for a relatively passive way of making ISK and want to know if this would work as an Alpha Clone.
---
I’d make a corporation, and put a small tax on it. Then I’d go out and recruit many people, and then sit back and let them do the work for me. I’d use the taxes for personal gain by transferring the corporation’s funds to myself.
---
Would my plan work? How would I recruit people? And will this provide a steady amount of income, as an Alpha? Thanks :)
---
Love you bro and we're here for you.
---
I think you should have to jump through personally.
---
Why would people join your corporation if you're going to do nothing but take money from them? Taxes are usually used for stuff that benefits the whole group, such as structures or SRP. Your idea might work as a scam, but you'd have to actively recruit new people every day, and that sounds like more work than ratting. 
---
&gt;How would I recruit people?
---
I hope you don't. This thread is meant to help new people, and you're asking us how to hurt new people.
---
Do you think its possible they will put sale before the new content?
---
This is what I said on my own answer, but he just does not understand that there is more than raw HP on a ship…
---
Join in game channel 'the beehive'  there are alpha pvp fits you can use. I'd buy 10 thrashers and go crazy
---
In this case, my idea involves building a community. The tax will be very low, almost not noticable (1-3%). It’ll be more of a casual, do-whatever-you-want corp than most corporations. And no other method seems to work for me in order to make ISK.
---
This, citadel spam, timers being shitty, how much longer will all of these things be ignored? It shouldn't take years and years to address these things.
---
&gt; what would life be like practically if you logged into EvE and had PvP 24/7 on your door step 
---
I'm a Predditor, that's exactly what my life in this game is.
---
Specialization is key. Do your favorite part and little else and when that changes, change with it.
---
Or we let they burn empire to make empire drop they're giant titan... When they are on battle we steal they and we reto enginering to masse produce they.
---
yup, so where do you buy your ships, your ammo, and whos gona provide that when your current stockpile runs out because of the above situation..
---
you need to look at the bigger long term picture.
---
Is there any loot difference in abyssal types? I mean will dark and exotic bring same loot\ISK ? Or some types are more profitable?
---
&gt; They care enough about QA that the servers are mostly stable on a daily basis. If they didn't care about QA, the game would've died 10 years ago, after people mass quit after the servers don't boot properly day after day.
---
&gt; 
---
Then let's talk about how chat update was pushed despite being unstable as hell and as been a constant issue since 1 year
---
You're assuming that constant war means money can't be made and industry can't function. That's a mistaken impression. It does mean that the cost of doing business will get higher, but if my time as a space terrorist has taught me anything it's that krabs are gonna krab come hell or high water. No matter how many times I drop a fleet of bombers on that fucking VNI pilot he's still going to go back out again later that day.
---
He's not?
---
I can’t wait for the 64 bit version
---
kick suad
---
So *evecom* doesn't ring a bell?
---
F for the angry and emotional pubbie
---
The hell are these comments, a bunch of skinhead edgelord basement dwellers with painted on swastika tats?
---
Nah, this isn't what eve's like. That discord IS generally a shithole.
---
They're too busy posting nazi shit to undock, you mean?
---
Jesus christ no. For the sake of eve no.
---
That's most of what they used to do too tbf.
---
&gt;This is correct, however most botters do not utilize VPNs as CCP's detection is based solely on botter uptime.
---
They dont appear to have any automated detection, but even if they did, VPNs would help to circumvent it.
---
&gt;I don't think a single person utilizes over 100 bots at any given time. (I know one guy who does 100)
---
The point was to show how VPNs make detection harder.
---
&gt;It allows the distribution of bots, but does not make the detection of bots easier. For the 50th time.
---
Wrong. The distribution of bots is a way to avoid detection.
---
&gt;And this is nigh impossible, as there are hundreds of thousands of IP ranges used by VPNs.
---
Thats why you ban VPNs so people are forced to use a much smaller IP pool. I could probably find and ban 90% of the public VPNs in less than an hour if I really wanted to. Then you check how many use hosting providers IP ranges.
---
&gt;And ban thousands of legitimate players in the process. unacceptable and moronic
---
That will not happen if you can see where bots are coming from. VPNs hide that.
---
2 accounts. More of you dont pay to play
---
Oh jesus that's not good.
---
Not what I suspected but I get your logic
---
I can't upvote enough these comments.
---
I think Stitch is good pilot, no doubt, but his experience is kinda focused on small gang / solo stuff.  His perspective is based on that, so no wonder his analysis has flaws.
---
I guess we just don't agree, red fleet's start moving our rorquals dock, not all but a lot, those that stay out its only a matter of time till you see their name flag in fleet and then the cap umbrella comes out to try and save them, at this point most of the rest of the rorquals now also dock, some just cos the risk isnt worth it and others cos they now need to undock in a cap to save their buddy.
---
Some times status goes green fairly quick and rorquals will once again undock, but some times it can be a while before this happens, during that time very few people if any are mining.
---
And thats now. imagine in our hypothetical where people are just everywhere thers a constant risk of being dropped covering every hour of the day, even if rorqual pilots undock, just how long are our FC's gona be able to manage a 24/7 fight situation before they burn out, how long would it be with burnt out FC's on all sides before alliances just cave or blue the people around them.
---
I mean we really dont know what would happen, everything I am suggesting is just my opinion, and I totaly understand how for a pure PvP player all this PvP might sounds cool, but in reality I think it would be terrible for all involved after a very short period of time.
---
that really depends on the perspective tho, they think that they are the ones above
---
If wormholes can figure out a single candidate they agree on and promote them, that candidate will get a ton of nullsec votes.
---
\&gt;  With the new changes exploration is automated too.    
---
I've been out of the game for awhile, what changes are you talking about?
---
Who is not what ?
---
que ?
---
I feel like this post captures the spirit of the EvE community really well:
---
Divided in New Eden, but united by a shared world in IRL.
---
To the OP all the best with your recovery, sound like you’ll smash it and see you in fleet.
---
That's, quite a few words
---
Fun fact - guy in the mask with purple spikes is the son of Icelands former ambassador to the UK.
---
KWG = renters
---
In case nobody has answered yet, no, 500 plex = 1 month
---
What i find hilarious is we cleaned up KWG.  Throughout the last month or two they have barely been active and those active are real accounts with people ratting and not botting "real easy to tell the difference".  Unlike most sov null allliances who claim to hunt bots, we have several small groups that actually hunt them down for fun.  KWG if they choose to bot again will be killed by Tapi members regardless of blue status. 
---
But i guess you needed some reddit karma or something.
---
Mega blocks spread out is still better than mega blocks as is.
---
Even if you just forced any supercap power into spreading out into 3-4 smaller supercap umbrellas it looks a lot more viable and puts more risk of a dreadbomb actually working.
---
It’s not supposed to. CCP wants money.
---
I have not been playing for more than 2 years but when the time comes, you have my vote :)
---
You know, that's an interesting compromise.  
---
You can still use d-scan, so some systems with gates near moons, or smaller systems where random sites have a higher chance of being in d-scan range of the gate, would be more risky than larger systems.  
---
Then the geography (stellography?) of the system comes into play even more.  
---
Another idea might be to have people who have been detected by nearby gates show up in local while they're in range of the gate and/or warping, and for X number of minutes after being detected. Probing them down should also cause them to appear in local. Though, that would be a major buff to cloaky cyno ships, since they could go silent and drop out of local and still be in d-scan range, so perhaps counter that by making them probeable? Perhaps not a direct warp signature, but lets you warp to a random spot somewhere in a 50km sphere around their location?  
---
Basically, the idea is to balance things, and lean towards the side of "active" actions in game being needed to counter the other side.
---
This guy is woke.
---
Should develope a counter strategy to your posting instead....
---
100% 
---
The analysis stitch made is great in a vacuum or from just a solo or maybe even small gang POV.  There are a lot of flaws with it by introducing everything else in the game to his examples because eve isn’t a vacuum of course.
---
That will be the cancer, rotting out PH from the inside.
---
Ohh that would be nice
---
How will you know that EVE is truly dying?            
---
Simply CCP will start to downsize the universe to cut costs....
---
Probably not, half the people seem to be playing reddit if anything..
---

What do you say? Notice me senpai :)

Also basically inventors or atleast popularizers of some doctrines for example perma mwd drakes, drakes+ arty tempests and rail nagas
---
Use there currently a salve going on?
---
it doesn't take advanced statistics to know that Kids With Guns is nearly entirely bots, and that it doesn't exist for further purpose
---
I use to hate goons for some reason. When I started, they we re the big bad empire. Everyone hated them. I didnt need to know why, it was a common enemy.
---
As I played the game more, I started to witness how those outside of goons treated others. At some point, we recruited some goon alts/former goons to play with us, and honestly, they have been our longest standing bro's/friends.
---
Even though most have moved on, we still play games and hang out on discord all the time.
---
It's true from my experience, goons treat those they play with... not so much respect... but a focus on the group, instead of themselves.
---
&gt; You listed a single fit, a bad one, with no real context of who or how it would be used or what it's supposed to do. 
---
As mentioned, it was a small gang/sniping cruise raven. I didn't think i need to give a multi-page long thesis on how that would work. It was an example fit. I even specifically mentioned it could be optimized by dropping the MWD for more tank and leaving just the MJD or you could even go full 7 mid tank, but i was trying to avoid that because there are other fits out there, other than those that use all 7 mids on tank with no prop. If i had put in the fit like the one from C0ne you listed, then i'd get someone else telling me how the fit is shit cause it has no prop. Kind of a lose/lose situation just by making an example.
---
However, if you want to use C0ne's raven example found [here](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76893859/). Its base EHP (before links), is 113k EHP. Which is 9 tank mods in total. Changing the HP values like i mentioned brings its EHP up to 122k EHP. So a 9k EHP increase. Its actually less than a 12% increase due to the EM rig/extender rig difference between fits. In total it gained about 8% more EHP. My fit had about 7% more EM resist, and by adding more shield HP to the HP pool, higher overall resist is going to equal a higher total EHP which is why there is a discrepancy.
---
&gt;Shield bhaalgorns  
---
&gt;Armor ravens  
---
&gt;Armor scorpions  
---
&gt;Hull domis  
---
&gt;Hull mega  
---
&gt;Tempest both armor and shield  
---
&gt;Shield Nestor  
---
&gt;Shield vindi  
---
&gt;Armor and shield machariels  
---
&gt;Armor nightmares  
---
&gt;Armor and shield barghests  
---
&gt;Also obviously Praxis
---
Bhaalgorn, Nestor, Vindi, Mach, Nightmare, Barg are not T1 ships and i even *specifically* stated that the HP changes to those ships would be much more conservative for the very fact you're pointing out. As seen below, this is what i said in the article:  
---
&gt; The same principle would also need to be applied to Navy and Pirate battleships, but probably with a softer touch. Especially on Pirate battleships as they are used in all manner of fittings, but a conservative approach to moving hitpoints around could still be done. 
---
I also touched on the Tempest and said this:  
---
&gt; For Minmatar, as their design philosophy is flexibility and being able to utilize either shield or armor, i’d probably go for removing some hull HP and maybe shifting some shield into armor (since both the Typhoon and Tempest are primarily armor tanked).  
---
For the scorpion:
---
&gt; With ECM being changed, I feel like now is a good time for CCP to finally tweak the T1 scorpion and actually provide it with some combat bonuses. I think the ECM strength bonus should remain, but it should lose the optimal range bonus and gain a damage bonus of some kind so Caldari can actually have a proper line-up of combat battleships like every other race. Alternatively, remove the ECM range bonus and give it a tank bonus to better support the new ECM mechanics. 
---
I also touched on the armor raven as well.
---
&gt; Yes, in this example, it would nerf the armor raven, but the armor raven exists because the shield fit is so pitiful and also because its performing a very specific role. Which, let’s be honest, if an armor MJD raven gets in range to be primaried, it’s going to die anyway. 
---
Which goes along with fits like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76288632/). Yeah, its going to lose several thousand EHP, but its already only got 32k HP(potentially under reps) already. I'd rather have a stronger shield tanked ship, that is part of the primarily shield tanked race than make exceptions for a niche, super specific armor fit (that will still work after these changes, because its still going to die if something gets in range to primary it, just like it does now).
---
Praxis is a special edition ship and follows Jove lore, its not a T1 ship technically and has a different resistance pattern than T1 ships. I don't count it as something that would fall within this adjustment.
---
Not to sound like a dick, but did you actually read the article? I addressed all of those concerns/ships. Maybe not to to the details/expectations you wanted, but i am aware of their existence and many fits.
---
&gt; That's just "Battleships" in the T1 sense. Every blops has a viable armor tank too. Pinning things into shield or armor ruins a lot of options. 
---
BLOPS are T2 and not part of the HP refactoring. They are intended to have weak tanks as they sacrifice tank for jump drives. The HP stats all included T1 battleships in the article, no where did i reference T2  HP stats as they weren't part of the comparison.
---
&gt; You're also ignoring that the Ravens poorer buffer also lines with it having by far the greatest effective range of any battleship in the form of range and damange bonused cruise missiles. 
---
 If we are talking effective range with weapons, the Rokh can easily shoot to/farther than the Raven and gets instant damage along with 2.5k more buffer and a resist bonus. It does do less damage than the Raven though at that range. For missile battleships, the RNI and Barghest would be comparable/more damage than the raven, but their faction/pirate so i won't include them as direct comparisons.
---
&gt; 18% on Snuff's signature machariel fit is 75k EHP 
---
Again, that is a Pirate battleship, one that is not going to be heavily effected by these HP changes. As the focus was primarily around T1 battleships as per the chart/table in the article.
---
&gt; Then why use it as a point of discussion? You're trying to talk about a ship using an idiot renter tier fit. 
---
Because its a good median fit to show an example. Its a middle ground fit that people can find familiarity with on either side of the aisle (fleet or small gang). Otherwise i get situations like what you're bringing up where i didn't choose the biggest/best fleet fit, or I didn't choose the best small gang/solo fit. Its a compromise as the article is directed at all people, not just fleet doctrines. Which apparently, its not a median fit since I still get  that i didn't choose an "ideal" fit.
---
Don't get me wrong, i understand where you're coming from, but you are misinterpreting that i'm going to nuke a bhaalgorns shield to 2k HP when i have no intention on touching or adjusting pirate ships drastically. The original comparison was between the Leshak and other T1 battleships because they're all T1 and the Leshak tank works. Small gang/solo guys (ask Hydra or fellow Tusker pilots i fly with) know that the Leshak can tank a carrier/capital on its own, it can also tank/kill supers with logi pretty easily as well without major escalation.
---
&gt;red fleet's start moving our rorquals dock, not all but a lot, those that stay out its only a matter of time till you see their name flag in fleet and then the cap umbrella comes out to try and save them, at this point most of the rest of the rorquals now also dock, some just cos the risk isnt worth it and others cos they now need to undock in a cap to save their buddy.  
---
&gt;Some times status goes green fairly quick and rorquals will once again undock, but some times it can be a while before this happens, during that time very few people if any are mining.
---
Respectfully, as someone in my own alliance, what you are describing are the symptoms of the cancer that is killing Eve. This is a playstyle that encourages risk aversion, supplemented by pervasive intel and a supercap umbrella. The cancer isn't new, but it metastasized and grew out of control when Excavators were introduced and Rorqs became the premiere way to make money. It's not a good thing.
---
There should never be a time when it's "safe" to mine or "not safe" to mine. You should always be risking horrible, bloody death when you undock in your space dildo. You should be forced to incorporate combat drones and combat mods to fend off bandits rather than being able to just dock up and hide behind a station and a supercap umbrella. (Side note - I've seen this in practice and it's actually pretty cool.)
---
Train cybernetics to level 4 and buy a set of +4 training implants for one of your clones. You can still use the implants after the omega time expires.
---
Otherwise it's just double training time for a week, you haven't got time to do a whole lot.
---
Problem is, i'm already doing that. I'm running passive gila in raging gamma and i need cap only for my one adaptive shield resist.
---
This guys an idiot but the fact you can say that without irony is fuckign brilliant. 
---
Fucking absolute morons.
---
This is just epic and the message is spot on. If only your alt accounts could sit in the CSM I would vote for them just to keep goons out. Fuck meta, embrace skill.
---
Bots dont have brains
---
for the record I dont mine much, like at all. but I know where the minerals for the stuff I fly comes from, and the last thing I want is a situation where they just stop playing the game because their proffered playstyle is wiped out with the above change.
---
when ccp introduced the mining rorqs they forgot to triple the amount of minerals in every single blueprint ...
---
I too can edit webpages
---
Just in case it wasn't clear, for 500 PLEX, you get 1 month of premium gametime
---
A 180 as in turning around 180 degrees, not 180 members.
---
yeah the number of rorqs there are insane.
---
if you want to see, just fly from GB-6X5 to CR2-PQ and spam dscan. 20-30+ rorqs in each system.
---
Noted. Consider "you" in that to apply to anyone in that situation.
---
I know other people put their opinions in, but what they meant to say was that it's five hundred plex for one month.
---
I'm sorry you don't like facts, but it is a matter of fact that when CCP created wormhole space, they never expected or intended that it would be "inhabitable", and they have said so. 
---
&gt;but any CSM should have known many of the emergent valuable playstyles of Eve are unintended by CCP.
---
Well it seems that you're angry that he *did* know this.
---
some non-english people still consider "farmers" as another term for "botters" instead of "krabbers" or w/e
---
but yes botters.
---
fuck kwg
---
It almost never happens, the issue is also not that you are aware the holes it's that you get a warning when a new one shows up this is more time pressure on the hunters, especially in regions that have the intel sorted it's like you get a minute at best before you up on Intel now you get less because if you jump into an empty system a new sig popped, this means you now get a minute from when you enter the hole rather then from when you get spotted in local, given the majority of null systems are empty this matters.
---
Where?
---
Yep, drop the music level next time.  You have good and interesting things to say so it would be good to have that the focus.
---
PVE = player vs environment
---
that's pve
---
+1
---
&gt;  but it is a matter of fact that when CCP created wormhole space they never expected or intended that it would be "inhabitable", and they have said so.
---
The point was not that this is false, but that this fact doesn't matter as many legitimate playstyles emerged unintentionally and deserve love and maintenance from CCP. Essentially this fact was irrelevant to whatever discussion that was going on about HICs.
---
I'm done playing your political game where you folk manipulate things I say to defend your space buddy or your space cult. I'll rise above engaging with your spin games. Please don't waste my time with this stuff. Enjoy your day.
---
Could try spider tanked domis. Pretty skill and multibox friendly and 5-7 should tank an astra.
---
The one time I've done this so far we brought a group of Drekavacs supported by Guardians and it worked out pretty well.
---
And so the tagline for the 2020 FanFest pub crawl was born...
---
This is the worst decision I have ever seen CCP make in EVE. No joke.
---
This change is very personal to me. This isn't just a probe change, this kills the reason to do exploration vs other tasks for ISK. It is tough to explain in words to people who don't get into this kind of thing, but this is one of those small things that makes EVE stand out.
---
R/wooosh ? The middle one is one Plex...
---
7 people against a t2 anti sub astra won’t be that easy. If you have all 15 you could go a gokufleet, with booshing bombers, and just avoid the bombs, but I don’t think you’d have enough numbers for booshers, bombers, and jackdaws/harpies to kill the fighters. You’ll also need some kirins or scalpels to keep everyone alive, since getting hit a few times is inevitable. 
---
Not sure if any hi sec mercs still exist, but if you can find and afford any somewhat reliable mercenaries I would do that. 15 people just isn’t much for bashing a manned structure.
---
Imagine being a LAWN bottom feeder and talking shit. You're worthless hanger-ons and PL would actually fuck your alliance inside out
---
Obviously an error...

Damn how'd you guess the weight of an average goon linemember
---
Are init still chest beating about bringing 700 against a 50 man WH group Jesus
---
&gt;with booshing bombers, and just avoid the bomb
---
My bad, I should have also mentioned it's in highsec so I don't think we need to worry about bombs, unless they changed it?
---
We're sort of ok fighting another small fleet, but none of us have attacked a manned structure before so are walking into this blind, accepting we might welp our fleet but hoping we have a good shot at putting it into structure.
---
No 1 PLEX is 1/500th of a month.
---
Contrary to what the others have insinuated. The amount of time that plex currently represents in the form of 1 month stands at the amount equivalent to 500 plex.
---
No, unless you have fun doing PVE activities.
---
How about not voting the way the bloc tells you to and voting for people you think would best benefit EvE?
---
Crazy thought I know. But what do you think?
---
If your contention is that CCP should adapt their development and balancing to what players want to do with the space that they're living in (and btw I think that this is a perfectly reasonable stance to take), then how do you square that with your extreme opposition to allowing players to do what they want with, to pluck an example out of the air, Delve?  Doesn't this come perilously close to asking CCP to pick sides?
---
That didn't stop Unspoken from fighting back when NCdocked and their buddies dog piled them
---
Umm... **What**
---
&gt;	I’m not blind to the idea that you want to build things and that mining requires a sustained period of time where you can do serious harvesting. I have had neuts enter system, everybody was galloping towards the POS and stayed there so long as that guy was there.
---
I just started two days ago and I have my little mining frigate to get hedbergite so I can get noxcium for my emp S ammo.
---
I had a guy who kept one-shotting me in a battlecruiser and I couldn’t look away from the monitor for a minute. After the second ship I realized he was purposefully targeting me and anytime he appeared on local I **immediately** docked at the nearest station until he left. This went on for a couple hours before he finally got tired of it and went to bother someone else.
---
I had never seen a griefer so persistent before.
---
Good news if true. I have the fondest memories of sharing G-0Q with these guys back in 2011-12. We learned a huge amount from our very frequent encounters.
---
Not really. Personally, I no longer have any interest in spending time krabbing to get ISK. I play other games while friends krab and then just show up to fleets and occasional solo/small gang roams. I don't lose much stuff ingame so I don't need to buy PLEX all the time, but I drop 100€ on PLEX once or twice in a year to keep some ISK in my ingame wallet.
---
You would use torpedo bombers, not bombing bombers. 
---
However, you can’t boosh in hisec, so that wouldn’t work.
---
They changed it and 1 old Plex is 500 nuplex. So you get 1month with 500nuplex that is 17$
---
Yes.
---
I wish you the best of luck.
---
Why?
---
It has four launcher hard points, but five launchers appear on the model. There's two on the edge of each wing, two on top of each wing, and one underneath each wing. 
---
The left hardpoint (when fitting a Crow) adds a model to both upper and lower sides of the left wing (when looking at the ship head on), and one on the upper side of the right wing. The second-from-left hardpoint then adds a launcher model to both sides of the right wing and the upper side only of the left wing. The last two hardpoints add a model each to the edges of both wings. 
---

Well it's not in everyone's best interest because harboring bots destroys the game. "Just keeping up" is not an excuse.

lol. Lets ignore that Tapi got 400b+ /month the last 3 years from KWG who were totally not botting at all

The principle isn't that complicated. All valuable playstyles, emergent or non-emergent, deserve maintenance and balance. Delve is out of balance.

There's a big difference in-between testing a program locally vs testing it at scale with thousands of players using it at once. That's why they need the sisi server and players to do playtests. They clearly have multiple layers of QA testing from small QA tests to larger in-house tests (with, I'm guessing hundreds of simulated players) and then sisi, with probably even more testing environments for more critical systems than the chat system.
---
They can push stupid systems, stupid mechanics, but aside from problems that go through the cracks from time to time (very occasional server crashes, chat that occasionally stops working), they have a good QA department to keep the game running 23/7, it's not an easy feat. 
---
If they didn't care about QA, the server would probably crash on a daily basis, simple things like the Market would get screwed up (you put in an order for 1 item and it creates one for 10), things would get duplicated, modules would randomly stop working, you'd get client dsyncs, etc. There are much worse things than "muh chat is broken" that could happen if they didn't do proper QA.
---
I haven't voted in CSM for years. I just marked my calendar to vote for you. Hopefully something can be done about the state of the game.
---
Dont let these people lie to you, CCP is totally selling 41 years of game time for 17 usd

Most of CCP aren't CCP anymore, especially if they were in the community relations department.

What really ruins the fun of the game is grinding for a free omega and unlimited isk. Don't be a poor. Get a job.
---
But will this cause a rift with goons when goons try to rat them?
---
People keep on with this idea that the only difference between null and k-space is a lack of local channel, and if the local channel was removed then all would be good again in EVE.  Obviously this is not the case at all.
---
The risk vs reward is balanced in both different types of space for different types of gameplay.  I'd also point out that k-space systems have limited, random connections and no possibility of cyno use.  If your static level 4 connection lands on somebody active and potentially hostile, you can roll it until you get something quiet, then crit the hole to limit incoming hostiles.  That one small scout ship that did come inside can't land on your pve activity and dump an entire fleet on your head, either.  In null there is currently no way to disrupt or limit star gate use nor stop covert cynos.  The balance to this is the local channel, and the use of intel channels is players in the sandbox doing what people do with the tools available to mitigate risk.
---
Removing local from null without dramatically changing the way the game works in other areas will be the death of average players living and building in nullsec space.  Want to make null a wasteland and the game devolve to ganking industrials in empire?  This would be the way to do it.
---
bruh that's some good food
---
Keep going my friend and fly safe o7  
---
We all wish you the very best
---
like 5-6 skill farmers can put a person on CSM.
---
The way it worked was very broken: player would have a portrait that looked like one thing and later it would change to something else.  True, not a life-ending issue, but we did just hand out thousands of the affected augmentations sooo...
---
I concern with the idea is this: a large entity (say, PIRAT) can roll around allying into every war and just smash all the structures of five-man corps who can't defend against the much-larger proxy defender. The ally system is going to HEAVILY favor defenders because of this.
---
The end result if it is left as-is after this patch will be that skirmish wars between small corps will completely disappear, and those were probably the most interesting highsec pvp content.
---
The problem is time. There is just not enough time for mature gamers to invest in this game if they want to keep up. It’s a catch 22 it would be nice to go back to a time where there was no plex on a clean server so losses meant something for a while. But I know that can’t happen
---
Where is NC going to find a 200k character coalition to blue?
---
Communities are there by default. There needs to be some other benefit for them joining you, otherwise why would they? Spend some time thinking of why you'd join a corp. If you can't offer them a reason - particularly if they have to pay to be there - it will be difficult.
---
And back rubs
---
This is one of the most amazing things I have seen in Eve in 14 years!  I’ve never voted for a CSM candidate, but you can be damn sure you’re getting my vote!
---

If this isn’t a good way to make passive moneu,  I’ve been looking into Industry: namely, Blueprint Copying. Is this a good way to make passive cash?
---
There have always been killboards in EVE, there were others before zKill. 
---
There have always been killboard warriors, who only care about killboard statistics.  As a matter of fact, 10 years ago, it was very difficult to find a nullsec corp that would take you if you didn't have at least 300 kills and a good ratio.  The game has gotten much better in this respect, not worse.
---
It’s settled then, you couldn’t make a living off pvp so it’s impossible
---
What kind of music does TAPI listen to?
---
Blues
---
&gt; but it should lose the optimal range bonus and gain a damage bonus of some kind so Caldari can actually have a proper line-up of combat battleships like every other race. Alternatively, remove the ECM range bonus and give it a tank bonus to better support the new ECM mechanics. 
---
Nah. removing optimal bonus will make scorpion unusable. damage bonus can be useful in small gang fleet, but it's kinda useless in F1 fleet, which scorpion is a thing. (who uses scorpion over blackbird/falcon in small gang fleet btw)
---
Optimal bonus is essential on scorpion cuz in F1 fleet, you'll be over 120km+ from your jamming target, which is rare case in small gang fleet.
---
You don't understand why the armor raven is popular. It's not because it has less base shield EHP, it's because missile guidance computer must be fitted in mid slot, so you must spend your mid slot to get super long snipe range, the part raven is superior. Of course there is low slot module which gives bonus to missile range, but you can't focus it's attribute to range so can't use it. If we can fit missile computer on low slot, or we can put script on low slot module maybe we can see more shield fitted snipe raven.
---
Also there is reasons lots of boosh snipe F1 fleet still use ravens instead of rokh, there is pros and cons so you can't tell what the 'better' fit is.
---
I can see lots of difference on point of view, you simply not understanding circumstance under F1 fleet, which matters a lot. I also prefer small gang/solo stuff, but I think we must check about F1 fleet fittings when it comes to balance change.
---
It really is though, it's on CCP to confirm and  tackle botting, it is not on me to speculate and enforce, I'm not paying to do CCP's job.
---
The Leshak is actually T1.
---
So why hasn't ccp banned them all.

HINT: Don't do this - https://zkillboard.com/kill/76786204/ then try to pickup your loot in this - https://zkillboard.com/kill/76786365/ ; from personal experience haha
---
Guilty as charged.
---
For some people yes: if your main goal in eve was solved by spending some bucks, you might lose your urge to play.
---
For others no, because their goals are getting good at solo pvp, or leading a corp, or becoming a FC, or whatever else that plex can't buy.
---
I'd be absolutely fine with that. Actually I'd like a cloaking module to disconnect you from the comms beacon (i.e. you disappear from local but also lose sight of local) too, but doing it just for gate cloak would be a good place to start.
---
change your definition of keeping up
---
i blued the triglavian in my corp lol i mean i am more intrested in mining the ore there than fighting them .
---
Yo hit me up that sounds fun. Been looking for something to do in EvE now that I'm kind of waking up from a 3 year hiatus.
---
Since I can't find myself a place to F1 monkey in a battleship, might as well give hisec mining a try.
---
Of course there are other differences with J space. The main problem with removing the instant free intel of local is the instant free reinforcements of cynos - cyno mechanics need looking at.
---
You can 'disrupt or limit stargate use' - bubbles do that job nicely. (Not for interceptors but the same is true for hole control - you can't stop an interceptor jumping a wormhole either.) It's only cynos that are really a problem.
---
Though of course if the locals want to keep that card off the table they can always anchor a jammer.
---
As others mentioned - Jump clones or training implants.
---
&gt; I want 3-4 unsupported alts in supers to not be the standard solution to every problem in null
---
Amen to that.
---
You shouldn't be able to teleport the biggest ships in the game around the map instantly, that's one thing. Cynos should not be instant. And you also shouldn't be able to apply to cruisers with a super - it should be like trying to drop a battleship on a frigate fight, you'll be completely irrelevant or get anklebitten to death.
---
I guess by applying?
---
To put it in layman’s terms, 500 Plex = 1 month
---
Yeah but a woman riding a massive pole would beat a lot of things...

I bet one or more of your RL friends do some weird stuff that nobody else does and you're still friends. Blueing people is a weird thing that tapi does to everybody but that doesn't prevent them from being friends with goons.
---
I put on my wizard robe and hat.
---
Do you have any doctrines you currently run that might give me an idea of your skill sets/available assets?      
---
Regardless you really want all your numbers available for this. Assuming he fit this for max dps and max fucking with your fleet he can dis out over 5k dps(3k with missiles 2k with fighters) with the structure.
---
you actually suck on the rocks which is not only even more boring, but also gross
---
No they'll just be blue, no batphone privileges or mutual defense. What do you take us for, dirty NPC lovers just because we blue everyone and everything?
---
Chaos reformation when

---
Didn't say that, just wondering if there was an actual way of making good isk by only doing PVP that I hadn't found out about.
---
If people do enough for a good living by looting wrecks awesome for them, it's just not enough for me.
---
But well, if you want to understand whatever you want from what I said feel free to keep doing so.
---
This. There's plenty of stuff to do without having to spend craploads of time in the game.
---
Former waffle here.  I dont even know whats going on in this damn game anymore, I just come to this subreddit sometimes to see if I can spot any waffle tags.  Today I am not disappointed.  Caelum you old dirty bastard, still at it I see, ande we have space jesus's approval so newt must still around too.  That's cool, nice to know.  Miss you guys, but not this god awful game unfortunately  WAFFLES#1
---
idk what that is
---
Yes but they won't because they are lazy. I tried to court that demographic last year.
---
I believe we have meta and t2 available
---
I specifically mentioned covert cynos because they can't be stopped.  That, combined with interdiction nullified cloaky T3 tackle/cyno ships also makes bubbles far less useful.  The use of bubbles to cover gates in null has dropped a lot over the past few years, because they simply aren't that effective except for providing killmails to roaming fleets, and often end up trapping the very residents of the system they were meant to protect.
---
We have different types of space in EVE for a reason.  Solo/small gang and local+Intel is harshing your tactics?  Then go hunt in wormholes, or change your tactics.  Null is about sandbox, it's the Unlimited class of Eve play.  You want to take on null sec groups that are skilled and organized  you are going to have to put some skill and work into organizing yourself.  Asking CCP to put a finger on the scale to turn solo roaming into easy mode kill fest is not the answer.

how do you account for death and consciousness transfer in wormhole space then?
---
I think you vastly overestimate the value of a couple utility neuts. I would much rather give it an extra low, or roll the two bonuses into a cumulative 10% damage bonus, and give it a second bonus to optimal, falloff or just plain old webbing range. Two damage bonuses on a hull that does mediocre DPS with mediocre projection is kinda silly.

what is the difference between "Eve Mail" and "Communications." I've gotten a few messages to "Communications" that I didn't even get notified about!
---
I do know why you make an armor raven. Ive mentioned it twice. Theyre a super niche fit and would ignore the primary tank regardless of tank for mids. Which is why i said its irrelevant if armor HP is lost as the fit still works and anything in range will kill an armor raven whether it has 32k HP or 28k HP. They only have a DCU and sometimes an explo rig for tank.
---
Consider for a moment. If the raven had 12k shield HP as a base amount per my article. The armor raven has 15-17k armor HP based off the init fit with a 1600 plate and 2 trimarks or 1 trimark and 1 explo pump.
---
For a shield fit, you no longer need 5 mids of tank to do the same thing. A single LSE+extender rigs would get you there for buffer. Then you get 1-2 invulns. That leaves 4-5 mids for missile comps/SEBOs/MJD etc. This also opens up lows for damage, sig amps etc.
---
The armor raven exists because the shield buffer needs too many mods to work and you cant just leave off mods as buffer suffers severely.
---
3-4 guardians is more then enough, and if you can afford 1-2 leshaks as well you will be golden. Other then that you could use Augurors with prophecies, spider nestors/domis, a shield comp with bassies, or passive rattlesnakes, just to name a few comps that would work. An unsupported aster isn't great at killing subcaps with logi, even if it dose have fighters. Just shoot the fighters as they are launched and make sure your logi is fit with ECCM.

It may be that some systems are run on the same computer on ccp’s end, so if a big thing is going down in a system running on the same computer (it could be any system in the game) it would cause that system to have some lag.

Takes a long ass time to get into the ship required though
---
Yes. Ever since I started making good money and buying Plex I hardly rat. It's been at least 2 years. But it does afford me more time and isk for pvp so that's a plus.
---
Thanks, and sorry for the late reply. My cap (fuelled by a med cap booster) is showing 40% stable with everything active, and lasts 40seconds in game. Does that sound right? Perhaps because each mod uses so much cap and my cap booster only works so fast?
---
Thanks again bud!
---
Yes, different types will give you different mutaplasmids. Dark for tackle mods, gama for shield, firestorm for armor, eletric for cap, exotic for prop mods. Damage mutas come from any type afik. The rest of the loot is dependent on the level and not the type.
---
Well said! Eve IS a community
---
Running late but trying to catch you before you roll out!  How much will the Harbis be?
---
Thanks for the reply, double and triple checked this though - and doesn’t explain how my succubus with no active shield mods is showing 340dps active tank, sure that must be a “copy” bug or something.
---
interesting
---
well it needs to be levelled  with t1 battleships
---
Yes, the theory is sound. At the very least it's better than convincing people to pay you with no reason why. You still need to do work up front though. 
---
I haven't done it in a long time but if I remember correctly you need to buy the originals and then find a place to create the copies, which take time and money. And I think there needs to be space in the station for your job to run alongside all of the other players who are doing the same thing (i.e. looking for a safe, clever way to make passive income). 
---
There's also some market research you'll need to do, and some decisions to be made, including:
---
a) creating a relatively easy-to-make item/BPC that won't sell for much but may sell in more volume, or 
---
b) a more complex item/BPC that may sell for more, but won't sell as much.
---
That answer might change depending on the region you're in. And please know I'm horribly oversimplifying a process that I knew from years ago. If this interests you, definitely go look up a more detailed (and recent!) guide on how it's done. 
---
If you're into that sort of thing it can be a pretty cool way to enjoy the game, and yes, make money. If you're NOT into that sort of thing you'll find it nauseating and abhorrent.
---
Good luck!
---
Pretty good meme 👌🏼
---
We have always been ahead of them in terms of mining and production on the MER though?
---
There is a lot of stuff you can do with one account and have fun, particularly if you join a corp and play with friends.
---
Put down the pipe weedbrain.
---
This is definitely something people do. Corps like the one you are describing are generally considered newbie traps and are regarded poorly by the wider community as they are seen as something that drives new player away from the game. You will also make a great target for ganking, wardecking, and corporate theft (though you can definitely mitigate most of these). You can definitely do it, but don't expect people to appreciate you for it unless you are providing value for those you recruit beyond just a "community" an lower taxes then an NPC corp.
---
depends on the BP. If you are copying super BPs that are well researched, you can make decent ISK. Not so much for some random cruiser or battle cruiser BP.

I said HP, as in raw hitpoints. If i meant EHP i would of said EHP. Which is what the entire article has been about (HP). Focus please, things like this derail the discussion.

Thats because you don't know what you are talking about.  The 2 heavy neuts are one of its best features.
---
The tempest is the best HAC in the game... 2 heavy neuts, MJD or grappler and BS insurance.
---
That's exactly where they are at right now, too))
---
We've had  along period of easy punch down wars. I think it's worth testing for a little bit how a period of very few pointless  wars goes.
---
Nah third party classic servers have plenty of people
---
Adding you wouldn't really be adding any diversity. I don't think you understand the CSM either and you don't come across as mentally stable sometimes.
---
Why does someone post this EVERY sale?
---
This entire article is extremely narrow sighted. I'm hoping your comment included sarcasm I missed.
---
btw how do you think you learn pvp ?
---
when loosing a ship and wasted traveltime  annoy you probably the game isnt a thing for you
---
and in 3 days you cant say anything about a corp.
---
sometimes you roam 2 hours without good content or a fight after 2 hours roaming you get podded instantly
---
i roamed solo in Black Rise for month and get killed killed killed and killed again.
---
if you dont want to suffer EVE online isnt the game for you
---
I don't think your opinion about me or what CSM is matters.
---
It may not have the green icon, but in pretty much every way it is a faction bs.
---
I did not know that one system on CCP's computer could affect another.  Thanks for the info.
---
God I hope so. Why would we want to be Elite PvP Boiz?
---
Damn, son. Thats one big r/woosh
---
standard low+mids+rigs with the best rails you can fit?
---
I could live with that.
---
Im richer in eve than I am irl
---
E-Uni has an event every Friday for this sort of purpose.
---
Frigates fighting at somewhat unknown circumstances (at go, the participants warp to to one of two bookmarks without knowing which one the other person warped to). Sure, you know that you only have to keep an eye on one person and might have an idea of what you're up against based on what you saw in a previous round, but it's a good way to get experience like that.
---
The other thing for frigate experience is to fly tackle in a fleet.
---
You have my vote!
---
Look how that worked out for Star Wars galaxies many years ago ;(
---
Its HP matches the amount of HP as per other T1 battleships, just distrbutes differently. Pirate/Navy faction ships have 8-10k more HP. The Leshak is 27k HP, pirate/faction BS are around 38k.
---
I'm guessing the Mormons aren't popular in Iceland.
---
This, but unironically
---
Pet, you are in LAWN. You need written permission of 3 goons to be on reddit, you know that?
---
At first I spent so much time making isk in game it turned out to be a low paying job irl.... my dollar per hr value works out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better when i take on quick and easy freelance jobs to fund my eve (and other) addictions, now i just undock and fight.
---
Yeah dude welcome to the cancer that is sov fights.
---
This is what you do while grinding.
---
I have one, because I can't afford to sub my dread alt right now, and I'm using an alternate character slot to do some marketing.  I'm making enough ISK to replace ships and then some.  Been playing this way for months and I enjoy it.
---
I do this with barghest, make about 1.5 bil per hour. Pretty safe and easy way to farm especially in a black hole.
---
This entire article is very short sighted:
---
1. You can't go adjusting base tank without also adjusting slot layouts. Otherwise you'll wind up with battleships that have extreme (read: capital) amounts of hit points.
---
2. Many of the ships you list have weak tanks on purpose due to their damage or utility. Balance isn't just about making sure all ships have the same amount of hitpoints .. it's about making sure you don't wind up with a battleship that applies 1500 DPS and tanks 500k ehp while jamming everything around it.
---
3. Your entire article is premised on the Leshak, but one of the topics you never touched on was cost. Yes, the Leshak has great abilities, but that comes at the expensive of your wallet. It has direct counters (jams) and has fairly weak resists making it a pain to rep under heavy dps with its battleship sized sig.
---
Nah it'll just be the good old test one-sided alliance.
---
I'd imagine this would have to apply to people who cyno into a system as well, unless there's something particularly magical about the physics of wormholes.
---
free of charge :) heck, you can make money on insurance when we blow up
---
True.what I meant they were pretty active then quite quickly just stopped without any real reason.  Gorgon correctly sprouted only again to go fairly soon.
---
Althought one could in favor or against it....just one XL structure per system may look entirely arbitrary.
---
yes. 
---
This thread is now about which race industrial to train.
---
Tbf, the local power in the region became N3 right around the time that Darkside was disbanding. Hard to get good fights out of tracts of renter space to be quite honest.
---
Lussy Lou/iBeast used to be in Darkside. from what I can remember of some of his videos posted on Kugu when they would traipse up to Tribute to shoot CO2. Explains why he's so good at the game
---
Sentries too, as I discovered recently. Geckos for close enemies and sentries for enemies further away.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/
---
search for your system, filter by security
---
Both could work with the Lore, but I actually agree with you, maybe there could be an exception for taking bridges but black ops could be immune to Local. Could be a good way to seed stuff
---
Who needs sov when you can have karma?
---
Sorry, but /u/StainGuy already said he wants the ship moved to Stain so he finally can get his Transfer Conduit to LowSec.
---
Guess its ruskies only...
---
The fact that you can see ship types and ship names via D-Scan in wormholes would suggest that it's based on some sort of passive reading of transponders.  Local being non-existent without the means to read and rebroadcast information from those transponders makes sense.  I can see consciousness transfer being accomplished through a data burst transmitted by the dying ship, but I don't get how it would make it out of wormhole and abyssal space without some sort of infrastructure.
---
Here I was just starting to do exploration.Perhaps not now.
---
&gt; I said HP, as in raw hitpoints.
---
Ok well its 18.5k HP so you're still off by an enormous margin.
---
Literally no one in EVE talks about raw HP because it's a meaningless figure. It's about EHP and EHP/sec repped, sometimes vs specific damage profiles. The fact you're talking about HP is going to make anyone with a clue seriously doubt your knowledge of the subject.
---
&gt; Youd **probably** be seeing a 8-10k actual EHP loss.
---
Why not just open pyfa or EFT and find out?
---
I would start with railguns and a propmod
---
I'll be taking notes...
---
&gt;They dont appear to have any automated detection, but even if they did, VPNs would help to circumvent it.
---
HOW CAN YOU NOT SEPARATE THE DETECTION OF BOTS VERSUS THE LINKING OF BOTS TOGETHER
---
&gt;The point was to show how VPNs make detection harder.
---
no one has debated this
---
&gt;Wrong. The distribution of bots is a way to avoid detection.
---
wrong- distribution of bots does not make a bot more or less difficult to detect
---
&gt;Thats why you ban VPNs so people are forced to use a much smaller IP pool. I could probably find and ban 90% of the public VPNs in less than an hour if I really wanted to. Then you check how many use hosting providers IP ranges.
---
and ban thousands of innocents. cringe.
---
He can have a tackle on it, able to hold a target for 30s while fighters are coming to hold the point, and apply some consistent dps on said target. 
---
So Logi will be needed. A group of RR Nestor will definitely do a good job. If he send fighters, kill the sirens, tank the other ones.
---
Man and I thought it was bad when I quit at like 700 mil.  How do people afford to actually farm for a few accounts and then actually have time to enjoy the game?
---
Only showing the value of what was dropped / destroyed, and not the fit wouldn't be a bad compromise, IMHO.
---
ahhh yes. exactly, you must be the inside man to know that then...
---
Stop making assumptions please. I mean, yes maybe they have a lot of botters. But without proof you simple should not assume that EVERYONE in there is a botter
---
Most PvE with the new AI has trash reward. Abyssal sites are a very good improvement on the PvE ut don't get your hopes too high. I assume the new triglavian invasion will also get decent AI / difficulty.
---
[Are you talking about this page?](https://imgur.com/a/mQ93nTo/)
---
The only thing that tells me is there aren’t any nullsec spaces in my region. It doesn’t allow me to sort nullsec systems by distance from my current position.
---
This may sound crazy but we care about the health of the game also, it's not in our best interest if this game dies. Sounds crazy I know.
---
Only new pve contents have new AI implemented
---
Old rats are still the old rats
---
Lets start back over shall we? Cause you're not reading any of this correctly.
---
You linked initiative raven's fit. Found here: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76288632/
---
Take a look at the total damage taken. 32k HITPOINTS
---
Now. Opening Pyfa, you know.. the thing you keep telling me to reference. Select the "HP" icon and then read "Raw HP: 32k" at the top. Hitpoints means, the entire hit points of the ship until it goes "poof". This isn't rocket science or some new thing, it helps to know how much raw HP a ship has when comparing it to other ships in the class. Which is what this article was doing and providing a baseline.
---
Here's a picture just for you of my Pyfa with the initiative tank fit: https://imgur.com/agjKEr5 
---
The HP section shows 32k HP.
---
Here's a picture of the EHP value (before i apply modifications): https://imgur.com/2EA2Qlj
---
Here's a picture of EHP after i've applied HP modification:
---
https://imgur.com/Gby7lfG
---
Oh wow, you lost a whopping 3k EHP and armor went from 11k to 15k HP. You're completely naked shield EHP is 19k, while your armor EHP is 23k.
---
If you factor in armor links then your EHP starts at 75k and goes down to 70k EHP, meaning a 5k loss. So, my original 8k guess wasn't far off, but was actually a much less meaningful loss than even i imagined.
---
Best eve video in ages.
---
Who? etc.
---
I remember when i was in darkness they had a software that pings sound in your headphones everytime a neutral was reported in a channel in your constelation. I hated it.
---
And those drones can easily constitute around half or just under half of your total dps given the bonuses on the Praxis and if you fit it with the requisite three drone amps.
---
I personally use a primarily pulse laser+sentry Praxis (also carries geckos and lights for close combat), and it reaches around 970 dps with scorch and curators, and around 1200 dps with conflagration and curators (or 1300 dps with geckos instead of curators). Potential dps should be higher but I haven't unlocked t2 sentries yet.
---
33 mins 17 secs is the time stamp
---
Personally, I'd like to see certain ship types being invisible to local (the way that some of the recons are invisible to d-scan) and/or a module that facilitates this.  To balance things out though, they'd need to be comparatively weak ships, or the module would need to seriously nerf the ship while in place.  With the module, ships would need to refit before being combat effective.  Allows for stealthy move ops, while not giving all the advantage to hunters.
---
Happy Birthday!
---
Your podcast isn’t too bad. Mind putting on the wormhole CSM candidates to give them a platform to speak from?
---
misspelled TDBIN
---
Jokes aside, congrats!
---
Dual heavy neuts are amazing on any solo/small fleet BS that can fit them. Leave the damage and application bonus on the Machariel. Let the Tempest and TFI keep the 2 utility slot flavor.
---
RAM Gila BEST Gila!
---
No, I think Eve is done with Plex sales now. I can't see PA ever allowing Eve to run at a deficit even for a single 1/4 or day sale. Icelandic &amp; London wages are high subs need to cover these.
---
With respect, I think that’s the sort of putting lipstick on a pig sure to fix that got us into this mess in the first place. They have to really take a good long fundamental look at the issue and the underlying concerns that provides the foundation. Adding a new ship isn’t going to fix this problem in my humble opinion
---
Well that sucks :D so I can expect same good ol L4s and their rats right?
---
Oh I see thanks
---
Oh I see, thanks for the info
---
Ah thanks for explaining! Makes sense.
---
I believe that if moons stayed where they can be mined by line members as it is now, but they allocated specific moon minerals to specific regions like they used to, there would be more reason for wars and desire for specific regions. 
---
Make sovereignty a combination of fozziesov and infrastructure. 
---
Reduce timers to max 48hrs, stront based 
---
Example; keep it as it is now, but for certain ihub upgrades, require certain structures in system. In order to attack sov, all structures need to be in shield timers. Then at the end of shield timers you have to put them into armor timer to take sov, then final structure timers are only the structures. 
---
Make respawn timers on anomaly’s 1.75x what they are now so your forced to spread out. Delve shouldn’t be able to handle 34,500 alts or 500 players. 
---
But I’ve not thought much about this, just my shower thoughts and it’s probably a horrible fucking idea for some reason i haven’t expanded on
---
looks like ill need a guide on my next vacation

---
&gt; Now. Opening Pyfa, you know.. the thing you keep telling me to reference. Select the "HP" icon and then read "Raw HP: 32k" at the top. Hitpoints means, the entire hit points of the ship until it goes "poof".
---
See this is where you're missing the point. When I shoot that Raven, I don't need to shoot 32k HP at it. I need to shoot 80k damage at it. Whether it has 80k raw HP behind 0% resists or 800 HP behind 99.9% resists is absolutely immaterial to me beyond possibly considering logi. I don't shoot 32k at that ship, I shoot 80k at it.
---
If I put 3 plates on an Abaddon it has 43.5k HP. If I put 2 plates an a bunch of hardeners, it has 34.4k HP. This number means nothing to me, I care about which gives it more EHP.
---
EHP and resist profile is what matters. It doesn't make a blind bit of difference what the raw HP behind that is.

With noobman being gone from the game, I can think of no other person capable of carrying the torch in the CSM for a long-term then exookiz.

That's their entire coalition though lol, so why not figure what Legacy mines versus what they mine.

Well, you've seen Mad Max Fury road, right?

---
Ah yes, a HAC that barely goes 1.1k with a MWD and which caps can fully apply to at all times. If I want 2 neuts, a MJD, BS insurance and some damage on a battleship, I get a geddon.
---
I am aware how the launchers are spread out, and I pointed out why it is so. Having only 3 launchers on the model would require the missiles to either fly around your ship or clip through. It's the same with literally every single weapon. Hell, even triglavian ships have 3 balls hanging around the ship.
---
met you guys at EVE NE one year and had a blast! Great group :)
---
 Here's to 10 more (or till the servers shut down...)
---
It's a bit dubious to host a podcast on people running for CSM when you yourself are running for CSM, might be why he hasn't done one yet :)
---
Wait.. what the fuck is that?
---
There's probably less than 10 folks who go out solo in the Tempest, in all of eve. And small BS fleets (which are so very rare) are way better served by a Geddon, if it comes to neuts. I've lived in WH space for a decade and I have barely seen any Tempests at all, in years worth of small battleship fleets.
---
&gt;HOW CAN YOU NOT SEPARATE THE DETECTION OF BOTS VERSUS THE LINKING OF BOTS TOGETHER
---
Because they are not separate!
---
&gt;no one has debated this
---
You have been arguing against this for a while.
---
&gt;wrong- distribution of bots does not make a bot more or less difficult to detect
---
If you see 50 connects coming out of a single IP, that probably means someone is running a bunch of bots. If that turns out to be correct, they were found because they couldnt distribute.
---
&gt;and ban thousands of innocents. cringe.
---
A claim without substance. There are very few legitimate reasons someone would be forced to use a VPN. The primary purpose seems to be to lower the chance of their mains getting banned when their bots get caught.
---
Yaay
---
Reloads will also affect it. But yes, I suspect that'll be it. It'll be dropping the cap low then bouncing it back up, so you'll never hit peak recharge.
---
That doesn't change the fact that it is overtuned.
---
Yea that seems to be the only logical possibility I can see, thanks for the help man.
---
Well your Praxis is geared for PvP, mine is exclusively for PvE and is shield tanked to fit three drone amps and three heat sinks (or other weapon upgrades if using other weapon types) in the lows.
---
I think it's about right honestly, it is sort of the solution to n1 in some respect since it only works on small scales. Range and losing ramp cause ammo is a good counter and the mystic nerf is healthy.
---
Oh. I thought you were discussing PvP fits so I was getting excited about a potential new fit.
---
Great place to farm angel 4s
---
Triglavian.
---
This thread is now about when they'll release triglavian industrials.
---
when posting gets shit: this thread
---
so THAT'S what TAPI stands for
---
It basically killed any usage of other battleships in WH space. People would use torp rattles Rattles, Nightmares, TFIs, funky Nestors, all sorts of good stuff. Now you have Leshaks, maybe a bhaal and a vindi. And if not Leshaks, Drekavaks. It's very boring.

or is it...

7-15 is enough. Do yourselves a favour: hop on SISI as a group and do a test run.
---
Scan the structure and see how it’s fit. Then you can do a test run on SISI. The only way to know for sure how well your corp will do is by trying it, this gives you a way to test comps without feeding.
---
&gt;We are not here to ruin your game, We are here to ruin everyone's game.
---
You're right. It does sound crazy.
---
I'm correcting you trying to say that i'm not reading numbers right. You're not reading numbers right, and i've pointed this out to you. Lets go back up this chain:
---
&gt;A boosh raven has 80k EHP under links. That's triple damage mod with literally nothing but damage control, plate and 2 tank rigs.  
---
&gt;Like come on if you're gonna argue details at least open EFT or Pyfa and look at what you're talking about first.
---
Here you call me out because your assuming EHP.
---
I correct you, then you posted (which you've now edited out) that it has 18k HP HP and not the 32k HP i stated. Which is cause you're only reading armor HP and not total HP. I then corrected you above with screenshots of the actual HP values as per Pyfa and what i originally (correctly) stated.
---
Everything else after that, that you're trying to make about EHP/HP is irrelevant, as i was only correcting you about HP values. 
---
Now, before you start typing up your next comment, and explaining to me the intricacies of EHP, **keep in mind that this entire article has been focused on HP values for comparison purposes.** Of course its going to effect EHP when you increase HP amounts, however as i've already indicated in my example(s), the change was a 12% increase to EHP on my "renter tier raven". An 8% increase on the top tier "C0ne" raven you recommended and only a 3k EHP drop on the armor raven. All very minor/moderate changes in EHP to existing fits/tactics.
---
For someone who's so involved in EHP, you seem to fail to realize that having 11-13k EHP in your non primary tank is useless when you want to talk about EHP/s. How does having 9k shield HP with base resists on an Abaddon help your armor reps? Does that 14k EHP in shields really matter to your rep/s, its a paper number. 
---
&gt;  EHP and resist profile is what matters. It doesn't make a blind bit of difference what the raw HP behind that is. 
---
But it does, when you have to deal with capitals or large amounts of alpha. If resists were the only thing that matter'd so much, marauders wouldn't get their primary tank layer vollied by a super. Extra buffer is still important **in conjunction** with resistances.
---

Yes, sorry. Reading comprehension failure on my part.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/76908918/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76908918/) no whale kill but at least got a squishy. Did something right at least.
---
I don't know that I agree with your solution of skewing stats one way or another, but battleships haven't been in a great place for a while. As others have mentioned, skewing like that takes away a lot of flexibility that makes some hulls so fun to play around with. 
---
But, like every Capsuleer out there, I'm sure I have my own thoughts that anyone else could argue with until they're blue in the face, so I'll just leave it at its an interesting proposition. If it gets battleships the halp they need, then fair do's.
---
Already blue no ?
---
yup, nothing has changed.
---
Used to be enjoy a low traffic roam route in hisec, now it's officially gone for this *EPIC* change. CCP care no player experience since 2003 anyways.
---
Going to just waste $160 on a mobile game instead of next year's sub.
---
Exooki for CSM!
---
Basic fitting skills and possibly cybernetics if you plan on having them be a skill-farm at some point, or just wanting to train faster in general.
---
How sad, isn’t it?
---
Happy birthday to your corp
---
Same here ....
---
&gt; You can't go adjusting base tank without also adjusting slot layouts. Otherwise you'll wind up with battleships that have extreme (read: capital) amounts of hit points. 
---
If you can show me a T1 battleship that when gaining a 12-20% increase in EHP puts it into capital levels of EHP (after the capital fits a tank), go for it. Even a max tanked Abaddon currently sits at  272k (with damnation links), +20% to that is \~320k). A naked niddy is about that (no tank at all), but not really fair to compare something with every slot filled with tank to something thats not fit now is it?
---
Otherwise, things like the 20k EHP punisher would be considered OP since it has the same tank as a cruiser.
---
&gt; Many of the ships you list have weak tanks on purpose due to their damage or utility. Balance isn't just about making sure all ships have the same amount of hitpoints .. it's about making sure you don't wind up with a battleship that applies 1500 DPS and tanks 500k ehp while jamming everything around it. 
---
You mean like carriers? Yeah, good balance there, except it was more like 2300 dps, 700k EHP and webbing/pointing everything in 3000km. Also, the only battleship that could jam everything around it would be the scorpion, which won't be doing 1500 dps, no matter what combat bonus it could potentially get. You're approaching strawman territory here.
---
Battleships would still be easily counterable to proper doctrines/setups. Just gives them more wiggle room in their tank to be effective without gimping.
---
&gt; It has direct counters (jams) and has fairly weak resists making it a pain to rep under heavy dps with its battleship sized sig. 
---
Everything has a weakness to jams. The actual counter to a leshak is optimal range tracking disruption. Also, even with no resist/rep bonuses (which i even talk about that in the article), a leshak can still tank against a carrier just fine, this is thanks to its large armor buffer and 8 lows. Its sig is 370m and is below average for battleship sized sigs (\~400m). Its also one of the faster armor focused battleships, so in conjunction with its low sig and decent speed, it can AB sig tank against carriers/supers relatively well. Against supers it still gets plenty of reps in time to survive. Hydra and Tuskers, among other groups, have been doing it and succeeding as long as escalations are controlled.
---
i have a macro to automatically blue every new character made.
---
Honest question: Is a Garmur a thing in Abyssals?
---
It sounds fun to go zoom zoom.
---
lots of ppl suggesting the bots will just scoop and poop their loot after each site.  
---
What if the loot couldn't be dumped?  What if it was like faction or research, so you would have to take your clone(or ship \*see below) to somewhere, maybe it was even mobile to some amount and then sell your faction/research?  If your clone died before you sold it, you lose it?  Maybe attacker gets percentage of it?  That might make a "New-Jita" though.  Wouldn't be able to use a hauling service if it was pod.  Clone bay hauling?
---
Burn-&lt;insert random system&gt;.  NO WAMMY, NO WAMMY, STOP!!! ...  NO THEY ARE ALL "/points finger at you" COMING HERE!!!

I don't think it would stop botters though.  They would continue.  Except if you caught them you could get a % of hours/days/months of "their work".  Same for real players though...  Which are arguably easier to catch but harder to out smart?  Would seriously encourage podding.  Maybe it could be tied to the ship?  Burn-Jita NO get the VNIs.  Poor VNIs...  Which might encourage ratting in other ships.  I wanna do 30 jumps in a scorpion, oh or a rattle.  Possibly dual bots, one VNI and an inty.  Sell the inty's faction and write VNI faction off as a loss?

I'm not sure I like this plan.

Happy birthday! miss y'all crazy bastards. Heard y'all have gotten pretty damn big since i've left too lol

Local is fine.

Yeah can't go wrong with cybernetics skills. I'm a vet of 10 years and in my opinion having the ability to use  +5 implants beats the cost of skill injectors any day.

Congrats

I've not been playing long enough to know about these corps but Flesh Rocket, what a name
---
There’s certain things that become very difficult without multiple accounts, capitals, large scale industry come to mind. That said, and as others have mentioned, the game is totally playable and enjoyable with 1 account.
---
WH C4,C5 ( capital escalations ) C6 ( never been there ) , Incursions , Combat Sites , Anomalies . But PvE .....in PvP game ....
---
P.s. If this universe is mostly PvP , then why EvE dont have PvE universe ? , just linked whit button :)  
---
....they'll sey you fly cheap ship to learn ,.....but at that time .....hundrets of Dreads,Caps,Titans and Supers got blowed in sec in fleet fights .
---
lets see who breaks the agreement first, goons or triglave
---
One caveat  to your point in capitals even titans with 1 character, many groups will mandate a fax alt if you want to fly a titan or super with them, so just be mindful of that OP

I'm not going to spend the time going back and forth like everyone else. You obviously don't want to listen to other's feedback.. just continually argue that you are correct. I guess I was hoping for too much to think that someone running for CSM would listen to the feedback of the people they're asking for votes from.
---
Look, bear, it will only save time for those who spend their entire real life in this game and only those guys. They can now just go do every anomaly and every signal site without wasting their time, leaving nothing behind for casual players. Casual players are now forbidden from exploring because there's simply NOTHING left. Players like me that only plays explore casually will just quit for this change. Newbro who tries to do exploring will get discouraged for the fact that there are only little to no sites for them to do, find nothing when they finally traveled a few jumps to get to a freshly spawned site.
---
I'm now very convinced CCP don't know what they're doing and they never played their game. This change essentially kills any form of casual exploring/ anom ratting. It only feeds the exploring bot for them to make better ISK/hr, or those spending their real life doing similar things. Just watch all the casual explorer unsub the game and cry over your spilled milk CCP &lt;3
---
EVE Online: Where the most intense PVP fight involves 1 player with 60 accounts is trying to kill another player with 60 accounts
---
Why do you care what someone else does?
---
\&gt;Emergent playstyles can be out of balance.
---
"Out of balance" can be a most slippery concept to define. I think it might be important to nail down exactly *what* is out of balance. 
---
When you talk about "anom respawns" for instance, then it's worth remembering that people doing anoms are *playing the game.* If you're going to propose reducing the available content for them, are you going to match that with a proposal that increases other content for them instead? If you don't, then essentially you'll be asking CCP to stop people playing their game as much, which i think you might find a tough sell. If you do, then... well forgive me if I'm making assumptions here, but I feel like you're viscerally against *certain people*, shall we say, being able to acquire so much in-game assets?
---
So that leaves you trying to resolve a very thorny problem indeed, because I'm struggling to think of what general shape the answer to the question: "What could replace anoms as a game feature that people *want to use* but not cause the problems (uncapped asset acquisition) that I believe are inherent to frequently spawning anoms?" might have.
---
With respect to, uh, Delve inhabitants and umbrellas, I'd suggest that you consider things from their perspective. They have been taught, very empirically, that supercapital dominance is the alpha and omega of 0.0 power. Quite simply, the side that can drop the supercapital hammer (and these days that really means the *Titan* hammer) gets to define the terms of the engagement. And Titans are very expensive assets that people are correspondingly cautious about committing. This means that if there's a fight, let's say over a valuable moon or a contested staging fortizar, where Side A can bring 50 titans and Side B can bring 70, then Side A will **invariably** cede the supercapital level of the fight. They might try and drop suicide dreads, use boosh ravens, hope to bubble a straggler or whatever other harrassment/guerilla tactic seems good, but ultimately they *wont use their titans.* (This is fundamentally different from a fight where eg: Side A has 50 HACs and Side B has 70; if A had a good FC they might well risk it.) But add titans into the equation, and it makes no difference how good Side A's FC is. Even if he manages to absolutely spank B's 40% greater subcap force, when B can use their titans to shut down the fight whenever they want, then Side A are ultimately at best winning a morale victory ("haha! made you use isotopes!") and at worst, just being a punchbag for B. 
---
Now I could go on for a bit how all of this seemed absolutely A-Ok with a lot of people as long as they had the titan numbers and goons played the punchbag - apparently *that* situation wasn't "Out of balance" at all, but now that it's their turn to be the punchbag, suddenly hey, this situation is bullshit!  Goons (and indeed INIT.) had to be the punchbags for a long time, and Olmeca, I can tell you we got good and tired of it.  I'm sure you were posting at the time how unbalanced that situation was, and I apologise for not reading those posts when you made them, but regardless, returning to the *status quo ante* of being punchbags for the one side that has supercapital dominance is not an acceptable outcome.  Whatever solutions you come up with need to take that into account.
---
But actually **I agree with you** about umbrellas - and what the hell, if it takes goons fielding multiple full fleets of titans to drive home the realisation for the rest of the playerbase, then so be it.  
---
I've long said that supercarriers and titans are fundamentally broken (balancing them with subcaps and even normal capitals, is like trying to balance Nimitz-class carriers and nuclear submarines with WWII ships), and the vast buff that they received in 2016 made them literally game-breakingly broken.  I'd suggest that the "Titans or stay home" reality of nullsec battles should be your real target.  Take away the overwhelming pressure to build titans because ultimately only titans count, and you greatly reduce the motivation to collect huge amounts of minerals and ISK.
---
I agree with Ab, the 2x utility highs are fantastic.
---
This is extremely high quality, a rare gem of EVE video making. Well done Olmeca.
---
You have my vote.
---
it's a small country, if you pick four random guys chances are someone will be related to someone
---
Not arguing, but in your case, you're making a lot of strawmans with no proof. I asked for examples, if you provide examples then i'll retract my statements. 
---
But using a 1500 dps Scorpion that jams everything as an example is not something that i can agree is "feedback", and more of a strawman to discredit/derail the discussion.
---
Yeah I made a lot of ISK in Hale.
---
Learned a lot about ~~paranoia~~ sensible caution and awareness too
---
Appreciate the comment but I have no idea what's your point
---
Another thought no matter what doctrine you bring if you want to truly negate the effects of his fights setup pings(Bookmarks) all round the structure. As his fighters get in range to do anything warp your fleet to a ping on the complete far side of the structure and force his fighters to burn after you. This can also negate some of the structure DPS as it will take him time to relock and apply damage/ewar. Asa note as well remember each time you reaggro the astra your pointed for a minute.

Congrats guys!  Exo is a good dude

Expensive lossmails if his reddit name traces to his character name.

Soz for that , wormhole J-Space , there are Combat Sites where whit 2 or 3 caps or battleships( a 2B fits+) you can feel PvE content , and if finish them whit no losses = 1-5B isk for calm lucky day :)

Should totally send Permaband to Eurovision,,,, you'd have all our votes :D

Don't they have a dating app thats like red light / green light, it's not your cousin
---
PI skills.
---
No but I don’t think you understand how exploration works. The sites don’t run out they spawn as soon as they are done in another system. This will mean you literally will always be able to find a new system with anomalies
---
&gt; and both sides have bots out the ass
---
Bullshit, if you roam Esoteria you'll be hard pressed to bots and the opposite is true in FRT space. The pie chart of shame showed you this as well.

It's not about what you like, Dunk, it's about what I like. Also the good of EVE or whatever, I guess. Anyway, how do I contact Sid?
---
I’ve played this game for almost 10 years and I’ve only ever had 2 accounts. For me the second account is almost necessary because I live in lowsec on my main and thus my sec status is tanked and I can’t go to highsec. The alt account was initially for hauling stuff but I’ve since trained skills for caps, logi, etc.
---
I’ve never felt the need for more than 2 accounts and I still often play with only one account when doing pvp in small ships.
---
&gt; Then it started great, "o shit that's a lot of ships" after that, they missed a golden opportunity to turn the running into a high energy chase like from Independents day when they were flying through the canyon.
---
My first thought was [Clear Skies 3](https://youtu.be/ehN1eS6HSro?t=3312).
---
Facts
---
The exploration site window thing (where you can see exact sites within a jump or two) is annoying for sure, and should not be a thing, at all.  In highsec maybe.  Elsewhere, HELL NO.
---
I bet you're a real blast at parties...
---
Maybe they'll enable 'Classic Mode' Exploration as a checkbox option.
---
How is wormhole space these days.
---
I flew with these guys for a hit and it was nice till one day they decided to clean house and cut anyone who wasnt trusted. Shame. 
---
Anyways congrats.
---
You are not making your ballot purely on merit. You are making it based on kinship first, and then merit. You are not electing the best people among the candidates. You are the best goons. So yes, this causes a nondiverse CSM body which is bad for the games health. It's not like other candidates don't have experience and merit. They have it playstyles other than yours
---
I never said anything about a 1500 dps scorpion. I was giving a very obviously exaggerated example to make the point. You are being single focused on base HP without taking ***anything*** else into account. That was my feedback, but rather than listen to me (or Capri) you want to argue specific fits without taking anything else into account. 
---
I also never said anything about carriers being balanced and yet you dedicated an entire paragraph as if I did to point out how unbalanced those are as if that justifies unbalancing everything else. 
---
You are the one writing blogs and proposing changes to our game while running for CSM without understanding the full impact. It isn't my job to do the research for you. This is exactly why CCP makes CSM jump through challenge questions before discussing topics with them.
---
Go find 0.5 security space and look for athanors that have their mining belts active, this is where you can get your A,B,C,G,S ore from

I miss combat relic sigs. The sense of accomplishment of getting stuff and living, a sense of progression.

---
Did we used to have constellation chat?
---
Players like you have not realised from 15 years that CCP simply does not have the resources to develop and make the great big sweeping game balance changes that we wish for. It will be another 15 years and we will still be wishing for said changes.
---
On the flip side CCP should start introducing small low effort changes such as this. Yes it may not be the be all end solution that will save t1 battleships but its a damn sight better than currently. Whats the worst that can happen? Will Stitch's suggestion break t1 bs? Oh wait... We are there currently....
---
You bring 100-200 hordlings in a baltec fleet. Durrr.
---
Null sec blobs jokes aside. 7-15 can do it as long as you are not fighting other ships to. Ferox is a good ship for this, go straight tank in the mids. Couple of logi and a drake for links. 
---
It will be slow with only 7 dps ships but it will die.
---
Unrelated: Do you have a contact for this group "XXX Entity"?  Do they have a diplo we can convo?  TIA.

Omfg yes

That would be awesome, this used to be in the game?

---
Any argument you have to say is invalid.
---
There are things you can do that make good money with one account. Running escalations, abysmal space, running incursions with a group, exploration/wormhole shit, market trading, faction warfare, I think you can solo high sec burner missions, and more shit I am probably not thinking about. As others have said though, having more accounts opens up more choices in what you can do.

Would actually be believable if we actually did get negwalleted but \0/
---
The crap narrative is strong with this one.
---
Sure so let's randomly role the dice. Fuck it. Every time you build a ship it should have totally random stats and bonuses. Let's not take anything into account at all.

Been there, done that and yes, Eve is a great way to distract and calm.

---
is changing stat numbers not allowed in this game?
---
&gt; I was giving a very obviously exaggerated example to make the point
---
Which is the definition of a strawman and not good discussion etiquette. It tries to derail talking points by making rediculous claims of might happen if "x" thing happens which is not realistic. As there is no battleship that can jam, do 1500dps and get 500k EHP all at once (even if these changes happened). The only battleship that is bonused to jams is the scorpion, which is why i mentioned it.
---
What you perceive as arguing is me trying to gain perspective. The internet is a fickle thing when its comes to how you perceive my retorts. I admit im not a nullsec doctrine expert, but both you and Capri apparently think im clueless about how EHP and HP work and have ignored the foundation of the article which talks about HP values primarily as a comparitive point. A discussion about T1 HP distribution is going to be using HP as a discussion point and comparing to other T1 ships.
---
The carrier comment was me doing a bit of "whataboutism" and thats my own fault in regards to discussion etiquette as you chose to lead with an exaggeration. We can call it even now.
---
And in my examples with capri, they had negligible changes on the ships he provided to me and i already corrected him on pirate ships where the bulk of his concern was. Which all those points were listed in the article specifically for the concerns he listed, but either did not read or didnt interpret. A lot of my issues is he didnt understand i was talking about HP and tried to undermine my talking points by saying im not using fitting tools for my numbers, which I was but he was not interpretting my article or comments correctly. I believe i should not bow over and accept what someone says when they arent reading the numbers and units correctly but provide the counter for clarification.
---
My comments show frustration because of those facts, but i never attacked him or tried to undermine his talking points. Merely showed him the numbers of his examples to help clarify the discussion.
---
What resources does intel cost? Litterally nothing you get handed it on a plate for free by CCP via local and esi pulls.
---
  
---
Delay local &amp; stop esi pulling, watch eve boom by 10X playerbase over a weekend.
---
Everyone else is misleading you, here's how it really is.
---
Playing Eve consistently for 500 months can potentially net you 1 Plex (on average). So in order to get your free month, you'd need to play consistently for about the next 250,000 months (20,833 years) but mind that those numbers are likely to increase with inflation. You CAN contract yourself to CCP for a free month, but you'll have to setup accounts for your children, and your children's children as a liability net so that they can continue earning isk on your behalf after you are deceased to continue paying the debt.
---
Glad I could point you in the right direction, happy to answer any other questions.
---
To clarify, 500 plex is equivalent to 1 old plex.
