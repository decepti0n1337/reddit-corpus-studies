you know i actually like that man usually we busy trading insults but GF sir.

Sounds like the Nyx pilot collected more of your tears than you collected from him.

Meh

&gt;do CCP took or will take any action about alliance who keep recruiting botters ?
---

---
no
---
&gt;Does it mean CCP remove any isk made from tax by botter ratting tick ?

in theory

So you admit you rage roll for the south.

What metric are you using?

The bigger story here is renters dunking a LZhawks super

Development of new features, and more importantly balancing current features and ships - has slowed from a crawl to a halt.

I mean they're usually already in their wormhole most of the time. This let's them roam easier.

Thoughtful argument. I'm convinced.

people looking at the title and going 'oh yet another dude advertising his shitty little discord server.'

A shame, considering that this is actually a neat service with lots of effort put in to it, but understandable.

ok, i'll bet 5billion isk on that

Haven't noticed any changes in horde since a Goon SIG dropped a  keepstar in Perimeter. Except perhaps a slight increase in stratops so we can shoot at it. 
---
Would never speak ill of J. Hemphill, who I had the privilege of shooting at in the failed defence of Fade last year. But on this occasion, he's wrong if he thinks this pointless additional structure  is causing any concern.
---
Until you fight them pod them and start doing hole control. Then they can just jump clone back and fight you for it. nty
---
Or you just run a pretty much free market, import stuff from Jita as needed, and have a few regulations and incentives as needed. Much easier and more fun for most people. I imagine there probably is someone out there who would get his rocks off running an alliance-level central planning committee but he's a weirdo.
---
Reddit is not your personal army
---
Just once tho would be that bad?
---
most won't bother because in the hours between getting killed you will mine 4 or 5 times what a barge is worth
---
Yes. The real sweet kids 
---
just join a nullsec corp that accepts miners who owns space, preferably one that is not in a renter alliance. You don't want to try mining in npc nullsec.
---
Ah so you agree ddosing comms is cool?
---
Assume this: once the gank starts, the ganker knows your maximum possible tank and has the firepower to overcome it. The goal is to never be ganked.
---
1) don't fit shiny modules. Those ORE strip Miners look compelling on paper, but once they turn up on a ship scan you're doomed. Fun fact: I've tracked down people who bought ORE miners from me so I could gank them and recover the module and sell it again.
---
2) Prioritize tank over yield. Fly a skiff or procurer. Fit it with T2 tank mods. The goal is push your ehp as high as possible to make the gank prohibitively expensive.
---
3) pay attention. Dscan works in highsec. If you see a handful of catalysts on d, align to anything. The second they hit grid, hit warp. There are other things you can do, but this is the most basic. Pretend you're mining wspace. 
---
4) expect to take a loss from time to time. Eve isn't risk free. Sometimes things don't go your way. Don't cry when you get ganked. Move on. 
---
&gt;"titan"-class ships -- enormous battlecruisers that can only be afforded by large groups of players pooling their time, effort and funds.   
---
That was a very different game
---
Nah this has nothing to do with me and mar5hy dropping. If anything Cowkiller was enthisuastic about me and BB cooperating in Delve.
---
I've just seen the thread. Looks like typical internal drama BB breeds from time to time due to its democratic nature. Wish they (and we when I was in) found a way to get along and just focused on killing stuff.
---
Cerebral Accelerators have been a great idea to make Events valuable to players. SP is valuable to most EVE players, especially newer ones. Even vets benefit a lot from these accelerators because they provide a much better ISK/SP ratio than injectors. Skins are a motivator to do the events, too. 
---
Why not keep this economy and add event items like they until now? I don't see a bad impact on the economy or the game if events are kept like the latest Rogue Drone or Blood Raiders event. Except for the few hours of hilariously broken loot table in the latter. Even though I'm not an indy guy the addition of blueprints and mining for accelerators was good because it gave more choices on how to play an event. It added more player interactions, that's good for a game based on player interactions.
---
But since permafrost events have been lackluster and weird. The Gala is something I can't ignore enough. Neither the Barbie Girl Skins interest me nor the mining with screwed up reprocessing values. CCP hopefully makes a better next event or it's time to scrap the event team and dedicate these resources somewhere else. Third time's the charm..
---
If you would like to elaborate how you see the economy affected by events, I assume negatively affected from your wording, I'd be very up to continue the discussion and see your point of view! :)
---
And how was that different before CCP was acquired by PA? You can always buy PLEX with RL $$ for ISK and buy character in bazaar for ages. If that is your definition of p2w, that ship has sailed ages ago.
---
Different people work in different parts of the game.
---
The team that made the new launcher is ( for the most part ), not the same people handling security, support tickets, game balance, skins production etc.
---
2019 post of the year candidate.

Man, all the subreddits are leaking this week.
---
You are getting so defensive, did i hit a nerve?
---
Maybe they are killing vnis because no one will fight till they have 20 supers? But no deffinetly not risk adverse at all now days. Highsec and lowsec gate campings and ganks have little to nothing to do with the OP.
---
jesus spodbrain. Take a break from the minning annom.

You take your off point lame counter agument and you go play rorqual online etc etc.

I've ganked multiple procurers. It's not always about profit. Sometimes it's about the message.

You know what they say about monkeys and space shuttles. If you have an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite number of space shuttles, eventually one of the buggers is gonna get the thing into orbit without the whole thing exploding.

I was completely impressed by their use of scumbags. I don't give a fuck how poor or shitty you are if you steal you're a scumbag.

Are you retarded?

He left 32 mil, scrub.

They're focusing on neither 
---
Meh
---
alright, fair point. my bad i forgot there were multiple, but they should listen to players more?
---
No, this idea would remove a large part of an eviction that already favours the defenders significantly 
---
The game is in a pretty good spot right now so I wouldn’t mind them taking some R&amp;R to create a system that is effective.
---
Hello incognito stranger with ambiguous flair and low post count who claims to remember me in-game! 
---
One does not need to be elite to take a dump on Horde. Horde pride themselves on being the *fastest* alliance to accept new members. For important ops, Horde need to borrow FCs from other alliances. Their SRP is issued in credits called Gobloons! XD
---
Excuse me, this is a high-risk pvp game.
---
:D indeed 
---
&gt; How should alliances police for bots if CCP can't do it with all their tools is the trillion isk question?
---
It depends like some bot owners are open about it if they're in smaller corps ( some will openly tell you there botting ). 
---
Now alliances have tools, like link the Teamspeak/mumble logins with ratting ticks, the guy's with a high difference between them are more likely to be botting, look at hours logged in generally if there on 24/7 that's not normal behavior ( you can pull this from ESI ). 
---
&gt; Punishing an alliance for botters renting from them when as players we have nearly no tools to determine who is botting is absurd. 
---
You not punishing, your removing items generated by exploiting the game. 
---
Why should players that do take efforts to avoid bots, put at an in-game disadvantage? over those that don't. 
---
&gt; It is not the players job to determine who us cheating and they should not be held responsible for failing to do so.
---
You not held responsible you're just no longer benefiting from them cheating. 
---
&gt;Let's go even further and say I find a member of my corporation botting and report them. How much of my corp taxes should I expect to lose for doing this? This is a best case scneraio and as a player I am about to lose something for it.
---
You lose something for reporting them either way, you either lose past money or future money, that's why some groups already made it a policy not to report friendly bots.
---
Worrying about straying to far from the hole is not really a problem. If your in a wh corp then there should be enough people in the hole to get you a way back. Or if your solo then you should obviously leave an alt or 2 in the hole at all times. This can be done with an alpha.
---
So your RMT business is doing pretty good huh?
---
You try to justify RMT by saying people may be in difficult financial position but play too much eve. I think stopping from playing and addressing the issue is probably better solution than stealing from game developer and wrecking the community that they are ‘heavily invested’ in... stop trying to justify RMT
---
This sub is a great example of why the game is failing. The community is shit. I'm getting downvoted for starting a discussion. Let's all just circlejerk about what a bunch of morons the developers are m i rite.
---
Are you mentally deficient?
---
&gt; jesus spodbrain. Take a break from the minning annom.

&gt; play rorqual online etc etc.
---
&gt; You are getting so defensive, did i hit a nerve?
---
Never mind I found the answer to my question.
---
This is precisely the kind of information I'm looking for. 
---
ofc
---
Delonewolf on youtube is kinda like that
---
I would really like to know how long the queue on the reported botter list is.
---
I've heard hearsay about certain bots that have been in the game for well over 5 years and get constantly reported.
---
My alliance has made a fun activity of killing astero bots and report them each time. Three years running still running into the same bots.
---
Maybe we should expand on the report bot game function. Make people that report fill out some information to help identify what kind of botting they witnessed.
---
This would be helpful too! I just remember that some agents almost always gave pirate missions.
---
The one good thing I came away with from this event after countless grinds... the Paradise Club is actually Guardian Angel's skinned citadel model. 
---
Easy to remember
---
it did. sane people always understood that mutiboxing and plex were basically p2w.
---
Yes
---
The whole post could be tl;dr as 'be like Imperium'.
---
I don't.  I think they might have to ping for more donations for their staging tatara first.
---
Because he had already done it before anyone had time to notice, sadly CCP has yet to add a Clairvoyance skillbook
---
It was sold the community as being exactly what it is - a way to ensure players voices are heard directly to the Devs. We provide advice and provide structured feedback, while representing the community. That's the point of it. That's what we still do. 
---
What kind of power would you want us to have? 
---
It was about 6 years ago now BUT at the time that was enormous.
---
Breakdown of the video for the psychologically exceptional:
---
- 4 rorquals with 4 sets of excavators. They show velocity on the overview as they just been launched and are orbiting the rorquals.
---
- About 7 seconds in, they all get recalled, on the same tick. Yes, including the fourth set which was further away from the rorq - you can see the direction change on the [tactical overlay](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tactical_overlay) on the same tick the others disappear.
---
- 2 seconds later, super fighters are launched.
---
It does look a bit shady to me, but it could be that he was just ready and waiting for you. Looking on his killboard, seems like he [fragged](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73895023/) some booshers before, so not inexperienced.
---
Willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but if you report him, there is a decent chance he will get banned. CCP can only use the server logs to see if you performed multiple actions on the same tick from the same IP. Doesn't matter if you're using macros, it all looks the same to them. Legit people have been banned before, part of the reason why Goons sperg out at these threads so much and are told not to report each other.
---
Part of me likes that this is the sticking point for most people. No one cares that you're doing it, just don't pretend you aren't.
---
HAI KINTZEL!! You are TEST's ugly floral wallpaper we haven't bothered to tear down because we can't be bothered.
---
I think its more to do with the newer chat system not respecting the original creator as an admin at all times, which it should, new chat system is best chat system, hell at once stage i, the alliance executor, had no ability to edit the alliance channels MOTD :P
---
So its more a case of getting them to deal with the lack of features on this glorious new chat system, the older system would have prevented him from kicking the creator and this issue would have resolved itself, the corp and funds aren't even part of the petition as yes those were taken within the rules and established systems of the game, the new chat system is still a shitshow
---
Considering you and I live in the same area, yeah...I recall. He was in that area in full force and I don't think he ever managed to kill anything there.
---
Maybe if CCP had added a proper chat backend instead of this shitshow they might, sadly CCP didn't :P
---
&gt;What a faggot
---
Bend over and we will find out. Thanks for the salt
---
I really wanna see that remark too.
---
Where, in all of the comments I've made, have I ever said that we're "censored politicians responsible for crowd control?"  It's not my job to control the crowd.  Do you see anybody but me even on Reddit on a regular basis?  I'm not here to cheerlead or talk up CCP. I'm here to engage with the community I represent because that's how I best get a broad view of things, especially from players outside my alliance or play style.  Crowd control?  I honestly don't give a shit if folks want to reeeeee all day on reddit. More power to you. I generally only step up when I'm trying to explain something or contradict some bullshit somebody is peddling. 
---
CCP's failure to deliver on things you want falls squarely on them. We can't force them to do what you want. We can't force them to do what we want. At best we can advocate for a position. If they choose to ignore us, that's on them. 
---
stealth please make RMT legal thread.

I miss my ugly wallpaper. You guys took it.

I mean like the interface that should ALWAYS have the channel creator listed as admin and not be able to be removed from the list, you know, the system we used to have before CCP clusterfucked the chat backend :P
---
delet panic
---
we already have b4r
---
No i mean Clairvoyance, Common Sense doesn't let you see in to the future, 2 very different things, and considering there was no indication that Cow was going to do this it would have taken Clairvoyance to be able to pre-emptively remove his roles
---
But thats just common sense :P
---
Ok. So to answer OP. Nothing much has changed since CCP was acquired except for better graphic, more ships and skins...
---
corp and alliance takeovers end with the original owner being thrown out on their ass all the time, why shouldn't channels work the same way?
---
I don't recommend you to use a Stratios for pve, say running relic or data sites. For combat sites in high or lowsec the ship can be useful, but out of that, you're taking a lot of risks and if people often tries to catch Asteros, which are very hard to catch, you'll attract more people with your Stratios. Keep using an Astero, it's safer and faster, and you'll save some money. 
---
When I've completed the transfer of emergency powers of the modverment to myself this could be arranged.
---
Okay, today we're gonna look at how to make waffles.
---
You're going to need some flour and a heat source.  If you know people who have flour, you're going to want a lot of them.
---
Combine your flour with other domestic goods and put it in the vicinity of the heat.
---
You probably don't want more than two or three hundred waffles.
---
They just added actual loot box mechanics with the last seasonal event. So Korea is starting to make its presence known.
---
But it took ke for ever your right tho ppl do love chasing me down in my Astero !!
---
Invites has expired
---
It can also do C1/C2 wormhole sites pretty easy
---
Sharnhorst's car/bus analogy was pretty on target. 
---
I had a feeling this happened
---
Nothing ambiguous about muninns.
---
Fair question whats the framework that coalition/alliance has to occupy under these conditions. If we for example rent out a space to botters are we reasonably liable for their behaviour / isk generation.  
---
I mean at the end of the day I'm not even sure how CCP would cast judgement over that unless its something to the realm of "we banned X players within this corp and you continue to let them in" maybe? ...its very sketchy ground.
---
Triumvirate is the kind of small group that could do something like this.  Tri also doesn't need this "guide".@

Then why is gobbins begging for donations to build infrastructure?

"He was armed and I feared for my life."
---
I dont think you understand what would happen if they made it legal.
---
Ok, so let say they dont. Whats to stop some one in the US, Russia or UK, who has a job, is well off or does it as a side job. Since they can pay for game time, and do this they can afford to undercut the other people who use it as survival. Because they cant really lower their "price". And then when multiple people start doing it, then it becomes a market, with .01 isking each other. Congrats now you just made a worse market, put people who you claimed "needed it" out of business/game. And made others richer.

As i understand and accept  possitive and negative comments , and yes i will hope one day  world peace become true  hehe  , we all know that never happen  so let keep on the csm
---
i just introduce myselft so let the comunity knows  just are topics that i believe should be talk about 
---
also YES i ask for help and feedback to the EVE comunity because is the comunity what truly knows  what is going on , what is been buggy , what is not , and i cannot be on every place same time  i am not superman even him have a trouble for that  , eve pilots choose to be on those places , and yes  been a CSM is  hear that player   not matter who is  , or who belong to  that is what i think or believe csm do 
---
last year  there was a very heat selection and  , wh , low sec was not having any representative, that is why i choose to represent everyone   not just one thing , or one area , because all of you make us  what we are , and all of you deserved to be listen 
---
low sec:
---
not having supers flying in low sec gave a chance to have a better use of  normal capitals and subcaps choices, not just  that  , it avoids any intervention of  stronger entities  as we can seen is happening  just cause have better or more supers pilots on the call, it will set a balance of low sec entities who can grow  or fall at their own way , when i am in coms i always listen to a pilot that camping tama was one of their best memories  he have  and been a low sec pirate was fun  and that is something i whould like to work to bring back , factional warfare  is another low sec point of interest as i seen on reddit and on the  time been playing  that some  of that groups have been moving to others regions , leaving  factional warfare cause  is not rewarding as it should be , like your words says on reddit FW is BROKEN , so let do what is on our reach to fixed  let do that goal and fixed  FW for the pilots to come in the future and the ones still around 
---
Null
---
as i said null is complicated  , we can do much and the same time we can do nothing just get another tool of explotation  , null have many things like sov  war , capital use or abuse , resources  , it is suppose  null is the most dangerous  part of new eden and it somehow players have made it safe  , that part is not CCP , is the pilots who have work  hard  people behind the alliances who hold sov are  extreme hard workings and the stories of eve  will be  just empty without them , behind of every null group is a very hard wroking people to make sure  their area is safe  or make it safe so they are thinking on behalft others players, what are they using tools yes we all have acces to the same tools CCP put in the game , but abuse or not , proliferation or not , all that depends on just us and how we want to use the tools, reason why  will need a lot of help  on feedback to use it and do or try to do the  right things not what is best to SOMEONE on particular
---
and you ask me this !Another thing; What do you think you would do if you were elected to the CSM?!
---
this is my reply 
---
i just could do  is listen , and work  to get it fixed , it feels good to help  i like that feeling and more when i know i did something good to someone else , we are humans after all have good days , avesome days and  super bad days , but in eve we feel so good and our actions matter, if it concerns about any gift about been csm  i just do want  any  , just making your voice be heard is all what it matters  
---
It means effectively they get 1 free fuck up on the majority of there cap pilots, it also means they likely get a couple of free engagements ( if they cycle pods that have there T3 clone ). 
---
Plus most wormhole groups don't have a problem roaming right now, so i really don't see the benefit you go on a roam and burn back home once done. ( like most groups already do this ). 
---
It would also give a massive benefit for well a lucky win on 1 timer, because it could mean week rest and the whole fleet is back. 
---
Realistically there aren't going to be repurcussions unless they're sure you knowingly harboured botters, especially given how cautious they are of banning bots.
---
It's 99% smoke and bluff to try get people to not support botters, but it's also there for that 1% if someone is dumb enough to get caught talking about it through in game mail or something like that.

Apparently the concept of a Corporation vs a Community is foreign to /r/Eve ? All the nullbears in here cheering because they think it means some sort of reprieve from getting dunked on when in reality, all this is, is an action that pushes groups of people out of the game. The same people who upvote the "here's why new people don't stick around" type comments and posts around here are the same people in here who act like the concept of a PUBLIC COMMUNITY is a foreign thing. Please, help **me** to understand?
---
If you mine in 0.7 or higher, you're generally safe as gankers tend to hunt in 0.5 and 0.6. You can still be waxed by a Catalyst if you're in a Covetor or Retriever.
---
If you mine in 0.5 or 0.6 in anything other than a Procurer or Skiff, you are at high risk of being ganked.
---
One easy trick to make yourself less a target is to orbit your asteroid or orca or jet can. Orbiting mitigates a ton of Catalyst damage (as you can move out of it's optimal range relatively quickly).
---
The best prevention is to set CODE. and Goonswarm Federation as -5/-10 so they are more apparent when they enter Local and be ready to warp out if you see Catalysts or Coercers on scan.

Using data isn't an appeal to authority fallacy you idiot.

Oh well, was good as long as it lasted to keep a bit playing.
---
It's a sign of an experienced player to always use the best ship for the job. A Strat is way overkill for a hacking ship. It's slow and expensive. It's great in sleeper caches though, and for PvP. Not to worry, you're still better than those plebs in highsec who use Orcas to hack. Stick to a frigate and you'll get the best experience.
---
I would love to live inside your brain for like 5 minutes, it'd be like riding a watercoaster. Just a massive brainwave plunge that pisses everyone off around you.
---
I am an old guy that on occasion came back and did some L4s for fun and relaxing. With this change this last thing that you could do as an PvE Alpha and get some decent income from will be gone and this i guess my last bits of interrest in the game will die as well.
---
I think this is somewhat lacking in experience. While there is a decent economic (as a whole) theory behind it, it is outside of the basis of reality that is NS...and most groups who can even consider establishing a dominating economic market presence have well established means to do so...for the folks who don't the stuff in this list is unattainable at worst, or unsustainable at best.

Do you got autism?

As a goon I don't understand the point of logi ships. They get terrible ticks and they suck for mining.

Pretty much how im using the rodiva, follows my main around or reps my ship on a gate
---
Great piloting and good video.
---
Really shows how garbage the wolf is in comparison with the retri, less damage, less tracking, less tank, less cap. The alpha is nice but it’s basically a non factor for most of those kills
---
You are kicking legitimate players in the balls as well if you remove combat L4s from them. Alphas are already very limited in their income sources in highsec.
---
TIL Aeg == Gobbins and asking for donos for a structure not paid for from alliance coffers is gobbins begging for donos
---
&gt;CCP recently posted their security update for Q1, and bleh bleh bleh, 4k botting bans, bleh bleh bleh. but what caught my eye was this particular sentence: " Aside from reporting botters and real money trading, the biggest help you can provide is not to give these **scumbags** any business. " i bolded the word that caught my attention. and im in no way encouraging RMT, **but some people need to pay off debt and they are heavily invested in eve, some live in poor countries like Venezuela and dont have any better jobs to get but they have a computer. Kind of like the runescape thing where its like homeless people drug dealing, its illegal but it needs to happen for survival...**
---
Some people need to get proper jobs. Plenty of people make a living through honest work even in poor countries. Stop trying to justify people being a piece of shit by blaming their conditions.
---
Fuck, if you have a computer with internet access, you can work remotely as a programmer.
---
Get the fuck outta here
---
Right..so you have no data and you're saying data i provide is in accurate (despite me literally saying that in the first paragraph of my opening post and it was to be used as indicative) yet when pushed ok, well..i've shown you mine, lets see yours..its you backing away like a little whiny bitch with "oh i don't have the answers, you're just shit"

---
I go to target so I don't have to associate with the riff raff at wal-mart. Feces is not for poor people 
---
Pretty much the only spot where they can really shine is small gang. This is mainly due to its lack of ability to split reps to multiple targets, and that it takes about 6 cycles to match the rep capabilities of a normal logi. Its other big strength is its speed. Its fast AF for an armor boat, so its great for kiting gangs. At full spool it reps about as much as 2 guardians, so its great at keeping your small gang's tank alive. But in large fleets where you have to rapidly swap rep targets, you will almost never match the rep power of a guardian. 
---
It means that CCP will no longer be accepting the excuse that we aren't responsible for the actions of those we recruit. Some alliances, particularly those who rent space, have been turning a blind eye to botters who move in. They either pay lip service to the problem or deny all responsibility, and they have a conflict of interest since rentals are a major source of income.
---
Since the botting epidemic is worsening and players are unwilling to police themselves voluntarily, CCP have reserved the right to punish the botter, its corp, and even its alliance as they deem appropriate on a case-by-case basis. This sends a chilling message to the likes of Kids with Guns and Fraternity and all the other alliances with a tolerant stance toward botting in their ranks. 
---
keep up the good work they only had 16 years to figure it out
---
Very cool and very legal

I think I understand why nerds seem to never get laid

FIRE UP MY DESSIE, I'M GOIN IN

I like RMT or wallet warriors as a pvper.  Just cuz you injected all those skills doesn't make you good. Then I get better drops!
---
Ad-hominem fallacy's is all you have in your bag of rebuttles... "yeah fuck you, &lt;insert name&gt;" you've yet to produce any hint of data to refute mine. So if data isn't the appeal to authority then what is, as i've established a baseline of "I know" vs "I think"..because i've sourced and cited data from reputable enough 3rd partys (hint, it was even in the title of the post).
---
All you've come to the table with is "I think"...opinions are fine, but thats the part you need to understand...its just your opinion....its not what you know..is all what you think.
---
To which i say, you probably need to do more thinking.
---
I heard rumors it was ex-DCU/DRF Russian with tons of crab money.
---
I have been for a while now at http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/
---
I gave a dollar value, you came back with a fuck you response.. now i'm saying beat or dispute the data value or shut the fuck up...  if you "think" its wrong, ok cool.. opinion noted.. if you assert its wrong...ok..back it up or shut the fuck up...
---
Dance around the subject but at least i had the balls to set the baseline with data points. You've just whinged.
---
You got me, excellent points and counter arguments, turn the baseball cap backwards and say "burn" out loud so mom hears i guess.
---
I appreciate what you do day in and day out. You guys get a lot of shit around here, so thank you.
---
Anyone robbing, smuggling, mugging, drug dealing, or whatever is doing it for survival. Botting is bad and proposing CCP allow certain bots to do it is completely stupid.
---
Sorry. Zero botters should be the ultimate goal. 
---
I would hate for you to lose your job man, but I will be waiting to get my number.
---
yeah, it's not unheard of. i've been offered to do it myself.
---
Thermal is the best choice if you don't want to be swapping ammo. 
---
Do you think CCP telling players that they have to do team security's job for them is focussing on it?
---
I think highlighting scumbag is really fitting for this post.
---
it is just the annual two year purge...

which server? i saw someone on another discord post saying they were only getting invalid links when clicking the link on reddit, but the link would work if they copied and pasted it.

I'd like to remind everyone that I proposed [Project Bot Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9aws5x/project_discovery_for_detection_of/) about 5 months ago. Didn't gain much traction back then, but is still possible.d
---
SC sub is maybe the only place with less free speech on reddit then the politics subs.
---
Come for the fleet, stay for the drama.
---
:popcorn:
---
&gt; As always, we’d love to hear your feedback, so feel free to hit the comments thread over on the official forums.
---
Good one! Ending with a joke, I like it :)
---
I want the CSM disbanded obviously.
---
I remember how it was sold having played the game since before the CSM existed. I remember the T20 scandal and various other incidents that made CCP want to formalise community interactions. Here's one excerpt of how it was sold (forgive me but I can't be bothered trawling further for stuff I once read years ago):
---
 "To achieve continued success, EVE’s society must be granted a larger role in exerting influence on the legislative powers of CCP " - Source : [http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/arts/PlayerCouncil.pdf](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/arts/PlayerCouncil.pdf)
---
If the CSM were given more influence to represent the players then gagging them from the start was quite a disingenuous first act in their brave new virtual democracy. 
---
I realise the potential for leaks etc without the gag, but we've had them anyway. I believe CCP wanted the good PR (and a focus group) - the 'Eve Society' expected to get more of their ideas into game.
---
Anyway the landscape of Eve has changed since back then - most of the pioneering devs are gone afaik and where CCP staff used to play the game a lot, interact on the forum a lot, even hide in player corps to get ideas and feedback -  it feels like now they are too afraid to do anything bold as they will get smacked down by marketing/legal/finance/community/whatever team if anything they say gives bad PR.
---
The power I'd like to give you is to say what you like about CCP - give your honest opinions on their future plans and whether you think their management and devs are going in the right direction, investing enough for getting more features/improvements and fixes the players want into the game to make Eve a better game in future. It is the same right we all should have - however you got to peak behind the curtain and now have a threat of legal action to consider.
---
If you were right, then the Chinese would own all of 0.0 as that's exactly what they were doing.
---
They do not.
---
You lost me at "carriers can no longer target subcaps." - That's crazy talk. 
---
Retribution's weakest long range ammo type does more damage than the Harpy's strongest long range ammo type. It may be a little strong :)
---
Sounds like a nice guy!
---
nah, this is pretty much the same boilerplate stuff they've said before.
---
"word on the street" is that people tend to say bullshit here and there, and being the wind propagating those bull shits is definitely not a proof of intelligence.
---
I still object a lot to the idea that it's perfectly acceptable to punish people for other people breaking the eula. 
---
"Hey guys, we can't enforce our own rules so we're just going to start punishing everyone".
---
Nope, its inside a container that can only be opened once looted. Container is some ridculous number like 30k m3
---
What’s keeping the local thing from happening sooner than later - if at all? It would be a great game changer, regardless of how it would curb botting.
---
&gt;Since the botting epidemic is worsening
---
Is it?
---
I have been playing for years and to be honest I don't feel like I'm seeing more bots, just more crying about it than there ever was.
---
A bit like how everyone is scared to leave their house because of crime. We live in the safest and most prosperous era of human history, the media just runs more scare stories than ever before.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSR7o5mMlEE&amp;ab\_channel=jackviciate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSR7o5mMlEE&amp;ab_channel=jackviciate)
---
So let's have a look:
---
Character:	Cacique Yuhasz
---
Corporation:	Spartan Vanguard
---
Alliance:	Test Alliance Please Ignore
---
History: Test and Provibloc. 
---
The character you present here has never lived outside of nullsec and maybe highsec. 
---
Like honestly not having lived in these area's makes you a poor pick, because honestly most of the time both area's need somebody to tell CCP how their change is gonna break set area, rather than somebody with creative idea's ( because CCP has plenty of idea's ).
---
I don't see you fulfilling that role because honestly lack of experience in most areas of the game.
---
that's not what he said. If you have more targets out it means more targets will be found in your space when a hole leads there, not that holes to other areas are ignored. 
---
Thanks yeah I wish the wolf was better it's really fast thought which means it can deal with the jag meta but the cap is really shitty hehe
---
Wow yeah retris damage is really good never flown rail harpy will have to try 😁
---
thanks !
---
I think they only mean that you'll lose all your assets and isk generated through taxing or otherwise harbouring botters. 
---
Why would switching to a new chat channel push people out of the game? I still don't think I understand the outrage. If I were in your position, I'd log into eve and join whatever the new BB channel is.
---
Focussing on botting/rmt are baby steps towards fixing the game. But that doesn't mean that it's not important or they should stop doing it and only provide gameplay updates. 
---
That post reminded me of the Tribunal System in League of Legends.
---
You have to pay for Nitro to use these anywhere but the original server right?
---
Why is BB and everyone involved always causing drama ? Olmeca\_Mold, Marshy etc. Must be that need for feeling "special". NCPL died for that sin tbh.
---
Thats cause marinate had validate points. I think the bad outways the good that could be done with it.
---
Dont get me wrong its a good start to an idea, but ultimately CCP should just hire more people and then use something like this internally
---
Retard.
---
So close to getting my vote for CSM, but fell short
---
Sorry should have been clear I was generalising when I said 'your own' meaning previous CSMs have suggested they herd cats and smooth the extremes of opinion to make it more presentable to CCP. - this is what I meant by crowd control - asking players to stop shooting the Jita monument or whatever.
---
I appreciate your time to reply in a sane manner, and like I said originally it is nothing personal at all. I'm against the CSM, not the people who are CSMs. I do realise often the CSM have become popular for doing something of merit for the playerbase - like Steve has!
---
I do feel CCP have failed to deliver on a lot of stuff for a long time, and the CSM being part of that process - need to own a share of that disappointment. You can stand up for what players want and tell players honestly if you think CCP is going in a bad direction can't you? Or is that a legal threat looming? The cynic in me says CCP wanted it that way though. The CSM as a buffer tank.
---
Scan Acquisition Array reduces the scan time, genius.  Scan Rangefinding Array increases probe strength.
---
Wave your dick around some more.
---
NOO NOT COWKILLER! he was awesome :(
---
Came expecting nuthin, am positively surprised o,O
---
&gt; i get its against the rules, however customers dont care about the robber robbing the store
---
I'm sure your local store would stay open for long if it would be robbed every week.

---
Chessur I thought you'd be mining in a rorqual by now. 
---
Yeah but no one likes you and frequently you have accused innocent players if botting so therefore you are the exact opposite of what is needed.
---
I though CCP stood for crap crap poop and that’s why they be so shitty
---
2 possibilities
---
Rich dude wanting to boson things.
---
A retard Who thinks camping in delve stops anything
---
Marshy got northern balls in his mouth. Getting belly rubs for his service for the north is actually enough for him
---
Next time valk pings shit..... Guess whosss going reeeeee at himmmmm...... but nice read tho..
---
Zarvox, Bjorn Bee etc.. never any drama. BB always drama. Must be the shitty leadership of BB
---
Well perception is reality as far as everybody involved is concerned.
---
But yeah it's pretty bad. In highsec I've seen the courier mission bots and apoc mining bots all over the place. Fleets of them that often outnumber the local residents. They're brazen and resilient too, returning within a couple of days of being ganked. It wasn't like that even a year go. Can't speak directly of null though since I only see Delve and don't PvE anymore. 
---
&gt; on days off
---
Yes, on a specific pattern. Not 7 days a week like a bot would be. 
---
Yeah, but most of those issues predate the acquisition by PA
---
I think I mentioned that too. Different games, different player bases, and different issues, but it's a cool idea
---
Bpos stay in highsec. Blueloot must be brought to empire to sell to npc buy orders so other stuff will be brought in and out too. Many holes have PI set up in them, usually taking it to P4 so its easy to ship. Logistics in a blockade runner or dst isnt too terribly dangerous, especially with scouts.
---
eve has been p2w forever.  you've always been able to use real money to buy plex to buy accounts or in game money or what not.   Injectors have made it a bit easier to both plex active accounts and to build new ones, but nothing has changed as far as you can spend money to be better.

Clean your ship....bam!

WAHH MY NANO CRUISER CAN'T SOLO 5 CARRIERS WAHH
---
Umm.  Were pics taken in Potato Mode?
---
Clean your ship. 
---
You got a dirty ship! Clean it!
---
All of my graphics settings are set to "high." Both screenshots are from the same client a minute apart: one from the preview screen for the skin, the other from the ship in space.
---
That's just it...it looks like they painted my ship with tempera paint!
---
Man. Wow. Like. Ah.
---
WTF?
---
You know there is actually a button in station to “clean ship” then you won’t have all of the black stuff 
---
It's a brand new ship! Do they start off dirty or what?
---
For reference, it's a brand new, freshly unpackaged ship.
---
clean ur ship
---
Dirt is life, sterile is death. Rejoice.
---
Cool story, changed our lives... keep insights like this public... it demonstrates so much.
---
I seriously thought everyone was trolling me about cleaning my ship, and now I feel like a doof.
---
I didn't realize that a freshly-purchased ship could be dirty, either.
---
Weird... Well, has far as I know, the issues you are having are over the "dirty ship" issue, even if it is a new one... In the same menu where you chose the skins, at the bottom, there is an "Clean Ship" option, just click on it and let us know if it worked o7
---
Fly the astero first, familiarise yourself with it first. The stratios is flown in a very similar way.
---
It did! Thanks! I seriously didn't know about that feature...plus I usually fly Minmatar ships so I doubt I've ever noticed it.
---
But yeah, it was a brand new ship, so I'm still not sure how it got dirty. I'm blaming the prior owner.
---
I got fucked at the used car lot!
---
I wonder if he can maybe use his multi-broadcast skills to act as a mass marketing solution. Like maybe rather than having Jita scams only occur in Jita you can pay him to use his Multi-bots to broadcast messages to all systems cloaked in...
---
There's a lot of missed market opportunity here.
---
PI in the hole is definitely profitable
---
The day that CCP starts paying alliance execs a salary to root botters out for them they can start going after the alliance till then CCP needs to stop being a bunch of cheap bastards and actually pay for an anti-cheat team.
---
They shouldn't, I love having dirty, *dirty* ships. 
---
right, but whoever has roles on your discords can come in can save them to upload on their own servers
---
nightmare is nice with the ab boost, scram doesn't instantly fuck you up. Typhoons are also nice with their speed, both are alot fun for me but nightmare is rare fun as its usually blinged out while typhoon is for the chill roams with t2 fit
---
It was only 7 days I believe
---
When your ship is ribbed for her pleasure 
---
My favorite so far is the tempest. You can use dual heavy neuts which wreck cruisers cap, and I love ac boats. I also really like the idea of soloing in a vindicator but I don't feel competent enough to make the risk vs the cost quite yet
---
It just space dust.
---
Imagine the convo:
---
GM: how can we help?  
---
Marshy: yeah, i need to get back my chat channel  
---
GM: ummm aren't you the guy we caught multi broadcasting? and has since been a constant reminder to the community on our EULA wishy/washy position?  
---
Marshy: so thats a likely no on the whole chat channel empathy front ..  
---
GM: upside is if you can't get the channel back you can always just echo your text to all channels instead...
---
That's cool I guess but it doesn't help me spread the Eve love. It's a shame Discord has this restriction.
---
So you're idea distills down to Ultima Online circa 1990's .."counselor" program. 
---
Cow probably got sick off the Olmeca and Marshy circle jerking each other on Reddit 
---
lol is this supposed to be a dig at my corp history? If so it's p weak. 
---
how big is the container?
---
Which **I've** certainly done, as someone familiar enough with BB that I'm aware of the situation. Now think about the composition of BB fleets... it's a lot of new players. They might not be in BB Discord/Comms etc. Their only "awareness" of anything BB happening today has been to get banned from that channel.
---
Maybe they loved flying on one or two fleeys and now they think they've been banned from flying with BB for something they did. Is that something you would condone for the Eve community?
---
I'll go into this specifically then.
---
1) He scammed a Chinese corp in Midas22 out of the deposit of their dreads after he decided to move to TNT. He took the deposit and didn't make a single dread. This has literally been confirmed by two different leaders in the former RMC, and was not something that was "approved by RMC leadership" 
---
2) He built a Thanatos for Jen and an Orca for Mukali. He took over a month to build both of them after telling them he was going to be a week and a half. He then contracted the Orca to Mukali and 30 minutes later deleted the contract and put it up in another private contract instead. This wasn't rectified until a few hours later when Mukali sent him a message asking what the fuck was going on and he said that he had another customer that was willing to buy it now, despite now having accepted the contract either by that time and that it would be another build-time wait for Mukali.
---
3) I literally pulled THE EXACT SAME SCOPES THAT TEST REQUIRES. LITERALLY THE SAME SCOPES. The fact that your bias makes you as uninformed as you are unintelligent is not my fucking problem.
---
This is exactly what every Legacy alliance requires of ALL OF THEIR LINE MEMBERS:
---
[Image 1](https://i.imgur.com/1J2uSDA.png)  
---
[Image 2](https://i.imgur.com/aT5hjfP.png)
---
Coincidentally, this is also the exact scope requirements I asked for on SeAT.
---
Here is a direct quote from their conversation
---
&gt; WelstielToday at 1:11 PM
---
&gt; The scopes being asked for are pretty common.  I've asked them and been asked the same for every group i have been with over the years.
---
&gt; Not sure if you've used the Seat tool before but it's also really awesome for corp management
---
&gt; Rayn0rzToday at 1:51 PM
---
&gt; I did use it at some point and stopped requiring it. And its not usual to ask this in Alliance level, I would understand Corp level. If it is standard, this would be required in Imperium in general but they don't, even in RMC.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If intel was the concern, I can also say that My Corp is not comfortable sharing this kind of intel to someone we just met 1-2 months ago. 
---
&gt; Now this below is okay.
---
&gt; publicData
---
&gt; Allows access to public data.
---
He's OK with Public Data, and also, I had been with the alliance over 4 months at that point, which makes him even more of a retard. But, seeing as he didn't interact with anyone he couldn't scam, I guess he wouldn't know that. Khendon and I didn't see eye to eye on everything, but boy he got it right about Raynor being a gigantic fucking moron and scumbag. The same guy who isn't doing background checks expects the people doing CI for the alliance to operate off of public data. It's almost like he's trying to hide his botting and RMT or something.  
---
&gt; I seen the chats between him and Weistel, and those two simply did not get a long what so ever.
---
This literally makes me want to vomit. The only reason that "corp" was allowed to remain was because of Welstiel. Literally every single other person was clamoring to get rid of them, but Wel felt that the alliance had a responsibility to at least somewhat take care of whatever arrangement Raynorz had with the original exec. Welstiel was civil beyond the point of ludicrous patience. 
---
So yeah, there's the proof I guess. Welstiel can come in and back up everything I've stated as well. You're welcome to listen to the pathological liar though instead of the guys who were dealing with these issues day in and day out. Also, on the topic of RMC not requiring these permissions, they required every corp who registered on UFO to have full perms on a director character to apply for any of their services through UFO/Scalie (SRP, Squads, whatever). So every single corp had to have at least one "director level" character when they were doing the switchover from their old auth to new. The transition never completely finished, and it's not like anyone from Raynorz did anything other than krab anyway, so I'm sure he was as "unaware" of that as everything else.
---
we aren't really using it, you can have it back if you want it.
---
Appreciate your response. That's unfortunate and I encourage your folks to rethink that choice. It would simply an isk sink for isk that should not be in circulation in the first place.
---
rumor has it gabloons has some pretty deep pockets since he didn't spend any of his market money on his alliance.
---
And then imagine patting yourself on the back for your masterful move when he kills the dumbest most shit fit idiots you've ever seen and thinking its money well spent.
---
Tempest is an unsung hero in solo BS work, its probably the best all around of the non faction t1 BS
---
I liked taking my shield vindi out when I lived in a c3/ns but I lost 2 to a dread and a titan as the playerbase is so fucking trigger happy to drop caps on anything that moves.

well its only 5$ for nitro :D

Ah yes. Pedantically insinuating I’m the childish one because you have nothing of real substance outside of your bitching about how everyone should play your way and people who don’t feed to your elite PvP skills are in fact just risk averse rather than just smart enough to not take a lopsided and pointless fight.

Clone soldier tags, exploration, combat salvaging, abyssal deadspace, and nullsec combat signatures/anoms all come to mind as things you can do as an alpha, and all of which have higher income potential than alpha-skilled l4 running. Yes, you might have to leave Niyabanen and maybe even join a corp but don't make it sound like there's no PVE you can do without paying a subscription. If you're dead-set on running missions in highsec l3's really aren't that bad either; it can be fun to find strategies to speedrun them in well-fit cruisers. 
---
This is one of those moments "I'll answer on behalf of CCP as we all know they won't"....  no watch the comments for that said answer.
---
According to LinkedIn there are 27 engineers, 8 Development Managers, 2 Security Analysts and 11 producers.  Yesterday it was confirmed that 2 analysts do the manual processing of all inbound security issues but automation is likely in the mix. LinkedIn shows there's a couple or more automation engineers in the company.. so...using linkedin and only linkedin...  
---
Probably not? ..but...thats for CCP to answer :D
---
Best BS in the game since its inception. Fucking monster.

If you read the proposal you'd notice the plan was doing it anonymously.

ITT: Fleckstorm and multiple other people disregarding the concept of a public community, that reaches out to new players and helps funnel them to legit Corps in Eve, and how a new player could be adversely affected from being banned from said community.
---
Also ITT: Circlejerking because apparently people aren't aware that BB != Marshy?
---
So to clarify Fleckstorm, since you felt like calling me out, can you explain why what I'm suggesting gets downvoted in this thread about BB and Marshy, yet the same concepts of killing community are **ruitinely** rehashed in threads involving the longevity of Eve and helping more new players get into the game? I mean...you know...other than spin and null politics I mean?
---
I am from Minmatar and I feel offended 
---
What's wrong with it now?
---
Tell me its still viable. Restore my bitter old heart.

The biggest gap in his killboard history is 7 days, so its possible he got a 7 day temp ban, but he and his supporters insist he was on vacation and not banned.

But what he was screen capped doing is not one of the allowed uses.

You understand this OP is about an area and not "everyone" correct?

You invent points made by me, because you have no real argument.

I'll check your abyssal discord out - I set up one when I started streaming to get people that were interested in the abyss (both veterans and newbs) in one place. It'd be nice to have a bigger, more organized one. 
---
It was a genuine question. I'm asking what's wrong with now that wasn't before.
---
thanks :)
---
Your wrong. So there's that
---
hype for the hyp
---
hey welcome! you can upgrade your ship with modules (using the fitting menu). you can get modules off the market or sometimes as loot. if you want to test before you buy, the fitting menu has a simulation mode to see what modules you can fit (a neat feature tbh). you can also get skills from the market! most are seeded at npc stations (these are usually in starter systems). these can be injected &amp; trained via your character sheet (your character portrait at the top). when you open the skills menu you’ll see the queue where you can drag the skills to put them in any order you want (as long as you have the prerequisites)
---
as for getting the most out of the game i would suggest finding a corporation (check out the in game recruitment channel or the official forums) because this game is the most fun when you find a good group of pilots. it’s a great way to learn from established vets &amp; also experience the wide variety of content. don’t feel the need to rush anything but try anything you can :) 
---
Because TEST is garbage and im not going to give them my money. If TEST wants to be in the business of being THE trading hub then they should pledge complete neutrality and stay out of all wars and any type of combat for good.
---
Thank you for expanding the discussion with your well thought out and insightful comment. 
---
ECM doesn't stop them locking you. When jammed you can only lock the thing jamming you. So if it's a EC drone you can lock and kill it. If it's a scorpion, well it's worthless 
---
Yep.  Started solo PVP'ing in this thing in 2006, been my favorite battleship in the game since I started.
---
No matter what the meta changes to, no matter what modules get nerfed and buffed, no matter how the game mechanics have changed, this ship has been able to adapt to them all.
---
Yeahp.
---
Flexible morality is the killer I suppose 
---
I'm not gonna lie, I really like everything you put there. There isn't a single thing I dislike. As someone who has had a lot of Alphas in my corporation since the introduction of clone states, after I explain to a lot of them that it makes more sense to work an extra hour or two to buy PLEX rather than grind, most of them go the pvp route anyway, so being able to use stuff like VNI's is far less desirable.
---
Oh, you can lock the jammer now? Sorry for the dumb questions, I just came back after a hiatus for a year or so.
---
Ca)ing them can when it isnt their tag is confusing lol.
---
I was so confused when I came back and my mining frigate was now bonused for logistics 
---
marshy get his payment regardless, he dont need bb to do stuff, he likes to share easy kills with bb, since he already got campers here and there, the ratters in those systems are relaxed because they get used to having the neuteral in system.  
---
remember like 1-2 years ago, when getting a carrier kill was a big deal?  
---
marshy has helped BB way more than whatever he has used it to for personal reasons if he ever did that.  
---
I killed a vni while AFK in a vni before.

Go ahead andshow me that story About Somalians ganking and aircraft carrier
---
Now shut the fuck up
---
They beat them with water cannons it's pretty hilarious
---
I respect and encourage this type of game play 👍
---
How did you buy it? As long as they're assembled I do not think they accumulate dirt / wear from what I have heard. Regardless I assume you're were able to clean it.
---
It's pretty cool to see this effect + killmarks on a ship. In a fleet you really see who might've lost their previous ship in combat since they're in a clean one. I have a Machariel that have survived for probably over a year by now, somehow. Haven't lost it even though I've been primaried several times in large fights. ~13 killmarks and very dirty, but that makes it unique to me.
---
You sound too new and too passive. If you recruit highly skilled players they'll probably walk over you, learn a bit more first by playing with another group.
---
 
---
Otherwise, get ready to embrace failure *a lot*, which is fine. I burned 3 corporations before I got it right.
---
I prefer Praxis/Tempest
---
especially praxis
---
I'd advice not using Stratios for pirate relics and data sites. Astero and T2 exploration frigates are superior for this role in every sensible way.
---
Stratios is slower and attract much more attention than frigates. Don't fool yourself with idea that you could properly fight back just because you use cruiser instead of frigate, because:
---
1. Your attacker probably just would bring something stronger to kill you.
---
2. People who use Stratios for relic or data tend to be unexperienced in combat. I'm not trying to brag, but I killed more than one such "exploration" Stratios using my humble exploration Astero, just because they hadn't know what they were doing.
---
Yes that is correct. So in a 1v1 a midslot ecm module is useless 
---
It has better ehp and speed than guardian.
---
It has worse initial logi power but It has niche to be used when guardians can’t tank.
---
Even for sleeper caches and ghost sites Astero is probably overall better. So I don't see use for Strat in any hacking activity.
---
The ships that had more use are usually more fun.
---
You need near perfect skills or an oneiros while you can get away with logi 4/ remote rep 4 on a guard much easier 
---
Gila is far more efficient though.
---
I can't really blame them when you're in a Vindi. A Vindi will eat anything below a cap alive to be honest, unless it's something like a kiting Barghest which is almost designed to kill a Vindi tbh
---
Not quite.
---
Strat is good for the standard and superior ones where you have to be able to tank a bunch of damage to get as much loot as possible. Or have you figured out a way to do those in an Astero too?
---
ngl I've been jealous of your job ever since you responded to my extremely elaborate case for being unbanned for trolling from the forums with a polite version of "nah bruh"
---
&gt;there's good plans coming together for the future.
---
You're such a fucking tease.
---
Listen to this guy, he knows what's he talking about.
---
It’s still useful on an active tank drone boat if you have the spare mid. You would rather the enemy shoot you than defang you and relocking drones is a pain for anything larger than a destroyer.

Drifter holes are pretty cool, 102 wormholes

As for getting the most out of the game, EVE is quite possibly the most overwhelming game to first get into in terms of all the options you have. My advice, find yourself a veteran to be your guide, the tutorial's not much help and, frankly, you'll have hundreds of questions as you learn the ins and outs of the game and plenty of vets are willing to help. You can PM me here on Reddit if you're looking for some help and I'll be glad to assist, I do it all the time because new players have the most contagious enthusiasm :D  
---
So I guess they just continue to ignore this one then?
---
Which had been reported many times. Oh and Evictus haven't done anything either

My issue is random suicide gankers, not code... code is easy to deal with because you are easy to identify.

The old tracking dreads could still kill subcaps before HAW came out.  Even regular siege guns (non HAW) can kill T3s with enough support.

Astero can easily do standard and superior Sleeper cache. I will give you a hint, the rest of the fit will be up to you. "Dual Rep" 
---
The channel creator can ban anyone from the channel.  Therefore the whole "channel creator is contacting GM's" is laughable.
---
I'm not sure right now because I've did them some time ago, but I believe with Astero you have problems only with Mine and Archive Rooms in Superior site. I just skip them, because I get a good part of loot without them and because it looks like Archive could kill you even if you use blinged T3 cruiser, so I think it don't worth the risk.
---
If I remember correctly, all the other parts are doable with Astero.

Getting a proper job is one thing. Saying  "if you have a computer with internet access, you can work remotely as a programmer" is another thing entirely.
---
   
---
I'm a programmer. I have been since the mid 90s. I taught myself everything I know about it. Working remotely is generally reserved for those who instill their employers with a sense of trust that the job is in good hands.
---
Further - not everyone has the same capability to learn that you or I have. Guess those idiots are just screwed, huh? 
---
I believe qualification and competence is not always the same thing, especially looking at where we are right now.
---
Common Sense skillbook would have prevented this as he would not have given owners rights to someone else.

Why the fuck are you using LR guns on a dreadbomb?

Because there were a large portion of people that thought injectors were the same thing as buying characters off the bazaar.  Whenever someone objected they immediately get downvoted to hell.
---
You could even tie it to lore easily with Drifters or Sleepers or Triglavians.
---
Triglavian UFO just decided to kidnap you but then they realized that you're agly and abandoned you at Tama. Good luck brickface.
---
That's not simple, especially for you. How are you going to judge if an alliance leader knew X character was botting? How do you prove what someone knew/didn't know? Unless they're monumentally stupid and left some kind of obvious paper trail bragging about bots in their alliance?
---
I'd say it's a better metric for the health of this subreddit. 
---
**New to PVP and risk in Eve, most certainly.**
---
Trust me, I know. Have you ever flown with a BB fleet before? Hung out in the chat channel and answered newbro type questions? If not, then I don't really think you know what you're talking about, do you?
---
How long did it take?
---
A sensible comment about bots. Holy shit.
---
&gt; suppose you just try to make less of them
---
Realistically, isn't that just how it is with everything? Perfection really only ever happens on accident
---
Don't you sometimes feel like you're am the crayon eating shitfit noob in the other person's video? I sure do.
---
Yeah that would definitely take 30 seconds, checking every single character in goonswarm.
---
r/unexpecteddwarffortress
---
np, any time
---
Ok here the issue i and i think ALOT of other alliances is. Should we report and kick these people? 
---
Because once that happens the unload all their sp and isk and make new toons making it harder for you guys to take all of their assets.
---
Or are we just supposed to wait for you guys to ban them and not kick them so you can take their assets but we would know of them and could get banned?
---
We keep kicking but the bots dont stop if they can move assets.
---
But since CCP is not transparent in the slightest with who they have banned, how is anyone supposed to know? How are we supposed to know which corps are the worst offenders? Take the large alliances, 100 people bailing is probably A typical week. Who would actually notice?
---
Just imagine, you get a ticket for $600.  Ticket just says you did a bad thing. You ask the judge when it happened, he says you know. You ask where it happened, he says you know.  Perfect system...
---
If CCP published the data, you could easily push enforcement back to the players like CCP has been pleading.
---
Oh look, Corp X is part of Alliance Y.  Well boys, guess who we are beating into a pulp this month!  Then you will see which alliances actually put money where their mouth is when it comes to botting and RMT. 
---
Until there is transparency, there will never be accountability.
---
&gt;It was sold the community as being exactly what it is - a way to ensure players voices are heard
---
Yeah, exactly, hence loosing its purpose. Its like buying deaf friend buncha songs on iTunes, end result is the same.
---
I fly an Imicus or Helios. If I'm in a high traffic area then a Astero, but usually one of the other 2. Imucus is the best bang for your buck in the entire game.

About as useful as your input .

Can you link even one example?

[HOLD YOUR FIRE, this man isn't black.](https://youtu.be/H1QKyB_0P0E)
---
Yeaaa
---
I’ve actually been going through all the various battleships in solo small gang and I’ve pretty much flown them all at this point so I’ll give you my comments and fits on the notable ones:
---
Typhoon:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74567208/ (cruise brawl)
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/62233259/ (Rapid heavies although I currently fly with less hyper spatial)
---
Easily the best kiting t1 battleship, the rapid heavy fit is an absolute monster. The brawl setups are lacking because of missile application but the cruise brawler is pretty decent and unexpected.
---
Hyperion:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74475862/
---
Without any doubt the best brawler with the tank bonus, best tracking weapon system, double webs and massive dps. However the reputation of the Hyperion makes the engageability really low, so not my favourite.
---
Armageddon:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73883910/
---
Another amazing ship with a reputation issue, the neut bonus, while awesome, means that people fear you and you’re likely to get turboblobbed.
---
Praxis:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73595169/
---
Really good brawler with a nice mix of everything and lots of cool utility. However it has 2 major issues in speed (slow as dicks) and lack of insurance (although the hull was initially really cheap)
---
Tempest:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/72491279/
---
As mentioned by others, one of the best. Great mix of range, dps, speed and utility. Also very engageable since it doesn’t have an insane reputation. 
---
Dominix:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/72403820/
---
Insanely versatile and unpredictable. A little bit slow but has the awesome drone bonus so you can deal with any ship size. Also a great slot layout.
---
Abaddon and Apocalypse(lolwut):
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/71757016/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/69860268/
---
They can both be troll blaster fitted with very decent stats and tracking as long as the opponent is grappled. These have the best engagements cause nobody knows what the fuck is going on.
---
Megathron:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/70387706/
---
A shittier Hyperion with no utility high and less drones. Kinda garbage in comparison but sexiest hull and more engageable
---
Where are the shield battleships??!
---
I am not a big fan of shield when going solo battleship since it severely lacks utility and you are pigeon holed into XLASB or bling since t2 boosters are useless. XLASB has the issue of needing 2 slots and massive fittings and if you don’t fit a cap booster (most don’t) you lose your invulns if neuted and consequently a shitload of tank.
---
Although honourable mention to the rhml raven that I’m currently flying. It’s not bad.
---
I've seen some ridiculously good outcomes with some of my corpmates in solo Rattlesnakes. There are so many fitting options, that you can be relatively unpredictable. 
---
I love the Tempest, but I feel like I never quite know how to fit it for solo work. It's really the low slots that get me.
---
please do not make posts like this the job of ccp_FALCON is to make bullshit meme posts not address actual customer concerns!
---
the people who are supposed to address those things were fired a year ago ;)

---
Solid nag fit bro
---
That fit is beyond your IQ. 
---
It means ccp will take action on who'm ever they feel like is harboring illegal accounts. So in short, if one to many pops up in a region, lanlords are in for a surprise.

I know this guy who'd always present his new titan to us, but can't be bothered to hit "clean ship" on it...
---
I do think at the extremes of multiboxing you will find heuristics are used both to reduce the amount of information processed, to reduce the complexity of movement, and to reduce the required accuracy and impact of mistakes.
---
The clients all have the same layout and actions are typically batched as repetition of a simple sequence which requires ideally only a single repositioning of the mouse for the entire batch of actions.  This is much easier to reproduce quickly and less prone to error.
---
I've found also that focusing on color is absolutely key.  There are a lot of common tasks I reduced when I was multiboxing to just scrolling rapidly through the windows (at like 10+ windows per second) while looking at one spot for a change in color.  The change in color would indicate that one or more clients had completed actions or were otherwise not in sync, and I could make a very accurate guess of which clients needed attention by the timing of the color changes. 
---
As the mouse will have already been positioned for the action at the start of the batch, it's then just a matter of scrolling through a second time bit more slowly and clicking as the clients pass.  If it's a null action for clients that do not need attention I can scroll through more rapidly and start mashing the button shortly before the client should have input focus and keep mashing it until after the client loses input focus.
---
I don't think many of these examples are remotely superhuman.  They are in pretty much every case running fewer clients than I used to and to be perfectly honest the reactions are glacially slow for someone frantically pulling drones as the autistic kid obsessed with excavator hunting lands in their site.
---
It’s great to throw out in addition to a solid guardian wing. You can also heat the rep forever (same as trig guns) which people don’t seem to remember reduces cycle time to ramp up significantly faster. Awesome for multiboxing too.
---
Yeah sure nobody cares
---
A long ass time... 
---
Is my guess.
---
&gt; You understand this OP is about an area and not "everyone" correct?
---
You understand that the whole chain of comments that has led to this point is me saying that area would be dead, and you saying *everyone* is risk averse in response?
---
The beauty of the internet is that you can go back and read what both of us said. Maybe try that next time before projecting your nonsense onto other people.

I think a vindi would be.. not great, given that the meta is very kitey so most people will just kite you. maybe I am just bad though, don't let your dreams be dreams.

---

---
to be fair to CCP, their pricing of skins has become less offensive as of late. aside from the eros blossom skins - 250 for a destroyer skin that looks pretty 'meh'? yeah, i'll pass.
---
still not reasonable prices, but certainly not as offensive as they were.
---
now we just need some decent looking skins to buy for a non offensive price.
---
Yeah I think you’re missing the point of his question here. 
---
Isn’t that just your posts?

Look for the entrance to Eso and try to sell it to Progod maybe?

99% of ships out there will kill your helios before you get a second cycle off on that burst jam, so it'd better work the first time.

indeed, all most skins are is a 2 colour palette swap, and maybe a different logo - really can't be that difficult to let us make our own.

What's your interpretation?

I'd also say that recently the less active the subreddit the better for the game. If you wanna enjoy the game you better dont come here just to be told how shitty it actually is anyway.

Dual armor rep, rapid heavy TyFI. Toss in drugs and askleps and you've got a monster against small gangs if piloted well.

Hey thanks man, that's exactly what I was looking for! I'm seeing that the Tempest and Typhoon are a common theme, so I'll be trying those out next. 
---
I'm also super interested in trying out the Abaddon and Apocalypse, I was never able to get a fit on them that I was satisfied with until now.
---
Not that I know of because it depends and isn’t always a set amount of hours or days after.

Myself and some friends are getting into/learning to play EVE together, and were wondering: is it possible for a small gang of Alpha clones to destroy player-owned structures? (I think they're called Upwells?)
---
If we were going to do something like this, what types of weapons/ships should we be going for? Are certain structures easier to attack than others? Mainly we just want something to blow up, but any advice is welcome 
---
Oddly enough, its a reddit phenomenon. Most people on comms and standing fleet fully understand and even encourage BB (in order to trap and frag them via smartbombs or bosons or w/e)

You only need about 80 scan strength to find all relic sites. Unless you’re running sleeper caches you should be good with just fitting rangefinding arrays in your free midslots and using sisters probes

This. Generally speaking, if I see a Stratios running relic and data sites while I’m also flying a combat fit T3C or a Stratios of my own, I would consider it a free kill if I can catch it. 
---
As a theorycrafter and somewhat regular zarmazd pilot (from soldier's video) i think it's usable in very narrow amount of cases:
---
- as logistic ship for small amount of drekavacs (especially 100mn as they tend to spread around alot)
---
- fighting against triglavian ships (idk why elise' comment got downvoted, he's completely right)
---
- some low-APM 2nd-3rd window support for key ships which are likely to be focused (e.g. something with jamms naturally attracts some attention at least from targets that are jammed)
---
Personally, i have experience only in 1st application. Basically, for zarmazd to work, you need your ships to not die during in 30 seconds after being focused. It means that it's either micro- or small-gang scenario where base ship buffers are high enough to not be bursted by dps of gangs you're willing to fight, or higher-scale fight where buffers of your ships need to be significantly higher (plates, trimarks, slaves). For micro and small gang this logi competes with 100mn loki which is also very strong (has decent sig and facetank, decent RRs, has links). Loki wins almost every time because of links, except for the case when you already got your link needs covered. Decent armor buffer + links = dreks (these can do up to 2 links without significant sacrifices).
---
Outside of drek-heavy gang i cannot imagine picking Zarmazd over loki for small gang scenario. Zarmazd still has (minor) advantage - it has much better resilience vs ECM, as it has space for smartbombs vs ECM drones, has higher base sensor strength and it can fit local sensor booster. To have all that, loki has to bring CD backpack with RSBs and smartbombs - which is not an option when you don't have second window.

It’s a fine line, and often a frustrating one. Most often, the only way around the NDA for someone on the CSM who hates the direction the company is taking is to not run again and quit playing. That’s happened, sure, but it’s been a while.

There are obviously going to be differences between this group and an actual legislature, even if there are similarities like voting. We can’t force them to do anything, obviously. 
---
We do have the power to tell you gus generally speaking how we feel about future plans and management and the like. We just can’t get into specifics about specific things, or relate stuff that was given to us in confidence or of a proprietary nature. Everything I’ve seen over the last year makes me think the company’s moving in the right direction, they care about EVE and they’re trying to make it better. 
---
If I didn’t think that was true, I wouldn’t say that now and I wouldn’t be out explaining things that I think the community gets wrong - which, honestly, i usually only do when it’s something dumb like PA related conspiracy theories.

PI is good money any day of the week.  get your ass in a wh or null and find out what others are doing to see a need, it does not help to supply the market with things that no one needs . the best market is word of mouth.

We are creatures of habit.

Learned how to see. It's a goddamn miracle everyone, this cancer of a sub actually cured someone's blindness.
---
If you are going to go to RENs go to Tanoo and take advantage of all the facilities we have on offer. In game Channel: IFROD Public 
---
was hoping to fight you guys once again. good times. 
---
i know you're baitposting but be careful, some people honest to god believe this is why other players want their krabmachines nerfed.
---
So - just a question. If the game is so shite, and P2W like you say - why are you still here? 
---
quit trying to use logic and grab a torch and pitchfork and play along
---
So not played Eve much recently because of real life. I thought I’d purchase a raptor and fly around a bit without worry laugh out loud, well I caught in a bubble and killed!!!! Then I read on an update that raptors are no longer immune to bubbles. Is it now only type 3 ships that are immune?
---
OMG YES IT IS THE UNITED NATIONS RULED IT WAS SO IT IS
---
Which makes me wonder if Stratios could be successfully used as a baiting ship...
---
Original post with more detail and discord screenshot, full ts recording got nuked by Reddit mods :/
---
I mine for materials at the moment. Can fly the exhumers. 
---
Maybe if the guy hunting you doesn’t use zkillboard. 
---
And he i was planning another dread roam, and i wouldn't be able to shoot back. That sucks.
---
Blowing up structures with a small group is possible, and you’d probably want to use AB fit battleships. Probably apocs or tempests. 
---
The problem is blowing up the people who own the structure, because odds are they have plenty of friends who are omega and will easily outnumber you, timezone tank it into AUTZ, and fly more better ships with booshers and t2 logi. 
---
Not sure exactly what you would want to do, but I guarantee structure bashing isn’t it. It’s either you get dunked or shoot a unmoving structure for a few hours (counting all timers) for no reward
---
unless they wanna go fast.
---
My advice from a midterm player ( about 4 years w/ breaks). You need to find a way to make money. I did high sec incursions. I ran with a group called Warp To Me, you can find them in game. They are a group of people that do high sec pve, decent isk for your time and really good for new players. They teach you a lot about flying in fleets, using fleet broadcast, following fleet commanders and their commands. You don't need to be in any corp, if anything you will learn how to make your own, just to reap a few extra  tax benefits. It is a great place to start out, make isk in a realitive safe space, and an awesome way for a new player to branch out and make friends. Good luck to you and fly safe. 
---
My parting words. Don't get wrapped around losing a ship worth "a lot" of isk. Instead, learn what you can from each fight. Most pilots will give you a quick brief of the fight and why you lost or how they got you, as long as your not salty and willing to learn. You are still new, so "a lot" of isk seems like more than it is. Promise. Besides, ships are flown to be lost. 
---
&gt; What's natural about it? We have lost one play style and are stuck with just the other.
---
I don't think we've lost any playstyle whatsoever. Elitist recruiting still exists, just that goons made the mass player playstyle viable and the speed at which these pilots grow up has been accelerated by injectors. Which is sad to me too, but then again - we are stuck with that. 
---
Yeah, ofcourse you can argue that goons can't be defeated and that may or may not be true. I would say that nullsec entities can still band together to defeat them, but how likely is it that Panfam will colaborate with test to pull that stunt off? Not very much. 
---
&gt;I would say the number's advantage favors the defender. You go to Delve...you aren't outnumbering anyone.
---
And I agree. Just that I think every advantage the defender has except local is a pure numbers advantage. 
---
&gt;This ignores the fact that SRP always covered people's losses particularly Goons.
---
But when did we have Supercapital SRP before? I would argue that was pretty much enabled by the current wealth we have in eve on this scale. The result is: More people fly titans, more titans get destroyed. More destruction ensues. Yes, the downside is that Inflation happens, but it's much more localized in Delve than it's in the rest of new eden. I.e. Delve is seeing active regression where every ISK gets more value. Outside of New Eden, Plex tanks the majority of the inflation (which I consider a bad thing) but it shows the demand for ISK sinks that, I feel, are lacking for some years. 
---
&gt;Need to find a balance where there aren't citadels everywhere, wealth is more scarce, and there is fun play and counter-play to the whole small gang thing.
---
​Yeah, that would be nice. I don't think fucking over PvE is the way to get there, really. I mean, we agree on a lot of problems, just the way we would like to tackle them are different. 
---
&gt;Well then the viability is what needs to be discussed.
---
​Absolutely. We would need an idea of what we want it to be in the end, but that's a can of worms too. How many people should you need to kill a citadel (as an example)?. I don't have answers to that. 
---
&gt;I could see "mixed asset safety" in 0.0. Basically half your shit blows up with the citadel to be looted, the other half gets put in safety. Because you know most of 0.0 will not sign up to basically have wormhole rules.
---
Well, that's not harsh enough for me really :D Asset safety is, to me, by far the biggest issue with 0.0. I mean, yes, you always had the option to retreat to an NPC station in the past, just not for supers/titans. I would probably be fine with supers and titans not being saved by asset safety, but then again - &gt; having the option to destroy a ton of assets in one go is a big deal to hurt major alliances, so I am really not done with excluding keepstars and such. 
---
&gt;Not so convinced it's done something good. Wealth is too easy to acquire making engagements less meaningful/impactful. Activity via the MER/ship deaths does not necessarily mean a causational effect.
---
Yeah, I can see where you are coming from really. I however think it has done something good and I don't think the issue of "loss is meaningless" is present. Otherwise, we would have constant wars. But when the richest alliance ingame openly says that "we don't go to war without filling up our war chest" then I don't think loss is meaningless. 
---
But that's my View - ofc, if everything you blow up as a small gang is "already replaced" and ultimately meaningless, I can understand your point of view. That's why I would still like to buff lowsec (and WH's) so you can grab some bigger toys to destroy bigger toys for more pain. 
---
Just sell compressed ore.
---
I can finally see exactly what is your problem with current state. And i get why you are angry at goons. But keep in mind, we are just playing the game and farming as effectively as possible, so why should we not do that if that is what we can do. 
---
Do not hate the player for playing in the boundaries set, hate the game that allows it. And i see you put the majority of the blame where it belongs (CCP), but you seem to also put a lot of it into goons as well. You know how people are, if they know something will anger you, they WILL start waving it to your face to make you even more angry, that is just how it goes. 
---
&gt;  But they become a Goon problem when they begin shitting on people raising these issues, or disseminate a culture that takes these broken balance mechanics as an entitlement, or overrepresent carebear interests in CSM etc.
---
Mazbe they do not shit on people just because they are raising those issues, but because there is a lot of shitting on goons from that kind of people as well. 
---
TL;DR: Obusing bad/imbalanced game mechanics may not be fair, but when was life ever fair to anybody? To me, never. :D
---
Calm down, edge lord. I need a microscope to see that stupid sig tag. 
---
TBH would rather fly with BB as a whole, I'm a member of provi block so sadly I haven't for a good long time. But considering making and alt to do so. Miss the whole crew
---
Two players are roughly at the same level, happily doing VNI stuff. One of them injects into titans, buys two, and gets a FAX alt up and running in 5 minutes, the other doesn't. If you think they're still equally powerful you're playing yourself.
---
Punishing people for the bad choices about who to hang out with, is how society worked since forever.
---
Also if you like to fight, but don't feel like using Astero yet - T1 exploration frigates are your best bet. Specifically Imicus and Heron. It's a bit tricky because you have to carry mobile depot with you and switch between traveling/scanning and hacking/fighting fits, but it worth it. Seemingly innocent and defenceless Imicus biting off face of uncareful stealth bomber is a marvelous thing to be seen.
---
While I myself prefer Imicus because it's the closest thing to Astero, actually Heron with proper fit could be more dangerous - a bit more DPS and better tanking.
---
Wtf you a talking?  its fucking game not business for doing real money and buying food in venesuela. BAN all scum botters permanent!!!
---
More skins, less content, nothing unusual
---
Maybe in your Soviet country
---
Half the interceptors lost their immunity. The combat ones are now no longer immune to bubbles. So you'd have needed a Crow.

LSH is russian, NSH is american (west coast USTZ)
---
Don't be toxic wtf xeraos 
---
Sir, can we get some more of this?
---
Or if you use alt (could be even alpha) for this. Extra points if ship is unrenamed or have cringy name.
---
A long ass-time.
---
Nothing of these things comes close to the level of income L4 provide. Especially not in terms of Risk vs. Reward.
---
Also, income potential does mean nothing compared to actual income. A lot of the stuff you described is very dependent on luck, compared to the steady trickle of income from L4s.
---
And L3s provide no where near as many LP and ISK.
---
Also, as casual player with limited time, most of what you describe is not viable.
---
All in all it will be one more reason to quit for good instead of playing occasionally.
---
 (´・ω・｀)
---
&gt;Also lots of mining Apocs... 
---
\*wipes nostalgic tear
---
Uh, no it isn't.
---
If my friend mugs an old lady, I don't go to prison for it. Because that's not how society works, at all.
---
If you mistakenly think a bunch of titans are an I win button then I can see why you're so adamant on being wrong. 
---
\&gt;battlecruisers
---
My way? How do you know how I play or what I do within Eve? I enjoy killing your dreads in my titans as just a little past time. I have very likely destroyed a lot more of peoples toys in Eve than you have. But this just goes to show that are very misinformed. 
---
Just keep doing what you doing, cause for one you are providing me with content and for that I am grateful.
---
Yep it's already bad enough, should be something inbetween alpha and omega state licenced with plex, would help the economy a lot imo.
---
Go to bed
---
because Tishu would probably make a comeback then.
---
South?
---
EVE is a P2W by definition. If you have enough money, you can buy injectors to a Titan if you want, then you can buy PLEX and sell them to buy the said Titan and the fit, this makes EVE a P2W by definition. Only thing is, it's probably one of the MMOs were P2Wing is the less profitable for the person doing it since going into a Titan first hand and not knowing what you are doing will only end up in Ivana or Snuffed drop to spank your sorry ass.
---
But yes, EVE is a P2W. 
---
Well ... I guess hiding in a WH system and trying to keep all the ways in closed ... is gone ...?
---
&gt;For a true glimpse at how dire this games current state is, you only need log into any of the starter NPC corps.  These used to be teeming with life.
---
Oh yes, Highsec needs some good look at. New player experience should be a lot more guided (Imho) too. 
---
That’s a lot of free koppla coins! 
---
I think this was my first Nyx kill. I always miss out on them for some reason. Anyway great fun all. Thanks FC.
---
An individual or group sets a goal that is measurable and there will be a range of benchmarks/KPI's etc to be achieved. I would hate to be in business where my enterprise doesn't have clear expectations on success that are clearly spelt out on what success looks like. It creates inconsistency and confusion on achievements and therefore leading to mediocre performance. 
---
If you wanted subjective measures you are aiming low as excuses are built into any result and these will be made before you even begin. But maybe that's what is hoping to be achieved here?
---
fuck yeah nice music 
---
It was my first Nyx (and supercarrier) kill too :) Hopefully there'll be many more to come. 
---
Bpos in the wh are risky, but some people do it in larger wh corps. 
---
Great expansion content for once. Good job ccp, you see it’s not that hard
---
That's why you chillax in one place while the fight comes to you
---
Was thinking of including the skinned  citadel, but I couldn't find any good pictures of it,  and getting one would have required me to \*gasp\* undock. 
---
shhh bby, CCP can't save you now. 
---
Because every system is going to have a 100+ connections now? That really what you think?
---
Doesn't effect your understanding of what I typed "wise guy"
---
Had to pull probes once, and was close to a second time when I fished, so slightly less than 2 hours
---
\*Affect
---
Well depending on where you live it might actually be legal.
---
It's kinda like washing your jeans before first wear to get the gunk off.
---
Age of ship + last time someone used the "clean" on it. 
---
&gt; My way? How do you know how I play or what I do within Eve? I
---
Because you are insisting that the only way to quantify Eve success is Eve null mega empire metrics.
---
&gt; Just keep doing what you doing, cause for one you are providing me with content and for that I am grateful.
---
I appreciate the good vibes.
---
I vow to build a very big wall isolating all of goons into their own pocket. Its like Texas, they could secede and live on their own.

No actually there is one in Domain
---
Fuck hunting bots but i'm all for an NPC Null island in the dronelands.
---
A hype just does it so much better tho. Set of x-types (much better 250m investment over faction hull, plus you net 100m back in insurance), low grade assclaps, and another 39% from exile and tb9 has youre repping your entire 10k buffer every cycle, it's stupid.
---
Have you tweeted about this using #CCPlease tag like CCP asked us?
---
I'll try and get it into your head one last time. Purchasing in-game power for real world money ≠ winning.
---
Link it big boi. 
---
ninjaedit: comes with a fancy discord tag right?
---
pandas make pretty soft punching bags
---
No?  It's just an example of what a "small" group capable of holding sov actually looks like.
---
It's not ten dudes in a high sec corp.
---
So eve isn't pay to win then, glad we've agreed on that fact.
---
I dont have a tweeter or know how to use tags
---
All the easier to get at the candy inside :D 
---
You realize horde was making *five times* the amount of idk from high sec that we are now.  Where did all that high sec isk go?
---
I read it, but jumped ahead and thought the data points aren't obvious so you'd need to be a GM mode and monitor the player in question live. The data signatures if were easy could be tuned based on databases queries so its not a case of "timestamps and data = bot". Like you're effectively searching for patterns of perfection because most botters are just lazy fucks and tend to do things the easy way (they aren't the creators of the bot engines). Data would i'd speculate be the easy path..the hard path is analysing the data to find the patterns to begin with, which your PD could potentially solve..but you'd have to give away certain signatures or tipping points to information that would likely result back in identifying the player or very close to it.  
---
The joke is once that happens it could be abused...plus you also don't want to tip your hat to the botter community on how you hunt/gather... two things you want from this community that bot... paranoid and complacency... you want them paranoid that there is a magic IT script that finds them...complacency is you want them to settle in first, establish their routines etc and see based on IP/Hardware ID / Router MAC Address etc..what other littler fuckerys they get up to ..as sure as shit they've probably got a bot running on a VM or something somewhere and funneling the ISK to a hand off...follow the trail all the way back to the RMT exit and/or the owner...hopefully when you pull on that thread you take out their primary accounts as well.
---
I dreaded once for lols after reddit post and used if for the first time to do this #CCPlease stuff. 
---
It's actually possible to copy+paste a message to several clients really fast if you set up ISBoxer properly, no broadcasting needed. He really wanted to make sure you saw the message.
---
Check the minutes, we’ve suggested this since CSM 11.
---
They're very easy to multibox. They have a lot more EHP than regular logi cruisers. Their rep range is quite a bit longer.
---
I can't, it doesn't exist yet
---
yes, of course
---
Or repackaged it.
---
Yep  i know.      
---
But :            
---
* you need to ask for CCP know that this is what players still need          
---
* ccp created #ccplease for better visibility of player requests           
---
* ccp is in balance cycle and this is long due balance to the area       
---
If you can and agree with this npc constellation - please post about it using this #ccplease tag.          
---
I will say this again - **CCP asked us to do it this way**        
---
PVE get into drone. Look up alpha vexor navy issue fits. 
---
Biggest thing with eve is factions mean nothing unless your doing Faction warfare and even then you can fly any ship. 
---
Also now alphas are not locked to a faction skill tree and can skill any factions ships. 
---
You could just use the clean option. 
---
hmmm this seems positive and carefully considered...
---
fuck that Reddit boys..get em...this will not stand.
---
The ingame channel "rookie help" is quite good, take advantage of it.
---
&gt;what faction would be easier to learn 
---
Doesnt matter, you can cross train anything
---
&gt;where i could find PVP events/areas if interested
---
EVERYWHERE, it finds you. You are safer in High-sec (systems with a green or blue number next to their name).
---
&gt;I'm looking for things such as PVE events/areas
---
theres lots of different pve things you can do, mining, hauling, industry, trading, Exploration, abyssal sites, combat sites.
---
REQUEST: Free Bookmarks at the nearest station
---
Yeah, I meant that repackaging the ship also restarts the "dirt" counter.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
RUN GET AWAY!!! IT WILL EAT YOU ALIVE!!!!
---
Nah just kidding. For the beginnign I would suggest go for all the introduction missions with military etc. and ask a lot in the newbie channel because there are a lot of helpfull veterans too.   
---
Next thing would be to start looking for a nice newbiefriendly corp to join because eve is no game you have much joy playing alone. Maybe try out a Highsec or lowsec corp for the beginning or if you are interested in Nullsec with really big alliances and a lot of other players at once try Horde, Brave or Goonwaffe.   
---
there isnt really that much of a thing like PVE events and the latest events by ccp got pretty unfriendly to new players and veterans alike. SO what you can do is find security agents and do missions in highsec which are like mini quests but get repetitive. 
---
My general copy-pasta for new players is below. If you want to try PvP some time, join the "SF Spectre Fleet" channel ingame, see when they have fleets going out - they're usually quite nice to newbies.
---
The [#newbie-help channel on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/KR3hV3) is also filled with people who want to help out. 
---
&gt; General way to approach EVE as a new player, but yours may differ completely: Ingame tutorial -&gt; career agents (all if they interest you, see the Eve Uni link below) -&gt; thealphasguide -&gt; SoE Arc -&gt; maybe some exploration for ISK (see pinned message on exploration guides) -&gt; ??? -&gt; try PvP (maybe with Spectre Fleet) -&gt; look into joining a corp/alliance (see pinned message about newbie corps) -&gt; ??? (see the picture on what to do below) -&gt; enjoy!

I don't even remember, but I'm sure it was both fair and justified.
---
&gt; By RMTing, or by harbouring people who bot and RMT, you’re contributing  to the real-life wallets of people who do not care about EVE, or our  community. 
---
Funny, I thought we were doing that by paying CCP.
---
You are doing reddit wrong.
---
Well, for every failed project they've fired a bunch of people.  Considering they're up to like what, 7 in a row now?
---
Dude, it's important to clean your Avatar.  You don't know where they thing has been.
---
&gt; I can finally see exactly what is your problem with current state. 
---
Thanks for keeping up with me.
---
&gt; Do not hate the player for playing in the boundaries set, hate the game that allows it.
---
This is by all means what I did so far. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/512a0i/just_a_small_kudos_to_goons/) is one of my earliest posts about Goons when they first moved in Delve. People portray me as a dude with a huge hate boner for Goons but all I want to do is keep whaling as an independent whaler and talk about Eve balance. Goons didn't like both, so I got a lot of hate on the subreddit. I began mute direct insults at some point and I have 70 people on my mutelist by now. 
---
Shitposting and hateposting is just carved into many null empire's culture. It's all fun and games when alliances do it to each other.  But when it is 1 person vs hundreds it can overwhelm the person. Large alliances have the power to memefy people whose ideas they don't like that way. Particularly if these people do not have supreme experience in how to deal with this community's toxicity. That happened to others as well, like Gevlon, Vic Jefferson or Chessur. It's happening to Mar5hy these days. All these people share the common theme of having balance opinions or ingame activities which happened to be against Goon interests.
---
From our perspective, it's this entity hundreds of which are trying to mentally brake us because that's one of their instruments to deal with ingame problems. Of course nobody orders from above, but it is culturally encouraged to shit on us. It is ugly. So I do have anti Goon sentiments. But they didn't come out of nowhere.
---
I am a generous god
---
When you start the game you get some training missions, they can be useful to learn the game, but not really that big a deal.
---
Then, I would *highly* recommend getting out of high sec. You can join Horde, a lowsec faction warfare group, whatever, but get out of high sec. I can recommend Horde from personal experience, but I'm sure there are other really good places—friendly to newbies—to learn the game.
---
I only wanted a discussion, and I got that to explore thinking on said issues. I dislike afk mining and rating, especially botting, so kill what you can, more power to you. 
---
As for success in Eve creating a mega coalition, you cannot blame goons for this as this is what the game leads players to create. They form tribes, erect walls to defend themselves, we have done this since the start of time. Test now also play with this model and show how successful it can become.
---
Blame other entities for not creating environments where this happens and draws people to their alliances or coalitions through competition. If they got their shit together you wouldn't see Delve as it is, but they AFK manage via rental models that perpetuate botting in low density environments where they can warp from anom to anom or mine where there is zero safety. 
---
But repackage removes also the rigs ;)
---
Thank you!
---
This is quite a comprehensive list and guide. I will have to look into it and see how it goes.
---
And the killmarks, but I wasn't proposing it as a way to clean the ship, just mentioning it does that.
---
&gt; Blame other entities for not creating environments where this happens and draws people to their alliances or coalitions through competition
---
This kind of pride what you learn from Goon communications. The game actually has 1 slot for a coalition doing what Goons are doing. To do it, you need to largest cohesive supercap umbrella. It's not like other people don't wanna do what Goons do. It's more like most people sharing Goons' playstyle and their way of playing Eve already moved into Delve.
---
Could be the Goon capital producers running a cartel - the more dead carriers, the more they need to build.  Tinfoil.
---
all those caps and only 2 fax.......
---
I can't add to much more except for: 
---
      Find a place/way to make money. Warp to Me is a high sec incursion grp that is very newbie friendly. But there are many just like them. 
---
      Don't worry about losing a ship. Learn from the fight. Ships are meant to be lost.
---
Highly risky and you have to come across someone who doesn't know zkillboard. But yes it could work. Just brick it with a point.
---
If you're gonna do this on a regular basis, you definitely want virtues. 
---
Not at all. There are a few similarities but if you fly a stratios like an astero then you will die quite fast.

Cause poor people staying poor cause all they know is poor people is a concept completely unheard of.

too damn long....

I have logi 5 on both my  logi pilots, but you know, sometimes to fit ships for others...

What do poor people have to do with this?

well, they added even more and much more obvious and potent ways to p2w.

---
thx, 4 years fighting for better New Eden.
---
Excuse me... what the FUCK?!
---
As someone who hasn't actually played in ... fuck... 6 years, give or take...  Yeah, I know what wormholes are and that scanning has changed half a dozen times... but I'm pre-Thera/Drifters... so what the FUCK is going on here in this Jspace?
---
Maybe, Maybe not. A lot of smart people in goons that work to create the environment and culture they have. Big industrialists have moved to Delve due to that opportunity being created no doubt. But, in some aspects Test is catching up but its not happening overnight. I have heard that a Branch alliance had an extraordinary tax rate on industry/refining and people left for goons because of safety, tax rate and community. Why would people stay?
---
Why don't they headhunt industrialists, some big players and set up environments where they can mine, rat and build? Where they can have their own super umbrella in place? Because it takes work (especially to begin with) and they prefer afk renters. Industrialists then bring the hunters, just like you :) and all playstyles win.
---
This is why goons destroy other entities opportunities, just like they did with Darkness and recently Horde, to drive players to delve and collect them dank tax dollars. A smart coalition would set up in Malpais where there are extensive systems under their own super umbrella, where it would be difficult for hostile caps top reach, yet they don't. Oh wait that's already renter space, isn't it ;(
---
Hard to catch them goonies, but not impossible with the right leadership.
---
players shouldn't be forced to combat cheaters just because CCP is too cheap and lazy to do their fucking job and prevent cheaters for continuing to ruin the economy.
---
Well it is a bomber bar after all.....

---
Love me my blaster praxis with geckos

are you saying he is cheating ? ... again ?
---
No, if you're solo you should have a scanning alpha alt logged off in hole at worst case. Or if you're in a corp then Corpies will help you get back in. 
---
Wormholes is risk = reward
---
Next minute you'll be asking for asset safety with a longer delay to get your stuff back....

What!? Why the hell is nobody locking my Falcon alt then lol
---
Ah yes. Chill on the gate in low sec near a hs gate.
---
Just be ready to slam the MJD if local spikes or dscan changes. Can't count how many times I've lol'd myself out of bad engagements with a good MJD 
---
The price tag is the most shocking on this tbh. Damn Vindis are cheap now...
---
praxis and megathron hulls are cheap af right now. barely cost anything after insurance
---
Logi 5 or you better inject / biomass 
---
Stage out of the WH, problem solved.   
---
I use my toons on a regular basis to put them in botting systems cloaked and play other games to keep them in tether and prevent them from botting and its really like I am doing the lords work.
---
Another carebear change wanted.
---
"But you don't know jackshit. You are just a new random."

You calling other people toxic is pretty rich. This is a partial quote you said to me recently when I didn't show any hostility towards you. I'll wait for my mute though because I dont want the essay response every time I respond to one of your comments.
---
Come back, the Scalding pass needs you :P
---
I don't fully understand what I see, but I understand the reason why I see it.
---
No one is forcing players - simply many players want to do it for 'double' fun. 
---
and it's only getting worse
---
&gt; This is by all means what I did so far. Here is one of my earliest posts about Goons when they first moved in Delve. 
---
Now, that looks like a genuine praise to me, seems a lot has changed in the past two years. 
---
&gt; Shitposting and hateposting is just carved into many null empire's culture. It's all fun and games when alliances do it to each other. But when it is 1 person vs hundreds it can overwhelm the person. Large alliances have the power to memefy people whose ideas they don't like that way, and shape neutral persons' thoughts about people they don't like. So even neutrals begin to dislike the person constantly getting shat on by hundreds of people
---
You are right, herd mentality is a bitch. And if you are the only one getting flank, i can see how frustrating and demotivating can it get. But from ehat i gathered, that is kinda standard goon tactic. Make the game as unenjoyable for their opponents as possible and (in game) i do not see anything bad about it. But any and all grievances in game should stay there. Personal attacks on reddit or anywhere else are not cool for any reason. 
---
&gt; From our perspective, it's this entity hundreds of which are trying to mentally brake us because that's one of their instruments to deal with ingame problems. Of course nobody orders from above, but it is culturally encouraged to shit on us. It is ugly. And it also successfully supresses balance opinions of people like us, which in the end yield a worse Eve. So I do have anti Goon sentiments. But they didn't come out of nowhere.
---
Thank you for letting me to better understand this problem, i am kinda new to the game (like 3 weeks), but i am totally hooked and absorb all information like a sponge. Been wondering for a while where this all hatred for goons come from. Now i see that it is, as with everything, at least partly their own fault for being a bunch of edgelords (at least some). And of course they will try to break you,  mentally, physically and every way possible, that is what enemies (goons especially) do. But their discontent with your opinions is only understandable, you are trying to change things in a way that would make them weaker. The manner in which they voice it could be better, but hey, this is reddit! :D
---
You've used zero datapoints. You just picked a number out of the air that felt right and went with that. If your figures are based on something I'm interested to hear them.
---
Who?
---
How do you do ? I mean, I'm just at the point where I am done because it seems that both CCP and players don't want to get rid of the problem. Just look at FRAT, Pan or Goons, full of bots, they don't give a flying fuck and continue to welcome them.

I personally think they need to get more and the revenue they pull down (estimates) i just can't think of a reason why even at this point they're not doubling the community/security at the very least.  It's really not as if the company is broke and Pearl needs to protect their investment so... 
---
as someone with a job which allows me to remote into my home machine and pretty terrible insomnia, thanks to your black and white idealism my accounts would be banned. i can consistently spin hubs for 20ish hours per day with it sometimes being less and sometimes more. 
---
Show me your dirty mach and I'll show you mine
---
Nice boxed up low tier management school answer.
---
I think it will be primarily ISK and asset removal. ISK gained via taxes and / or direct payments, such as rent or protection contracts, or in one form or another, asset removal in form of removing any stored ores, minerals, possible even entire ships or modules if they have been built from botted mining. And of course PLEX. Plex I imagine is very high on list of those assets, and CCP can track all Plex transactions, trades and transfers in the game so actually the easiest to remove. They can actually track everything, its all logged, just a matter of sifting through the data.
---
Also I wouldn't be surprised if they removed structures that are used primarily by the bots, the botting ships themselves. In this way, lets say they remove 20 supers or 600 Gilas or 2000 VNIs or 50 Rorquals from botters, those ships will technically be removed from the alliance that their owners are in.
---
There does need to be some sort of transparency so that people know who to not recruit etc. But holy shit its about damn time, they should have started this shit years ago, so it all would have been sorted out by now.
---
yeah my 2 hub spinning accounts run from anywhere from 10 hours to 20 hours per day every day. i just have a job that allows me to remote into my home machine and insomnia. please waste security team time looking at my account. 
---
Who draws the line between bot hunting and harassement of a player with similar behaviour as a bot?
---
No, go home

I would pay big money
---
There is a Tuskers guy who uses a torpedo typhoon fleet issue with heavy web and MJD. Looks fun and effective. 
---
197 what a poor not using rss
---
They don't. 
---
They just ist want free kills to pad their killboard
---
I very much agree with this, make heavily botted regions / system more accessible, even temporarily, put some freagin NPC built gates or something instead of regular ones for a while. It'd be better then nothing.
---
original post was nuked because of witch hunting but here are the screenies [https://imgur.com/a/lqzwxA4](https://imgur.com/a/lqzwxA4)

Well think about it in a different way - how many bad CCP decisions players managed to stop or "adjust" before they happened?        
---
How many things where fixed after we posted about this for a year?
---
What? It's hilarious!
---
I'm fine with it as long as subcaps can't target caps. Quid pro quo.
---
I think CCP started to "chase the isk" to alliance wallets - look at the KWG...
---
Still trying to spin I see.

trash
---
good vid and great piloting. I still have a lot to learn and lost a beam/point retri to an ac/scram wolf just yesterday. dude kept crashing a gate with me on one site and a fleetmate on the other site. at some point he aggressed my fleetmate but he didnt really called that so I jumped in to help him very late. fleetmate was pretty much dead at that point. sorry for that mate. even with double nanos in the lows the wolf caught and scramed me. I tried to gleam him down but with over 92% em resists I didnt deal that much damage. so he got us both. gg Asilthar. that was a good fight.
---
Too much effort for no fun. I'd have to omega for the cloak, and if am not gonna kill anything then its not worth it to me. I wanna blow shit up, I don't even care what it is, other players, bots, NPCs, just blow shit up. And am way too far away to go by myself through a gigantic chain of holes. I wont even make it anywhere near to where I need to stage from.
---
Easy access on the otehr hand, is a different story.
---
Seconded
---
Yep, and this is bad why?       
---
If they find a bot ... and kill 10 botting nyxes thanks to this they are getting kills and bot is being affected also exposed.            
---
The whole things about bots is that they act as they where programmed - while players are creative.         
---
For example if bot is warping to a safe pos spot ... you can drop a drag bubble, sometimes even kill the tower and replace with your own ... and he will still warp to the same location - and die doing it.          
---
Guess I found our exit hole!  
---
"Where does it go?"  
---
Anywhere we want. 
---
Temporary gates are bad as they come and go.     
---
Permanent place where people can stage is something totally different as it allows multiple groups to act independently.     
---
But please tweet about it using #ccplease tag     
---
lmao
---
Do the tutorial missions, and do teh Career Agents missions first.
---
Also check out new player and PvE sections of the official forums, there is a ton of info there including ships, fits, everything. Over here its too disorganized and a bit more advanced. 
---
Snuff smells free kills
---
Sigh...
---
I wish you were in charge of EVE's direction...
---
Well player can simply talk to "bot hunters" and prove that he is not a bot.         
---
Also this NPC constellation will make whole drone lands much better place to live and fight for.        
---
More fights, skirmishes, more fun.       
---
MORE SAVAGE! PLEASE!
---
Because they are, generally, using the false pretext of botting to get traction for their poorly thought out ideas that have nothing to do with actually combating botting.
---
Thats not even a Theran Membe... he havent even ever been one???

I wonder how the mapping tools looked like after you get throught them all

Corp takeovers can be prevented by not giving out shares, you can't boot the CEO of a corp without shares ergo its entirely possible to make yourself immune to being removed, so why shouldn't the same apply to channels? :P
---
As you warp through space, lots and lots of space particles, through static electricity, stick to the hull of the ship. That’s why they look dirty.
---
Also, when you are sitting in a space dock, all those particles floating around, yeah, they’re going to stick on the hull as well.
---
These are the Wormholes that spawn near the Jove Observation towers. On warp you land roughly 30-50km from the hole and have to burn to it and also hope a Drifter isn't sitting their waiting to kill you.
---
Once inside these wormhole will have a numerous amount of wormoles spawn to different locations around new eden.
---
J110145 - Also know as Barbican Hive is one of the Drifter Wormhole Systems

Botting aside, yes, certain regions really need some npc space!

yea when they warped in more titans i was like "sudda warped faxes instead"

But then it's either you're the only one able to see your hello kitty panther skin or the servers have to distribute your skin to all players on grid and you'll get theirs. Would lead to unknown levels of tidi.

DPS isn't great, but you can have some real interesting fights. The general attitude is to know your going to die to a blob, theres nothing wrong with being blobbed, but when you run into a small gang, you have have alot of fun. 
---
Often when you run into gangs, you end up killing their tackle (thank you mr flycatcher) then burn to a gate and escape, sometimes you get awesome fights where battlecrusiers decide to switch to void ammo to try and break you... often lose my ship then, but take a few with me.
---
to much effort..... really?
---
I think this here is the problem, people getting to lazy to get content, some else has to present it to them on a golden platter
---
RMT is legal in Entropia Universe and even a core mechanic. You can earn monthly in that game and I think, despite having the "botman bad!"-policy, anyone who actually got some money in this game actually made it in an honest way. It's also the game where the most expensive transaction of a virtual commodity within a game has been made, with a night club switching owners for roughly 30000$ (beats that perfect roll D3 item which went away for 16000$).
---
Or you start selling genitals in Second Life.
---
Eve just isn't the game for RMT and I don't want to see it there. If there was an ISK bazaar, you can be sure people would rather join whatever powerblock ensures them the most stable way of livelihood, aka Goons.
---
u/StainGuy sounds like your dream might be coming true
---
I don't wanna know...
---
It's not certain agents, just RNG. You'll get some periods where it seems that the agent only sends you after pirates, then suddenly he's got a hard on for killing Gallente. Unfortunately, they all pull from a pool with the same ratio of anti-pirate/anti-empire options, and it's down to pure luck.
---
It may not be your cup of tea, but Distribution missions are fairly nifty for risk-free in terms of standings. Kinda monotonous, and the isk/LP is nothing compared to Security missions, but if you find a system with 2-4 agents for the same faction, you can blitz them for easy corp rep, and you'll get so many done quickly that you get quicker storyline missions for faction rep. Even if you set a jump clone in such a hub for Gallente or Minmatar, get it a wee T1 industrial, and then every time your Gallente or Minmatar rep dips under -1.7, jump there are spend a couple hours to get it back to 0. That'd give you the freedom to keep doing those anti-empire Security missions for Caldari without locking yourself out of the enemy faction corps.
---
Remember as well that unless you're doing a lot of trading in those enemy faction systems, the standing doesn't matter all that much: as long as you're above -5, you can fly through unmolested, and it takes -2 to lock you down to L1 agents for all that faction's agents, so anything above -2 (after skills like Diplomacy) and you're fine.

They're going to attract more hunters if they drops titans like that with such little fax support.
---
Use C1 with higsec entrance. 
---
Nope. 10 peoples from kekscale entered in skillu (who has 4 accounts with faxes and supers). And rest of members were conned by ex-ceo Lorein, who created new corp "Zugzwang." for SkillU. And yes, for now the remaining peoples from alliance cant join skillu, because Lorein has veto on them (they cant join even in different corps. So thats it. 
---
bot hunting is fucking cancerous without a blue scout. the kills are hardly 'free'
---
Oh man, i thought this was a new update and got excited :(
---
You missed rental empires are rampant and circumvented the passive moon income issue in fa t making it 10x worse has now every fucking moon is now rented separately to the system therefore actually making shit loads more passive income.
---
Don't worry new skins will be announced shortly
---
this is exactly what I thought when I heard the video had gone.
---
Wonder how much isk it took?
---
Ooh nifty I might have to redownload. Oh has OKEO blown up yet? It always seemed such prime 0.0 real estate but nobody was ever there when I played
---
the same argument can be made for channels, people don't need control of a channel to talk in it. If you want to keep your channel control access...
---
same dude i got beaned thinking ccp actually did something
---
This... well, this is pretty interesting to be honest, it will shake up things a little bit at least when everyone rushes to occupy or fortify the new strategic positions.
---
I hope the exact changes remain secret until patch day, everyone login into a "new" map could be hilarious.
---
shh let us dream ;)

Just looked at Dotlan regarding that system it's owned by KWG. So pretty much botters. 
---
Started playing in 2007 and this was obvious then.
---
It amazes me how people either don't realise this or put blinkers on because fanboi or shill.
---
Didnt mind too much when I could farm 300M isk and pay for a month with it but now (and for the last few years) its just pure P2W mechanics.
---
Find something in the distance you want to do, find a fitting for it, and start training for everything on said fit.  
---
Certain common skills, lined out well by Brave Newbies, will tell you what you want to train on top of that, regardless of what you ultimately decide to do.  
---
For example: If you have anything less than level 4 in the two skills that affect market fees, you are only hurting yourself, especially when you start to buy bigger stuff
---
Sigh
---
lol, if only you invested some time into this
---
&lt;3
---
This would certainly be something interesting... suddenly all your known gates, routes, chokepoints change. At least it would shake things up a little.
---
P.S. I totally bit the bait at first, have to admit it dammit.
---
I still wish they had Yulai the way it was but CCP being CCP does retarded CCP things.
---
shh, let them call those  bugs "features"
---
hey, it's free content
---
every single goon shitpost about marshy ever?
---
I don't deny that dude.... Are you this dense? Seriously? I'm not saying this kills BB? I'm simply saying, for the new player, to login and see "You have been banned from the BB channel". That's shitty. That's a bad look for EVE. That's a bad look for community.
---
That's literally all I'm trying to say here, yet I've got people, including you, in comments arguing that newbros won't be affected by this drama bullshit. That it won't turn them off from the game. 
---
So I'll simply continue to ask the same question I did earlier, regardless of the spin or downvotes. **Why is what I'm saying (about turning off new players and community in general) downvoted in a thread about BB/CowKiller/Marshy, but when talked about in general in /r/Eve it's upvoted quite heavily?**
---
If you're honest about why that is, you'll understand why /r/Eve is the way it is. It really isn't anything more than that. Thanks for the discussion, even if it wasn't always in good faith.
---
 forget this alliance  
---
  Lorеin was hoping for Puer. hoping for his faithful dog

BB has gone through similar shit a number of times, nothing new. Tamponman, Olmeca etc...

I'd rather pay the NPC tax than line the pockets of whatever shady fuck is running the flavor of the month Perimeter hub personally. Always went to Jita before citadels anyway, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

Interesting... It will fuck me somehow, I know it! --"
---
All in all, I will be looking forward for this new "world order" and see how the plot will advance in this.

This was one of my favorite patches they ever did. People for months were trying to figure which way up and which was down. Was a really great job done back when ccp gave way more of a dam to shack things up.

Can confirm this is true, I scanned the same drifter hole as you have in the picture with High grade virtues and all the other max scanning implants, took me about 50ish minutes. It also depends on how much practise you have with scanning.
---
No clue or "personal interest" ?

Jebaited

Drifters

Strange nobody mentionned it already : Higgs anchor rig

You can't tank gank basically, so escape it when it comes for you.

For all the people who don't remember what the map looked like back then:

I was part of Stain Alliance at the time and while it's hard to see on the map there was exactly 1 (one) system with a station (DSS-EZ) that controlled access to **all** of Stain and Paragon Soul. No jump drives, no jump bridges, not even warp-to-zero.
---
So you want me to spend all my time in a system just so that botters stay docked?
---
Sounds fun...not.
---
Maybe I just want to play the game without botters ruining the economy and having unfair advantages.
---
yikes
---
Every single region in the same should have one or two npc stations, change my mind.
---
I live in the Dronelands. We report any botting there. Same as anywhere else. Also we do get roams and fights all the time. Ask laserhawks!
---
Got me hook, line, and sinker.
---
Well played. 
---
Okay... I fell for it. 
---
Imagine being this brain dead
---
So do you.
---
And I thought you were trolling us.
---
Found the botter.
---
The whole idea of hunting a bot is they mindlessly undock in their Praxis or alpha ship of choice 30-60 seconds after local is clear, max tick script.  And the hunter gets to do it again.  And harassing players is Eve you filthy bot.
---
Players should at the very least have a database up for these scumbots.  Then again, botters like you would fuck that up with false positives so never mind.
---
Wrong sub

Do you want to get dreadbombed? Because that's how you get dreadbombed...
---
I got baited into thinking CCP were going to make significant changes to the game. Well played StainGuy.
---
Lol, my sides.
---
^^ although worst comes to worst you stick it all in a covops and log off in a safe
---
I think he should stop watching porn while ratting. You can't fap and rat at the same time...
---
From my short time living in null since I came back to the game after a 6 year vacation, I can safely say that at least 60% of the ships people kill out here and claim are bots, aren't bots at all. 
---
That is not to say botting isn't real, or that it isn't a problem, just that a lot of 'bot kills' are really just 'terrible capital pilot' kills. 
---
Rental empires have been rampant for over half a decade
---
So for now you are admit, that goons has bots?   
---
And sorry, im not very good in sorts of pubbie gonnies. 
---
Or just stop using bots? 
---
based on this killboard it looks like he is a terrible krab, if you have any evidence of someone botting i suggest report them to CCP.
---
Can a small corp put up an Athanor in lowsec, or will it get dropped on too often? 
---
Clean your ship you Heathen! 
---
Unless something has changed that I missed, the drifter holes have a static C2 connection, up to a few wandering w-space holes, and the rest all lead to k-space.
---
Now we need systems with 400+ wormholes that connect to high class space
---
tbh they’re so shit that’s why there are probably so many
---
Congratulations, you killed a terrible capital pilot with a terrible fit. I am going to go out on a limb here and say this is not, in any way, a bot. 
---
Let this be a lesson to everyone who posts "hrrr... killed a bot!" or "grrr goons bot!" 
---
This is eve, some people have, do currently, and always will:
---
1. Fit their ships poorly;
---
2. Fly what they cannot afford to fly;
---
3. Fly their ships poorly; AND
---
4. Fail to pay attention to wtf they are doing when they really should;
---
&gt;based on this killboard it looks like he is a terrible krab,
---
Nah, he just download eve-bot from github. And yes, he was already reported. And maby banned. 
---
1. Just dont use bots 
---
If only there were some way to get them to stain
---
You do realize we rent an entire region now yeah? After you guys, you know, failed to do anything about it.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).

Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
It is called SQL. It exists to extract data. For example, you could check the number of ticks per day per character in an corp/alliance. If you see this basically being maxed out over some time, you have likely found a bot.
---
Drone regions are bordered by Venal in the north and the great Wildlands in the south.  It's also probably the densest cluster if stars in nullsec with region on top of region.  Meaning one base of operations covers considerably more space than anywhere else.  It's part of the reason no-one besides renters wants to live there.  
---
Perhaps we should be looking at the economic reports to see which regions are doing the most damage to the economy.  By bitiching that drone regions is the source of  all evil we're saying "the house is burning down, but if CCP gave us a couple of kid sized squirt guns and some petrol we can put the fire out".
---
Did you put it all into Pathfinder/tripwire...
---
gonnies
---
ha
---
&gt;  I am going to go out on a limb
---
The guy is banned, now we need a pic
---
I call them Tw@tter and Farcebook.
---
Fuck you and the Rikshaw you rode in on.
---
Bots need to be removed completely. 
---
Secretly, this is what happens when you let the wormhole generator ihub upgrade go too long.
---
High-grade virtues? I thought mid-grades were the best available for those.
---
As far as i know noone has claimed that there are no bots in goonswarm. The mantra has always been that it is on CCP to police botting, not on the players. 
---
it's a grey area
---
Wow! That's almost a BILLION isk!!!!!!!
---
(that you'll have to spend to open the loot boxes)
---
Why do you want do this? Is it the loot you are after?
---
Maybe stage out of a Yurt depot or a DST? You could also anchor cans for supplies if you want. It's not easy, but if you're living out of your ship, it's one of the more pleasant ways to do it
---
Temporary gates. We should give them a mass limit too.
---
I just looked that up. That's sounds pretty useful 
---
Goonwaffes altcorp is goonwaffe, hth
---
Good for keeping cyno inhibs alive while whale hunting out from a NS wormhole
---
Basically it lets you mine while aligned at max speed with a speed around 30 m/s, so you can stay near your rock for a long time, sometimes you'll have to create a bookmark beforehand though, but really useful overall.
---
no one denies goons have bots retard
---
every group has bots
---
gonnies 'r' good enough
---
ship kills
---
Lots off alliances have bots they just haven't been picked up on yet. It's not like alliances are monitoring every single member 24 / 7 it make sure there not bots.
---
...but it won't improve CCPs economy &lt;thinking&gt;
---
One piece of advice you can apply to any situation from a conversation about tacos with a corpmate you've known for ten years to a zero day old character inviting you to an event.
---
They're lying to you.
---
Thank you very much!

I will have to look more thoroughly when i get home, but thank you!

A quick follow-up question, i imagine it would be better if i were a subscriber, right?
---
You can always use Venal as a staging point and drop some citadel around as a mid point, HK use to do it all the time against DRF. But yes such a vast area uncover by any NPC space or lowsec is hard to get some hard hit on it, Omist is kinda the same, not vas but far from and it's also know as a famous botting space
---
80-100km off the hole and if the Drifters come out, there's a decent chance you'll loose your ship, they can one shot most small ships.  They aren't there often, but when they do, its spooky as fuck.  Safety in numbers can help.  Definitely don't target or aggress them.
---
Totally worth it, been in a bomber fleet that's been whaling out of these monsters and the FC has always been able to find us something to kill.
---
... and that's a good thing.
---
It’s time to remember, that unnecessary commas are bad.
---
I will always love people who see flag behind botter before seeing the bot issue. Making the war against bot political is stupid
---
Soon to be 64-bit shit.
---
In the long run yes, to discover the game for a few weeks no. But subscribing means shorter training time and when you start skill limitation can frustrating
---
Mittani said, that goons shouldnt report bots, becasue goonswarm hasn't bots. So for now we see, that your CEO-mittani is lying with his right-arm inominet, who banned peoples from gsf, because they reporting bots. 
---
And still no lowsec gate to stain..
---
And maybe give them there own self reps ? An cap boosters.? ((Would have to give us the ability to  neut it )) Basically ends up being a ship with no movement. E.g a dread in permanent seige
---
You don't have to go omega right away. No harm in waiting a few days, try all kinds of different things, seeing whether it's your thing, then buying omega at that time.
---
an alliance with 40k character has bots.
---
Tell me it ain't so!
---
Tell me it ain't mathematically the most likely!
---
#metoo :-D
---
\&gt; Funds all of his alts with plex from market.
---
\&gt; Dreddit shit poster can't into brain cells
---
You may want to find that audioclip and listen to it again.
---
preach.
---
But mittani said: "but we know that all of this is in fact NC/PL/HK propoganda who are still salty for getting evicted by 100 gonnie pilots. thanks for your attention and dont believe in FAKE news". 
---
Ah no he said (( if I remember right )) 
---
They wanted to deal with them there self's to insure they are bots. (( Something that should be up to CCP to decide ))
---
Still a dumb thing to say but if you're gonna point out it try and make sure it's the right dumb thing.
---
Like I said elsewhere, find the audioclip, give it another listen.
---
After years of soloing in FW space, my recommendation for you is to step it up. a true 1v1 is actually quite boring, because the outcome is pretty much decided beforehand. 
---
A few ideas:
---
- use brawling setups that are actually able to get out, for when you inevitably get blobbed. sometimes its more about having a good fight and surviving rather than that extra killmail
---
- try to take 1v2,3, ....s with something kitey. people will complain about how you arent feeding their blob with something "manly", but fuckem
---
- start multiboxing subcaps, e.g. tackle and dps or even bait, tackle and dps and take harder fights. 
---
- finally, find some friends and fly in small gangs. 
---
in effect all of these methods introduce a higher degree of uncertainty in regards to the outcome for both sides, which means (a) people are more willing to fight you and (b) the surprising, against-all-odds-wins will be even more rewarding.
---
looking for and actually finding good fights consistantly, is a real lost art
---
This is why alpha clones were a mistake.
---
the issue is that it's more effort to combat botters than kill players
---
So wait, you’re finding less fights, presumably in FW lowsec, and you assume it must be because of zkill?
---
Ok I know they weren't the cream of the crop but they were more coherent than anything most Russian groups have done.
---
zkill is an amazing tool that allows us to get some important intel if you know how to read through it, and means nothing at all about a pilot's skills or combat capabilities besides what he likes flying.
---
And to be honest, just shooting whatever comes your way if you have even the slightest chance of killing it is way more fun than being a risk averse fuck that only chooses fights you think you can win.
---
I think you are completely overestimating the impact zkill has on the engagements people take or not, and you are asuming that everyone interprets zkill the same way you do (which of course isn't the case imo). Most people are fully aware that a pilot with 99% on any of the values is probably a moron that dedicated a shit load of time to pad his killboard and probably doesn't stand a chance against a relatively competent pilot on a 1v1 engagement.
---
On the other hand, the "riskaverseness" of the playerbase has been a problem before zkill and will be on the future even if such a tool disapears. Some people are more concerned about "winning" or getting "achievements" than about having fun playing a videogame, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
---
Yeah LSH probably is the best of the Russians
---
HEY CCP, NOW THAT YOU ADDED YOUR OWN FURY ROAD, CAN WE HAVE THE OLD ONE BACK?
---
I mean I wouldn't really support that. I mainly support making them bigger pos.
---
&gt; Alliance leaders have no access to server logs, 
---
No, but they have access to wallet transactions which can easily find the person who is botting based on getting ticks throughout the entire day all week. 
---
Can just copy and paste into excel and insert a pivot table to track how many ticks people are getting. 
---
TL;DR let's dumb down the game so that it'll only take a week to have lvl V across the board on frigates, another for cruisers and a few weeks to a month to battleships.
---
Other games (like overwatch, csgo or pubg) already do this - all characters have the same stats regardless of how many years you've played and only player skill matters. Why don't you go and play them instead?
---
the best part of this event was the 3k DPS bugged rat, at least it was funny watching killboard fill up even after people were told to stop warping
---
That guy sounds like Trump. "Fake news!"
---
It’s not about what is the best item used, it’s if you can move that item at a profit. If the market is over saturated, then you’ll fight with others trying to move stock possibly for a loss to you.
---
It’s also about the region you are in and what people want. 
---
I’ll plug my app since you can use it to figure out a lot on what items to produce.
---

or people leaving the game also no longer visiting the sub?
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/UgliestProductiveSheepDoggo](https://clips.twitch.tv/UgliestProductiveSheepDoggo)
---
Yeah used to do kamikaze fleets. Most people lost the ships getting into the hole rather than in fights.
---
Couldn't remember the range of the top of my head. 
---
They are good fun miss wormhole space defo going back at some point. 
---
mah man!
---
never been this apparent with the low player count and massively increased bot activity with the introduction of injectors and alpha clone state
---
so why do people go out of their way to kill botters? they must enjoy it no? 
---
Christ... 
---
I came to watch a good fight. Ended up watching Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kruger murder all of Crystal Lake and Elm Street combined.  
---
The funny thing is, you can already do this today with decent isk farm. I am 3 weeks old and just upgrading to bs. :)
---
he means that you couldn't instantly inject 10 rorqs pilots to get that sweet scalability. you only had what the bazar had to offer and those rorq pilots would be much more expensive then simply buying SP

Now I'm off to write Boobs upside down on a calculator :)
---
Well if you're doing that you can nerf it's ehp and give it plate and extender modules. So it's a choice.
---
Buffer for fleet support.
---
Or rep for solo tanking 
---
*basically when you don't really have a numbers for fighting and reping*
---
Solo would be good for small groups expecting smaller attacks but leave it vunrable to large fleets that can alpha through its reps.
---
Buffer is good against bigger attacks but needs fax / logi support to keep it alive.
---
Haveing a Carrier just able to target Rat Subcaps will be confusing to new players.

---
same like most: sunk cost fallacy. is you've spend 12+ years of your life in this game coupled with the financial and emotional engagement this game requires you are simply stuck in cognitive dissonance.
---
Blizzard reported 37 million active players in 2018... how's that high-and-mighty attitude going to help when EVE hits 10k simultaneous? 
---
lol you are cute thinking that injectors are made to help newbies catch up. the playergroup that benefits mostly from injectors are veterans. 
---
congrats, you are now having a much harder time to "catch up"
---
What's a maby ban? 
---
The veteran baiters ive known deal with this issue by occasionally cycling in new bait toons without a killboard.
---
I really like cap item building. While the volume is rather low the number of people producing them is also lower allowing a part timer like me, to be competitive. 
---
Use [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/) to help narrow down what is profitable. It is very helpful on what is profitable. It uses jita prices so keep that in mind. Other trade hubs can have better margins.  
---
That actually sounds like a great idea.
---
Newbies can get into the simple stuff real quick but the more advanced stuff will take time.
---
'why do 0.01% of players do [activity]'
---
this is eve, it isn't all about min maxing. the reason MORE don't do it is because it's hardly worth it unless you're hunting supercarrier bots
---
We all wish for something like this.      
---
Eve would feel like a new game.      
---
/u/ccp_fozzie on serious note - have you ever considered doing something like this again?       
---
&gt;how's that high-and-mighty attitude going to help when EVE hits 10k simultaneous?
---
more VNI bots
---
Can we compare nethack to eve while we are at it
---
The killmail for those interested - [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75252668/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75252668/) 
---
But **you will get almost a billion** if you sell all the stuff from the loot boxes. 
---
No...theyre shite
---
/u/kendarr ... kick him
---
It depends if your moon is valuable to someone else or not.
---
I'm not sure why, but every time I see somebody say "change my mind" it makes absolutely uninterested in doing just that.
---
Which is weird, because I'm normally the first person to arrogantly correct everybody on everything they say.
---
But if they do that they then can't convince you to buy injectors to do it instead. /s
---
In reality you would be far better off trying to demonstrate you need to/can learn to use what you already have effectively, always chasing the "next" ship is the road to isk farming burnout or 50 account mining fleets.
---
Spend more timing playing the game and less chasing the next "achievement" because you will never run out of those if you are starting out now unless you are a serious credit card warrior.
---
Nah let's just have new players quit the game instead of making a QoL change. -/r/eve
---
in the famous words on koahi : This is a bad post.
---
This makes the assumption that new players can only take out ships that have all t2 fittings and can't use meta 4 items.
---
Oracle's or vexors are nice for this, although if you're expecting a counter fleet, I would go with the vexor.
---
Max out? No.
---
But there a lot of baseline skills that need to be removed.
---
Pretty much anything related to fitting, for example.
---
How many people are playing Blizzard's open sandbox space MMO?
---
I agree
---
Apparently it was looted by a Volta guy
---
I'm predicting a cerb fleet ping for the final timer of whatever structure ends up being used to build it.
---
well played
---
That was Fun Yolo'ing my 9 Dreads into that :)
---
Had a DST on grid myself. Saw the BPC but didn't Yeet it in time.
---
GF
---
If it we're truly that simple surely ccp would already be doing it.
---
If what's being referred to is the 28 rorqs recalling in 10 seconds, if you're quick enough you can probably do that with clicking into each client and hotkeying.
---
Wrong, that's the argument StainGuy has been mentioning lately, not the main argument for that.
---
The best argument in favour of Lowsec gates conecting to NPC-Null and/or the creation of NPC consetelations in Nullsec regions that don't have it is that it would make those regions far more accesible and in consecuence bordering Sov-Null areas more dangerous for people trying to live there.
---
I don't see how that could be a bad thing, but feel free to disagree.
---
I'd be interested in buying the BPC. Whoever owns it. Toss me a reddit PM
---
My point here.      
---
Those gates allow groups to move fleets into the area and contest space around it. 
---
Sodium uses tripwire, not pathfinder
---
Always nice to shit on the little guys who live in the drone regions and are legitimate players (yes we exist).
---
Botting is an issue but putting yet another bit of NPC space isn't gonna fix anything as you already have easy access from Venal and Great Wildlands.  All it does is give the "gud fightz" pvpers somewhere to run away and  hide in when the slightest hint of resistance is shown.  We already have issues with a huge logiscal bottleneck and half arsed content form CCP, we dont need to add yet another poor content driving black hole.
---
Rather than crap on those that have to live in those regions because of the handful of bots (which exist all over the game) we should be coming up with ways to fix the game.  If we push to rebalance it towards a more stable model rather than the static sov and super sized alliances we have today.
---
imagine pve giving killmails in eve
---
jesus
---
If you want to combat botting I think CCP needs to up the punishments...burn em out and salt the fields.
---
 It need to be so bad that alliances and corps will be more active in ferreting out bots and getting rid of them themselves.
---
And they should be scanned down and while are at it: they should go to random places... Oh and a lifespan of lets say 16-48 hrs? 
---
No trade for goonies. Sorry. 
---
It really is though. 
---
No one rats for 20h a day all week. 
---
No spawns for goonies also :D      
---
"Somehow" those don't spawn in southern New Eden ... but plenty spawns in the northern areas.           
---
[much better link, also best prof why those should spawn only in NPC areas](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001027/201902201300/)      
---
(exclude the sotiyo)    
---
Better link them to a dead subreddit!
---
The people that rat 20hrs a day, 7 days a week are the ones that already get banned when reported.  It's the guys that do it 7hrs a day, 6 days a week that don't.  And those are the ones I have no tools at my disposal other than gut and instinct to weed out.
---
What happened with KWG ?
---
Not really.
---
I made no mention of tech 2 fitting, or in fact any mention of modules.
---
*Innominate
---
I work in security and we do a lot of automation for the billions of events we get, good luck and god speed. It takes a lot of fine tuning but you can improve dramatically your effectiveness month-over-month and year-over-year
---
Apparently they had issues to pay TEST for Feytha 
---
No I am 
---
So for now are you admitting that goons have bots?
---
And sorry, I'm not very good in sorts of pubbie goonies
---
Fixed it for you
---
I think CCP does a better job than people give them credit, but I appreciate the sentiment.  I shouldn't be expected to take time out of my day in a game I pay to play to do the same work as salaried employees. 
---
Is Rokh any good? I love the look of that ship, I'm just not very well versed with battleships 
---
It's fine using BB as a weapon if its at a target mar5hy agrees with. 
---
Good on him. Better than being rmt'd by fraternity. 
---
Maybe the goons could go invade the north again if they want the Sotiyos. Would be interesting to see how the new cyno jammers work large fleet warfare 
---
Baited on a fucking stain guy post. Good job op. Now I'm sad. 
---
Yeah, although I haven't seen myself on any highlight videos...
---
Yet.
---
I live in high class space. How do I know? Because I have a silver tipped cane and a monacle. Oh yes I do!
---
This is a holy system
---
yes.   
---
If you are older player, have family ... kids - wasting 30minutes to find connection and setup stuff is bit to much if you have just 15min to do something in EVE. 
---
Have read most of the replies on here and agree that there does need to be some direction or a clear goal for some people.
---
Something which it might be worth looking at is being a training corp.
---
Get new guys in, teach them to make money.
---
teach them to PvP (fly safely)
---
Offer money or ship incentives.
---
Run a tax system which somehow pushes isk back to the players contributing.
---
Offer to buy, transport and sell their ore if you can reprocess it better or have better trade alts.
---
Do this at little to no profit to yourself and you 'might' get a loyal following.
---
ya it can now be rmt'd by volta
---
Yea we should at more like learning skills
---
I'd like to add "Subcap Pirate ships BPCs drop in LS only please" to that.
---
Both things would have a real impact on prices for those ships (which for me at least is something desirable and that afaik has been considered by CCP as a way to make pirate ships less opressive in the current meta) and give new life to this long forgotten areas of New Eden.
---
***You make the assumption that new players need maximum fitting skills to take out a ship and have fun.
---
OP you should have memed the jtag to be rage... 
---
Yeah, but what if it spawned in Stain but there's no low sec ga.... wait...

---
The risk averseness comes from the fact your loss is permanent.
---
Even when you have 10 bil, you'll be hesitant to throw away a 100 mil ship. 
---
I agree. I hate everyone and everything that isn't pvp 100 % of the time and they shouldn't enjoy it at all.
---
Extract and inject a new toon with a clean killboard if you're having this problem. 
---
jebaited.
---
GF, dudes that was a Really fun fight 
---
Just go out there and fill your losses with a few pages of your bait ships, but fitted for their usual purpose.
---
If your old enough you remember the early days of the internet when normal households started to go online. Dont you remember all the old folks saying "o i dont do computers" (you sound exactly  the same), now they got cell phones and crying about not knowing how to ignore bullshit on facebook like everyone else has for the last decade.
---
Flair checks out...
---
I don't make that assumption. In my experience dealing with new players, they make that assumption.
---
Is your experience different?
---
Did your corpmate remember how to use Pathfinder/Tripwire and not copy-paste over your sigs?
---
3rd BCS should be dropped for an ENAM on the RHML nano phoon imo
---
Or delete Corp bookmarks to make bookmarks for his mtus for his alt to salvage.....
---
I did think initially think that they should be removed, but then I had the idea that leaving them in and having then as a learning experience might be better. Only requiring a lower lever and a faster train for the smaller cheaper ships.
---
Also, if you see a group called Theran Alliance recruiting, don’t join them. They’re kind of like the main newbro corps (Horde/Brave), but they don’t have any sort of standing fleet to protect you while you make isk, which also means you can’t join that fleet when you want to pvp. 
---
They seem to recruit heavily from those new player channels to get people before they know what a good Corp is like, and then make as much isk off you from taxes until you quit/move Corp 
---
Might be another circunstance that adds up to risk averseness, no argue about that; but the permanent loss as a deterrent to engage in fights should be compensated by the "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" rule, in which case if you follow this last EVE commandment the permanent loss shouldn't be that much of a problem.
---
In fact, for me at least, the concept of permanent loss works as an incentive to get out there and shoot stuff and not the other way around.
---
Whatever verbiage you want to you. You are stating that this is a problem that needs fixing. It's not. Actively encouraging people to think they need the best skill sets before they ever go have fun will create a very tiring cycle of needing to get everything before playing and then people will spend more time watching their SP cycle than playing.
---
Killing bots more easly than humans, just another type of carebears
---
Spending 25 days to get to some of the fitting skills to V is really dreadful as a new players. It's like getting a full month of not getting new possibilities in the game. Yes sure, implants are a thing, but still pointless and terrible for new comers to see that.
---
oh look, another weekly anti dronelands post.  
---
You know what those bot hunters could do? hunt for botters in their own SAFE blue space, oh wait, perhaps they are forbidden by their alliance leadership to do so ?  
---
Sorry i just dont do social media. The most I have is a facebook messenger to keep in touch with my parents in the motherland. Anything else and i am willfully ignorant on the subject.
---
Back in my day, btw, 4chan had 10 boards and a meme was an actual inside joke, not a stupid image macro with flavor of the month text superimposed on it. Get the fuck off my lawn.

In those games, only player skill matters as there are no differences between two characters of the same class. In EVE, player skill matters on top of character skills when two players are playing the same class of ship. Someone might have all the character skills and no experience in pvp. Some might have all character skills and years of constant pvp experience. Some might have almost no character skills, but a lot of pvp experience. It is this mix that makes the game unpredictable and interesting. This adds some depth to the game.

It's now open bidding at 350b. You can in game mail any FRT diplo and they will direct you to the right person. Good luck ;)
---
Hi, I have read that and always had a problem with the vague as fuck statements that CCP like to do. 
---
&gt;This includes, but isn’t limited to:
---
In other words we will define like top 3 then you have to take the risk yourself. If we decide that we dont like what you are doing, we will ban you but we never said you would not be banned, but we also said we might ban you... 
---
CCP typical lazy as fuck at policy writing.
---
Highsec industry is tough, competition is fierce and margins are razor thin.
---
Meanwhile, nullsec line-members face extortionate prices on common doctrine ships in their staging system. This is where you can help. 
---
If you focus on just a few or even one doctrine ship, such as a Sabre or a bomber, and make the whole ship+ modules from the base materials you can sell it on alliance contracts for jita sell price and still make money.
---
There are industry corps in most nullsec alliances that have a BPO library with BPCs for almost every item you can build.
---
Please tell me shark week is still going 
---
Thank you
---
Most Bots have some kind of operator which looks at them at least every now and then... I talked to one of these lastly quite a lot with my camper. After he blued my cloaky eyes it got kinda easy to figure out the timer by moving an neutral in system and just watching when they get active again with eyes. But basically the trick is to find out the time when the ratters run alone, so that you can kill all of them before the guy who controls them wakes up.
---
Tbh as looking from side - i think no one considered BB as any threat. 
---
I have the same issue as well
---
Alliance tag checks out.
---
Same volta guy that was kicked for rmting his titan, or a different one?
---
I know right, scary :)
---
Currently, mastering battleships would take you about a year. It would indeed level the playing field if you could just max out battleships in a month, but the mix of player skill and character skills is what makes EVE unpredictable and fun. 
---
Sure, you can use injectors nowadays to instantly gain those skills, but it still requires a lot of work (either ingame or out of game) to be able to afford that, which might just teach you a thing or two before you hop into those ships.
---
Can confirm.
---
Not a great guidepost. I tried a mid-level moon and got dropped during the anchoring, I think it was just bad timing and bored pilots, but I'm not sure.
---
There are plenty of more valuable moons unused. I hoping to get some feel for what I should expect.
---
nice strawman
---
It's actually much better than just PVE
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=1027&amp;b=8488110&amp;e=140&amp;t=qufj
---
Maybe I wasn't clear, this is just for the skills that effect the hull, no skill that directly effects modules.
---
I really don't see an issue with letting new players get into frigates quicker... 
---
Why is this an issue?
---
Fucking you got me man. Fuck that hurt. I was so excited.
---
Fucking got me so good too
---
Is it a strawman when it fits?
---
i have a newborn. Once hes around 1 years old, ill go burn some small alliances sov.
---
in the beginning i did it to train my dscan speed, this is something bots are really useful for. Now i do it because of simple hate. When you roam around, bots will just waste the time of the gang since they are basically never create any response, and also are really hard to catch. So in most times its only frustrating.
---
duuun dun.. duuun dun..  
---
dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
---
People already get into frigates on day 1. How much faster do you want it to be? 
---
Also, many skills that affect the hull also affect the modules fitted to it. For example, the Gallente Cruiser skill changes your Hybrid Turret damage output and tracking if you are flying a Thorax.
---
Yes, the loss of others give you more joy this way, cause your opponent lost something.
---
But that's why most people look to tilt the engagement in their own favour before they start.
---
Thought this guy got shitcanned?
---
It hurts deep deep inside when you read stuff like this. 
---
No
---
Yes let's leave the game unbalanced because people like you are tired of hearing about it.
---
I honestly think people are blaming bots for the increase in Plex prices and not being able to Plex their accounts. When it's really due to players who are on the fence about leaving just plexing all their accounts with roqual isk. 
---

Lots of purple kills in there.. Would you say that you’re safer in these kinds of holes if you can make it past the drifters by the entrance?

Or maybe if you’re quick enough you can just ninja loot all the wrecks lol
---
i dont seem to have problem even with zkill. Just undock and shoot stuffs. Come to Ouelletta if you are having issue getting fight
---
You commented without reading didn't you?
---
It's a strawman when you rail against something that the person above you didn't say.

Not wanting PVE killmails =/= hating  everyone and everything that isn't pvp 100 % of the time and they shouldn't enjoy it at all.

---
Oh, it wasn't a fair assumption that his statement could lead down that path? Clue me in, where was the line? Just the killmails? How dare people get pve killmails?
---
got a fit?
---
Aria Yatolilas Abyssal videos are also great
---
Found the Pinata salesman ;)
---
It is a problem that needs fixing. 
---
Let me simplifying it for you since you're struggling with the verbiage, lower sp to comfortably fly frigates and cruisers to a decent level.
---
You deserve to be downvoted by both communities.
---
Thing is, if you dont get a good fight due to kiters you just align out and MJD out
---
You want an active trade hub and if you are catering to null sec buyers, it's a good idea to work with items that don't take much space. 
---
Problem with this idea is anything you can build in highsec, others can build in null for cheaper. And then they don't have to ship out their goods if they've got buyers. 
---
Building items that are a pain in the ass to build but very useful in null is a good way to start. However, if you can find a decent lowsec/nullsec group that wants a supplier for items, that's an even better way to do things. Good luck though, you're better off just joining a group and then building things.

god bless you guys for killing these bastards, will make them think twice about ganging up on roaming miners like me 
---
Well, not sure about the logistics of it, but I would sure love not having to go through Tribute to get to Venal from Lonetrek.
---
Wormholes non-withstanding.
---
I understand very well what skills you're talking about. I just disagree with it. For example, if you have two newbies in identically fitted ships and one has Evasive Maneuvering trained to IV while the other only has it at II, the investment in that specific skill might net him a win in that situation because he might be able to outplay his opponent by exploiting this difference in agility. 
---
If there's just one Evasive Maneuvering that either maxes out agility for your ship class or does absolutely nothing for it, based on the level, it kinda forces you to train all of them to whatever level is required for whatever you're planning to fly before undocking. It'll just lead to people feeling like it's not worth it to undock my Dominix because I won't receive bonuses from Hull Upgrades as I don't have it at V.

Going from "PVE shouldn't give killmails" to " I hate everyone and everything that isn't pvp 100 % of the time and they shouldn't enjoy it at all" is a hell of a jump. 
---
[For your education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)
---
Yeah sorry I meant mid-grades. [https://imgur.com/a/dImr7S7](https://imgur.com/a/dImr7S7) thats the pod I use, generally with an astero if im scanning chains and a stratios if I'm exploring.
---
Isn't that kind of loss happening every day of every year for as long as the ships in question have existed?
---
More like half a billion unless you get really lucky
---
Astero is pretty good because you can fit to get away or fit to fight and still run sites in either.  Stiletto is the god tier exploration ship as long as you have perfect scanning/hacking/archeology skills.
---
If you really want to help the new kids, leave piloting skills alone and reduce the SP requirements for fitting skills.  That would open up T2 fits quickly, instead of forcing people toward faction mods.  A new player might spend more time in frigates and destroyers, but they'd be cheap and capable, not hurt much when they were lost, and the player would be free to work on her piloting skills without being overcommitted to an expensive fit.
---
Yea, I get what your saying. It's not needed.
---
Yeah, I just usually scan down our immediate vicinity, we don't get these every day.

I was also faffing off a bit had I just hard core gone for it I probably could have had it in 1.5 hours

To say that he disagreed with PVE giving killmails?

Are you dense or something?
---
It sounded to me an awful like he dislikes any recognition or enjoyment of pve. Are you willingly  dense?
---
Haha you'll be back soon Deadwood :D
---
In about a month IIRC
---
I don't really agree that this would do jack shit vs botters. BUT, it would definitely make it so that the drone regions would become much more contested, which IMO would be good.
---
If you actually wanted to remove bots, you'd simply make all or most npc's in nullsec have warp disruptors. 
---
Maybe not today (in most countries), but you do not have to go so far into the past, maybe a few centuries and you will find his everywhere. And as u/grr-eve used "since forever" and not for instance "until today", he is right and you are wrong. :P

Ye shooting wolves any EM damage ship is rough Arty wolves can also easily kill omen navies and zealots. Biggest threat from the Omen Navy would be warriors if he has them which are defangable :)

---
Great.  So where is that isk going and why do you need to beg for donations for infrastructure?
---
Sorry, but Malpais and Oasa have to be two of the worst regions in terms of botting. I'm sure if you looked at absolute numbers, it might be worse where goons/test/frat live but the fact that relative to actual player activity, roughly 80-90% of Malpais/Oasa being filled with botters just doesn't help your case.
---
Was fun. Dictor btw
---
I should be there I think - my travel plans just changed drastically for 2019 so I basically think I'm going to need to clone myself to get everything done haha :D 
---
I keep seeing good things about your PvP videos. If I stop spending free time on fits and playing, I need to check them out :)
---
I'm not a wormholer BTW. So, my vote means little. However, this really sounds like it would absolutely wreck the notion of hole control and the very essence of what wormhole evictions are.

One does not just walk into the dronelands and kill bots.  Even with an NPC area, you aren't going to catch them.  Bots are a problem because they are really really good at getting away.  You need to setup complex traps or awox.  It is not a problem that you can just throw more hunting ships at.  
---
However, if you want to kill afk renters that dont' counter drop then yea, NPC staging space in the dronelands is a great idea.  
---
Awesome. Just careful you moght bump into an anti-therescontentifyouundock crowd here. 
---
Glad you are having fun!!!
---
&gt; If there is a hit, it will be better reflected in a different metric, daily average logged in players. I am sad there is no good acronym for this. ;-)
---
There is an acronym for this that's pretty much standard in the games industry - DAU - Daily Active Users - we also use MAU (monthly) to chart game health.
---
We actually realized a while back that PCU is not the best metric to look at game health. Right now we tend to look at both DAU and MAU, with focus on USERS being the keyword rather than accounts - we've gotten pretty good in recent years at tracking the actual number of humans that play EVE rather than accounts, and it helps a hell of a lot.
---
Some super interesting metrics have come out of the shift to this approach when we're looking at activity :) 
---
if you only have 15 min, you aren't going hunting for bots or anything else. 
---
I think you are confusing a significant number and calling them a bot when they are actually just someone who actually enjoys ratting and mining.  I live in Malpais, the group of corps I work with all live in Malpais.  We actively deal with bots in BOT but we, like, CCP are constantly bombarded with these people so there will always be some that get in.
---
Can't and won't speak for Oasa as that is skillurself space

Personally, I hate AFK gameplay and feel that it's the bane of EVE Online in some instances.
---
Would love to see pretty much every ISK making activity be to the point where you have to actively be engaged with the game in order to earn bank.
---
This is a lot of loredumping but the game really hasn't had anything happen. It's akin to the "winter is coming" from GoT, except you know the writers behind it are just making shit up as they go instead of carefully planning 5+ years in advance.
---
Drifters got introduced **four years** ago and all of their activities added up seem like it could make a neat story if it were condensed into a few months. Meanwhile there's still no end to it, they're just kind of there ingame with no reason to interact and it's looking like there'll just be a regular "ohnoes drifter threat!!1!" "lore" for the next 5 years.
---
&gt;yet
---
after 4 years, this is really not the right word... this is a "feature" that's been released 4 years ago and has been continuously worked on, supposedly, yet there's absolutely nothing in the game to show for it bar some new technology CCP was going to implement entirely unrelated to drifters, but then they decided to slip the drifters in as the new macguffin that "allowed" it. So not only did the drifter storyline not really go anywhere in all this time, it's indirectly made other things turn more bland because of it.
---
MMO gameplay 101: if you want something you have to put in the time and effort to get it.
---
If you don't have enough spare time to to accomplish whatever you are trying to do, look for some other activity or some other game aimed at shorter session lengths.
---
stainguy post. must be bad. \*checks\* nope, this one is terrible...
---
not that it really stopped their miners from getting farmed
---
ok
---
While this would definitely hurt bots it would more affect legit players who like to rat. So not really a good idea at all.
---
wait... the CSM was suggesting this? just arbitrarily adding npc space where they feel like? wonder why CCP didnt go with it xD 
---
its almost as dumb as, oh say, adding lowsec gates arbitrarily. hah! guess that makes sense under this particular post, still a terrible way of approaching issues. 
---
Stop crying about bots and how predictable they are. Go out and gank said predictable bots. 
---
Before you start investing assets into lowsec you should go there and find out what it's like. There may be a group that claims ownership of the system that you need to negotiate with.
---
In lowsec people will generally try to kill any ship that's undocked purely for the sake of killing it.
---
because I agreed to share the spoils with them, as they functioned as protection :) so I guess their linemembers are probably just misunderstanding 
---
About the same number that will be playing EVE in 5 years if things keep up the way they're going.

How much does one make in bounties on these? for half a bil in drops, it seems high in effort.

I too have been trying to get into EvE for a long time. I've now made 3 characters in 3 factions trying to get anywhere past the tutorial, but I always feel so lost after that. It gets much harder with kids and a job though...
---
That's a pretty good idea actually. Any way to quickly just check the highest ISK characters instead of having to go through everyone?
---
Nobody gives a fuck if some random newbro logs in and has to figure out where his chat channel went. If he quits over that? Good riddance to dead weight.

As to your bolded text, there's a difference between say, psychologically torturing someone in the Bonus Room, vs having to X up for fleet in a differently named chat channel then before.

I know. I just wanna see another big fight in eve. And parts of the north being shit on.
---
Sounds good man, give me a shout when you see me.
---
Can't miss me, just look for the fat angry english guy.
---
I think it is more in the line that if PvP gave kill mails you would have way too many.  And the metrics would be screwy
---
&gt;bots are in all of the major alliances
---
What is English?
---
but how can i make sure Non-Germans are active during my timeframe? 
---
I think a raid level event having a killmail doesn't make much difference.
---
All theyve done so far is feed shit tier groups like r1ot lul
---
I am confused and possibly just out of the loop with EVE. Why does that say it's an NPC killmail? Is zkill trolling Fraternity?
---
Margins are very slim for ammo, nullsec industrialsts only really produce ammo as a public service, theres no money in it.
---
Use a program like Isk Per Hour to calculate profit on everything, then pick the blueprints you want to make.

I was serious. I have no experience with these and wondered what the actual benefit was.

---
Can punch em but unfortunately beating sense into pandas proves impossible. 
---
You such a bad troll it hurts ....
---
Because people don't care about bots, they just want an easier way to get free kills.
---
Just a strongly worded opinion, apparently.
---
Dude let's cut the shit. Everyone knows when they're on grid with a bot, it's super fucking obvious.
---
Not if it gets you to show up with your hate boner. I call it winning.
---
Also "No I'm not worried about the group that does 95% of the miner ganking. I'm worried about mysterious other 5%."
---
Fucking right, bud! Great you’re having a blast, lowsec is king. 
---
Nah, the big structure.
---
Yeah vigilante justice is frowned upon. If you see a bot in your alliance you should report it to CCP, then to alliance leadership. Not just randomly destroy it, as a line member, confusing your entire alliance.  
---
What is your point even?
---
The main income from these are the faction capital bpcs that they can drop. If you look at the loot drop you can see the "Guristas Komodo Blueprint Armored Cache" which contains 1 run of the Komodo blueprint which is a faction Leviathan

I think I am getting confused now about what we are talking about. Lol.

I think something like the sotiyo kills is a fine for kill mails, but normal rats and such shouldn't be.
---
Thank you for the response! I'll keep that in mind.
---
Literally this, went back to see the date and could have cried.
---
I agree.
---
I keep BPO's in HS and bring copies in if I need to make anything, special case is reaction blueprints which you can only use BPO's.  
---
For me I have a HS static which I use to get something favourable (i.e 6 jumps or less) to Jita and sell my wares there. Depending on what you produce and the demand, selling to buy orders in smaller market hubs like amarr/dodixie/hek/rens might net you more money.  
---
I use DSTS's for the hauling and if I feel masochistic I jump everything to Jita myself. If I can't be bothered/no time pressure to sell anything I dump it in a station in the HS exit and contract it out to a hauler corp like red frog or Push-X.  
---
PI wise you can certainly make a lot of money if you get a good P4 chain with your planet set-up and certainly helps to make your own for any production. Though to be honest I find it a tedious click fest and stopped doing it.

Well then you have a great day! Fly safe!

A lot of insane, useless, and outright poor ideas here on how to combat the bot problem. 
---
There’s actually a pretty simple solution.
---
Remove local
---
It's really obvious when you're on grid with a bot.
---
This guy xkcd's
---
Injectors make it much easier to inject a bunch of bots and have them simultaneously running 24/7 where before you had a significant training time for something like super botting.  
---
Botting is getting worse and it's incredibly obvious why.
---
Wall of text. Grr. Not hate boner.
---
Then they should be doing this. Hell, if it's this easy, CCP actually could get away with requiring them to do this on like a monthly basis with some penalties for noncompliance and maybe some rewards for consistent compliance.  
---
This is so frustrating to me, there are like 500 ways to solve the bot problem that are more efficient than manually having to go through hours of evidence for each character.
---
Alright.  There is a general degree of ignorance about the drone regions because 90% of nullsec players see it as the arse end of the galaxy.  No one wants to own it or live there, so the people that do live there end to be the more indy/PVE entities which lack the leet PvP force that most other entities in nullsec have.
---
I'm not going to, and haven't, denied the existence of bots in dronelands.  Yes it probably has a higher percentage than other areas.  Simply painting the vast majority of people as botters because in your eye's we're the lowest of the low because we wont join the great init/imperium/test etc and we prefer the indy/pve side of nullsec is bullshit.
---
All that people want from this NPC null idea is somewhere totally safe they can dock up their blops until they can drop a juicy target, its got fuck all to do with dealing with botters. 
---
The blueprint just sold for 300B.
---
Awesome

Isn't blops kinda dead tho?

I know you're lying because noone enjoys ratting

PI is one of those activities that lies behind the Omega wall. So you will lose access to your planets if you lapse.
---
idgaf what he flies, if he wants to fly doctrine throwaway more power to him
---
But shit talking other people’s zkill padding is rich considering he’s a 160M+ SP pilot with an enormous wallet (I’ve seen his API, personally!) that exclusively flys nothing but the cheapest ships
---
Easier doesn't mean new.
---
If you have a problem with a literal bot in B0T space, please report it to CCP and mail Imfakenews in game (he prefers it if you include a limerick about how awesome Finfleet is as well). We take botting quite seriously and will seek to confirm your identification and kick the offenders.
---
I say this because the alliance mail was undoubtedly already skunked, but there were five entire corps kicked from Brothers of Tangra last month because of this kind of player activism. Trying to paint B0T with the bot-sympathizer brush really just identifies your own ignorance more than any intrinsic value of B0T leadership itself.
---
Lemme just press a fuckin FAT F in chat for pohds tho.  You wont be missed.

As for why take a fight you might lose, well...I’m pretty sure that’s where the fun comes in. 
---
&gt; Nobody gives a fuck if some random newbro logs in and has to figure out where his chat channel went. If he quits over that? Good riddance to dead weight.
---
No, YOU may not... but CCP does. The community of Eve who **aren't** bittervets posting on /r/Eve also does. Spin all you want, but what I'm saying rings true in terms of killing/maintaining community in the game. **You** may not care if the game exists five years from now, but CCP and new players joining the game at this very moment certainly do.
---
the correct way to do that is have the contract not expire for 4 weeks - but only have 7 days to complete.  the contract shouldn't be accepted before the guy is moving it so that you can cancel if its taking too long.  
---
THAT. WAS. BEAUTIFUL.
---
Speak for yourself. Its 100x better then mindless mining while giving some dank isk as well.
---
Botting is financing major corps indirectly; there is a real conflict of interest, thus CSM don't want botting to stop. 
---
If botting was such an "issue" it would have been resolved by now. 
---
More then enough bomber fights and other blops to be had, you just need to know where to go.
---
Never lost it yet so here's to hoping :) 
---
run as fast and as far away from this game as you can. 
---
I have sunk over 7 years into this game, not saying I regret it because I met a lot of radical dudes and learned a lot of real world lessons.  This game is a commitment for a good chunk of your life (assuming it doesn't tank) just take that into consideration.

Go to Neocom -&gt; Agency -&gt; Choose "Agents" from the dropdown, pick a max distance, any faction, any corp, security missions, and "highest available".  
---
This will give you a list of security agents of the highest standing you can currently access in the jump range you specified.
---
I would highly recommend it. Good informative videos.

If you're the getaway driver you still go to prison, even if you didn't attend at the bank robbery tho

Thanks pal! Appreciate it!

CANT STOP THE ROKH
---
&gt;This morning I took out a beam, scramkite tormentor and roamed around near amamake. First fight I had a tristan warp in on me in a plex. I STILL FORGOT MY DAMN DRONES... but at least I started the fight out at 8km. He was slow to do anything, my heated multifreq had him at half armor before he launched drones or anything. In the end he hardly touched me, and only got neuts on me right at the end when I approached to make sure I stayed in scram range.
---
It doesn't look like he had any neuts fitted you needed to worry about.
---
Absolutely, and it can be fantastic 'red pill' experience to realize that almost everything you see can be blown up. Assuming you're in highsec, all you need to do is find a structure and declare war on the corp that owns it. Wardecs cost only 50m ISK against small corps. Your corp also needs to have an Upwell structure anchored somewhere. 24 hours after the dec, you will then be able to shoot their structures and their players, and vice-versa. In highsec it's a bit rare for the owner to confront you face to face. He'll usually turtle up inside his structure and pew you with its defenses while trash talking you in local, so bring some logi or self-repair and a bucket for the tears.
---
Nice work, personally I'd try and stick with 1 ship type to start with.
---
&gt; Guristas Komodo Blueprint Armored Cache
---
I glanced over it when I first looked because I'd not seen a BP in a container before. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
There's usually some random with a scram though, so need to be careful
---
Wew the youth today, one line is a wall of text. Have you ever read a book ?
---
you're delusional, end ur posts 
---
people have had some pretty fucking epic meltdowns over stupid shit in this game but a 24 hour long meltdown that's still going strong over a chat channel is, uh
---
well that's a new one
---
Nobody enjoys mining either. He said people enjoy both. They're both mindless borefests.
---
The idea that a toon that has been ratting 150h+/week for months could be a human and requires manual checking is just absurd. Such low level bots could (and should) have been automatically detected and autobanned starting 15 years ago.
---
Stainguy is Getting finally his Gate
---
Looked much better as well
---
same dipshit
---
ZOMG!!! BRILLIANT!!!!
---
&gt;though this stupid law school station that has the only clone bay in Egmar is a lame kickout station with a huge variance in undock angle and no repairshop. Oh well.
---
Probably a bit late now but you can set your home station to one without a clone bay if you right click on the station name in the top left when you're docked. Doesn't need to have a clone bay at all.
---
Yes they are to you, mining is mind numbingly boring to me.  Doesn't mean everyone feels the same.
---
Lol, all the grandpas downvoting you
---
Is the Orca worth while Skilling into a Rorq for null ore fleet mining?
---
lmao. My corp will be here when the game dies. Get fucked. Sorry your corp sucks.
---
I’m not super sure but I believe the way it works is in game, killing a NPC sotiyo, which is where some faction capital BPCs come from, mainly the blood raider and gurista as those are the only 2 pirate factions that generate sotiyos (I think could be wrong), generates an in game killmail, so it then populated on zkill. 
---
TLDR: in game KM = zkill report
---
I did not realise it was an NPC structure. That's new to me.
---
13 years of eve and, I just learned this.
---
It wasn't always true, just a year or three old. A blessing and a purse
---
Is the Orca "worth it" for a null mining fleet? It's inferior to a Rorqual in every way. There's no harm in using one, and it is directly on the training path from Rorqual so you don't have to stop and train something else. On the other hand, a basic Procurer can get the same yield for 1/20th of the investment with the boosts provided by the other Rorquals. I hope these facts are useful in forming a value judgement.
---
I'll just pour a cup for tea and see who shows up 😉 
---
This is you refusing to make the smallest change in your routine and equating it to the game ending

Shouldn't the Drifter systems only have about 20 wormholes? Why are there so many more connections now?
---
...variety?
---
In all seriousness, I think EVE benefits from having space with a wide variety of characteristics. I'm not sure why removing one dimension of that variety is to anyone's benefit.
---
Because it's still 120km off?
---
it is part of my life bucket list to be able to produce fecal  deliveries of the magnitude you seem to be able to do in a recreational manner

is it my diet? my water intake? the toilet I am training on? or do I need to fly a super through Delve to get my anus stretched to a large enough proportion to facilitate the load?
---
please share the path to success of your kung-poo arts :)
---
&gt; Always nice to shit on the little guys who live in the drone regions and are legitimate players (yes we exist).
---
Entire regions are held for nothing but the bot income. If botting wasn't a thing, the people you rent from would be getting a fraction of the absentee landlord income they do now. They're not worth holding onto without that. Then you could take a chunk of that space in your own right.
---
Bots don't just ruin the game's economy, they also ruin the politics.
---
Cable has been banned for rmt and actively tries to sell isk
---
Then.. what’s the problem catching them?
---
"Proof?" - r/eve 
---
&gt; Found the botter.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; The whole idea of hunting a bot is they mindlessly undock in their Praxis or alpha ship of choice 30-60 seconds after local is clear, max tick script. And the hunter gets to do it again. And harassing players is Eve you filthy bot.
---
&gt;Players should at the very least have a database up for these scumbots. Then again, botters like you would fuck that up with false positives so never mind.

Outstanding detective work. You just proved my point!

Hey doesn't have a point. He's a troll. Downvote and move on.

I'm aware of that, I've been a low sec rat for a long time. But I'm just coming back and the upwelling are new to me. I was just curious if I could move structures in or of the general rule in lowsec is to burn it all.
---
Here are some more, touched up a bit, hope you enjoy :)

That Time Calculator however, was a useful answer, though I've found a better tool: https://www.timeanddate.com/date/timeadd.html
---
And having a tool to assist doesn't necessarily mean "bad at numbers". :P
---
Not disputing that the starter corps are probably a lot scarcer in players than before, but wouldn't some of it come from the fact that joining a corp as a new player isn't an instant death sentence from wardecs? Think of how many people had neutral starter corp alts just to avoid the endless wardecs
---
Did ccp remove the suspect timer after leaving a tier 4/5 abyssal sites?
---
Mining gives me a chance to actually BE mindless for awhile when the rest of my life requires 110% of my brain power and energy. So when I AM able to get out and mine in my Filthy Casual way...I find it highly enjoyable.
---
Until a certain point, yes
---
What faction you choose is irrelevant. Join a player corp asap. Eve is a social game more than a spaceship game.
---
I hunt the dronelands regularly. I am not confusing anything. The bot problem in the dronelands is at the extreme end of the spectrum.
---
Ok, so essentially it dropped a titan faction blueprint, those are worth :quite: abit
---
and zkill tends to not show proper values for bpo/bpcs (and abyssal mods too)
---
You need to work on your Goonliness. We pride ourselves on being bad and we use reddit to shit up pubbie threads.
---
Technically speaking since CCP owns your account and is in possession of such account therein on their servers, selling the items, characters, or any other part of the account is theft by deception. You dont own the account yet you are deceiving the person buying items from you and falsely claiming you do own the account. Think about that for a bit. 
---
I was asked for a 1v1 on amarr undock on an alpha, so I convo the dude and told him I was up for it if we used BS's, but he didnt want to do it...
---
I don't see that as a particular problem either tbqh. Nullsec is so obscenely safe atm it's absurd. You literally have groups like horde telling people to make it out of the danger of highsec to come to the relative safety of their nullsec pockets. Most nullsec ratters don't even bother to defend themselves or their fellow ratters. Forcing people to have active, communal standing fleets would be a huge boon for activity across EVE, rather than everyone just individually solo's some red x's and makes dank ticks on their own. It *would definitely* hurt people who only want to rat on their own and never engage in the social aspect of the game: for people who organize it wouldn't pose much of an issue.
---
From what I've seen the general attitude in EVE is 'bashing structures is cancer'. Especially cheap fueled ones. They might even leave an Athanor alone because it can be a good honeypot.
---
Eve is like Nike, just do it!
---
And dont forget to undock!
---
Depends what you select to share
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
---
curious, but what is that point and do you have examples?  I've never seen someone get banned for using legit (e.g. not exploits) game mechanics?
---
he's a former corp mate, unfortunately.
---
So just run fleet boosted barges while I wait on train?
---
Nice. Keep exploring wh space is awesome.
---
You can choose what to share, but that choice will also show.
---
Join GOONS, BRAVE, or TEST if you're interested in PVE exclusively. Join Pandemic Horde if your interested in PvP and PVE.
---
i don't know.
---
I kinda miss the old osprey model, but i really do like the new one as well.
---
If it was me and it was a mining fleet, yes. I'd ask a Rorqual to run boosts and just mine with cheap Procurers. The Rorq might even be kind enough to let me compress in his fleet hangar.
---
There's still a month of winter left
---
Gj frat :-)
---
Failheap &amp; kugu died because the bittervets that posted there had quit the game and were super salty about it. New players coming into the community either joined in the misery and accelerated into early bittervets, or left for other places.
---
Both times the guys there were positive eve was dying, when it was really just their toxic community.
---
have an upvote, and i hate u &lt;3
---
Thanks for the replies. Do you know where I can change the settings as well? 
---
I was expecting (and hoping) to be a honeypot. But I got hit right away and thought I'd come and ask around before round 2
---
The new structures were releasen this winter, right? Or was it before?
---
Anyway, I think you are asking the wrong question here... "why the fuck there isn't anything past the current month (that ends next week) on the roadmap?" would be the right thing to ask imo.
---
WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME hahahaha
---
Is this Lowsec gate to Stain ?
---
Just the one. There are no account level scopes available outside the launcher.
---
Nobody really cares that bomber's bar loves to come to delve, its funny as fuck when we manage to bait them.
---
What people care about is the hypocrisy of them pretending to be a neutral organization. 
---
Until you guys get rid of the toxicity and terrible PvP strategy that is Mar5hy you will continue to have issues and BB will never have a real chance of living up to its legacy of old. 
---
The first thing you do when an organization is being impacted by internal drama and poor moral is to eradicate the toxic ones.
---
Indeed. I like the fact that WH's can potentially close behind  you turning exploration into a real adventure, for better or worse!
---
spod brain is contagious 
---
Lore things going on.
---
You can share multiple characters of course, but the ESI has no knowledge of account on purpose. So you need to log in and select what information you give for each character. 
---
Be in V0LTA for a bit and then get on TS.
---
Or ask any previous member of V0LTA if cable tried to sell them isk - the near universal answer is yes.
---
I propose we call it Fred
---
There is, but we are long overdue for an update on the medium or long-term roadmap. The managing team has been in place over half a year now, and we don't even know what they have planned for the game. Does CCP consider Seagull's roadmap finished? What happened to new space to colonize? Is that still the plan, or are we going in a new direction?
---
Heck, [updates.eveonline.com](https://updates.eveonline.com) is due for an update for even the short term stuff like POS removal or wardec revamps which we know are coming. 
---
Please don't ask question... you maybe interested in these pink super skins.
---
Did you hear about the 10% valentine discount on plex?
---
Please just stop posting

That's probably why I've never succeeded in it

More a testament to your lack of knowledge about game mechanics - and the state of your bedroom.

maybe they meant from winter 2018 all the way through to winter in late 2019 :D hah

I hope the small Rancer groups kick their ass

Y he not banned and kicked?

Mar5hy, Omegalul.

I am new still. what is "FW"  thank you.

They are probably talking about Iceland version of Winter which lasted until June.

That would have been overly clever of them
---
Can someone explain what this station is? Is it an FOB?
---
To be fair [https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease](https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease) they have 64 bit client past the end of the month and chat improvements through most of next year!
---
bullshit! You can't compare the early days of BB with today, the game has just changed to much. And there was and will be always drama on NPSI organisations. Temp, Jane, Temp, Jake, Olmeca just to name of few incidents... NPSI is about the playerbase, leadership will change but the community stays. Simple as that. 
---
Yay! Everything the community was waiting for!

---
Great job learning frome very fight and not getting to attached to your ships. 
---
All the negativity on this subreddit lately, it is nice to see people still having fun and posting about it! 
---
"Also I wouldn't be surprised if they removed structures that are used primarily by the bots, the botting ships themselves. In this way, lets say they remove 20 supers or 600 Gilas or 2000 VNIs or 50 Rorquals from botters, those ships will technically be removed from the alliance that their owners are in."
---
Lord,,, just imagine the saltiness!!!  :)
---
what happened with olmeca 
---
Faction warfare
---
Super useful in a wormhole brawl due to its extra slots for other usages. Scrams for booshers bombs for ECM drones to name a few. They're a very useful ship for this role 
---
50/50 odds I bet the BPC in the end comes into the hands of someone in the Imperium or Legacy.
---
Update on the ship, Gneiss is done. Spod is all that's left, and then to find a cooker for said ship. need a super cap construction array.
---
why the FUCK do you deserve recognition from others for killing rats??? 
---
Faction warfare. In low security space, teams based on the npc empires have special mechanics and fighting going on. Amarr vs minmatar, gallente vs caldari. I'm not aligned with any side, but can pop into the FW "plexes" (deadspace areas behind acceleration gates that limit what sizes of ships can enter different plexes) to find fights both with actual FW member or other independent folks just looking for targets.

I feel like this happens often...
---
Especially right after one of the good PvPers posts a video of them slaying VNIs in a ship like the retri.  The next week I guarantee at least two kills on my VNI or Ishtar when I'm not watching it
---
doubtful.  Probably going to be a Sotiyo deep in a major nullsec coalitions space.  Also probably less then a half dozen people will know about the build and location.  once it comes out of production and the Komodo alt has it, then it will be broadcast to the alliance.
---
when people mentioned clean your ship, i though they all were definitely trolling, my venture never looked better! 
---
Thanks. Although I'm one of the people that do believe there's plenty to be negative about, and only ended up in fw/ls because I've tried and grown bothered by basically everything else... Lol. Bitching about a lot of stuff CCP is just absolutely terrible with isn't mutually exclusive with having fun, after all.
---
Npsi follows the fc’s red list. It always has they just recruit willing bodies.

If there isn't a buff torps stitch post in a solo BS thread is it really a solo BS thread
---
Dunno why they add more pages like ccplz when there is already an eve update, it’ll end up being outdated anyway when new mana ment team coms and come up with a new way of communicating about it 
---
Its funny that the Guardians Gala update hopscotched over the winter update on the updates page.
---
With how things currently set at you could just salvage after a person in x alliance and make about 15-25mil per site. Although that a lot of clicking.
---
Thanks for all that.  Still learning the lingo.  I’ve been playing 3 weeks and have been doing this, capturing novice and small outposts in Atron frigate.  
---
But I’m in .4 systems.  
---
I read the coms and want to go where the action is but haven’t got the nerve up.  
---
Ahh yes, I love Wormhomes.
---
Same, dual xlasb rapid heavy Raven with a nuet has gotten me a lot of dank fights. Lot of module management but an absolute blast to fly and you look cool as fuck. I've also seem a few super sp00ky meme fits do crazy shit like the armor Raven I've seen Jimmy fly.
---
Why, exactly?
---
I can see some appeal to getting more familiar with one type/fit/hull quicker so I could fly it with my eyes closed, and get to focus attention on what's going on around me instead of on remembering my optimals and whatever... but I think I'd get bored just undocking the same thing repeatedly.
---
Though really, the brawling autocannon punisher is kinda faceroll-y and all the rest of my ships have been scram kiters. I tried fitting some kitey stuff but it seems brutal to fit long range guns, a point, and a mwd compared to an fits. 
---
Sure you might be right but what's the issue with the current time if it's done within 3-5 days?
---
same. its not the carrier doing the shooting its the appropriately sized "Fighters" that are doing the shooting so leave carriers alone pls.
---
Ah yes another emote server for my collection. 
---
Need a new invite yours is full :(
---
is there a tldw I'm at work lol
---
I hate this rhetoric because I used to see a lot of people asking for skins and the art team doesn't rebalance nullsec.
---
Jebaited hard
---
If they want people to use The Agency window. They should put the location of botters in it as missions to go kill and get rewards.  
---
That coup was quicker than the Brave Newbies coup
---
Not sure how relevant, but no matter :D
---
That's awesome, thanks for sharing.
---
What's your ingame name? I can help you with some isk for fits, and you can have an easier time getting the nerve up since with free ships :)
---
I think there's a pretty significant difference in how effective a veteran player with a bunch of sp will be in a t1 frigate compared to a new player, but you can still win 1v1s picking your matches carefully and join in on others already fighting and stuff! I get the impression that most everyone around lowsec likes fresh blood and is happy to help with questions you have and stuff, so don't be afraid to ask or to ignore the few who are less-than-helpful.
---
 &gt;BB will never have a real chance of living up to its legacy of old. 
---
Get a load of this spin lmao. Bombers bar has always had internal drama. Olmeca declared a spergy holy war on them a year or 2 ago and teamed up with Inner Hell of all people to evict their 2 5 null, even the founder was more spergy than than mar5hy.
---
lol exactly, i rememeber waking up to the spectre fleet one and smh.
---
So most of the information you need to know about how much time is left is in the show info of the wh. When a hole goes end of life that means it's in the last 4 hours of it's life. If you land on an eol hole and have no prior info on it there is a small chance it could already be dead. 1 of 2 things could happen. 1 you will try to jump and it will throw you a message saying something like you have been spit back out and the hole will go away. 2 it will let you jump but will close right behind you. So if you absolutely do not want to get trapped on the other side just don't jump eol holes you know nothing about. o7
---
This seems fairly logical. If someone sells you stolen goods, and the police confiscate, guess what you get? Nothing. Is it a shop owners job to be the police? No. But you better learn how to determine ownership of good if you don't want to lose your ass. Someone bots in your alliance and they get caught, everything they put into you alliance gets taken. So you better figure out how to tell if they are botting, or you will lose your ass.
---
for what it is; bots are content beacons
---
Beat him at what?

Ayo, welcome back BB, please continue to dunk weebs and give us drama, we love it all.

Why do you deserve recognition for anything you do in this game?

---
Proving you don't have a hate boner one post at a time. I'm not convinced.
---
But then... who would have fun poking fun at you?
---
Oh also, if you’re ever roaming and the warzone seems a little quiet, or too many gangs about, come on over to black rise for some awesome 1v1 interactions, we still have a v dedicated group of solo pvpers and small pirate gangs, even if the battle between cal/galmil for the FW warzone is um..on hold. 
---
Oh I'm being bad and collecting tears. Just looking for tools to make it more efficient. ;)
---
I'd be okay with this if they didn't magically go invulnerable after each fighter death for a tick. I have 7 guns, theres no reason I can't kill 7 fighters at once.
---
Who says they should be able to rat?
---
&gt;t there has been clearly documentated cases, not to mention actual bans against some accounts in alliances and yet nothing?
---
But that would really negatively effect real people PVPing as alphas and probably do next to nothing to botters.
---
well, what's the issue with a 7 day period if it's done within 3-5 days?  the issue is basically who bears the risk if there is a delay, and since the freight guy is in charge of that risk, he's the one who should be bearing that risk.
---
We caught two of them in a 24 hour period

The problem is that they are getting counties 23.5/7. They don't care if they lose 2 supers every once in a while when they get some attention on them, they're getting billions every day.
---
Lol, you got me. I'll accept this typo. It's actually not that bad, considering a lot of people do live in them :D
---
Well played sir, well played.
---
Maybe it's good to try out different types of ships, and finally create a clone that is specialized to a certain playstyle or weapon type
---
So honestly most of the Time you gonna need a alt to really stop a gank in progress. 
---
Now there is no Ehp mark that will save you against all ganks, now the easy ganks to prevent are those in it for the money check the price on a t1 catalyst then check the dps (use pyfa), now you can calculate how many you need to kill you so now you known how much isk a gank against you would cost, now if that's more then 50% of the value of your ship your likely to be a profitable target, yes it really is that simple. 
---
Reported to PETA. You're going to jail, buddy.

Come to Amamake, we are having lots of content there, although you might want to get into a fleet, or if you want to try out your skills against multiple opponents.

---
It really was too long, lol.
---
About what?
---
It was a design goal that ESI would be a character level API, containing *no* account information. Thus, you pick the character who is exposed, and can only pick one. And the resultant information cannot be used to tie up to a different character on the same account, if you were to authorize that too.
---
This has annoyed the piss out of some people. 
---
It's possible to infer if it's an alpha level account, under some circumstances, but that's about it. (if you're skill training, or have trained a skill to a level that an alpha can't have)
---
For now, I don't see it changing. It's always possible, but it would require a change of direction.

The good people behind EVEsterdam have laid a solid foundation and made Amsterdam one of the world's party capitals. **A keynote presentation will kick off the tour and give insight into what lies ahead for EVE**, players and developers will speak, battle in spaceships and of course explore the Amsterdam nightlife.
---
Sir Fred, at least.
---
&gt; I'd love to see a cerb fleet show up to hit a sotiyo in delve or esoteria....
---
why would FRT be building things in delve or esoteria?
---
I don't think anyone with a brain has even noticed their presence.
---
\+1 For Eve Isk Per hour.    
---
I was finally able to get this working about 2 weeks ago....     
---
Spreadsheets are all fun and games until you start building structures.  
---
Minor complaint: In the [instructions](http://eveiph.github.io/ESIAuthorizationInstructions.html) scroll all the way down to last section, Step 2: Enter on the the port number in the Port box.  What port box?
---
Great job on this btw..
---
Haven't we been told Logis on Killmails soon last fanfest? Well, these ultra-nice mobilegames need ressources too i guess.
---
I see your first point, But You'd receive lvl1-4 hull upgrades bonus on a bs... BS wouldn't change. Bs would work exactly the same way as they do now.
---
Frigates would just say not be effected by lvl4 and 5 of the skill. 
---
The only thing God scowls at in Eve is bots.  The sixth commandment is clear, no alphas in faction ships of any kind.
---
Why does CCP disobey God?
---
this was the goal - and for this to happen those things need to spawn only in NPC space. 
---
And that from an ex-member of two maidens one chalice lul
---
The only thing inflated is plex...  When people are talking about record low prices for titans, that would be the opposite of inflation no?
---
You looked online and only found some 2010 fits? seems like you didnt look very hard m8. here, stratios fits (from "online") [https://zkillboard.com/ship/33470/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/33470/losses/) and plenty from today. explorer fits are easy to pick out. as many other says here, the specialized explorer frigs are superior for the role of running most exploration sites.
---
then any one willing to contest it can pre stage a ships in desired location in NPC station        
---
The whole reason why those kind of fights can happen is due to fact that those things cannot be hidden in a 3 mid deep pockets of sov space.

Huh. Apparently I'm in 100 discord servers and can't be in any more :(

Im guessing they are gonna make announcements during the world tour. So the first is end of next month. 
---
Battleships have a bunch of issues. A TD frigate can basically make you useless.
---
Yeah I'm just messing with you. I like the idea though. I actually want to push it further so it only happens in low sec. So people don't get to use their super/titan power bashing it that comfortably, plus it make LS less deadly.
---
Because they won't build this Komodo
---
Part of the issue from what I've seen is the ambition was greater than the technology available. They tried to roll out Drifter Incursions but it broke the servers bad so they rolled it back. Even today as far as I'm aware what they -want- to do with the AI versus what it's capable of is a few miles apart.
---
It's an attempt by CCP at a long, over arching story line which I appreciate. Besides even if they do manage to get everything right and introduce some massive menace properly, you know as well as I people will have it figure out in a week and on farm in two. It's just the way of an MMO and so to take interest in the story you have to blind yourself a bit to the actual mechanics of the game I think.
---
ooooh, what monitor set up do you have to get screenshots like that?
---
and i doubt anyone else has the balls to go to delve or eso if it's being built there.
---
i'd love to be proven wrong, though.
---
Oof
---
894 hours and 37 minutes
---
So we'll get to find out at the end of march what they have planned for Summer, which will be pushed back to Winter? Woot
---
Not pictured: the cloaky proteus watching your every move.
---
What if I told you you can detect which systems have titans in build.
---
Check out dital, its got all the infrastructure and its next to providence. And spectre fleet also stages from there. More than enough customers, great location and possibilities for getting into contracting ships.
---
Holy shit, i was afk for that. Did they end up retracting the money?
---
Doesn’t matter how cheap the ships I fly are, sooner or later I’ll run out of isk and have to take another few days exploring to earn it all back. I’m not very risk averse as it is, but if I could fly ships all day without having to worry about funds I’d be yolo’ing them into enemy fleets a whole lot more often 
---
You're an actual retard lmbo
---
Oh ye, we noticed, we win ever fight against SMA and every critical fight goons pop up :)
---
Not complaining, that's what its like being the resistance.
---
Shit you got me fam.

50-100 AU systems and local

That's all I'm going to say.

---
Congrats, now apply to Hard Knocks Inc. 
---
well then, I hope you also reported them for being bots then, after killing them...or you just hunting easy kills, repeatedly.
---
Completely agree, this and frostline was too complicated and opaque. Where did the days go of simple farming of accelerators and drugs!
---
Repping POCOs
---
Oh shit that's what I get for not reading the OP linky.  My apologies.  Seems like you're on to something.
---
So more of you refusing to acknowledge that this isn't about me and that it's about retention of new players in a game that has always struggled to do so?
---
That's what you don't seem to get in my interactions with you. This doesn't affect **me** at all. But it definitely affects new player retention in EVE. I fully get that **you** may not give a shit about that, but CCP as a whole, and other players in game, both old and new, do....so I really don't know what to tell ya bud.
---
wanna roam together?
---
Yesss
---
don't worry will list aridia ones also. 
---
Looks like you’re doing great job.
---
Theorycrafting is really important in LS frig pvp, especially in 1vs1, because it’s about picking winnable fight, and reducing variants.
---
Of course, you must run and heat modules properly and stay calm when things go odd. But theorycrafting also helps this part; If you simulate well in brain before fight, It’s hard to make mistake.
---
In frig PVP, most of the time, you must ask yourself “Do I have range control?” at first.
---
If not, you must check what range will enemy prefer, and If it is not your prefered range, you must think about you will still win even in enemy’s range.
---
Generally, you will not want to fight against very skilled player if you don’t have range control. They will just disengage and bail even if fight goes in your favor. It’s kinda pointless when you can’t kill enemy anyway. But average players are bad for utilizing range control, so It’s worth to take the fight against, even they can bail anytime in theory.
---
So you must check possible enemy’s kb before fight, If you’re going to take fight that you don’t have range control.
---
If you have range control, You must check If you can win when you’re doing best and enemy is doing worst. If it is, why not? just engage. 
---
But you must always remember you can run away If you want. Don’t be space samurai and die; You already sacrificed some resources to get range control, so running away is not dishonorable thing.
---
Even you do everything perfect what you simulated, you’ll lose some fight cuz there is much variants like drug, implant, manual piloting or just lucky wrecking shots. 
---
So always be ready to die! and have fun.
---
Sure, if you ignore economics as a whole and you're only talking about isk inflation. You can inflate the market with materials too. Say you have a shit ton of bots flooding the market with minerals. Supply increases, demand isn't increasing, so the price has to drop. 
---
I mean pretty much what I said would happen happened no? CCP returned the channel to the BB community members and life goes on?
---
**All the spin in here because literally everyone on /r/Eve has mutual disdain for both CCP and thinks BB as a whole = Marshy doesn't change the fact that CCP recognizes what community is.** It doesn't change the fact that NPSI communities help new players branch out into other areas of the game either. So while I might have lost some useless internet points going against the narrative, I'll continue to do it if it's a stupid narrative driving the discussion here.
---
[removed]
---
If i remember correctly, the first time they talked about logi on killmails was back on 2012 ...
---
more ways to draw attention off of real problems, more ways to confuse the player base with different flashy web pages...
---
i got shit at by goon diplos for killing some horrible vni bots (grrr killing blues), reported em all to ccp, thats now a few weeks ago and they are still about, 30ish toons running vni's 23/7 , making 1.2b each per day 
---
I think so, yes
---
I expect that once the take over happened spending was frozen or even cut back. Teams probably lost focus due to time spent justifying a paycheck too the new boss.  Some priorities were realigned with more development time refocused to profits with the side effect of pushing out release dates on all other projects.  The next move will involve closing the Iceland office and relocating to a country with  tax breaks and a wealth of talent to recruit from.  Its logical and emotional attachment will not be a factor to the new owners.
---
you spend 2bil on the pod to scan fast, and then don't use a +50% strength scanner :thonking:
---
So your problem is A) Higher Prices, B) Lower Prices, C) something else?
---
That's a pretty lame excuse, you are basically asking for no permanent loss which goes against the core principles of the game.
---
As an advice, find the easiest, fastest and/or afkable isk making activity and fly cheap ships; there problem solved. For me it was a VNI alt orbiting an anom in my second monitor while I roam, more than enough to found my pvp needs.
---
You can only do it once a year in a non-clone station, so make sure you really want it there. 
---
I suffered an emotional crit when i saw the date ...
---
How many accounts do you have?
---
I’m not saying that would be a good thing; it would completely ruin the game. But permanent loss does encourage and reward being risk averse 
---
Surely not applying them doesn't get you around the falloff. CCP can't possibly be that stupid (particularly as they aren't for the calculations for alpha clones).
---
Depending on where in high sec you are you can have a relatively safe mining experience. Even near JITA there are quiet spots, you just have to keep an eye out for them and who is coming and going from the system.
---
Mission running, Exploration, Markets, Combat sites, Ganking are basically your solo pve activities.    You can also do incursions if you don't mind the occasional Pve group.  
---
basically you can easily make enough to fund come pvp activities.  Plexing your account will be harder.  
---
Burner missions in Venal is probably the best oak maker for an independent right now. 
---
serious question: why is the meme about a cloaky proteus? did they used to be awesome cloaky hunting ships? started playing after the t3 rebalance
---
Exploration in null or wormholes, abyssal sites, L4 and L5 missions are the most lucrative for a single account, single player. L5 missions can be run with a carrier or a barghest, it'll cost about the same but the carrier obviously insures better.
---
That’s not quite true. Scan strength is affected by diminishing returns, that's why 1) 1 T2 + hyperspatial rig is more efficient than 2 T1 rigs 2) scan acquisition array &gt; scan rangefinding array and 3) RSS probes are a waste of money
---
...assuming you have max skills, all implants and a faction launcher. Difference between 200 and 220 isn't really noticeable. Just do 4 AU scans on planets instead and you get half of the signatures to 100% in the first round.
---
you tell us
---
I'd be sad if seagulls plan was never seen to completion. CCP has spent years building towards it slowly, it would be a shame to let it go.
---
It really depends on how much ISK you are looking at.
---
You can make quite decent income (say at least about 100-200M per hr) by bliz LS missions with a single stealth bomber toon. But of course that need some rep build up and proper skills trained.
---
But of course that comes together with risk, though as stealth bomber you are somehow safe in most situations, you can still lose your ship (which need some bling) to smartbomb gangs or some other rare situations.
---
Exploration, fw, pvp(example: ganking or nullsec ganking / camping), market trading, you can always join horde no auth required,  mission running in nullsec?, highsec incursions, wh daytrips(I've not done this, idk), you can always join Winter Coalition(Fraternity etc.) \^\^ we're recruiting.
---
umm, thats literally what you did xD
---
Dude, after just a few days, you're better than I.
---
Although I typically warped to plex and waited. :/ 
---
I'm still a newb when it comes to pvp. 
---
You're inspiring me to stick with it though!
---
TIL your ships get dirty and you can clean them
---
And using BB as a Pamfam Tool isn't?
---
independent.....mostly whs then.
---
honestly the best profits all come with groups.
---
a carrier or a bargh o.0
---
not a rattle?  sheesh i need to see this bargh fit
---
You mean his NC. PL Special Interests fleets? 
---
Can’t wait for Amsterdam! My first CCP event 
---
This is my reddit comment of the week :D 
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 
---
rattle will eat shit and die, especially to missions like The Fortress. The barghest uses its range bonuses to its advantage. the carrier warps in, aligns out, blaps the objective, gets off grid asap. it too will eat shit if it stays there for too long.
---
here's the fit: https://pastebin.com/4qVdK0ED
---
Wait, they are working on the chat client.....
---
A tip for fighting in Minmatar ships like the Breacher:
---
If your opponent has similar ranges (like a torm, rail comet, or CNI), dive in and out. Maybe start far, be on the look out for a pause in damage being applied to you, then dive in... Look for another pause, then dive back out.
---
This is admitidely tough in a frig fight bc they're so short, but it's doable. The benefit of Minnie is the speed and if you can make the opponent change ammo a couple times it's sort of evens out the fact that you likely do less dps than your opponent. 
---
Ffs I'm like wow this is interesting.
---
...
---
2005. Fucking stainguy lol
---
I smell a spy.
---
Cool. I can spare the irl money to plex my account, I just want enough isk to fund fun PvP ships.
---
Basically, 1 Omega. I can possibly swing the cash to Omega another account if that's how it has to be, though.
---
 Doesn't delve have several?
---
bait
---
I could look into that. i like bombers, so I would probably have trained them anyway. So I can look into what the requirements are for running L4s. Thanks.
---
Where the hell are we going? 
---
aw fuck it was delve
---
Thanks for the ideas.

Without wanting to cause offence, I've been a TEST lad through-and-through for a while, so I don't think I'll be joining Frat any time soon :)

---
Meh.  weak showing from a star shit poster.  You gotta pump those  rookie numbers up! 
---
Thanks. I'ma try to keep it to one Omega account if I can, so L4s seem to be the way forward as far as steady-income goes (with other bits to mix it up every now and then). I'll look into how they work.
---
ayo

Any reason why Venal in particular?

how is ganking PVE?
---
They were pretty much the standard for cloaky shenanigans not involving bombers
---
Yeah it will be tough. But it is possible to Plex a account doing exploration. But if you are going to do that much scanning you would really benefit from being in a wormhole Corp that pays out to scouts for kills.
---
Personally I am isk independent using 3 low skill Omega rattlesnakes and a drifterhus in a C5. 10 bill a month with way less time/isk investment.
---
I laughed. +1

This is why you pay your bills on time, RIP GOTG
---
Obviously it's Delve... although not necessarily by the direct route.
---
All trades in eve are meant to be made using in game currency, even character trades. It's like using monopoly money to buy hotels in monopoly. It's a game. It starts getting retarded when people start paying out of pocket with USD for boardwalk without even landing on it.
---
Follow the rules or you're a scumbag. There's honest ways to make money and if you can afford a desktop with stable internet to bot many eve accounts you're likely in an area where you don't have to resort to stealing and ruining a popular hobby for a lot of people to pay for food or your second Ferrari.

Two things jump to mind.. A low class wormhole.  say a C2/C3/HS.  Give you access to pretty much unlimited isk through rolling statics.. Can also manufacture there if you're into that sort of thing.  PI, while wrist slitting is good passive income.    
---
I have two accounts with one "out of corp" toon.  He sits in perimeter buy/sell/manufacture either in perimeter or Jita.  Use the profits to buy more lucrative BPO's, research, etc..

I have all you just mentioned, except i have a bit more time then 15 minutes of time to play eve. If you only have 15 minutes of time to spend, eve is not a game for you.
---
Hell, you cannot even run 1 abyssal site in 15 minutes, including setting up and all.

You make some interesting points and I am definitely curious about how no killboard would influence low scale pvp. I don't think it would ever happen but if it did I guess zkill would just need your permission to advertise your character? Maybe when you got a kill and the player had it disabled it could just say the kill report without the name but still include alliance and stuff?
---
I would have zkill disabled for my character if the option existed.
---
Let's give you an example of this: 
---
In CS:GO if a cheater is found in your match you win is taken away and you lose rank.

Are you being punished or is you illegitimate win taken away, same applies here are you being punished or is and advantage you got by others cheating taken away.

---
Falcons last post on the topic in the archived forums lists using broadcasting while chatting as against the rules.

It's got Blood Raiders though. Which means plenty of cheap faction mods and ships. I love how Ashimmu hull goes for just 50mil for example. There's nothing like that in drone regions...

I'm pretty sure this is on the roadmap. Expect a patch in the near future of 2025. :)

---
Completely independent of one another. There are times when Eve is pushing relatively high concurrent logins and reddit is slow / dead. There are also times when reddit is on fire, but the logins that day (or even week) are very low.
---
I'd say that subreddits are only an indicator of if a game is somewhat new and alive (not always, but some older games have no active subreddit but do have a somewhat alive community example: Everquest) but not if they are dead. AKA you can assume a game with an active subreddit is alive but there are plenty of games without active (highly active anyways) subreddits that are also alive.

Not a real move op without D-Scans
---
I'm sure it just takes experience to get a feel for it all! Maybe I've been lucky, but I find a fight in like 5-10 minutes from undocking usually. I've just travelled through the half dozen systems by amamake since they seem so active.
---
Dscan at 14.3 as I warp to a perch in the new system, warp to safes near anything that's too far to dscan, I really only check the novices. Maybe warp to an empty novice and sit for a few minutes if there's several+ in local to see if they come for a fight, or move on if it's quiet. I'm hoping my name starts being recognized as "oh, yeah, he actually is doing frigate PvP" and it helps bring out anyone else who wants to do it too, lol.
---
The layout of systems/gates in caldari/gallente space seems a lot different than in minmatar/amarr space. I wonder if that could affect travel times to find fights.
---
Init are a strong and independent alliance stop trying to downplay them!
---
This is a terrible post and it's shake week.. For the sake of not getting in the way of propaganda / meta you can repost it just, like, apply 5 seconds of effort to the OP. Some words would be nice, mostly. Maybe even go crazy and add a picture or two. If you want to get real creative make the post have words and pictures then post a youtube video of you narrating those pictures in a spooky echo voice. I'd upvote that.
---
can someone PLEASE notify VILY so he doesn't get STABBED in the back AGAIN
---
L4s work best if you do the burners, especially if you decide to stay in high sec. Do the Sisters of Eve out in Osmon, it's the best constellation layout. 
---
Do some T4 Abyssals too, they pay pretty well and if you want you can grind them up and build Triglav stuff for export.
---
dark shines can boosh into my bed with that accent any day
---
Nah. I never shit post. It was already on track to match my others in the hundreds. I'll let someone else do the same thing so you can have another person to lord over
---
Probably will, yeah. To be fair that makes more sense seeing as they're interested in defending members of their coalition against a deployment :smart:
---
If I were deploying with a SIG, my corp or my alliance (that's within a coaltion) I wouldn't have been too satisified to see all your other allies jump on as well, ruins the fun.
---
But we'll see how it goes. Props to TEST for going without Legacy tho.
---
I've noticed that the times I've lost scram so far, nobody has made a move to get out. And when I've not been scrammed (presumably because someone was saving cap, based on their fits in losses), I rarely even notice during the actual fight. Definitely more experience is needed to get more things under control without needing direct, special attention to them, so I can notice more stuff like that.
---
I've been thinking about trying out fits without scrams or points to try to take advantage of the fact that people don't always disengage even when they can, to give me an extra boost that lets me get a good fight out of more enemies even if I have to warp in on their terms.
---
I definitely don't feel the need to die because someone gets the best of me. Imo being able to slip away shows that they didn't really have full control; if someone gets away from me, I'll just think "well how can I avoid them escaping next time?" So far all that's meant is I warped away from a worm and a 3v1 before there were actually fights though.
---
Do a lot of folks use drugs or implants in FW, in general? I havent been yet (well I'm in 2 +4s I guess, don't pod me bro). Figured maybe once I feel (a lot) more comfortable flying t1 ships I might start using drugs or some cheaper implants to try to give me an edge to take fights against faction frigs? Not sure if I'd rather do that or just start flying faction frigs along with the t1s also. 
---
T5 abyssal-sites upfront costs can be demanding, but once you're comfortable with it, relatively easy 200m+ ISK/h.

ISK per hour is great until you realize that making modules at "good profit margin" doesn't work because you need to sell days worth of trade volume to make that ISK.
---
Just build Sabres, they sell pretty well...

---
&gt;Hey guys.  
---
&gt;I'm coming back to EvE after a little while away, and want to strike out a bit as a loner (perhaps rolling occasionally with some NPSI type fleets).  
---
&gt;As someone who's only ever really been in a sov-holding alliance, I'm not really clear on what the opportunities (or, rather what the *best* opportunities) are for making ISK in the case where I, for example, don't have sov to rat in or whatever.  
---
&gt;This in mind, anyone have any advice on how they make ISK as "independent" players? The thoughts which come to mind for me are market trading (which I was never very good at, but maybe I can learn?) or wormhole-type exploration (which kinda sounds cool to me, but I have 0 idea how lucrative it is). But maybe I'm missing something?  
---
&gt;Thanks.
---
Hi
---
I solo on single account vast majority of the game nowadays and use other accounts for when I get the itch for some fleet stuff or some old timers log on etc. I always sub at minimum 1 account. I plex any alts that I might want to duo with or on rare occasion triple with. On rare occasion, if I know I will be using an alt for an extended time period, I will sub that instead of plexing as well, especially if there is a promotion or something and I can use a 3 or 6 month sub with it. If you intent to plex all your accounts without subbing at least 1, you will have a very hard and unpleasant time in the game and will likely burn out and quit. 
---
So, my main account is mostly PvE. I rarely PvP on it. My income varies and jumps around quite a bit depending on what I feel like doing, how much I play, and is also drop RNG dependant , I make anywhere between 1.5 bil / month to about 10 bil / month. 
---
Things that I do:
---
Farm T4 and T5 Abyss - T5 is really good income but unreliable, and if I get a "socket closed" while in a T5 it becomes a loss. So I scale down to T4, a lot less income but its very steady and I manage to clear them fast enough to have enough time to fully reboot everything, router included, get back in the game and safely get out. It is to a large extent RNG drop dependant. I have had literally single play sessions where I made upwards of 6 bil, and literally play sessions where I actually lost ISK when I ran exotic or gamma filaments due to filament costs. The average for me is about 150 ish mil / hr of off T4s, 250 ish mil / hr of off T5s. Ship loss is a big deal here due to heavy bling of both ship and pod. It hurts a lot.
---
Run DED sites. Initial income is just slightly over that of doing L4s. Rest is RNG dependant on how many escalations you get and how many you successfully complete. First RNG is on getting actual escalations. You will have entire streaks of not getting any and get pissed and stop doing them for a bit because of it, on the flipside, you will sometimes get lucky and get multiple escalations in a row or very close to each other. More RNG: Escalations are mostly into Low Sec. So depending on how many players and which systems etc. you may or may not be able to run and complete them, if you are feeling fisky like I do sometimes, this is where I PvP. Basically I have an alt to help me out 1 or 2 jumps out and do them in lower DPS but much higher tanked ships. So I bait a little bit this way. More escalation RNG: Drops. That's all. Plain and simple. Your escalation income will go up / down with what you get for drops. Its difficult for me to even average it all out to hourly income, but I would say its between 100-200 mil / hr. but it can be done in much cheaper ships then those I use for Abyss, so loss hurts, but no where near.
---
Missions. I do L4 missions with burners. Some people make an army of mission pullers to get burners only, I tried this out, it was kinda assenine and stupid so I went back to regular play and its just fine despite the lower income. I simply do L4 missions, take them as they come and do not decline burners but switch ships and do them as well. My income of off this is relatively low, around 70-120 mil / hr depending on loot and how much time I actually spend playing vs fucking around. And I like to fuck around. Doing L4s is very chill. If you wanna make better ISK you can go into blitzing mode and up everything, you will make around 120-150 mil / hr if you dont skip burners. If you skip burners you will make around 90-110 mil / hr depending on market swings of your given LP value. Note that the bigger chunk of L4 income, especially if you blitz, is not immediate. You have to convert your LP into goods then sell those goods. If you do full clears you will make less per LP, but you can get around 40-50 mil / hr immediate, rest at LP sale.
---
WH dives. I do some explo, sometimes for 2-3 days at a time because I go far, the further you go, the more value the sites have, if you jsut stay close you can't earn any real ISK. The income varies greatly depending on drop RNG and PvP. I literally can not give you a per hour number here. I had trips where I came back with nothing but 200/300 mil and I had trips where I came back with 3 bil in my cargo. I also had trips where I lost 3 bil in my cargo while coming back. I use armor / HAM Loki, though in the past, I used a Tengu especially before the ECM nerf because even though its slower then using a frig and a bigger loss, going for trips of this length is just overall better and I have a much better chance of getting out of PvP or dealing with occasional rats. 
---
Events are sometimes good income, especially the 1st week of an event, but this has lately declined in overall gameplay quality, between rediculous shit such as bugs, whiteout, fucked up camera, stupid high skill reqs even for maxxed toons, and to top it off idiotic mining requirements. It all just got so stupid that I stopped doing them. Income or no income, they are just no longer fun or good content to play for me. If it ever changes I might come back to them but am not holding my breath for it.
---
FW. FW you can do in super cheap ships and clones, downside is faction standing loss, huge one. You will end up podding people and it causes a big drop in sec too. Instead of grinding factions back and forth I brough out one of my PvP characters and just dedicated it for FW, much easier. But I didn't stick with it. It has a lot of problems currently, ranging from cap drops on you to bot armies, like literally, bot armies nowadays, to much of other bullshit too. Overall it left a bad taste in me and I abandoned the FW along with my toon. The LP income is great though, if you don't mind the bullshit it may be for you. And I extremely do not recommend doing it on your main character.
---
So these are the things I do. mostly solo, like I said only exception is when I do LS escalations with some side PvP.
---
If you want to avoid PvP altogether for a while, then its mainly just missions. You can do some marketing, trading, indy or mining too. I have done it a bit but this sort of stuff is so boring to me it makes it unplayable, I just simply have to blow some shit up even if I take a break from it once in a while.

Hitting cyno for your standing fleet makes you very very elite

What can you expect from an alliance that was literally created when some of our pets were collapsing and we needed somewhere to dump the shitty meat shield corps. 
---
Why are you trying to argue that botting doesnt cause issues?
---
Aggressive Relocation of assets
---
that statement is there for the rule-bending with doing shit that goons always loved to do.
---
boo-hoo I was just broadcasting to a text file that was being read by a different 3rd party tool that rebroadcast it to a remote server that then pressed a key with a mechanical finger i setup, fuck CCP!
---
They are bad, but they are better then nothing if permament ones are determined to be a bad idea by CCP.
---
I don't tweet, Sorry. Am too fucking old :( . I don't do twitters, facebooks, popchats asschats whateverthefuckchats, all that type of shit. Using Reddit, game forums, discord and teamspeak is as close as it gets for me.

(x) Doubt

So like.... 12 hours?

Activate tactical overview as long as you are outside of abyssal space.

Well at least it works for me. I hope for you too

Ah, I see. Thanks.

That's just EU.

Wife/kids
---
Thanks much for the thorough write-up! I'll probably lean towards doing T4s and L4s, with some exploration in there too, to mix things up.
---
Though I should probably actually read up on what these Abyssal sites actually are; they weren't in the game when I last played it.

Because Starfleet needs people that ping fleets to distract from the fact that he's perma-afk

CCP doesn't mind if he logs of and plays other games instead, it's not like he actually pays for his subs.
---
Yes.
---
Ah thats a very good reason!

Bring it

I have no idea where you have been the last few months, but uh....I hate to break it to you. Eve isnt competitive anymore. 
---
The AT is gone..
---
Goons are national champs in the MER
---
Everyone and their brother drops caps on anything, cuddly or dangerous.
---
Eve isnt very competitive anymore
---
ya but it's not an intentional thing
---
there is a difference between accidentally exploiting and intentionally exploiting
---
There are two leaderboards.  Leaderboard the first, zkill!  Leaderboard the second, Reddit.  Make of eve as you will. 
---
I understand and I think its very sad but I wouldn't make it there anyway because im relatively new
---
maybe if marshy is making you look so terrible you spend days and days angryposting on reddit about it, you should just get rid of the known eula violator
---
God damn you goonies are salty at Mar5hy. Nearly anything he puts in discord ends up on reddit.
---
i got like 150b over 2 days just afking in fleet, lol
---
 PL never wanted to be a big blob 
---
I don’t know what they expected to happen, even if they didn’t jump dreads the super and titan would have died anyway.
---
+1 for the soundtrack.
---
Days and days. It's been 12 hours bud. Spin some more and get back to your mining eh?
---
I mean, there's zkill rankings, you can climb those if you want: 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1832436128/ranks/ 
---
besides that, playing EVE "competitively" is mostly a case of trying to win fights that you may not be favored in. a lot of small gang groups enjoy playing EVE like that
---
Skill points and familiarity, but your points have merit too.
---
I'm not complaining. Blood Raiders ships are dope
---
He's good people. I met him during a random roam to the eve gate during a seasonal event like a year or so ago. 
---
This is the real answer. You can complain all you want about killboards and it is true that there is probably way to much free intel in there but let’s be honest it won’t change. What you have to do is to put yourself in a situation where this intel doesn’t give a big advantage to your opponent or where he doesn’t have the time or the willingness to check it. Passively sitting at 0 in a plex all day with a cheeky dual web no scram fit will work less and less over time but being agressive at warping blind to plexes and sliding in will force the opponent to react fast without checking zkill first. Not gonna repeat what the poster above says about fighting the blob or stepping up your game towards more complex engagements where intel doesn’t change much but even at a simple level using flexible fits that allow you to be fast and agressive but disengage if you can’t hold will help you to rush people’s decisions and convince them to stay for a fight.
---
plexing your accounts is as good as or better for CCP as someone subbing with cash
---
Rail harpy fitting is very tight
---
Haha Hey man. We all learn at some point sometimes no talking in local is best in Wspace XD 
---
hey, mar5hy fans. you can join this public discord here, and you too can stay up to date with everything Mar5hy says and does before it gets on reddit :) https://discordapp.com/invite/54gHzMR
---
Unavailable in my country? :/
---
Does he also get a timer if the enters and exits the wormhole too many times in a row? Asking for a friend. 
---
Did you drop ISK into my account?  Because I have $100 mil suddenly.  Thank you very very much.
---
Something like that ^^
---
Well, apparently you screwed up NC's plans. So good job. Why they so skered?
---
Thanks for drawing attention to yet another broken game mechanic favoring the nullbear side. Deployed bubble in 2 seconds by 1 person requires an entire slippery pete or a boosh raven fleet to clear because NPCs camp it and cannot warp off. Nobody knows why this is even a thing. 
---
Make your own leaderboard.
---
An optimized L5 setup beats most ways of isk making and can be done without an alliance or group.
---
Requires significant upfront investment of time and isk to get the carriers and pullers, but once that's done it's crazy isk/h in relative safety. 
---
Finding an empty or unused C5 is also good, but that requires more than 2 accounts to be efficient.
---
I don't see any INIT on this killboard. Relates to INIT because it's Imperium?
---
Nice recording 
---
no one cares ??????????
---
this is essentially player harassment you guys need to chill the fuck out
---
Nice visuals 
---
It's a fair and balanced game mechanic, just siege a dread on the undock to clear the bubble. What are you, a poor?
---
Flair checks out. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE

Go in a stealthy and monitor locals, figure out who uses/owns the space and talk to them
---
I recommend you check the official forums and watch some youtube videos. On the game forums there is a ton of info, fits, discussions, etc. I'll give you some heads up here:
---
Abyssal sites are no where and everywhere. You don't find them, you create them sort of, or more precisely, a wormhole style entrance to them and you do so on demand any place that you want.
---
You buy Abyssal filaments on market (Jita works well) or get them in data sites. Its better to just buy them. Exotic and Gamma are easiest to run but most expensive. Filaments also get dropped inside the Abyssal sites themselves. To make good income, you will need to stop runnign the exotic and gamma filaments and sell them off, while running the more difficult ones. Difficult ones are Dark and Fire. Electrical is middle of the 2 both in cost and difficulty. Every Filament type has a "weather effect" similar to WH effect, you can right clikc on a filament, see what the effect is and what it does to you and your ship. You need to fly a ship and / or fit accordingly to an effect or you will die.
---
Once you have a filament in your ships cargo, you simply go to desired location, right click on it, and "use filament". This is when the entrance to Abyssal space is formed.
---
I highly recommend you start off with T1 and T2 filaments, set up your overview while inside an Abyssal pocket of T1, etc. 
---
These sites can and will cause ship loss. You need to know and understand mechanics before you jump into T4s. Sofarm T3s for a bit. You need to know spawns, target priorities, Abyssal weather effects. How different ships move, what are best ways to tank / counter them, all that. Do not expect to just jump into it like into a mission and survive. Also, Abyssal sites have a 20 minute timer after which entire pocket collapses killing you with your ship. I recommend you do this intentionally once or twice, its a bit of a trip, just go in some cheap ship, cheap filament, and clone with no implants.
---
there are boundaries, some people depending on their PCs and graphic settings have difficult time seeing them, if you fly outside of a boundary, you will start taking damage and you have to return to the pocket or die.
---
Current Abyss meta ship is the Gila. You can use other ships as well, but Gila is very prominent and for good reasons. To run T4s and T5s, you will need to bling it, seriously.
---
For T4s, you can bling using just faction and some C or B type modules, for T5s you will need to go to A Types and have a pod with at least mid grades implants. 
---
The most common Gila fit is a passive with 3x extenders, but it is very limited to type of filaments it can do. The active Gila is more expensive, harder to play but it does excellent in Electrical filaments and fairly well in fire as well, but not dark.
---
Electrical filaments can also be ran in Zealots and Phantasms, most people taht do this like the Zealot, I do not, I like the Phantasm due to its speed which also enables me to get even better income as I can loot not just the primary loot cache, but also drill sites. You can of course fit MWD on your ship, but I hate it, the sig bloom always causes me problems and occasional ship loss, not to mention makes full neut spawns much more difficult to deal with. I stay with AB fits.
---
When looking at Abyss videos on Youtube, make sure they are not older then 3-4 months, as there have been fairly recent changes, make sure that they have drill sites in them as that is also a recent change, so you understand what these are. You may end up skipping most of them.
---
I also highly recommend watching some videos of full neut spawns. Abyss sites have random spawns, worst of which for a lot of people is when all NPC ships spawned have energy neutralizers. It kills a lot of ships.
---
Interesting. complaining how a region is too safe because his activity isn't safe enough
---
Oh many, please give us a reason to finally stop being "honourable" and going full booshfleet.
---
It's such a fun mechanic and FCs are too scared of being called meanie faces to use it.
---
don't buy tickets yet... might be pushed back lol
---
&gt;  essentially player harassment 
---
Welcome to Goon culture. 
---
~~~psyops~~~
---
don't be mad, one day PL will do the same and we will all be there to upvote
---
Nothing lazy about a bot docking up the second you enter the system when it's far too far away to warp to in even the fastest ceptor.
---
This is the result of all the attempts at disrupting Delve PvE. The rats will get you. Goons have been protecting those who roam into Delve from these dangerous rats for ages. 
---
Got any neutral, public groups to suggest?
---
silly goose.. there can be no One Man Zerg...
---
So Init deploying to jita?
---
5 years working in customer support for a major video game taught me on thing. Every single person who has ever been banned or caught cheating claims it was an accident. 
---
[it doesn't favour the nullsec side, lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivCEbJ4rfQ). 
---
in fact, they're so ticked off about people doing it to them (hi, Dawn Rhea), that the reason they starting doing it (and posted this thread), is so people whine about the bad goonies abusing a broken mechanic, enough that it makes CCP take notice and nerf the ESS trap.
---
it's what they always do when somebody finds an emergent gameplay mechanic that could be used against them. and you just fell for it.
---
Yet they were always part of one....
---
The reason why participation trophies exist
---
It was that empty in Hakonen?
---
Direct him to the 2009-2015 PL video of move op fleets
---
Amarr bro
---
So why are there plenty of people that kill bots all the time, without those problems?
---
okay, well if you think he intentionally tried to input that shit into chat i think you're delusional, so your comment here is pretty retarded
---
all spank, no tank. in the situation you describe this is generally done in t1 destroyers.
---
Keeping the legacy of awesome Init videos going (Favorite was Firewall), please make some during the actual war plez
---
No. It is a broken mechanic in both cases. Or when wormholes Astrahus-farm drifters.
---
Favors the nullsec side because there are almost no macroeconomic consequences of a few people using NPCs to bait people.
---
WE LIKE TO PARTY 
---
Right.... So is your argument that there is only 1 person botting or just 1 bot that everyone uses? Because uh...
---
Yeah I'm calling the police! mitanni you're going to get arrested!
---
I said "we brought" not "we'll only bring"
---
Imagine getting burned out of your home without even putting up a fight
---
There is no ESI endpoint for account status or subscription time remaining. You need to check this in game or on CCP’s website manually 
---
catalyst.  blasters.  antimatter or void.   get close. and blast away
---
No,  
---
My argument is that rather than complaining, people have devised ways around those problems to do kill these bot ratters consistently. Why can they achieve to get hundreds of bot kills and you fail to do so?
---
ok thanks a lot :( :)
---
write a bot that station trades for you
---
Steal.
---
Interesting! Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; Some super interesting metrics have come out of the shift to this approach when we're looking at activity :) 
---
I'll bet! That just screams "dev-blog", you know. ;-) With so much focus lately on "how many accounts do players actually have?" and much speculation on what the average is, I'll bet pretty much everyone here would love to see some of you guys's data and conclusions on this.
---
The best music.
---
To answer a question asked earlier today, by u/globbyreborn IIRC, this is why we have NPC killmails
---
Despite long years of heavy AFKing many miners still didn't turn into NPCs. :S
---
CCP basically gets 20 bucks for a sub through Plex. Instead of 15. 
---
please buy a better skin!
---
ALL OF MY THIS. SIMPLY THIS.
---
It's funny, everyone has the expensive ones yet the unique one of the bunch is the cheapest one. 
---
&gt; [...] any one can contest those timers.
---
Yet neither of your two examples was contested by a true third party, but only by bordering entities.
---
To be competitive u have to stay all day at Jita undock and shoot flashy red gankers for green killboard ... at least that I saw PL doing lately and they are elite.
---
Would that 700B rig ever drop?
---
WHY AM I NEVER PLAYING WHEN SHIT LIKE THAT HAPPENS.
---
Welcome to the dark side ... aaa ... I mean EvE endgame!
---
Because it was in Fountain, INIT's region (sort of).  
---
This wouldn't happen with INIT. at home and unoccupied because INIT would mobilize to save them.
---
Honestly, the amount of times we save BASTION people doing dumb shit in Fountain is insanely high.
---
While we're gone those fucks are in trouble and better break their bad habits quickly or expect more of this.
---

---
But I don’t even know so how can I tell you?
---
heh, i guess i just consider ganking to be pve as you really aren't risking anything.  99% of the time you know the outcome when you start the gank, kinda like pve. 
---
Is it not still a pretty fucked game mechanic though?
---
I don't aim for bots, it's pointless. I'd rather run around and kill MTUs or something equally mind numbing as sitting in a system till I get whitelisted to kill a VNI if I get lucky. I look for active fights.
---
But there is also more than one bot. Just because someone learned the bugs of one doesn't mean it fixes the problem at large. 
---
Can this be done solo in a catalyst. And if possible can you supply fits?
---
Dude it’s not us it’s BloodRaiders
---
An ESS stealing 20-25% of your bounties and killing any spodbrain who tries to loot or remove it seems like a "macroeconomic consequence" to me.
---
Maybe the NPCs aren’t immune to bubbles?
---
Not in hk you pleb, sucks to be you with the daily commissar beatings and the forced koolaid injections. 
---
Someone help... what does the check mark mean?
---
you make hype videos for taking gates?
---
christ, you'd think you've never done it before 
---
You ever see how all those NPCs instawarp? INPUT BROADCASTING! #BanBloodraiders
---
a salt mine for sure
---
I think he screwed up and got caught with his pants around his ankles.
---
Except you can kill the NPCs if you have titan superiority so in actuality it's just a few people dying in random ships until they realize what's going on.

---
Which part? The rats camp npc nullsec stations all the time, people die to them all the time. The only difference is that we've anchored a bubble on the undock and the players in the station need to shoot it (but they're afraid to lose anything).  
---
Players anchor bubbles and inhibs in ratting sites all the time, rats don't shoot those.  
---
There is a way to avoid bubbles - it's called lowsec, maybe that's better if they can't handle some rats and a bubble.
---
Reading comprehension is likely not in your skillset, if it took you 5 days to come up with an answer to a question no one asked :)
---
Not to mention, you're quite fond of not answering questions yourself, preferring deflection and something which seems to be very much like denial, unless your point is to not actually make any point or contribute anything to a discussion about complaining about CCP, except complaining about the discussion about complaining about CCP.
---
But if you get off on pretending to make your cute little "witty" and "intelligent" posts, sure, be my guest :)
---
The thing about Eve is that you really do have to set your own goals and achieve them. 
---
If you want to be competitive, getting into PvP is a good option. Going for anything control or numbers related is a good option as well, because you can say “we owned this many systems” or “we produced this many capital ships”, etc.
---
And when you beat your goal, set another. Join a corp that had goals and is working toward them as well.
---
So am I the only one who saw the check mark on skillu while the rest had question marks?
---
Dont forget pgl so he can start a 5 page rant about supers and caps again.
---
Okay okay, I still love you, it's alright.  
---
They said they already replaced it.
---
What are the capabilities of these two fits. And thanks for posting them I never actually thought of looking up zkill for fits 
---
&gt;I think he screwed up
---
so accidentally broken the rules, which in general doesn't have nearly as harsh the consequences of intentionally doing it.
---
it takes 5 minutes to online t2 large bubbles
---
delet this
---
It could work, but with completely different intentions and realisation of pve.
---
Only if  players and CCP would agree to say that players who do pve are sitting ducks for hunters, with massive nerf to safety of pve. 
---
Basicly paid actors pretending to be prey. 
---
Why?  It makes no sense to allow rmt in pve sandbox as personal wealth is main and only goal, but in pvp-first game?
---
Can you imagine players farming for hours in online shooter? Perhaps in MOBA?
---
It would make no sense.
---
If pve in eve would not allow such easy resource and isk aquisition, if player would be actually exposed and vulnarable and would have to actually be at risk while doing pve, rmt wouldn't change much in game. It would likely increase player numbers significantly even, more stuff to hunt - more active people looking for fun. 
---
System would regulate itself easily.
---
BUT people who rmt would likely hate such pack of changes, after all they would actually had to play the game.  Same goes for krabs in safespaces, filthy peveper's would get to kill them once in a while!
---
Assuming implications
---
When I came back to the game after a long break, I spent some time doing solo stuff. Market trading and regional trading were my main interests, but if you want to pull in some good ISK and you’re okay with running with a group, Incursions are great as well.
---
Even after growing my Corp, I still do incursions for ISK. 70-90 mil per hour in high-sec. isn’t bad.

That said, if you’d like a laid back place to chill for a while, Lockheart Trading Company welcomes returning players! We’re pretty friendly, and we’re very “RL first”.
---
The problem is that if a goal doesn't seem realistic, that should be found out before it goes live. There's a test server and everything, after all. Aside from that, if something is found to not be realistic, one should take a look at rethinking the rest of it. As is we've gotten a lot of "drifters are a super serious threat" via lore and nothing going on ingame. Like i said, it's been 4 years. If nothing was possible to make function over those 4 years that befit their role, why is the lore coming out now still trying to hype them up?
---
I never aimed to take shots at individuals working at CCP, i'm sure they have qualified people. But as a company and me being their customer, i don't think it's unfair to look at what they've been putting out as part of their product and judging it essentially some fluff over nothing.
---
Yes, you are being punished. 
---
You're having a loss added to your statistics.

Taking a way an illegitimate win does not require a loss to be added to your statistics.

Very cool map, any others you have like this?

I hope more of this.

t2 fit might solo softer targets. Take about 2 t1 fits or so for heavier targets like retriever. These kill mails will give you an idea of how they are used. remember zkill is your friend. https://zkillboard.com/kill/75259538/ , https://zkillboard.com/kill/75258892/ ,  https://zkillboard.com/kill/75257877/ , https://zkillboard.com/kill/75253583/ . Steer clear from Proc and Skiffs, usually too much tank on those
---
2 seconds to actually launch/anchor one.
---
Not gonna lie, Paragon Soul will be a grind :(
---
provided you are 5km off the station 
---
Seriously... Of all the types of botting to go after, you go for this? Lame. 
---
I got a little frustrated with the pinhead but I could still see someone buying PLEX to sell for isk just so they could complete the challenges and get some rare skin.  I could also see someone doing the same thing to get a chance at an A-type EANM from one of the boxes.  This event would be 100x better if they #1 removed the ISK purchase price and #2 made minerals 10x smaller or reprocessing into 10x more minerals.  Just my two cents.
---
Thanks for the tips, friend! I'll bear that in mind. What sorts of ships do HS incursions require?
---
I have said neither. What's your point?
---
It would actually be pretty funny to just move everything into Delve for a day and make everyone feel emotionally confused.  
---
Then we all hop into Goon comms and ask them for hugs.
---
Oh yeah Aridia borders Fountain as well.
---
A single t2 cat should be able to get ret/cov no issues. Mach/hulk have to be very weakly tanked to solo gank. 2 should crack any of the four up to .7 space.
---
Yeah, I mostly didn't realize the different camera modes were even allowed in abyssal sites. I did find that adding and removing the zoom buttons fixes the problem, inside that single room, but just using the hotkeys to switch is way easier.

Eve needs a random system generator that creates one new system every day for eternity.  Eve should be constantly expanding. 
---
with goons in venal and init in hakonen....
---
mmm i smell an expiring GOTG NIP
---
Situational awareness is good for not being ganked. If you're just mining, that means an eye on local for known gank groups, an eye on the grid/dscan for suspicious ships that pose a threat. If you're jumping around, that means having a scout ship or some form of advance intel, awareness of grid, and stuff like webbers for large ships like freighters.
---
If you're in a gank, maximum tank is the only thing that will save you with any guarantee. DPS is only good for whoring on killmails; ECM is not distributable (due to burst jammers needing red safety), no longer defensive, and RNG dependent; logi is useless unless massed in proportion. Tanking is the only thing that will save you. This is one of the few cases where double-tanking (hull/shield for ORE ships for example) is not only valid but optimal.
---
There are certain thresholds. For example, on trade hub undocks, having 12k ehp with no major holes is usually sufficient to prevent being alpha'd by a Tornado. If in a mining barge, 24k+ ehp is ideal for surviving the 3-catalyst gank meta.
---
On trade hub undocks, The EVE Uni recommends limiting your cargo to below 3000 isk per 1 EHP you have. You should also consider the price of any modules you have fitted in this count.

Boomer comment
---
Gank fits are easy, maximise the damage per ISK - maximum damage mods in lows, guns in highs, damage rigs. Catalysts are the typical ship for it.
---
For high sec blitzing level 4s and burners is ~200mil/hr. Burners also have a chance to drop faction stuff which is worth a lot. My biggest drop was 800mil. 
---
There's more than half a dozen NPC stations in Delve, just move shit around.
---
Or, kill the bubbles when they're not looking.
---
If they're camping you 24/7, perhaps things are working as intended.

I no longer fly that fit, I had 3 Hypers because I was living in null at the time and forced to roam out 10 jumps to see anything, I use this fit now:

A little more balanced, and the long web is cheap and super worthwhile.
---
excavator drone parts. 
---
It was hilarious and then you showed up to abloo bloo bloo and ice that delicious cake with your sweet tears.
---
10-/10 would laugh at risk averse childish whining hatemongers again
---
Rokh is kinda terrible, it lacks mid slots for a strong tank and has absolutely terrible cap. However, it is useable and engageable so you can make it work.
---
 Kudos for the clip very well made, i dont even care if you drop on us...upvoted 
---
Well thanks boys I got to whore on a titan on my main, my dread alt isn't getting all the fun alone now.
---
Let me get this straight. You are telling me that you have the power to shut down a bot, forcing it to dock up merely by being in the same solar system and instead of putting an alt there you are lecturing me on the efficacy of the CSM? 
---
You are a fucking moron. 
---
since they are Imperium butt boys they are only going where they are told to go...
---
I'd love one day for all coalitions/alliance to just all cram into Tama and fight to the last ship.. kind of put any and all ships and you just burn them to the end Battle Royale style.
---
Just for the meme and YouTube videos alone.
---
ochre first 
---
Looks like a sig deployment to me. As a thought try hellmarch.
---
Posts like this are why /r/eve hates INIT...
---
Angry "grr mod" meme aside I seriously have no idea what this means:
---
&gt; It was already on track to match my others in the hundreds.
---
Do you mean karma or something? Say it ain't so.
---
Couldn't you aggro the rats to get them to move out of the bubble and warp off, then come back to kill the bubble in peace?
---
Why dont people like to solo anymore? It seems everything is bait and blob, how do you overcome this? Even fw is riddled with it even though people will try to tell you otherwise.
---
Highsec incursion about 150million per hour. 
---
unless the plex was acquired at a significant discount like through the galaxy pack.
---
How? Only bomber needed? 
---
You would not say that in AUTZ
---
do you have a permit for ganking?
---
Fight us, maybe?
---
No problem. Go get blown up :)
---
Finkle = Einhorn
---
I highly doubt it as that would require work on his part as well all of ccp changing/adapting the game.
---
Ty
---
Flair baited
---
Yeah but at the same time deep null was deep. You don’t have that now.
---
I was referring to LSH
---
i'm too noob to understand who is fighting who and why. or maybe i just dont care about eve's diplomacy
---
But... killboards matter
---
...until i leave system for 5 minutes
---
Me and a friend tried nabbing bots before the warped to a POS, he had a sabre we made a log off trap amd it didnt work because they wapred the moment you appeared in local which is before you even load in
---
This retardation is the most important strength of Goons. No matter how many trillions you lost to me in terms of stolen stuff and killed stuff, you can claim I am salty about all that activity and announce your victory with a straight face, actually believing in it.
---
When I say screwed up I mean he was in the middle of using it maliciously and forgot to turn it off before taunting the people in local. So no not an accident.
---
If you can get &gt;600DPS in a catalyst, that should do in most Retrievers and Covetors in 0.5 systems. Doable with T2 guns and damage mods, some half decent gunnery skills and overheating.
---
Anything tankier than those will probably require multiple catalysts, or something bigger/more expensive.
---
\*Blinks Slowly\*
---
Don't leave the system. 
---
The Joke\~
---
So.. what exactly.. do you do here?  
---
I TOLD YOU, I'M A PEOPLE PERSON, I'M GOOD WITH PEOPLE, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
---
Counter escalate. And who are all these people you speak of. Are you speaking for all Eve players? And really it depends on who and where. I'm sure plenty of people enjoy solo but let's not act like there has been some sudden shift. The bait and switch is a tactic far older than Eve.
---
TIFO, to can clean your ships, also they get dirty, the more you know 
---
I like that this was a learning experience for you. Chuckled a bit when i looked at the ship and went 'ah well thats just dirty', then scrolled down to the comments....
---
I should turn all my sp farms into bomber alts to sit in every system in null no more botting mmmmk
---
That's great if you don't want to actually play the game on your character. The only solution is to cloak camp them with multiple accounts. 
---
;-)
---
Nopeee. 
---
* Presses f1
---
Then I'm not playing the game either smoothbrain because I'm wasting an account on a system when that's CCP's problem.
---
Look at cloaky-camping contracts to consider the value/cost of consistent cloaky camping.
---
That's not even considering that for many botting groups 1-2 cloaky campers mean nothing because they have systems they can rotate between. You either need to do the whole kibosh or nothing at all.
---
Only 4 stations has good range for dreads. And they can camp all 4, because all it takes is one side alt watching us. No, it's not working as intended. I wouldn't be saying anything if they hellcamped us with an equal or greater force, or had to be at the keyboard with titans etc. NPCs are a huge force multiplier for the camping side. 1 dude's 2 second effort shouldn't force me to have to log in 10 dudes for a booshraven fleet or slippery pete fleet. Just to have him drop another bubble.
---
Subcap activity is not a problem for me. If they could stop it by camping my station, they would have done so months ago.
---
We are dealing with an alliance of 40k people 
---
I really like when people teach me my expertise. 
---
Empire jubilee is best
---
if you sub with cash then exploration can make you lots of money, especially in other people's space. there's risk and reward etc; start out in cheap t1 explo frigate in wormholes, then maybe move on to something like an astero and target guristas or sansha space. it's how i started out, and look at me now, i'm a dorkhead loser
---
Youll go do same boring ass content fight and shoot citadelss all day in blob fleets. Then go home. 
---
I agree. I don't get why people actively playing the game don't want to spend their time sitting in a botter's system to prevent them from afk farming.
---
i play since february 4 and i made 400millions until now in wormholes, which if you think about it, it's quite good because i could actually plex my account every month, i started to make money in wormholes since day 7. it may sound poor and it is, but wormhole life if you want to plex your account is enough. i will soon move to trading and pve though, wormhole life takes a little too much time
---
So your logic is that the only way to solve the problem is to go all in or do nothing at all. Nothing at all while bloviating on reddit about how bad the problem is. The problem you don't want to do anything about. 
---
If there are no goons there, what precisely is your problem? Grab a battleship and blap the bubble before you start to do the things. Force them to dedicate more people and effort to stopping you than it's worth until they give up.
---
If your issue is diamond rats shooting you, there are solutions for that as well.
---
From a fcore fc to you. The winter is coming for fountain
---
All it takes is another ship undocking from the station for a reset. Bubble works as an agression. Pulls in more creeps.
---
I am looking forward to The coming weeks
---
Personal assets, right click desired station, option your looking for should be in that menu, use no questions stupid thread next time.
---
Yeah, it's no different from spending their time going AFK in any other system.  Maybe CCP should teleport Dev characters to every single local system in the game at a random time at a random interval. Causing massive bot logouts/dock ups. 
---
Alright, I've been on the fence, but I think it's finally time for me to dive into this stuff. This sounds like too much fun.
---
You guys have failed to make a dent in the botting problem with all of the tools that alliance leaders don't have access to.  How is it "simple really" for them to do it?  Snarky BS.
---
Obviously Etherium Reach.
---
That Test Sig gonna need backup against our super massive 50 ish alt army dudes.
---
Theres a Reddit bot that does this haha idk where it is now 
---
Odins call joined Imperium apparently
---
LOL! Ur so screwed! 
---
Bastion getting in touch with their Li3 roots by feeding FCore easy kills.
---
Wait ... people still use NPC stations in nulsec?
---
bomber with slight bling can bliz about 60% of l4 FW missions, and there's about a dozen FW l4 agent that you can do cherry picking with one free reject per day. You just need to arrange your mission picking route properly and run a travel ceptor to accept all mission you can run, then get on your bomber and do them all. With good planning + good diplo skill (Security Connections V) + t4/t5 FW status + some luck you can even land about avg 300M per hr in LPs, but of course that need some setup (Faction rep 5.0) and you need to know how to avoid being hunted.
---
^someone who never heard about hakonen, 6RCQ or any other deployment made by the imperium
---
Except you are.  By threatening action against alliances whose renters are unknowingly botting, you ARE expecting them to police the game or risk action against them.  Also posting extreme attitude on every response on the subject doesn't help.
---
Stainguy is never getting his gate.
---
So elite.. remember, only fight ships not made to fight back or have any form of defense. Be the school bully you always wanted to be... the gloat like you are some sort of bad-ass when in reality you're just a piece of shit with no value.
---
Let me get this straight. You are telling me you don't understand that bots (or anyone ratting for that matter) dock when non-blues enter the system and you're trying to claim to be an efficiency CSM?
---
**REALLY?**
---
Holy hell. 
---
I'd suggest an anchored bubble on the pos if they keep doing the same thing, start onlining it and logoff, wait until it's online, log back in and they'll be caught in it
---
In welcher Corp bist und wie ist die ausgelegt? 
---
hahaha
---
Still being paid for, and can only get one Galaxy pack per character/account
---
Get a new job!
---
11/10 music choice
---
Which is why you anchor a bubble in their site, stupid bots will get stuck, smarter bots won't rat, win-win.
---
Isn't that what reddit is about? Letting the people decide if something is good enough to show up on the home page? 
---
If you think I violated a rule on this sub just say that instead of going all nuts. Cause as far as I'm concerned, I didn't 
---
Tldr?
---
Worth the fuel for the lolz.
---
nah was really recently
---
Eventually down the road maybe. But right now it's about the best I can get in my area, without a degree. And the fact that I can at least browse reddit and listen to podcasts without any complaining is nice. 
---
That and it doesn't involve a stupid amount of manual labor.
---
PL does that... it's just they drop alliance first.
---
Shut up and take my isk.
---
qq goons are using mechanics that everyone else does qq qq wahhhhhh time to play minecraft!!!
---
&gt; 14 year
---
Oh god I was so disappointed at seeing it was Feb 2005 that I didn't even do the math on the date. 
---
Good, Bastion needs some exercise.  
---
I have a dream that INIT. will get to be a strong independent alliance that doesn't ~~need no man~~ always have to bring their fat little brother on every deployment so maybe Goons can stick around fountain and get some content out of you.  
---
I think his point is, it's not the players job to plant cloaky campers everywhere to stamp out the bottling activity. Hunters are probably more than happy to cloaky camp for a short time to actually secure a kill which would make it worthwhile for their time. If the bots are set to just stay docked while neuts are in system, there's no real reward for the hunters in just sitting there. I think that's the general vibe. 
---
wait so he doesn't know they spawn on NPC stations if your standings are low enough and he's blaming goons for rigging the game against him? How tightly is the tinfoil wrapped around his head?
---
&gt;Goons calling anyone pubbies in 2019
