I have a question about the standing drama ...
---

---
i have negative standing too amarr.
---
Can I still join a corp fighting in the fw for amar?
---
It's not all blobs: [https://zkillboard.com/related/30002980/201902100800/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002980/201902100800/)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In fact the Amarr can't even organize a "blob" right now. Pretty good fun can be had in FW, and the ISK isn't too bad either.   
---
The best thing about FW right now O-plexing a novice earns about 45 million ISK. You can do that in a T1 frigate worth 10 million. May be the best ROI ingame.  
---
what brain lmao 
---
Well i still consider wallet warrioring a bad thing. So get out of here wallet warrior.
---
Yo dog I heard you like spreadsheet so I made some spreadsheets about my spreadsheets so I can spreadsheet while I spreadsheet.
---
I don't really think it's tears? I am just saying BB is better than letting a proven cheater be leading their fleets
---
When you're spreadsheeding a spreadsheet game right from the start you just KNOW you'll fit right in.
---
To actually throw an important point:
---
Both EVE and 40K are actually really hard to quantify in terms of capabilities, but for different reasons. In EVE we don't get a lot of "feats" that can be analyzed for hard data regarding certain capabilities (the closest we get is warp speeds and then just mathing out the number of AUs in a lightyear to figure out the amount of time to cover x lightyears, for example), and it can theoretically be argued that the weapons ranges presented in game are an artifice of game mechanics.
---
40K in some ways has the opposite problem; it has *so many* 'feats' that are available for analysis, that the range of capability described is basically all over the place. On one hand you have multi-gigaton torpedoes and teraton level barrages between capital ships, millions upon millions of worlds and ships, and on the other.... you have a 700 meter Cobra escort being a nearly irreplaceable relic, ships which can barely sling kiloton/megaton range firepower beyond a few dozen kilometers and the enormous headscratching dichotomy of "Thunderbolt aerial fighters are also used in space?!" (Thunderbolts are a bit smaller than most modern warplanes of similar tasking, IE multirole strike/air superiority) and "Fury interceptors are the premier/only anti-strikecraft space platform used by the Imperial Navy" (Furies often being depicted as anywhere from 30-60 meters in length; IE something the size of a jetliner, rather than an F-16).
---
*Probably* the Imperium would end up taking it since it's generally consistent in having many hundreds of thousands to millions of worlds to call upon for industry and manpower, and that scale of territory is not something which is remotely practical to invade and seize for the main empires of EVE (or the capsuleers for that matter). It's a scale problem more than anything else; there's just not enough hardware and manpower on the EVE side to actually conquer and occupy (since xenocide isn't something the EVE side generally goes in for... the Imperium OTOH.......).
---
Hat. 
---
The clan scene in D2 wasnt that big, we all knew each other because the only real things clans did was either pvp, Character rushes, item hunting or leveling services. Word travels fast.
---
Because input broadcasting isn't full banned, proof of input broadcasting itself would not be proof of cheating. 
---
Now CCP could have pulled the character logs and realized he is not input broadcasting, and you would still be here screaming or they could have done nothing ( now I consider it more likely that CCP looked into this given the close relation between GSF and CCP ). 
---
Why is there this obligation on BB to take some moral high ground? 
---
I mean the position here could very well mirror your own, it's not BB's job to police the game for cheaters that's CCPs job. 
---
Ok
---
That's also not totally accurate.
---
You could convert a 60 day ETC into two PLEX which could then be sold for Isk.  That was originally how the whole buying Isk with cash worked.  It wasn't a replacement as much as it was a conversation.
---
Alternatively, you could just apply the ETC to your account to sub for 60 days.
---
I have played eve for 9 years an i did only Pay for game time first 2 years after That i have ever miss isk an i lose quit a few ship each month in pvp 2/5bil ships blowing up
---
Go scanning go thanatos nyx rating if you can Pay for your acount if you most but only farm for New ship not for game time. 
---
When you have it All ships an stuff every time you make someting That in to your wallet not to Pay for ships anymore easy isk is scanning an vom at site in 00 space..
---
Scanning can easy generate 2 bil isk a Day nyx 100 mil tick =20min thanatos 45_60mil=20min an jita trade you Will be need to start at 5-8B to start but up after few days you can sell out with ok profit i do around 5b aweek from trade too..
---
Download evenus trade tool an uE The tools to keep track of your trade.. 
---
Won't defend any inaccuracies but do keep in mind it's about a years worth of EVE history in one take. I went on what information I could find/recall. As a whole, I stand by it but do acknowledge that I don't have perfect knowledge or recollection of events so there may be some elements which are not accurate to history. 
---
And yet, here you are with a goon flair, of all things.
---
You're just reinforcing my statement.
---
Can I ask 
---
did you know that you can be a goon and hate input broadcasting and botting
---
crazy idea, I know
---
AT FANFEST
---
LMFAO! Accurate.
---
Is that on top of what the alliance pays FCs?
---
ha ha great solution. When a game is so boring you'd rather mow someones lawn 
---
Is this fucking coalition still existing holy shit. Kill it already. 
---
I know right? Give up luxeries like movies or coffee to avoid playing the damn game.
---
&gt;EVE is also the only game that gets a pass when it comes to IRL money being relevant in-game. Because that's the case, and players can just open up their wallet when they need ISK, there's no incentive for CCP to try and making farming ISK enjoyable.
---
uuhhh....  You can do the same thing in WoW, the so called mainstream MMOROPG.  Eve is not special in that regard.
---
OP is talking about PLEXing his accounts.  Removing the time/isk requirement of subbing one or more accounts definitely makes PvP more sustainable.  Doing both requires more time invested into PvE though.
---
Doesn't excuse boring gameplay. 
---
Or just get bot to mine for you AND work overtime :o)
---
Fucking Goons smugging about input broadcasting ayyy lmao
---
It's still too soon, first month will be a beta
---
That I do not know
---
I am beginning to think I am the only one who says just leave botters and input broadcasters alone. I still have faith that CCP will deal with em. 
---
He's in TEST. Esoteria is as stale as he claims the game is.

FW is trash.  Join a wh corp

I assure you, this neck beard is authentic good sir.

A Canadian Tire store in my hometown caught fire while I was there one day. Later on I got an email from eve because I had made accounts previously. Decided to give it another shot. After running through all the names I thought were interesting and getting frustrated by them all being taken, I got stoned and plugged in Canadian Fire. It went through.
---
Interesting. I was last in FW about this time last year, and things sound about the same. 
---
Can I ask what made you switch to WH? 
---
Listen to this at half speed.
---
He was never banned to begin with you dimwit, lol.
---
Uhhh, what? You do that to pay sub, not grind ISK for stuff in game. The objective of the game isn't the grind is for sub, so don't do it. 
---
You're telling me there's not a single old person around? 
---
Needed to do something new. I was also a bit of a nomad, living in various lowsec pockets for a couple months and moving around.
---
I came to the realization, that no matter where i go, there is always someone waiting to cyno drop on me. After losing 8-10 battleships (some back to back in completely different regions) i decided that my original playstyle wasn't as compatible in the current meta and needed to move to area's where the meta was more resistant to cynos/capitals. Which is wormhole space.
---
It functions somewhat similarly to FW, in that depending on the hole you live in, you can quickly find content holes and then roll the hole if the content is garbage. It takes a little longer and decent knowledge on WH mechanics, but overall its fun. Still not as great as the glory days of FW a few years ago, but its better than current FW imo.
---
Knock on doors and ask, especially in areas where you know older people live? 
---
Interesting, maybe I'll read up again on WH and give that a go instead. It's sounds like it's at least worth the look.
---
Thanks for that.
---
if people have to write comments in their code it means they've written shit code in the first place

---
There are more ways to make isk.
---
Dont forget to tip the fedora!
---
Only if the capital pilot try’s to save themselves.
---
I understand, but I do not agree with it. There needs to be some sort of payment to CCP at some point. 
---
The current business model of relying on multoboxing whales (regardless if they are used for botting or not) is super bad because a lot people are getting sick and tired of it to the point of being turned off from logging in and playing.
---
if they want sustain they need new players that will stay for a good amount of time and this goes counter to that though it does pad short term, the longer it persits the more it gets out of control and the more it destroys longterm.
---
But perhaps there are small things that can be done to compromise the situation where everyone takes a small impact instead of one or the other being completely wiped out.
---
Can I get some EYEBLEACH, over here?!?
---
It's the same thing. If you're going to work an extra hour each day to pay for your subscription, why on Earth would you mine for 8 hours to afford a ship to fly in?
---
Here is kinda the ironic thing it's long term unhealthy for the alliances but in a Tragedy of the commons, any alliance not playing by these rules but itself at a disadvantage. 
---
Now the rules have gotten so bad that some alliance's have gone screw the advantage I rather have fun, but most of these are not in a worse position because the picked fun over the advantage. 
---
Now the issue is one of player mentality yes, part of the reason for this is because blueballs on helldunk became not just accepted but the default strategy for any large alliance, the issue with it is the advantage it brings, namely any alliance that doesn't follow the doctrine will find itself only losing fights because their opponents sure as fuck will. 
---
The only real way it can be solved is if players and alliances see people play like it as bad and go make them homeless until they learn to not do that but the reality is there isn't a critical mass for that.
---
Pay money and inject until you can fly rorquals.

TLDR he has so much time mining unmolested that he can output a work of art and nom nom spod too

Space marine boarding actions would like to talk to you about their lord and saviour the emperor. Legit though any massive ship would likely be boarded and taken(standard space marine MO for that stuff) anything smaller would be torn apart by the more power imperium ships. Even if they were weaker sheer numbers fighting across such a small front would carry the day. 
---
The reinforcement timers would probably piss off the imperium though :p
---
It misplaced.

and then imagine actually losing to them

it'd be good if negative side of the scale had different colors with 0.5 decrements. only having red and orange makes it hard to distinguish who you are shooting this time

You must be a parent, because parents just don't understand.

Abyssal sites are nice as every run is a little different so it keeps you on your toes, and it can have pretty good payout.

I hate PvE, but I can multibox 3 accounts and make 1.5bil an hour running wormhole sites and only have to PvE an hour or two each week.

oh boy i cant wait to use his data to find out exactly who he is and camp him
---
Nullsec is Hello Kitty.
---
So despite black ops ambushing you and putting up a cyno jammer the rorqual still survived...and this is balanced because?
---
Because bots are built on the assumption local exists.
---
Remove local, and bots will just be updated to function without it. And they'll do it better than players, just like now.
---
I mean...I did last time in 2016. But anyway my point stands the defenders have overwhelming advantages now. In game mechanics that favor defenders way too much.
---
Shut up heretic
---
Yes the defender always gets the advantage. But now there are too many advantages. Alliance gates, citadels, mining platforms (to defend moon mining) new cyno jammers. All of these are tools that favor the defender...where as the attacker has gotten what?
---
&gt; the other one seems to have trouble with it.
---
I call you a retard because you think I have trouble with it. I told you it needs to be considered, not that it makes trouble.
---
But then think as you wish. Just don't say PI is passive, because that is just plainly wrong - it's only passive if you CHOOSE that doing 3*2*5 things that needs 2 s each is the same as 0s.
---
Real talk, I think to did not take the time to measure how long does PI actually often and you are just outrage because I don't agree with you, refusing to try to understand my point and making strawman fallacies because you can't accept to be wrong. 
---
Too bad you are. I DID measure the time it takes, the net gain at the end of the month. I DID talk with people about their total net worth at the end of the month what it needs for them to do so, some of them where making P4 from P2 in a WH they kept rolling, some had 10 toons just for PI, some had mixes. and for ALL of them, if was NOT a passive activity, it needed a LOT of presence to have correct amount of isk, it was an error-prone option when moving the stuff.
---
But yeah I did that as an experiment, for several years. I don't get what is your point, I play the game because I enjoy experimenting and getting numbers right.
---
You've got a great partner &lt;3
---
How? How are bots going to deal with local that doesn't tell them a hostile is in system?
---
His channel went back up about an hour ago with some videos being reuploaded, reason I’m posting it because his vids helped me back in 2012 when I was a newbie. Its good to see him back! :)
---
&gt;Let's ban him for mistakenly leaving a program on, which he is legally using
---
olmeca if you stopped there you could've had a sane, rational post
---
&gt;used by some Goons all the time.
---
some goons along with some members of most other large nullsec alliances who, as it turns out, aren't completely innocent. you can seem much less like you're just salty over 1 alliance if you point out all the other alliances along with goons
---
Input is allowed for login and a couple other things, so it's possible his settings were fucked after using it to log in and accidentally broadcasted a message. 1 case of isboxer broadcasting his chat doesn't necessarily mean he's done something bannable.
---
I don't get what this is supposed to mean, so I guess it means nothing. Have a nice day sir ! Do whatever you want with your homeless, but remember, hygiene is very important ! Always brush your teeth !
---
Honestly I dont think the game is worth coming back. CCP are basically operating with a skeleton crew relative to this size of the game and new features are generally geared towards short sited monetary endeavors aimed at the lowest common denominators.
---
I didn't mean to say that no PVP in Eve is "meaningful," but that less of it is than it used to be. Most losses hurt less than they used to, infrastructure is on the whole more secure than it has ever been, logistics is easier than ever, etc. And it's not like "you roll someone out of a region" on any sort of regular basis... and even if you were, part of what I was talking about was that players have to create their own incentives, and while that isn't a bad thing to see happening, it HAVING to happen in order to add meaning/an objective to PVP is not, imo, ideal.
---
&gt;someone broadcasted something in chat once so why is this group not going for a moral high ground
---
if i had the same levels of mental retardation as you i could ask why ~~wizard hat~~ goon flair is wondering why people want to be associated with bad man
---
BRAVE FTW. Biased AF
---
FC what
---
My point is, why tax more if it's equally safe in 0.5 and 1.0 ?
---
&gt; I was a raid leader in world of warcraft. It was a very similar thankless job that made you a target. It's just miserable and unfun trying to herd everyone around.
---
as someone who did both and did wow for quite a while I can say that being a RL is 100x better, the amount of retardation people do in fleets is astonishing compared to a non-retarded raid. You'd think its impossible to fuck up like 3 possible actions, and those mongs still manage to do so.
---
Yeah that's got to be a bug
---
They're reuploads..., but yeah, I'm reloading some of my old videos that are still relevant.

I was in calmil, the problem with the logistics never was the price, hell people would have bought if the markup was 100% tbh, it was just that nobody wanted to do it.

People lie on the internet
---
I'm curious, why did you choose to delete them in the first place? 
---
Mine is pretty obvious. I think my girlfriend's name was better. Her's is Fresha Vocado.
---
I dunno this doesn’t add up .. unless you do this for all games you start to play I smell a bias .. you’re testing the adoption cycles of a game because ???? Why eve and moreover what knowledge are you walking into this case study with prior ..
---
Sniff .. something isn’t right .. despite my own body odor which women describe as pungent musk 🤔🧐😏😚
---
I had no idea. Is there a place to look up which faction requires which skill? 
---
At least in wow if people don't like your RLing they just leave they don't get to also kill you.
---
Legacy is TEST. So....
---
Ignore these guys, your best option is to find a Corp, either see if your old one is still alive, or look around for a new one. Your stuff is probably all in asset safety right now, so you shouldn’t have much of a problem moving it, wherever you end up going 
---
Why was it deleted? Does space violence violate YouTube's rules somehow?
---
What recruitment ad?
---
And when have I told you how to play?
---
I'm literally quoting Fresh Prince's song "Parents just don't understand"
---
Is there a certain day when PI materials shift positions on planets? Do some move and some don't? 
---
Your alliance lead tried to start a suicide campaign against some poor guy on the fucking internet, so let's not sling mud about following someone blatantly against EULA. I wasn't going to say shit this time, but this particular comment is so hypocritical that it made me stop for a moment
---
The "Johnny Morale"campaign worked
---
Technically it’s a series of frames per second combined with server proc processing .. so he could be correct in saying that at the tail end of the second down to the micro level the said instruction would have been queued for dispatch but got fucked over due to the game loop (16ms frame) missing the queue append.. so it snapped to the next batch for outbound tick instead 🥺
---
So all in all a server tick was the final judgment but the micro seconds leading up to the tick count .
---
"Boring" is a personal opinion.  There are quite literally hundreds of thousands of people who have enjoyed the various PvE game mechanics that PvP-centric players routinely pan.
---
Legitimate criticisms can be made about many mechanics in EVE.  The PvE criticisms by PvP players are rarely that, mostly it's whining that they didn't respawn in a few seconds fully equipped and ready to immediately do something stimulating.
---
DARK calling literally anyone else in this videogame "bad" in tyool 2019 is a bit rich

Fortunately for you, Rykki's Guide (now Karr's) has data on Ore site spawns, and composition. 
---
And yes, the composition of a gas/ore site is independent of the class of wormhole (although wormhole class does determine which sites can spawn)
---

---
It _probably_ was related the the Id of citadels vs stations. Stations are all relatively low I'd numbers. Like in the 3 million or so range. Or 300k. Something like that. Citadels are up in the billions. So a variable which can handle a station id may not handle a  citadel id. 
---
And at the time, the forum login code paid some attention to where you were. So it would retrieve the id, try to stuff it in the variable for storage, and the code would break.
---
Awesome, thanks for this. I saw this Google Doc earlier and couldn't find it... :P
---
Good to know that the site is the same regardless of what class hole it spawns in. Ty!

Now this is a confusing meme

noone really cares what corp you are in most of the time aslong as you arent acting like an arse
---
There was a bug in the early days I heard about where anything your ship touched stuck to you for the rest of your session. So people would go flying around asteroid belts collecting bunches of rocks that would stick to the ship, then warping around with them.
---
To much isk?  Send some my way then .  
---
Because its much safer. In the grand scheme of things times such as the perimeter battles are rare. 
---
During most of the times and on average, players who live in outskirts in 0.6 and 0.5 still often have to carry their goods or materials to and from the main markets exposing themselves to various hazards that you can lookup on the killboards thus easily verifiable. 
---
Players who live in 0.9 and 1.0 have much less risk. 
---
Haha good to know, thanks. I usually keep quiet and to myself so that shouldn't be a problem lol
---
Awesome, that's what I'm after.
---
Well, Test is having goons come help them in perimeter. So, the joke is this makes goons test pets now 
---
Made my day if true, Johnny is a good dude.
---
Please fix your narative regarding DeadCo and Horde... Its embarrassing that you try to pass it off as facts
---
Almost 75% of the fights I have ever been apart of in eve was over a legacy R32 or R64. Or the invasion of an entire region which led to an extend war because the fountain got a huge amount of the R64's when they were introduced. 
---
A whole 3 billion in losses? Looks like PH might as well shut it's doors for good after this one.
---
There’s a difference between being a pet and begging for help
---
Ex: every northern tapi campaign - somehow, someway goons are there to while tapi is the meatshield
---
Just remember when the dinos put a fortizar up in 4-07MU in catch on the querious regional and goons raged immediately. Then a week later goons dread bombed and killed 2 rags and a couple of hels

Yeah man, fuck TEST for bringing allies to perimeter.
---
Good thing horde is 100% independent and doesnt bring their allies to perimeter. I envy horde TBH. Never relying on their so called "allies". Throwing back the invasion of TEST just by themselves.
---
Horde is what every alliance should aspire to be.
---
"He who controls the spod controls the universe."
---
Allies need to be blue to be called allies 😂
---
my problem is that they reversed the colors, so now everything looks like it's logged in and it's fucking confusing

I also haven't heard about it, but if you look at the actual graph, thats what it appears to me.

---
Nobody uses d-scan blockers offensively and everyone consider that module as a failure in the game. It hardly merits mention. Cyno inhibs can be used by both sides. Not sure what "one of the easiest sov systems to break in eve history" has anything to do with anything.  
---
  
---
Can the gates be shut down by attackers? How much EHP does it have?
---
YES!!
---
So glad you are back! 
---
So glad he is back!
---
I glossed over the corp HQ thing. Does that work?
---
I feel that being able to change clones is not really such a big deal that it should be exclusive to locals. Seems like more of a convenience than something strategically important.
---
While NC. has been helping out Horde in Perimeter, why don’t TEST call their own coalition. You know, instead of the guys they’re «not blue to»
---
I like the narrative better than your truth. I'm going to ignore your *facts*. 
---
Are you taking actual eve players or are you including the NPC empires as well?

I remember reading a thread about the NPC empires VS combined human player might and it seemed agreed upon that we would get our asses thoroughly handed to us.

I AM A SPACE PROPHET!!!! THE PEW IS BACK 
---
Then you are lost?
---
Regularly, from what I'm told.
---
When you jump through a gate and land on the other side, you have a 30 second cloak. A camp will only know you have landed by the gatefire (if they're paying attention) and by local. They cannot see you on dscan, and will not know what ship you're flying.
---
If you run into a camp on the other side, you have 3 options.
---
1. Burn back to the gate. You'll be 12km (give or take) away. If you're quick/they dont have a fast locker, you can jump back through the gate you just came. Watch out for somebody trying to bump you
---
2. If you can align &amp; warp faster than they can lock, you can warp off and escape
---
3. Stay and fight if the fight is favorable to you. Kick some ass if so
---
You have 30 seconds to make this decision, so stay calm and don't panic.
---
it depends on the corp, some have paps per month you have to do. Like a corp I used to be in had 6 a month to stay in the corp. For me I hate being on fleets for a few hours when I could be doing some solo pvp or trying out some exploration. 
---
We've already been through this. The same way players do in areas where there is no local.
---
Can I ask what FW is. Thanks in advance

If so, let them say so.

My husband sent this to me. I think he's trying to tell me something but it flew over my head.
---
Think the perimeter situation has little to do with the test/goon relationship and more to do with the North regularly feeding feroxes on a regular basis.
---
The perimeter shit is being farmed by alphas, that's how hard the north feed.

How to fight imperium jump gates:
---
Step 1) Invade Delve with a actual navy, not a band of friends. 
---
Step 2) Shoot jump gate till shield and armor hit 0. 
---
Step 3) High-Five each other on not being bad at this game.
---
If unable to reach step 3, repeat step 1. 
---
To reinforce (By stock numbers) you'll need to wear down 1.5m EHP. It can be done. Goons do it all the time to the north. Heres even a killboard of it. https://zkillboard.com/ship/35841/
---
to be fair doing it in T1 destroyers is some level of competent, and decently amusing.
---
one of the funnier BRs I've seen this month
---
so it's moving to it's natural price

While i agree with most of what you just said that most of eve would burn can you see capsulers standing down from that fight?. EvE players fight so dirty. I agree most empires would crumble under the Imperium. But eve players can replace pilots and ships faster than the Imperium can move their forces. Players can move entire fleets inside their ships and provide mobile cloning bays. Asuming both sides suddenly found themselves on a constested border it could take months for the imperium to react let alone redirect an enitre armada that way without risking its inner colonies. Eve players would have months to infiltrate and gather intel or spread propaganda to subvert local populations. The imperium has to many enemy's to let its guard down and attack a vastly more technologically advanced race of undying space ship captains who can pick and choose their target on a wim. It would be like walking through highsec blasting away miners at random as the enemy tries to keep up. You can compare the size of guns and ships all day. But even in the eve universe we see time and time again what a well motivated and intelligent group of players can do with so little. Imagine you are happy mining away for the emperor and suddenly a titan cynos in and aoe dds your entire operation or 100 dreads just apear and reduce a city to rubble not caring if they live or die. Just dread bomb tera if thats how you feel. It would be dirty a dirty violent war. Besides since eve has a smaller army it deploys first unless the emperor uses a command point and steals the Initiative. But who needs them anyway amirite.

If your code doesn't express your intent clearly without the use of comments, you're a bad engineer.
---
Wait you play the actual game an not just the spreadsheet dlc?
---
Just gonna leave this here.... https://youtu.be/uWCz3BBfmPE
---
Oh okay well then I guess we can just not use local then anyway since humans won't be affected by it either since bots and humans work the same way. All the crying by you krabs that getting rid of local would hurt pvers must be untrue.
---
this has nothing to do with hurting pve.
---
you're making the claim that suddenly botting would vanish if there were no local - which is false. botting wouldn't vanish at all. bots would get updated and carry on being used.
---
I don't really see how this is the games issue. Bring more people then. Fight our supers with yours. IDK. Just do it or shut up. 
---
Grab yourself a vindicator and come run some incursions. You'll make a shit tonne of isk while you figure out what you want to do.

Fleets are much larger, remember if 1% of people are completely brain dead retarded, afk or something else, that's still about 3 people per full fleet.

The auto targeting missiles and smart bombing for escalations videos were super helpful when I first started. Thanks for all your work.

god help me im so poor and krabbing is cancer and buying ships is a pain as a result

Whenever a new mirror on Sisi appears, all the skill injectors on all markets in the game are bought up by people abusing the seeded market to make tens of billions of isk. There probably isn't any skill injectors for anyone to give you. On Sisi they are used as a commodity to trade for supercarriers and titans and other things not seeded on the market.
---
You know highsec isn't safe right ? and concord isn't there to protect you and you can be killed at anytime by all those neutrals around you.
---
FW = Faction Warfare
---
You pick a side (Gallente vs Caldari/Amarr vs Minmatar) and fight the opposing militia in low-sec faction warfare complexes, where the size of the ship allowed in the site is limited (frigates in novice sites, up to destroyers in small, up to cruiser in medium, and anything in large). After contesting the system (each complex is worth 0.7%, getting a system to 100% makes it vulnerable) you can bash the ihub, and flip control of the system to your side, which locks the enemies out of any NPC stations in that system.
---
It's a feature that's been left behind and forgotten about, and is slowly dying. 
---
I'm in the same boat but luckily Ina good corp (with heavy PvP so that's a trial by fire there), I myself just bought/fitted out 5x crucifier's for weapon disruption so while my skills train up I can be ewar and make it so just about no ship can hit my corpmates, plus I usually sit around 80k's off and still in optimal range so I feel pretty safe
---
You sure they are bought up? Because you would think that the 0.01 isk buy orders for them would still be up in that case. Last time i logged in right after a fresh mirror and they were all gone. P sure they strip them out of the mirror.
---
Imagine getting seeded with freighters for a year and being so inactive that you never notice and then lose two keepstars to subcaps.

This battle was already fought and won, you can chestbeat and vote brigade on Reddit all you want, it's your consolation prize.

I used to track dread/carrier/JF jumps on the ingame notepad.  Then I started using them more and more and kept forgetting to update on every single jump.
---
Not everyone in nullsec is a nullbear btw. I pretty much exclusively pvp in this game, I'll do like 4-6 hours of isk making every 2-3 weeks. While wormholes are dying because of too much bearing. Fix your own problems first before throwing shade.
---
Fly something other than a t3c, no one want to fight a cap stable 1000dps tank. Roam in a vni or something, everyone will want to fight you.

Then I don't particularly care who wins, at least the fight itself is a win. Game gets boring if people never contest stuff.

I suspect it's still bullshit, but billboards being in the game first actually makes more sense if some core code in them was used as a dependency for POSes.

So if it is being slowly forgotten about and left behind would you suggest, me being a novice, doing some research and getting into WH? I honestly don't know what I'm doing but I have fun doing it... If you know what I mean

Have you undocked recently? You can go to a backwater NS system no one's been to in a year and still find a dozen citadels, it's rediculous.

I always wondered why he vanished what happen to his channel in the first place to get it deleted ?
---
ALSO brilliant to have you back.
---
What you get rewards for those BS tracker achievements?
---
So you don't have an argument. Got it.
---
Never said it would vanish. I said it would be severely weakened. And as proof we see this happen when local dies. Now yes bots can "spam d-scan" now and warp to a citadel when they see something. But that'll be tedious with friendlies flying through. It limits botting effectiveness. And you simply saying "NU HU NU HU" doesn't hold up to the evidence.
---
Reading code is often harder than writing code. It takes 20 seconds to jot down what your stupid thing is supposed to do and will save so much time down the line when some unlucky son of a bitch is sifting through a legacy code base while trying to decipher what your elegant trash pile is supposed to be doing. 
---
Time, budget, experience ext. all are factors as to why people don't have a excess of time to ponder the structure of their haiku of a function.

Comment your code you fucking dweeb.

You complain about the defenders advantages. I give you the solution, and you say "lol CCP, we suck. Nerf Pls" 
---
Anywhere that is "target rich" remains that way because the people there have some capacity to prevent themselves from being farmed for content.  In the current meta that means supercap diarrhea, so get used to dipping out when the cyno goes up.
---
Keep in mind that by flying tech 3 cruisers you are severely limiting how many people will willingly engage you.  Most PvE ships can be killed with something much weaker, that looks more beatable to an ad-hoc response.  Assault frigates and tech one cruisers hit a sweet spot in terms of ability to kill targets and ability to attract fights.

P0-P4 is way more effort than P0-P2.
---
4 day cycles are for pi tryhards.
---
That's why you feel like PI is high effort.
---
P0-P2 on 5 planets in null got me 300m a month for 5 minutes of resetting extractors a week, 10 minutes picking up over 2 adjacent systems, hiring a hauling service to get it to market, and then setting sell orders. 
---
I've recently moved on to things that scale better,  but my first billions were almost exclusively PI.  Im sure it's worked out well for you since you are still playing, but you missed out on a couple of years of easy income because you didn't explore different approaches. You may have needed more than 5 minutes a day, needed to do things every day, and had trouble with hauling, but I did not.
---
I sooo like an argument about fictional wars between fictional factions! 
---
You can't talk about Imperium's enemies in this hypothetical scenario. Cause it's quite possible Orks, Chaos and Tyrannids would turn their attention to us the moment we entered the equation. New Eden would be as much a target as any other civilized corner of the Galaxy.
---
From the start you're talking about Eve fighting guerrilla warfare against the Imperium. Which makes sense, as Eve is the weaker party in the conflict. But Imperium has been fighting wars for millennia and uses a proved tactic against rebels and guerrillas: Scorched Earth, World Annihilation... EXTERMINATUS. Once they burn enough of our worlds, we won't be able to fight anymore. With a million planets at full industrial throttle, the Imperium won't blink at the loss of a hundred that they might have to leave uncovered.
---
Not that they would be uncovered at the first place. Each Imperium sector has its own Armada (Gothic Armada is the one for Gothic sector). So Imperium's reaction time would be really fast. Being at constant war from all sides, with enemies that can also use the Warp to attack any part of the Imperium at will has forced it's defenders to remain constantly deployed and at standby.
---
Propaganda? Infiltration? Ever heard of a little thing called the Inquisition? An army corps with its own funding and military branch, dedicated to counterintelligence and antipropaganda! Good luck trying to get through them to the Imperium's citizens!
---
Dreadbomb Terra? THE most fortified world in THE most fortified system in THE most fortified sector, with the Emperor of Man, one of the most powerful beings in existence close at hand? Yep, can definitely see how that would go. ATM no force in the W40K universe dreams of going near the place, and there are some very nasty things skulking around there... Demons, Necrons, Tyrannids... Not to mention that according to lore, even Iapetan Titans, the big brothers of our own Promethean Titans, are not capable of killing worlds (the exception might be the Gallente Soltueur Titan with its singularity projection weapon, tho it has never been used). Wherein any Imperium BS can conduct Exterminatus and sterilize a planet.
---
Yes, we capsuleers would take the fight, and yes we would cost the Imperium... a little. But we would assuredly lose and be totally wiped out, unless the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Inquisition decided capsuleer tech is not heretical to the Imperium's dogma, in which case they would indoctrinate us and you would have us fighting for them. Against all the other nasty stuff of W40K. Sounds promising!
---
Yes, but those kind of drifters i think are defending the drifter WH (those Unknown WH showing around New Eden)
---
I think the Minmatar is sort of complete, but it's more of a big base of operations and "barracks" for the Minmatar military, than a first line combat ship.
---
What would be reused really :P? Also they've since completely changed billboards twice without issue. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** mark5771! ^(hug)
---
I can understand them, who wants to take out 5-10 people fleets to be dropped on by carriers or 20-50 fleets on a regular basis? Its like running with your head into a wall.
---
Yes, this one.
---
For super chill play, sub your main account, rest can do whatever. Then you don't have to worry about plexing so much.
---
If you are going to focus on just relaxed play, pick an out of the way, not a pipeline 0.6 or 0.5 system to settle in, move a few ships there. Stay away from the most popular mission hubs, you'll lose ships. You can do some missions, run epic arcs etc. its ok for starters but it will get boring.
---
You can also check out the Abyss. Its new content and its also OK. The tier 5 Abyss sites will give you OK to good income depending on which ones you run and drop RNG. Abyss can be ran in eitehr 3 frigates or a solo cruiser. No T3Cs though, T1, T2 and Faction only. Just FYI, a good T5 Abyss Gila with full set of implants will run you around 2.5 - 3.5 bil depending on which fit for which filament (which site type), so 6 bil as stated elsewhere, is indeed not much.
---
You can try out the Triglavian ships, they have some different combat mechanics from everything else in Eve and are a lot of actual fun to play in. Doing L4s in a Vedmak or Drekavac is actually a lot of fun, though not the most ISK efficient. I very highly recommend trying it out if you're not stressing about ISK over doing it in any other ships. Don't get stuck into doing L4s in battleships, its about as fun and exciting as mining ....
---
If you're looking at L4s for income, do burners, they are tough at 1st and you should try it out on Sisi, they require different ships then your regular L4s, blingy frigates and cruisers. Best way to do them is once you get yourself set up in a mission system, once your agents get high enough standing they will offer you burner missions quite often, just don't decline them, simply switch ships and do them then go back to the other ones. The other way is a complete PITA where you have several multiboxing alts and keep declining missions until you get full burners only and do them all at once. Then your mission pulling alts lose standing etc completely not worth it.
---
You can get into a T3C, best nowadays is Loki, followed by Tengu, and run DED sites and escalations into LS. You can make daytrips into WHs, don't have to live in them.

    Take out a map
---
    Hold it in both hands, not your offhand
---
    Tilt the map toward the ground so that it is facing downward by looking upward, otherwise you will just be beating the map on a block

    Start mining a block (preferably stone or it will break quickly and you won't be able to climax)

Contratulations! You are now beating that blocky meat of yours.

oof

Close to a 100k in ISK no less! Unacceptable.

Welcome back! Glad to know you are returning, your videos were some of the first I ever watched when I started playing years ago.

I am just saying GSF is better than letting a guy lead them that tried to start a suicide campaign against someone ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Run an alliance. It's better income.
---
How are you going to kill or steal excavators with one of those?
---
That's why we brought a roughly equal number of people, so that they could take fights and have a bit of a back and forth. We nearly fed all of the caps at one point, just barely got them out while slowly breaking. We only won this fight because we brought in reship nags for this situation. 
---

---
I dont think I have the skills to do that. As in, I'd probably fail miserably.
---
This would make sense. Given their tribal nature it might be difficult to coordinate a surrender quickly enough. But perhaps some of the tribes are on the ball.
---
From this picture, yes. I don’t use the tracker so have nothing else to go on.
---
Just do what wormholes do, tag your ship names.
---
There is a war?
---
Thx Mate. 
---
The answer to the inconsistency of scales within the Imperium's arsenal is partly explained by specific ships/weapons/armors/vehicles being "relics" whose value is mostly sentimental and partly because most of the know how of constructing advanced weaponry has been lost during the Age of Strife.
---
Can you even use injectors in SiSi?
---
You’re wrong.
---
This was fare more enjoyable than I initially expected. GJ
---
Not to mention the echo chamber of people agreeing with a "side" based on which "side" of the imaginary line they are.  
---
and down voting anything against that
---
Fleet Commander. These guys specialize in organizing fleets and/or being the fleet anchor (leading ship), planning routes, doctrines, pings, sometimes even have a heavy hand in organizing overall military strategies of an alliance &amp; etc.
---
Those crazy aussies get up to some good stuff, it's amplified by stupid when on roams with DV
---
Sounds like you need more general game experience first and a more solid idea of what you're doing.

That's why he never replied a second time.

Yes you can... Buy an extractor, extract, sell and then use the cash for everything that's 100 isk... Problem is, you need enough SP to make this work because injectors are still expensive regardless 
---
So your telling me you run the site with 3 rattles and you get 500m in 23 minutes. So it took you about 15-20 to run the garrison with the 3 snakes and scooped 250m. Then you killed the drifter in the next 3 to 5 minutes? Dropping the next 300m?
---
iirc you get a BPC for each Concord ship at each tier, with the final being a Marshal BPC

Marshal bpc 1 run

Is this the only way to get the Marshall BPC or is there another, e.g. LP store or such.

Why would you quite literally ruin the game for the vast majority of players, that don't even venture out of hisec? Hisec relies on local to a large degree. Especially new players. If you cannot come up with something (that obviously others are using with success) then you really do need to rethink why you continue to play the game, and move on to something else.
---
There's just so many holes in the logic that it's hard to even argue with. How far away from j5a would you have to go before attacking an INIT structure would provoke a gudfight instead of an actual defense?
---
D-scan can't detect cloaked ships. You can pay attention all you want, but until they decloak, you are flying blind. That holds true in J space just like it does in all levels of sec.
---
You can have fun playing the game. Some areas need some help let's be honest (FW is almost dead), and some stuff need balance but you can enjoy the game. All depends what you want to do.

Sometimes the solution that is the quickest is implemented in fashion that is not intuitive to read or understand. This solution can often be quicker to produce than writing it elegantly. With release cycles and everything else involved in that codes release. Its not at all uncommon.

---
It's not really surprising, tho, that countries like Russia would want more control over their internet. Right now the backbone of the internet is in the hands of the US government, and that's not exactly a stable environment.
---
Also seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to want, given that US agencies blatantly and unapologetically spy on foreign internet users. Honestly if I could flip a switch and make sure all my internet traffic not destined for US locations avoided the US, I would literally pay for that.
---
Rev was my first dread i care for it 
---
No, it means who ever now wants to compete has to set zero tax and thus loses money
---
It’s always nice to hear good news about CVA, one of Eve’s oldest underdogs.
---
But I’d bet money on Gian stirring up bad blood with them and getting you guys kicked in under 3 months. 
---
I do wish you luck though, the Provi/Catch area is pretty lively and fun to pvp in, should easily beat camping Arzad all the time!
---
There are 0% markets in Perimeter. Last time I checked they have the best buy and sell orders. I don't know why anyone would be using the keepstar. That said, TEST restricts docking rights to the half of EVE that it's fighting with, so can't confirm, but I'm pretty sure they're not the best prices since the other markets are so liquid.
---
I can't imagine they're making a lot from that KS:
---
* Getting undercut on taxes: their competitors are offering 0 tax.
---
* Their market is closed to a big chunk of EVE. Sellers would only be selling to a smaller fraction of the player base that TEST is friendly with.
---
I would guess though that it may be worth it for them because it has caused Horde or others to offer tax free markets. This whole thing is probably great for consumers since we get tax free if we use the other, non-keepstar markets.
---
Just like this subreddit. Glad mods removed the post.  
---
"The end goal is for Russian authorities to implement a web traffic filtering system like China's Great Firewall, but also have a fully working country-wide intranet in case the country needs to disconnect. "

Removing local will not solve the botting problem. I said it before. CCP needs to make all input broadcasting illegal. CCP needs to implement anti-cheat software, that will not let the game launch of you have any third party programs installed on your computer that will allow any kind of behavior that bots exhibit. From what I have been hearing, the new launcher has already broken the ability of most if not all third party launchers, to include ISBoxer, that are in use. Perhaps CCP even needs to limit the number of clients that can be opened on a single PC, maybe even go so far as limiting per IP address. And if using something like a VPN can bypass that, AND be detected by anti-cheat software, then ban the use of VPNs as well. Maybe requiring the input of a valid credit card number in order to maintain an active account. Not to be charged unless you authorize a purchase, but just to remain active. Alphas and omegas alike. Do botters use credit cards? I think not.
---
More importantly, CCP needs to hire as many people as it takes to combat the botters.   
---
Your typical exterminatus isn't deathstar style. And I doubt abaddon called what he did that either.
---
That they destroy everything on the planet is exactly what I said?
---
I'm guessing they use it for the same reason people used ICY before. Trust that the market will stay up longer term.
---
Also, as you mentioned, taking the revenue away from Horde was probably incentive enough.
---
I don't think the docking thing matters. Who trades with his main at all? 
---
HMS or USS?
---
Dont worry about Gian. I shall be giving lots of advice on diplomatic issues and helping where I can.

Fact is that as Eve is a really difficult game, the average player spends a lot of time to learn stuff, this Google sheet may help new players in guessing how much time they will spend in learning a thing, they will also understand what you can do in EVE by reading a timeline
---
Presuming people go shopping on their Panfam characters rather than a neutral alt is a bit weird.
---
So what you're saying is mining is boring and you do other things while mining to entertain yourself? :p
---
Dropping zero tax markets is still good, because you can just hike the tax to 10% after a few days and some idiots will put up buys/sells making you a shitload of profit.

Buying nyxes with RL sounds ridiculous. You gotta 'work' in-game to obtain your goal, not p2w.
---
I mean, props for eﬀort and everything. I recommend to go and ask people from all sides that were involved in specific conflicts beforehand though. 
---
Spodbless!
---
'All or Eve' is when one or two entities start invading TAPI's space.
---
So you agree that the TTT is currently blocked to roughly one half of eve that’s actively shooting it, and the Panfam citadels are currently blocked to the other half of eve actively shooting them? Fantastic, thanks!
---
What is a "renter"?  How does the arrangement usually work? My Newbro and I are pretty casual players.  Perhaps too casual for fleet pings (is that a thing?) and comms.  We want to mine, mission run and build a little ISK together while we (maybe) skill up for some PvP.
---
How does one become a renter?  Any personal experience stories (good or bad) as a renter? Can 2 real people make enough to cover the rent?
---
Payment is not everything that keeps people forming (and joining) fleets. There is a lot of other stuff around that. But I am not suprised that you and Jake don't get that.   
---
You both have brilliantly shown your misunderstanding in those fields in the times you were in FCON leadership.  
---
The payment can be a nice "thank you" to an FC, but it will never be the reason he does fleets. Unless you pay him unreasonable amounts of ISK maybe... otherwise, it can only be an addition to an already working system. Also: You want your FCs to do the fleet without paying him, otherwise it won't be good. So when you don't have FCs forming fleets, your problem can't be solved with paying them to form.   
---
What you really need to do is get into the problem. Analyse why they don't form and fix that. It is usually a mixture of several things and I have no idea what it is in this particular case. But I can tell you, paying the FCs to form won't fix it at all...  
---
Oh I like that, it's got a good ring to it.
---
And if we ever needed to rebrand, we could give it a cool Japanese name, like I dunno, just spitballing ideas here, how about KenZoku?
---
State isn't good right now. FW areas used to be brimming with people to shoot. 
---
if you use enough characters you don't have time to be bored.
---
I run the sites in just under 20 minutes. The drifters are taken care of by the citadels. 
---
You won't neatly have it all squared away at once, with rattles. If you want to have the Drifter dead in-site then use dreads.
---
Then this would be a good point to look into.  
---
Why is Galmil so well organized and Calmil is not? Look who does it better than you and then copy and be inspired by the good things they do. That's how you get better.  
---
Technically you're locked out for 1.5 mins there.
---
Leave ship -&gt; 30s session change -&gt; swap pod -&gt; 30s -&gt; board new ship -&gt; 30s -&gt; join fleet, then undock.
---
Totally agree it's tedious and should brought down to the same 1s ticks that the server operates on.
---
In order to join Provibloc you have to accept the retarded NRDS rule.  
---
Who would want to do that unless they don't PvP much?
---
Good point. The payment is not the reasons they form fleets though, it's the extra motivation to writer (proper) AARs, which are important to improve your skills and analyse the fleets etc.  
---
So why isn't he banned? That is all kinds of wrong and against tos and eula.

Well, you know that is common practice in market-fuckery?   
---
You sell your product for 0% plus and make yourself the cheapest competitor. You use that to either sell other products (and make money from them) or to create a big costumer base. Once that base is big enough, you can higher your prices slowly. Most of your competitors will be gone already, as they couldn't compete... works fine if you have the bigger wallet to begin with. And TEST definately has ;)

Totally new here and no idea about the game. Me in my best friend has been away for awhile now and thinking of picking up a new game to enjoy together.. is the game enough if we just party up just the two of us?

This is uh, trash.

I am aware what I am talking about. Never said 125€/h netto did I? 
---
And yes, it´s definately not low sallary I am talking about but not top tier either. And I know there are a lot of countries where this would be absolute top tier sallary and that you have people working for like 8bucks and hour. I personally work up to 60hours a week with 7days on call so to say. For less than what I get I wouldn´t even think of getting up. And before you come along with 125*60, I broke it down to 125*40 even if that´s totally unrealistic in most work environments outside of government work.

another faggot botting apologist lmao
---
derpbee is accurate i guess
---
just an attention seeking little fag 
---
&gt; No, my argument is that you have the tools available to use every but one advantage the defender has. The one thing that you can't remove is local, which you have access to too. Granted, it benefits the defender slightly more, but overall, given the advantages you have as the attacker, I think it balances out just fine. 
---
How does a 5 man gang use alliance gates as an advantage against the defender? How do we use these tools? And local overwhelmingly favors defenders.
---
&gt; Huge fleets are part of the game too you know? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a viable tool. I don't like FozzieSov (as an example) and I don't lilke Entosis-Fleets. Does that mean Entosis is not a viable way to remove the burden of Sov from my enemies? NO! 
---
And that's fine. Doesn't really address my point. My issue of having too many factors that favor krabs isn't addressed by "just blob like we do."  
---
 
---
&gt;I am talking about the numbers that very much point toward a correlation between activity and risk (higher risk = less activity, less risk = higher activity). You haven't adressed the numbers at all.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I've specifically asked you for this:  
---
&gt;If you haven't figured out that all the empirical evidence points to the fact that more ISK making leads to more PvP activity in the game then do the following:  
---
&gt;Check the MER's and compare it with a timeline of major events. The first noticable changes are the rorqual / alpha changes in november 2016. Go check that and see that this has stabilized player numbers from their freefall before november 2016 and notice how it increased the ammount of destruction in the game from an average of 1T per month before the changes to around 1.3 - 1.5T per month on average.  
---
&gt;Then, check the numbers of delve and notice how the ammount of lost ISK is the highest isk lost of any region, with the exclusion of major battles in major wars.  
---
&gt;Last but not least, check the numbers for regions that were made extremely unsafe (like GoTG space or Kalevala when they were camped) and notice how the activity dropped.  
---
&gt;Now, use your brain and put that all into one picture and if you then still believe that ISK making and PvP activity aren't deeply connected, then something is seriously wrong with you.  
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, I do believe that easy kills have a necessary place in EvE and that the game has evolved away from solo PvP over the years. I know you don't like it (and I can relate to having your game change away from your personal playstyle), but unless you adress all these issues properly, the game won't become better - it will become worse.  
---
&gt;And I've asked you to respond to this for the 5th time and you still pretend it never happened.  
---
&gt;So, maybe you could have a look again and adress this problem.
---
Already addressed. As less people rat (as you claim) the value of ISK and ore will go up. So risk/reward will balance itself out. If spod is worth 10 isk, for the 2 people mining and suddenly only 1 person mines, that spod is now worth 20 or even more. Scarcity translates to higher value. So yes krabbing will be riskier...but relatively more rewarding as well. I've stated this multiple times. Why you pretend I haven't just shows you're either not reading what I said or simply being dishonest. Secondly the reason so much activity is in Delve is because of numbers. Delve is the most populated area of nullsec by far. The average skill of players is also generally lower. Outside of an F1 fleet most Goons can't find their ass with both hands. Thirdly going back to your initial point, having less local will very likely encourage more pvpers to go out and roam now since they won't blow up in local every time they enter a system.  
---
&gt;Your argument essentially is: the defender has gotten oh so many advantages, it's not fair anymore.  
---
&gt;When my argument is: the defenders have created these advantages, you can take them away. Why should CCP remove them?
---
NEWS FLASH: You didn't create these advantages. CCP did. CCP created alliance gates, cyno jammers, citadels, mining platforms etc. These are in game mechanics. If CCP made Rorq panic mode last 24 hours, would you say you somehow created that panic mode? Would you also suggest to me that I also use it offensively? No. It doesn't make sense. We are all given the same tools but clearly the tools in question favors defenders. And that stagnates the gameplay, makes people lazy, and ensures that they are only really effective in some massive blob coalition. It kills the spirit of the smaller group.
---
&gt; Capital Umbrellas, Citadels and Infrastructure upgrades are NOT an argument you can use when talking about balancing RISK because they can be removed by players. 
---
Have you ever not been a Goon? When did you start playing 2017? You're so clueless.
---
&gt; So, either stop pretending it's not "too hard" for you to do, or simply stop using them as arguments when trying to talk about risk. You brought these things into the discussion, I say they have no place as an argument simply because you can remove them (if you wouldn't be a lazy and loss averse piece of new edens garbage ofc). 
---
lol the krab hiding behind a wall of blues and the largest blobs wants to reverse this onto me of being risk adverse. What a joke.
---
So...what will the bots do all that time? Dock up the entire time?
---
Cormorants and jackdaws are great for fleets, hecate is cool for solo roams
---
Street price is below 4$/bil cause bots etc.
---
I mean come on
---
Oh no, pvp with other nullsec people, how terrible and boring
---
Strat is cool for lowsec, basically risk free, and because its beefy should handle combat sites up to 4/10 with ease, very good isk for a new player.
---
100mn ab, frostline analyzer, shield extenders and a invuln.
---
it’s 99k per transit, it adds up and you can get several million every couple minutes from it.
---
Praise the savior of hisec

They'll do the same thing they do now when there's a cloaky camper. Why would they do anything different?
---
If he is going to be banned for rmt too, he wont be leading BB fleets anymore. I guess.
---
Um not blocked to me
---
ah, so winning most fights to TAPI feeds is called feeding feroxes on a regular basis now, thats cool.
---
Could TAPI TCU also automatically  drown the local with ASCII pictures, memes, and links of your killmails.
---
I would assume CCP watched and examined him closely after the chat thing. It's up to them to make a judgement.
---
...because there would be no local? Dave are you not reading what i'm writing? The suggestion is to get rid of local or at least not show a list of who is in system. Bots are programmed to warp to citadels or poses when someone unfriendly enters local. If there's no local...they don't do that. If they set up a "watcher bot" on the gate, they'll not be able to deal with wormholers or people who simply stay cloaked. What about this are you not getting?
---
They don't need local to see you come in, we just went over this . 
---
The winner of the fight is irrelevant.
---
Turn up in alpha clone, get fed free kills from the north.
---
"decent"
---
It was at one point
---
That's not ....
---
Look, isk faucets inject ISK into the game. Moon towers never did that.
---
You've never heard of Goonswarm have you? Not the current federation mind you, I mean the original goonswarm. When facing the much tougher Band of Brothers and Lokta Voltera (I think thats how its spelled) They knew they couldn't beat them 1v1. So they brought 5x the amount of people, and most times, they won.
---
lol
---
That's what I thought when I heard about it.
---
It's pretty sweet, everyone loves free killmails. 
---

We go and shoot stuff, however we were also in FW before. We get alot more targets here than we did in FW, so I really don't see the issue, NRDS isn't a problem in provi because it seems almost everyone in eve is red lol
---
passive moons were nothing more than a monthly isk donation to the alliance wallet.
---
&gt; because it has caused Horde or others to offer tax free markets
---
Their main goal was to remove the panfam income stream from the jita taxes. Now horde is putting up 0% markets. Op success?
---
Eve's first?
---
Possibly not a bug and more an unintended "feature", but Xirtam's story about scooping Shamiz's pod into his cargobay and holding him hostage until a GM told him to eject it is pretty great.

Yeah, T1, Navy and Faction frigs everywhere in the Amarr/Min Warzone. Go in there, have some fun. Live, die, repeat. 
---
Taxes are lowered temporarily to combat the competition. This tax rate change is not supposed to last forever but is a test for now and can stay up to a couple of months until it‘s changed back to 0.3% but never above.
---
That‘s from one of the recent episodes of Talking in Stations and was said, if I remember correctly, by Vily.

Somebody from Test might make a statement or better: add some info to the structure description so nobody is butt-hurt in the end.

---
there are still good fights to be had in Amarr-Minmatar FW zone but they barely relate to FW anymore - this is more of a legitimised piracy or long term hate fights. FW as a concept of flipping systems and actually fighting for territory pretty much succumbed to farming bots and citadels. With Minmatar at Tier4 the LP is crazy. So any system that actually changes hands and goes Amarr is plexed overnight to 60-70% by farming toons and bots.  Citadel timer fights are half-assed because there's an 80% chance of SC dropping a blob and deny any sort of normal encounter. Basically between UK, Smile'n'Wave, TMOCC and DHSJ with occasional groups from Schneckt and ex-SWEG dudes there could be possible content, but SC are just too big for the current WZ state.
---
darkness and slyce has been getting dropped on by almost everyone else with stuka fleets coming out of wormholes. and these guys are starting to get better at fighting back. eventually they'll become better at it and come out on top of any other alliance and become the new imperium. stop them now before they become the new imperium.
---
Artemis Tyrannos also shows up sometimes if you harass Autosynthian Lancers.
---
My addendum is that the Gal/Cal wz is actually going through a slight recovery but only because we completely destroyed the content out there this past summer. Think of it as going from flatlined to a deep coma. 
---
Instrumental core’s and vital cores spawn in both 5 and 6 space. Afaik only the C6 combat and data/relic sites are unique to C6s, the Ore and Gas sites will all spawn in 5/6

BPC’s for Concord ships, and it adds up over time as you get 99k per answer, and that’s a couple million in just a few minutes if you’re fast at them.

It should be illegal for all to use, for any reason.
---
Hahaha that’s as CVA as it gets, goddamn
---
Finding targets is hard work now - all the ones that were easy to farm either learned, left or moved to organized pve alliances like Goons/TEST. If you want to go into blopsing, prepare properly - look through zkill for blops-related kills (see where and when people hunt, where they get baited, where and why they die), look for those areas for other activity (is it roamer heavy, do locals drop superblob on anything they can get tackle on), find one or few target areas that are likely to be good hunting grounds, drop an alt in them and watch for actual activity. For solo blopsing your likely best targets are DED runners followed by subcap ratters (that are not VNIs) - spend some time to find who is running DEDs, what time of day they're flying and if they tend to have backup or not.
---
Then just fly T3C somewhere near where they'll go to run next DED, tackle them, light covert cyno and ~~get baited by Fredrick Vonhole~~ collect nice killmail, rinse and repeat.
---
There is, but TEST has no FCs so the program gets unused
---
I used to love roaming to horde, but the typical form of doubling our numbers, trying to headshot me every time, and dropping caps on us gets rather old. 
---
Well, maybe if you played the videogame you would shoot :').
---
Public market tracker sites don't really track trade in citadels very well, since you have to A) know that a given citadel exists, ideally without scraping the public structures endpoint (so CCP doesn't push your shit in,) and 2) pull the data for each such structure individually. It's possible, but nontrivial. They are also utterly unable to track structures that they aren't on the ACL for, such as 1DQ1-A's keepstar.
---
Those few panfam pilot without highsec trading alts are not the target audience.
---
Everyone else is more than welcome
---
Yeah, anyone who actually plays the game has most of their primary characters in a permanently wardecced corporation or alliance. Neutral trade alts are extremely necessary to work around this.
---
I feel like we’re talking about different things here.. why would a corp have to run KOS checks on every neutral if they pay some top tier FC to lead their dudes around?
---
There’s.... a standings system in Eve 
---
So it's about income for you, after all.  Looks like you have difficulty choosing a narrative to follow.
---
They aren't like the warhammer novels, more subtle and scheming than guns and stuff, although all of them have a few wow moments, The Culture are a mingled race of well intentioned do gooders, at least on the surface, behind the scenes they could be kind of horrifying in the right or wrong light, but it's generally for a good reason. 
---
THE UNIVERSE IS MINE!
---
Oh it's Kumbaya Online now?
---
He’s only got pve videos up so far
---
Not trying to shit on you but just pure numbers speaking it really doesn’t. At max accuracy assuming you just spam click to go as fast as possible, you’re still only maybe doing 100,000isk every 7 seconds.
---
That’s roughly 850,000isk a minute - which is pretty good if you’re a brand new player, but A.) its a lot of input (and you have to actually take time to do it right eventually) and B.) you’re only looking at maybe 50m an hour before bpcs etc. Those bpcs come very rarely, so once it’s averaged out it’s still quite bad

Plus even though people wanna ree at nrds in provi, we're still getting a hell of a lot more content there than ever in FW, after all in FW you're still blue to militia, and theres loads of people that go to provi to shoot things. Combined with the fact that provi is literally 5 jumps away from the Amarr/Minmatar Warzone, it's the perfect spot really, plus being in CVA means when SC do bigger stuff in the warzone we can always bring a fleet over to play.
---
FYI CVA have been adding people to that list for 15 or 16 years, I’m surprised they haven’t just dropped the whole NRDS thing since literally everyone is on it.
---
And FW groups going out to null for better pvp content in better areas is a time honored tradition for years now, why would anyone stay in the cal/gal area getting farmed by the Snuff superfleet or in the amarr/min area getting dropped and bridged on by SC at every turn?
---
I tried to investigate, but the POS shot me.
---
It's not any safer for structures, and if it's enough incentive with taxes, the hubs will just move to 0.5 systems, where it's the same wardec requirement to remove them
---
WHs are trash. Join a FW corp

---
“I’m sorry guys I can’t join the fleet tonight I have to fly to perimeter to update my orders and then fly all the way back”
---
I contend, good sir, that we were did not shoot it until after we were locked out on that first evening.

it isn't better this way
---
yet your literally here crying like a butthurt faggot, like you do daily on everything you post on? Its almost like you pretend the community doesn't think your a complete fucking snowflake?
---
That's not the point. ISK faucet describes the creation of ISK out of thin air.
---
Moon mats could be traded for ISK.
---
I'm not disagreeing that passive moon mining had it's flaws. But it never was an ISK faucet.
---
&gt; Dont downvote this to hell
---
Downvote it, gotcha
---
That will drive people away from your trade platform.
---
1mil lines of code sounds like quite big overestimate, but I don't think rest of the story is unlikely - for small, young and inexperienced companies it's actually quite common to hand out the task of creating new product/feature that's not time critical to one person and living them be quietly working on it while rest of the team is focused doing other stuff. If after that you integrate that part of code without looking through it properly (because deadlines, management pressure and so on) and then that developer leaves the company on bad terms (for whatever reason), you're in exactly this kind of situation.
---
I have seen situations like that with unmaintainable parts of large projects (or even whole projects) more often that I'd like to admit, and from practical standpoint getting former dev to the point of responding with "fuck you" to any question about what they made is equal to said dev being hit by a bus.
---
Everyone saying you're bad at coding if you use comments is bad at pretending they have any clue about what they're saying. You've clearly never written code nor tried to read it.
---
I use couple as anything from 2 to 5, non standard, I know. I can get 1 every 12 seconds at this point, as long as I’m not distracted!
---
If you wish to continue plexinf your accounts, try out wh ratting in c5 space. 1 dread gets you a solid 700m/h. 3 get you up to 2b/h.
---
As for the station trading, find modules that arent 100% dead but have a small amount of buy/sell orders with great margins. The easy to think of items are thought of by everyone, thus resulting in you being overwritten in mere seconds.
---
except that one instance is a bannable offense. 
---
I did not even know he existed. 
---
You can also get it from recruit a friend by recruiting 40 ~~alts~~ new players.
---
That’s why you make a NEW 0.0% tax station in order to compete with the “dicks” who hiked up the price ;) 
---
Back in the day it was the only way a indy corp could make headway. Alliances considered miners as some type of sub species. In fact many would require any indy toons to be put into a sub alliance, normally part of their rental empire. 
---
They were not really accepted into the main stream alliances as much because that big alliances would buy their ships ( at a discount) off the people they are requiring to pay isk from their space. 
---
While I was in goonswarm, I director of Rental alliance also. Who did nothing but turn out fuel blocks. They paid the CFC something like 55b a month in fuel blocks for their space, and still were among the richest alliances in the game. 
---
You should work on your math then or climb out of your ass and admit you were wrong. 125\*40 = 5000 per week. That's around 20000 a month or 240000 a year. Average salary for a doctor in Germany is 80000 - 100000, depending on the source. The average salary of a German employee is around 3771 per month in 2017 according to official government numbers. I am only taking Germany as an example because you were talking about middle Europe. If you think that 125 euro per hour is not top tier salary and the norm your are delusional.
---
Well you certainly missed out.
---
If you are going to station trade, pick a hub other than Jita. I started station trading in Rens about 3 months ago... I am not very good at it, but my initial starting capital of 6 billion is now 30 billion. Jita is filled with market bots and/or people who *only* trade all day. 
---
Indeed! Versatility to the max
---
That's all he ever did though, PVE.
---
Lets not forget that mere months before they invaded high sec they were still making memes about how dumb Horde was to be prancing about in high sec.
---
Then you scoop it and redrop under different corp.
---
Why bother talking if you have no idea what you’re on about?

If you're just starting and hoping to track stuff on sheets, bear in mind the game will keep your market transactions only up to 3 months. After that you lose the history, so that would be a good statistic candidate to track offline.
---
Aww it's okay, we will find your parents, you seem to be lost in this big scary place called reddit. 
---
There there little one, It's okay we understand some people find it hard to speak to other's. 
---
One way to keep people out of Test space I guess.
---
&gt;some videos being reuploaded
---
that will get him banned again
---
Oh ok lol
---
Lol you mad or something?
---
There's an ESI endpoint for listing all public structures in Eve. That one is fine. What I was (poorly) referring to was abusing the endpoint that allows you to search structures based on an input string. Before CCP cracked down on it, players were using the search endpoint to scrape game data, altering the search terms slightly to evade the cache timer. If CCP catches you doing that now, they'll push your shit in.
---
Yes! this is great news! I'm so gald to have him back
---
That's perfectly fine. It is just a useless rule. Provi was loads of fun back in the day, during the previous iteration if Provibloc, which I was part for a while, when I was noob.
---
I also didn't know better and KOS checked like an idiot. :D
---
Ah, makes sense so - thanks for clarifying
---
At least on the Galmil/Calmil front it's become so one-sided that even Federation Uprising (FW corp) uprooted and moved away. Things are so bleak for Caldari I almost want to go there for the sheer challenge of it. Underdog and all that. But IMO the game mechanics punish underdogs in FW. So that's a bummer.
---
When you see Hard Knocks demoted to some Panfam reddit propaganda spergers it really makes you warm inside.
---
Fullerite C540 and Fullerite C320 gas are what you will find in the Instrumental Cores Reservoirs and Vital Core Resevoirs. 
---
Note that the gas sites will spawn sleepers that are much worse than what you will find in any other gas sites. 
---
\-**The Instrumental Core Resovoir** will spawn 4 battleships(Sleepless Sentinels) randomly after 15-20+- minutes that can warp scramble, web and NOS you. You will find 6000 units of Fullerite C320  and 500 units of C540 in this gas site.
---
\-**The Vital Core Resevoir** will spawn 4 Battleships(Sleepless Keepers) and 4 frigates(Emergent Keeper). The battleships NOS in this site and the frigates Remote Rep and NOS as well. There are no scrams in this site. You will find 6000 units of Fullerite C540 and 500 units of Fullerite C320 in this gas site.
---
Here is the thing, if a behavior is normed, it is no longer "sociopathic." Sociology for the win. 
---
The Panfam trading stations are dying every week tho. :&lt; And some of em are trying to do the 0%-&gt;50% scam. :&lt;
---
It's just so much safer to trade Tranquility Trading Tower keepstar.
---
They're #2 behind Imperium for income generation. Would they *like* an extra wad of cash? Sure. Do they *need* it, and is it worth them being continually deployed to Jita to keep it? No.
---
And if panfam uses the "success" of 0% tax citadels as a propaganda win, that's even better for them. You'll convince yourselves that you've "won" and stop trying to fight for it.

I particularly enjoyed their spittle-flecked insistance that we're "salty".

---
Well sorry, you not being able to afford subs isn't an isk grinding problem, it's a "you being too poor IRL to maintain that many accounts" problem. 
---
Fair enough, but I find it very, very hard to believe that there aren't similar types of  opportunities around where you live.

Any tips on completing these? Too many prove difficult to find the dips

---
*From your friends, corp mates, and family. You will be missed.* 
---
*o7* 
---
Something like that. 
---
So why hasn't CCP banned him then?
---
Please no. First of all, trading from NPC stations provides a valuable isk sink that player owned upwell structures do not. Second of all, I would rather throw the extra isk away than help whatever person, corporation, or alliance who put the up the 'trading' structure get richer. 
---
I understand I am probably in the minority for the second point, but everyone who plays eve should care about the first. 
---
No
---
I am well aware of my math and of you assuming a lot of things. Assuming things is "bad habit" as we like to call it. You did realise I am not doing a 9to5 job like the average joe? Just ask your co-workers if they are willing to work 60hours a week sometimes more for their "normal sallary". 
---
If they agree and qualify they can get my job or a smiliar one. 
---
And the doctor thing is outdated. Most doctors are "middle class" with some of them being above that but the times where you could say "Become a doctor, you will be rich." are long gone. 
---
Anyway, I guess we wont get on the same page with this. And it´s far off topic on top. So if it makes you happy, I am delusional. :) 
---
If I could upvote this 20 times, I would. Importantly I would add, what you call 'lining the pockets' of NPC corps actually plays a super important function in the overall maintenance of the game economy. This is because, unlike the real economy money in eve is generated from nothing (killing of rats for example). To check inflation--which is already bad--isk needs to be 'sunk' out of the economy as well... AND one of the best isk sinks in the game is NPC taxes and broker fees. 
---
Urm are you mentally disabled?
---
I would like to get a large skill injector, and I have the plex to afford it. I'm in nullsec, and I'm wondering what's the safest/cheapest/best way for me to make this transaction (do I go to Jita? Sell at corp station? Send a low-level alt somewhere and then transfer the ISK?).
---
There are some very old capitals in high sec and some accidentally moved there, but you cant use them for anything except show off.  You can't sell them either, so I guess your friend's chances of getting one are pretty slim.
---
No not going to track money transactions, I think I will write how I made money above 5/10 Millions though.
---
yes, there are capitals in hi-sec, but they are relics of the past.
---
Currently, capitals are not allowed in hi-sec, but old ones were grandfathered into hi-sec with the restriction of being useless and unable to do anything in combat. 
---
So yes, you can fly a thanatos in hi-sec, but you'll have to buy one for hundreds of billions of isk and it will be worthless.
---
Otherwise no.
---
Yep, and if they (CCP) were serious about what the OP suggested, they would need to: 1) develop alternative isk sinks; and 2) figure out a way that control over keepstars can be more easily contested in high sec. 
---
The latter being particularly important because having a thousand subcaps on grid shooting at an upwell structure in a trade hub has serious ripple effects. 
---
You can bot.  
---
Eventually your ship will be moved to highsec.
---
PH propaganda is just retarded.  Come on learn economic warfare.
---
OMG, is this for reals?! LOL
---
OMG This are wonderful news, so many people in the eve community own so much to him for his videos back in the day... He and DeLone Wolf were the most helpful YouTubers back when I started, and it's good to see Johny back o/
---
i'm trying to get into pi (last time i tried was before the changes, didn't understand shit and almost got carpal) and would like to make nanite paste. can some competent pi nerd please share his setup/process? (assuming max skills i guess)
---
You can remotely use injectors, just buy it wherevers the prices are lowest and inject the sp. There's basically no reason to ever undock with injectors in your cargo.
---
It was a while ago so i can’t get screenshots, but i can do it again to show you, i was getting 3-5m every time it distributed them.  It’s very possible with mostly no transits at 98% accuracy except for obvious ones
---
this is one of the most virign tier shitposting accounts I've laid my eyes on kid lmao
---
Thanks for your hard work. EVE history videos are always good content.
---
Yes, as long as you have carrier in higsec then yes ^(and yes people have carriers ... even supers in higsec)
---
What the hell is this
---
WTB fax or carrier in jita :D   
---
guess ur dum then
---
&gt;So yes, you can fly a thanatos in hi-sec, but you'll have to buy one for hundreds of billions of isk and it will be worthless.
---
Nope. 
---
&gt;A capital ship restricted (under normal game mechanics) to 0.4 space or lower may never change ownership under any circumstance, willfully or not, while in high-security space (0.5 security systems and above).
---
This includes, but is not restricted to: Using the EVE market system, using the EVE contract system, using station direct trades, abandoning it in space.
---
So unless you're a vip(like a certain goon afiliated character) and gms bend yhe rule for you then you cannot trade them. 
---
Thought he might have ended up like a friend of mine. Wife wanted the youtube channel when they divorced.
---
They make fitting ships easier, that is why they recommend them to V.  I trained them over time you don't need them all there at once. 
---
No, and please get out of hi sec.... It is toxic there, I almost quit from numerous hi sec war dec corps attempting to club/ransom the 4-5 personnel newbie corps we had. That since has been corrected but much more fun/isk elsewhere. 
---
Welcome to the club.
---
A renter is someone who pays a larger null bloc isk for exclusive use of a system, or systems. If it's just 2 people you would probably be better off joining a newbro corp. They will have the infrastructure to help you learn the game, make isk, and do whatever else you want to do. Most of them have membership requirements that the most casual player can maintain.
---
you only need to join a bigger group if you want to live in sov null. In other parts of the universe (highsec, lowsec, NPC null, WHs) you can live while in NPC corporation. 
---
I think he stopped on his own, not 100% sure of this tho.
---
Used to pay out about 2b/month at 80m/fleet back in '14.  
---
Anything that forces me to take a break from this game, is a good idea.
---
Only nullsec/WH PI is worth doing afaik. &gt;!So join horde and read an in-depth guide on robotics by me on horde forums!&lt;
---
Welcome back Johnny, newbros that don't even know you yet, have missed and needed you.
---
no idea, but it was input broadcasting which had an impact on the game world, even if it is only in a chat channel.  By all rights they should or at the very least revise the rules on input broadcasting. 
---
i have no horse in this race, i don't care one way or another, i don't do anything out in the world in eve which could get me mixed up with BB so it doesn't bother me at all. 
---
Renting isnt cheap and renters are considered to be turbo crabs and lowest form of live only after highsec miners. Also you can never be too casual for fleets. Even a 1 day old alpha in a little ewar ship can do some damage to enemy fleet.
---
Rykki's guide is a must for wh living.

If you can't afford the monthly bill of 15 euro/20 dollars, or whatever currency you are using, and you don't think it's a good idea to spend RL money on something you, by the sounds of it, spend a fuckton of time on, you probably should drink a few beer less a month and you got that pathetic little amount of money "back in".
---
Sorry I simply can't stand these posts that state I can't afford my monthly plex, then you probably can't afford to eat or to spend money on your internet connection either.
---
If you want to keep RL money away, then all you should do is being thankful towards ccp that they actually offer such an option, but any complaint about a tedious grind you literally put on yourself each month I simply can't sympathize with.
---
Regards
---
imagine thinking this was a clever reply.
---
I dunno if you're new or what, but I'll bite and be helpful. When you fight outnumbered 2:1 to even it out you sometimes have to bring triage and caps. Sometimes you even lose those to a blob.
---
Cool! Was just ruminating on how I should have asked for recommendations in my last post
---
they can not be tranferred by any means.
---
CCP will make exceptions if you are a space pope however and declare that you really really REALLY didnt knew the rules about capitals in highsec.
---
seriously ? who is this guy ? have you already played Eve-Online ?
---
I'd smash.
---
hmm i seem to remember something important happening around 7 months ago... concerning the rights to own some game and the transfer thereof ... you don't think people would really just stop giving a crap about their work the literal moment they find out the company they work for has been sold?
---
MVP Comment.
---
&gt;Everyone is welcome to be who they are.
---
Especially closed communities with "win at all costs" attitude, who are generally not friendly to outsiders and do not communicate with the rest of a playerbase. No problem! 
---
Lonewolf has been back for a while as well :) 
---
well they are also so much simpler its not even worth a comparisson, you'd think that balance it out
---
In contrast to the lightning fast response time previously?
---
This is what the ideal capsuleer should look like. 😍😍
---
It's looks really nice on the wiki but the instructions are absolute crap for Pathfinder when it comes to the prerequisits. There is so much that is NOT covered and it's assumed you are able to figure out how to configure and install all the prereqs on your own... not very friendly for people new to the Linux distro.
---
\*The documentation for setting up Apache or Nginx is just a line stating it's required. They don't show you how to install or configure these applications at all as far as getting the landing page up and running.
---
Okay. So what now?
---
I don't think there's a hard and fast rule for something like that.
---
CCP William Boards quit over 2 years ago. Sorry, OP
---
Peak performance.
---
This explains why he has the god-like attribute of ignoring the petty concerns of us mere mortals/customers.
---
your welcome to provide examples :)
---
Honestly I think a very public warning, or re-affirmation/clarification of the rules like you said, would've solved this entire situation for everyone. I hope (and assume) CCP looked into his logs/the situation when his initial broadcast to the chat was posted here, to see if it's in use anywhere else etc. 
---
Seeing as how bottling is not under the guise of CCP, but more along the lines of Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, I fail to see the issue here.
---
I don't see how you working 60 hours a week has anything to do with your statement that 125 euro per hour is a normal salary for middle europe. If you are earning that, good for you. Doesn't change the fact that its far from a regular income in middle European countries. You can easily check these numbers at the sites of the statistical departments of the countries, like I showed for Germany.
---
We stick to NRDS for tradition reasons. Spodbrains still would get hotdropped like crazy, because of their own lack of reflexes. NBSI wouldn't change a thing, tbh.
---
how 
---
Wasn't this /u/ccp_falcon's job? He probably took on more work after the community team was fired.
---
We completely base our self esteem on some random bean's shitposting, so we're pretty rekt about it right now.
---
Okay, thank you. What about selling the PLEX for ISK? Is there a suggested place to sell it so as to not get screwed by fees and such? Or is the margin between stations low enough that I should sell wherever is easiest to get to?
---

---
You have never, not even once, provided evidence of this illegal activity by GSF, especially for it to be "all the time".  
---
Also, he was not legally using it.  He was in space cloaky camping.  There is no legal use for it in this instance.  None.  But yet you champion his cause.  Why?  Because you have a hateboner for GSF.  It utterly clouds your judgement.  
---
He logs in at downtime, what time was the chat sent? Sorry, the guy is not innocent.  He got caught, and should get a 30 day.
---
Some people are really talented at making crazy/creepy looking characters. Meanwhile, mine is boring as hell and I have zero patience to try and improve it
---
Pro-tip: next time ignore the citadels and go  for the ihubs.  Citadels are easily cleaned up with alpha VNI alts.
---
Was a Ferox pilot, got alphad with overheated hardeners.
---
After insurance feroxes are dirt cheap though and with srp, this probably doesn't really hurt people; It doesn't hurt me at least. 
---
And additionally it was a good fight and such I am not mad about losing a ship.
---
If only mechanics allowed some kind of counterplay to low effort sov trolling.
---
That's the catch. Being outnumbered would have mattered if both sides had similar ships. You bring ships that is 10 times worth more than your opponent and still manage to lose. I guess you hit your head hard when you fell from your high horse which is caps umbrella. Go earn your isk back, stop wasting your time here. Go on, time to 10-box incursions.
---
Ohhh yes, He is awesome! xD
---
How are you targeting all those npc so fast in your overview so damn fast?
---
yeah CCP have always had a bit of a problem with consistency when it comes to enforcing rules. You are right, a clarification would have almost entirely settled this whole thing. but meh, like i said i don't really care at all just a bit disappointing that CCP will bend their own rules as often as they do. 
---
Either your null groups main stager/market, or one of the Perimeter markets probably.
---
SORRY GUYS TOO BUSY MAKING SKINS!

Always be a ferox. After insurance and srp you lose like no money.

actually I remember getting same day GM service a few years back on every issue I brought up... what is the average ticket response to these days?
---
It can be done, but you need to do it on multiple accounts now to sustain a decent income.
---
CCP introduced a mechanic that stops you from answering too quickly and just closes the PD interface when triggered. So when I was approaching 500, I'd gotten good enough that I was remaining at 99% and triggering that fucking anti-bot measure frquently. To get around it I started doing it on two additional accounts: answer on one, flip to the second and answer, flip to the third and answer and back to one. Even then I occasionally incurred the wrath of the anti-bot mechanism, particularly when all three were clear no transits.
---
I didn't do it for the isk, I did it because it was something to do between fleets and during the downtime during a fleet. Took me 3 months to get to 500. Isk wise, it was better than VNI ratting, less than carrier. But again, I didn't do it for the isk, and have kept my marshal, and most of the other rewards.

OOF look at that alliance ticker........
---
Explosion radius of the bomb and signature radius of the ship. 
---
Solo bombs don’t do much damage to anything, but generally have best application against battleships and capitals. 
---
The only solo use of a bomb is probably using void bombs to neut your target, but you’d still have to get 30km away, which would force you outside warp disruptor range
---
As a solo stealth bomber, your best advantage is warping cloaked and being able to lock immediately after decloaking. Target industrial ships with torps, or refit to rockets to catch unsuspecting frigates. 
---
LOL
---
Bloody hell that's a ton of hp for an alpha ship. Nice. 
---
So they used diplomacy as weapon. Maybe its time for Calmil to do the same then?
---
Ask your mom

I sub my accounts for the whole year when they have a subscription sale. I do planetary interaction in a wormhole on 3 characters on each account to give me extra isk for things I want. There is no reason you cannot do it as well. Especially if you are running incursions on two accounts.
---
I’d hit it. With missiles

she is right. he IS the  most sexy eve player that exists
---
Thats not magic.... thats just really high APM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fake news.
---
That would be a perfect idea if there were consistent costs associated with running a competitor...
---
As it is, the 0.1% competition can just avoid dropping azbels for now, or they can get sponsored by plex traders/political opponents to drop 0.0% ones. The second Test raises the price, the 0.1% azbels will pop up again instantly. There's really not a high barrier to entry compared to real life.
---
It seems like all Test has done here is give up 66% of their highsec income in an effort to reduce the number of highsec ops they have to do.
---
Because some other ships don’t insure as well as a ferox

Sell plasma once a month and cover 2 subs for an hour if work. Also help save lives. Almost anyone in decent health with no bloodborne diseases, significant risk factors or recent tattoos is eligible. And you can go twice a week if you want, but once a month is more than enough for eve.
---
You can't dock supers in regular stations
---
A single bomb is pretty much completely useless unless you're trying to kill a dictor bubble. You're more likely than not going to bomb yourself, and a cruiser is going to chew up your manticore and spit it out before you get 2 cycles of torpedoes off. Maybe, *just maybe,* if you catch the cruiser MWDing when you bomb you can do pretty substantial damage, but you're still not going to break his tank. Against a frigate MWDing you could probably pop it with a single bomb, but not a cruiser. And if its an armor tanked cruiser all you're going to do is mildly annoy the guy.
---
There's really nothing that you are going to solo in a bomber. They're the glassiest of glass cannons, and really only meant to work in groups. 
---
No problem. So, tell me, how does it make you feel?
---
I dont think that making big money has been the main intention for TEST anyways.

Calling back drone can be done by keybinding something. A simple script to press the same key to 12 accounts.... oh wait...

100% this.
---
To expand further on your point, the drudgery of grinding PVE to make your PVP ships is what makes ship loss in combat painful and what pushes to you to better.
---
So there is actually a reason for PVE being a poor experience.  It's meant to be a punishment for being bad at PVP.
---
A couple of things I would like to see added:
---
A be a tractor beam that lets you pull in cans to the refinery from the belt during mining ops. 
---
Be able to run boosts to the fleet from the refinery.
---
In both cases you would have to have someone in control in the structure. 
---
To make it disruptable make it so these two modules don't work if there is any damage to the structure so no using it when reinforced or during the repair timer. 
---
Here are the names of the rorquals involved: [https://i.imgur.com/9fBuL0b.png](https://i.imgur.com/9fBuL0b.png) I also have a video with them all mining beforehand, if more proof is needed.
---
Learning to dscan will really help. Set range to max and the angle to 5°. Then on your probe scanner menu, hold v and click on the anomaly you're interested in. It should auto dscan that location and tell you what's there. When you find an empty one, you're good to go

I remember Electus Matari having an alliance logo when I came to work at CCP, but I'm not sure when it was removed from Tranquility - probably when all the legal hoo-haa happened.
---
The alliance logo folder I have in my inbox goes back just about 5 years. [Here's the result when I search for anything related to EM](https://i.imgur.com/Xk286em.png) - It doesn't look like anyone ever re-submitted it after we purged all the logos from TQ.
---
We didn't purge Singularity's DB as it's just a test server, so that's why it's still showing up there.
---
You guys need to resubmit a 512x512 like everyone else if you want your logo back on TQ. If you've tried to resubmit in the past, then for some reason it hasn't come through or has gone to the wrong address. See [this link](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/alliance-logo-submission-policy/)for details on how to do it properly.

It completely depends on what you and your friend end up doing in the game. Some activities in EVE are viable to do by yourself, or in small groups (PvE, micro/small gang PvP, mining, industry, trade, to list a few off the top of my head) but larger goals (holding sov, large-scale fleet PvP, etc.) are only achievable for much larger groups. I primarily fly solo and microgang— i.e., pewing other players’ ships by myself, or with a friend or two— and I think there’s something rich and rewarding about being able to achieve goals individually or in small groups apart from large corporations. I certainly find it more satisfying.
---
That said, EVE is such a deep and complex game that you'll have to learn things the slow way and miss out on a lot of the aspects of the game if you don't join a corp or at least make connections with more experienced players (even if you don’t end up flying with them).
---
He didn’t broadcast the that speech to numerous locals at the same time at least.
---
Once you figure out if you like the game, get into a good Corp that does the activists you’re enjoying. Eve is actually a fairly social game, and working together toward goals is one of the best ways to play it.

Seriously, it'd be a good time to join if you want to flip the warzone back to Caldari. Yes, all the big Caldari alliances gave up in frustration a few months ago. BUT then almost all the GalMil alliances left too.. I think GMVA is the only large/active GalMil alliance left (Fedup is still technically in FW but is almost exclusively a Nullsec alliance at this point). 
---
On the other side though Salt Farmers has joined FW on the Caldari side and has been busy flipping systems back to Caldari and there's not enough GalMil left to prevent them from doing so.

Yep, that's input broadcasting. Ban em.

"View Full Body".... But I'm not sure I want to.
---
When you say legal do you just mean it’s a common/normal practice? Sounds similar to rocket league ngl. (not the game just idea of scamming)
---
I never said it shouldn't be handled and people be banned. But i've seen plenty of posts of people harping on about Mar5hy when their own alliance does the same thing and they turn a blind eye.
---
with that one excavator taking way longer to recall then the rest it is proofed that this is no input broadcasting or botting. clearly false accusations.
---
Hey remember that one time my CSM advert was stuck on all the billboards and CCP couldn't figure out how to remove it. Then they removed the other CSM ads but mine re-attached it'self? I bet there is a story there. 
---
The same basic thing applies to most T1 ships. It's just most alliances don't run many T1 doctrines for strat-ops because they're less effective. Feroxes are just REALLY good for a T1 ship. 
---
That was so satisfying!
---
What some nerds on reddit say with an alliance flair does not necessarily reflect the attitudes and opinions of everyone in that group.
---
CCP encourages players to scan each other in game, it's part of the PvP. Generally buying from market is alright, just make sure someone hadn't added a few extra zeroes to the sell order. Be especially careful with contacts. Also, you shouldn't have to pay for people to accept you into a corporation. How you have fun, fly dangerously

The Rorqual.
---
It’s really very simple. 
---
Any half way decent alliance will have jump freighter service from Jita to its staging system. My preferred thing to import are doctrine ships. So I’ll take a look at contracts in staging and see what doctrine ships are lacking. Then you have your Jita alt buy the ships, all their fittings, ammo and rigs and then contract it to your null character. Make the shipping contract to your jump freighter service and bring it all out to null. Then fit up the ships and mark them up at Jita purchase costs + shipping + 10%.  
---
Besides your standard doctrine fits sabres sell extremely well as they die so often. Travel and tackle fit interceptors, t2 logi, heavy interdictors, and ratting VNIs can all be good too depending on what your alliance uses. 
---
You can also seed individual modules if you see gaps in the market. Don’t rip off your alliance mates but a 10% lazy tax is more than acceptable. 
---
Sometimes you won’t see many sales for a little bit but then when you guys whelp a fleet suddenly 30-40 people need a new ship and there they all go. Every time you sell through your inventory there is another 10% more isk than you had before.  
---

The only thing I would add to this is that you could also bomb barges or exhumers with some success but you will probably need some torps still to finished them off, but the alpha damage could be worth it. Wingspan (chance ravinne) had a video of him getting a double kill on some miners in a wormhole using a bomb and one volley of torps. Again, piloting is key like was said

---
&gt;One of the biggest reasons why you never see shield battleship fleet comps anymore is because of their susceptibility to getting bombed.
---
That's got nothing to do with the sig radius though, armor battleships have &gt;400m sig bare naked and take full damage anyway (only T1 exceptions are the Apoc and Mega, and with 380m sig even they take 95% of a bomb's damage). Shield mods making the sig larger isn't really a disadvantage here. The main danger is that their active hardeners can get turned off by a wave of void bombs while armor battleships can rely on passive hardeners (though they do often use active ones too)
---
We initially heard about this from /u/ipickednow and I had a discussion with him and another RL friend who knew  Mindful since they were kids on TS.

If you're multiboxing this many you don't alt tab. I have five rorqs and using isboxer I can cycle through the clients with a single button. It would literally take me a second to call drones on all five using quick switch and a single button to recall. ITT people who  have never multiboxed using proper software, but grrrr goons amirite?

That's a fantastic idea tbh. I've no idea why i never thought about this. I was making fleets almost daily for 8months about, which caused me to burn hard doing it.

The logistics, the general idea of the fleet, fitting the ships, get ppl hyped, making the ping, handing out ships. After a while it can be exausting.

You act like the alliances install software onto their member’s computer to check for key-bonded broadcasting. The reason Mar5hy is getting shit on is because posting in multiple locals at the same time is up there with “*we found your DNA and fingerprints on the stolen bag of Mountain Dew Code Red and Twizzlers*” in terms of hard evidence. Also Mar5hy is bad and super loud about other things he likes to cry about so expect the same loudness whenever he does stupid shit.

Well no it's not quite that inconsistency that I'm referring to; more how certain items are described as irreplaceable relics or requiring centuries of effort to construct in one "source" if you will, but in another the same items are considered to be mass-producible, if perhaps on a somewhat limited scale.
---
Ships are probably the best example of this, but even the Titan walkers of the Imperium get referred to alternately as irreplaceable reliquary or as simply great efforts to construct. Plasma weapons as well sometimes get this treatment (or at least examples that are supposedly more reliable).
---
This also doesn't quite explain how you can have one source describe specifically delineated (and effects consisted with) multi-gigaton level firepower but another source notes effects consistent with much smaller quantities of destructive energy.

Part of the reason Russian corps own the drone lands areas is because nobody else really wants that space. Also all their timers are geared toward their peak times so good luck getting enough people formed up for an extensive structure bashing op. 
---
No Goon has ever seriously declared that we have no botters. When you're the largest alliance you're going to have bad seeds. Leadership's official stance on botting has always been the same: its not their job to do CCP's job for them. If you see botting, report it just like you would any other player and let the mods make the final call. Leadership has too many other things to deal with to have to investigate every claim.

Every Goon response here has been basically "Of course its *those* guys. Yeah, fuck those guys."

After some familiarization, find a reputable corp to help you learn the more intricate aspects of the game. The learning curve of this game is an absolute monster. You will get lost and bored with it very quick if you don't have someone that knows what they are talking about to help you along.

I started to get into the background about the changes to cloaked ships de-cloaking each other and how that changed the nature of bombing, making it much easier to bomb in large numbers, and the implications of void bombs blah blah blah but I figured that it was already too long to answer the question without getting into the whole active shield vs. passive armor debate.

no. you don't that is a dead ship.  make sure you are ready to die in it the moment you undock.

I see, thanks for the reply

It's worth remembering that the character editor was not always as reliable as it is today. When it was new it could produce some pretty strange results.

Just writing little blurbs about whoever sits at the desk

You can, very easily.

Should have seen your crying after that perimeter fight the other day, oh boiiiii

well fought!

&gt; You act like the alliances install software onto their member’s computer to check for key-bonded broadcasting

Digi woulda done that tho

For a new miner who's completed all career agents, is the best thing to do afterward (if I like mining) to go ahead &amp; start doing all these mining agent missions around? I see it takes forever to be able to get to a level 2 agent, but is the PVE aspect of mining worth nearly the amount you would get simply mining in riskier scenarios. My question I guess is, are the missions worthwhile to anything except BPO's?
---
Nah, join a trash collection corp and trade garbage between npc stations every day.

He's not looking for people that will take the fight.  He's hunting in wormholes.
---
It's ok beacuse he is generating content.
---
One thing. While scamming is legal, and you should assume any deals posted in local are scams, if someone opens a conversation with you to give you advice, you can generally assume they are legit, because new people don’t have enough isk to make scamming worth it, and most vets want you to stick with the game long enough to get into something worth blowing up, at the very least. 
---
They don't own the drones anymore, they got evicted by skillurself and tri

Wait, then how would Olmeca cycle through all of his bombers/booshers/whateverelseheiswhelping without broadcasting?  Because if this is proof of input broadcasting, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you.  If you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free.
---
not really, the keepstar is more convenient and reliable. Also there is a thing called alts, sit on the keep and notice alts from all sides going in. 
---
Where can we apply ?

Ahh, the unfortunate artist who longs to be understood, but is never recognized for his genius because the masses are just too “uncultured”.  Of course it would be unfitting for such a genius to go through the trouble of actually explaining what the hell he was trying to express.

Honestly, don’t listen to the negative talk in this sub about how the game sucks now. Definitely try and join a Corp that will help you out and show you the ropes of whatever you want to do. Have fun and don’t be scared to get blown up, you’ll learn.

Buy seriously, how is this possible given I once forgot to put pants on a throw away character I was making and got told I needed more cloths. 
---
Highsec planets are really bad, and PI is still a clickfest. Nanite Repair Paste is produced by every newbie and his space dog, only used in small quantities, and therefore oversupplied. It's hard to go wrong building Robotics (like the other guy suggested), which are used in fuel blocks, T2 drones, and all manner of T2 production.
---
I fucking knew who this was gonna be just from the thumbnail. Got ganked by this chap in highsec ages ago. Had a legit good convo, every so often would message to find out how things were. Had a chat about VR once. The profile photo has gradually gotten weirder. 
---
I can do that with 6 accounts in less than a second. Provided my thumb button on the mouse hasn't messed with shift+r. It does that for some reason some times. But provided the interface takes it, this isn't hard to do if you have all of the screens as small windows through EVE-O or something and just tab through them hitting shift+R quickly. I'm not saying the guy above is or is not broadcasting, just that that video isn't conclusive of anything.

the names have changed of the masters but the renters remain the same.

Nice catch! That loki thought he was getting away with it

nope

Don't post the names, more than likely they'll extract and flatline those accounts before being banned.

Hit a Structure is basically the new version of this, the problem is it takes more time then RFing a pos, so a lot less people do it.

the other option is to drop a content structure

And every other SOV holding alliance, but go ahead and grr goons. Clearly they are the only organization in null sec with botters in their midst.

Actually a lot of the well known russian botting corps moved to KWG and living breathing fuel blocks.

Looks like a post from one of those people AOC wants to see get a solid income even if they are unwilling to work.

Speaking from direct experience, when you take people who are pleasant and chill in normal situations, and then try to play EVE with them, it'll often end up hurting the friendship. 
---
One of you will probably end up being more invested than the other, leading to an imbalance of responsibilities and strife about what level of risk/reward space to live in. Close company does breed over-familiarity, so you'll start to notice glaring personality defects that weren't evident before. And you may get split along moral and philosophical lines such as ethics, e.honor, the Code, and carebearism.
---
Someone was listening to the stream yesterday and relaying in comms. It sounded like Goons were getting hit hard. Also, he kept laughing because the same Ragnarok kept counter dropping and pushing them off. Anyway- here is my take. If the dude isn't banned right now and isn't input broadcasting as of now/further notice... let the guy play? If the guy is still input broadcasting, ban away. Cheating is cheating.
---
Use to play sc2  at a competitive level and was already consider by an user of input broadcasting from 1 guy because I was doing 2 super ratting etc... some people can't believe some player are fast 
---
This... is progress...
---
Brilliant video. You can see so much well executed things going on, some terrible things, and the on-field maneuvering was really nice to view and unfold. 
---
No ping, just the fireside.  tl;dr, us lot are dumb as bricks, don't risk bluefucking because your dumbass can't tell a bot from a person.
---
Which this sub has more or less borne out repeatedly.

It helps that Tisiphone was a member of CODE.

widotting isn't a great solution for social groups but consolidating all of your people under one alliance makes it a lot easier to organize and apply organizational decisions to everyone
---
not to mention having just one alliance having all of your sov makes it much easier for you to defend it all

so you have to ask yourself, which is more cancer, widotting or requiem eternal?

Bro you are like a flat earther denying evidence atm.

This is what I mean when I say goons have a cult mentality.

Dock up your faction titans don’t want goonswarm to get an easy isk win.

Find something of meterial or strategic value and attack/reinforce it. This can range from Engineering Complexes with lots of materials, key structures for logistics, mobility, or staging, or even placing your own structure in a place that leaves the enemy vulnerable. 
---
Probably some of the better ones to do at first are structures like TCUs, IHUBS, jump gates, beacons, etc. these will give you an idea of what kind of response you’ll get later. Make sure to do your intel homework beforehand as well otherwise you may just waste time on a target that is too heavily defended or not of much value.

If that was the case, Horde/NC. wouldn't be coming back again and again for OPs in highsec

Considering Horde had way higher market fees than us, and considering the utter shitload of isk we make, Horde has lost a ton. I’d ask your leadership where all that money went, because it didn’t go to help the line members.
---
Damn, I hadn't thought about that. The Culture would probably give Imperium a run for their money. Thanks for reminding us of those fine, scheming, plotting, subverting, manipulating sons of bitches in one of humanity's futures!
---
So we should report bots with support tickets? Or with the report bot button? Or with an email to ccp security?
---
And if you can tell? There are some who it's pretty easy to tell with.
---
Ofc it was intentional. Saying you could achieve some pretty interesting effects and positions back then that won't work anymore.

Goons don't deflect. Ironically by posting this you are deflecting from your own tendency to deflect.

You see MULTIPLE rorqs pull in their drones. That means MULTIPLE results per 1 action. Hence why it's not allowed.
---
If you do this, you'll get banned at some point. I'd suggest stopping
---
Then what are we gonna do with all our free time on r/eve without all the THIS IS A BOT CCP PLZBAN posts?
---
If you're getting .01 isk'd really hard, generally that means that the market is over supplied on that item. Leave the order be for a week and see if the market comes back to you on it before adjusting again. It hurts your velocity of money, but that's why you can train more market order  slots.
---
PI isn't that bad once you set it up if you live out in null. You can run week long extraction programs and top off factory planets every couple days. 
---
I find VNI ratting soul crushing lately with ~70% or more chance of drone agro per site. It takes forever to warp out, eject, try again, fail, close and re-open client, try again  / repeat to get it clear. Maybe when my alt is in a rorq and my main in a hulk, it will be a bit better. 
---
At the moment dual boxing retrievers next to corp mate's rorq's for compression is pretty good income in an ice belt. At least you've got some folks to chat with while you watch netflix / youtube. 
---
You forgot to take a Polaroid of your screen and mail that to ccp headquarters. CCP Watson will then analyze it with CCP Holmes and from there they will deduce an outcome.
---
It’s definitely possible to tell. My hobby is finding and then nuking any bots in Test. You have ESIs for all of them, and there’s a lot of blatant signs. Plus a lot of them actually straight up confess when asked so it makes it even easier.
---
If you ever have intel on bots in Test, hit me up.
---
Prepare to be purged, blooder filth.
---
At this point its better to just call the police.
---
With x-mouse and a lot of screen real-estate (or an efficient window manager like ISBoxer) there's no need to alt-tab at all. Hovering the mouse over a window is enough to move focus so you can issue the drone recall command to each one in quick succession. I doubt you could do it as quickly as the guy in the video did though.
---
I'm not convinced it was input broadcasting. The OP might of just been reported in intel or some other shit.

Don't think the mining missions are lucrative at all, unless you value the LP and standings.

You can either suck rocks in regular belts and anomalies or you can look for athanors on moons in 0.5 space and steal those rocks. 
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose, and don't funnel all your SP into the dead-end mining tree. Keep in mind that EVE is a multiplayer PvP game and you should be planning to grow beyond highsec before you get stuck in a rut [like this guy did](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/alp94q/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_january/efk7sf6/?context=3).

Honestly, unless you are completely against it, the best way to learn all this is from another person...

Learning each of the nuances of each race and or ammo type or  weapons platform and or the craziness of tiericide in EvE is nearly impossible to do just by reading online wikis and what not. 
---
22 hours from now, there maybe a post about '1 day since DSON isnt banned by CCP and kicked from GOONS'
---
here's the basic, basic version
---
short range:
---
blasters are highest dps shortest range best tracking. use some cap
---
autocannons are a bit longer range, track nearly as well, use no cap, but get their range mostly from falloff, so closer means more damage for most ranges
---
pulse lasers are the longest range short range weapons, with the worst tracking and dps and use the most cap. but they shoot really goddamn far for a short range weapon and switch ammo instantly and have very good ammo options 
---
long range:
---
beam lasers are basically pulse lasers but longer with less dps. these are generally the shortest total range of the long range weapons, but almost all of it is optimal range so you don't lose damage until the very end. use a lot of cap
---
Artillery are the next longest, get a ton of their range from falloff and track awful and fire super slow but hit like a truck. shit dps but if you 1 volley stuff it still died. no cap
---
railguns are usually the actual longest range with good dps and okish tracking, but low alpha. use some cap
---
of the above weapons only autocannons and Artillery have selectable damage types. both hybrid turrets (blasters and rails) and energy turrets (pulse and beams) have different ammo choices that trade damage for range. projectile weapons (ac and arty) have 3 range groups that trade range for damage, and the middle one gives more tracking than the other two
---
Renting is a way for highsec carebear corp CEOs to move into nullsec, with its much higher earning potential, without losing control over their corp.
---
If you ignore the "subtle" propoganda, that video really isn't half bad. Thank you CCP for making space so gawd dam shiny!
---
Thanks.  I’ve spent much of the last year working on improving its reliability.  I’ll certainly be looking into the provenance of this amazing work of art in the morning.  ;)
---
When I contacted CCP through that method, they told me to use the in-game report bot feature instead, or email [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com). The ticket was then closed.

Hi Falcon. I submitted a ticket for a rorqual broadcaster case about six months ago. The GM told me that they don't handle these cases, and I should mail to the security team. You can access the GM logs under my mains name, Olmeca Gold. I sent a mail and got no response at all. He also wasn't sure whether "report bot" button works for these cases.
---
Did your operational flowchart change or is it possible you don't know how CCP handle these things? I'm just asking a clarification of what to do in these cases. "Report bot" button, submit support ticket, or mail to teamsecurity? I asked this question in a CCP reddit AMA before and got no answer as well.

Make sure you use kinetic.

Eve players can return to munching rocks now!
---
Why do I feel that you’re triggered by that 😂
---
Same issue, basically. Most of you might already know, but Imperium in 40k has lost a lot of the scientific knowledge previously collected by humanity. Thusly, they refer to any reliable, accurate, not-exploding-in-your-hands piece of advanced equipment as holy, or a relic. Plasma weapons can be manufactured, but the ones left over from before the Age of Strife are precious relics, because they are actually more accurate, more powerful, less prone to malfunctions compared to the ones manufactured by the Adeptus Mechanicus in 40k. Still, the "inferior" versions produced in 40k are still very powerful and devastating; and when going up against soul eating demons, 5 meter tall cybernetically enhanced green monsters, immortal machines imprinted with consciousness or a mass of writhing tentacles, claws and teeth, having a one-in-a-hundred chance for your weapon to explode sounds pretty good odds, right? Now, apply that principle to every piece of sufficiently advanced equipment out there and you end up with normal Power Armour and ***The Armour Indomitus,*** which has been the original upon which every piece of powered armor is based. Or you can apply it to the battleships of the Imperial Navy and ***Divine Right***, flagship of the famous Gothic Armada during the events we see in the game.

If goons KNOW of specific accounts/corps that are botting, why aren't you people DOING something about it? I'm expecting to see something impressive before they extract and delete their accounts, ie MINILUV blowing them all up in a sanctioned attack by The Mittani. Or maybe it doesn't bother you... or you approve of it...

Damn the downvotes, It seems that this forum is infested with people going through midlife crisis and a bunch of old farts smh

it's because eve is dead

grr g0n?

TBH expected much bigger impact when those where introduced.      
---
Yet there is nothing moving around fleets to the extent they are making huge impact.            
---
From what i can say EVE got better - as this 1hour before timer move was significantly reduced - allowing the game to be less cancerous . 
---
if gankers can get 20 accounts to shoot in 2 seconds it's easily possible that rorq miners can recall drones in 2 seconds.
---
If you look at the velocities, they're given the recall command over 3 server ticks, which is 4 accounts per second
---
easily doable
---
so it's moving towards its natural price
---
&gt; Yet there is nothing moving around fleets to the extent they are making huge impact.

then you are not playing the game

Botting, scripting, rmting, account sharing and threatening people is against the eula and tos as well. You don't see nullsec people in charge being punished for any of that so why should something like this be punished when nothing else is? And how would ccp make a correlation between a reddit account and a character/account in eve online? If they go by sheer comments of other people on reddit than why aren't they banning/punishing all those people involved in rmt/botting that have been reported via ccp's way and have been reported on reddit as well?
---
All it needs it phage legs and that shit is straight outta Toy Story

Holy shit we should should completely trash the drone regions if this happens.

Just a twitch, but still movement nonetheless.
---
From 0 m to optimal, you never miss because of range, and you have the best chance at making good damage hits. You can still miss because of tracking. Past optimal, not only do you start to miss more and more as the range increases, but the damage of hits drops.
---
At optimal + falloff you miss because of range about 60% of the time. This is considered the max usable range.
---
Note that optimal + 1/2 falloff is about 80% hit, and recommended as the max operating range.
---
At optimal + 2 * falloff you miss almost all the time because of range. This is the max range, but it isn't very useful.
---
The weapon characteristics are racial:  Gallente vs. Caldari,  Amarr vs. Minmatar.
---
Gallente weapons counter Caldari, and vice versa.  Amarr weapons counter Minmatar, and vice versa.
---
Gallente are in-your-face the highest DPS with blasters.  Caldari are the highest DPS at extreme range with railguns and missiles (trivia:  missiles were originally not intended to be a primary weapon system), though extreme ranges are no longer practical for combat.
---
Amarr are, for the majority, slower heavily armored ships.  Minmatar are fast moving shield tanks.  Minmatar weapons have a ton of falloff to allow them versatility of engagement range.  Amarr lasers can instantly change crystals for different ranges, but they have almost no falloff, so always operate in optimal (best damage). 
---
* Autocannons have a short optimal and deep falloff. They are typically used in falloff, around optimal + 1/4 falloff.
---
* Artillery have a moderate optimal and a huge falloff. They are typically used in falloff, around optimal + 1/2 falloff.
---
* Lasers have a moderate optimal and very short falloff. They are typically used within optimal, at very close to optimal.
---
* Railguns have a moderate optimal and a moderate falloff. They are typically used at optimal to optimal + 1/2 falloff.
---
* Blasters have a very short optimal and very short falloff. They are typically used at point-blank range. 
---

You have a macro on your keyboard that will broadcast a key action to multiple windows at once? If your keyboard has software that supports that, it's equivalent to using ISBoxer's, where the software is located is irrelevant.

Agreed. Ansiblex were the last thing we needed in eve 
---
No players should ever have to deal with bots, other than pointing them out/reporting them. That’s fucking ridiculous.
---
It’s entirely up to the developers to preserve the integrity of their game... and based off the past, CCP clearly doesn’t give a shit about botting. This is hundreds of dollars worth (if not thousands) of investments into bots in this one rorq gang but CCP would obviously rather take their money than ban them.

Oh, no no no... see, he was alt-tabbing at a super human speed.. haven't you seen the guys stream that was entirely pre-recorded and edited?? See, you are wrong. You don't see what is happening. Just like the Goon-alt CODE. 25-man hisec gank fleets.. NO broadcast-inputting here.. nope... alt-tabbing, targeting, firing.. ALL SEPARATE. 
---
The truth here is, Goon RMT + Omega Accts = CCP getting their cut of RMT and money from Omegas. End of story. 
---
The issue here isn't cheating or more Goon-CCP corruption that has existed in all of my 10 year in Eve. No the issue is purely about $$$$.
---
Don't ansiblexes only have a small ammount of health and only one ref timer and take forever to construct and require both sov and a lot of system upgrades to setup? Not seeing an "easily spammed" structure there.
---
Outlined one instance of it being used which impacted you and thus must be changed for the good of all mankind.
---
You're likely right that denial of income for Horde is the #1 priority for TEST getting into the High-sec markets,   especially with the Imperium going after the renter-space in TKE at the same time.  However, making serious money is certainly close second on the list.  
---
The fact that TAPI is doing this at all in a pretty solid indication that they're not super confident in their hi-sec strategy will succeed, especially with the failure of the Oijanan deployment, and their eastern front heating up of late.

Passive selling BPC is a good investement  but like many have statted before , it takes a long time to get a return on investement . 
---
Think about it this way , if the BPO is cheap ,  and does not require more then 1 month to research. Then anybody can do exacly what you did and sell copies. The good BPO investement then come to the ones that take  atleast a good while to Research and  are often used.  However those BPO tend to be a costy investement as a single one can cost around a Billion isk.  They are some Mid range priced ones  but you also have to consider how saturated the market is.  Personally I do make isk out of BPC sales. But even after putting about 5 billion isk into it ( mostly mid ranged priced BPO's of comodity ) I only make a small passive isk of it . Seeding a NS market will make for a quicker return on investement. 
---
These are good points I can get behind. Its most likely the easy way out to reduce operations on a front they dont want to invest the ressources in right now.
---
Yes I did it, so it is designed to make you taste the bitter of loosing a ship for the first time?, If so, Maquiavelo works at CCP games

Just to clarify:
---
This used condom of a plan they have in mind was in the works for years. First codename was Cheburashka (Чебурашка), several alternatives followed. They will never come to implement the whole thing, the show is set up just for our corrupt government to steal all the funding for these projects. Media here likes to keep it quiet on the topic, it seems that western media loves these kind of news though.

You use them to get from your staging straight to 46dp which puts you 1 jump from their space... not to mention all the rest of legacy jump gates...

Pop the ihub, no more ansiblex for 35 days.
---
Disregarding all context, I agree that everyone here is an old fart
---
Yeah and TAPI did such a good job of maintaining their hi-sec keep all on their own! 
---
Yes because I cannot speak from anyone's experience besides my own.
---
If i take your flair as an example - your JB network makes it so that is 8 fatigueless jumps (accessible to capitals) to cover the entirety of fountain from one end to another. A route that would previously have taken 18 jumps or several fatigued bridges.
---
This makes projection - especially in an age of nominally allied blocs across the map - exceedingly powerful. My personal example had to do with WinterCo's JB network allowing you to teleport several regions across the SE - I'm sure if you were using your JB network to flash form and deploy across the entire western portion of the game and it effected me I could speak on it.  
---
They should know better not to take everything said on the internet so serious tho haha
---
You will be able to do things that give you a sense of achievement.
---
You also will likely miss a lot of the game.  It's really complicated, so having experienced people guide you for a while is a good idea.
---
So, a common recommendation is to do the tutorial and the career agents, then go join one of the mega-alliances (Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde). They have the infrastructure in place to teach you everything about the game that you might be interested in doing.  You and your friend will be able to pretty much spend as much of your time as you want doing your own thing.  "You must come to this fleet" events are pretty rare.
---
Once you've got a handle on what the game offers and how it works, just do whatever you and your friend decide is fun.  Stay in a mega-alliance, join a small one, strike out on your own, or whatever else you want to do.
---
TZs brother. 
---
Thankfully my carebear krabbing alliance doesn't use these to bring fights to the north on a near daily basis because I hate PvP.
---
How do you figure missiles ignore range and tracking? Missiles definitely have a range, and they have two types of “tracking”: explosion velocity and explosion radius which are effected by the speed and signature radius of the enemy ship. You don’t just “hit or not hit”. 
---
&gt;So you are seriously advocating that folks spend hours on move ops instead of being able to actually play
---
It is extremely simple to not spend hours covering the same portion of the game - it does have strategic consequences however (jump reactivation timer). 
---
If fatigueless teleportation wasn't an issue - phoebe would not be a patch. 
---
Sweeeeet sweeeeeet irony from a TAPI scrub :'D
---
So the good news is that Forkrul and his FCs have now got a scout volunteer. He'll be ideal covering a system in advance of the fleet and holding there since which also handily saves him from the moral quandry of taking Legacy / XIX jump gates.
---
That's what they call "home field advantage." Build your own and out maneuver your own Invaders.
---
I'm sure my enemies would complain about our ability to move our forces without consequence across large distances as well.

I agree they are really broken, they are a key part in the success of the defense of geminate against tapi.
---
Also is really broken when an entity controls a lot of space because it allows easy access to far away Wormholes without problems, an example is how easy goons from 1dq get to geminate/kalevala.

We're going to the timers we're going to regardless of how long it takes.  The fact we can do it quicker is just QOL.
---
probably easier to type than a whole new paragraph on the difference between guns and missiles, and how missiles work, and how part of their range is rng based, and how their range actually depends on the vector of the target as the missiles chase which means shooting at something within range might still not land a hit, etc

Its a thing.  Ive only ever hears of it in r/EVE and in-game.  Its a thing where CCP  anticipates the "time from feature release until some EVE player uses that feature to draw/make a penis" e.g
---
 - using mobile depots to make a phallic shape in space,  etc… 
---
&gt; We're going to the timers we're going to regardless
---
I do not think so. If a very quick option or the chance of having a slower return was present I do not believe you would risk the blueballs without moving closer. 
---
The other interesting thing is how TEST's actions have brought a LOT of attention to just how much cash is available through controlling the off-shoring markets.   
---
From what I've read/heard, it was a known thing that there was profit in Perimeter, but that it was 500 billion/month wasn't exactly common knowledge. Going forward I'm expecting more of the large null-sec alliances interested in competing for Perimeter. 
---
Still not seeing the problem it's not like you are deploying them in enemy territory they only allow the defenders to get around.
---
If you’re not gonna use a rubber, it’ll be an extra $20
---
Are you a Goon? No. Report away then.
---
But these kind of portraits make the game better, not worse. 
---
sounds like waste of time...
---
The lack of fatigue on these makes life far harder for roaming folks, the lack of any sort of timer or jump prevention via tackling makes them safer than normal gates, and the ability to move not just subcap but also capital fleets across several regions in less than 15 minutes is absolutely terrible in terms of increasing the oppressiveness of large groups over small ones.
---
If you're going to make these things broken as hell the least you could do is make them very expensive / expensive to maintain. Instead, the fuel for them is basically dirt.
---
17 Jumps -&gt; 5 jumps is actually pretty meh in terms of time saving too. There are some spots that save far more.
---
Im actually wondering still, why similar markets havent been conquered at least
---
Thank you for your compliment.
---
They can be placed on grid with a fortizar or keepstar, which means that in terms of defensive capability they are far scarier than a jump bridge POS ever was, and it isn't as easy to generate a timer out of TZ for the enemy.
---
1. You could theoretically deploy them in hostile space - they do not require ownership of the IHUB just the presence of the upgrade.
---
2. Mass ease of movement without consequence was explicitly nerfed in Phoebe because it allowed to much power projection both offensively and defensively. It is very simple for people with jump bridges to use the ones present in their space to set up attacks in a manner that is unbalanced - I outlined one such case in my OP. That defenders can and do do so as well doesn't somehow make it better - it compounds the issue. 
---
But but...goons don't bot!! Those are lies!! Init renters don't bot either...except for the countless VNIs and couple of NYXes...
---
Its only a problem when someone else does it and the reddit brigade starts posting like mad. When Imperium Bots...all is good...no bots here...no sir...we are honest people...
---
Depends on the size of the alliance but JBs tend to get fights because of how fragile they are, and how important they can be to navigating larger regions
---
Yeah, there are routes in GSF for handling this stuff as well that involve passing things to people with more resources and less of a chance of being a mouthbreather.
---
Something had to be done, I’ve not been in null since these were introduced, but first they went crazy extreme with fattygay, and it would appear that they’ve done the same in the other direction.

Cause let’s be honest, hours of fatigue is fucking laaaaaame.

---
Are you sure?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCz3BBfmPE
---
It's actually quite significant when you account for the minimized warping distance as well. 
---
Because we want to capture objectives and not have fights.
---
The point is that if you want to fight but have managed to blue everyone within a 3 region radius, maybe you should face some consequences for that choice.
---
If you live 1 region away from your enemies then jump bridges aren't really necessary, are they?
---
They fired the guy who handled it and they forgot to request he turn over the email account for billboards.

So instead they'll release new upwell propaganda displays at some point, and you'll email propaganda@ccpgames.com

Watch Jason Kusion's stream if he is on twitch sometime. He doesn't input broadcast 25 catalysts and shows how he does it for all to see. This is all just more whining about bots and goons.
---
That we use them has not escaped my notice but I cannot speak for my enemies lol. 
---
I know... I was just making a point
---
&gt; hours of fatigue is fucking laaaaaame
---
It is capped at 5 hours with 30 minute reactivation - that's not terrible considering the chain jumping required to accrue that amount. 
---
I don't think that you guys understand that there is more to this game than just money. Controlling High Sec markets causes burn out. Doesn't matter how much isk you are making if eventually you guys burn out and lose the market. What do you think Horde is doing. They are putting in the lowest amount of effort in order to create the maximum amount of burnout. Eventually you guys will quit just like you guys quit in Geminate. 
---
If you deploy one in a hostile system there are easy ways to shut it down for the defenders.  It's not a viable offensive tactic, just a cute way to deny the defender a jump gate for a few hours.
---
I think CCP should charge for this service, just like rent. 1B per month.
---
Right, but here is the thing. We have capital and sub-capital fleets on both ends. It's just a deathclone to one hub or a jump to the other. Your argument feels a lot more like "we can't fight these people if they show up" and that is not bashing you, but it's not the same problem. The lack of fatigue realistically is just saving time on the return trip, because the fleet would still relatively rage jump to get into combat.
---
Yeah, you're fucking crazy then.
---
You have no idea how far we've flown to blueball ourselves.
---
Reinforces in 4 minutes at max dps and dies in another 4 minutes whenever it comes out of reinforce. Literally undefendable if someone wants it dead.

What do you have against the Vandals? They were a proud Germanic tribe.
---
So many stupid motherfuckers that refuse to see a difference between botting and input broadcasting.
---
9 more years and we are adults. :-)
---
You need to read your own posts, and mine again, because you already agreed with me.
---
Missiles do not have tracking.  We agree on that, you even quoted it, signify it wasn't actually tracking, but rather something similar.
---
Missiles are binary:  they don't have a  hit quality like turrets, i.e. glancing vs. wrecking.  They always skip that part of the equation and do 100% damage, which can be reduced by target speed and signature. 
---
I mentioned explosion velocity, which you agreed.
---
I skipped explosion radius, because all weapons are affected by signature, so it isn't special to missiles.
---
Agree to disagree then, my dude. I’ve always felt fatigue was a very poor solution to one of the larger “balance” issues at the time. 
---
I love my fellow TESTicles!
---
I look forward to the increasing sperg in year 10
---
No my point that they can move such a distance in minutes to gank something is silly considering when they arrive at their destination that trip was not hampered in any way by fatigue OR time spent gating.
---
There is zero strategic consequence of projecting in the manner that they do. We actually have no problem generally fighting them. 
---
"Here capsuleer, a free ship. You should probably insure it... for reasons"
---
&gt; Mass ease of movement without consequence was explicitly nerfed in Phoebe because it allowed to much power projection both offensively and defensively. 
---
[If you go back and read it the changes are pretty explicitly targeted at moving capital ships arbitrarily.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/phoebe-travel-change-update)
---
Jump bridges on poses were affected because they pretty obviously use the same bridging code as titans use (insert poscode meme here.) I'm not sure they intended to restrict pos jump bridges like they did since it seems like an unintended side effect and they deprecated them and introduced a structure to bypass the problem entirely (the ansiblex.)
---
Keep in mind which account you have each alt on.  I ended up with my in-corp hauler and out-of-coup hauler on the same account, and it's a bit of a hassle.

If you would've anyway, congratulations. Willpower doesn't excuse the presence of (or lack thereof in this case) tradeoffs though. 
---
You can bomb targets between 16k and 44k due to the 15k radius of the bomb.
---
Why does the corax have a visible drone bay in the model but no drones???? Reeeew
---
&gt;Ships in the following groups gain a 90% reduction to effective distance traveled: industrial, blockade runner, deep space transport, freighter, industrial command ship, capital industrial ship, jump freighter.
---
This eases the impact of these changes on alliance logistics for the time being. We would like to remove these bonuses in future, but we don’t feel nullsec industry is in a sufficiently strong place that it would be prudent to do so right now.
---
I don't know if I should upvote because it's funny, because I agree, because you're a wormholer or if I should downvote you because of grammar.

They can project that power within their own borders, sure. If you let them build ansiblex in your systems and into your back areas- that would be a bad decision.

If they’d let me download the raw data, so I could use MATLAB to apply frequency windows to eliminate high and low frequency noise in the data, I could then do an FFT to each windowed dataset, and be able to tell with a much higher degree of accuracy if there was or was not a transit. I do these things for my solar physics irl job anyway, so yeah, clicking all over the place, with no real means of reducing noise, is worth min-maxing, ‘cause that’s not an effective way to get good results anyway.

Being able to project full blob power right across the cluster is definitely a problem. Maybe you don't see that if you're in the blob.
---
They seem to have felt it was unnecessary to iterate on. Fatigue itself was iterated on several times after it proved unnecessarily oppressive in its release. Not sure what that has to do with your "capital only" patch though because bridge mechanics kept and still have their fatigue. 
---
They only added the exception in this most recent patch which is very evidently swinging too far the other direction.  
---
Sir, we are trying to have a birthday party over here.. could you please keep your BOOOO-ing to a minimum, ;)
---
Unhealthy by means that more fights happen and more things die?
---
Your title is misleading at best. You're dropping the rates because you can't compete with the public Azbels if you don't.
---
You can offline the upgrade in your IHUB and laugh at the now broken gate. Pheobe was a horrible patch for just about everyone but small gang entities. The new Jump Gates allow you to project predominately defensively at a greatly increased sov and fuel costs. Its not currently broken and if it is for you can you RF a few of theirs in an off time zone to force them to form/save them. If they manage to anchor a foothold one in your sov or you allow a spy to link yours to theirs thats on you.
---
Alt Tab + Middle mouse button X 12. I spam local and hit the same "Second" about 3 times max, no way these guys are NOT input broadcasting

That's such a simplistic way to put it. Capital projection does not 'make the game less shit' for the guy that gets dropped on because it's so easy to project.
---
Yes. I trust you're familiar with the PL hotdropping everything that moves meme. 
---
This accomplishes the same absolute degree of control within your own space and eases the strain of deploying massive fleets across the map to the point that less (meaningful) fights will ultimately happen. I'm sure there are more funfleets to catch or something but arranged pvp being the primary mode of pvp isn't exactly great.

Yes congratulations that doesn't actually respond to anything though. 
---
I read your comment an clicked it anyway while at starbucks haha
---
SHe must pilot a bumping mach
---
Please don't change anything on your end. We are having an absolute blast.
---
Thanks they came out pretty good 
---
You forgot to say that triglavian guns have the best everything of short range guns (damage/tracking/rate of fire and even alpha because lol wrecking shots) and compete with long range guns till the 30-70 km mark. Oh and no they don’t have any downsides against non npcs since their damage profile makes them solid against all t2 profiles anyway. Also lol balance. 
---
I said Good Day Sir! lol
---
Vitals and Instrumentals also spawn in shattered wormholes of all classes.
---
You'll be back. EvE is like herpes it's never out of your system it just lays dormant until a flare up  
---
hint: they dont care.
---
lmao, found the whiney little dude that got wrecked by a trig ship.
---
Fun fact, that trig ship, like a drek, does around 400dps to 52km after about 50 seconds.
---
Brutix Navy issue does 550dps at the start, to 53km. 
---
&gt;Taking the performance of the new XMPP system into consideration after the changes in January, the decision has been made not to revert to the older LSC system and to continue to develop and tweak the new system going forward.
---
And
---
&gt; We’re happy to announce that in the coming weeks, the highest skillpoint character on every account that held Omega clone status as of the start of daily downtime on March 20th, 2018 (the day the chat system was deployed) will receive a gift of 500,000 skillpoints in their unallocated skillpoint pool.
---
It's a gate that requires permission from the owner of both ends. It is not a jump bridge. There needs to be about a dozen more across New Eden to facilitate more content. Are you crying because you can't control what you want to control anymore??
---
lol pax, learn to manage your mods :D
---
I was to say here before northern QQ but it's already begun.
---
&gt; It makes it really convenient for everyone to move whatever fleet they want to move.
---
Which is bad. It constricts local conflict, increases the speed with which one entity needs to accomplish anything (in an age of absolute timers whether they be PANIC or DPS caps), and theoretically allows larger parties to involve themselves in something they'd have had to have previously consciously moved towards to a degree that stifles actual fighting. 
---
It's not been that shit recently.
---
Thanks for the SP.
---
gf,i pressed approch instead of keep at range,shit happens
---
enjoy it
---
but is this really worth a reddit post ? makes me feel important
---
what
---
Eh it's had it's up and down. One guy had 2 toons showing different amount +/- 1
---
congratz, you got it
---
but you can tz tank all the stuff they want to shoot
---
where
---
If you read the whole txt in the add, I was referring to the bots mining...
---
counterpoint: fuck off
---
Thank you
---
Wait ... what?  The EULA changed again?
---
Perhaps a very slight overstatement?
---
A nuisance at best lmao
---
Don't
---
Our rates are much lower, even at .3% they were lower than anything before it. No one cares about the name on the building if it has lower rates.
---
why?
---
&gt;GRAND OPENING (again)
---
Oh boy!
---
You really need to settle on what you want to hunt, and where. 
---
WH hunting fits and ships will vary than k-space fits, and more importantly the style of what you want to do. 
---
If you want to do solo black ops, there are some viable panther, sin, and widow fits. (Unsure of redeemer) . Targets will involve battleships, small mining groups, and anything smaller you catch.  Stay away from fleets and caps.  Required ships: Blops and hunter.
---
WH hunting will vary if you are in a group or solo.  You can cloaky roam all over wh space and maybe find content but it is much harder to do.  Easier is to rage roll a static with friends for content.  Ships: Vary widely
---
Null sec you can choose to go fast and use nano, catching and killing what you can, but you need to stay mobile and be very grid aware.  Multiboxing multiple nano ships is wicked hard.  Easier to solo or friends.  
---
Honestly what you fly and hunt is really up to you.  The game is much harder for solo and small gang now, but it makes victory that much sweeter.  
---
So reading what you have here, I would honestly suggest as follows:
---
* Find a group you want to hunt.  
---
* Research them, where they live, what they rat in, how fast their response is. 
---
* At the same, time, use the third account to make a clean toon and start building some history.  
---
* Get this toon into the group you want to hunt and use the blue spy to drop your red toons on them.  (Look at John Drees videos for explanation. ) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glDlo8pjlP8]  
---
* Drop your hunter and solo Blops and hunt. 
---
Barring that, it is significantly easier to find a group who does what you want to do and jin them.  Many hands make more content. 
---
I suspect they'd care about it the same amount.
---
The real winners are high sec. The Trade Wars finally allows everyone in high sec to have very low rates in trading. Typically only reserved for people who could drop their own Azbel, now everyone gets low rates.
---
Don't forget to mention your favourite flavour of ice-cream, or it will be rejected.
---
&gt; Its not currently broken
---
Deklein can be crossed in 9 jumps fatiguelessly and would be 6 JBs worth of fatigue or 29 jumps. I have a feeling you use them every day to seamlessly respond to aggression
---
I genuinely appreciate the way this has been handled since 2019 began. They fessed up to dropping the ball, made up-front devblog posts to fill everyone in on what was happening and how they wanted to make amends, and then they apparently did some real good work to follow through with that.
---
Fundamentally, I'm glad they got the XMPP system working enough that they can keep iterating on its improvement: it would've been a kick in the teeth to have to roll back to the older system and get stuck with it for who-knows-how-long.
---
**Full Post for anyone unable to view it.**
---
On January 9th, we released a New Year update regarding the chat system after a range of issues since its deployment with the March 2018 release.
---
Since that blog, we’ve seen several major backend deployments that have been targeted directly at problems that the community have reported with chat. These issues have ranged from connectivity to the chat cluster, to incorrect population counts in local and incorrect pilot data in the local member list.
---
Two of the largest of these deployments were on Tuesday, January 8th and Wednesday, January 16th, which focused on bringing stability to the chat cluster and improving its performance.
---
The first deployment on January 8th focused on how the system deals with pilots switching channels moving from system to system. The second on the 16th was focused on an overhaul of how initial presence is delivered when pilots join a large chat channel such as local in Jita.
---
Since the deployment on the 16th, we’ve seen a period of stability where reports regarding issues with the chat system have dissipated, and the number of bug reports and support tickets relating to issues with chat has dropped to an all-time low since the new system was deployed in March 2018.
---
ONGOING WORK
---
The chat system and the issues that have occurred over the course of the last 10 months have been the subject of a lot of inward facing questions here at CCP.
---
There’s been a substantial amount of internal discussion, looking at everything from how the system was developed, how it was deployed, how it was communicated and how we responded to the issues that were raised by the community both in terms of development and communication.
---
The result is; we understand and accept the fact that we failed on both fronts. We also understand the gravity of the effects it had on the day to day activity of many of our pilots.
---
The work carried out in January was targeted specifically to address community concerns in key areas where the chat system was not performing as expected and we’re happy to see that while there are some small issues we still need to iron out, stability and performance has been improved drastically.
---
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
---
When we gave the last update on January 9th, we mentioned that we’d be deciding whether to continue to operate the XMPP service or revert back to the old system at the start of February, based on performance of chat after several large-scale fixes and improvements of the course of January.
---
Taking the performance of the new XMPP system into consideration after the changes in January, the decision has been made not to revert to the older LSC system and to continue to develop and tweak the new system going forward.
---
As we’ve previously explained, overhauling the chat system is a vital part of the future-proofing work that’s going into EVE, which also includes the retirement of old systems such as player owned structures and the introduction of a 64-bit client, the latter of which will be upon us soon.
---
This work is occurring so that we can continue to keep New Eden up to date, improving the health of EVE and reducing legacy technical overhead as we head toward celebrating EVE’s 20th anniversary and the start of the third decade. Operating an XMPP chat system opens up all manner of possibilities for more tools and access to EVE’s chat system in the future.
---
We want to continue to work with the community to iron out any issues that people may still have with the XMPP system and make sure that we continue to improve performance going forward.
---
The team working on the development of the chat system will be watching the feedback thread for this blog closely, and if any of our pilots have been experiencing issues from the start of February onwards, we’d like to hear about them so as we can look at clearing up any outstanding problems.
---
In the update we gave on January 9th, we also mentioned distribution of compensation for the issues that have occurred.
---
We’re happy to announce that in the coming weeks, the highest skillpoint character on every account that held Omega clone status as of the start of daily downtime on March 20th, 2018 (the day the chat system was deployed) will receive a gift of 500,000 skillpoints in their unallocated skillpoint pool.
---
Keep your eyes peeled for news on the distribution of this compensation in the coming weeks.
---
We’d like to apologize again for the substantial disruption that the chat issues have caused over the course of 2018. We fully understand that the severity of issues with the system was not fully realized early enough. This was clearly identified when we looked back over the events of 2018 and has been addressed.
---
As always, we’d love feedback on this blog and we’d love to hear if any of our pilots are still experiencing issues as of the start of February.
---
Be sure to leave any feedback and comments you might have in the comments thread for this blog. Pilots should also be sure to file a bug report if they’re still seeing issues with the system at this stage.
---
Right up there with [GladOS](https://evewho.com/pilot/GladOS)
---
It's literally the definition of input broadcasting.
---
rorquals?
---
I hope there's no longer any way to intentionally keep your character name out of local chat like there was when this system was first implemented. 
---
hey man gf, you know I usualy die a lot, gotta share the good fights when they happen, nothing personal, no intention of bashing you or your corp. lost my last loki like yours to a curse.   
---
think on all those explorers and eve scout dudes you killed with that \^\^
---
cya around our home thera o7
---
True, but we just make our own cloning bays.
---
Whoops.
---
It's the "Change of Tempo" bargain sale!
---
That's right shoppers, to mark Test's ninth birthday the Tranquility Trading Towers has reduced its tax rates on traditional Test merch. Goon-themed batphones, half price! Dread wrecks 75% off! A sixty-volume set Brisc Rubal's memoirs, free to every visitor!
---
So stop shopping at the pop up Azbels and come by to TTT today. Offer runs out when Test runs away, so get in soon!
---
 \[21:07:51\] John Hartley &gt; Fuck you guys 
---
See i agree with the way is has been handled once they admitted they fucked up. but how about all the other stuff that is broken is the game that no one from CCP has made a comment about.
---
Oh, we weren't talking about PL dropping?
---
Well obviously I would.
---
I mean more the case of when one goon knows for like 99.9% sure it's a bot, he still shouldn't report it as that's goonfucking as it just maaaaaybe a real dude who has a certain penchant for ratting 20 hours a day 7 days a week.
---
This is sad.        
---
Working stuff ... for something with issues.   
---
Are you taking PR jobs? Because I hope you are not
---
All market orders and contracts are brought over from TQ. In the first hour of a mirror all the skill injectors are bought. It's been like this since 2010
---
In general, its a good idea to read the text of the mission and follow directions on the tutorial and career missions. Much later on, when you get other missions, and do them repeatedly you can skip a lot of it. O and heres a little tip: If you get a mission that tells you to pick up something, or carry something, always check its volume in the mission text, it will be listed there somewhere, then check how much cargo space your ship has before you start.
---
We are passing the savings off to you .. the consumer. I mean, we lower the tax rate for trading in Jita, aren't you happy with lower taxes? You can still pay the higher tax rates in the NPC station or pay the asset safety bills in the azbels if you wish. You have the opportunity to pay more out of spite if you want. (PS: I would buy some of that stuff, no joke lol)
---
I'm at level 45.
---
You are not human.
---
They really do seem broken, no argument.
---
But I still fundamentally like the idea of fatigueless jumps, within reason. While keeping the convenience factor of limiting jumps between friendly systems, and giving another (small) motivation to holding sov, perhaps the reinforce and deploy attributes for an Ansiblex could be tweaked to make it less of a threat when it comes to moving large fleets.
---
A larger damage cap and/or a longer deployment timer could mean that it becomes a reasonable tactic to take out some of your enemy's "supply line" Ansiblex network an hour before the big fight begins. Anything that puts more targets on more alliance assets is a good thing, IMO.
---
some type of logistics - on a ship or with trucking?
---
those are TZ tanked by not undocking
---
That's not PR. Everyone is getting dirt cheap rates now .... everyone. You don't have to "buy blue" to get good rates (I saw that one the other day), or be in ICY's corp to get good rates. The 2 person corp that had to pay .5% under Horde is now going to pay .1%.
---
and all the sell orders are filled even the ones for massively below the value of an injector eveon on TQ?
---
Whats a good fit for the pacifier for hacking and also hunting asteros on the side?
---
Sure, but the enemy of progress is perfection. They aren't fixing the entire game in the next patch, but on this one critical issue, they dun did gud.
---
i see, thanks. ill do that instead.
---
could we have the redeemable SP like over the holidays? i don't really train anything on my high sp characters anymore and the SP would be better served on other characters on the account
---
&gt;  Not sure what that has to do with your "capital only" patch though because bridge mechanics kept and still have their fatigue.
---
I didn't say capital only i said capital focused.
---
&gt;They only added the exception in this most recent patch which is very evidently swinging too far the other direction.
---
Which is why you should hold on to this complaint for when they are looking for feedback for a balancing pass. Don't forget about it and remake it for them when they ask for it. I expect that they will be looking into it soon.
---
Exactly
---
I started chuckling partway through at the thought of POS's going rogue or the guns going rogue 🤔
---
"Don't want to fuel this piece of shit, I'll blast all of it away! including our own POS shit!" -dude inside rogue POS guns probably... 
---
If you happen to own one of the few remaining high-sec carriers, yes. If I recall they are still 'legal' in high-sec if you own one, but it is illegal to sell them to anyone else unless you move it to low-sec (where it will not be allowed back into high sec). 
---
frigg off auto dweeb

lol you don't know me very well i say that ever where all the time thats not me crying, buddy.
---

I'd rather not

Well, After weighing effort vs. entertainment, I discovered I preferred focusing my energy on a spicy dig at your organization rather than rebuttal  a dumb argument.
---
Great video man. Also thanks for listing out the music. Well done.
---
looking forward to getting that gift in 2021
---
ahahaha krab calls out other krabs and the comments are F U M I N G
---
Is that really what your saying? The only thing worth buying, selling, and moving outside of Jita are Plex related things, all of which are pretty safe and easy to move. You're lowering your taxes because horde has been running the market out from under you, and trying to say that you're doing it for lowering prices for those buying in Jita? That's a top level backpedal if I have ever seen one. People aren't going to head over to your structure to buy ships and modules. It's all about the Plex markets that Horde has been holding onto.
---
Just admit that horde has given you a run for your money, (literally) and you had to adjust to stay competitive, instead of trying to act like this is some grand celebration.
---
Have you looked at Kalvala Expanse lmao? You guys have lost EVERY. SINGLE. IHUB. Except like maybe 3-4, you are now losing TCUs. I guess the hip trend in Horde is to just not pay attention and believe whatever whimsical narrative it is you guys come up with around the camp fire.
---
Could we also remove Manic Velocity and PL from the Billboards ? Thanks
---
All of these will lead to the same result, so go with whatever floats your boat. 
---
Someone's been playing too much System Shock 
---
I mean I was answering the question the simple way
---
saying trig guns have alpha because wrecking shots is stretching the truth even more than the test celebration thread 
---
I dont even know what the second thing means. they compete with long range guns at 30km? what? 
---
the best you can say about the damage type thing is that they don't shoot into anyone's strength I guess. shit for shooting drifters though 
---
to your point though, they do have pulse laser range with better than blaster tracking and better than anybody by 50 percent at least dps. they're pretty fucking insane, but the kicker is that they don't start with the damage. the difference in total damage output over time of a leshak vs, say, a vindicator, only goes in the leshaks favor after like a solid minute of shooting. presumably the target has caught reps by then and you have to switch. oh no now I have to ramp again
---
Lol'd in rl. 
---
You're taking a lot of credit for NC. And PH's work lol
---
It's not a players job to handle bots, friends. Your Northern Shithole is just crying because a) your mining is in Retrievers and your ratting in VNI's. It's not my fucking job to hunt for Bots. Now go back on Mama NC. Titties  and believe the story that just "bots" are the reason why the glorified North is down to their knees.
---
they did good after a solid year of it totally shitting the bed
---
wormholer btw. I love it. delete local
---
Does the Universe realizes that barely any Corp is paying Taxes to Goons from Mining ? Atleast not inside Goons ? I mean, I dont care if any random Idiot is botting with 100 Rorquals, and it is not our fucking job to handle bots.
---
All I hear is a loud outcry from some underdeveloped Entities, who fucked up massively after the Casino War. 
---
It's not that simple. Quite simply, there are a few bugs in the war dec system that make some structures un-killable. Full stop. So if someone knows about these bugs, we can't kill the structures no matter the effort or manpower. 
---
It is a metaphorical hand belonging to all those involved.  Alternatively, there were multiple slaps from each person involved.  The message is that a face has been slapped, and it is test's.
---
what's a better solution 
---
Wormhole chat mechanic question. If someone speaks in a wh in local, when is it that their name disappears? Is it when they leave the wh system? Log off? After a period of time?
---
this. very much this.
---
So accounts created after March 20th, 2018 don't get any SP? Weren't those people just as affected by the chat system problems over the past year?
---
If the average hordeling is completely oblivious tells you a lot doesn't it.
---
Honestly this kalevala thing has kind of been a waste of time. Thank God we can go for Sort again pretty soon
---
P.S. Now maybe do the math, when there is barely any SRP for DPS Ships etc in PL, NC, PH etc, where do they get their Replacement ? A bad person would say, they are buying the ISKIES for their toonies from exactly that "bots" we are talking about here.
---
So... let me ask you then.... did any of those bugs prevent you from killing that azbel you've fought over like 5 times now.
---
You're welcome.
---
lmfao nice
---
Exactly, there are 4 stages of code comments:
---
1. Comment every line to say what it does.
---
2. Comment "complex" bits sometimes but never update the comments when they become innacurate.
---
3. No comments, just try to write readable code.
---
4. Comments explaining the reasonning behind non-obvious sections or non-obvious limits to function/variable and kept up to date religiously.
---
Those who claim comments are bad have never encountered the 4th stage (or if they did, they didn't appreciate it.)
---
Surely its not pandemic horde, everyone across the universe and blues would drop on something like that.
---
Wait a second.. So if i created my account at the idk April 5th,2018 i dont get the sp? Or do i understand something wrong? 
---
[FUCKING CALLED IT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ae9x49/old_chat_system_may_come_back/edreist/?context=0), get fucked eve community, nno fucking chat for you...
---
The requirements to send a report to CCP is starting to feel like every jita scam. 
---
I don't think so, but I honestly can't remember either way. I'm just talking about the overall "azbel spam" comment. If you go to perimeter and see how many azbels there are .. there's a reason for that many, and it will only increase as time goes by and a lot of those have nothing to do with Horde or TEST.
---
Thats what ive thought too
---
&gt; the show is set up just for our corrupt government to steal all the funding for these projects.
---
Be careful, Puttie Poot hears what you type and he may take his shirt off at you.
---
I hope you get an answer for this, sincerely. And hopefully it's one that actually has a solution that works.
---
Is that so? Please list some examples. I've had notifications for ihubs being captured, but we've responded the vast majority of the time. And if we haven't, timers have been noted and toasters have been sent at a later date.
---
In the amarr space I get a fair bit of content from decent sized fleet ops / whelps to a lot of small gang, loose fleet and solo pvp. T1 is terrible and needs to get some kind of incentive for the underdog to at least try at going to T2. Amarr space is full of GalMil farmers looking for plexes to farm, about 1:1 right now GalMil to MinMil tbh.
---
Lots of pirates. About 1 in 4 of my fights are against a war target, the rest are against neutrals / pirates. The part of the warzone between Sahtogas and Huola is the busiest along with the Amamake constellation. Of course Amamake has always been a busy pvp arena with full-time resident pirates.

No, you are understanding that correctly. That's how it worked when they handed out the last 250k sp for this problem also.
---
Strong words coming from someone who uses a bug to protect their structures.
---
Chat is kill
---
Yea. I pretty much completely disagree with everything you've written here, and I guess being Razor, I shouldn't be surprised.
---
I mean, if you just want to hide in your little hole, and don't want people coming to you, yeah, they suck. But if you want to go get fights, they are pretty fucking nice.
---
Uni wiki doesn't have fun trivia though lmao.
---
I'm sure this is a common question, but how long after starting can I expect to be able to participate in larger scale pvp and not be mostly a waste of space? A month? 6? 2 years like I've been hearing?
---
I ran Tripwire on a pretty mediocre server for a smallish group, it worked fine. Honestly unless you’re the developer hosting the application pretty much anything with good peering/hosting dc location will be fine
---
Where did I suggest I had one? 
---
With blackjack and hookers
---
Returning players sometimes have to wait for the test server to be reset if they had to do a password reset (ask me why I know...)
---
Don’t worry, I won’t be flagging any characters for a re-render.  But, I need to make sure our systems are working as designed.  For now and in the foreseeable future it will still be very possible to make bizarre-looking characters, and that’s by design.
---
Where do you think I've learned all these tricks?  Horde and I have been dealing with them for over two years.  I am please to be on the side delivering them for once.
---
Such a shame...
---
Eve needs to be a global game.
---
outside of Goon what is the percentage of moons which are being mined.  Separated out by Null  Low and High sec
---
Good
---
nah, you get fucked with chat, get fucked with SP allocation too, you seem to think CCP cares, there's just stuffing a gag down your throat with that SP, fucking called it that they wont give us back the working chat system the day they released the news about "possibly" switching back based on performance...
---
Interdiction nullified interceptor with &lt; 2.0sec align time. Not 100% safe but safest option without scout, etc. 
---
Some entrances are more camped than others, but I’d not use “safe” to describe any
---
&lt;3 Headliner, i truly appreciate your work !
---
Imagine only complaining about jump gates on reddit after you are getting schooled by a group 20 times smaller than your coalition.  
---
TZ tanking? yeah I'm sure you guys lack the numbers to rf them.  
---
I won the bet!
---
Incidentally, thanks again for giving our coalition Fountain without a fight!
---
Delete local for the entire game sure. Delete is just for Null eh. most of the ratter would just fuck off back to highsec as it become risk free isk at that point. Delayed local would work better and would kinda of fucked bots up.
---
Scout down wormholes, when you find one connecting your part of null to either high or low, use that.
---
don't forget to buy some more skins to support our beloved CCP! fucking sheep...
---
Only took you 2 minutes stainguy, we wagered under 90s smh
---
[Its this time of the year again](https://i.imgur.com/ECCHgDq.jpg)
---
Thanks for paying for it all so handsomely after we left.
---
wow sanic-speed post
---
You are free to inderdict and bubblefuck these hyper-obvious routes before a timer, nitwit. That's why they're balanced. More balanced than lets say cynoing across the galaxy without being able to be interdicted at all. 
---
Long travel time to and from a fight should be something an organized group can reduce by putting isk into harms way. Maybe the only fault is that the gates may not be expensive enough. 
---
Pretty stupid.. Now 1 or maybe 2 of my accounts wont get the sp.. Thanks cpp.. Thats a fast way to go from top to flop..
---
You absolute monster.
---
I like you.
---
Like a week. Seriously. 
---
Ewar frigates are amazing. Unfortunately it just feels like you aren’t doing much because there is so little feedback to what you’re actually contributing. 
---
T1 ewar frigates can be flown in a couple days. T2 in a couple weeks. 
---
Whether it be dampening target range so your enemy can’t even lock up your friendlies to shoot them, reducing lock time to a crawl so logi can’t effectively switch to people being primaries, target painters so you’re dreads or artillery volleys actually hit something, or long range tackle. They all have a place and are very good for how cheap and easy they are to fly. 
---
It may not feel like it but if you’ve ever had to try and adjust a cap chain or target swaps mid fight as a logi pilot while have your scan res fucked with it can be a miserable time. It does make a meaningful difference. 
---
send some isk to StainGuy ty
---
Why not join an alive alliance?
---
The strategic consequence is that they spent isk on the gates and spend isk and manpower maintaining them. The only fault is that the gates may be too cheap, so they're not a shiny enough killmail in of themselves. 
---
Well isn't it obvious? you're not buying enough skins, get 50000 PLEX worth of skins and maaaaybe CCP will glance at those billboard ads, keyword "maybe" just like with the chat system they were planning to bring back...
---
Oh that's sweet of you, my humble little stash appreciated &lt;3
---
And drugs galore.
---
Yea. Please dont join one that thinks it is alive and well on its own but needs goons to hold their hands all the time
---
Our body modifications involve power tools and accidents TYVM. 
---
you want them to just say, "hey guys, so, uhhh, well, most of the game is in shambles, yeaaahhh"
---
uh excuse me warped intentions is a thriving sov-holding alliance
---
wishful fucking thinking!
---
Generally the ones deeper into losec are ok imo
---
Find friends fast.

POSes have a tighter grip on this game than any other piece of code confirmed

Hit a tatara or sotiyo with expensive rigs, people will show up to protect it
---
I dont think that anyone has pointed towards bots and said that was the reason for disparity in goon performance versus others. Its just that your overlord frowns upon "goonfucking" as he puts it by trying to report and be rid of them. 
---
Implying they're not trash now
---
My favorite part is how they pretend its working now. 
---
That’s different, he isn’t in Goons so super fast inputting on his part can’t possibly be input broadcasting.
---
But that russian guy whose only activity in this game is rorq mining can’t possibly be fast reflexes with a good multiboxing setup within a couple of server ticks, because he’s in Goons and as we all know, every Goon rorq is a bot and if we breathe a word about bots the multi dollar media empire sends us to the dreaded Goonlag in Far-Period Basis.
---
It's not even admitting the game is a shambles it's just someone in PR / Community managment (Oh wait) or just someone saying. "Okay, we are aware X &amp; X &amp; X is an issue we are looking into them and will be fixing them as a priority. we've had nothing. nothing substantial / wanted in what maybe the past 6 months (Maybe longer)
---
because they would rather cry about a guy camping them for broadcasting, meanwhile this happens... note the guy camping does not influence the game economy in a major way, this shit however....
---
&gt;Which is bad. It constricts local conflict
---
As if there's enough players to have more than about 4 groups anyway (TEST, goonies, pandafam, hordedot or whatever the north is calling themselves this week). 
---
If we made travel from region to region take one hour it wouldn't magically spring into existence a powerblock for goons to fight, in the middle of period basis. Therefore easy quick travel to the next nearest "quadrant power" like TEST or the northerners, just makes sense. From a gameplay perspective. 
---
The true imbalance in the game is that one side is dirt poor because they haven't adapted to the moon changes. 
---
With EvE-O preview I can do this with my 6 Accounts in like 1 second. There are input broadcasters in goons 100%, but these fucking videos about excavator pulling are retarded.
---
Think you missed the memo, but there was a response from CCP here about this a couple months back. 
---
Essentially they said that the billboard submissions have been halted entirely; they hope to get back to it one day but w/o the staff assigned to do it, it's not a priority. 
---
They should be offered that 500k to every account that was Omega at any point since the new chat went live. Fucking obviously.
---
It sucks, and I hope CCP does something to address it.
---
Give your balls a tug, Jersey

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Where are they headed?
---
He is just pressing Shift R really fast?????????
---
What evidence though? I don’t give a shit about this worthless trash tier krab corp but where is the actual evidence?
---
All I saw was a bunch of rorqs pulling their drones really fast, which has been explained as fully possible multiple times in the thread.
---
Are you willing to believe just about anything about Goons just because all of your gameplay revolves around being really mad at us?
---
The pipe around Efa is rarely camped.
---
CCP aren't always aware of the glaringly-fucking-obvious way of doing things... like giving everyone who was Omega at any point in the last 10 months the SP. It's kind of their MO.

For once, I'm not the one getting flairbaited.

As you noticed yourself there is no such thing as community management, so yeah, there is nothing to hope for.

Here, I made [a thread specifically](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aphenr/12_rorquals_magically_pulling_all_their_drones_in/) answering your question.
---
&gt; Are you willing to believe just about anything about Goons just because all of your gameplay revolves around being really mad at us?
---
Just maybe, you are the one mad at me for that I defend right and correct things that also happen to be against the interests of your space cult? Because you are one of those droolers with cult mentality who is brainwashed to defend anything about his alliance?
---
Yeah, but it would have been just shitty for them, rather than a failed update.
---
They're going to cop flack for this SP reward thing regardless, they always do, but it's an apology gift from when the initial change started. It's fair enough and doesn't mean that we are all entitled to receiving it on all characters/account
---
Quite simply no goon should be judge, jury, and executioner. You don't know what's going on, and you wouldn't want to be a goonfucker, would you?
---
[Wut](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region/The_Kalevala_Expanse/structures)
---
So a lot of people probably have questions about the future of P3AK and Pandemic legion. I'd like to answer them.
---
Back in late 2017 we'd just folded T-C after roflstomping various bads for a good two years but the time had come to close it. However [our lust for power was not sated](https://i.imgur.com/s9kLSFH.png). We sought out the Pandemic Legion, the #1 space ship guild in the game. After we plied them with our elite piloting we were invited to join. 
---
All was good, we were #1. Then we met him. Previously in T-C we had never fought against TAPI and their enigmatic leader ProGodLegend. Instantly he shutdown our dreams of faction forts in Providence and destroyed us in a decisive battle. Events like this in EVE aren't unheard of, sometimes you take a lose and learn the lessons, we thought nothing of it, we were still feeling good about ourselves. We immediately threw ourselves into a new campaign; the invasion of the south. Despite all our backroom deals and shady work [PGL countered us again!](https://i.imgur.com/OwrO1QN.png) leaving our titans and supers trapped for several months in UALX. 
---
One loss is a mistake, two is a failure on the loser, such is the philosphy of Pandemic Legion. From late summer into autumn it appeared to the casual observer that we were a 'dead alliance', nothing could be further from the truth; deep in our tactics threads we theory crafted and analysed every aspect of TAPI, implementing vast tests on SiSi to collect data and regain that title of 'The most battle hardened fighting force in EVE online'. It was at another of our desperate last stands on some such keepstar in the North when [the truth hit us](https://i.imgur.com/zrlP7fd.png), there, before us PGL was using his Standing Desk. We had previously analysed alot of TAPIs tactics and such and found them lacking, what we hadn't accounted for was their leader, PGL. We immediately put our pilots on a strict training regime, Hot wings for dinner at least 3 times a week, and the purchase of a Standing desk was made compulsory for all members of Pandemic Legion. 
---
With the tables even we were ready to engage our nemesis' in battle, this time in Geminate. [The battles were a disaster for our allies NCdot](https://i.imgur.com/6mPavPC.png), they fed considerably and without special standing training their weapons might as well have been pixels in a spaceship game. Our battles went considerably better, the stand training and intense hotwing diet had made our mouths fireproof and developed our legs into tree trunks. However, whilst most of our pilots had some control over their stands many of our comrades had been put out of commission; among them Rankor Bill, Head Ferox FC, and surprisingly several Pandemic legion corps entirely. Though we thought ourselves stronger [we had infact become weaker!](https://i.imgur.com/upyMF8S.png) We had been played, as a corp we had been baited harder than most, [thanks to the cunning naming of their Oijanen fortizar 'Your Move Harvey'](https://i.imgur.com/B7McLcB.png).
---
There comes a time in EVE when you realise that there are people better than you, it has been a hard road to work but earlier this week we realised that Progodlegend, leader of TAPI, with his use of his stand, is a superior being. We surrender, it's over. P3ak gives in. We have now apped into Test Alliance Please Ignore. Woe befall those brave fools in the Pandemic Legion that still hope to stand up to PGL, it is an impossible task and one that we cannot walk with them, such is the difference between lowly hunched basement dwellers like ourselves and the good postured PGL. We look forward to mastering our Stands and learning Hamon with our sensei Progodlegend. All Hail Legacy!

They don't, they just said that the bug reports and issues have dropped in quantity.

This video is an indistinguishable case of a really high APM player and a dude who is using round robin broadcasting function of isboxer.

You used to be able to set pos guns to attack their own tower. Not sure if it still works.

I'm half expecting them to start moving developers over to work on the shitbille game eventually and then just drop eve slowly. Technically already doing. I suspect if a mass unsub happened in process they would just kill the game.

Its late i am bit drunk and bit slow.        
---
Wait what about my vouch to init?       
---
What was he doing in lowsec? 
---
&gt;Feel free to disagree and give me principled reasons why.
---
because there's literally no other response to a neutral entering your mining system.
---
whether it's 1 guy broadcasting to 50 guys, or 50 guys broadcasting to their own account... all 50 rorquals are gonna do the exact same thing at the exact same time.
---
if you know all the roquals are owned by the same guy - sure it makes your argument more convincing but when there's only one possible response, watching a whole fleet do the same thing isn't particularly convincing.
---
as such - i'm more inclined to believe a guy is input broadcasting if you can prove all those accounts are owned by the same person than a bunch of drones all got pulled at once.
---
also, drones disappearing at the same time doesn't mean much due to travel time. if the rorqual with their drones furthest away recalls first, and so on until the rorqual with the closest drones calls them back last - of course they're going to vanish almost simultaneously as the furthest away are now an equal distance by the time the last rorqual issues their command.
---
I'm not saying some one is/isn't broadcasting/botting one way or another - i just think there are more compelling and convincing pieces of evidence than some drones being recalled.
---
We call him Little Bobby Tables.
---
Pray we do not change it further!
---
whoa
---
it's the best ship in the game
---
i can't believe you leaked harvey's SotP post
---
So yeah, its not as bad as it was, but it's still shit.  Knowing CCP, they consider it "good enough" now which is horseshit.  Just 2 days ago we had people with empty alliance chats, and after joining fleets it would take 2-3 minutes for a fleet window to actually show up.  
---
You STILL can regularly see different user counts/local lists in channels just by logging on a couple different characters and watching them.
---
Guess I shoulda known better than to think CCP was actually going to do anything.
---
&gt; It's not a players job to handle bots, friends. 
---
Every time a goon botter shows up.
---

As for PL.. They are good peoples and we will miss them.  See you in space. 
---
That's funny honestly. Although, I doubt you can still do it. 
---
No, I just happen to have a ton of experience with Isboxer, multi boxing, and dealing with the limitations of server ticks when it comes to boxing. That guy clearly wasn't broadcasting. 
---
TL:DR standing desk meme gains legs
---
yeah lets just buy some more of those juicy skins, who cares about the game being playable, it's fucking barbie dress up in space!

Why not just kick them from the alliance?

Hush. He worked hard on that one. TL:DR we are joining TAPI because we want to worship the ground PGL walks on.

Ccp, can we finally ban snuff ingame? Those newbean harassment is so annoyning.

Dunno. I moved 9 characters through over the last 2 weeks in yachts. It was so quiet I did it again with pods.

---
Personal anecdote, I haven't had Local shit itself since CCP made the initial announcement that they were focusing on working on the chat issues.  A couple minor issues with characters taking a minute or two to load into corp chat occasionally, but that's about it.  Can't speak for people in other timezones or other parts of the cluster, but it seems like they've made tangible progress on fixing whatever issues were occurring.
---
Yes they are fucking broken.
---
story time?
---
Agreed on DELAYED LOCAL at the very least. Maybe, the lower security, the longer the local delay with a max of like 7.5 minute delay in null or j space. Idk, I think this change would shake things up in a good way. Most people affected by this would be paying attention anyway.   
---
Would hopefully help with botters too...
---
Well, if we want to be exact, we DO know what's going on. It's 15 rorqual's worth of extractor drones (at least) being recalled within 3 seconds. That's 5 accounts per second and if you believe that's done without a script or a botting program, I have some excellent deals for you in Jita!
---
If you see it, bug report it. That way, they can know that there's an issue, and when, to allow them to hunt that issue down. 
---
we should pay him to join us
---
TY
---
Was this a vily move op?
---
Replace local with "regional chat" and call it good.
---
I seriously doubt they have anything else to move to though, everything they tried so far has been rather unsuccessful - DUST514, VR...
---
if CCP becomes just another mobile game vendor then I sincerely hope they never get out of that hole ever again... they might like it there though, I heard mobile games are pretty big in asia...
---
Yes I remember an... empty ship (same model as mine) as payment promise for that mission... Then I must be aware of missions that offers ships as payment, I will try to find the way to have the money to re-equip my new one as the destroyed one.
---
\&gt;  whether it's 1 guy broadcasting to 50 guys, or 50 guys broadcasting to  their own account... all 50 rorquals are gonna do the exact same thing  at the exact same time. 
---
You've apparently never rorq mined (or probably even played Eve at all) if you honestly think that there is any chance whatsoever that 50 unique players are all at their keyboards and responsive at the same time. There is absolutely zero chance that there aren't at least a few of those people taking a shit, on the phone, watching netflix so hard that they forgot Eve is even running, not in comms/muted so that they don't realize what's going on at the same time as everyone else, etc.
---
Yep. They've fixed a bunch of issues. (I don't know the numbers. But it's more than one).
---
Doesn't mean they're all gone, but they've taken out the ones they know about. People should continue to bug report when they see issues.
---
There's a war in the South?
---
One of those rare "goons blacklist" posts where I check and actually find something.
---
wouldn't a SotP be a Summit?
---
True,  but supers can end in normal stations by a variety of mean.
---
This one was actually replaced by the a GM's because it died to bug.  GM's are sometimes lazy and will just put the hull where the the character is.  In this case the pilot was in Jita 4-4, he undocked during a burn jita and sat outside the station.  Goons where going to the take the challenge to kill it but Gm's interceded and told him to move it or they would
---
Got it, will remind
---
The people with clone farms rejoice 
---
&gt; You are free to inderdict and bubblefuck these hyper-obvious routes
---
theyre gates you just jump through them lmao
---
TAPI is alive, they're going there
---
Same difference?
---
You could interdict old cyno chains btw
---
this video actually shows nothing, how about the video of you entering system, landing on grid then see what happens.
---
7.5 Minute local delay? May as well get rid of Local. I was thinking about 10-20 seconds per gate.
---
Another idea would be remove local and have a constellation chat. make it so they required intel to be posted.
---
The evidence is that nobody, no matter how dedicated has the patience or precision and speed to accomplish what the 10-30 man BI fleets are doing. If you refuse to see you are either benefiting from them and are lying, or you are dumb as a brick. I'll let you decide which side you land on.
---
I think that some people also don't understand that rolling back to the old system isn't just a flick of a switch. It'd be a bunch of work to do. 
---
it stands for (absolute) State of the P3AK
---
They should not give any to obvious farm characters.

Eh. Depends really. Echoes is being developed by netease so micro-transactions out the arse. It varies really how much CCP is involved in the development. 
---
yeah pretty sure mobile is bigger than PC in Asia.
---
Do Russians even hold space anymore?
---
Wow, look at stain guy being on point.
---
Preved petushara Kaoz.
---
SRP's pretty cheap when you don't undock. :sun:
---
Not appearing in local until gate cloak ends is a good idea, imo. It's pretty silly that a player appears in local list several seconds before they finish the warp tunnel or other loading and can actually do anything in system.
---
Not by enough to make a noticeable difference I assume 
---
Too much afterschool time.
---
excorpmate btw.
---
Who cares about that trash? I want conquest, not gudfites.
---
I was watching a little npc gang attacking an athanor yesterday and was like wtf? I didn’t know they did that
---
not in a newbee system so gtfo
---
Upon converting the old structures into the new faction stations, according to falcon the entirety of eve was relocated into a single fortizar.
---
I really want to know which one it was to this day.
---
What a dumb post. Stop replying to people who post this. We get one every day. 
---
I love how the guy who mute people who throw fact and evidence about how wrong he is 99% of the time is saying "duuuh you are like a flat earther denying evidence". 
---
Btw I trough you muted me from our last talk I'm sad you did not 
---
What a great youtube series.
---
The frequency of issues has dropped drastically since the improvements made mid January, I believe CCP mentioned to us in a CSM weekly meeting that there was actually a period of 9 days where not a single bug report or support ticket was filed with issues about the chat.
---
Would have lived if ...
---
The requirements to get that compensation are silly. The chat system affected everyone over a long period, but only the ones who were Omega on one particular day in 2018 get the compenstation. 
---
That means guaranteed 50 mill free SP for the SP farmer with 100 accounts, even though he never undocks and doesnt need the chat system and potentially nothing for Joe average who actually undocks regularly, but had a sub break in 2018.
---
You got some serious problem buddy get some help, stay away from goons for a few weeks looks like it getting in your nerve 
---
PL is leaving for Tapi
---
Change my mind 
---
&gt; whether it's 1 guy broadcasting to 50 guys, or 50 guys broadcasting to their own account...  if you know all the roquals are owned by the same guy - sure it makes your argument
---
There is good evidence (ship names on dscan / characters and the corp) that about 10 of these Rorquals is the same guy. The evidence is still inductive. But if I see 10 Rorquals named #1, #2, ... #10 etc. I'll dare to assume it's the same guy.
---
&gt; also, drones disappearing at the same time doesn't mean much due to travel time. 
---
You can account for travel time when closely analyzing the ticks from a YT video. I was able to do that when I specified which Rorq scooped at which second in my OP. Even though 4 drones of a Rorq are still out, you can see the closer drone getting in the Rorqual and notice movement arrows other drones change toward the Rorqual.
---
&gt; of course they're going to vanish almost simultaneously as the furthest away are now an equal distance by the time the last rorqual issues their command.
---
Actually drone travel makes vanishing from overview/dscan more gradual, and not less. The Rorq who has given scoop command latest needs some of its drones to travel as well. But that's why I analyze the grid instead of the overview in these situations (if there is video available).
---
&gt; because there's literally no other response to a neutral entering your mining system.
---
If you multiboxed these many accounts, you'd know that scooping 10 Rorquals in 3 seconds is kind of a panic move. It is a move you make when you really wanna be fast. It's not what you normally do during PvE or other kind of multiboxing. 
---
Meanwhile, this guy knew that he had a neut watching him in local. And he knew there were ships in the neighbor system. He was cold bloodded enough to have drones out, but was anticipating people to come in the system. The moment they come in system, he knew he'd scoop and be safe. This is not a panic moment. This is just a moment you anticipate and respond properly in time and you know you are under no risk.
---
A panic moment which actually warrants scoop across 10 ships is more like being afk, but suddenly realizing 7 pontifexes landing on grid with you. In that time, you really need to be fast.
---
So no, this is not the normal way to respond actually.
---
It's after a certain period of time, I've never timed it so I can't give you the details of that part.
---
nah 10-20 seconds per gate isn't quite enough imho. 
---
I do like the constellation chat. Maybe you're forced to into no local-constellation chat once you leave highsec?
---
bs.
---
Would you have posted if this happened in Vale?

Goons is not CCP, if you want to talk about responsability we can also throw a few name the north protect, let's say RMT/BOT and you already have a big chunk of botting in EVE, but that's fucking retarded to bring politics into a game issue, an issue who only CCP can deal with, an issue only the dev in charge of the said game should take care, player should only care about playing, not space cops bad guys

I am official vov4ik top4ik. Nice drop tau ad. Everything was good. Firstly I was trying to join 1 corp name east corp Inc , they said no. I went to another corp they said yes. I also asked tau about it . Then I started moving my Erebus to their home system they said me to jump to that system and jump to cyno. I jumped to cyno. ......... BROADSWORD , CYNO UPP and 30 titans on me. Now I am just sitting in jita dock banned from goons .nice story isn't it.
---
Exactly this. It's the same giveaway when you enter a botter VNI system, drop probes and immediately do a 4-8 AU scan of the system core.
---
You'll see up to 6 VNIs and no drones out on the first probe scan, and all of them converging on the botter's chosen structure in the second.
---
This isn't because there are 6 hawkish players vigilantly watching local for signs of hostiles entering, ready to immediately recall drones and warp to safety. It's bots.
---

Just Goon bots, because that would be goon fucking. 
---
As painful as it is to defend a goon, with Eve o preview and a hotkey you can do this. 
---
Jumpgates and the new Cyno Geny are the squishiest way to get someone's attention. 1 - they do not have a ton of hit points, 2 - when fully online they still go through shield AND armor before reinforced, 3 - they are of high strategic value and decent isk value. Main thing to consider is that they are generally on grid with a defensive structure, so attack ones in empty systems, and perhaps on the less dependable structure. Lastly, if this doesnt get the desired effect or is too limiting, just linking a TCU or Ihub can def get many entities attention (DAMN YOU WALLY, RIP winter vacation).

See this is different than ratting bots. In that case you can see the bot being online 23/7 so you know something automatized is going on. In this case it's much more murky. The alliance leadership can't look at this video and immediately conclude what is going on, other than something fishy. Alliance leaderships do not have access to a player's client. CCP on the other hand can. This is why it's CCP's job to investigate, not the Imperium's.
---
How about a tv remote in alliance owned structures to filter bad guy ads
---
that would require them to actively support it.
---
Check the sticky

Just jump through! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfALAEfywIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfALAEfywIM) 
---
Thanks. I didn't realize I had problems before seeing your highly elaborate post and now I will go seek help :). Words coming out of your keyboard are full of content and value and not empty random shit at all.
---
PS: Did you know 78% of goons telling me that I have problems actually project their own situation to me?
---
You're not wrong, removing net neutrality was the first step.
---
bad bot
---
I wanted this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdMKJpA0pg
---
extract skills, make new toon, rejoin goons. ezy!
---
legit believe you can't do that to 6 accounts in less than a second. 3 maybe...but I find it very very hard to believe you are pressing a key and depressing it every .15 seconds. 
---
T-C episode 2 pls
---
&gt;MFW Redditors confuse botting with input broadcasting 
---
Falcon we do that. Nothing happens, and you get no feedback on action taken. If CCP actually responded with a non canned response, stating they took XYZ action. The complaints would go down.
---
So if you PLEXed your account on 21st March, 2018, and you played almost a year with a broken chat, you don't get anything. 
---
Well played, CCP, well played...
---
Auto-pilot 😁
---
Supercapital mobility and force projection was problematic. Ansiblexes serve smaller ships, so no problem.  
---
In other words - fuck off, I like getting around fast for roams.
---
"I don't always die in PVP,
---
 but when I do I do it with style"
---
I concede that stuff like this isn't enough proof to convince me unless I see it repeatedly or have more evidence (like catching one of them in a bubble and they don't even try to get out of it even if I don't tackle them), but yeah, it is definitely highly suspicious shit that is difficult to explain coming from human player(s).
---
Whoever made the decision on the requirement of the SP compensation is a cretin.
---
You must first appease the god through buying PLEX, monocles, and Japanese designer jeans.
---
What do you mean you "voted me off the island"?
---
Hahahahahaha you realize those are all new I-Hubs that were dropped right? That means everything in that region has been effectively reset. You guys have responded like two times. 
---
&gt; Again it is Not my Job to handle bots. And we dont are where we are because of bots. And % wise we have the same amount of "bots" like everyone else. Change my mind.
---
I’m pretty sure your Reddit bot fucked up a bit here.
---
&gt; And we dont are where we are because of bots.
---
Your coalition and alliance profits off bots explicitly while feeding the “not my job” narrative. 
---
Your coalition and alliance implicitly promotes botting by upholding the narrative of “not my job.”
---
It might not be your job, but advocating doing nothing when known bitters could possibly be kicked from the alliance/coalition and thus evicted from their current space makes it someone’s job there.
---
You can argue that all you want, but only people drinking the same koolaid or who have a vested interest in bots continuing to bot will agree with you.
---
Podbrains, all the same.
---
Just remember they will prolly go after your crab lands in impass. 
---
I dont even know what CCP was thinking making them fatigueless.
---
They have a tendency make everything new out of balance on the op side.
---
Do you not realize all of those have been destroyed and you guys had to drop new ones lmao? Are y’all really that deep under the rock to not know that TKE has essentially been reset to “0” over the last month????!
---
Never skip leg day
---
True and true but as the saying goes, some of us are lucky enough to have an experimental lab environment, the rest is using production to test shit. I have - thankfully - not much to do with XMPP or XML and all this stuff since we do all our shit in-house and avoid cloud based services like a plague except we use our very own stuff but XMPP is nothing new and if they did their homework and tested their stuff this whole mess would have been a lot less of a shitshow and might actually work. And this is my major issue with the whole new chat system. To me this is totally bad practice but CPP does such things all the time like pretty much the rest of software development. It´s all about quick&amp;dirty nowadays. 
---
If ever push something like that into live production my grand-grand kids still had to pay for my fuck-up. 
---
Damn, I've been in goons for almost two years and I haven't seen a penny of this RMT money! I demand compensation!
---
Call it what it is, nerd herding. 
---
Not to be confused with Nerf herding. Although a lot of FCs probably are scruffy looking nerd herders.
---
ok
---
Welcome to eve?
---
I can't believe there are groups that can afford 1b gates.
---
Ouch that hurt 
---
My wife says no, happy wife happy life. 
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Why are you still allowed to post, you are literally Gevlon Gobblin 2019 edition.
---
For a newbro, it’s a pretty decent way to get some isk to get started
---
You mean you tried to bring your cheap delve titan to snuff to join them OR to sell it to them. Either way you should've just sold your titan and everything and then join them. Maybe they would try to scam you but then you'd still have all your isk. And if you left without hauling a titan with you, there's a slight chance you wouldn't be blacklisted from goonswarm. 
---
Impressive
---
In all fairness, ICY used to have 0,1% when he was the underdog competing for the market before PH decided to side with him.  
---
And after that, his stations were 0,3% for a very long time, until the most recent months before TEST took over when he increased the broker fees to 0,5%.
---
full power: ref shields. the next time the TIMER comes around, *AS LONG AS IT IS AT LEAST 12 HOURS FROM WHEH YOU REF*, plus or minus 2 hours (rng) the armor will be vuln. If you then ref armor, services shut off and on the next DAY the structure is set for, at the time the TIMER is set for, plus or minus 2 hours, the hull will be vuln for half an hour and you can kill it
---
low power you ref shield and armor at once, then the next set DAY and TIMER at least 12 hours away the hull is vuln
---
so let's say a full power structure is set for noon on Saturday. whenever you shoot the shield the next noon that's at least 12 hours away is when armor comes out, and then the next Saturday at noon the hull will come out. So the quickest time would be shield 1159pm on Thursday night, to hit Friday noon, to then end on Saturday noon
---
there's body AAAAND camera positions! do try it.
---
Fuck you shoresy
---
I just tried to join snuff I didn't want to sell it
---
Removing local or delaying it won't fix anything, as players can just place scouts on important gates.
---
&gt; 2 years like I've been hearing?
---
lol who told you that
---
Oh I'm not contending we didn't shoot TAPI, that was the principle point of being there.
---
I do contend we didn't shoot the keepstar until we got locked out.
---
Your ammo story is false; we used ammo trucks hauling stuff over from Jita - the one true market hub of The Forge!
---
TBH I just don't care and I feel like the people that do care or pretend to care are the outrage culture type of people. 
---
Yea, exactly my thoughts. CCP can't get a single thing right. Way to fuck up even the sorry gesture.
---
Why would I need to tab? How long would it take you to mouse click and hit shift R, move the mouse 2 inches and repeat 6 times? How fast could you that? Because that is all you have to do.
---
Looks like some sorta borg bullshit
---
and exotic male dancers
---
tell that to marshy and gaara, wait gaara is perma ban 
---
Where's the top? You can't finalize a character image without wearing a top.
---
This is phenomenal content for my new pilots.
---
You have my thanks!
---
holy moly..
---
Basically... in wormholes, if it’s low power and you bash, it will come out at the time and day of the week that the defenders pick as long as it’s not closer than 12 hours. If it’s high power, the first timer will be at the first time of day that the defenders choose that is available, between 24 and 48 hours away. And then once you bash through armor, the low power hull reinforcement timer applies between 12 hours and a week depending on their chosen reinforcement timer. 
---
Make sure you hack the structure so you have an idea of what their timer window will be before you move things in and start bashing. 
---
Is that an awards show or something?
---
You lost a t3c to a t1 cruiser. Yes its worth lol.
---
God forbid sov-havers have a defensive advantage in their own space, eh?
---
&gt;this isn't hard to do if you have all of the screens as small windows through EVE-O or something and just tab through them hitting shift+R quickly.
---
Probably isn't a billboards department left buddy. Your emails are going nowhere.
---
Rorqual broadcasting matters for me as it makes me miss out on about 20 30 billion isk per month
---
So it will now enter an everlasting cycle of being randomly broken by updates, like the launcher. Yay.
---
is that why you loose a shit ton of ISK every time a azbel onlines?
---
Dead Space 4 lookin' good
---
Nobody wants to read your fucking novels olmeca. 
---
Your opinion is not daughter-in-law out nor does anyone care of what you have to say lol
---
Spinspinspin
---
:blyatman: :manblyat:
---
Exactly. How quickly can you move your mouse and hit shift R? Do you know what EVE-O is? All of the clients have a second miniature window that is live. They are all side by side. Each client is 3x5 or so. I feel like your disbelief is based on not having used EVE-O. I imagine anyone can click and hit shift R and repeat 6 times in very quick succession. 2 seconds max if you don't get the hand shakes.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
2 seconds is a lot more than less than 1 second.
---
Yeah you also have the issue of them just huddling into one system. Needs changing anyways.
---
Well, atleast they "are happy to announce", lol!
---
No they were broken because PL used them...
---
There’s a war in the South?
---
If that kid is 13 years old and got a Titan he should be banned from EVE and do his fucking homework
---
I am going to request changes to how the skill points are handed out. For many players giving skill points to the highest skill point player is pointless as those characters often don’t need the points and the extra 500k is a waste, whereas providing it to an alt would,be more useful. 
---
I understand the concerns about the cutoff date, and have passed those on. 
---
69 systems in TKE, 11 are Sov Level &lt; 5. A single reffed Ihub, and nothing owned by anyone other than Horde.
---
The fact that any have had to be replaced clearly hasn't had a significant impact, so I'm not sure how "we've been a moderate annoyance" is anything worth trumpeting about.
---
I appreciate how you can't even spin properly, few years back it was "goons are dead lol" then "goons are doing a lot of pve, but it's all going to jita/RMT lol" then "goons have a lot of super/titan but they only use it for PVE lol" then "goons have too much super/titan and their super projection is killing the game, CCPLEASE" then "goons let botters botting free in delve lol"then "goons have botter and use input broadcasting they are cheating to get the first position lol", what are we going to have in a few month ? Fix your spin boi or get gud at eve, if you want to kill goons, do it in game not by using shitty narrative no one give a fuck on reddit.
---
There are no less than 11 different 'declarations' of the booleans in the app codebase I work with.
---
I'm not even going to look why it isn't 12.
---
Some are preprocessor.  Some are are enum.  Some are declared as constants.  Some are declared as expressions:  1 == 0, ~0, !0, 255, -1, ... oh the horrors
---
This.  Ideally you wanna find some not-too-bitter-'vets to talk to, have a channel to ask stuff like this
---
And where did all the ISK go?
---
When will this community realize the major alliances are simply farms for third-party selling sites. 
---
At least the exotic dancers survived.
---
Yes, so are commiting fraud and masterminding a criminal empire, but you don't see people putting those two things on the same level.
---
the video who leaked from it was edited, they remove the part where he explain it's not the job of a leader to do that nor the job of a player, no one can really know if a player is a bot, it's not because you see someone running site 16+hour per day it's a bot. And to give you an example, look at the retard who post on reddit "goons are botting here is my proof, their excavator drone are recalling every 12 sec to the rorqual  to avoid getting bombed" but if you check properly, ice excavator drone have 12 sec of cycle time, so it was legit, and this guy possibly report someone who was doing ice mining with ice drone with 12 sec cycle... 
---
Wow, it’s really almost been a year we’ve hadthenes chat system? Damn, feels like it was deployed in the fall or something
---
We're going to widot our way into goons so we won't have to ever worry about mean people shooting our space pixels
---
You sure your thinking about EVE? Petition response times are way better than they used to be even if they are still shit.
---
Lol
---
our armada of CSM intercept every report so we can still bot peacefully 
---
WTB cheap delve Titan, delivered to Black Rise.

I don't know who you are and don't care to bullshit random people on the internet. You have a self confirmation bias going on and ain't no facts gonna get in your way. More power to you. Also, of you know why my thumb key (also my push to tall on mumble) messes up my radial menu I would love to know.
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
Step one, don't call it a quest
---
Ban all input broadcasting, force the install of anti-cheat software to prevent login if third party software is installed that is banned. Other game companies force anti-cheat software (Steam, anyone?) so chances are you are already under that umbrella. 
---
Into ICY and PH pockets.
---
Just like the TTT ISK is going into TEST pockets atm.
---
Every time Project Discovery comes up someone responds with this "omg but rorq ticks" line and it's completely missing the point. You can start making isk this way on day one (yeah yeah you can rorq mine on day one too, reeeee injectors), without any investment, and notably, without any RISK. The non-newbro can also do this WHILE rorq mining, while hiding from wormholers who brought too many pilots to the honor fight, while floating in space getting blueballed, while tethered on the undock spamming local with "made you form", or while waiting for your guns to cycle in TiDi. It's like saying you should decline a tip because your wages are higher. Not to mention that the milestone rewards can be a major burst, and it's pretty easy to "git gud" and identifying transits.
---
ton's.
---
1) entosis a moderate or high value ihub
---
2) dropping a small citadel off a big one (usually 6 day wait)
---
3) TACKLE A RORQUAL
---
4) RF a jump bridge
---
i know this isn't what the game want to hear but its easier now than it ever used to be. Most of the people who WANT this content are just lazy

"Welcome to Eve!  You are already dead!"
---
They never reveal information on what they do to other players accounts. 
---
And i think that's a fine policy in general. We can see what they did (or didn't) anyway.

No you just come in here and blow smoke up peoples asses about how you can do this in less than a second...and then change your story 2 times in less than 15 minutes about how you go about doing it.

Don't bind it to a key, that is also bound to something in a game. Presto problem solved.

---
pot calling the kettle a gamerword
---
Well, as you are hiding behind a dumb reddit name I don't have anything to go by on who you are a member of other than your flair, so I will take that bait.  Brand Newbros are blue to more regions than the group I am associated with is.
---
As far as where the enemies are located and jump bridges. Yes, they are necessary.  You don't understand what most people use them for.  There isn't usually vast fleets flying through (because fuel costs yo), but pilots taking shortcuts running to their market system/stager.  
---
You obviously don't have a clue about the Ansiblex Jump Bridge and what they are used for, so have a good day!
---
If you watch closely there are 3 stages of launch within the 10 seconds. So drones from about 10 Rorquals are launching instantly and after 2-3 seconds another 10 Rorq group and so on. 
---
he is probably using round robin in isboxer, which is bannable.
---
We all know this...and we all know CCP is content in allowing it to continue, because they make bank off selling PLEX or the Subs to facilitate it.  
---
CCP should ban any way of broadcasting to clients.        
---
This way there will be no more **"i use isboxer in acceptable way ... it was just accident"** !
---
That honestly sounds like some excellent EVE.
---
That was for capitals for the most part.  If folks are cramming capitals through jump gates (and yes, there have been instances of this), then the pilots  and their FCs are fucking morons, as it RAPIDLY burns through the LO.  That is your cost.  Is it super cheap and readily available?  For now, yes.  Who is to say that the stockpile is not already dwindling.  Are we mining enough to cover these gates for the entire game? 
---
You have your head buried in the sand, not allowing you to see the bigger picture.

stop trying. give up. the DO. NOT. CARE. at most you will get those few guys that generate the most r/EvE hate banned and that's it! it's more or less a way of CCP silencing the crowd while continuing not to do jack fucking shit. the game already has enough idiots consuming every single NES skin they release, they don't need you to keep the gig running, lose all hope who play this game, it's barbie dress-up in space and a bot simulator now...
---
While we did previously submit some time after the purge (there was a delay in finding an image that met the specs) we have resubmitted and hope to see the EM logo once again on TQ. Sadly it's not the old logo exactly, but it'll do.

welcome to eve now htfu lol.
---
So I guess this is the new thing to complain about. I notice we dont talk about fighters being OP anymore it's just 10+ threads of people QQing about something else.
---
It actually is pretty telling how much shit the average horde member is being fed while kept in the dark, that their entire rental region has been completely burned to the ground and that it's completely unsafe to krab in caps and rorquals under a friendly cap umbrella, yet leadership carries on like everything is all fine.
---
You are still clinging on the Mar5hy issue. No broadcaster has ever said "I broadcasted drone scoop command by accident". Nobody does that by accident.
---
leave it to salty ass motherfuckers to find some way to complain about something.
---
I recently came back to Eve and went into Amarr FW after much deliberation as to what I should do.  Being in the NPC Corp isn't bad, especially, if you're using it to help the war effort and participate in fleets while trying to decide on a Corp to join. You'll get plenty of Corp invites, and the folks in FW are all about new folks joining in.  
---
Fights are easy to get between bastard pirates and legitimate war targets.  Expect to lose every ship.  Grab a stock of ships and fittings before you head out there, stage them in a HS station close to FW space, and then enlist. 
---
LP is good enough money making that you can sustain your losses, upgrade your fits, and still profit.
---
Also, maybe it's just Amar Militia, but these folks are altruistic as fuck and always willing to help out if you ask for a fleet or someone to plex/mission/hunt with.  
---
Tl;Dr - joined FW myself, found good fights and good folks, don't regret it one bit, recommend it 100%
---
I have never been told that I cannot report Horde bots.
---
Fake news.
---
The loss of 150-200b a month in rental income is pretty significant my dude, not to mention that a full ihub costs over 3b each. 
---
Big thanks for providing system &amp; start time
---
Just blue half the game lmao kek drop on everything.
---
The video is bad quality that i dont see what happen really and i m on phone atm. Need to see better to make better observation.
---
At least let ccp make their job. If they cheat. Glad to get them banned. Like everyone else.
---
Ooooh, you said bots!  To the Gulag!
---
Crap, I had to say it to accuse you.  I hope the gruel is nice.
---
Tau did this
---
the pssshhhh is most definitely skins in this game,why make the game better when you can introduce a concept of easy bullshit that a good majority will gobble up and generate fat stacks...
---
So why are people so surprised every time someone calls out more botters? We should all know this game is tainted economically. 
---
Nothing, go buy skins like a good boy!
---
I'm still searching for the winning disk configuration.
---
I was literally in the fleet when the FCs ordered everyone to dock up and grab ammo since they were running low from shooting the keepstar.
---
That's weird using that date.. I will made a 2 new omegas since then that's been affected by this issue... But fuck me right?
---
Oh I constantly complain about Fighters, Cyno mechanics, HAW Titans, Ansiblex gates, Sov mechanics, Low sec state, and many more. 
---
Totally agree. It s at their CEO to do the first work imo

---
Better than getting nothing, hmm?
---
Yeah, because Horde did such a good job of maintaining their highsec markets on their own!
---
This war would probably end if you re-enabled our access. We just want the sweet cutting edge tax rates, and we will wage a war at any cost for them.
---
I'll have you know I shit over Goons every single day thanks  
---
You're just a meme at this point, grring goons every single day of your life and latching onto any and every kind of anti Goon narrative and parading it around r/eve

So do people leave input broadcasting on by accident or not? Maybe all those rorqs that probably aren't broadcasting anyway just left it on by accident?
---
Xenuria, is dis u?
---
Yeah make sure you read if the stuff is given as reward or at the start. That one gives the ship upon accepting the mission.
---
There are two simple issues here. There are three ways to 'report' a bot. If you submit a ticket, they tell you to email ccp security, who you email and they never answer. (Still waiting on a response from 5 months ago), or you use the in game 'report bot' function.

Issue number two is feedback. Human beings like to feel heard, which is why people are whining on reddit about stuff. League of Legends solved this issue by adding this feedback into their reporting system. If you report someone, sometimes (If enough reports go in, etc), you will get a message back saying "Due to your recent report, action was taken against that account". Easy, simple. They don't need to disclose what they did, but let me know it's doing something other than going off to the void to never be seen again.
---
yes
---
Fucken number one brav.
---
Fuck snuff
---
I have reported them and they are removed from corp the next day
---
Sucka blyat
---
So the moral is he went from one bag of dicks to another.

Mittens pls

YEah they are use asic miners these days
---
Nah, PF-346 is much nicer.
---
Or alliance exec to give them 24h to pack or prove the voters are ejected.
---
Of course this isn’t the first time so maybe just eject the whole Corp.
---
Or, you know, continue to defend them via the “not my job” narrative.
---
That moment when you learn about international news while casually scrolling some subreddit/imgur post.
---
That's a pretty cynical way to look at it, so you're probably right. 
---
holy shit, LANCE range is as close as I would get to that thing
---
Also a good point. It would've set the game back in a bunch of ways for the foreseeable future, so it's a big *FEWF* that they managed to make this significant headway on debugging the whole system.
---
It's almost like reading my post history is a super difficult thing to do.
---
Blacklisted because Goons considers the titan alliance property even if you buy it, build it, scammed it, etc...  If you try to leave with it, sell it outside the Imperium, defect, etc... you are considered screwing over  GSF, and welcome to the blacklist.
---
Wow, they really are deluded...
---
And yet the OP claims he does just that for combat purposes.
---
You had some sympathy until the 'maybe some of my many accounts' part. You, the player, were affected, and if your primary account gets a free 500,000 SP that's pretty decent.
---
Instantaneous and synchronous drones in. LOL!!! 
---
Anything less than .5 seconds between each ship recalling drones can't be rationally placed in any category other than CHEATING. Hey, if you are that guy who played NCAA Football on a PS2 and created a team and made all your players 6'10 400lbs and 99 on stats across the board and still felt like you were a winner.. you are just sad and pathetic.
---
It absolutely is ridiculous that CCP isn't doing the job, no argument there.  Players shouldn't have to do the legwork to actively hunt down bots.  But when it's obvious right in front of them and as common knowledge as the OP of this comment chain implies, they still have a responsibility to report it.  I'm not obligated to be a murder detective just because murders happen, but if I see one happen in front of me I'm still expected to report it to the authorities, at the very least.
---
Same. Stopped playing like in February last hier, came back in October, chat has been 3 month of pure AIDS but no SPs lol.
---
CCPlease use your two last braincells sometimes idk even. 
---
'Says "infallibility of evidence", immediately produces and defends inductive evidence. 
---
Bad start. But I agree in the principle of banning botters.
---
Looks like input broadcasting. Smells like input broadcasting. Probably is input broadcasting. Its goons though so nothing to see here, right...
---
"If you multiboxed these many accounts, you'd know that scooping 10 Rorquals in 3 seconds is kind of a panic move. It is a move you make when you really wanna be fast. It's not what you normally do during PvE or other kind of multiboxing."
---
There is zero evidence that it only took 3 seconds to hit recall on all of the drones.  You "analyzing" a crappy YT video is hilarious.  Tell me, what are your credentials?  Besides doing the exact same thing with more accounts?
---
So people that shoot goons can input broadcast.  But not goons.  Got it.
---
Poor poor innocent and impressionable macko...
---
r/thanksihateit
---
Why not 50k for every month you've been subbed since the march release 
---
Yep, CCP wants more ships to die but they haven't figured out how SAFE their game has actually become. 
---
Well you are more stupid if you are actually not a Goon but you are buying into their story.
---
Let me break it to you. I don't disseminate any anti Goon narrative. I talk about imbalances pertaining to issues with capitals, capital umbrellas, proliferation, Rorq multiboxing and so on. Goons are the ones creating a narrative around people who voice these concerns. And if 50 reddit warriors consistently shits on someone, people like you begin to believe it too. There are multiple people like me Goons managed to memefy.
---
lol you absolute hypocrite. You goons were losing your shit because someone multibox chatted in several channels a while ago. When you have clear evidence/proof of this suddenly you come up with excuses. Fuck goons.
---
off to skillu with the cool kids. gl

---
Maybe.  Kinda dumb to do a thing that is bannable and inferior to another thing that is bannable without any real notable difference in likeliness of being caught.  Definitely possible though.
---
&gt;Have you renamed the Keepstar in J5A yet? You should. After all you are subsidising our supercap SRP for the rest of eternity.
---
Why would they?  Player of Games is a great name.  
---
While it's certainly true that the Imperium could have just taken Fountain from TC it seems like a dishonorable albeit intelligent choice by all involved parties to buy it out.   By the time it was sold TC was pretty thoroughly hollowed out and Iron Armada was pushing us around.  PH was already making plans for a relocation out of Cloud Ring/Pure Blind / Fade and had little interest in making a play for Fountain or having a hostile entity on their doorstep.  
---
I'm sure the Imperium could have paid exponentially more and Fountain still would have been a good deal.  INIT is using the space better than TC ever did, that's for sure.  
---
Round Robin in isboxer is a CPU Core strategy and isn't bannable at all.
---
Not a bad idea either.
---
when?
---
Thera is the best way to get where you don't want to sometimes go

And never speak in coms again.

Yeah they do. If I use a wormhole or log off in the system and I have a cloak.

Been around a while I'm familiar thx
---
Glad I came back and re-subbed on April 2018, otherwise I’d have experienced those chat bugs like you poor suckers... lucky me.
---
No there's a massive difference between you blobbing your enemies, anchoring on your FC and pressing F1...and a small gang dealing with a larger force in enemy territory where people have to fly their own ship.
---
I like to cuddle my dog.
---
Orders were "if it twitches shoot it", so take it out.
---
So if you plexed after that date the chat system had no issues? ok

hah

Isn't that the *elite entosis* corporation that did such a swell job in Providence?

I came back on March 23, FUCK
---
Where do you guys find the energy to write 15 paragraph essays on input broadcasting?
---
wormholes and blops.. 
---
the other round robin
---
I believe this is incorrect regarding Full Power. I'm leaning towards the following timer rules for wormhole space.
---
**Full Power:** 
---
Armor: 24hrs (+/- 2hrs) + Defender's Set Hour
---
Hull: 12hrs (+/- 2hrs) + Defender's Set Hour and Day
---
**Low Power:**
---
both
---
Nice try u/StainGuy
---
Sorry but I'm new to reddit as well and I don't know what that means. Elaborate?
---
ye we're the ones that killed all provi bloc's i-hubs and took their stations.
---
Double-check my response to /u/versoth, I think this matches up to what you're saying. This looks the most reasonable and gets the most head nods from my corp mates.
---
"Nothing is broken or bad enough to take issue, especially not two things at a time."
---
Feel free to explain how your argument is different 
---
Can anyone tell me what’s wrong with the local,, I haven’t been around long enough so idk
---
undocking in Jita isn't 'safe'.
---
You are either really really new.. or you are just another troll.
---
Shoot them then...
---
Suprised it lasted this Long. Good riddance! Also raknor we gotta Play some Games again mate
---
To be fair P3AK did the heavy lifting in Provi taking the sov. PL deployed after that and dropped the ball trying to actually defend it.
---
Yeah, you definitely don't come off as unhinged here 
---
It's horde I don't think their membership cares about that stuff as much tbh. Why would you join horde if you want to make isk. Might as well join goons(or TNT just saying)
---

Thanks for watching
---
Caps used to be about sov warfare and people complained.   They made subs and caps change roles and now people complain.  The only way for CCP to win is not play
---
Um I just use my 12 sets of hands to recall them, okay? Way to mock people with my condition.
---
can 🔥 we 🔥 get 🔥 emojis 🔥 😂😂💯
---
wow, those guys sound like they take this game way too seriously.
---
&gt; Sorry, didn't reread that sentence. You have all the tools to remove every advantage but the local. 
---
At least you are admitting that these are advantages instead of denying them. And attackers don't have a counter play to these advantages. Not mechanically.
---
&gt; But it is with: Just remove these advantages. Go out and kill them. 
---
Gladly but with so many advantages local isn't necessary anymore. Or give attackers more tools to match these other ones. Alliance gates, citadels, mining platforms...they do nothing for attackers. Give us tools for it. Fair?  
---
 Not adressed at all. It's not about ISK, it's about player motivation. Less PvE in an Area leads to less destruction (PvP). The numbers support my point and they don't support yours. I don't believe in your magical leap of faith that players will become more active when they have to krab longer and harder for the same ammount of ships because it's more risky. 
---
Yes very addressed. More risk makes it more difficult thus making it more valuable. So many krabs are crashing the value of ISK. Plex is up to 2 billion a month almost. Ores are lowest value ever. Ships are extremely cheap. Money has been devalued by the over abundance of krabbing.  
---
&gt; Again, it's not an economical issue, it's a motivation issue. Yes ofc, since roaming gangs will have a much, much more easy time killing targets, it will naturally produce more roaming gang activity. However, on the flipside, you will have less targets.   
---
Ha so you admit yourself roaming gangs will be more active. And if less people PVE...you think maybe...they might fight each other? OH HOW AWFUL!?!?!?!?!? That's the point. You're getting it now. This game should be more about roaming and pvp than krabbing. We have TOO many herbivores, with TOO many defenses driving away the carnivores. You need to have balance between that or your eco system goes to shit.
---
&gt; Will you as the small gang now finally move up to actual targets and not easy prey? Will you, with local absence suddenly decide that you want fights instead of ganks? No you won't and thus, you will have less targets in space and that's it. How that is a good thing in your opinion is beyond me. 
---
Well let's see if people actually brought gangs to fight us we'd be just fine with that. Like you said, roaming gangs will be more motivated to be out there. So more targets for us that want to fight. That's good. We want this in the small gang community.
---
&gt; And it's not speculation. Every single time local dies these elite pvp'ers go out to gank crabs. They never go for a major asset like a citadel is. They just don't. So, yeah, you make the game harder for krabs and you'll drive them out. Less Targets for you, more ridiculous crying because you can't have targets. Salt Spiral Inc. 
---
And what would you have a 5 man gang do? Start sieging goon keepstars?
---
&gt; Oh yes we did. We've build them, we've put them up, we maintain them. CCP gave us the option to do so, sure, but they also gave you the option to destroy them. Absolutely fair game. 
---
Yes CCP GAVE Them to you. CCP GAVE you tools to protect yourself. Krabs have NEVER BEEN SAFER IN THE HISTORY OF EVE because of these tools. And now you want to cry because maybe just maybe we take an out-dated chat system that gives you perfect intel?
---
&gt; I didn't say you are risk averse, I said you are loss averse. You don't want to go in with guns blazing knowing you won't return. You except to have a fight and get out alive so you can get out the next day without grinding for ISK in between. That is what you call "content" without realizing that content is content no matter if stuff dies or doesn't.   
---
Crazy idea...keeping your ship alive. How is this an argument?
---
&gt; But you can't. Partially because you are poor and you can't afford the enormous ammount of ISK you would need to spend to do all that. And that's why you want CCP to do it for you instead. 
---
I have about 50 billion liquid I made in less than a year from combat booster manufacturing and reselling a fleet of capitals I got cheap during a firesale from the last northern war. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I did any krabbing. Most of it was when the carrier fighter mechanics came out. I kill way more than I lose so that amount is fine for me. And you think because you sit there for hours on end grinding rats you somehow have some leg to stand on in this conversation.
---
&gt; If you want an easier time hunting, start with the things you can do. Start a war and kill stuff. Oh, you don't have the manpower? Well, that's bad luck for you but not an argument. "I don't like Blobs" is not an argument either. 
---
I didn't start a war by myself but I helped. Oh and then finished it.

Avatar project seems like a very good corp actually.

How many times have you failed in killing just one though? Pineapple Pizza Forever!

MORE space?! Haha shut up brainlet
---
Hi so I just picked up eve a couple weeks ago and I love every bit of it. That being said, there is still an itch that it doesn't scratch. I'm really interested in fast paced space combat, dogfighting/flight sim style. Any suggestions? 
---
How many attempts have you failed to just kill one azbel? Pineapple Pizza forever, keep trying though and lets see how long until you fold from time invested with 0 gain
---
Yeah damn Efa is dead looking on Dotlan, though Ashmarir seems like it's getting interesting.
---
'PL' didn't drop the ball. During the campaign the change landed enabling entosis ships to recieve reps, which made capital dominance important for sov warfare again. We did not have our super fleet in the south and so had no way to force multiply ourselves to withstand all of Legacy, or deal with tapi fax.
---
Reminds me of the spider doll toy from toy story.

There are some strapless clothes for women in New Eden.

Looks like you found another guy ignoring EULA and TOS. And guess what? He's INIT! If these guys can't keep their mouth shut like this, I'm wondering how CCP can't find them.
---
Why are you combing a booster and an extender?
---
It would require as much work as has already gone into the new system to bring the old system back. Glad they are still moving forward.
---
Sorry mate, it's 17 Rorqs not 12. I know this doesn't help their case but had to say it...

Oh my fucking god, I've actually come across that person before and commented on this photo!

So dont try and resolve one issue at a time, attempt them all and make no progress instead is what you would prefer?

How about don't buy titans with mummy and daddys credit card and then whine about it when you lose it in a really obvious way.
---
I guess this is what happens when you move your offices from glorious Iceland to Brexit (so i heard).
---
Definitely a spai Corp applying to TAPI. 
---
So you won maybe 10 out of 160 timers. Bravo! No wonder you have to celebrate every single win.
---
First thought, good God what the hell...ohhhhh its eve. Makes perfect sense.
---
What year is it?!
---
Do people still play it? 
---
We'd have just entosised with FAX instead of heavy tanked subcaps if the change hadn't occurred.  We had supercap supremacy in the area so it's not like you were going to win regardless.
