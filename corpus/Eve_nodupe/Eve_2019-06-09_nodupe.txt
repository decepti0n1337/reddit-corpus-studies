I have been playing since 2010 and I am having more fun than ever.
---
---
---
Plenty of people. Just need to find a good Corp to join
---
So jam the fighters. Ecm-300s work well. Drop the inhib 50 km off.
---
personally i say get good in the thrasher or train in to a jag newer players always make the mistake of wanting to go big for pvp and have a lot of fun in a hawk
---
Did it really take you over 10 hrs to think of that clever title and post the BR?
---
&gt;What incentive is there for older players to continue playing EVE?
---
Being a big FC doesn't mean they have skill.
---

---
Second point, I hunt for the fleets when not leading fleets. Hyperspatial dictor and probe ceptor dual box combo is pretty decent.
---
Concord does not respond to killing NPC miners. Each mining group has their own response fleet, random spawn of anything between 5 frigates to a mix of 15 different ships including battleships. Once you learn how to defeat them, it's fairly easy. They do web/scram/logi and often dual logi which is impossible to break sometimes.
---
Yep, they all have the same loot table. I've gotten the 450m harvester drone BPCs and rorq skins in highsec. They dont drop the excavator BPCs, no idea where those come from.
---
Being able to anchor citadels in hostile faction space completely undermined a key characteristic in FW space. 
---
Previously you could plant a POS and stage out of that, but your capabilities were limited. You had to fight to take over the system to actually be able dock in a station there and use the facilities provided by it.
---
Now, just spam citadels until the defenders stop bothering to waste time killing them.
---
That's like two T2 drones worth...
---
What do these new CSMs think they gonna fix that the current ones couldnt?
---
&gt; If you’re a fan of PvP I’d hit up Sin Alarma or Sephie 
---
Who ????????????
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The best 2 corps in a AUTZ are VDD (in NC) and tickle.
---
There are some other AUTZ corps in a darkness,  they are aids
---
There are some in test,  test is chlamydia
---
All major alliances are now getting decent AUTZ player base even if they aren't in a specific corp.

---
Nullsec is awful, I’m trying to point him towards fun
---
Sorry to offend anyone that still likes nullsec, but wspace is full of fun and Sephie is the best FC I’ve ran into in wspace 
---
They lead a little group called Exit Strategy and most people have heard of this group even if they don’t know who runs it
---
I’m currently doing through a customer service shitshow with DoorDash and it’s really frustrating. 
---
Thanks for the reminder that we should actually call out the companies who do a good job at support. I’m glad CCP is on the list. FWIW, Blizzard support has always done a good job for me too. Same with Simple.com (an online bank).
---
how to find out someone is a home defense response fleet fc in 2 steps:
---
1: he will make sure you know he's a fc, he probably flies a monitor too regardless of the comp
---
2: deep down he believes what he does is incredible and think shit like "hyperspacial dictor and probe ceptor dual box" is even worth mentioning, as if people fit their dictors with fucking trimarks and didn't box 90% of the time.
---
This is what body odor and gingivitis sound like.
---
If Trump loses in 2020 you're likely correct.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but exit moved out to NS at the moment. 2 weeks of rage rolling and finding nothing cause not many autz wormhole people kinda hurts
---
Watch th scope
---
I got a mental image of what this incel looks like by the music and the hentai character in the video and the image my mind created is disturbing.
---
Instead of resist profiles, use the new UI linking feature introduced in the last patch to make some "helpful" links to your wallet, undock button, etc. The mineral breakdown for various ores is a good one too.
---
No thanks, sitting in a perfectly safe region to mine rocks sounds like utter boredom
---
I liked your pointers on the website. But instead of Sotiyos, don't you think it is wiser to nerf the gameplay of Rorquals so that people can't be multiboxing so many rorquals so easily much like how a person cannot multibox more than 2 supers, or even 1?
---
It is annoying that people can easily operate rorquals in two figures without much effort at all under an umbrella. That I personally think is the issue which has devaluated motherships in eve, and kills in general.
---
Secondly, do you think there is a solution to skill injectors? or if they even need a solution?
---
Other than that, I read your points on the website, its a nice summary and the points are good to me.
---
Dont know much about the AUTZ wormholes,  but know exit strat left WH space a few weeks back and are now in tickle
---
Oddly enough, that comes out to the same ending no matter how you do it.
---
A server reset would be pretty boring because the eve meta is basically solved at this point (even without injectors/rorqs). What would be great is an Eve 2 with completely new races, ships, weapons, etc, even staying within the bounds of the current ship class system. 
---
Best times of eve were when the information structures were weak pre- API killboards and pre-reddit where you had to find out most information either yourself or through mouth to mouth rumors.  "My raven was equipped with the following" and all that
---
Nice attempt at jerking each other off in these two comments here lmao.
---
I’ve been out the loop for a while, looks like they moved out to NS to kill Chinese botters:( that’s a real shame
---
Sansha titan = even bigger Revenant!
---
Talk to NC/PL, they removed a bunch.
---
If you like structure bashing I got some good news for you!
---
It seems to me there is much better, or at least more accessible, money to be made physically moving goods to less stocked trade hubs, ie FW zones or between the major hubs. Though I am by no means an experienced trader.
---
Compared to EUTZ no

---
Nullsec’s only awful if you join a krab alliance and rorq mine 24/7, there’s lots of small gang opportunities and chances to fuck around if you take a little initiative
---
&gt; You'll be training for quite a long while before you can use one though.
---
 
---
Or you know, a few minutes till he injects all the required skills. That is what I was pointing out, both you and me still think in the pre-injector fashion. Now, talking about weird and dumb....
---
You know, YOU don't *have to* mine, I made enough to have 65bn liquid right before war (to get second titan) without ratting or mining a single hour, in just 8 months or so of half-arsed t2 industry in delve (about 10 production cycles).
---
It depends on what you are trying to address, The Sotiyo changes and the injected SP adjustment is to address Super/Titans/Caps proliferation.
---
You're asking that question on a subreddit dedicated to the playing of the game. So yes, a lot of people here would say its worth getting into.
---
And yes, it is difficult at first. Just don't try to learn everything at once and try to find something that you find fun as soon as possible. Its a sandbox, you won't get your hand held and shown the fun. You gotta go out there and find it for yourself.
---
You can always start the game as an alpha clone try it out and if you like it sub into omega. I'd recommend looking into organizations that help new players, examples being eve university, karma fleet, pandemic horde, or brand new bros.
---
When you get comfortable in cruisers and have a bit more budget the scythe fleet issue is pretty mean
---
tl;dw: Goons drop supers on some frigates and marginally win the isk war.
---
As far as the cloak, simply put, I would imagine something that cloaks you would actually draw a great deal of power from somewhere in order to work.
---
just jam the fighters retard
---
Never too late to quit
---
I invited a friend of mine, and even with me helping him, it was pretty difficult to teach the game. There's just so much to it, the best way is to go with the flow.
---
So, just start with the game but join a newbie-dedicated group like Pandemic Horde. You will have fun there, you will learn the game fast, and it's going to be great.
---
Except you list of issues to fix with the game don't even stretch out of your home system,  your not an independent or losses candidate your a Khanid only candidate 
---
Lowsec gate to stain from Khanid,  lp store in Khanid you lack any redeeming factors but at least your not the worst you have people supporting gold ammo and tin foiled hat assholes competing against you so we could do worse
---
&gt; – Any Citadel that is anchored in FW declares a faction (even if the owners aren’t enlisted). 
---
With this change basically everyone is going to need to join FW if they want a citadel in half of lowsec. This will force all pirate groups go join FW and even nullsec groups who might want a citadel in FW space for strategic purposes. Not a good change imo, should just make it so FW people can’t dock regardless of ACLs.
---
&gt; - The cloaking devices of EVE should require capacitor to function and continually cycle. 
---
Nonononononononono this is such a bad change, I’m assuming you’re wanting it to require enough cap that frigates can’t run it stable (otherwise this change would be pointless) so; 
---
1. Cloaky ceptor eyes lol gg
---
2. Bombers cloaked on a blops gg
---
3. Cloaky camping nerf (which is the intended target I assume) seriously makes nullsec WAY safer as it’s the only real way to catch people in most capitals (especially supers), apart from the very ISK intensive awoxing. This one is a deal breaker for me.
---
&gt; – Feroxes are still the power house of Battlecruiser down warfare and the nerf to them was not effective enough to limit their capabilities. I think the Optimal Range bonus needs to be changed to a 5% per level instead of the 10% it is currently.
---
This is a non issue imo, feroxs are not oppressive, just because they’re good and used often doesn’t mean they need to be nerfed again.
---
Every day someone asks the same question, and the answer is always yes, it always will be. Join, find a good community, if you play solo you'll burn out and quit very soon.
---
Assuming you want to avoid FW, the best fast boosts are the SOE epic arc and the Caldari career agent missions. Aside from that you can also look at Caldari COSMOS missions. Just make sure to use the standings booster to maximize your standings gain as aside form the epic arc, none of the other options are repeatable.
---
Obviously someone with a vengeance paid the NPC to only target test. Nothing to see here...
---
Living in Sydney. I am having plenty of fun in AU timezone. Can be quiet occasionally though.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what the fuck is wrong with you, man

how do you access the database directly? I'd love to know some NPC stats that aren't on chruker

  You're part of the problem

---
To put things into perspective, w-space is by far the most dangerous place to farm and even that is extremely safe if you aren't an idiot. Imagine just how safe null is in comparison, i.e. 100% safety unless brain or technical issues arise. 
---
100% safety is not good for the game as it does not stimulate content. The best example of this concept I can give to explain is high-class dread farming; you make 1b+ per hour and take a significant risk in doing so, where ultimately you end up being someone's content but if you do it right, your gains exceed your losses and everyone gets something. Assuming the same attentive player rats in his super, carrier, Rattle or VNI, his risk is essentially reduced to zero and no longer creates content.
---
And before you tell me that you shouldn't be someone's content, that was the concept that EVE was built upon as an open-world, sandbox, PVP MMO.
---
&gt;hey you're not flying an Imicus so at least you have some sense of good taste in ships
---
Don’t do the imicus dirty like that, I love my little  piano kickstand
---
Made more isk writing 3rd party software than doing anything in game.
---
I can't read all of it.  Let me see if I'm getting this right though. So you would do pve grind missions to "level up" 
---
End game is bigger ships to grind with and maybe a "titan" at the end of the year?
---
I don't think plans were released.

When Init evicted HK, everyone called the system "Rage": that was the nickname HK gave their home.  Most wormholers have a name for their home, and sometimes other special systems.  If it fits with the story, OP, you're better off finding a name like that.  Or just make one up and note what the atlas name is!
---
Counterpoint, some nonwormholerbtw asks for wormholerbtw advice on writing.  May or may not be good, but hey at least he's doing some amount of research on it.

Sweet fucking wall of text omeca as a goon I want you in the community because I know after the 1st meeting you'll break the nda and we all know how that will play out and I think it would be the funniest troll of them all

That said, you're so incredibly disconnected from reality I wonder how you even function in eve? 
---
You're anti big block, as long as it's only goons your talking about the rest are fine,
---
Your anti capital,  only goons the rest are fine,

Your anti krabbing, only goons, botters in the north and east are fine.

---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Cloaky ceptor eyes lol gg
---
Cloaky ceptor eyes was kinda the point of the change. The rest can easily be fixed by adding a cap usage bonus on the hull (bombers). This was proposed as a way to prevent long term afk cloaky camping. I have spoken to other people for alternate solutions so this isn't a hard point for me.   
---
&gt; Unless you literally mean the citadel will declare a faction which is a bit strange and not sure if CCP code will be able to do that.   
---
This was the design intent. It makes it easier to take and hold systems in the warzone. This was another proposal taken from the FW discord
---
I've been out of highsec for years, but sometimes I still miss Oiniken. Quiet Caldari space, my little pos with compression and a retriever sitting in the house of records station.
---
The game should always put yourself as the one that killed you though :P Since it's too true.
---
Yeah I saw some pvp the other day in nullsec what’s up with that

Star Wars Galaxies was a sandbox that turned into a theme park and it killed the game. If heaven is a place, it's launch SWG.

They want market control, probably so that they can control the flow of goods themselves(if it is a concerted effort at least). Theoretically you can then embargo corporations by denying market access, thereby projecting power and weakening regional hostiles.

Too strong? I don't think so. The Frig hulls are a little underwhelming, The Vedmak is fun for solo but is outbaised by it's competitors. The Ikitsura is nice for solo and whaling. The Leshak is super tanky but the cost offsets it

Pretty sure the consensus back then was that Lego did not want to muddle their Star Wars sets with another line of spaceships

There are a decent number of people, but not a number of decent people.  It's a prison colony, after all.

Yup. Iirc he used a mix of geckos, compressed ore, and faction/officer mods. The idea was to get enough ISK to make them get greedy, but not so much that a patient person could ruin his wallet.

I just recently started having issues, whereas before I took a year long break I had no issues. Not so much performance though, but connection problems.

Sansha require Amarr and Caldari skills, not Gallente, and they still have their own unique aesthetic. Maybe they would have the first vertical titan.

i know theres major hyperbole in this reddit over everyrhing and all kinds of shittalk

but i honestly think you should be yanked as a dev into the crew, unironically saying this
---
Eh. Highly depends on the buyer of course, and I'm not really going to bother doing the analysis since that will depend on the relative quantities of materials on those planets. I personally don't consider it particularly good, since the best PI wormholes will contain far more planets which expand production capabilities and diversification of obtainable materials.
---
My connection issues went away once I started winning.
---
I like the idea of being able to do this solo, playing with a ton of risk, and then also possibly flying some various ships. I was looking at [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3r6LzRsuKxlV77mnquc-khxu63_P9L1wtMhTlOqteI/edit#gid=2089395128) and I see that a Deimos, Cerberus, Eagle and Ishtar are all ships that can be flown. I've been playing since 2012 and have never flown an Ishtar. That alone is reason to start up Abyssals.
---
And on that note op;once you find your wormhole, check the KB for it and see if a corp/alliance has been killing a lot of stuff in it (or getting killed alot) over a long-ish period of time and contact the CEO, ask them what they call their system.
---
you probably think you sound cool or smart, you don't.
---
If they're structures in Tribute, then they are subject to our searing gaze. Eve Mogul is run or owned by some guy in NCdot named jerome? something, so naturally we gonna burn it.
---
It's not even connecting to chat for me. Keep hitting the retry button every 30 seconds for the last hour and still nothing
---
8-10 years ago your hypothesis would be a thing.
---
what's causing it is that a ton of reaction loot drops when we kill them
---
Uhhhh ... collect rare skins and save them for later but actually end up being attached to and unable to sell them.
---
Yep its that Jerome from NC.
---
Wat? Why?
---
May have been me. Had a whole Corp, Raitaru Innovation, back when "Raitaru" was just the last name of a dude from the lore. It's literally all we did was farm out those kits. 
---
It was especially cool back then cause caps in lowsec were extremely rare, and supers non-existent, but we had to run these hybrid gangs against pvp focused gangs that outgunned and outskilled us daily. 
---
Lots of innovating going on and we were pretty damn successful. Pure EvE.
---
I started last year and am loving it, and there’s not much difference between starting the game 15 years after launch and starting 16 years after. 
---
Pretty much everyone playing today started out new with everyone else playing having years of experience on them. Nearly everyone who started in 2003/2004 has quit by now, and the ones who haven’t are an extreme minority. 
---
Just join a new player friendly alliance, Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Pos Party, Signal Cartel (they’re a bit different than most but definitely worth checking out), and Aideron Robotics are all very good and will each offer a different experience.
---
Iapetan.
---
Yeah, when I was new-ish I was training covops frigs and got into a magnate and just did a loop between Kinakka and Tama and scooped drones up. Made more doing that than just about anything as a newbro and I got pretty good at scanning because of it.
---
That's what I'm saying though. It's really not obscure. Shit, if you have a combat ship with a scanner it's even less obscure since you can find all sorts of interesting shit out there.
---
Hi bear! I think I would be able to advocate for the health of FW and Null effectively from where I am currently
---
If goon and pandemic are so powerful, why don't they bring their titans to high sec and conquer it.
---
It was horrible, and one of the most broken design decisions CCP ever made.
---
Not really. ASCN and then ISS both roleplayed that it was a thing, but both still got steamrolled the second it came to action.
---
Yes. I was there. I think you missed my point.
---
A huge amount of the resources the Empires used to spend on themselves is now funnelled to Concord, who ostensibly provides for the defense of it's members.
---
Keep in mind, the Empires do have many thousands of ships, and unlike us, can keep all of them active at all times, whereas the cluster-wide combined capsuleer  population "logged on" at any given time caps out at 40k or so.
---
I'm talking about equivlancy here I'm saying in comparison there weak, they where just the first two that came to mind. Also game mechanic of Concord.
---
It's a great drawing of my favourite ship in the game. =)
---
I sell fedos.
---
what
---
Counterpoint, a quick google search would help OP refine his question to not seem like a troll.
---
? i think you're projecting there
---
If your point was saying it was a thing 8-10 years ago when it wasn't a thing, then I totally followed it.
---
That would be, "instead of losing every structure we owned and disbanding entirely"
---
The war really ended with losses of X47 hull timer and the DW iHub, I don't think the north properly contested any serious timer after that.
---
Side note, worst FC I flew under in that war was from VDD. The moron had free move on, WTBKillmarks got into the fleet on a bean alt, and fleetwarped your FC's fleet into a bomber field. 
---
If you know him, let him know even Darkness plebs think he is trash tier, cheers.

Problem, officer?

---
They're going easy on us.
---
Remember how if you shoot anyone in hisec without a really good reason your ship gets destroyed in several seconds no matter what? This is canon, it's extremely powerful Jovian tech.
---
Also Iapetan titans.
---
Also they have a colossal population.
---
ok. why do you want to make it so that cloaky ceptor eyes are nonviable? as an FC in NC you must appreciate people that volunteer for eyes on enemy stagings, and as such you'll know how difficult it will likely be for you and less experienced FCs to be able to do that when you'll need people with dedicated toons in the system/logged off in the system. 
---
also whilst i don't claim to know anything about coding or Eve code, the module would seem to need a cycle time to have cap usage, meaning that you wouldn't be able to instantly deactivate it you would need to wait for the cycle to end. This would obviously have a lot of unintended consequences if that is what would happen, especially for high latency players such as myself. 
---
finally why do you want to "fix" afk cloaky camping? To me its a good thing in an era of Eve with massive inflation and easily defendable capitals used for PVE, its not like it stops people from using their space, they just choose not to use it because then they'd need to actually pvp to defend their pve ship (the horror).  
---
tldr why do you want to make cloaky ceptor eyes nonviable? why do you want to "fix" cloaky camping (going so far as to want to find "other solutions")?
---
Not positive but I believe there's a category on the forums
---
 None of them have names, but occupants usualy name them.
---
Ah, thanks for reminding me about the griffin navy issue. F
---
Sephie and Sin Alama of exit strategy good guys, I'd rate them higher than VDD tbh, although the best (named) autz corp is Winnie Blues and VB Crew https://discord.gg/sS7fNps
---
Both WBVB and exit are in tactical supremacy so plenty of great Aussies to pvp with (in total there's 6 autz corps in TIKLE)
---
Can confirm WBVB is an awesome Corp with mad Aussie lads

No wonder its hard to get people to join this game...

If you're comparing arbitrary roleplay nonsense, it gets even sillier if you section off parts of the arbitrary roleplay nonsense and say "Well, not that.  That's a game mechanic"
---
They have loads, [you just don't see em deployed a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCvdQZXgDVg)
---
Personally in terms of industry I figure that capitals aren't somehow impossible to deploy in highsec, they just don't let capsuleers fly them there. Similar deal with high-end ore. Why would they take the least rich space for themselves? They probably have loads of spod up in 1.0sec, you just aren't allowed to mine it. You get stuck with the leftover scordite they can't be arsed to mine. 
---
The NPC empires canonically have trillions of people in them, they can easily field tens of millions of people at once; compare that to capsuleer alliances that cap out at ~10k ships (which might amount to 10-20 million crewmen, but that's at the absolute high end of our deployment power).
---
Let's compromise.
---
I'll huck nickles at your face until you can afford a titan, if you promise to cry and do a shuffling dance while I chuck the change.
---
You don't want to look like a poor when your Keepstar gets killed.
---
&gt; Incursions. Make the rewards come in the form of loot and salvage. That way, a ninja salvaging team could entice combat.

Isn't that already what the rewards are from on incursions?
---
Are you saying Australians are filthy botters?
---
Concord Response Titans when???
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I want to remove cloaky camping exclusively because there is no viable counter play for it. Quite a few of recent changes in eve online remove the ability to effect other people or make money while not playing at all. Cloaky eyes are very useful true, but suppressing newbro's in alliance by having multiple regions camped out indefinitely with no counter isn't good for the game, in my opinion.
---
No.  We're saying the seppos all turn on their bots when they go to bed.
---
This is Eve. You’re doing it wrong. You’re supposed to wait until someone offers you their friendship; only then do you steal their Titan.
---
Fulling out the fat wads right now… By Jove my enemies will know that I am baller.
---
I love you, please join WBVB if you ever get bored, you'd be gladly welcomed, even by our resident sepos (they know their place)
---
We have slash generators pinned. So...
---
F2P stemmed the bleed for a while and the recent "event" boosted numbers temporarily, however numbers are back to pre this event and falling again. 
---
Please do not confuse this with the usual Summer drop as that starts within the next 10 years historically, however the bleed since Christmas was nothing we had seen before. 
---
What changes would you encourage CCP to make to stop the constant decline of the player base?
---
Sin Alama and Mekwell are some of the best gang FCs in AUTZ atm, they bring some really fun fleets :D
---
Can you stop spamming your link in local please?
---
\&gt;... but at this point the empires look like minor alliances when compared to goon and pandemic for example. 
---
Considering the innumerable masses of NPCs that even pirate factions can feed daily without issue, do you really think you're seeing the whole iceberg?
---
think its Sinister. over and over
---
B)
---
nobody mines or rats during war time (of course you can find 1-2 idiots in every big alliance which show off their supers and feed them to wormholers or whatever)
---
I think the best way would to focus on two different paths.   
---
1. Expand the marketing to other platforms to encourage new players to give eve a chance. The support for twitch streamers is a good start but I would encourage them to expand that further.   
---
2. I think more communication with the community would help immensely. The more people I speak to, the common consensus is that CCP isn't listening the concerns of the community. I think more community involvement would go a long way when it comes to retention.   
---
I hope that answers your question.
---
To add to other comments I'd suggest you use the potency booster to get a bigger standing boost
---
No, but the filthy hares living on their land are
---
I personally only spam my link during null bloc fights. A bunch of my supporters are spamming it in other areas. Lets be honest though, I've seen normal local sperg and having to see my name is way less terrible than what is normally said and spammed,
---
I tend to play in AUS TZ because I work late. There’s some action, but it’s not necessarily popping off or anything most of the time
---
I'd say only Sirens and Dromi worth investing, I wouldn't bother with the rest as they get defanged quickly by anything significant enough to be called as fleet.  
---
If you decide to throw some t2 fighters nonetheless, consider building them yourself since they are normally overpriced in Jita.
---
Citadel defense is an illusion
---
Either people don't even bother touching your deathstar or enmassed the whole Jedi order to take you down
---
i was watching RonUSMC's stream when this happened, and the poor guy wanted to retract his drones :))  Status was "returning to drone bay" but they were still orbiting the ship like crazy, under rats fire of course. Good thing it was too late for my TZ to play
---
right, time to move to the chinese server, where the limit is your imagination
---
Thats included in the deal yes
---
U right
---
Would ccp refund the isk for this?
---
Is this what retarded players do when they're not playing eve
---
Iapetans are massive enough to have significant tidal effects on planets they're in orbit around. These things individually out-mass Keepstars and probably have significantly more firepower. It's likely Upwell technology has been used to modernise them somewhat. And don't forget that these things are unlikely to fly alone. They're likely to have vast support fleets alongside them.
---
A frigate piloted by the unascended takes 5 people, a capsuleer can do it alone. Cruisers have 200 without a capsuleer and battleships have thousands. With capsuleers those numbers are severly cut. A battleship operate with maybe 1000 people. A cruiser with 50.
---
They maybe have the chance of killing one undefended lapetan.. But honestly I would not be so sure. A lapetan is the size of dozens if not maybe 100+ titans and their firepower is unmatched by anything other then other lapetans. The empires never dared to fight them out of fear of their entire fleets being wiped completely, they were so costly to built that it was unfeasible to mass-produce (literally not enough resources). Jumping it close to a planet would destabilize it's orbit.
---
I wasnt even thinking this big. Thanks for the thought.
---
Except the empires do not have Jove tech, Concord does and is not affiliated with any one empire.
---
Does that trailer have the glorious voice of the narrator of The Stanley Parable?
---
That's because you don't see the empires' power, unfortunately. CCP really doesn't do a good job of filling the universe with anything besides the Capsuleers, save for the occasional NPC mining fleet which is honestly unimpressive.
---
The empires possess Iapetan titans, vast warships over a hundred kilometers in length with the mass of small moons. Capsuleers tear city-sized chunks out of moons to build ships, sure, but the empires destroy whole planets for the sake of building these things. In addition, it's likely the empires possess similar masses in "smaller" warships such as the thousands of "standard" Titans the Amarr are known to possess, as well as other fleet elements.
---
It's highly likely that all of the capsuleers together could maybe fight a war against a single empire to a standstill, at great cost. The empires *will* unite, possibly even dragging in the Jove and *certainly* dragging in CONCORD (who has the technology to shut down capsuleer ships at the pod level, rendering them useless) if the capsuleers ever try anything.
---
the counter play is to fight what they drop on you, but i'm not going to try and change your mind. thank you for clarifying your position.
---
Thanks for stopping by and asking the question
---
It's not so much that CONCORD's anti-capsuleer tech is any more powerful than anything the capsuleers have. It's that it cheats. It's special Jove tech provided via the SoCT that interfaces with backdoors in the Capsule systems to shut down capsuleer ships directly. Hence why CONCORD can obliterate capsuleer ships in seconds but struggles to contain Sansha's Nation or the Triglavians. Their actual weapons are not any more powerful than Capsuleer weapons.
---
You were really ready to throw a ray of sunshine onto that conversation, weren’t you?
---
Pics. Idk if shes worth a punisher or an aeon
---
Yeah I definitely agree. I actually think it's worth suggesting to newbros especially if they are around lowsec.
---
You're a hero

Does it automatically link to my account? I went to the link account link and it just brought me to the EVE website.

Sure he cares more what the pile of dogshit on the driveway thinks then what you do

How do you get that SKIN? Is it from abyssal sites?
---
happy cake day o7
---
I like the discovery part through missions and other ingame areas. Still, I feel like too much of my ingame knowledge comes from Googling a reddit post from 2008.
---
I’m glad you feel that way, I expected nothing but downvotes since I spoke ill of null on Reddit haha
---
If they went out there I’m sure everyone flying with those guys are having a blast, exit is one of the silliest group of people I’ll ever had the pleasure of flying with :D
---
both of our tataras died from completely separate circumstances. neither were because of loot drops
---
Goon supers jumped in with 90 sec left until DT and didn't actually do much.
---
that's a weird stretch but okay
---
40k DED LP (From new Invasion sites), 100 million ISK and 400 Survey Datasheets from the Abyss or Invasions.
---
Nice. Thanks!
---
They should put this in game. And i think we need decals tgat we could put on any shit to customize
---
How many threads get posted here about how shit the Security Team is.. It is really sad to see how people are blinded by the 6 monthly "we did security stuff and banned bots".. that are back within 24 hours..
---
-
---
They have been shit at this for years now and constantly you pat them on the back.. 
---
Rewarding terrible work is self harm, but hey lets continue to dumpster this game while it is still accepting subs.
---
Lastly this has low upvotes for a "well done" thread...
---
Require capacitor of a cloak means that if you use a cheap ship to cloaky camp, you need to gimp the fit to remain permanently cloaked. Means cloaky camping will require either a more significant per account investment or be less effective.
---
Maybe he should ask The Mittani (TM) since he knows things.
---
What would happen to the citadels if the owning faction changes of the system?
---
&gt; Lastly this has low upvotes
---
Have you ever seen an EVE thread on Reddit with many upvotes?
---
The bot problem is a problem of players. If they did not want something they should not be having at a particular point in the cycle, then botting would make no sense.
---
Also, in every IT conversation I ever had it has become painfully clear to me that people do not understand that security is not a technology problem. And they just can’t seem to wrap their head around that idea.
---
There were a few different de-buffs discussed. It would be up to the CCP devs working on it, but some of the stuff discussed was citadels going into low-power, not being able to online certain service modules, the owning corp taking a standings hit or some other stuff I probably missed.
---

Oh, so there actually is an LP system with these invasions? Fuck man, I don't know any of the info about this expansion.

I wonder if he ever got his GED

I’ve getting that error for hrs now
---
Nah, MoA killed MoA. They were never meant for farms &amp; fields sov but went that route anyways and it kiled them.
---
Hate to be someone to try and clarify some other dudes words
---
But pretty sure he means 8-10 years ago someone would be on the forum just like this guy hypothesizing if an alliance would do this,  not that it was actually a thing that was successfully done
---
&gt;The best 2 corps in a AUTZ are VDD (in NC) and tickle.
---
A nancy krab corp and a legacy krab alliance are certainly not the best autz choices lmao. Not as bad as the trashheap that is kenshin but not the "2 best corps in autz".
---
Same, but no-one else in my corp or alliance seem to be getting it
---
Seems that way for me as well everyone else is fine 🤬
---
Darkness is a bad alliance to be in, in this video game.
---
Well looks like there is a few of us at least
---
That would be nice to see if they get implemented in 10 years and mass produced in 13.
---
Your ship actually drifts off-course when you get near one.
---
It’s as common in game as it is in life, do you trust all your co-workers? All your friends? I wouldn’t go as far to say you can trust no one though, because as common as betrayal can be, there is also a lot of team work and loyalty.
---
Because they are just humans piloting their ships.
---
You are a capsuleer.
---
1 capsule can replace 80% of a ship's crew.

Phase 2 of 2000. Welcome to eve online

The "Gaze into the Abyss" one has got some mass effect reaper vibes going on

Every bongzar needs a set of stand up shadows

The last thing EVE needs is more goddamn power creep. Titans should never have been a thing.
---
If you are talking about blueprint Copies, they cannot be researched any further than they already are.
---
I'm probably using the wrong term them, I mean using them to make Tech II Blueprints.
---
I'll give that ago
---
My best advice would be to go read the Research page on the Uniwiki.
---
I wouldn’t want to restate what they have already done and potentially input some errors.
---
Being able to start an invention job and reliably inventing anything you want are 2 different things.
---
The second one is really skill intensive
---
nice.  congrats
---
So i logged in an alt of mine in NPC corp and trying to ninja salvage in a catalyst. Got aggro from rats, died. I then popped in a Gila (not max skills, let's say medium to less medium) and tried to kill them on my own and not on a foothold system but perimeter/adjacent . Found 50km from a player owned Azbel, killed a bunch of them, new fleet of rats came up, almost killed me, managed to run. I teamed up with a random guy in a rattlesnake , fleet up, let's kill rats and split 50/50 the wrecks. 
---
Once he looted a wreck killed by both of us while in fleet, he got concorded and became a criminal (probably he had safety red). I said to him "mate come get your loot from the wreck". He said: "fuck it, i'm off for the night, you loot it".
---
45 mil from all salvaged wrecks and 392 mil from the guy's wreck (pith-x shield booster). I called off my alt job that evening and switched to main toon. Good day for \~1 hour of roaming in triglav invaded systems.
---
You have to do invention on the blueprint copies.
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Invention](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Invention)

Who?
---
ratting carrier will get blapped fast, just be aligned to a citadel at all times, depending on dread and rats. For Serpentis i'm always aligned to a citadel, and whenever it drops (really ofter because it's a -0.9 system) i bookmark the site, dock, bring my capital gun fit Moros and kill it fast.
---
Invention, ya, that would be the Term I'm looking for then, thanks.   
---
Is there anything Specific I might want to know thats not to clear in the Wiki?
---
This skin has been out for other trig ships for a while now.
---
The failure rate can feel deceptively high, so don't put all your ducks in one basket expecting a golden egg. Also know how much the T2 item is going to cost to manufacture, the materials are a lot different than T1 stuff, you need normal minerals AND moon mining components for many T2 items, sometimes PI material as well.
---
So if you are looking for profits, don't expect to be making huge amounts depending on where you are getting your supplies and where you are selling to.
---
Got you, thanks O7.
---
Hi Bunny o/ I like your site :)
---
What's your opinions on the current state of wormhole space, and how it interacts with the rest of New Eden? 
---
I'll probably vote for you anyways but will you buy me a Leshak if I do? 
---
Good luck. o7
---
10/10 your right about it all and gl in the csm
---
Keep in mind that a lot of blueprints are either straight up trash or so niche that they don't really have a value. For example, CCP simply mirrored large rigs over to capital sizes, which is why we have dumb stuff like Capital scanning rigs.
---
I cannot imagine a time stuff like that would ever come in handy, much less in actual demand beyond one or two meme fits.
---
That being said, I wouldn't trash them, just get a container, label it junk, and toss all the BPCs in there. Maybe ccp does a balance pass or alters them in the future to make them not as horrible.
---
The best propaganda to come out during the War of the Poles/North-South War/Goon vs NC conflict has been aimed at NPCs...
---
Shows you how bored they both are by the state of null, I guess
---
I was kind of expecting 3 phases.
---
I was there, it was an absolutely hilarious and fantastic fleet.
---
XD lol ya, That's a problem I've come across; there ARE some BPs that have pretty good profit (like 40-50mil for a 20min run). But the Sale volume of the item is so low, that it might take 3-4 months to even sell it.
---
Truffle shuffle?
---
There's certainly aspects of security that can be helped out by technology, though.
---
For example, with the right type &amp; frequency of logging, you can fairly swiftly &amp; accurately reverse the effects of "bad stuff" ... an option that simply isn't around if you haven't built the (technological) infrastructure to do it.
---
No matter how well you design your security setup, someone will be able to get around it; however, if you're not careful, basically anyone can get around it. So there is a baseline that needs to be there.
---
Finally, if CCP could make content that is *fundamentally difficult to bot* ... then we wouldn't have a bot problem.
---
Unfortunately, this is 1) a hard problem and 2) if they were to solve it, much of their playerbase might also not be able to do the content... Which might be bad for them. : )
---
looks like a flying video card
---
Hi friend!   
---
As much as I would love to claim I know about wormhole space and it's occupants, I don't. I WH groups are critical to the null and lowsec ecosystem and are heavily misrepresented in balance passes and sweeps. I hope someone who knows something about it makes it onto the council this year. As for your Leshak, I don't really have Leshak money right now :(
---
What is "this"? Elaborate.
---
Whoever donated the titan is actually a hero.
---
Glad it went well! Sad I missed it =(
---
You should look him up it's mainly satirical

Did you just gloss over INIT being there with snuffed?

I don't see why not.

Go blow it up. Crying about it on Reddit won't fix it.

Fucking mini games.

I would happily donate all my corp assets to anyone who can teach me

Thanks for leaving this comment.

The only thing better than starting today is starting yesterday.
---
Have you ticked the option to download everything?
---
I've been a lurker here for quite some time. I agree with most of what you say, but because of your well known animosity for Goons and their playstyle, you come off as anti Goon. This is coming from someone who just returned to the game from a long hiatus. Noone seemed to complain this much about playstyles ruining the gameplay of some people when NC and PL heli dicked anyone and everyone in the old days and yes been there and dealt with it. We got told to adapt or GTFO. Seems like its time for others to adapt or GTFO like we were told. So I can agree with you on some of whats wrong and even maybe some of the solutions, but I have no simpathy for those that can't adapt like we were told to. For the record I am not a member of Goons in any way. I live in NPC null and I deal with Caps and small gangs at least every other day.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Looks at 10s of billions of isk in skins..

Nope can't sell 'em.

[Nova and Polaris](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c6&amp;staticdest=c6&amp;effect=Magnetar&amp;shattered=_unfiltered) the two C6/6 Magnetars. Nova being particularly famous as the subject of [Lord Maldoror of Rooks and Kings' epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrYe_4vHzgE).
---
This is 100% false... There are absolutely problems with optimization or load in the servers which manifest in lag and rubber banding in the client. You'll see this a lot of you're running multiple clients in different regions, in the quite region there are no problems, in the busy region you get random lag. It's not full tidi, but it's definitely perceptible lag and it sucks...
---
You probably injected into Git Gud Spec V
---
Goodbye and thanks for all the fish!
---
Would be deeply amusing to get dropped by limitless Concord titans.
---
Run your client with logging enabled (you can do this from the launcher options)
---
When you have the problem, report a bug and attach the logs.

There's plenty idiots play Eve and they're easy prey. If you have to ask before playing a free game, it's probably not for you. You could try it though. Join a corp, you'll be fine.
---
I agree with you tbh
---
terminology needs to be precise.
---
research - increase the ME or TE of a tech one BPO
---
copy - copy a tech one BPO to create a tech one BPC with exactly the same ME and TE as the BPO you copied. can be more than one run BPC
---
invent - use one run of a tech one BPC to have a chance of creating a tech two BPC. Ignores the ME and TE of the tech one BPC used. Chance of success and results ME and TE is dependant on input materials (decryptors etc)
---
Part of the empress fleet is still in amarr system and there's a beacon you can warp to. Maybe 20-30 capital ships. Titans, dreads and such. For a new player it's worth warping out there to see the ships.
---
If you are looking for a fight where you can
---
Solo vs small gang. Its def BC. 
---
T1 Cruiser can only 1v1 or maybe 1v2 at best. 
---
And you need to spend much money if you want to 1 v small gang in a cruiser - you got to buy faction cruiser or t2 cruisers which cost more than 200mil at least. 
---
BC, even if its tec1, can solo vs small gang easily. Because you can make it tank like a battleship or even more if you fit it. While you would stull use medium-sized gun like cruisers. So your tracking isnt bad too.
---
Also you can fit MJD which is so useful in solo roaming. 
---
Best part is , its hella cheap. Its about 50-100m depends on your fit. But the insurance gives half price of total cost after you shio blows up.
---
Problem is, u said u only got 40m. You need a little bit more isk i guess.
---
If sale volumes are that low, I'd be suspicious of the Jita sell price.
---
I once bought a six pack of ice-tea at the supermarket and the cashier only scanned one bottle, oh boy!
---
Johnny Splunk aka Eve Scout fit scanning rigs on a capital and went exploring in it and got it on his killmail. I think he said only two had been on a killmail. Pretty sure it was a dread.
---
I think I'd rather have my dick eaten off then have to farm any of that bullshit.
---
I do however enjoy killing people running that bullshit.

Conflicted .......

It was the best fleet i´ve ever been a part of aaand the stream chat was wonderful =) it was a joy to see his joy while we welped our ships ;)
---
More like extracted Pay Subs.

I haven’t played in ages but what is that ship, looks like caldari and drifters hybrid.
---
I was just scouting a new wormhole from our system when I saw a multi-box fleet of Orca at a refinery with a bunch of augmented mining drones out, I saw they there still out when DT happened.
---
I logged back in ASAP and scooped them all and cloaked as the Orca logged back in, tried to sell them back at a major discount over Jita, got told to shove it, sold them myself, ~700m in my pocket.
---
Was in fleet and watching him on stream and the guy is just inspirational. For to go through what he's been through and yet bring the entertainment and fun last night, thanks man the world needs more folks like you. Had a great evening, thank you and to the folks that organised it and wish you well with your illness and all the best for your streaming plans.

You tell us what it was OP.

one time i was shitting at work and remembered i didn't have toilet paper at home... so i took it with me
---
yes. I've also just been in the same system and or region as it is. it is also with 74d of fuel. and there are two access lists. 1 for Corp - all access for free. 1 for everyone - free docking, and some service charges.
---
Bc are really good but you will certainly feed your first ones. Try your hands on something you can replace more easily. People will say frigate but i d start with destroyer same price but easier to fly and you actually could get kills in a thrasher or coercer or corax. Move up to a brutix or myrm once you know what you are doing.
---
Capsuleers are very very weak vs empires. Like 0.00000000001% of population.
---
Thou we run ships better, we are vastly outnumbered and outgunned by empires. We just not see in-game the civilian &amp; military traffic of empires.
---
Also, CONCORD can simply shutdown us (is part of capsuleer license contract) ... which do happen when u do illegal stuff in HS.
---
New race. Triglavian.
---
Is because of the "new" chat servers, they need to synchronize with the game ones. Chat includes results of probe scanner, directional etc.

You can\`t really do anything.

I imagine it's cultural and/or traditional.

Heck, the Minmatar have camouflage *stations*.

Better yet, a new skin that takes advantage of the the new "holograms" that seem to be all the rage - and projects the [crab rave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM) animation on the top of the ship.
---
Yup, Salvage materials from the new invasions
---
You heard exactly right. The last newbie that joined this game did so in early 2009. It's all just 10-year veterans now!
---
Well we don't read for free so pay up!
---
They have reimbursed items/ships lost due to pretty much any kind of server failure in the past.
---
Your lost ship/pod should be petitionable, as is the case for pretty much every server failure induced loss.

Reek!

I tried to get someone to write an article about what Ayn Rand would think of the economy in EVE. Only got a really weird erotic fanfiction.

&gt; The cloaking devices of EVE should require capacitor to function and continually cycle

And there goes any chance of a vote from me.
---
I went there alone just to saw a big fight and I was able to loot almost for 400m. As a relatively new player it was the most fun experience I ever had in EVE.
---
I stole some memes. Ik im a monster
---
understood, sky marshall dumbo
---
That’s a great perspective but it’s not what I mean.
---
Security is not a technology problem. Like hunger isn’t a logistics problem. There is no problem driving a truck to all the places where people need food. We see that we just don’t want to do it [not everybody everywhere all the time, obviously]. It involves logistics, but it is not a logistics problem, it’s a social problem.
---
Likewise IT security. It is not a technology problem. It involves technology but it is not a technology problem, it’s a social problem. If people did not want to breach technology and steal shit there would never be a need for the vast complex of methods and technologies that we have to throw up as barriers to people’s attempts to breach security.
---
But maybe a game like EVE does not exist if we didn’t have this black streak of meanness in us that makes us do the things we do in there. And then security becomes our self-inflicted punishment for being the assholes that we are. The game as metaphor. How’s that for your recursive irony?
---
you are definitely right, I was tired and mistook them for commanders.
---
Also \*some\* elite rats have better loot, eg the elite battleships in the "silence the informant" mission drop elite AI.
---
Why wouldn't you compare one gaming company to another?
---
no they don't. They match player ships profiles.
---
He also narrates Dungeons 3!
---
Ah yeah. But then it's just a question about the loot table. Also I think that's only the case for elite drones.
---
Yea man terrible work, tracing probably thousand of items or more and checking where they went, who was involved, if you can reverse it.
---
Fuck CCP, how can that take so long, stupid idiots. It's totally my fault that I lost my account but they still do it, man they suck
---
I never said CCP is perfect and that they do not make pretty questionable decisions, but every time I had to contact their support and I was friendly, they were super helpful and fast. This post isn't exactly about security and definitely not about bots, it's more about how CCP has a quite decent support, I forgot a couple of times to cancel my subscription and they stopped it in hindsight and gave me my money back, no other game company I know of would do that shit.

They were cool and all when they came out, and full-out war to stop the construction of a superweapon that could have devastating effects on a battlefield was very cinematic.
---
They should have done a limit on capitals per member or systems controlled.
---
They're doing a fourth.
---
Because they're seen to be working with panfam and are thus considered panfam by goons.
---
and NPC T2 haulers :) (they can give T2 salvage). and few other ones.
---
Omg hai blazing &lt;3
---
But I'd like to see ccp do something wrt to it as it would make ratting more engaging as you wouldn't be able to predict spawns as much.
---
The major problem I think is that it's hard to see if your opponent is building a Titan and where, and hard to prevent its construction. Some of the best battles in EVE were fought over supercapital shipyards.
---
BTW what are the elite battleships ?
---
I know that forlorn anoms have lots of elite, but those are cruisers, frigates, not BS (maybe BS but those die too fast)
---
You know nothing John snow !
---
It would be a new ship. Think normal battle ships with with more shield, more resistance but also more damage and much better application and ewar. Battleship maybe nuet, heavy stasis tackler and such?
---
if I look here 
---
http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/inventory.php?group_id=612
---
all the "dread " BS are elite. However they are almost the same as their non elite part. The only difference some have is the bounty, and the DPS they inflict.

I'd say it's somewhat more common in EVE than in real life. In EVE we have the insulation of knowing that we won't suffer personal consequences for our actions and so we're free to be dicks to each other. IRL there's personal consequences, from social ostracisation to arrest and imprisonment, associated with stealing from other people so we tend not to do it.
---
"Burn Jita" fleets getting BOSONed by CONCORD. That would be funny. And the accidential killmails it would produce even more, \^\^
---
&gt;That or join the Zerg and have to live like your an employee for a Wal Mart Sweat shop.
---
TBH I never understood why the people that were part of those "exploitative" corps didn't just leave. If you don't like your current corp, find a new one. It's a game.
---
I'm not really sure, but they certainly do not care as it is a huge business and they probably profit more if they allow it.
---
They once had to "forbid" it because of media outrage but everything is back to normal and gambling and selling skins is making a comeback.
---
I wanted their help because I think their security system is flawed and maybe even exploitable, but I'm not sure about the last part.
---

---
Fun fact, the J-codes are the Right Ascensions of real world radio and gamma ray sources.
---
For example, Kappa, who's proper name is J165943 in Eve, is FIRST object J165943.6+373410, which is a neutron star.
---
Having to use espionage to find out where they're making it or even if they're making it makes it way more dramatic, but it should be easier to track, I agree.
---
That is strange. looting a wreck you don't own should only give you a suspect flag, but not get you concoreded. You need to agress another capsuleer that has no suspect flag, is no cirminal or not at war or in fleet with you. 
---
Well, good loot for you.
---
I would btw recommend exploration firgates for ninja salvaging in invasions. E.g. a Mangate can warp after 2.5 seconds if fitted for it and has a bonus on the time your salvager runs per level. Instead of 10s it will be 7.5s with racial frigate at level V.
---
Just warp off as soon as the rats yellowbox you. Having a cloak is also nice.
---
Thanks to all of you, had a break for 1 year and came back to pay Quebber my respect. Was a fun night and great Videos!!

can you link your zkill? would be cool to eye the fit

Amazing work! I have two questions for ya. Do you take isk or dollars? Would you like to have a commission job to make some more posters for me? Your work is great!!
---
You havent checked code's killboard apparently?

I am absolutely not trolling, the question is most definitely genuine and I will be using this information.

Why come and ask the question here? Because this is by far the most generous, amazing and affable gaming community ever. Wouldn’t you agree?

If you look at zkb, hundreds of ratting carriers are murdered each week. Not sure how is it 100% safe unless you're in goons

When titans start becoming as usable and cheap as essentially throw away dreads you apparently just solo capital fleets.

It was added last Tuesday with the minor conduits, CCP are slowly adding more content into the invasions every week or so.
---
i think removing bots from the game is more important than fixing a probably complicated loading issue :)
---
wait untill you have maybe 500-999 then place them in cargo on a pvp ship and get a nice super long killmail
---
This expansion should be called EVE:  Anthem.  Patch-As-A-Service, in about 6 months invasions will be fun!
---
What price do you put these killrights at? Do people really buy killrights that cost more than like 10 mil?
---
Must of thought we weren't watching and tried to sneak in some dank ticks, but we were, so into the dumpster he went

Can you do the sites solo ? What ship ?

I think yes, I was burning the same way when I made first tries to kill Dagan. but this was irl
---
Cool ships dont look at explosions!
---
This is a good post, and although I don't think you go far enough in where low APM isk generation should be nerfed to, it's one of the more convincing CSM pitches from a nullblobber.
---
&gt; I’d like to see a corresponding nerf to cloaky camping
---
Cloaky camping is the only counter to the perfect immediate intel of local, so it's important that these suggestions get actioned in the order you put down here. And in fact once active hunting is actually possible, there's much less reason to cloaky camp in the first place.

You'll get tackled and blobbed

I have like 500, yo.

whats the basis for them being number 4? and who are considered 1, 2, 3
---
Fit a mjd as well as a mwd. Sure you lose the range control of the web however you can reliably turn off any prop mod of smaller shot due to the dual neuts.

Means that it’s not insta death if you get long pointed and blobbed.

I sometimes stole modules from the loot hangar when I needed them.

What's your intended use? Without knowing your skills and goals for the ship we can't answer your question besides with really generic advice. What kind of combat? Pvp, pve, large fleet, small fleet, solo, null sec, low sec, wh, high sec?
---
yeah but what tools? does CCP let you just interface with game files like that?
---
Here's the lore about Poitot:

---
Pretty much my all favorite post but can't find it anymore ...
---
By Caldari agent missions, you mean the tutorial missions?
---
FW missions or grinding plexes?
---
Null finally needs a change where war is the better thing then blueing everyone.
---
Just give him a normal welcome...he is still innocent

\^underrated comment

Well thank you, l just like the little things .... just wish more CSMs would focus on PvE but hay ho l care very little for null politics

where did you get the fraternity tag?

i want one, i like chinese farmers they feed my zkill
---
Just started the game and I need some starting capital. Wich ores should I mine for easy money? Ie. Wich ores to priorize?
---
Regarding cyno jammers. Once they are damaged you can't switch them on. So it is absolutely possible to sneak in some dreads and "incap" them. 
---
At which point the defender can't do anything to get them back online fast except anchor a new one. I think having one in RF prevents you from onlining another one but I'd have to recheck.

either it's some cyno noobshit or some kind of 1bil++ blinged out thing

Id highly recommended against joining the massive blue donut in which these  guys reside.
---
I'm not sure how prevalent it is now, but Near2 and its ilk was a right PITA. Good luck sneaking up on anything in a pocket if someone was alert and paying attention to that (and thus warning all the sleepyheads in the group). 
---
In between that and botters/bot aspirants (pardon the term), whole areas of space are just pointless to roam, because you already know the likelihood of ~x~ group undocking some stuff for a fight is close to 0. WH 'whaling' groups don't have that problem so much, as with a good roll they can get stuck in before everything has a chance to safe up.
---
I agree about the Marauder, over the past few years I've only seen them used by people inside their groups super umbrella. I reckon you'd have to slash it's build price to at *least* half of what it is now to see them out and about more, because as it is there's very few reasons you'd use one over a HAW dread.

You didn't poop your pants you are actually a piece of shit.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
It's still not the purpose of the CSM, it's completely against the balanced player view it's supposed to provide CCP with which is for the benefit of the game's overall health.
---
Ahahahaha
---
Just heard it &amp; was thinking that exact comment was a nope from me xD
---
Lets put the betterment of my coalition over game health :thinking:
---
Or munnins to kill you idiots because you're bad at coordinating anything.
---
You do realize that the policy of removing dead-ass candidates is at the discretion of CCP, not me; right? If you somehow get elected and pull the same shit you have been that's probably what will happen. I can't control that, but I can benefit from it. I have made my eve career benefiting from my adversaries when they do really stupid shit. If you vote for somebody like Creecher or Vince Draken, then guess what?  
---
 **YOUR VOTES DON'T COUNT.**
---
The balanced player view is because the vision was that each player would specialize in a certain area. There has never been a candidate that could provide a completely balanced player view as far as one candidate advocating for all.
---
There are those that have tried, but since they were not considered experts, they were ignored by the group they were attempting to help (Brisc Rubal with various groups, notably WH space, for a recent example)
---
They had a couple of other spaceship stuff at the time iirc.
---
Run combat missions.
---
You won't get rich quick, but you will earn enough to keep you in the appropriate ships and if you run them enough the LP earned can be quite lucrative by getting things from that factions store and resell.
---
at least hes honest about it lol
---
I have experience in FW. I see solo BCs all the time.
---
Generally what works is the BC that goes after cruiser and below. Use AB scram and multiple webs to get great tracking.  Use MJD to escape.  Works well with a naga or ferox.
---
I recently had a fun 5v1 in a Gnosis.  I fit as above but added a great active armor tank.  Took in 4x punishers and a kyte Jag and won.  You have to MJD out after killing the scramming ships so I didn't kill the Jag.
---
Outside FW complexes are a great place to fight since you can't warp around on grid.
---
Good luck
---
If the North were making that kind of isk off renters, they would've been down South fighting another WWB against the Goons. Everybody, with a little common sense, knows exactly how much isk each large eve entity makes.  Don't piss down my neck and tell me the loss doesn't matter isk wise. You Northerners just keep on sugar-coating a good ass kicking from the Goons.
---
I think the problem with this analysis is you're not really digging deep enough on these problems, it's just a bingo of card of mostly legitimate complaints you see on reddit regularly. They're all symptoms that have 2 or 3 degrees of seperation from the actual problem, it's like trying to pick up water with your hand, try to bandaid fix the symptoms of one problem or move your thumb a bit to cover that space just opens another one somewhere else.
---
I mean you're talking about blops and going straight to the cloaky camping issue and trying to talk about how to deal with that (whether it's a real problem is highly debateable) when the actual problem is that there's nothing in space worth dropping them on. Blops were good when people were flying rattlesnakes/tengus/drakes/etc or back when carriers couldn't sit aligned at 100 they could kill those 2 if you had a small gang of them. Today it's VNIs, rorquals, or carriers/supers at 100.
---
Same with your point about roaming content, current ansiblex gate aren't really that different from pre-phoebe jump bridges beyond them always being on your overview so I'm not sure that's really the issue as much as the proliferation of bigger toys you can't really fight.
---
Which again goes to this umbrella concept. The thing you're forgetting is that pre-Citadel the capital umbrella practically did not exist as a concept. Goons in Deklein had a similar thing with the ratting Chimeras that were always at jump cap, but that was more about saving the person tackled and you could pretty much always run away with no losses.
---
I know you called this a detailed examination, but what I think it's actually quite superficial. You need to dig deeper and look for common causes rather than trying to bandaid pain points.
---
how far does the cloud reach?
---
What ship would you recommend on running those combat missions.
---
yes you will soon be homeless
---
I cleared out a few hundred ships from a wormhole corp once, started after down time when they all went to sleep and was still getting them out of the wh like 20 hours later when they started logging on, took them about 20 minutes to figure out what was happening and I was sitting on coms with them silently waiting for the penny to drop while warping pods and ships past them
---
you broke eve

buy plex from ccp. sell plex ingame

any corvette

Go shoot rats in the belts, till your eye balls fall out.

ThIs is really the best way sure you can make isk to stay kind of happy but if you want lots of isk nothing beats work/hour like plex

If anything ever sells we need a huge war

You really have no idea how to post YouTube links on Reddit do you

I have started calling week 1 "Phase 0" as we had no conduits and there will be three tiers. The first week was the stage setting week.
---
I am sorry this content is not for you. The good news is this kind of content will make more and bolder pilots for you to kill later.
---
Makes perfect sense for nullsec power blocks to have secondary candidates that exploit the high candidate count by throwing as wide a net as possible in order to siphon votes off of representatives outside of nullsec which in turn will ensure more of their primary candidates get on.
---
Your pretty spot on.
---
There is a new group, called the Triglavian, I won't go too much into them but Uriel did here.
---
This ship is actually the Caldari/Triglavian hybrid. So not too far off.
---
Your pitch is anti-bot but you've spent most of your time in Delve rather than Period Basis, where the pie chart of shame showed most of the Goon bots are.  PB was not even the worst place for bots according to that, yet you weren't there.
---
That's really odd.  Almost as if you're full of shit and don't care about botting at all.
---
I have it for my Vedmak, I now have it for my Iki. Additionally, to me, it is the accomplishment itself I aimed for. This SKIN will forever mean to me the week I dedicated to getting it. I have no regret :D

You'll die! (which is good, pvp means people dying)

Good damage and application, quite fast and slippery because the high MWD speed and MJD. Treat it as a hit-and-run brawler, don't intend to stay to outbrawl anything above cruiser size - any decent BC will murder you. 
---
You can outrun most things that can kill you and kill everything else. :)
---
Overheats like one too!
---
Yes the launcher is set to download the full client so it's not "busy" while I'm playing. What about other settings like directx?
---
Thanks I'll do that.
---
angels are likely to have a vert titan... or atleast dread
---
Was part of a presentation at eve down under 
---
 Goes off members count but I don't think they had all the information my Corp at the time had more members but yet wasnt on the list
---
Ummmm
---
I don't know, from what I can remember the lag could occur anywhere, even when I was alone in system in a remote nullsec area.
---
What is cccp? And where I find it?
---
Not sure what you mean by "chat servers". Do you have more info on this?
---
&gt; One of the best proposals I’ve seen for fixing this is giving specific hunters a delayed local appearance, in which they can’t see local for the first x seconds they’re in system, but they also don’t appear in local for that time. 
---
The problem with this is it would push every hunter, from gankers like CODE to null hunters, to specific ships, and would kill diversity. 
---
A better solution imho would be to add a 'local update cycle' tied to the security rating of the system. In HS it would be immediate, in 0.4 system the local list would update maybe every 5s, in a 0.1 system every 10s (numbers subject to change). 
---
In NS you could have a 20s base update cycle, which would be enough to catch ratters and miners, going up to 30s or maybe more in the lower truesec systems, prefered by the ratters, so it would create an interesting risk vs reward mechanic. This also values powerful intel networks, which are built up by spreading people across multiple systems.
---
(Talking in local would still however reveals you on the local list, like in wormholes)
---
CCP is the company that makes eve online.
---
Follow this link:
---
 [https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/)
---
&gt; yeah but what tools? does CCP let you just interface with game files like that?
---
what ? yeah, CCP provides interfaces for the internal database. It's called ESI.
---
Some people also use your local data (eg from singularity) to rebuild those data and make a complete diff (see hoboleak)
---
Nah that’s just in wormholes XD
---
These are all good ideas. One moreI always suggest is ninja huffing gas in wormholes. Once you know what your doing it’s a pretty lucrative endeavor. The train time to start is only like 6 hours and then you can make way better isk than missions or combat sites. Only catch is the skillbook is a bit pricey for newbros at 24mill. But once you save up 24mill then it’s the thing to do for a while. I found this guide from brave:
---
https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/corps/spoopy-newbies/wh-life-guidebook/gas-huffing-guide
---
I'm no expert but I don't think directx would cause lag. I don't know what other options to consider. You say other games are fine so seems a little odd to me. Otherwise I'd be tempted to look at the network side of things. How is your connection. Did you try Network diagnostics from the launcher?
---
&gt; There has never been a candidate that could provide a completely balanced player view as far as one candidate advocating for all. 
---
Suitonia was probably pretty balanced. Just think of the capital application rebalance and the ramjag if you want an example of two things he probably had a lot of influence on that also favor wildly different playstyles.
---
Gonna take a while I only got 500k moneys but I'll try this later on, although I am kinda scared of wormholes so far
---
That resolution though.
---
That's kind of expected, there is more than a single system hosted on each server (with the exception of Jita) so if there is something going on elsewhere in your node, you'll be effected by the lag...
---
Do all of the tutorial and agent missions, they give you isk for completing the missions, skills and also quite a few free ships that you can sell
---
i'm going to be an asshole and answer the question literally watch this
---
1- get 200b isk  
---
2- find unresearched t2 bpo and buy it  
---
3- research it  
---
4- hope this was helpful send isk to CptnFancyPants or some other dumb character name in-game tyvm
---
Even if you cut the price to 1/2, I have no clue what niche it fills. It simply has no gameplay attached to it that would make it a worthwhile ship to want to buy. Am I wrong here?
---
I just tried the networks diagnostics tool. The results for "Basic" don't seem to show any particular problem but the "Traceroute" indicates many "request timed out" messages. I don't know what that means but it's probably not good. 
---
From this page: [https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213529545-Network-Diagnostic-Tool](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213529545-Network-Diagnostic-Tool)
---
***Traceroute***
---
*This test will perform a trace route to each of the URLs the launcher  and client connect with. This information can be used to identify  potential causes for delays and latencies within the game, and from  which they may originate. In case of complete connection failures, the  traces may also contain indicators for possible issues along the route  of the data between the client and the server.*
---
You will die, don't worry, one 15 minut ninja gas huffing will net you 7-45 Misk.
---
I recommend you train into a cruiser and grind missions till you can afford the skills, then you can explore, mine, or join some big corp and shoot people.
---
Why would you need more? 
---
It's nice to be able to fit scanning modules, sure. But with sufficient skills not that big of a deal, imo.
---
Nothing to be scared of whs for. Just smash V all the time. Its the shortcut for dscan. Shows you what is within 14 au of you.
---
Yeah I was told exploration is good for income, but I have yet to find anything but wormholes
---
Reddit posting interface is very shit tough

---
What is your Timezone?
---
Nullsec structures have huge bonuses and nullsec ore is 90% of jita cost. If you react the moongoo yourself you get an additional profit margin on top. If you sell your products in nullsec as well (because your alliance has a big population in one market stager to sell to), you save on export cost and compete with jita import prices.
---
Turns out Titans can still do damage to suicide dreads. Huh.
---
Dumb goon.
---
What for the time zone?;)
---
That feeling when you deploy the largest super fleet in the history of the game to burn down the long time enemies of your people and end up losing more titans in your largest super fleet in the history of the game ad only killing the 1 super and titan of a guy quitting eve. XD
---
ur the dumb idiot that died to a pve ship LOLL
---
10km if I recall correctly
---
I've heard 5km
---
I once had my face smashed in by a 220mm hurricane while roaming in an enyo, couldn't get under the guns at all. It's viable, if you know to pick your targets. U/eve_doulou (did I do the link right?) seems to know what he's talking about, you could do dual prop MWD+mjd and blap small things that come after you. If you put 1-2 nanos on, depending on your fits, you could have the option of running from other BCs and maybe some slower cruisers. Avoid faction, they're expensive and if you roam in null with them you'll get blobbed and killed.
---
I agree entirely when it comes to blops. The target selection in Null space is horrifically bad. What is actually out there in nullspace that you can shoot at?
---
- AFK VNI's that earn the hull back in 3 hours after a loss.
---
- 10/10 and 6/10 DED Runners who are essentially ungankable because you'll be decloaked to the gate and they can warp off to any of the 20 odd citadels in the system.
---
- Carriers who are permanently aligned to make them almost impossible to tackle without a camper and even when tackled, they just have to light a cyno to summon a ship with enough remote reps and tank to become immune to anything short of a massive fleet or a dreadbomb.
---
- Supers which are like carriers only that their inherent warp core strength means that tackling one requires either a pile of blops with heavy scrams or 'jump hics' and even if a cyno inhibitor goes up, they can still kill it with their long range fighters.
---
- Rorquals which have enough tank to ignore 40+ ships. However unlike Carriers you can atleast deal significant damage by attacking the drones.
---
I found Abyssals mildly entertaining until getting ganked by 5 tornados hahaha. That's Eve for you.
---
ECM got changed:   
---
You can now lock up the ship or drone that does ECM to you and try to make it explode.
---
why do you always say stuff like you actually know anything
---
i mean you should know the answer to that from excruciating personal experience
---
lmao keep digging
---
eve is hard
---
Go to wormholes, it's fun here.
---
You don't get dropped by caps when fly anything larger then frigate :D

Being new, you probably want to avoid wormholes until you get better skills and experience.  You can do exploration in high sec for ok isk.  Running missions is ok isk also once you get high enough for level 2 and up. Train your social skills if you do that. 
---
For mining, I want to say focus on plagioclase and pyroxerers (sp). Try and find a citadel with a compression array to make it easier to handle.  You'll also sell the ore better if you compress it first too.  Most of your buy orders are for compressed ore.
---
Stick with Inferno missiles, the bonus of the Gila-Hull is too good to sacrifice it for using Mjolnirs. 
---
But as others mentioned: You currently shoot with pretty big missiles at pretty small targets. If you use Rapid Light Missile Launchers istead of Heavies, you can work through the frigates and destroyers with that while your drones take care of cruisers and bigger.
---
Yeah, this is exactly what I was getting at with n degrees of seperate from the problem. OP is talking about the measures people are taking to catch targets, rather than selection of targets available and why that's the case.
---
Been farming something called azure plagioliocase recently due "high" price 50isk each. How does refining metals work?
---
Nope. Not at all.  BWHAHAHAHAHA!   
---
Like I said, I'm not looking just to use them. I was looking about info on how to actually make them from T1.
---
Wait, does that work? I thought the "estimated" Value of most Blueprints was pretty low?
---
But in Lowsec you can get smartbombed on gates. For small ships that's equally dangerous.

I honestly do think a price cut (say, to around 700m or so at today's prices) would see increased usage. Bastion, with its assorted x2 rep multiplier and ewar immunity bonuses, and the 1 minute MJD cooldown are solid enough to set Marauders apart from t1/pirate BS' at that price range. A scan res boost for the hulls/bastion would be nice as well (for all battleships actually ccpls).
---
People may order their overview after names in a TiDi-heavy fight where two fleets brawl each other and broadcasts may not get transportet reliably anymore or FC's got a disconnect, client crash or similar.  
---
He may tell the fleet to "order by name" and just go down the list. A pretty rare scenario though.
---
Where it may be more handy to have a name starting with "Z" might be when you actively hunt and come across a highly populated system where the list of people in local is longer than most peoples screen. They would need to have the list scrolled down to see you.
---
Largest super fleet is currently in the north. These random are hardly part of it

Well, there are relic and data sites in them for sure, don't go in any within spitting distance of a trade hub, like gas, one cheep exploration frig can net 30 Misk from a site easy, you will get ganked several times, don't bother with a tank at all, fit scanning and relic rigs, learn to use dscan, look up good exploration habits, ALWAYS BOOKMARK THE HOLE.

You can try ice mining but it will be kinda tedious without an orca. Then it doesnt help you learn anything. Or try the abyssal frigate size in a worm. You ll get like 45 to 50 mil an hour and they are somehow fun to do. The tier 1 and 2 should be doable with a lower sp character. Low sec faction for amarr has reached highest payout i believe i would look into that personaly as it scales well.

Ahh the follies of our youth.
---
I remember my first "big" fight.
---
We went against PL, Abaddon fleet + Guardians.
---
We just sat there waiting for them to come through the gate. All of the sudden a sphere of stealth bombers decloaked and we were rained upon by bombs.
---
Half of fleet gone, there.
---
Then the supers and titans landed.
---
It was a first time I saw a titan, I remember undocking with a Drake to take a picture, it shot me to half hull.
---
Luckily i docked right up, but took the picture.
---
Cyno inhibs are in such a horrible state.
---
They are pretty expensive.
---
They can´t be scooped, so every dropped one is a total write-off.
---
They are absolutely USELESS.
---
They absolutely need to online instantly in order to be able to perform their intended function.
---
If they were to keep their current price at least make them scoopable, or slash their price in half and keep them single use only.
---
You only lose standings to the corp owning the hauler. Not that big of a deal. 
---
But of course there's a response fleet to deal with, unless it's a t1 hauler, in which case you can just burn the hauler with high dps before they show up.
---
Yup. This is why you have A sitter alt or a pos..
---
Back then the game was just way more violent. You HAD to undock to protect your space. Now you can just stay docked, wait 48 hours for the real timer, and just jam entosis all day
---
You're looking for nano ships, I reckon. The omen navy issue is a good example: it does 2.8km/s and 250-500 dps depending on ammo and overheating. In a larger fleet, it fills the role of anti-tackle.

---
That is my T1 explo frig of choice, you have warped to the combat sites, thay will kill you, anything will kill you in a Imicus, you need to scan down the non-combat sites, check [This](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site) out, gas sites will spawn sleepers after about 20m after the first person warps to it, except "Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir" they have turrets that will pop your Venture.
---
The catches and ghost sites are diffrent and a whole other deal, look them up so you know what to do and if you want to try them.
---
Can someone suggest a guide or break down how to find the wrecks dscanning? Every time I try I warp to a sig with no wrecks and can't figure out where I've gone wrong.
---
It was one of those frequently returning questions he just got tired of answerring.
---
He's full of shit, so no, he doesn't.

It was always meant to be the end game for hisec mission runners.  It fills that role beautifully.  Sadly it could be so much more, but I doubt CCP will touch it because it's "working as intended."

---
I appreciate you too.
---
Nice story but one of your deductions is possibly wrong. Typical ratting layout for supers in angel space is 3x  Gungnir II  + 2x Einherji II. So he might have had it for a while.
---
It depends on the mission level actually. First, run the combat and advanced combat career agents. This will get you a fitted destroyer by the end. Used that destroyer to run L1 missions until you can run L2s. It shouldn't take long. While you are at it, head over to Arnon system and run the Sisters of Eve epic arc. Sister Alitura is the starting agent. Once done with that you should have enough ISK and Skills to fly cruisers. Don't fly them though until you can run L3 missions. These will be your bread and butter for quite some time.
---
All of this is assuming you are staying in high sec. If you want to try your hand in null sec, I recommend checking out KarmaFleet or Brave Newbies. They can get you sorted.
---
&gt;but it's in the middle of nowhere

Wait you need to take missions to go explore? I just go free mode? Well gonna try to do the boring tutorials. They might net some moneys but I have honestly no idea where I am located
---
*the closest +NPC Delta is 15 jumps away and when you get there he isn't even ratting.*
---
Aha, I see. Not a super, ratter, or carrier ratter, or even a ratter, myself.
---
other than the bugs, stupid grind, huge balance issues, and zero gameplay at end game ... maybe.
---
swg did a lot good, but it also did a hell of a lot bad at launch (or even soon after).  even simple things like speeders (mounts) weren't implemented till later.
---
Idiot.
---
Are we talking about nano-gangs or actually fleet doctrines ?
---
About gangs:
---
You could bring cheap long-range ships like Cormorants and try to volley or force their small stuff off grid. The rest will likely start running as well as they depend on each other to stay alive.
---
Do not let your tackle burn in straight away, they will just picked off - some guy will probably still do it... your smart tackle will put that guy on watchlist, warp to a celestial in line and then back to the burning guy at 100km. If the warp was not too long (the shorter the better) he will hopefully land very close to the kiters and land tackle.  
---
Your DPS and heavy tackle (scram + web would be nice) will need to be in warp-range and aligned and ready to take the warp to the smart tackler to gain anything from this situation as the kiters will immidiately primary him and very likely disengage when you warp the fleet. A good ship for doing this are of course Interceptors, but also Asault Frigates. The Jaguar is probably the best one at it as it's very fast and can take a punch or even active tank for a bit. Also use drugs to be faster and tankier. 
---
Long range E-War is also an annoying thing for kiting ships. A Keres sensor dampening their dps is very frustrating.
---
Kiters tend to engage at range on a gate to provoke people to burn into them. If you can, setup bookmarks around such gates towards celestials from the gate where a kiting gang might align to. You might be able to intercept them.   
---
If you talk about actual doctrines kiting your HD fleet, you probably got outplayed in the fitting window. See this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFOrheLbHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFOrheLbHc)
---
Its not worth training past 2 IMO.  Just stay 10km from the rock when mining and you'll never receive damage.
---
Try to clear cache in Launcher menu. Maybe works.
---
Not at all. Solo roamers need high DPS ships in order to finish off targets before their reinforcements arrive. Those reinforcements could be one jump out, or just 30km away from being able to warp to you. High dps is a must. The jaguar has abysmal DPS, but a very high speed and very strong tank. It thus favors not the solo or even small-gang playstyle but instead the fleet playstyle by offering a strong and easy to use (hence its name) counter to nano gangs with a low dps output or inexperienced screeners.

"retain the viability of subcap playstyles, non-krabbing playstyles, offensive and hunting playstyles, and any kind of PvP-seeking playstyles"
---
you can't have it all.  at the end of the day, the player base elects to follow a certain meta or ship or fit or playstyle.   attempting to balance everything is, well, impossible.   you can spend all the time you want trying, but as soon as someone finds out the quickest or easiest way, that is going to be the new playstyle.
---
We noticed a virgin Erebus doing Havens. It is against our ethics to kill a ship that doesnt have killmarks, therefore we fed some caps whos insurance ran out to make him feel better.
---
This used to be a thing back in 2006 but these days I don't believe they do drop them.
---
Cool, but impractical.

Fun so fun

Part of the issue is if you get even just a carrier or dread dropped on you you are very likely toast.
---
I joined a week-ish ago and am waiting for my app to a big newbie corp to go through. I've finished all the career agent missions except military, which I might get around to eventually. Still an alpha clone, but will probably get game time in a week or so. However, I have a lot of questions on random things that have popped into my head.
---
1. What capital to I need to start station trading?
---
2. How long is scanning supposed to take? For me it takes around 10 minutes just to get 100% on one signature... but I'm interested in making money off relics.
---
3. Is there any easy way to start processing/manufacturing as a newb? Or do I need to farm up high standings and/or farm blueprints?
---
4. What exactly are capital ships, supercapital ships, and titans?
---
Tell us the joke.
---
If you don't want out of fear it might get you banned, you know why people might have felt offended.
---
Or maybe it was just bad timing and you talked over an FC? I have been on super relaxed roams and super focused fleets were nobody but the command team has said a word until the end.
---
Nagl cool in WH

---
Do you have any idea how broken it would be if I put that 8.1bn monthly income into something other than titans? I could have eight dread alts and suicide eight dreads a month without SRP, every month. As could 500 other goons. The game would then be literally unplayable. Compared to now when we just show up once a year. But no matter we did with this industrial income it would be considered broken by those who can't be arsed to establish the type of nullsec entity that the citadels allow.
---
Grand Theft Hel
---
The problem with nullsec is that all braindead idiots on reddit tell every single newbean to join a big bloc and it stagnates the fuck out of this game.  Start mining in high sec then figure it out from there like everyone else did 5-10-15 years ago.
---

i thought chruker somehow decompiled the game to get the data, like they did in some other games, and that's why there aren't many alternatives (as chruker is very outdated now).
---
So you're saying ESI and the SDE can access NPC stats? I guess i'll have to learn to interface with them, thanks!

---
Yeah how do they do in wormholes, with no intel ! That's beyond reason. 
---
Nullsec is supposed to be dangerous too, and shouldn't be a place for risk-adverse people like you.
---
To quote my compatriot, Ingmar Stenmark: 
---
"I don't know anything about luck, but that the harder I train, the luckier I get."
---
React the moongoo as in just buy it in null, or do you mine it yourself? do you still have to use POSes to succ moon juices (i'm guessing you mean the "element" stuff like Tecnetium?) or do you use the refinery citadels now?
---
Guess I gotta rejoin a null block
---
/me facepalms
---
The SDE stands for Static Data Export, it's an export of the static data in the game.

The NPC stats are not present because reasons. *some* are available in the ESI (actually, a lot of them) , though not in a very understandable way.

Press F12 and a window should pop up that can lead you to the career agents of your characters faction.

You're suggesting we should be able to close gates in nullsec, so nobody can jump through them?

---
Seriously this.
---
I'd so much rather have a good group of buds I can just hop online to and internet space pixel with, without worrying about drama. 
---
I've got a group of about 9 buds I've hooked up with over the years after meeting them in various EVE scenarios who turned out to be real chill. 
---
I value the knowledge I've got a core group of dudes I can rely on to enjoy the game with, in all the facets it offers. And I wouldn't trade that for all the hangar queens, all the über rarest ships or all the purple mods in the game, because then it's not *fun* and *enjoyable* anymore. 
---
I could reroll if I stole *all the things* but all I'd ever get out of it is a *giant* pile of ISK. You'd have to liquidate all the rarest stuff because it's essentially a tracking beacon for you, and ISK can't buy actual *enjoyment*
---
So fuck that. Scam some shitters with contracts, double people's ISK in Jita all day long, docking rights trap dumbass haulers, whatever. But don't fuck friends.
---
Great answer.
---
Not the asker but would the 15 days of Omega time from Twitch Prime be enough (as I already have Twitch Prime) or still no?
---
&gt; However, Rorquals are fairly broken right now. Individually, especially after the umpteen yield nerfs, Rorquals aren’t really that bad. The issue stems more from the scalability of them. One human can multi box a shitload, sometimes double digits, of Rorquals, and still have less micro needs than someone super ratting. It is very important that Rorquals still have that lower-micro gameplay, but at the same time, the multiboxability needs to be cut down. 3-4 rorqs seems like a fairly feasible number to multibox. The other side of scaling is the number of rorqs that can be stuffed in a belt. Right now, it’s pretty easy to shove dozens of Rorquals into any given system, giving them safety in numbers. When Rorquals are spread out, it means you can bounce between a couple and fatigue the umbrella, a topic we’ll speak about in the PVP section. I struggled initially to come up with an elegant solution to this that would not have too much of an unintended effect on the rest of the game, however, at a town hall with Brand Newbros, someone mentioned just making the rocks bigger. So you’d essentially combine the rocks, so that any individual rock has more content, but there are fewer rocks in the belt.
---
You have my vote. I think the scalability of rorquals is the biggest issue in Eve right now next to dying lowsec.

What would you propose as counter to intel provided by cloaked eyes?
---
I was thinking about something like the Arty Munnin kitey doctrine. They go 2km/s and shoot out anywhere from 50-100km.
---
So the goal would be to create bookmarks around the battlefield and hope you can get one close enough to warp on top of them and get under their guns?
---
&gt;Capital scanning rigs.
---
Wait. What?
---
NC doesn't know our objective and is camping the wrong system... FC, wat du?
---
I just buy it in null (delve to be precise). There's a new structure to "frack" moons now, they spawn an ore belt (that you mine with rorquals most likely) every 60 days or so (you can set it to frack more often with smaller rocks). Some moons now have equivalent of two R64 moons worth of goo (plus some other good versions of normal ore). 
---
You can react tons of stuff in one citadel, but as you install new jobs you increase the reaction system tax (a mechanic CCP introduced to prevent people doing all the industry and reactions in just one system).

Or spies. Or wormholes. Are you even aware about the NSA nerf?

NC.: "We  didn't want those citadels anyway"
---
just discovered this one yesterday:
---
farming Rogue Cloning Facilities in 1.0 systems. each rat pays 2000 isk pero bounty and drop Ectoplasm which can be sold later at an NPC station. the number of rats replenishes shortly after being killed so technically you have an endless source of isk. 
---
of course this is an activity on a starting system so it was probably put there so newbies could get enough isk for skillbooks or for fitting their corvettes with civilian modules (the rats drome several of them including Civilian Blasters, Damages Controls and Cargo Expanders, they also drop the BPCs). still farming these rats for a while and collecting ectoplasm for sale produces a good amount of income comparable to just ratting and should earn enough to jump on a Frigate if you dont want to do the Career Agents (specially if you want to earn money while keeping your standings neutral with all the factions)
---
Are you upset?
---
If you wanna use guns go for it. Just because they aren't quite as good doesnt mean they arent good at all.
---
Brutix isn't bad, and ive even used a Talos to do some ratting, thats not worth it at 2 mill SP though.

Then omega your account, train the remaining skills you need (ideally if you can have a skill injector, I'm not sure 15 days is enough). Then grind them. At 100m ISK/hr, it'll take you 20 hours to PLEX.
---
Spies = awox. NSA nerf is irrelevant because any semi-intelligent person fits sebos instead. Wormholes are irrelevant too because the carrier is aligned while ratting and warps to safety before anything can get remotely close to it.
---
It's very obvious you are on the receiving end of these things and not the giving end, because you are unaware of how skewed the system is in favour of players such as yourself to protect you from your own inexperience and ignorance.
---
Like I said back then, I didn’t want to do it but PL was threatening to kill it if I didn’t follow with the agreement and had to comply. If I had it my way, I wouldn’t block anyone from anything.
---
in medival terms. poisen the well´s, shoot plague corpses over the wall,  set  poisenes trees on fire, shell them with fragmental and burning  ammo.
---
I love the million shades of blue smoothbrains think goons and test are
---
Good thing you didn't want the P3EN ihub anyway.
---
Vertical axis is amount of veldspar money on high sec using a venture
---
Than that will to live line is not nearly steep enough
---
Because you've seen a lot of ratting carriers using sebos? Come on mate, stop your Bs.
---
And no, smart spies don't get caught easily.
---
I'm talking about blue carriers getting spotted by spies and log off traps nearby logs in, and burn too quick before NSA is off.
---
That seems really grindy though... basically, to maintain the PLEX, I'll need to spend 20 hours a month on grinding incursions. I don't play that much, so that's slightly over half of my playing time. The rest will probably be spent on me enjoying myself or something like that, so I won't really have much money to save up as capital to use in station trading (my long-term goal with this game)...
---
I think I'll stick with paying real money.
---
Do you know of a good curve of earnings per capital with station trading? i.e a graph with the x-axis being current capital and the y-axis being ISK/hour?
---
Just to make it clear: 
---
Imicus is for scanning &amp; hacking the best t1 ship when you have skill for Gallente.
---
Venture is the starter ship for any kind of mining activity - gas harvesting included.
---
Like half of them early access mmos

yea sure, an ishtar instead of a vni because the myrmidon isn't a thing and everyone has the same disease you have

amazing pve gameplay thank you
---
It's not true at all. The empire canonically have fleets millions of not billions strong. Where capsules struggle to get a few thousand. Empire titans are also literally 4x the size of ours if not bigger and stronger. They also have more of them you just dont see them because the empires are busy duling it out with each other to care about the flying that are capsuleers.
---
Every person with a brain runs sebos or nothing at all. If you are using an NSA, you are a fucking brainlet. Even if you were, it wouldn't matter because you fit a cyno instead and improve your ratting ticks by cashing in on pvp spawns.
---
As I said, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about because you spend your time ratting in your carrier and press F1 when FC tells you to. Don't worry, though, 98% of the game is just like you and you can take some comfort in knowing that.
---
;₽)
---
Nice, long fight :)
---
you fit "ice miner" modules on your ship and find an ice anomaly (they show up in your probe scanner window). you may be able to filter for them in the agency window (not sure if the recent update really shows them) or you find them on dotaln: [http://evemaps.dotlan.net](http://evemaps.dotlan.net) just enter the name you are in in the search window and look if there are any systems marked with a blue circle, that's where an ice belt is or was recently if it is not mined out yet.
---
well i dont know why the estimated value of them come in to play, you do this just to get a realy long and funny kill mail that takes a long time to scrool down
---
And you still talk shit without knowing... :) 
---
All carriers ratting are NSA fitted.
---
Only huge power blocs don't care and cyno each time they are in troubles. Others die quietly.
---
I'm not in fleet, I'm mostly part of the dictor catching supers when we hunt. But why even talking to you, you supreme leader and most acknowledgeable person in new Eden...
---
Yeah, if you can pay for it, it's always better to do so rather to grind. If you have the money, you could even give you a budget of PLEX a month to sell and use that to finance your pvp needs. (ex: 20$ a month for 500 PLEX budget), it lets you just enjoy the game without having to grind for ISK. Depends what you want to do though, you won't finance a Titan doing that, but if you fly cheaper ships, you can whelp a lot with 2 billion ISK.
---
I've never done trading so I can't really help you. Station trading ISK making is usually measured in ISK/days though, not ISK/hr, since the income is essentially passive and pretty slow. To PLEX an account with station trading though, you'd need a pretty big bank already.
---
&gt; you force the AFK rock spinners to move to the Ishtar and Dominix which involve putting significantly more ISK in space.
---
AFK people will die regardless, it only gives you a little more to pad your zkill with if they're in more expensive ships lol. Perhaps more will actually pay attention to when they're ratting which means you'll catch less than before.
---
&gt; This will force DED runners to actually pay attention to local instead of just casually krabbing away regardless of how many hostiles are nearby.
---
Enjoy the guy with the combat probes making his way through the DED site. Bonus points if in a recon that's not detected on dscan. Seen it happen a lot of times. Even without the help of a ship that hides from dscans.
---
&gt; Carriers, Super carriers and Titans should not be able to fit cynos. This would create some actual risk for capital ratting
---
If you're in a carrier you'll just be aligned out anyways VoV
---
Unfortunately, I have a word limit in that people are unlikely to fully read longer posts. This post is 3k words as it is, so it has to stop somewhere. Part of the reason I try to crank out a bunch of these posts is to give me the opportunity to look deeper into individual things once the broad concepts are handled.
---
Case in point, saying I go right to the cloak camping issue. It appears you overlooked the section immediately before, which goes over why cloaky camping has become so prominent, I.e. it’s very difficult to find targets. You have essentially restated my words in your comment here.
---
If you talk to anyone who does small gang, they’ll tell you these JBs are dramatically different. They’re located on keepstars quite often, and allow you to jump while tackled. The latter is particularly key. Before Ansiblex jump gates were implemented, you could tackle someone on a jump bridge, and they’d be stuck, as it functioned as if you were using a jump drive. Now, people can jump through with impunity, and you can do nothing to follow because of the ACLs. This is a pretty significant issue for roaming gangs trying to hunt down targets in a world which, as you say, is already lacking in targets. Part of the reason I’ve done so many town halls is to identify cases like this where game mechanics have been overlooked by CCP.
---
Goon pets everywhere
---
Sure, you can run a myrmidon. I don't think it's going to be the popular choice however since the lack of drone bandwidth and lack of drone application means the ticks will be trash.
---
Because EVE MOGUL is directly associated with PANFAM. No matter how much they proclaim neutrality... EVE MOGUL is not.
---
Darkness are literally puppets at this point tbh
---
For the hunters the change in targets was huge over a short amount of time when CCP did the rebalances. And I think mostly not in a good way. 
---
From the very bottom where Pi haulers became WCS central. Ratting ships became much harder to catch as BCs and BSs were replaced with Ishtars and VNIs which do not care about traversal and range. Mining barges ceased existing, same with Orcas. Bombing mining fleets or isolating and catching slow individuals in the herd was good content for smaller groups. Completely gone now.
---
Even carriers in many regions of space used to sit still on top of their sentry drones, so you had a chance to catch them.
---
DPS also became much more important for hunters because carriers and Rorqs spot a stronger local tank and often are harder/impossible to neut out. Combined with their vastly improved ability to kill attackers you have to bring a specific fleet setup with all roles filled. Which also means responsefleets can´t just be quickly available kitchensinks that can make fun fights for both sides but hard counters.
---
Just to add my own comment: Most people with any experience don't care about cloaky camping per se, they care about the cyno attached to it. The main attackers can sometimes be tethered up an entire region away while stealth bombers of rapiers perma-camp high ADM systems, and that is very much a threat.
---
Cloaky campers in system, people dock up because they know that once the cyno has gone up next to them, they're already dead.
---
More docked up, less in space, so IMO cloaky camping itself is contributing to a decline in active hunting.
---
Well I haven’t stolen anything because you know I’m a great stand up citizen of new eden, but eve straight up lifted my life right out from me though ha.
---
You are in PL yet you keep talking about PL in the 3rd person.
---
Let’s try again, shall we?
---
“The leadership of my own alliance threatened to blow my structures up unless I blocked certain alliances from my “Freeport” structures.”
---
Now sit back and think hard about that statement and then tell me again with a straight face that you’re an innocent neutral third party.
---
You can’t have it both ways.
---
You shall fight. I shall merely sit back and start fires that all you players can warm your toes by / shove each other into.

With so many keepstars in TAPILAND why would you ever just leave your super in dead space?!  Hubris in these moronic groups are the best thing ever!
---
Someone is mad.

When i had to bookmark escalation I just used KS or my alt that fly super, I would nerver let my super unguarded, guess he learned the lesson
---
Lighting cynos in DED sites is a garbage idea. How bad are you if you cant kill a ratter without dropping shit?
---
People willingly bait in DED sites BECAUSE they cant get dropped by bads.
---
Nerfing the VNI wont change much, people will simply move to other ships.
---
Change the anoms so they cant be AFK farmed. 
---
Also, remove drone autoaggro, that would solve a lot of issue.
---
One should keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to hand over one's sensitive API credentials to them. All aligned server-side applications carry significant risk of misappropriation of your API data.
---
Due to some major political and balancing changes the game reached a point when every braindead newbean could quickly figure out how joining a null bloc was the easiest, quickest, most lucrative way to play. Also with the fewest downtimes and a clear upgrade path.
---
There exist plenty of ways to land initial tackle on an aligned carrier. However there exists almost no way to deal with that carrier instantly lightning his cyno and a fax coming through. Or let's phrase things in a more constructive way.
---
Do you see any way the proposed changes would make the eco system of null any worse then it is today?
---
mannn all the good vibes you put out are coming back !
---
I wouldnt give them that much credit
---
That's quite coincidental. I was paraphrasing a South-African golfer, Gary Player "The harder you work, the luckier you get"
---
TLDR goons don't give a fuck about their members. loves to exploit them but in their time of need, you're not willing to help them. If you're still losing titans, you should probably educate your dumbos or remove them from your space. Wait, that would mean you can't exploit them anymore, they will just buy another titan/super and make someone in the coalition richer, okay nvm that was just super not part our fleet. Lets go with that.
---
If you do something like delayed local, you’ll just drive away possible content for yourself. Sure, you may catch a few idiots, but people will switch to abyssal/other safe PvE. Then we’ll get a post like “wahhh where’d all my nullsec targets go”.
---
My point was that if you remove asset safety, THIS becomes the situation. Citadels become useless.
---
Isk  and after this one I'm not sure I will do another. It takes a lot of time and I'm doing this on top of eve and irl stuff so it was tough to make space for it. I would need substantial compensation for my time in the future.
---
Yes, which is why I always bring this up when people bring up removing asset safety. If you remove asset safety, might as well remove citadels (which, granted, there are good arguments for)
---
Again, then I found the problem why your carriers are dying and you should thank me. NSA fitted and unable to defend the carrier if it gets caught? DON'T FIT NSA. 400 IQ solution.
---
Oh sonofabitch take your upvote
---
They are so mad as fuck, they turned their blue donut into a massive green pasture for whalers to feast upon the helpless cattle.
---
Client initially referenced Eastern bloc propoganda. Good eye.
---
Thanks Dad
---
How would you propose to help illiterate krabs Who dont want to be helped?
---
If they cant figure out one simple thing, why would they be of any value to the alliance?
---
The problem I have with the VNI from the perspective of a hunter is that the ship is barely worth the ammo you used to shoot at it. Even with non-ideal skills it pays for itself in 3 hours, that means even if you kill the same ratter once a day every day he's probably still isk positive. The entire concept of AFK/Pseudo AFK isk making is something I don't like but I think that if you're going to have low effort scaleable isk making it should at least require you to put some money on the table and take a real loss if someone shoots at you.
---
I've never even heard of anyone using DED sites to bait in nullsec, why would you? No hostiles even bother trying to enter them these days because you know the guy is just going to warp to a citadel.
---
What kind of ticks does a dread get then?
---
Exactly, if they can be 'forced' to remove groups from ACL access. What else could they be 'forced' to give away? (hint: it's all your information).
---
MOST alliances that give a fuck about their people would simply remove them. Goons and friends won't because you just want to exploit them and have more pawns for your blue donut. What did you expect when you recruit high-sec care bears into your coalition?
---
I mean that’s what happened. It’s weird to wrap ones head around I know.
---
And that's why your losing idiot
---
You say you will focus on changes that make the ecosystem more healthy, but every single point you suggested would drive people away from ratting. Congrats.
---

was in a care-bear/renter wh corp. Went to jita to buy my ships, asked if they want anything since im going. Cue the ridiculously long and bulky order for expensive shit like 3 strasios cruisers, t2 fit, augmented drones... more than 1.5 bil isk sent to my wallet with this shopping list. I just lold, deleted my api key and biomassed.
---
lols were had as the character was less than 3mil sp
---
You do realise how much people get in return for little to no activity requirements?
---
&gt;What did you expect when you recruit high-sec care bears into your coalition?

Finally, a good idea on this sub

I don't feel so good about being caldari any more, at least they have cool ships
---
One of the biggest highest that I am aware of happened a few months ago when Adversity joined Snuffed Out and Joe stole my heart.
---
You know us, we are simple people. We work hard, kill stuff and loot it all. Too bad I can't fly a Hel, would have been nice to try it, just this once, so I could tell my grand-clones about it.
---
What does it do?
---
Joke aside, is there 5000 titans in game?
---
YES. Specialize in one ship (frigate) and go from there.  Hop corporations until you find one you jive with.  You make your own fun, so don't get stuck doing something that makes you bored.
---
Oh, so it's about alliance/coalition level fleets. That's something completly different than small gang pvp...
---
Well, "getting under the guns" of a fleet that goes 2km/s may work for one cycle of their artillery. If you can not burn with the same speed in the same direction instantly after warping in, you will not be able to keep that advantage up long that it would matter. Maybe this could work with Aussault Frigates...   
---
But the Muninns will probably just outrun you with their initial momentum and can swap to close range ammunition as well.
---
You could try to web/scram the Muninns anchor to slow the whole fleet down - the one webbing usually will be called primary quite fast. If you want to hold a grid against Muninns, Eagles might be worth a look at. They usually can outrange them at maybe 20-30km depending on the fit. If you kill the Info-Links of the Muninns, this advantage increases as the Muninns won't be able to lock that far.   
---
Of course they still go 2km/s but you have forced them in closer on your (likely AB fitted) Eagles where you can hit them with harder hitting ammo. 
---
A fight between two fleets of HACs is partly down to the single fleet members. If a HAC dies or not depends greatly if he finds the button for his ADC in time or not. The hitpoints most heavy assault cruisers have provide not enough time for logistics to repair them, so ADC is really the key element here. 
---
Another option to slow Muninns down are Void Bombs. They will be hard to place because of the fleets speed, but some good bombers can neut out a whole fleet for some moments. If you have DPS in range during that, you should be able to kill some.
---
I was flying with Muninn fleets where the opponents brought Harpies to burn straight in for a scramble on us. They got wrecked and their dps-fleet still could not reach us while we kept burning away. 
---
It's a hard task to get kills on Muninns. You may have an objective you can use to force them close to you so you can shoot them effectively. Or you bing something that has enough buffer to be able to survive the initial volley of a Muninn fleet. That would be battleship-sized probably. Muninns have high alpha, but not high dps. So you get damage spikes and pauses - in theory. 
---
This said I would add that I'm no FC, just a line member in a coalition that happens to use Muninns themself and also fights them.
---
I'm not involved in this conflict, I'm not sure how I'm losing anything.   If anyone is losing, its CCP, because the average eve player is becoming a spod brain.

If you can sleep well knowing a game got the better out of you then Eve is not for you
---
At what cost? Now when you deploy no one wants to fight your super blob, not everyone wants to be a high-sec care bear. Most of the eve players I've met and fought just want to have fun and pvp. Not all of us want a massive blue donut that will prohibit any decent fights. Kudos to goons for being able to become strong, but it must be really shitty to know that you recruited dumbos to exploit them.

Now you will be using your super fleet to structure bash til the end of tranquility, congrats.

If Station Trading is passive, would it pay for itself enough to use alts for it?
---
Around what 'big bank'? What money would I need?
---
1. Really depends on what you expect to earn. You need a lot of knowledge of eve mechanics to make a good fortune. But if you want to start take some hundred mil spare and keep good track of your trades so you really make some profits. And not lose money in the end due to taxes and such
---
2. Depends on your skill, ship and equipment. But reasonably skilled (ingame and in person) it should not take longer than 1min to scan a site.
---
3. In low tech manufacturing competition is quite hard so you need good efficiencie bp and skills. You can try to acquire your raws through salvaging and scanning. Just do the calculations if you wont earn more if you sell your mats directly.
---
4. Never flew one but beside null carrier ratting they are not used solo. You don't have to worry about them for the next year or so, but if you want more detail someone else is bete to answer that.
---
5. First there is rarely the best ship for something in eve. For defence its about what you want to do. Just travel? Interceptors are great. Something else, a ship that is good for your job + good awareness of your surroundings is gold, in null or low have an eye on local, who is there and what does their killboard looks like for example. In wh space hammer that d scan button, anything shows up (especially combat probes) and you better be on your way.

I am with you on the AFK issue. Not sure about slamming the VNI, but removing drone autoaggro would mean a lot less AFK non bot ratting. It would also actually hurt stabbed VNIs which are impossible to tackle.

Local needs to be nerfed, but the anoms also need not to be so excrutiatingly boring.

Pandemic, made up of legion for "elites" and horde, everyone else. currently turning into space goo by Imperium and allies forces
---
Test, Reddit people. fun group to talk too.  
---
I cannot speak for the rest. for news try https://imperium.news/ http://evenews24.com/

Tbf none of them are "good" Gall are definitely the most "good".
---
Minmatar are kinda redeemable as theyve got an excuse of them being enslaved etc but they still do horrible shit.
---
But sorry, Caldari and Amarr are completely irredeemable.
---
Not to mention the **SUPER IMPORTANT** Legacy vs Fraternity war in the South :-P
---
&gt; Three weeks before we stole the Hel he lost an Einherji II
---
Regular fighters are used for anti Subcap on Supers, and three LRs and two fighters are the standard load for ratters
---
Good thing you brought 2 extra fleets when you realized 2x the numbers weren't enough ;-) 
---
Gf tho, was fun
---
I assume this post made by some mad northern lad
---
imagine feeling good about yourself when you are part of a 1200 super/titan fleet and structure bashing for eternity, lmbo
---
We went up North without Supers and every fight was PANFAM dropping Supers. Never again. Fuck you.
---
I would love to see a complete re-design of how ratting works from the ground up to make it into a worthwhile active activity more alike the abyssal deadspace then the current state of things. However if you took the game as it is right now and just removed drone aggro and put in local delay, you'd end up with basically nothing besides carriers still ratting since it's just not worth the time(or damage to your mental health) to do active subcap ratting.
---

wormholes are incredibly safe as you can't cyno your friends in to kill things.  The problem with null right now is that both hunters and prey can escalate infinitely.

Yeah we exploit them so bad we offer hilariously good srp for little to no activity requirement.
---
I can think of at least one Titan pilot who'll give a fuck at this point.
---
Yes, the NPC Haulers do indeed drop the Harvester mining drones BPCs, and said drones are extremely cheap to build, on top of being sold for ridiculous amounts of ISk(350M isk last time I checked)!
---
The catch is:
---
LOOT BOXES!
---
The NPC Hauler endeavor is a major RNG fest! You do not have 100% chance to have a loot box dropping per NPC Hauler killed! You will mostly and consistently only find inside said loot boxes 1x skin for t1 or t2 mining frigates, with the occasional barge, unusual Exhumer, rare orca and legendary Rorqual skins! 
---
And this goes without the not so consistent time between you shoting at the hauler and a response fleet of BATTLESHIPs warping on top of you! Also the fuckers warp Scran you!(granted that a properly prepared piloted will easily be able to avoid the response fleet)
---
I started my NPC Hauler (miss)adventures because I was honestly looking to try doing something new, and I also genuinely wanted those skill(That Galente Orca looks great). 
---
I also happens to be a 90M+ skill point guy with a very unhealthy taste for the mining arts!
---
I did grab a few of those rare BPCs, and they were a great injection of isk, but in no way, shape, or form I would recommend someone to jump on this because he/she/it thinks that it will be a profitable endeavor!!!
---
First, the skins aren't worth much, and those that are won't drop with any kind of consistency(The moment you get one of those drone BPCs you might as well raise your hands up and call yourself the chosen one!)!
---
However, if you do like the ships design in EVE, is looking for some nice mining ship skins, and would like to learn a fuck ton about how directional scan works without moving to WHs, you might enjoy jumping into the hunt of NPC Haulers!
---
If you want to do this moved by the illusion that you will be made rich by it, FORGET IT!
---
Do it for the skins or the fun, don't consider anything else, and whatever comes is PROFIT!
---
Anyway, if you have more questions about it, I might be able to answer some o7

I’m not saying I’m the wormhole candidate, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to talk about them. If you’re on the CSM, you should be able to have a base knowledge of the issues of all areas of the game, not just one specific niche. Part of the reason wormholes get screwed over so much is that they pretty much never get talked about, so when CCP breaks something, it doesn’t get fixed in anywhere near a timely manner if at all. You don’t need to be the wormhole candidate to see that as an issue. Everyone benefits from the different areas of the game being healthy, and wormholes are no exception.

Sure, but the point was always that it was dangerous to leave a hostile keepstar in range of your stuff. Now we have a Titan wreck to serve as proof of that lol
---
Well i just looked it up and they changed the anathema since i last looked at it. Last time i looked it had 3h/3m/4l it has 3h/4m/3l so it's not so bad. That makes it still only as bad as the cheetah and buzzard. Still lacking compared to the helios but not invalid as i considered it before.
---
Well, essentially passive. If we're talking station trading, you put up a buy order, and once you get some stock, you sell the item back at sell prices instead. Besides those 2 things, you don't really have anything to do. You will need to log in a few times a day to change the price of what you're selling because the goal is to stay higher up in the price listing, those items get sold first.
---
You need a couple of things to do station trading and a lot of people don't do it because they're missing one of those:
---
1. A good amount of ISK. To PLEX an account using station trading, you need capitals in the tens of billions of ISK (not 100% sure, but it's in that range, someone with more knowledge can correct me). You can certainly make some money with less ISK, but it's an amount not everyone has access to.
---
2. Market research. You need to play Excel Online for a while to find the best margins on buy/sell prices. Not only the best margins, but also the markets where there isn't a lot of competition and also a good volume so that it doesn't take years for you to liquidate your stock.
---
3. Patience. You need a lot of patience to log in multiple times a day and updating your market orders. You can very easily burn out on doing this. Station trading is not easier to do than ratting or mining in that regards.
---
Those are the essentials of station trading. Most people don't do it mostly because of #3. There's a lot more to it, but that's most of what I know about it. There are other kinds of trading that are a bit more involved (hauling from trade hubs, supplying mission or pvp hubs with common items), but that's about it.
---
The problems with null, small gang, the economy etc, is because cynos are broken.  All the problems that you list are the result of the way thay cynos operate.  They allow for the umbrella, they allow for cloaky camping, they allow for logistics, they allow for rapid deployment anywhere at a drop of a hat, they allow for huge empires, they allow for bots (ok shit, they don't allow for bots, that is a unfixable).
---
If you somehow fix cynos, the games goes back to being open and dangerous, but not oppressive.  that said, i have no idea how to fix cynos.  plenty of ideas have been thrown out, but they are all have drawbacks.
---
Congrats bro, that looks sweet
---
I've seen people leaving carriers on small citadels to run escalations
---
I do, then jump in with my alt and log him off. Can't always dock it
---
Yes and got fun
---
I run 6 cloaky campers. Some people use awox alts or logoff traps.
---
Who in their right mind SRPs retarded losses?
---
This is THE site to use
---
You should remember that bots don't care about quality of life.
---
Yeah, but if you’re not an idiot you’ll never be scammed. Often that means only trusting yourself, but it works. Since it’s an internet game, it’s so easy to just scam someone then never interact with them again.
---
&gt; Do you see any way the proposed changes would make the eco system of null any worse then it is today?
---
Driving real people out of null makes more room for bots.
---
Now this comes from someone that has dodged both an awoxer (unknown / not burnt at the time) and a logoff trap in a carrier. Pretty damn hard if you're already aligned, etc. and aware.
---
Link your fit please. 
---
We all know it's a pimp fit, just go ahead
---
Or they could have used one of million other forts (for docking) or astras for safe logging...
---
Didn't know that, that's not cool
---
&gt;The AFK VNI needs to be destroyed. If you nerf the drone bandwith and give it guns like the Vexor, you force the AFK rock spinners to move to the Ishtar and Dominix which involve putting significantly more ISK in space.
---
or you could just remove drones aggressive setting - that's literally the only reason you can go afk with drone boats. instead of trying to adjust drone bandwith and make the ship useless.
---
buying? here I am thinking you're selling a shitpost
---
I might just be dumb, but I don't understand what the point you're trying to make is.
---
Exploration is a fun way to make decent isk.  Fit up a tech 1 exploration frig(every race has one).  Practice a bit scanning and hacking relic and data sites in high sec.  Once you feel comfortable with the basic mechanics; fly out to null sec for much more valuable sites.  There are plenty of videos on youtube that offer guidance on how to "safely" navigate through null and some little tricks to help you be more efficient at hacking.
---
&gt;Rorquals are obviously the elephant in the room here.
---
No, that would be injectors and bots. If you want to run for CSM and accomplish nothing like all CSMs before you, I think its reasonable that you are aware of the root causes.
---
So once you remove the afk drone boats from space, what's left to shoot at? I want more worthwhile things to shoot, not less.
---
I’d recommend reading my separate post dedicated solely to botting: https://www.voteforcornak.com/latest-news/2019/5/7/why-harboring-bots-is-a-big-deal

afk ratting drone boats aren't worth while things to shoot at anyway.
---
so who gives a fuck if they vanish from space or not?
---
You're dense as fuck so I will just end it with this. Imperium recruits high-sec care bears to exploit them. You're average line member is starting to become a spod brain, but that is okay because it's all part of the plan. You want to foster spod brains because they are easy to placate. lets not forget the easy dank frags can potentially be had.
---
You know that when you deploy, you will just ridicule you're own line members, and know that they will krab because that's all they know how to do. They are so used to being able to just light cyno and win. You will even flaunt that publicly and literally say "Didn't want that ship anyway." while saying that someone else will become richer at their demise. Tell me how you're not exploiting anybody? Most groups are not innocent of this, but holy fuck, you guys do it so openly. Why people would join you for any reason other than to propagate the massive blue donut is beyond me. 
---
TLDR, Imperium is where all the high-sec care bears go to, the leadership will throw pennies at them to make them feel good, and the smart ones in turn, will receive all the benefits. Imperium does not give a fuck about educating their members, they don't care about the line members. They are just bodies in the field to soak up and tank anything. the only decent line members are those that join sigs, because they want a purpose. Good job to goons for being able to convince all your care bears that they are "safe" and that you will always have their back, knowing that they will not be able to follow basic orders and tell them to find somewhere else that can offer them delve protection. Most of your spod brains have no spine in being able to fend for themselves.

eve mogul supposedly isn't PL, half the comment you replied to is saying that, shouldn't be hard to read.that's like saying tis is NC. cause materall is there lmao

they were shot for the same reason any non imperium aligned structure in the surrounding area was shot, because goons are there and have nothing else to do.
---
ps:and maybe eve mogul is pl, fuck if I know, but saying he's in PL and therefore it was a targeted attack that would happen regardless of the wz is retarded, might as well just write no u
---
I thought the prevailing theory from panfamville was that test and legacy are also imperium pets... So did you just forget to add them or did your side get the narrative mixed up again?
---
I've gotten one. I've also gotten a meta mining upgrade module directly from one of the miner wrecks (people say the only worthwhile loot comes from the hauler well they're wrong.)
---
The big money maker about killing npc miners is when you find T2 haulers and barges which drop proper T2 salvage when you kill them. 
---
Easiest way to kill them is to get an alt or friend to fly a ultra fast frigate like a interceptor or executioner or atron with mwd. As soon as the hauler shows up the fast ship agresses the hauler and then starts burning away from the belt at top speed. The mining fleet will land and you just burn away from them at high speeds and the miners warp off. As long as the alt stays on grid with the response fleet they will never leave!
---
Then you grab your favorite T3D and combat probe the miners/hauler, gank them all and if you find T2 barges/hauler salvage them. In some super low security sov null systems they can get bugged and be filled with multiple full belts worth of ore. So if you pop a hauler with 200mil+ in ore in it it might be worthwhile to try and get it out depending on how close you live to the area.
---
The 2nd method the solo only differs mostly in how you deal with the defense fleet. Aggro the hauler in your T3D and warp away. Probe down the whole fleet and make a bookmark as you warp in at 100 you want to be 10kkm or further away from the defense fleet then just burn away MWD on for however many minutes you think it will take you to gank the mining fleet. The defense fleet can burn 100s of km off the miners who won't move at all. Then you can gank the miners and they won't warp to you again just slowboat back towards you.
---
you spin me right round baby right round~

Why? I already know its a massive problem thats basically ignored by CCP. Same for injectors. If these things are not addressed soon, the game will keep dying.

Does anyone else see the problem with OP comparing Steam not helping recover goods scammed during a transaction that violates the EULA to CCP doing account recovery?  
---
If CCP didnt help with account recovery chances are that account will never pay a subscription again, aka financial incentives to get it done.  If you get scammed on a CSGO skin trade, it's not like you'll abandon the Steam platform and the rest of your current library.  
---
Just wanted to add that IMO CCP has a lot of redemption to do after that miserable fuckup of an anniversary event.  Nothing more than a bullshit way to manipulate KPIs for investors right before the end of quarter.  Seriously, fuck management that only cares about quarterly earnings because they plan on moving up and out of their positions and leaving a flaming bag of shit for their replacements.

I can only speak of my experience and of the people I know. I have a really good PC, really good internet connection. I have everything tweaked the way I like. I run 3 clients among other things and it runs great. I know for a fact that poorly setup PC's and networks, or over utilized PC's and networks will cause you all kinds of problems. And if troubleshooting those are what I would look at first.  Could CCP servers have issues? For sure, but I would focus on the local side.
---
&gt; I want people to take a risk proportional to the isk they're making.
---
no you don't - you just said you don't in the previous sentence.
---
Bot proliferation is unfortunately due to CCP´s reluctance to deal with them and can´t really be combatted by players on the large scale.
---
For station trading, I was more thinking market speculation/manipulation kinda thing - for example, when I played WoW, I made some good money off buying a ton of frostweave cloth and selling it later when the prices went up because I was fairly sure the prices would be going upwards soon from looking at trends. Is there anything like that?
---
For what you said, I understand the first two points, but the third one is somewhat confusing. Wouldn't that make it not really that passive? If you are actively changing prices to earn money, in most competitive markets your ISK would be measured by how much active time you spent logging in, correct? Also, why would it burn you out? Couldn't you just do that between other activities? And wouldn't there also be a lot of what I asked in my first paragraph to spice it up?
---
BTW thanks a ton for answering all my questions.
---
1. Idk what I expect to earn. What I was wondering if there were estimates like: 100mill capital = 10mil/day, 1b capital= 30mil/day, and so on.
---
2. Right now I have a core probe launcher and 8 core scanner probes or whatever they're called
---
3. I was actually thinking of buying materials and selling the items, not mining myself
---
4. I was just curious, I guess I'll look it up or wait for someone else
---
5. For 5.6 I was thinking of something that I could use to haul small amounts of cargo and talk to agents with, or just to chill in.
---
6. What is the best way to build up capital for a newb who plans to join a big newb corp (Karmafleet or Brave Newbies)? Incursions? Mining? What else? I prefer mining/industry/station trading/hauling but am open to other things.
---
Making it worse isn't a good idea.
---
Hopefully this time it doesn't die in a keepstar bash
---
ur sov = dead
---
I once told the chipotle cashier that i got a steak bowl.  
---
It was actually double steak.
---
Imo the issue with getting a battlecruiser at your current point is they cost quite a bit to fit rather than the ship itself being the full cost. Every t1 bc I've fit came out to around 80-90m, like twice the cost of the ship hull, even though I'm a very cheap/stingy player. While good cruiser fits for a 10m hull usually come out to around 30m-40m average, for pvp at least.
---
you could just skip the actual playing and go straight to the endgame which is complaining about eve on reddit!
---
but there is never a bad time to start.  there are now catch up mechanisms (but you don't have to use them).
---
brawl fits mean you're very likely to die and it's a race of how much you can kill before you do. solo BC usually means ull get blobbed to shit or get caps dropped on you in null.

As someone roaming Null, the ability of Ansiblex gates to be safer than regular gates takes a lot of the gating content out of Nullsec, and the fatigue-less component means it's much harder to avoid hictors and bigger things chasing you even if you counter them by flying something small and fast that can escape.
---
Yes, check out the bonuses to probe strength, virus strength and salvaging on the Imicus.
---
And the bonuses To mining yield and gas harvester duration on the Venture, also a cool built in two point warp core stabilizer for running away.

The Magnate, Heron, and Probe are the other races exploration frigs, they all have a T2 covert-ops variant.
---
The agency helps with that?!

Do tell... :)

To be honest, I never went looking for the faction one... The few that I did happen to stumble upon warped away before I could do anything... I never went to try and find a proper fitting and ship for them! :(

I get them all the time in around Detorid/Insmother and never get them in Catch/Immensea/Eso... My secret tinfoil reason is that there is a Ghetto Server that certain regions get banished too got bad behaviour

I was comparing them to jump bridges before fatigue. A jump bridge POS is even scarier to an actual small gang than a Fortizar. Small gang roaming was buzzing in that timer period, you can't attribute an old problem to a recent cause is what I'm getting at.

except it takes..... 3-4? sites to start turning a profit in a myrmidon and like 10-12? in an ishtar after insurance so ticks don't really matter until you start getting your investment back. By the time you break even in an ishtar you've already made 100 million ish in a myrmidon.

Exactly why any sane person who wants to be worth something wouldn't join imperium.
---
Are you in a market hub solar system? (Jita and Amarr are the big two, Hek is also decent). People generally charge more if you're further out from the hubs. Also, what ship are you trying to fit and what do you want it to do? And what guns are you looking at? You'll only be able to use certain ones given the size of ship and the skills you have.
---
It’s okay buddy, we’ll be irrelevant together.
---
Your a god damn hero
---
Null sec was always supposed to be more lucrative than high and low. The problem is the ease of access. With mega blocs like goons and horde pulling in hundreds of new players a month, it leaves the rest of Eve in a state of stasis, but geared towards the decline with more players leaving than the game could replace.
---
The problem is new players are surrounded by people who’ve likely been playing for years and are naturally able to fly “bigger and better” ships. So what does newbean do? Injects and gets a taste of seratonin which can be repeated indefinitely. 
---
And I’m not saying injectors are bad. The problem is a large group of players are bypassing what makes Eve so great. The learning curve, dabbling in this and that, and natural progression. 
---
So while Null has become a bit boring, other places in Eve are struggling to thrive because they can’t pull the same amount of players - the same players told to carrier/rorq rat in null instead of learning, stumbling, and dabbling wherever the fuck else.
---
Great recap Jin!
---
Hey if you want me to get in-game and answer a few questions you might have let me know. I like helping more than actually playing the game nowadays. If you have Discord we could chat a bit to make sure you're up to speed on the "basics".
---
Just let me know if you want me to take some time to help you and I'll PM you my details.
---
The relevant metric is the life-cycle isk per hour. That is what is the isk per hour after accounting for the deaths per hour and the cost to replace it. Even when I ran my VNI's 100% AFK without even having my intel reporter open, I only lost about one VNI per 28 hours of active ratting. Those VNI's earned me about 45 million per hour and cost me about 100 million to replace, so that amounted to a 'tax' on my profit of 3.5 million per hour. For a Myrmidon that 'tax' assuming similar life expectancy is 2 million per hour and an Ishtar about 8 million per hour.
---
Thanks Momiji!
---
That the module itself is safe is only part of the problem. Prior, people in regular ships didn't use jump bridges on POSes because they gave fatigue. you used it with specific indy ships that could deal with the fatigue. Now, everybody uses them.
---
My first loss was a tristan, in faction warfare. I was instantly hooked and two days later I killed my first ship, an imperial navy slicer.
---
It was awesome and no game since then has been able to replicate the rush I get from solo/small gang pvp.
---
Pls kill that keepstar, i want that system
---
Could it be because goons actually keep their word and treat their allies well? Hmmmm
---
and ur getting owned by high-sec care bears lmao

I was thinking the same. It almost turned out so nice and interesting.

You can use the structure browser to find station services.  NeoCom-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Structure Browser

Oh, I stand by what I said, but also agree with you. Matterall would absolutely be shot in that war because he has on NC tags. It's not so much the person, but the tags they wear. On the overall he will be red, so he will be shot. :)

---
Concord controls the networks via which Capsuleer brains are transmitted when they die, AFAIK. So if Concord really wanted us dead, we'd be dead.
---
While Goons + Legacy + NC. might be able to field more titans than a single empire, that empire can field just as many regular capital ships, and then also at least 1 if not 2 Iapetan titans, which are worth at least 100 titans if not more. 
---
Then you consider that they can field an order of magnitude more subcapital ships (probably at least 10-15 full battleship fleets along with dozens if not hundreds of cruiser and frigate fleets), and your minor titan advantage will be wiped off the field without too much concern.
---
Pretty sure it's average market price across all of New Eden. So you may be in a region with higher or lower prices, but the cosmic average is what's shown on KMs and mouse over and such.

Please don't shoot my monitor, I'm not in Goons, I just wear the tags.
---
I didn't pull it off, but I was playing into the hands of the thief without knowing it:
---
Years ago I was part of a small, happy go lucky highsec newbie corp with a Raitaru. My CEO promoted me to diplo since I was pretty outgoing at that time. Things were going good for us, despite our CEO showing more and more signs of ineptitude at his job. We were over 50 people on the paper, but only like 10 actually active, yet my CEO kept pursuing ventures which overstretched our infrastructure.
---
One day we stepped up from a Raitaru to an Azbel. Everything was good for another few weeks. We had further noobies join in, including "Unsuspecting guy". Unsuspecting guy was a noob, someone who'd lose ships left and right and soon we developed a running gag, because I kept mixing up his original player faction. After just a few weeks my CEO put up a Sotiyo just a few jumps away.
---
It went good for about two weeks, then we had the first wardec... ...and the second... ...and the third. Not long after we were wardecced by pretty much every highsec mercenary, pirate, cutthroat and, I'm pretty sure, even their grandmas. It went on for two or so weeks, until I made the choice of contacting one of the wardeccers, let's call him Dave. He told me he could "arrange negotiations".
---
The negotiations were brief and short, we had to put down our Sotiyo. One week later the trap sprung; Dave had a few friends already waiting at the Sotiyo to come out of its timer to scoop the egg. And he was successful. Of course this was the straw that broke the Camel's back for our corp. I moved out and invited everyone from the old corp I cared about. A lot of my corpies quit. I only thought: "Eve happens!". I was ready to move on ever since the first wardec.
---
Days later I had a talk with Dave; his spy was "unsuspecting guy" and originally he only planned to steal the Azbel. Of course we provided a better incentive with the Sotiyo. GF Dave.
---
Correct

I have something called standards, not everyone wants to be part of the blue donut. Not everyone wants to mine all day long, not everyone wants to rat all day long, not everyone wants to be a spod brain.

Yeah that's why I also support nerfs to cynos. They reduce content in two ways, both what you say here (people are scared to play with a neutral in system in case it drops a cyno) and because it becomes impossible to take a fight with a roaming gang (because any ship you engage can cyno the umbrella onto you).
---
You're not following, it wasn't a problem for years and years before fatigue was in the game.
---
I think they're hideous and need nerfed, I just think you're barking up the wrong tree if you're looking for major contributing factors to the death of small gang.

If more players were affected by 10 seconds lag, there'd probably be more complaints. 
---
Here's what I experienced during my short play time today in Syndicate: I jumped in a system with 2 players already in it, started scanning signatures while spamming the Dscan button. No lag at all, Dscan refreshing instantly. Then another guy came in system and the Dscan button was immediately stuck for like 5 seconds, probe results took forever to update. Everything went back to normal when the guy exited the system. I asked the other 2 guys if they had lag, but they didn't answer.
---
We're sorry that so many of our members want to burn your home, what are we suppose to do, tell them sorry and to log off?
---
Are you talking about PVE or PVP? 
---
In Eve you can't really fit a ship that can do everything well. You always have to fit a ship depending what you are planning to do with it.
---
Only slighty better than a Carrier with significantly more risk so not worth it.
---
&gt; atleast make cynos not usable while in panic
---
These guys are all multiboxing in big fleets anyway, all this will do is make them put a brick tanked T3C or something in the fleet with a cyno.
---
Yes we do, but it would be nice if some of the nullblob representatives acknowledge J space's existence and can offer CCP some sense on proposed changes too.
---
Epic
---
The agency tells you where the nearby FOB's are; that should help ;) I prefer the Hecate for all haulers; just avoid the response fleet at all costs. Either by using dps to pop the hauler before they arrive, or by pulling them away from the hauler long enough to warp back to it and kill it before they get back in range
---
&gt;Two days after we stole the Hel he was killed in an exploration Astero. So much for already replaced, or perhaps he was just sick of those dank super ticks.
---
Or he was clearing out exploration sites because he enjoys them.
---
This game is a massive multiplayer game. Idea is that players can create their own empires. Which they have.
---
I have looked at all of them, i think i get what you are saying. Fast ships have tracking issues, most the ones you listed have missile damage bonus.
---
Once in a while i come back in this sub. Every time a war is looming and i read how evil/bad goons are.
---
Open industrial window, select the tab that says facilities (I think) and it will list all the structures with what each can do/what bonus and rigs it has and how much tax is and the system index
---
/u/redalert447 got pm to talk to this guy directly

you'll make more just w an afk vni toonie and have that run easy sites while you run other sites on other toonies

so no

I always went for the in your face Talos fitting... Warp in, get close, lock, murder, warp out, count til 30, warp back, get loot, get out.
---
I did lost a few boxes dying this... I also got some hilarious kills during this lol
---
I will try the Hecate approach, also will get an eye out for FOBs.
---
Thanks for the tip o7
---
a brick tanked T3C is still killable while a PANIC module gives you 7 minutes of invulnerability.
---
It gave our 10 man pvp group a target to aim for. At one point we held 100b/month worth of moons for a year. There are no similar targets in null anymore :(
---
So this is a bit of a misconception. Fast anti tackle ships such as the omen navy issue do have trash tracking. But because of their high speed good pilots can do what is transervsal matching on tackle because they go similar speeds and through this they can track and demolish tackle. I’m #2 all time kills on zkill with a nomen and I promise you if your going to fly anti tackle turret ship you need to first master transversals matching. Missile boats such as orthrus and osprey navy are easier to fly because they don’t require this matching and you can be a lot more face roll
---
We could photoshop some minions in. Might be more accurate.
---
It's really nice to watch those things and be updated on the state of things, especially when you were gone from eve for a short while.

[Literally just follow instructions and you'd find it.](https://i.imgur.com/kP2W8mJ.png)

Yes. Ask in your standing fleet if anyone is carrier/super ratting and if you can salvage after them. Usually someone will send you a message. Its better than afk VNI ratting, dont let these nerds tell you otherwise, T2 rigged Noctis and t2 salvagers bring in good isk.
---
Everyone donked my nerdgasm but you know it's pretty obvious why they are being targetted.

bruh you try so hard and you hit like one in fifty of your posts

just chill out

He's pointing out how PHEW dropped dreads on our titan. Those dreads can be docked literally anywhere in Lowsec. It has nothing to do with where a titan can dock.
---
I still think it's worth fixing and I'm going to argue it should be fixed. I never said it was the be all end all master solution, so don't pretend like I did.

8 b in suicide dreads vs 90b in that titan
---
how will the north ever recover?
---
I'm a thief, biggest grab was 4/4 structures from a single Corp.
---
Be me and getting a bit bored of the mining game and decide to go exploring while the others afk. 
---
By exploring I don't mean exploration sites I just mean looking around New Eden for new things to do. 
---
I've been going around and checking out every citadel on dscan and looking for unanchoring structures, find one and I'll stick an alt on it watching and waiting. 
---
Come across a system with 3 athanors and a raitaru unanchoring. Proceed to watch and wait. In total I had 7 accounts up and was watching 6 structures. There was another raitaru and athanor nextdoor too. 
---
Days go by... apparently I found them hours after he hit the button because a full week goes by. I've got all the accounts set up so I can easily look at one screen and see if they are popping or not. My timers are getting close to the 24hrs left point so it's either get a quick nap or power through.
---
Creative thinking leads me to set up a motion alarm that will go off if one of the screens change.
---
Be asleep when I get this dream that I missed all of them and wake up out of fright....
---
Not two minutes after I sit down down at the computer does the first athanor pop, scooped and in station, next one pops... alright this is going to be quick. Scooped and in station, pop; scooped.
---
At the raitaru I see a orca slow boating into the center from docking range, heart is racing as idk if he has webs or anything else fitted, pop it goes and I uncloak initiate warp and get ready to scoop his structure right in front of him. Ooof; scooped and in station. 
---
A lonely "eh whatever" is said in local followed by "you get them all?"
---
I replied with a yup and asked if he wanted to buy them back, no anvil 
---
The guy took his loss really well and I was now 4 structures richer.
---
Sadly, this doesn't stop your structures from getting destroyed.
---
Nice of you to include an AAR or anything else useful
---
\&gt;You don't have to mine, you just have to take advantage of the massive amounts of people who do
---
if it's eve and it does not die, you are using it badly.
---
He's doing good as far as I know. Obviously for a dude in his role previously he doesn't necessarily want to publicize his life though
---
**FFS** Just make ore anom respawn rates equal to the refresh rate of asteroid belts
---
Citadel bash gone wrong, dropped dreads against skillu Mino repping nightmares, Mino survives and gotg dreads die.
---
Hope its all good and fine
---
He seems to be a very nice guy, wish him the best
---
right now if you fit up a destroyer with all salvegers and one gun and head to one of the invasions which you can find in the agency you can likely make an incredible amount of money. 
---
The one gun is because you must do some damage during the sites in order to get the payout. The salvage in the sites is roughly fifty to a hundred million each site.
---
Yep. He’s enjoying the new gig.
---
Alrighty, based on that I'll make some assumptions and give the best advice I can:  
---
Echoing others, bigger is NOT better, and using a ship that's more expensive than necessary for the job is a good way to receive painful loss mails and run out of isk.  
---
With that in mind it sounds like this job will be killing occaisional rats that spawn, chasing off light tackle ships so your buddies can warp away, and being prepared to run away yourself if a more dangerous fleet is coming.  Cruisers are generally fairly good at bullying frigates, they will cost less than battlecruisers, and they will be better at running away when you need to.  I'm assuming this won't be a super lucrative activity, so something easy to replace is a factor as well.  I recommend either a Caracal with rapid lights or a Vexor.  RLML Caracals are one of the best T1 cruisers in the game, it's short to train their t2 guns, and RLML are great for applying damage to small ships that are typically used to tackle stuff.  The long reload time shouldn't matter much since your fights shouldn't be extended affairs.  I highly suggest you pick a cruiser like the Caracal and train for it until you can fit a good t2 fit and have appropriate support skills in navigation, fitting, tank (shield for caracal), and offensive support.(for missiles that's stuff like rapid launch which applies to all types of missiles)  You'll be able to get far better performance out of a caracal with good skills than a BC with poor ones and at that point you can start training to something bigger, maybe a drake or cyclone if you went the caracal route (but seriously, don't rush into it)
---
Looks like a classic gotg feed, not sure anyone really wants to waste time on an AAR. The real question is how many in this Ishtar blob had krabing ships instead of doctrine ones.
---
Well, you can, provided you have the coin. Since you can technically PVE rather effectively with some PVP ships
---
It's been almost 4 days so far still no response. It's still the weekend  so I'm giving support the benefit of the doubt but in starting to think if it's not answered by Tuesday I will submit a second support ticket.
---
Have combat wombat officially joined gotg/deaco? Sad if so
---
Mittens only has two hands. When he wants to transition to Tapirium form Vily slides down behind him Voltron style until they lock together sharing the same underpants, bum to bum style. They then control Tapirium together in that format.
---
OP probably couldn't find a niche enough stock photo featuring that specific scenario so he went with the easier rendition.
---
Who is this gotg you keep speaking about?
---
They are called Dead Coalition (DeadCo)
---
We have made it to the point to where even goons are goon pets apparently
---
Yep, just the global average.
---
It is hard. Also not often effective. Only place in Eve where you can effectively use pvp ship in pve is Factional Warfare plexes.
---
My bait VNI has 15 mil ticks. Carriers are also rather versatile
---
This is fair enough, I didn’t really know what to title it to be honest. Corp Theft is probably more accurate.
---
Can you get destro with 500k?
---
That's extremely stupid
---
I hate every candidate that wants to change my marauders.
---
this is a great interview, sad he's not running
---
As the other guy said, kinda. 
---
Turret ships are actually better at applying damage than missile ships, assuming the pilot is skilled. 
---
But yeh, missile ships are easier to pilot.
---
Eyy you are number 5 on our ballot bro

---
Or make them less cancerous to kill and drop some loot to incentivize people to kill them. POSes were balanced in that regard, no reason to move away from that concept.
---
easy fix to cynos is to limit the module to recons or BC and up sized ships.
---
Don't have nessessary skills for destros
---
They should drop 50% of the items inside them. The other 50% can be asset safety.
---
Most players are expected to be able to fly a basic destroyer by the end of the tutorial the advanced military agent gives you a destroyer at the very end you should be able to train it quickly if you haven't already. 
---
Chances are the skill that you would need to train is salvaging. Without a ship like a destroyer you certainly will not be doing very high missions.
---
The more practical answer, and one that is less time-sensitive, would be to do exploration.
---
Starting a GoFundMe to get ccp a 3d printer to make eve off brand legos

That is also a problem with people, not just with the game mechanics.

If you had to bring one boi, to fight many bois, and that boi cannot be bigger than a battleship boi, what boi would you bring?

Who? Leave the man alone, he left Eve for a reason.

And here I thought Matterall is goons because he ran INN.
---
Grrrrr Tasts.
---
Yeah and using proper fit you could get better ticks. Not effective. 15 mil tick means 45mil in a hour. 
---
Paying your electricity bill from running your computer might be more expensive than 45mil/hour.

Major players right now:

PanFam: Two "elite" alliances and the biggest newbie alliance in the game. Second place in terms of power. Live in the north. At war with Imperium
---
TEST: Reddit folks. Live in the south. Neutral but not really with Imperium. At war with Frat. Rather close with PanFam in terms of power.
---
Frat: Made up mainly from chinese players that fled from Serenity, which basically turned into one giant blob that controls everything. At war with TEST. I'd put them 4th in terms of power. Live in the east

FI.RE: Russians. Have a really storied history of not ever really interacting with the rest of us and living in the shittiest regions there are. Close ties to TEST and also at war with Frat (?). Live in the south

---
Claws
---
Didn't want them anyway right?
---
What does that even has to do with delaying local ??
---
That's what I call content.
---
The sticks should be labeled "literally how agreements and coalitions work"
---
First of all: make sure you have the proper skills trained up for turrets and the ship, otherwise you can't fly it. Also, only buy tech 1 turrets until you have the skills for tech 2. If you are really new, if it's anything bigger than a destroyer, sell it and buy some cheap frigates/destroyers to learn the game.
---
The same as wormhole mechanics in nullsec you complete cretin: absolutely nothing.
---
That looks rough...
---
Imagine learning how your one time coalition bros actually fucking hated you?
---
Thanks! Thats quite some comprehensive advice.
---
Read the complete cretin's post again and you'll see no mention of wormhole mechanics in K-space. Delaying local updates is noway near removing them completly.
---
This is actually a really good suggestion.
---
I guess so, because transversal is relative and velocity  / missile explosion velocity is not.
---
But i will try to use missile ship for now.
---
1. Station trading is more like 3 to 5 % but it binds a lot of capital a sometimes the market is just saturated, or you have to many competitors and must take some days "off". 100 mil is to get your feet wet, to really earn something you need way more, but I can't give you an exact figure.
---
2. For scanning look into the t1 explorer frigates (for gallente its the Imicus), also if you upgrade to the sister’s launcher or sisters probes you get some bonus but be aware of the costs. First rule of eve: don’t fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
3. Your margin will be small, if you can manage to make profit at all. You need good skills and good bp's to make a coin that way, it's not so easy to start up industry just like that. but if you join one of the big corp's you'll can get a mentor and cheaper materials for that.
---
5. explorer frigs have a bigger cargo hold for its size and a good align time, still it’s not always the volume but the value of a cargo that limits you to transport it (not really but you shouldn't), but again a big corp will offer logistic service for that matter. And in the beginning, you shouldn't have much high value to transport through dangerous regions like null or low.
---
6. always good money for a newbro is exploration, hacking relict and data sites, you can also combine it with a combat ship a do some ded or anomalies in higsec. But it’s more important that you try different things and not to start the grind too early in your eve life, so you have a good picture of what is fun for you.
---
And one last advice for trading, scams are "legal" in eve, so you won't be protected by ccp, it’s like real life, if some deal seems too good to be true it’s probably not.
---
They red boxed a Drek in PvE ships... Boggles the mind.
---
&gt; It’s significantly more viable to have a small alliance hold space in sov without getting immediately rolled over
---
This is completely and infuriatingly false. It's never been *more* difficult for a small entity to take space, and never has there been less of an incentive for people to choose a small alliance over a big one. Independence is less important than safety to most players, so they need somewhere to park their Rorquals and they sure aren't going to go to the little guy with those.
---
Just look at Etherium Reach, considered to be one of the last few refuges for the little-guy alliances. Unspoken tried, impressively, to live there for a long time, but as soon as Panfam decided they had to go, they went. 
---
Rorquals are a cause of this problem, but so are renter empires and unsustainable seal clubbing. You want real positive game health change? Fix those things so the little guy doesn't just give up and widot into a blob when one comes for them.
---
This is a video game and people should not be expected to gather 1000 friends just to be able to survive in it.
---
Sort once told me he was hoping they renamed as Dumpster Co.
---
Those [random caps you find floating](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/and-a-fax-for-free/) in space really can make your day. And they are the reason why my main character can now fly every capital... well, except Titans.
---

Mad props to the black hand agent who convinced Hedliner to timer to AU tz and strategically give away an entire rental region for free to GOTG. My money is on Doom Chimp Chilla being the spai.

That looks like a painful butt-plug, gonna need some extra lube.
---
aye, make wormholes great.  bring cynos to wormholes!
---
I don't like this gimmicky stuff. 
---
For small citadels
---
Increase Citadel EHP 300%
---
Increase Damage Cap 500%
---
Open the window for final timer and armor timer +- 1:30min from when it is set (This provides a little tz overlap possibility). 
---
Result: more effort to hit damage cap as it would now effectively be 15k dmg. However the timer would now take around 10-12min if hitting dmg cap.
---
What's happening in Tenal anyway? ... PL and NC lost all sov there... to RR and WOMBO?
---
I would ask you to point out where it was viable for a small alliance to hold space in 2014.
---
1. So I'll be earning around 3-5% of capital? I don't have much experience to know how good that is, where do other methods of earning stand?
---
2. I use the Imicus currently.
---
3. I'm joining Karmafleet/Brave Newbies so I should be fine.
---
4. Got it, thanks.
---
5. Cool! What options are there? I did look at this handy EVE graphic with a lot of boxes, but can you just give me the broad categories? e.g Mining, Industry, Trading/Hauling, PvP, etc
---
6. I know - I was actually thinking of trying to scam people once I knew more about game mechanics as a way of earning money, except idk if I'm that much of an asshole yet.
---
\*Reek
---
Im ok with this if they also add a new cyno module that is the exact same but with a minute spool up time and can be fitted to any ship. That way we can still have cyno frigs etc.
---
It would 100% be the AFK go-to if VNIs were specifically nerfed.  A high skilled Myrm can pull ~40m an hour, be cheap as hell to replace, and be more survivable than a VNI.  Application is a complete non-issue for a flight of 3 heavies+2 mediums.
---
He was probably an oppressed gamer that couldn't dock there.
---
Active rating is just so much worse then drone ratting. I dont care if i could fly a better ship. Drone ratting is just so good and easy. but also most pve in this game is super boring.
---
&gt; Rorquals which have enough tank to ignore 40+ ships
---
forgot the part where they have enough tank to tank a literal infinite number of ships for like 5 mins
---
Umm, yeah. People that support the game since 03 should have a huge advantage with isk and SP than people who supported since 2017. The old eve is better than this new in almost every aspect. People haven’t gotten smarter, the game became harder for the hunter and safer for the hunted. 
---
The true experts of eve don’t play the game  anymore. Btw, doom chinchilla was playing albion online last night. That’s saying a lot about eve currently playstyle.
---
You know... all structures anchored to moons was a great way to avoid structure spam.
---
&gt;I thought the prevailing theory from panfamville was that test and legacy are also imperium pets... So did you just forget to add them or did your side get the narrative mixed up again?
---
back pocket is not in the shot
---
I didn't play in 2014. I can't speak to that time and I can't tell you whether you're right or wrong about holding space then. That doesn't change anything I said or make it wrong.
---
It's still nigh-impossible to go after space in a state of nullsec where renter landlords immediately kick you out and everyone wants to run a dozen Rorquals. If you don't have to join a blob to stay competitive, there's incentive to stay in a smaller group. Eve 2019 doesn't have this, and wormholes are not the answer.
---
If you want to claim to represent the little guy, maybe listen to one. I've been at this for about three years.
---
would be me
---
&gt; Yeah how do they do in wormholes
---
Oh!  He mentioned wormholes.  How do they do that in WH space... strange.  You can't fucking read can you.
---
Checkmate atheists
---
You're welcome.  Most of the community loves our new players.  Don't get me wrong, we'll still kill you immediately given the chance.  Eve is boring as hell when it isn't challenging and dangerous.  But that said, the people that catch you and beat you are often a great source of advice and a good percentage are happy to give it if you ask nicely.  You just need to make your questions specific because ship selection and fitting in this game is very specialized.  Fly dangeous :)
---
A month or so ago, I led a whaling fleet down south, and we lucked out and found two unpiloted Hel's sitting on a POS grid. Stole both of them as well, in a very similar fashion. Seems to be more and more common, with more people super rating. I, for one, am glad to see people being punished for being silly with their supers. Congrats on the clean steal, fellow Heljacker!
---
You began your point by saying it’s never been more difficult. It was more difficult in 2014. I am by no means saying it’s perfect now, but it’s a hell of a lot better than it used to in regards to small alliances, so it’s important not to lose all that progress. If you think it’s bad now, you’d be pulling your eyes out five years ago.
---
Spotted the nerd owning a 3dprinter? :D
---
Shoot me an EVEmail. I'm the only trustworth ISK halfer in new eden, and you don't even have to do any special things. You just give me ISK and get 1 of every 2 back!
---
That progress was lost when Rorquals were introduced. The incentive to stay in a small alliance was obliterated. The little guy groups have been widotting into the blobs in droves ever since.
---
Yurp
---
sounds reasonable, and they could just have the recons/bc/up have no cooldown for regular cynos.
---
Also posses could only be placed at moons. My ideas along your points are;
---
\- Reintroduce starbase charters for highsec and lowsec, with lowsec being cheaper than highsec. Get mission runners more involved in the economy and make LP actually worth ISK again. 
---
\- Make citadel placement dependant on a gravity well (planet/moon). Of course this could be less confined as the old pos system.
---
\- Raise damage cap. 5000 dps cap on a multi million ehp citadel is just ridiculous.
---
Very good and informative video. I would have wished that you would have mentioned the probably upcoming lowsec war between Shoot First and Snuffed Out. It may be lowsec but it still provides good fights and null isn't everything.
---
Cool :D
---
What 3dprinter do you have? I'm looking at options, and a prusa is pretty far up there on the list... (rip wallet)
---
The TLDR is that DeadCo took the opportunity of NC/PL being busy with goons to carpet siege Tenal before the timers changed from AUTZ.
---
FUCKING OUTSTANDING.
---
It's basically just the current system, just with upscaling difficulty and infinite rooms. Can't be that hard
---
&gt; The only decent line members are those that join sigs
---
that's stretching the meaning of decent quite far
---
MWD armor Ishtars vs Nightmares lmao.
---
*I enjoyed playing Eve today.*
---
nice try chris roberts
---
This is extremely boring. I thought this would be something like you in a frigate and them underestimating you, some fun in highsec, but I don't really think that killing people that agress on a battlecruiser, not to mention a dual rep reactive drek (askleps?) which beats most BS in a straight up 1v1. I have skipped a few minutes and just found T1 BS kills - if there are more interesting kills in the latter half you should put them first.
---
I liked the intro, music and editing was fine. Upon further research it seems that the character you were using is the alt of Ektallion, which I have known to be one of the most risk-adverse people in the game.
---
TLDR: This video is bad, nobody cares about zkill stats, even with #1 you don't seem too confident to risk a real fight
---
Wasn't aware of it! I'll have to find some sources and battle reports and get it covered at some point when things kick off
---
Why do these people engage you? Even if they were going to win, they don't have tackle, so you can just warp off. And a drek is pretty strong, borderline OP in 1v1 with the ramp up, a PVE fit isn't going to be able to compete in most cases anyway.
---
Looks like fun though.
---
Well maybe if you stopped doing roams through The Imperium Peoples Free Republic of Deklein and got out there and picked up a toaster machine you'd make it on to the ticket. Service guarantees Citizenship you know.
---
Sometimes you just got to dread bomb, you know what I mean? :)
---
GF to you guys tho. Was a fun fight.
---
Apparently they are offical deadco now as they changed their sov to Autz lmao.
---
Why is there no Mountain of Salt in the background?

Today, Provi decided to go after the cyno jammer in YQB-22, RC showed up  in Machariels, to contest Provi's carriers and Machariels. Then - subsequent to a tactical triage and HAW dread feed into their own bubbles - RC held Provi in a Mexican standoff for the cyno jammer, left the grid and did a quick feint round a jump bridge loop to catch Provi with their trousers down bang slap on top of the cynojammer. A brawl ensued leading to a tactical feed of some RC HAW dreads which Provi dropped a stack of dreads upon - this was the moment RC had been waiting for! The supers log in, the hammer comes down and Provi's dreads proceed to vanish into the ethereal darkness. Provi's mach fleet is still trying to stay on grid until finally, dreads obliterated, triage gone and severely depleted, they leave the field. RC's resident turbocrabs go into overdrive and have the field looted and salvaged in record time.  
---
Good fights all round!
---
Opportunity is a interesting word more like goons told deadco to jump and they said where
---
Leaving the wrecks over is pretty much like leaving half the ISK you could take from a Haven on the floor. The trashloot is good as a mineral source, the salvage is excellent ISK income. You can make hundreds of millions by cleaning up after supers.
---
Hi looking at options, and a prusa is pretty far up there on the list... (rip wallet), I'm dad.
---
Yeah goons you guys can have em
---
This was done on a Form2, a slightly advanced liquid based system.   
---
Prusa is by far my most recommended name in beginner and advanced FDM machines, but an excellent budget option is the Wanhao or its clone (Makerselect ) series. Just be prepared to do a bit more tinkering with these machines.
---
I'm looking at the actual OP hbu?
---
Fight started out fine, we used carriers to hit the anchoring jammer, 1 fax and 1 dread dropped on the carriers, Vysh lit his cyno and sub caps went in, we quickly dispatched the dread and fax, waited out the cyno on the carrier, red mach fleet bridges in and starts sniping at us long range, we lose a few sub caps before fleet wakes up and starts to broad cast for reps, cyno goes down, we warp to the blue astra on grid to wait out the repair timer.
---
After the astra repaired the red mach fleet left local and went back to Camal, we stuck around to kill the jammer, red machs bribed back in w/ more dreads this time, instead of just bouncing we stuck around and dropped dreads of our own and the op went sideways from there. 
---
GF and provi is recruiting.
---
Darkness were there today in the Vale fight
---
SWAG
---
Oh, this guy without sarcasm mode. Greetings.
---
We even almost killed a sniping Tengu. So close :)
---
Who needs to rat if you rat ratters :D
---
My kb says otherwise
---
CCP is in his back pocket
---
Ektallion not my alt, just ex-corp mate with zkb problems in head mb, idk really. It was his boost session (wich includes me).
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31000315/201906030300/
---
it all his alts lol
---
Well done, thanks making.
---
I want to suggest we call the war between Legacy &amp; FIRE vs. WinterCo the "Smoldering Invasion".
---
Also you may be interested in a longer BR I have written about one of the major battles which this conflict has produced a bit longer ago: [https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2019/04/12/the-battle-for-detorid/](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2019/04/12/the-battle-for-detorid/) 
---
Is this supposed to be offensive?
---
I guess they have a dream
---
wow, titans and supers kill dreads?
---
I killed plenty of people in LS mission and in plexes (and in HS missions while wardeccing). People actually good at this game will one cycle probe you, and send a Lachesis to tackle you. Pretty hard balanced in my book. (Also some plexes are not deadspace, you can land at 0 on someone doing Serpentis Logistical outpost part 2 for example).
---
Same for abyssal, if you can't probe you don't deserve the kill tbh.
---
HS incursions, I'll agree, are a bit out of whack. But the awesome ISK/h is for the few people that don't spend ages in waiting list...
---
What is the justification kool-aid for this eviction?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XM46dP4.png](https://i.imgur.com/XM46dP4.png) 5760x1080
---
Goons be like Yeahh....Nah.
---
GF dude. Nice to see you not tin-foil hatting any more. 
---
Thanks provi for bringing it. Finally gave me the fight i've been waiting for &lt;3 I'm genuinely grateful for that; hope your guys recover from their losses quickly and people aren't too bummed out about it!
---
Oh c'mon not this shit again.
---

---
There won't be any content if you delay or remove local.  That's the point you idiot.  The number of targets is going to drop like a stone and you'll be back on reddit whining like a little girl because you can't find anyone in null to gank.
---
The point of bringing an overwhelming force, is to remind them you can outform them badly. So you, you are going to be smugposting about that shit so the members that already did not bother the last sure as hell will not the next time too.
---
So flying X jumps searching for a VNI is free just like if we use spod to make ships they're free right?
---
GF one of the best fights I've had in awhile :)
---
Kikimora
---
Can I get you a tissue?
---
This. EVEs risk vs reward is very silly atm.
---
Try r/ender3
---
Idk about you but people so smug post after winning 4:1 just look dumb af and does nothing to my morale. If anything it makes winning outnumbered all that much more satisfying.
---
Hammerwerke are known shitters. They have nearly no bushido coin left and their eviction was imminent
---
look mom im on reddit!
---
Yeah, but there's literally no point in training more than DCM II. The damage cloud is only 5km out from the asteroid which means you should be able to easily sit at range and never take damage.
---
And AGAIN, It doesn't show if the Station can do Invention, only Industry in general.
---
Hole Control are evicting any German corps they can find
---
Never got cloud damage and I moved my ship into the cloud to check the damage. Just train the Merco mining skill far enough for t2 Deep Core Miners and possibly crystals.
---
With Skill Urself apparently leaping to their defense. Learn something new everyday in this game and did not know they were PanFam puppets.
---
This is just PL pets, failing to defend Tenal, from Goons Pets. 
---
Skillu botters don't deserve the isk NCPL is paying them.
---
Brought a kazoo, blitz have it to
---
GF dudes
---
But gotta say it...
---
Join the winning side;
---
NLDF is recruiting!
---
Dancul, this might be a good time to talk about how Doom is a Goon spy and should be kicked.
---
Alright just figure it out on your own then.
---
That feeling when posting is all you can do.
---
I totally get where you're coming from, but j space doesnt need someone who's second, third, or 4th largest platform/group is wormholes. 
---
And from talks with other non wormhole CSM candidates I noticed they dont have a solid grasp on what's going on and what problems J space has. They either dont know or have the issue where they want to fix the surface problem and not the root cause of it.
---
Ahh my mistake, a mighty wormholer. Thinking that everyone should play the game how he wants it, and at the same time call everyone out that noone (in the csm) supports their playstyle... (btw I apparently hit dead-center with "ELITIST PVP shitonthePVEr")
---
Well, ye it's a difference. Loging a titan out in a POS in a friendly region is pretty much the same as docking in a keepstar, except that you cannot use the pilot anywhere else and the titan is tranfered (within 3 weeks) to one of the most ultra-camped stations in eve for a decent fee. But then again, usually a Titan pilot is not really used for alot, except using titans... so...
---
BTW, just to make it clear. I am totally PRO more payment when you lose your stuff in nullsec as well as more reward for the ones bashing it. But calling it per se worse than before and "cheap" to lose a home is just ignorant.
---
Weird. I have a feeling I read this exact same story a week or 2 ago. May have been a similar situation.
---
Because goons etc are supplying it in the comments
---
Upvote this person they are telling it like it is.
---
Looks like that did it, Thanks for the help!
---
See, I don't know why these "guides" didn't bother to just say the same thing. Thanks for the info.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
the fuck's wrong with you people
---
eve's *always* been about ruining the other dude's day
---
Seeing as how I accidentally pinged it directly to Volta on my discord.
---
My corporation is proving to all who use Thera, that this is BOBS holy land land.
---
If you expect to use it, for ANYTHING except goals in his name, expect to die.
---
This space is for wormholers, and we take it back.
---
If this interests you, join "Sons of bob".
---
Praise bob.
---
That is not how it should be, no
---
No sarcasm needed, I get them aggressing the guy who use to do it in an Enyo as big ship little ship mentality of highsec.
---
But a Drek is nearly in the same ship class.
---
Nice video was good.
---
I'd love to chat to you some time about the holy war for ~~Jerusalem~~ Thera!
---
Better still, just get rid of local altogether
---
You probably consumed the bpc you put in initially btw, not the bpo
---
He isn't the one getting prominent people in opposing alliances banned with no investigation by telling CCP he thinks they broke the rules...
---
i just get a smile on my face when i see his love for the game...you better keep streaming mr bee!
---
Hmmmm, Thanks. I'll have to Look into it then.   
---
Thanks for the Info.
---
Check all of your containers also it can put it in random spots.
---
Point on the doll where sort touched you ok?
---
I think they were going for insulting
---
You are embarrassingly wrong
---
Maybe not for you, but it does for people already feeling like not playing. It is not I am pulling this out of thin air. Every war you can see both sides starting out with high numbers and then one sides starts sliding first. It is usually the sides that also loses. So you can either compensate with enough members and/or allies since playing the "High SP requirement to join corp x" has gone out of the window since skill injecting. 
---
It also the reason why panfam most likely did not even bother to stand their ground. They decided to not adapt to the new meta of the industrial age and they gambled and lost badly. Once the gazillion super and titans moved over and having lost the former KS fights already, the odds were even worse now. I understand the strategy of rolling over because there is fuck all you are going to do about it besides adding more losses to somehting that is already a guarantued loss. Sure you can pick some fights and maybe win a few, but it is not going to slow down the burning of entire regions and everything with it. 
---
I do agree with you, that "smugposting" about a 4:1 win is worthless if you want to do it because "we won lol" but it has propaganda value. That is also just about it. It is basically the same when Redline 12 or 13 switched sides, found himself into a somewhat "FC" position in a fight that was won because of a dozen things but not his elte peeveepee targeting callings kills, then runs to reddit and makes a lengthy post about it. It had to "lol we won" value, but is had propaganda value.
---
Pretty much except for corps that actually provide content
---
It might have something to do with how NC just sat on the fence and watched horde try and evict a "valued ally" after they gave up 40 faction forts to buy those allies some time off from a war they all knew they couldn't win.
---
Blue tie for INIT, I approve.
---
Carry on.
---
[https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/G5Q5xN5vSKJKk73Ps](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/G5Q5xN5vSKJKk73Ps) should have proper sides
---
Didn't realise NC had joined as well.
---
NO ITS UNFAIR BLOBBING KILLING THE GAME
---
Lmao when will Garbage of the Galaxy actually win a fight.
---
I can't think of any entity in the game worse than these clowns at the minute.
---
&gt;Service guarantees Citizenship you know  
---
  
---
I think LAWN are more of a herpes goons can't get rid off than actual Imperium citizens
---
Just a theory but i think it's because of a Xtrasquishy wannabe train
---
If it helps as I'm still new to Eve, I second doing all the entry-level career missions.  I actually doubled down on them by going from Mimnitar space to Galentee and repeated them all.  Each branch gets you free ships including a destroyer.  Then do the Sisters of Eve Epic ARC as well.
---
Was that the one where they fed an ishtar fleet to a skillu nightmare fleet half their size?
---
Humberside yes
---
Providence is a state of mind
---
The N+1 meta was never new
---
well when you are deadco and you already fought a successful defense against someone who was kind enough to set all their timers for your prime tz, and those same people are also busy losing 2 other regions worth of assets to someone else why not take their stuff while they are busy? Its not like they can take it back.
---
its always the back
---
Agreed but the situation is different. Tribute is for all intents and purposes 'NC/PL' space. Horde is here right now but but that's more of a deployment than where they live.
---
NC and PL are filled with old players. Many of whom find their roots in BoB. These aren't people who are just going to quit because things are bad. This isn't any of our first losing war. In fact the prospect of killing goons spikes activity if anything, and we're all well aware of what fighting goons is like. We're used to fighting outnumbered. Granted historically we had supercapital dominance but in today's eve that means fuck all anyway. None of these recent fights would have been swayed by supercap dominance on the other side.
---
If this were a campaign against horde. If this were a campaign against test. I could see some merit. But it's not.
---
Haven’t had a chance to use this site on mobile, and it turned out to be surprisingly awful.
---
Imagine calling gotg deadco after they kicked the alliance that came up with the name
---
Good Guys win again.
---
Tenal disagrees... Check your intel dumbo
---
You're a pet, you're a pet EVERYBODYS A PET!!!
---
I have a Prusa at work and a Maker Select v2 at home. The Maker Select v2 actually produces similar quality to the Prusa, but the real reason Prusa wins out is because of reliability. The Prusa we have at work has put out over 60 mid-sized prints without jamming or breaking down, a feat I couldn't imagine replicating with my own printer. That said, I paid $280 instead of $750-$1000. That said, although either of these printers output excellent quality, to get the level of detail at that size that OP posted, you really need to buy an SLA 3d printer. Those tend to be messier to use and more expensive, but prices have dropped lately. The cheapest one is sold by monoprice, but comes with no "official" software. That said, according to reviews, people have gotten it to work.
---
Vexor and caracals
---
lol never not shit talk, duh.
---
always

[No they are called gotg](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bn5un2/comment/en2nm04)

But at least they aren't homeless

I was dispatched so quick :D

Unrelated, but Dodixie on a slow day is bigger than Hek at peek time just fyi.

Bring back sbus... fuck sov wands

BREAKING NEWS AT 11: PROVI-BLOC REACHES OUT TO SPECTRE FLEET FOR A BATPHONE-- TURNS OUT, TRC DIDN'T NEED IT ANYWAY
---
What about Delve though!?
---
Nice vid, you guys murdered us a while back. Always take bait procs   
---
There are even worse entities in tenal?... holly molly... unless of course you mean Guristas, but even they occasionally claim some great kills from gotg...
---
Think there's an EVE york meetup sometimes?
---
They're not good solo unless you have a ton of time on your hands.
---
Once someone gets you on their radar, any decent militia can lock you down safely until an unfightable force comes along to clean you up
---
Will you get fair fights? Sure. Sometimes. But only when one is given to you.

Subsisting on the good will of EVE players is generally a bad time

"Grand Theft Super-Carrier".    
---
It has a nice ring to it.
---
Everyone will jump in to shoot gotg. It's like shooting fish in a barrel, or kicking puppies. They never fight back, but are great for getting you lots and lots of kills to pad your kb. Who would ever say no to that?

kinda like ur fitting skills lmao

i'm sure we'll run out of spodbrains to welp supers soon^tm

still shows you as being in yulai btw
---
No.no. that's the Amar one
---
I wouldn't bother defending either if my enemy overwhelmed me by 4x too tbh lose afew citadels and save my assets for later
---
pls stop
---
Просим вас остановиться.
---
That's just completely unrealistic. Not a single zkill feed screen visible anywhere.
---
Teesside
---
Is this where I sign in for the smug over irrelevant kills class?
---
I'm gonna take a hard guess and say they didn't want to fight 1032:510
---
Also lol at GOTG "third partying"
---
That said
---
You need to make a meme to pull a post like that of
---
Giving a titan away like that is still a fairly big thing, even if it's "just" a hull+rigs
---
wormholer btw
---
Fighting GOTG is like flying a titan in the Imperium. Relaxing, fun, a bit boring, and absolutely no meaningful risk if you're not a complete idiot.
---
Do anything other than smug on Reddit over killing Delve capitals .
---
Why did they bring Ishtars again? Didn't they learn that last time?
---
Your average NC pilot sees their renters as scum and treat them with contempt. They consider allies to be 1/10 of a step up from renters. Its sad to say but Goons treat their enemies better than NC treats its "allies".
---
RTM
---
Remove all timers on non fueled structures
---
I dunno why but I really enjoyed the video. The first time I decided to check how much of the 20min had past I was already past the 15min mark. I take that as a good sign :)
---
You can anchor up to 3 in system.
---
This. Super ratting is all about 3 heavies and 2 lights. Easiest way to roll through rats.
---
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... burn
---
How old are you? I don't think you're legally allowed to venture into the internet without parental supervision.
---
&gt;Also lol at GOTG "third partying"
---
They are a 3rd party, they don't have a relationship with the Imperium (and as far as i know) have no coordination with the Imperium besides maybe having their FC talk to the Imperium FC when they are on grid with each other, which is pretty normal for 3rd parties to do in nullsec.
---
I still remember the days when goons 3rd partied alongside NC. to punch test in the face repeatedly after the colapse of the HBC.
---
I don't see anything unusual when gotg 3rd party situation in this conflict.
---
You just never see the empire military capital fleets.  They aren't weak just unseen
---
Welcome friend! Prepare to die :)
---
Shit you're right I knew I was forgetting one. Meanwhile, RIP Rens.
---
Was a good fight, granted alot of our losses could have been avoided but oh well, you win some you lose some.
---
YoU aRe BlUe CaUsE bOtH ShoOt pAnFam
---
You got flair-baited.
---
That's the kind of stuff I think CCP should strive to incentivize. People should want to fight when a reasonable fight presents itself. I don't know the best way to go about that, but if your group has like 8 guys online grinding some isk, and a gang of 3 guys rolls through everyone is going to have a lot more fun if you park the pve ships and then undock a pvp fleet and try to kill each other.
---
&gt;I’m not sure how considering wormholes is a negative
---
"or have the issue where they want to fix the surface problem and not the root cause of it" 
---
A bad solution can easily make everything worse instead of just leaving the problem alone.
---
So im going to need the file for reasons k thanks
---
There are so many these days.
---
That’s the point of the reach out and talk to people part of the CSM job. Most of my wormhole platform is composed of discussions with various current and former wormhole residents. Loro was particularly helpful on it. I invite you to check out the wormhole section in my website and provide feedback on it.
---
WITH THE WIZARD HAT
---
I'll do it if you win. I'm just going to be voting, like most of J space, for a wormhole candidate.
---
war never changes
---
This is half the reason STV exists, allowing you to fill 10 slots, so that you have more opportunities to change the outcome of the election than your initial vote.
---
You mean like smug on reddit over killing structures?
---
&gt; They are a 3rd party, they don't have a relationship with the Imperium (and as far as i know) have no coordination with the Imperium 
---
It’s one thing to bend the truth, it’s another to lie.
---
Put your in game name up here, you'll likely get some money thrown at you by an older player.
---
When you get to a certain level, tens/hundreds of millions of ISK is literally pocket change.
---
Lol. K.

Install the new Borderlands 2 DLC for free until July 8th.
---
I'm 69
---
imagine playing eve in 2019
---
I only have Borderlands 1, otherwise I would. But I really am enjoying the game so far I want to keep going!
---
my only really big heist consisted of about 4 months of actually enjoying my time in corp, i was the teeth so to speak in a indy corp. ex merc looking to chill out for a while. Got annoyed by the CEO just like OP. eventually got to the point where it was not really worth it regardless of the people I enjoyed flying with. everyone has there price, mine was about 140B. could have walked off with a fortizar at the time and alot more but I did not want to hurt the average player in corp. should have tho, they lost it a few months later. Ive only told this story once. or twice. I actually gave away 30-40B to friends and new players. Id say I would have made more isk if I had not sold a bulk of the blueprints at near firesale prices, sold some to the CEO as well ironically.  
---
Moral of the story is dont be a dick to the people who are trying to help you.
---
i'm just stating a fact that 3rd parties in nullsec have never been real 3rd parties, there is always an informal agreement between FCs to just focus their effort into one side.
---
The agreement may be more formal in the case of GOTG due to the obviously strained relations between gotg and Panfam, but that still doesn't remove them from the category of a 3rd party by Eve Nullsec definition of the term.
---
Lol
---
that's not how propaganda works though
---
I aspire to being irrelevant enough to be called a goon pet
---
You want good drone skills if you want to get into a moa.
---
Honestly, right now as a noob with a cormorant, you should train salvaging and some scann9ng skills and go ninja salvage in Invasion space.
---
You'll have a blast and it will be educational. Its also valuable salvage, so good ISK.
---
Yeah, sorry. I didn't really read that through before I posted it.
---
I use tornado and a combat prober.
---
That is their official name, and for "reasons", I intend to honor that.
---
&gt; Also lol at GOTG "third partying"
---
No collusion! Total exonoration!
---
Missions I believe.

This was funny! Made me chuckle.

---
Remind me again, what happens to bullies in wormhole space?
---
Yeah I haven't been to Rens in months but last time it was under 75 in local. Meanwhile lowest I've seen in Dodixie is ~150.
---
This.
---
And make structures need 10 "&lt;high sec sov holder&gt; Starbase Charter" an hour. If they ran out, the faction navi start shoting the structure. (will rf if high power / will kill in low power)
---
Starbase Charter cost 5 LP each.
---
Extra: If the faction standing between the high sec sov holder and the structure owner is more then 6,67 it will be reduce by 50%.
---
Not North East but East Midlands here.
---
How does the CSM voting shenanigans work? Where do I vote?
---
Wow I literally just printed this out on my form 2!
---
one..... word....... HNNNNNNNNNNNNG
---
I'll do some YouTube research on how to Selvage. Should I use my Cormorant? What systems should I look for wrecks in? I'm currently in Akiainavas.
---
No I meant stating that GotG wasn’t aligned with Goons. They’re literally assisting in the war effort and allowing transit as well as assisting in Venal/Tenal.
---
That’s like saying the Soviet Union was a third party against the Nazis.
---
welcome to eve, you can make very mirrored actions that you can in RL. some people are capable of shitty things, this is the game to figure out who you are. Ive robbed "friends" but ive also consoled and talked people all of the ledge so to speak. Its a game, take that as you will.
---
Dudes in Provi took a look At the war in north and decided to show how to have fun
---
It depends a bit on what direction you want to go with the game.  Eve is a sandbox, so "What's next" depends largely on your goals.
---
If you're looking for another chain of missions that will net you some worthwhile isk and standing while you're training things, the Epic Arc in Arnon can be completed mostly in a T1 frig, though with lower SP you'll want to be in a T1 cruiser in the later half of it.
---
If you're not interested in doing the Arc, but still want to do missions - Level 1 missions work better in a destroyer, rather than a cruiser.
---
for real. I remember being on a 7 week waiting list for a prusa 1.   
---
Now the same technology is on Amazon next day air for half the cost.
---
Search for it in your asset window. Much faster.
---
Try all the things.
---
Do more of what you find fun.
---
If you want to make isk, exploration is pretty good. Note if you're in wormhole space, only go after the sites with the names of pirate factions in them ...
---
But keep your eye on fun/hour, not isk/hour.
---
So how do I find Level 1 missions? I'm currently in Akiainavas
---
Have you done the Sister's of Eve Epic Arc yet?
---
It's a storyline type set of missions that have you exploring each empire region of high sec and will net you some decent ISK.
---
After I mine Ore, should I sell the raw ore or refine it into minerals and sell those minerals? Which is more profitable, and so which should I do?
---
Killboards, ironically enough, stop people from doing that because the culture of eve is to haze for any and all loses.
---
