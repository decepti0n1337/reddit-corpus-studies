---
noone cares
---
---
---
To be fair the armour timer on this fair was fairly even all things considered not sure on exact numbers but believe there was only a few Titan difference in losses between the sides... the second fight was a mess for the defenders
---
Not really, when I'm offline my characters are playing Path of Exile.
---
My think : it s really better to play than being a follower :) lets try.
---
So you took a image of your own car
---
March 03, 2016 5 minutes before DT to be exact.
---
So true and good ;D upvote.
---
BUT : it s a clever moove atm for panfam because they cant compete now.
---
Nah.  My car isn’t this nice.
---
If the majority of players where flying AT ships absolutely but given seeing one is like getting killed by a unicorn, I don't see them as a massive issue right now.
---
It’s interesting how the reasons change every time. When I started, Eve was dying because lag was so bad that nobody could assemble real fleet fights anymore. Performance was apparently breaking down whenever more than a handful of ships were in one place. That was Empyrean Age or Apocrypha, I think? I never heard about it again after Crucible and TiDi.
---
Every generation of Eve players must face their own challenges.
---
NC gave up and made zero effort to contest anything beyond that first SH1 timer defense. Frat on the other hand in an equally bad situation has been doing just fine because they actually used their jammers and put up a defense.
---
But both sides had equal opportunity to be at this point. In fact, one side only a few short years ago were homeless on their asses, now they are the powerhouse. One saw an opportunity to prosper. The other side sat on their laurels and touted their past might, all while not maintaining their forces.
---
Evan and ARfuss are two different people, ARfuss hates Goonswarm and last I saw was flying tengus in an npc corp
---
No thanks not this time
---
Good too :)
---
You have seen too much matrix.
---
Whatever makes existance less depressing.  You do you.
---
There weren't rorquals and citadels and most important of all, thousands of krabs working day and night when Imperium tasted their bitter defeat three years ago
---
Casuals for sure. I have 200b and couldn't be bothered to do anything beyond casual. 
---
Cant do that outside goons.
---
But in all seriousness, if they immediately warp out of their anom when you jump into system, the odds are good that they are bot, if they reset soon after to the same anom the odds are pretty damn good that they are a bot
---
Another one
---
Plot twist, dronelands alliances are not actual players but CCP testing grounds for new ninja farming AI
---
That's what happens when alliance don't get free isk anymore, they quit.
---
Yeah pve suck a lot but you need it to pay your ship. Make pve as efficient as posdible et go take pleasure in pvp :)
---
No, not “right”. 
---
Fucking hate that. Quite saying that.
---
Username checks out
---
Is this worth turning my volume up for?
---
You mean you actually have to log in and do things in eve??? NC you sly ol dog you. You trolled me again.
---
&gt;during wwb ceptor prices were like 120m from the constant use from the imperium
---
So you're saying goons undocked more in WWB than NC is doing now?
---
It was really fun just shooting for an hour straight. Thx for dropping the caps btw!
---
It gets a little loud when the explosions go off.
---
Can I get the Cliff notes in this novel?
---
Lmao
---
I never said they were not fair I said unassailable wealth generation and that was broken.  If your not involved then why bother to comment?  The rest of these nerds seem to think the game is broken because the shoe is on the other foot.  This is what CCP intended.  They had no way of knowing that the other side was unable/unwilling/incapable of adapting.
---
Its highly exaggerated
---
[removed]
---
PL did this to themselves honestly.
---
Ahahahah
---
loool loved them
---
Why bother? It's reddit, what more to say? Well if we're going to talk about broken mechanics, rorqs are broken, upwell structures are also broken. Sound familiar?
---
People post when we bring too many people. People post when we don't take losses because blob. People post when take a fight and take losses. It's almost like INIT is hot topic!
---
The problem with combat actives is you will call in external entities to help fight with you which would be broken.
---
The only way that you will fix fw if it was a space only fw pilots could get in.
---
Anything other than that you right back where you are now.
---
I love the sound of what you trying to sell but unless they drastically change fw space and the mechanics to revolve around the factions fighting each other i can't see any big change.
---
Game ruined!
---
Where are there players gonna come from? 
---
No like seriously there isn't a source of players unless you get them from outside the game but that means you have to get people that are not playing eve to start playing eve.
---
Like even people that don't want to join goons at this point are in test like there isn't a market niche you can appeal to that will give you a winning hand.
---
So the idea in 2 years a new power will rise up there seem beyond silly.
---
funny how, when goons blue ball it's a strategic retreat, but when it's NC/PL they say they re pussies and don't want to fight because they actually think they are good.
---
We can sit here and blame goons, panfam, and ccp for this but the real culprit was global warming. We didn't listen!
---
With what money?
---
Yeah that's what I figured.
---
And where people were paid to be blue
---
I stay subscribed to this sub waiting for the news of certain game mechanic overhauls to unfuck the game.
---
Fat fucking chance. People would have to cooperate without being paid to.
---
TL:DR
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Might want to check your title, since when is 0.4 highsec?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Lamaa
---
Elite PVP'ers right there boyz!
---
Wasn't it Panfams fault that Test blued everyone? All I know is anyone but Test is to blame.
---
so whats the context of this vid?
---
At the very start of the game there was a floor on Tritanium because you could buy infinite shuttles and reprocess them.
---
To reply to both you and /u/henrygi here's what happened.
---
Tencent (Serenity partner) banned a prolific botter. Botter took it to court, and the court ruled they had to continue service as they could not prove it with the authority of the law. As you can imagine, gathering that level of proof and the prospect of going to court every time you need to enact a ban... essentially makes it impossible. They dont accept open termination of service--this is the part in most eulas that says your service can be cut off at any point.
---
From that decision it was essentially acknowledged that such behavior, already rampant, was free game and effectively legally sanctioned.
---
Pleasure to help^^
---
So you are waiting for a big chain of devblogs? I do too.
---
Take pretty much any large block. 
---
Legacy, Imperium, Panfam, Frat. They all die it. 
---
Goons and TAPI are just the ones who came out in top.
---
Started 2007. Was constantly told eve was in danger of shooting down. Really made a noob paranoid.
---
i remember the days where pyerite had more value than trit^^
---
When they can manage to launch any game otherwise for more than 10 minutes, it's the only thing I've got to go on lol.
---
Is this the same Redline from a couple of weeks ago where he tried to take some NC mini glory for his own, sounds like a right clown.
---
Christ.
---
So I've been more or less winning EVE for like 5 years. What's changed in the universe? What's the viable industry these days? Is FW still farmed to shit? Where's good solo and small PVP now?
---
If life was a game I would have rage quit long ago
---
Please post your nyx loss mail on reddit for us all to see.
---
You goons are so elite.
---
Sad to see this alliance go down, with the two main FC's stepping away from Eve.  What a shame.  
---
Lessons learned: 
---
- Becoming NS rent bosses is going to be boring for everyone, and people get burned out
---
- Eve isn't dead, but this style of play (NS renting) is boring as all get out, and is dead.
---
- Relying on 1-2 FCs for your content generation, is a guaranteed way to burn them out, and then have a dead alliance because nobody else will undock and go find content
---
- Another alliance bites the dust, and a new one will form.  o/!
---
Reported for violating rule number 11
---
Give it all to space china
---
I still remember md5 from when I’d hangout in y-mpw been a few years, good to see the same people still playing
---
It's not really neutral if FCs from major blocks or regional powers are allowed to use it for their personal purposes.
---
hey that was me!
---
&gt;Reeeeeeee
---
Opened BR and saw faxes and was like uh-huh
---
Eve has been dying since 2008. Since I started. When Vagabonds went 12k m/s .
---
At least they are pvping lmao
---
The butthurt is real itt
---
Is this the first time?
---
Big facts
---
For a second there I thought you were talking about my Corp. *whew*
---
even without injectors the folks who have been around for 10 years or more are all going to have the ability to fly caps and supers by now if they want them.
---
The PL ethos in a nutshell
---
Start of game, approx -
---
Trit 1
---
Pyerite 4
---
Mexallon 16
---
Isogen 64
---
Nocxium 256
---
Zydrine 1024
---
Megacyte 4096
---
NPC buy orders existed for the first month or so and they didn’t move hugely from those levels until after the first 6 months to year iirc.
---
He is just following the path of the greats. Like Elo.
---
He’s a pretty competent cap fc.
---
I was thinking of going to Jita now but it is a warzone this weekend.  lol  Players are even targeting frigates and corvettes.  People rarely target frigates in this game in high security space.  I guess I'll go to Dodixie instead.
---
In 5 years from now we'll hearing the same thing from some other pleb, literally 'eve is dying ' has been a narrative since 2003 
---
Also whoever put in the tldr thanks i wasnt gonna read that whole shit
---
He posts on r/eve?
---
Said the pubbie
---
True, bots will be sufficiently advanced by then to shitpost on their own.
---
Who?
---
TLDR: I need to take a shit so I'm not such a whiny bitch.
---
Ask FCON. haha
---
So if they fly a Vni and dont afk they are a bot 🤔 good logic
---
So you're trying to say that new people like me can't say or ask about what's happening in the game? if you didn't notice, the title of the post is actually a question and then opinion about what I see, but maybe your classist and poor mind is unable to understand that everyone can give good or bad opinions.
---
I miss the nanophoon
---
If your in highsec,  you're harbouring bots! If your in lowsec you are also harbouring bots. Do your part, quit eve
---
You guys, get out of home that much?
---
Track record of missing however many bots?
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
---
blue balls for the blue corner!
---
The irony in the model name of that car. While it can fit in most parking spots, most eve players would have to trim their neckbeards before getting behind the wheel.
---
Imho, good. That might make CCP realize that the current sov/citadel mechanics are a lame, bandaid fix way out. Entosis and DPS limits are TERRIBLE. Caps used to be for structure bashing. Bring that back and they have a real use again. Not just for yolo roflcopter dropping every sub cap you can find.
---
Smashing video!
---
Saturday at 4 am?
---
.... so 22 hour ago?
---
Or on the 22nd?
---
Please clarify this a bit more to avoid confusion :)
---
damn that scene, what movie is this from?
---
Would be cool to go back and see the impact of drone loot changes on prices across the game
---
Real useful stuff in a 1v1 eagle fight.
---
The Fit is somehow bigger on the inside. I'm not a small person and never have any trouble with it.
---
Plus, the amount you can cram into one of these things when you're moving or going camping is absurd.
---
Can't undock without a good Fit

---
Way to look like a retard
---
EVE will die because you lazy self-entitled turds really just want a lobby shooter with spaceships
---
You want the depth without the effort
---
&gt;TL;DR: Title is clickbait. EVE is not fun for PVP players who don't like its PVE content, OP is butthurt and rants.
---
As a notherner, it pains me to say this, but this is pure gold.
---
Oh, I like eve.. shame on me.
---
REEEEE!
---
Who needs to 1v1 when you can deepdick his allies
---
The very start of the game - I mean the very, very start, prices went up by powers of two, i.e. 1 (trit), 2 (pye), 4, 8, 16, etc.
---
i died laughing, have an upvote
---
Why? That sounds like a great way to experience a very expensive...delivery.
---
Thank you for all the discussion everyone it seems like things have changed quite a deal. Cool to know some people still remember.
---
Join just to gank/scram FC before fleet warping out
---
lol
---
I honestly regret backing that trash heap with $40.
---
I mean you sit in your mom's basement thinking about one day maybe fucking a chick - it's called hypotheticals. Noone thinks they would actually 1:1. But if they did, Mittens being able to FC caps is irrelevant. Man you're retarded.
---
Damn good odds does not equal a definite. That is the logic.
---
I am curious who is gonna move in and claim the systems
---
Except a player doing what they should be doing = a bot in your eyes.. So the only people who are not bots are stupid fucks, that's a poor level for judgement
---
Didn't get to party as long as I should have thanks to the military, but easily one of the best ran alliances I've ever been in, and a hell of a leadership/FC team for sure. o7 enjoy WoW
---
Same. Was nuts back then. I miss it.
---
great vid, as almost all of Flightleaders. Can we please get a tracklist here or on youtube?
---
WERE NOT LEAVING!!!
---
I think the original "eve is dying" thread was started on the eve forums only 3 days after the game was released.
---
It is, there are other steps that can be taken to fully determine, but if the pattern of action continues that way, I take the time to start filling the report and let CCP look over all the other data that I cannot see to determine the character's status as a bit or not.
---
Heard.
---
I edited my post to elaborate,  i will also preface I dont doubt there are bots, but i dont believe every Vni pilot is one
---
apologies will be in 2 hours tonight my time im western Canada it will be 9 pm for me
---
And even players who are on top of things don't trigger my bot radar, it's the characters that show repeated actions with no break in pattern that I file the report for, I only get one or 2 passes on the system before I have to move on so I am sure that I have reported some legit players.
---
sounds interesting could have been the alliance player in my chat when we did a few public events, he was talking about doing something for his alliance glad to hear it worked out sounded like a good night for eve :) cheers on yours o7
---
I guess the main difference then between me n a bot would be local chat because I'd happily converse,  but that is fading fast because people talk less n less these days,
---
also eve online my friend runs off the UTC time clock you can see it on the bottom left when your game is active cheers
---
also if you have any footage i would love to see it
---
And on top of that, some bots have chat capabilities.
---
Sometimes this goes hilariously wrong. But other times it can be really convincing.
---
That I didn't know, gees
---
I love Sir Grafo
---
I don't even know what kind of car that is.
---
imagine being such a spodbrain that you think barra and capqu mangaged the renters and that's why they quit
---
The main reason I personally don't report is sure you might get 90% bots but that 10% legit players I dont trust ccp enough to investigate properly history has shown they don't, also an average Joe has no recourse to appeal, so even if it's 1 in 50 or more you still could be banning an innocent without them ever having a chance to defend (this is purely a personal opinion)
---
Hey thanks for reply. I’ll ask around I’m fairly certain it was recorded 🤠
---
That date is July 30th, not June 30th.  Unless you're referencing another post a month before this one.
---
 The above logic may have been partially true 3 years ago. But it's simply invalid today. You are far beyond survival and self preservation. You are the 2nd strongest coalition in the game.
---
Keyword you used: 'fear'. This is what your leadership sells you.
---
People dislike TEST for peddling victim complex and it has been drilled so deep into you guys by your leaders that you kinda inadvertently did it too in your post without realizing it.
---
And again, your post  reaffirms the point that you guys simply have no ambition. Survival and self preservation isn't ambition, it's just the basic thing that you guys have achieved and are well far beyond it. If that's the only thing, there is then no difference between you and Sort Dragon.
---
We hardly knew ye
---
By "years ago" you're talking about at least 6-7+ years ago, because I can remember that there were massive fleets of doomsdays by then even.
---
i fucked up
---
... I am smart enough to know these are troll replies. I am also smart enough to know that goons have a recorded history of scamming people who tried to join.
---
I am ignorant enough however to *not* know what the actual requirements are. I assume a noob throwing a full API up would be enough... Yet, now I'm curious if there are other requirements beyond the painfully obvious.
---
weebs
---
Even with good passwords, it's data center leaks and poor datasec that is the real killer. Millions of passwords are sold on the dark web daily for nefarious reasons exactly like this. There have been some I sane lying large password leaks lately, which is likely where this access came from. 
---
They have entire Indian "call centers" dedicated to compromising as much of *your* stuff as possible. These are targeted attacks and they often get a few cents per account hacked. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
---
That's why it's so important to implement 2FA as a prevention method, because even if your password is gathered from a database leak, that password is only half the formula.
---
Yea, today there are only 2 places most likely where you will find content, Horde and Provi.
---
So you’ve listed a bunch of complaints, that’s a good first step. Now we need to create some objectives for CCP
---
In week 1 before they nerfed the spawns, there was a LOT heavier rats in adjacent &amp; foothold systems.  Now you indeed need some logis to face major conduits.
---
Branch
---
haha dude weed
---
As a Human player I do exactly the same thing when ratting.
---
But yeah, I don't rat 20 hours everyday.

Im on board,  have my upvote

I swear I see this guy's name everywhere; forums, r/eve, even in mails asking for 150 billion for his stupid afterburner bpo
---
loved this alliance
---
was amazing while it lasted

o7 fellas
---
YOU DARE LAUGH?!
---
I'm sorry you're a soft shelled cocksucker that doesnt confront obvious frauds? The site probably wouldn't be cancer if people got called on their shit more often.  Oddly Kugu never had a problem with bullshitters
---
I don't know who makes a fit or even wheat country. Sorry.
---
I know this isn't an answer but has anyone ever wondered if you're still "you" after you die and get cloned? For example, while all the data from your brain is copied over to a clone, and while that clone has all your memories and emotions, is that clone "you", or does is only appear to be you to other people? I mean, the exact moment that your consciousness is copied over, there exists two of "you", right? And then the original you is killed, and the new one walks around minding his own business. BUT HE'S A FAKE!

If it has local it’s hi-sec

Endgame is not titans.  Their market is too low volume.
---
I know a group of people passionately care about AT, I know some of them personally in game, including winners.  From everything I understand AT was maintained by a very small and very passionate group of CCP people. That seems to be the norm at CCP. Since the management structure sucks so much and the company is so poorly run it requires passionate people to keep anything going, including iteration, item balance and most importantly, economic health.   
---
As such I think players should be voting for CSM members and complaining to CCP not about individual problems, but the ongoing and worsening corporate culture. Shit, go over their heads and bitch to Pearl Abyss. At least we have a company we can complain to now instead of some investors.  
---
Last thing, why only follow EVE? If you like the idea of the game but don't play, tell us what keeps you from doing so.
---
Yes, but ARfuss is who created this thread. He has posted numerous threads like this recently and even admitted that it was him.
---
I like how you kept supporting with those constant jams. Great work and congrats!
---
Almost as bad as legit salesgirl
---
Cool video. Jammers OP. Was this guy a bot?
---
Lol "in the wild". This makes me want to buy a sticker like that.
---
When NCPL dominated EVE by supercap superiority, EVE wasn't dying. When goons do it, suddenly EVE is dying. 
---
It's not like we didn't try to warn you what was happening. We told you over and over, and only TEST listened. Now they're enjoying great prosperity and the stubborn north deploys to reddit to cry about the state of the game after becoming the victim of the same tactics they used on others for years. Truly elite.
---
Oh it's just an obvious timesink, I recently had free time for a few months and got into various games and while I'm sure I could have gotten into EVE, I had quite a few other games I wanted to try. My interest in pretty much every space-flight based game has ended when I turned out to be horrible at piloting... the meta of the AT is why I liked watching, it reminds me of some other MMOs though in that I like the theorycrafting more than the gameplay.
---
But hey I should definitely download it one of these days. I'm interested in making games and I love the combat in EVE, so that's probably what I would want to play for is to learn all the nitty gritty details by doing it.
---
10b for the afterburner

"Scientific speculation"....
---
Surprised I haven't seen the Kronos listed here yet.
---
I love the Megathron ship lineup, and the Kronos is my favorite of the lot.
---
My typical mission running fit is getting kind of stale though, so I've been testing polarized fits on Sisi.
---
That or the Marshal, but I haven't even fitted mine yet.
---
I've seen a decent amount of botting supers act like this. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They get caught, and do fucking nothing for as long as it takes until the owner of the bot comes back to turn off the program and do something about being caught botting.
---
USA and it’s a Honda.
---
The fuck??? So if a Chinese player bots, he gets off Scot-free, but if we do it- ban?
---
I can’t believe I never thought of that pun. It’s just right there, staring us in the face.  
---
+1.
---
I like how proud you guys are of dunking on 60 IQ spodbrains that die daily regardless of the supercap umbrella being up or not. I guess when the alternative is acknowledging you just lost 2 keepstars soon more, it's best to focus on the positive. Just keep reminding yourself you are elite. Just because you failed to adapt in every way imaginable, well, it's probably goons' fault somehow.
---
Only on serenity is botting allowed. On tranquility, CCP can ban them at their leisure, since theyre technically not supposed to be on there anyway
---
A nice way to solve the capital proliferation issue would be to make all capitals ship T2, not sure why haven’t been that way from the start considering JFs are T3, but it’d stop alliances just spamming rorqs in infinitely respawning anom belts to build capitals in bulk.
---
Looks like TEST killed him in the same spot 2 months ago. So maybe. They should visit him again in a few months.
---
True they should redesign it so you don't need to log in to win.

This is golden piloting, right here

Gotg is with Goons, skillu is folding and pandemic Legion is a ghost it's former self, but go on trying to act like nothing has changed at all.

As for the second I'll let you figure that out lol.

Wait what’s wrong with botting in serenity? Or well, why even bot there at all?
---
g*dbless

I never really enjoyed fleet stuff, but you always made it a lot of fun capqu.  Even though I don't miss much of this shit game, I do miss flying with you, dex, methea, and of course the most legit player in the game mark bridges.

Because NC. Could have done the EXACT SAME THING as GSF, they chose not to.
---
Bump it off the gate!

---
Rorquals are only broken in your eyes because it levels the playing field for a new character vs an older character.  I have heard many others say this about the rorq but their not using them,  can’t protect them because they don’t have the population density or the willingness to do so.  Rorquals die everyday even in Delve.    
---
Upwell structures your right they are broken damage cap sucks, timers suck, asset safety sucks but I don’t have the first clue how to actually balance that for everyone not just null sec players.
---
You want to talk about broken mechanics how do you feel about skill injectors and attribute boosters?
---
I wanted to drive by and yell ‘go back to Nita you scammer’.  But there was too much traffic to get next to them
---
You think that they would let anyone else see how much moneys they were making? I bet that barra guy bought a new tractor with all the money the made! At least the mittani will expose this filthy RMT alliance when no-on else will!
---
Sure, anything that helps prevent capital ships from being spammed, what about the people that just want to enjoy the game? I guess they are just shit should just stop laying eve and have less people playing it. Then we can officially admit to everyone that we are a real sandbox.

Eve 2 or just "Providence". Community run and all 0.0 space.

I have been enjoying the game for 14 years I’ve played high sec,  low sec, incursions, wormholes you name it when null sec politics bother you to a point of agitation it’s time to go play something else. Or do something else in the game. When I first started playing BOB owned Delve and you could travel thru huge swaths of null sec and never see another sole.  When I would log in there might be 600 people logged in for the AU time zone.   Eve is a real sandbox has been since it’s conception.  I have and continue to enjoy it no matter what side I’m on.
---
Is Spectre fleet getting paid for this campaign? It always felt kinda weird (and much drama ensues usually) when these public fleets pick their targets depending on who pays them.
---
So yeah, if you get paid by someone, don't cry about spy alts, awox etc.
---
If you want more players then I suggest we get CCP to focus on the real cradle of EVE and that’s high / low sec.  Not everyone who starts to play this game wants to go to Null.  The tutorial could be better,  it’s a lot better than I had and we could start being a little less toxic to each other.   At the end of the day CCP is not killing EVE we are.
---
No longer get a fre (1) tritanium in a free corvette. CCP trying to stabilize the market.
---
Back when I started playing it was BoB that was killing the game then later on it was goons killing the game a little bit later it was NCPL killing the game and now it's goons again.
---
I am starting to think no one has any idea what is and isn't killing the game not even CCP.
---
Why do you do this
---
oof imagine dying to these plebs lmao
---

---
Typical spod brain that only knows what his leadership tells him.
---
I'd have to disagree.
---
Grinding League is worse than playing Eve.
---
At least the people in Eve are relatively nice and not running it down mid in promos because you told them to ward river.
---
I like how proud you guys are dunking on 500m isk of T1 destroyers that die against a cap fleet. I guess when the alternative is acknowledging to  have lost trillions in supers and rorqs so far in your own home, more to come, it’s best to focus on the positive. Just keep reminding yourself that by joining an already established group like Goons, proud on on the premise that makes you elite and worthy of all its achievements.
---
What  a fucking idiot you are posting this shit on a thread created by one of your own.
---
Even before those things happened it wasn't everyone vs. test. Somehow vily seemed to forget he was allied with the biggest coalition in the game.

Your spin is sad. No one believes you. You don't matter.

Same.  But in entirely different circumstances.

Depending on region u can try gas huffing and drug manufacturing or get into bigger ships.for.pvp. there's lots of stuff

Man do I miss mining in a thorax then a megathron, and man did you used to have to put in a lot of work to afford a battleship
---
Well said
---
Citadels changed, no idea about indy, FW is farmed but also has decent fights, and provi is good for roaming around
---
no, u
---
Do you have a reading comprehension deficiency?
---
What most sane people do when a game has devs that thinks everyone wants to rorqual mine is, they just play something else. You think its a sandbox, but when people can't even roam around with out having supers and titans blobbing them to oblivion, it gets boring. I'm not sure you don't get it, if the game becomes boring, people simply stop playing. I've seen too many people leave because the game is BORING. Not even skill disbanding makes you bat an eyeball?
---
I played a game for years called Anarchy Online, people also claimed it was dieing forever.
---
I believe the servers are online, but the game has gone to complete shit in every way and I quit playing it like 9 years ago (switched to EVE).
---
Tldr; online games may never truly die even though they really should.
---
That sounds like there was a game breaking problem, which may have killed the game but was fixed instead...

One of the best alliances i was in. No longer in the alliance but the game is a lesser place without a group like skillu.
---
Since lowsec died.
---
Horde: quick entry, quick turn over, although I'm sure there are people on horde for a long time its notorious for its turn over, it provides moderate levels of support with minor mentoring
---
Brave: quickish entry, low turn around you'll likely make good friends,  but their skill and scope are limited and usually people grow out of it and move on,
---
Karmafleet: long entry time, low turn over, once you are in however you receive very good support and mentoring,  free ships and ship replacement isk from both alliance and the corp so you make isk by joining fleets and dieing, cons is the rest of the game dislikes goons,  however most of the game is a goon so you get embraced as a.family by them instead hated by everyone else

There is now a significant likelihood that eve is going to die. Unless you love casinos.

Go have a look where Slyce used to live in Deklein.  VNI bots for days.
---
I have had times in the 14 years where I have been bored and I’ve always managed to find something else high/low  sec missions even null sec missions in stain led to me finding friends who wanted to play the same way I did.  DED sites, cosmos missions running static plexes getting my ass handed to me by the guys camping them. Incursions, exploration the list goes on.  My point, it’s not up to CCP to find you something to do that’s up to you.  If you look around long enough I’ll bet there is something in this game you haven’t tried yet.  As far as getting blobbed there are a whole line of ships that have covert oops cloaks that can be bridged that are very fun very powerful with the right comp can damn near take down anything.   As far as skill urself goes they are not the first group who has disbanded nor will they be the last.

One of the last publicly sold ones was by me, hehe
---
Came expecting vince rage, left disappointed.
---
I imagine it would be easier for everyone for them to just contract you some bookmarks occasionally when they're in station to get new missions. You'll want to figure out 25% of *what* (Jita buy probably?), and if you're doing this a lot it might be easier to just have a fixed rate per site so they can make out the contract to you with the isk already in that contract.
---
I'd personally be tempted to combat probe them, get my own bookmark, and skip paying the 25% though.
---
this is so good
---
that was fun, and prizes was awesome, just too bad it wasnt me who got em

Just use a throwaway Magnate until you have more experience. You're gonna die a few times before your paranoia ramps up to the required level.

HTP was literally created to try and hold sov for spectre fleet when NC. invaded provi many years ago.
---
HTP started as a spectre fleet alliance.
---
You talk as if I never tried everything? Did you ask if I did? I have tried it all. Been playing since 2007. Maybe its the case of me becoming a bitter vet, but the reality is that pvp is slowly becoming unfun. Cov ops? Why even do that when people can just drop cynos and have a shit load of supers and fax to save them? Want to evict someone? It takes ONLY three weeks on autz to bash that astrahus. Lets forget the fact someone can just anchor one in 24 hours and repeat the process. have you seen the fleet fights? Its always who can outform the other side. No real fights happen anymore on the high fleet level. Small  gang pvp is dying, and that should concern all of us.
---
When a REAL pvp alliance like skill disbands with the reason being "the game isn't fun and there isn't anything for us to do." there is a real problem with the state of the game.
---
We took sov when CCP killed blops
---
So no not really, we are dead inside...
---
That was also during the golden age of MMOs when you could play WoW, Age of Conan, EVE, and Guild Wars and all games had tons of players.
---
EVE isn't dying per se, the MMORPG market is as older players are moving on with their lives and younger players dont have the patience and will to play games that require a huge time investment. Its why even the top-dog of MMOs, WoW got heavily casualized and caters to the instant gratification crowd.
---
r/unexpectedfirefly
---
&gt;Why should CCP give the community nice things
---
Because it's literally their job?
---
He's the dude that caught the 8 nyxes in Omist and cracked that whole thing open. Pretty sure STU MINER kinda knows what he's doing.
---
Yup can confirm about Karma. It can take ages to get in, but once youre in, youre in. Ive also witnessed an FC be mean to a newbee Karma member (due to miscommunication) which led to alliance leadership coming straight into command channel and basically scolding the guy.
---
If not for shortsightedness, CCP would have no sightedness at all.
---
Congratz guys, you bowed out with style.
---
kind of fits the theme of the place really.
---
Karmafleet has a lot more safety than the others, and better SRP, but it has a really long recruitment process compared to the others. 
---
Brave I don't know too much about, apparently they were good for small scale content but in my experience they are very blobby, even compared to the ramjags that PH likes to have, and they drop a lot of supers on everything too.
---
Pandemic Horde I obviously think is best, as you can tell by my flair, it does have a lot of good content in geminate, just from the dotlan numbers you can tell we have more happening than Brave, and way more than karmafleet. The downsides are that our easy recruitment means we have a bit more spies than karmafleet/brave, although most of the time they aren't a problem unless you're flying around really blingy stuff and get predictable. The other downside is we don't have as good SRP as Karmafleet, again I don't know much about brave so idk how their srp is.
---
Other than that they're all pretty similiar
---
INIT went downhill when they recruited the sweaty armpit raiders lmao
---
Filthy casual.
---
There's a reason why we have KiloAlpha's Rag kill in our corp description
---
Either find a market that will guarantee-buy things from you (a null sec alliance), and mass build at profit (for example orders for 100s of tech 1 ships, where you make a little money from each hull). 
---
Or start your own capital ship construction business. This is like the ultimate thing and requires many other things to be successful. 
---
You probably dont want to be building supers and titans unless you have many many billions in cash (problem is those hulls can sit there for a while waiting for buyer and you dont want to have dozens of billions being trapped unless you have 100s more to invest).
---
Easy now, didn't you hear that he killed MoA? Dont want him to kill ORGNC too now, do you?
---
The difference is that even when we blueballed specific battles, we still undocked in between.
---
Haha oh also before he joined Init his corp was our go to to get spies into GotG.  We actually had spies in his corp long after they joined init.
---
I used a sweaty armpit raider spy to awox a rorqual once and the toon is still in alliance, like hello!
---
Yup we tried warning Bliss but it fell on deaf ears.
---
lol always next time i appreciate all who came to the event was alot of fun
---
More titan pilots mate. Bliss' original INIT died long ago.
---
Funny but untrue lol. It hit a high peak, then declined a little bit while still having a large playerbase and plateuing.
---
Like with minecraft. Its still popular, the lets plays have just died down a little. (Though successful minecrafters still remain.)
---
ah, got it
---
yeah being meanspirited to newbees is the easiest way to no longer be a goon.
---
NC/PL should prob learn from Frat who is actually putting up a fight instead of fleeing or destroying their own shit for insurance fraud.
---
Plot Twist: NC. moves to Serenity.

No more "*@everyone x if your about*" to save my shitty day :-(

Sell a little bit of the plex that you do have enough isk for the broker fees and use that to cover selling the rest of it.

Because there are enough idiots that fall for it every day that it's probably one of the easiest ways to make isk in the game.

I just roam in Provi, I’ve been blobbed/baited a few times,  but Hecates are very good at running away and only taking decent fights, so unless I get impatient I usually do well. Don’t see why there’s even a point to roaming drones/delve, or really most of New Eden, unless you have a big fleet with scouts or are going to hotdrop. Even Brave likes to drop supers on fights in catch sometimes, although they aren’t anywhere near as bad as the rest.
---
Cluster Fuck Coalition
---
i was about to comment on that, don't know if they could have done  much when we dropped 350 titans and few hundred subcaps on those KS kills, except feeding free kills.
---
Cloaky camp them for a few days straight while doing nothing. Eventually they’ll whitelist you and ignore you. Then see how long they rat and check how good their reaction times are to neuts in local. You can never say for sure but that can give you a good idea
---
Whah?
---
LOL partially true.... 2016 living in WC to getting crushed by Panfam Supers in Tribute regardless of TEST's subcap numbers. 2017 harassment campaign by Panfam (without supers) to stunt TEST's growth that took 8 months to squash... 2018 was the year TEST shined but still not quite at the North's lvl, they needed help from goons.  2nd Best at what lvl??? Legacy beats Panfam in terms of Numbers, and Economy, FC talent-debatable. But lets get real, SUPER numbers are and have been the real measure of strength of alliances in EvE. An area where Legacy is catching up but not matching Panfams 350+. It was that Keyword 'FEAR' of Panfam's supers that drove TEST south to build a super fleet bigger than past aggressors. If you think Legacy alone has the capability to match Panfam in a X-47 style scenario then it is you who is delusional.
---
Alliance members who whine on reddit and don't wanna play the game the way its meant to be played because they had it easy in the past don't have ambition.

was really fun and a lot of different T1 hulls showed up, really cool

i hope there will be more events with more participants! but i think some ppl got confused with the time - it was sunday 16th 4am eve time

He has goons as controlling multiple regions of NPC nullsec as well as a bit of Jovian space, and also has them in complete control of Tribute and invading Vale, when in reality Tribute hasn’t completely fallen.

The game is what you make of it. Just last night we had a subcap brawl in lowsec with horde and 3rd parties, almost 300 folks on grid, tidi and stuff. No supers were used. Then, PVE is not about ratting or mining. Personally i do escalations from ratting, and i'm running almost all combat sites which can be scanned down. Just yesterday i made 1 bil in few sites dropping deadspace modules. Then, when i get bored, i roam into wormholes and search for drones, unanchoring structures to steal, catching miners and what not. The other night i was too bored to get into some big fleet, a few of alliance folks started a small gang roaming fleet / gate camp in hostile space. It was a lot of fun, no doctrine for ships. Go huff some gas in lowsec, make some drugs, sell them, make money, buy ships , explode them. I have an alt which i use when i do other things and not focusing the game, he's a station trader. Made in 2 days 400 mil with 200 put into faction ammo, PI and stuff. So, where is Eve dead ? Yes. Maybe there is a lot of room for improvement, not all players can be pleased but overall there is a lot of PVE. 
---
Triglavian invasions, lorewise, it's only at the beginning, that's why you see "Minor Conduits" because they will get bigger. For some reason this is the only MMORPG where players do not have **PATIENCE** for an extended lore into the actual gameplay.

Cool vid

I remember blocks of ice went for a million each.
---
Do x, accumulate wealth, get bored, go inactive.

The serious answer is: make friends, get into PVP, discover a whole new world of possibilities. Wealth accumulation is the actual endgame of EVE, because that's where the game ends for a lot of folks.

No. You didn't. You holed up in saranen for months.  The biggest doctrine you actually undocked was interceptors.

Population density + general density means there's always somebody to scam.

na... let me tell you something you dont understand. There are men out there men like me that will play as long as the server is online or im dead. I will piss moan and shit on CCP as they try to kill it but i will keep logging in and making the best of it. understand that, understand im not alone in this type of crazy and learn.

you could simply fiddle with a clonebay and make sure the branburn scanner doesnt take the quantum snapshot of the brain so it doesnt get sent through the fluid router system and place the conciousness back to the next clone.

but since this question was never touched by the game lore, i think the jovians were smart with that. i think theyd make sure theres a hardsafe to ensure the burn only makes it to a workable clone.

let me quote some classics:

Well, at least we undocked and traveled 25 jumps for this fight and don't know if CVA stayed, i just heard from FC "do not shoot muninns, are friendly". and then puff, they warped away didn't see any neutrals on grid or blue.
---
Then we realized we were fighting 2 fleets at once. Eagles/Lachesis on one side, Machariels on the other and we bailed. This was INIT fleet, not sure about the others. See you next time tho. 
---
Tidi was bad even in potato mode with 64bit client with only 600+ players in the system at some moment. Maybe lowsec systems are not dynamically scaled on big fights on the servers ? (CCP ?)
---
Anyway, it was a good fight, without supers and shit.
---
Eve is obviously playing the long game when it comes to dying. Typical.
---
But if they're going to be leaving their capsule, they're going to have a backup saved.

Been on first fleet ever, as logi with streamfleet, doing some low invasion stuff. Was a real pleasant evening and great finally just trying doing stuff with people.

Just another way for Goons to get inside your head.

Right next to Jita. Should be on your overview. The big fuckoff station  you'll see on the Jita gate has the cheapest broker fees.
---
At the beginning Eve was dying because all the good null sec (with Npc or capturable stations) had already been taken and only the bad empty areas remained.
---
1. Train industry
---
2. Check eve map, see where most ship kills are on a given period. Go to zkillboard, find a brawl (the best are the ones between big alliances) or check popular FW systems.
---
3. Check what doctrine they are flying on lost ships. Focus on ammo and rigs.
---
4. Produce that in decent amounts, move them closer to a NPC station closest to where the staging is at higher cost.
---
5. Same mindset applies for station trading but with that you can skip step 4 instead: buy low sell high.
---
Do you mean assembly plan at moon v?

No, you're gonna look for the system called Perimeter. Right click in space, hover over stargates, hover over Perimeter, then click the jump button.

And yet they Helidicked anyone they could and told anyone they could to adapt or gtfu...The poaching may have come a little later than when I left the game but I still had friends in the game and it was remarked about. So excuse me if my timeline was off a little bit. Doesn't change the fact that they used to throw the adapt or die at everyone and now they didn't practice what the preached so it has come back to bite them.

Rorq_alt thanks you for that precious info!

well imagine it like this
---
(this may sound pretty joe rogan have you tried DMT but its actually pretty close to what is happening)
---
those two hydrogen atoms are ripples in a foam of projected fields of certain fundamental energy. like a state between positive and negative and all between. its all like that, every particle, every charge, even the bending of spacetime. imagine the foam 'stretched over' everything, and putributions of this foam form in many, many different dimensions, like vibrating ripples at a certain frequency. those hydrogen atoms, and all atoms, everything in the universe, is all setup like this. a certain type of pertributions gives it this set point. this structure. this charge and energy levels and electron orbitals and spin and mass and quarks set the stability of the atom with its nuetrons and yada yada.
---
now when these pertributions in so many different ways interact with eachother, they all interact in very complex ways (this is where quantum mechanics comes into play). that complexity arises more and more to give something completley unique in its configuration. scale those petributions up by about trillions of magnitudes and you have the network of nuerons and cells that allow your brain to function. that complex state, which is configured solely as yours, is unique. the structure of your brain is *quite litteraly etched from the elongation and structural formation of the cells growing and dying and responding to the stimulus of your outside interactions. your genetics and your body and your mind and what you precieve guide the nuerons to form a structure that only your experiences in life could ever actually construct, given no previous template, and these complicated forms of energy states of all those particles act like a 3d (and more dimensions) spatial computer, responding to chemicals released in your brain, enzymes, charge states of compounds, it is entirely complex and unique*
---
 you can try to simulate its every bit of complexity of course, but again, the complexity is created by *your own experiences prior*. its important to really try to grasp the biological aspect of this. how are your memories formed and stored? how does the brain work?
---
 
---
(now we will go back down in scale and think from more complex to less)
---
you can deduce this to a particularly unique structure and composition of compounds, and the energy state of those, which can be determined as a multitude of quantum states. If you can take a snapshot of all those energy states, you can now take that unique complex bundle of *universe multi dimensional ripples* and replicate it at a different place of the universe, a bit of ripples formed percisely for the *exact complex interactions of ripples which made those quantum states in the first place*. 
---
after all, we are the universe, so the conciousness is part of it.
---
that sounds like an acid trip but its pretty close to the truth, your brain is a unique bundle of complexity and interactions of matter, which have their own rules of energy and field state etc from the various fields in quantum field theory.

funny that ncpl predecessors were pro goon anti bob back then
---
Bumping is frowned upon IRL. GMs will ban repeat offenders.
---
Didn't know of this..... But market tax apply on it tho?
---
At the last possible second too. My heart was racing just watching!
---
Well, you're a poopy head.
---
No need to. Goons Test, and CCP are happily colluding in creating Serenity right here.
---
Or create a debuff to affect anyone in a fleet that's within a certain distance to one another--some kind of cognitive dissonance affect that lowers raw damage output and / or mitigation. If it's serious enough that might help leverage smaller outfits against 400 man blobs.
---
I can live with that. Join Amarr Militia, we will make a man out of you

Awesome video, what a sendoff o7

As a returning player having had a break for around 5 years, I would say eve isn't necessarily dying, but it is... different.  Titans used to be a relatively rare sight, yet the other day my 2 man Caracal roam got hotdroped by an erebus.  The new stations are better than the old pos's in most ways, but there needs to be some tweaking of the mechanics to make the game play more interesting.  To me, the biggest issue is the rorqual.  This should never have been made into a superhulk and should have been kept as a mining gang support platform.  So much would be improved in the game if these things were nerfed.

Did I go in a hot tub time machine??

is this 2015 when killing a single super was noteworthy
---
Wouldn't it be possible to take 2 regions and farm one in the first month and the other in the second one? So every region can regenerate over a month while you farm the other region?
---
I think he means the Tranquility Trading Tower, that's a Keepstar Citadel.
---
Your wrong about goons if you only have one cap/super your bad and poor or really new
---
This time for realZ though
---
Sales tax applies on immediate sales but only after the sale is made, so it won't stop you liquidating PLEX.
---
Working as intended?

if you don't know the answer with that ticker please change it.

Click the small icons above the search bar that match the icons next to the thing you want to minimize. You cant move or minimize the search bar, its pretty lame.

Possibly the most boring vid I've seen.  Why do people keep thinking these shit zooming in and out stupid music vids actually are cool..
---
Mmm ... I think a proportional number of low sec and WH systems would be nice for variety and those rebels that wish to resist the glory of Provi.
---
Yeah, but we had July activity numbers in April this time.
---
skillu was a testament that the non-retarded could beat eve if a lot of effort was put in
---
shit i need to change which rock im mining
---
you were  lucky, i roamed for almost 3 hours and didn't see anyone except one guy in a Loki with a very very very bad killboard.
---
Yeah, first 0.0 alliance I was in was Vertigo Coalition in Aridia and Fountain and we were fighting Xelas Alliance who were friends/pets of BoB ^^ Too bad all my old killmails disappeared with Battleclinic :/
---
is that what station containers do? oh man, i'm going to build all the boxes!
---
 Do you mind sharing your für? Flying the Hecate lately and wanted to dip into the other ones :)
---
Odd. I remember flying other ships
---
150 B for the 10MN Afterburner II BPO ?
---
Is that a joke ?
---
Even by making it producing 24/7, it would take 160 months to compensate. 13 years.
---
I will offer 24 B for said BPO, and this is already a generous offer at it requires more than 2 years to get the money back.
---
How the fuck is it on top on my main and on the bottom on my alt lmfao
---
basically do anything you like to have ISK and replace ships you want to fly/explode. I was krabbing and mining for some time, now i want to be a drug lord and produce boosters.
---
hahahaahaha nice 1!!!!1!
---
idk why NANCY DOCK dosent UNDOCK and feed us????
---
They had overcome their fear of undocking however after some set backs couldn’t seem to pop the tether out and relapsed into docking.  So we RF’d that one too.
---
fuck i wish i was able to fleet up as much as you guys and bash some structures
---
this deployment is really fun!! 
---
eve 2019 FTW!!!
---
Did they forget to arm their Astra? lmao
---
We got some kills on structures and Nc and horde before they docked
---
I guess so it never fired a single shot at us.  Probably removed the fittings to save their killboard.
---
awesome, keep up the good work!
---
they will be sorry for not mining and putting in the hard work to get more titans :)
---
In 2017 I had all but quit Eve.  Then skill urself came and breathed new life to the game, pushing down icons and shaking up some old, stagnant parts of the game.  Any PvP game thrives of conflict and dies without it; like many others, I'll get into hibernation for now until a new power arises out of the blue and disrupts the New Eden world order again.
---
Thank you, skill urself o7
---
The hilarious thing is that if they, for once, stopped caring so much about their ~elite kb stats~ that are based on some third party service, then they would actually pose a threat. :shrug emoji:
---
guess it's the price you pay for being elite, being risk averse as fuck
---
I would start with your faction's T1 exploration frigate (or a heron. Caldari for life). You will make all the classic explorer mistakes a few times and get ganked, and it's better to be ganked for 5m than 50m.
---
Exploration fits come in two categories, ones with warp core stabs to escape tackle, and ones with nanofibre/istabs to dodge tackle. I fit the second way because the sensor strength penalties of WCS make exploration really annoying.
---
You need to fit:
---
High: Cloak, probe launcher
---
Mid: MWD (to burn between cans), hack mod (maybe both, or one and a depot), cargo scanner
---
Low: WCS or nano
---
Your no 1 priority as omega should be Cloaking. Then train into covops.
---
You can also carry a mobile depot and a PVP fit - Asteros can be fit to be pretty scary to PVE frigates.
---
can you warp to them? always wondered if you could use them to travel quickly for making safes

I really enjoyed watching this.
---
Damn that changes everything, what a bunch of pussies for not fighting 70 vs 320
---
Noice
---
And here I thought elite PVPers liked fighting outnumbered.
---
And this is basically the problem with anomaly PVE - it's so low intellect and low effort that it becomes impossible to tell the difference between a bot and a player, because what a player has to do is so simple.

Interesting point, but the sov upgrades would go offline during that month. With this system any solar system should at most be able to support ( benefit of local sov upgrades * number of nullsec PvE'rs / number of systems * average benefit of sov upgrades ) (benefit of sov upgrades would be how much more likely a system is to spawn sites due to upgrades). That is, if I did the math correctly.  
---
Currently, the 50 largest alliances in nullsec have a combined number of nearly 173k characters. Let's pretend there are 173k characters PvEing in nullsec in total. Let's assume that the highest site spawn multiplier will be x8 for a military 5 upgraded system as well. Since a lot of people dislike what Goons are doing in Delve I'll be using Delve as an example: Delve has 85 claimable systems, the entirety of nullsec some 2700 or so (did a quick look through regions on Dotlan, so mistakes could've been made). Now assume that all of Delve has the military 5 upgrade for extra anomalies. Delve should be able to support a maximum of 25% of all of nullsec, provided nobody else rats and sites despawn just as quickly as in Delve (which wouldn't happen). So up to 44k characters.  
---
However, if we assume all other systems would have an average sov benefit multiplier of 3 (which in the Python script I made to model this is slightly below military 2) Delve should only be able to sustain around 14.5k characters. Adding Querious and Period Basis raises this to just over 37.5k characters, which is less than GSF + Init. I think it might work, but it could be too costly to implement because of [legacy code](https://i.imgur.com/Iqy3lny.png).

Than I am silly person with silly ideas... OR my plan to garden grow bad guys in place of those who are too chickenshit to fight back is going to be the thing that brings more people into the game.
---
who are those Ehefkae guys?
---
This sounds like a really fucking stupid thing to do, but it's probably what happened.
---
Iono, I think that argument is pretty fucking shit given their history of dropping supers and farming small alliances right off their staging station undock for weeks at a time.
---
Being overwhelmed by a greater force (either in numbers or strength) is unfair if it happens against NC. (or PL, or HK, or whatever other "elite" alliance), right?
---
Butt hurt much?
---
&gt; Is there any corps out there that are friendly, welcoming to Alpha  players, and dont mind taking a noobie out rating/pvping sometimes? 
---
It really strongly depends on what you are looking for in EVE. As people mentioned below, a lot of the big Null blocks take basicly any player, but if that is not what you are looking for, than going there would not do you any good enjoying the game. When looking for Corps try to be a bit more specific. Ratting and PvP is done in plenty of Corps, from High to Wormhole Space. FW is a nice place to learn solo/small gang PvP, Null is big blop Fleets and in both Alpha players can find a place. 
---
&gt; Any good go to guides on how to be the best alpha possible? 
---
Not a guide persay, but some advice. With the 5Mil Skillpoint Softcap, try to focus on what class of ship with one, or two weapon systems at max. Idealy, skill into a ship that both is viable in PvP &amp; PvE -&gt; Gallente/Caldari Shipline, Cruiser, Battlecruiser or Battleship. 5Mil Skillpoints can be enough to fly one shipline very well, and you should take that into account when choosing your skills.
---
As much as skill u are a pain, mad respect for what they achieved. Shook the game up completely, totally uprooted many alliances and simply disposed of them.
---
I hope the null blocs keep their filthy hands of skill u's space so that smaller groups can start to grow and shape the future of new Eden there.
---
If NC./PL made reddit threads about them dropping supers on a 5 man caracal roam or a solo battleship they would rightly be called retarded. 
---
If Goons made reddit threads bragging about them having 5-10x more numbers than the defenders they also rightly get called retarded.
---
Yea, you could make crazy deep safes, did they filter out old sun bounce BMs?
---
I posted the Vice article for the human element in which non-IT people could relate and see the possible impacts.

Webpages: Perhaps you would prefer to hear it from [a well recognised hacker](https://youtu.be/YDW7kobM6Ik)? When you load a web-page, you run code, what that code does and what vulnerabilities it can exploit have a truly massive scope.

I don't remember the other key talk to this conversation, it was a little bland but the most salient point they made was, "Security devs need to try and close all ways into a system. Hackers only need **one** way into it."

(He shut down the Icelandic power grid, lost his own connection, got scared, his dad dragged him over there to tell them what he had done, the lead system admin's response was, "Cool! This has been driving me nuts for awhile. Can you tell me how you did it?")

it's almost as if you've missed the entire point of the thread.
---
it's not about fleet numbers, it's about one of the biggest and most storied entities in the history of the game rolling over and taking it up the ass while offering absolutely no resistance while trying to pretend it's not happening.
---
titans can easily wreck a kikimora fleet with rapier+lachesis and some faxes
---
I personally like PL and such but, right now ... you need to shut the F up and go shoot someone.
---
He never did say that the way you mean lmao, you people cut that line out of context to further a narrative.
---
My spin is sad, because I'm not spinning at all, no one needs to believe me because they can see this for themselves (if they actually want to), and saying someone doesn't matter in an internet spaceship game is cringe.

And stopping them from pretending it’s not happening.

Fundamentally, I understand what you're saying. But as a human with a sense of self, no doubt it can be hard to swallow that your entire being and consciousness are but particles quivering inside the machine that is your body and that as special as you think your thoughts and memories have made you, you are anything but. Furthermore, in my personal opinion, I find it incredibly hard to imagine how some particles, acting and interacting in just the right way forms literal consciousness. The rational part of me understands it, but the emotional part of me doesn't. I suppose, in a way, that's what religion and gods and beliefs are for.
---
Maybe combine with some others, find some group to rent from, then take that space once you're ready? Edge your way into some space? Start growing and get some good numbers and start making content. You're going to have to take what you want, no one will give it to you.
---
It's pronounced e HEFF kah, and they are previous members of TLC an old C4 corp.

Not sure, they did remove bookmarks inside planets for sure though. Those used to make you impossible to scan.
---
From what I've heard, you used to be able to scan down probes at one point.
---
On the hull. :)

np m8
---
You are a moron. You have 0 view of a bigger picture or any other gameplay then your own then.
---
Honestly I don't see the whole payment thing to be half as relevent in today's age, people wouldn't really need to be payed to go after goons if there was any momentum against them if we still had fozziesov. Money is practically infinite for all nullsec groups nowadays, but the amount of effort required to attack anyone who can fight back is pretty absurd.
---
You'd have another 3 year war to crack fortress Delve even if people stood a chance, and there just aren't enough no-life leadership folks willing to undergo that autism.
---
If renting would go away most of active eve could easily own a piece of null and thrive in it. But how would you stop big groups from coming and razing your structures for the "fun" of it not really sure. Not that renting is going anywhere...
---
Sadly the worst condoned part of eve.  Needs to be stopped not a place for it anymore..
---
&gt;Eve is starting to become dull and lifeless.
---
what the fuck are you talking about?
---
literally the entire of nullsec is at war right now. the problem is, "war" in eve is just fucking boring and tedious. 
---
the game isn't lifeless, it's just that the life it has is basically the same as that bloke down the road called norman who is in his late 40s, unmarried, lives alone, and collects stamps. it's completely dull, and you kinda want to put him out of the misery you can see plastered across his face every time you make polite conversation with him when you walk past his house as you take the dog for a walk.

yeah, and did you actually read the article?  
---
&gt;While still in the ‘planning phase’, Lenny was capitalising on even more mistakes the Mittani and his Goons were making. When the Imperium invaded low-sec space (where NPCs own the space but players can ‘farm’ the moons) many pundits agreed they did so simply out of boredom. But the move infuriated and galvanized the usually splintered groups of pirates in that particular sector. Lenny took notice.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Then the Goons established [a “Viceroy” system](https://www.themittani.com/news/imperium-announces-viceroyalty-system), demanding tithes and loyalty from their conquered regions, incensing the pirates even further. Lenny reached out to five of these brigand groups with the same bucket of cash he was using to conscript his mercenaries. The space bucaneers, who were already beginning a *parley* with one another, looked at his money and smiled. Yet more pieces of Lenny’s plan were in place. It was time to strike.  
---
&gt;“I had smaller groups hit the null-sec regions that bordered Imperium space. I had TISHU and The Culture hit Fade and Cloud Ring – \[which is\] SMA \[Space Monkeys Alliance\] space. I had Chaos Theory and OOS hit Venal. So I had four fronts open…
---
  
---
so far from not being mentioned, there are two paragraphs about it, specifically identifying it as the starting point for the war and lenny's offensive. why don't you just admit you're wrong and shut up
---
I'm sorry to see this kind of post again and again...
---
There was some good fight around SH1 today, and amongst the shitton of goons trashtalk in local, some of you gave us "gf", so i guess not all goons are retarded like you are.
---
Almost makes me wish to come back...
---
Sexy af fight though
---
I've been on a year and a half break, I came back a few times with my characters in Alpha and I've noticed pretty much all the old solo youtube PvP'ers are retired. Most solo / small gang PvP is dead.
---
this is a bad thread.
---
Thanks for pinging your friends and calling that downvote brigade. Took you a while.
---
You dropped supers on my solo ratting myrmidon 5 years ago, I've waited 5 years to make this thread. Now NC. and PL will face the full humiliation I felt when I got laughed at for having a small hull repairer and a shield recharger on my battlecruiser. 
---
FUCKING OWNED LMAO
---
It would be sick for the game if the drones were left as a wildwest of small groups but let's be honest there's no chance NCPL and Frat won't gobble up those free systems for more bot-powered income, or to make a rorqual haven in some aids corner of the dronelands.

Not to mention that there are common patterns people use for their pin code swiping, much like people using "Password123"

Well... I was just making a joke. Considering that the OP was a joke picture after all. But if you ask me. Test and Goons ain't exactly attacking each other right now. So... some might argue that they might as well be considered blue.
---
Rorq and capital rebalances massively hurt the game. When I got my Hel and started super ratting it was relatively easy to make 1+ bil in a couple of hours after work, run havens, on pure bounty isk it's 180/hour, I normally stopped when I got a dread or titan spawn, sometimes only took me two hours.  
---
Citadels are "Okay." Lower tier citadels should have fewer timers or a jacked up price. Astrahaus's are so cheap you can just litter them everywhere and they're a pain in the ass to get rid of. They should require fuel at least to keep their invulnerability up, such as POS's - when I was in a small corp we could harass and take down POS's with as little as four people and a lot of determination. I tried attacking an astrahaus and one can lock down four logi, requiring a fleet. I would get rid of the damage cap on lower tier citadels and give you the ability to repair them with logistics - I mean, if your enemy is bringing enough to alpha your citadel you're probably going to lose the fight anyways.  
---
Keepstars are where the big mess finally comes in. Having the ability to store an unlimited amount of supers, I had two and there were contracts for hundreds being sold/traded - couple that with the Rorq's ability to mine a fuckload, they basically massively buffed super production, capital proliferation has changed the game entirely.
---
I’m tempted to move in and try and set up a pseudo NPC region in the NE.
---
If CCP isn’t going to, night as well do it as a player.
---
It's happened before, in the Casino War.
---
I struggle to see what enjoyment goons have got from their current deployment. Sounds pretty fucking dull to roll round empty space running structure timers.
---
My vision of the Rorqual change was that it would pop a small POS bubble to protect the mining fleet and it would have to lock onto an asteroid and use it for fuel (to have this only work in asteroid belts).
---
It was never meant to do the mining itself. It would just grab the jet cans, compress the ore and pass it off to an Orca or something to haul it away.
---
The whole design purpose was to have more players in a belt with a timer in which the home players could muster up a defence force, creating more conflicts, rather than a simple gank and run.
---
I still can't understand why CCP wanted to release a FTP shooter that had to compete with the likes of Planetside2 on the ass-end of the PS3's generation. I mean they already announced the PS4 when Dust 514 dropped it was awful marketing.   
---
They didn't get any 'new players' either, most people were just Eve Online players with a PS3.
---
Its actually the casino war
---
oh wait....
---
Serenity isn’t singularity, it’s the Chinese version of tranquility.

Who is pretending it's not happening? don't buy into everything mittens tells you. Last year when the north was more united we still lost to goons. This year we knew where ever goons went, is going to get bent over. It was even out on r/eve about it being tribute b4 goons did their sotg announcement. Pretty sure NC/PL wouldn't take down some structures if they were pretending nothing was going to happen lol.
---
Hell, the best years were 2010 - 2015. Back when brawling was still viable.
---
Why?   Scamming is easily avoidable.   It's not even game mechanics, it's just human nature.   Greedy people fall for scams.
---
I upvoted it actually. This is a very important thread and I want the world to see it. /u/jibrish how much to sticky this thread for 24 hours?
---
dont forget that we were the first ally that shoot in jita with a titan on a other one
---
I played as fr00b and sl00b. I prefered the fr00b content, raids and community, however, it was essentially a PVE game. The devs listened to the vocal PVP minority and they kept ruining the PVE content with PVP changes.
---
They also did not keep up with the times, the new engine took forever to launch and they didn't improve anything, like AI actions, pathing or abilities. It became a very stagnant and stale game after awhile.
---
It seems like a good system, but I would like a system that generates more conflicts on the map. But tbf we both know it will take years until ccp comes up with an idea that then won't work. Meh.
---
In the same way goons did in WWB?
---
Undocking only in ceppis to not feed high class ships? :-P
---
o7 Respect for SkillU. Everytime we engage some kind of battle, seeing your ticker always made me worries other than saw FRT ticker.
---
Because it terrible that's why
---
  What a shit first impression of the game for new players who DONT KNOW ABOUT these scams. Just stupid fucking dumbass.. this is why the game has gone to shit because of utterly stupid people like you
---
You just don't understand thst EVE is fine, because as a nullseccer I can hop on a casual small 200titan fleet to chase out both remaining solo PVPers who naively visited our space.
---
/s, just in case.
---
i.e. immediate gratification children and adult-children that don't understand a real sense of accomplishment from defeating hurdles but would rather just throw money at a problem to solve it.
---
Killing structures isn't PVP.
---
Yeah, its a little like hunting in Delve, go for the soft targets, and run when any that can actually fight back turns up.
---
And not 1 fuck was given
---
not in the slightest.
---
the north had given up before the move ops even started, goons were fighting in SMA space (iirc) long before they abandoned the north and moved south.
---
so, feel free to try again.
---
I don't know, I think the "Eve Is Dying" meme is beginning to gain some merit. The Chinese servers are dead, and even with the influx of Chinese players into FRT and the free2play model, player numbers are beginning to trend downwards over the last year.   
---
That being said, Eve probably has a few years left, but bittervets want to stay the hell away from the game now more than ever.
---
Move to J Space
---
Best decision i made 🤷‍♂️
---
inb4 the bots are still undocking and running sites without even noticing anything different
---
&gt; I struggle to see what enjoyment goons have got from their current deployment.
---
Thanks for admitting your lacking knowledge about the situation you are posting about, makes things easier.
---
yeah these fucking pussies engaged my super and titan with 18 battlecruisers, then ran as soon as we dropped 50 caps on them lol WTF why won't they fight
---
this sov is empty, yeet
---
Been waiting for close to two years buddy.
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
and that changes absolutely nothing.
---
this thread still isn't about fleet numbers, it's about the north rolling over and offering no resistance to having dick shoved up their arse.
---
why should you just throw away the citadels, or make the killmails more juicy by leaving the rigs? ncpl has a history as the group with one of the biggest renting empires for more than 10 years, we both know that everything you destroy is peanuts
---
and i dont see salt in most of the posts. you don't even know if these people actually are members of nc or pl as well as you aren't probably in the alliance Miner ;-)
---
07
---
Because Jita is also full of idiots.
---
Hey guys he said the meme!
---
Less init too then
---
No rocket science, just spam local with "I pay 100m please don't tackle me".
---
no, he's right.
---
it's boring as fuck. literally the only people who aren't bored by it are the older (as in duration in the alliance rather than literal physical age) who have some oldschool hateboner for the north, or people on the polar opposite end of the time in service spectrum who are still in awe because it's their first fleet, first titan bridge, first structure killmail etc.
---
Oh this does bring a smile to my face, to see those "mighty" and "Elite" PVPers camped like that, justice a served!
---
Good advice!
---
Always have an exit cyno that you can jump to.  You will never be sad you did when things go to shit.
---
Hi eve isn’t dead. I have content every night and I love it. I’m having more fun in the past 5 months than I ever did 6 years ago when I started playing.
---
I think I've seen some posts of yours obsessing about the number of Goon titans, so I assume it's about bragging rights. :P If my poor frontend skills are good enough, the count should be 727 titans and 824 supers for GSF. Enjoy :P

Good feature request nonetheless. The original design probably assumed that you could eyball the number of supers of every alliance, but apparently things have changed and now you need DOM and Javascript. :P
---
I’ve actually never been dropped ratting.  True story.

Pre 2016 Eve captured tons of new players, 2010 - 2015 were the strongest years of the game. Wars and battles large and small, just about every area of nullsec was populated and lived in, NPC nullsec was the wild wild west and you didn't have to go far for a fight, gatecamps everywhere. Tons of content.  
---
It was always easier to make isk in nullsec - although these days most of nullsec is largely abandoned, people have moved into massive hubs for regions. NPC null is dead, and gatecamps aren't really viable anymore since 90% of the traffic is just interceptors warping through your camps.
---
This is so true... In eleven years every other project Eve has launched has been a disaster. Valkyrie and Gunjack were released on VR, which yeah - supporting a new playform is a good idea, but when barely 5% of any playerbase owns a VR headset you know your products aren't really going to turn a profit. Dust 514 is dead, Project Legion and World of Darkness are canceled... CCP is a one trick pony,

Sov structures are owned by alliances.  Alliance member count doesnt tell you who lives there and who dont

i was orca boosted yes
---
I actually loved the casinos... iwantisk and somerblink were arguably the only two things that kept me coming back to the game for the last year until I quit. That being said, I'm glad they're gone.
---
So you know nothing. Good. Please give more uninformed opinions.
---
Also, you might want to use Core Probes instead of Combat ones if you want to use this ship for signature survey. Core probes have double the base scanning strength of Combat ones (44 instead of 22) and also have the advantage of being able to go to a 0.25 AU range, compared to combat probes not being able to go past 0.5 (can make a difference on difficult signatures, like Sleeper Caches). 
---
Of course, this also mean you won't be able to scan down ships you might be hunting, but I guess you either have a fleet behind you if you use something as squishy as a CovOps frigate for PVP hunting.
---
If you're using this ship for exploration (PVE only), you can replace the SOE Expanded launcher by a SOE Core probe launcher, which use way less fitting room, which might allow you to ditch some of your Co-Processor for something like an Inertial Stabilizer, a DC (to survive some smartbombing gatecamps, although you can easily get behind one in a covops cloak capable ship).
---
'Eh, this kind of sounds like a shallow argument. Most people lived out of POS's back then and it was kind of a really dope 'nomad' style of gameplay. I think Citadels were something needed, but the pricepoint and usefulness of them should have been changed drasticaly. I think the lowest tier should have started off at the fort pricepoint; astrahaus's should have been 7/8bil, forts should be 30/45bil, and keepstars 500b. Would have reduced the proliferation a lot more.
---
its all the same shit just a different colored logo.
---
Just generally being a low baller + spammer
---
can l have your stuff ? considering you're all quitting ?
---
You know the nickname Rageliner is already taken right? Just taking it down to Rageline13 doesn't make you special.
---
CCP just added a subscribe and undock button.
---
Delve / fountain / period basis / catch / pure blind / cloud ring / fade / querious
---
In the very first years of the game, NPCs would buy trit for 2 isk, pyerite for 4 and so on. And sell the same minerals for higher prices. 
---
So minerals were not coming in only from mining and out from manufacturing. It was not a full player market
---
Only stubborn Bjornbee is playing. But even he struggles and streams other games sometimes.
---
I had nothing to with you guys other than an occasional roam, but I still have a lot of respect, so I'm just leaving an o7 here. Fly safe, capsuleers.
---
Capsule supposedly takes a brain scan as it's breached, then transfers it to a 'blank' body. I'm paraphrasing super heavily, as I'm not home to really dig; but tl;Dr shoot him outside of the pod.
---
Then why are you not defending?
---
As it turns out, hatred is the catalyst of war, not a desire for gudfites.
---
Because of Falcon
---
It’s actually for collectors , just because you are poor doesn’t mean everyone else is .
---
I can only speak for my corp and we don't give a shit about our killboard. 
---
The main reason you don't get fights is that people just don't like feeding shit for an unwinnable fight. If you want to pew pew maybe try to not counterform 3 fleets every time you could get a fight. 
---
As it stands now your FCs don't want a fight that is remotely fightable and our FCs won't go whelp fleets for no reason. Buit I sure enjoy all the salty reddit posts.
---
If skill urself also dropped the ihubs (which I guess they did, but I'm too lazy to confirm it personally) then there won't be any respawning sites for bots, or anyone, to run.
---
Lmao. This is some pretty serious "no true Scotsman" shit

43b, supers around 8b

&gt;Vote Xenuria.
---
Yeees yesss, cough, cough *mad laughter.*
---
I farm wh's and dont use any alts or scouting, its too time intensive and the actual odds of being found are not high, yes you will take losses, but you far outmake the lost ship value in farming loot. Just make sure you safe the loot fairly often.
---
rip
---
Pray you never find out!
---
 Don't say its name thrice, lest it comes for you in sparkly shoes and luscious bionic cat ears.
---
By the same count, they quit because of how much effort that now entails.
---
Also make sure to repeat this at least every 14 minutes.
---
A thing to note for early mineral prices is that we originally didn't have fractional ISK, everything had to be priced in whole isk and becomes a bit of a problem with low value stuff like trit.
---
The monthly economic report had a graph with mineral index (all minerals combined) since 2003 https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1A95tvHuERlTBB1TOPzEL5/1c7e96ffa095c54d8c1404814c88a7e2/9d_economy.indices.png

Last time I fought Goons they were in bombers, warping to-and-fro as we chased them, only for them to leave bombs behind for us(which they had every right to do, all is fair in love and war etc).

Plex into self-consciousness.

Confirmed Xenuria.

time to launch my rental empire

the alliance disbanded so all ihubs popped for sure

It wasn't until this recent war that I realized....

Damn that sounds dope

IIRC the IHub upgrades continue to function until downtime.

That said I think the alliance disbanded long enough before DT to make the whole thing entertaining.

---
With all the events like Fanfest, Evesterdam, Eve Vegas, Down Under and the likes, only very little hatred remains within eve.
---
:munch:
---
That list is missing picture of a 3d printed ship.
---
Get out of boring null and then do whatever you want without being restricted by 500 agreements and rules.
---
Didnt goons once loose their entire sov because some director forget to pay the alliance bill and the alliance was also closed? Way back after they took Delve from BoB?
---
Is this bait or you are actually serious ?
---
if that's so, feel free to form up and defend something.
---
i'm currently worried that the insurance on my ships will expire before anything shoots back at them.
---
that's not really a problem though.
---
if wars were just fun, people wouldn't need to hate each other to have a war - because, y'know, it'd be fun so we'd want to do it.
---
Did you ask him? Often hunters don't mind debriefing a new player after the fact.
---
No, the game is in the state it is because everything that made the game cool and unique got removed on the flag of helping new players.
---
War in eve is the opposite of boring. Risk averse FC's and leaders make it boring. "Oh no when we lose we lose our internet empire better not do anything unless we are 100% sure we win"
---
Really? 2011-2013 felt like the most active years. Consistently saw ~50k people on most weekends.
---
oh look, another one of these
---
Goons didn't even do that TBH, they just left as soon as test started hitting vale, and SMA fail cascaded and lost fade  
---
I know tishu became #1 in titan use for a long time due to all the pos's  
---
Though this was all Pre-citadel, so its hard to compar
---
Make sure to crit any statics in the system, check dscan and new signatures every minute or so.
---
Keep MJD unit ready in cargo, always align to safe, get cloaky alt ready to scoop loot from mtu in grid warp range.
---
Sounds like me a couple of years ago. I logged into Eve right before my accounts went unsubbed after not playing for 4 months, about 3 months after Tri's keepstars died. I was docked in two dreads and just gated 20 jumps back to my old NPC nullsec home with no problem.  
---
Recently I went on an alpha roam, pimped a cynabal and bounced around for an hour, probably 20 gates. Absolutely nothing. Solo PvP seems to have died.
---
Lol. You posted your comment 5 seconds after i posted this. I comment a lot on things but at least I read them before.
---
Naw, karttoon booted everyone
---
It's all the same "boo hoo, Goons too stronk now, it was better when PL and NC. were in charge!" type bullshit
---
What’s a low baller please ?
---
Group of wh vets formed from a few different corps, mainly Lazerhawks and... overload this I think was the other main one? Have run into them a few times and they can definitely throw down with the big boys :)

Biomassing
---
Good video!
---
You should select to show details on your combat logs.  That way, you immediately know what weapon type you are being shot with.  Also, it seems you were a bit slow to activate your guns.
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone with 7 Titan losses, as well as a faction titan loss before...
---
It's an older code sir, but it checks out
---
Have a look at Altered Carbon on Netflix, they have a very similar cloning setup to Eve where your consciousness moves into your next body. People can jump between bodies - etc.  
---
In Altered Carbon; "True Death" occurs only when one willingly refutes it, typically due to religious reasons, or when someones "Stack" (IE: The implant in their head) gets destroyed right when or before the body dies. If you haven't seen the series I wholey recommend watching it. A lot of stuff on Netflix is garbage but that series is gold.
---
good work. please keep showing wormholes are not dead.
---
No it’s not ? Not once in this post was either Goon, NC or PL mentioned.
---
Read before you talk.
---
Glad you added the /s, coming from a goon I don't think I could have nailed that sarcasm.
---
&gt;  Some faction has grown so big that the opposite party will not fight them and avoid conflict. The victorious will soon discover that conflict is always necessary, and players without an arch nemesis or an evil adversary that they dream to fight against will log in less and less.
---
Totally not talking about goons right now. Yup. Absolutely not.
---
Ouch. That guy was pretty cool, I remember him.
---
you're literally commenting on a post where we went out to fight  
---
trying to be smug, implying that we don't come out to fight  
---
Really makes your noggin think doesn't it
---
Absolutely not, since they weren’t mentioned and this apply to most major coalitions right now, not specially Goons.
---
&gt;34k goons + friends are happy in one and a half region...
---
yeah and thats not good for the game lol
---
I guess we'll ignore the structure purge occurring in Tribute as evidence of remaining hatred.
---
IHubs are owned by the renting alliance and the renting alliance wasn't disbanded.
---
There's a newer version [here](https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg), but abyssal Space is missing in that one too.
---
One of the best things to do is exploration. Find relic/data sites and run them. Outside of ratting, running combat complexes can be extremely valuable.  
---
It's fairly safe but there is a level of danger involved, which I think makes it feel a whole lot more rewarding. Found a dope ass site in an enemies local territory? Want to run it and make hundreds of millions or bitch out and run away? Choices, choices.
---
I'm doing the same thing really. Coming back in my alpha character, I just pimped out a Machariel and running around NPC nullsec like a boss.
---
If so then nobody would consider VNI ratting a proper method.
---
imagine being so deluded that thinking a vague and relative statement can't mean anything other than what it means to you
---
The multi window program is called [Eve O Preview](https://github.com/Phrynohyas/eve-o-preview)
---
Its super handy when you need to multibox many accounts on not enough screens.
---
We're mainly Lazerhawks now?  
---
That's news to me.
---
It's pronounced e HEFF kee, and they formed mostly from members of The Last Chancers who were an old C4 corp.
---
I don't blame you for such big gulps of the spin, I get it, it's part of the meta game, but at some point, it just gets tiring, you know.
---
A 16 year old game is losing players? Who would have thought. 
---
The game is fine. There is plenty of fun to be had. You just aren’t looking for it. Nor will this post or any subsequent post make it any better. 
---
This is a sandbox. You have to go out and create your own content. And if you don’t want to do that go join PH or Karma fleet and be a drone. Or quit. Become a statistic.
---
bAn The\_mITTAnI and pROgoDlEGND 2 make Eve Fun again.

/s before all you sluts start downvoting me.

In all seriousness though I did enjoy fighting wars over resources/reasons other than "WE BORED NEED MOAR CONTENT."

I'd spent too long in k-space and forgot to keep transversal up against blap dreads. Cue pant filler going into deep structure. Worth it just to freak Xaph out though. GF Novac o7

TRECI\*
---
I have being playing since 2007 and was prob 1 of the most hardcore players in the game rising to top 10 zkill killers flying with black legion/nc/pl and was pretty much addicted to the game and I quit playing in 2019 which is something I never thought I would do but soo much bad decisions by ccp has driven me to unsub 12 accounts
---
Then goons would've had 30 keepstars instead of 45 or whatever it is now, and some smaller groups would be crying because they would be 200bn from their first keepstar.
---
tbh noco/pl it was a good fights good effort same for you arqui i'm only sad i didn't get your corpse after all, you can thank noco for that.
---
Star Citizen will feast on Eve's bones!!
---
I agree. But current mechanics in my opinion suppress content to such a great extent. Citadels mechanics, fatigue free ansiblex gates, the lack of localized conflicts, etc.
---
Sell a handful at market price, then use that to cover the rest and throw your sell order up.
---
really made ccp economists paranoid as well, that's why ccp has spent so much money trying to diversify their game portfolio instead of just doubling down on eve.
---
Yes you can save location of them if they are on grid. I have a very close formation where all probes can be put on grid thousands of km away to make multiple quick pings.
---
There was always the argument that "yeah eve didn't die last time we claimed it was, but now eve ***really is*** dying".
---
I never said it was better when NC, PL was on the strong hand. The referance was not only to Goons. Was to Test, INIT and many other that for a super coalition. But the reference was more of an alarm system to what current mechanics of inactive localized conflict can lead to.
---
Just the corp name I remember most. I have no idea what the percentages are.
---
The wallet never got emptied, and you're trying to spin that the DRF only had about 250 people at the end. During the triple fortizar timer night, you had well over 500 dudes on your voicecomms vs our 127. I'll file this in under the same category as the 2 trillion isk loan from Hard Knocks: Absolute dumb lies that you spout at every turn.
---
True, whatever kind of tactic you implement, you can't compete with goons bankroll.
---
Did you notice the absence of any kind of data miner? Or that I mentioned that there character is a perfect scanner? /snark
---
This is for a hunter.
---
Then the blame is shared equally by not just the one main faction but everyone who contributed to circumstances that only resulted in that one main faction gaining even more strength.
---
Which is why I pointed in the beginning of my reply that all I said would be for a signature survey ship.
---
Blind hunter, I see.
---
Now you are correct.

Legitimately having in-game skin effects for things like bubbles (hictor/dictor) jump bridges, cynos ect. ect. could be another avenue of revenue for CCP.

I'm all for stuff that looks cool but doesn't effect gameplay!

Never heard of em

When PL and NC were in charge they were &lt;5000 characters out of a game with peak concurrent players breaking 40k--omegas all--daily.  When they were in charge, supers were rare, small gang was thriving, moons drove resource wars in low and nullsec, citadels hadn't broken offensive play, pre-injectors allowed higher SP groups to win with smaller fleets in things like ahacs and t3s....
---
The WHOLE POINT is that the game is just fucked right now, and if goons were this dominant but there were options like in 2013, we could just go elsewhere, even though they are ~60k character coalition allied with the other biggest coalition in the game, and we only have 25k online including alphas some days.  That means Goons are 12x the size of NCPL at their height, and the game is half as busy.
---
Go ahead, try facwar, running a 30 man gang that's not just whaling--anything like we did back then.  Notice how gameplay options other than solo PvE and nullsec bloc PvE are barely possible, and happen only in spite of the meta.  Otherwise, shut the fuck up.
---
I think NA had the biggest one
---
Sitting next to your MTU gives me a perfect warp in for my Sabre.  I tend to drop the MTU as I complete the site and am leaving for the next one.  Come back later with the salvager to scoop loot.  A good hunter will still get you even without the MTU sitting there, but it makes them work a little harder.
---
UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONS.
---
While I'm sad to see them go, I'm excited to see who will take their space
---
Check out r/evejobs for better results.  As a recommendation, also check out Signal Cartel:  [https://www.signalcartel.com/](https://www.signalcartel.com/) Good luck!
---
How about you edit your post so that you don't blame only the goons?
---
Most of the solo PvP'ers I used to watch are retired, I am kind of curious if there's any good Eve content as well. I see Jin-Tan still uploads his nullsec war videos which are nice.
---
Man, you know that players have engaged in extreme justification craft bordering on self-harm when they interpret low effort taunts at an enemy's utter powerlessness as "salty." How far up one's own ass does one have to be to not even conceive of a viewpoint where fights are considered irrelevant and even tedious?
---
I only fly ships that I don't mind losing (Statios and Astero). Besides that, I've got my UI set up so that I always have the results of the directional scanner available. That, plus a filter set to player ships and any and all probes, makes it so that I can just press "V" every whenever I want and immediately get notifified if there's anything else nearby.
---
Havind said that, I *did* run into a bizarro situation where a Loki suddenly decloaked right next to me once. He didn't show up on scan, so he must have been lying in wait till something warped in. A quick MWD pulse got me out of trouble before his targeting delay wore off, so it wasn't an issue, but it shows that no matter how prepared you are, there's still ways to get caught with your pants down.
---
Jump gates are pretty dumb. But besides TZ tanking I will take RFing a citadel over a pos any day. There is plenty of localized content you just have to take the steps to create it. As annoying as fozzie sov is, it’s leaps and bounds better than dominion sov.
---
If you learn how to step them properly you could be a god at making deep safes on par with the old 127km/s scorps
---
Good point, thanks! :)

---
fuckign lmao, yeah okay
---
so back when they were actively poaching anyone and everyone who had supers and titans into their little club to further solidify their strength, that was totally fine.
---
but now that everyone else in the game has (due to changing game mechanics and PL/NC. being fucking incompetent) the opportunity to develop, suddenly now we're all crying about the good old days when you could bully smaller groups without worry
---
yeah, game is fucked, but at least you get to blame goons for it, hope that makes you feel better about it. this is the game naturally progressing, blame CCP for being shit at anticipating how the game would ultimately turn out, don't blame goons for figuring out the optimal strategy just because knocks of your own your cute little sand castles.
---
I don't  see a "/s" so I am assuming this is a serious comment. I would like to let you know that was published by CCP. It is a very helpful graphic none the less
---
If you run Havens in a 100MN VNI; set your orbit to 25km, the AB takes you to a 30km orbit. Don't deploy drones before whole pocket aggro. Most of the time my drones caught aggro when I was orbiting at 31+km.
---
Supply-Demand
---
Too many people farm ISK for PLEX, PLEX supply falls, PLEX prices rise. Capitalistic player-driven market.
---
Auto Target is good for rats that ewar your sensors (Serpentis/Guristas), but other than that, I don't see why the AT would help with keeping aggro.

So GSF had 2 stacked eagle fleets,bomber fleet and AF fleet,that is over 550 subcap ships,they also called their pets GOTG to fight 300 panfam dudes and guess what,they even dropped supers on half full munin fleet on top of that and they are wondering why they are not getting fights. I already stated this before but I will do it again,95% of GSF members are those highsec miners and mission runners that got sick of being ganked and joined Goons and now they think they are elite pvpers. Op of this post is a pure example of it.
---
I second wormholegank above me, signal cartel are cool dudes if you're into exploration. Plus they have this cool hippy pacifist thing going on, they're the only people I will not consider a target if I run into them in an exploration site.
---
go for that oldschool runescape/classic wow angle on fresh starts and i'd be all over that shit in a heartbeat
---
Apparently the first forum post that said EVE was dying was somewhere around July or August '03 :')
---
3 days? Damn, I thought a few months
---
I'm doing mostly forlorn rally points and the orbit KM doesn't change a thing...tried 10-50km.
---
Hold point. We're on the way!
---
&gt;NC/PL made me leave my alliance. I didn't want to leave but they poached me against my will.
---
Idiots like you actually believe this.

&gt;imagine being so deluded that thinking a vague and relative statement can't mean anything other than what it means to you

interesting

very very interesting

I'm just glad I'm not blinded by white light when I warp to this event
---
Renters are evil. Death to ALL renters.
---
are you aware of how many smaller alliances not directly affilated to gsf is living in most of those regions?
---
Sounds like roleplay.
---
&gt; This is a sandbox.
---
Do you know what kids aren't allowed to bring into sandboxes?
---
Full sized JCB diggers. 
---
Why? Because it makes the sandbox unusable by anyone else because they're likely to get crushed by a half-ton bucket flying around. 
---
EVE has got itself a position where the game has allowed one group to not only bring in JCBs, but to amass them at such numbers that they can literally scoop up the entire sandpit and take it back home for their personal use.
---
If you are highsec carebear and really bad at the game then you join Karmafleet.There you will have a lot of safety to do your crabbing and listen mittani on fireside how entire of eve is highsec pubbies while goons are elite. If you have a bit of brain and desire for pvp then you join horde or brave.
---
ah fuck, i'm drunk and made the mistake of replying to globby
---
shit happens to the best of us i guess.
---
You mean retard comment, right?
---
I'm not, because it'll probably be one of the blobs that has lived near them. Any small/new player group trying to move into the space will probably get pushed out by the bigger players. And with how much effort it is for a small group to hold sov in EVE nowadays any group that tries will burn out. I'm actually surprised skillu survived as long as it did.

&gt;Not spending 3 hours brute forcing a randomized bot timer for a 70m kill

It’s good to go off on a high note o7

&gt; ... each of the invasion world tour sites have a Competitive Eve Thing™ where winners get flown to Fanfest.

I was at EVE Amsterdam and there it was... not that well prepared imo. It was still fun to take part in though.

Ur just jealous I have 50,000 very close friends.
---
SkillU didnt create that. Dronelands have always been a bot paradise
---
Missing post about eve dying
---
are you for real lmao
---
That would be nice. But it looks like pandemic is at Thanksgiving engorging themselves
---
Nope goons are a symptom of a fucked game, not the reason it's fucked.  I literally never said they were the reason.  They're just the most obvious example of what shouldn't be possible--or at the very least what shouldn't be appealing--in a game like this.
---
And yeah, changing game mechanics... that's what it's about.  Due to changing game mechanics, the game is fucked.
---
But honestly I'm more interested... what do you get out of this? Like, why do you want to bury your head in the sand, pretend everything is fine and let the game die?  When was the last time you logged in?  Honestly if you want to play goonswarm online and just mine all day, go play farming simulator.
---
sorry, missed this one, I was a bit under the weather on friday so I wasn't paying as much attention as usual.
---
got home from work and rested up though, had a good weekend - hope you guys also had an amazing weekend too!
---
(✿◕ᴗ◕✿) stay safe out there guys! (✿◕ᴗ◕✿)
---
Scale of the titans seems to be accurate.
---
Wish Eve actually had interplanetary warfare and life-size planets.
---
Bankroll? You mean income. I got a second titan since last war not because I just had money laying around in the bank. I got it because the rest of the universe isn't building their own T2 stuff, they're buying it from goons. I haven't done ratting or mining since the last war, ***at all***. Just t2 industry. And the reason I even bothered  doing that is because I can just buy the inputs, throw it in any of the alliance structures and built it, then ITL moves it to jita for me. Then some helpful relisters in jita can't do math so I can usually just dump the stuff I made to profitable buy orders if I don't feel like updating the sell orders before I go to work for the next two weeks.
---
Mad lads
---
Well it depends on where you are (or your wh for that matter) but I for my part found it really enjoyable to go to Fraternity's O3- Staging and IAS. Idk for other groups but you can try to go close to their staging. It's way more traffic/content than in some random krabbing systems.
---
There we get some kills and they form most of the time (obviously sometimes with too much) but I'd say 80% of the roams to them are quite fun, even when we whelp a lot :)
---
BTW. Thank you FRT for being an enjoyable enemy
---
One of the first times I was in wormhole space (as a fresh faced noob in 2010ish), I was running c2 sites and a combat probe appeared ~80km away, I was transfixed before I realized what was going on and saw a small fleet on dscan and warped back to my pos. I spoke in local telling the dude he scanned me so well that I saw a probe land on grid.
---
We had a good laugh (for those not old enough, the grid back then would be a sphere about 150-200km in radius.
---
man what would that be like

I just like seeing the hypocrisy of a bunch of kids who used to be the schoolground bully end up crying the most. Simple as that.

I've been playing since late '11, had a continuous subscription going since May '12 up until... I think when CCP cancelled the AT.  
---
I love the idea of EVE, but the way CCP has taken EVE has turned it into a game I do not enjoy playing.  
---
Just wanted to share that you're not the only one.
---
Why dont you run AUTZ fleets for bombers bar and then you can shoot winterco in the timezone the crab in. No one is stopping you.   
---
We shoot anyone. However my campers provide unlimited content which I will take full advantage of.

Ah the problem with being a cloaky hunter... Those fucking delays.
---
If I could do everything in an Astero, I would.
---
Calm down there Marshy. I didn’t say you only shoot one group. I said when you have an op you will team up with other attackers to kill that target. If you are shooting a test super you will team up with Frat and PL on the grid to make sure it dies. The same goes for if you are shooting a PL rorq and test shows up. You would be willing to team up with test to shoot the PL rorq.

Altered Carbon addresses this problem much better than Eve.

It is still absolutely fucked in the brain that peligro is allowed to make stuff up and ignore previous GM messages just to seem like Batman.

Given that you end up controlling the next iteration of you in the game, you must be the same consciousness or it'd be game over.

Fair enough yeah I misunderstood you. My bad

---
Oh wow. Haven't seen that meme in a while
---
The two of you guys should get off reddit, undock and duke it out at the sun.
---
We are here to harass and kill your miners and ratters why won’t you give us a fair fight?
---
I’m sure you’re trolling but for anyone else who cares — that is one of the longest lasting names for the goons aka Imperium before they rebranded for political correctness.
---
This is an interesting philosophical question that's been posed by many a futurist. If you replace part of your brain with a synthetic piece that operates the same way, are you still you?
---
Follow the line of logic from your initial answer if you said yes. Then think if you replaced pieces of your brain bit by bit with synthetics, at what point do you stop being you? If you continue to be the same consciousness, what does that say about a human's sense of self? Where is the identity coming from if it isn't stored in the brain?
---
How many other games have you played for 12 years?
---
Yeah lets go back to 2015 when NC. was a thing
---
Thanks :)
---
No it’s not funny Pet.
---
Goons have a fleet of 300 , NC. Forms 200 man fleet to fight .They rage ping and cyno in a 200-300 more dudes. 
---
Would any Competent FC stay and fight? NO!
---
So STFU if don’t know jack shit about this game.
---
Is it realy hatred or merely a consequence of a act of ours in the past? I tend to believe there is no true hatred in a video game.

If ships exploding is your idea of PVP then we have a problem because the north won’t undock.
---
Actions have consequences? Like they push and you run to daddy goons? 
---
You talk about how industrious you were, and you WERE industrious. Can't argue that. More industrious than NC. 
---
That is irrelevant to the fact you blue'd the other massive super power in the game when push came to shove. You had a chance to fight a war and instead of standing as a group you decided you wanted a 'for sure' win. Now together you're rolling through all known space and its impossible to stop. 
---
There are mechanics to this game which are hurting the game - but the most destructive thing in this game are GOONS and TEST being total cowards WITH ZERO BALLS and the batphones that destroy any chance at content. 
---
I remembered TEST of old, those amazing bastards that undocked and brought the fight regardless. They were bad ass. You sir, suck.
---
Pretty pathetic dood
---
Why? High ratio of relics? Something especially good about the flavors of the contents?

All sansha regions are good because you get Intact Armor plates from them.

Dunno, you'd have to ask the mangos and see if anyone kept track.

Yep!

It has become so much a tradition that when they closed the old forums and started the new ones, a brand new "eve is dying" thread was started on day one in the new forums.
---

---
Well, just like people, EvE is dying at any second. It's called living.
---
for sure!
---
Loki can be cov-op, they can always have scanned down the system before you got there.
---
ansiblex are just pre-jump aids bridges which are what we had up until the end of 2014, so throughout the peak years of the game.
---
So does this mean its time for an old-school land rush? Will smaller corps from high/lowsec try to take some space?
---
sansha relics best relic.
---

---
SkillU didn't create it, they just refined it and blued up any type of threat.  The regions they took over had bots, but also had a lot of "independent" alliances.  Now it is just bots as far as the eye can see.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/af7536/the_ultimate_nullsec_faction_relicdata_sites/ is an interesting read

Sansha is not that far ahead, you can go other places and maybe do better ISK/hr since there will be less competition
---
I have blizkrieg and all the old sudden strike games and was a big fan of Cossacks and American conquest
---
\^\^\^He gets it right. And if you are too afraid of people coming in you could try and crit/roll and not scan the new wormhole.
---
For values of "easy" that don't include your time investment in sitting in station spamming local every 30 seconds.
---
So was it burnout from the mechanics, or burnout from trying hard for so long?
---
No don't join a bloc, use your brain and do something cool
---
alpha clone vs updated clone (Like the Mu clone before they got rid of that system.)
---
Drug manufacturing is really hard on ligistics scale. You need gases from outside of your region to make the drugs... Good luck getting those. Also anything else than strong boosters is dogshit
---
Oh
---
The new player experience outside of a bloc involves dying in PvP for reasons you can’t properly understand, sitting in the station waiting for nothing to happen or shooting NPC’s. There’s no reason not to join one when you first start as they will provide you with the ships and more importantly the content you need to learn how to play the game.
---
Literally anything else you can think of doing, you can still do as part of bloc whilst also taking advantage of their resources. Exploration etc.

---
I feel like the impact of the warp speed changes in Rubicon were the real start of the downward spiral for this game tbh. Rubicon made it so much more painful to move BS and BCs that people became more reliant than ever on titan bridges, jump bridge networks and capital force projection. Then a year later CCP throw in jump fatigue because everyone was teleporting across the map with fleets rather than using gates, because why would you if you had the option?
---
What did both of these things do? Made it so that it takes longer to go and PVP in game. For a game that leans heavily on it's veteran players to generate content and populate the world CCP provided this is bad news. When your playerbase has increasing real life commitments, in the form of careers and families, adding an extra 30mins or an hour to going on a roam can be the difference between bothering to log on or not. Even if you find the time to take the longer journey out then you better be mindful of the fact that your slower warping ships are going to give the enemy a longer time to dock up or form up a defensive hammer to smack you with and maybe use their home team advantage to drop caps on you, knowing that you can't easily respond as you'll run into issues with fatigue.
---
Sure, it's fine to say "adapt or die" but when the majority of the playerbase seems unwilling or unable to adapt to the new state of the game everyone winds up suffering in the end.
---
Imagine not being able to keep your own sov in twokay1nine
---
Reload it and you can get in, its a rambling terra bad long read though.
---
Imagine being reported by CCP as being the highest botting % alliance ;)
---
Why would someone who has trillions of isk spend real life money amounting to thousands of dollars to pay for 12 accounts when the isk value would be peanuts to him I call bullshit and anyone who was in the goonswarm incursion Sig deserves to be banned
---
I wish this would happen more often to Goons.
---
Blew our load? Their fleets are open we can do that stuff to em in all fleets.
---
I suspect both. Its not easy running on such a small group compared to their space
---
tricked idiot
---
ill send you some carbon though
---
Imagine that people hold grudges.
---
You do realize scamming and fucking people over is encouraged by CCP cos EVE isn't supposed to be safe in any form?
---
Nolak did you honestly just write this yourself?
---
Lmao go play runescape or literally any better game. You’re done here.
---
good skin 2!
---
IDK didn't work out so well in 2012. NC/PL/TEST were able to hold goons at bay for a time, but when NC/PL stopped coming, TEST broke like wet paper.
---
I dont give a fuck it's wrong and there is no place for it in the game anymore. What a fucking terrible advertisement for a new player...
---
I'm newish to the game, and don't know much for the politics, does anyone know why they lost all their sovereignty.

That should have been the official line on the dev blog

EVE is better than it has ever been. Its player base continues to get worse. Maybe stop blaming the game for bad players. 
---
This is a sandbox, the real game is a creation of the players. When EVE was young and the players new, there was nothing to play for but the dreams -- build this thing, win that war, organize a society. These quests and how players because adversaries to each other's quests form the vast network of narratives which made EVE magic. 
---
Now that the players are established and wealthy, we have exchanged our dreams for responsibilities, our stories for statistics. We don't care about conquering that territory and establishing a community, we care about the Killboard and the monthly economic report. We are far more concerned on maintaining upward growth in power, protecting our gains, avoiding embarrassments and insults. Narrative is dead and Banality reigns. 
---
Until players realize that their own fear and greed is causes the experience of "EvE is dying", EvE will continue to waste away. But the magic is there. As soon as you decide to take on a story, risk the failure, accept the struggle; the magic comes back. And with all the gusto of the early years but now without constant disconnects, game breaking bugs, lack of communication and organization systems... 
---
The Universe is now filled with the Evil Empires, dedicated to power, terrified of destruction, soulless. EvE has a massive problem -- it lacks people willing to tell the story of heroes. What else did you sign up for? To get ISK and a Green Killboard? How banal.
---
It was actually a chaturbate stream. We watch them together.
---
Bots dying is good?
---
Hardly eerily.
---
Ccp do not talk about individual bans. (Brisc's was a special case, as it wasn't eula related.)
---
Tricked ? l love free things send away buddy.
---
Here you post about provi trying to awox instead of fight you, but weren't you the one warping away? :thonk:
---
I agree..
---
Teleporting across the map was the primary reason that so much space can and is controlled. 
---
Jump fatigue was aimed at trying to force alliances into smaller spaces. They also increased resources so that they could live in those smaller spaces.
---
Now that the zombie bee horde has almost completed the blue doughnut, how do you think the mechanics could carve it up again and destroy them?
---
I would take PL posters more seriously if their alliance actually become relevant beyond gate camps again.
---
All imperium sites are click bait articles filled with ads every two sentence
---
So I had omega for a while and I am far past the 5 mill cap. Is it wise to start a new character? My two favorite ships that I have flown were the Tristan and Rifter, but I honestly love exploring a lot. Would you reccomend 2 new alphas, 1 to fight and 1 to explore?
---
&gt;I've recently been living in WH space and I love it. But one Thing i Wonder is, how do you Guys stay ultra Safe when faring sites?
---
We don't, because trying to stay safe while crabbing will ruin our or someone else's PvP content.
---
Wormholes
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
They decided that the game as it is is not the game they wish to play.  Instead of slowly burning out they dropped all sov and went out in a blaze. o7
---
Use a public contract, the fee is a flat 10k isk
---
"And statements from GSF Internal Affairs who state they did not find that I committed RMT." LoL
---
... and yet the zombie bee horde keeps claiming more space, while the number of SOV alliances keeps dropping ...
---

It's the best part of eve. No-one will protect you from your own greed.

They lost all their sov because SkillU disbanded, all the elite people including all fc's and content creators other then P3ak quit the game

The warp speed changes were great. The problem are the mega coalitions. Everyone is blue to eachother and you have to travel ages to find fight.

---
Woah.

The game is at a 2007 level population. For most of 2019 the game has been shedding concurrent online numbers. Since May the loss of people onlining seems to have accelerated. It seems many folk just don’t like the direction that ccp is taking the game. The current update is a prime example. Ccp made all these changes (such as war dec, neut logi) to retain players especially new players. It apparently hasn’t worked as the numbers have gone straight in the opposite direction. It’s well past time ccp tried something new. Imo they should head back to their roots, and just create the conditions for the players to make the content.
---
IMHO jump fatigue worked.  The first blue donut existed because an entity could be anywhere on the map they were needed, so an NC/PL could control a lot of space with titans and caps.
---
The limitation worked.  Power could not be extended anywhere anytime someone wanted.
---
its only a bit of fun shooping friend, not to be taken seriously, we all lose at some point, I even made one when HTP dunked us a week or two ago.
---
But that isn't because of FozzieSov.
---
Man never botted and got banned for petitioning an account he had banned following a 2013 offense. (Edited the wiki, permabanned, told he could come back on new toons, did that, petitioned an old account to be unbanned, got permabanned for the old offense again on his new toons.)  
---
He got *teleported* as a bot.

JonnyPew deleted his channel and all his videos. RIP
---
KF is cool. Lots of content lately to go around and whelp ships, even outside of war ops. The SRP is great too. Plus all the sigs and such mean you can find a group inside goons that does whatever it is you’re looking to do. 
---
Brave is also really cool. Anytime we’ve ran into them while out roaming they always put up a fight and it’s never mean spirited. 
---
No idea really on PH.
---
I don't know but what got me was that the game mechanics make it possible for people whose space is attacked to just curl up and time zone tank. That citadels are cancer and can be spammed for next to no cost. That after a certain point there are no more skill-intensive fights; just sluggish, boring hours-long tidi-fests that are decided by disconnects. The kinds of things that make you go play better games.
---
"Even a blind worm finds a turd sometimes." ;)

I also noted that he obtained the required information via a GDPR request. That's a pretty straightforward way to get information that directly bypasses the GM team.
---
Except for Americans, of course.
---
... somehow mining a SOV structure with a magic wand while spinning around it was meant to be fun and grow the game?

Not a fresh start, just some of the good from now and then put it in 2013 eve
---
I'm about to get my first rorqual and have some questions:
---
1) Passive or shield boosting fit? (Alliance has capital umbrella)
---
    1a) re: shield boosting - how often do rorq gankers use  cap neuters?
---
2) more of an open ended question: anyone care to share some silly mistakes new rorq pilots make so I can avoid them myself?
---
Thanks
---
I'll take a half dose of what he's having.
---
Longer than 24/48 hrs.
---
TBH when goons do it. Any longer and they just start feeding more than they already do.
---
It's not the best part of eveat all stop talking utter shit
---
Fuck off dipshit.  Its fucking hilarious that winterco plus every ally they could buy is ok in your eyes, but us getting any military support is somehow wrong.  Get the fuck out of here with that shit. 
---
We were facing enemies that not only had subcap superiority versus just legacy, but also had an edge in supercap numbers.  Their stated goal was evicting us.  
---
Last summer we had pl, skillu, tri, and winterco super fleets sitting on our doorstep as well as getting supcap fleets from nc, ph, gotg, co2, and then all the smaller entities they had in theater, lumpy, centi, and ect.  As it stood, with a max form, and the goon shield super fleet, we were equal with what the enemy put on the field at ualx.  If the enemy had even been slightly competent in positioning, it would have been a much closer run.  Fortunately they didn't seem to have a supercap fc among them that was competent enough to work out how a keepstar grid was going to work and dropped at max range.
---
If you plotted those entities on a map they would have stretched from pureblind and fade to the parts of immensea and tenerifis that frat controlled then.
---
So yea, northern supers moving south meant we were going to work with the imperium.  Everyone with any access to diplomatic intel knew what would happen if northern supers came south. 
---
As for us being industrious.  I assure you we still are.
---
While I agree with a lot of your points, CCP's profits are not a good relationship of which where the successful periods of the game.  
---
"So how come CCP's revenue skyrocketed from 2013 to 2016 and EVE Online numbers declined a drastically 40% in that period."  - Please cite.  EBITDA is income, not revenues.
---
The measure should be revenues, specifically revenues from EvE.
---
   When they weren't making as much money they were attempting to create a successful game other than eve.  Dust, Valkyrie, etc would all cost money.
---
  By stopping the attempts to make a new game, and laying off a lot of employees, they reduced their costs.  The strategy seems to have changed to slowly milking the player base for cash and no longer trying to either create a new franchise or rejuvenate the game.  Perhaps Hilmar only had one real trick in him?  I think they should have focused on making eve better, which was their advantage over anyone else.
---
If only you did some research before posting your retarded thing...
---
r/whoosh
---
Yup
---
stop playing the game on easy mode being in the largest coalition in the game then. if not, don't complain about not getting fights.
---
Honestly is eve better than ever before? 
---
\- Supercap proliferation 
---
\- Citadel spam with tons of timers and asset safety
---
\- Lack of regional resources or strategic moons meaning no reason to fight
---
\- Miners in unkillable ships and pvers in afk VNI
---
\- FW ignored for years and now essentially dead minus botters and farmers
---
\- lower playcount despite higher number of bots/alts and free to play players
---
\- Most of nullsec is allied with each other
---
\- Skill injectors
---
If your main goal in eve is to PVP; eve is in a worse state than ever before. CCP should never have let it get to this point, however I agree the playerbase is also largely to blame. Recruiting all the new players into the already biggest coalitions in the game was a terrible idea that killed basically all the other playstyles except for null sec f1 pusher.
---
where did i complain about not getting fights?
---
This is not an Imperium site though, this is a GamerGate chud's ranting space.
---
I came in during the change.  Dominion sov sounded less fun.  ALso in my corp we used FozzieSov all the time to force content from larger but more risk averse alliances since they didn't want to lose their space/ADM/ticks, etc.
---
I guess he is assuming there is always a mobile depot deployed?
---
I just wanted to say something, but you won. Take my upvote.
---
that was amazing.
---
And nothing of value was lost?
---
lmao ok
---
1.) Always buffer fit - it's super easy to manage that way, and cheaper too!
---
2.) Almost never - gankers focus completely on damage. Really strong neut platforms such as Bhaalgorns are too slow and don't fit through most wormholes. Most rorqs get by just fine with something like a heavy cap booster II.  
---
3.) Some rorqs forget to put drone navs in their mids, which decreases their ISK/h tremendously (their drones move slower). You only really need like 3-4 tank mods. 
---
One more piece of advice - hostiles will often use command destroyers to boosh your drones 100km away and kill them. But if something is warp scrambled, then it can't get booshed. So fit one or two scrams as well to protect your expensive excavators. They make up most of your value, so keep them safe!
---
Song list?
---
I used to do that so I could use a cheaper fit. But refitting 3 ships to MJD while you're in a mild panic after there's a new signature and probes on dscan takes too long imo.
---
Better to spend half a bil on c-types and keep the mjd all the time imo.

Fixed in 4 days after this with a nice write-up, after initial 3 answers  that this is not their network and they don't care"        
---
Got this as an advice and it actually helped to solve the issue pretty fast.
---
Tell me which of these complaints falls under the motivation of fear and greed? And which falls under the category of broken game. 
---
Do you remember doomsdays through cynos? What about week-long skill cues every time there was a patch? How about logging in 4 hours before a fight to ensure your side loaded grid first, and then just slaughtering ships as they spawned one at a time? Or arriving late, staring at a black screen for 20 minutes, and finding out you dropped a bunch of skill points cuz you forgot to update your clone? Winmatar? 
---
Players choose to proliferate capitals. Players choose to inject skill players shoes to sign off their game to some mega Empire which doesn't give a fuck about their narrative. Players choose to protect their gains through an unending web of alliances. Players choose to value ISK over gameplay. 
---
I'm not saying these things aren't problem, I have my bones to pick with game design, but ultimately these are all excuses for player choices.

Why are you discounting the fact that a lot of us are downvoting you because you deserve it?
---
CCP still haven't replied to his petition asking for clarification on his ban. It happened in January, and he got teleported within the last few weeks I don't really remember. 
---
Actual joke company.
---
I think we agree quite a bit. Again you are 100% right the game from a technical standpoint was way worse 10 years ago. 
---
Here is optimal game play today though.
---
1. Recuit everyone you can
---
2. Spam citadels to make invasion impossibly annoying
---
3. Have all your players that don't quit because the game is boring mine in rorquals
---
4. Buy as many supercaps as possible 
---
5. Use injectors to repeat steps 3 and 4 forever
---
The fact that players choose to do this is a huge problem. However, it was not possible to choose this playstyle 10 years ago since the tools to do this didn't exist. Ultimately CCP is responsible because they designed the game is such a way that the optimal play style is boring.
---

Watching you troll him is like watching a 2 day old Venture in Lowsec getting clubbed by a faction frig.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
It truly is a bold move. Being sort of the enemy of skill u while they existed I must commend them on how they came into and out of the scene. respect.
---
That was a spicy looking fight. The idea to put a mobile depot beside the dreads was pretty smart tbh. Wormhole are love, wormholes are life. :)
---
I'm not asking for fair, I totally get the standpoint of the home owner. But just bringing an I-Win button like that and qq'ing in local when we don't take the fight is comical.
---
And if you all just want a blue nullsec to milk caps and station spin because the people who gave you all fights quit, well, I wonder why you play EVE and not another game where the PVE isn't braindead boring.
---
Eve has been waning for a long time, but I'd point out numbers always go down over the summer.  It's likely numbers will go up again someday due to the added player base from Asia.
---
According to some lore sources, it's actually the pod doing the scan and transfer. So imagine this; your big evil meanie is on a land leave, your hero sneaks onto the ship and somehow manipulates the pod (I'd suggest a virus on the firmware). I'm pretty sure you could as well put a bomb in it. I'm pretty sure the capsuleer is a protein shake before his brain could be scanned and transferred. The mobile copy ability was pretty much unique to Dusters.
---
Or you just shoot him in the head as soon as you spot him.
---
Roll all non statics
---
Have a cloaked alt sitting besides static
---
I quit in ~2015 but at the time knew i would always he back. Then i heard skill injectors came out and knew i would never be back.
---
Ah, thanks for the context.  I'm fairly ignorant of the history of null sec design decisions.  Does it not seem like it facilitates far too much scaling of income via multiboxing and botting to you though?
---
Pretty sure them and panfam got defeated in  UALX-3
---
Pretty hard to hate something that's irrelevant. Nice meme though.
---
D-scan... a lot...
---
Yeah, that's the point, we all work together. Do you know what "switch sides" means?
---
There are certainly lots of games with staying power.
---
A lot of space to be re-taken and made into the Russian lands again, my friend
---
They won this isk war and the objective, how is that a defeat?
---
Its just anouther 'eve is dead' post by an uninformed high/lowsec player,  who will likely jump up n down say he was in an alliance in null sec before 
---
Ultimately shit player with shit opinions
---
guessing you live in low classed wormholes ? ( if you've been in c5 or c6 you don't post such questions )  
---
Assume you know basics of wormholes ( static holes, difference of wormholes between w-spaces, .. etc ).
---
As you are running sites with rattle snakes, you can bring mobile depots in your ship cargo and install it upon landing on the site.  
---
Once something shows up in your d-scan, wormholes or whatever, you can refit your low slots to warp core stabilizers and put all loots into depots, then enemies can't touch your shiny loots if the depot's been fully deployed. Depots can be reinforced by hostiles though, enemies can't destroy it for a day and usually you can take them back safely 24 hours later. Needless to say once you see something, just warp to structures.
---
Another tips is that you'd be better to roll the holes before running sites.  
---
if you live in C2 or C3, you can collapse each static with 4 higgsrigged battleships and can be done in -15 mins with 2 toons. Once current statics been rolled out, the new static won't be "connected" to anywhere else unless someone initiate warp to the new spawned static. It means you can artificially make your wspace isolated and can run sites relatively safe. However, random wormholes spawn, or other w-space inhabitants may artificially open their static upon your space. So, watch cosmic signatures while running, and if you see something new signatures spawn, get off with method above mentioned.
---
20bil isk = wallet 
---
:sun_with_face:
---
No if you list public there is still some large fees. You need to find a buyer then make a private contact that will only cost 10k
---
You’re safe to travel by pod in empire space, nobody can interdict you or point you. You need to be on the watch for smartbombers but they are a threat even if you’re in a corvette, shuttle, or shitfit travel frig.
---
You’re an idiot. Private contracts have this only.
---
No u
---
You’re wrong and I don’t give a fuck either
---
No they are "conquering" the space.
---
The same can be said about life... The so-called Optimal away is boring as fuck. 
---
I think CCP can definitely do better. But the players are going to have to want better. The players wanted injectors, wanted asset safety, wanted anom spawns, wanted anything that would decrease risk and increase profit.
---
if you find a bot in Period Basis and Feythabolis, please tell the diplos of TEST. they are generally interested in keeping the regions in their control clean.
---
Omist is now Mango region, I doubt you would already find a lot of bots there ..
---
1) please try to spell correctly 2) he was typing not talking
---
I engage in honorable pvp on the daily, but in lowsec with less blobs. I'm not in pl btw.
---
Shouldn't take pl flair seriously at this point.
---
the idea that one side isn't fighting is false and dumb join a team and get out there why are you ratting lmao
---
Not sure if the OP is trolling / baiting, but if that's not the case I would suggest to search a bit more about how a Rorqual is supposed to be used / flown / fitted, instead of taking the first advice from Reddit. Make sure to understand some basic EvE mechanics first before jumping into Rorqs.
---
The clone wasn't high-quality enough. The Navy forgot to upgrade it.
---
&gt; From 2015 to 2016, the EBIDTA number jumped 25.6%, from $30,980,618 to $38,935,538. In 2014, the EBIDTA was only $9,720,723. "
---
CCP: Problem? We see no problem here.
---
Dunno, I don't fuck with null bullshit.
---
I think there was a spreadsheet available specifically for asset safety 'default' stations,  but I cannot find it now. :/
---
"Come to providence where we will awox you! We're NRDS btw~"
---
not sure if flair baited...but i'll bite.
---
winning the objective, after a week of timers and three battles, only to have the objective replaced immediately (iirc) is pretty much the problem with the current meta.
---
obviously holding the field, as the bad buys^^(TM) did in the case of UALX-3, should have some reward / benefit but allowing the objective to be immediately replaced takes most incentive to kill it away. Similarly as to what is going on in the north right now. If it were not for the propaganda victory i'm not sure there is much reason to grind down the regions that will be re-settled as soon as the spodbrains go home.
---
It's you to other people, but the you died when the scan fried your brains. The thing walking around with your memories thinking it's you is just a meatbag who had his gray matter reorganised. From his perspective, though, he's you.
---
well the objective was to dont let legacy have a keepstar there, yet 24h later there was a keepstar. 7 days later the war was lost for them (they had to get out there first)
---
to much RMT going on these days for the top tier of leadership to abdicate their positions.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
yeah this is my truth telling account
---
You write code to create a map like that using the data provided by the ESI.
---
I imagine https://esi.evetech.net/ui/#/Sovereignty/get_sovereignty_map is part of it.
---
Stop trying to be safe and just run the sites. The quicker you get over the fear of losing space pixel the more fun you have in game.
---
It's is much easier to remap scan to space bar. Pleb.
---
How does NRDS factor into that? Obviously an invading force, who has publicly declared war on us, will be on our red list.
---
I have seen some lazy modafakas but this blew my mind.
---
If your going to quote Timon and Pumba from the metashow at least give them credit. 
---
It's actually amazing seeing the koolaid-chugging retards like you regurgitating almost word for word whatever your cult leader tells you on reddit the next day. 
---
Fucking Yikes.
---
Hum, i was going to say that the S2n Citizens sov drop by a rogue director was larger, but actually they only dropped 207 systems.
---
o7 SkillU.
---
You get paper and some crayons, then at them.
---
I could have only ever gotten one or two of them in any case, and getting their FC as they ran away felt like a good move to make. Wasn't like I was ever going to pin the whole lot of them down.
---
I've got some better ideas for next time tho :)
---
I've only ever seen anything like this with angels rats not with sanshas. Unfortunately my solution was to leave the angels area and go to the sanshas area.
---
Do you mean the S2N Citizens sov drop during the Fountain war?
---
That one dropped 207 Systems and 43 stations.
---
pretty sure goons had a bigger sov drop than this back in the day when they forgot to pay the sov bill
---
Never ever launched probes while trying to D-scan.
---
Basically, you are immortal as long as you have an active clone. Back in a day it was possible to not have an up to dated clone, so you'd lose your SP (I'm not kidding). 
---
Lore wise, according to EVE Source, it's possible to kill a capsuleer if outside of the pod and no backup clone is active. In case he is killed, backup clone is activated with recent memory bank available. If no such clone is available, he is gone. But I guess most capsuleers can afford such service.
---
Nice!
---
This hurts my eyes
---
Problem with eve is infinite player scalability. You can have a limitless number of players in a nullsec region. Its actually appalling how long this shits gone on. I hubs need to die And be reworked in their entirety along with anoms. Nullsec needs site and anom limits you shouldnt be able to spawn 15 pirate anoms every few mins. In EVERY FUCKING SYSTEM. But this goes along with an anom rework cuz only three of them are worth anything
---
Rallys dens and haven/sanctums. Literally no reason to run anything else.
---
There is no reason to fight anyone unless they come to fight you. You can pick a region and just park it. Between citadel spam and caps being the norm I can say I dont want to be involved in this shit. Il go hide back in my wh thanks. Nullsec is cancer for eve, between instant wealth generation and infinite sites its absurd. 
---
We need a real resource war but I fear its to late and goons will just take any "rich" region thats left standing after glassing the whole cluster. After panfam amd NCDock die Goons has no one.. Test is the only OTHER group that could even think about competing and their "friends" 
---
This isnt even a hate goons thing this is a fucking ccp cant see the problems in their own game thing. And its probably to late to fix it.
---
Capsuleers can store their conscience in backup banks. They will wake up, but will not have a memory of why did they wake up.
---
All that PayPal RMT up for grabs
---
RCC
---
Lol arfuss
---
Yeah you get intact armor plates which are worth a lot
---
Besides a murderous bean and a suspension setting, what's castor?
---
Last time is why I said tempted lmao. Fuck being leadership in this game.
---
it's almost as if history doesn't change because some one else is telling it.
---
If perchance I am able to obtain some of your personal possessions?
---
&gt; wormholer btw
---
But what's the motivation
---
While I can't speak for Karmafleet/Brave, I can firmly say that Brand NewBros doesn't compare well to HORDE for brand new players.   
---
Horde has:
---
* Better handouts - a carepack with ships/books vs. asking for individual items in TEST Free
---
* Better help during actual fleets - NBI caretakers in Horde have a special mumble channel to help guide new-folks 
---
* Better new-player questions channel 
---
* Better access to Moon-mining - Horde has an out-of-game calendar, organized newbean mining-fleets, and far, far more moons
---
* Actual EVE classes besides Ron's twice-a-year tackle class
---
* Better access to PvP itself. Horde space is full of roaming gangs and solos, in Geminate you can actually find fights. You're never bored in standing fleet   
---
That said, TEST overall is a stronger alliance, and is much better if you're trying to grind your way to a Titan.  The SRP is better, the alliance is richer, allied with Goons etc. etc.
---
Yes, I just started playing EVE (about a month ago) and this is the most disheartening thing I've discovered. I love the game, but I feel like I'm about ten years too late lol
---
talk to John Hartley
---
I'm not sure if the content is ment to be soloed
---
&gt; Gay F Kay
---
;)
---
What's the J-space system number? Was hoping to take a look at your fit and maybe offer some personal advice
---
It's one of those questions that I feel like I'd rather not think too hard about because I can never come to a conclusion. It's like the question of "Who am I?". Is it your personality, experiences and emotions? Or is it the piece of flesh that you are made of? Or is it the particles and atoms interacting with each other and the universe a certain way that you form a consciousness and have thoughts and emotions? Then I get depressed because I realize how weak a person's sense of "self" is, how if one of these particles somehow was out of place your "self" could be completely different or destroyed. Or how you may think your body belongs to you, but everything that makes up your body...the carbon and hydrogen atoms don't "care" about you, and exist to exist. See, I don't really even know what I'm talking about anymore :D. That's why I'd rather not think about it or just think about "me" and my body as the anime Cells at Work portrays it.
---
Actually they are not, jb's even pre fatigue at least made you extremely vulnerable with no cloak or 30km off the gate bullshit. You also could not take them if bubbled. So even in the old example the new ones are significantly more powerful.
---
IIRC changing to interval one will limit the fps to the refresh rate of your monitor
---
&gt; EVE is better than it has ever been. Its player base continues to get worse. Maybe stop blaming the game for bad players.
---
:)
---
I know that feeling!
---
You're totally right, we should complete the blue donut as quickly as possible. Also, who cares about bringing life to null or having an isolated region thats full of smaller groups that aren't some bloc's pets. 
---
What was I thinking?!?
---
Former null-seccer though.
---
ISKWAR: WON ☑
---
OBJECTIVE: WON ☑
---
KEEPSTAR: DESTROYED ☑
---
TRAPPED: ☐ This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
Why? SOV sucks (literally all SOV alliances do it complain about how they need a structure timer to fight) they will just get titan blobbed. We want people to enjoy the game, not quit in frustration.
---
highsec, lowsec, and small nullsec corps/alliances should move to WH space. In WH space they can get good fights, do industry, make the best isk in the game, and not be cap blobbed. If they are afraid of not being able to get to highsec they can even get a highsec static. The choice is a no brainer.
---
Yeah it does for certain monitors but it picks the lowest refresh screen to put on all.  
---
I got 1 242hz monitor and 2x 60 and using interval one lets every client play on 60 fps.  
---
Which is not too bad but I'd rather have some flexibility in this
---
Thanks for this too - anything in particular from the above that you disagree with?
---
I've looked at eveuni fits and I've also asked corpmates for their fits - but obviously some  people don't want to share their fit for Intel reasons...or on the other end of the scale the ones that did share are super blinged and not really comparable for Baby's First Rorq'. Just looking for more info to compare and decide what to do.
---
It's almost like you're a retard and too dumb to know it.
---
Funny how last week the line was that ncpl were hypocrites for mocking you guys for running away in wwb but are now doing the same thing...but now it's not the same thing anymore, now when *you* ran away it was brave and clever but when nc won't fight outnumbered 2-1 they are cowards.
---
What a coincidence that history seems to have changed just after mittani makes an grandiose speech about it, telling his loyal morons what to think.
---
You're preaching to the choir here, friend.
---
But null exists and some noobs in empire would probably like to explore the option without being pets or being blobbed.
---
Right now, highsec noobs with an interest in null are generally filtered into only 3 or 4 noob friendly corps in major power blocs. But blocs are what create the blue donut that everyone complains about.
---
So...... already replaced?
---
" While still in the ‘planning phase’, " Who didn't read it? Lenny was already in motion at that time...
---
Eve was always dying, just for different reasons.
---
Lol i liked the sub cap brawl. I was in a munin and archon.
---
nobody disputes that goons ran to the south.
---
but pretending they did it before the war started, like is the current situation in the north simply isn't true, as i just pointed out.
---
But why though? Hisec and wh get the same types of moon ore. If you are dropping rorquals why wouldnt you join an established null group. The only thing wh does for industry is allow reactions, but an isolated .4 will get you that without all the risk. You can even jf your fuel and materials in easier then transiting a wh.
---
Not to mention all the asset safety for low and hisec stations and cits. Why would industry go to wh over blue null?
---
I remember all those dank fights in saranen
---
this line still resonates when i hear 2018
---
no sabre u nder hand to take his high grade slave set
---
Love how this is the go to argument for anything that fixes nullsec. Love how no one is allowed to have an opinion unless your in a block.
---
I can agree he may not know what hes talking about but unfortunately hes right. Nullsec is boring and beyond that to god damn easy. You undock and tada have sites to run dont have to look for nothing nullsec is the instant gratification part of eve beyond injectors you dont have to do anything for your content sept maybe deploy when told to.
---
yes  give us disco bubbles   aka festial  bubbles! they would  launch   probe that  transforms into giant disco ball that can be interacted. bumped shooted  with no concord resonse
---
Was that in QRBN-M?
---
Thank you for the clarification. It's been a long time since I read the novel.
---
How do you multisell with 0% broker fees?
---
No I'm not and good for you now we have an understanding
---
The answer is interval one period
---
lmfao
---
The problem with wormholes is it takes too long to find pew pew and you can't really spend a few days without playing.
---
It requires far too much time to do anything.
---
I don’t know how that’s true. My Corp almost is exclusively small kitchen sink fleets (2-15 people depending on the day) and there’s plenty of content. Mostly in wormholes though.
---
brokers fee is 0% with immediate sales
---
What about that multiple sales at once?
---
respect .o7
---
[You need to roll your static more.](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006690/)
---
Soo if your casual join a block like PH or someone else with no fleet requirements.
---
But for your LIFE in eve I highly suggest wh space. They are usually a lot more tight nit than NS or mostly anywhere else for that matter. But have requirements for skills amd ships even play time some times. Theses are there to encourage playing with friends in the right ship.
---
Ns is great for making isk but you wont make friends you will make comrade in arms not "friends" ns is for money wh is for fun.
---
You can select multiple items and sell them all at once immediately as long as there are enough buy orders from other players. 
---
And brokers fee will be 0%.
---
Something something abyssal mods.
---
&gt; We have Serenity as a perfect example of TQ's future, yet CCP does nothing to avoid such a situation. 
---
Widespread botting played a massive role in the direction Serenity took, so it is far from the perfect model for TQ
---
CCP actively combats botting on TQ, so they are in fact doing something to avoid such a situation
---
All it takes is a couple words in a search bar and you can find out what's going on. Or even look up that history you admit to not knowing.
---
I wouldn't call GOTG pets, I would just say - *like everyone else* \- they just don't like you.
---
&gt; a just leader to rule over them all
---
excuse me, but we already have the savior of highsec; James 315
---
What dude? I has ambitions
---
Hijacking to spread the good word. ( although the good word has been preached by most vets for a long time if you want any small change in this world you have to bash your head against the wall 5000 times because of density of baballing baboons who think they are clever) 
---
While 2009 - 2012 was arguably peak eve in terms of META I don't think a change as specific as warp speed is worth the top post on this thread. 
---
The reason EVE is dying is because CCP are absolutely clueless as to why this game is so enduring. I am sure some of the devs understand but the company's actions indicate otherwise. The hilarious thing is the only changes holding the game back are essentially minor code changes. Eve has the potential to be a timeless game if the devs stopped trying to cater towards casuals. 
---
1. Fun fact PVE in eve is horrible. If you are autistic ( you are actually autistic if you enjoy PVE in this game, this is not an insult (#metoo) but after playing eve for 11 years its fairly obvious these players are on the hard spectrum , ( further evidence can be seen on EVE's twitch channels). Stop trying to make PVE expansions (apocrypha is the only example of a PVE expansion that worked because guess what it was predicated on hardcore PVP). It won't work no matter how many pretty lights and effects you add. The fundamental mechanics of eve do not warrant a good PVE experience.  
---
2. Remove interdiction nullification. Again this will get flack because a lot of you are fucking mongos who have no sense of repercussions and large scale effects. Look at PVP experience in null sec entry systems before intys had this role. Literally every null sec entrance was easy and FAST PVP. YOU LITERALLY COULD GET FIGHTS THE SECOND YOU LOGGED ON. No roaming for 5 hours to only catch VNI's. Also if you like hunting crabbers with your nullificed ceptor, fuck you and your horribly boring play style that dose not serve towards the long term health of game. EVE needs these areas to foster the small gang community again that was once so great. 
---
3. Citadels should drop 50 % loot. If you dont think at least 50 % should drop your the cancer that is killing this game. Literally you should be ashamed of yourself and not play eve online. People need reasons to fight. This is eve online for christs sack.
---
4. Reintroduce passive moon mining on moons. Literally add a module that automatically mines like 20-15% of the total rock duration. Eve if the income is low 1-5 bil a month players will still start fighting over these structures again and create more reasons for war. Autistic miners can still mine them. But now pvp focused alliance dont have to endure playstyles that only serve to make them quit.  
---
5. titans and supers are another massive problem but beyond my understanding. 
---
tldr: reintroduce mechanics that add levity and purpose and fun and meaning to eve again. eve is not fun to play anymore. its a hassle with little consequences for your action.s
---
Haha, this brought back some fond memories
---
Tbh I only downvoted both comments because I saw him complaining about some "downvote brigade"
---
It definitely can be.
---
Why sell to buy orders though
---
They skilled themselves very well on this
---
This is way too deep for r/eve.
---
This
---
We might hate the changes, but as long as profits are going up, why would CCP care. Player base plays a part in this, If you drop massive amounts of money into anything other than Plex or game time, your part of what makes CCP direct their attension to other areas rather than player retension. If there was anthing remotly close to what EVE is, it would have seen mass migration ages ago. CCP are just lucky there is no competition and that the guys running elite dangerious have a die hard set of idiots who want ED to be everything EVE isnt.
---
or, how about the null sec groups come and roam low sec like the old days
---
Thanks. I keep forgetting to save the latest version.
---
Well as a new player myself I can say that I was attracted to eve by the whole hardcore nature of it. Within my first week, I decided to try out scamming in Jita and within 10 minutes somebody bought it and I was 1 billion isk richer than before (the guy who bought it was a character of several years btw). New players like the hardcore elements of eve because they are what made us start playing in the first place.
---
Sorry for the dumb questions, I know PH is pandemic horse, wh is worm hole, but what are the others like NS?
---
Since I have a previous omega character with over 5mil skill points, is it worth making a new alpha character focusing in certain ships and activities? Like one for exploring and relics? And one for fighting?
---
That sov will stay "wild" until the first group with supers moves in.  
---
Maybe some small corp will take some of that sov for a while, but in the end one of the bigger neighbours will be like "oh look, structure kills".  
---
There is no reason a High/Lowsec corp should invest time and assets for a temporary landgrab. To settle down you need a house and null is full of entities that have taken down every house in the last couple years, just because they could.  
---
You also seem to forget that the space that just got available is not exactly easy to access, so unless you wanna go rogue-like and build everything locally, you need to set up a jf chain as well.
---
Interval 2 should divide that in half, and 3 should quarter it. So you probably want interval 3.
---
Highsec direct holes means you don't even need to deal with JFs and a Nyx that wants to kill that JF. In C5 space you can bring an entire frighter in to system. A charon can fit a lot of stuff in it.
---
WHs are better than HS or LS because you get the NS citadel rig bonuses in WHs. Sure, you don't get the R64 goo, but that isn't what made moon mining worth doing. It's all about getting the +15% ABC ores in WHs. Also, PI is slamming in WHs.
---
You don't get a supercap umbrella to protect your rorqs. But your enemies are limited by WH mass to try to kill your rorquals. You don't have the same issue because all your defensive ships are already in system. Even in C5 space the max an enemy can bring is something around 3 caps and a ~30 ship subcap fleet. You just have to out form that in your home system. Easy to do because you can cap blob.
---
Asset safety is a safelogged frighter or cap. Easy to do from tether. You just scan it out later.
---
Yep
---
I am actually for completing the blue donut as quicklly as possible over some alliances who want to bring life to null getting crushed and quitting the game.  
---
Maybe CCP will change something up once blue donut is archieved.
---
To name yet another reason why IT companies squealed so loudly about GDPR "What you mean we have to actually answer to our customers? Like *peasants?"*
---
Pandemic horde. Wormholes and nullsec.
---
Using your previous is a good idea but depending on what hes skilled for you may want an alpha for other stuff. 
---
Highly recomend running exploration and pve explo. Where most of the isk is in K space *known space not wormholes*
---
Agreed 100% - The risk vs reward is all out of wank atm, there's hardly any risk around
---
Your so wrong. Eve was changed to cater to empires and so empires it has. If you think there arnt players out there that would love to oppose those groups... your completly mistaken, how do you imagine they go about doing that? Infinite resources are another plague allowing large enitities to prosper where ever they be and with no motivation to do much else.
---
sounds like intel channel
---
The common theme across all of them was that, pvp is not the same, they felt that their play style was not important to eve. Is it their fault they didn't want to blue half the entire game? Is it their fault they just wanted to have a small pocket of sov? You can't do that today, not unless you suck goons, NC, TEST, FRT cock. There is no place for the small people. If you're okay with more people leaving eve, then okay, that's fine. Just don't delude yourself eve is a real sandbox anymore when the only thing you find in the game is "who can build the most titans, let me boson you gang, LOL ROFL GIT GUD."
---
Goons didn't take any strategic fights they had no chance of winning at any point in wwb. That is exactly the same as whats happening in the north right now. 
---
And fwiw the 'north' are not (yet) leaving the warzone. They are moving out of SH1 because it's about to get cutoff from friendly space.
---
Glad someone is genuinely enjoying such a feature instead of whining and feeding us salty teard
---
I get it, but small groups are unable to hold SOV. The big groups don't care about your small group when they can rent your systems for a bil a month. The small group can't fight back against a titan blob. It's just not going to happen. I would rather direct them to a place where they can own their own system and do what they want in that system without being slaughtered by the blue donut.
---
Even with post like these showing actually data alot of people will ignore it and say eve is dying is totally a xd meme
---
Are you in a decent sized corp, just ask there say you will beat perimeter price.
---
Objective was to kill the keep, not their fault keeps are cheap enough legacy can just drop more
---
Every time someone thinks small groups will grab sov to make null more exciting, the opposite happens. I'm pretty jaded about it now.
---
You don't need to use your light drones on every wave, just the very first wave of the site.
---
The objective was to kill the keepstar legacy had anchored. After it died, so many supers/titans were trapped that there was no chance to stop legacy anchoring another. Call it what you will but if those supers/titans had been able to extract the second anchoring would have been contested as well. 
---
To the extent that legacy anchored a keep there, winterco/panfam/skillU lost. But the objective for that fight was still achieved.

Borderlands 3 Sept 2K19
---
Many reasons.   
---
1. Someone is dumb and buying at inflated prices.  
---
2. You save those fees if the price differences between buy and sell aren't huge  
---
3.The time you spend trying to sell stuff over long term might turn against you  
---
4. You might spend more time managing orders than getting more stuff to sell.
---
We've been completely removed from our space 3 times, and no entity has had the common fucking sense to chase us when we try to resettle to twist the knife.
---
Not our fault y'all are fucking idiots.
---
[I'm sorry friend didn't make it](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77308678/)
---
Because trying to beat 0.001 isk market bots is very inneficient, i'd rather spend the time salvaging more.
---
Not everyone wants to update sell orders for the rest of their life
---
*shrug*
---
this is literally the very first instance in eve's 15+ year history where one of the big entities has literally given up on a war *before the war had even began*.
---
Not sure "your game sucks, we quit" is the type of history CCP wants to be made

Quick background and then hopefully simple question that has most likely been asked.
---
I've been playing on and off since 2004, I know the ropes for the most part. I recently came back after a very long break. I think the Siege of Jita was the last time I played. It seems all the third party fitting tools are outdated now.
---
I'm not looking to get very serious, I wanna mine and mission around High Sec for awhile, make some isk and then maybe just maybe join a corp and go back to Null and do some Pvp like the old days. I'm currently Alpha player.
---
I want to be able to import my toon, load up a ship, it's fittings and see what skills I need to fit it out and run it efficiently. What app can do that now?
---
Pfya and EvEMon don't seem to do that or I don't know how to run those apps anymore.
---
Thanks very much.

Find 15-20 people willing to leave your coalition and start a fresh corp. move near provi or lowsec and start roaming around.
---
Imagine what would happen if as few as 10 corps spawned from this. Be the change you want to see.
---
Injectors are certainly not helping.
---
Right, because KILLING off alliances and groups, while chasing them with their pants down is such an eve thing to do.
---
Because often times you make just as much money by removing fees as you would fighting the autistic 1 cent battle. 
---
Also market bots are a thing.
---
and 5. You suspect the price is dropping

I love goons. I can use big toys and if I lose them the worst that can happen is someones has a laugh about it. Unlike other groups where the KB must be green

they'd get farmed to fuck by the existing entities.
---
FPS limiter, preferably one with a slider and/or a box you could write any number you wanted, would be amazing. Especially for people with g-sync monitors, or people who use many clients at the same time  
---
I've relied on 3rd party programs to cap my FPS in eve for a decade now and I wish I didn't have to
---
Wasn't BoB bigger?
---
None of that is better or easier then low/highsec though. Never a bad/far hs connection, never not know if there is that fleet waiting to drop on your rorquals, 
---
Sure there is the PI boost, but its more difficult to get out, and finding one with good planets is harder then shipping in from the local hub. When you say "smaller corps" you are really talking about medium sized, being 30+ which is above the general pve limits of a c4 or lower wh.

Castor was the first named content release, with one of the key features being the addition of the first special Tech 2 components and ships through research agents, and improvements and tweaks to the mission system launched in earlier patches.[2] During the pre- and post- Castor patch cycle Eve players saw the introduction of conquerable stations in 0.0 security (lawless space) systems, the introduction of the agent mission running system, and the introduction of various NPC agents to help players gain in-game currency and faction standing through missions, the EVE equivalent of quests in other MMO's
---
End pvp is being in horde or htp/simple farmers. Content 24/7. Why bother with wormholes if you always want geminate, catch or provi. Thera you get signal to scan for you though
---
Sounds like a really fun way to soend my time in thos vodeogame
---
Took me a while to get a round to watching it but nice video.  Quite the slug fest.
---
i agree with several ppl here that blame the infinite resources per region for a lot of the problems, and i had been thinking about it for quite some time
---
my ideas revolve around making balancing easier for ccp: i'd say retire the ihub, and instead place a unique-per-system citadel with new service modules: 
---
\- asteroid scanning array: once per day, it can spawn an asteroid cluster similar to the anomalies; profile setting for a time window in which it can be triggered; spawns \*all\* the ore that's permitted for a system at once. goal is to enable ccp to have a single point for adjustments on how many ppl a region can support mining-wise, as well as allowing players to spawn the minable stuff in their time zone
---
\- intrusion detection array: custom mission generator; decide upon a "pool size" for enemy ships; generates randomized spawns within about that limit, +-x% because risk/profit. for example, a 1000 point pool could pick 3 "close group of 10 frigates" for 50 points each, 5 "distant group of 5 scram/web frigates" for 80 points each, and 1 group of "intermediate range placed group of 30 battleships" for 500 points (exceeding the 1000 point pool a bit for a nasty surprise); you can adjust the pool size to match your party, and might get some logi in as well to punch above your weight class. also, it could mix in the improved ai stuff (and enemy logi) with higher point costs. a bounty modifier would be linked to the security status of the system. his would generate an anomaly like the current ones; anomalies without players in them despawn after 5 minutes, and cause the character who triggered that anomaly to get some cooldown (possibly similar to jump fatigue?). goals: make botting more difficult, make pve sites more vulnerable to surprise pvp by not having the probe scanner cluttered with them, make pve more interesting, make pve a group event
---
as with the tcu replacement structure lateron, i'd make it have weak shields, moderate armor and strong hull, to allow for some commerce suppression tactics (as the services go offline for several days once it gets into the final timer)
---
another thing could then be to limit alliance sov to a single region - with exceptions: for example, for a modest fee in isk+plex, an alliance could hold a single constellation in an adjacent region as well (with the option to extend that before the permit expires); for different fees, packages could permit temporary claim over a system, constellation or region further out, though those might need to be limited to not permit permanent occupation, but for varying durations to enable campaigns to invade another area to live there, or disrupt an enemy. goal here would be to create stress points between the different alliances, so coalitions could be forced to always defend a "weak link" and possibly break apart; also, isk sink and possible income generator for ccp linked with how attractive it is for players to invade each other, so that they've got an incentive to make/keep things interesting ;)
---
the final idea for sov would be the tcu replacement structure: in sov space without this structure, citadels have no reinforcement timers (and possibly no damage cap? though it might force the attacker to split up their forces, opening them up to defeat in detail) - so once this structure falls, it'll be possible to raze the entire system in one go; goal: make non-sov space more defendable by making attackers grind all the timers; make sov invasions easier by having a limited amount of grinding before a major fight. i'd probably make that structure also have weak shields, moderate armor and strong hull, to limit the resources needed to commit to the initial timer, though the second timer would need more serious commitment, and the final timer would be the all out fight for the system, no holds barred.
---
We roam low sec with 5-10 cruisers are smaller every day. There are plenty of good fights out there...
---
I played in AHARM back in the day. It takes forever to find anything meaningful. Also, rolling hole already implies you're blobbing. I do solo or at most 2 or 3 people.
---
And now it will be consumed by the 2 remaining powerblocks. So this is it for eve, eh? Only Provi remains as a small sov holding entity.....
---
Brisc knows daddy Trump, Nolak does not. Good luck.
---
There's a thousand different ways to play this game. If you want to play goon clone or goon Slayer then I guess you have a serious problem to solve. 
---
I've stayed out of that klusterfuk for a long time. But it involves a lot more work in a lot more risk than joining the blue donut. 
---
I'm glad the big blue donut exists. I welcome entities which can smother me in super capitals. I wouldn't be able to play these interesting storylines on the edges of power if the universe didn't have large and stable power blocks.
---
I think a lot of people believe the only game worth playing is the large power block. They dream of some world where the universe is a constant shift of wars, but as soon as it is their ass on the line they want insurance. For them the game will always be dead because they hate losing but believe everyone else should take a turn losing. 
---
I'm currently getting my ass kicked by a group that is simply far better. It is the most fun I've had since I got evicted from Geminate while in WI.
---
nobody cares about 5-10 cruisers.
---
150-200 people who have aspirations to be the next null sec power block are a different thing.
---
You forgot the part about the new meta of real pvp, out forming the other side and watch them stand down. Then feel good that you won a fight that never happened.
---
I sell my salvage regularly and I rarely do I sell to buy orders.  
---
You are right, sometimes the margins suck and it isn´t worth it but oftentimes, especially when selling huge quantities, you can make decent extra ISK by selling via sell orders.  
---
And T2 salvage sells pretty quickly, so I never have to do too much 0.1 isking.
---
But each to their own.
---
you went out of your way to make fun of me putting "y'all" in a comment and then you go and post this i don't even know where to begin deconstructing this fucking masterpiece my guy
---
Gotcha. I will get a new alpha trained up for Rifter/Tristan specifically. I think my og character has good exploration skills
---
Move to a wormhole mate. Come be a mighty bean. No not the test corp

Quality bait is an EvE essential. XD

I really enjoyed salvaging and selling loot when I first started playing eve. Set me on the trading road very early on. Good Times.

Keeps are replaceable but being made to look like a bitch after being an unstoppable force for so long has got to sting. I'd say they lost more than we did that day
---
Those small corps are healthy where they are. If they take a bit of null and then get dumpstered by groups 3000x thier size they will all just quit. Null is broken right now and no one should be encouraging small groups to go there.

Pot, kettle, black.

Why, so they can deal with gate guns and sec status drops? No thanks. 
---
How about CCP fix the game!
---
Yea, it's okay to roam. It's NOT okay, however, to try and upset the current horrible state of massive powerblocks. Stop trying to have fun already.
---
&gt; It's NOT okay, however, to try and upset the current horrible state of massive powerblocks. 
---
it is ok to upset them - just don't be upset when they kick you in the face for doing so.
---
:)))))
---
there is hope
---
That is not a war, that is goons grinding sov/structures when the defenders evac.
---
Also loot fairy said too hell with your Pith-C invul
---
This guy gets it
---
With the amount of supers and titans the 2 powerblocks have? Yeah good luck grabbing and defending that small plot of land.
---
I separate salvage out into cheap shit I'll just sell to buy orders, and the more expensive stuff, I market.
---
Right now salvage is selling for an all-time high plus if you make the right rigs you can double or triple what they're worth.
---
I grab everything sometimes reprocessing some of the cheap junk will give you materials to make other things.
---
I'm just glad I could be part of the worst(best) awoxers and gankers in high-sec before CCP decided to nerf awoxing to oblivion and buff AFK tank in high-sec before the active players in high-sec plummeted. 
---
You can argue there's still average 30,000 players online compared to 60,000 as it was \~6 years ago, but as a person who is acutely aware of the current high-sec traffic of freighters, haulers and other ships that might be too expensive to fly, it's not a 50% drop in traffic, more like 85% drop. The players online nowadays arent just players, but they are players with more active accounts, and they sure as hell aren't on high-sec anymore either.
---
Surely this would mean I should go to null and experience what is out there, but to be honest, I don't think that I would enjoy it more than high-sec shenanigans.
---
Didn't know that, thanks.
---
Ah, a decent bit before my debut in 2009 then.
---
ok, there's shit being shot all over nullsec. it's still not dull and lifeless, there's still plenty going on - what you want to call it is irrelevant.
---
Thats not how that works ^^
---
Not saying I know how it works but this is definitely false ^^
---
I get 60FPS on Interval 1 and 2
---
Wait I'm missing something here... Why did he eject?

Nice haul! Where were you doing the exploring?
---
Wormholes my dude
---
I'm not sure what's the bigger deal breaker for me: Borderlands 3 being an Epic Games Store exclusive, or 2K's super-invasive EULA
---
Most of that content is meaningless, like a WoW battle ground.
---
You shoot at them real hard. Or boosh them away.
---
it's a game - it's all fucking meaningless.
---
Neey, no touchy my stuff. 
---
But I might be able to get you a corp invite if you are interested in salvaging/ratting and message me your ign.
---
Neither of the things you said are true.
---
Sec status? who cares if you live in null. Gate guns? Easy to tank, or mitigate... This is why nobody wants to fight anymore, it has to be "The perfect" situation or else everyone just escalates.
---
Just means people are hunting bots or afk vni. That's the most boring and dull it can be.
---
Face it, the game is at an all time low.
---
We low sec people don't care about sov, ... Man why does every null bear think that we care?
---
We only want your corpses
---
Tinker rattles btw
---
The next group to get farmed ? I'll keep my freedom and autonomy enjoying lots of small gang PVP every day in Low. Different strokes for different folks - I'd say to you - most of us don't care about the null sec powers. It means no different to me when 2 small gangs are fighting ;)
---
So remind me again why people should roam low sec? Wtf is there to roam for?
---
&gt; Keeps are replaceable but being made to look like a bitch after being an unstoppable force for so long has got to sting
---
Only in your mind, which shows how fucked up and fragile your tiny little ego is.
---
24 manticores and   all are gone.
---
&gt; Face it, the game is at an all time low.
---
sure, but it still isn't dead and lifeless. there are still things going on in pretty much all areas of space right now.
---
I play this game to shoot other space ships...
---
buy nyx.  then fit it.  buy shadow fighters and other ones.  load 3 sets of shadows...then go tackle moros on asteroid belt while he is mining veldspar then set shadow fighters   to suicide run [flame icon]  basically one set is eoungh to kill max dps moros.  takes 3 serts for low dps max tank moros.  and no you wont be penalized with combat timer  so spew shadows kill the target and dock.
---
When all there is to do is hint bots or die to super umbrellas, then yeah it's dead.
---
This is a remarkably myopic view. There is always a bigger fish, yes. But claiming that one must have supers to play in Sov seems like an odd bar, especially since one must have sov to *build* supers (although of course you can buy one using spies, etc).
---
Imagine if half of these corps merged into a 70-100 man alliance. That’s a significant number of people.
---
Exactly, THERE ARE NO PEOPLE IN LOW SEC BECAUSE ITS SUCKS TO LIVE THERE. The thick skull is strong with this one.
---
The only problem with EVE is that it's not a FPS that you can jump in and shoot like mad.
---
In EVE you have to think about what you are doing and in many cases plan ahead for the long haul, most people these days but can't play ahead farther than lunch.
---
The veldnought rides again!
---
delve
---
I personally think its quite bad for EVE to "end" a group.
---
Even lvl 1 relic sites in upgraded nullsec can have 100m salvage in a can, probably average 50m a site but often much more
---
Blood raider regions south of amarr, I did some exploring and explorer hunting, but most of it is from salvaging sites left behind by alliance members with carriers :P
---
Overwhelming Firepower.
---
Were do i grt shadow ones? Whats the full name? I looked in jits but csnt find on market
---
They are in my experience. It's one of the reasons I let my subs lapse and quit after 11 years.
---
Doing anything alone takes hours. Staying away from the game for a week can result in a total loss. The time commitment is just as much as with everything else - especially now as the player base continues to shrink.
---
Dumb reply!what kinds? Light medium hybrids or medium?
---
I was gunna Micro Jump field them away from
---
Rorq but they have low EM resist on shield and high em resist on armor
---
If only
---
And then comes test or panfam hand some other big coalition and takes it and makes you rent it.. sad state of eve..
---
So who the hell am I fighting every day? Our roam last night killed 25 people over an hour and half. I find that pretty successful. Is that worse then bubble camping your gate or response fleets? Given my roams through Null and low, Low almost always has more people willing to fight instead of people docking up.
---
&gt; By stopping the attempts to make a new game....
---
They haven't stopped at all though, they've constantly been developing a new game since like, 2009.
---
&gt;things are in space shooting each other, the game is dead!
---
yes i have that t2  huffers gnosis. with dedicated  ship links i have way more mining yield than max  skilled venture,basically outshooting it and prospect.  calculation is easy
---
each t2 huffers has 20m3 per cycle   5 huffets = 100m3 per cycle. with links and max skills and maybe imlants  your gnosis easily overcomes  prospect and venture because venture with t2 harvesters will hae total 80m3  per cycle same goes for prospect.  
---
if gas huffing was not limited to 5 harvesters would lead to people doing that in battleships that have 8 turret hardpoints.  that would lead to 160m3 per cycle!!! 
---
now take a loot at  mining equipment  t2 miner or ORE  miner. they suck on gnosis even if it fits two of them. with no mining laser upgrades they are useless,if u put upgrade then  economically wont be profitable to use that because lower cargo  more jetcan  or often docking. .. so  use only gnosis for gas huffing
---
You guys were a damn fine alliance. Sad to see you guys go.
---
If you sell to buy orders you dont incur a brokers fee, because you're not setting up a buy or sell order. When you set up a buy/sell order you pay the owner of the structure a fee to host your order (NPC Corp or player structure). If OP has set his sell duration to 3 months instead of immediate, they would have incurred a broker's fee :)
---
well i can fit mining lasers on it or  two ice mining drones!!!
---
&gt; CCP actively combats botting on TQ
---
Lol.
---
Apparently there are those that specialize in expediting RMT cases. That's fucking hilarious. Who the fuck wrote this?
---
And Brisc Rubin. Lolololol
---
Blood raider territory (null south of Amarr).
---
I did some exploration and explorer hunting, but most of it is from salvaging sites left behind by alliance members in carriers.
---
Eve doesn't work like that anymore. 
---
you have to *have* supers to contest sov and form a "super umbrella" over ratters allowing your members to actually live in space. 
---
If you don't yet *have* supers, you can't do this, so you won't be able to make *more* supers
---
What? I use "y'all" all the time. When did I do this?
---
They didn't "figure out the optimal strategy", the game was changed to suit their game play style.  They never actually figured out anything but how to manipulate the development of the game.
---
Bookmarks inside moons are still a thing...
---
IIRC if theyre 450km or more away they get auto abandoned. its how people were stealing excavators from Miners in delve
---
You have to boosh them 500km away to disconnect, might be slightly difficult to do solo.
---
So what major null block are you part of?
---
well good news, you dont need ammo for a while
---
I was thinking about moon mining as well. And you are absolutely right about it. We as a corp used to own some moons and after the patch we simply gave them away and did not bother about conquering others since.
---
I’ve made it to the big boys
---
Jump your nyx in. They'll never know what hit em
---
You could Boosh them, then web them down. Otherwise depending on gang size you could bomb run them, need 5-7 bombers though
---
What he meant is either, scare it in to warp before pulling drones in or simply kill the ship it self. Exactly how to achieve that is for you to figure out
---
Interval Immediate: generate as many frames as possible.
---
Interval 1: Match the frame rate of the monitor. It's basically vsync.
---
There are reasons to generate more frames whan your monitor can handle, mostly to reduce screen tearing. But for Eve, you're not too likely to have problems that way.
---
"&gt;be me"
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/
---
The difference in perception between the two sides of the UALX fight is amazing. To the attackers (panfam/winterco/skill U) it was a mixed fight. Basically a wash. Shit happens. To Legacy, it was this existential fight where you guys finally proved to the game that you were a Big Deal. You weren't anyone's pets anymore, you were a big alliance that could do it all on your own and by the way you have a lot of supers too and you know how to use them.
---
That illusion was shattered over the next two weeks while your hellcamp was systematically and regularly farmed, while supers and titans escaped essentially unhindered. But you don't remember that part - what you remember is some storybook narrative about how TEST finally grew up.
---
So, basically what [/u/GrathTelkin said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c18x12/skillu_presents_biggest_sov_drop_in_eve_history/erce4db/)
---
Yeah, but who actually wants it?
---
Might be a good place for Frat to move.
---
Just curious, have you ever lived in any null sec space ?
---
the big one.
---
Agreed. it is incredibly hard to find a fight.
---
Figures, go back to rorq mining please.
---
Yuppp currently in test atm. But ive been in drones and gurista with bastion once apon a time.
---
i don't own a rorqual.
---
I think you're confusing me with [this dude](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkG2arcWwAA9H8q.jpg)
---
Perhaps the FC was trying to balancing things up? After all in one of the previous Spectre fleets in Provi the FCs ran away trying to save their own asses, leaving the rest of us to die. This time he sends rest of fleet away and stays put himself.
---
You can get quite a bit of it via [archive.org](https://archive.org), which archived the yearly dumps (\~400mb in 2006 to \~2gb/year later) for 2006 to 2011. You can get incomplete partials for later years and piece it back together. I'd link you straight to it but [archive.org](https://archive.org) is having some trouble. [eve-central.com/dumps/](https://eve-central.com/dumps/) is the URL you want to look for.
---
You can also ask CCP nicely, but it will take a looong time before they get around to it (which is totally fair). A whole bunch of people have done research papers on EVE's economy and in some of those cases CCP was kind enough to provide the raw market dumps.
---
Lol why should people from low want to go to sov? They are in low because they like lowsec more then null, don't think being in null and joining one of the blocks is the endgame.
---
Pure gold
---
Was there an event that happened then?
---
This was kinda the thing i was trying to imply here with this post. PLayers need to find a way to be better heard then CSM council. If we keep buying all the skins they offer they will think its what we want. And it is not!
---
I tried killing one drone yesterday. It was in system with 6 rorqs mining a moon. And fucking initiative dropped a phoenix on my Proteus
---
I know it's relatively small in the list of reasons to be happy to not live in China, but...well, let's add another thing to that list, shall we?
---
Yeet
---
Those are bots.
---
I cannot follow. I can set interval one on or off for each account seperately. Can you please elaborate what you are looking for? Btw your original title is missleading as you can already limit FPS and you obviously know that but you want some advanced feature which I don't understand.
---
seriously though, 2b between the 2 of us, and only 300m drops
---
You choose to play the game that way. Nobody forced you to.
---
But it doesnt match the frames of different monitors.
---
It will just pick the lowest frame screen and use that framerate.
---
Dude come on
---
Over time it’ll normalize so long as you leave it at a fair price.
---
well good news, you dont need ammo for ~~a while~~ ever
---
Dude what does boosh mean?
---
its a module for command destroyers that jumps itself and anything in range 100km away
---
I thought of this as well.
---
Test/goons/panfam were able to make a gentlemen's agreement and share the profits from the Perimeter tradeports. They could just as easily declare the drone lands a type of wildlife preserve.
---
That's a pretty meh spin but whatever floats your boat mate
---
If the drone are 500 km away from their master and if you jam them, they will be free to scoop
---
ITT: The joke going over most people heads
---
Absolutely... what a great way to nurture great new alliances and preserve eve..
---
Even if you believe that CCP's anti-botting and anti-RMT are working on TQ (and, tbh, a trip through null shows that not to be the case), that's only one part of what ruined Serenity.
---
this is just because the "only" viable way to make isk is being in a big null bloc
---
That was to be expected.
---
Have you ever heard of the term "catch and release"?
---
Some one said to use EMC drones to jam them, then grab their drones be they can reconnect.
---
&gt; How anyone still has fun playing this game is beyond me.
---
By quitting null blocs.
---
This is exactly what happened on the Chinese server. 1 or 2 mayor powerblocks holding all sov, no more content only botting and krabbing, goodbye playerbase. 
---
https://i.redd.it/qzv7hkegle431.png So the dropped SkillU sov gets swallowed by either the reds or the blues as I highly doubt that high/lowsec alliances have the resources to take and defend it against a (super)cap and player base like the reds and blues. And then the only small independent sovholder remains is Provi/RC and co. unless red or blue decide it's time to annex that too to complete the circle. 
---
Reason I've unsubbed for a couple months now, told Test I'm going inactive and should just give me the boot, left my super and other caps there because "shrug" What's a couple caps these days worth, right? I'll follow this game every day and I'll resub when it deems to be exiting again. 
---
A couple months ago I had corpies begging me for isk so they could fly a fleet ship and now they are already in (alt) titans. Remember when it was a grind and a true achievement having a titan? I considered it as a endgame. Now that endgame is gone as it is so easy to get isk/ore together for a titan with these 2 powerblocks stuck under a super massive defensive umbrella. People in (mining)caps do not even fear when a couple neuts or reds enter system because wtf would those guys do? You only have to recall your drones and wait till they are gone and if they attack you just poke the capital channel and you get a couple dozen supers to save your hide. 
---
No, the risk got mercilessly butchered by CCP and the reward got pampered with Roquals, skillinjectors and Free SP events. 
---
So I'll happily stay Alpha and use Eve more as a social media to have ingame chats with my former corpies and friends unless change will happen, but I highly doubt that knowing CCP's foolishness.
---
You mean, people are actually defending their miners? I'm literally angry with rage.
---
&gt;Krab in a VNI while watching Star Trek
---
&gt;Get isk
---
&gt;buy hecates to whelp in Provi
---
&gt;Ping goes out for stratop 
---
&gt;ignore it because I’m in Provi 
---
&gt;die and come back home 
---
&gt;another stratop goes out
---
&gt;Join and watch more Star Trek while waiting for the fight 
---
&gt;Goons fight us, we probably lose, go back to step 1 and repeat until I find something more fun to roam with than Hecates
---
Well now you know, and you're all stocked up!
---
Probably NC. clicking on the blue stuff again
---
I’m not nearly the inbred mangina spread that you seem to think dude.  Maybe if you cleared the back alley blowjob cum spatter off your cokebottle glasses you’d realize that.
---
No I'm pretty much spot on.
---
You considered NC and PL unstoppable, nobody in either of those alliances did.
---
You consider it some kind of slight when a numerically superior force beats you
---
You know, its you.  Doom might have his problems, but it looks like your set is rooted in some serious self hate.
---
That’s literally what I wrote there tard face
---
feels like weve come full circle 4.0
---
&gt; I’m not nearly the inbred mangina spread that you seem to think dude.
---
aren't you though?
---
I use pyfa still. The version you have may be out of date, because eve moved from api to the esi system of character checks. Try to re download and reinstall pyfa.
---
You ask best way to kill them and don't know what booshing is??
---
Check the Triglav Defense channel in-game, they have some fits in thier motd.
---
Ever been to Provi or Geminate?
---
Thanks, That is a great idea. I had a look at some of Bjorn's recordings on Twitch and looks a lot of fun and certainly does not run away from the fight leaving fleet members to die.
---
Worst. Game. Ever.
---
If you don't have a super fleet how do you prevent your neighbours with a super fleet destroying the structures you put down to build supers?
---
The only way is by renting, joining the established groups or bluing the fuck out of everyone anywhere near to you.
---
It's always sad to see alliances go.Fly safe guys o7
---
Look in delve for the elite pvp
---
hihi falcon, hope you feel better soon
---
A nyx will do
---
That's why I fly laser boats. I don't need mountains of ammo, just a handful of crystals. T1 crystals will last forever, Faction ammo is supposed to last for about 5k shots, and T2 is supposed to last for about 1k shots.
---
dxtory is the program i use for exactly this. google it.
---
I'm not surprised as all that free sov lies on their border.
---
Just sell it?
---
nice alternative timeline you created
---
Impressive. Nearly everyone I know has hit b instead of v at some point.
---
Thats not enough yo buy plex
---
Wow so many "you"s in that post
---
"You" can't get over that your golden helicopter-dicking days are over, old man
---
Happy Father’s Day!
---
I can’t wait till my little person is old enough to fly, and I can use them as bait.
---
I'm on v2.9.4 is that current?
---
I've imported my character through pyfa and when I load it up with the Wreathe i have in game the data is different in Pyfa than in game.
---
I probably just don't know how to use it anymore :/
---
Thanks for letting me know Pyfa is thew right choice. I may need to just tweak it a bit and see what I'm doing wrong. Where on the Pyfa screen once you create a fit does it show what skills you need to use it efficiently?
---
1 = vsync
---
2 = half vsync
---
3 = third vsync
---
4 = quarter vsync.
---
I use them and get 120 at 1, 60 at 2, 40 at 3, and 30 at 4.
---
you know at the time you could also just buy toons with is essentially the same thing as using a bunch of injectors
---
Phoenix on a proteus. The rorq could put out some mediums and shrekt me easy
---
my humor is 5d chess
---
thats awsome!!! Teach them young lol
---
See you around.
---
The UALX-3 keepstar died while anchoring. There was only 1 fight over it, otherwise it would have been defended on the armor timer and wouldn’t have died
---
No clue honestly. Pulled that moment out of ass for the meme vote.
---
Nope, but its pretty decent for a character just over 5mil sp I think, and took about one week to collect (about 20 salvaged sites per day). 
---
I could plex for next month if I did the same routine this week.
---
You’re acting like SkillU wasn’t using that space for renting to botters the whole time
---
Not shocking, but I do like to think that CCP were pretty sure it was the original account holder asking for it to be removed. In order for a hacker to do this the hacker would probably have had to control my e-mail account (also has it's own 2FA etc. etc.)
---
Eventually you have to draw a line somewhere on the scale from secure---inconvenient and decide that's where you're at with your security. CCP actually seem to have it about right for users willing to do their own share of the work.
---
Heh, get doomsdayed, pod gets overkilled and you lose all sp since last podding / backup
---
I remember the question I wanted to ask.  Is there a big corporation declare war on another corp in high sec?  Pirate?  Test Alliance Please Ignore?  Am I missing something?    I noticed a lot of PVP in Jita and Dodixie.  I noticed that CONCORD and navy police don't usually attack the suicide gankers in Jita and Dodixie.  Just wondering.  I'd stay and watch the fight but I'm afraid someone will shoot my frigate.  lol  Someone shot an Ibis yesterday.  The gate guns didn't shoot the attacker.  I just didn't expect people to shoot frigates in high sec.  Even CODE. ignores my frigate.
---
I mean, there is more fighting in Jita and Doxdixie than usual.  Or are the trade hubs usually this chaotic during school break?  Is it a bank holiday in Europe?
---
The same yet not the same. Pretty sure you know them but choose to ignore for some reason.
---
Goddamn, where do you salvage?
---
Don't use this. Use promo code E3.
---
Typically the salmon don't grow to be the biggest fish in the pond and eat the fisherman though.
---
I'm sure losing all your space is much more fun :)
---
well you're not going to run out soon...
---
Never had a problem with this and  bought characters myself but the characters on there took time to skill and the pool of available characters was not infinite.
---
You have hyperspatial rigs now though (and lowslot hyper mods, but they are kinda expensive). E.g. my oracle with single rig warps faster than HAC (3.38 vs 3.3). Fast-response leshak warps faster than HAC (3.48 vs 3.3). I don't think warp speed alone is of any problem. I quite like them.
---
Brisc Rubin, that was the best. 
---
And who is  Commander A9 ??
---
I mean, it is.
---
I tried market games.
---
I'd rather work overtime and buy plex with my debit card.
---
It's less effort and the work I do contributes to society.
---
I did this in WH space, peeled off from one of the large (for w-space) groups to make another. It's been great. Sure, you lose a lot more when you cant just ping harder and get double the number of people as your opponents, but at least more PvP is happening.
---
Can I interest you in the Wormhole life?
---
But you ROAM. You have to LOOK for fights. Ew.
---
As someone who began during the 2016 alpha clone release and has now been burnt out in eve I'll throw in my feelings on the state of the game. 
---
At first I was very starry eyed at the immense and intricate ways you can play the game. All those trailers that boasted about all of the various and many engaging things you can do in eve drew me in and I wanted to know more about everything. However as a year went past I found out that all of the "amazing" things they advertised were boring as all hell, are very niche in terms of gameplay or just didn't work. 
---
Mining, PI, market stuff, PVE all of that is mind numbing and terribly boring because it's literally left click, right click and done. There's nothing engaging about any of that and people who may think that any of that is fun simply haven't been exposed to pvp. The bounty system, bounty hunter crap and all the junk that I thought was interesting had no bearing at all and literally does nothing for anyone besides getting an isk tick when you kill them. 
---
The PVP is also bland and boring. You get into fleet fly around for a half hour and hope someone wants to fight. 9 times out of 10 we are either dog pile on some poor pilot by themselves or we get absolutely destroyed by people who think dropping supers and caps is fun and engaging. That 1 out of 10 we may run into another roaming fleet or someone contacts us and tells us to wait while they try and form something (sometimes they bring an even fight sometimes they can't form and of course sometimes they over form and blue ball everyone involved.)
---
I get it, there's no such thing as an even fight but at the very least bring ships that can match the ships we're flying. It's always frustrating to see our shit fit kitchen sink go against t3c and hacs than another t1 cruiser gang or even t1 bc fleet. How can it be fun for anyone when the fight is over in a matter of seconds when one side steamrolls the other? Maybe for those who care about internet points but for someone who just wants to play the fucking game not so much.
---
Add to the fact that there is no way of making reliable isk besides being in one empire or another in sov null and you basically have people flocking to those areas and staying in those areas for the rest of their lives. No one cares about low sec or high sec or wh space anymore. Why be in those areas when you can have the protection of huge fleets by your side and have the resources to grind isk until your eyes bleed or you start questioning your life choices? 
---
People say. "Make your own content." Well guess what in order for there to be content you need other people to interact with you.
---
oof
---
This. I've been having a lot of fun in FW flying small frigs/cruisers. It's good fun.
---
&gt;How anyone still has fun playing this game is beyond me.
---
Wormholes.
---
Good to see someone having fun!
---
EVE TRANQUILITY going with warp speed toward SERENITY status
---
... you do know this is Eve right?
---
I'm moving to minecraft :)
---
Nope.
---
This is actually pretty shit.
---
Some of this is due to multiple things other as well, which are somewhat outside of CCP's control in the sandbox. 
---
EVE's golden age (2011-2013) had the most diverse group of organizations. You had small little groups dotting the landscape all over NPC null, lowsec, and highsec. 
---
While N+1 has really been the main culprit of these groups merging into larger groups, there has been zero effort to make tooling for aspiring corporations  to a: recruit and b: communicate . You have chat channels, and that's pretty much it. Discord has now made the communication side better in recent years, but the damage was already done. Recruiting ingame is still absolute cancer, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. 
---
Next is risk of large groups taking on so many new players. During EVE'S "golden age", it was actually pretty hard to get into a sov null group. A LOT of this is due to auth systems and the ability to vet, in minutes, a character with little to no effort. I'm not saying tooling is bad, it's just that the API and now ESI has given a lot of information to these massive groups with the ability to make custom tooling for their HR people. This is actually one of the coolest things about eve, but unfortunately it is one of the reasons due to scaling that many of the small groups have died out. 
---
I've actually sent my concerns to CCP in the past on this stuff, and you know what the response was? 
---
"Its human nature to group together over time."
---
To me, it seems as if they believe too much in the sandbox aspect sometimes. There still needs to be boundaries, especially balance wise, or else TQ will just turn into the Chinese server, where it's absolutely stagnant, where wars are absolutely meaningless. There is even an arguement that, that has already happened on TQ, given the unlimited funds that major nullsec powers have. 
---
There is definitely a lot of fixing that needs to be done if eve is to continue into the next decade,  we will see if CCP has the balls to make the changes needed to keep stagnation away. Otherwise we will just see those major nullsec powers just merge into eachother over time because, why wouldnt they? It's literally in their best longterm benefit to do so. 
---
Heh, this ended up being far longer than I thought it would be.
---
No on is saying its not "ok", but you're going to get stomped by the existing entities near where ever you go.
---
are u on drugs?
---
It will be interesting to see if a number of smallish alliances take some sov before a large power-block comes in and turns it all back into renter space.
---
preach
---
Beat up on them until they run away?
---
That's how pretty much every game in existence works as far as I'm aware though.
---
Are you not?
---
Id like to eventually rat in a dread in a C5 and make billions per hour, but im afraid im still faaaar from getting into capitals.
---
Yah im back on a osrs kick so im still enjoying it
---
Not sure about you, but if I have no enemy, I'd probably get bored and stop playing the game altogether.
---
A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're taking about real money.
---
Idk what sites you are going to 😂
---
Doom is a mentally ill retard. Please refrain from bullying him or Mossad will arrest you for a hate crime
---
you know that killing off your content is a quick way to get bored?
---
They kind of do,you've just bought *a lot*
---
Bloc warfare is still very fun and rewarding, but only if both sides are in a position to fight.
---
The FRT vs TEST war down south has been a ton of fun so far. Prolly cant say the same for the northern war :D
---
A Hecate has enough dps to pretty easily kill rorqual drones and dodge such responses.
---
The cache of ships that I still have in UHKL disagrees.
---
Only need 6 nemesis with scorch bombs.
---
I haven't heard the Super-invasive EULA bit. Care to share? 
---
(Also BL3 launches in April2020.)
---
Now you're making me question my decision to spend an hour looking for a deal that earned me 1 million more than the other deal.
---
ahahaha fucking yikes
---
Asians are already here though. Idk if many more will come.
---
Oh really a lot of this was just straight up salvaging wrecks? Then again, I don't hang around carriers (like, ever) so I don't see thousands of wrecks lying around to pick up. Explains the T1:T2 salvage ratio.
---
Speaking of explorer hunting though, how many Herons died on the way? (Either your own explo ships, or other explorers whose cargo you 'liberated'?)
---
Back to Second Life...
---
Don't know. Probably he had reasons to do so. Maybe life. I know that a few months ago when I looked for his channel it was gone. Now he is back. But while he was still on youtube he did not post for like 1 year at least. Also I think that at the time he lost interest in eve.
---
Well there's C3 gila/rattle, C5 rattle before doing C6/C5 dread
---
You can never actually KILL players. Like we KILLED Band of Brothers, Smash, Rise, many many others, god I've forgotten 3/4 of them. The ashes tend to coalesce into something else.
---
Good riddance to bad rubbish
---
prolly yes cuz i keep playing this shit game
---
As if that shit hasnt been happenong for ages
---
Me needs!
---
No idea I tend to not get fights in low all that often personally, or well fights that are worth taking. 
---
like the day's where downtime between fights in LS was like 2/5 minutes seem gone.
---
Big Thank you dude! You are doing this for all of us players and getting nothing for it.
---
 Also your comment: "NC. and PL sucking each other off, like they are known to do! " 
---
is part of the AT legends now, the best piece of content right there.
---
Not interested in inprinting d-scan neuroticism into my brain because CCP cant come up with something more elegant and less backwards than having to spam a radar button every few seconds
---
your more than welcome to waste all of your time every day manually policing the players of rental regions.
---
it's not like ccp is going to take any actual action against them in a reasonable amount of time anyways.
---
So we are in the same place but I love it and you hate it. You need a new dealer, son.
---
The game needs a serious engine update, it's had a good life.
---
I've been playing this game on and off for several years but never really got anywhere. Mostly due to time constraints with my personal/work life and my crappy computer(s). Now that the game is f2p I'm thinking about trying to give it a shot casually in solo pvp/exploration.
---
Can anyone tell me what the current meta might be for solo frigate/destroyer pvp? I think I have all frigate skills and most small weapon skills maxed out. Any other advice for a casual mostly solo player is very much welcome. If I really start getting back into the game I'll probably join a bigger/more social group.
---
Thanks!
---
You can solo drop on small gang and have a lot of fun.
---
Maybe try not being a nullblob F1 monkey if you aren't enjoying it there.
---
Eve is a bad experience because nullblobs make it so, certainly for everyone else, and apparently for some of their members too. So try something more interesting.
---
&gt;and you do need mountains of it
---
At only 1 gun per ship, a single 500 shot magazine lasts for... half an hour of continuous fire? I wouldn't exactly call that needing mountains of ammo. (If anything it feels like that 500 round magazine baits you into thinking you'll need a lot more ammo than you do.) Does cost a pretty penny when you do need to stock up though, probably a good thing there isn't Triglavian Navy ammo
---
So what you need now is to discover the hidden art of attaching multiple focal crystals to each laser at the same time for even more damage ^(ccpls)
---
I upgraded to a noctis a couple days ago, but I was using a salvage algos before that.
---
And yep, I use an astero to explore around and catch some unaware explorers with quick refits.
---
Also, there's always  a fair bit of pvp going on in my area, and I keep a magnate handy to salvage after any skirmish :P
---
Considering that it could be spread across multiple screens, it pretty much has to do this. 
---
Interesting I've been downvoted.
---
I play EVE since 2012 but you hit the bail on the head
---
Eh, that's not a ridiculous number you bought - T2 ammo does age and break, and if you're PVPing you'll lose it with ships. Just think of it as being well stocked.
---
For heavens sake , how do you expect people to read such a long rant ? I read two pages of it (on my iPhone screen size) and then saw how much is left and just said fuck it. Not to mention that you see posts like this literally every week if not more often.
---
Out of curiosity, why the neuts on the Dams? They're a no cap usage weapon, did they have active hardners?
---
Could u do this with any ship? Is there any combat involved?
---
The original post was to grab 15-20 dudes and move to near provi/lowsec, you're missing the point
---
You don't seem to have learned anything since your last hilarious Nyx loss. I look forward to the next one.
---
You can do it in a catalyst or if you want to maximize gains, a noctis. Join horde and follow around someone in a carrier. I know I always leave my salvage. Lots of others do too
---
Good post. I take issue with people blaming players for their behaviour. What it has merit can be debated. The thing is, people do what people do. If we want to see real change in how the game is played CCP will need to implement rigorous changes across the board.
---
the original post was 10 corps of 15-20 dudes moving near provi or low sec, from already established null corps.
---
that's a small alliance, being told to "be the change they want to see". that's a lot different to 20 guys that gate camp the low sec side of a high/low connecting gate with cruisers.

Ratting is fighting npcs yea but doesnt take much effort especially if yer using a drone setup. You should probably be using a higher up ship though. If you want to earn cash in simmilar ways by selling this stuff, exploration is a great way to do it with a basic heron frigate and can earn you many millions very fast.
---
Try cruors, scale ok with bling and people really underestimate them
---
&gt;Ultimately, I believe our difference in opinion is you blame players for choosing to play the game in a boring optimal way. Whereas I blame CCP for designing the game in such a way that the optimal way to play is boring.
---
I blame both
---
It’s okay. Does your tengu pilot want to buy his modules back?
---
This is null sec or what
---
This would be better in nullsec yes, possible in highsec with lower rewards of course
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Given the issues with falloff, and with the T2's greatly reduced tracking, you really can't expect to get away with a single load of a single flavor of ammo. 3x T1s, 2x T2s, you're gonna need at least 1k-1.5k of ammo on hand. Compared to carrying ~20 crystals if you want to be liberal about it.
---
why? as someone who is part of a small then ls group and went thru this twice it just makes no sense to even bother. 
---
- Entosis is not fun, i hope you have endless alts to afk on beacons
---
- you're moving a gazillion jumps from any decent market(which, shocker, is actually important if you actually do pvp outside of big fleets)
---
- you ain't gonna make a lot of money off of it unless you go full krab mode(and *certainly* won't make more than you would just running an alt in a nullbloc with zero standards), nor will you be able to defend it in the slightest if you don't because of fucking adms.
---
- you being able to use that area(and hold it honestly) is based on the nearby blocs not caring if you're there, and also based on you're neighbors or invaders not calling his nullbloc skirmish fc friend to bring 100 guys to help cause lmao. And no batphoning there is not a valid strategy cause at that point you might as well join said batphone for your existence is based upon them.
---
And there's more, those are just the ones o got off the top of my head. It would be fine if some of these were true to some extent, there's always tradeoffs, but when all of them are and the upsides are nowhere to be seen it's hard to justify it.
---
Itv becomesv secondv naturev beforev toov longv
---
Yet you're the one who still acts like 'omg we need protektion'
---
My point is, even if Frat takes over and rents it all out to bots, it won't really change how the region operates. Its too isolated for smaller alliances to move in and take over, so it'll stay rental space for the forseeable future
---
Dronelands data sites are pretty nice.
---
If you declare war on another corporation, you can shoot each other legally in highsec without CONCORD intervention or losing security status. PIRAT is an old 'wardec corp', meaning their primary activity is declaring war on everything that breathes and shooting them if they make the mistake of coming to Jita. TEST is a huge nullsec alliance which in a sense, owns Perimeter - they own all the big structures such as the Keepstar, Tataras, Sotiyo and a ton of smaller ones, and they charge people tax for using the market/industrial facilities in that system.
---
I'm not sure if they're currently shooting at each other, but that's a breakdown of how you can legally shoot people in HS as well as why you would do so. Your frigate is safe and sound unless your corporation has an active war going on (you can check in the corp/alliance show info window, under the 'Wars' tab).
---
Kill the ship.
---
:))
---
I was using an algos with salvagers and salvage drones, then a couple days ago upgraded straight into a noctis with t2 salvage rigs (worth it if you salvage as much as I do).
---
Oh I get quite a few magnates and cheetas roaming around, that I sometimes gank by refitting my exploration ship. Unfortunately I havent caught many, maybe 3 o 4 in the past month. My success rate is higher when I prescan a  bunch of data/relic sites then wait for explorers to pop on the intel channel and hopefully find them on those sites, when they are unalerted because i dont have to reveal my probes.
---
And the pvp that goes on helped understand the cat and mouse games between explorers/hunters, so I dont really lose exploration ships anymore. Its nearly impossible for someone to catch you if you follow some rules. Unless you jump into a gatecamp with skilled decloakers, then you might be screwed.
---
Legacy will blue em if not already
---
You see what 2-3 supers thrown in HS does as an image?
---
Who did they forget to pay?
---
Yeah, I need to train t2 small beams and amarr frigs V, I'll probably get that after I get a better isk source, I'm currently thinking of getting a prospect for ninja gas huffing in c5/c6 holes, but I'm not sure if that would be better than just getting a covetor for moon mining. Downside to the covetor is it probably will die a lot, and you can't do it whenever you want, even if it is a bit more isk
---
Limit the number of blues an alliance can have. As of number of pilots.
---
While in 2013 the alts / player ratio was 1.3 now its close to 3. Take in consideration Alpha clones as well and Bots and you get how may are still playing ?
---
&gt;  Also, rolling hole already implies you're blobbing.
---
????? alts ??????
---
it takes not much longer than most types of pvp, hell if you do it from a null static is probably the quickest *by far* for hunting shit(either to provoke or to just kill). Its not that taking too much time to find anything is a problem in whs(they make it way faster), it's a problem in the state of the game itself.
---

Hahaha, thank you. The banter era of commentary in EVE_NT was the best. I was really sad not to be able to partake in it this year. Commentating the Invasion tournament just isn't as fun :/
---
They were fit with burst jammers, a good tactic against Leshaks because of the spool up mechanic, so we neuted them out to stop them firing them and breaking lock.
---
You were by yourself (or nearly so). There was no real fights that happened.
---
If you completely defeat the enemy, you need a new game...oh I see why skillU are quitting
---
waow.
---
Ejected from a ship? Like, for what purpose? This ship will still be on your KB. You want respect, fight and die like a man. And you should be in Tribute fighting now, not in Provi.
---
Were you even around in WWB?
---
Haha yeah the same happened to me the first time ^^ as many people said, you wont need to buy anymore amo before a loooong time ! 
---
Fly safe laser-boat buddy
---
That proves my point
---
A bit goes to the smaller alliances that already live there a bunch goes to BOT, a bunch goes to Winter.
---
127 what??
---
Please tell
---
It sends a notice documenting each individual corporation at war with the one that left, because it creates that many more new wars.  This is the method of preventing corps from avoiding wars by leaving the alliance when wardecked.
---
But the notification summary is not helpful, you have the read the details of the eve mails it sends you.
---
And if it's for PvE it'll last a year if that is your PvE ship of choice. But yeah, you could always seed some in markets around PvP areas where somebody will stop by for emergency ammo.
---
Yeah i wonder how many goons will burn out this time.
---
Indeed but your next enemy might have more moral fibre in their leadership.
---
The fits in there are meant for use in fleets and are highly unoptimized, do not use them for solo/small group. In my experience in small groups armor tank is best to allow for webs and application mods. Logi can be provided by 1 nestor that is local tanked, or if you use 3-4 drekavacs they can tinker tank. If you have 2 t2 logi you can take on all of the sites and content currently available,  provided you have at least decent resists.
---
*tend*
---
I spend most of my time afk mining now, when I bother to even log in.  
---
Just slowly making isk and training skills in case the game is ever actually fun again.
---
Provi is rather recognised as the retirement home. You can play some good chest with them but if you go in there and burn down the retirement home, people tend to hate you and stop joining your side.
---
Thank you for your contribution to the discussion.
---
too real it hurts

I'm legitimately convinced selling meme disco interdictor bubbles would make CCP more money than any amount of p2w gold ammo ever would.

---
If you are the one and the same I remember watching your videos years ago. House of Syn really encouraged me to get back into solo and small gang. Eve is worse off for having lost a player such as yourself.
---
Unfortunately while the CSM exists and spodheads shout the loudest on social media, smallgang and solo play will be a thing of the past.
---
too soon
---
If enough people do it they'd be able to realistically contest those entities. Not with super fleets and keepstars, but attrition favors the committed and the smaller groups can have that advantage.
---
If the doll was Nullsec Dotlan, the ENTIRE right hand side of the map.
---
Yes, but chasing a enemy to the very end is a very Eve thing to do.
---
What would you do in Mitten's place now?

* Complete the blue doughnut and show CCP how broken the game is, maybe seeing masses of players leave?
---
* Start pulling punches and letting your enemies grow again?

I’ll upvote that, too.

The limitation has only succeeded in making bigger blue lists more appealing imho (as borne out by the fact that the dwindling playerbase has condensed into fewer and fewer groups)

Can someone tell me what C5 means?

Not really, when the OP says "ship" literally any gun *could* be a correct answer. It's almost like different engagements require different weapons/tactics. What a surprise.

While CCP has some (a lot) of fault, have you thought about that there's a general trend away from MMORPGs in general?

I think it is a bug.  I am getting the same msg when I try to invite my own char on another account to a fleet.
---
Everybody I have talked to also gets this msg when they try to invite that char.  I do not think they all marked me as blocked.  And I KNOW I don't have this one char on one of my accounts blocked by all the other chars on all my other accounts ...
---
Also, this char can put msgs in any of the chats he is in but on some of them, he never sees anybody else's msg.  On my other chars on other accounts and even on other chars on this account it works fine.  So it is not installation or account specific but toon specific.  Driving me crazy.  and after playing EVE for 10+ years, that's a short drive :-)
---
Personal reasons for quitting:
---
 - **Multiple accounts**: There are people with over 10 accounts running, and most people have at least 2 accounts. This shouldn't be normal at all. You should be able to play the game with your one account and work with others to get things done like cyno's, hauling, or scouting. Unfortunately with a mix of distrust, boring af tasks, and grinding to make ISK, this is not the case.
---
 - **Grind is real**: This is actually a prime reason people have multiple accounts. You have chars mining/missioning while your *actual* char is having fun. This shouldn't be normal and accepted. If the game grind is so mundane that you do it on the side while you have fun on another account, something is terribly wrong.
---
 - **No one likes the 'seen it all'**: Many times as a newby I was super excited when something happened and I get to experience it only for older players to shoot that excitement down in an instant because apparently it happens all the time and it's boring and not a big deal. Big fight? *"Ah yeah TiDi simulator we're gonna skip it."* Want to go fight your enemies? *"Whatever, they'll just take it back a week later it doesn't mean anything."* There's no excitement. At all. Nothing new to experience.
---
 - **Camping**: Again, this is a multiple account issue, as people have their Nth account(s) sitting on a gate all the time other than downtime and you have no choice but to live with it, meaning some gates are permanently out of bounds in anything bigger than a cruiser if you are alone.
---
 - **Botting**: CCP's enforcement is so terrible when it comes to this that the people botting can laugh at me as they continue to strip entire systems in a matter of a few hours. Every day. Every week. Every month. Every year. Did I mention Multiple accounts being an issue?
---
 - **Skill Injectors**: Play the game for 5-10 years and have some random newby catch up within 3 days. Might as well add a fifth faction to choose from: Gallente, Amarr, Minmatar, Caldari, MasterCard
---
 - **Gross imbalance of power, wealth, and a shameless showcase of favoritism**: Nullsec. Just go there. I have no doubt that CCP will continue to tend to the needs of Nullsec going forward as they have always done in the past. If you want to play the game *your way* like their advertisements shove down your throat and choose HiSec or LowSec, then tough, you will forever be known as a bottom feeder unless you go through the mind-numbing task of fighting against market bots. Wormholes are there, but the only reason they're profitable is because CCP is too lazy to cull them.
---
 - **CCP is loving the microtransaction scene**: You think you'll be able to design your own ship skins one day? You think those little purchases will always just be cosmetic? :)
---
 - **The journey**: I, like many others here, I struggled my ass off. We went mining in our little Navitas, then Catalysts, and then we *scraped* enough together to beg for a discount on a cruiser made by that one friend that doesn't understand that what he mines isn't free, etc. I have lost **everything** numerous times. At one point I was so broke that I couldn't pay the repair bill for my half-destroyed ship because Sansha happened to have an Incursion. I spent my days at work reading up on how some mechanics work, and creating spreadsheets for PI and Industry. I went from mining my own resources to buying those resources directly from others as my industry chain grew. I helped plan a defense against our POS even though we weren't PvP players. I delved into exploration, piracy, LowSec, NullSec, WH-space. I joined massive fights where TiDi made 5 minutes feel like 5 hours and there were cynos to shuffle players in and out of the fray as the fight went on through different timezones. I grew from the newby that jetcanned ore while mining in his Navitas to an older player that owns a 'garage' filled with rare collectable ships and can comfortably own whatever I want. And even at this point, I can look forward to other events, like fucking with the market because I can, claiming territory, starting a rebel group, teaching a newby, or you know what? Just cruising out there with a Mining Barge and listening to some music... You know what the present-day newby goes through? 3rd day in and that guy sits in an Orca like it's no big deal. In about a month he'll be flying Capital ships if he wen't easy on the skill injectors. Such a journey for him to experience! He really had a fun time, didn't he?
---
Eve is a great game. I will always remember my time in the game, and there really is no other like it (yet, but hopefully that changes in the future). It's unfortunate that it is plagued with as many issues as it is and it makes the game, in general, a tedious and unfair chore rather than a great experience.
---
u/prodnovick Guarantees it!
---
And for me at least, that is not checked.
---
&gt; Instead of slowly burning out they dropped all sov and ~~went out in a blaze~~ quit. o7
---
FTFY. That's not going out in a blaze of glory. They didn't throw everything they had in some final battle, or last ditched attempt, which is specifically what a blaze of glory is.
---
Wow, the goon circle jerk has already begun, did mittani send out a ping?

&gt; Complete the blue doughnut and show CCP how broken the game is,
---
I mean, the most broken part of the game is the mentality and behaviour of the players forming the blue doughnut. CCP can't exact change human psychology. Completing the blue doughnut to show ccp how their game is broken, is the same as you and your checkers  opponent both agreeing not to capture each others pieces, to show Milton Bradley how broken checkers is. The game isn't the primary problem, people banding into giant coalitions is.
---
One of the many reasons why this game sucks right now: there hasn't been a single timer to fight over in my tz since the frat/TEST war started back up. Same war, 100% different experience.
---
Just dual box leshaks with a dread buddy and make close to a mil an hour
---
why are bots so hard for ccp to detect. Pretty sure they follow really fixed patterns, can't ccp just go off that.
---
This is a good pasta
---
eh, the time of eve where that was doable is over
---
This. Literally the whole point of being in lowsec is to avoid the unfun grindy blue donuts cluster fuck that is so null.
---
&gt;but also not testing thoroughly on sisi before hand.
---
Because CCP always fixes bugs reported on sisi and doesn't let them to get TQ. /s
---
What kind of monitors are you running?
---
Because CCP wants to keep moderate amount of botting to keep the inflation going
---
And besides, banning mass toss-away vni alts is not a easy task

Got to make sub numbers look good.

Huh, the botter forgot to set auto-dock on

"who do I put my krab alt in for spy purposes"

Now I know what my noob ass should go and do.

Ten years ago, Band of Brothers were the one with the half-ton bucket.
---
So you're saying if you had won the battle, you would have been able to contest the objective. But because you didn't….
---
There is only one sentence; *"they'd get farmed to fuck by the existing entities."*
---
I think that he's correct. An alliance of 100-150 people would be slightly too large to ignore, and would almost certainly be forced to pick a side or get scrubbed out of sov null.
---
what time zone do you play in?
---
There has been content in US,  EU, an AU/China timezone. Idk what planet you live on where you cant make ONE of those timezones work.
---
See... some might say the problem isn't bots becoming more human-like, but humans becoming more bot-like.
---
And the other side decided that the war was no fun T\_T and fucked off. The south won that fight hands down, and won the war because of that fight.
---
There comes a time in the game when that isk you're OT is buying is insignificant. Mid level marketers are moving tens or hundreds of billions for billions in profits. Unless you're willing to spend hundreds or thousands of USD on plex your OT isn't a drop in the bucket compared.
---
While there are expensive gases in c5/c6 you can really only fill up maybe half your hold before the rats show up. To fill your tank you will usually need to scan down and find three gas sites that haven't already been visited just to get one tank of gas.
---
So when you factor scanning time for three gas sites, mining up to 3 gas sites, avoiding being killed by another player or the rats, and then getting it to market you will find you aren't making many ISK at all.
---
I've promised to quit the game if I ever get to that point. I'm here to have fun, not to stare at buy/sell orders all day, refreshing every five minutes so that I can watch numbers tick upwards. It's hard enough to find pvp content outside of wormhole space.
---
I wish I was good enough to have a krab alt lol

It's really only a problem when you find that everything you ever write  has the letter d every 6 characters.

What most legacy people will remember from the camp is whoring on the hundreds of dreads who logged in to get their pilots back.

---
That's one way to look at it. It's wrong, of course, but don't let that stop you.
---
What you're saying is that most legacy people will remember their individual killboards being green, not the glaring mistakes of the people camping. Ok, sure. But the supers got out safely almost to a man. So you remember what you want but a hellcamp that was not.
---
Getting scrubbed out of null is different from being farmed to fuck though. Additionally, you have groups that have successfully taken space next to giant empires and managed to live there for a while:
---
- Unspoken Alliance in Etherium Reach (They are vacating now that Nancy came down, but still continue fighting when they can)
---
- French Connection in Pure Blind 
---
- No Vacancies' meme sov (&amp; structures) in Fade that still hasn't been retaken by Ranger Regiment or any other GOTG group
---
- The hodgepodge of alliances living in Scalding Pass that are not friendly to Fraternity
---
So the goal of that entire battle was to kill the UALX keepstar and then give withdrawn from the war? Y'all are such sore losers lmao.
---
Yep, just put up a sell order and it will sell eventually.
---
Even "Collectors" aren't stupid enough to waste so much money on this kind of item.
---
150 B is the price of a T2 ship BPOs. At this very moment, there are an Anathema and an Astarte BPO for respectively 125 B and 200 B, who will take less time to ROI compared to your module one.
---
According to contracts, modules are more like 20-30 B.

lowsec fw has this rock-paper-scissors dynamic between t1/navy dessies and frigs. control is mostly in, shield tanks and warp scramblers are mostly out. if it has three mid slots, assume dual webs and prop mod. ships like atron and breacher have one dominant fit (null scram kiter-dual rep breacher), tristans remain some kind of dice roll, with a bit of experience you'll know what to expect when you see it on d-scan. afterburner is the official lowsec prop mod. make sure to check for tackle tooltip in a fight. almost forgot about [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view)
---
in nullsec you want ships that can handle the 1vblob, navy frigates up to t3ds are all on the table. t1 frigates can also be made to work but more muscle is good to have in null, also you don't lose ships at the same rate you do in low. check out suitonia and tomalak for examples of good piloting of various ships. make sure to have an mwd, dual prop is handy.
---
Sure the supers got out. However was there anything Legacy could have realistically done to prevent that? Between DT mechanics and Super mechanics it doesn't seem like a persistent camp is possible. Holding the grid for the first couple of days did net a trillion isk or so of kills however, most of which came in the first hour or two which the SkillU side always tries to ignore because it doesn't fit the meme template.
---
Frat space and the drone lands are soon going to be the only areas not controlled by tapirium, so not sure where you envision they go. Make eve serenity again #MESA

Honestly I don't give a fuck dude. Legacy are the only people running around stroking each other's cocks these days. We get it, you're all very impressive. You did it, hooray. Honestly don't care. I've been playing for 15 years, I've seen a lot of alliances get where legacy is and end up in the dumpster. But the fact that you guys seem to tie so much of your identity into proving the rest of the game wrong is seriously pathetic.

---
Can't you sig tank the rats with the prospect? I'd heard you could do that, so you take the whole site, and also while the rats are present you don't have to worry about being ganked because they'll murder anyone who shows up
---
Its true that frat space has far few bots than Delve. Bo need to rub that in.
---
Maybe then you will have a proper comeback
---
The flag changes colour but no one leaves the region
---
That's almost exactly how I play as well 😀
---
Not that I'm aware of.  I used to set a timer to go off at 16m as I was told they never showed up before then. So anyway, I was orbiting the cloud and the rats showed up at 12m and I took a hit(maybe hits) that took me to around 15% structure and was lucky to escape with my life. I never tried it after that experience.
---
It is more along the lines of a game of checkers, where each piece can only be moved by one player. One side already has a bunch of queened pieces. The other has a few two but because the first side has more, it keeps getting more pieces because who wants to join the losing side?
---
Ultimately, there is a massive pile of risk adverse care-bears in Null, that want to PVE their ISK and ore in perfect safety at the highest gains. Occasionally, they might pop out somewhere and smash someone smaller but they want to know that it is them doing the smashing, them being smashed.
---

It is to late. The only way to make it manageble is to control it as much as possible. Introduce gameplay that is more controlled. But then EVE loses part of its sandbox effect and also i understand the people that invested so much time and effort into titans and supers only to have them limited by gameplay. But that's the issue here.
---
&gt; SkillU didn't create it, they just refined it and blued up any type of threat
---
fc what is xix
---
Oh, I'm sure that mattered to you guys, but you've moved the goalposts considerably. The original argument was that we lost the UALX fight. What happened after that fight is after that fight. What happened during that fight was that the keepstar died and we managed to lose less than you. You're mixing your points. You clearly won that war and no one is arguing against that - so what's your point? By your logic whoever wins a war definitionally won all the battles, because the ultimate outcome was in their favor. That's stupid.

Im rold mouth trumpet cavalry are so good even eehefkee rolled away from them so they dindt have to fight them
---
IMO, one of the quickest band-aids would be to delete Colossal and Enormous mining anomalies. There is practically infinite resources as is. Most of the null population could fit in one or two regions, but there are 40 of them. If goons had to spread their jeans through 3 regions, their umbrella has more area to cover. Same with other alliances. Instead of needing rorquals mining yield, they should have merged the infinite anomalies with 5B isk worth of ore with giant rocks that a rorq can sit on for a couple hours with little player interaction. 
---
Instead we get tons of players in one region owning several buffer regions around them with absolutely no reason to take space, since their are dozens of other regions with infinite resources. This game is super boring right now. I unsubbed 4 of my 7 accounts, basically leaving my PVP focused accounts active.
---
The battle of UALX was the turning point that made all the allies of Fraternity decide they didn't want to be part of the war anymore. It was a complete strategic victory and once you account for post-crash kills, insurance and loot it was a victory in ISK as well. If you want to point towards a defeat, it's easy to point at the failure of Legacy to reinforce the PL staging fortizar during the camp however trying to spin UALX as anything other then a major legacy victory is just nonsense. 
---
If it wasn't a victory, why did all of fraternities allies leave? Why didn't they try push further? Why not go for UALX 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0?

I used to use it when it had its first english localization, as it was thr best recording software by a long shot

how do u know that isnt just good luck?

Dude, the "wide-eyed newbie with innocent question" act works better if you create a new reddit account.

Otherwise we can all just click on your history and spot that you're a goon bait-poster.

"9 years under my belt. Haven't taken a sizeable break yet. Worth it 110%. "
---
Quote by Proxymal, lol
---
Have you considered that at least one of those alliances has no interest in playing goonstyle
---
Legit question. I'm part of the Initiative, not a goon. Quite a different culture here even though we're on the same side. Wouldn't the game be more fun for you guys if you were able to contend with everyone again?
---
Tbh, when I ran lasers I upgraded and swapped so often and used lasers for so little time I didn't even see one break. This is literally the first I'm hearing of it being a thing.
---
We are too elite to merge. The right thing to do would be to widotte into Horde under Gobbins but there is far too much ego in NCPL to ever let that happen. The only other option is to just let us rot and fester as we are. We do not want to adapt.
---
&gt;hates being in a blob
---
&gt;refuses to leave
---
&gt;is a textbook case for being part of the problem
---
There's your TLDR.
---
They just do things differently. But they're a really good Nano piloting group.
---
How else do you make timers?
---
Pure gold. Love it
---
I'm West USTZ as well and I find plenty of stuff to do being an independent entity. If you don't like your blob, leave for somewhere that actually lets you have fun.
---
It was extremely relevant at the time because folks tried to do it many times and things would fall apart without a single entity paying or making then stay blue.
---
Have Goons ever considered splitting into multiple major alliances? I understand they have a strong identity and alot of history. But with wouldn't it make them more competent and elite?
---
As I write this I realize it probably leans towards a stupid question for most. But what would be the downside, if any?
---
Little Red Riding Hole are really good at this game tbh. Having fought them a few times they're one of the few groups in the game that kind of scare me, in a good way, you know?
---
Thinking they’d 1v1 in subcaps is retarded.
---
I really dont care about what other people find fun or no. I have a lot of fun dropping solo big shit on gang, it s only that matters.
---
I'm so glad that NV is still holding that meme sov. I was the one who sniped that system (and left it unclaimed) and have since sniped sov elsewhere. No clue if I'll last here but hey, proof that a temporary thing can turn into something longer term with enough dedication. 
---
Just have to keep trying.
---
Also, mad props to BSOD for holding the line against Frat.
---
I hope not and i think many in the other groups would agree.  I'd rather shoot those guys.

60 FPS. No matter if I switch it to interval 1,2,3 or 4
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I do lots of other stuff. We're talking about the Frat/TEST war. War sucks for anyone not in the right time zones because of how timer mechanics are set up right now.

2.Who says im in a blob?

I've found that sometimes I need to minimize the game for a second to get it to update that.

Hey, not sure if you were aware, but Arctic Reclamation Services and Engineering has left Goonswarm Federation.
---
Do you know what a tldr is?

 I started playing in EVE since 2011 but you hit some nails on the head very well there.

Then fight somewhere else. Timezones have been a thing in all of Eve's history.

Literally 3 years planning to kill a Keepstar.
---
nah, it was brought up on comms so everyone piled in.
---
I am having the same problem, three sights in a row with just the overseer drop.
---
What's the native refresh rate on your display? If it's over 240hz the interval settings won't drop you below 60fps and if your graphics controller is capping you at 60fps you'd be locked at 60fps no matter how you set that.
---
Wow, this sounds like it fucking sucks ass haha. Glad I dont play the game like this.
---
&gt;That illusion was shattered over the next two weeks while your hellcamp was systematically and regularly farmed, while supers and titans escaped essentially unhindered. But you don't remember that part - what you remember is some storybook narrative about how TEST finally grew up.
---
Don't really get it how it was an illusion,It was an existential war for Legacy, losing would mean eviction, they held the field of the most important battle in the south up until that point, they were able to achieve their objective (albeit 24 hours later than they hoped but achieved they did nonetheless). How was that an illusion is lost on me to be quite frank.
---
Its unfortunately that even to this day its impossible for people on both sides to have a more grown up discussion about what happened a year ago.
---
And the funny thing is, we got a more grown up discussion a year ago about what had just happened, Between Grath, PGL and KillahBee during [the talking in stations](https://youtu.be/Q6mEMrbJtVo) episode about the battle.
---
No spin, just people giving honest opinions about what they thought of UALX, and the consequences that were still unfolding because of the battle.
---
Grath and PGL join the discussion later in that recording, definitely recommend either skipping to the point where they join, or watching all of it..
---
To be fair, i think you are right in saying that for the PL+WinterCo+SkillU side, UALX wasn't a defeat, they achieved their objectives.
---
However i think what Killahbee said in that recording to be also pretty accurate, UALX killed any momentum PL+WinterCo+SkillU had up until that point, it not only put a stop to any other plans they had, but it delayed them for at least a week. And as we later find out, this was long enough for the Imperium to put real pressure in the North forcing PL to go back to help the North in their defense, putting a final end to the war in the south.
---
It’s not what i meant. But numbers that are not normalized doesn’t tell the whole story.
---
You used to be able to use a Deep Space Probe and launch it far from you, and it would give a very inaccurate result, which you could warp to, and half the time it would land you further away in the direction you wanted.  So then you drop a new one there, and warp off and warp back.
---
This is how the original deep safes were made to my knowledge pre-2009 (or whenever) probe rework.
---
what movie was this from?
---
Kingsman
---
I guess I interpreted his message differently, I read it as 10 independent corps, and the change just being a healthier ecosystem of small-gang skirmishes, not an alliance taking on blocs.
---
4k 60Hz
---
I dont think any 4k 240 screens exist yet :P
---
But what you said about the graphics controller capping me let me remember that I have Gsync enabled. After I turned that off and restarted the game I was able to reproduce what you wrote about the different interval settings.
---
My bad :)
---
Worth it.
---
facepalm
---
l2azor is that you?
---
and this lady's and gentleman is what eve 2019 looks like
---
Lol no problem, those interval settings work in such an odd way. I had to set mine to interval two to keep capped at 60fps cause 120+ was just generating a ton of heat with no benefit to performance.
---
You say Small Gang pvp is dead?
---
I thought that was all that was left?
---
The only things I see in space are small gangs and blobs.  How is it dead?

Three times in a row in one day, more like 8 if I counted the two days before. The drop rate seems to have plummeted.

I agree other than 4.

4 is a fallacy parroted by people who are bad at understanding the eve economy.  These same types will say 'isk income is too high' and then turn around and ask for passive isk fountains with a straight face.

You can save the location of a probe and warp to that though.

---
Because "out of game" tools were never a thing....
---
You're doing this all wrong.
---
A good bait-post has to have a proper introduction:
---
1. Create a new reddit account with a newbie name - "Captain Starchaser" or some stupid shit like that.
---
2. Start your post with a story: _"Hi guys, I just started Eve three months ago and am loving it! Just bought my first corax!"_
---
3. Throw in some goon propaganda. Any old crap will do: _"I've heard stories about NCPL and how they're the most elite groups in all of Eve. I tried to join once but they just stole my isk and laughed at me! One guy said my killboard wasn't green! Oh well, I will keep trying."
---
4. Now set the scene: _"I love the game, but I'm really concerned that NCPL arent doing well. I think if they don't try harder, they'll die. And that would be bad for Eve. We should all be trying to help NCPL stay alive!"_
---
5. And finally,  start your actual bait post about why NCPL should merge, krab up and become more like goons. Just use the text here that you originally posted.
---
See? Easy. Follow this advice and you'll be smugging and baiting with the best of them!
---
No thanks necessary. Glad to help.

Then stop playing. Simple as that. If you are legitimately having zero fun playing this game, stop playing.

We'd have an out of game tool to circumvent the limit within a few days and be right back to playing like normal.

You use Discord Light Theme so anything you say is automatically invalid.

This would be great, but the reality is most people fall into one or multiple of the following categories:
---
* Risk Averse
---
* Do not have time to find content
---
* Don't know how to find content
---
* Don't know how to be self sufficient
---
* Don't know how to FC
---
* Don't have enough time
---
I did what you are advocating when I left SMASH alliance back in what must have been '07 or '08. I've never looked back. I have run multiple small gang corps since then, with my most recent one starting up just this month. Over this span of time doing the small gang thing has grown harder. I think PvP was at its best during the T1 cruiser buff era +/- 1-2 years or so. 
---
Now everyone in null is either a bot, a blob that calls in supers, or completely empty. You have to work hard and get lucky to get a fight that's even remotely even for both sides. I wish it was as easy as what you said, but we need a hand from CCP to make things healthier in the game before it becomes more viable.
---
Unpopular opinion, but jump fatigue was absolutely good for the health of the game. It allowed small groups to control territory and made cap pilots have to really think about if they wanted to jump or not. Now it doesn't matter, and the sphere of influence is massive. I'm sure  I'll be downvoted into oblivion for saying that though.
---
If we want a healthy game, we need smaller-medium sized groups to own sov and not get whack-a-mole'd the moment they come up. That isn't going to happen with some changes to gameplay that your average SOV nerd is going to detest.
---
Literally 4 years of planning that’s true
---
Fair enough. Do you think it would have zero effect then? Not more people leading or more confusion?
---
Jump fatigue also promoted sitting in your own space and not attacking anything. It made it difficult for null entities to attack each other in force to invade each other's space.
---
I'm not saying that things are perfect now, or that jump fatigue was all bad or all good, but it definitely discouraged invasions.
---
Its not passive to own a moon. You must fight for them and defend. if you look at history of moons the asset loss to attack and defend them unbelievably outweighs the net benefit from resources.
---
Ouch, forgot to drop corp.
---
But do they mean faucets or overall income including trading?
---
If people/groups find it beneficial to be friendly to each other, they will be friendly to each other. Little coloured icons are immaterial to this. 
---
If you want to cap the number of friends you can have (in any practical sense), then you have to design the game so that it becomes *detrimental* to do so. 
---
TLDR: Design the game so it hurts to have blues more than it helps.
---
No affect.
---
The reasons for people blueing remain unchanged.
---
Notice the alliance: Fraternity University. All of the member corps are 100% taxed.
---
Great fun - haven't used that dread in ages- unfortunately I insured it and it wasn't even shot. 
---
Hey ho definately worth it for the Erubi (I assume thats the plural of Erebus) now if they would just undock some more ... need to get value for my insurance payment.
---
its pointless, there are workarounds. And it doesn't really fit what eve is about, and that is being able to do what u want.
---
that said, ccp needs to promote game mechanics which put larger groups at a disadvantage. simple as that tbh.
---
Maded Rift and Redline are taking a pathetic stab at being a big boy bloc FC by using NPSI as their army

INIT obviously
---
It is a headache for diplos, but i don't think the imperium would crumble if they only could blue bastion and TNT for example and had to work with init. and others lile Test on a pure neutral basis.
---
Most of organization and support structure is out of game anyway.
---
When did I ever say that? Not logging back in was the right tactical decision (although it definitely would have been more fun if they had lol). But this pretty common among northerners now a day. 
---
You just twist, contort and outright omit what has been said or done to suit your own anemic narratives because you have no substantial counterarguments left to make. You have ate shit, you are eating shit, will continue to eat shit and probably go extinct. All without realizing that you have and that you could have done something about it. That is truly pathetic.

look around in npc null, best bet that a few might be there.

Thanks for the answer
---
I wonder why these guys needed to go for a stroll this fine Sunday evening on Fathers Day? Maybe there won't be as much traffic, another KS is gonna die soon, or OR maybe it is because a pilot that has a FC ticker left a fleet advert open to all blues including horde, fleet was free move on,  and som1 joined fleet with 1 day old char and invited 2 titans to fleet and warped them off......lmao
---
Who cares. Literally everyone does it.

Not really.

The only thing that changed is the big dick on top is not the big dick anymore, someone else is.

Now little dick is whining is that the game is over.

Didn't want to evac those Titans for the third time this month anyway?

&gt;its pointless, there are workarounds. And it doesn't really fit what eve is about, and that is being able to do what u want.

True... and the workarounds seems to be the common response to this (which I don't use... hence don't know about them). Thanks for the answer.

The Noctis is purpose built for salvage, but any destroyer hull with 8 high slots will work to start. If you follow someone around in null that drops mobile tractor units, you can just fill the highs with Salvage Is and load up with salvage very quickly. If you have to run around a bit to pick up the wrecks, have two or three Tractor Beams fit so you can pull stuff in from elsewhere on grid. 
---
OP made a billion off that trip to Jita, and they are in the worst area for salvage by average price. So imagine what you can make in the *good* areas.
---
Truly amazing that they've stayed docked for so long, trying to deny us content, and then do this, that setup in the move fleet of theirs is just all kinds of retarded.
---
lol 'certain game mechanics'

I am curious if you will list them so I can have a good sunday laugh.

Interesting. How could you do that?

In EVE you have the fun you play for...

Do you feel like Scrams turning off MWD's killed brawling?

As /u/Fuzzmiester said below, If you are running Windowed, or Fullscreen Windowed, your Interval settings might be locked to the slowest monitor.

We don't have our own minecraft server. 3/10 wouldn't join.

I mean all PL move ops are "guaranteed" safe, and that they won't die. Talk about killing your own alliance from the inside.

The new Xbox store is actually pretty decent. Buy it there which has cross-play and you'll be able to bypass the EGS this way on PC.

Fairly sure other corps do just fine with nano too. MCAV just can’t fly anything else.
---
I don't have a good answer for that. 
---
But I think the best starting place to work that out would be to list all the reasons why blue-ing is beneficial.
---
Yea there was, skill points. Once CCP made a way for newer players to bridge that time gap PL couldn’t hide behind that crutch anymore.
---
Can't do much fighting in a lone monitor, he likely had implants he wanted to try and save, it doesn't take rocket appliances to figure it out

Eve Market Data goes back to mid 2009, and is the best historical data outside CCP to my knowledge.  There was a full market dump somewhere of 2004-2009 from CCP, but it is lost to the ages I think.

That's not a crutch. I think if you invested in CCP from day one and had large SP you shouldn't be penalized for it. Now look at Eve. Dying a death due to too much SP in the game . Capital blobs everywhere and giant coalitions. Good luck.

Although I don't prescribe to their playstyle simple farmers do tend to feed from larger groups bpo collections.

---
Yes, there are too many resources per system.
---
I think remove passive income is another part of the escalating issues we're seeing. That issue being that people have to be out in space to collect that money, but people also want to be safe while making that isk. So what do we see? Basically 0.0 has its own concord, i.e. standing capital umbrella fleets that (nearly) instantly respond to attacks on mining vessels. In one sense, yay sandbox. But just because something is player driven doesn't make it a good part of the game. If there was passive income people would be able to roam instead of mining (and defending those mining ships) 23.5/7.
---
Ideally we would return to some form of passive income, hopefully something more like PI (i.e. individual players rather than moon goo (corp level)). But I agree with what you're saying.
---
We already have Thukker ships.
---
Cheetah,Jaguar,Vagabond, Panther and Nomad are all Thukker ships.

It absolutely was a crutch. They leaned on it by having an earlier start date. It was never that they had super elite skillz, they had skill points.
---
They weren’t good, they just had older accounts, and let their nuts hang while seal clubbing to create a false image of leetness.
---
What would their pirate gimmick be?
---
That's what I really want to know first.
---
Who are you?
---
Learn to recruit better. Stop being lazy scrubs. I mean what can I say. You want CCP to give you a crutch because you don't recruit high so players? Well you got it. Now blobs of supercaps are forcing people out of the game. Congrats. Enjoy what's left of Eve
---
Most WH groups are the best at running away. Other than that they are mostly awful. Mostly.
---
So, the people who used to pride themselves on fighting bad people while outnumbered, are now hiding?
---
Or was that only when you could upship with no consequences...
---
Oh noes, guys who enjoyed over a decade of seal clubbing are leaving the game because they can’t do it anymore. Super big loss.

Tbh I did small gang. And tourneys I don't like supers and.blobs.  So once CCP axed that. I left. I'm just saying from the viewpoint of someone who had hundreds of million of so we all didn't get sucked into dropping supers on lesser entities.
---
One problem with this analysis.
---
Correlation of CCP earnings with what is happening with the game might make an interesting comparison, if it were happening in a vacuum.  Which it wasn't.
---
Let's talk about Dust514 (released 2013), Valkyrie (released March 2016, developed since October 2013), Worlds of Darkness (significantly slowed down in October 2011 and officially canceled 2014), Gunjack and Gunjack2 (2016 release), and Project Legion/Project Nova (which has apparently been using at least some resources since 2013)?  I'm thinking nobody outside CCP upper management can tell us how much of our subscription money was thrown away on these projects instead of Making Eve Better. 
---
What seems obvious to me is that CCP spread the income from EVE Online around to other unprofitable projects up until around 2016, when it seems they got a more streamlined and focused on their cash cow.  Those earnings and revenue numbers include a lot of other things going on in the background, not just EVE Online (sadly).
