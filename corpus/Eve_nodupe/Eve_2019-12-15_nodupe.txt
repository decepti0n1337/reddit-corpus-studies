oh no what will i do   
---
&gt; Rightclick name -&gt; Block
---
&gt;Which hey, might be why Uni‚Äôs PvP campuses are becoming ghost towns.
---

---
Interesting use of the present participle. I'm not sure that the present tense is accurate anymore. If the Wormhole Campus has to go on ops with Spoopy in order to get the numbers to do anything (based on some killmails that I've seen recently), things are bad.
---
How's EVE these days? Haven't played since before citadel's. I've wanted to return, but I also want to actually stick around this time.
---
5 years? Try 9...
---
Dude! Why you gotta do me like this, you know I like my popcorn sweet not salty!
---
As if you've forgotten about all those evenings we spent holding hands at the cinema together *angry face*
---
ya... looked promising for a few minutes there.. that happened fast lol, back to the -10 group.. or at least -10 in every enemy FC's eyes.
---
Well maybe if you treated me with more respect I would take your opinions on board and not be disappointed by my life choices...
---
It's quite amazing how much nicer local becomes after about 5 minutes of doing that
---
i have reached a point on my Jita alt that i can have a casual, conversation w/ people in there, the blocklist is very, very long
---
Guy is probably salty because he tried to scam people on hypernet and it backfired and he fucked himself over.

STAIN RUSSIANS STATEMENT
---
We have woken up from our typical Vodka stupor to find ourselves abandoned once more.  We were looking forward to TEST attack on Stain but instead we got this half-assed declaration of intent.
---
Even declarations of war have become shit. 
---
We shall hold TEST to their word and if they refuse to finally deal with Stain menace once and for all, we shall come to Esoteria proper. 
---
To good fights!
---

---
PS Sort Dragon was with us for B-R. He is alright no matter the latest idiocy he conjures.
---
This is gold
---
Is Legacy big enough though to launch that kind of offensive on the other side of the map without burning out?
---
The true secret is goon supers with titans. Move a full filament wirth of supers with 1-2 titans with them. Super packed full of ships and titans have clone vats and bridges. Now you have a 200 man goon subcap fleet within bridging range of you across the universe
---
EARZ!
---
How come you've never drawn me a picture. Just lead me along and then cast me aside aye? *frowny face*
---
oof.
---
You are doing God‚Äôs work!
---
I've been getting that a lot. Lots of "warp vector" when I'm already warping. Rubberbanding hard when landing on grid, D-scan failing about 20% of the time.
---
Man steps out from under umbrella, gets rained on.
---
More at 10.
---
From what I've heard, HSC decided to start putting Crucifiers up on contract recently. So things are improving. It's just that as you, a former director, presumably know, improvements are quite likely to have trouble keeping pace to how they are needed.
---
&gt;you're understanding of our language
---
Irony.
---
He explodeded
---
Rip seddow, I‚Äôll never forget you daddy
---
CVA had a bait carrier out, got a little greedy and died to goonies
---
Exactly what I was thinking. [https://imgur.com/QrbBoSJ](https://imgur.com/QrbBoSJ) (the link shown in the image leads to the text "BOYCOTT JITA LOCAL BECAUSE IT IS FUCKED WITH HYPERNET MESSAGES.")
---
A shame CCP isn't responding adequately to the problem in a timely manner. A fix could be coded in minutes, apparently they don't care much.
---
Thankfully, the community once again tries to solve the in-game mess using "Hypernet spam clearing". Major kudos to the anti-Hypernet activists!
---
You posted the KM, you're supposed to have the AAR
---
This should be fun
---
I can confirm Redline is being asked to leave our corp and NC. Redlines actions are not in line with the core values and beliefs we, Original Sinners, expect our members to adhere to.       
---
We, Original Sinners, are looking into a possible trade deal with an undisclosed Alliance for another FC and content creator. We wish Redline the best of luck in the future but he can honestly go fuck himself
---
4000 lol
---
I was in Agony Unleashed. I miss them, they did more for the game than people admit.
---
&gt;	Nut up or shut up.
---
OK.
---
Wasn't there. Are you gonna make a video about it?
---
Any system where people are not able to force an abdication will eventually fall victim to this sort of silliness. I guess people just have to move on or make an establishment of their own.
---
The kind of person who would care to buy a rare ship like this one, methinks...
---
I would have but it got kind of crazy and I forgot to get the footage...
---
Wow,... so at that point it's basically a 25k dollar painting that you can even hang on a wall
---
Maybe Sort Dragon should lick the f1 key while posting on reddit.  Only time he is ever going to touch that key.
---
You could ask goons if they got footage of their kill. They were nice enough to let you participate in that titan kill, I bet they'd be willing to share it with you.
---
Unblock all, and block start blocking again. It's like double satisfaction.
---
Only if you have very special needs, but there are sometimes people who can learn if you get them to sit down.
---
What does 'toggle auto tracking' do for the orbit cam? I tried enabling it but I don't see any difference.
---
Theres a good chance some people have lost sight of what eve really is. A great, fun and complex game, but a game nonetheless.
---
[deleted]
---
...? Are you saying that because Ariel is almost as dumb as Seddow this somehow applies to our entire alliance?
---
You are right, EVE Uni is in his own league, by itself. 
---
A burning pile of shit league, down there, all alone.
---
Literally joining any random corp beside a scam corp would be a better bet than EVE Uni.
---
Well if the best way you can suck that bad, you should accept the criticism and improve or step down.
---
They proved they can't take criticism, therefore...?
---
I really hope we full commit to this, Darkness should have been deleted off the sov map a long time ago.
---
But you don't need a corp for any of that shit : join a real corp right away who are open to newbros and use online ressources to get started or stay in NPC corp a week or two. What is the use of EVE Uni corp, beside being wardecced and failing at being any good at helping newbros get into PvP?
---
No, he doesn't let himself get set up like that
---
There are many smaller groups in the game who are friendly, and don‚Äôt engage much in the politics of eve. May I suggest trying out wh corps, they tend to be tight knit due to the nature of living in wormholes. I myself have bounced around a lot of corps before finding a home, I‚Äôve had 3 homes so far and I stay in touch with people from those 3 groups still. You just have to find your tribe, so to speak.
---
So looks like Pittsburgh is still dread bombing with goons?
---
Why not? Had his for a while
---
Yikes, Gotg can't even form up against PL and NC let alone Tapi.
---
drama to entertain some folks isn't most outlandish thought, I'd agree
---
I thought it was a decent AAR. It covered the basics, positive and negatives, so what more do you want? It isn't in the standard narrative format, but so what?
---
As for leadership, during my time in E-Uni, most of my time was spent going out on roams and learning PvP. I never dealt with leadership, other than Conci when I was in the WH campus, and he was fine.
---
The point is, dealing with leadership in E-Uni isn't required to learn what E-Uni can teach you about the game. Line members don't usually see the reasoning for why decisions are made, they just see a decision they don't like, and blame it on bad leadership.
---
And set safeties to red or yellow.
---
&gt; Not necessarily. I know a lot of people that use active rep fits like this to rat or do escalations
---
An active rep tengu can do 10/10s that only spawn in null; and can fit covert to slip and and out. 
---
Hell, I have run them in hostile staging system. Using one on high sec escalations has to be a waste of missiles.
---
I want to see the loss mail as well but only because I love spaceship explosions.
---
If you want to avoid politics, you best be prepared to take it up the ass to be honest, chief.
---
I'm sure we will, people always step up when he disappears
---
This aged well.
---
Bounties are there for two reasons; either to fuck with you, or to see if you are still active.
---
My corp would constantly place bounties on each other saying "8008135" or some other stupid shit.
---
Alt acct, kill yourself, profit...
---
It's just an overhyped underdelivered non-feature, like most things CCP release these days.
---
Lets not overstate the risks of that if you do it right. Nothing ballsy about that.
---
This  filaments is something like  "Battle!" button in WordofTanks, awful, no more searching for content, just stay in station an push "Battle!". How dare are you!!!!
---
Jesus fuck why do people still post these pictures of ships merged
---
Goddamnit
---
Yeah, still Fergus, still doing a great job. üëç
---
Can you elaborate on what issues you are having when trying to fit the Microwarp drive? I'm not having any issues  [https://imgur.com/a/uxF9KiV](https://imgur.com/a/uxF9KiV). No special trick to fitting it, just make sure you have enough spare CPU and powergrid, the required skills trained and drop it into the fitting screen.
---
Are you assuming that the 500MN MWD has hull restrictions?  These are normally listed under the Attributes tab of the item in question under "can be fitted to" (take a look at micro jump drives for an example). The only restriction on fitting most mods are the powergrid and CPU requirements. Fits with over sized prop mods are not uncommon. You can fit medium projectiles on the Rifter and Torps on the Drake if you *really* want to. It'll just be completely un-bonused and take most of your fitting resources!
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
They're keeping tabs on what the devs do with the characters.
---
For example: Not allowed to be in any sort of major corp's director positions. Not allowed to do anything that could have major market impact.
---
And if a dev seeded something to favor TEST or something, it would raise a lot of alarm bells with Internal Affairs.
---
Hey, i'm not saying i would do it. i just think it would be funny to see, besides i'm allready seeing this.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/eao7g1/forced\_pvp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/eao7g1/forced_pvp/)
---
Well, yes. Unless you are truly too dumb to take a look, you should have seen that your phone auto corrected. It's no rocket science.
---
Dreddit is recruiting
---
Should we take this as an official statement of the EVE University Diplomacy Department?
---
good luck fighting the TZ tank
---
Good. At least there's someone competent running something in what was Eadrom's directorate.
---
Not really. Either play as whore engi or whore medic. Always go to the hottest spot. If you are engi find a MAX and babysit the damn thing while spamming amoo packs for densely packed areas. When medic only sit at high killzone chokes and just revive people constantly. Within 2 hours you will be swimming in certs for whatever your heart desires. Repeat until desired build is achieved.
---
&gt; Speaking as the lead strategic fleet commander for USTZ
---
what does that even mean for NC?
---
That's their #2 Diplo talking.
---
Hmm that actually makes me wanna play the game again.
---
&gt;Weren't these the people that decided that no one should undock during wartime?
---
Actually, I think the current CEO might have been the one to remove that rule, despite showing some obvious mishandling of stuff here.
---
Stop loving gate keeping as much as gate camping. They aren't the same thing. You can't gank a player until they actually start playing Eve.
---
Or just dont accept a random fleet invite from someone you dont know? lol
---
Im still fucking shocked that it works to this day for supers/titans on tether
---
Surely you can see my point is that the two corps offer different things, and can't be compared, this was in response to someone encouraging Uni members to leave and join RvB , which would always be the right fit.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I don't know if it was a check and balance to that.
---
It's likely any that were powerful in a group were known by other directors.
---
One thing is that now players may stop the "CCP doesn't play their own game" rhetoric, because they'll be able to see what CCP players are doing (or at least some).
---
Is it a statement by the corp's #2 diplomat? It's rather counterproductive to any sort of neutrality policy for a diplomat of any level of seniority to be devolving into petty insults against other corporations and alliances because you are unable to handle your own being criticized for being unable to handle constructive criticism.
---
There's a Goonswarm diplomat who has a habit of saying stupid things on Reddit. He can get away with it because his alliance is not trying to be neutral and has enough capital ships to deter any in-game retaliation. What about when you say stupid things on Reddit?
---
[https://www.isdredditrecruiting.com/](https://www.isdredditrecruiting.com/)
---
Yeah, I just put in like a 1 quadrillion auction and recorded the core amount.
---
Maybe it's 1 core per 3x Plex price.
---
That's ONLY if the other option is to not complete the raffle at all.
---
Well, they did fight frat in the same tz. Guess it will be fun to watch.
---
nope. before they could lose their jobs for it, now they can't. the barrier of entry for egotistical dipshits to take advantage of impressionable retards just got erased. not that I give a shit, mind you. whatever, they're desperate, they'll try anything... fair enough.
---
Hahahah.
---
you're doing a really shit job of actually explaining your point
---
It's like 35 mb. But I don't have dos to run it
---
they had the rule for 12 years because of the t20 scandal. are you dumb?
---
they decided it'd be cheaper to blanket ban ccp employees from ever being identified in eve than to have an internal affairs department auditing every employee's characters to make sure they weren't doing anything dishonest, and fair play to them 12 years ago, that was a reasonable solution
---
but the ban included things like, you're not allowed to be on voip, which basically blanket stopped anyone in ccp from participating in any sort of serious pvp group
---
that's been lifted
---
that's a *good* thing, because for the past 12 years while they haven't been allowed to actually play the game ccp have been making decisions about eve based on how they feel about it (stupid) and what the csm tells them about it (biased)
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/431/201/40f.png
---
then you're stupid and not worth listening to lmao
---
you're dumb
---
to clarify:
---
how many people were actually there at the time, not just nerds who heard about it 45th-hand via reddit?
---
Where do I sign up?
---
Noice
---
Come join horde we are a great isk making null block
---
Do u reckon I can do them in my frig?
---
Huh. T20, Mark II INCOMING!
---
what just because I don't agree with you doesnt mean im going to just tell lies
---
Everyone who learned from this works somewhere else now.
---
Would I have to join one of these corps which are part of an alliance which is part of a political coalition?
---
This corp is full of some of the most toxic players I‚Äôve ever encountered.
---
Block them and live a happier life in Eve.
---
It has a niche.  More so when we had a lot fewer newbro friendly corps.  
---
All you heard back in the day was getting scammed by this group or that. No one wanted low SP people.  Come back when you can fly our battle ship doctrine and we will take a look at your killboard.  Better be very green or we will laugh at you.  
---
A lot of people needed a safe harbor to ease into New Eden, get a few SPs, and get a little hang of the game.  Once they had their feet wet a little then it was off to LS to seek their fortunes.  
---
Now it‚Äôs a lot better.  
---
More than a few very stable and well known NS groups and NPSI to serve that purpose.  Alpha friendly doctrines.  Most big NS groups can give a shit about Zkillboard.  
---
Still though many people want to hang around a bit in HS before taking the plunge, and that‚Äôs just fine.  When they get tired of it, and build up their confidence a little, they will move on.
---
My somewhat limited perception may be based on the video I saw, where this creep, called "mittani" gave me quite a cringe.  But I'm sure you're right. There must be friendly and fun alliances as well. I don't even know why I'm weary of big corps.
---
Wait, what!?  Why the hell not lol.  It‚Äôs a big part of the game and a huge appeal to some players that all of that is allowed within the game.
---
Is it in case you get accused of using inside info to do it or something?
---
Edit:  also who decides what is evil :D
---
Not in a drug but it's takes a month to train into a bs for warp to me incursion (which can also be done in alpha ) and you make great isk too
---
You can also in a drug for now go around and salvage there rekts
---
yeah I'm not trying to say you're stupid or your point is categorically wrong you're just not doing a very good job of presenting it, to the point where no one really know what you're actually trying to say, so
---
I'm not posting as a Diplo at no point have I said I was.
---
Nice.
---
/u/CCP_Kitty mind explaining why you kept typing, "7ss777777huuuuuuuuuuuuuudjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkmkmkmkmkmkmkmkmkmkmkmkv[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[v[" in various forms in local?

Wlvs is recruiting
---
PM me the details
---
HyperNet
---
apart from that. Why you are playing the game? For fun or you are looking for better paying second job? 
---
Go unbeaten road and find something you enjoy. Most of activities will allow you to plex account with fairly low in game time. Just please, don't krab in null. This is more boring than mining in hisec.
---
Incompetent and proud are blue (friendly) to the coalition living in the drones region right now. As they accept anyone into corp without question people can just apply easy throwaway alts, and have them scout ratting supers, rorqs etc. There are several killmails with incompetent and proud sabres on friendly supercaps. How they have not been reset and booted back to HS boggles the mind.
---
your posting makes me cringe bro
---
even just weed if only 1 guy brought dooby snacks
---
Ya i know. So i dont gamble and dont like the odds with this hypernet, but i wanted to know how other oeople think of it. So does that matter to you that the seller would be getting a lot more than if they sold it outright?  Say you bought 1 ticket for 500 mil. You win (i know, just run with it).  So you now have a virtuoso for 500 mil. So do you care that the seller is getting more and that's why you dont purchase tickets?
---
Yeah I'm sure CCP will be joining the shit rental alliance belonging to a pet alliance &lt;3
---
are you referring to the ubiquitous upper-upper-double-dutch-upper-decker sir? it takes a gang of truly skilled fleet members just to have the coordination to pull it off, nevermind achieving minimum spillage
---
you're fucking retarded
---
LOL siege brown I think there holmes
---
U meanie :(
---
Damn, so we do have an AT ship that was won. Im sure with the raven the issue may have been the 8 bil tickets and 4 trillion price the seller (and PGL by doing it on his stream lol) would have received.
---
Interesting.
---
Thanks again for the help!!
---
Ah ok so a hi-sec corp that is to trusting for null basically, thanks.
---
should have read this before grabbing popcorn 
---
such a waste
---
They biomass, all their characters I got mail from are in Doomheim.
---
Come join us in Ashes of Light! We're a nullsec indy Corp with teeth! We live in the spire next to the panfam coalition. :D
---
Are you allowed to be in a wormhole mercenary alliance?
---
Note this may not be the best idea: it stops anybody who wants to message you from doing so without paying. I‚Äôd just join their pub and ask for and officer, and see if they‚Äôll take you off the list
---
Sounds more like she has new players create wealth for her and takes it all.
---
Get out of highsec so they can't find your char I guess?
---
In my defense, screenshot on a laptop is like a 3-handed affair...
---
Gonna put Taka's diplo skills to the...test
---
^^*hyuk* ^^*hyuk* ^^*hyuk*
---
CCP: It's not gambling, it's wealth creation.
---
Also CCP: If you suffer from problem gambling you can opt out by messaging a GM.
---
I agree, if i wanted to buy an at ship i would buy it, not gamble for the chance to buy it at prettt trash odds
---
Just saying it‚Äôs a deterrent. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw someone who had their ‚Äúpay to mail me‚Äù button turned on
---
Most major alliances are war decced indefinitely. This makes doing anything in high-sec without an out of corp alt nearly impossible. If you're planning to join a major group, your best bet is to commit fully to that group. Trying to manage assets and activities in multiple places is very difficult without having alts specific to those activities. It's extremely time consuming and frustrating.
---
Even if you join a null-sec or low-sec group that doesn't deal with constant war decs, you're going to have a hard time splitting your activities this way. There's just too much travel involved. Do you set your home system to your corp's staging system, so that you can suicide yourself to staging for ops? Or do you set it to your high-sec home, so you can suicide there to make isk? Either way, you rely on jump clones (which will have a 24 hour cooldown) or you rely on flying back and forth, which will quickly start to lose it's appeal to you. Any low-sec or null-sec group worth joining will have easy PVE activities for their new players to use which don't require them to spend time in high-sec. 
---
The advantage of moving out of high-sec is that the PVE activities are generally better isk/hour. You can follow around corp mates and alliance mates and salvage their sites, if that's something you enjoy doing. You'll have better ores to mine if that's your interest. You'll have better ratting, there's even low-sec and null-sec security agents if that's really what you want to do, and those agents pay out more than their high-sec equivalents. 
---
Anyway, if this is really what you want to do, then jump clones are your friend. Look into the skill "Infomorph Psychology", and get familiar with how clone mechanics work. Learn how to set your home station so that you can quickly return to whichever space you'd like to be your primary residence.

Lowsec

Thanks, good to know. Have a few big toys in null, so I might try to get them out this way.
