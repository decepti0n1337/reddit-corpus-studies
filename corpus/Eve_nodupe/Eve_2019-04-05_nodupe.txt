Admiral Holdo, is that you? 
---
PVT Estimates the BPO at 12 billion isk ... so 13% tax of that 
---
And you obviously dont realize that they are run in high second literally 24/7.. So again I said yes maybe second to rat bounties ONLY due to the ubiquity of general ratting and how easy vni's are to afk.
---

---
Incursions still print isk JUST as fast as a ratting super.. The ratting super you can at least catch. Im not saying they are equal but we need to pay attention to both as they BOTH are the Largest isk faucets in the game with maybe the exception of WH C5-6's but those arent infinitly spawnable. And to bring back up soak alts.. At least you cant soak a ratting anom you generally limited to 1 intense ratter and afk alts which make far less. Where soak alts make the same no matter the engagement.
---
So the real problem were both kinda hinting at is super ratting makes a bokners amount of isk which I wont deny or argue.
---
Who's on first.
---
looks like a good haven sb candidate

You get that off wormholers right?
---
Armored standard tactic is the "jockey" .
---
"jockey left" or "jockey right" 
---
After firing the driver slams her in reverse and draws back under the guidance of the crew Commander to a new firing position.
---
Traditionally this helped reduce the risk of return fire, or trig based counter artillery.
---
These days we have thermal, and the exhaust plume from armor putting the pedal to the floor may as well be a signal flare, but we still enjoy bashing through the bush in reverse at max acceleration. Until you hit a tree to thick to break. 
---
And we still dont have the Palatine keepstar

So was lowering the SP amount required to pilot capital and super capital ships IN CONJUNCTION WITH Skill Injectors.

Just train corp contracting 4 on your skillfarm and throw them all in your main altcorp. Who doesn't have 600 contract slots these days?

You're researching in a high index system. The more research jobs installed in a system, the higher the system modifier, and the higher the install fee.
---
Go research that in Bullard or some dead end highsec island

---
Are you listening CCP?  All you need to do to have an awesome game is devote a few customer service types to ratting in poorly fit titans on "injected" noob accounts.  Would help if you train them to cry in local and make a reddit post when they lose said titans.
---
That's entertainment right there.

judging from his posting history more so retarded is the better word

Where can I see the systme index for that?

You are dumb and should not post. In order to declare war (a highsec thing), then you must declare a structure in high sec space as the War HQ.

This is why we have no AT.

That was a 1.5b crystal pod as well lmao
---
Role bonus
---
can fit 5 Doomsday Modules
---
70% reduction to Doomsday cycle time
---
1) Pay someone else to do everything you possibly can, especially hauling. 
---
2) Get good at using pyfa/multifit to reduce the amount of logistics overhead required to stock your own hangar. (Or, if your staging is well enough stocked, just buy shit off contracts; or, get FCs to import your roaming ships for you, etc.) Basically, avoid fiddling around with modules and the like. 
---
3) Optional, but you can cut down a lot on your time overhead by not managing a private 10-char capital armada (each pilot with multiple shiptypes, refits, backup dreads, backup fax, etc, plus cyno alts). If you exclusively play your main + 1 cap alt (optional + dedicated dread or dedicated fax pilot, + titan if that sort of alliance) you lose a lot of versatility and power, but it's a lot less to keep track of.

The ship in question was the Molyneux, a Solteur that was hijacked by Salvador Sarpati himself. He based the Vanquisher on its tech.
---
shurly its a mining ship that can turn into a station .
---
FEDUP left or is leaving galmil actually so that they can participate in legacy's hisec war. WANGS considering rejoining since they won't have the expense of a perma wardec on fedup.
---
I think it's a station, not a ship
---
Yeah :/ spent all my money on the Mod
---
What's that? Imperial navy with scorch????????? Yes please.
---
This seems Iapetan sized. If you have the original install disc for Eve, the Iapetan models are in it, so you can extract them and see them. I found a link to them here https://m.imgur.com/r/Eve/7G0OI
---
So the speed reduction isn’t the main reason to bling webs, it’s all about range. So this web wouldn’t give you any advantage w/ gate camping. You’d be better off bringing a Hyena
---
The original install disc for Eve contains the Iapetan models. Here are pics of them https://m.imgur.com/r/Eve/7G0OI
---
I think it has a thrusters so it can maneuver through abyssal space, probably has its own "conduit" generator too. I don't think we will be able (or should be able) to use them, this is probably for like "raid boss" abyssal rooms
---
[removed]
---
For lore you could aim to live in a COSMOS constellation. I think one of the Gallente constellations borders metropolis. It’s less convenient than basing out of Dodixie. Dodixie is also not that far from Genesis and more fun. 
---
Maybe, It makes some sense Vs. a flyable ship of such size.
---
But they are doing an awful lot of hyping for what will be PvE content, Esp seeing how hard the shipyards (Which would be its equivalent) have flopped for most.
---
You can fly any race’s specialized t1 industrials as an alpha. Even with level 1 industrial they are very useful. If you are in a big mining op someone needs to be ferrying ore in a miasmos.
---
I mean surely this module costs a shitloads of isk to buy, right?

---
Pirate factions in npc null space have lvl 4 agents and those LP tend to be more valuable than the empire corp agents and many null alliances have special interest groups that run said missions. 
---
One of my characters lived about 4 jumps from Dodixie, in Cat. On a pipe so people could pass through, and a few stub branches nearby that were quiet for exploration and event site running. Easy run to Dodixie to buy and sell whatever. 
---
Yeah I'm in your neighborhood, Hecarrin. I run combat anoms/sigs within 5-6 jumps in every direction farming escalations.

1. Fly it over in a scouted ship

2. Travel ceptor

---
4. Scan a WH. Easiest when you start from desto then probe to highsec.
---
5. Black ops
---
6. Other caps
---
7. A Titan bridges your freighter
---
Its not the low end tags you need though, its the high end. People prefer to blitz L4 missions and farm the LP. Should be interesting to see if we'll see battleships and strategic cruisers actually doing full clears.
---
Sounds MechWarrior-ish.  I like it.
---
Not all faction guns have the same bonuses, and the specialization skill multipliers still have t2 weapons out-damage faction guns.
---
Some players will chose to bling some ships (most likely high end pirate frigates most likely due to the hull damage multiplier making up for the low amoint of turret or missile hardpoints) but not all players will switch to faction guns all the time.
---
For some, the cost is worth it. For most, it's probably not. 
---
More like "Using in-game chat in 2019"
---
I doubt prices will come down that much though. The problem with faction weapons is more than just demand. The cost in terms of tags is crazily overpriced compared to most modules. Take a look at the Tribal Liberation Force store and the 200mm Autocannon. The LP cost is manageable but the turn in items require over 300 tags. That's absolutely insane. In contrast a power core or medium shield extender needs 2 tags. You have to do an absolutely crazy amount of farming for a single 200mm autocannon and drastically extend the chances of getting caught as you need to loot so many ships. You can get the tags for the power core or shield extender in one or two missions but for the autocannon you are looking at fully clearing and looting a stupid number of missions.
---
Unless the LP store trade in costs for these come down the bulk of them are still never going to be available because it is always going to be more cost effective to buy other stuff. Nobody is going to grind for weeks at FW missions and plexes to then turn around and buy the least cost effective items on the store, especially if their market prices come down.
---
Prior to game launch?
---
You know there's one in perimeter right?
---
It’s a trap!
---
I endorse this message.
---
Not 100% sure. EVE Uni stages out of there. So because of that it has a better market than usual. But I usually just bring a load over from Dodixie until I run out of them.
---
yes, this sounds verifiable
---
PM :p
---
It does.  It pulls the market price for the mod and minerals it reprocesses into, and then calculates values/deltas/etc.
---
Will only take you 45 minutes to kill a flight in full tidi if you're on a keep star grid and can't smart bomb. Good luck extracting anything at that point. 
---
You can't go wrong with Villore - the FDU station is probably the best supplied and can pick up very cheap Navy Vexors as it is a Gallente FW LP cash in spot. FW is a decent way to get into PVP if you haven't before.
---
If you like mining try out Actee (in a highsec island) 3 jumps from Villore. Watch out for OMS / Heyd though as often camped by fast locking Russians.
---
Orvolle is a good spot too nearby if you want to venture out into null. Good luck. 
---
Exactly 
---
You can't. And even if you could, there would be a huge possibility that you'll just get killed and podded back to you home station. 
---
Hi, TTT customer service here.  Unfortunately we're experiencing high load on our research systems currently, and this is increasing the price for any new orders.  You could wait for another time and check back to see if the line has shortened.  Thank you for your continued business!
---
PGL doing customer service here is like Elon Musk doing the same thing on twitter... We need more of this.
---
Just like how it broke Star Wars logic!
---
The issue is that could be a result of the lack of gameplay in FW. 
---
Investing only in the mode that is currently big will often create a very stale environment and also means your not gonna appeal to new people. 
---
he's lazy, wh are a pretty nice option to move stuff

Good idea. These posts go into the digital dumpster after they leave the front page.

Yeah... do that after 35 plus jumps one way and then talk to me.   Not just doing ammo here anyways.  Unlike most, I got the patience to wait for the wormhole.  Doesn't hurt that my alliance has a group that loves to do wormhole diving too.

I dare CCP to try one of those events again and see how well that goes.

Who says you can't space truck as an alpha? 
---
Grab a tech 1 industrials and fit it for your preferred combo of cargo space, tank, and align time and get trucking!
---
As an alpha you can get over 20,000 m³ of general cargo space on an industrial while having at least some tank.  Work the specialized industrials like Miasmos you can haul even more of a specific cargo like ore or minerals. 
---

There's a few non-FW L4 missions you can farm for an entire week for faction tags. Your standings with the opposing faction go to shit but you can do it in the safety of highsec, with a marauder. Takes about 15-20 minutes a day. You don't pop the mission complete trigger, and the rats reset during downtime.
---
are you selling? asking for a friend
---
Honestly it's a 102 day job. Even in a low-index system you'd be paying a pretty penny to research it.
---
If he would actually go live in tama, i'm sure the locals would make a fine pirate out of him in time, assuming he makes it to there and is not too shy or salty to ask questions and socialize
---
This would draw in a lot more players from twitch and stuff. The lack of immersion the tactical view creates makes it really hard to draw in players who are expecting gameplay to look more like the trailers.
---
For the sake of immersion a zoomed in 3rd person camera being eves primary view would make the scale of the game feel most impactful. I understand why this probably won't ever happen but im just saying... CCP can add as many supertitans as they want but it will never create the immersion and scale a lot of players want to experience.
---
Obviously we need tactical as our primary view for combat in most cases. I like the idea of having the tactical and immersive cameras separated so they can be on screen at the same time and/or being able to rapidly switch between them as desired.
---
Stainguy &lt; 1 mill 
---
...
---
We're waiting
---
This 100% the problem is not the game the problem is people are really bad at figuring shit out 
---
I think it’s that and the catch up factor is really a tough pill to swallow. They need to figure out how to add a system for skills that is actually rewarding to undock. I think for your first 10million skills points you should be able to gain extra skill points by using the damn skills. Put drones in the skill queue and use drones should make you gain those skills faster 
---
Remember tho if you lose them when they are worth 50 mill each you still lost 400 mill total even if you bought them for 10mill total.
---
Npc content in any game is always boring what makes eve great is that the content is produced by the players . This guy above me is right

That is, however, not in the requested/suggested change.  And would defeat the purpose of the *years* of effort CCP have already put into their design philosophy for Standup/Citadel style structures.

Sub-2s yacht or sub-2s prorator (requires nomad set) if you're not poor

This is bizarrely exciting. Would be really cool if we had freeport keepstars in 1 low sec in every region
---
as long as you mange to cloak. you will have plenty of time to bug out. been moving shit in and out of null in a proteus for a long ass time. never got caught. 
---
I'm assuming T2 Large ammo will be Omega-locked however?
---
Seeded market. When I'm buying stuff outside of Jita, I'm usually buying ammo, drugs, charges, or certain modules to change a fit I have or fix fitting issues with meta modules. I'm not in an alliance, so I don't really have any use for pre-fit ships. If I were in an alliance, it would probably be convenient to have doctrine ships/tackle ships/etc on contract for convenience.
---
Overwatch
---
I ran a LS market for around a year, what I noticed was, most pilots preferred to have a stocked market over the option to buy ships on contract if they had to choose one or the other. I think it goes back to players wanting their own freedom of choice with what they fly even if what's up on contract is pretty much what they ended up buying. The only exception was in selling capitals, those sold much better on contract when compared to listing them on the market. If you have enough funds though, try a mix of both, it will get your market more exposure and you can see for yourself what works best in your area of space. 
---
I mean, TEST has killed Horde's ISK sink, there's no denying that, but they haven't managed to monopolize the market the way that PH had for a while. 
---
I mean, how is that even hard to understand? Horde's highsec campaign [was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past) more effective at the time than TEST's [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) right now. 
---
No...for some reason I have a feeling I've seen that too.
---
I've had the same thought for a while, would love to have something like this. I used those cameras in X3 a lot. This would also be useful for streamers and other content creators 
---
The way I see it, the people who wish to play exclusively free were never customers to begin with. The whole point of the extended trial, if I can call it that, is to lure in prospective customers with a taste of what EVE's all about, more than half of which can be experienced without ever getting into a T2 ship or a capital.
---
Those who like it will buy up, feeding the devs in the process.
---
Those who don't are just another few megabytes of server space and bandwidth that can be an acceptable cost of advertising.
---
Theory: this isn't a credit card warrior - it's one of the trillionaire bankers/traders actually giving the rest of the game a go, and failing.
---
Because EVE is always about the propaganda.
---
tbf this should be common sense to anyone who uses a cap in a large alliance...

I just heard suiciding was more rampant, is all.

---
"eligible for a war" means you can be wardec'd.
---
Having a citadel in highsec and designating it as HQ are attacker's conditions to start a wardec.
---
only if the buy orders are that much, or i plan to buy new ones immediately. 
---
I think its easier to seed items like LSEs, webs, scrams/disruptors, RLMLs, damage controls etc And people just buy what they want for their fit. Seeding premade ships means people are locked in a few hulls and a predetermined skill level and fitting room.
---
But can it boosh a keepstar? Asking the real questions here!
---
Can you though? Supporting an alliance or even a very large corporation would require ISK in the hundreds of thousands of dollars long term if you are just actively trying to wreak havoc.
---
You need to get resources on the scale of the major alliances to wreak accomplish that, and when you're paying in ISK instead of friendship, that's expensive.
---
jokes on you, i can fly this ferox with t2 guns as a alpha, and thats enough to reach the endgame meta in eve
---
you funny man
---
So you work with 6 people in order to roll a wormhole? Nice. Sounds very epic.
---
Much better than needing 3 chars to roll a wormhole; carrier, scanner, sabre. Fuck that, too much effort. 
---
Market 99% of times. Unless i fly is a fleet doctrine, then i want a fitted ship to save time and prevent misunderstandings / shit fits in fleet. 
---
Non-t2 miners don't have cargo space to load ammo dude.
---
Exactly this. Market for solo and contract for doctrines.
---
 CCP wasted milions and milions of dollars I don't think incompetence should be rewarded 
---
Whatever bitch, if I am forced to upgrade to super or rorqual I'll do it and then laugh at scum like you complaining that they can't get content.
---
You don't deserve any.
---
But alphas can fly VNIs and Feroxes. What more do you need?
---
so you re willing to trust a hisec citadel is going to be in the same place 3 months from now?
---
Honestly though, how is this impressive?
---
Vasari loyalist for life!
---
Go set up some structures, fuel them, frack some moons and mine them yourself. Then come back, read your "suggestions" and try not to cringe.
---
I love having doctrine ships on contact but if it's something I'm making for myself, I absolutely would rather buy it piece by piece.
---
Why would you bot a VNI? That beauty basically bots itself?
---
Definitely. Have done both options in the same area on prior occasions, and the seeded market goes much better than the contracted pre-fits. That also allows for people upgrading existing ships they have (don't want to buy a whole new hull just because you finally got the skills for [insert random module here] on a ship you already have). I got a lot of people buying their first ship after literally just skilling into it, and the basic T1 mods to fit it, and then show up on my transactions a month or so later replacing some of those mods with the T2 variants.
---
Also, if you're running T2 charges/ammo/drones, folk will pay waaay over the odds to save jumping to a trade hub. I actually had my boyfriend buy a bunch of hob 2s from one of my orders in our local at the time, and when I pointed out I had them listed at double what they were in the trade hub a whole 5 jumps out, he just shrugged and declared it wasn't worth the time to go all the way there to save a few million in the middle of his ratting. 
---
Be warned, 'rural' space is feast or famine. I sometimes went a whole month without a single local sale, then got my stock cleared out inside a week. You need to be prepared to not make instant returns on what can be a sizeable investment. 
---
My 2 cents:
---
20m Osprey with a predicted lifespan of about 20 minutes -&gt; contracts.
---
500m Devoter -&gt; you better believe I'm cracking open my case of faction mods and so I only need the hull.
---
The Caldari Prime planet in Luminaire system used to be under Caldari control, cuz its the homeland of Caldari people.
---
But years ago the Caldari Titan floating around and defending Caldari Prime was destroyed by Gallente in an assault, thus the system is now fully under Gallente control. See [this brief report](https://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-battle-of-caldari-prime.html) for details.

thats not an exploit, it a natural thing.
---
Hurray, we are all software engineers and this exponentially increases the validity of our claims.
---
Iapetan titans are even bigger than this thing, I'd guess closer to the size of a keepstar. 
---
Have them all turned off. Didn't realise there was a theme here.
---
s-
---
Can alpha clones use Faction weapons? And if so will they be able to use T2 ammo?
---
Best method is fitted ships insured by you on contract, but listed without rigs.
---
Then seed the rigs at a nice markup
---
That is no moon
---
if these ships seek out ADM, they will mess up Delve and it will be a capital slaughterhause
---
Committed Alphas are the equivalent of "professional" Instagram influencers. They do nothing for the business except add costs, but hopefully they add some word of mouth advertising. It's not a terrible business model as long as the business can sustain the extra load they create, because advertising is expensive, but they are in no way the target demographic.
---
I've left a couple of accounts lapse because of financial issues caused by inability to work due to an injury (hopefully won't be much longer before can get back to work, it's driving me crazy!) and really appreciate that I still have the option to play those accounts at all: the limited Alpha state is really a kindness in situations like mine. But I know that those accounts are 'taking' from the game without giving anything back, so much as it's annoying to have a chunk of skills/options locked out, it's understandable, and I'm grateful to be able to log in at all. And fully intend to start paying again as soon as I'm able to afford it. My main had a Plex stash from prior purchases, and I see nothing wrong with expecting me to pay (via using Plex pre-purchased by me or others, or current cash) for the luxury of keeping that one in Omega state. Hopefully I'll be able to return to paying CCP directly before I run out of Plex or the Isk to buy it, but if I don't, I wouldn't expect them to change their business into a charity just because of my little sob story.

You could move to The Forge, which is on the cross roads to everywhere in EVE. I have... memories of Sivala. And Unel. And Tennen :-).
---
Maybe CCP is finally getting on board with the sense of scale complaint we've had for years. Bigger is better.
---
Sounds cool to me. If they touch chat again, we will get more free SP \o/
---
You cannot die unless you grossly fuck up.
---
for the right price, sure
---
&gt; but hopefully they add some word of mouth advertising.
---
That is the best kind of advertising and the additional targets to shoot are a good thing.
---
I am probably the definition of bittervet. Been playing on and off for well over ten years. After running an mildly well known small null corp for a while I burnt out horrendously and could never get back into eve without burning out within weeks. This time I joined horde and I love it. I probably log in three times a week and every time there is something happening. 
---
You guys. :D
---
The problem with buying all of it up is CCP puts the money from PLEX into a protected account. They do not access it until the PLEX is cashed in (due to folks performing chargebacks and the like).
---
Therefore, buying up all the PLEX so that folks can't cash it in is actually taking food OFF of the dinner table, not adding it to it.
---
Cyno alts. 
---
Well, if you bot, and warpcore stab it, you basically can't lose the damn thing. 
---
Bluemelon doesn't boast.  (or puff out his chest, strut around, etc, etc, etc.)
---
Ugh now i want to roleplay this in a place where it truly have some meaning - higsec. 
---
On the contrary, an afk camper is indirectly influencing the game environment and it does so while AFK and risk free. Some even get paid for such an 'activity'.
---
In any case, your argument is flawed, since it suggests that an  undocked Rorqual in he middle of space, or any other pilot/ship just flying around happily, should be risk-free/invulnerable sonce he isnt generating money.
---
goons will find a way to make it mine ORE use it in a way to make rorqs better
---
Something, something, a mobile fort that jump in somewhere. Triglavian response scales with what players have on grid, goons drop titans because what else. Something with this NPC scaling is broken, RIP.
---
It is , you should read to 
---
Hmm, so these Triglavian dudes wants to kill off Drifters and the Sansha, don't they? I wonder what those two factions have been hiding as they're both pretty mysterious as well. Especially if they're going all out on each other.
---
Cyno died and I bounced on the sun, fc what do
---
Ah, ok.... But even if i afk it, who cares about 60M loses a week or so?
---
didnt mittens go on about mother ships in the fire side n meta show last week ..... was he droping hints
---
#makeamamakegreatagain
---
i think i remember looking and the light drones had 0.5 scram strength or something.
---
long time ago now though
---
maybe i belive he was just saying he was used to them being called  mother ships and disliked them renaming them
---
Oh god pls gibsmedat ;o
---
You know a flight of sirens can have 45k ehp+ with FSUs right? Good luck killing them before you get eaten alive by the thousands of dps carriers and supers will apply to you.
---
Gotta give them some faxtion forties
---
Then slowly intergrate yourselfs into their fleets
---
Equipped with an entropic disintegrator that does the damage of a doomsday, has boson AOE, and can track frigs perfectly.
---
contact Quix Unar ingame, he'd probably be interested
---
Yes,there is two kind of c5/Ls 
---
c140 from c5 to ls and m555 from kspace to c5
---
Both are Very Large wormhole so dread/fax/carrier can go through
---
However those are dynamics/wandering wormhole so they are not constant but they are not uncommon plus if you have c5 with a c5/c6 wormhole you can find one down the chain
---
tin foil hat l think he was droping hints lol
---
I like your idea. And since it would be a sov structure, owner could configure it to work for blues only. Buhehehe 
---
Waaaaaaaaaay to fucked up overview. 
---
We can only hope
---
oof
---
Implying the CSM actually have anything to say when CCP presents changes
---
Exchange rates are a bitch.
---
For someone looking to get into market trading (need my JITA alt to be doing something lol) what resources would be most helpful to a newbie? 
---
Now with Co op
---
 Is ammo the food of New Eden?
---
Maybe they also need to look at the cost per item for tags. Rebalance the ratios. Increases and decreases where required. Ie 300 tags per weapon is crazy.
---
Don't worry, it's just a Triglavian rorq that has a mining yield ramp up and can fit three panic switches
---
so this is a . store your super, and have it transferred to an npc station shortly service?
---
Before or after a keres damps it to shit?
---
Time to bump all the titans at once
---
20b isk and an equal amount of salt
---
But but but...its all about the dps...lol. i guess folks arent looking at the fittings. Glad someone else looks at other things other that MAX DPS NOW. 
---
"a while" bit of an understatement lol.
---
gotta make up that money somehow
---
also closing the sub loopholes where people could pay for a sub for literal pennies
---
Can we get 1 armour, 1 shield super in every hanger .... ohh ye and 1 FCKING! monthership from hell
---
a marauder maybe ? 
---
 
---
Doing so will give all attributes a value of 30.
---
&gt;There will be a time of reflection and adversity, however the people of new eden will see this as a step forward - Hilmar
---
This is our forced evolution. We are all being FORCED to adapt to this, to make way for Attributes being taken away. All skills after the removal will train at the same speed no matter what. No more Min/Maxing.
---
all stats to 30 sounds nice. :D

Hum.... not great either

Proponuje ustanowic swiatowy dzien CCP. Co prawda jeszcze nie wiem jaki mialby to byc dzien w kalendarzu ale wiem w rocznice jakiego wydarzenia by sie odbywal. Tego dnia dzieci rysowalyby laurki z twa.... kurwa nie te czasy, wroc... robilyby memy z twarzami Falcona, Guarda czy progodlegenda (kurwa kto mu taka ksywke wymyslil, pewnie maszyna losujaca). Z calego kosmosu tubylcza poczta dostarczalaby do przystani prezenty. Pod tym brzydkim pomnikiem, ktorego pewnej pieknej nocy obsikalem... spokojnie Arrendis, nie denerwuj sie, najpierw sprawdzilem gdzie lezy Twoja klepka i sikalem z drugiej strony, no chyba ze mi sie pojebaly strony, ale oby nie...no.. to pod tym pomnikiem skladane byly kwiaty, tylko pamietajcie, nie wience, i nie znicze. Piloci dzwoniliby do radiostacji i mowili co w samych superlatywach o CCP a w telewizjach polecialaby kampania reklamowa pod haslem, stop przemocy wobec CCP. Do przystani przychodziliby Tubylcy i zapewniali, ze cokolwiek ludzie mowia to CCP ciagle jest z nimi. Zorganizowana zostalaby zbiorka pieniedzy. No i wiadomo, nie mozna byloby podac prawdziwego jej celu, bo raz ze to by mogloby nie wypalic, a dwa ze to nie bylaby wtedy na pewno gra. Wiec zbierano by pieniadze na biedne i chore dzieci, a za zebrana kwote kupiloby sie tyle PLEXu ze o ja pierdole a moze i jeszcze wiecej. CCP tez czlowiek! Choc niekompetentny...
---
Looks yoo gee ell why
---
Nerf aircraft carriers, they are the reason omega prices are going higher!

So if you aren't a newbro corp you're 'elite'

Okay then 
---
Does anyone know how NPC standings work,
---
My Amarr faction standing is at -10. (running gallante missions)
---
but i need to go to amarr soon to join some friends.
---
i understand i can run level 1 amarr missions until the faction police dont shoot me.
---
my question is is there any other way of getting my amarr standings up and not getting shot by police, what level standing do i need to no get shot at? -2.0? 
---
if anyone has some solid info please post to me :)
---
Surely it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that only a few regions in nullsec are actually being mined, no...
---
If this happens it will be one of the dumbest additions CCP has **ever** made to Eve
---
Next thing it'll be SuperSuperTitans 2 years from now, then UltraTitans a year after that
---
Victory is at hand for the Unity \o/
---
Isn't 202 rand ~$15 US?
---
Including filament cost?
---
 "Only for accounts subbed prior to 2008."
---
People in this part of the world weren't paying pennies. It's a poor region and Eve was always a game you could play on a potato so I'm sure a lot of people appreciated the discounted sub. Anyway, I'm not trying to tell CCP how to run their businesses, this was meant as a PSA for people who might have missed the mail.
---
that's good for stealing keepstars tho
---
Skill urself
---
Capitalist pigs!
---
Isnt that only on steam? 
---
ya all i have to do to payfor my subs is to register in those regions and vpn to those regions while i'm purchasing plex
---
you could get subs for like a dollar or two, ya can dump $100 a month for 50 skill farm accounts gettin you like 90b a month
---
most efficient way to turn $$$ to isk
---
Tbf model size is already fucked. You should make current ships smaller. Bigger ships will just be retarded 
---
I know why they did it. I'm just trying to spread awareness. The announcement mail ended up in my junk mail and I found it purely by chance. Some people might find this post before they find the mail. I know there is a sizable community that pays in ZAR legitimately.
---
Yeah, and only if your account pays in ZAR.
---
1600 diamond rat spidertanked leshaks
---
Sounds like bait
---
Yes?
---
Are you stupid or sheltered?
---
-2 to not be kill on sight.  security tags from ratting is your goal.  either buy on market or grind them yourself.
---
the method will involve you doing missions that involve killing pirate faction ships, cosmic anomalies and asteroid belts killing npcs there.  you can choose to mix it up or focus on one area.  all are good.  you will receive a standings boost for collecting the tags and turning them in, and also a standings boost from the highest value target you kill every 5 minutes of pve (automatically rewarded).
---
the lower sec you rat, the higher the reward.  wormhole space might be best, or lowsec if you’re comfortable with dscan and local awareness.  highsec is doable but will take longer.
---
There are smaller ones, but Spectre Fleet is by far the most active. They have an ingame channel where all the fleets are announced in the MOTD, so you can easily check that channel once in a while and see if any fleets interest you. Their channel is "SF Spectre Fleet"
---
Bjorn Bee public fleets are also quite popular. His ingame channel is "The Beehive" - he usually runs public fleets on weekends, I think? Might be one this weekend, then.
---
Then there's Bombers Bar, https://www.bombersbar.org/, ingame channel "Bombers Bar"
---
Dude the most enjoyable part of wow was exploring and sitting in IF or org. You didn't need to hit end game to enjoy the shit kut of it. 
---
ok so better than -2.0 is my aim.
---
 running missions is the easy option.
---
what im intereted in is the tag option.
---
what tags?
---
where do i take them?
---
is there a limit to the amount of tags i can trade in or the amount of times i can do that?
---
Thank you for the reply i presumed somone had done this before and would be able to explain for me, google searches i found only conflicting or confusing information. nothing solid.
---
in soviet russia station docks  you.
---
Yeah exactly, quite a bit for a lot of people
---
Wait isn't GF mean get a girlfriend and quit eve.
---
This idea has been kicking around for a while on the Eve art and graphics team.  The problem, of course, is that it has the potential to be a huge performance problem, and we did some tests several years ago that suggested that it wasn't really feasible yet.
---
I personally still think it's a great idea, if we can find a way to optimize it so that it won't kill your overall Eve experience.  If nothing else, you'll get a lot more emotional mileage out of seeing your enemies explode in a ball of flame.
---
Prices on steam in India increased from Rs. 600 to Rs. 1049 overnight. I am seriously thinking of quitting now. ( no you cant have my stuff?

Someone who doesnt expect a cruiser to do 1800 dps?

Hehe, you probably jumped the fence a bit too often. :D

Data Center missions are a good way of getting some easy standings. Also be sure to train Diplomacy. Here is a guide on it too.

public fleets for non-cloaky ships? standing fleets  too?

I maybe switched 3 or 4 times corp and never had issue finding a new one.

Can i dock my keepstar in it?

At least it could enter .

I ran one with a Nestor and tried to tank the last room forever. .. well it didnt last long

Thanks man!

For my region it was $35.49 for 6 month, now it's $35.49 but at checkout it costs $71.70, what?

Hello, i´m Alhira and i am member of Fun Inc. We regularly run NPSI fleets at tuesday and thursday in eu tz and every few weeks on saturdays. If you want to fly with us you can join our discord where fleets will be announced. https://discord.gg/78CS3Aa
---
if my sub, that I never actually notice coming out of my bank account, suddenly went up 60% I would be very happy I ran across this thread and probably use all the money I just saved gilding this post ;)
---
loot the blasty boys.  its just a stackable item that you turn in or can sell for ISK on the marketplace to others.  uniwiki will have detailed info regarding tag collection and turn-in.  i am attempting to go on this journey myself but still have yet to.  my 1st gila was blasted as soon as i undocked at a Sisters of Eve agent station.  
---
&gt; They used to have a great website which displayed the ingame MOTD + fleets, but that doesn't seem to work any more.
---
That´s because they moved most of the announcements to the new discord where also a lot of other smaller NPSI groups are represented. [Discord link](https://discord.gg/JzXeb4K)
---
so you can only do the tags once on each agent. meaning this is not somthing i can do each time i need to get my amar standing back up again.
---
Just like all our other super caches.
---
Nope, what makes you untheter is:
---
Warp out / back in
---
Relog

That's about it

It is dumb. But seems to work WoW. Over 5 years they will then reset the damage numbers.

It is really good post, I appreciate it cause I missed the mail. I pay the less price in my region and if it is way more now I would just unsubscribe.

Bounce so hard you drift back into the system you started in.
---
Rote Kapelle ~~is Recruiting ~~ keeps a decent stock of our normal roaming ships up on public contract in Covryn. It's so we can always reship or invite new Bros and randos on fleet and they have something that is useful to the fleet.
---
Usually you need to make them think they can still get a kill. Either my baiting them as much as possible or just tell them to wait.
---
Also, they might not have left but simply cloaked up for most of them.
---
nanites too

Where did you read that exactly? Unless you replied to the wrong comment or you just didn’t read my post properly..

Neither.

Great painting. I wish I had that talent. The best I can draw is a stick cat and a house.

Eh? In game chat? I'm pretty sure you can...
---
Stay the fuck out of covryn

That's a retarded move.
---
Instead of banning people using VPNs to pay less via Steam CCP decides to force players from some countries to either plex or quit.

For Turkey it jumped from 185 lire to 689 lire. LUL

We use Nestors for PvP in WiNGSPAN quite a bit as they are very powerful logi ships and we often fly with only 10 pilots and usually want a lot of DPS. Nestors do both

That would be awesome, I didnt know that receipts were not mandatory. The only reason I ask is because it was my first PVP death and would be good to commerate it.

You appear to be knowledgeable young man, can you tell us what happened to Scotty the docking manager?  I kinda miss him.

Don't worry it can't track small ships. Neither it's 3 launched carriers and 2 Supercarriers.

Just being able to mooring. Should be good enough.

Yeah, but that Discord is a mess compared to having it easily available on a website.

What's the priority of Drone skills for ratting? As in, would I rather have +damage, +speed, +health or +tracking speed first? I intend to max all of these skills eventually but is there any data on which is generally superior?

for 6 months?
---
grins in triangle
---
ok, me stupid
---
No one knows only guessing
---
You can easily run the Archive dual boxing RR nestors though. TBH in my experience it's rarely worth the effort though.
---
That would be a mother ship or a world ship.
---
Agree the loot isnt worth the time and effort
---
Asking that question kinda implies he either cant use google to actually find out or that hes unaware that money is worth different effective amounts to people in other countries.
---
It might be on scale with the Jove mother ships. An since there desedince of Jove would make sense.
---
The mother ships where much smaller then the iapetan Titans
---
Wait so you've been playing eve for cheaper then everyone else for years? And now you expect our sympathy?
---
Credit carding into a Titan does teach you how to fly it... or not lose it.. evidently.
---
cool, thanks for replying :)
---
I'd really like to know how much RL ISK people make per hour. But I do understand that this is pretty private. Just by comparing the average monthly income per capita of european countries in comparison to south africa kinda shows that this is a huge deal if you are not earning an above average income.
---
Does the post look like a call for sympathy? It's a PSA, at least that's how I meant it. Also we earn appreciably less than people in first world countries so yeah, it's a blow to a lot of people.

That's a 6-month subscription. Is a monthly subscription not available in your region?

Weird flex but ok

I could see them being not super-cancerous with decimal scramble strengths, forcing use of multiple drones just to get 1 point, and making it easier to break tackle.

Light: .2 warp scramble strength

Medium: .35 warp scramble strength

Heavy: .5 warp scramble strength

I've started exploring. It's a fun way to make Isk.
---
To avoid null-sec gate camps I jump through a random WH chain to land in null. Sometimes I land in Rouge Drone space which is not that pofitable, but I can just jump into another WH or roam around a bit.
---
The other day I went though a WH and landed smack band in the middle of Goons in Delve. I was tempted to roam, but all surrounding systems were active. I bottled it and jumped back.
---
In my best exploring trip I made 1 Billion Isk in about 5-6 hours. Mostly from Relic sites.
---
Very. Barely anyone knows what a random line member’s voice sounds like off the top of their head, especially with new players joining and leaving constantly so when people say “I” it doesn’t help in the slightest. Speaking in Third Person is vital, otherwise it causes a breakdown in communication.

both sides acting like they wont batphone at the start of a war is always my favourite part.

Even 0.2 would be not 0 so no warp. They could be countered by a venture's built in +2 or a single warp stab, but  i think is preventing mwd/mjd is almost just as important

Its good that they close this loophole.

Its bad that "poorer" regions have to pay more relative to what we pay

So you are saying the reponse to a bathphone is your own batphone? shocking.

This is bad troll post.

Did you only just figure that out, you need to catch up faster.

Let the race for who batphones first begin!

&gt; Even 0.2 would be not 0 so no warp.

Yeah, you're right, idk why I didn't think of that.

Could also add in a mechanic of rounding down scramble strength.

I thought everyone only did honourable 1v1 brawls at sun

Just make sure Vily doesn't use it as a telegraphed mid and we good.

BAG8 c4 wormhole corp is recruiting 
---
Ps : fluent French needed :D
---
That's why I do my research in distant lowsec systems, like Ansasos. It takes longer than researching in player-owned structures but for most player-owned structures there's no guarantee that the owner won't offline the industry slot before I'm done with the research, putting both money and time spent to waste.
---
Interesting way of advertising your corp.
---
I thought the accepted mainstream way was to claim your corp does every single type of activity in the game, and to claim the corp lives in null, ls, hs AND in a wormhole.
---
"but but but x thousand member alliance/ coalition picking on small alliances"
---
Jita. Not 4-4. When you will live in null (probably soon) and all alliance JFs will leave from jita you will appreciate having the stuff you want to send to null there already and not need to buy every little thing while having stacks of them some random place that you used to call home.

Batphones are about the only way some of them even get content.

LEGACY CODE!!

Alphas can't use any ships that have jump drives so they don't need cyno alts.

Out of Focus (Odin's Call) is currently recruiting. We're a PVP focused tightly knit wormhole corporation that lives in a C2-NS/C5 which gets content out of wormhole space and our Nullsec static.

Join the in game channel "OFOC Recruitment" if you're interested.

There is no batphone to be had for Fraternity in their tz as all of it is on Test side. Maybe Siege green lmao low sec noobs. Haha get rekt pandas going to teach you to try to pvp our pets

ps.. 2003 player here with about 10 accounts, 30 percent price increase overnight.  
---
The region affected is also the region with the least content. often 16-17k people online and a lot of those are AFKers and rorq mining fleets who enjoys the silent.  
---
I have played for so long. I'm used to not getting a birthday card, no bitter vet suit when I played for 10 years or any other threat as a loyal customer.. that's fine, I can live with that.

But asking me to accept a 30 percent price increase overnight.. nope.  that's not what I'm going to accept..  and I can only get them to listen by doing one thing and that is to unsub.

EVE Online, where "Come play with us, we're bad at EVE" line is legit ad.
---
&gt;s good that they close this loophole.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Its bad that "poorer" regions have to pay more relative to what we pay
---
What loophole? the salary around here is about 1/6 of in the USA and EU and we got a 30 percent discount. 
---
What about Russia? They get a fair price as well.. did they touch the Russian pricing?
---
Good fight man.
---
The problem is that the same thing would be said by a botter, just go to bed and isk will be made with no effort
---
On your part it's go to bed and the enemy won't make isk with no effort. Assuming you camp as part of a war effort  and every system in their region is camped.
---
Doesn't matter anyway, I'll buy a full tank Aeon and an armor Fax and nobody will be able to do anything to me before a response fleet arrives. What EHP do those have, 35 million?
---
Its what happens when alliances get old and fat, you only care about holding what you've got and how big the tax take is this month.
---
NO
---
In Australia minimum wage for a 21 y/o is 19.8 aussie per hour if youre interested in that statistic.
---
Min wage decreases 10% for every year of age below 21.
---
Oh man a single person from a chinese NC. corp oh man they really are there in full force what a batphone
---
I don't want pvp content involving my ratting ship.
---
If someone doesn't pay attention he deserves becoming content for hunters but with cloaky camping, getting caught and covert cynoed is unavoidable no matter how attentive you are. That is the problem.
---
Don't start shifting the goalposts in the first 5 minutes.
---
Upvoted for more text in one article than i can possibly justify procrastinating on while at work. 
---
Good job.
---
what?
---
Christ 2x no
---
I don't know why you care but i am from EU. 
---
But they cannot also light a cyno for others. 
---
I don't have a horse in this race, I'm just pointing out how dumb it is to think the presence of a single NC. member constitutes a full batphone.
---
*spends the 6 months of the NIP recruiting friends to help them topple all of their foes, planning galactic destruction*
---
*spends the first 2 weeks of the end of the NIP doing..... uh...... apparently absolutely nothing*
---
Great planning there, frat boys. 
---
You're still moving the goalposts, let me help you remember this morning,
---
&gt; I look forward to seeing the BR's with no Skill U, Gotg, Panfam, INIT or TRI on them.
---

You moving the goalposts,

&gt; constitutes a full batphone.

Meanwhile here I was able to pay in ZAR through steam but was paying US prices through the website even though I live in South Africa :derp:
---
What are you saying ? 
---
Bunch of kitey gays live there 
---
Which is fine.
---
bring back lp dumps!!
---
Nooo man don't give up now, lowsec gate to stain is but a few months ahead!
---
It's not about caring, just general curiosity. 
---
USA#1
---
that was probably why they silently changed it in an email that was flagged as junk mail in almost every email service.. ultimately it'll probably be a net loss.
---
I think they tried this once, but then titans became massless #spaghetti
---
jk btw
---
That you’re a moron?  Idk. Go kick in another wormhole but this time don’t call goons.  
---
well...
---
im not working yet, bless my fucking goverment for making it such a problem if you arent on uni...
---
2 years left till i can start working properly, and what? in 1 month i get something like allowance thats enough to pay 3 months omega...
---
now i ll have to dont buy anything at all, including food for 1.5 month to pay for my omega... and now lets say i have 2 accounts... 3 months of not buying anything to get 2 account sub :D

[Dreddit is recruiting!](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/) We're part of one of the biggest nullsec alliances in EVE, Test Alliance Please Ignore. Tons of stuff to do in our space and we're always down for some super fun PVP. If you like caps, we got 'em. If you like subcaps, we got 'em. Come hang out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch) and have a chat!
---
And?
---
You could have the view off your ship centered inside the capacitor view. Would make its little bigger but could be collapsed off needed
---
Lowsec gate to Uganda
---
I just recently started seeding specific doctrine ships to alliance contracts in our staging. It reduces the chance of someone not coming because they do not have the ship required or the proper fit one.
---
I also seed ammo, drones, drugs, implants and other little things that people need.
---
I mark up things a bit, maybe 3%-5% or so, but it's not for the money. It's to make sure we have people in the right ships, at the right time. 
---
People from richer countries could play basically for free easily by changing region
---
I'm just glad the servers did well with so many in system.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

These guys seem pretty fun.

I try to make that point but he doesn't seem to get it. Why should you be able to sit in space with no risk. 
---
Nope there's is no decloak on hit. Only on in Close you can kill someone while he's cloaky an never know.
---
Hey there. Ive start a new corp and allaince called X-Up we are currently looking for members and we also run npsi fleets daily most time small gang but we will be making large fleets as well shortly. Feel free to join our discord for ipdates on when fleets will be happening https://discord.gg/ZpE9ZYp
---
in what world would it make sense to corral goons in with all those other nerds against them in the first dumb list of alliances
---
Pwrhaps they should lower usa game rate to match yours. 
---
Are you so caught up with all this dribble that you fail realise how retarded both sides arguments are?
---
Step back a bit, wanting to shoot people is good. Mindlessly following other peoples narratives and defending it on reddit looks bad on you.
---
They do have a infinite ly jump becon in the game so could be right
---
&gt;Wait so you've been playing eve for cheaper then everyone else for years? And now you expect our sympathy?
---
You sound like a fellow that really understand how the world works! 
---
Well, a lot of players will unsub, it's going to hurt you as well.

What's on second?
---
You mean the colonies? 
---
Using ISK i can plex my accounts for like 10 years.
---
What.
---
I guess I have to say I prefer a seeded market with the absolutely most standard ships being available on contract; doctrines and other very common ones many people need the same of.
---
Multibuy makes buying ships with specific fittings less stressful though. 
---
I don't know's on the third
---
Try Elite Dangerous - it is quite different game. No saying better or worst. Just different.     
---
I usually do stuff like X3 (or X2 even) but not even touching the shit of next versions - way to annoying)                
---
Skyrim is also nice just to completely change the game genre.      
---
Also watch out for Solaris - it will eat months of your life without you noticing it.      
---
Thanks man! Is there a US dude stillin RK called Ivan Ev’ec, or something like that?
---
Huh?
---
As someone that lives in Amamake, I am very happy that there is finally more than one place to dock. There is not nearly enough stations in Amamake!  
---
Also, thanks guys!  I think this will bring more content to our glorious Ama =P
---
I have no idea. I’m just friends with some of the Rote dudes
---
Idk either
---
It actually have noting to do with it.       
---
Many players simply abused this and created new Steam accounts linking them self to different regions - thus paying much lower prices.            
---
Just check how much cost sub from Russia at CCP.      
---
(use any decent HTTP VPN to access the CCP page without logging in)          
---
Not only 
---
Sounds like you need a different hobby if you have to choose between eating and omega.
---
Ooo that’s actually really helpful! Thank you
---
It's hard to see in the image, but yes.  It effectively prevents hostiles from anchoring a citadel anywhere near the keepstar (because of the restriction of how close a structure can be anchored next to another), which has obvious strategic advantages. 
---
Thx man, will look you guys up!
---
Unfortunately I can’t speak french, sorry :(
---
Try paying in USD, British Pounds, or Euros... though fair enough regarding income disparity. 
---
When are you going to stop doing reddit wrong?
---
What if... people just like going to war because fights are fun? And they don’t give a fuck about the propaganda?
---
Are you expecting a SOV offensive from WC or just pretending, Legacy can easily destroy WC if they are serious enough, the reason WC still breathing is the same as why IMP didn't want to invade north. 
---
I'm learning that's true.
---
Should be able to fit T2 painters on the nemesis with faction torp launchers now right?
---
I liked raids.
---
Goons probably aren’t dumb enough to kill the game by actually wiping out all hostile supercap production, but it’s basically what happened on the Chinese server, so you never know. It’s entirely up to them.  Fortunately like any dystopian fascist state they need an enemy to fight, and since goons are lead by a professional class that makes their IRL living from goon media and merchandising they probably won’t jeopardize that for some kind of final victory. 
---
That's not the point. TEST have and had no plans to be aggressors and haven't spent the past 6 months planning an offensive. The frat boys have. And they've done Jack shit with whatever they were up to for the past 6 months.
---
This "war" has been a major disappointment so far. 
---
I enjoy trying to do elite pvp stuff but all that shouting at people for losing stuff is beyond me, this video to me doesn't represent how bad the corp is, it represents a corp that does stuff and knows how to have a laugh - I'd like to think my current corp is like this (Warcrows), Suddenly spaceships has a healthy aspect to them, Bloom was a lot of fun and Veni Vidi Vici all get mentions for this but the latter 2 are no more :(
---
You didn't think until the end of the post? That explains its content. 
---
Then good on them, this thread isnt aimed at them.
---
This thread is aimed at the drool-producing simpletons who take the words of their leaders as gospel truth.
---
"cheaper"
---
it's usually more expensive if you take into account the average local salaries
---
The Semiosis consoles. I buy them at 20mil a unit. I also buy stolen voting pebbels at 1 mil a unit.
---
Its amazing how far we've come from feeding linemembers some koolaid to the main FC's downing it too.

&gt;Goons probably aren’t dumb enough to kill the game by actually wiping out all hostile supercap production,

I quote Mittani here : "We are going to make every Casino War participant pay for what they did"
---
Since almost all eve join MBC during the last war, you can consider eve dead already (why no one came in delve to finish the job after, the retreat in delve and IWI/EVE-Bet were shutdown ? huuuuh so weird
---
The only thing you should be doing in Perimeter is blowing up TEST structures and ships.
---
A woman known for her large breasts?
---
There are thousands of players that get their joy in eve out of mindlessly grinding isk for weeks and pressing f1 as linemember #57382 in 250 men fleets. 
---
Judging by that i fear its a yes...
---
It’s how they enjoy the game man. Just let them do them. Shoot them if you want. Or don’t. It’s eve fuck off trying to tell people how to play. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zSR7o5mMlEE
---
and that they needed to stop.. but us, living in the affected areas.. i mean, if they had any doubts, they could just ask us to fax in a drivers license or something, i mean if they suspected foul play.
---
Russian player base get about 50% discount on eve online, how do they check if thats not exploited? properly you have to pay with a local credit card or something

Are you even trying?

3month subsription was 60 now it is 203,95 which it does not make any sense to buy it anymore. I mean you can do a LOT herewoth 203,95..
---
I tried a vpn to Russia. You get google ads for vodka and Ukrainian brides.
---
Then Russians should pay more. People are looking at this wrong it's not why are some places paying less. It's why am I being over charged?
---
The point I was trying to make is that 'triage ships' isn't really an improvement over 'logistics ships'. Imagine you smash broadcast for armor and the logistics wing goes "Yup. You're in structure and about to die. Next!".
---
You're history books are outdated sir! 
---
The magic world are "Mittani, Casino War, MBC and IWI" with this in any context, you get insta downvote and gather a lot of salt, I love how stupid reddit is
---
its how big titans should be in relation to current faxes
---
You have to be really brave to trust the broken eve app to buy plex.
---
Approved. Now just make sure to keep the number of rules in your corp at ten or lower
---
Frat invasion of Esoteria definitely isn’t going so well considering how long it has been planned.
---
What plans does Test need to have, It's WC that has low number in every TZ, Less cap Less Super, Their leadership and FC team are not component enough to copy what Init did in Cloud Ring against NC a years ago, they are just a group that not risk averse(in another words like to feed) like most other 00 groups. If anytime Test decide fun time is over then be it, Don't fool yourself to think WC is capable of breaking even Test(let alone legacy).
---
Because money in a different economy does not have the same purchasing power.
---
You're being charged more in line with your money's relative worth.
---
good shit ccp
---
Guess its a good thing we have standing boosters now for a quick recovery.
---
But yeah, i can easily see people doing this, especially in the beginning when a lot of people start increasing demand and tag prices jump up. If its lucrative enough, might be multiple people doing the same thing.
---
Only time will tell. Either way, its a solid change that the community has asked for since ive been playing back in 2011.
---
As far as the lore reasons so, is it not because the empires are so big they rather mass-produce cheaper ships than spend more than double or triple the money on the pirate ships (in the spirit of the initial release of pirate ships, and not the current overfarmed state)? They use the Zapp Brannigan technique of sending wave after wave of their own men at them.
---
Also surely something something purity of their racial technology and "grrrrr other empires!!"?
---
You sure you replied to the right person? 
---
Hi guys! Glad to see you again!
---
A) good stuff
---
B) wtf is that horrible BR tool
---
Great compare. Gj 
---
you worry about yourself? most of the affected countries have very low salary, and if these people quit, it wont help you either.
---
we didnt get a big discount.. maybe about 30 percent compared to the USA, but our salary is 1/6
---
It's really the only reliable BR tool right now. It's ugly but works well.
---
Yeah this is the new bling bomber dream
---
Yeah I definitely think its a great change, even for the second and third order of effects (more dudes in lowsec full-clearing L4s, and potentially cheaper faction modules)
---
I approve of this message.
---
Apparently it went through, just got the emailed receipt! I'm rather surprised.
---
I assume if you set those words out in a well reasoned, factually accurate, non-antagonistic manner, people would engage with you positively.
---
Sadly that seems beyond you.
---
Look like structure bashing.
---
I like this article. Now you need to hope that Rise reads it.
---
Ok I will put it this way, If you think WC spent the last 6 months thinking about plans to invade let's just say Tenerifis, You are wrong. 
---
Ah yes the good old time of Gm's showing up ingame and creating unique content. 
---
http://br.inyour.space has been pretty reliable so far.
---
Business is business - if you can serve smaller population of customers that give you similar income it "is" fine.  
---
About the same number of pilots on both sides. Nice. 
---
On large fights it doesn't come close to accurate anymore for some reason.
---
Welping 18 dreads in IAS didn't help you much :/
---
OK? Then what region did they plan to invade? 
---
The worst officer should be better or different than X-Type.       
---
Even keeping current stats on officer mods - but enabling them to be overheated for a very long time before burning out could be interesting trade off. 
---
Unfortunately br.inyour.space seems to be having trouble.
---
I’m absolutely not insinuating you may not be proficient at what you are doing. I guess my point (and probable frustration) would have to do with me “skilling up” 3 characters for 12 years now to achieve, not just the skills, but also the experience to play proficiently in all aspects in Eve only to see a very young (in game tine) pop into ships that took me years to earn.
---
Yeah we wish we had the homepage motd back but since the API changes it's not possible anymore. It was ez and great. Now we work with discord pings and have an "announced fleets" channel where you can read all the dates. 
---
in soviet russia, ccp wins eve for you
---
All they have been doing is to gearing up for defending the Invasion from the Russians if that's not obvious enough for you, But ofc the legacy narrative will be a bit different.

Why do almost all eve videos keep zoomed out so it looks like the battle of the dots? It kinda sucks, like I get why you zoom out game wise, but if you wanna make a video why not zoom in every now and then just to show the actual action. 
---
Maybe it's just me looking at it from a perspective of trying to sell someone who hasnt ever played on the game. 
---
You mean sov warfare actually being not cancer ?
---
Lol pretty much everyone on the list has been punished by now, "pay for what they did" != "disbanded"
---
Not that I disagree, but have you seen Fast and Furious? The street racers always outrun the police. That's the explanation for pirate ships being OP compared to Navy. There's little to no regulation. 
---
but did you get the plex?
---
what are the chances its like a keepstar?
---
imagine combining  eliteness + meme hell, help.
---
Because you need a wide view of the battle, there is a lot of information you can't gather by just looking your spaceship, it's like asking to a mythical raider in WoW to zoom in on his character while fighting Jaina in mythic mode 
---
Happened the same with brazilian region and i kinda stopped playing. Was ok for me paying even when I was not playing, worth the skills, now I just don't lmay anymore.
---
Who said Capital are too overpowered and CCP should give us the tool to fight the blob ? A good old Cyno Innib, few logi, few dps (even a 2 guns bhaal) is enough to take down those mother ship, good fight Slyce, sadly your super land a bit too late :)
---
While understandable (also i enjoyed visualizing grimdark EVE Factions being led by Zapp Brannigan), on the flip side of that. If the factions are super protective of their racial purity, you'd think it would be an embarrassment for their "purity" to be outdone by pirates just reverse engineering their ships and them sitting idly-by as the Rattlesnake, nearly a spitting image of the Navy Scorpion, utterly destroys it in comparison.
---
Also (and this may be stretching lore a bit) isnt most of the expense in pirate ships caused by their unique bonuses, which arent in Navy Ships. So they arent necessarily adding cost by tweaking their existing ships to be competitive since they arent having to add all the fancy things that pirate ships have.
---
not really... they were 54 against CFC (12 before Co2 left)  there is a lot of name doing pretty well like Panfam members, I really think when Goons going to shutdown Panfam Nullsec will be the saddest part of eve, who else could beat goons ? All in all no one is taking the lead "let's all band together again and fight goons" and no one is willing to copy Delve (rorq/super isk making)
---
Wipe hype  Wipe hype Wipe hype Wipe hype Wipe hype  Wipe hype Wipe hype Wipe hype 
---
Come back when you have something we can actually see.
---
Yes
---
Buy Plex, load it into a shuttle and get ganked at undock by someone that's definitely not you. Now you laundered your isk with 50% tax. 
---
Until CCP introduces "The Rock" into the navy factions. Then itll be madness. /s
---
I get why you have to be zoomed out, and I'm not saying keep zoomed in, but there are moments where you can zoom just to show off a bit of action, than zoom back out. 
---
Reminds me of old tengu uninstallation service videos. Or w/e they were called
---
Having been a CEO in a nullbloc for two years before seeing the light of Bob, I can safely say that the main thing that is going to kill groups is their desire to be and play like goons. 
---
This is just classic suspension of reality we do it when we watch movies and play videogames no harm in people playing a game. 
---
War of survival is just a cool story that allows them to want to play more, many players in eve want to feel like they are part of the larger story of eve, even if in a tiny way. People still talk about being at Asakai or B-R with great pride when we all know those were the most boring and tedious fights ever. Let people play the game they want to play it and get off your high horse. 
---
Unpopular opinion: Entosis warfare is the best fight mechanic since POSes
---
As various scandals proved it was far too open to abuse
---
So my money's worth less gotcha.
---
How do you think inputs are broadcast to the other clients? Do you believe he has 10 different computers set up and transmit it through an elaborate system of interlocking machines? Or do you perhaps he uses some sort of software?
---
How do you believe that software works, do you believe it reads his mind to determine what should be broadcasted where and how, or do you believe that there's something that's been setup. 
---
Do believe there may be names for such a thing.

Wormhole sleepers does not give security status 
---
I wonder what faction Zapp would belong to, I could maybe see him as Gallente I guess.
---
Canonically, aren't pirate (battle)ships supposed to be really really rare and only seen in DED 6/10s or higher? As in, it was never intended for capsuleers to have so many of them, making them normally a very novel thing to see in empire space to begin with? So much so that most of the top brass of the navies don't even really know about them?
---
unpopular opinion: I like sov warfare: You can actually do some tactics instead of just pressing f1 on a structure.  
---
The biggest problem I have  is the duration of a full ADM system lower that and the mechanic itself is actually good.
---
I'm currently winning EVE, but I'd normally love to be a drool-producing simpleton who takes the words of my leader as gospel truth. The reason is, unlike in real life, being a simpleton doesn't have consequences other than few pixels being blown up, which itself generates yet another story.
---
CCP staff wages and the server costs etc are the same no matter where people play from.
---
ccp should set a price, and its down to the customer to pay it. make it fair. fair is, a set price same for all. 
---
So much this.
---
How is it hurting anyone if we want to think we're a small part of some space opera.
---
lol. If this is true then I stand by my point even more. Supposedly the frat boys were trying to mobilize for war and gather up as many allies as they could to help make that happen. So if they came out of that with a new enemy that they have to defend against then that's a pretty cataclysmic failure of diplomacy. 
---
It's the "P-Funk Mothership" 
---
Since the changes with RR on entosis ship and the reduction of alpha damage on combat ceptors. Also if I'm correct, it was a fight to reinforce an ihub, so it wasn't about capturing all the command nodes. Because that can turn into a cancer for hours. Not that it's a bad system but hey.
---
Also no more entosis for station thanks god that was god awful like a full ADM system if I remember correctly.
---
Point taken and, I actually like a good chunk of this idea. 
---
I’m just trying to look at how the big sov alliances could/would take advantage of this to the detriment of the smaller folk out there.
---
Nah. not weird at all.  
---
Weird you would think its weird actually.
---
100% truth
---
It's a lot longer when you use FAX to entosis for a reason. 
---
I've always thought that each iteration of sov warfare has been better than the last... People that hate the current stuff are looking back with rose-tinted glasses.
---
I would have loved to see the political landscape of Eve 10 years ago play out with current ships and mechanics
---
If I wanted to look at the sun, I'd go outside.
---
Literally no one. 
---
WinterCo/Frat never said they plan on invading anyone at the end of  the NIP.
---
One could argue that good server performance would be if 0% TiDi
---
the Nestor is huge in supporting and enabling some doctrines to work.  You can save vital parts of the fleet with the dankest of reps carry ressuplies and reffit parts of you fleet giving FCs huge amounts of versatility its tanky as hell fits pretty much anything and is shaped like a "Magnum dong" what more do you need
---
This corp has maybe the best corp bio in all game. Mostly because its the only corp I know with quote from one of my toons.
---
If I had enough eve gaming time to live in wormhole I’d apply heh. Great propaganda. Great quotes. I bet even greater memes.
---
i think its less of believing, and more of hoping.
---
EVE players like conflict, it creates content and interest.  and a war for survival theme has been shown to create nice content.
---
with the current state of EVE...aka little change in terms of the big 3. people want content delivered to them, and a war for survival sounds like that.
---
Have you ever heard of the Big Mac Index?
---
It's literally the perfect example of why your idea is stupid. Things cost different amounts on different countries.
---

---
FAX cycle time is longer not the node timer itself
---
he's saying reduce the timer for ADM 6 systems
---
Definitely Gallente. The domi even kind of looks like his ship from the show (The Nimbus? Its been too long, i need to rewatch it)
---
Thats a good point, but after 17 years or so of capsuleers raiding and pillaging pirate stock, and the empires already becoming wary of capsuleer strength, youd think they'd start seeing these things more and be concerned about being behind the ball from a combat perspective.
---
Or better, did you have to pay?
---
just stop no
---
All in all these look promising! 
---
The warm up time makes it significantly longer. 
---
Not sure why we would reduce the timer for ADM 6 systems - the whole point is to require either winning a long, drawn-out battle over the timer or whittling down ADM. It's the highest ADM; it's supposed to take an eternity because, ideally, you reduce the ADM before toasting it. 
---
Dont forget free skillbooks, monthly prices for top pvpers, safe krabbing, eu/au/us/all timezones, best fcs, no mandatory ops, etc. 
---
With my personal favorite: Black ops bolded in corp ad with 0 actual members in corp with any battleship V or black ops skillbook injected :(
---
jk don't take my meme seriously! : )
---
Yeah I wholefully agree with the pirate and navy being on a similar level
---
Please don't mention chat changes again... It might make all of the legacy code explode...
---
I mean Raitaru are the cheapest stations, can buy one for like 550-600m last I checked.
---
But, I thought you said i was Rise? From this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b5azea/outcasts_backlog_boogaloo_solo_pvp_compilation/
---
What if its just a test for community approval?
---
This is probably the most satisfying patch note of any game I've played I've ever read. A bit sad nothing neither from CSM or community was listened about titan HAW tracking and ewar fighter but otherwise it's perfect. I don't remember another nerf coming to anomalies respawn was on the SiSi patch note, but it's good to see it's a slow continued process.
---
Was there a warning about this at some time, or did CCP just wake up in the morning and do a Shkreli?
---
I mean, this is one of those deals that seems as though it'll have a brisk impact on the Eve economy as a whole, and I'm also curious as to whether it's a global thing or just regionally cherry-picked.
---
I don't actually wish, because the joy in watching you explode on the internet will be so short lived, and then I will lose the ability to: 
---
1. Farm your Mar5meca alt army in game;
---
2. Farm your salt on r/eve and the eve-o forums in the future. 
---
My advise to you, Mar5meca, is to stop input broadcasting. Maybe just actually recruit people who can put up with you to pilot your bots... I mean your scouts. 
---
I mean seriously, you *have* already been definitively caught input broadcasting. The only reason you did not receive the ban hammer when that happened was that CCP could not prove you were using input broadcasting 'illegally.'

That was the implied joke :P

I would ho early welcome this

Just use another ship to warm up the capture timer before fax starts toasting.
---
AFAIK C4 sites are the most god awful site of all WH to run. You can perfectly live out of an astra and a raitaru.

Oof so true, it’s like half the pvp corps ingame pretend they do blops drops on the regular
---
These donations were meant for a lowsec gate
---
you don't run warm up cycle with a fax
---
I love this. People, it is no one else's problem that your exchange rates suck ass. CCP isnt your government and it's not realistic is any way to expect them to subsidize your video game recreation.
---
Just in case you don't know about it, but f.lux has significantly improved my quality of life.
---
We would prefer something with a C5 static but we are a small Corp, is it worth the logistics cost?
---
On the other hand, POSes would shoot the shit out of you even unmanned, so if you accidentally warped your scout to one uncloaked, or if your fleet was not large enough/prepared enough, the guns from a death star would kill you even when nobody was around to man those guns. 
---
Practically speaking though, you are right that there is a lot wrong with the sovereignty and structure mechanics--and I would not even know where to begin trying to solution them. 
---
I only commented the way I did because in the skill injector titan spam era that is #EVE2019, I am not sure actually limiting the number of structures that can be put up in a system balances anything. There would need to be a lot of other changes necessary to not accidentally tip the balance just as far in favor of attackers as it currently is in the favor of defenders in dyson sphered systems like 1DQ. 
---
Even running a handful of c5 sites a week will pay for almost everything you need. 
---
&gt;500plex
---
&gt;usd 19.99 
---
   
---
wha... why thats 5$ more than a monthly sub for a monthly sub 
---
I would probably not live in WH space it meant living out of a POS compared to living out of a citadel. And C5 static are good but probably a bit crowded.
---
Pretty typical. Premium price because you can sell it for isk.
---
I'll let you know in about 3 hours
---
&gt; your fantasy utopian system which will never happen
---
My 'system' is neither fantasy or utopian than yours. The idea that capitalism is sustainable, or in any way the end of socioeconomic history, is more fantasy and utopian than the notion that the organization of how the products of social labor are produced and distributed can *and will* change, and that a system whereby the planet and the people who live on it are not commodities to be traded, used, and exploited for the private profit of the few is possible.  
---
None, the new Russian coalition announced a month ago that they were going to invade and evict WinterCo from detorid.
---
Also, Rule 6 must be "There is *no* Rule 6."
---
If you are talking like corp staging - contracts 100%.

If you are talking just random lowsec system - seeded.

You’re an IDIOT and don’t know what you’re talking about. This is day one of “The Bot War”. TEST has declared war on FRT.

"hey, ccp finance guy 1, people in this poor country cant afford our game. should we make it cheaper in that country so we get at least *some* money instead of none?"
---
"no, finance guy 2, turning customers away is good actually, our wages dont change after all"
---
"what? dude, we can pay your entire wage with the money we'd make from that country, you just wanna tell them to fuck off and make nothing instead?"
---
"yup lol"
---
~~You say that, but Vince Draken has an unmarked van that follows me around, whether I'm at the office, the girlfriend's, or buying toothpaste. Inside is a rig with a 4 monitor setup, and two burly men named Vladimir and Mischa. If I don't log in for CTA's or emergency pings when spammed, or if I make a mistake that costs us a battle these men are under orders to immediately revoke my life licence.
---
So in a way, NC's fight is literally my fight for survival.~~
---
Lol yeah, people need to chill tf out 
---
*Chuckles nervously*
---
Holy shit, how mindless do you have to think that role players actually believe the things they are acting out? 
---
Imagine yourself putting this kind of officer module on a T3 cruiser.    
---
To extend the overheating for like 15minutes - yes it is insane ... but this is officer module .... SO WHY NOT.       
---
I want people putting those Officer modules on T3 ... imagine yourself whole rack of officer modules and what you can achieve!          
---
I think it can be actually a pretty easy change as you need to increase the structure ehp points of a module?            
---
Or make x types worse so caps die faster.

Or figure out how to plex this hobby
---
It's also been missing kills left and right
---
jumping gates the server was still shit.
---
Amazing article, hope it can come true!
---
god I forgot this was a thing...I hate sov wanding
---
&gt;hips supposed to be really really rare and only seen in DED 6/10s or higher? As in, it was never intended for capsuleers to have so many of them, making them normally a very novel thing to see in empire space to begin with? So much so that most of the top brass of the navies don't even really know about them?  
---
&gt;Edit: Built like a steakhouse though
---
Maybe, but I sure as fuck see them in every haven I run, and every belt I fly into. 
---
I got less of a vision of F&amp;F and more of Somali rowboats running away from a US navy destroyer, so I always thought the disparity was strange.
---
And speaking of destroyers (..and apologies if this is a tired question), why aren't there navy issues?
---
The faction weapon changes will make faction warfare tags more valuable!

Nice fucking work CCP, doing this few month after adding those boosters.

&gt;Adjustments have been made to the respawn rates of certain nullsec anomalies. These adjustments are part of a gradual ongoing process that will see further tweaks for this type of content.

Oh boy

Just yell at your gunnery crews louder, problem solved
---
monthly is more expensive no?
---
Because OP isn't the one subbing from this, whoever buys it from him with ISK is.
---
Fixed. Please don't ticket me 
---
It's kind of a weird situation.
---
For frigates and cruisers, they are a lot cheaper than the pirate faction ones (except Ashimmu, that one is way overfarmed for it's usage).
---
While for battleships, they're generally on the same price range, with 1 or 2 dipping depending on what faction is farmed in FW at the time.
---
r/softwaregore 
---
Can we get a copy pasta for those of us at work? 
---
lol
---
That's the not being accurate part.
---
c4 sites are the worst to run, you are better off running c3s or c5s. You can anchor astras unless you want to be super cheap and use raits. living out of a pos isnt fun and they are supposed to be removing them this year (soon™) anyway.
---
&gt; nothing was listened to
---
As is expected from CCP. We elect an entire council of fellow retards only for them to receive special ignoring treatment. 
---
Is it worth resubbing? I last played when Goons lost VFK. Would my stuff still exist? My characters?
---
Honestly, the navy versions of faction ships should all have bonuses that make them 'as good' as the pirate faction ones--at least from the point of view of world building in a sensical way.  **IF** this were a concern of CCPs, I would just have designed the pirate ships to fill different niches with suitably divergent bonuses. 
---
And at the end of the day, in addition to pirate faction capital ships, there should also be navy faction capital ships. Because, for example, it makes absolutely no sense that a real navy with the economic and scientific resources at their disposal, would not have at least a few Titans, Supers, or Dreads that were *at least* as good as the ones that could be fielded by fringe outlaw organizations. 
---
Like legit, the way eve is designed, pirate Titans (as an example) would be the equivalent of Somali pirates launching and manning a nuclear powered aircraft carrier that outclassed the USNs Gerald R. Ford class carriers in every conceivable way. 
---
I wish I could say same, but I'm just a failure without successes outside of D&amp;D.

what's this "outside" you're talking about?
---
This is the first time ISD beat Intigo on posting these. /u/verybadateve where the hell are you?
---
If you want to do a solo C3 I'd suggest using a Praxis or Rattlesnake, it'll be more or less equal to or faster than 2 Loki.
---
Lmao
---
You literally don’t fucking understand how this works, do you.   
---
 Basic Econ 101 folks.  
---
Fundamentally, *things should not* cost different amounts in different countries.  That’s what currency exchange rates mean.  1 unit of this currency is worth X units of another currency.  Establishing that, essentially, $15 worth of whatever currency will buy you the same things no matter where you are.
---
In practice, things *do* cost different amounts.  This is due to supply and labor differences in the target market.  *This* is what the Big Mac index tracks, which is the price of Big Macs globally and how they differ.  Which is a measure of how skewed the exchange rate between two countries might be.
---
For a product like EVE, CCP was essentially undercutting themselves.  With a $3/month vpn I could lose $7 off my eve subscription or a whole lot more off plex purchases.   They are probably making more money from the people that are no longer undercutting them and the people in that country that are still paying at the increased rate.  They made a solid business decision, IMO.
---
If I were CCP, I would have left subscription prices at the same reduced rate per nationality, but just flattened out PLEX prices.
---
memes need to fit to be funny, you can't just put any meme anywhere without fitting the context and expect people to think it's funny.
---
I find it funny how when two organizations team up against a common enemy how it is automatically assumed one side was paid to join. Is it really that unbelievable that the common enemy in this case was just so unsavory that both sides agreed it was logical to team up? I guess it doesn't matter. You will believe what you will. 
---
Thanks my guy!
---
HTFU.
---
Wait, thats a thing? Seems like an oversight by CCP.
---

---
dont be too sure about that, might see some on deimos fits. tends to be hard to fit a strong tank and neutrons. never tried the fitting on faction weapons tbh so no clue if it works.
---
wish they would just say what the changes were rather than us having to figure it out.
---
his reddit/devblog bot broken, hes been up for ages trying to fix it
---
You'll be left with a citation, Sir. 
---
how dare people roleplay in a massively multiplayer online role playing game!!!
---
I tend to use my alt to run t3 gamma's in a passive Gila while I run t4s. The loot is worse but the occasional 400 mil skill book is nice
---
put your bigboy pants on and do some live testing on your own
---
Except that this is how it works right now: Russians pay less in dollar equivalent for subscriptions only, while PLEX are sold at full price. 
---
when's the monument in rage that was promised in feb coming
---
It is not that major. Not much will change. In my opinion, nothing will change.  Rorquals will still be OP and major empires can use it comfortably as it still has 6 min PANIC and no drawbacks in lighting a CYNO. Excavatos volume might increase their loss rate and make them more expensive. FAX change is only visible in large engagements. Ferox will still be the king of t1 bc and preferred fleet ship. Harbinger might be a good second choice but still far. CNI with drones lol. VNI and GILA nerf good but it will only change some stuff in certain situations. Corax pg buff is not bad. HAW Titans will still be used because in combination with the appeal of bosoning a fleet off field they will still be the primary choice to counter fleets in home ground. Fighters is good change but not enough. 
---
&gt;Is it worth resubbing?
---
That's on you to figure out. Hop on and try the game again as an alpha clone, you can still do a fair amount. Play for a bit and get back into things.
---
&gt;Would all my stuff still exist? My characters?
---
Your characters will always stick around unless you biomass them yourself. Your stuff is almost certainly still around, though some of it may be stuck in [asset safety](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289365-Asset-Safety) if it was in citadels that have since gone boom.
---
erm...when you use 4 faxes to entose....no fun at all
---
199 crucifiers lost that battle.
---
TNX CCP for Cyno Inhibitor Balance.
---
Mmm, that abaddon damage buff 
---
Rip super ratters 
---
Don't make me call Inter Hell ;)
---
You've entirely missed earning power within your model which is exactly WHY a computer programmer in San Francisco gets paid a different amount, even after exchange rates, than one in India.
---
Yes you're right that exchange rates should perfectly reflect equivalence but they don't. The big Mac index shows WHY products should cost different amounts. Local fluctuations in supply and demand make it a necessity. It's why we have imports and exports.
---
Still takes a fax 10 minutes to cycle a t2 entosis on a fax, right? It's still a long commitment to keep a fax on grid. 
---
There's plenty of ways to counter a toasting fax with subs, particularly neuting ships, or contest other nodes, or counter toast same node to neutralize it. 
---
If they have fax every node and you can't break one or force it off somehow, I have bad news for you... Your group is fighting the wrong enemy. Shitty for you if you're the defender.
---
It's the place that delivery food comes from that makes your eyes feel like they're burning. 
---
it would affect it, but not be a major issue, we'd resort to ball formations, with faxes in the middle, and supers and titans outside.
---
- pay someone:
---
https://www.pushx.net/
---
https://red-frog.org/
---
- if it's a small cargo, use any interceptor/ship with a sub 2 second align time (needs to be lower than two seconds, makes it EXTREMELY difficult to lock the ship, can only be locked by very well fitted + lucky snipers). Be aware these type of fits will usually die to smartbomb camps unless they are tanked and lucky.
---
- If its big but not huge cargo, deep space transports are good if you can fly them.
---
:'(
---
with most things in life each country can buy say, a car for a more localized price due to the vehicle being made in that country, with those wages.
---
with eve online, its costs are permanent, they dont change. either lower 1st world countrys sub price to match those affordable in other regions, or raise the other regions to match those of the 1st world.
---
unless you would like to introduce salary to sub price formulas. what about the dude in the 1st world who is on benefits, why should he have to pay such a large such compared to his income/spending money to be able to continue playing etc etc
---
Insurance change for Caps has been removed it seems?
---
C2/C5 would give you logistics via the C2 and crab via the C5. All you need to run C5 sites is two rattles but you just won’t be able to do the drifter boss.

constantly watching the probe window to see when it respawns for several hours to get all the times isn't my idea of fun.  I'd much rather do entosis ops then that.
---
Pretty safe. Check zkillboard for kills involving an interdictor on your route. I just scout all my cloaky haulers with a far less expensive covert ops prober.
---
dont worry, someone else is and will publish the results.
---
Ty for lunchtime content
---
given they post other values, I fail to see why they can't post those.
---
considering the only other fight mechanics have been rorquals and citadels
---
i mean yeah i guess
---
It is already implemented
---
But the point of the big mac index is that you aren't actually buying the same thing... you're buying different things of identical utility. That's why it's a (marginally) useful tool of comparison.  
---
The cost of a big mac varies world wide because the cost to produce and serve you one varies... not just because the market can't pay more.
---
Probably busy laying down the law in #newbie-help
---
because having to hold a grid for an hour just to create a timer is fucking stupid
---
the long nodes are sufficient reward for krabbing real good, you should be able to respond to a ref notification in 30 minutes 
---
T2 Ammo requires T2 skills. 
---
So they won't be able to. 
---
(They can use faction guns)
---
Already is.
---
it needs the t2 weapon skills.
---
ahahaha oh man how wrong you are
---
They have that weird shtick, when they just don't post some (most often pve related changes).
---
Like they buffed burner npcs a while ago, and didn't tell anyone, and ppl just went in and died.
---
Or most recently they implemented capital insurance changes, but didn't put them in patch notes (although it was advertised through devblog the other week).
---
props to legacy for bringing it earlier this morning, even if it didnt go our way. Been a while since we've had a good autz fight with a stable server
---
This reminded me of those fake as hell home-buying shows.  
---
"This is PsiShock101 and his wife DragonsAfterDark, and they are looking for a new home. He's a disabled Veteran who manufactures small hybrid ammo, and she's a hisec Homeless Drone collector. Their budget is 1 Trillion Isk!"
---
Mothership usually means super carrier not shitfit ratting Thanatos. And equally, 2 Nestors better be enough reps to deal with a single carrier worth of DPS for long enough to kill it with that much on grid.
---
95% of all officer mods are garbage so it would be nice if ccp redid them
---
market pvp is my activity of choice
---
What about the rigs which can cost billions?
---
I ticked the 'Show Trash' box in that battle report and it removed everybody except TEST Alliance from the report. I think this is the most accurate battle report tool available.

---
untill its fixed, im out.
---
Lol
---
That really looks like all of eve vs tapi
---
&gt; It is not that major
---
Yeah I mean unless you're expecting CCP to remove capitals from the game, I don't know what you want. There is sure room for changes (boson / HAW) but so far it's a really solid and deserved patch that got it coming. Those are things almost everyone agrees upon. Rorquals will die and more easily. NSA will give us a little more opportunity to catch carriers and supers or get them to sacrifice some midslots. Subcaps have been receiving consistant balance patches since a year+ and probably haven't been in such a state. The iterative process CCP is on is really healthy for that regards. Sure most of your point makes sense but I rather have this than nothing. Because if you recall a bit, we've been whining all of this for over 2 years now. You can't expect the best balance patches of all time, you really should feel happy that it's a very good step on the right direction. And for having seen somewhat community orientated, sandboxy games I loved taking very big state in the very wrong direction this is god send.
---
You can't expect things like cyno to be removed from the game. There isn't a consensus at all on what changes would have to be brought. Same with FAXes. For what they could do without enraging a non negligible part of the community or fucking up the game this patch is 90% hit, 5% forward in not the ideal way and 5% miss.
---
the bhaal had aweful fit, only the vid was a real dps tbh, and I almost lost one of the nestor on this fight with rats+carrier damage were hitting pretty hard
---
Might be just some after order event that failed, like log action for example. Happens quite often in my apps :/ 
---
They didn't reduce combat ceptor alpha: the RR change basically made fozzie claws not work. I still do not understand why people were so salty about combat ceptor nullification when they provably were not effective for winning sov contests just for picking off stragglers (which to me sounds like a perfect role for combat interceptors), maybe they just disliked the idea of having to pay attention in fleets and align? 
---
You are grasping wildly at straws my dude 
---
Because they don't want the fucking krabs REEing at the values and I personally would rather them keeping that way.
---
Need someone to cut all these videos into a single frame so we can see the full picture instead of the single slices!

There's going to be still a total of zero caracal navies out after adding drones.
---
...hey, gotta find something to complain about. overall good changes
---
So far somebody did it every week, I expect nothing less today. 
---
Will update my post once I can get hold of the link to an updated montage.
---
Has there been any talk about updating the in game corporation finder tool? I want to find corp from my small country and the language is not available in the filter. I wont/cant play before i find corp and i absolutely want it to be my own language.
---
Why would you use a fax to entosis? wouldn't a max bricked abaddon or legion be better since you can just sit the fax next to it to rep the 300-400k ehp ship doing the actual entosis without the penalty.
---
so the new argument is its rp?
---
This is genuinely news to me
---
can you cancel your reddit account too 
---
ya well a few times they seemed to drop and lose the crystals.
---
can't a dude be outside earlier without being SHAMED for it :[
---
What i really want is some of the consoles, been running tons of t5s but still havent gotten the jackpot
---
Marza superiority. 
---
i dont think you've ever gone outside mate
---
i'm seeing myself with a shorter and shorter free time to play eve, but weirdly enough i start to enjoy solo roaming a lot more.
---
I wonder how many jumps that goon fleet made to get there to 3rd party on the fight (well, they weren't invited, but most definitely seemed to fight for one side).
---
I have trouble switching ammo when there's only one other guy in local so that's nothing new
---
Sadly f.lux only turns my screen orange, which hurts my eyes more.
---
too busy doing monuments for signal cartel members
---
No one noticed you was AFK other than your own ego sunshine xxxxx
---
I already do this ;P
---
Personally I keep one alt cloaked 10-15km off where I run T5 Abyssals in null in a Griffin with Max jamming suicide set up lol... Gives me eyes on my exit that I can watch and if someone tries to catch my 4-5bill abyssal farmer I can go crazy with the ecm and get the Gila off grid for a 50m Griffin loss
---
As far as what to do with alt to make isk if your not worried about getting caught, I only do semi afk things with alts like mining or industry while I'm running Abyssals.  But T5s demand most of your attention so kind of depends on how easy mode the Abyssals your running are.  I tried super ratting and running Abyssals and....it wasn't a good idea lol but rorq mining... Sure.
---
wat? im just saying how dare people roleplay in a roleplaying game.
---
Some unexpected love for the lowly Corax. Nice
---
oh you are right, found it in the 2019-03-20.1 notes \\o/
---
Style points, you cut off where it shows Mastery 5.
---
Also, taking a picture with your phone of your computer screen sucks.
---
If youre on windows, use the snipping tool in your start menu to take a screenshot and upload that.
---
Watching the exit for campers would probably be a good idea. Save you a 2bil gila gank.
---
Screenshot mastery is bellow 1 tho.
---
You are saying that disillusioned people are roleplaying.
---
I am saying this is news to me
---
im saying stop overthinking it
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
What monster only buys 500 plexi? At least buy 1100 so you can tell yourself you love you.
---
It was added to WH but made destroyable as WH people like that type of stuff, lasted all of 2 min
---
Got other habits to feed with my plasma donation money
---
w8 where has the gila meta been?
---
if you mean pvp. i think the current meta is eagles.  gila was like early 2018
---
if you mean pve.  really no change.
---
Does the mastery ranks still have stupid suit in them that has zero impact on the ship ?
---
Looks like the South vs FRT.
---
Than again it doesn’t surprises me TEST been a Goon Pet and all.
---
What even is Prt Scrn?
---
This hasnt required much thought at all though.
---
I would be willing to sell you some of my extras, only have an extra of perun right now. but will likely get some more this weekend.
---
Feed them well?
---
Unpopular opinion: Entosis warfare is just FW mechanics without gated plexes and an additional annoying module.  Since you don't have gates there isn't a unique micro-meta for each class of complex.
---
Halving of hp. No change to damage it would appear...yet.
---
Always upvote Stitch’s posts. It mitigates for all the times I used to blog him.
---
Indeed.... lots of brass
---
Yeah I got flux a couple years ago but the damage was done 
---
I think op was referring to meta for events and abyssals. 
---
Praise Bob!
---
Supers don't change in PvE, you allrdy got to applicationcap with one Trackingcomputer.
---
This is for PvP to lessen the strain on light and medium ships.
---
mfw there are more FC yelling on Frat comms then TEST comms   
---
is PGL on medication or something ?
---
The same happened here for me in South Korea. Got a email today saying the price for omega increased by A TON.
---
First corp i ever was in, in 2011, people got yelled at for losing crap. Crap they bought for themselves, be it for fun, or to actually experiment/learn.  
---
was seriously unfun.
---
I don't think this is what OP was suggesting but I want this too, would make awesome cinematics in frig 1v1s and brawls
---
You should try to fight without massive blob one time
---
No, the drones still have stupidly short shield recharge time
---
Lucia said that's something to do with Squizz, and not her; something about him limiting out side data pulls or what ever
---
&gt;Fixed a rare case where Upwell Structures would not drop loot when unanchored or destroyed.
---
It's called fucking asset safety and it's by far rare. Glad to see this oversight fixed 
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah well it would be a step of from frat!
---
hopefully...
---
Hmm
---
its like doing PI on an ice planet on a 55" screen but worse.
---
Highly doubt it. That tool is so shitty even if you have a language in the filter. You might be better off searching for your country or language on the forums recruitment section.
---
Worth noting that ARC still has a bounty on consoles! Do get in touch if you have spare.
---
I do mine in my home WH and let my alt huff gas in the background while I'm running T3/T4s on my main.
---
I'd totally agree that ***contested*** Entosis warfare is great.  It challenges your coordination, ability to triage, your intel/scouting network etc. There's plenty of ways for a smaller force to win over a larger force.   
---
Uncontested entosis is pretty terrible.  CCP should add some sort of accelerator to speed things up if one side isn't doing anything. 
---

Pirates in Eve have nothing in common with actual pirates.
---
They are nations that dont stick to the rules of the big 5, largely because they are people that left the 5 empires one way or another.
---
The difference between Khanid and the Blood Raiders is a little bit of sanity and a lot of PR.
---
I did get the plex
---
Nope. They still get 500% to damage. All this means is you need to recall them a bit sooner than before.
---
dominion sov
---
15$ per 1 month omega? Yeah. For my bro in German its 1/300 of his wage. For me in Ukraine its 1/15. And, you know, my wage is pretty damn high for my region, you know.
---
There are other advantages of using FAXes.
---
But I was just replying to the guy above me. He mentioned FAXes.
---
Great article.
---
right on

did you see the BR?  The fight was even
---
morganfreeman.jpeg
---
Kamio. It does not fit with the Gallente side of what you asked but it is fairly central to anything you would want. It's 5 jumps from both Jita and Amarr, has a decent market and good industry options. It's also an Ice system next to another one if ice mining is your thing.
---
my first time seeing it. looks fine to me, whats wrong with it?
---
staying at a family member's house and trying to be polite :)
---
I wish I knew about this VPN thing ages ago. I would have bought plex that way. 
---
Can you cancel your jezabelly also?
---
I thought I remember CCP lowering the price for sub/plex in one area in an effort to combat RMT since it was profitable to play Eve compared to working. Guess that didn't last long.
---
not really. the drone hp bonus isn't what makes the gila good.
---
Well I guess if havens spawn even slower it’ll be even more inconvenienced super ratters.
---
My head canon for why pirate ships are more powerful is that pirate factions have had no limitation on access to Sleeper, Drifter, or Jovian tech that they've used to improve their ship lineups. The Sansha are already well known for pundering wormhole space, and the Angel Cartel is directly associated with their looting of abandoned Jovian structures. Other times they have certain geniuses behind their ship designs, like the Gurista's technology leader Rabbit, or they have highly guarded research divisions like the Serpentis or the SOE. 
---
It could also be down to incorporating "faction" components in the base hull design, like incorporating nonmodular faction derived shield extenders in the base hull type. I'm also a fan of u/Keffek's proposal that the incorporation of multiple empire technologies increases the power of pirate ships so considerably, and also why each pirate faction has two requisite ship lines to train. 
---
So some players realise they've been subsidized by other regions for a long time.
---
T3 dark frig sites with 2 Hawks.
---
Yeah he’s been changing the system a bunch to the detriment of external tools.
---
Not just that you can inspect weaponturrets and wich system they're using.
---
Thats really nice for PvP so you don't need to zoom into your target all the time. You often have no ship or modulescanner and need to convirn visually.
---
&gt;CCP has been getting a lot of hate
---
They deserve all of it.
---
Personally I would like Navy Ships to receive some sort of additional bonus or bonuses tied to their respective Navy or main faction standings. These would have to be finely and carefully tuned of course so that the ships are not "useless" without them so that people who do not have such standings can still fly them and be OK, but do feel overall more effective.
---
This would also make perfect sense from the way the standings work in the game as well as lore.
---
Dunno I'm ratting in Delve argueably the most populated and crowded area for capitals.
---
You have so many Systems without activity wich are still within 1dq umbrella, I don't think it will be barely an inconvinience at all. 
---
Goons did.
---
Damnation is the ship you want to use
---
Large alliance are not actually bad people, just an easy target to call out and generate reddit salt.

Everyone that plays eve is my friend, i like you all.

It's ok man, you have to live your best life. But rageroll fleets will always be more fun when you're around. (◕‿◕✿)

If there was a warning I didn't see it. I mean technically this email is the warning.

There's a simple economic way of looking at it. In poorer countries people will often just not pay more so it's a matter of helping those places to be able to pay even at a lower cost instead of not playing at all. The net result is usually an increase in revenue. In richer countries when you increase the price of something people might complain but they just pay more. In poorer places people will just stop playing.

I'm not disputing your argument but in my region at least it was only Omega. Plex bundle prices were always full price.

Market all the way.  I much prefer using multibuy and knowing I'm getting exactly what I specified rather than trying to verify the contract fit is correct and fairly priced.  Contracts can be convenient for newer players that aren't comfortable adjusting their fits yet, but for experienced players the market is much more convenient.  Sometimes you can even fit an extra damage mod or better meta mod than the doctrine fitting too, once you get stuff like AWU 5, and that won't be on contracts.

I dont understand, are they ok with him losing 7b of his own ships or are they not ok.

This is a prime example of EvE logic, direct from iceland, where brains are frozen

---
Orvolle does goes to null. But if you go through PF 346 you better be fit to fight. That system is a pipe system and is usually the most active system in syndicate for ship kills.
---
That's not true. Damage mods are strong (they became more expensive with muta introduction as people actively use them to try and do godroll), propmods are strong (fitting and cap), pds/rcus are strong, launchers are godlike, webs, smartbombs... 
---
Some other categories are weird, like invulns and ANPs where top officer mods are stronger than top deadspace, but anything below that and you're in deadspace territory. Neuts/nosfs are stronger that deadspace too and thus can provide better results with equal rolls.
---
Like, are there many categories where officer modules are not better than deadspace? 
---
&gt;no one is willing to copy Delve (rorq/super isk making)
---
Chinese and TEST have clearly started adopting that model.

You're right. Eve should be easy and mindless, and you deserve to be spoon-fed like an infant.

Each person sees EVE different. A miner will hate this patch, a pvper will hope Zealots are a bit better, a market pirate will buy multiple excavators now, you get the idea. No one is talking about removing capitals or cynos from the game, they have a huge role in it. But as someone from Goons said the day these changes were announced. " Instead of mining with 10 Rorquals, now i need 11 for the same result " And that is true. Rorquals might die may be a bit faster in certain areas but not in Delve, Esoteria, Fountain, Detorid, Tribute, where entire fleets of supers and titans are protecting them. in those areas, these changes will barely make any difference. Players who live in higher risk areas will migrate even more now into these well protected areas of the game and instead of diversity and action all over the map we will have these 4-5 hot pockets on the map where eveyone sits and waits some casual roam from the other entity so they can duck on it.The difference between cyno and the inhibition of it it's enormous at this point. And because of this capitals and supercapitals will always be the preferred choice of action for a player. Think about any module in the game, Sensor booster, tracking computer, etc, and then think about the module that balances it. Tracking distruptor, Sensor dampner, etc. All these modules are balancing each other because their attributes are roughly the same. Now think about Cyno module and Cyno inhibitor. HAW Titans don't do 3-4k dps anymore but they will still do 1.5k dps and track the same, combine this with the Boson and very litttle risk losing it and you will see that this will still be the main choice. NSA change is good but not enough. CCP should look at the core of it, resource abundance, player migrations and im talking here about wormholes, FW, NPC nullsec and all these deserted areas that could bring diversity and great fun for players but they are deserted or broken and very few venture there. There are so many issues with the current gameplay that i can only laugh when i see a balance patch like this. This is made so we can shut up for a while. But i guarantee it that in 6-12 months capitals will still be an issue, rorquals will still be an issue, and 10% optimal to beams will solve nothing. 
---
Because nobody with any power contested Horde.  
---
Jumped 8 bill across highsec in a DST, white knuckled hammering my cloak and warp, and made it to jita without being blapped

So you think all other changes should just be noted at changes and not have the values listed? How hardcore of you.

Im sorry i forgot. About the NSA drawbacks. You were talking about sacrificing some mid slots. Don't forget the shield slaves are coming. So they will be way stronger then what we see today.

Hm, I like this idea actually, will probably give it a shot. Right now I'm running T3 Darks in a Cerberus using Rapid Light Launchers as I've seen some fits online of people doing this *(main concern in Darks seems to be having good enough application on the fast moving cruisers and frigs?)*, and it's working okay but holy crap the 35 second reload time on those launchers is the biggest issue I'm having so far. Cutting it way too close on completion times.

3v3 frigate pvp soon, looks like 
---
He quit though?
---
Why not just remove them completely 
---
well lets see.  right now not many are flying strategic cruisers, at least not in mainline doctrines.  so adding risk wont really benefit the ship being used more.
---
and while it might solve the rorqual bot problem to some extent, in the end it hurts players more.  and bot users would just settle for the long train with tons of alts (its actually cheaper to train into it naturally instead of injecting. jsut more time consuming.)
---
plus, with character bazaar, bot users would just use that.
---
so no. it wouldnt really help any.  it would jsut frustrate players more. while being a minor inconvenience to botters.
---
and it would stab strategic cruisers when they already struggling to remain relevant vs HAC and Logi Cruisers.   only real use they really getting right now is wh.
---
Perhaps removing them altogether? Was a bad move in the first place.
---
It's good for stuff that isn't poverty-grade afk ratting

80 iq post
---
I havn't played for awhile, but when I was playing, there was 2 different times I prefered both. If there was any kind of group strat op, it was very nice to have disposable tackle/inty/t3c on contract that were prefitted.
---
But. If I was doing any small gang stuff, I would always part it together myself, buying from the market instead of contract. Just know your region and who's there. If it's a large alliance that runs dedicated stratops, then contract ships will likely sell better cause your average F1 monkey doesn't really care about fitting their ship as much. While if it's small gang heaven or skirmish heavy region, a seeded market will get you far more profit.

I just wished they would show up as 'smart NPCs' with possible wormholes opening and other GM's showing up and other weird stuff like that. Doesn't need to give broken/OP rewards. Just an unpredictable element to add flavor to this game... like incursions. The npcs in Eve are by far the worst. Dumb predictable and so easy to farm...
---
I'm using it right now and I didn't know about these effects.  Good to know I can turn it a gentle blue instead of blaze orange.
---
People have such distain for the wand... like shooting it with 100 people is any better.  That's just 100 wands that you have to keep cycling.
---
Technically, perhaps, but this sort of decision affects gameplay for everyone as it will certainly nudge the entire Eve economy around quite a bit, even those of us in the US that are already paying "full" price for subs, which is why I made the PharmaBro reference.   Usually CCP has some sort of social media/forum post that heralds this sort of thing but if there was I totally missed it.
---
IMO the zarmazd is not good at supporting frigates as you don't get to keep the rep online long enough to take advantage of the rep ramp. Also can't split reps which is more important with low buffer ships, when you gotta keep them all topped up. 
---
They were a thing for a few months, noone really bothered with them because they DD'd stuff when you broke their first layer of shield so you couldn't really throw shiny battleships at them like regular incursions. Also they only spawned in Amarr lowsec.
---
Afaik people used to go into them with cheap thrasher fleets to trigger the doomsdays then reship to shiny battleships after all doomsdays had been fired. I think towards the end ARC was the only group actively running them. 
---
They were ultimately removed in (I think) late 2016/early 2017 before Resource Wars.
---
I've got no problem with doing that for caps.
---
T3Cs, on the other hand, should have the skill loss removed entirely. There was a time when they were a very powerful high skill hull class, but after the recent nerf I would argue that they've been demoted far enough that the skill point loss is no longer justified. Especially for non-Loki hulls.
---
It's really nothing a person couldn't fit/skill around, but oh no the afk ratting shield VNI is dead, I might have to learn to actually work a ship....
---
The top tier offivcer mods are typically the only ones remotely worth it. I like serp officer mwds/ab for the low pwrg and great OH bonus.
---
You can fit other armor repairers, just only one has the ramp iirc 
---
It would, but it's never going to happen.
---
For one thing, it would mean micro managing how unused SP is treated. As it stands, you just load up any skills into the queue, and it applies that much in order. They don't care what's in the queue, they just dump that much SP into it. Your way, they'd have to evaluate the queue and decide which skills can have SP and which can't.
---
Plus, the whole Extractor / Injector system costs PLEX, which means someone is paying CCP cold hard cash. And they aren't going to turn down extra money. They like when people multibox. They like when people use lots and lots of Omega accounts at once. The only thing they pretend not to like is bots.

I was with you until you said entosis. 
---
Which one?
---
Ah, thanks. Sorry for the repost thread guys
---
Heh, so CCP took fucking years to publish a regular industry standard bi-monthly or quarterly balance pass. GG CCP.
---
As far as caps go, no need to remove them from the game. Just close the gap between caps / sub caps and bring dreads, carriers, supers, titans closer together not so spread while on the graph.
---
This pass only moves the gap a bit closer and only in some situations. This needs to be all encompassing on a more basic level, total EHP, total DPS and utility. Until then, everything else is just beating around the bush and making PR gestures to say "o look we're doing something".

&gt;They were a thing for a few months, noone really bothered with them
---
Wrong, Spectre Fleet ran many fleets
---
&gt;DD'd stuff when you broke their first layer of shield
---
They DD'd a single target when their overshield was removed, preceeded by a really loud, distinct sound so you knew when it was coming
---
&gt;couldn't really throw shiny battleships at them like regular incursions.
---
Kind of. We used cheap thrashers to remove the overshield and have every thrasher warp off grid. Sometimes an unlucky one got popped. Then the main fleet would come in regular TVP/WTM-fit Nightmares and finished the drifters off. Your second paragraph points this out though.
---
&gt; Also they only spawned in Amarr lowsec.
---
No, they spawned in all of "Amarr" areas.
---
&gt; I think towards the end ARC was the only group actively running them.
---
ARC never ran them, Spectre Fleet/What Drifters? did. ARC ran the drifter wormholes.
---
So what, if they pay the price for it ?

When everyone to whom its applicable goes from 10 to 11 Rorqs, that in turn puts more pressure on plex. Plex on average never comes down, it will always rise, so eventually, these people will eitehr have to shell out for those accounts out of their own pockets or  die off. True that it is a long process, but hopefully we will see some serious plex spikes along the way making it a bit shorter. And I think next spike is just around the corner, at least a small one, but could be sizable, won't know until we see it, will be when the Trig events hit TQ, a lot of people will plex or sub their PvE accounts for that.
---
So it looks like an over all HAW nerf?  Not just Titan HAW? 
---
Can't CCP come up with a more creative answer to capital balance other than "just don't let them warp". 
---
Siege Module: prevents warp
---
Triage Module: prevents warp
---
Industrial Core: prevents warp
---
Networked Sensor Array: prevents warp
---
Do Titan Doomsday's prevent warp? Because if they don't I guarantee you that will be next.
---
Seriously, stop it with the lazy balancing and put some effort into it.
---
Is it ok that I simultaneously agree with /u/Drak_is_Right and /u/Mauti404 on this issue?
---
My point was...they said it couldn't be done...it still hasn't been done.
---
Impossible because it what make money for ccp. People dont inject for sub cap generally.
---
+1 for the loss sp for t3c.... if they remove it i will fly only t3c lol.
---
Warframe, Path of Exile for starters.
---
Stop spinning, PGL. We all know you can't fight without Imperium assistance... This BR proves it!
---
You could drop down to seven accounts.
---
Just a thought.
---
Yesterday i reprocess some faction loot, so reprocess meta is very good. I sell the iffa damage control and reprocess the rest, also cheap faction. Mineral is life.
---
Of course, you are 100% correct. I guess I was just pointing out, that if you dig too deep, there is a bit of absurdity from a lore point of you one needs to suspend disbelief for pirate faction ships being universally better than navy faction ships making sense. 
---
No.
---
All HAWS do 50% less damage.
---
Siege will double HAW damage.
---
It evens out, although that meana non-sieged HAWS will be affected as well.
---
Imagine you used to do 10 damage, now you do 5 as a Titan. If you are a dread in siege your damage will go from 5 to 10.
---
I still want space whales roaming around
---
There’s a couple of strong navy ships but pretty much all of them need an overall boost of EHP, dps and in some cases pg/cpu
---
wanna laugh harder?
---
industry teams 
---
Worst pve content in the game as far is mechanics, looks beautiful  tho. 
---
that indeed is a nice tool for testing blindness
---
"Life finds a way."
---
If it isn't the VNI or Gila, bots would use another ship.  So maybe just a tad less isk?  Also, the changes probably won't change botting too much.  Still very practical to bot using a VNI or Gila.  
---
Why even expire them... Just let the market use it up... 
---
nerf to rorqs, nerf to carrier ratting, nerf to super ratting + the anom changes that were just done.  
---
Doesn't hurt big groups?
---
And this ladies and gentlemen. Is why CCP likes all those skill farms. 
---
Exploration loot spew!
---
mail me when
---
Gotcha.  I get it now!  Thank you friend! 
---
That's not a gif, though.
---
LOL
---
All in all you would force people to train capital ship II and capital industrial ship to IV without injecting, good job you just force them to slowly train less than 24 hour  of training, beside if you want to nerf all the mining foreman/production skill who are the skill who take time to skill, not capital ship skills. 
---
huh
---
there is absolutely nothing wrong with paying people in different currencies, you know that right?
---
dunno man, some people and corps don't care about their killboards.

they were removed after they were super fucking broken and paid out trillions in exploiter isk

Neither do I. But if something becomes part if the meta you are at disadvantage not utilizing it.

I used it a couple of years ago, took a long break from EVE, and now that I'm back it seems way better than I remember it being before I left. Not sure if anything's actually changed, but it feels much more responsive and usable now, in my opinion. 
---
This is the right thing to do. Nothing upsetting. Just a courteous nod of appreciation. An inside reference for the cognoscenti.
---
This is CCP doing it right.
---
nice well done
---
&gt; Do Titan Doomsdays prevent warp?
---
Yes.
---
And the reason it's used all over the place is that it works. Capitals being locked down when they use their powerful abilities means they can be fought. Otherwise it'd be risk-free to delete a subcap and warp out instantly.
---
That's about the wrongest way you can go about fixing the divide between capitals and subcaps.
---
Thank you for helping to make Amamake great again.

sadly its not in line with the current average player mentality so it will never be implemented so rorqual spam is more than likely never gonna be fixed
---
Had that happen on some rather large plex purchases before, ended up with $750 worth of plex.  Sort of a shock to see the bank statement afterward when all I saw was the failure to purchase.
---
ccp guard memorial gets 1000s of upvotes but how about our girl ccp mintchip?
---
I'm sorry, but the whole "wwell we'll mine with 11 rorquals instead of 10" is a stupid arguments, the kind goons will just troll about a reddit thread. Why ? Because what's preventing them from doing it already ? That's actually everyone plan on the industry side : get more rorquals.
---
You can complain all you want but if CCP doesn't care anyway, what are you expecting ? Sure CCP priorities aren't were we would want them, but on another side if this is just a bone to make us happy, what's the other solution ? Not having anything ?

Skill Injectors aren't applied to skills; they add unallocated skill points to your pool. Unallocated skill points are applied to skills. Skill Injectors are not the only source of unallocated skill points.
---
This would have the unintended effect of limiting what skills you can apply unallocated skill points to regardless of their source.

I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but if nothing else changes with this proposed restriction it's a thing that happens.

---
AAR: Inner Hell caught some Frat. supercaps in a less-than-ideal timezone for them. Test and Inner Hell teamed up on bubbles while Test dreads midded. 
---
About a hundred dreads hit the field, and pretty much blapped the first titan. After that we moved on to killing krab supers, before clearing apostles. We moved on to firing on the second titan, and Frat. brought in another wave of fax. 
---
The last titan was heart-poundingly close to not dying. Took forever to blow through his armor and he ended up getting stable at ~97% *hull* for like 10-20 seconds, before getting chunked by a fresh subcap fleet landing on grid. 
---
everything, everything would have died. the nerf of faxes is way too huge

Great article! When CCP goes about buffing these, maybe they'll overlook the fact that navy BCs are awesome and buff my HFI too :P
---
It's kind of interesting how this seems to be the new design trend. Capitals are no longer less mobile in sublight speeds, but also have various limitations on warping if you want to use them at their peak combat potential. 
---
+2 supers
---
Lessons learned: don't jump your super in half-cocked on a gang expecting to shred them and be home free. Get more FAX. Always primary SPVG caps first. Get more FAX. Stop feeding so hard.

I was in the test ceptor fleet that was on grid for most of it, they tackled some rorquals, FRT jumped supers to save them and this guy ([https://zkillboard.com/kill/76059237/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76059237/)) bumped about 150km off. A couple of our ceptor fleets were hunting in detorid and fast burned to system to see if we could help out or at least get on KMs. It turns out that 100 ceptors + all those lokis are pretty good at killing fighters. After about 15 mins and a lot of panic about dwindling sabre numbers dreads managed to mid over.

The only situation I could see contracts being better then market is for doctrine fits. (pet peeve, I'd like militia contracts if CCP is listening in).
---
Not as much.
---
While it hurts, the largest groups have such enormous safety that there practically is no way it really affects them. One way to change that, would be to make space more vulnerable in some regions, as they are too easily closed off. As an easy example, take Delve. You effectively need to cover two or more jumps to hit the actual ratting areas in the back. While that's the nature of the space, it also makes that space incredibly safe if you got the punching power to hold the entry points.

In any case let this be a lesson to everyone, do not forget that CCP is a capitalist entity whose primary concern is generating profit. Like any capitalist entity, they do not actually give a shit about you, their employees, or anyone else. The business cares about profit, and at the end of the day thinks about you as a calculation, such that if CCP as a business believes it can generate more money by screwing you over, it will.

Can someone explain the significance of this change? Not too experienced with mining ships.
---
I am actually more impressed by this BR site. Totally love it compared to to Zkill's shit
---
nice and all but init feeds better https://br.inyour.space/?s=4662&amp;b=8551811&amp;e=90&amp;t=ufrvubafeq
---
If by new you mean ever since caps were introduced in 2005. Siege &amp; triage came with dreads and carriers (before carriers split to fax machines). Old titan AOE doomsdays prevented warp.
---
This is extremely standard stuff for capitals and I'd say the thing that was weird was not making the NSA prevent warp from the start.
---

---
Look at its lowslots
---
Asset safety really should be more a case off like. ,50% off what drops gets retrieved while the rest is stuck in the wreck to be retrieved.
---
LowSechnaya Sholupen same guys hired by Jesse AKA Sgeine Ambraelle? Yeah anyone who helps Theran are basically subhumans...
---
Wasn't there for a few days after the fact. Probably wasn't intentional.
---
Unlisted Pve nerfs though - im sure they were
---
Another boring release..  seems the norm nowadays
---
Not that u were involved wish there was a fucktard award for you and that titan pilot lmao
---
The response is not dumb.  Not asking the question before you potentially commit fraud.  Especially across international boundaries. Due to effective lobbing companies in the US several laws exist about pretending to be someone else for monetary gain.  Im not a lawyer, but I might want to talk to one before farming 50 accounts as another poster said. 
---
It would be Sweet if TEST would allow Goons to use their stations temporarily to dock and allow us to give the D to immensia easier than having to fly all the way from Delve. Maybe another friendship structure is in order?
---
i'm not pretending to be someone else
---
"Don't leave the umbrella!"
---
"Okay. What if we only leave the umbrella a little bit?"
---
"Don't do it!"
---
"Okay, okay, fine, DAD." (aside, sotto voce) "Warm up my armor rag."
---
Form what I understood only oen titan was the target, but goons were generous enough to sacrifice 3 more for the Dreadbomb gods!  
---
GJ Volta!
---
I don't go to rural regions.
---
So, I prefer a seeded market with just a few critical modules missing, giving people the fake illusion that a ship can be fitted there but still require them to travel 22 jumps to buy the compact mwd for 300k isk to complete the fit.
---
Yes, making much lower prices, due to....EXCHANGE RATES!
---
This is really great. I like the tips column as you're learning things too. 
---
By god what the hell is this.
---
I’ve never flown anything bigger than a Battlecruiser, and yet 
---
Cloaking device ? Smartbombs ? And I bet the superweapon is a boson
---
They used a ratting Titan as the example for the "formidable warships" ?
---
hupsis saatana
---
Poor carebears. Now they cannot go and safely farm those alone. :(
---
saatana perkele
---
Fountain Feeder Coalition lol.
---
I mean I don't see why not. It's a damage change, not an HP change...
---
I love that you posted this while we were still fighting, gotta get that sweet sweet karma.
---
That's what is hilarious, on this kill nobody was involved, except his corpmate ... 
---
Curious about this attitude.  I find there is a lot more action and things to do in high and lowsec than in sov null.
---
LOL. LOVE IT. 
---
I think you've got it backwards there mate. 
---
They are nerfing the HP not the Damage.
---
Its needed, the Gila is simply too good atm.
---

---
Already replaced
---
Exactly this!
---
It's too strong and here's why:
---
500% tank bonus means the gila's 10 drones have the equivalent HP of 60 unbonused medium drones.
---
meanwhile the worm's 5 drones have the equivalent tank of 20 unbonused lights and the rattle's 7 heavies have the tank of 26 unbonused heavies. the gila is way out of line with 60 effective drones to chew through.
---
Can someone pitch making a night mode to the owner of [fleetcom.space](https://fleetcom.space)?
---
I'm getting a sun tan of that white color scheme.
---
&gt; The Impetus Glamourex boosters now have an expiry date. 
---
Why? Just let the market run itself dry
---
Tried Provi?
---
*Shrug*
---
Was noticing zkillboard going mad with notifications and went to take a look.
---
It's a bloody massacre.
---
Foxholers still exist?
---
It's also got 2 active armor reps best I can tell.
---
The hero we need. 
---
We just reformed recently.
---
Ok, so I'm the character this dude is bitching about. My in game character name is DamnInjun Kado and it's also the same character name I use in several other online games.
---
First thing, where you said "openly hostile to First Nations people in North America. The character name is 'DamnInjun Kado'." 
---
I'm native American in real life. My whole fucking family is native American. So your telling me I'm being "hostile" to my own people? Get off your fucking high horse bitch and stop crying about a fucking name.
---
Also my in game name came from serious of nick names I had while I was in the Army. I took those nick names and came up with the character name DamnInjun. The "Kado" part is just one of the auto generated names from Eve.
---
I am fighting this ticket but if I have to change my name I'll be sure to change it to some equally offensive so I can collect the salt from whiny bitch ass fairies such as you. This by the way is me being "openly hostile".
---
(╹◡╹)凸
---
You can join Pandemic Horde, they welcome alphas and they mine.
---
This guy feathers
---
Public bounty on LSS btw
---
Ye, it's disgusting that FRAT are such dirty blobbers that they called in PAN FAMILY. Luckily the IMPERIUM knows who the real underdogs are and came to help in their interceptors. GOOD LUCK FIGHTING, TEST, THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. 
---
Doesn't ring a bell.
---
Jeez the memories 
---
Vituiks men
---
When dont we loose titans to be fair
---
I meant in the entire conflict foolio
---
My heart breaks for your risk free ratting.
---
Rorqual miners and cap builders like this 
---
this is adorable :')
---
"Many"...you use that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
I also support your notion of increasing their sublight speeds while removing their jump drives.
---
This man needs to be on the balance team.
---
Yup. I must be mega lucky 
---
How will goons recover!
---
Well tell us what the tricks are? 
---

You post aged well.
---
hey o/  
---
just your frendly neighbourhood Loki 
---
I'm vaguely unsociable but looking for people to blow stuff up with, is joining Horde a good plan?
---
Aww shit ... Feelsbadman having to be at work.  I always miss the spicy Fountain dread bombs.  Is it wrong of me as a local to hope some of them survive, or they have more rdy to go lol... NPC fountain... Get more dreads so we can dunk them! 
---
On the fucking weekend I had to be away
---
This might be too large for a Titan, buts its puny compared to a Iapitan.
---
Its probably going to be an event ship that players will never pilot tho.
---
I heard its weapon of choice is a lashak launcher.
---
Brave people (those who bought through the shitty app) do exist!
---
0 fucks given about highsec.
---
for traveling long distances, set destination and activate autopilot
---
Maybe it has become more stable... or your phone is different.
---
can't put all 5 in a wetu for safekeeping , now just 3 . so 2 explode/drop now per rorq death
---
We welcome our TEST brothers back on the righteous path.  Grrr gons.
---
Yes but only in null sec if I remember correctly
---
Yeah, that's a stupid change. 
---
Pretty sad. I remember when Marmite took part in some more active high-sec wars several years ago.
---
That said I expect High-sec is long dead in that respect so I guess the bottom feeders have to clump together these days to share the last morsels.
---
Are the goons winning the ISK war now?
---
i suppose, but i thought plex was much closer to the monthly price than that 
---
Not enough time to mine before update next week
---
I hope its an ice dwarf.

---
Excuse me, what does this have to do with the roaming we been on? I know most people dislike goons but it's one big Alliance like every other Alliance. 
---
But their not blue, but they can't shoot each other, but their not blue.......  FC Wut Do?
---
so where do i send my formal application for joining the triglavian race? 
---
I hope you're not doxxing anyone with that salt.
---
Grr NCPL, hat NCPL
---
I demand royalties for this unauthorized use of my meme
---
Now.
---
Entosis used to block remote support on subcaps too.  So you'd use a fax so that it could keep itself alive.
---
What channel was this in? I can't see diddly squat
---
Goons can eat shit for next 4 years and still be ok. That 14 trillion isk per month in mining alone will hold them over.
---
Triglavian supertitan NPCs warping around zapping anything larger than a battleship. #MakeEVEGreatAgain
---
Lol, no. init can eat shit. 
---
Their reasoning is they want to show a variety of icons there, to prevent the UI from looking the same across all ships. So they pretty much choose fits at random to make the UI look good 
---
I was curious so I dared to look at alliance discord (*shudder*) to see if there was any good salt -- sad to say, nope. Not sure what OP is smoking but I'm disappointed. 
---
br  
---
Team A - 188.79b isk lost, 356 ships lost  
---
Team B - 278.88b isk lost, 213 ships lost

---
Compensation in the amount if .4 isk shall hitherto, be awarded to the middle management dinosaur who claims the low hanging fruit that is said meme.
---
It's actually the same phone, and it just feels like when I first used it, 70% of the time messages/notifications wouldn't load and it generally just didn't get the information, and now it works pretty much all the time for all that, as fart as I can tell. 
---
I sadly have to agree with this. For this use, I'd prefer bringing an Onerios (even though the Zarz looks so much better).
---
You only have a small window to kill the supers, but a life time to say your sorry.
---
CCP has explained that the choice in fitting was purely aesthetic: they were going for fits that looked nice on a screen, not fits that actually did anything in game. This is also why they didn't group most (any?) of the gun racks in the video.
---
jita undock is gonna be bouncin', homie
---
Vodka brides and Ukrainians, sounds good to me.
---
OP what you smoking bro?
---
It shows that you posted 35 min ago, so they probably already did.
---
Damn it I'm going to a flogging molly concert that day and won't be able to join. 
---
You are bragging about a couple of carrier kills. It did not age well after 4 titans and a Nyx ate shit so soon after your pist.
---
You see the Finns fight very well in snow against the russian invaders....
---
 But fountain has no snow.
---
&gt; The difference between Khanid and the Blood Raiders is a little bit of sanity and a lot of PR.
---
That’s a pretty good line. 
---
look deeper
---
What is it with dread bomb lately
---
AAR or it did not happen :-P 
---
No, please explain.
---
First of all I aint bragging. Second: Here comes my question again. What does a roam have to do with some Titankills?! Was I one of the Titans?Noooo. Was one of my buddies one of the Titanpilots. Fuck nooooo. So what?? Dayum, you sound like it was you who we killed and know your fuckin pissed because we also popped your wreck mate xD 
---
Make love, not hate, man. I aint done shit to you. And i really give nothing about those Titan kills. 
---
Already replaced 
---
Calling that eating shit is kinda.... well its more like a loss of one person in goons ship hangar, and still he would have some crabbing carriers on stock.
---
I saw that and edited my comment a while ago. 
---
OMG another south african player !!
---
That's the point. It filters out blue light to make night viewing a lot less harsh.
---
Guess it doesn't work with everyone, though.
---
A single carrier kill is not anything worth posting about. And it sure as fuck wasn't my shit that got shot, me being in GSF after all lol. Just saying that seeing GSF brag about a single carrier kill pales in comparison to losing 400 bil in assets a few hours later.
---
For solo people: Providence residents are generally welcoming and non-hostile toward neutral pilots, thus it attracts a lot of people who want to find others to shoot at. 
---
For corps/alliances: Provi-bloc doesn't employ a large super-cap fleet, and has a reputation for being pretty good sports and bringing fights.
---
Show me where the priest touched you so we can do it again?
---
I do recognize that, but the removal of capital remote repairers and remote cap transfers from regular carriers onto triage only was another move towards decreasing capital versatility. 
---
Is it the moment where every goons should link X47 or the latest MER to remind you who you are ? 
---
This is actually good for Goons!
---
An official EVE discord would be an absolute nightmare to use or moderate. 
---
If the majority of their business is conducted in USD why would they let someone pay 25 cents from another currency for something that costs them more to run? 
---
So its you who decides whats worth posting. Alright then.  I thought Article 13 fucked us  Germans already in the ass but hey. Your putting the crownjewels on buddy xD
---
Lol, I beg you to drop me. I love getting my shit replaced for free lol.
---
Your comment makes zero sense.
---
Oh my frick
---
I was in Marmite for a few minutes, sad to see the last major holdout from blue highsec fold. Oh, well. Soon as they have to defend a structure warfare is going to get very different for them. 
---
Wait youb ~elite gamers~ have ratting SRP and get beaten up by the number 1 crabs.. so strange.. what has eve become...
---
This
---
Instead they will fight their wars with logi and boosters in the same alliance. It totally makes sense to join forces to have more of them being able to do so.
---
Isn't what it used to be
---
Ymmd
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
The pods is worth more then any of the dreads on field.. always look for the juciest target, don't they?

---
Insurance fraud. 
---
Yeah I fly with horde. I agree. It's to much isk for what the navies offer. When I could just use my caracal and get the same results for lower the isk cost.
---
Oh boi &lt;3 just another special one
---
Bahahaha. Gandolf dies again
---
Hahaha 
---
If 40 goon harpies was all it took for FaRT to fall over, the war already lost
---
Try r/evejobs or the official forums. 
---
4b in this case is actually pretty reasonable vs his 80b rag loss.
---
just stop posting
---
Short term probably, longer term you might be better off finding a small but active group. I'm not the most sociable guy and don't like being on comms with people who can't help but talk constantly. But there's a corp out there for you. 
---
Perkeleeee
---
Damn, I was just down there a couple weeks ago and don't plan to go back... have a beer for me.
---
But not with PGL's
---
We call them fountain feeding squad for a reason.
---
Love it... Bring all the salt, drop all the things, backstab all the allies ... Eve is more fun that way.
---
Would make more sense to allow remote repping of allies in wars. Not just of alliance dudes. 
---
Meanwhile my BR got insta blapped on jita undock while it was empty.
---
I've had those Exotic dancers for literally 5 years man, they were my family;(
---
Be full of less shit
---
Oh wow, this is bigger than I thought, thanks.
---
Mining in null then using that ore. How do I go about moving it to a station if I'm mining in say a procurer? Do I dump it in a station then get a tanky ship with a big cargo hold to move it? 
---
I want to try making things is the plan and want to be somewhat self sufficient just to see how things go.
---
I think I want to get aligned with the flow, yo.
---
you know what im talking about/get better roles
---
what the actual fuck. Dont these guys have panfam/goons level of hate for each other? or have the balance changes fucked them this hard? 
---
Very cool, wish I'd done this when I started.
---
nice i dont have a rorq
---
bombers bar will happy
---
Assume this is bait. 
---
It's Test doing the invading, and Test that has more than half the active playerbase on batphone. 
---
I feel like that's really backwards.  There is far more fun and risk in high sec.  In sov null you just sit in your territory and rat away without a care.  Unofficially I love code for making the game interesting.  In game I loathe them.
---
Huehuehue
---
Because a bot can run them 24/7 and rarely lose one.  It can also run as many as it feels like.  You'd be surprised how much raw isk a tard with 20+ VNI bots running 24/7 can bring in.  Just do the basic math and its ridiculous for next to no investment.
---
After over six and a half years playing EVE/in TEST I finally got on not just one Titan KM, but two.  
---
All in all one of the best and most exciting fleets I've ever been on.  And I even got my harpy back intact.  
---
Dude, you don't need to be such a dick. 
---
Say 'chat' one more time!
---
Channel name is CAS Mining Alliance.  Mailing list is CASMA.
---
(Had to log in to check...)
---
You can also be a big brain and target the citadel, but that works regardless of access status.
---
What is the bounty per console right now?
---
Just a heads up for people who aren't aware, You can hotkey orbital and tactical cameras to rapidly switch between them. 
---
I set tactical to my mouse wheel click and orbital to the same with a shift modifier. 
---
Makes for a nice compromise between the ideas in this thread and what we have to work with.
---
No, I'm not special. I'm just saying that bragging about killing a Thanatos is fucking dumb.
---
So if you only have Citadels in LS/WH/NS you will be immune to war-decs?
---
i have all the roles, what are you talking about
---
I don’t think it’s going to be that bad. Just means you’ll have to pay attention when you’re ratting in a carrier or super and put alts a few systems out so you can see if something is coming your way. 
---
Or alternatively, fit a carrier with armor tank and sebos. 
---
Tortillat
---
25 cents plus 60% is 40 cents, cool so I guess its still super cheap, NVM then. 
---
I don't know why so many people are getting salty about my post when I'm just letting people know that they might have missed an announcement and that their next bill might be higher than expected. What about my post tells you that in trying to fight against the change? I just wanted to make sure people affected are aware. Personally I have a few mmo subs going. I rarely play Eve these days but I kept it going because it was well priced. The increase means I can no longer justify keeping it active and CCP will lose the money they were getting from me for nothing but keeping my skill queue running. I'd say that leaves them "ISK negative" on my account going forward because the account data will still need to be stored and that has a cost, however small, attached to it.
---
Eve 2019 - kill 4 titans and someone will still complain about it 
---
When the daily kills of just the Thanatos, not counting the other racial carriers, is in double digits, no, it is not worth posting every kill. The subreddit would be spammed constantly if a Carrier dying was worth a post.
---
The Finnish Fountain Feeder Federation has already one upped you guys. Soz.
---
In a way it is... if your quest is to collect as many corpses as possible.
---
Fair point 
---
No mention of the Molok killed in X47? Weak.
---
This. What I think is going on is they are looking at very simplistic metrics for determining priorities for investment in the game.
---
Because null is the least broken aspect it has the most activity / aspiration for remaining players.
---
What is being missed is all the players not playing and what would have worked for them. Faction War represents a very different way of engaging with Eve, but it is relegated to an underinvested minor sideshow because of continuous reinvesting in what is "working" - showing better (but a downward spiral of losing) returns of the limited resources available to CCP.
---
Need a radical rethink on how to engage and take players through the first 3 years of the game.
---
IMO FW needs a solid and real end game for very experienced players, making it aspirational, with engaging content that is player driven with meaningful impacts and consequences rather than repetitive impactless grinding.
---
Yeah cuz CCP should be responsible for economics got it. Biomass quietly. I’m sure they won’t miss the 25 cents you’re no longer contributing that’s being subsidized by the rest of us. 
---
With the new rules, what's the cheapest structure that would make a corp eligible for war decs? And do those structures have to be in high sec? Or is there a setting I can turn on even if I don't have assets in space? 
---
Only tested 2 anoms so far on sisi...
---
Forsaken hubs = increased to 16-17 minutes (running more to be sure exactly)
---
Havens = decreased to 12 minutes
---
hmm?
---
perkele!!
---
Oh the meta..
---
Simple Solution: Wait for the next release.
---
Complicated Solution: pull the master branch and build it yourself
---
Who?
---
You poor sheltered little child. You don't understand a thing about economics do you? You subsidised us? Does that mean your sub will go down now? Because it would if that were true. It must be hard being so unhappy in your own mind that seeing a game company provide a cheaper service to poorer countries makes you so angry. I pity you.
---
Something about this is special, fly and dream capsuleer.
---
&gt;Neutral remote assistance will now cause a criminal timer and CONCORD response when applied to an active war declaration combat participant or limited engagement participant in highsec space
---
Can already bet there will be lots of REEEing from Wardec corps.   No more abusing this shit.
---
Came expecting to see a pile of the Bastion renters. I guess I'll have to wait a little longer
---
BFG?
---
Don't be caught without PLEX when you need it; keep it in your cargohold at all times.
---

---
So, long ago I was in a Corp decced by marmite. 
---
The day before the war I was in Jita grabbing shit and got a good prophecy fit off of a hub camper with marmite.  It was pretty reasonable. During that war i flew cov ops and stayed away from trade hubs. Never saw a red.
---
Honestly some of the most fun I have had in EVE is related to high sec shenanigans and running around/ambushing war deccers. 
---
GET REKT ANOM RATTERS again
---
This should be more correct, baddies on the left, good guys on the right

---
OOF! Looks like you got us good!
---
i appreciate my new corp mates in the first nullsec corp i've ever been in. we're bad and lose almost all of our fights, but the comraderie really is something, and when we do get the rare kill, it is worth all the lost ships! 🙂
---
If you lose your probes, there's a chance you can get them back with the "Reconnect to lost probes" on the probe scanning window.
---
Yer, its bad etiquette now to just say well done to the attackers, gotta spin that spodbrain shit instead.
---
Don't 
---
Doesn’t make me angry bud it makes me indifferent knowing you’re paying the same as everyone else now. If anything you should be grateful you got to play cheaper than the rest of the world for as long as you have. Stop acting like a baby back bitch. You’re welcome for my service 
---
My first and only interaction with that corp was a few days ago when a single member of theirs brought like 35 rorqs to a moon frack.
---
I feel like this is some kind of karmic payback for how much goddamn xenotime that king of the autists sucked up
---
Corpse 0001. Try get 9999 :)
---
Go to Providence, make new friends, learn how not to get killed in nullsec (it's the best place to do it if I'm honest - if you can survive NRDS, NBSI is easymode), then branch out to a nullsec bloc where you can do pretty much everything you can do in high sec and many things you cannot do in high sec, more profitably.
---
Get another rorqual pilot ?
---
With the advent of wars will paco ever learn to fucking read? 
---
Ah, American... Never mind, sorry I said anything. Carry on Sir nothing to see here.
---
It's one of those things that isn't immediately obvious. That's one of the reasons the first thing I do with any software is poke around all it's options menus.
---
good riddance

Happy cake day

That’s insmother

Where is your sense of adventure?!

The  Finnish Space Jaegers got fucked

Avoid building one ship at a time.  Either buy off alliance contracts or build 20 ships and sell 15 of them on contract.
---
Chat
---
For as long as I can remember (5 years) a subscription has ranged from $11-$15 per month depending on how big a time block you buy. A one month equivalent in PLEX has always been about $20. 
---
Is this to defend the structure you have to designate as a "target" for your wars in incoming updates?  Structure defense fleets.... yay. 
---
I have some FC corpses.
---
spod bless
---
eve conspiracy theories are real
---
"it was test that made frat attack test so that test could  defend aggainst frat!!"
---
i mean that's what youre saying right?
---
I'm pretty sure it's not a doxx. I'm not even sure that's his real name.
---
There are just some try hards who think that ratting in null and pressing F1 if their overlord tells them to makes them into an elite PvP warrior with the certificate to look down on the filthy highsec dwellers.  
---
I have been in all parts of EVE for a while and highsec offers the most interesting and diverse gameplay in my opinion.
---
you might not agree but its the first real offense on frat sov by test that happened earlier today
---
I'm just going to say that taking that VNI bonus off and not doing anything else for some other viability is gonna see a drop off in the usage of VNIs across the board.  The best change would've been both a base speed decrease with the sig radius increase so that ratting with a perma AB is made far less viable while keeping the better long-range viability of its drones (with the speed bonus).
---
the smallest ship you can use is probably a confessor to run sites in holes with wolf rayet effect (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_space#Wolf_Rayet).i don't have a fit for it but it shouldn't be too hard to find. it could probably do c2 sites too, tho im not sure. else, a passive tank drake can run c1s easy and it's super cheap
---
Considering it's exactly half and not some weird percentage I wouldn't be overly worried
---
Looks like the new x2 siege module bonus isn’t being applied.

Well im 22 and I think eve is great, it's a niche game and quite hardcore and complex. Its by essence not appealing to millenials but they are exceptions 
---
/u/CCP_Falcon please look into this, I sure hope this is a bug on sisi and doesn't go live.
---
If so, then cool beans.
---
Bosonic Field Generator, I think, although I've only ever heard them called bosons
---
Fountain Feeder Federation strikes again!

Check to make sure your skills on SISI match your skills on TQ. I've had that freak out before.

tbf, this is right around asakai levels of losses

Contract it to ‘Elleanor Ripley’.

/for science, obviously.

Lore-wise I'd imagine that the pirate ships that capsuleers are flying are the ones that would be used by pirate *commanders*, not their average junk. Pirates would have much more unequal resource allocation between their lords &amp; captains vs the cannon fodder. The guys at the top take the best of everything for themselves to keep themselves alive and powerful. The guys at the bottom are flying the shitty ships that we kill by the dozen.
---
Professional militaries OTOH want to have their entire force be the best possible by elevating the lowly grunt. Real generals and admirals don't get special equipment made just for their personal use. So the Navy ship doesn't represent throwing their cannon fodder away in waves, it means that even their basic troops are flying a better-than-average ship. Their special forces get Tech 2 ships which are better, but still not as good as a pirate ship.
---
When the empires work on something **really* special, that they devote extra resources to, you get Concord ships.

The only "salt" I heard was basically "darn Russians, just let us have the biggest super tally for this one day"

At least a banana's worth

T1 cruisers and Battlecruisers should be able to do it. 
---
In Pyfa aim for around 150-200dps tank and you shoul dbe able to complete most C1 sites.
---
For C1 sites?
---
Surely any t1 cruiser should be able to do it... rupture, thorax, vexor, omen, arbitrator etc...  Those are quite cheap.
---
It's sad to think that this has anything to do with actual goonswarm, this is an offshoot irrelevant finnish corporation.
---
Just more Rest of Eve propaganda.
---
ur farm is our content, thank u
---
If you get a good battle cruiser you can blast some c1's then go to c2's with a bit of a upgraded fit. Honestly if you know what you're doing or want to go to the deep end and have a good challenge a worm works. 
---
Vexor/worm for c1 
---
I use to run c2's in a hurricane so it's not as bad once you get in and run some. 
---
👀
---
Agreed. Zarmazd is really tanky and fast, can fit smartbomb and multiple sebo so good when logis are under heavy fire or e-war.
---
Sadly not in this case.
---
It's fountain feeder federation gawd
---
They are the corp that always skips ahead moons in locust fleets iirc. I think they got threatened with a commissar every time but after three or four times of not getting commissared I guess they figured out it wasn't going to happen. 
---
Karma gets her way eventually. 
---
During a whole lot of the metacide module re-balance they changed things so that t1-&gt;t2-&gt;faction-&gt;deadspace was a logical progression.
---
Officer resist mods got the shaft because there wasn't *room* above deadspace for them. High-end resist mods were already too strong. Some other stuff they managed to work with weird fitting stuff (ex officer points &amp; webs work because they don't fit on bonused hulls).
---
It’s 15 minutes + or minus 3 minutes according to Killahbee on a twitch show a few weeks ago
---
A new space that Supers must enter to jump.
---
Each jump, you must clear 3 waves of Triglavians (under a 60 minute timer) in order to successfully arrive at your destination.

&gt; The following player owned structures will count towards War Eligibility:

&gt; - All Upwell Structures

&gt; - Starbase Control Towers

&gt; - Player-owned Customs Offices
---
For 100m ISK you can buy a small Control Tower and anchor it on any empty moon. You don't even need to fuel it.
---
Oh i don't know about that.
---
Lol you can drop dreads practically any system in Delve [from FWST](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range/Naglfar,5/FWST-8). How much of Deklein is within jump range from Venal?
