hold up, for a second there i thought you were implying that CCP has the brains to test their shit before they release it, I think you are asking too much of them...
---
---
---
easy workaround though, just move to your right most monitor by setting it up "on the left" in the options.
---
working as intended!
---
Is there a way to see my skills and skill queue without logging into the full game?
---
An awful browser that cant run most websites functionally when you're already gonna tab between 5 game clients so you might as well pull up chrome?

....write a PAPER letter to Hilmar at CCP.

That's a pretty small talos

Agreed, it was entirely this dipshit's PR doublespeak

If you want a more powerful tool that lets you generate skill plans, use EveMon, but that requires a bit of setting up. 
---
I’m crushing on the kikimora right now. It’s fast, good looking, and I love me some disintegrator death ray weapons
---
It is absurd how someone could act like the comment didn't directly imply ads in the future like we are now seeing.
---
As someone whose mothertongue is german... WTF???
---
Golem. Love being less cost efficient than a carrier.

In all seriousness though, it's a bad ass looking ship.

---
&gt; 3- I'm French, but fuck that song, for real.
---
Somehow none of these things are true lol
---
Gone but not forgotten? :D
---
LSH are some of the ballsiest dudes out there, not a lot of groups in this game have the audacity to regularly poke at coalition supers in coalition space. 
---
and the word is *lose*
---
Thanks for your contribution. You're so helpful and relative. 
---
Not half bad, always love Van Halen
---
Thank you! That's exactly what I was looking for. I may look at EveMon later, too.
---
But hey, no ads!
---
personally I like the look of the new launcher.
---
However I couldn't care less what it looks like or what it shows, I hit play on my accounts and then play the games not stare at the launcher.
---
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
---
Long live scorch!
---
What if you could toggle to a tabular view, much like inventory
---
Do you need to leave your current corporation before you can apply to/be accepted to a new one?
---
CCP: NEW LAUNCHER LAYOUT! 
---
Community guy: Plz don't feed me ads every time I jump or undock! 
---
CCP: ???  
---
It's a good thing that AGE is irrelevant. Skills and application of knowledge matter now.   
---
Being older doesn't make you more fit, smarter or better. 
---
How else we gonna learn? Put on a seminar?
---
If the guy violated the EULA, and let's face it, if they banned him he probably did, then no, there is jack all he can do about it.
---
hah insult to injury when he gets bounced out of range of many by his support coming in. 
---
F for your dead corp
---
&gt; but terminating an account without any valid reasons doesn't work in real life
---
Unless I am missing a reference here or something, yeah they can terminate whatever account they want to. I'm pretty sure they do not need a reason to do so either if they really want to get rid of someone's account for whatever reason, and that is most likely stated in the TOS when you make the account.
---
Yeah I want to know who's bonehead idea it was to exclude it.
---
Because ads that last 5 seconds are followed by ads that stay longer.
---
Phoenix
---
&gt; ofc im not stupid enough to run them from same pc
---
Judging from this post we can see how that turned out :smart:
---
Blizzard is a US company, and therefore, held to US laws. CCP is bound by the law in Iceland.
---
I just opened the launcher hoping to see this and was massively disappointed that it wasn't anything like your post.
---
flex bro. flex. 
---
So do I. That doesn't make removing it from the launcher a good idea.
---
See what happens when pearl abyss buys your game? This is just the start, get ready. 
---
What fucked up world do you live in? Both the restaurant example and the actual TOS examples you are talking out of your ass on lol.
---
I think Scam Citizen may be more your speed.
---
Why are devs spending time fixing things that aren't broken when there's plenty of broken things to fix?
---
I'm sorry to disappoint you on your cake day D:
---
If he hadn’t commented you’d be angry that CCP was silent, wouldn’t you?
---
that sounds fun as fuck
---
That's pretty awesome dude!
---
I tabbed over to the launcher, just as a skin ad rolled to an Omega ad while I'm running 2 Omega'd accounts.  
---
I like the new launcher over the old one, but why you lyin' CCP?
---
I know a corp recruiting.
---
As a preface, I really can't narrow it down to just one ship. There are just way too many ships in this game that I like, and what I use most changes all the time. But I can mention a couple of my *current* favorites, at least.
---
I've always been very fond of the Algos hull. An Algos was the very first new ship I bought in eve after the tutorial, oh so many moons ago, and I just love the way it looks and how powerful I felt first stepping into a destroyer and giving those dirty NPCs what-for. (I still have that Algos in a hisec station somewhere!) As such, I've been on somewhat of a kick with the Magus in small gangs recently, as it's basically an Algos that someone gave super soldier serum to. It's still got all the droney goodness of the Algos, but it's also tougher and stupid-fast for a destroyer and can pull off all sorts of shenanigans with the MJFG and command bursts, and it's just such a fun ship to fly along with a half-dozen or so likeminded pilots. 
---
The other ship I want to mention as one of my current favorites is the mighty Wolf. The Rifter hull is one of the most iconic ones in eve, and like the Magus to the Algos, the Wolf is basically a Rifter on turbo steroids. Assault frigates have been one of my favorite ship classes in general since their revamp last year, and the Wolf in particular exemplifies everything I love about the class now - incredible power in a pint-sized package. Almost nothing can match its combination of speed and power - there's faster things, and things that outgun it, but very little can dish out (or withstand) as much hurt as it does while skittering around the battlefield at the speeds it can reach. I use the Wolf in larger fleets a lot, where its small target size and high speed make it extremely difficult for fleets of larger ships to effectively damage and where its high speed can be put to good use zooming around the battlefield tackling stuff (and often, killing it). 
---
Aw man this almost makes me want to do FW...
---
I read the article after reading your comment because it intrigued me. I was not disappointed.
---
Having fun doesn't mean your good at the game. A good feed is always fun but in the context of this thread POS party is far from decent.
---
&gt;apoc now flair
---
&gt;still has hope that there aren't people that retarded
---
well i'm afraid i have some bad news...
---
You seem to be forgetting which game it is.
---
I have download everything selected on a fresh install and it's not downloading everything. I just ended up copying the files off another drive :/. 
---
I think the reason it's so low is because there was no aar attached to post. 
---
dis dude, how many toons you running
---
Tbf Skillu always seemed to be irritated with Tri, even when they worked together.
---
yeah the npc dreads, carriers supers and titans still cause issues with bads not having an uptodate overview
---
No. You can apply while in a corp. Your corp will change when your application is accepted on their end. Or if they invite you, the change becomes effective only when you accept the invitation. Then your employment history will show a smooth transition without a transitory NPC corp blemish.
---
&gt; just use a rorq

everything wrong with eve point 917

The first thing you should do is hire a Texas Lawyer. Because Texan law always apply anywhere in the world. It is likely that what they do is illegal in Texas. Please keep us updated once you hired a good Texan.

i re balanced after I made the mistake when i started, that the social skill in a mmo was potentially a usefull skill. I was stuck with wonky atributes untill ccp let us remap 3 times 2 years later.
---
I mean, then it would be like what we have now. So we've just gone in a circle
---
Why would you do this?
---
Does the citadel have to be gone, or can I do that for a standing citadel that's in wh space?
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, I too see \~200MB usage on my 1080p monitor with the launcher as small as possible
---
I guess this is a good opportunity to say a heartfelt "thank you". When I started out, your posts in the NCQ&amp;A forum were mightily helpful, especially the ones referenced above about remaps.
---
64-bit would take a client rewrite, and as of right now, its not needed.
---
If and when it's implemented it would be for future proofing, because eventually we will hit the 4GB limit.
---
Kill yourself retard.

I use Shadowplay to record, free with NVIDIA graphics cards and have no problems with it. [My in game gfx settings.](https://i.imgur.com/ymm0iZR.png)

Honestly, until you start hitting the massive fights, unless you have a PC that is about to explode, you should be good to play it on high, depending on how many clients you have up and running.
---
What's your PC specs?
---
I meant with columns for details though
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

You have Eve University operating a Hisec campus in Gallente space. [It will help you learn about everything, not just mining](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Welcome_to_EVE_University)

I'd answer in kind but am wary of responding unironically to whoever you are. It seems to get you all hot and salty.
---
The extra 17% are for cryptomining
---
Click and hold above the Eve logo in the top and drag it to the centre where you can readjust the size of your launcher.   
---
You've already clicked start on at least one char because you're playing it down at the bottom, so how'd you do it?

CCP, hire this man!

Congratulations, you're the only one.

Oh no.

I like the idea, just not quite sure what I'd want to see there.  Know what would be really amazing?  Have the launcher be basically the PC version of neocom on IOS/android...  Search assets of many characters from the laucher?  Yes please!
---
That is an utterly ridiculous division of space.
---
Not yet
---
Yup, automatically don't like the new launcher. I like keeping note of online player count - it's like CCP know "Eve is dying" and want to hide it considering where they parked it on today's downgrade. Idgaf about the ads but the amount of empty space they leave is stoopid. PAPLS get your northern hemisphere guys working smarter.

I'd love for amarr to get more people in US tz and throw themselves at everything. Flying t1 crusier-dessie-frig meta fit. Doesn't matter who wins or loses just find fights and do what you can do have good ones. You don't need to always run fancy stuff in formal fleets to have fun. just fleet up, undock, explosions.

Agreed! The look and playstyle of the Orthrus have made this my favorite ship upon my return after a hiatus. It's so flexible and can be fit in a ton of different ways.

Possibly use the amazing tech that is RSS for this this I would spend way more time in the launcher(and probaly more in game by extension)

    ad·ver·tise·ment
---
    /ˈadvərˌtīzmənt,ədˈvərdizmənt/
---
    noun
---
    a notice or announcement in a public medium promoting a product, service, or event or publicizing a job vacancy.
---
```
---
In [the linked image](https://i.imgur.com/OwjxWfG.png) would you not consider:
---
* The two 'SERENITY SKINS AVAILABLE' panels to be a notice in a public medium promoting a product (the skins).
---
* The two 'EVE WORLD TOUR' panels to be a notice in a public medium promoting an event (the tour).
---
That would make 4 out of 9 of the panels shown advertisements (though I'd agree that they also qualify as news).
---
I'm fine with you showing this stuff in the launcher, I just want:
---
* Stop showing me 'UPGRADE TO OMEGA' when all of my accounts added to the launcher area already Omega.
---
* Stop with the panels that animate between different news items, a list is perfectly fine and animations are annoying as fuck on a second monitor.
---
* Give me some kind of option to reduce the size of the news/adds once I've seen them 50x already.

---
Dude this is good work, they could take some inspiration from this, having usefull informations about the skillqueue, evemails, etc is what I'd like for a new launcher.
---
A guy did that too for the Elite Dangerous launcher.
---
 The community always offer a better product because this is what we want.
---
there's a specific reason it won't look like this. i've been talking to the launcher and esi devs about this off and on for a long fuckin time now.
---
they simply refuse to add the SSO endpoints that show what chars exist on what account. without that, this cannot exist.
---
they claim its a gdpr/security issue but i think they are wrong but that's the way it is for now.
---
Didn’t you hear that FW is dead?
---
The only actual add I've seen so far is for their game related store where they sell the clothes with eve logos on them.
---
Why launch a browser when the launcher is already there. Its not a big deal but it was nice and convienent.
---
They don't do business in the US though. Our purchases are from Iceland. I get an alert on my credit card every month because of it. No lawyer would touch a "I got banned for no reason" for a foreign company, as the person has no legal recourse.

Besides, do you honestly believe idiot OP got banned for no reason?

I know you think all krabs should die, but then, the game dies. But you are too stupid to realize this.

Get good. Because you obviously are not.

Im a fan of the Enforcer with the police skin, I just wish the marshal was the same but larger, Would have been much nicer.
---
Why wouldn't they break third-party launchers? They can't show you ~~ads~~ news in those!
---
Hi, I'm a space lawyer, you may or may not heard of me but on my wall of frame I was involved in the Mittani affair, who led to his unban or the Marshy affair, who led to his unban and is right now camping the shit out of delve ! People get ban for unfairly reason, most of them end up being perma ban (Like Gaara Sniper or Gigx) but other call me and get saved from CCP ban hammer. If YOU too want the top of the pop, the one above the rest, better than calling saul, contact me, for a few bil you can get free of charge TODAY !!
---
You use a computer without launching a browser by habit?
---
Other than the fact that you've either not resized your launcher after the change, or you did it for the memes, there's the same amount of 'ads' as in the old launcher.
---
So I don't know why so many people whine about that part. There was literally always a window, like the first one we can see here, that cycled between different offers going on from CCP. The two other boxes are news, not ads.
---
While the placement of the accounts you have saved is something we all have to get used to, at least we can resize the launcher (can't even remember if we could do the same to the old launcher) to fit more accounts down that row.
---
I don't think all krabs should die. I think local, supercap proliferation, alliance gates, citadels, and cynojammers make 0.0 too safe. And maybe we can have limited local since we have all these other tools for safety.
---
Couple bill in a day if there's another supercar brawl like UALX

Industrial is OK if you do it in Nullsec, and keep an eye on JF prices.

0.0 has always been safest place on game. Get over it.
---
I don't know why you'd think CCP would want anyone using a third party launcher.
---
I just want pvp man. FW is a means to get that. 
---
the only thing that really bugged me about ads was the old launcher would flip through them at sanic speed.
---
I doubt CCP is compelled to support 3rd party programs; especiallly if those programs are not sanctioned by CCP.
---
I wish they would see us less as a community and more as a customer that they keep pissing on.

Even if they're using third party launchers, that means people paying and playing.

I don't know if CCP can afford to lose more players than they already have, but you'd know that better than I.

You got a point but it takes up such a small amount of space and provides convenience to some players. Would be nice to see it come back.

I mean even the "we got blobbed" narrative is kinda a hard hit on their morale, imagine if tomorrow Mittani push a narrative "we could not defend this [x] asset because we outnumber, in our space..."

Good solo pvp is still really fun to watch.

Plus the IGB wasn't even CCP's work, it was a package put together by a company that died.

Raven State Issue. The original and navy are too lacking

Unless you have roles in your current corp, in which case you either need to drop roles and wait 24 hours or you can quit corp to immediately join another. That's often why you see people with lots of npc corps on their employment history.

Never said it wouldn't, just a bit perplexed. Either way it's a better use of space

Asset safety doesn’t work in wormhole space. If you lose access to stuff in a wormhole then it’s as good as gone unless you get access again.

If you want to keep (relatively) new players like myself and keep the old guard, you'd do well to stop fucking with stuff that ain't broke. Instead of bombarding your existing player base with ads for a game they are currently playing, why don't you go piss in your own Cheerios instead of ours.

I use a third party launcher purely because I get fed up after years of accounts constantly being deleted and settings reset..  Swapped to a third party launcher and haven't had a single problem since. So until they can actually build a launcher which is stable and functional I honestly think its a necessity that they allow/support third party launchers. 
---
custom launchers don't modify eve online client
---
Yeah, I'm not going to lie, people on this sub are pretty pathetic. It's a launcher. It can be resized. There are some legitimate complains about accounts not showing for some people but this bullshit about 90% of the real estate being ads is autistic screeching.
---
Which is OK as that's what this sub is all about.
---
The old launcher also had a single window that displayed offers / ads from CCP. Then there's two more that show of have I assume is the latest news / devblogs. Since you can resize the launcher you can even reduce the amount of boxes down to two. If you have a lot of accounts just extend the launcher vertically.
---
I have more than 5 accounts and it doesn't bother me one bit. It's a launcher. Honestly, who fucking cares.
---
SC never helps US tz minnies. we shoot them.
---
Yeah, I think this is the sixth time for the last year that I'm having to re-add my accounts to the launcher.

Yes my one post is exactly the same as the (literally) 10 posts on /r/eve about the launcher

Ok. Explain it then

There's no need to perfect intel local. Literally, if you need your hand held to krab, then you should stop laying.
---
So, enlighten us. I'm assuming by your comment that you mean you are that guy. How is your niD in high sec
---
That is disingenuous as fuck. 
---
You *deliberately* chose to phrase it as "right now", in full knowledge that there would be ads placed there in the future.
---
If you wanted to actually be clear about it, instead of playing semantics like a politician. You *could* have said: "There are no ads as of right now, but there are plans for ads for Omega / NES in the future". But you didn't. Because you knew what the response would be. *That* is what makes it deliberately misleading.

A long time ago you could build capitals in highsec, there are still a few that haven't left since then. Since you can't take highsec gates with a capital they are stuck in the system they were in when the change was implemented.
---
Those ones teleported in were killed by players. This carrier is most likely one of the few that live in highsec. They have rules they must follow: https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203280661-Capital-Ships-in-High-Security-Space
---
Example:
---
&gt; As of right now, CCPs microtransactions have not made me unsubscribe my accounts.
---
I've been on both sides of the coin. It's dull both ways.
---
Maybe think about the last time you had an edge of the seat, heart beating, fighting to survive moment. It's those "oh shit" moments that are exhilarating and get talked about for ages.
---
Do I recount stories of stomping pubbies with my super? No, nobody cares. They're oppressive, dull and ultimately uninteresting. 
---
No not mine.  Friend of mine.   
---
bad damage control, followed by 2 edits that make it worse...nice.  
---
Guess what, we don't like your launcher....never did. Now you have just maximized the shit we never liked, and minimized the only fucking thing we care about. Logging in our accounts. Nice!.  
---
Wish I knew what happened to you guys, used to be so passionate about the game, and now all you care about is pushing your microtransactions and subs. What a shame to watch what was a good developer fall apart.  
---
F.
---
Ok. What do you know
---
I know EMF Coldwarrior from his time in Syndicate, he's defenitely NOT a bot(er).
---
Btw, if that would be a punishing by ccp, there would be a lot of players waiting for the nid. 
---
So did you hack us or not we need to know 
---
ISBoxer EVE Launcher will have a patch out soon, no idea about the other 3rd party launchers
---
Same tbh, got sick of the official launcher derping.
---
A wreck because I know something fun happened. 
---
I know from the image it's a niddy....  It's also a cap in hs. Back then you could have them and the caps that remained docked weren't moved.   Or something like that.   
---
Long story short.  Caps used to be allowed in hi-sec long long long ago.  there are a handful of legacy caps out there.  they are strictly forbidden from using any amount of offensive capacity. or else they will get teleported out.  
---
the most famous hi sec capital is infact   
---
THE VELDNAUGHT - a hi sec revelation that mines all day 
---
64-bit client is still on its way, it's been announced and will launch eventually. though its not likely tied to the launcher  
---
eventually hitting the 4gb limit is a certainty in eve during large fights
---
this only shows that you are still a noob and have not learned anything.... only people not around lowsec or Amarr militia will read this and find it honest. You are acting exactly like failmoc posting on reddit looking for a high five for things you had little to do with and obviously dont understand. You shame yourself, you shame the 44th and you shame Amarr

Judging by the recent posts this sub only plays the launcher not the game itself.
---
CCP started this shit long before Pearl was involved.
---
Dude, literally lick my Iteron Mk V. 
---
It is needed and they are working on it: https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amuc4p/64_bit_client_pushed_with_latest_sisi_update/

When i started playing....we didn't have a launcher, or ads.
---
Press play now or add account

Son....this is the age of wide screen.

If you're looking to bot now to justify a previous ban for :reasons: then you should prob just fuck off forever.

Your opinion is nice, but that isn't the way everyone plays.
---
Some days I just want to chill in my crab system and kill some rats or mine some ore.
---
When you come along in a small gang and start harassing me, I'm going to make it as unfun as I can for you and defend my space with all the tools available to me.
---
It is a new problem. The adds went from being 25% of the Launcher to 75% of it.  
---
Compared to pre launcher days where there was like a line of text saying "hey guys we actually released updates to the game, not our monetization  practices"
---
It was 100% not needed. It was a waste of resources that could have been used elsewhere to fix things that are actually broken.
---
Because the launcher is a web browser running javascript, and the game is a mix of Python and C.  Different folks probably work on each.
---
Also, they're probably preparing to advertise more, to bring them in-line with other company's launchers.  For example, Blizzard wanted me to know about a special in WoW when I launched Destiny 2.
---
The one you can use in real life, pearl abyss bought your game and u give it 1 year before its dead. 
---
I have a feeling this is my bad :d.
---
Yes because those posts were all made by a hivemind who pre planned it. Your shitpost is of lower quality than most of those.
---
Damn O.O
---
Did Pearl Abyss buy Blizzard and Bethesda?  'Cause they've got ads in their launchers too.
---
would be so awesome if Google returned a 404 if you typed google into google or chrome. Missed opportunity.
---
Is it bring your stupid idea to reddit week or what out here
---
Datamine that shit, let us know what ads we should be angry with before we see them!
---
Oh who gives a shit. If CCP wants to make money selling ad space, let them. Maybe it’ll help them afford things you maniacs clamor for all the time. 
---
Wow. You made those? Those are awesome.
---
They won't make it stop raining unless you do it first :P
---
It's even worse that each successive poster looked at /r/eve, saw that there were already several posts whining about the launcher, and thought
---
sure, I'll toss my shit onto the pile
---
seriously, what stupid fucking argument is this? The /r/eve circlejerk is going strong and anyone who doesn't enjoy reading 10,000 words about the rage du jour is somehow equally guilty of being a verbose reactionary mouthbreather? wew
---
If you don't know something really obvious while trying to dole out advice it pretty much negates your ability to give advice on anything pertaining to this games macro political structure.
---
We call them Canadians bud. 
---
The old launcher was wildly broken and incredibly outdated.
---
&gt;Skills and application of knowledge matter now.
---
And the openness of ones wallet...
---
Isn't Eve Time just GMT Time? 
---
JavaScript developers writing a web page aren't terribly useful debugging Python and C code.
---
Oh man... you're going to be pissed when I post tomorrow. 
---
Am I missing something because I don't see any ads. I got a 3 blog posts about updates to the game, and a promotion telling me about some skins available and telling me I can add Omega time but I'd hardly call that an ad.
---
Sure I'd love being able to make the window even thinner just for monitor size reasons (since I play on a potato), but 4 game news items are hardly ads. Have you looked at other launchers?
---
Holy fuck, you are precious.
---
Well worth the read. As a 2 month old capsuleer, this was a badass story. 10/10

---
I actually really like the new launcher
---
its friday now so i just want to say that im sorry reddit is a bunch of salty memelords (ღ˘⌣˘ღ)
---
i think the new launcher is fine and people here just dont seem to understand what an ad is and just want to be upset about how things change (∩╹□╹∩)
---
please just dont add real ads in the future. game news is actually useful (✿◠‿◠)
---
Do you expect more from a highsec miner?
---
It regularly dropped settings and auth tokens...
---
Yes I said that.   
---
 
---
&gt;Contest the field?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Their comp is clearly get in kill some shit move on.
---
3/4 of the things are news and not ads that's kinda impressive. I think if you have an omega account you should be able to make them at least all news.
---
Er yep. They have no control capacity other than booshing. Its a fleet for harassing not engaging....they just got caught.
---
What did they say.
---
they have enough graphics artists, they need people that can actually code.
---
What did you expect from out community. Bunch of crybabies 🙄
---
His post was worth infinitely more than your waste of data.
---
Try a rollback. :-)
---
*being mad emoji*
---
CCP doesn't have any other games though.
---
Does that mean Im going to have to see BDO shit on EVE?
---
they're stuck except they can jump out to lowsec (and then promptly lose 99% of their value)
---
The argument that other companies do it doesn't make ccp right to do it.
---
basically /r/eve's response to anything
---
If they want to keep an Omega ad then they should make it either "Extend Omega" if non-repeating and "Thank You" if repeating...
---
I doubt anybody invested enough in EVE to use a third party launcher won't quit over it breaking. 
---
Blizzard and Bethesda stopped caring about their customers long before Pearl Abyss was a thing. Shit they are a couple of the folks who wrote the script on how to alienate your customers. If EA was Jesus, ActiBlizz and Bethesda would be John and James.  
---
The funny thing is, I don't think half the posts actually looked at the launcher. There is still only one ad window. The other three are release notes and downtime announcements.
---
All I see is an in game promotion and 2 news articles... Where's the ads?
---
The old one? Yeah it was slow too. I have my groups set up on this one and I just have to push one button and all the right accounts load. It's pretty nice
---
Shh, not too loud. We're supposed to be jerking each other off about ads and using our lunch breaks at work to make UI mockups that no one at CCP will see

thank you but that still leave the BC section with the same problem

Why is /r/eve my favorite subreddit right now

For a launcher? God, I hope it just works cause all I use the thing for is launching some accounts and then its hidden under a bunch of windows.

It’s change. People get irrational about change. I mean there are people still mad about entosis ffs.

Couldn't agree more!

Some of theses people will complain about everything when a videogame to them  IS EVERYTHING ! You're not dealing with regular  losers here man , were talking SPACE LOSERS.
---
Funny how THE VERY PEOPLE who complain about Hi Sec and not being able to grief other players easily in EVE , cant even HANDLE a new launcher and immediately take on the behaviour of their cry baby Hi Sec victims

How can I upvote this more than once?

You claim you have evidence but don't show it. Off to a great start.
---
You then claim you want to fucking *sue* the company because you fucked up? You know that thing you agreed to, called the Terms of Service? It says they can terminate your account whenever they want for any reason they want. Maybe you should read it before you stick your head any further up your ass.
---
I disagree the fitting is very good and occult/mystic isn't always optimal for a fit. Dps is the same with normal ammo compared to t2.
---
They're there. Just put on your tinfoil hat, assume CCP is doing everything bad, and the ads will magically appear.
---
We have a new launcher?
---
Sounds intentional
---
Have you thought about taking a look at the screen? If you had you'd see that the carrier is in fact not flagged criminal.
---
CCPlease bring back the splash page log in screen.
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
*cries in super pilot*
---
Whatever. I have 10 accounts and play on 2 27" and a 23"(portrait or landscape), and on any screen/ any configuration it is fine. https://i.imgur.com/ZNkdHbe.png quit whining.
---
I understand the need to fix the shit show that was the previous version of the launcher and truthfully I don't mind the ads EXCEPT when they take up 75% of the launcher with shit that no one gives a rats ass about. Nice use of that oh so valuable Dev time.
---
See, thats where i got thrown off. This isnt my screen. The guy who posted this in our discord said he was criminal.
---
Why? The brutix navy issue is arguably the best bang-for-buck pvp ship in the game. It's incredibly strong and you can fit it really well for well under 200m.
---
This post is basically "I'd like a better krabbing ship for my sp level". The navy BCs are all pvp-oriented; if you want better subcap ticks, get a rattlesnake. 
---
He didn't fucking hack you, he just took your character's picture from the internet and used photoshop.
---
Unfortunately for you, you don't own your character assets. He is not impersonating you, thus no foul done.
---
If the audio would fade and come back during the spinning.
---
Oh well if it's just fine for you then that settles it. CCP can do no wrong!
---
haha oh man that'd be great
---
Lol, found the FC of the gate camp op.
---
That's not fair.
---
I cloaky camped this guy for two weeks and didn't get anything until my group redeployed somewhere else. I wanted that kill.
---
He has 3 other character that he super-rats with, about 6-8 hours a day when left alone.
---
Took em a whole weekof bitching on reddit to ban a person so obvious of botting. Its like they dont give a fuck. And thats what bothers me
---
My only complaint is that group launching are no longer as intuitive as it used to be, but that's offset by now being able to have multiple groups. Other than that, I guess I like that it's now widescreen-sized.
---
They literally rearranged the info already on the old launcher and added tons of new functionality. It's like complaining about the shiny new car you got because you don't like where the logos are on this model.
---
Because well always find something to bitch about for a week
---
Maybe I'm missing something here, but the new launcher looks just fine with my one account? 
---
I'm sorry I just don't understand all the hate the launcher is getting. It looks streamlined, and has the typical ads for the game/devs. 
---
Gif does not loop. ~~Boo!~~ REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
No, but the wages could be...
---
How in the fresh fuck would either of those things get a nid into highsec sherlock 
---
Legion has to be my favorite hands down.  Love the way it looks (some of the setups look great, others not as much).  Love the versatility.  Just wish the SP loss mechanic was gone.  
---
Works boring so I am back. 
---
You're the one complaining that I am 'still at it'... This to me is fully entertaining. You're making yourself look like a complete and utter twat and it's pure gold. 
---
Think your boyfriend might get jealous though, all this attention your giving me. No you can't suck my dick. 
---
Hes a neut. You can change your overview to have neut be just as bad as criminals. Legacy caps are super super rare. There are a couple still left in HS. Chirbba a mod in the sub has a titan in HS. 
---
They cant really do anything  but use them as miners.
---
Not alot of isk
---
The music timed up perfectly with those first focused voids going off. 
---
&gt;I don't mind the ads EXCEPT when they take up 75% of the launcher 
---
Ok. Luckily we aren't there yet so you have nothing to worry about. Also, you're supposed to be looking at the game 99% of your time and not the launcher. If you aren't, you're doing it wrong.
---
they already spent cycles working on it...
---
It's part of the wormhole experience

No need to undock. If this song is played it must be hell of a party inside.

Legit we had a cap rorq pilot saying a cyno was just lit on him but he lit it on himself while making all of Det ready to save him.
---
I think it’s one of those things you have to be there for to be honest, but here goes nothing. Basically test showed up to kill the horde Tatara and they formed a lot of dudes expecting horde to show up to defend it but they didn’t, everyone was really bored shooting so sue decided to “defend it” for the memes and started shooting goons, got yelled at, everyone was laughing the end.

Why do you keep zooming in and out constantly?

Getting a 19b single super kill in 2019  
---
better go ping my alliance and post to Reddit!!!!!!  
---
He's also not a bot, unless the bot specially stays in system when theres a neutral camping him
---
In my day, we only had boot.ini 
---
This generation of capsuleers are spoiled with your fancypants launchers
---
Should probably stay off Reddit when you don't know what you're talking about. 
---
At the smallest size one third of my window is a literal advertisement telling me to upgrade to Omega, another third is actual news item which will become an advertisement next SKIN release and the last third is my account section. 
---
That would require good UI/UX from CCP. 
---
It's a bot, the super was bumping the rocks for atleast half an hour. 
---
Players manage the stuck in the rock trick too.  First day with a carrier, i warped into the middle of a sanctum ring......
---
To be fair, I haven't seen a single gaming community that isn't ready to grab pitchforks and call for beheadings over the slightest issue.
---
if that's actually the case, then lol   
---
Death to bots
---
Man I miss that old launcher. Oh well...
---
Yep, we blapped and reported as a bot, hopefully he gets dealt with.

If I have 50b burning a hole in my pocket and its not already earmarked for something, I'd probably spin up a few SP farms with different utility(krabbing or something fun like booshers.)

Since it's eveonline.com, wouldn't that also make it impossible to log in?

have u considered not being fuckin autistic with 5+ accounts?
---
Was F2P around then?
---
Not trying to be rude, but I remember back before plex and whatnot and yeah, the launcher had no ads and was full screen with cool backgrounds. Then when EvE went F2P, shortly after we got a small launcher and some ads.
---
Which I don't *really* mind that much since a) I don't spend any time on the launcher unless I leave it on when I log off and turn the monitor off without closing it, and b) I play this game anyways so if I'm going to see an ad, at least it would be relevant to the program I'm opening.
---
From alliance side he is 
---
Same with WoW, FFXIV, and just about every other MMO I can think of that is still trying to survive.
---
That said, even with the fattest of wallets you can still lose in a 1v1 with a newer account if you don't know how to fly what you can afford.
---
Right after mercoxit excavators.
---
Depending on the jurisdiction, bird law might take precedent.
---
CCP advertises on their website:
---
EvE online, Sparc, EvE Valkyrie, EvE Gunjack, EvE Gunjack 2 'End of Shift'
---
Depends on what you mean with limited, I only play around 2-3 hours per week - and I'm having a blast!
---
Now that said, Eve has always been a game where you can't easily hop on for 10 minutes and be guaranteed some action (If you're into PVP like me) so keep that in mind and perhaps choose a group accordingly (Where there's plenty of things going on at all hours)
---
If you're more into PVE, then there's definitely no problems. Abyssals are great for short bursts of (relatively) fun PVE.
---
Depends on what you want to do and how hard you're willing to work towards what you want to do.
---
Why is some item lines in the market window gray and some white?
---
Even though they are in the same station
---
Anti-american or patriot? You decide
---
Ah my bad. I could have sworn there was a titan some where in hs
---
Why would anyone use a fraction myrm over a much cheaper vni?
---
&gt;It's a launcher
---
Yes, it is. And if it matters so little then why are they wasting resources on it? If it's worth spending resources on, it's worth *doing it right*. 
---
Huh? Loops for me.
---
That might be the most neckbeard thing I've ever read.
---
You're not at the fucking UN dude.

YEAH HOW DARE YOU HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS I DON'T CARE ABOUT, GET A LIFE LOL

I care

If we've already started our letters of outrage, is it ok to continue? I hate to waste good vitriol.
---
As long as it doesn’t delete boot.ini again it’s fine.

You used to be able to build caps in highsec, but you were never able to move them into highsec from low or null

---
Yes, there was a news-article about it last summer, sadly i forgot the name. But no word from the new producer himself. No introduction, no community interaction at all... if i remember correctly.
---
why do you hate their freedom?
---
&gt; I think the bean is just offering OP their first lesson in the "didn't want it anyway" / "already replaced" memes...
---
Or a first lesson in "don't trust anything you read on /r/eve".
---
Why the fuck did they even rework the launcher? Did anybody ask for this?
---
Perhaps it was a setting I changed before and never noticed? I changed it so it loops and now pepe is all better.
---
Thanks for encouraging me to be the change I want to see in the world. 
---
&lt;3 you too,  Emperor God Trump,  it's good that you're back in Amarr militia. 
---
grrrrrr
---
Could that be solved by better organization of a fleet/corp?
---
Maybe it's just me but it seems a bit absurd that to fly capital ships pretty much requires multiple accounts. Or could the issue be resolved with better planning for what you'd want to do in the future as a player?
---
Remember trying to quickly launch multiple accounts pre launcher? I do and it was shit.
---
Every game launcher has ads. Relax.
---
I don't.
---
I don't know what paint you are huffing.... but i want some.
---
&gt; this layout being essentially nonfunctional
---
As of 2/8/2019 @ 01:32 EST, there are 17,906 players online according to https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Perhaps the launcher functions just fine minus rare cases?
---
Now, go forth... And REEEEEEEE
---
That's adding new things. This was moving something from 1 place to another. Different thing. 
---
The list of accounts and play button are literally on the left of that screenshot 
---
Actually, it is. The folks that made this were programmers. 
---
Basically the exoplanets skin on any amarr ship.
---
Punisher, sigil, oracle specially so
---
Your fine m8. Just some salt being thrown your way because your CCP and some players seem upset that CCP is trying to make money to keep the game we all love online.
---
Now, if you could forward it to whoever... but if I'm already a paid account I'd appreciate not seeing an ad for buying an account. Perhaps make your ads ***AND*** NEWS/dev blogs/patch notes more relevant to the players account. Please and thank you.
---
I don't see any ads on my launcher, just 3 boxes - upgrade to omega, feb release, check our launcher
---
It's okay. Eventually you will get the ping to login. 
---
I agree, though I do understand at least 1 ad for SKINs or something from the New Eden store. Would make sense anyways.
---
You're right, I'm explaining to someone who has displayed very obviously throughout the comments that he:
---
1) Doesn't understand economics
---
2) Doesn't understand how logistical structures work
---
3) Doesn't understand the political blocs or their full members or affiliates
---
4) Doesn't understand how a pricing structure works  
---
Yet your stupid ass tried to give advice on those same very 4 topics. I'm not sure what makes you think I consider this the UN? Because I used uncommon words? It's kind of ironic if that's the case. You use uncommon words to be very, very incorrect. I'm just using them to tell you to stop parceling out incorrect and dumb advice.
---
Get back into your time machine and return to 2019.
---
how did it fail? your corp had such nice beer koozies 
---
Dreddit is recruiting 
---
Do you still need to get 3 stamps and signatories on your 'fam card' and mail it to the ACLU to get approved? 
---
That said, even if you have received "honorary blackness" from one of your black friends,  there is better, less sensitive things to use with them. "Brother from another mother", "Ma favorite chocolate chip crumble cookie" (if they cool with it), or just "Ma' man". I'd only really use it "Ma n-with-a-soft-a" if I received one first. 
---
Anyways, that's just my take on the "fair-use" clause of the word. 
---
can block the specific URL to the ad's (or rather the first bit that tends to always be the same and has nothing to do with the game)
---
[I will, promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N37lWmhFnO4).
---
I really love the models on the Talos and Brutix
---
what fucking ads are people bitching about? the "buy plex" and "eve tour tikets on sale now" ads?   
---
THOSE WHERE ON THE LAST LAUNCHER TOO MY DUDES 
---
goons
---
i love CCCP Charante, and STAR LORD SPONGEPANTS is a great name too 
---
retard, i'm not the op 
---
Pretty sure if I’m remembering right the launcher being used in revelations 2 had ads on it then too lmao, over a decade ago
---
Dude its the reddit outrage of the week. This too shall pass.
---
The only other way to determine that I figure is by looking at `/characters/{character_id}/skills/` and see if any skills have a `active_skill_level` lower than the `trained_skill_level`. 
---
It's less about the launcher itself, and more about the ideas behind the redesign.  CCPA is shifting ever more towards the cash grab mindset, and this "launcher" redesign is a perfect example.
---
They are also being less-than-truthful about many things, which shows complete disrespect for the playerbase.
---
Also, with the million things that need worked on, they choose to work on the stupid ass launcher *again*.
---
lowest hanging fruit tabs tbh, -1

TIL there are actually frogs that REEEE just like in Space Station 13.

Bot Lives Matter!

He obviously does. And you don't. Isn't that fine?

I'm 99% sure Capri was being sarcastic. I advocate for smaller groups on the whole, so my stance on this shouldn't be shocking to anyone that sees me posting.
---
Careful, you're going to get OP down here explaining to you why that's wrong because Goons own all the fuel and they'll cause the price to fall for goon members or something equally fucking retarded.
---
that's too much insults it sounds like someone was really mad when typing it out

Tupac cares.

Amarr ships are the prettiest and has all the laz0rz to fire.

"Ur dum"

You speak as if playing EVE is some basic human right, which it clearly isn't. CCP is under no obligation to allow everybody to play it.

in all honesty the jaguar is fucking broken rn, a brick tanked frig faster than a dramiel is absolutely stupid

Have you ever been to a mall? Or a strip where you probably get groceries? Any kind of private property has the right to do that.

YOu guys sound like whiny children with this thxccp ccpls shit. It's fucking embarassing
---
Is there any alpha ship below a battleship that can be used in most incursion fleets?
---
Citadels numbers are insanely bloated due to aoe and nearly every ship that dies on grid with one is logged whereas only a small fraction of ships killed on a pos were logged. Citadels are nowhere near as big of content drivers as old money moon poses
---
That's fair if you want to live that life. 
---
But should your tools be "so superior that you can't do anything". 
---
Is that a good state of balance? 
---
Ground-control to major tom
---
Thanks!

Thinking of rolling an alt or two to try out FW and get a little better at PvP.  What is the current culture within the different factions?  I'm usually playing at quieter times, so looking for something that has more of a late night USTZ or morning AUTZ presence.  I don't want to create the character and join a faction to later learn its filled with toxic people or bots, and as I have a main in sov null I don't want to join any groups that fuss with politics.  Thanks.
---
Personally I love the vexor, versatile damage with drones (although not too reliable) and good tank
---
I'd like to know this as well. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with availability or even the market filter you set up. 
---
Could be they're A/B testing... In my launcher there are 4 panels, one is ads, two are announcements about game changes, one is the charter list... My math could be off but that's 25% ads not 75%
---
No. Incursions are run with battleships, t2 cruiser logi with logistics V, and a booster only. Anything else would pop instantly or be worthless in DPS or logistics to help the fleet.
---
Goons run null incursions when they spawn in Delve and let alphas bring cheap cruisers but that's because they run with carriers and sometimes super carriers to carry the load on DPS and tank.
---
Thank you for kind words, the upvote, and most of all the "Grrr".
---
Whatever else happens in game, I hope you land on your feet.
---
I really don’t see how removing faxes is going to solve the problem, if it is a problem in the first place. Risk aversion happens at all levels of the game and not just with dreads or carriers. It is a part of human nature and can not be simply fixed by adding or removing types of ships. The trick is to lure your opponent to commit and then drop the hammer. That requires certain skills at the tactical level of leadership. Solving the aversion problem can not be solved really it needs to be countered with skills.
---
#F
---
The fact players are bitching about muh launcher when the game still has so many serious gameplay issues hurting player retention and the game's economy worries me.
---
Why do we need more of the same?
---
Got a link? I'm interested
---
There are a lot of songs, enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole.
---
i dunno , i just click and drag the corner and it rezises for me, same as the old launcher      
---
also people bitch about the plex ad... cmon guys that was on the old launcher too and all you do on the darn launcher is click the play/launch button and then you minimize the darn thing, its not like its giving you popups or playing a 30s video ad before launching the client     
---
The Phantasm and Nightmare
---
As much as i like the idea, i believe that no one would even consider this. Omist is a garbage region in the ass of the universe that has pretty much no value. Who would want to grind through the structures that are there(and there was quite a few)? its boring and kwg probably wouldnt even defend it. The Camper guy from BB camped Omist and feytha for 3-4 months and most of them are still there, At one point even horde was there trying to kill them i guess(There was something that Mac screwed over Gobbins over some faction citadels, and Gobbins allegedly said he was going to burn kwg down), but they gave up after two weeks. Besy thing would be if CCP would just ban those botting accounts, and empty that kwg wallet, but we all know how it works(or in this case how it doesnt work)
---
Tell us more as your alliance uses 3-4 titans to boson a talwar roam.
---
id prefer the music not to be a screecing loud guitar (yes it get it, muh freedoms) i like to hear comms instead 
---
Way too many cuts. If you want people to enjoy your ride either keep comms or comment but don't rapid switch characters during a video and hope music covers it.
---
I have stayed pretty quiet through all of this.. but I love the new launcher. 
---
Granted I only have three accounts and play on triple 34" monitors so the size isn't an issue. 
---
Maybe try the new launcher?
---
Broadsword... cause it’s scary for krabbing supers
---
Man. I hope one day youll look back at this post and realize what a cute newb u were. Fuck your idea. Its dumb. Gall BC's are amazing
---
1.  Brings 1b loki fleets into area.
---
2. Drop structures in area.
---
3. Defending force brings all force to bear
---
4. ?????
---
5. Profit? 
---
Then you are a retard.
---
there are way too few good people in eve
---
Meh I would say lick my bhaalgorn, but I guess everyone has different shapes....
---
i want real walking in stations

Plus when it goes well and many people survive, they suck your dick so hard. GIVE ME YOUR PRAISE \o/
---
Well, just sit on login instead.
---
Angry Pirate says Arrrrrggggg.
---
just ONE ? im sure there is atleast 50 you can call 
---
Only in EVE Online will you see a rant against requested changes to a launcher that ends with a reference to Martin Luther :-).
---
&gt; Well first off maybe I'm not on reddit all day like you. So bitching about me not replying right away just makes you sound like a massive socially inept neckbeard. 
---
My issue, as I clearly laid it out for you is that you do not care about arguments and instead of answering them all at one time, you chose to pick only one of them, then trying to pretend the others don't exist. You do it again this time in the hopes I let you got, but no - it's not about your timing, it's how you adress things. Because you don't.   
---
If you think that makes me a socially inept neckbeard, then you might want to browse up the topic of a "discussion" and how you usually handle things. Pretending you are offended while you try to sneak your way around certain points you don't want to adress, makes you a dishonest participant for a discussion.   
---
&gt;  Secondly getting kills solo/small gang is a lot harder than whatever the hell you're doing AFK krabbing and mining. 
---
Then maybe stop doing it solo? There are Empires worth hundreds/thousands of players that participate in alliance things on a regular base. Don't you think you sound a little bit (well, actually, extremely) entitled when  you suggest it should be anything else but HARD?   
---
You chose to go against an alliance that will cooperate against you.   
---
You chose to go the hardest route you could possibly go, 1: 10/100/1000/100000 and you complain it's hard? How about you stop putting yourself into exactly that situation on purpose then? Find a group that helps you hunting, makes things a lot easier. They grouped up into an alliance, you refuse to do so, you cry that they did that to make their space more comfortable and usable (because safety is a part of usable).   
---
Is your self-esteem really that low?  
---
&gt; Thirdly this isn't some kind of negotiation 
---
This is a discussion you've started to ask for, and please me correct me if I got that wrong, good reasons to keep local. You wanted opinions and I gave mine to you. You grabbed them up and started the discussion.   
---
A discussion is, by nature, a negotiation to find middle ground. So, please, don't pretend it is anything else. If you are interested in other people opinions then don't ask for them. if you aren't interested in a discussion, don't quote other people by picking up their points. If you are, however, interested in a discussion, then act like you are and stop being a child on temper tantrum when it's faced with conflicted oppinions and asked to fullfill your discussion-duty of being a honest participant that adresses arguments.   
---
&gt; Honestly if you're so afraid of combat because perfect intel local isn't there to hold your baby dick when you take a piss,  
---
I am not affraid of it, I just see problems that will make eve a less good game and all because some whiney cringelord can't kill stuff solo and refuses to be a socially capable person that just joins a group to make his life easier. You have all the tools in the game, you just refuse to use them.   
---
&gt; You have **all** the mechanical advantages being a krab in Eve: Local giving you perfect intel on who is where, citadels making it so you are safe in every system you krab, alliance only gates making it so you have pathways to avoid pipes where there could be camps, and lastly the super umbrella which has been proliferated to an insane extent. 
---
So, let's talk about "all the mechanical advantes in the game", shall we?   
---
\- You have 95%perfect intel on where to hunt, you know the systems, you know whos there and how active it is (Map intel) You also have it easy locating where the target is in the given system and warping to an anom is as hard for you as it is for the "krab".   
---
   
---
Also, you can use spy-characters for the missing 5% of perfect intel where the defender has no way to protect himself against.   
---
\- You can fit your ships towards PvP, where PvE'ers have to make commitments to make things work (well, maybe supers don't, which is irrelevant to you because solo killing supers isn't a thing anyway and you wouldn't even try)  
---
\- the defender needs to have infrastructure in place to gain his advantages, you don't. You also don't need to worry about keeping said infrastructure up.   
---
\- You always have the initiative - you chose when, who and how to engage whereas the defender can only react.  
---
\- You don't have to make commitments to your space by being there to defend it / pay for it / develop it - the supercap umbrella doesn't "magically" Exist, it's formed by tons of people (did I mention 10:1, 100:1, 1000:1?)  
---
But yeah, the defender "has them all", sure.   
---
Oh and btw: you still haven't adressed how you would balance out the loss of activity in space if your proposal would be implemtend. You also didn't adress the RISK:REWARD situation. Please do that now or stop participating in this, so far, fruitless discussion that you asked for.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/75027478/

Just saying, if you're a newish player this should be p. legit both as a way to learn pvp and for income.
---
I myself entered 3 abyss pockets yesterday in EU prime with noone showing up.
---
Go away.
---
Iteron has ridges for her pleasure, you fucking dog.
---
Not true. Armor Incursions allow sponges to use the VNI or Ishtar for ASs and HQs. The Talos also works.
---
I spent 2 years in FW and after you realize that you can't win against bots and farmers it just becomes a meaningless grind.
---
Yes and no. The VNI, Ishtar (omega) and Talos can be fit to tank ASs and HQs. But most Incursion communities only allow then as sponges since having a battleship on grid makes better site times.
---
It’s already quiet a few years old 
---
If its hi-sec ratting and mining then theres a tonne of corps out there that have communities.
---
If its null and pvp you want, join an alliance that has regular fleet action that will allow you access to decent space to support the income you need to run pvp.
---
You can create a support ticket and ask to have them removed, though it probably doesn't matter much if you have more than 5 million SP.

Hah I dont even pay for my sub most of the time 
---
I will give it a go, I have a spare Vaga hull in stock.
---
lol what in the actual fuck is going on in this video
---
Have you played this game? Eve doesnt work that way, there are no isolated fights. Maybe you die to the dude, then you and your friends set up a smartbomb trap. Or you see his expensive ship, fit up bait and your mates come in when hes committed.
---
No amount of money will make you come out victorious out of any Situation. And there are these kinds of games, especially in the mobile market. 
---
true, in fleet everyone can listen to their own stuff (or watch porn), but if you post a vid on reddit you are not the only one watching it 
---
Don't worry sgeine is used to having his ass kicked from corps/alliances. I'm actually surprised the toxic guy lasted as long as he did with you. 
---
I can have 50% of space in adds but i need at least 2 columns to list all my accounts. 
---
Is selling to Jita buy orders the best way for a solo explorer to offload relic/data site loot? or should i try to make sell orders for all of those different loots/components?
---
It is not about those ads but about fact that account list have 25% space on it at most ........ i need to now scroll the damn account list.          
---
Give us 2-3 columns, keep the ads but let the launcher be usable. 
---
Good read. Thanks for sharing
---
Also upon seeing the new launcher as long as you're not a cancerous octoboxer you only see two squares if you just resize the window. People bitching too hard.
---
Not sure what fleets those are but I don’t imagine their isk/hour rate to be what makes incursions worth doing. 
---
Warp to Me and TVP are both shield and are battleship and t2 logi only. 
---
And TDF is armour and also battleships and Nestor’s in their case. 
---
I’m sure some of those ships can survive but the DPS hit over having a full fleet of vindicators and paladins is going to be brutal. 
---
There's some pretty active high-sec based corps that do things like Incursions, FOB, Abyssal. Mostly they also mine (moon mining for example, for a high-sec player pretty OK income). For PVP, they dive into low-sec, null-sec, DED sites, black-ops. 
---
Pro tip: Check the [evewho.com](https://evewho.com) 7-days growing corporations list and contact those corps. 
---
Geminate is amazing for just random content. Being that close to Jita has its benefits. :D
---
It's intended to make receiving side overwhelmed and dominated. Long and salty answer expected.
---
I need 2 columns on this layout to display my accounts.          
---
Sorry but i am annoyed as hell - like i did make the launcher fullscreen ........ and instead bit more space on account list i got few more columns of old news. 
---
oh man look up Sindel Pellion.
---
The true answer
---
If there is a decent margin between sell and buy order price, I put a sell order between the two price and it generally goes pretty fast. If you want to min/max your isk, your put sell order and play the 0.01 game. But you shouldn't, honestly.
---
this is like the 13th launcher they've developed, obviously they have a dev team with 8 people on it developing launchers so it's not that hard to request one that's not dogshit that forgets your hundreds of accounts every patch day and that doesn't tank my cpu when it's open
---
Low end mining gives very little revenue, doesn't teach you to use your ship in combat situation and is very low effort / afkable. If you have just started and already want to afk as much as possible, than why would you play at all? 
---
Yeah, the launcher just launches the game from the launcher when the launcher is launched. I dont have issues with ads when I launch my launcher to launch my game. Launcher.
---
The hilarious part is that it's basically the same launcher with the same number of ad, news, and upcoming features 'ads'. The only thing that's different is they broke up the slideshow box into three sections.  
---
Good use of a Martin Luther reference.
---
Keep posting kid, someday you'll be as cool as me.
---
... do they.. do they want their targets to be.. .  
---
Dead...   
---

---

---
Is it normal for CCP to post smart-ass replies? If so, I think I'll have to pay for a few more months of Omega.
---
Did we just discovered a way to break bots?   
---
Make ANOMS HAVE MORE ROCKS?! that have a size which must be visually spotted?..   
---
Interesting. Not much mention of No Vacancies, despite having fewer total pilots than most other corps mentioned.
---
It depends really. Selling to buy orders is instant and hassle free. Setting up sell orders is only worth it if the difference from buy orders covers the extra sales tax. Fulfilling buy orders only incurs a broker's fee(?) of 2% for NPC stations, while sell orders also get another tax for 3%, reduced by faction standings. Now you need to see if your extra profit is actually significant, and also consider if you have the time to maintain your orders. Or you can just fire and forget if you aren't urgently in need of cash.
---
Well, big advantage of this design is skipping the character selection screen. As with the ESI, the character is more important than the account nowadays. So for launching, I'd actually want to launch the character instead of the account. 
---
Why oh why CCP are you inconsistent with your own goal of "character first" like the ESI? 
---
I like the feature to log in multiple accounts.. Now cloaky campers cant complain they only use input broadcasting just to log in their accs.. 
---
Deppends haul tanked and then armour repper fits goin on. Look at zkill for the bnis
---
Oh, I didn´t mean you in person but I didn´t make that clear either. 
---
It was more a general  response and fitted into the stuff capri said. 
---
*grabs pitchfork*
---
Ever done a red light district?
---
TDF has DNI, VNI, Ishtar and Talos Sponges. They get dropped from fleet if someone comes along with a normal doctrine ship, but they are allowed on grid.
---
I also saw Drakes in WTM Fleets when contesting them.
---
Spinning in space
---
Master spinning 
---
I actually hadn't noticed this, but yeah why the hell is 3/4 of the launcher screen taken up for what are not my accounts? wtf CCP :/
---
any titan, hear me out. There is just​ something satisfying about ~~busting my load all over~~ Bosoning a roaming gang or a rorqual refusing to mine ochre.

I don't think CCP want me to have less accounts.

Also they are not all omega - most of the times -  also i need 3 accounts to have cynochain from stain.

Uhhh how do you resize stuff?

What are the uses for a Phoenix?  Im currently training into one because I've been wanting to be it since I've found out about big ass missiles

Old launcher actually had the potential to be worse (sometimes was) due to the notification pop up window (the best ship is friendship)

Advanced Spaceship Spinning 5 right there

Not sure.
---
Not many people use Marauders since they run you about as much ISK as a cheap dread after insurance.
---
Killed a couple paladins in a site a week ago or so, I guess those work.

SFI in the dual armor repping version ... never will forget all these fights i had in it!

oh oh spaghettio

Paladins look quite popular https://zkillboard.com/group/900/w-space/losses
---
Exactly, my respect for JavaScript people is even lower than for the AppMonkeys. It would be better to use that money on proper code monkeys and not this shit but then CCP is known for burning money.

Nope, the word is loose, like in foot loose. This is not the right place for it but still, your wrong.

&gt; Warning: Incoming damage can be high. Triple Stasis Towers can nullify ship velocity to critical levels. Recommend over 85% resists to Explosive damage.
---
Last room can kill you if you can't shoot the web towers from the landing point.
---
I did just this in a mediocre fitted raven.
---
lmao salty
---
Still better than Horde SRP....
---
hows it going racist boi
---
But what about AUTZ :( sad for dayz (I guess there's siege green but do they even have an English speaking corp?) 
---
yes, i've red that statement, and i'm a bit concerned, because just few days ago i got wrecked with my hurricane because of a damn scrambler frigate.
---
That would be dope too, 😁
---
It all depends on the effects of WH you're living in and the anoms that spawn there, but generally speaking it was Paladin &gt; Vargu &gt; Golem &gt; Kronos last I checked. The Paladin is better than the Vargur due to its projection and base cap pool/regen.
---
Eeeh, goons formed and killed it. Test was there. Blue balls for all. 
---
KWG was merely downsizing the amount of space they rent from us - they were fully cooperative\* in transfering Feyth, and will continue to rent Omist.
---
Test would in all likelyhood defend them in Omist (assuming they actually pay their rent), if only because space controlled by a hostile entity makes for a fairly bad money maker.
---
((\* Three of their subrenters took the opportunity to fashion themselves as stronk independent nullsec powers who don't need to pay rent to anyone, but that went about as well for them as anyone would expect.))
---
I'm sorry to have to tell this to you but you've got your narratives, the stories you tell yourself and your buddies to justify your bitterness, all mixed up...
---
Distance of these towers from warpin varies slightly, 50-55 km. I don't have experience with battleships and large guns - if Fusion range is shorter than that, preload some longer range ammo.
---
If you sort the overview by type, this helps to lock all 3 of them quickly. 
---
About your fitting: It's incredibly cheap to "bling" your explosive hardener. Even Pith X-Type is only ~4M, C-type is cheaper than T2. Replace the kinetic hardener with an adaptive invul field if possible - Angels also do some EM and TH damage, and your resistences are very low there. If this doesn't fit, use an EM hardener and an Anti-Thermal rig. The base resistance to kinetic is much better already, incoming KIN-damage will not be a huge issue.
---
    Thank for you time and consideration of my thought    
---
Krabs don't think right; Myrm, Brutix and the frankly amazing Navy Brutix are PVP ships, get your stinking claws off them
---
Wow are these the ads that people have been moaning about? Ok now I'm really confused.
---
Assuming a C5 No Effect, Red Giant, or Magnetar: Paladin &gt; Golem &gt; Vargur
---
Assuming a C5 Cataclysmic Variable: None, you get penalties to local tank. You're better off using two spider-tanking Nestors, but you want solo stuff so just avoid those.
---
Assuming a C5 Pulsar or Black Hole: Golem &gt; Vargur 
---
Assuming a C5 Wolf Rayette: None, don't krab with a marauder in a C5 WR unless you wanna get megadunked by 3 confessors
---
Assuming a C4 No Effect, Red Giant, Magnetar, Pulsar, or Black Hole: Golem
---
Avoid other C4 effects. The Golem is better overall; the Paladin works in everything except Pulsar (Except for very specialized and expensive fits). This is because the rats spawn far from each other and you want to cover 100km+ of applicable damage. 
---
Avoid running C3 and C2 sites in Marauders, you'll get better bang for your buck in a Gila or a Rattlesnake.
---
https://github.com/LavishSoftware/ISBoxerEVELauncher
---
ISBoxer Launcher works extremely well, has some nice command line switches for launching specific characters/groups of characters as well.  You still need to use the official launcher to download updates but you can use the Lavishsoft one for 99.99% of the time.
---
Its free and doesn't require an innerspace/ISBoxer subscription.
---
Put an MJD on your battleship, that way you always have a get out of jail free card.
---
Cheap fit: https://zkillboard.com/kill/72062376/
---
If 10k goons would make a proposel, ccp would listen for sure... Goon Stellar Managment would also help there...
---
It seems ok, once you resize it. 
---
I would like to see them add valkryie to the launcher, might get some people playing it then.
---
Solo Marauders are shit ever since they "fixed" the RR a couple years ago, even Garrisons with the lowest RR are a pain, 2 RR Leshaks can do sites pretty well, tinker Rattles or RR Nestor duos are the standard tho.
---
If you are actually talking highclass, use a cheap Rattle (c4) or Praxis for lower class stuff (&lt;c3).
---
Shut the fuck up.

Field extenders and active tank don't really mix
---
No
---
Welcome to r/eve

[Really makes you...](https://media1.tenor.com/images/013853f0dbc7176cf59d70858959d575/tenor.gif?itemid=8301037)
---
Okay.
---
so you are responsible for CCP's budget shortfall leading to the incomplete stain gate implementation?
---
What else is there? 
---
That was my great grandmother's frigate :'(
---
❤️
---
This was reported multiple times in here - so ccp is well aware about it.        
---
Quite probably the changes to launchers and making harder to use third party launchers relates to this as you can launch multiple alpha accounts when you login the chars at the same time.
---
and the poor get poorer :(
---
❤️ they came out better than I expected 
---
Lol the only alliance there is to their wallets. Put any kind of pressure in any renter space and it will crumble I guarantee it.
---
Marauder are too expensives for the job but they are still the best options if you have only one account for C5 and cannot pilote a dread.
---
As soldier said, rattle for C4 (but site can be a pain du too the spawn), Praxis is good for C3, gila works too (full passive) and it's good for C2.
---
Are you a CCP employee? 
---
I get out of the training clone to play. Login, jump into empty clone. Jump into training clone just before logout. 80-90% of the benefit for 10% of the effort.
---
Generally bug reports get responses only if they want more details from you.
---
give that man some gold ! 
---
Rancer
---
Hey coblat edge is where HK builds titans 
---
This was my favourite part of every patch, seeing the new animations/music
---
Yeah. But the launcher doesn't restrict it at all. Although it might limit 3rd party ones, the default launcher can launch as many alpha accounts, is just logging in characters that's a problem.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Cut back on the independent thought and speech will you? You'll attract the attention of the hive mind.
---
Along the same lines as a VNI the rattlesnake my dude. Drone boat with missiles. Not the best but it will do the job. 
---
"Mimimimimim I can't use my botting program anymore."
---
I love these kind of complains.
---
Thx for the tears CCP
---
Oh god, dictionary quoting. 
---
Lord help me.
---
Yeah, 40 man fleet to make 90 to 120m an hour or solo carrier rating bringing in 150 easy, double that with a super. 
---
Ha!
---
I can now suffer through the non-EvE version that  my missus and daugther play all the damn time because all I'll hear are these lyrics!
---
Algos in my opinion is one of the deadliest destroyers out there.
---
SpectreFleet!
---
Thing is you cannot make the window width smaller than 900 pixels (as i mentioned in the main post, mind you!). That's the point of this. To not be forcefed ads
---
Lol with warp scrams silly, arazu with fleet bluffs, scripted HIC points with fleet boosts.
---
I was going to say the tristan myself. I don't use it for PvP, but it's *silly* good for PvE - after some advice from redditors, I fit one up for shields with an afterburner, and was *awed* by its crazy sig tanking power.
---
As long as it doesn't run into spider drones (web drones. Will stop it *dead* and are hard to kill!) it can pretty much sig tank all day long at arms length while beating on things with a combination of drones and hybrids.
---
You don't even need good skills to use this thing effectively - if you can fly five light drones and use basic tech 1 hybrids, you can get a ship+fit that for about 2 million will get the job done. It only gets better with better skills, too.
---
I've notably chased down and killed diamond rat frigates that had killed a friendly vexor using one of these cheap fits. It was hard, but the ship can do it.
---
In my opinion, even if you don't want to fly it *this* way, you ought to try kitting one out and flying it. It's an incredibly flexible ship and can do some crazy things while being quite light on the budget.
---
He was caught in a sting operation
---
I.E The fact that we was arrested means that he is without a doubt guilty
---
At least the poor can do incursions...
---
How are you supposed to 360 no scope if you're not doing the 360?
---
I switched with 1x capacitor safeguard and 1x operational solidifier
---
I can imagine, I would never be able to multitask that :P.
---
I would also rather have 4-5 friends to do the above with, than 800 APM :P.
---
Thats been fun. We stumbled into the fight, when we were around in this area. GF everyone :)
---
Me too!

I already upvoted this comment twice. That's all your getting.
---
There's no scramming frigates. Align out in the last room and stick to that alignment until all web towers are down. Buy the good explo hardeners. Not only are they better by default, they overheat for longer. I'd also replace the power relays with power diagnostic systems. The power relays give more cap, but have a penalty on shield boost amount. Ungroup the guns when shooting frigates to avoid overkill.

All i can think of is this scene
---
if you are in the WH. where the structure is you can just eject it to space. just like asset safety IIRC
---
Let me join the pack here.
---
Although I will be in between Stabber/SFI/Vagabond anf Cynabal most of the times.
---
damn boy, you are stupid
---
For PVE or PVP?
---
Superb thread &lt;3
---
okay, how?
---
23 opt + 42 falloff, I hope I'm in range for the sentries.
---
I switched the kinetic with an adaptive inv field, and i'll try to "bling" explosive deflection with the gist c-type.
---
thank you for the advices mate!
---
just take a dread
---
Every time I see this video and hear the song, I remember the first comment saying it was a capsuleers last song and got sad and happy at the same time. 
---
As a hauler who has been *chased* by one - out of all the encounters I've had in eve where I got away *with* my ship, that is the sole one where it came down to *pure luck.* Every warp I made, he landed before I got there and was ripping holes in me as I tried to warp off. If I hadn't gotten lucky when I warped to the npc dock at 0, I would have been just plain dead.
---
I'm a slippery bastard, cloak+mwd with stabs and tank - doesn't matter. The cynabal is terrifyingly fast at warp and I literally *can't* run from it.
---
It was a joke. 
---
I'm a bit of a n00b here so pardon the question, but what is the issue with easily launching multiple alpha accounts? Like, if the user has paid for those accounts, why couldn't or shouldn't they easily open them all?
---
welcome to the club 
---
Most people only have 1-2 accounts. 
---
I subbed two for like 3 years after having one account for one. 
---
Now i've just resubbed one and am continuing to play. Annoying though, having to train all my drone skills again on my non-drone char.
---
you could do that before? there was a toggleswitch on the left side next to the name that you could flick on and off and it would select those clients for launching
---

When he starts getting into magical crystals with healing properties, or herbalife, than we have some serious problems on our hands.
---
i used to run these w/ a blaster MOA and some drones, worked very well imo 
---
you clearly havent read the numerus posts about a certain gate to a certain region 
---
I see, thanks for reaction. So far, i am having fun, so i will definitely continue playing. 
---
And if (when) i meet something that would break my enthusiasm too much, well there are thousands of other games to play. :)
---
Oh really? Never noticed.. 
---
Yeah sry had bad connections 😞
---
God, I keep looping the melody around “planet six”.  Don’t know what’s with it, but it feels so right.
---
dont pay a dude till you get stuff delivered   
---
also paying isk for IRL stuff is bad, ccp dont like that 
---
I've been zooming in and out for 15 years. It's what you do when you don't do maneuvers, sometimes. :P
---
No gui visual update is supposed to be intuitive after it changes lol, because you just got used to the prior while it might actually be more intuitive for people starting to use it which matters more
---
F1
---
They might not understand you, and you might not understand them - but both of you I suspect understand the language of pew pew.
---
Now you may sleep smugly knowing how much they’re missing out on.
---
Thx i will try this ;=) Yeah it as AB bonus and a tracking bonus to kill the siren so why not ;)
---
I've done it yesterday in a bs. Mine was a maelstrom and I have omega and fairly good skills. I would be wary of trying the last room without a jumpdrive. The dps is really high and with the stasis towers you're not really going anywhere regardless of if you use an AB or not.
---
If you can't afford to lose the bs just yet it might be better just selling the eacalations
---
Because Alpha means it has NOT been paid for that month.
---
because user has not paid for alpha accounts.
---
its omega accounts that are paid for.
---
Its also not allowed to run other eve accounts at the same time as you run an alpha account. (aka you are not allowed to multibox with an alpha account running)
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
I have omega state and want to gain ISK so i can buy ships when i have the skills, what is the best way to gain ISK? is it worth to build the ship or is it better to simply buy it?
---
I usually play zoomed right out to a point I can’t see my own ship, I dislike this idea :p 
---
Right. There's ways to get stuff like this out. Flying it unfitted while active players are ready to kill you isn't one of them.
---
You are essentially getting to about 2600m/s (+3000m/s Overheated so train thermodynamics to V)  with your normal sig radius. You might not have a lot of DPS (I think you somehow can squeeze 400 out of it) but you don't need that. Remember to buy faction shield extenders to keep your sig as low as possible. Optionally you could slap a tracking Rig in there or a tracking computer in you mids. Be careful tho as that fit will rely on speed tanking so you need to watch the transversals all the time. You want to keep them as high as possible! If you get too much DMG you should just warp off. Additionally the cap is very very tight and I still need to figure out a good way to deal with that.
---
You should have an option to use hardware encoding for almost no performance loss. I think it's called VCE for amd?
---
You can use it to record in OBS
---
Nearly every other game has locked content through dlcs. Should ccp now make more systems that are only accessible if you buy an additional dlc?
---
It's really not the ads themselves that are the problem, they just take to much space. If you could at least Center the accounts would make it so much better. 
---
&gt;numbering some 14- 17 million people. 
---
25 million died in Russia alone,  it's way higher than that. 
---
Someone have baba z’s starships?
---
He was there for over twenty minutes for reference
---
I think Google is still in business.  The in-game browser was an early version of Chromium used to put a web view in a window.  It was removed because Chromium's API changed really rapidly in the early releases and it was going to be like starting from scratch to update the engine, plus without doing so we didn't have the benefit of any of their later (and increasingly necessary) security updates.
---
5/10 have strong webs, but they don't have scrams in there. The incoming dps is pretty high, but you can warp out at any moment. 
---
Honestly just habit to see where my fleet is. Trying to break the habit as I started noticing when I started recording stuff
---
I resent change. Stop changing my game. :(
---
Yea his other went to the pos instantly. Several of us reported him till ccp so a man can dream.... maybe he gets banned 
---
And permission to use his ship. 
---
&gt; blaster MOA
---
a cruiser?!
---
Just do yourself a favor and stop being a pussy. Life will get easier. I promise. 
---
Over the past 13 years I have had dozens of 1v1 encounters that do not end in a blob.  
---
that means youre the spy
---
Noted, I can turn it down a bit in the future. Didn't seem too bad when i listened to it. But i have 2x kids screeching most the time as well. 
---
&gt; can block the specific URL to the ad's
---
No, you cannot. The HOSTS file just over-writes DNS results for a particular domain search.
---
Ohh i did not know that. We had some op with them lately which where huge fun. They seem to be a bunch of good Nerds.
---
Nonetheless i stick to my Suggestion but it will not harm you to just ask them directly 
---
Everyone talking about the Launcher when I wanted a Blaster :(
---
I do 5/10's pretty often. Last room I accelerate gate in, drop bookmark, align out to something, launch drones to kill the stasis towers. I make sure I have at least 60km drone range control, which means a DLA in my Gila. I use 2 "spare" drones, 2 hammerhads and as soon as the stasis towers are down I recall them and launch specific drones for the site. Kill overseer and done.
---
I got pinged about him at 0030 I think. He died almost 45 minutes later. Never moved from his spot. More a post showing a bot than who cares about a super 
---
Cruisers can evade damage by being mobile. Once web towers and frigates are dealt with, NPC battleships have a harder job hitting a cruiser that's using an afterburner.
---
Ahhh okay. I got the two confused. Thanks for the info. Makes sense now!
---
Abyssal pvp!
---
but it looks bad make it go away
---
You seem awfully buttmad over what someone else doesn't like.
---
yea, never had any issues, had more problems of those bloddy battleships chewing on my drones than my Moa , just blast the towers first, then do close range orbits of battleships to blast em while drones shred the small shit 
---
Why are you talking so ill of your valued allies
---
they got evicted, thats what happend   
---
they might be on the down low while reforming and rehoming stuff, who knows 
---
Just Buy a carrier :4Head: they aren't even that expensive.

---
&gt;So you do realize that publicly discussing bans is a reason for a perma ban from CCP as stated in their EULA.  
---
&gt;Also the way you are commenting and getting "revenge" for your ban by botting, that tells me you should just stay away from the game and that CCP didn't make a mistake by refusing you to play.
---
?
---
I rolled into rage last weekend and there was only a few structures with 0 players in them, so I think theyre pretty dead now.
---
They are wormholers. They are super active. You don't see them, nor hear anything from them? Then they're doing it right.
---
Because highly sped up zoomed out fleet fights are not fun to watch. 
---
I'll second that. awesome looking ship. I wish they would make it at least &lt;2 sec align time or something.
---
was the old launcher "broken" in some way? what caused them to "fix" it? it's broken now just like the chat system...
---
That was an awesome read! The bots suck, but I’m weird and still like killing them for their corpses...and I have a fair idea who the ones I hunt belong to. 
---
FW needs so much love, but it’s still a great part of the game, lowsec in general is p badass at the moment. 
---
That or Gneiss which can be found in some .5 systems at moon mining setups.  Keep in mind you will need to scout it out as the valuable ores get mined out fast.  Check out CAS Mining Alliance channel for info on mining boosts and moon mining locations.
---
I just added all the specific domains to my pihole. This way the launcher can start but the ads are ficken up and simply won't show. Quick and dirty.
---
Had to search for the domains via my firewall logs.
---
I want to start this game but my friend wants to join the Test alliance corp! How do i convince him to join a corp like pandemic horde? I saw someone say they joined it on steam and it's just a beginner one. He was in a fraternity one but he leaked some invasion on Hard Knocks Associate and ran from them! So how do i convince a .. decent ish pay to win player to like! come on down to the beginnings 
---
Small gangs ahould stop trying to engage rorquals and mysterious capitals wont appear to ruin your "fun" lol , fam.
---
Loki, and sabre definitely, maybe a boosher - you can have a ton of fun flying some of the more specialised ships in a fleet. 
---
The prot isn’t in a great place right now. 
---
yea i think they are p active atm, i thought they just moved into low class wh's now
---
&gt;Also this comment:
---
i believe we can take them down. they deserve it
---
&gt;You seriously expect the players help you take down the company that created and maintains the game they play?  
---
&gt;The way you are commenting and getting "revenge" for your ban by botting, that tells me you should just stay away from the game and that CCP didn't make a mistake by banning you.  
---
&gt;Really just go cry somewhere else, it is becoming obvious to me that you were in the wrong and are now looking for something to justify what you did.
---
I have not read it yet but these comments have made me consider that someday I should.
---
Hurricanes is even better. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdMKJpA0pg
---
...hundreds of accounts? Really man?
---
Hey guys I'm from the future, all is great, I love playing eve on my surround screen setup, the ads aren't a problem, you just need to watch them or [*redacted*](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-blHWZvtavd0/VNfkxOWV-JI/AAAAAAAAA0s/e7YrfLXavdE/s1600/BlackMirror1x02_1077.jpg) you even get a little bit of ISK in your wallet for watching those ads, it's wonderful!
---
CCP needs to pay heed to those 27 boxers and their army of accounts, or their ads will be meaningless.  They are the only ones holding up the perception that actual people still play this game.
---
Not pissing away money on stupid Hilmar mobile games and $10,000 toilet seats would be less irritating than ad space tbh
---
The eve time being displayed would really help me out if they could just add that back in....
---
&gt; Be sure to scout the gate and never warp blind from gate-to-gate in case there are smartbombers waiting.
---
How does one scout a gate before having gone through it?
---
Oh! I remember hearing this song as the opening to one of the Mindclash Podcast's episodes. I kinda wish that was still a thing, podcasts from small Eve entities. I suppose Eve is already kind of small though 
---
Did you have a stroke typing that?  Anyway I'm impressed that you obviously found enough time without mittens dick in your mouth to formulate a whole sentence.
---
launch drones, let them orbit you, approach 1 drone ...
---
I concur.
---
Of course thats absolutely possible. My point was that there is no amount of money you can throw at the game to always be victorious, which is the very definition of pay to win.
---
In eve you cannot be unbeatable.
---
They moved into a different wormhole and go on roams through nullsec. 
---
I don't believe it's against the TOS to launch the accounts though, just log the alphas in 
---
But this minor change to a screen I spend .5 seconds looking at before launching the game is more geared towards them making money than my visual appeal!!  HOW DARE THEY
---
This!
---
And pls, for the love of god CCP, remodell the balckhole completly. It's like a giant pulsating butthole. In 2019 we've already have some visual simulations, on how it would look like.
---
&gt; Don't download 3rd party tools to resize it.
---
Why should I not make it better for me?
---
&gt; Don't write up 6,000 word Reddit posts about what you really think CCP should do with the launcher.
---
How else would I tell them i'm unhappy with their shit decision making?
---
&gt; Do you really want them to be using dev cycles (and yes, many teams would be involved in reworking the launcher) to rework the launcher instead of other shit they could be improving? No? 
---
I' rather they got it right in the first place but we know that's never been CCP's style.
---
&gt; Then you're just whining so everyone knows you're upset.
---
Pot, kettle...
---
I say we organize protests to show them they really messed up this time.
---
/s
---
He probably just went to get a drink or take a break after ratting nonstop for the last 23 hours 
---
So I guess the irony of you crying about him crying escapes you too
---
Thread Hijack: Would people be interested in a gif related to RAGE eviction? Similar style as [this](https://gfycat.com/BarrenTightHoatzin) or [that](https://imgur.com/uuf9Mh7). Asking because I would be pretty late to the party.
---
I see news, some articles related to the game and some promo for in-game stuff. They´re not really ads and by the way, you can resize the launcher. 
---
Can we stop this, please. 
---
Generally speaking it's best to buy the ship because it takes a long time to train all the skills and acquire all the materials (or ISK to buy said materials) to build the ship.
---
As for making ISK, there are a ton of guides out there but exploration seems to be pretty popular for making steady income. Don't bother mining. In high-sec I ran missions up to level 3 and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Definitively try exploration though. There's a ton of guides on YouTube and elsewhere.
---
First you dip your head in gasoline. 
---
Next, lite it on fire.
---
Finally, put the fire out with a brick.
---
Is that the new "Brisc" emoji in your flair ? Ist it already on Nitro?
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate rental mails and pocket it to their wallet before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
You would do more damage with Depleted Uranium or Titanium at this range. Tracking bonus also helps against frigates, so I would load DU before taking the gate to the 3rd room, kill the towers and a few frigates, stop firing with 1 shot left and reload to Fusion.
---
Super ratting with their alts in drone lands?
---
Ya basicly this. They are just rebuilding in cobalt edge
---
Kronos first cuz you got a wee-woo skin.
---
What did you use for level 3 missions? I have a Stabber right now that I cruised through the level 2 missions with but I don't know if it will be strong enough.

I'd be positive and hopeful for this as well, but this is CCP we are talking about. I'm sure they'll find a way to fuck it up.

65 km optimal so i can warp to 50 to cyno, 153m signature so it s less than 160 (radius of missile of the fighter), 3k kms to mitigate dps from fighter without heat, 47k ehp without heat, so i think i can manage to gtfo if i m disrupt by a citadell that launch also fighter on me.
---
there are patches almost every day lately...
---
so since you need to open the launcher, then just use the launcher...
---
I used the Amarr Cruiser called the Maller. I also used some drones so that helped. I *really* like my drones. They help a LOT.
---
Currently I'm using a Gallente drone boat called the Vexer. Specifically the Navy Issue. I can post a fit later if you're interested.
---
Ya but its like one of those things litterally no one gives a fuck about unless its being used to bot. The double alpha is more of a faith in your players not to do that.
---
This is clearly a bait thread by an idiot. For anyone who is actually curious about HK: 
---
They live in a C2 with null+C6 statics and they seem to be having a lot of fun. 
---
dont know if troll or a dummy?
---
" against a single alliance(INIT.)???"
---
Seems like someone dont know what happened really or he just cant get over it that no one is talking anymore about this.
---
I think you went too deep.
---
Depends where you live. Most of the Western countries have a law that disallow shop owners to refuse Customer for no or dumb reasons
---
Today I will play EVE
---
(Clueless)
---
Oh god oh fuck I have to readd all my accounts
---
Gila is my favorite to look at and fly. So much so that I look forward to each new event simply because the odds of a Gila being the ideal ship for it are usually quite good.
---
I also have a fondness for the VNI just because of how simple and effective it is. I actually dislike the afk aspect of it because I think it would be more fun to actually fly the damn thing than to just "set it and forget it". But it's hard to argue how efficient it is for afk ratting.
---
I haven't settled on a favorite PvP ship yet as I switch up quite often.
---
But as soon as they allowed you to play, they cannot prevent you to continue playing for no reason whatsoever.
---
This is the same thing as a service contract, you pay for a service, you cannot be denied this service unless you break a rule, and then this rule has to be valid enough to not break any law in the country you are using the service from.
---
Hi brisc. How's DC. 
---
Large Core Defense Field Extender I are the wrong rigs if you go for an active tank.
---
Kinetic Deflection Field I and  Explosive Deflection Field I should at least be changed to the meta versions (Limited Kinetic Defl... and so on). But the X-tye gist are also relatively cheap - especially the explosive. So really consider to use them: Gist X-Type Explosive Deflection Field
---
 500MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive should be changed to 500MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive. It gives you more overall cap for shield boosts. Because I assume you'll use more cap for that then the MWD which you would pulse.  
---
Above is general fitting advise as I don't know the site. Probably you should better use an MJD as some already mentioned. If you are in trouble you MJD away and warp off + good for sniping with artilleries. I don't know the site though so not soo sure if it's advisable.
---
You are confusing publisher actions and actual law.
---
Easy example, I play Eve. One day, CCP says "let's ban this guy 'cause I dont like his Nyx fit".
---
They can terminate my account, I can sue them for that.
---
That's why nobody does that.
---
Thanks &lt;3 i saw too that exploration was the best but wanted some confirmation as all the videos are more than a year old.
---
 Simple answer no they don't read shit except reddit for drama
---
Who knew. A computer game company wanting to make money. DISGUSTING!!!
---
 You already pay a monthly sub unlike most games
---
No we don't believe it, but debating is fun.
---
On your point, you are mistaken. Any service provided, even over the internet, to any specific country must abide by the country law. You would still have to get your ass to Iceland to sue them, sure.
---
It's the same regarding EU GDPR law, a lot of websites, services &amp; such closed their doors to EU citizen because else they would have to conform to this law.
---
People complaining about the launcher have nothing else to really do as part of the sad miserable day to day life they life. STFU and just enjoy the game
---
This is the first I'm personally hearing of all the supposed noise the launcher update is creating. Me myself, I like it. But I don't multibox the shit out of Eve.
---
I'm a coder too, and personally quite admire all the efforts CCP puts into the design and development of their frontends. Just wondering, since I don't have that many accounts compared to many here, is the launcher UI not very responsive? Is that the overall complaint?
---
Cringe.
---
Most common misconception, not even only on the internet.
---
What is written in a TOS/EULA does not have force of law. These are rules made by the publisher, and the publisher can enforce it, as long as it doesn't break any law. Removing access to Eve online to someone for no reason is ground enough to be able to go to court, as you would do for any service contract broken by the provider for no reason.
---
This has already been judged many times.
---
The same thing applies to any rule stating that the publisher has the right to look at anything on your computer, your memory, running processes, etc.. They don't hold any right to do that, they are still doing it, but they cannot use the excuse "I read your process and have seen EveOnlineCheatVeldspar.exe, so I ban you'.  
---
They will just said you cheated and that's the end of it.
---
If only they had tossed their shit on the pile. What they did was go "hey, my shit deserves a pile of its own!" and now there are piles of shit everywhere.
---
Unless we consider all of /r/eve a single pile of shit, which to be fair is not too far from the truth.
---
Agreed.
---
This is just theoretically speaking, nobody here is dumb enough to think he has been banned for no reason. CCP is smart enough to cancel any punitive action if they find they got the wrong guy.
---
i am safelogged with all toons/assets in rage on old keepstar undock
---
&gt; full screen with cool background
---
was the bestest screensaver with cool ambient sounds ever
---
miss it :-(
---
Ah yes, CCP should spend countless manhours supporting third parties instead of improving their product.
---
Hmm, exefile direct link for every Account on Desktop for dedicated launch, batchfile for consolidated. Not rocket science. 
---
But yes the new launcher was not really bad, especially the bind option for Acc-Settings.
---
how good could the coms be? Take bridge, shoot thing, let's go home.
---
I know you are one of the better ceptor pilots and i will get a bunch of down votes for this but...
---
really? you show a ferox vs ferox fight and post on reddit about it while sitting at a perch 80% of the fight? I mean ur fullfilled your role and ok you drive by scramed the fc after the fight was won already but still...meh
---
THIS  &lt;3 
---
So, Init. is still salty about evicting HK?
---
Also if you have the money and will be using it in low then buy a Snake set and Laser DMG Implant and Cap Implant
---
Having never played this game, is it worth picking up in 2019? 
---
Init are no longer wormhole gamers. They were dethroned by the wormhole saviors called init. They recently moved to a c2 with a ns static(basically nullbeccers now)
---
My spies tell me that they are being forced to pay rent to tdsin to maintain their farmholes. Spodbless to init for taking them down a notch they were in the middle of evicting me for the 5th time this year until rage got invaded.
---
People are fucking retarded if they are complaining about those "ads"
---
i like the rorqual
---
I agree my pov isn't the most interesting for this fight, but it was for once a pretty fair fight that I think people on both sides enjoyed.

All of them allow you to play a little with the mids and lows depending on what you want to do.
---
Spent too much time staring at a frig, not enough watching the fight.
---
&gt;Do you really want them to be using dev cycles (and yes, many teams would be involved in reworking the launcher) to rework the launcher instead of other shit they could be improving?
---
but they already did...
---
Is it like a "you proved me wrong with a reasonable argument" pissed or a "I just read a post written by StainGuy" pissed?
---
you'are'oure
---
Atleast disable the a(i)ds for paying customers for fuck sakes.
---
I typically spin vnis on the side monitors while PvP happens  on the main display. This easily nets me 120m isk an hour.

Some catchy tunes from ruru community (by Pashko Morgan) - https://soundcloud.com/zpc-2/makinava-farmit-lyod
---
PvP: Amarr Frigates (Retribution and Maladiction), Caldari ships (Cormorant, Caracal, Moa, Ferox, Eagle). Study the doctrines of your alliance, this may be centered on Brave too much...
---
PvE: Gila
---
Concentrate on flying your ships well. Missile and hybrid weapon skills are important for PvP, Drones more for PvE.
---
T3Cs are very expensive, especially if you take the skill loss in account. Yes, they are great, but you have to be able to stomach losing more than a billion from time to time.
---
Mate, have you been in the Forum thread? Some dues in there I respect from in-game, throwing the most petulant, entitled pissy boy tantrums its unreal.  
---
This launcher does exactly the same as the last one, just in a different lay out and with the addition of groups - people with an issue with this are in issue themselves. 
---
Here let me sum up the fight from a Ferox vantage point:
---
Activate hardeners, turn on MWD &amp; keep FC at range, shoot things in broadcast window
---
Oh wait let me add in a Logi POV:
---
Activate hardeners, turn on MWD &amp; orbit "Logi FC", heal things in broadcast window
---
Here let me tell you about Links POV:
---
Activate hardeners, turn on MWD, keep at range on the FC, turn on links, tab out and shitpost on reddit
---
Here's another one [https://youtu.be/Tq2h0VCsPXU](https://youtu.be/Tq2h0VCsPXU)
---
Garmur and  Hecate
---
how would this prove a bot or multiinput lmao 
---
Ya I miss that too 
---
Where did you find a Lira fork in these times...
---
While i'm not excited about the new launcher, not because it changes anything important to me, but because so far the Feb update is just "New Launcher and Neocomm!". Just makes for a very boring patch/update.
---
That being said, i agree with you. The past few days have been dumb with everyone crying about launcher having "Ads" on it, when everytime i look at it, i see no additional ads. 
---
Then i get a chuckle about all the bots/rmt'ers/player with 30 rorq's crying about having to login all those accounts. If you hate having to login and keep up with so many accounts.. maybe don't have.. so many accounts?
---
tbh, if you want to do small/solo roaming you should consider Wh (not a wormholer btw)
---
you should get out and roam more then.
---
See you at planet six.
---
I am very interested in this as well. 
---
I am new player, still alpha, but hisec is almost getting boring now, yet everytime i even pop my head into the lowsec, it gets almost instantly blown-off. 
---
Actually, i have very little idea how to get to null (maybe through wormhloes?) in one piece, even less idea how to survive or what to do when i get there. I guess it is borderline impossible unles you are in alliance that owns (rents) a spce there? 
---
But then, as G-Whiting said, what about logistics, how will i sell/buy stuff from Jita when i am half galaxy away from there? :)
---
&gt; i can confidently say that these 2 ships are the only 2 (with the exception of Carriers ) that have this kind of bandwidth 
---
Umm... Vindicator? Eos? Dominix? Sin?
---
&gt;work
---
My sides. 
---
Meh, the EVE community just needs to bitch about something. Always has been the case, and always will be.
---
What's wrong with the new launcher?
---
It HaS AdS
---
Try Curse
---
Join a wh corp that welcome New players (not sure you can as an alpha since youll need at least covert ops cloak). You Will learn everything quicly... (probable die à lot too but Hey... This is eve...). This way youll learn pvp and wh mecanics 
---
Oh man, sometimes I just let this run on 2 screens as nice screensaver with good soundtrack while cleaning house or stuff like that
---
Curse is probably going to be full of fleeing SkillUrself and scourge pilots soon, they might feel strong enough to hit a solo newb...
---
Ask /u/ccp_fozzie for a bit of work around NPC null space. 
---
Every time I’ve submitted a ticket I was basically told to you are SOL 
---
Cap stable maelstrom with pith x type shield booster and x type explosive hardener will do it easily.  I would go auto cannons.  The cycle time on arty is too long.
---
You may get a more indepth answer, but I started fresh at the start of this year after a 9 year break, yes
---
I see how it is, no love for the snowflake recon cruisers.
---
ah, i fraked out and jumped to a beacon
---
I got my accounts back yesterday, after being contacted by CCP. Not saying a Reddit post is/should be a go to fix, but it was nice to get a quick response after waiting for 5 weeks!
---
Better smug about your part in blobbing the last remaining PvP alliances into their graves. Don't take the fight unless you've got that 4:1 advantage.
---
I've had 3 different queues set up in one week.  Oh I need to train x for alliance ops.  Fuck alliance ops I'm going for exploration.  Well my exploration is pretty good already,  let's do x..... 
---
Not playing has kept me on my dread queue though
---
Yeah we blob ppl from time to time, we just don't call them feeding though ;)
---
Try HK rental space
---
If the launcher is what people are complaining about things must be really good, I could not care less about the launcher.
---
There's also the official EVE app for phones if you want to look at Skill Queue as well. 
---
Join a (decent) corp that can teach you stuff.
---
Cant seem to find the title still but the artist is great so thanks for that
---
Who the fuck cares. When I started playing we didn't have outposts. 
---
Yes. Although I doubt there is much value asking a bunch of people playing a game if it's worth playing it.
---

---
Ask dev? Is it appropriate with such a menial problem that does not involve game mechanics or bugs? :)
---
I was thinking about searching the interwebs over the weekend to find moreless peaceful alliance in null that specializes in PvE / WH for now. And let them show me, if they would willing to babysit one hopeless noob for a while. :)
---
But it never hurts to ask on Reddit (well, the answers sometimes do). :D
---
Most of my kitchen has had to listen to me play EVE parodies at one point or another.  I can't even count how many have been like"Chef I started singing Little Bees instead of Let it Be and everyone looked at my funny, except this one guy who knew what I was singing!"  That's when I kindly explain you do not want to be known as an Eve player, even among gamers.
---
Yeah, as i just wrote in an answer below, i plan to find myself a good bunch over the weekend. :)
---
My favorite EVE song of all time, followed close by Judge Will Cut You Down. 
---
same as ferox but instead of shoot, apply webs.
---
10 years. A Moros. How fuckin wrong can you actually play the game hahaha
---
Now this the quality content I subscribed for.
---
We took fights up North outnumbered, try again.

Also SkillU had no trouble with outnumbering us in titans when allied with Tri/Winterco/PL/PH, so now it's time for medicine.
---
Dronelands before spring!

mine isnt...weird
---
Did you hurricane die in syndicate?
---
I am saying supers should not be able to fight subcaps.  They should not be deployed without support, friendly subcaps and/or normal carriers are specialized in killing subs and enemy fighters.  Supers would be more than capable of "popping caps" with these changes but would require the proper support to deal with smaller opposition.  This seems perfectly sensible to me.
---
Exooki: "Rat more" *whiplash sound*
---
HK-Members: "Yes Sir"
---
OOF :-P
---
90 to 120m per person.
---
if you multibox it helps.
---
plus thats before the 7k lp per site comes in. 
---
Finally, someone with a brain. I am not gonna let ads on a launcher ruin a game for me. Thats like saying hearing a ad on the radio ruined a drive for me. 
---
Loki or Vargur, both amazing ships :D 
---
[Yes, Join Brave! ](https://youtu.be/j_Ski9g3as4)

You got an EBR number for that?
---
Have you looked? It’s literally one ad, you can resize and I have 7 account names and it’s not an issue for me whatsoever. Are you playing on an iPhone 7 or something? 
---
Ok so maybe ill explain a bit.         
---
NPC space is ignored for years in development cycles and big push was made into SOV related areas to the point that most of the NPC NULL areas are now almost abandoned (as almost each buff to sov was nerf to NPC space).                     
---
For years people lived in those areas but as each SOV related interaction pulled more and more income from the NPC space - almost all of those groups moved out and those that are left are now just shadows of the former selves.           
---
Currently there are 2 items that you can do in NPC areas to make reasonable isk :              
---
* farm burner missions            
---
* mine moongoo in rorquals           
---
Both activities can be easily done by very small number of people ... quite often not totally related to NPC residents.            
---
Like if you want to live in NPC area ... you are not there to mine, and those burner missions that are being run ... are mostly donating to alts of people not directly related to NPC population.        
---
Nullsec NPC space is in very bad spot atm and only CCP devs can change this situation by putting a bit work into those areas.                 
---
oh boo-hoo
---
It was only one group though I thought. Like you couldn't tick some for ratters, some for market characters, some for cyno chain alts, etc. It was just, launch 'The Group' 
---
#New launcher is fine. Quit being whiney babies.
---
&gt; Just makes for a very boring patch/update.
---
So every patch/update has to be exciting?
---
[Very weird](https://i.imgur.com/Fb1uzYY.png)
---
Omega upgrade cycles between that and skin ads. 
---
I started using it when they had it as Beta. I haven't noticed much difference and never look at anything on the launcher other than where I click to start playing with a character. I didn't know there was ads till someone here mentioned it.
---
&gt; Because we always find something to bitch about for a ~~week~~ a couple of days
---
FTFY
---
First thing I did when they implemented manual piloting. Well.... I tried doing backflips, didnt work, went straight for barrel rolls.

Lol, Sadus?

What is the current fw status? And tier statuses for each faction?
---
whats wrong with that though? one news thingy, one cyclical advert. big whoop?

(Also I thought you meant 2/3rds adverts, glossed over "which will become" , 1/3 account login)

&gt; THAT'S SOUND OF FREEDOM YA GOD DAMNED ~~COMMIE~~

Focus on cruiser and frigate skills with support skills Those two are the most versitile for a newbro. By the time you reach the nextstep you will know what to do next.
---
Ah, now it makes sense. Thank you for this. 
---
I see you even wrote a guide on doing those burner missions. I'll look into it, thank you. 
---
Not bothering with the second option, i am not cut out for mining. 
---
you are correct i made mistakes in this video there is really no reason for me to keep at range in this video should always be orbiting really. But yeh off lining it whilst keeping at range would do very little for us has a much better effect orbiting.
---
I miss Cearul
---
Well Machariels are fucking sexy. I do like a lot of ships, but there's something special in being a battleship sized nimble cruiser that just gets me everytime I fly one. 
---
Thankyou for posting this, was reading all the reams of reeeee last night and thought I was going quietly insane.
---
By frigate skills with support skills you mean the “magic 14” and the spaceship command skills?
---
Did i say that?
---
If you're not a carebear or a miner, there have been very few actual meta changing/content patches. You got abyssal crap, which is just PVE content dungeons. We got fancy asteroid graphics last patch that does fuck all to anyone who doesn't mine. The last patch that even resembled something close to a balance/content patch was in October, and it didn't do anything to liven up ships that are underutilized. Just changed ECM and Fax's for the most part. The damavik got a change then, but its still worthless, especially since they released the kiki that outclasses it in every way.
---
We got some bug fixes which is fine, thaose are always welcome, but they don't make me excited about flying space ships in the same 3 year meta we've been stuck in.
---
The last good balance patch CCP released was March of last year. I guess its too much to ask to have some actual balance passes, like 1 ship a month or every 2 months just to keep things varied. Instead we focus on UI and graphic changes.
---
Disclaimer: Because i know your next statement will be "but, EVE will never be balanced!". I don't want perfect balance, i won't a shifting meta, where weaker things get stronger and stronger things get weaker, and the cycle continues at a decent rate. Every 6months to a year would be fine. Instead, we have to endure the same exact 100mn/logi/max tank bullshit capital meta for 3 years.
---
Sure you weren't input broadcasting your reddit posting?
---
Sure, that would be helpful to see.
---
When you say 'try curse'. Do you have any more info? Such as which corps are there? Or any answer to the shipping questions??
---
Thanks
---
Thank you I'll check it out.
---
If we still had this it would be the only content from some new releases that I would actually see.
---
Shit, I drop my Eve card like its my FBI (freaking badass individual) badge.  Other gamers immediately submit to me as more hard core.  Or maybe they are just putting distance between themselves and the weird guy?  
---
obvious baitpost is obvious.
---
Agreed, the center of focus for the launcher should be actually getting into game. Instead its a narrow column of accounts that you have to scroll through and 70% add space.
---
I mean going in at the right time makes the difference between bad tackle that burns at the enemy at the start of the fight and dies and good tackle that grabs high value targets and survives.
---
Yea actually this is like the 8th manifesto in 9 days
---
I'm not an alpha. Is WH space decent for solo/small gang?
---
I know nothing about it really - but again what is usually the case for getting ships there?
---
I don't like the idea of no loacal tho lol
---
Is this not a 64 bit client which is a literal upgrade, who cares if it's boring on the surface if it's an improvement in performance.. 
---
Cpt Blastahoe on soundcloud for some of that old school hip hop vibe 
---
Only if you never need that JavaScript developer for some other things....like maintaining their web sites.
---
Also, you're falling into the trap of believing throwing more developers at a codebase increases development speed.  And that's only true if you're wildly understaffed.  CCP isn't wildly understaffed.
---
Guess what you didn't get with this update stainguy ;)

I tried to keep it cheap but i was unsure of your skills so you may need to upgrade the CPU or add a pg rig.

N-6 has a nice Freeport market owned by Capitalist Army, (ran by the legendary Alekseye Karrde I’m sure I butchered the name) could be a good place to start out and go from there? They do small gang roams out from there every night, so it’s a low commitment experience to see if it’s for you.

The Angels 5/10 doesn't have an Overseer. The final "boss" is a structure. It does absolutely nothing, but has a huge amount of hitpoints. In a Gila you have to kill at least all the small stuff and the sentry towers to keep your drones save. You want to use hammerheads for the structure - it seems to have flat resistances.
---
Before I heard this song, Planet 6 was always my warp to in a new system. After this song I had to change it up. Probably why I lost so many ships doing that
---
So fucking dope.
---
It really depends on what draws you to the game. When I had a lot of time I used to go on lots of PvP fleets with my alliance.
---
Then university lectures started for me again and I had a lot of deadlines so while I participated a lot less in fleets, I took up importing goods into nullsec, did more exploration or semi-afk combat sites in my free time.
---
I wonder how hard it would be for EveMon to incorporate launching the game into their functionality?
---
Because my wishlist for a CCP designed launcher would be most of the functionality I currently use the EveMon overview screen for.
---
Name, ISK Balance, Training Queue etc. If I could just double click a portrait to launch that character I'd never use the CCP launcher again.
---
Not when we have to sit through another full week of ginned-up outrage and wall-of-text posts by armchair developers who have convinced themselves that software development is easy.

I made this name (my reddit name) back when I was a kid before I even joined Reddit. I stuck with it as I grew up just because I never thought of something better.

Risk aversion definitely happens, but the sheer scale of risk involved in committing supers to a fight you might *actually lose* is pretty silly. The problem is, in a normal null war, you have to be willing to commit supers to escalate *any* fight; since you'd have to be crazy to do that unless you were certain of victory, most of the time, one side stands down. 
---
People could be a lot less risk-averse with dread fleets because losing one doesn't kill your alliance in 2k19. People *will* still be risk-averse with them, but not to the same extent. 
---

I agree.  I'm just trying to show how ridiculous these people are with "95% of my screen is adds." 
---
I started this time last year and am still loving the game, and I don’t think much has changed since then. 
---
The most important thing you can do if you play is to look around for something you like doing, and trying to find people to do it with. When I was newer I liked FW, so I’d sometimes get 4 or 5 people from Horde to come with me to lowsec and we’d usually get a kill or two before someone in a kitey pirate frig killed too many of us. 
---
Made a nick based on my Ultima Online char ....as for the StainGuy, this was created to clearly address NPC null issues, especially relating to my home -&gt; Stain region on reddit.

I am quite annoyed by people putting faces after each sentence ... like i know why and who is doing it but at the same time it is so different than EU/US culture that it is irritating as i am more focusing on the damn "face" than on the text it was posted.             
---
Better than carrier rants.
---
Eve is shit lmbo
---
who wants to erp?
---
Yes, start today with a free account and explore the game. Find something that interests you and find other people to do it with. While you can play EVE solo you will get the most out of the game if you find other people to play it with. Join a group (corp) in game or find some friends to try it with. CCP has made it easier than ever to catch up to older players if you put the effort in.
---
I'm glad you consider carrier to be so broken they aren't even ships to you.
---
/r/factorio
---
you are welcome

damn

If the ads were so large you couldn't get into the theater, you'd change your tune. If you cant get into fast food there may be another problem so I'll leave that one be.
---
And btw, there are screenshots of that happening with these ads
---
Who?
---
Jesus Christ! It's not like they created a new operating system. It's a launcher. Probably uses about 3/4 of the code from the last one.
---
The downvotes are those smoothbrain morons complaining about a fucking launcher......... LITERALLY EMBARRASSING 
---
Definitely this. Hell, I did the data sites as well for a while. One successful trip in a heron will fund your next 10 herons easily, so it's pretty easy to make a profit :)
---
No matter balance, tidi or anything else, one thing will always amaze me - how hardcore EVE can be. There is a big coalition OP going to take place, everyone is moving ships, there are loads of FCs, logistics people, high command organising stuff. You join comms, you see literally hundreds of people online in different channels (actual people, this is not ingame characters online) with multiple subcap fleets, capital fleet, super/titan fleet if on standby. People are helping each other, getting into doctrine ships, lending/selling ships/modules to others so they can get ready etc. etc. In the meantime stuff is being coordinated between multiple alliances, sometimes between multiple coalitions. Heh, people even alarmclock, call in sick for this kind of stuff.
---
And in the end even if its TIDI slugfest, node crash or blueballs - its still fkin awesome how hardcore and serious this gets! You don't see this anywhere, its amazing!
---
There is plenty of happening in EVE people have just learned to not post it on this subreddit because of the turbo toxic culture of down voting everything people don't agree with. There have been several BRs posted over the past few weeks of fights between small groups yet they never reach more than a few dozen upvotes. There is a subset on this subreddit that down votes everything that doesn't involve the big blocs and the comments are always full of smack saying these entities aren't relevant when people are just trying to have fun in game.

This subreddit is has become increasingly toxic over the past year and the worse it gets the less real content is going to get posted.
---
&gt;  there have been very few actual meta changing/content patches. 
---
Read that part again.
---
the 64 bit client is nice, but again, is mainly for 1 group of players, so they don't get salty and d/c when they're in big fleet fights. There will probably be more consistency/smooth operation for everyone, but its not going to change me logging in to play with the same ships against the same meta.
---
Where did you bought this "omega and plex" ?
---
Its not that there are ads, the old launcher had ads on 25% of the space.
---
Its the new ads are 75% of the launcher, its bumping my accounts off the screen, and I can't FUCKING LAUNCH THE GOD DAMN GAME.
---
A launcher needs to GET ME INTO THE GAME. If it helps me get into the game with two columns of accounts or some account status stuff, even better. But at a bare minimum, a launcher... needs to launch the game.
---
And the old launcher was...  
---
How about ad space vs account list space ratio old and new?  
---
Numbers without context are worse than meaningless,  but good effort and it's a nice starting point
---
on the steam store ovs lol. where else do i buy it?
---
Why not just check zkill for some of the most active corps in the npc regions?
---
Pushx will deliver to any npc null station for you. 
---
68% of that is legacy code :)
---
u have a lot of borrow money reddit posts, giving me the feeling u sold isk/items for real money
---
Have you tried to raise a support ticket to CCP about it?
---
oh no i dont do that, I had borrow money because I needed to but some food and fix my moms car lol. I dont even know how to sell isk for real money. Is that even possible?
---
Is that a Golem spinning? Take my upvote
---
I buy all my plex and isk from other websites all the time never had a problem you pay on site and some guy from ranger regiment contracts you the stuff
---
I wanted to get data of the old launcher but couldn't figure out how.  This was more to show those people spewing, "95% of the launcher is adds," that they are full of it.
---
Yup, Im banned from the fourms and I highly doubt they will check my tickket.
---
Check your email associated with the account, they may have sent something with a better explanation. 
---
nope never got an email at all Ive waited for a day.
---
isnt that the bad way of doing things, i mean i dont want to get banned but i got banned.
---
The last month and a half have shown the competence of TAPI. Good luck with dronelands before spring lol
---
i heard it was someone from KWG
---
I'm just glad I can still login to EVE. :D
---
Outside of some cases of folks complaining about the launcher not updating properly, the chief concern that it would lose people's accounts did not manifest. But complainers needed something to complain about so ads were the next best thing.
---
Exactly... get your shit kicked in a few times, and eventually joining a bloc so that you can grow sounds very attractive.  One you get allies for important timers so you are less likely to get attacked.  Two you get allies timers to whore on, more content.  Three, leadership has a lot less effort and responsibility.

current meta is to post stupid image macros and retards upvote it
---
that's fair, I guess I always just saw this whole thing as hyperbole, but some people do take their launcher space entirely too seriously.
---

---

---
Provi
---
The answer is that noone here can help you with that. 
---
Most people only ever get banned for either botting or RMTing. I'm guessing you've done one of these. 
---
Good to know. I've done them all, but mostly due Guristas just cause it's convenient, other than escelations to Tama. Seems like the tower distance in the Guristas one was furtherest of the 5/10's but possibly was just me. In the Guristas one of the towers can be done with missles and the other 2 I do with drones. I do have to change out my fit to get a DLA in. Other than the last room none of them seemed very difficult and always had the option to warp out, and with citadels can get a quick repair.
---
Curse, GW, Syndicate
---
Can cautiously recommend OSY-UD for staging in EUTZ. Serp agent for easy 400mil/h, FRT. will obv. blob you etc. but are IMO way more reasonable and engageable than other alliances of that size.
---
In terms of corps i'd say, live in a region for a while, join local resident group you like.
---
In terms of logistics - a mix of   
---
DST w/ scouting alt bringing in stuff through nearby thera holes 
---
opportunity purchases from local market
---
 buying BPCs and manufacturing battleships locally (if you can buy minerals) 
---
Black Frog if all else fails
---
Its not as convenient as having alliance JF service haul your shit for pennies, but its not that big of a deal.

you have 4 thousand karma... get back in your box

whats botting or rmting. I am new to the game how do i know these things? like so new that I dont even know how to play the game at its fullest extent.

I really love how the changes to cynos were implemented. CCP’s idea of how to move them out of the regular beacon overview tab was logical, well explained, and well executed. I know it seems like a small thing, but I liked how smoothly they changed it.

My wife and I took acid and sat on the patio one afternoon. I don't remember the thought process, but Legbeard Catfood was born. I have hairy legs and a pet cat, so I guess it started somewhere from there

The largest null sec market is in the 1DQ Keepstar, you can buy and sell almost anything there.It can quickly become boring again , but you have a ton of special interest groups. Ranging from free frigate fleets and moon mining (very profitable) to large scale industry and research jobs. You'll get access to an amazing database of fits and know-hows that will make your life much easier. Also in order to move to null sec (in this case Delve), you don't need to physically do the 40+ jumps. The only thing that moves is your clone.Upon joining you will be provided with tons of new stuff that will make out well worth it.

Warp on grid with it and visually observe. Or get within dscan range and scan it. There are usually structure or celestials.

Curse.

It doesn't show up on dscan, it can fight outnumbered better than any ship at its size, and it can engage well above its weight solo.  If you find a region with slow ratters or a fw area with a lot of cruisers, you can be on someone and have them cap-dead before they even know it.  It just feels so good to be the boogeyman
---
This :)
---
Just wondering, I tried to figure out what’s the big deal with the rorqual since everyone is talking about them, could you explain if you don’t mind? I never really did much mining only the first few days, but are they that good?
---
It's about doing your part. I'm sure you've heard the term F1 monkey. People who play one account always dps ships etc.  Eve is a numbers game, so in order for any Corp other than the biggest blue donuts to compete in a fleet engagement you must bring more to the table than just a dps ship.  Most of the time in a cap engagement there's going to be a sub cap fleet so you have one dps or logi in there, you fly a sabre alt to keep tackle on the targets or fly links which generally doesn't need 100% attention, then when it's time to jump in caps you bring in however many you can handle/are needed to help secure the fight.
---
I'm generally at least flying logi on my main and have a sabre alt logged in either with the fleet or ready to scramble to where it needs to be.
---
...where they sell that 1st class flight you dont attend but become a t-shirt for.
---
Clearly this is just PGL building an alibi for his Imperium Spy for the next Great Big Very Bad World War Bee
---
Login Button for PL and Undock Button for NC.

So it was unintentional irony? Self burn!
---
Coming from INIT? Kool story bro.
---

---
The easiest, lowest effort, most scalable way of making isk in game outside of actual botting.
---
They are quite good individually, but they scale too well.
---
Don't be jealous. It's an ugly trait.
---
+10 for convincing retort!
---
Cal-Gal is dead (after having been the primary FW area).  Calmil finally had enough and the main Calmil Coalition disbanded and Galmil fractured with little content in the area... turning on themselves or going to nullsec.

I rolled a few dozen random names to get a feel for how my race's names sound then came up with my own along the same lines.

Well, not being a dirty wormhole carebear definitely helps there.

Horde, TEST, Brave, Karmafleet etc... are all valid choices for newbies. He should try himself and see where he fits.

---
If you want to be in sov null under an alliance, make sure pick the right corp. Even in an alliance, having the right corp makes all the difference. Find one that does what you want. There's some turbo krab corps and some focused only on pvp and middle of the road ones. 
---
I know nothing about wormholes but I hear it's great for am all gang because you literally can't fit a huge blob through the hole. 
---
Otay!

This argument would be valid if game was still enjoyable. With local being nonaccurate-its not.

Fountain has a couple NPC null sec groups... They seem to be fairly active... But they might be balkan. Not sure

---
Dude, run!!!
---
What if... they made that an option for omega accounts?
---
Wanted to spell Atticus but I'm retarded and don't know how to spell so I became addicus. Still retarded but I'm getting better at spelling
---
Wormhole space is the best for small gang because you can't fit a blob through a wormhole. It will collapse behind you. There is also different environmental effects in wormhole such as pulsars that increase shield hp and wolf reyets that make small weapons do enormous amounts of damage.

## February Release - More Little Things!
---
2019-02-08 - By The EVE Dev Team  - EVE dev-blogs📷
---
[*If you'd like to discuss this devblog, feel free to head on over to the feedback and comments thread on the official forums!*](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/devblog-february-release-more-little-things/138594)
---
Hi spacefriends!
---
As  many of you know, for a while now we have been collecting ideas and  suggestions for small changes that would improve the quality of your  everyday EVE lives. While the work on this is a continuous effort  throughout the year, we release a lot of the little things in batches  and now in February it's time to deliver such a batch. 
---
[We have a long running forum thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/little-things-small-qol-suggestions/3545)  where we encourage you to post your little things ideas (please follow  the suggested format!), but this time around, a lot of the little things  we are introducing were highlighted to us at EVE Vegas last fall. There  we had many informal discussions with you guys where you brought up  your ideas and we also held a Little Things roundtable where we  discussed such improvements and collected index cards with your  suggestions. 
---
In this blog we want to walk you through some of the  changes we are introducing now in February, and then go over some of  the changes we released in a huge batch last September, which have not  been covered in a devblog before.
---
One feature that has been very  frequently requested is to be able to be able to quickly search for a  specific item type in your Personal Assets, and our response has usually  been "Yeah, that would make sense". So that being brought up once again  at Vegas was a nice kick in the butt to finally get that done. After  the next patch is released, you'll have a new right click option on item  types, **"Find in Personal Assets"**, which will open the  Personal Asset window, perform the search for you and as a result, list  all the places where you own said item type.
---
Along with this comes the **new search keyword "typeExact"**,  which allows you to search for items with that exact type name. For  example, searching for "typeExact: Veldspar" will only return you the  Veldspar items, while using the existing keyword "type", "type:  Veldspar" will return you any item types that have Veldspar in their  names, such as Dense Veldspar and Veldspar Reprocessing.
---
As with  many input fields in EVE, you can drag items into that search field. We  have now changed that so when you drag an item in the Asset Search, they  keyword **"typeExact"** is added, so when the search is  performed, it will only return you the items of the same item type as  the one you dragged into the search field.
---
At  our roundtable in EVE Vegas, an Industrialist, who freely admitted that  his situation we probably rather unique with his 150 industry  characters, asked for **a summary of all of the character's jobs**  when opening the Industry window so he could tell at a glance if he had  job slots free. While his situation is a unique one, that kind of  summary would benefit most of us doing any kind of industry work, so we  are happy to add that.
---
We  have a lot of search and filter fields in EVE, and while many of them  allow things to be dragged and dropped into them, not all do. We’re huge  fans of drag &amp; drop and apparently, we’re not alone as quite a few  of you have been asking for the **ability to drop things into those fields**.  We went through a lot of the edit fields in EVE and added the ability  to drag and drop items, characters, corporations or alliances in them,  depending on context. For example, characters can now be dropped in the  Guest tab, corporation application filter and contacts list, and items  can be dropped in filters in the Fitting window and the Industry window.  There are still a few fields that we have yet to tackle, so please let  us know if you favorite one is missing the awesomeness of drag &amp;  drop!
---
Those of you who have assigned shortcuts in EVE (and by the  way, you can assign shortcuts to A LOT of things) might know the  frustration when your preferred shortcut is already taken, and you are  asked to clear it manually before continuing. We are streamlining that  experience, and instead now you will be told that key combination is in  use and **are offered to rebind it to your new shortcut.**
---
You requested and thus we are adding a display of the **total item volume on the 3rd page of the Courier contract creation**,  the page where the destination and rewards are specified. For those who  rarely create courier contracts or have fantastic memory, it might not  sound like a big deal, but for us forgetful people, this will save us  quite a few trips back to the previous page to see that volume number  when we are trying to figure out how much we should be paying as  rewards.
---
On this page of the contact creation window we are also displaying **how much ISK you will be paying per m3**,  based on your inserted reward and we hope that will help those of you  who use player run shipping services that charge based on volume. 
---
The  inventory in EVE allows you to set up powerful filters to control what  is visible in the inventory at a given time. Some of you have set up  very extensive and elegant filters but have requested the ability to be  able to allow more people to benefit from your work by **sharing the inventory filters with your friends and alts**.  We want to help with that, so we are adding a way to share them. In  order to share a filter with your friends, you open the filter's window  by clicking "Edit", then you proceed to drag the special box to any text  field, such as chat or the notepad. After that, anyone who clicks that  link will load up a window which will allow them to save that filter for  their character.
---
Similarly, we are adding **the ability to share Fleet Broadcast Settings**.  You will now be able to share your broadcast settings with friends, or  create links with your broadcast settings presets, which will, for  example, allow you to easily switch from your dps settings to your logi  settings.
---
A few years ago, we added the first type of settings  links when we introduced the ability to share Overview Profiles through  links. With the addition of the 2 new settings links mentioned above and  a new special link we are working on (more on that at a later date), we  thought it was good time to add a way to quickly distinguish the links  type. We have divided the links into a few groups, and each group has  its own link color. Most of the links will fall under the default link  color and remain unchanged apart from a slight change in the mouseover  color. Below you can see the new color scheme. The links will of course  still have the tooltips to tell you what they do so you will not have to  rely entirely on link color.
---
And  because I know a few of you might be panicking right about now, I just  want to reassure you that you can still El'Miner each other, but  tricking people into joining that busy chat when they think they are  opening a  killreport might be a little trickier now that the channel  link has a different color.
---
A request we have frequently heard is  that you want to be able to filter Cynosural Fields separately from  other beacons in your custom Overviews. While moving them to their own  group is in theory straight forward, what complicates matters is that a  lot of you have custom Overview Profiles that do not include the new  group. Without special preparation the Cynosural Fields would therefore  not appear on your Overview after the change. To combat this we started  preparing early for this change by adding the new group, with the  temporary name “Future Home of Cyno Fields”, to the Overview filters in  December, which has given you ample time to update your Overview  Profiles and shared Overview packs to be updated. In the upcoming  February release, we will finalize the change by moving the Cynosural  Fields into the new group, which will be renamed to be simply called  “Cynosural Fields“.
---
## But wait, there's more!
---
In addition to all those, we have a few more of your suggestions implemented:
---
* A filter field has been added to the "Show Contents" window.
---
* An estimated price and item count has been added to the Cargo scan window. 
---
* We have added 2 bigger fonts sizes to choose from for the Context Menu (set in ESC&gt;General Settings).
---
* A yellow warning marker (!) has been added in front of those options that player might want to use with a bit of caution.
---
* A Health readout has been added to the tooltip for your drones.
---
* The  Assist and Guard menus for drones will now only list the pilots on your  grid, since the drones cannot be assigned to those off-grid.
---
* The "Mine Repeatedly" function for drones is now simply called "Mine" and the single mining cycle option has been removed.
---
* The ability to Copy/Paste from the "Jobs" tab in the Industry window has been added.
---
## Previously Introduced Little Things!
---
As mentioned above, we also want to tell you about some changes we delivered to you the September release, so here we go!
---
One very common request throughout the years has been to **allow modules in cargo to be included  in saved fits**.  In a world where mobile depots exist, it’s gotten to be pretty fair to  say these modules are actually a part of the fit. We have been open to  this for a while, but what has stopped us in the past was the low  character limit in the chat as the fits would be truncated if the links  and fit information would exceed the limit. The new chat system  introduced last year has a much higher character limit, so we were happy  to finally be able to include modules in cargo hold in the saved fits.
---
Another thing commonly requested feature has been to be **able to update fits**  and we added a way to do that last September. Saving a fit with the  same name as an existing fit will now override the existing fit with the  new one. So to update a fit, simply load it up in simulation mode, make  your adjustments and then save the fit with the same name.
---
When we added the Market ticker a last year, a lot of you wanted to have some control over it, so we **added the ability to specify a Quickbar folder that control what is displayed in the Market Ticker**.  Simply right click on your folder in the Quickbar and select “Mark as  Market Ticker Folder” and the Market Ticker will show the market  information for the items in that folder.
---
Other notable little things you asked for which were introduced in September:
---
* A “last saved” timestamp has been added in the tooltip for the fit in the fitting window
---
* If  you fail to fit all items when fitting from the Fitting Management  window or a standalone fit window, you are now offered to open Multibuy  for the items.
---
* If you save or share a fit while having drones launched, the fit will now include those drones.
---
* Fitted ships in contracts can now be directly simulated from a right click menu on the ship.
---
* View Market Details has been added to the simulated cargo items as well as drone and fighter bay items.
---
* Multibuy  has been added to the Neocom menu (under the Finance folder) and the  ability to assign a shortcut to that window has also been added.
---
* You can now activate multiple skin licenses at a time.
---
* Skins are now grouped by name in the Character sheet (rather than material), which will reduce the number of groups.
---
* Ships  listed under each skin in the Character sheet now have a magnifying  glass so you can easily preview the skins and access the buttons to  acquire them.
---
* Text that summarizes how many Skins you have has been added to the top of the Skin panel in the Character sheet.
---
* The  skin tab in the info window for a ship will now show a check mark for  the skins you own and list them first, followed by the rest of the  skins.
---
* The skin tab in the info window for a ship will has been  flattened out, rather than each skin being in its own collapsible group.
---
* “Estimated Price” column has been added to the Compare tool.
---
* “Dock/Jump/Activate Gate” hotkey now works on wormholes.
---
* The  message telling you are not in fleet when you activate a fleet shortcut  is no longer modal and should be less disruptive now.
---
* The  tooltip on skills in the Character sheet now includes how many  skillpoints you will train per minute for that skill, given your current  attributes.
---
* A shortcut has been added to allow for collapsing  all the windows. It can be found under Esc&gt; Windows&gt; Toggle  collapse all windows. This is the functionality that a few years ago was  bound to the Tab key.
---
* Ctrl+Tab now cycles through the windows  in the order of Most recently active to Least recently active, instead  of ordering the window by when they were opened.
---
* The entries in  Tab Presets &gt; Tab Types in the Overview settings now show the  brackets for the groups (if possible) to help with identification.
---
* The systems in the Sovereignty tab in the info window for Constellations are now alphabetically sorted.
---
* Structure type, Services and Low Power filters have been added to the My Structures tab in the Structure Browser.

The majority of those are Russian soldiers and civilians starved indirectly through sieges of places like Leningrad. Millions of Russians were killed in the Holocaust, but they are only a fraction of the deaths that Russia faced.

I have to say that brave collective has again provided good content this week and are really good dudes to fight. They may bring more numbers than you but at least they don't drop supers and titans on you constantly (outside of impasse that is)
---
If your null group is shit, it will have garbage logistics, and trash market.  If you join a group that has its act together you will have decent logistics and a decent market.
---
Look to the MER and see which null system market places are doing well and use that to help decide the group.

One thing though, 1DQ1-A is going to be the best player owned market on that list. And it is for Goons like me, and potentially you if you want to join us.
---
If logistic needs are not being met, and market is garbage, it can provide an unnecessary burden on you and interfere with your game play.  It also may signal other deep issues within the corp as a whole.  I have lost track of all of the horror stories of crap corps with CEOs wrecking everything, making people hate logging in, being kleptocrats, or just plain unable to run  an effective organization.  All of those stories mentioned constant issues with their market, and their logistics.  This usually spells doom in the end.

Doesn't look like anything good
---
isn't there a one-button-launches-multiple-accounts thing now? can't be a total waste. I want muh clock back, though, that was handy.
---
Isnt that a single player game? I guess I Should have said something because breath of the wild is a pretty good sub for that too. Come to think of it, all the tamer subs seem to be single player games. 
---
🤔 
---
The fact that the shortcuts will finally let you reassign them instead of just asking you to go fix it yourself (forcing you to spend ages finding that other shortcut) is really, really nice. That was a huge pain in the ass when setting up new configs.

You get sweet kills though a decent portion of the time though I'd say despite kids climbing all over me

One does not simply *pick up* EVE Online. She's is a lady and she doesn't care about your happiness. You create a character and then spend the next several years desperately trying to make something of yourself. At the end of that time you may have developed the patience, maturity, and humility to be worthy of her.

that's what i commented too and got downvoted. 
---
So to fly a titan you need very strict coordination between three key ships that have to be in different fleets so it’s easier to just do it yourself than spread the work load?
---
I’ve heard about F1 monkey and know enough to see why, but I also know enough from other mmos that these roles seem similar. DPS class is fun cause epeen numbers, tank is fun because in ur face action, nobody wants to be a healer because reasons. Most MMOs have boring DPS but more fun tanks and healers. 
---
I know EvE isn’t exactly like it, but there are parallels so it makes me wonder why someone would multibox. I get bringing value to the table of a large fight, but thinking about it....
---
Is it because eve has more “real-world” consequences with a single shared server and open RMT directly tied into the in-game economy that makes it more appealing to have multiple accounts?
---
1. Make sure you wrap up any relationships that were important to you. Thinking of ending it with the girlfriend? Nows the time. Going out too much with friends? Pull back. You can't rock at EVE an still socialize with hoomans that aren't on Discord/Mumble.
---
2. Figure out what your max budget is, triple that, and stick to it. When you realize skilpoints are everything you'll become hooked on buying injectors like a DJ with coke on a Saturday morning. 
---
3. Do the Agent missions for a while but realize these only serve to get you familiar with the game, NOT advance you through the game. Think of them like a high school guidance counselor: ultimately worthless but a stage you needed to go through.
---
4. Join a noob friendly corporation. It's not something you do for extra content, it's something you do to not hate the game. This is especially important because by this time it's too late to quit the game. The game owns you now.
---
5. Watch YouTube training videos that are less than 2 years old. Stuff by Jurious Doctor are especially good and relatively current. Feels like sitting through a lecture? Thats cause it is. EVE isn't a game it's an alternate lifestyle. You gotta go to EVE school.
---
6. Never treat a ship as precious. Whether it's your first corvette or a Titan, a ship is as expendable as your spot on your second string soccer team (which you quit because of step 1). Expect to lose them. Don't be mad when you do. Make lots of them.  
---
This, my dude, is the facts.

I wanted Jorj X. McKie from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dosadi_Experiment

---
what if you took "ad space" to mean "the entire panel of wasted space that contains the ads" instead of the literal ad pictures
---
like a thinking person 
---
what a brilliant idea! please let me know when my bots are reported, so I can skill extract the account and start a new one.
---
bots are a problem for CCP to solve, not the players. hunting them only does more economic damage in the long run as they replace their shit with dirty isk and drive price of plex and extractors up.
---
&gt;New Link Type (unannounced feature)
---
What could this be?
---
Like everyday, i can't wait to leave the office and go scan cosmic signatures for hours, looking for pvp in dozen of holes, and like every day, i will go to work tomorrow with only one herron kill.
---
Oh wait it's friday ! i don't work tomorrow
---
I would like this
---
It's an advertisement telling me to upgrade to omega, when I have three omega accounts already. It is trivial to determine omega status for CCP using their own API endpoint, let alone any kind of programmatic implementation that doesn't use the API. 
---
It'd be like my landlord pestering me for rent for the next month when I paid 6 months in advance. 
---
Intuitive is not the same as familiar.
---
I'd be happy to look at that. How would you define wasted space versus dead space? 
---
Not working with the Eve launcher update atm though =[
---
As a solo player, i did this, even went all in with the lvl 5 cert and all.
---
Solo logi isnt a thing thou :/
---
Old PIZZA is one of my favorite corps of all time
---
So I've posted this before but I've been waiting for a response from CCP if something like this would be possible but I haven't heard anything yet. Standing fleets are a big thing in alliances and especially wormhole space. When someone with fleet boss goes AFK or someone with fleetboss leaves games and its given to someone who's afk and doesnt repost an advert it's annoying as hell because now everyone has to leave that fleet and remake it so you end up with multiple standing fleets. I feel like it would be a huge quality of life feature that could have an option to toggle on or off so if you dont wanna use the feature you dont have to.
---
Either way, you won't really get an answer on reddit, your only solution is to contact Eve support, i.e. GM, via their website, and hopefully you will be cleared.
---
good idea, but bad thing for fcs being spied
---
A lot of good things actually. Maybe you aren’t affected by them all, but good none the less.  
---
To a group of people who throw autism around like its a baby you're complaining to them about change? Really? Way to not know your demographic.
---
I chose a highly offensive name, and CCP renamed my toon to Amarr Citizen 746.
---
I kindly requested them change it to TD746. Im honestly pretty embarrassed by it now both for its juvenality and the stupid story i have to explain.  
---
It helps in fleets tho.  Not too many people have double consonants at the beginning of their name (and my name doesnt start with A either)  . When i say my name on comms or someone else refers to me, noone is confused who "TD" is.
---
No im not telling you what it was.
---
Dude its not a personalized ad, its a generic "catch-all" ad.  Besides it goes from that to a skin advert. Are you really this whiney and pedantic? 
---
Bringing back off grid?
---
Botting is using a third party application to play the game (farm) for you while you're not online.
---
RMT is trading in-game items for real money, it is against CCP policy.
---
Either way, no one on here can help you with that, you need to submit a ticket, they sometimes take time to respond, but sometimes they also don't, so just submit one and hope for luck.
---
If you have enough spies to have your posit I'll on taken you're fucked anyways

Dont use marauders. Wormhole pve scales way better with alts. Leshaks and Rattlesnakes are what you should use

Thank you for this! I just started playing again last night and after being on this sub, i was expecting to see blatant shameless advertising on the new launcher. Once i loaded it and saw that its a perfectly fine launcher with 3 articles/announcements, i was thinking this  exact same this as OP

bot away in omist and rmt out mate.
---
Yeah and that's a problem especially when 50% of the time it's telling me to upgrade to Omega taking up 1/3 of my launcher. 
---
This isn't some brain-dead website, it's the launcher for a game someone may or may not be actively subscribed to. Account status should play a part when being told to upgrade. 
---
How deep into the shitty UI/UX rabbit hole that is CCP are you that you think this is good?

---

---
Now the question is: Are you trolling or are you rly that dumb?
---
it's a meme because ccp buffed freighter ehp by 40% because they increased wreck ehp
---
If you're in a serious corp who is serious about pvp, you have to do what you can to help win fights. Taking Waffles (my corp) for example we generally form at least 1.5-2x the number of pilots in fleets as we have individual people. That in addition to flying beefier/more expensive ships helps us take on fights where if we were all flying one ship, we'd be hopelessly outnumbered and unable to break the opposition fleet, but since most of the secondary roles like tackle/links/cynos/etc are handled by alts, that doesn't take away DPS and Logi numbers so we're able to hold against fleets with a lot more people.
---
Since you brought up the MMO style archetypes, look at any top guild in WoW and you'll see they aren't just playing one character. They have to have a ton of alts, even of the same class, to properly gear their mains using the systems the game has in place.
---
The main difference(other than that the games are nothing alike lol) is that in WoW there are a max number of people you can bring to a fight. 20 for mythic raiding for example. In eve there is no max number of people other than what the server/node can handle before crashing. So while all of the alts can be on the same account in WoW where you don't need to use them at the same time, in Eve they need to be used at the same time, so you have multiple accounts.
---
oh mah gawd, so much improvements
---
i love LSH for dropping on us even if it might be bait. thanks for bringing fights
---
Oh if the fix for botters was this simple, I will jump for joy.

---
I rarely fly one, but the Bhaalgorn was an early favorite with me, and I still really like it now that it's cheaper.
---
There is no reason for any advertisement of any kind to take up 1/3 of a window. Imagine opening a website on your phone and 1/3 is being taken up with the cookie notice(news item) and then another 1/3 for an ad(Omege upgrade/current skin) you cannot close leaving only 1/3 for the actual information you want. 
---
Would this scenario be acceptable to you as well? If not, why? 
---
Yes because they only release one thing per release, cannot have ship balance if there are QoL changes ...
---
Doubtful.   I'm much better at shitposting  
---
Uh, lets not pretend ccp will ever balance the game for the hisec rats...
---
I relate to this story
---
Some people don't like it when people complain about things... they might think that writing a 6000 word essay about how they want things is a waste of time and that CCP knows best and we should all STFU and suckle at the teet of the sales and marketing department.
---
To those people, I say NO!
---
Those those people I say, do not cower you your caves, in your holes, rise up and make your complaints and your suggestions! Rise up and show those in power what you really want. What the players really want. Huurah!
---
Why write 6000 words when you can spend 10 hours writing code!?
---
... So after my screenshot yesterday, well, if you're a programmer, you know how the rabbit hole goes... I came back from the cinema, sat down in my office, and the next time I look up its 5am and I've expanded the mock data, added more mock functions, and re-written the entire thing in Javascript... but don't expect anything to actually *do* anything, and it's far from the cleanest code i've ever written...
---
I've made this a website because it's a whole lot easier to update a website with feedback, than it is to keep uploading images, and after the positive response from yesterday, I wanted to create a more complete version... even if it's still completely non-functional. I want to give CCP a demo of what I think a login experience should be like. 
---
* Added labels over the top of account info to show time remaining
---
* Ads, because everybody loves ads
---
* Created launcher groups (and populated with some dummy data) that you can expand by clicking on the bars. These are kinda like favourite characters, rather than accounts.

&gt;The last month and a half have exposed the incredible incompetence of TAPI. 
---
Over extension maybe.  Over confidence maybe, but incredible incompetence might be taking the piss a bit.
---
It's always harder to go operate in someone else's space, and there are groups in Eve that have learned that, and groups that haven't tried yet.
---
1. Do the agent missions see how you like them, some will be more interesting than others.
---
2. Find what you want to do in the game, PvP, exploration, pirating, mining, manufacturing, etc. And go do it.
---
3. Remember, do not aim for making enough isk to PLEX your account into omega each month, you'll burn yourself out super fast. Spend your actual money to get omega and you'll love the game more.
---
4. Do not, under any circumstance fly what you cannot afford to lose. What I mean by this is, if you have a 100 mill worth ship and only 20 mill left in everything you own, don't even think about undocking it. If your in a ship that costs 20 mill and have 200 mill in the bank or assets, undock it and go for it!
---
5. Join a noob friendly corp/alliance, Pandemic Horde, BRAVE, TEST, etc., most are big entities but all want to help out new players excel in what they want to do. 
---
6. Remember, if for example you choose exploration to make isk and get bored of it, you can switch to anything else. You don't have to do only one thing in the game, you do what you want. 
---
7. If I were you, I would start with joining a group listed above and go PvP right after the agent missions, non-stop PvP, you'll have more fun then ever doing so. It may seem weird, but its adrenaline pumping at first, but never ever gets old. Don't be stressed out if you die 100 times, you'll get better every encounter and learn new things all the time.
---
8. Don't do EvE alone, it'll get boring really quick and you'll get lost. Make friends have a good group of people and have fun.
---
9. EvE is that game where if you don't like the people/group, then leave it and move onto the next group until you find a group that suits you. 
---
10. Never be afraid to ask for help, if you die in PvP send the person a message and ask them how would you get better, what did you do wrong, 9 times out of 10 they'll respond with helpful tips for you regardless if they are at war with you.
---
And last,
---
Just have fun! Ask questions, learn, find a good group of people, and have a blast.
---

Just because I'm annoyed doesn't mean I'm surprised. It's /r/eve. CCP could give us everything we asked for and we'd be upset about it.

&gt;New Link
---
Where did you see this? I can't find it.
---
The average collateral we get is very low. Because newbros don't have much high-ISK items. As the corp grows and the average collateral price goes up, the % will be revisited for sure. Right now, it's balancing the costs to the JF pilots and keeping it cheap as we can for our members.
---
Anyone with high collateral items knows they should talk to me and we work something very fair out. Another reason for the 2B limit.
---
I think I've said all I can usefully say in this post. Thanks to you and others who posted reasonable comments and thoughts instead of the assfest that is the rest of it.

Used the name generator, found a last name I liked, and started using first names I liked (often picked from the family tree). The exception is my highsec ganking alt because I didn't want them to be associated with one another.

---
A lot of talk about the new launcher, but i'm gonna ask a serious question:
---
does anybody have new vs old launcher CPU usage % numbers? I never bothered to look before. This one spikes my cpu 2-4% every ten seconds. Obviously i can just close it once i've launched, but i'm curious if there's a significantly different effect on performance between the two, and if it went up or down.  
---
Bonus points for ram usage. 177mb for me right now. Not that I don't have overkill amounts of ram.  
---
I know there's threads about the launcher but those guys are have no chill right now.
---
They've been doing a lot of industry UI adjustments, Neocom UI changes to make it "newbro friendly", introduced abyssal PVE which can be done solo and not with a fleet of 3000 capital nerds and just last patch added graphic effects for munching rocks, which i'm sure both highsec and nullsec bears can both enjoy. A lot of the smaller changes are directly targeting newer players which are also high sec players.
---
So lets not pretend that CCP is only doing things for nullsec players because they're "the biggest". The burden of proof is on you for claiming nullsec has the "largest player numbers".

I've been using the tecnic1 screen name all the way back to one of the Command and Conquer games. I don't remember which one, but it was the one you had to direct dial into other dudes to play.  I was kinda into turntables at the time, and it was a variation of "Tecnics SL1200MK2" that was available and fit.
---
When I created my Eve character, I tried tecnic1, but I needed a space or some shit.  I was really into Hondas at the time, and had built a 1998 Civic Hatchback.  EK was the chassis code for that generation of Civic Hatchback.
---
Therefore, ek tecnic.
---
I was also important to me that it was all lower case.  It thought it looked better then Ek Tecnic.
---
I too would like to welcome OP to the end of living a "normal" life.

the whiplash on this sub is real

Pandemic loser gets caught.  Film at eleven...….  "Murica!
---
Rail Tengus have the range (100-130km in that fit) and instant application (after locking, obviously).  You could try doing something similar with the other T3Cs, but the Tengu is going to be the easiest to do this with due to bonuses, slot layouts, and so on.
---

So yeah.  Definitely. Eve is a lot lot lot more conductive to casual/limited playtime then it was in the past.
---
The cool thing about rorqs is that you can log on, go pop a rock in about an hour and make a 80-100 mil pretty consistently.
---
Also, being a ping warrior is pretty easy and doesn't take much time.  Even when I'm not really logging in much, it's pretty easy to just log in if I get a ping that interests me.

This all works best in one of the bigger groups, but if you are OK with that, can can tolerate being called a spodbrain, F1 monkey, ping warrior, or any of the other names people will call you, it can be fun and rewarding to play Eve for 4 or 5 hours a week.

Oh yeah. It's r/eve, it's hours of work but it'll almost certainly be downvoted into oblivion xD

I don't have any other game launchers installed that I'm immediately recalling, the only one with anything remotely like an ad is the Microsoft store which you can entirely circumvent using the start menu. I had to reach to get an example with an ad here. 
---
Every single one of these was taken from the screen that would be responsible for accessing the product, just like our launcher page where we access our clients.

I'm a dreadnought enthusiast myself. They get a surprisingly wide range of fittings and can pack enough power to take down large targets or fight whole fleets on your own. The siege module removes your option to coward out of a fight, which lets you focus entirely on actually *fighting* it, and makes it a lot more fun imo. 
---
&gt;I never noticed

TBH I only noticed it like a month ago. Was a good feature, though.

Clicked on the dropdown menu that lets me select CCP dev server, was hoping for an easter egg in there.

Some people have waited as long as 4 months without a response. Just gotta be patient n hope for the best.

Nothing points you in this site so if scared keep aligned especially in the third room with the triple web towers. Another little tip in the second room their is a structure you need to destroy to loot a key for the gate. Keep that key with your fit that way you dont need go bash the structure every time saving ya time.

Vpn bans seem to be popular ones too

I still love Hondas.  They are(were) great for learning how to work on and drive cars.
---
Clean cars from that 1990-2001 era are worth quite a bit now.
---
I had just bought a rice cooker, and the Spanish side of the box was showing, so i put a space in-between.

Random name generator cause I wasn't sure I'd stick around, then I got slapped with the reality that I'm not about to lose the three months of learning skills, support skills and getting a few T2 specced modules.

Yea ccp graphics...fml
---
Well, I honestly wouldn't give a fuck (as I don't now) because I can just ignore them. Just like I ignore ads on facebook or ads on reddit or ads on the washington post.
---
In the case of this launcher, I load it up, launch my client(s) and play the game. Problem solved.
---
Eh, they were good commuters. But the only Hondas I'd consider for myself are the (old) NSX, S2K, and the Beat.

My gearhead years began with MR2's so I became a bit of a mid-engined elitist :p

NICE! any additional reference is awesome. I periodically gank on the dock point in Jita and it is reaaaallly fast paced as most frigs that warp and dock only allow for time to see the scan results, but dont allow for time to copy/paste to evepraisal. Not that the in game amount is always accurate but anything to assist in those few server tics that they are vulnerable is much appreciated. 
---
\&gt;  there have been very few actual meta changing/content patches. 
---
"Read that part again"
---
How is ui adjustments not the same thing as a new launcher..... Non meta "boring" changes... Congratulations. You played yoself.
---
Not only that dude, but you LITERALLY used NECOMM changes as an example of shit they were doing that was boring... 
---
\&gt;  but because so far the Feb update is just "New Launcher and Neocomm!". Just makes for a very boring patch/update. 
---
Do you even know what your point is?

There is that guy that works as a middleman that is allowed to bring caps through highsec I think. I remember him having an Avatar in high a little bit ago.

Npc null is da bomb.

Glad to know you're okay with only 1/3 of a page being readable.

If you are EUTZ, come fly with us in The Weekend Warriors, limited time to play with us, assuming you are interested in pvp. Pretty much created for people exactly like you with limited time.

I too compare cars that cost at least twice as much when they were new.

im a fairly new player, but i was exploring wormhole connections around thera and came across another new player in a heron (i was in my astero) and i noticed he was about to jump into the thera hole without a cloak. i ended up chatting with them for a little bit and told them they should get a cloak before jumping through, yet they said they were feeling ballsy and i just have mad respect for that fellow new guy. i sent him some cash ive made from my exploration for a cloak and enough to replace his ship. about ten minutes later he let me know he made it 5 minutes before he was destroyed. i hope he goes far in this game.
---
Well I have seen some long time vets eventually skilling themselves into Caracals, but that should be a very long term goal. 
---
OK, I'm USTZ so have less of a feel for EUTZ.   
---
I've lived in Syndicate and now Pure Blind for most of the last couple of years, with a wormhole stint. NPC space is great. The rhythm of life, from a pve perspective, is more similar to wormholes - no sov null stream of green sites. Unless you are into super ratting, DED sites, explo, missions, and (if your group is more sedentary than nomadic) moons can generate plenty of isk for your pvp.   
---
PVP is definitely the reason to live in NPC null - you both can find smaller but meaningful fights, and engaging campaigns if you want them, under the radar of larger entities, and it's relatively easy to restage if a nearby goliath gets too unhappy with you. (Making a nearby goliath that unhappy is great fun). Blops and caps drops require a bit less logistics than they do out of a wormhole, where (at least for our group) we found that we ended up doing a lot more traditional roams.  
---
Depending on how close you are to lowsec, moving stuff in won't be too very different from sov null, and many established smaller groups will have some level of support for moving stuff. You also get used to the rhythms of your area and will know the times where you can usually gate around without too many regrets.

What always confused me was how to earn ISK doing FW.
---
You exchange LP, but what's the ISK:LP conversion? Is it easy or convenient to exchange? And I presume you simply get items to then sell at some nearby market, right?
---
While I'd love to try FW, I'd want to eventually work up to T2 fits or pirate fits. Bling the ships a bit. But the rate at which you probably lose ships - even if you're a decent pilot - would bankrupt most pilots. Did you find this to be a problem?
---
Do you mean CCP official tournament quality of filming?
---
Oh thank God.

I field tested this [https://pastebin.com/YfChYJfe](https://pastebin.com/YfChYJfe) on SISI, in theory it is possible with T2 reps and mindflood, or depot and unfit MJD for more cap.

I wanted “Gremlin” but it was taken or something. So I already had “Grem” written and there was this book on early US aero engines on the shelf, “Curtiss OXX”. And the name Gremoxx was born

I hadn't played an MMO for years, had 2 accounts in Star Wars Galaxies till Sony ruined it.
---
Then 2 years ago or so, I watched an anime series where the protagonist and his friends were inside an MMO (Not SAO). By the end of the series I was hyped a bit and figured I would look around and see what MMO's were about and maybe get into one. After doing some research, I found EVE, and made my first toon, Shiroe, named in honor of the anime character that inspired me to get back into gaming.
---
Well good news is there's about a 95% chance you will become overwhelmed  and quit almost instantly.... but that's not the worst thing.
---
The very worst possible thing that could happen is you like it .........................  and if you give it a chance, it WILL grab you by the pussy n never let go........ but luckily you will never buy another  game again .... ever ........... cuz now you're addicted to skins
---
N doing Skins will ruin your life !

See ya in another life brother! 
---
Short attention span and prolonged campaign don't go well together.
---
Oddly most of the 'ads' are actually news from the game. So really people are really upset that CCP wants to keep you informed about upcoming features and current events.
---
Shame  on them.
---
Kick the people in charge in the balls. The ones who are part of the botting/rmt circle. But to get that many people to turn around on their exec/leader is kinda not achievable.
---
The keybinding deal sounds nice if it works.
---
Fair enough. 
---
You could buy a clean EF shell for $800.
---
At no time was even the shittest MR2 anywhere close to that. 
---
I wanted an MR2, I was looking for one, but they were either (1), never affordable or (2), even if I could afford one, I couldn't afford to work on it, and that was what I really enjoyed.
---
I never got the superiority complex people had about their favorite type of car.  We were all just dudes working on and having fun with cars.
---
I knew a dude who got his grandma to give him a bunch of cash toward a NSX, and that shit was sweet.
---
But the dude who dropped a B20 VTEC in one of those EF five door wagons had just as much fun, and his car was every bit as interesting.
---
Ok this is hilarious xD Muss ich Testen xD
---
Well, you can use a tool like https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/ to figure out what the best thing to exchange is going to be. LP exchange rate depends on LP suppy and demand for navy items. Generally swings between 1k-2k ISK/LP,  sometimes hitting 4k  for Amarr militia after long droughts.  Exchanging can be a bit of a bother, but you do get ISK, so its  not too much of a bother. Filling up your blockade runner with navy drones or datacores is a good way to do it.
---
In practice,  you may run a large complex at T2, that pays 30k LP, rate is sitting at 1.5k, so you make 45m in about 20 minutes. T2 fitted Coercer costs 10m ISK, so that's 4 of those. A really nice succubus would run 400m ISK, so that'd be about 3 hours of plexing. 
---
Hype for sharing Fleet Broadcast Settings!
---
&gt;And because I know a few of you might be panicking right about now, I just want to reassure you that you can still El'Miner each other, but tricking people into joining that busy chat when they think they are opening a killreport might be a little trickier now that the channel link has a different color.

Loki. Versatile as hell and by far what I've flown most. I'm never not happy to be flying a loki.
---
more than the previous launcher could achieve and that wasnt even changing versions
---
or, hear me out...they could have kept the previous launcher that had a good ratio of ads to account space and not wasted resources in the first place.
---
ELI5?
---
As an alternative, persistent advert.
---
Oh, i get it. It's not the presence of ads, it's the usage of window space when you have heaps of accounts. Making the launcher wider just displays more simultaneous ads instead of more accounts, yeah?  
---
I think a lot of us don't have enough to fill up a full column, so we'd have never known. And that argument is being misrepresented. Or misunderstood. Good shit.
---
Sell them to NPC buy orders in CONCORD stations.
---
Out of Focus is recruiting btw.
---
You can get capitals changed with a petition. Only allowed name change.

And then? Sell for raw ISK? What are they worth-ish?

Are you 100% certain of that?

Always be nice to the clearly disturbed guy, and maybe you'll be spared when he eventually snaps.
---
Too much Space Station 13
---
The soft-cap mechanics of wormholes limit the size of engagements. With how much mass and the individual ship size you can put through gives some spice to engagements. To get ships in wormholes theres usually going to be a HS or LS connection down the chain.
---
The lack of local ads another level of strategy, you're able to be stealthy and have a gang cloaked up with you when baiting out a fight (although watch out, your opponents might have twice as many people cloaked up). 
---
If you're interested in joining a wormhole corporation, Out of Focus is recruiting. (Yeah shameless plug)
---
&gt; I didn't like the large fleets and 'blob warfare'/caps
---
This guy knows what we want!
---
why should i not capitalize on me being retarded for fun
---
That's literally all they are for. CONCORD stations have buy orders for 1000 survey databases at a time, buying at 100,000 isk each. They serve no other purpose, pretty much the same deal as Sleeper blue loot from wormhole combat sites but not as much isk and also fewer locations to sell to.
---
Okay, trolling u/Originalfrozenbanana aside...
---
EVE is typically compromised of well educated, strongly opinioned players, even if they don't always show it - it somewhat comes with the territory of making a game that non-ironically requires near autistic levels of commitment and analysis to get anything done.
---
It should be expected that people will make their views known. On something like the launcher, people should naturally expect a certain amount of ads, but what will really annoy them is where they feel that placing ads has taken precedence over time spent developing a product which they really want to use, or makes their life easier.
---
Lots of new pieces of software and games are launched nowadays with glaring holes, but you can guarantee that the microtransaction system works perfectly and the P2W advantage components have been made rock solid and tested extensively.
---
In this case, the launcher obviously had time spent delivering more ads, and people are rightly annoyed that there's a lack of any significant progress on making it a better experience.
---
Things like that annoy me, it's why I made https://notthelauncher.com/ just to show what can be put together in a matter of hours by a single person, and yes, it's none functional, but I decided against spending an excessively long amount of time on it, when the chance of it bringing about a change was minimal at best.

what's there to read...its a fucking launcher. Press start, play game.
---
While it looks nice and interesting, it lacks one key feature both old and new Launcher from CCP provide - ability to quickly start any specific accounts from the list. It might not be an issue for many players, but for me specifically, ability to quickly relog accounts to more relevant at any point of time characters is quite important, having to scroll through and look for what you need when only about 15-20% of account box is account specific, makes the design inefficient.
---
CCP approach with relatively compact account list is - at least for that case - just simply more efficient, with less mouse movement and more reliability overall; in fact, what would suit my needs best would be current account list approach with launch groups serving as tabs, preferably allowing per-tab account reordering.

I started with Kala and then just kept adding more vowels

However, encouraging people make someone kill themselves in a *very* public venue will only get you a 1 month ban.
---
When I started playing ESO a friend created an account to mock how he mispronounced Hannibal Lector one time. I decided to mock him by making Clarice Starling to a more high-elf sounding name.
---
Later, when I started playing eve I kept the name instead of using a name I normally use for games so I would not be recognized, Eve having the reputation it has.
---
shut the fuck up retard
---
yeah that's not new.
---
Such a design as this would skip needing to log into an account, and would jump straight to a character. Click on the 'Rorqual Pilots' bar and you'll see quick grouping which would provide what you said. 
---
Still better than beyblades
---
I just pressed random buttons until I had something I could pronounce. Unfortunately, its close to a common English word. Confusing comms for 13 years.
---
My very first non-Corvette ship, the Gallente Atron.
---
Why? Because they're cheap as fuck. I have at least 387 hulls of this ship across various stations, all over the galaxy, just so I don't have to fly the noob ship if I get blown up away from my home system. The hull is never more than 100k a pop, and it's not so fragile as to blow up whenever somebody decides to take a potshot at me. I'm a lil nobody hauling small size high value items around the galaxy for ISK, and my shiny cruisers and destroyers serve as the perfect distraction from the little Atron, which flies away unnoticed to safety, with the day's haul safely stored within. No joke, I have managed to save millions of ISK by flying in these tiny little ships. Best frigate EVER! 
---
Here's a quick GIF on what you should do: http://gph.is/XSLmxv
---
So I've been playing on and off for about a year and a half. I want to create specialized alts for things like mining, hauling etc.
---
I'm curious what do you guys use your alts for? I think I know what I need but I'm still very new. (For context I'm living in a WH and really digging it.)
---
skill u is legit. I like having battles that don't involve a dozen titans dropping on a sub cap fleet. lots of good content from those folks.

What are you talking about? Battle.net _literally advertises twitch streamers in their launcher_. The civ6 launcher advertises expansions. The Total War launcher advertises expansions. Every MMO launcher advertises their own products. You're delusional dude.
---
You mean the launcher that regularly dumped your account info and used an absurd amount of memory? That launcher?
---

and are somehow claiming that it should be easy to link this to an entire software ecosystem. Just hit the API - it's so simple! Obviously this is just an afternoon of work, right?
---
Just because you don't understand how it works doesn't mean it's simple.
---
Found this today in a C4. sometimes, eve is a special place.
---
Never had those problems myself. I have never lost an account from the launcher and I had 10+. As for the RAM usage, I never had a problem. Sucks for the people who did though.
---
Oh, didn't notice that part. How then you'd show the information we currently have - which account already has something logged, while giving the ability to force stop the client and relaunch it? I'm not expecting us having ability to relog without restarting client in near future.
---
And what about current option of waiting on login screen to minimize time between showing online and being able to control your ship? Difference between launching client into loaded grid and going from login screen to loaded grid is currently huge.
---
It was that and constant bitching about the bombers they bought off contracts
---
The old launcher was outdated, the new launcher has lots of good new functionality (like launch groups), is a more modern style, and probably includes changes on the platform side that we can't see, but improve its long-term viability and extensibility (though I'm just assuming that because any time a change this big goes live it generally is much bigger than the user can see). It's also a launcher. Who cares?
---
Thanks, having been an enterprise software dev for more than 10 years, the idea of a mockup taking less time than a full implementation slipped my grasp. Now let me just fire up my SSH connection, use my top secret CCP credentials, and add some bulk methods to the API.
---
Also, the API doesn't expose the account information to user applications... which you'd know if you understood how it worked.
---
people will disguise this kill mail in game as a joke, this mad lad printed it out. 
---
To be fair that's not necessarily a bad thing I burned out on ratting reqly hard and stopped playing for a few months now I just plex for 20 a Mont so I can afford my bs ships and stuff and having a blast playing again 
---
Fml I sold something similar over the weekend but spread across 3 or 4 lowsec stations lol :(
---
thanks
---
&gt; delusional 
---
I literally included screenshots of the pages for launching games, these are the launchers I use myself. 
---
Since you included an example for Battle.net I'm going to go find it.  
---
 Not a single game show a twitch stream, social needs me to join groups/chats, shop included stuff to buy(Jesus christ $30 for a mount in WoW, almost makes CCP SKINs seem reasonable), news is as the tab title implies and is news about Blizzard stuff and lastly the Overwatch League was information about that.
---
We're obviously using different Battle.net applications, mind sharing a screenshot? 
---
at least u are doing something (making an example launcher) most of the people on Reddit are just screaming into the void hoping a hand will pop out of it and beat them off.
---
Y'know what what he a good use of the new launcher? Advertising a fat subscription sale!
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Stop complaining about people complaining about a launcher.
---
&gt; How then you'd show the information we currently have - which account already has something logged
---
There's a few ways which you could do this. The easiest would be to either change the background colour of the character pane, or overlay some kind of graphic over the profile picture such as a playing icon. 
---
When the browser launches, its system process ID is known, so it would be quite simple for a desktop process to send a shutdown signal to one client and immediately open another one on the same account. 
---
SIGTERM it, check in a loop for the process to end, then launch the next one. 
---
&gt; The "Mine Repeatedly" function for drones is now simply called "Mine" and the single mining cycle option has been removed.
---
This gives me a hope that someday we can see that "Set Auto Repeat off" function removed at last...
---
I have to hope it has long term viability and sensibility. Though playing this game for a decade has made my cynical about "improvements"
---
wait I'm not supposed to 3x expanded cargohold my Charon and fill it with a million m3 worth of skill injectors?
---
A hidden old gem, Curzon Dax songs and any songs produced by the bee boys are usually of the highest quality
---
Are you on US servers? Maybe this is a difference in region. Because my launcher absolutely has ads in the US.
---
Actually yes! :D
---
But I want that for my XLASB
---
I was thinking more from UX perspective than technical solution - we already have client shutdown option from launcher, and the button for that is in exactly same place as "launch client", so you can just double click the button to stop and relaunch account. Due to that I'm not too big of a fan for separating characters in launcher while they're funcionally strongly bound to account - you can't have two characters on single account logged in simultanously, not having it as explicit info increases risk of potentially huge mistakes. Some solution might've been having a warning, but trying to - say - quickly restart 6 accounts to switch them from campers to preplaced dictor alts would be a chore.
---
I'm certain this is non-issue for anyone not constantly juggling their online characters, but for any case where relogging to different alt is faster/better/more reliable than moving around, keeping current reliable clean design would be very important.
---
*smiles disarmingly*
---
no ship changes at all 
---
zzzzzzzz
---
Sounds like content to me ;)
---
I should have noted that I was talking about Data/Relic Analyzers :)
---
are capital shiptoasts still allowed?
---
&gt; Shiroe
---
Log Horizon?
---
&gt; you can't have two characters on single account logged in simultanously, not having it as explicit info increases risk of potentially huge mistakes.
---
Hmm, that's a perfectly valid point.  It would make a lot of sense to also indicate other characters which were "unavailable" (or would cause someone else  to get logged out) due to already being in use by a logged in character. 
---
Or perhaps, if you're an enterprise software dev, you should appreciate a few other things.
---
1) The launcher project is shipped. It's in production. They aren't revisiting it in any large sense for a long time. 
---
2)  You're seriously arguing that CCP should have made a launcher more like the one you mocked up at the same time as you're clearly aware that the API doesn't support that functionality. So now in order to ship a launcher, CCP has to extend the API? To what end? What's the user use case - fire up the launcher and stare at it before going into the game? What regular use could possibly justify that many developer hours? You're implying that I don't know how the API works because I pointed out that you used fake data. That's a misunderstanding of my point. You used fake data because using real data would require extensive effort on CCP's part. Your mockup is unrealistic by design, and we're supposed to derive some meaning from it?
---
3) Your mockup doesn't add any new functionality that the new launcher doesn't already have other than display of character data. It takes a compact, account-level view and makes it into a clunky, character-level view. Imagine that view with 10 accounts. It would be nightmarish. But that's not the point. Somehow you, a super engineer with a decade of experience, seems to think that CCP didn't consider this option - because everyone else is incompetent, right? 
---
Seriously, spare me. Don't trot out your dev credentials like they're relevant when you're acting like every software engineer's worst nightmare. Armchair developers aren't cute. If you really think you can do better, apply to work at CCP and fix the problems. Otherwise I'd recommend using your lunch break for something more productive.
---
this post aged pretty poorly
---
Ya, same. I don't pve. Time = isk and I'd rather pvp. 
---
I play the game ...................... not the launcher 
---
I've seen the reviews CCP gets on Glassdoor... they couldn't afford my consulting rates. 
---
I don't actually use any of the products in Battle.net anymore so I'm not sure, if there's no Canada region I'm definitely set to US region. 
---
what's the reinforcement timer?
---
I have a few that do industry, few more that pull missions for mission blitzing and 1 capital alt. 
---
wow, so many morbid questions come up - were they aware of what was going on?  was it loud?  yeah, I'm a horrible person for thinking of these things...

Bully for you. I wish you great success in your chosen field of developing software by hindsight.

It's a very flexible ship (and it's gorgeous!). I fly mine from time to time but there's just not a lot of reasons for me to jump into it with my current in game goals.

Sometimes I just roam in it "just because". Mostly just because I love her.

on the other hand several hundred pilots fought every single day over SBUs and other minor objectives and there was basically a soul crushing lag fight every single week.

You're gonna be overwhelmed for the first month or three. Get used to it. Don't sweat anything, talk to anyone who will give you advice. If you get scammed and screwed over you learn a lesson. If you don't you learn a lesson. Join a newbie corp unless you hate yourself and want to work ridiculously harder than you have to.

Ask your questions there, for real. Be a bad ass sitting in null space your first week in Eve and then maybe ditch the newbies once you figure out where you want to go

Health readout for drones sound nice. In some situations I can't tell by looking if the drone is low on health or just the way I'm looking at it.
---
I looked on some of the other threads about this guy's passing. Apparently he just DC'd from eve and teamspeak and never came back. It doesn't seem like anyone knows exactly what happened.
---
I once made a clone with the idea of only doing pvp I named him Philmor Graves. Needless to say I never got around to doing anything with him.
---
Appreciate the reach out. Going to try to get through the tutorial tonight or whatever it's called and I'm sure I'll have some questions.

It's not cuts, it's changing windows

makes sense to complain about broken local or rubber-banding, but this whining about the launcher design is retarded AF.

I always wanted to make a character named Chance. As for Ravinne, I dunno, I wanted something that felt "Gallente" to me and that's the best I could do.
---
All my IRL friends/family think "Chance Ravinne" sounds like a porn name. 
---
Actually.. I'd rather have no launcher.. and have the game just fucking start when I click the icon to start it.. as opposed to click icon to start the launcher, then click another button to start the game.  
---
just my 2 cents.
---
The new launcher doesn't stutter and hang when launching multiple accounts that aren't grouped, which is pretty fabulous.
---
Until the Crack of Doom
---
But throwing money at it can for sure give you an advantage, and from my perspective that is pay to win. And though out all of this we haven't even talked about skill injectors.
---
Do you enjoy your 10 second align time?
---
If this is legit, then my condolences on the tragic passing of a fellow capsuleer.    
---
On the other hand, it always makes me uneasy when I see memorials put up using destructible objects. This is EVE after all. It's like putting up a snowman in a school playground and hoping the kids will read the plaque before knocking it over.

Hull tanked autocannon algos is my jam.

Well I was drawing a blank, hit a random name generator, and it was kicked back as already in use. Hit it a dozen or more so times, and then it settled on Millard, and I thought I hadn't seen that name in use before. Hit random on surname from the character creation window, and here I am.
---
HEY HEY HEY...we turned on ourselves long before Calmil left the wz.

I have been playing since 2006 so I feel you. I guess I am just okay with (given that this stuff takes literal years) with skill points ticking when someone is taking a break from the game. I am way more cool with that than people being able to farm, sell, and buy skill points with money, because this actually cheapened the 13 years I have put into my characters. 
---
OP can borrow my weenie, just needs to stay attached.
---
I mean sesms to early to call him dead?
---
Unless there was some real life confirmation(?)
---
Agreed, this is one of the best Little Things in a long time.
---
I remember I started and I wanted to name ships after Dota2 pro players
---
I think I kept it up like 10 days before I had lost too many ships lul.
---
sell order the expensive stuff, dump the junk to buy orders. some things will take a bit to get rid of but no too long. in the long run it is worth it and you'll only have to update like 10 orders max at a time. this is what i used to do all the time, personally i think it's the most efficient way of going about it.

They've been encouraging that since initial release. It's not part of the game by accident.

Are you implying that I haven't been playing eve? I've been around since 2010....and I'm no stranger to ganking in this game or any others....your response leads me to believe you may participate in such actions and hey go ahead! It's your game too!

My condolences o7

I would guess the original OP (u ipickednow) knew him IRL after meeting him in Eve, given that
---
* He said he hadn't played Eve in a year
---
* He addressed the deceased by name
---
* IIRC the obituary thread went up on Dec. 30 or 31, meaning
---
   * It's too early for a solitary basement dweller (the people he played with were completely blindsided, i.e. the thread was the first they knew about it)
---
   * Therefore the OP probably knew he died, either first-hand (e.g. roommate) or second-hand (e.g. family friend)
---
The answer to the question posed above by fwambo is probably either in private communications or not online, being sensitive to those near to the deceased.
---
Never said it was a new thing....I was just a little surprised that they added this in....but the real question is....can I still hide my shiny loot in cargo boxes and still keep the value unknown?
---
God I wish I could use a Chremoas (or the Caedus). I love cloaky bullshit. Had high hopes for the pacifier but it needs a buff.

It’s legit, his passing was posted a few weeks ago.

You have my sympathies :(

We lost 5 guys in 2011 during the "Fukashima Tsnunami"

There was a group of 7, two were working when the tsunami hit, all the others were playing eve together from their home. They all disconnected from our TS server and EVE at the same time mid conversation which was not panicked. We were informed by one of the surviving roommates that their apartment was a total loss, I don't believe the bodies were ever recovered.  
---
Seeing that it was a disconnect without notice, from experience I would say perhaps more of a natural disaster hit than a medical one.  
---
The world has gotten odd, especially for us old timers. There is a profound sense of grief that can be incurred by the loss of the voice through the computer. Play a game long enough and you hang out for days/weeks/years with people you've never even met, then suddenly- no more.

Pretty cool tribute to the deceased. I am sure he would be honored. Rest in peace.

I'd lose enough learning implants that injectors would actually be more isk efficient, and given the wide variety of skill training that's happening even at like 40m SP, the benefits of the remap aren't very big to begin with.

not much of a story, I use a similar screenname on xbox live and steam, just changed it slightly to be more of a Firstname Lastname format

This is glorious! TYVM.

We learned of his passing a couple of days later after he suddenly dropped off comms. Nothing too out of ordinary to make us believe something tragic had happen. It took us all by surprise and something we will always carry with us. Take care of one another and fly safe o7

Moving myself to a structure with a clone bay and always having to return home both take valuable time that I can't be arsed to dedicate to that shit

I mean, if driving an MR2 turns people into pretensionus dicks, I'm fine having never owned one.

I remember i was on vent with a guy who died of a heart attack while i was playing another game that shit still bugs me.    My condolences o7

---
&gt; Do you really want them to be using dev cycles (and yes, many teams would be involved in reworking the launcher) to rework the launcher instead of other shit they could be improving?
---
Uh, if they hadn't done that, people wouldn't be complaining.
---
And yes, people understand that some ads are on launchers, and accept it even though it's annoying. But the proportions are totally out of whack on the new launcher.
---
The previous launcher (which I still have open) has approximately 1/4 of the page as a list of links to news items (which are actually news items), 1/4 for a rotating set of adverts (mostly - the 'Onslaught Feature Tour' vid is there and is arguably not an ad), and 1/2 for the account list and useful info about the server. If I had more accounts, it's the account list that grows not the ads.
---
Screenshots of the new launcher show 70+% of it is given over to the non-accounts part to the detriment of actually being able to start the game with many accounts.
---
stop blaming the launcher it's fine every company's launcher is dedicated to selling their paying customers more stuff there's nothing wrong with it there's plenty of space to fit your mouse in to click on your accounts so what if they haven't made account labels yet now we have launch groups dont worry about 3rd party launchers being broken why would they even support that that doesn't make sense allowing someone else to interact with your game in a way that doesn't affect them in a way that theyve been able to for years better than ccp has with fewer issues is silly we don't need to maintain functionality we just need to stop complaining this sub is so full of knee jerk whiners where do I go for thoughtful discussion 
---
Sure but the statement itself doesn't become false based on that.
---
What I was getting at, and apparently being unclear is that the lack of value of moons ( oke let's be real moons are basically worthless right now ) keeps group that otherwise would commit regardless of the pleasure factor away along with the groups that like to fight so very little data is generated on improving the fights if the moons stay well worthless.
---

'More modern' often means 'worse, but you aren't supposed to complain about it'.

Thank you Aerlys for sharing , this is good for a start.

I didn't break ELUA even  if they think i did. I was accused of account sharing , which i wasn't .  I was just playing from internet caffe.

I probably can find the logs of me playing at the same time they think someone else did.
---
Doesn't matter how hard i tried to explain it to them , they just don't care. I want to do something that will force them to change their mind, even if it cost me some money.

I believe they can lose lot more.

EVE Pro Tip: When your ship gets blown up. *When*, not *if*, you will never whine about it to the people doing it. They **love it** when you do that. It is the very nectar of life, it is the mana they crave to move on to the next victim. N00b tears are like life’s essence to them.
---
The only thing to do when losing a ship [and I’m not going to say there won’t be those times when it’s really fucking inconvenient, because those times will be there], is to get a new ship and carry on.
---
Ships in EVE are Kleenex. You blow one, you get another.
---
Have fun, it’s beautiful, it’s huge, it’s mesmerising, it’s everything you thought a game could be and more.
---
Pro Tip #2: Is this guy trying to scam me? YES! Yes they are. Not a shred of a doubt about it. They’re trying to scam you. You may not understand how at first but believe me: they are there to scam you.

1. Lose ships

2. Don’t give anyone your tears

I'd prefer they didn't waste the effort on the launcher in the first place. 
---
We also lost Vile Rat in a terrible way as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Smith_(diplomat)
---
We cannot sadly. There are no player structures that cannot be destroyed in game. We asked if something could be placed in Mindful's memory in that wormhole on the undock where we last saw his probes. 
---
A while back I was having trouble remembering what time it was in eve, so setup a clock for a different time zone in windows for UTC that I named 'eve' that displays on my system clock when I hover over it.

You might find that useful, even after the launcher gets patched.

Pretty sure if anyone blaps this, they will be as infamous as the killsquad that trashed that in-game funeral for a WoW Player who died.

There is. We sent a 3D printed straitos memorial to his family. A plaque on it with jis RL name, ingame name and dates.

You can feed them into the biocaches for a lore datacrystal by attempting to open them instesd of destroying them. But it's only for getting some backstory on the trigs, no items that 'do' anything.

There was an obituary linked from his RL friend, and we even got a 3D printed stratios in his honour which was his favourite ship: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aigb0z/a\_little\_something\_to\_honor\_mindful\_visteen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aigb0z/a_little_something_to_honor_mindful_visteen/)

This is something that's annoyed me forever when exploring. I see a Talocan thing I don't recognise in this data can, is it worth 100k or 50m?
---
I don't think it will make any difference to CODE, they already know what the value of items in a cargo scan of a freighter is (and if they don't they can evepraisal it).
---
I think it's been proven time and again unless CCP absolutely *prevents* it that people will do what they want to do in this game.
---
Some people spend all day and night ganking ventures. There's no profit in that, but they do it.
---
Anyway, this change doesn't really help them with freighter or big kills anyway, as the in game estimate is often just plain *wrong* about things. ... And it's only a few seconds longer to evepraisal a scanned ship.
---
Especially when bumping a ship, the time savings of a few seconds from having an unreliable in game estimate vs evepraisaling it makes no functional difference. The ship can't run that's being scanned. If the bumper wants to, they can literally just keep bumping them all day long, scanning or not. The *bumper* gets to decide when they want to stop bumping them - there's no time limit or reason for them to care about saving a few seconds.
---
Just to clear any misconceptions - I'm not pro ganking. I'm a solo account hauler. I've mentioned before I'll never fly a freighter. I have very good *reasons* for that.

Are you serious? If anything this will lessen it a bit because they'll see it's not worth their time or ship. When have they ever done anything to *discourage* it? People are going to be dicks, and if you haven't learned that by now then EVE may not be your game!
---
Pretty much what everyone has said. I would say it could take a few days at minimum for them to respond. It is possible that you got banned by mistake, or inadvertently did something wrong. Usually you will not get perma banned for the first offense. You would get a warning ban of a month or something. You could always just make a new alpha account while you wait to continue trying the game out
---
What he said. I have no interest in doing anything whatsoever about "the bot problem" - that's CCPs job.
---
It's just some syllables thrown together that sound nice. In Eve I adjust my name to reflect the normal naming pattern of the races, and I use it as the family name for my alts (and my main doesn't have a name starting with A ...).

PL and TEST both respected a Provi monument citadel - ownership was transferred peacefully back and forth as sov changed.
---
I think the way to do this is to have citadels with no/few services that are transferred to the new owners and not used as staging/defense posts, etc.
---
If you're using it to fight, it's obviously fair game to shoot.  But if it's just there for a memorial and transferred the control of the evicting corp/alliance with each eviction, it could reasonably be respected by attackers.
---
We mostly respect coalitions in game even though they're not an in-game thing, no reason other than us that we can't respect memorials.

I keep looking at that to see if they change the recipe or the outputs, but so far they haven't revealed anything else.

According to Marrowbone the money was embezzled from around July 2017, however the Moderators only found out in December when there was a meetings and Marrowbone wanted to move away from the brand.

I cannot say for certain what happened to that money however the facts that i have are:
---
- According to Coffee Rocks, there was 2.7k in the bank in June 2017,
---
- According to Marrowbone, the charity was bankrupt in July 2017
---
If that money exists, I can't say, the charity didnt file income taxes for the past three years or release any other information.

Would you all be opposed to opening up a group chat on discord? I'm thinking the chat would be something no one idle chit chats in, but it's a quick way for us to communicate important things back and forth.

After I caught those 8 nyxes with Hotline I got lots of messages offering rather large amounts of isk to know exactly how those bots were caught.

Maybe some were fellow hunters looking to catch other supers, I find that rather unlikely.

Some did straight up admit they wanted to make their own bots better. 
---
It's disgusting but it's also reality. 
---
It's ultimately CCP's job to end botting, how they do so isn't for me to say. We should continue to report them in game and kill those that we can. 
---
That said if there's another local chat outage, VNIs and Gilas are on the menu!

Or read /r/Eve and decide to use any of the 10 threads up about the launcher instead of writing your own sob story. 
---
Oh shit that was you guys? We were hitting a structure when you guys passed through. Thought you were hired to defend it or something. We got sad when you left so we sent the ceptor after you and put in some of the carriers we had on standby. Sorry about your loss man.

yes it was on public access

"Oh, its not nearly as sociopathic as it sounds in the media... although I started playing eve after reading a story about a hit squad that spent a year infiltrating a man's group, earning his trust and becoming his closest advisors only to betray him, steal all his corporation assets, then blew up his prized faction battleship, and then killed the man and took his corpse to present to their client"

Snuff has the time to the second, dont worry.

Uhm, if you look at the bottom right corner of the launcher you can see how many players are online... Unless you have your launcher in full screen and it’s clipping through the bottom of the screen, I don’t know how you could miss that haha
---
I mean, it is a launcher, and people complain that it's making it more difficult to launch the game for them than before. I don't think that's unreasonable. While you complain about reddit threads, you have to keep in mind it's also the only feedback CCP ever actually reads and listens to.
---
On top of that,  there's a lot of people on this sub who prefer function over form or at least want function to come first, then fill in with form to makeit appealing. That's kind of polar opposite the "mobile design for everything, big flashy buttons and tuck the useful parts in a corner" mentality that's plagued UX design on pc ever since tablets started selling well. So when people are made to move over to something that's been designed to explicitly cater to people that are *not them*, it's not really surprising there'll be grievances.

That seems like a bad idea, if anyone ever wishes to live in that system they will HAVE to blow it up.

---
Clouds. You are missing clouds, you said it yourself. 
---
My unsolicited hot take on this:
---
Capital usage is currently in a good spot.  Supercapitals die all the time, even in the safest regions like Delve.
---
This semi-recent 'meta' of all the nullsec organizations having active supercapital umbrellas that they encourage their line memebers to take advantage of has essentially democratized everyday capital use.  Everyone ratting in carriers/supers/titans is better for the health of the game than everyone keeping them in their hangars and only using them on organized fleets that might be few and far between.
---
There is nothing wrong with an extremely well organized entity, fielding the real life equivalent of 10s of thousands of dollars worth of the 'best' class of ship in the game, and having no one be willing to N+1 them in a game that boils down to N+1, ending up with a very safe PVE environment for its members.  The fact that in Delve it boils down to 'you won't lose a ship unless you get REALLY unlucky or actively fuck up' isn't necessarily bad.  There are tons of activities in this game that have the same risk profile if done properly.

And so can anyone else who wants to attack them and their assets. That is the point I'm making. If it wasn't freeported then it stands a better chance of not getting blown up.

There are people I have spent more time with online than all but my closest family.  And besides trying to be a listening ear is all we can do.  Trying to help is definitely better than not trying 
---
Not going to quote every line but I'll answer each thing point by point.  
---
1. I haven't avoided any of your points.
---
2. It's not about wanting small gang to be easy. It's about the fact that since I started playing in 2011, the game has continuously made it safer and safer for krabs. Citadels in every system you can easily warp to, powerful mining ships that require a fleet to destroy, alliance only gates, cyno jammers, mining platform structures that defend you on moons and so on and so forth. And on top of that you have perfect intel from local. "just join a bigger alliance" is not a solution. This is lazy.
---
3. Okay let's do a middle ground. I just listed a number of things in your favor. Local, citadels, alliance gates, cyno jammers, mining platforms with defenses, super capitals that can tackle anything 5000km away to start off. Find me the middle ground by getting rid of half of those. I look forward to your negotiation offer.
---
4. So your tools for small gang players is "just join a bigger group." So in essence "play the game my way." That's your recommendation? Be some F1 krab drone.
---
5. Okay let's talk about mechanical advantages: I don't have 95% perfect intel on where to hunt. That's extremely vague and meaningless. As an attacker I have 20 some anoms to warp to and hopefully the one you land on is a target...a target that isn't prepared because he's already been told by an intel channel I've been coming from 15 jumps away, and who isn't already prealigned. Where is the advantage there? Using a spy character isn't a "mechanical advantage." Local, alliance gates, citadels, those are. Nothing is stopping the krab from fitting his ship to pvp and ratting. He loses some efficiency ISK making but that's still his choice. He also has all the aforementioned advantages. The defender has to set up infrastructure for his advantages and I don't for mine? I don't have any advantages. I have nothing more than what the defender has in game. "Having to krab" isn't some disadvantage either. It's making you money. And you end up your last point "use numbers." So again your argument is to play the game in a lazy fashion as you.
---
6. Addressing the loss of activity in space and risk/reward. There's no reason to believe there would be less activity in space. Maybe less krab activity, but certainly more pvp activity. Hell the dynamic would probably even shift more from pvper vs krab to pvper vs pvper. That'd be nice. As for risk and reward, the less people who attain a resource the more valuable that resource becomes. If half the people stop mining spod, and you have half as much spod on the market, guess what happens to the value of spod? It goes up.  
---
Let me know if I haven't addressed any of your points. I believe I have.
---
The clouds are being missed by you.
---
What were you expecting? The game isn't exactly swimming in exciting content. It's known for its' boredom (after blobbing, griefing, stealing, etc). I mean, it isn't like /r/eve in 2018 was all that interesting either. It seems like the bulk of this is the usual bragging up gate camps, wars organized as in-game play-dates, weak attempts at eve elitism (or whatever passes for that), posting favorite ships make in MS Paint, high sec/ low sec/ null sec complaining about high sec/ low sec/ null sec being bad/ broken/ awesome and crying about why other players don't play the game right (pronounced"play like I do or you're wrong"). It's all the usual stuff.
---
What did you think was going to happen? Without some kind of major new content, huge changes to mechanics or some amazing new motivator for undocking there won't be some kind of new excitement in /r/eve. I'm not putting you down or anything. I understand how disappointing the game and/or community can be at times. However, unless something actually changes, everything will stay the same.

I did this in a passive shield VNI. Burn away from web towers and kill them first in the last room. Last room is the only real hard pocket imo

ahh i remember mining in those all day back in 2009
---
The in-game valuation is and has always been wildy off on too many items for it to be trusted. No matter how user friendly the UI might be, it's still shit data. Good try though!
---
Fuck off who cares
---
Eh, kinda. More like automod nuked it, a mod saw it and went "meh no point in approving this its hours old" and that was that. Probably should have just approved them anyways though - you're not wrong there.
---
I never thought I'd see the day where you brought something up and it actually highlighted a problem in a productive way - but here we are. This is something we can probably fix.
---
My son literally claps all day and I don't really hear it. Only when it's brought to my attention or I am trying to listen reallllly intently to something and I go, "why the fuck cant i... oh right, the noise machine"
---
If everyone is a spy, then no one is not a spy.
---
The best knowledge source is gonna be actual players in game. Don't be afraid to ask in Corp chat or get in voice chat. Most players in eve will take a minute to explain something to you. Sometimes it's after blowing you up, but it's still good info ;) 
---
Yes I do - that's how i mined for my first covetor.
---
At this moment aside from that structure the hole is empty. so a beachhead for someone wanting to evict is kind of a moot point, but i see what you're saying.. We left it as a memorial, nothing more. 
---
Its convenient when the freighter has 40 items in its hold.
---
Welcome to Eve, hope you have fun here.
---
Not sure where the profit comes from in this scenario.
---
Look at the gate and then the space around it, sometimes there are moons or asteroid belts or even structures within 14au of the gate. Warp to one of them and dscan the gate. If it's just the gate, warp jump the gate
---
careful, we only tolerate legitimate complaints for 1 day on this sub, and that was yesterday 
---
Did I? You don't seem to agree.
---
All they need to do is let us fold up the news feed and we're happy.
---
Just let us minimize it for more space for accounts, for fucks sake.
---
I would like to be in a corp where someone would notice if I just died and never showed up again.
---
Thank you.  Dragging it didn't work, but eventually somehow the window did eventually move out of full screen to regular window mode allowing me to reposition it enough to see the left side of the launcher.
---
But, the left side isn't visible because the window was full screen...and there was no obvious way to move it nor any scroll bars.
---
In my, and you want to trust me on this one, elaborate experience as a miner, I have never known a ganker to need an excuse to gank me. They do that with or without the promise of ph4t l3wtz.
---
7 guys warp in to the belt. I’m far from the warp in point. They’re all shooters, heading my way [I am aligned, obviously, I saw them coming in (I don’t AFK mine)], I was out before they could get a hold of me. Why do 7 shooters come my way? To cover me in kisses? Maybe, it could be.
---
The guy in the Maelstrom who flew protection for the mining crew in Providence, who decided this was the night he would AWOX us and who, *of course* blew up my Hulk [that was #5 or #6].

The CODE creature who fucked up my Mackinaw [it hadn’t paid back for itself yet]. I was back in a Mackinaw [with a better tank *grin*] 20 minutes later, in the same spot. CODE can go fuck themselves if they think I’m going to change my ways.
---
The guy in the Raven who didn’t have quite enough fire power to try and blow up the Hulk before Concord came to fuck up his shit. I came back with a salvager to loot his boat **Ha!**
---
Just off the top of my head. There are many, many, many similar stories. So much fun :-).
---
I’m not complaining about it. It’s my story in EVE. It’s not better than anyone else’s, but it’s my story. I’ve not known gankers to need an excuse. They only need to be in range.
---
Red Alert 2 has the best one IMO.
---
It wasn't obvious how to resize the window...there was no scrollbars and normal mouse/clicky things didn't work...but yes, I do have it working now.  I still don't see any benefits of the change.

Eventually the structure will die, we know that. When it happens, it happens. 
---
It is not in our hole, it is in the hole that he was in, at the exact location he dc'd. The structure is freeported, but if someone wants the hole, we will give them the Rait asking them to keep the name. Whether this happens or not, will remain to be seen. 
---
Does BRAVE still fly Talwars? It was our signature doctrine in the early days.
---
Not to be elitist but what's the resolution on the screen? Is it a small screen or an actual issue? 
---
I'm going on my recollection of when it was posted in the link above, but I believe that his widow reached out to some of his corpmates with confirmation.
---
Nah, if someone wants the hole we are happy to give them the Rait free of charge and ask them to keep the name. Whether this happens or not will remain to be seen. But then they can make it non dockable to all. 
---
Most of that is older news items, those stretch back for  years no doubt. The game has been around for a while now you know...
---
Don't be afraid to try out several different corporations to find a group you like to fly with.
---
It's possible that it doesn't refer to anything specific and is just future-proofing.
---
Indeed, thank you for being transparent. It’s great people want to donate to a good cause, this hits home for all of us. If B4R is to take donations they should really set up the proper non profit paper work and have the money accounted for. I’ve see this happen to different organizations, most recently a alumni fund for a school I attended. If this is to work, When you accept money from people you assume accountability for said money. Everyone should feel hesitant donating until these basic guidelines are met.

there isn't actually enough isk to cover the order, so they sell almost enough of that item at some inflated price to make that buy order seem reasonable/a great deal but when you go to sell to the buy order it fails due to not enough isk in escrow since with level 5 Margin trading allows you to make a Buy order and only put down 75% of the isk so if the buy order has a  quantity of 4 they can set the minimum units required to 4 but only have enough isk in escrow for 3 causing the order to fail.

Unless they're bombers.
---
Find something you think looks interesting and go for it. Small scale pvp sound fun? Faction Warfare could be up your alley, but it's a little stagnant at the moment. Maybe the idea of flyi g around all stealth like sounds fun, then train towards Covert Ops/Stealth Bombing.
---
Remember this though, just because you see that you can jump into a battleship with a few days worth of training does no mean you can FLY it properly. You will need to train various other skills up to get that ship up to an acceptable point.
---
Looking for a new player friendly corp doing stuff you want to do is huge.. ie, joining a mining corp will be bad if you want to do wormholing or pvp.
---
You will lose ships. Any ship you fly will be lost at some point in time if you're flying it. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose and don't be too hard on yourself when you do lose it. Sometimes a loss could have been avoidable, and you'll learn what to do next time.. Sometimes they're unavoidable.
---
Also, avoid "Fire Sale" or "Hanger clearout" contracts. Scams. Also, "send me 15mil ISK and I'll double it." is a scam too. :)

The Raven, particularly with the Hunter's Quiver skin, is a beautiful striking shape. I wish they'd stop making Caldari ships symmetrical.
---
I like a lot of the Caldari ships. A cormorant can provide fun times for almost no cost. And for practicality in PVE the Gila and Rattlesnake take some beating.
---
If you hate blob, if you hate super/titan fleet, if you hate capital dropping on you when you do small gang, join fucking space made for your playstyle : Wh

I am so glad that people know that this isn't me...

---
For sure, but still true - FC's see the F1 line members as drones and why wouldnt they! They act like them - shooting the wrong targets, randomly going off in the wrong directions and just freezing the minute the FC dies when they are left to fend for themselves. 
---
Caps are 2010 cruisers and supers are the battleships... Similarly mining ships. Orca is the new Procurer, everybody else uses Rorqs.
---
I'd love to see T2 caps. Would give oldbros something to skill for and cut insurance payouts by 95%.
---
Talwars are pretty common. However given how much we try to focus on fun and encouraging newbro's to join in on activities with whatever they've got, most of our roam fleets are pretty "kitchen sink" (which is why we joke so much about having nothing but atrons). Things are different though when it's an official fleet/deployment.
---
No. The stuff in them is junk and you can earn your own pretty quickly. Some bundles are worth it, but not the newbie ones
