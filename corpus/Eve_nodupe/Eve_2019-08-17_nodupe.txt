A scout without a disruptor is pointless.

Light inital cyno with the tankiest thing to hand, jump in a buffer fax, light cyno on fax, everything jumps to fax. Every super/titan has its own cyno fit and can light if needed.
---
Just started out in the game and am doing the career agent's missions. One of them took me into a system that had been invaded by an event, where I was instantly destroyed by some enemy. Is there any way for me to get my ship back? Thanks
---
Now they get to do both at once.
---
Now you will have to jump your fleet into system 2 hours before a fight (thanks tidi) and then try to align and warp to your target (And pray only have your fleet disconnects)

Can you explain your logic here? What exactly do you think does this make great for lowsec? Capital hotdropping isn't really a thing in lowsec, is it? So what changes, except no more newbie-ships/t1-frigs opening station-cynos?
---
How did you mess that up
---
surely wormhole man (btw) is not as bad as you purport him to be
---
I'm going to evict you.
---
Yes, and that's a good thing. IF you want to bring in reinforcements it can only be done with specific ships. According to your logic, why don't all ships have a jump drives? Arbitrarily it's not an issue, they could add them to all ships. And the answer is: because it would be unbalanced as hell and completely terrible.
---
With the changes IF you want to use cynos, you had better bring the right ship type for it and the cloaky recon and covert make good sense for this. Could they arbitrarily choose more or other ships? Sure but they choose these because of their sneakiness, to give them some sort of extra use (they're kinda low on the picking order right now) and it forces you to commit to it with less risk or random "enjoy your gift" hot drops. And BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO RESTRICT CYNO USE
---
They did it BECAUSE they wanted to restrict it so anyone going  "here's some invalid logic as to why it could/should be less restrictive" is missing the point and also being disingenuous, it's not valid logic or reasoning, it's not "for the betterment of the game". You just don't want to lose what you have and CCP is going "HTFU".

OK sure..

nope, nestor wont passive tank a tristan, unless fully regen or shield tanked

Hello everybody and welcome to anything night of The NullBear Thread on What's Wrong With Eve and Who is to Blame.
---
Tonight's special- some dude blames "Icelandic mentality" for ccp's Chaos plans. https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/crbwmm/-/ex3rfgo
---
More at... Well, everywhere in this thread! :)
---
Fighters are barely a threat to any proper 20+ man gang flying with 2+ logi and people who can press the broadcast button. 
---
Mostly they serve as a temporary damage reprieve and kill mill generator to say “we tried to kill a super before they pressed the button and dropped 12 faxes 8 supers and 34 titans on our 24 person kikimora gang.
---
But you bothered to respond.
---
You don't know what the OP meant. You are assuming this. I'd rather have clarification.
---
It was a more recent change (2-3 months ago?), understandable
---
My small group is thriving because of these changes.

Nice post.

Amen :)

Well, that and because of social media people are rapidly forgetting how to speak the language anyway.
---
I guess things might have changed, but I still wouldn't put a French GCSE that you've studied for for two years on the same level as the equivalent qualification in English in countries where you've studied it since you started school
---
&gt;its funny how everyone is speaking the "hardest" one then.
---
That's on those tea-drinking island assholes tbh.
---
Don't get me started on misuse of apostrophes.  Makes me want to scream every time I see someone use 's to pluralize a word.  It is so bad that it is starting to show up in professional documents and media articles (which have gone to total shit, like editors don't exist anymore).
---
What were you thinking when you made that investment?
---
For a "new player" you sure know a lot about the game.
---
Your ending statement was awesome. Increase the risk and increase the reward for being in space. If the ratio gets skewed, kill the isk efficiency or the safety.
---
I think you're missing the point
---
ramm one other and ram the roid's
---
Correct they spawn differently
---
And a single anom in null isn’t several hundred million isk.
---
And there’s more people in null and infrastructure
---
Lots of differences.
---
You think Hard Knox got all their money by “not being able to farm” ?
---
yeah pretty new change
---
I quit Eve every day, right before I go to sleep.
---
same for mining ,  you ram the roid and it drops  ore that you pick up.
---
Newbros do not need to be able to make that much isk in nullsec. Starting breathing through your nostrils before you get dehydrated
---
Have you been to low sec recently, it’s hot drop o clock no matter what area.
---
Balance in it's truest form i guess
---
Are you in the right thread?
---
&gt;  the first thing should be to stop them from getting destroyed in wreckage.
---
Hasnt the plex vault existed at least since the change from 1 to 500
---
They got thoroughly trounced. So i can't really agree.
---
I entirely agree with #1 &amp; 2, however the issue is that currently caps are the answer to everything. 
---
They are faster, less risky, project better, insure better than T2 subs. 
---
Now, the upcoming cyno change MIGHT put a dent in their risk/cost efficiency. Personally I’d rather they could not cyno straight into a combat grid.
---
So you're gonna sit your entire fleet in the middle of a bubble that the entirety of could be hit by bombs and wipe your fleet? I guess that's just personal preference, but I don't see that being a good idea.
---
  
---
Every system has the potential of dozens of warp in vectors. Perhaps a smaller chance of reacting on regular carriers, but with a super or a rorqual? More than enough time to warp to whatever you can find to get a better warp in. All you need is one safe spot out of the typical plain and you got a good warp vector.
---
You are the one harrasing me if anything, just stop being so salty.
---
I mean you can do it in a matter of hours if you actually enjoy grinding isk, I would never recommend a new player treat a game like a well below minimum wage job though.
---
Given the variability of spool up cycles/effects that were discussed, I don't know if that is a valid scenario to prove that spool up was a bad idea in general.
---
That said, spool up wasn't even the best idea that was thrown out, but at least in my mind it offered counter play/trade offs/etc...  The stuff that has always made eve a bit more interesting.  This current change, its balance impacts aside, feels like it is going to force players into a very linear progression and make things less interesting.
---
This. Tons of orcas have died to recon damaviks in high. Being AFK is just not going to work anymore which is fantastic.
---
New doesnt mean I dont spend fuckloads of time on the eve university wiki. It's literally the only game thing not banned at my school wifi cuz the school firewall thinks its educational.
---
And to be fair, i spent all of yesterday being coached by a player i met who was helpful. My entire venture out of Concord space i was asking questions, and was basically taught what planetary interaction and WH space is.
---
Combat stuff is easier to understand, while I had to be coached for an hour on how I needed to dscan when I went into the wh and needed to bookmark it and had to be taught to read its description to learn if it would close soon or had people go through. 
---
I was in a Corvette because my effective net worth is 17mil isk, and no implants, so I didnt mind dying. It was entirely a learning experience for me.
---
It triggers you enough to come back here and write a reply every time. Thanks for your concern salty boi. Stay cute, stay salty. After these posts I decided to just stalk you around forever and keep collecting your salt. It is a like salt mine in here. Great stuff, keep it up.
---
Then what exactly is the point of carriers and fighters? To apply to battleships?
---
It depicts a narrow vision - didn't CCP have an entire shtick about not being able to anticipate where players were going to take the sandbox?  Isn't what they are doing trying to pigeonhole players into a specific play style?
---
Most likely not, but you can try to send in a support ticket, see if they are lenient because you are new.
---
Trading is the highest income you can make in the game.
---
Was this some kind of morale boosting titan awox? We are dying to know.
---
They be cloaking you see
---
I don’t think you’re seeing the bigger picture here past your capital hull. There are some people whining about their Loki fleet etc. However, the real issue is that in many regions of space, caps have entirely replaced subcaps because of how fast, cheap, and risk/isk efficient they are. 
---
I think the fast response time in caps is what needs to be balanced/nerfed via cyno. Instead, it might cost you a recon is all, and maybe not even that if you instead use a brick tanked Blops and jump a fax to it immediately.
---
Then, perhaps even buff caps up to have more of an impact. Their insurance should also be nerfed imo, increasing the weight of dropping it on whoever without backup.
---
Certainly... but that's more a matter of just turning the Item into the Currency you can spend in the PLEX store.
---
What I'm saying is that if they really wanted to respect PLEX as being literally valuable for the cash money they represent, they could do as OP suggested and stop scamming with them. But they should do something about the Killmails first. Every time someone dies with a hold full of PLEX, and the Loot Fairy says no... that's pure profit for CCP. They didn't have to provide any game time, or any Skins, or anything else from the PLEX store. They just pocketed the cash that those PLEX represented, with no return to the players who paid the cash.
---
&gt; blops
---
&gt; not made of paper
---
Sure, compared to a bomber I guess..
---
You can afford a 300m ship, how often can you afford it being killed?
---
Getting shredded by a frigate gang without being able to even hit one of them is much, much more likely in lowsec than being dropped on.
---
As an outsider to null, I’d say that capitals are able to respond far too quickly directly to a combat grid via cyno which is mainly why they’ve effectively replaced subcaps. Instead of the upcoming cyno changes I think making the ship jumping TO a cyno land off grid would be a very impactful change.

The video quality is crap, but it was the first time I was involved in a fight that evolved/escalated.  I still love how fights can change on the fly.  In this particular fleet, we found a POS that wasn't fueled and it slowly ramped into a small subcap battle.
---
A new player can’t grind the isk to plex in “a couple hours”
---
I read that globular clusters are low in the heavier elements, meaning that its harder for rocky planets to form.
---
But you are ignoring the major aspect of the change and arguing a small side point. Logistics is a spurious issue to this change, the main thing this does is eliminate/reduce capital umbrellas. You can't solo rorq mine and simply light a cyno of something happens. That's a huge hit to major alliances and has no impact on small groups that doesn't have cap umbrellas.

And the guy thanked you for correcting it and you are so attuned to wanting there to be more that you turned it into something it wasn’t. Correcting information is beneficial in reducing confusion
---
Basically you made an error, someone drew attention to it and you got butthurt
---
I'm not sure you should be able to stealth with a beacon that lore-wise is visible across the universe.
---
There are both positives and negatives to blackout - the big thing is that it removes the ability to talk to the locals and get to know who lives in a specific area or region.
---
You also lose the sense of community from talking to the people who live in your system, you really have no way of knowing they are there unless you actually see them in space.
---
It's a loss of a sense of community - and I'm sorry but it's the social and community aspect that keeps this game alive.
---
There are benefits, however:
---
* We can continue to use the same smartbombing characters (or titan pilots) without roaming gangs being able to tell that they are set up in waiting.
---
* You have no way of knowing if an infamous/famous hunter is in the system cloaked off your target waiting for you to show up.
---
* You have no way of really knowing just by going into a system how many people are out in space, and it's hard to identify known easy/juicy targets.
---
* You penalize smaller groups who rely upon being a scary 'cloaked' presence in systems to influence target behaviour.  It used to be I could sit a cloaked scout in a system and the only people going out were usually the idiots - those who don't engage with the community, or even those who are over confident.  Cloaky camping was an effective tool to soften up a region prior to attacking it, or to influence botting/ratting behaviour.  Now?  Not so much.
---
There are other aspects, but those are off the top of my head.
---
this. I'd be more ok with all the LS caps if NPC factions would also drop on non-aligned player caps in their space.
---
Really? So that's why a few others did so in a completely different manner and I got "butthurt" with them as well? Don't patronize me. It's not hard to see when someone is being sarcastic.
---

almost nothing, 1m sp isnt enough for Cyno 5 (for covert cynos) or racial cruiser 5 (for regular cynos on cheap racial recons).
---
For 1m SP you can train into an Enforcer and Cyno but i'm sure the prices on these will go up as more people figure it out. If you want to cyno for cheap though you will need more SP
---
I dont know too much about how alliances or corporations work, but cant you see if a group has structures/allegiance in a system?
---
Or did you mean the mere presence of Boba Fett-alike pilots who are well known is oftenly early warning?

Afaik the ingame simulation shows the base damage and not the spooled up one.

Blinkers in British English are something you put on a horse to stop it from getting distracted by things to the side or behind it.
---
At least I assume that's what he's talking about and not indicators on a car
---
No, there isn't. The standard rule of thumb in this game is to not undock anything if you're not prepared to lose it.
---
I recommend avoiding Triglavian-invaded systems if you're not prepared to fight them.  But don't worry. If you're doing career agent missions, the ship was cheap enough that it's pretty easy to replace even with the amount of ISK that you can reasonably make.
---
Big blocs being compact is the exact opposite of what you need.
---
What I am asking you is why is it more balanced that only these two ship types have cynos? What significant advantages do other subcaps have over the selected two when it comes to solving the issue of super umbrellas being so oppressive? Simply eliminating cynos from capitals solves the biggest issue which is cynos that you can't possibly kill in time under a lot of circumstances. The underlying issue that you point out as being unbalanced "cynos and insta travel" are more or less equally balanced out by restricting them from capitals as they are by restricting them to the two ship classes. With two possible exceptions which are interdiction nullified ships and HICs/Dictors.The only other argument would be cost, but for people that have the big oppressive super umbrellas the cost of a recon is no big deal and in a lot of cases allowing them on cheaper ships would just mean the cynos are even easier and quicker to kill. You can't just handwave restrictions as being mechanically better just because they are more restrictive if those restrictions don't actually achieve any meaningful difference in solving the problems as compared to a less restrictive set of changes.
---
Cloaking 5 doesn't do much except let you lock a fraction of a second faster on a couple of ships.
---
&gt;The only mechanic that makes nullsec more dangerous than lowsec is bubbles
---
And bombs, and DD's.

---
Well known pilots that prey on wandering fleets gave me a clue as to what to watch for.  Specific pilots are known to pilot BFG titans - if I can't tell they are in system I can't know ahead of time which tactics to use to avoid them.
---
Specific pilots are known to fly blingy crap, and are known not to respond correctly to attacks - are typically afk.  Look for the people that always lose excavators to rats.  Those are the targets I like to prey upon, because half the time they are AFK or asleep, and it makes it easy to kill.
---
You can see who has structures in a system, but what if they've moved on and it's all structure spam from last month that isn't even used anymore?  Abandoned citadels are a menace.

billy lies about being a good poster
---
My man. The thing youre missing here is that caps cant really jump all that far. Every jump now requires a potential cost of several hundred millions. If you need to jump one as far as I have more times than I can count then the price of the cynos alone might surpass the price of the ship. Thats leads to stagnation.
---
Yes, exactly so. Why should Goliath care about David? This is the part I dont get. Why should a couple of people dictate the playstyle of the larger group. Because of nostalgia? Of a misconception that they can actually hurt the bigger group? Im asking you, where is the fun in it for us?
---
So no reply then? Okey thats what I thought. Your entire premise is based on something that only exists in your head. Shocker.
---
&gt;Its brought so much more depth to the game for me, and makes me think that I, a small player, might be able to for once survive in null against the larger players.
---
how has it brought more depth to the game for you if that was your only time venturing into nullsec or even experiencing nullsec pre-chaos? This is what we call a biased opinion as you have no experience outside of chaos.
---
Coming from you Ill take that as a compliment. Run along.
---
This change is a double-edged sword it makes the game less dangerous in some ways and more dangerous in others. Unfortunately, I see it having a very suppressive effect on both dreadbombs and big cap/supercap fights which undeniably makes the game less dangerous. My whole point of the post was maintaining the difficulty of bring caps everywhere as cynos will still be reasonably squishy regardless of which subcaps they can be fit to. (In many cases more squishy if they are allowed on most subcaps.) I am simply sugesting a tweak to the change that helps mitigate some of the annoying logistical/cost/SP issues with the change. I don't think my suggestion would be much if any of a buff to the large blocs/super umrellas.
---
Eve was never intended to be a free game, if you like it enough to make a post like this come up with the 15$ for a sub.
---
Well for me. For me, the depth was: "Dont even go to null. If you do, join a corp." Period.
---
Now I have a reason to.
---
But I like actually being able to respond to stuff now. I've heard of campers who respond spookily fast or ambushes and ganks ending faster than half the time I would consider myself able to react.

All I meant was it makes me actually feel safer in the game.

Why is this hidden? Hm if someone pays 3b or more that could give a bit less than a billion. That'd be okay. Back in the days I figured training many chars to 5M would be great, but I didn't think through how much multiboxing I was gonna do. Having chars on the same account take more time that's for sure but it's way more sustainable

Please come to delve, catch, esoteria, and then see if your opinions are still the same.

Did they change cyno duration from 15 minutes to 10 minutes in the recent past?
---
I always warp to cynos to try to kill the cyno ship.  Am I doing something wrong?
---
But telling other people they should be paying more because they played the game a long time is strange.
---
With a month of eve sub, you can buy many older games on sale and if you find one that you enjoy, you'll spend hours on it. The games I've spent 1000 of hours didn't cost more than 10€ (cs:go, garry's mod).
---
I get it, if you're working in a good country, $11 a month is nothing. That's a meal out. That's two drinks at the bar. Now if you're tight on money and not doing that it's something else.
---
Also, eve is way more enjoyable with two accounts for quite some people. This double the price you pay when starting out
---
Yup.
---
Moot point from both of us anyway. Again the two things you're referencing are only similar in the sense they're both NPC events, they're not even the same NPC faction. Downvoting me doesn't really change that
---
The fight looked fun. Thank you for the screenshot.

Wow. It's weird to think you guys get to fight/meet in null so much you can recognize by name

Unfortunately no kill mails, we went through scalding pass into detorid saw a small frt fleet which test had been poking so we decided to join, they formed up pretty hard, 20 mins later after trying to bait each other Hyperion jumps through we agress, big mistakes we got baited and it was GG from there 😂
---
Oh yeah, that's mine.  I totally forgot where I parked it and lost the keys.
---
Ever have a night like that?  Well.  Happened to me.  
---
Just contract that on over to me.  Thanks.
---
We already have a combat rorqual though
---
You do know...cloaky camping on a plex is a thing, yeah? Those require no cynos, yeah? The days of roflstomped by a cap is still gonna happen....cyno or not, isn't going to change that.
---
If snuff wants to drop their rorqs, they'll just adapt and tackle you in a tanky t3d, warp in a recon and light...this won't change crap for the meta you're talking about.
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/4028/iskValue/1000000000/
---
LOL - "capital hotdropping isn't really a thing in low sec". So cute.
---
Reasonable amount of ISK = 100-120mil/hr....
---
Dude, you have no clue what this game used to be.
---
Supers arent 200+ a tick. Its 100. So 300m/h for a super that costs around 15-20b. Incursions in HS is 200m/h for maybe 200m-5b, its a group activity so you can get in with the 200m and make that isk. Pulling runners in ls which requires less isk but more alts is maybe 1b/h. Your example of the Nag. Thats one hour to break even.
---
And the pilot isnt able to do that for a prolonged period of time. 
---
But my man, in theory yes. In reality we have been seeing deflation and not inflation. Pretty much every item has become cheaper over the years and not more expensive. The same reason why people are complaining about caps is the very reason why more isk isnt creating inflation, they have become much much cheaper.
---
This is why the main reasoning behind the faucets thing is faulty. It actually has to make a difference outside of a few niche products to be treated as public enemy nr 1. And the fact that the isk is spread out means you have tons of new players being able to catch up in SP and remain involved in the game, which I have seen happen tons of times. This is why the retention numbers even are as high as they are, people felt the catchup mechanism was somewhat working.
---
The Rorqs problem is that its the single most OP ship in the game. It can do too much too well. The easist way to fix it is by removing excavators. That will drop the income to around a Hulk level whilst still costing much much more. That will remove its incentive and it will do what its mean to do, be a booster. Compression should stay in such a scenario. And if people still wanna multibox them then fine. But that is without the blackout.
---
Observatories have existed as placeholders for years. A CCP dev even said that nothing of the sorts is planned. Half of NS use d scan but there is a reason why the meta has become cloaky ships, d scan wont do shit. And unlike in WHs that single ship you cant scan wont be able to open up a cyno and bring in dreads or a fleet of bombers.
---
I have been using d-scan for years, I dont trust blues anymore than I trust neuts. But I cant scan what isnt scannable. And the very fact that I have to use alts to check everything for a mere 300m/h whilst risking a 15-20b ship when I can just as easily make more isk than that in HS is the very same reason why the blackout is depopulating NS.
---
And thats discounting the fact that I didnt rat because I need isk, I did it so I would be ingame. To actually have something to do. Without it I personally feel I dont have anything to do ingame outside of PvP. And why pay money to play a game to do tedious PvP when there are tons of f2p games that give fast and better action?
---
This is the main problem of Eve, its tedious. Everything takes time. If you up the tedium factor which both the blackout and the cynochanges and honestly everything else thats been talked about does... You get the point.
---
Im not against changes, but they have to have an element of fun in them. These changes are strictly punitive for NS since they only offer boredom for us at the expense of others having more fun. And its expected that we somehow accept this. Well, people arent and shouldnt be forced to pay for a game in which they are bored.

Your kids need to go on a diet unless you can field a proper football team..
---
no, you have no clue.
---
Fair point.
---
Aside: now that you bring it up, I think it would be cool if bombs were usable in lowsec. I mean, it's pretty hard to deal with caps in lowsec as things stand, given that lowsec groups tend to be less able to counter with caps of their own. This won't exactly counter caps in low but it would be something, plus we'd get a new toy to play with.
---
I don’t think this cyno change will at all do what you and everyone else seems to think. What I think will likely happen is that instead of getting recons popped, the half smart groups at least will just use cloaked brick tank blops for their emergency cynos, and jump a fax to it first so they don’t have a loss while the supers undock.
---
If what I’ve been suggesting were to happen (No more instant response caps), then I think fatigue could/should even be reduced or lifted. Maybe even buff cap stats a bit towards the direction of fighting other caps, which should appease the null crowds a bit.
---
Regarding the whole “Goliath should be invincible” notion...in the eve scenario we are talking about, David is not even pricking goliath’s toe by killing a ratter, miner, or killing a few T1 subs from the response fleet. Meanwhile, both sides have a good fight, Goliath chases or kills David off after a scrap, and a few ships explode so the Indy guys you are protecting can build/sell more.
---
I’m not asking for the power to evict you, kill a structure, or even necessarily kill your caps. I just want it to be more difficult for you to toss 15 supers and a couple faxes at a 5-20 man gang instantly.
---
Pandemic Horde gave Goonswarm a very good fight in 9P4O-F. The Ferox fleet was action filled and made my heart race.
---
absolutely correct
---
I am with you against shitty bullies who kill you when you are weak and try to sell you the permit , they may take those permits into their behinds . Spineless excreta .
---
Low-sec CAN be that place.  You go there and PvP.  Done.  Why do you not get this?
---
there is nothing skilled about tossing a quadriplegic into an ocean
---
Amen brotha
---
lol
---
It would definitely make having a security status something to worry about as well. Inb4 people tell me you can just buy tags. But no one does that till it gets too much of a hassle to travel in high sec.
---
Can I get an hallelujah!
---
&gt; (just get 5 recon alts to JF to Jita! isn't a solution)
---
JF can jump to covert cynos.
---
No idea why it's that way, ccp things. Sp farming is ever so slightly profitable atm so it's a way to plex for free.
---

Know one ever regrets joining a fleet with someone who is new to FCing. It is so fun to watch an FC-to-be grow from the mistakes and very few are courageous enough to step up to face that kind of scrutiny. Good job even though it was toothless. You have them a good gumming!

You can't you just quit EVE!

And we also killed another Orca later on.  A good friday night out in low sec.
---
I know.

Actuslly, they do.  My cyno accounts have 3 cynos each on them I trained them to cyno 4 and interceptors to move around.  They pay their sub by one character on the account extracting and all 3 running one research job to sell the BPO for asmall profit.  Now, if I chose to keep my JF running, I would need a month more for each of those characters on each of my cyno accounts.  This change costs people with cyno alts subscription time.  Easy solution for me, my jf is getting sold and the cyno accounts going alpha and inactive.  Change to cynos is needed, but lets not pretend there is no cash grab here.
---
You do realize there are more risks than an awox right?  cyno placement is an issue, sorry I would not trust anyone else to light a cyno for me, and even if I did I wouldn't want them to.  If it was placed wrong and I bounce and die it would form resentment from me, or a feeling of wrongdoing on their part.

---
Take this ex-goon for example: https://zkillboard.com/character/90460795/
---
He was a known target that would be preyed upon every chance someone could get.  There are others, who were known to be good a hitting gangs coming through, or hunters that you know wouldn't stop until they chased you out.
---
It was a community - you knew certain hunters, and despite the prey/preyed upon dynamic - you'd stop what you are doing and try to counter them.  It was a community, a game where "oh it's stunt flores" and 20 goons everywhere would drop everything and start hunting him.  Now?  All you get is "Stratios in XXX" - no really good way to know who it was, and have a specific 'person' behind the threat.  You don't have that sense of fighting another player that you can learn their behaviours and quirks.
---
You had the ability to recognize certain people, and analyze their patterns - to actually PVP the player behind the various alts.  Now?  Suddenly threat... no actual hunter vs hunted where the roles could switch easily.  No way of knowing it was a specific guy hunting that I wanted revenge against, or a specific player that baits that I want to catch and counter their tactics.
---
It is that loss that I regret most about blackout - it's all about the players you play with and against... and if you have no way of identifying them you lose that sense.
---
no bullshit, once pulled a carrier out of asset safety, jumped it into the system the citadel died in, and took a WH to my new staging on the other side of eve.
---
I couldn't believe where I was when I took the WH from staging.
---
You get why they use cynos right? You cant gate them into combat zones. Its a very high chance that you will lose most of that fleet without firing a single shot. You are honestly under the impression that caps are something they really arent. I keep hearing about how caps are these magical things that can do so much but in reality I see how crappy they actually are and how fast they are losing any value.

Just poke the S-E bridge, easy fights in Scalding right there if you like dealing with swarms of angry pandas

Where did I say you had to gate caps? What I was referencing was a different sort of cyno change, so that instead of instantly applying to a combat grid they have to enter system first either near the local star or nearby off grid via cyno, and then WARP to the combat grid.
---
No, they announced it quite a while back.
---
But they sold it? So now all you have are keys...
---
An appropriately timed April fools joke then.
---
i was 3 cpu short of fitting this, i opted for the t1 tracking link
---
confirmed
---
I agree to this. Do NOT donate.
---
Thank you for sharing, always nice to have fresh input. 
---
But I have to point out that you could explore NS before the blackout. In fact many many did. Lots of NS is also empty so it wasnt any issue with that. Its in fact harder now because people are defending them with subs and gatecamps. This is psychological and honestly based on what you have been reading and not what youve experienced. Advice if you are serious about the game, dont read this sub. Its filled with outright lies, narratives and misconceptions. Educate yourself by trying things yourself.
---
Pay for your sub, until you can afford to PLEX if you want to. Provided what you are doing in-game is fun for you and also accomplishes paying for PLEX in-game.
---
If you play and get a few characters going, especially with PI, you can easily PLEX. The trick there, however, is the training time and paying for them until they are ready. Once ready, they can farm up enough ISK passively (depending on location/planets) to fund at least most of the accounts.
---
Typically, when I used to play more, I would either buy Subs on a special (Amazon or via CCP) then PLEX if I could with my accounts doing PI. Then I would maybe pay for 1 account, PLEX the others, etc...
---
If market-trading is your thing, and you have a good head for it, you can essentially PLEX tons of accounts and be mega-rich. It also can take time, so you may be sensing a theme.
---
Time is money. Barring any luck in-game, you will be looking at a grind of some kind. It can be passive, active or non-existent if you just pay $ and push the grind to real life. Skip the Starbucks a few days and only buy your beer on sale, then it really isn't a big deal.
---
Those who PLEX usually enjoy the grind, or have hit a tipping point where the grind has become easier... after an initial investment in play-time/SP/setting things in motion.
---
Above all, enjoy the game and don't stress :)

hrmmmm

where on your body will you put grath?
---
Yeah, cause those happen so often anyways..
---
The discussion was for it to be on his thigh, staring at his nuts.
---
are they tho
---
Shit like this is why I love this game. What other game you can randomly stumble upon huge ship full of stuff and go "oh its unpiloted gonna steal it lmao"
---
I hope I can do my own heist some day.
---
We discussed the thigh as the most likely spot. We want to be realistic and have it on a place not visible at work, and also small enough to not be obtrusive. 
---
That said, the buttocks was mentioned as a stretch goal if we meet our initial target
---
Oh no you actually have to play the game to make isk. The horror
---
Grath was, understandably... nuts for the idea.
---
There are bubbles in NS dude. It doesnt really work like that. You want stagnation, you have it.
---
Touch yourself while playing EVE, and you'll get gold.
---
Considering your post history, Id say the chances of this being an attempt to troll are about as good as the final season of GoT getting a rewrite...
---
I'm back from ER, I am better now
---
Are we talking being stomped by a frigate gang while you're solo or with a gang? Because a gang roaming with only battleships is very suicidal compared to a BS gang with the right setup (tackle/scout/boosh etc)
---
It ends for everyone lol. Do you enjoy dropping caps, not getting kills, then jumping back?
---
Aw man, but still, the repping capability of battleships, it leaves lots to be desired for a single frig
---
Made you click :)
---
Not really, you are just desperate to feel like its not true i guess but let me break it down for YOU.
---
This game always has benefits for being with more people, ALWAYS. This change only makes it harder, and limits the tools and info groups of people have to act quickly. It now takes more people, more time, more effort and more planning to be equally as safe. Plus there is less info floating around.
---
I guess it takes a test pilot to warp reality around himself untill hes right. You guys were born on reddit i guess, its how that works generally. But yea you think what you want, i on the other hand will  be expecting rat kills to be a bit easier then they were in the past. Definitely shakes up the safest, most boring crabbingfest EVE had ever seen in its history.
---
Wait, you can do that in Eve?
---
I feel so loved with all the attention I am receiving, I am just very sad I can't see the numbers of likes/dislikes.
---
I love how balanced it is though. Perfect controversy!
---
Easier deep logistics, and less brainless ratting. This is cool for small groups trying to score some ratting kills. Well get some of the crabbers playing like it isnt cookie clicker also.
---
Delete C4s, replace them with more C2s. C4 chains are the worst
---
I dont really think its gonna go that easily as you do. But not saying there arent ways but this isnt what I was talking about. Moving caps is gonna cost a lot. And there is no way around that fact.
---
The issue here is that CCP is really bad at iteration. And these things are not even proposed by them. Which means its only negatives atm. 
---
But you are presenting one case. You know how many times those 7 warp off? 90 times out of a 100. You are using the minority of cases as an argument. You think I wouldnt fight subs 10 times out of 10 if they actually stayed on grid and didnt moonwalk out of there making us chase? The entire NS small gang meta has changed towards nanos and cloaky ships, you think this is because they want fights?
---
Thats why we drop caps. Cause we dont have to ping for people to get into fleet, get to a location just to see them warp out.
---
But the difficulty didnt get changed, it just got more tedious. You really think an blocs with trillions of isk laying about really cant afford to pay someone for lighting a cyno? You really think players with tens of billions worth of ships cant afford a recon? Its just a tedium factor, an inconveniance. Sure more ships will get lost but in the grander picture it wont matter. Its just a shitton more boring and requiring more alts.
---
Yea honestly. Too many caps and huge alliances making real fights never happen. Now you can tell who is actually trying to fight. Its a great change for people playing EVE to play EVE, and not crabbing simulator.
---
My theory is they dont want us to know how much it annoys them. Or as AFK crabbers they have gone retarded and have failed to see this.
---
Was it a corvette? You can get a new one every time you are in a station.
---
why didn't he just vouch himself in?
---
Burn Huola :)
---
This would literally cause every eve player, shit, me included, to suffered a sudden and severe epileptic seizure.
---
Man that would be insane, I'm feeling severe anxiety already
---
Almost anytime I get the "shakes" gets carved into my memory in some form. Here are some of those times. They're probably not the most exciting to the rest of you but they're things I'll remember for a long time.
---
The first thing I ever did in EVE was exploration. This was back in 2015 and I think JohnnyPew and WingspanTT were doing videos at the time, which is how I got into it. After I got through the tutorial, I fit up Herons and started diving into nullsec, usually through a random wormhole connection.
---
The first time I got the shakes, I was carrying about 120M worth of loot in my T1 fit Heron, about a month into playing the game. I was somewhere in the south, probably Omist. I knew a few things at this point: making safe spots, cap dumping, the MWD trick, d-scan. But otherwise I was pretty noobish still - I was still using the in-game map to figure out where I was and where I was going, for one thing. Anyways, I jumped into a bubbled gate. Back then I had no idea what different ships even did, but now I know there were dictors. I panicked. I managed to cloak and slowboat out of the first bubble, but started jumping gate to gate. It ended up being a chase across 4 or 5 systems. I was shaking the entire time. I remember taking the regional gate into Feythabolis before one of the Sabres finally grabbed me. In hindsight, I should have stayed calm, warped to a celestial, and made a mid safe to chill out at - something that hit me the moment I got grabbed. And I've never made that mistake again.
---
I joined EVE Uni and spent my time with the LSC. I learned the ropes of fleet combat and started dipping my feet into FCing, just a little bit. I remember my first time FCing - I gathered up some bored west USTZ and AUTZ Unis and called a Magic Merlins fleet on 30 minutes notice. There might be an AAR on the Uni forums somewhere. I didn't have a good idea of what I could fight, and I remember trying to decide if I could engage two Caracals with 7 or so Merlins. Eventually we took the fight and I was overwhelmed with my first real engagement - information was coming in so fast and I wasn't used to calling targets. I think we took down one of the Caracals though. Years on, when I left the Uni and joined FW, I would take out another impromptu Magic Merlins fleet, of about the same size. By that time I had grown far more accustomed to fighting and losing ships, so I just went after anything that wasn't 3 cruisers and up. We grabbed a few frigates, then caught a Rupture on a gate, had taken some damage and were about to leave; then a Caracal landed on gate and I remember thinking for a bit, then saying "wait, come back, fuck this Caracal" or something along these lines. It wasn't much, but I remember thinking back to times when I'd have been too unsure of myself to stay on grid, and feeling a little proud of how much I'd changed.
---
During my time in the Uni I got into solo PvP as well. Nowadays I spend most of my game time roaming solo in FW space, so the kills and deaths do blend together, though the shakes are still very much a thing. Some of the kills do stand out, though. Once I surprised a Daredevil with a dual web, blaster fit Harpy. Once I landed 100km off of a (very bad) Garmur and Corax in an AB fit Incursus. For some reason I decided to stay. Normally I'd never stay on grid against a Garmur in an AB fit Incursus; probably I looked at the Garmur's zkill and figured hey, why not. I started afterburning away, and waited as the Garmur started burning straight toward me, before turning around at 50km and overheating AB. I somehow managed to grab him, proceeded to rip him apart with blasters, and left before the Corax got on top of me. In hindsight I could probably have taken the Corax too, if the Corax pilot was anywhere as bad as the Garmur. To this day I regret not staying on field for the Corax. I then got an angry mail from the Garmur pilot accusing me of cheating or something, I think because my scram turned off his MWD and somehow this was not supposed to happen. I posted the mail and killmail in chat and local eliciting general confusion as to how the kill even happened; we then proceeded to make fun of the Garmur that managed to get caught by an AB Incursus even after starting at 100km. Good times.
---
I also got into logi while in the Uni. Some of my best fleet memories are of doing logi. For a little while I regularly ended up as logi on Uni lowsec fleets and started getting other people into logi too - even ended up as logi commander a few times. A few times I gave the logi spiel on the Noobs on Patrol fleets. On one of these fleets we caught a...Proteus, maybe? and I remember the rush of satisfaction as we managed just barely to keep our 2IC (who was also tackle, I think) in his (kind of shiny) Hecate alive. The Uni went down to Querious to hang with Brave and I joined in one of the fleets as part of the Brave+Uni Osprey wing, and had a lot of fun shit-talking our F1 monkey fleetmates and projecting logi superiority in the logi channel. (If you've never done logi: there is a logi channel and we do this all the time.) I also remember going on small-gang roams as a solo logi frigate. I distinctly remember one time when one of our 4-man gang started burning after 2 frigates (Slicers, maybe?), and I called for him to burn back to us as he was outside of my rep range; he got down to mid hull before catching reps. I remember the Slicers paying me a compliment for keeping him up; it is one of my favorite memories as solo logi.
---
I'm too much of a casual to consistently respond to fleet pings or plan my life around big fleets or timers. I rarely get involved in stratops or big fleet actions. I'm definitely more of a small-time player, trying to make a little chaos in a little part of space. But I've definitely had a lot of fun in my own, small-scale way, and I just wanted to say that you and your buddy can too.
---
We set up citadels and refineries, mine the moons, and do PI, My corp is in a C3 with a HS static, so we always have access to HS to import/export, any other hole opens up, we explore it, and get any gas or ice, relic/data, then pop the hole for security.

Man...my best memory? Grath Telkien. I will never forget being invited to join a null corp having no fricking clue who they were what null was anything. I was probably 2 weeks in to playing being bored out of my mind mining in high sec like I did when I picked up the game for the first time in 07. Stopped playing then thought it was the same and was about to stop again.
---
Flash forward I'm invited to fly on a "newbro friendly" fleet handed a slasher and told tackle a ship when we tell you to. Tackle? What's that? After a quick explanation and introduction to fleet mechanics we were off...total of about 15-20 dudes. 
---
Jump through gate a lone Cerberus is there trying to pass through. I burned full speed screaming on comms about how I was gonna tackle him. I did...and I died. But I held him just long enough orbiting in that little ship for the fleet to get there and watch him die in my pod. FC spoke up and said "HOLY SHIT, *snicker* that was the leader of PL! He is so mad right now." Looked at the killmail and saw Grath Telkien. I've been hooked ever since.
---
My only issue with a lot of those fits is the IFFA Compact DCU costs quite a bit when compared to the rest of the cost of a T1 frigate.

Haha, oh no worries man I do get it.  Even then it was presented like "we'll tell you you suck and why you suck until you suck less."   I have enjoyed that form of camaraderie in the past, friends insulting each other for fun, but these days I just don't enjoy it the same.  It's kind of like swearing a lot: starts out fun but over time you feel kind of dumb continuing to do it.  I have noticed that that culture does often attract some really talented gamers in this game and others, and hopefully my respect for yall's skills came through alongside my culture assessment.  I'm not holding a grudge.  It's a cool corp.  It just isn't for me :)

No competent fc is ever going to do that against a force that could actually be a threat.  This effectively kills most large fights, especially since many of them start from a cyno and titan bridge to proper positioning.

That appeals to you and I (actually, seeing Local full of neutrals and not knowing what they're doing is what appeals to me, which is why I preferred lowsec to null).

But it does not appeal to everyone. It's personal preference thing. Empty Local, but a mandatory Constellation/Region should appease everyone.

Do your research before investing time (and Isk) into purchasing and researching ship blueprints. You may find that the ships you fly are actually cheaper to buy than they are to build.
---
If you're building them locally to save on the hassle of moving them, then fair enough, but don't make the mistake of assuming that building ships is profitable - quite often it isn't.
---
/me (unnoticed EVE personality) gives zero shits.
---
Doesn't matter what kind of pvp it was, I just keep reading that all PvP is dead. Or are we adjusting the narrative to better suit the REEE of the Day?
---
Liar, no PvP is happening and small groups are dead
---
A tip from someone with moderate FC experience: find a doctrine or 2 that you personally like, and know how to fly well, and focus on that. don't try to do something new every time. For me, my go-to and favorite doctrine is sniper caracals (caracals with 90-100 km range). It also allows people joining your fleets to have some expectation of what they will be flying, and can use the same ships over and over (assuming you don't whelp) and don't have to buy a new ship every fleet, or use more expensive/marked up standard coalition fleet fits.
---
Best of luck!
---
This is fucking awesome, and if you'll allow a somewhat newb to ask a question -- How do you board an abandoned ship? Did you have to bail from your ship, or do you go back and grab a corvette or something?
---
Just curious.
---
The less people the better. If you need 3 other people to trust to light a good cyno then that's more that can go wrong.
---
Yeah that other guy must be lying.
---
It's not a glorious life, but it's yours.
---
But why? What about the blackout made people buy all recon ships?? It didn't change anything about cyno and blops was unchanged. All blackout did was make it so anyone could be a blops ship as long as they were off dscan.
---
I've been using gila on my alt. Haven't noticed too much of a difference other than the price point. Drones are faster so they can push of baddies that come around too
---
lol cool?  I mean anyone who didnt see this coming wasnt really paying attention.  I am for both the drifter attacks on null and the triglaav attacks in empire.  :P  More destruction is good.
---
I would not know how much that would be.
---
I guess it's not intended for it to ever be shot at, but I still don't know why you'd bother putting mining laser upgrades on it. And I'm pretty sure the 5MN isn't powerful enough to do the MWD warp trick, so I don't know why that's there either unless he uses it to move between rocks. 
---
It's pretty weird.
---
But the second account is a cost. Stop implying that the only cost is a 5mil isk ship.
---
damn you, I have needed a fantasy football talk and I didn't even know you were still around -\_-
---
&gt;Did you have to bail from your ship
---
Unless they docked up the ship they were using or brought over an alt that happened to have the required skills to pilot the Orca, yes. Taking over a ship in space requires you to leave your current ship floating in space if you happen to have one. Though in this case it would probably be worth it for two billion isk and some change.
---
Of all the posts in the world, this is certainly one of them.
---
what alt-checking protocols are we using to make sure these are not the same person, such as when i found out bulkahontas was an alt of rock renelad?

I’ve always said that if the subscription was so much money for someone that it would impede their ability to eat, they have different issues and they should not spend the money.
---
In real terms it’s not a lot of money. It isn’t. Take your girlfriend to Starbuck’s for coffee and a piece of cake, you’ve spent more money.
---
I get where you can spend 10 bucks on something that you can play for 1000 hours, but you’re very likely not doing that on infrastructure that has to be live to do that. You’re playing EVE on a super computer cluster. If that cluster is not there, EVE is not there. Those things cost real money to run.
---
Your $10 dollar game has not gotten [not likely] free upgrades since 2003, to make it an amazing environment to be in. Somebody’s got to build that.
---
I’m looking at it from the practical side of building an environment like that and keeping it running and updating it constantly, all for that money. It’s basically pint ware.
---
I’m not scoffing at people who have to consider how to spend every cent they have, there are way too many people out there living with that reality [which is complete bullshit anyway, from the point of view that there are poor people in a world where that should not even happen], if someone is in that situation, EVE should be the first thing they should stop spending money on [and then you can still play for free as an Alpha].
---
It's a 300m isk ship, not 3m
---
What cash grab? Lol you don't have to sub your accounts.
---
Have you ever considered the possibility of getting a friend to light a cyno for you?
---
Nice job.
---
Almost sounds like he had a blinged out pod, knew he would die and took a chance of cutting partial losses by ejecting to gtfo
---
Can confirm was fun
---
F for Lif pre-nerf.
---
No, anything can use entosis links but everyone uses command destroyers, and supers won't be used to kill those.
---
&gt; or in fact I was the only person playing Eve.
---
Yes, let's seriously consider the most contrived possible circumstance imaginable, and design the game around that instead of designing around likely ones. 
---
If you have no friends, maybe you shouldn't have a giant ship that requires teamwork to move about. 
---
And given your posting history, you not having friends makes a lot of sense.
---
Now we are expected to have 'friends' to own a super? I think I will just stick to having another account.
---
God forbid you have to play an MMO with other people who train up to fly those ships.
---
Nope, you're right. It's all you, and your army of alts. And since you're too impatient to train the old fashioned way, you're obligated to buy injectors.
---
Man, our fleet looked sexy from this perspective.
---
huh that one really did spike  
---
still better than the age of 6m saar though, i was basically locked out of 70% of all fits
---
Another ass saved!
---
LS piracy has always been the best part of this game
---
You'll have to forgive me when I say I don't believe that you work in MMO monetization.
---
Source: I have 80 years in MMO game design, and a blatant liar.
---
The thing is, there's a good argument to be made that injectors are an objectively flawed mechanic that objectively made the game worse. A lot of problems in this game today, including large low-skill null blobs, capital proliferation, and the untouchability of null entities, can be traced back to injectors. And there are definitely some changes that need to be made to them, such as a hard cap on the amount of SP you can inject to.
---
But this idiotic argument that you *need* alts to succeed in EVE is just bullshit, plain and simple.
---
no u
---
Let me tell you about null blocks and the power they have.....
---
Full credit to Schweinsteiger to the idea of the "FED" name for our defense pact lol.
---
Best memory in eve? all of it man. It's all about getting you a solid group of people to play with and make memories as yall do
---
ah. the ever-elusive Lords' smugpost.
---
wtf?
---
Is that true???
---
:thunking:
---
&gt;*"You need to go make friends to move around EVE, but not too many because it will be overpowered!!"*
---
we made friends... then you cried about us having too many
---
That eerie moment when we’re in comms, Mumble I think it was at the time, at a time where the corp was moving its headquarters.
---
The CEO has piled all his most expensive stuff into his carrier \[about 40 billion ISK\] and he’s coming out of the cyno, meters away from the POS shield. As soon as he emerges and rotates towards the POS, Pandemic Legion hot drops him with 4 supers and blows up his carrier. With all his expensive stuff in it.
---
And he’s narrating that as it happens. It is entirely possible language was used at the time that was not really suited to a young audience...
---
We didn’t see him after that for a couple of months.
---
/not to gloat or sneer over the fact that this happened to him, the sense of amazement to be there in channel as it was happening was one of those ‘this is EVE’ moments for me.
---
AFAIK the Orca is too slow to mwd-cloak trick with. It will warp very fast if not instantly after a MWD cycle but I've never seen the cloak+mwd trick work. Also he picked a MWD not only 1 but 2 size factors smaller than what is optimal (500mn).
---
what the other guy said and to add to it Orcas(and capitals) have a ship maintenance bay which is only used for fitted ships so he could have put his ship inside of the orca and taken it with him.
---
Hot take: I can't kill people because its "having fun at someone else's expense." No one plays this game to make people feel bad. This literally saying that people with higher sp ganking a random venture in hs are at a "disproportionate advantage" wtf are you on. I'm sure if you found me and blapped my ship you wouldn't be thinking about how you are having fun at my expense. God bittervets are something else
---
If you're planing to rat with a Myrmidor, just consider salvaging instead
---
Can't they just go to another system? :thinkyface:
---
no, it most definately does matter - the current narrative is "*HURTING BLOCS  / BIG GROUPS WILL PROMOTE MORE PLAYER INTERACTION AND PVP*" but \~elite pvp\~ doesn't really create content, it's just a pack of wolfs fucking a gimp-legged rabbit sucking crok or something. Blocs generate warfare and the retarded krabs they harbor is create content.
---
Wormholers are \~elite pvp\~... how many times have you read a battle report from them getting into **l33t battlezz of dank fragz** over the last 2 years? **Spoiler:** little to none b/c they all have NIPs with each other.
---
Show me where I said the second half of that.
---
I'll wait.
---
Keep on going, even though there's not always killmails, there's always some fun stories of fleets. And we all get our fleets curb stomped every now and then, it's the mark of a true FC. :)
---
then they came for the cyno alts
---
and i did not speak out
---
because of falcon
---
and then they cried about all of us owning multiple regions.
---
then they cried when we all condensed in to one region.
---
&gt; And since you're too impatient to train the old fashioned way, you're obligated to buy injectors.
---
is there even enough time to train a char from cyno I to cyno V, racial cruiser V and recon I before the changes go live?
---
Unironic use of abaddons, eve 2019 is not bad.
---
Many would get it from the insane market.
---
Good job still snowing all those simple questions.
---
&gt; Many would get it from the insane market.
---
and where do injectors on the market come from?
---
*wooosh*
---
Lots of guns.
---
Eventually though, a lot of counterplay is being more prepared
---
You're really not getting the point are you?
---
That's all money spent on the PAST. If the goal is to get more cash spent now, why would the focus be on something that just involves money that has already been spent?
---
Huh?
---
So care to go back and answer those simple questions?
---
Let the record reflect, your honour, that the defence has not produced any evidence for their case.
---
Undock
---
have you been looking at the price of injectors/extractors lately?
---
If you're flying a capital it's pretty likely you have at least one character with Racial Cruiser V and/or Cyno V. And Recon I is not too hard to get.
---
And, again, *in any corp above twenty people it's highly likely there will be* ***someone*** *with these skills already*. Just ask them to help you out.
---
15m ticks going haven to haven
---
Man i go away for one weekend and miss all the fun
---
Let the record reflect, your honor, this guy is too retarded to realize I was summarizing his his long winded unintelligent ramble into what he is really trying to say.
---
is that a yes or a no?
---
It's a long way of explaining to you why your question is irrelevant.
---
It would be very worth it, and on top of that you can scoop your ship after boarding the Orca.
---
and then they came for me
---
and I enjoyed it, because i am gay
---
Aren't you the little troll. Must be nice to rip into someone lurking on the forum about it 9 years later. I bow to you, oh superior forum troll. God what will I do now that you've have cut me so...&lt;sarcasm&gt;
---
It's bbtb2, he never produces any evidence
---
Lol I would if I didn't have a serious gf, a kid, a step-kid, planning an elopement, martial arts practice 3-4 times a week + work outs, a management job, and a ton of other hobbies that don't require me sitting in a chair relearning how to fly the ships I have somewhere on some base collecting imaginary dust. :) But I'd consider it maybe after the dust settles. It hasn't for 9 years.
---
Do you just make shit up and hope it sticks while your newbee fanbois race to upvote?
---
I did the math on it once, pre-Abyssal era. You needed like, faction istabs/nomads and a really nice cloak on an X-type MWD to get it in. Not worth.
---
The MWD is just nice for gating.
---
BE GAYER THO.
---
&gt;It's not possible to nerf cooperation and coordination.
---
Not for the lack of trying. I mean how dare you try to save each other. Go get another ship to do it.
---
Only reason to bail is when your head costs more then that orca, high grade mining fleet implants still in billion ranges ?
---
That got me good. Lmao
---
Shows the new prancing dandy can't stand up to old school style. ;)
---
I'm a fairly new HS player and not overly salty about it. A little grumpy that I trained up hs mining skills first to earn isk while skilling up to use a BS, but hunting trigs for salvage is better income than the level 3 missions I can run or HS combat sites. Would rather extract skill points and take the loss than use a tank fit Skiff over an mining fit hulk, but am happy to just put that gameplay on the shelf for a while and see how it plays out. 
---
Then again I pre-ordered Duke-Nukem Forever and backed Star Citizen on the first round (and built a new pc specifically for it), so mining being shit for a while doesn't really hit that same level of frustration and disappointment.
---
yes it is relevant.
---
you called them impatient - if they don't have time to train these skills patience isn't the issue.
---
again - is that a yes or a no?
---
Oh boy... sisi?
---
it works okay, i run 2 istabs, meta 500mn and improved cloak, i decloak w 1 second left on the mwd cycle and click warp
---
That's what you get...
---
I didn't say you can't kill someone. Just that you won't be anywhere near the top of the food chain when they introduce the gold laser that can instakill people that you desire so much.
---
That’s exactly my point. It provides objectives to actually fight for, instead of ending every fight as soon as you get a cyno lit. It’d only be stagnant if you were too stubborn to ship a subcap fleet and fight for your cyno.
---
ya i exist dude
---
&gt;then you cried
---
Did he? Can you link the comment?
---
I never called them impatient.
---
\&gt;outnumber people 3:1 on subcaps and also bring a lot of caps
---
\&gt;talk about how you form voltron when you're "getting blobbed"
---
\&gt;brag about it on reddit
---
who is this posting, querns?
---
i quoted exactly where you said it, i'll do it again.
---
&gt;And **since you're too impatient** to train the old fashioned way, you're obligated to buy injectors.
---
I... never claimed to want that?
---
If they aren't compact, they're taking over a large swath of space.  That leaves no space for anyone else to occupy.
---
You want people to be able to buy power more directly. 
---
&gt;i dont understand why you are getting so pissed at people spending money in this game. let people have fun,
---
This is problematic in a PVP game and turns it VERY quickly into pay to win because the easiest way to get people to play is to let them win by introducing things that the non paying players can't get.
---
This just in. CCP is a for profit company.
---
Ok, then skip to the second half of the post where those recons and blops die instantly.
---
oh, so they do have a template.
---
https://i.imgur.com/BNAVXTW.png
---
&gt;outnumber people 3:1 on subcaps and also bring a lot of caps
---
They bridged onto us to take the fight. Not our fault they didn't kill much of anything to actually get stuff on the BR and their logi heavy stuff didn't whore on the 2 things they did kill. Maybe you missed the part where our caps weren't on field until the very end just to finish off their moros, or their double # of caps that we waterboarded en route to "blob" us.
---
&gt;talk about how you form voltron when you're "getting blobbed"
---
Yep, look at the people in the area and what they form. We're just trying to match numbers that we can't on our own individually.
---
&gt;brag about it on reddit
---
que?
---
Kids getting into a slow pace / high learning curve game with wishing they can endgame it in a couple of weeks
---
&gt;a lot of caps
---
&gt;6 dreads and a carrier
---
It may have with that tristan, it was badly fit and i don’t think had drones iirc
---
Filthy blobbers with their 6 dreads.... mega coalitions better be running scared theirs a new super power on the bloc. 
---
/sarcasm
---
Substitute whatever ship you'd like.  It's just as much of a pain.
---
Magnet and combat probes. You can scoop drones in null sec till the cows come home
---
Nice mental gymanatstics there. I never said eve was pay to win or said I wanted it to be like that. I said that I don't mind people spending money on this game. However, everything in eve (from an Omega clone state) is accessable without pay. However, it takes really fucking long and it's boring as fuck. Skill injectors don't equal actual skill and neither does Plex.
---
I entirely agree, making a cyno MAYBE cost a recon is not good enough. And I honestly don’t even think many recons will actually die, as cloaky brick tanked blops will take their place until the fax lands. This is why I’ve even bothered with an alternate idea. 
---
I do think it’s unfortunate that an aggressor fleet would warp off when a non-cap response fleet shows up, because they’re afraid of getting tackled. Maybe null needs better tools to catch a nano gang in addition to cyno nerfs? I’m all ears, if another tool allows null to provoke more prolonged fights then in all for it.
---
On the cloaky side of things, something else I previously thought of was something like a D scanner limited to a cone of say 15 degrees indicating the direction of a cloaked ship. This would provide some counter play against cloaked, but not totally gimp them as coverts can still warp off/around. 
---
Another more passive potential solution for that would be to have cloaks cost cap/s on a scale that you have to gimp a dps cruiser fit by a good margin, having to fit a decent number of cap rechargers/batteries etc for a more permanent cloak. Obviously this would require extensive testing and number tweaking. Ideally perhaps CPU usage would be drastically reduced for cloak mods with the cap usage increase so as not to gimp bombers too hard, and their CPU cloak traits could instead be redirected and balanced towards the cap mechanic. If your cap runs out, cloak turns off.
---
Fit Rails and Active Armor Tank then go for Combat Sites in Jspace C1-2...
---
Would add Bloodraider 10/10s too since they fuck you up without MJD.
---
this is the kind of high effort post I want to see for every 10 billion isk fight in eve
---
&gt; So you're gonna sit your entire fleet in the middle of a bubble 
---
Reading.  Try it.  Why, here's the very first sentence of the reply to you:
---
&gt; You don't need the entire fleet in the bubble. 
---
It's one sentence, with the longest word being 6 characters.  I think you can handle it.
---
&gt; Every system has the potential of dozens of warp in vectors. 
---
Not that lead to a random anomaly off the plane of the celestials.  At least, not \~90% of the time.  There are the about 10% of anoms that end up high or low, but 10% isn't a terribly good bet.
---
&gt;All you need is one safe spot out of the typical plain and you got a good warp vector.
---
Out of the celestial plane, and sufficiently close for it to be a different enough angle, is a big problem.
---
I wasn't quoted at all. Unacceptable. I shall cry into my waifu pillow long into the night.
---
Everytime we lose a structure "lol didn't want it" or "lol didn't know about a 9b structure"
---
Maybe if you put as much effort into knowing your structures as you did this terrible post you might save one some time.
---
It MAY.
---
But it isn't required to.
---
On top of IT STILL NOT BEING THE CORE INTENT.
---
So, with both of those factors how they are, it isn't a cash grab.
---
Good job still avoiding those simple questions.
---
Arranged? Nothing was arranged we where flying through scalding to catch off guard frt or TP. We tried to poke frt in their apparent staging area and pandemic legion got us, chill man what’s you’re deal? I’m just a newbro
---
&gt;Rote &amp; Pets (mostly pets here) were soundly outflown, outplayed, and outmaneuvered to a resoundingly one-sided defeat caused by excessive hubris, a poor understanding of capital deployment, and abysmal subcapital doctrine theory.

Could you explain your defense pact name?
---
GJ F.E.D. yall are some pretty cool dudes. are you recruiting? i look forward to the video!
---
Good name, very memorable. The name is one of the most important parts of any ball-coddling pact; something to rally the peeps to. Well done. Bless.
---
Hi, long time fan here.
---
Can you explain what the prancy dandy is?
---
Thanks in anticipation of your reply,
---
\-Proxay
---
"we're going to make a change to directly increase revenue that offers nothing in return"
---
it's a cash grab.
---
Add to the other comment; you need above 71% capacitor to jump. Also fuel... and you need to be within range.
---
Check that twice and don't fuck ip up, if you're in a normal Carrier the NSA eats your cap away but a Super should be fine. Fit a Cap Injector if in doubt and make sure to get Invuls with the same Cycle Time as the Injector if you're on a Shield Capital.
---
Also the NSA locks you in place now, and don't forget your Fighters (or just fuck em and panicjump)!
---
Holy shit that's amazing, I never though of that. Your statistics are irrefutable too!
---
Its probably under something's skirt.
---
I replied. You have less kills in 2019 than I had last month, and your reddit comments are exactly what I'm talking about. You've been on a rampage today. But at least you fly logi sometimes so I'll cut you some slack over the low kills.
---
To suggest that those people are "mythical" is just dumb. Our own alliance has hundreds (if not thousands) of them. Your ex-alliance *definitely* has thousands of them. I don't need any diplo drama so I'll just point out the low hanging fruit who aren't in our good graces anymore, like pretty much everyone in [Shinigami Miners](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/692190945/) and [X-Files](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98486683/).
---
So when I still had my Imp me and a friend of mine tackled a carrier in providence. It was tanked so I couldn't solo it, he had to reship reshipped into a leshak as well and I eventually logged in an alt to Grab cap boosters in some freeport trade hub 9j away.
---
The guy ejected when he hit hull, we took the carrier, docked it within his fort and sold it within the hour on public contracts.
---
Love providence.
---
haha you're a fuckin idiot
---
I don't have skin in this but it sounds like you are really salty about something.
---
To be fair, the invasion itself is the least interesting part of what happened this year. Did it once on release and have ignored it since pretty much.
---
initials of each alliance.... derrr
---
What waifu ship is on the pillow?
---
That is gross. It is a Orca, it's not supposed to work! reeeeee
---
In all fairness though that 1 second of being targetable will end up fatal for someone because of the insane sig radius so pretty much anything will instalock.
---
Dammit, ok fine in 3 months then !
---
Jeez, the mittani has a contender for the spinmaster title
---
You are being very intentionally dense.
---
It's a change that may or may not increase revenue being made be ause they believe the current cyno situation isn't good.
---
You keep just skipping over that part of it being a rather major mechanic change.
---
18m Waifu snek.

I believe it is his BR style of writing.

I am lord servent, here is my prancing dandy BR

TLDR; I can spin things fastfastfast
---
lol upvoted
---
And what's your friend supposed to do? Sit there bored doing nothing and gaining nothing for hours on end waiting for you to get dropped on? Are you going to do that? Of course not, you're just being facetious. You mockingly make unrealistic suggestions like it somehow proves a point and blatantly ignore the issue. You're just being voluntarily ignorant.
---
i'm not skipping over it being a major mechanic change at all.
---
of course it's a major change - that's part of how they force people to spend irl money on it. if it was a minor change nobody gave a fuck about, nobody would open their wallets.
---
Your revelations are Popular Science worthy, you should consider publishing.
---
Blackout was fine. Just needed a way to hunt cloakies and it would have been perfect. But now attackers with a cyno have an advantage over defenders with a cyno. This is far from good.
---
cyno :pepelaugh:
---
Yea, Unspoken needs a name for their donut of blues. Losing the spin fight without one.
---
This is the usual post that states how every posting that does not 100% agree with OP or CCP is obviously from someone being salty or brain damaged because they do not see the absolute greatness in their reasoning. Posted by someone who isn't affected by the changes, btw.
---
aDaPt Or DiE!!!1!1!!one!!!
---
Tristan, Algos, Vexor is great ratting. Speed tank and orbit at drone control range, and beware of turrets they can snipe you, and your little T1 drone boat can DO WORK.
---
Cap stable prop mod, I think afterburner is impotant for keeping signature radius small. 
---
Drone Damage in the lows, shield tank, maybe one shield booster to use like health option sometimes you do get hit if you're unlucky.
---
Hope this helps, I love drone boats.
---
Hardest part is usually having a pvp alt that can fly an orca.
---
Hilmar isnt an employee he is the CEO, and he WILL be leaving as such, the moment his obligations in the contract are fulfilled. They did not just sell CCP, they sold the IP of the game and its code, along with the development team.  I assume Pearl Abyss will get rid of anyone they can and replace them with their own staff, starting with, most importantly, the CEO.

S.M.U.G. ?

Wanna buy some ~~purples~~ greens
---
Lmao, nah fuck off. Subcaps have gotten too many buffs and caps have gotten too many nerfs.
---
But time and people change, and I'm not even talking about individual persons. There are literally people playing this game that have become active on this subreddit that weren't playing during the casino war. And since then, many mechanics have changed. Remember when they removed the vulnerability window for citadel shields? That change happened like a year ago. There are probably some outdated mechanics that you didn't know were changed. All I'm asking is that you acknowledge that you might not be 100% as you used to. And for the things you are solid on, be patient and school a newbro. It may seem tiring, but it's a lot more effective than just saying "I'm big, you're small; I'm right, you're wrong". Share your level of knowledge with the community as it changes and don't just demand that people take you at face value. During my time in the Navy, that attitude got a lot of people maimed and/or killed 😥
---
So my kid ordered pizza ... paid for it... and gave me a couple pieces. now that's winning!!!!!!!!
---
&gt;Have you ever considered the possibility of getting a friend to light a cyno for you?
---
Yeah, I have friends that would do that for me in my Ark. For a cyno or two.
---
Now try 8 cynos. One way. And obviously I need to get back too, so that's 16 cynos. Per run. 
---
And were going to do that twice today, once on Sunday, and once next Tuesday.
---
If your argument is that all activities should be single boxed, as per your own words:
---
&gt;I'm tired of this argument, "CCP balances EVE around people having multiple accounts in order to get people to pay for multiple subs!" No. Entirely, wholly, completely incorrect. CCP balances the game around *multiple people working together to achieve large-scale goals*, and subscribing multiple accounts is just a way for *single players* to be able to do activities designed for *multiple people* (in a ***massively multiplayer*** *online role-playing game*, no less) by themselves. It is not only eminently possible to do these things with the benefit of other players helping you, in order to avoid subbing multiple accounts, *that is the way the game is designed*.
---
Then why is the logistics gameplay in this game so fucking garbage? You warp to a station, wait for your friends JF to undock, push 1 button, wait 10 minutes, hope you dont explode, and then go to 2 citidels down the chain and repeat. For the Freighter pilot, you undock, right click capacitor, jump to, dock, and wait for 10 minutes for fatigue. It's actually poor gameplay, you cannot deny that.
---
With covops cyno capable Jump Freighters, the gameplay is still pretty questionable. It's just a shitload of jumps (now in a cloaky) and not much entertaining gameplay. The JF pilot remains exactly the same before or after the change.
---
It doesn't become remotely interesting until you have the JF,  and (right now) a few cyno alts already in position. After the change, it will be 2 covops capable cyno alts leapfrogging jump points infront of the freighter. Or 2 JF pilots, each with a covops cyno alt or two.
---
I will admit that I am slowly warming up to this change from that perspective, freighting may not be quite as mind numbing as it was and I can get away with fewer, more travel capable alts. And each of my accounts already has a covops/expedition frig capable pilot (one of which has cyno 5 already). And it will be interesting since, even if I am capable of doing it alone, working with one or both of the other major JF pilots in my alliance will make it much easier (buff to cooperative gameplay). 
---
But that cooperative gameplay has nothing to do with the JF coperating with the cyno, because either job alone still sucks. Its between the two JF pilots, each with an alt or two, making their lives easier.
---
For conventional caps, i agree overall that it's a great change. Even standard Caps now need to be treated as strategic assets because it's pretty impractical to move them without a fleet defending cynos or multiple caps mutually supporting each other on a move op. But I really just dont see JFs in that same light.
---

A munnin will lock a pilgrim in 4 seconds and a redeemer in 3 seconds, thats plenty of time to press jump. And, you know, you can bring more than just 1 cyno ship.

If CCP did tackle it then there would be all these bittervets shouting from their soap boxes about how they're dumbing down the game and how this isnt wow or hello kitty online etc.

If anyone wants to get me 2 years of  Ω  and pay for the tattoo, I will get your character's ugly mug tattooed on my body.

---
You can make shitloads of isk in lowsec with mining and lv5 missions. Since big parts of lowsec are basically empty I'm pretty sure there are quite a few R64 moons left even.
---
Where I agree is that both high and nullsec has isk making methods that are easier to access for new players.

What we need most for lowsec is a rework of faction warfare imo and maybe increase anomalie spawn a bit.
---
As for nullsec, drasticly cut down anomalie spawns per system so people have to spread out more. As long as Goons can cramp 35k players into delve the core problems will not get solved.
---
Ive been in every kind of corp at this point, there are 6 big varieties. Nullsec is all very similar with a small difference in huge sov blocs and npc null, lowsec pirate bois, wormholers, high sec gankers, and carebears. In 4 of those you feel valued and useful and respected. In a high sec ganker corp, and sov null, you are an f1 monkey worth very, very little besides the tax revenue.
---
One of my first times FCing was a bomb run on a hostile on a wormhole, warped our bombers straight on top of the wormhole instead of my perch and we all went "oh shit!" and fun was immediately had. Video below, audio is pretty priceless.

I love fighting frigate gangs in rapid heavy missile BS
---
:nouwu:
---
He'll probably say "well a barge on a r64 moon..."
---
Shit checks out
---
why would I lie about something like that
---
To be honest as a solo hunter it was easier to kill people in the VNI's now that everyone has people waiting on stand by and most people bait or use domi with RR and another ready to warp in hunting has gotten a lot harder :D
---
It’s never ever been 15 minutes
---
Maybe that's because nothing has really changed in low sec for maybe 10 years xD
---
I'm gonna say the line members wouldn't keep up with weekly or even monthly move ops, so stragglers would definitely occur. Also if the umbrella moves, even if there are citadels 3 regions over, that creates the possibility of an aggressor creating multiple timers and then when defense is mounted, another set of timers can be created/krabs hunted while the boogeyman is away.
---
After some time fatigue sets in and it gets harder and harder to defend.
---
An orca plus fit and full cargo is going to be more than a set of mining implanta.
---
Not really, needs 2 ticks to lock and scram
---
But this is what my second proposition would counter, with the rotating affinities.
---
Do you have any future plan for the triglavian invasion? (Where do you plan on taking that?
---
I agree, as NS corp C4 wh is a torment, scanning inside C4 always rings, shperes and a fcking tons of C5 while all we want is a HS wh to haul goods from and to HS. And that’s the torment you are given when the hole is empty.
---
&gt;ratting in 2 super carriers
---
Yeah you're part of the problem
---
Yea I think I've seen systems with up to 60 anoms up at one time with about 10 unscanned sig's its crazy.
---
Sometimes I've seen folks donate hulls like this.  Drop them in the ass end of a lowsec chain and then cloak up to see who gets the jackpot.
---
Didn't get a chance to make it to the fight tonight, was kind of bummed. Kinda glad I didn't now. Not because we fed, but because I forgot how much of a frothing retard you are. I would have thought you would have outgrown that somewhere during Fountain, or even after, but I guess not. You unironically use the word "hubris" about your enemies a lot for a guy who writes 14k words jerking yourself off about a 10b isk fight where you pretend you were some mastermind or something. At his point, I'm not sure if your head is so big from the extra chromosomes or the throbbing aneurysm from the salt someone in Rote apparently fed you at some point.
---
But it would likely cause smaller defense forces per timer for coalitions that want to hold vast amounts of space. Which means smaller aggressors can have an impact. And if the area is left defenseless, that's a lot of ISK down the drain.
---
And even if moveops are safe, there is still human error and stragglers will show up.
---
You do realize that the eve gate was a wormhole and it collapsed?
---
Hey man as a washed up bittervet formerly relevant bloc level FC who hasn’t been subbed since 2012, this totally hits the nail on the head except for one bit.
---
This is the part where I reiterate exactly what you said with a bit more knowledge of dated buzzwords and then go on to talk hypocritically about how every change since drone poo was a mistake that led to the stagnation of nullsec and modern capital proliferation.
---
I'm in NS, what really happened in C4?
---
Just use a stratios for 3s and 4s, Tengu for 5s and up and don't be bad.
---
Local intel + zkill is usually sufficient to ID hunters, dscan constantly for combats if suspicious characters in system.  I've been 1-shot combat scanned exactly once in several years of running sites.  It is harder to do than people think and many hunters don't know it is possible or how to execute it.
---
There is exactly one thing wrong with trig pve in highsec:
---
The extremes are too big. 
---
Regular npcs aren't a danger unless like 30 of them show up and trigs need at least 2-3 sizes bigger than their ships to take on. Or ridiculous bling stuff.
---
There is nothing that broadcasts "oh this is a dangerous one" to players about trig frigs in highsec.
---
Ship size should be a rough indicator of how much damage something will do.
---
That doesn't mean unvoluntary pve shouldn't be able to kill you in highsec. But I don't like that trigs are like x100 stronger than regular NPCs.
---
They are probably not getting hit or warping off if you dock up and back.  They are extremely agile.
---
&gt; I never said eve was pay to win
---
Neither did i. 
---
&gt;I never said... ...I wanted it to be like that. I said that I don't mind people spending money on this game.
---
These are tantamount to the same thing. There was a time, a better time imo, when people snubbed wallet warrioring. 
---
&gt;However, everything in eve (from an Omega clone state) is accessable without pay. 
---
Yes indeed it is, eve not currently pay to win. But it could very easily go there. And the first step in that is being ok buying everything with irl cash instead of playing the game to earn it.
---
So you're bragging about a free kill that required you to kill a single light drone while tanking 20 DPS?
---
Hey you know who is behind this latest change in mechanics that I don't like?

Goons.

I have 1-shot combat scanned multiple people in the last month alone. Best case scenario is you lose only your escalation. I am not writing this from the perspective of hisec bear. I am writing this FOR hisec bears.
---
Don't feel like you need to defend yourself from these morons.  
---
Chances are they are sitting on 100bn in old isk flying frigtates all day hunting players like you used to be, while bemoaning how safe their target is moments before they kill them.
---
it's called subtext, don't be coy and come out with it it's not that subtle what you're doing
---
we arent NCPL
---
In your version of EVE power projection should be absolute. Everyone coalesces under one or two player organizations. That doesn't sound healthy for an MMO. That to me sounds like WoW. There are set spaces for PvP(border regions or whichever region is contested at the time) and very few skirmishes.
---
I'm not proposing Arena PvP, I'm proposing that it should be harder for large coalitions to just sit still and get fat. And on the contrary, easier for smaller "player organizations" to make a difference.
---
I think players shouldn't be driven to join massive alliances. That shouldn't be the sole way to thrive in nullsec.
---
This sounds familiar...
---
&gt;Please upvote me. Remember to downvote everyone's opinions that you don't agree with because they obviously are wrong.
---
Oh I get it it's that irony thing
---
won't someone think of the space funerals
---
I mean you're currently playing a game under a set of rules and then the rules change after you have worked for something that wasn't an easy train in the first place. Why wouldn't someone be upset about that?
---
 Jump Freighting is something that everyone needs but a relatively small population want to do. So much so that large entities typically have a privately run service for the capability to allow the pilots to make a little isk. Now you're arguement is that a JF pilot should have multiple people ready and willing to light cynos for him? How would that work out for a JF route that is run daily or multiple times a day and requires 3-6 jumps? Hey space friend, keep your cyno in lowsec shit hole 1 for the next 4 hours so I can make a run down and back from Jita and line my pockets. Who would agree to that? Fucking no one. For this reason JF pilots have cyno alt accounts. Now in order to minimize the additional cost they are cyno 4 with corvettes. Suddenly CCP happens and these alts now require cyno 5 and the ability to fly a bomber. I dont know many alliances that would appreciate a loss of logistics while you train up cynos the old way, which requires you to stop training mains or get multi character training going for several accounts. Either way a cost is incurred. Since JF services are private the cost is also private unless alliances nationalize logistics for private members which is cancer.
---
The moral of the story, if you dont participate in this type of gameplay then why are you putting your opinion out there ?
---
PS: I already have the skills trained because I black ops hunt but not everyone does REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
We are super good at been evicted too.
---
That's a no
---
Truth.
---
Not having enough recons on grid is a mistake.
---
if you land a hit on a ship within (I think) 30 minutes of the kill, you will appear on the killmail
---
whoring is when you land the hit that is insignificant to the kill for the sole purpose of appearing on the killmail

what?
---
&gt;Any type of fundraising is not allowed on /r/eve. The exception is if it's run by CCP. Gofundmes, kickstarters etc are not allowed. The reason here is that we as moderators cannot verify if it is legit and there has been at least one broadcast for reps thread that was fake and just a attempt to fish money. CCP run plex4good are allowed.
---
He's not wrong, it is in the rules.
---
If multiboxing isn't a feature then why does my omega account allow it?
---
You should go check who said that.
---
You're quoting the wrong person.
---
So how do you determine that the "cash grab" is the purpose and not the "fixing the game"?
---
What evidence do you have to suggest it's about money and not making an improvement?

Just your opinion that it's not better?

&gt; I guess it's not intended for it to ever be shot at

For those that don't know as well, you don't have to hit or ewar to whore on a killmail, you just need to target the enemy ship and cycle weapons. Even if you're out of range or miss otherwise, you'll show up on the killmail.
---
I already sold all my stuff and for now waiting.
---
Mind naming off the people in this donut of blues, by the way? I just joined last week and I feel morally obligated to find out from outside the alliance who we are blue with.
---
I am too lazy to confirm and going to assume you are correct
---
FC, what are patch notes?
---
&gt; What evidence do you have to suggest it's about money and not making an improvement?
---
the fact that they're removing functionality that will only be returned by a mechanic that can only be carried out in exchange for irl currency.
---
so some dipshit decided to reply to me about something i didn't even post about?
---
i shouldn't be surprised, i guess.
---
oh mercy whatever will we do
---
In LS vs rvb fleet, his pod likely wasnt in danger. No bubbles, (likely) no cloaked smartbomber to try to pop the pod as the orca died.
---
Having caps dropped on our mostly-cruiser fleet, only to have a friendly batphone in the middle of the fight and having our own caps dropped. We managed to kill 3 or 4 caps, and only lost a carrier, was the best memory of my whole gaming career, was intense as all hell.  This was like 7 years ago, cap drops weren't as common as they are now, especially in our half dead corner of lowsec.
---
Yep. 15 minutes. Lines up with any PVP timers gain from making the aggression.
---
In laggy conditions (You know, any fight with more than 200 dudes these days) sometimes it can take a while for cynos to appear on capitals' list to jump to.  In 4 seconds, the cyno can be dead before it even appears.
---
You don't even have them added to overview...
---
If his pod was in the Orca once he got tackled then your tackle should Ctrl+F for Orca in his logs, it should say *scramble attempt to ..*
---
sadly it's just a visual bug and it's been there for few weeks already
---
I mean that's how free markets work. High demand and low supply increases price which incentivizes producers to build more to need demand. As supply increases the price will drop.
---
Look at the volume traded in that graph and you can see that producers have increased supply to meet demand since the change.
---
i don't read rules dude
---
When will be implemented?
---
i super respect this post
---
Why would I?  This is a mining alt that stays the fuck out of triglavian systems.
---
The possessive form of a singular noun (“it” being an abstract noun used to replace each individual language referred to at the start of the sentence) is created by adding an apostrophe and an “s”, the possessive of a plural noun is created by simply adding an apostrophe after the existing “s”
---
You always have an apostrophe when it’s the possessive, check your facts
---
Only because mitten's last go fund me ended up eating shit. 
---
...shit, that was like 5 years ago now isn't it?
---
Wheres that BR?
---
i'm actually super important

Because triglavians will attack you in non-triglavian systems.

I read it on reddit.

Don't worry, it's not like there is an API endpoint or anything that allows Discord/Slack/Else to ping over structures being unfueled, reinforced, etc. He definitely didn't know.

What?

If you do not like mining then do not mine.
---
Capsuleer groups can provide protection for mining ships.
---
This is how mining in null security space is designed to work.
---
My mistake, my dad just explained to me the link to old English and why it doesn’t need one, thought it did need one as “it” was being used to replace a noun
---
Dude where's my orca?
---
I don't normally either, for instance I didn't know it was against the rules to post a picture of a man in a dinosaur suit.
---
Seen Unspoken fly with Rote, Centipede, JAG, No Visual, NSH, and some others. I guess they aren't blue with Trigg... yet. Though I guess Rote and Unspoken together have more characters than most of the other alliances in the area, so that's probably enough.
---
It could be, I'd try and find it but reddit's search function works about as well as his go fund me.
---
ok?
---
3 of those groups had 1 or 2 people who roam with us and wanted to shoot something
---
get the fuck out of here
---
This is the truth. I wouldn't leave the lowsec solo pvp gameplay for anything else in the game, since this is what I find most fun, even after trying the other options
---
Almost like they're doing recon
---
That’s because nobody wants to listen to my wise words.
---
But that’s none of my business :-)
---
Needs more Tornadoes right :D
---
Thank you, this might just be my new favorite link.

---

---
You're right. Pyfa says they can do 3973 dps
---
I never said that. :P
---
So basically a list of bullshit. Rote and Unspoken have been working together for what? Well over a year? Same with JAG? I can definitely say we're not blue to TRIGG as I killed their in cyno the other day when they fought Goons (I was solo roaming and happened right into the fight), haven't even seen a single CENTI guy since I hopped in down here (almost joined them instead because Wildkins is a good dude, but then found out Anveri is back there and joined Unspoken instead). NSH is in GW and the only one I've seen over here lately was in a Jackdaw and I shot him.
---
Hi. JF pilot here. No real logistics pilot just trains cyno to 1 and leaves it there. All my cyno alts already had frig 5 so I could move them around null in a ceptor prior to switching back to noob ships. Noob ships required at least cyno 4 to fit the the LO in them w/o using a cargo expander. So the only real training needed to adapt to this change was cloaking to 4, electronics upgrades 5, and cyno 5. Depending on attributes this is about 36 days. The change is next month
---
Taking a one week break from shipping isn't gonna hurt.
---
They also warp to structures.
---
&gt;Now try 8 cynos. One way. And obviously I need to get back too, so that's 16 cynos. Per run.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;And were going to do that twice today, once on Sunday, and once next Tuesday.
---
So your complaint is that, in exchange for the ability to move large quantities of goods across long distances with (let's be honest here) minimal threat to your vessel if you're careful, you have to occasionally manage a slightly complex logistical system.
---
Sounds perfectly balanced to me.
---
&gt;Then why is the logistics gameplay in this game so fucking garbage? You warp to a station, wait for your friends JF to undock, push 1 button, wait 10 minutes, hope you dont explode, and then go to 2 citidels down the chain (assuming you have another cyno guy as well) and repeat. For the Freighter pilot, you undock, right click capacitor, jump to, dock, and wait for 10 minutes for fatigue. It's actually poor gameplay, you cannot deny that.
---
I don't disagree, but that's not the argument the OP is making, nor is that the argument that I'm refuting. The argument that I am refuting is the argument that CCP is attempting to force players into subscribing multiple accounts in order to make money. The strawman argument that you have just set up is that logistics gameplay is boring.
---
It sounds to me like this whole post is just you setting up a different strawman to argue with and not actually refuting my point, which is that claims of "CCP is just trying to force us to subscribe additional accounts!" are ridiculous and afactual.
---
he was politely shown the door during the T-C days for a reason.
---
No, I want to know where I said, "making too many friends in EVE is bad".
---
You're just setting up a strawman here.
---
The only dumbass assumptions made here are by you my dude. Personally I have always been able to make my isk in lowsec and I still do, since not much has changed the past many years.
---
Just because you don't fully know how it works and the options available in low, doesn't mean it's only bad options.
---
I mean, even the most new player thing in lowsec (FW) pays super well
---
Way to miss the point, my dude. The point is that game mechanics that require multiple characters to collaborate to achieve a single goal are not intended to "force players to subscribe more accounts", but rather to force players to work together, and that the players complaining about feeling forced to subscribe additional accounts are just creating their own problems.
---
*batphones ~40ish Panfam for a NV anchoring fort in late ustz

Reminds me of the time I discovered a random Raitaru, packed up and ready for deployment, with no one around it when just randomly scanning around my system...
---
Returned 5 minutes later, stuffed it into cargo, and enjoyed a nice bonus for that days efforts.
---
Your way too smug for a group that regularly feeds
---
You just gotta shotgun through the invasion areas, not a place for slow ships if you're gate jumping. I'm new this month and I learned that. If you jump through a gate and jump directly to the next gate with a relatively fast ship its hard for the trigs to murder you, even if they lock onto you, even if there's like 30 of them gatecamping. Hope this helps. Cheers!
---
Why the need for "reliable"? You turn down good suggestions seemingly without acknowledging them, because you deem then unreliable.
---
Have you thought for a second that, maybe just maybe, the best isk making isn't measured by the tick or hour?
---
then if  you didn't want to discuss the point i responded to.... why did you start replying to me?
---
There is no way to pay your way into putting a cyno on your Thanatos.
---
Did we clear that up?
---
So, where is your evidence the primary goal is more money and not improving the game?
---
You're being hyper selective in your recognition of facts here.
---
&gt;I mean you're currently playing a game under a set of rules and then the rules change after you have worked for something that wasn't an easy train in the first place. Why wouldn't someone be upset about that?
---
A valid extension of your argument is that CCP should never change any mechanics in EVE, and that CCP should never adjust the stats of any ships. After all, you worked to train something only to have the rules of how it worked change, and clearly that's a bad thing, right?
---
EVE is a game that is being continuously iterated upon. This is a deliberate, consumer-facing feature of the game. You subscribe to this game with the implicit understanding that changes will be made to the game in the future. You can argue that those changes are good or bad, but it's hard to get behind the argument that those changes are illegitimate. You knew what you were paying for and you paid for it anyways. It's been known for years that capital proliferation was an issue and that capital use would eventually be nerfed, it's hard to believe nobody saw this coming.
---
&gt;Now you're arguement is that a JF pilot should have multiple people ready and willing to light cynos for him?
---
I will now demonstrate, in a single quote, why that is not necessary for a JF pilot to operate, even after these changes:
---
"Hey, is there anyone online that wants to help me out by lighting some cynos?"
---
Optional addendum: "I'll pay X ISK for your time."
---
&gt;Suddenly CCP happens and these alts now require cyno 5 and the ability to fly a bomber.
---
No. Neither of those are requirements for JF pilots after the changes. JFs can still jump to normal cynos. All you need is Racial Cruiser V, which you should already have if you have the ISK-generating capability to purchase something as expensive as a jump freighter, and Recon Cruisers I, which is a trivial train for someone with the ISK-generating capability to purchase something as expensive as a jump freighter.
---
How do you check when the wormhole will close?
---
Your logic is not required here. Adhere to the Consensus and move along, prole. The Party is always right!
---
*laugs on null and dies because did not press dscan every second*
---
Ofc not.
---
Pot, Kettle. Black.
---
So best defense is to not have enemies on overview, have to try that.
---
What am I wrong about?

Also, you seem very low on fuel, since I can't see any downvotes...

I think there was also some news article or so. But which new player reads all that stuff. And then CCP is surprised that retention rate is low vOv
---
While fun, your corporation will fall apart if you don't find an actual fun activity to do.
---
Couple NSH dudes joined a fleet the other day bc they were bored and were super excited to shoot an anchoring FE fort.
---
But to add to this, Unspoken is Blue to Rote and Jag. We did an op or two with Centi in Cache just before we moved to Tribute. They are good dudes, but we don’t like having many blues, and we aren’t blue. On each other’s killboard you’ll see several small gang skirmishes over the last few weeks.
---
Not blue with Trigg, but we killed a Nyx together a few weeks back.
---
We have a long history with NSH from GW two years ago. We are not blue, but sometimes fly together. They live in GW again.
---
Rote invites friends from several alliances for nightly roams, which often include Cone, gone fission, NSH, Integritas, among others. Unspoken is not blue with any of these groups.
---
You can say Rote + Unspoken combined are larger than any group in the area, and that may be true. But that logic goes out the window when you realize we are in completely different timezones with very very little overlap.
---
We didnt get salty, we invited rote and pets out for beers at eve vegas
---
People keep saying eve is dying cause of changes       Server numbers holding strong.
---
So say we all.
---
You should have been following the code and you wouldn't be so close to dead.
---
😂😂👍👍
---
You also need Signature Analysis V (I think that was it, it's one of the targeting skills).
---
*generic mockery accusing OP of being salty*
---
and for regular cynos you need a recon. racial cruiser V takes just over 19 days, on an optimal remap with +5s.
---
recon prereqs are just over 11 days if we're being generous (because i'm not sure what bits fresh alphas are given these days so i'm assuming everything but sig analysis and electronics upgrades). that's a straight 30 days there.
---
i haven't even added on the time for the cloaking prereq.
---
also, all of this is with an optimal remap AND +5s.
---
so if this is released in the first half of the month, there's no way you'll be ready in time. or, you might just if you get lucky with the remainder of the skill point events.
---
Pirates have skills to fly orcas now?
---
I joined the biggest Coalition and now I am going to tell you how WE deserve every bit of safety because  WE built it.
---
not really - i responded directly to a point being made.
---
you just started replying with nonsense, as you're continuing to do.
---
&gt; So, where is your evidence the primary goal is more money and not improving the game?

.

this is just the last two days...I mean, its harder to find a BR on your killboard that doesn't include those other alliances.
---
This "cash grab" narrative doesn't make any sense.
---
Under what basis do you interpret that this decision was made for the purpose of selling plex and not because they think it's an improvement to the game?
---
Yeah but we do have a calendar with mining events pve incursions etc and every single time i see more people joining so yeah
---
&gt; So the only real training needed to adapt to this change was cloaking to 4, electronics upgrades 5
---
And you don't actually need the Cloaking, which then means you don't need electronics upgrade 5.
---
They don't have the time?
---
Is the heat death of the universe happening sooner than I thought?
---
Maybe, if I get that point I'll find out.
---
Yeah but more random. Like 8 times a day with different lengths

Did this guy win eve?, i cant tell but it made me laugh so updot i guess.
---
Lol a scared pilot who don’t wanna to blow up orca :P
---
lol awesome job bois
---
Can just take gates in regular caps till then. Might make for some interesting fights. My nyx warps faster than a HIC
---
That is not actually an answer.
---
Just for a money think about other reasons that change might be made. Like, cynos being fitted to too many different ships makes cynos and jump drive gameplay too powerful.
---
Hmm, following along?
---
Now, under that situation, would limiting the ships that can use the cyno be only for the purpose of making money, or primarily for the purpose of making the game better?
---
Electronic upgrades 5 is a prereq to cov ops
---
I admit they're bullshit, but... were you completely AFK for like 3 hours? An Orca can easily take a gang of 6+ recon Trigs. :p
---
ah, very well, I just knew it was for cloaking.

you are confusing the umbrella, with sigs and squads, and mainfleet. They are three separate things and they all bring the hurt.
---
Do I? Not really. I'm just going to follow along where it goes.
---
If November 2018 was appropriately timed...
---
Relax, I'm fucking with you. Easy target when you're so wrong. 
---
You can't say HTFU and also say that you need to do everything with other people to survive. Eve is about friends, and sometimes friends cannot be fully trusted with your shiney toys. Eve has always been friendly to multiboxing and you seem pretty hysterical about it. Kinda weird dude.
---
Recon Trigs again? :p
---
freighters are common in highsec.
---
sucks that I've been busy with school for most of that t5 time...
---
spend plex to omega, then train and extract. then plex.
---
They are barely, as long as the extractors bought on sale are being used up.
---
You can do c3 sites in ships around 600m with relative ease.
---
much cheaper for lower class.
---
It would be a personal investment by Hilmar using his own money. Unrelated to CCP.
---
&gt; 1 server tick=1 second is a principle for align time only, and even these can be beaten by lock times with a smaller fraction
---
No, it applies to all actions.
---
But the client sends stuff on a smaller more accurate interval. Then the server does them all each second.
---
if you can survive te initial volley you'll be safe.
---
They web you which should put you into warp almost immediately.
---
Also, the attacking fleet has however long they want to form 100+ dudes, the defenders have to do it in a minute or two, its not realistic.
---
Free Willy!
---
You can also apply unallocated SP to alpha skills while alpha.
---
Is it brand new?
---
Could just take time.
---
Adapt or gtfo!... just kidding, always wanted to say that.. blackout sux!
---
&gt; at least procuring the minerals for cheaper than buying the hull would be
---
Chances are this isn't true.
---
&gt;Now, under that situation, would limiting the ships that can use the cyno be only for the purpose of making money, or primarily for the purpose of making the game better?
---
&gt;They aren't mutually exclusive
---
i know, i guess my wording wasn't good enough  
---
oh well, that's news to me
---
or everyone just logs out for a week or so. training queue should be done before the hull timer comes out.
---
&gt;Second time in 2 days. 
---
And you didn't think to add them to your overview after the first one.......
---
in order to retain the functionality they had before the patch, after the patch.
---
They don't need to be, you just have to prove the one that involves a cash flow is the PRIMARY INTENDED GOAL.
---
Which you haven't.
---
You know by saying that, people actually read it as a challenge. And also might think it's very rare so very cool. But will definitely get disappointed to be subbed 30 days after grinding for hours..
---
Notes you sew on your vest.
---
The same thing happend to me. Kids (5 &amp; 8) and their friends came home and was gonna make a trap with tripwire, hot water and waterballoons. Needless to say, it needed to be stopped in its tracks. Left the screen and went to convince them to do something else. Came back, 4 recons had tore into my drones and my Orca was in 70% hull before my single defence drone (an acolyte II) had taken them out.
---
As a high sec alpha miner I totally agree with you. These change are great for the game, those null sec scum lords have had this comming.
---
 Someone from Dreddit implied that I was gay in Jita local a few years back, this will teach them.
---
or even subcap blobs
---
It can also take more than 3 seconds for the cyno to even show up in the cap pilots' list during laggy shitfests.
---
First one was on the main account, this one was on the alt, so no.
---
CCP is evil and everything they do is evil and horrible and I hate them. No change, stagnancy forever!
---
[oh, i see!](https://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2017/4/19/871460-Firestorm%20Oaths%20of%20Moment%20Sample.JPG)
---
Defenders too. No more need to get jammers cycled for it pilots :D
---
In my opinion mate, bridging a sub cap fleet should be a pre-req for dropping a titan fleet. Caps being faster and easier for small fights is the problem.
---
Read the patch notes, maybe?
---
More like 90 minutes.  Also this account is so new he just learned to use combat drones 8 hours ago.
---
do they scram?
---
You are broken.
---
Ever heard of the term "unintended consequences"?
---
Where is your evidence that cashflow is the PRIMARY INTENDED OUTCOME and not the limitation on ship hulls for gameplay purposes?
---
You're worse than a flat earther in your inability to understand your own argument.
---
I live in high. Nice to meet you. I haul though - don't mine. Do hauls for some people that do though. They're not happy, as you might expect - they've had a few close calls the last couple of days.
---
... And by close calls, I mean one lost his mining drones and was in hull while he was afk. In an orca. Could be a bad fit or skills, heck if I know - still, this could have been quite expensive if he'd not come back at the right time.
---
I always wondered how they could sit there mining all day.
---
As a hauler I've had to learn the hard way what flying afk does to my bottom line - trig gatecamps would kill me just as easily as a ganker did, and I'm not about to make that mistake again.
---
I don't have a problem with the idea that people playing the game should have to, you know, *actually* play the game.
---
&gt; Ever heard of the term "unintended consequences"?
---
yeah - and it doesn't change the outcome of an event.
---
ccp are money grabbing, whether they intended it or not. they know this, yet they are doing it anyway. therefore it is intentional.
---
He's talking about anchored cyno beacons, not ship based cyno fields. Cyno beacons can easily be camped, jumping a if there is dumb. Always warp to cyno fields to kill people :)
---
Oh no... not the poor newbie afk mining in an orca....
---
Wait, you can eject yourself from a ship?
---
This is the part where tell you, "You must be wrong because I feel you are wrong."
---
Well, it would also make the blops unable to really do anything.
---
You know what, good for you. You're getting out there and doing what you enjoy, and not just sitting around because everyone has told you that this, that, and the other thing are boring and bad and you mustn't do them because they don't like it.
---
Keep doing what you do, dude.
---
no, just web
---
There's plenty of space. You want people to be forced to spread out so every fight isn't everyone
---
You lost me when you said "highsec players aren't afraid or don't know better". Everyone knows highsec players are the scum of the game and CCP hasn't done nearly enough to force them to low and null. Low and null are the only places where players should be allowed, anyone anywhere else shouldn't even be considered a player. If there are players enjoying other aspects of the game, having fun with content in other places, like highsec, then clearly CCP has failed at their game development.
---
Literally boring your enemies to death is a legitimate tactic.
---
&gt; ccp are money grabbing, whether they intended it or not. 
---
...um...what...?
---
Money grabbing REQUIRES the intent.
---
That's literally part of the definition.
---
It requires putting cashflows above other purposes.
---
So we get to the crux, you are using words you don't understand, and then vilifying people over it.
---
If we use your definition, literally making the game better is just a cash grab.
---
Making the best game everyone loves playing is just a cash grab.
---
At that point words have no meaning.
---
&gt; Money grabbing REQUIRES the intent.
---
no it doesn't.
---
regardless, they know what they are doing. they know it's money grabbing and are going ahead with it.
---
The recon is going to die if it lights a loud cyno on grid with enemy forces.  It's just too easy to kill, they wont be able to help themselves.  "At least we got the arazu..." Every single time.
---
when do all those eggs hatch
---
A thorough, well thought out, undisguised shitpost. Graduate level work. Congratulations, Doctor.
---
If it's a rorq fleet how much you want to bet there will be at least two cloaked on grid before they even get started.
---
Surviving is something really important during a fight too!
---
And you can for exemple keep a cyno up... except if you get bombed, I know.
---
Didn't get a word of that. Still hilarious.
---
they try to kill the super umbrella bigger groups use.
---
"I was AFK"
---
Stealth bombers and covert cop frigs are not 300m ships.
---
Omist and Drone Lands need NPC space near them. Change my mind.
---
Mayyyyybe don’t AFK that long, and don’t fly defenseless ships that can’t fight back against things?  This is definitely a you problem, not a game problem.
---
But there is no local in null to hear you laugh
---
You just need to get 3-5 cyno pilots on grid instead of one. The first one will be a suicide cyno, by the time titans and LR dreads cycle through their guns, the second cyno pilot can light the cyno, the faxes jump in first and then you can bring in the rest of the caps/supers.
---
ah I see the skill urself neckbeards are out again
---
I agree. Unsubbing my 10 accounts permanently was the best decision I've ever made.
---
Did you have panfam on a titan in range for this one too?
---
Goodbye super umbrellas!
---
Thank you!
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Can confirm, corax is a turd.  Not scary for frigs even, which is just sad.
---
What you can't see can't harm you, that's why I feel the safest in WH space.
---
Quad damage!!!
---
NPCs tackling you and dropping caps/supers on ratting/mining capsuleers. ;D
---
It's not that great for that either.  Let a blaster frig land at 0 on a corax.  I'd always fight a corax if anyone was flying them.
---
You fly it, it is actually trash.
---
Falcon already opined on the topic. 
---
Nerf / Remove FAXes ( or make them subcap only ). 
---
Having said this, I believe cyno changes will work.
---
My best eve memory is from Friday the 16th of August 2019.
---
I logged in to a clone in a busy hisec station, the pilots there didn't know what was about to go down, something epic, that would blow their minds. 
---
The station undock was bouncing, with a few well practiced clicks I enabled the tutorial and warped to the tutorial site. All I had to do was kill one npc, I landed with guns primed and it died before I could blink. The UI blinked, you have 3 million unspent skill points, thanks CCP. I logged out and watched Mindhunter while I waited for my Just Eat delivery to arrive.
---
You see, I'm originally from the North West of England and the chip shops there serve gravy which is rare in the south. Ever since I left for the south I've dreamed of the day that one of these southern ponces would serve gravy and chips to me and today was that day. 40 years I've waited, 40 long years. Think of the longest year of your life and then imagine that with no gravy. Chips and gravy delivered to my door, chips and gravy from the internet, the folks back home won't believe me, what a time to be alive. I'm going to have me some chips and gravy whenever I want because I'm the master of my fate now, chips and gravy, these are my bitches now. I'm the king of gravy town. There's nothing they can do to stop me getting that chips and gravy. From noon until 11pm they'll be bringing me that chips and gravy. I'll block your fucking traffic with chips and gravy deliveries, that's how much power I have. I'll make you fucking late for an appointment with chips and fucking gravy. I'll block fucking ambulances in with mini vans and fucking scooters full of chips and gravy deliveries. I rule this fucking universe.
---
Used to work, but nobody can jump too it.  Just kindof acts like a warp beacon.  Dont k ow if you can even light in a wh anymore.
---
Remote rep for my recon alt that's cloaked up right over *there*
---
Drifters should be able to cyno and drop supers.
---
I’m hoping that with all the recent changes allowing the bridging ships to travel cloaked will introduce some new content and offset the the cyno changes a little
---
Do you have Srp?

Super umbrellas can't die. Especially the Delve umbrella.

yikes o'clock lads. it's one thing to have a bunch of allies and batphone panfam, it's another thing to go around shit-talking and pretending you don't.
---
everybody works with other people, there's no shame in it. but it's pretty cringe to read all this high-horse stuff about 'no blues' accompanied by a BR where you are clearly de facto blued with two neighbours.
---
Now provide actual evidence.
---
Evidence that this change is being made out of an overeagerness to make money.
---
They won't.  Makes way too much fucking sense.  Since we are asking for shit that will never happen how about they give the Nestor cov ops cloak as well.  Seeing as how it's the only sisters boat that cant run it.  Its kind of their thing.
---
This is fucking great
---
&gt;ccp are not a charity
---
Lol. I shall now post a meme from 10 years ago to feel superior to newer players who may disagree with me.
---
In my time in eve university I've seen enough people who straight up injected into an orca without having any clue about the game. If they'd asked before doing so I'd advised against it of course.
---
You could now have the attitude that those players are just idiots which should be seen as cash cows. Another option would be that some players start in highsec do something stupid there and evolve into players who actually do PvP and so on. Many now hard core PvP players have once been mission running in highsec.
---
Rorqual Miners will play Classic, while elite gate campers are jacking each other off on the Ccp Rise post! Oh what a time to be alive.
---
....okay. I'm done. You're just here trolling.
---
I let this go on too long. I always prefer to believe that people are acting in a sincere manner because that is the world I want to live in, but damn dude, nobody can be this off the mark again and again.
---
Your argument is literally "making a good game is just money grabbing".
---
And you haven't stretched passed that at all. This can't possibly be sincere.
---
What the fuck did I just read?
---
Remove cloak from the game.
---
&gt; Your argument is literally "making a good game is just money grabbing".
---
had you read my replies, which i have repeated multiple times, you'd know this literally isn't what i said once.
---
Yes, it is.
---
You dismiss ANY recognition that maybe the change is motivated to make the game better with the fact that, in maybe, perhaps, some cases, people may spend more money on the game, therefore it's a cash grab.
---
That is not the definition of a cash grab.
---
You haven't once presented ANY evidence that this change is motivated primarily by potential cash flows. Not a single time. The extent of what you believe is evidence of this is just that CCP isn't a non-profit, but that doesn't mean anything.
---
Htfu!
---
&gt; Yes, it is.
---
no, it isn't.
---
i suggest you go back and read.
---
Worst way to deny Killmarks
---
I do not use it for pvp anymore either.  My dual rep brawl fit did 800dps and 209hp/s until the ancil runs out of paste, now the modified version does ~680dps and reps 284hp/s for 35 seconds.  That wont even empty the ancil (6 cycles), so no, it is not better.  It is just worse.  That is cap injected with 1 nos.  What fucks the fit?  The third gun.  Introduces extra cap drain and removes the second nos.  Nevermind if you have to go prop on at all.
---
To run a dual rep armor fit and get comparable dps you must fit the third gun, this absolutely wrecks this ship.  You can hull buffer and ancil rep fit it like the comet and it is pretty gross, but the days of being heavy tackle are over.  
---
For pve you are better off buying 3 vexors for the same price.  There is now no appreciable advantage to using the vni for any type of pve content.
---
RIP vni.
---
Maybe even remove covert cynos from t3 cruisers
---
I approve of this link.
---
The blackout already massively buffed black ops to a point where it's clearly the most OP offensive mechanic in the game. By a large margin.
---
Blops are also slippery as fuck as they are. One of the more hard-to-catch offensive weapons in the game. Making them even more slippery is massive overkill, to be honest. If anything they should be making blops easier to catch, not harder.
---
So no thanks. Blops have been buffed enough for now.
---
After they learn where x/y did go, do you see any bitching on reddit or eve-o forums? Proof that nullfags are worse than highseccers. I love how almost exclusively this sub is infested with nullfags, makes it much more easier collect all the salt.
---
I am sitting on top of a mountain of salt, thanks to CCP it has been a blast these past couple days. Blackout announcement was amazing too. I am as relaxed as a highsec miner LMAO
---
Oh this is for Eve not real life.
---
Damn.
---
Anything can die.
---
If they remove nullsec asset safety there will be a reason to kill it
---
Pretty interesting, I used to highsec haul a long time ago, was somehow only ganked once and it was before Triglavians were a thing, but I haven't heard much about highsec since.
---
Am I correct in saying Trig gatecamps only happen in invasion constellations i.e. the systems that are like incursions but the rats scram and everything is triangles? Or do gate camps even happen in the systems where there are just Damaviks flying about too?
---
This is relevant how? It's still a second time and ur dumb for not adding them yet
---
This changes almost nothing, super pilots just put their alt in a recon so they can cyno in if tackled, its even easier on rorqual pilots cos they mine in herds so just one guys recon alt can service like 20 rorquals.
---
This change hurts the small guy, those of us in larger groups will hardly even notice..
---
Small groups and jump freights. those are gona suffer for sure.
---
This feature is presumably designed to discourage people from 'playing' the game while AFK. Working as designed.
---
I mean they're cheaper than recons right now...  I'd also rather kill a proteus than a helios.
---
Unintended consequence by the look of it, perhaps a review of what ships can light a Cyno will be fast arriving. I may be wrong and but I do not think there are many Super/titan FC's that will be keen to drop their fleet onto a Cyno ship with the tank of an Ibis that is sitting on grid with an enemy super fleet.
---
yes
---
They will end it when they destroy suficient amount of isk in game, and then they will introduce microtransactions for everything
---
Yeah, no. The blops dropping playstyle is already pretty overpowered at this point, largely because it's nigh impossible to counter a halfway-competent bomber FC. We don't need to buff that playstyle any more.
---
I've already done it with a Hurricane and an Astero.
---
Cataclysm ruined a lot man.  I think that's a telling comparison.
---
Is there a good mining guide somewhere? I'm looking at very passive isk generation while multiboxing more interesting characters. So I'm looking at mining with very low SP. And I'm interested in using them as bait in lowsec (if mining there actually yields more isk).
---
If you have some numbers of isk/h and SP required that would be helpful. I want to know if it's worth mining with low SP in wormholes (or gas huffing, but that requires immediate attention after 15 minutes if I recall correctly? with ventures). It would really be something I can do while doing pvp or active krabbing on another char.
---
At least he can save money on the next Orca since he doesn't have to buy new keys
---
I’m fairly new to the game, what makes black ops ships so hard to catch
---
Benaxle said:
---
&gt; Not even sure what I can do with them since don't have the isk to plex them
---
You are correct, but without the means to go Omega, that is not an option for him.
---
drifters in null, trigs in nigh- awesome!
---
Cernarios(spelling ?, Ex CCP guy on talking in stations) Once mentioned that a key draw for getting old players back into the game is their assets, all their shit that's all over nullsec, if they removed asset safety they would kill off all of those old players for good, they would have no reason to come back no incentive..
---
mitani v2
---
We offer the late USTZ action those guys need.
---
If you weren't a fucking tool you'd have friends too.
---
This is a general problem, not specific to Triglavians or even to PVE. When you see a destroyer symbol on your overview it makes a huge difference whether it's a Coercer or a Confessor.
---
Here is a 10 paragraph essay on how this very much hurts what I perceive as the little guy and how I beat around the bush because I can't just say I want any group larger than my own forcibly disbanded by CCP.  
---
Oh btw, Upvote me because my long post proves I am smart and a reference point.
---
&gt; I may be wrong but I do not think there are many Super/titan FC's that will be keen to drop their fleet onto a Cyno ship with the tank of an Ibis that is sitting on grid with an enemy super fleet.

Light cyno elsewhere in system. Or next-door.

On my first premature reply to my own comment, I attack a strawman coalition with an EVE  personalities face on it. Making the player personally accountable for all the shortcomings of my strawman. Case proven beyond Refute.
---
&gt;They had no idea where New Eden was located at
---
Considering it would be nigh-impossible to place a Stargate without knowing the exit point? Yeah, I knew it was a Wormhole that collapsed. 
---
Sansha's Nation has tech on how to open wormholes, which is the lore behind why they appear wherever the fuck whenever the fuck for Incursions. So that shows it's also not impossible to open wormholes manually with some degree of control to where they go.
---
His cowardice
---
Jump to covert cyno, kill target, mjd, cloak, cap up, decloak, jump out
---
Also in low sec they are great. Impossible to catch someone who knows what they are doing gating.
---
Can enter highsec
---
They insta warp once they decloak thanks to the cloaked speed bonus.
---
They are awesome ships always have been. Just underused.
---
The veles gun is indeed better.  I'd stick with it, but do get the skills up.
---
I know it was more of a joke.
---
Nah, I for one prefer using my caps. And I still will without any problem.
---
That's the whole point. The more spread out you are, the less oppressive the capital response in any one system can be. 300 supers in one region is totally different to 50 supers in each of 6 regions.
---
Disintegrators handle heat better than most weapon systems since it's just one module all by itself.  So yeah they're probably taking heated.  Again though if you can barely fly the thing skill wise that's the real problem.
---
Why are miners always like this?
---
They won't kill umbrellas until they take supers out of the game.
---
I say just take everything except t1 frigates and cruisers, make the fits all standardized for each race and be done with it. No more whining
---
Jaguars in 1v1 situations are not an issue. The problem is the 50 moda fakas behind the jag.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
That won't do anything to supers. I'll just buy more to move my ships around easily

Cloak on Nestor is really not a great idea, Nott every ship needs to be balanced around NS and they already have a solid role in Wormhole space (dualboxing/tripleboxing C5/6 sites, also as support/screening in armor brawls).

OP was obvious. Just thought I’d point it out to you as perhaps English isn’t your first language or something.
---
Lol yeah well if Eve has shown us anything it's disappointment. Most players will sub and buy Plex and still be poor
---
strongly agree.
---
I was going to write a rambling curse filled diatribe asking why the OP thinks they deserve to be able to PLEX 4 accounts. But just let me misquote Mike Monteiro - "FUCK YOU, PAY CCP".
---
The Excavatophobia is real!! anyone who hates miners isw bigoted and excavatophobic! They are literally mittens!
---
I don't see any evidence that he acted "hysterical". He didn't even oppose multiboxxing, he opposed the idea that "thou shalt sub an account for every role".
---
I'm inclined to agree here. The changes are frustrating for established logisticians, exciting for hunters and pirates, and irrelevant (for now) to new beans.
---
They kept saying they would bring back high risk-high reward. In the current model, there is very low risk for high value freight reward. In the new model, there is very high risk for the currently established reward.
---
The entire process of moving product out of low/null into high sec and vice versa will require much more caution and effort. I think it's a good thing, and I'm looking to get into the freight business on one of my (currently) useless PI alts.
---
You don't need weapon spec 5 if you use veles gun, 1 is good enough since you only need it for t2 ammo and skill bonus doesn't work with faction guns
---
That wouldn't be a strawman it'd just be irrelevant.
---
I also was confused by that line.
---
Only with weapon spec5, and it's only barely better
---
With weapon spec4 they are about even
---
Check my comment below or the eve Uni Wiki site, you can check it easily with the info button.
---
well with asset safety there's zero reason to kill anything in nullsec. in jspace if you pop a fort you get a massive loot pinata, and its fun as fuck.
---
just saying, by that reasoning you'd have to choose between having mass amounts of safe assets and having conflict. 
---
and i believe the conflict is the only thing that makes those assets mean anything
---
Those are covert cynos, caps can only use regular cynos (recons/blops)
---
Wow, how strange that logi will have low kills, like when you saw my scimi losses you should have really not talked about the kb anymore. And you are not putting it into relation of how much I actually play or dont play. Or if I have alts or not. You are quite literally not saying anything relevant, you are just assuming things.
---
And your biggest assumption is that a majority of people are just doing 1 thing without knowing even one tenth of the facts, but that doesnt stop you from still saying these things.
---
Wait I did not know there was a fourth t3c...
---
What you don't seem to get, it that for bigger groups, it doesn't change a thing. There's always these dudes with their 4502 accounts that can login 3 blops cyno per rorqual group. Sure, Carrier ratting is certainly dead, but it already was due to blackout. Super ratting is just more dangerous, but a semi-competent pilot in a big alliance will survive anyway if the ship is tanked enough.
---
While you don't seem to like "krabs", there are better ways to reduce the "afk" component of EvE pve. But CCP is just lazy so they use the "eRa Of cHAos" meme to introduce changes that were discussed as an item in a 30 minutes morning meeting.
---
Nullsec has a boringly easy pve. So does WH and HS ? Lowsec is way more impacted (lol capital L5) than everyone else in this case, and the rest of it isn't worth it. Everything making you money in this game is a fucking boring hell of a grindfest, please excuse people that don't want to ACTIVELY be bored.
---
Lowsec already has a ton of moneymaking options that are accessible to newer players in smaller groups - FW being the most obvious, but there's also good exploration in the form of 4/10 - 6/10 ded plexes and the corresponding unrated sites, L4 missions (that have better LP payouts than those in highsec), and moon mining - the best moons are pretty much all taken by local powers, but a small group can easily take and exploit low- and intermediate-value moons in quiet systems.
---
I am genuinely amused that NS players shit on HSeccers now, after crying  so many tears about the changes, that I thought Noah needed to build a new arch.
---
But honest question: If you live in WHs... I think you gotta watch out, you are the last one not significantly affected yet;)
---
My first screencapture with Windows capture thingy...
---
There is so much disjointed shit in this thread, do people really think more then two years of playing a game is right to earn a bog-standard ship. You guys are pretending that a few months playing a game is not enough to learn how to play and be good at it.
---
Why the fuck should anyone grind in a game for years, this is just not how games work in 2019. Adults value there time now, we will not sit grinding for over two years to get this. 
---
Eve with-out fast tacking would be a world without Eve.
---
Definitely. It’s mostly just a meme. C4 chains can be very annoying to scan though. I think we had a chain of C4s that was 15 holes deep at some point
---
Hi, you must be the town idiot! Learn to read before spouting random bullshit.
---
He said moving a cap, which requires a  regular cyno, which from September on, will require either a force recon (at least 300m) or a black ops battleship (at least 1,5b).
---
The only cap you can move with a covert cyno will be a JF, again only from September onwards.
---
By 'MWD trick' I meant using the MWD to shorten your align time. If you take a large enough MWD (I think 500MN but I haven't actually played in a minute) then you can warp in one MWD cycle by hitting 'warp to' and cycling the MWD once. Though this doesn't always work out of stations due to undock momentum.
---
&gt; Test and goons do this too
---
&gt;Pre arranged
---
  Wait, we do?
---
the horrow and invading force doing recon who would have thought :O
---
That includes the Triglavian incursion rats.
---
AFAIK the recons that roam outside incursion areas are these four only

I remember one night a brand new FC took a roam out- and he actually froze when stuff happened. As in, not a word in comms, nothing moved. I feel sorry for the poor bastard.

With that much ore, I can build a Thanatos or a FAX with that much materiel \^\^
---
Hi it's me Marlona Sky, witness protection doesn't allow me to speak often as the sordid bumblebee sticker culprit remains on the loose, but I'll surface again just long enough to tell give you my incredibly relevant opinions. Toodles!
---
Surely the answer is to afk up a vni or even just a vexor with drones out.
---
Escorts needed, extra account required, more money for CCP.
---
Yes it is.
---
The guy was totally correct and you are a complete asshole.
---
Yes
---
didnt ask
---
Very goot shitpost 10/10 for OP.  CCP  gets -1/10 for never ever listening to player or the CSM for that matter :D
---
You would be surprised how many times a cyno dies, especially when you are moving them. And if its a 300m KM then ye you can guess. Thing is, I dont think blops will work either. They can get alhpad just as everything else, even the tankiest is not tanky enough. And there will be a ripple effect on the economy aswell.
---
I honestly cant think of anything that would stop nanofits. Bubbles dont work cause they use booshers. They dictate the range at all times and if they dont wanna take the fight, which they wont even at the hint of trouble, they simply wont. 
---
I am however starting to get the feeling that you are not one of those types of PvPers, you want fights and are willing to take them. And you do care about balance so dont take my attitude as dismissive even if I am being just that. Its just that in a perfect scenario everything can be fixed, this is however CCP, I doubt they are actually gonna fix anything before too many have left. I mean one could argue that point has already passed. 
---
Its still way to OP. I mean its 360 degrees and you would use 100% focus on d-scan instead of actually doing anything. Better to stay docked up. The only way I can the blackout actually working is if you get a set amount of time, 15 sec from when entering a system to showing up in local. That will still give you a headstart in scanning down a target but it will give the other side the time of the warp to decide on an action. And ofc if you break cloak before that you will also show up in local. But if CCP wasnt trying to punish NS they could have started with something like this and adjusted the time.
---
I dont think its good to mess with cloaks or d-scans because they do actually work as intented, its just that in a no local environment they suck.
---
Its an interesting thought. And I do like the removal of afk cloaky chips but the hunter doesnt need dps, he only needs the cloak and the cyno/cynos.
---
Considering how far into lowsec it was, yes. I could *maybe* see this being a thing if you wanted to cheapskate on an AFK hi-sec mining ship, but he's several jumps out from any hi-sec gate so I have no idea what he was doing. Martoh's not even in a dead-end pocket or anything.
---
I'm a high sec dwelling newbie and I think that these attacks are good. You aren't supposed to be safe in Eve... You shouldn't be allowed to afk in comfort. This game is about stress and conflict management as well as risk assessment.
---
I certainly hope he will leave EVE Online alone one day. Only then real game devs could improve on the game and attract 1 million or more players!  Only null-sec miner with Rorqual btw opinion here.
---
Ahahhah  how the TRIANGLES  have turned.
---
*I'll see my self out ...*
---
Typical Frat response fleet are Horde muninns, PL/NC jackdaws (high skill, high sp, veteran doctrine) and sometimes BL muninns (if Elo is around).
---
It's like the OP used an AI to analyse all of the worst shitposts on the eve subreddit. And then use it to create a script of possibly the worst shitpost it could generate but unfortunately this monstrosity / masterpiece hybrid was crafted
---
No.
---
Thanks
---
But not even close to as much as all of that put together.
---
I think you're being contradictory. Here's a way : character trading was always a thing. You're hating on what kind of player exactly? Greedy? Or are you hating on a player that did more in a year than you did in 5?
---
Years ago you could do the same thing he did, get isk, use isk to get older chars with skills to get isk quicker etc. Now it's just a more steady progress, gain isk inject, that makes you more efficient etc instead of waiting 20B to get a capital pilot.
---
And if it's that, that you're angry because someone went faster than you. It's really petty, considering you had a 10 year head start. People want smart games, not dumb dumb stay longer games where you can't lose if you were there before. There are other mmorpg for you out there, you can level up infintely and there's no shortcuts and no new player will ever touch you.
---
Get real, play eve, adapt.
---
You had 54 vs 18 - with those numbers I really don't think that fight deserves such a long smug post, especially as there were only 12 bill in losses lol.
---
NP, Just as a side note: Tell them not to even try, Because if they do, They will get hit by Concord
---
Goon man bad, pls upvote
---
but they don't have to be together, that's the point.
---
What? No. How would that be fair? You have to join the war to participate in it.
---
I promise you it wont go that way. Its a fine thought but in practise it will become capblob for the defenders and subcaps for the attacker. And since the capblob is already set up it means it will be that much harder to bring in yours, basically like gating them in. Youre gonna end up on grid against ships that will kill you as soon as you are out of warp. Caps will be used less offensively, FCs will be cautious when the other side has too many advantages. And in general, an entire war. Defenders have a lot of advantage already and caps were already hard to bring in because of cyno jammers.
---
And the most important part here is the fact that none of the other factors have changed. Its not easier to fight offensively, its actually harder now, and there is still no reason to do it. The main reason behind the stagnation is not gone and the risk of alliances just opting out of warfare completely is higher. 
---
My main concern with this age of chaos is just that, its not fixing any real issues. In fact its just adding issues, of which most are actually just tedious. So there is a very high probability that when its over, nothing real has changed. Every reason for the game being in a sorry state will still be around. Plus a shitton of more disadvantages that seem to only hit one specific playstyle, coincidentally the same playstyle disliked by CCP employees in favor of the playstyle they as individuals seem to prefer.
---
I dont belive CCP will balance or fix anything vital simply because of their bias.
---
Your win win and low adm show that you really try hard to spin that pve has declined massivly in nullsec to your advantage. You want to spin the down spirale of PCU too?
---
Okey. As long as youre happy boss.
---
So you're saying that a single sig has the same power as the whole blob?
---
???
---
I think making them a BLOPS properly would be nice
---
See you're really just asking for that because the existing blops are all subpar, over-costed brick shits.
---
If blops were actually representative of the 1.2b price tag we wouldn't be clammering for the Nestor to become one.
---
They can actually go FASTER cloaked then uncloaked, so they can warp directly out of cloak, making them extremely hard to catch.
---
Plus the jump drive and MJD.
---
I'd tell them to try.
---
Safeties RED everybody!!!
---
On what date did this happen...?
---
PL is blue to Horde, as well as Fraternity too.
---
lets see [https://i.gyazo.com/3534fe6c79ddfe024b2d9e99abb08e08.png](https://i.gyazo.com/3534fe6c79ddfe024b2d9e99abb08e08.png) these are the last 3 months, care to compare june to july?
---
Yesterday
---
They can drop on targets about 1/4 the isk value of themselves. Carriers are borderline immune to blops (not bombers, blops) because their gigantic sig radius and piss poor speed means fighters apply fully. 
---
Blops have been untouched for years and it shows.
---
That is false. Covert stuff was buffed. The blackops bs is still an overpriced brick. T3c, specifically the loki does everything better for cheaper.
---
Even if he hađ a loaded head, why not let the ship be destroyed? You can still get away in your pod every time
---
crop rotation of the big powers would absolute annhilate small ones.
---
Ok since when did we have a reset on PL and Fraternity?
---
when people are forced to crop rotate krabs and pvp players would move, question is which power can handle imperium and test crop rotating together of the map?
---
That would be terribly overpowered, so no.
---
I like the fact that fucking CONCORD doesn't even bother to help.
---
There's a limit on assisted drones?
---
"once survive in null against the larger players."
---
that is easy, always had been.  figuring out something to do while you are there is the hard part.  
---
if you just like cruising though empty systems then yea, the current state of null is right up your alley.
---
Giving the Nestor a jump drive would be so ridiculously OP I love it
---
There is already a lack of asset safety in kspace, industrial complexes. Dont see rushes to kill them and I doubt there will be a rush to kill everything else just because of the lack of safety. And besides, its not that hard to get your stuff out.
---
And for the thousand time, dont compare NS with WHs. They are not the same and one size doesnt fit all. The only ones who are gonna get hurt by asset safety removal are those who cant move out all their stuff or defend the structures. And guess which ones that is.
---
Besides, wars were fought more frequently before and no loot dropped back then outside of POSs. Yet another reason that speaks against removal of asset safety as having anything to do with actual incentive.
---
I would also like to point out the fact that blocs make far more isk just not waging a war than they would by looting some structures that might or might not have any loot.
---
no.
---
Even Lars Ulrich knows its wrong.
---
Not with my connection
---
It will make a difference though, it will add an extra step to being as safe as before, which will inevitably increase the amount of people that are not that safe once its in effect. Your logic is kinda nonsense. Big groups use cap umbrellas, so making them cost more isk and more pilots to keep running is 100% making it more dangerous. Just because large groups of people can solve and adapt to changes does not change the situation. 
---
It will be come overall more work to stay safe ratting. That sentence is the key to all the people that will be getting caught soon enough.
---
50 drones max assigned to someone
---
Surprised by the way comments go. Горжусь вами, парни!
---
And yeah, it's easy to mock ones English grammar when it's your native language.
---
and a few faxes
---
Same goes for drifters. That 1-shot weapon taking ships out was a massive wtf for a lot of people and new players still complain about dying to them because they don't know what they are.
---
I mean this is clearly /s but downvoted anyway :^)
---
&gt; Now try 8 cynos. One way. And obviously I need to get back too, so that's 16 cynos. Per run.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And were going to do that twice today, once on Sunday, and once next Tuesday.
---
Perhaps CCP want some meaning to the geography of the cluster and don't want it to be trivial to move stuff right across New Eden. They've added a lot of local industrial capabilities over the last few years, with EC structures, moon minerals on demand and promoting rorqs.
---
Long distance logistics should involve risk, fleet cooperation to mitigate that risk, and not just 'board corvette, press teleport button'.
---
I guess you have never heard of a bubble.
---
Man rmt is getting fucking weird these days.
---
Think about it this way: They spend time and money on tech that enables the same battles with the new cyno mechanics.  
---
Less massive bumbing for titans and fax and the ability to jump them in fast enough that the cyno being a Recon/Blops instead of a Supercarrier/Titan doesn't matter.
---
just check the numbers of blackout day, until today of course mai etc was fine for the low login numbers we have :). DO you really think we didnt lose players or players dont login atm? Do you really believe those changes will help to grow eve's playerbase and not decline it further? Do you really think its not better to have 40k more dudes pve'ing and maybe a target than 40k less dudes in the game overall? Do you think that won't spiral down cause the game is still neglected invention and invest wise by ccp? Do you really think ccp suddenly makes those community moves and killingspree cause player number's don't decline further and they know pearl abyss won't be happy?
---
Counterplay is good. Means strategy is real and matters, unlike the current shitfest of cyno everything and hahah what's strategy just drop everything easily.
---
He wanted the best way to make himself useful, plus if you learn tackle properly it teaches you soooo much about the game
---
Before you do, send Atrum a forum message and ask for them to be SRPd.
---
Changes are in September lul, still has time to use it
---
!invest 100%
---
check august stats but hey ship kills stay roughly the same for years with some % difference. What really didnt stay the same now is PVE activity on top of ADM's. That mean's less players do stuff, mostly from the small alliances btw.
---
ERB reference
---
I see what you did
---
But look at the MER in infamous botting regions, clearly a lot of bots *did* stop 'playing'.
---
A recon with a cyno is killed a lot faster then a super/rorqual.  
---
If you look at videos of the umbrella jumping in, you usually have 3-5 titans/supercarriers jumping in, followed by the big blob.  
---
With the new mechanics you don't have a cyno up on an unkillable ship for 10 minutes, so you have to think a bit more about how much force you commit to that cyno.  
---
If you can kill the umbrella recon and prevent new recons from lighting cynos, you could even kill some of the umbrella ships.
---
The second account cost also mostly pays for itself through SP farming. That massively reduces the maintenance cost, the remainder of which can be made up with a very basic PI setup for example.
---
At this point though if they roll back the significant changes (particularly blackout), anyone who is interested in gameplay beyond nullblobbery will see it as a final confirmation that CCP only cares about that. So most PVP-oriented players will quit and then how long before the farmville players get bored too?
---
Thanks for reminding me about RvB.  I started playing EVE again, I've been bored and need to join something.
---
this website you are posting on is called reddit
---
Hes got a few mill in the bank after selling eve to Pearl.
---
Wouldnt it be funny if CCP one day decided to change a core mechanic to bring back old players by simply letting them do things that would be considered as exploits in other games? What if they implemented this mid month so they would be able to retain the numbers for the old players (MAU) whilst getting some old blood back? And knowing full well that bots will multiply to cover the deficits from NS ratting in HS even further pushing up the MAU/DAU. 
---
And then go on a pod and say "hey look, we have the best numbers ever, this is a success" whilst actually knowing the real numbers are looking real bad. Ofc you hide these from the playerbase via login events but you eventually have to fix it. Wouldnt a great mechanic change (for the game ofc) be to force people to put a cyno alt on grid with you (that coincidentally needs more training than they have time to train thereby forcing them to buy skill injectors and ofc more PLEX). Ofc you will be giving more content to the other side simply because now theres even more free killmails. And in turn increasing the MAU/DAU even further. Soon they will go out and say "hey guys look the numbers are up, this is a success". 
---
I dont know. Dont wanna be that cynical but it does smell fishy. Would be fun if they revert all of this as soon as the contract with PA is fullfilled. Oh imagine the tears of all of those trusting CCP right now. But everyone, lets be graceful if that happens.
---
theres eve mail endpoint, but im not sure if you are being sarcastic or not
---
I approve this message
---
That's the chaos part of the Season of Chaos
---
I approve this message.
---
im an idiot for trying to read the whole post.
---
If CCP didnt want to profit on this especially on JF service why they don't delay the cyno changes so that people can skill queue properly in advance or why they dont put in industry only cynos? :P
---
Damn, I thought Hilmar had resigned.
---
Ive died to instalockers faster than I could cloak and was not happy
---
Let me make some smug remarks that my group's play style is not affected by these changes. In fact it makes life easier for us with our superior skills. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
Pretty much any assault frigate, and literally any t3d that isn’t a jackdaw. The jaguar has pitiful dps and it’s tank isn’t that great when you start dropping ancillary reps for ab/web and adding in weapons
---
Also, if you are attempting to load into a bonused fleet hangar from another character you won't be able to load more than the default amount.  The pilot on the other hand can see and load his own hangar to the bonused amount.
---
now i would agree/disagree for 4 Paragraphs with some stats and will narrate that its all nullsec/lowsec or wormhole's fault and that either nullsec/wormhole/lowsec is the savest space. Also i will give hindsight that in the end CCP gives a fuck about eve since we didnt had any new invention/invests. Also Falcon will show up with some half baked ideas and people will acclaim him as their savior until he has to put the light out!
---
Holy fuck, I'd heard stories about this guy but this is one hell of a self-congratulatory victory blowjob BR for blobbing someone.
---
Yea definitely doesnt help that theyre not on your overview
---
It has to be funny to be an acceptable "/s". Otherwise it's just another shitpost, and that market is saturated.
---
I of course agree wholeheartedly that the personality is terrible, since he is kind of annoying to my playstyle. I note how I am sad I cannot upvote this more and encourage everyone else to upvote this, even though I did not read most of your comment because it was too long for my attention span.
---
They will lose space - people will move to where they’ve left
---
That's clearly bullshit, tons of reasons to kill shit in nullsec.
---
Going to be some expensive ship losses..
---
I wish they go further by having a delay before people jump through because jumping tons of ships through instantly is not really realistic.
---
Does this mean  that everyone will just use covert cynos now rather than normal ones?
---
How many frigs or dessys can a Nestor fit inside it?
---
i know your joy their tears but sadly we lose many players to such things dunno if its good or bad. back than it was good with current numbers i consider it bad.
---
uhm... no? you can lock and scram in 1 tick. Thats how "ultralocking" works. Thats how insta warp interceptors get cought sometimes  [https://english.eve-guides.fr/index.php?article=105](https://english.eve-guides.fr/index.php?article=105)

&gt;Worst way to ~~deny Killmarks~~ protect your killboard stats.
---
seems someone knows when the ship is sinking xD
---
Although, it shouldn't be that they can rotate either.
---
Otherwise, they just take up more space, and rotate every month. Creating the bad part of both worlds. 
---
There should be both, incentive to utilize every little bit of your space (like aegis requires) AND a penalty if you overuse a certain space (diminishing respawn rates of combat/ore sites or something)
---
Yes I as well support you opinion.  
---
I will add my view that NS is in fact safer than HS and this needs to be changed.  
---
As a HS Explorer I did hear of a friend who was killed by a LS gate camp the other day, which proves that all the changes that are made are good and bringing more content to the game.
---
The Character Bazaar was timegated due to the training queue. So it's not even close to injector mechanics.
---
Had this happen to me. They'll sit on customs offices. When I warp to pick up PI materials, I'm dead. Going to have to make 300km pings now for all my PI.
---
well, a plain black ops is not insanely expensive... annoying but okey
---
you could make deepsafe citadels, and only light the covert cynos there. should be a high survivability rate then, as one has to come by exactly at that 10min window.
---
&gt;Why the fuck should anyone grind in a game for years, this is just not how games work in 2019
---
Go play those games then.
---
EVE is a niche, it's *meant* to be hard, slow, and grueling. That's why us "bitter vets" loved it so much and why we look down our noses and sneer at you weaker players.
---
Yes.

#when prison jokes go too far
---
I have a Covetor and an Orca with perfect skills, back in the day for solo mining I would use the Covetor for sure. 
---
I see a ton of solo Orcas now a days, Is that still true? Or should I Orca and Drones for solo mining
---
I spelled out lol with my titan cynos
---
the thing is: caps currently have no decent counterplay (well the counterplay to caps is caps...)
---
And that IS a problem. You only get a healthy environment if you have a somewhat decent counter to anything you can bring. 
---
And no, bombers are good, but are not a sufficient counterplay to a well established super fleet.
---
Too Short, Didn't Read
---
It takes like 71d to train and September is in a couple weeks.  
---
How can possibly all these subscribing pilots be able to adapt without resorting to...wait a minute...skill injectors...
---
I see what you did there CCP.
---
I so fuckin want to see this. I might even log in again.
---
I'm not sure there is a benefit to having the hatvest set while sitting in an orca, and the most expensive clone I own is less than 400mil.  Other than a bling mindlink I can't think of a reason to spend 8b on a clone.
---
Sounds like you want jump drive mechanics changed instead of cyno fitting requirements.
---
To add to that, it is also very difficult to convince new players to stick around if they have years to wait before getting in to a ship that is relevant to days meta.
---
Skill injector are a necessary evil in this game.
---
I agree. My Corp should be able to go out and counter the goon titan fleet.
---
Ccp plz fix

They refuse to play the game in another way than being tabbed out watching netflix, or watch someone else play a game on twitch.

---

---
And now I post the obligatory "Wormholer btw" response as I laugh at all your salt.
---
&gt; So how much $ did you sink into EVE just to be "competitive" whatever that means in a multiplayer sandbox?
---
According to my bank account history, since 2008 it's total of around 100 monthly subscriptions (4 accounts for 2 years regularly + few months with 1-2 accounts), four omega galaxy packs and 80EUR total for plexes - I guess that's maybe twice the amount average player spends over 3-4 years. So yeah, I'm rather far from being wallet warrior, and if you add to that the fact I hate mindless grind, it's probably not what you think. For the record: my highest concurrent mining Rorqual pilot numbers at any point was 3 and it lasted until one of my goals (build a titan from ore I mined myself) - from those 3 pilots now only 1 can still Rorqual mine (serving as a bait for smallgangs), rest had unnecessary skills extracted.

By that, I don't feel like I ever "cheated" to get around normal progression - I did buy injectors for PLEX (first batch was injecting my main from those 20-22mil SP into being capable of flying in every doctrine fleet for coallition I was in; second was buying skillbook, set of +5 implants and one large injector for my freshly bootstrapped titan alt, so I could get the finetuned training queue started; remaining PLEX from omega packs etc. went into subbing my other accounts over time), I like EVE but not to the point of wanting to throw tons of money into the game. My main game feedback is: find a goal (usually related to either killing others ships), find a way to achieve that goal, abuse game mechanics to be able to achieve said goal and move on to next thing. The most fun goal so far for me was to get enough from solo pvp loot (mainly blopsing) to be able to keep subbed by PLEX all accounts involved in that - it was hard to do between full time job and alliance fleet ops, but seeing the "PLEX challenge" container tick at 6.8bil value was totally worth it.
---
Outside maybe having 4 omega subs paid by cash (is that really uncommon?) I did only what every other player could try to do on their own given enough time, game knowledge and determination - and add to that the fact I abhor any kind of mindless grind, keeping it to minimum. By that, for me it's not "cheating natural progression", it's progressing as fast as the game design allows, more of a speedrun to get to more interesting (for me at least) postgame than playing at a pace that is common for most of the playerbase. Now, due to how EVE works, biggest obstacles for me were never ISK or SP, it was getting access to people who could teach me what I wanted to learn and people to fly with who did things I found interesting - that's not something you can just PLEX/ISK your way around, no matter how hard you try.
---
&gt; I would love a game where this is absolutely not possible and the ingame wealth and level would reflect the actual achievement of the player. I think offering the option to "cheat" in this way is harming and diluting the game at its very core.
---
I fully agree with that - as long as "achievement" means that, and not the time since you started playing. For now, if you get someone who is experienced and knows what they're doing, and tell them to play EVE starting from scratch, single omega fresh account, they'll get to where they were before in noticeable, but still relatively short time (I guess around 6-12 months) - and that for me sounds like exactly what you're advocating for: your resources (wealth is only one of those, and on its own doesn't do much for you) should reflect actual achievement of the player. Just remember that starting early doesn't really sound like an achievement worth bragging about.
---
I think this would be in direct contradiction to the idea of removing safety from the game and adding chaos in its place.
---
Orca? I think it looks more like a Puma
---
Lunch is canceled due to lack of hustle..deal with it!
---
Unspoken boys are some the saltiest in eve. On par with the salt of capqu and salturself
---
The is no huge difference between Coercer and Confessor. If one can kill the other one can probably either.
---
lets make bitching about falling for scams bannable, then the scammers would all quit because all the stupid people left?
---
i love that 3 frigates almost killed your orca, shows how afk you was lol
---
Sorry mate, who initially replied to who?
---
That caveat is important, a lot of the people that are dying are going to be AFK carebear miners, who are exactly the kind of people who wouldn't be registered on zkill.
---
&gt;1 million or more players
---
I actually kind of like that the game feels like a small town community. Like when you meet another Eve player in real life you can be like "Oh who do you fly with? Oh you're in CorporationNameDotte? Do you know XYZ? I used to fly with him when I was in FW in 2014."
---
Last week I watched someone buy a carrier and attempt to gate it to highsec. I was 30 seconds too late landing something to kill it and they docked up in a station.
---
My point is people buy ships in Eve without understanding how they work. This guy bought an orca because big mining ship and then proceeded to go to lowsec.
---

Back when Tri was cool
---
The problem is:
---
That information there is not realy going to help much in preparing.
---
Ok, now i know these guys roam around. Does not tell me how powerful they are or how dangerous or that they attack indescriminately.
---
Keep in mind that in the past Drifters also showed up randomly, but would usualy let you alone if you did not provoke them.
---
what a dumb response
---
Yeah when I play a game I don’t need more stress
---
PvP needs to be funded somehow. I have sometimes the feeling that a lot of people forget that.
---
Limited ressources means expensive then, expensive means profitable which mean you've got someone training 500 accounts at a time.
---
If you've got the money and the comp to multibox you could also, in a year train into a lot of things.
---
&gt; drone poo
---
God damn it, a decade and a half in Eve and not once did I think of it as drone poo. I'm offended by my lack of wit.
---
somebody made a comment, i challenged the validity of it, then a person that wasn't the person i replied to replied to me with something unrelated to what i wrote.
---
Combat recons are invisible to D-Scan
---
You know, there are regions where this is entirely true, so why do you not go there and let the ones that want a bit of safety have it, while you get your kick.
---
There is no *right* way to play eve. Everyone should be allowed to play it like they want.
---
There were never that many characters for sale. It often took weeks to find a suitable toon, and competition was stiff once posted.
---
The Bazaar was a completely different meta.
---
Cyno vigils are fucking cringe thank god they’re going away
---
If I killed my self and someone did a cyno vigil for me I’d want to kill myself again
---
Hey friends. I'm still kind of a newbro and I'm looking for a ship style to go solo roaming for PvP. Excluding FW.
---
I'd like to just cross regions, fight until I die. T3Cs and kikimora come to mind. 
---
Now the T3Cs are a bit too skill intensive for me. I hear the Kiki is good but it's a hundred million or so for a destroyer I don't know how to fly.
---
So ugh, assault frigate? Is any t3d better than the others? Thanks guys you rock
---
YES.
---
See if you can help out with diplomacy, find cooperation opportunities for your corp with other corps, maybe help out with administration and recruitment. Do art, write. Do anything!
---
Maybe. The OP didn't bother to clarify and on this sub it's more common than not to get a smartass condescending remark than a useful tip.
---
Maybe that was broadcasters switching to t2 mining drones. Or players not multiboxing 9 VNIs anymore. It was easy to do and took very little effort. Also, gilas have less dps than VNI did and Ishtars do. And you have to pay more attention scanning every few seconds. This are all plausible explanations for isk to be down. If you need to really focus on one or two, you can really run 9 accounts. Now, it's very difficult to not loose ships and be AFK.
---
you english bad
---
no talk
---
no make sense
---
o/
---
Can't post worst than lorenzo.
---
Fair I suppose
---
If you think the Armor rep bonus and gun bonus has made the VNI terrible at PvP, you’re retarded.
---
This was 30 minutes after our (PH) previous Ferox fleet got dunked by Goons in LXQ...whoops.
---
So doesn't this mean that adding FAXes to the allowable cyno list effectively fixes the large cap fight escalation problem while still delivering an effective kick to the crotch of supercap umbrellas?  Since generally you don't have ratting FAXes out?
---
Really? Its just... I don't trust people with an enabled Cortana bar.
---
Because cynos in there current form aren't required for those situations, and they have unintended stifling effects on smaller scale engagements.
---
Now major b-r5rb style fight is going to afect by these cyno changes.
---
So light 5 at once.
---
I’m attacking your post and downvoting you entirely because of your flair. This could be for one of several reasons:
---
1. I am unaware that you flair baiting is a thing, of course you are actually a member of the Alliance I hate the most (the Blood Raiders)..
---
2. I took the time to verify that you are not flair baiting by looking you up on zkillboard, because I absolutely won’t actually log in to Eve and look you up there. This also gives me the opportunity to call you a noob because you lost a Raven to high sec rats in 2007.
---
My best day was just shortly after i lured a friend into playing eve. I told him to firstly play the tutorial to get the basics, then i'd want to do some lowsec pvp shit or some wormhole exploration to show him what you can do. That day, he asked me if i could borrow him some isk to buy some stuff. I thought about it and in the end, i declined. Isk have to be earned the hard way, right? 
---
So i said to him no, you'll have to earn the money. I am playing in a null alliance and challenged him, just for the lulz, to find a way to get into our main staging system. If he'd manage that without getting killed and show me a screenshot of his pitiful thrasher in said system, i'd give him the isk.
---
Oh boi...i still dont know how he managed that. He never told me. But he did it. Best laugh i had in months :D
---
Well I thought that but the more I think about it you really don’t want too much chaos. This would make the Black Ops BS more attractive to buy and use and would open up new corps specialising in the protection of null sec assets. Imaging thinking your about jump a roq fleet when their counter black Ops jumps in? The construction of these ships would rely on null sec (am I right there?) 
---
I don’t believe it would be over powered. That word is used a lot by null sec. in WH space you are always prey to something cloaked up, most ship that can cloak can hit a lot harder than BOBS and are much more terrifying. The cyno would just open up more tactical options/fun game play
---
Guess people weren't as smart back then and didn't profit from obvious demand? I don't know.
---
I guess the phorde nightmare fleet ready to bridge in was just there to hold your hand.
---
PSA: To avoid being surprised by things that are in the patch notes, read the patch notes.
---
I literally just told you it was timegated.
---
Furthermore these ships deserve a cloak. It’s part of the parcel and the offset is their lack of tank (if fit cheap)
---
Good.
---
Fuckups are what makes content. Fuckups are the start of those great stories that all got us into Eve.
---
First: flying a covops frig with cloak needs at least some skills.  
---
Second: It's called roleplaying as BRAVE
---
Hindering large scale battles? That's a bit hyperbolic don't you think?
---
COOL, NOT ONE BUT TWO ALIEN INVASIONS, IN ADDITION TO SANSHA INVASIONS.
---
I LOVE HOW IN EVE THE RAID COMES TO YOU.
---
Light cyno elsewhere in system, spend 5 minutes trying to get aligned while you bump off everyone else, and if you don't get probed down and bubbled at the in cyno, you get drug/catch bubbled when you land because probing down a super fleet, or just dropping bubbles in line with a cyno, which is on over view, is really hard appearently.
---
These are great recommendations from someone who has obivously spent very little time in a super fleet.
---
Get about 3 caps to the first one, maybe 2 to the second one and the other 3 die in tidi before anyone doing the jump dance even see them.
---
Great idea. I wonder why no one else has thought of doing that before.
---
tengu :)
---
Collateral damage.
---
Lifblood update.
---
that's a t1 cloak you muppet, he's going 50m/s with it active
---
Idk about the change but Force Recon vigil cyno fleets when someone dies? :/
---
A WELL established player an easily make enough isk to offset their sub. In fact they can do it in less than an a couple of hours. However that a long way off from a new player.
---
I understand not everyone has money to throw away at a game but if your going no to commit to a game like EvE then (IMO) you should be capable of subbing your account/s.
---
Also don’t forget, if you enjoy EvE and want the game to persist then those folks who are making that happen (and their respective shareholders) need paying. Just saying.
---
But to answer your question, yeah it entirely possible with enough commitment.
---
Join a corp!
---
What do you mean timegated? The fact that you need time to train a toon? There's no limit to how many you can train at the same time though.
---
Or do you mean the bazaar had some kind of limits?
---
1) expensive Pod
---
2)Didn't want the red on his killboard and knew they would scoop it
---
3)Just got scared and bailed
---
A few months ago we killed a guy that bought a rorq in low sec and tried to jump it into high sec  
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77065553/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77065553/)  Too bad it wasnt fitted  
---
an old ally buddy was wormhole diving and found an abandoned orca in the middle of a belt next to a hulk and he killed both, the guy was away to the loo when he lost both of his ships. he was using the orca for storage and a hauler and for protection from rats. guess he never heard of dual boxing
---
Something about Eve is dying
---
Looks like it was just Unspoken vs your emergency coalition or whatever you call it. Props for taking the fight when most would of docked up. Grats on the skirmish win but the narrative seems a bit off.
---
Lowsec is quite decent to begin pvping and other seeding markets or run better missions. But also to meet pilots. In hi sec you are nobody, in low people will recognize you and you can make friends or foes.
---
I'm going to half-ass my answer and genuinely insult you and your play style when I should have replied to OP with arguments.
---
You can not be a "bitter vet  of a game that is shut down. 4 years till getting  tothe end game is only enjoyable to so many players. 
---
If you want a empty space with only a few hundred players then keep campaigning for that niche.
---
If you want a eve with thousands of players with lots of content and the huge battles we have. Then you need to accept new players will not grind for 4 years, they will "go play those games."
---
Not saying titan on day one with a credit card is acceptable but flying the current meta ship within a year should be a given.
---
*points out how irrelevant your mockery is because of goon flair*
---
At these point I feel like you're being willfully obtuse.
---
Yes, it was tame gated via the skill queue (I literally already told you this).
---
&gt;4 years till getting tothe end game is only enjoyable to so many players.
---
There is no "end game" in EVE. Do they teach you there is in Pandemic Horde? They're doing you a great disservice.
---
Sounds like a good time to nerf or remove NSAs. If supers don't lock at cruiser speeds there should be time to jump to a cyno.
---
These npc's are probably the weakest ones added the recent years compared to regular triglavians, roaming drifters and diamond rats. Hardly needs a "btw these will kill you if you're afk too long" mention in the patch notes, does it?
---
&gt;Because cynos in there current form aren't required for those situations, 
---
If you believe this, you've never been in a super fleet.
---
&gt;Now major b-r5rb style fight is going to afect by these cyno changes
---
It's not going to happen in this iteration of the cyno changes.
---
I actually can and likely will pay. I just was curious  if it Eve gets to a point where it’s not worth paying because you can literally get the isk in a small amount of time. But yeah I’m actually forming a Corp with a pvp vet and we’re setting up an astrahaus in wormhole space today.
---
Give BLOPs a Covert Cloak. It's dumb a Black Ops Ship has to use a cloak that newbies use on T1 scanning frigs(faction modules aside) rather than a proper covert one.  I don't see how it's "OP" more than now given how people are clamoring about how hard they are to catch since they can instawarp out of cloak. Their bonus makes them more like a MWD/Cloak Indy than a "Black Ops". 
---
Give Nestor a Cloak as well. As pointed out, it's the only SOE Ship that doesn't have one. Kind of breaks the whole trend. Saying it's OP doesn't make it so. The Stratios is a pretty solid cruiser in it's own right, yet it still has a cloak and scan/hacking bonuses.  
---
Just my $0.02
---
And why did nobody, over the years, trained multiple characters at the same time? You can get 20M SP or something in a year, and definitely sell that char for a profit over the plex you spent. Use the profit to train more chars, next year you can sell two, start training them as soon as you can.
---
Tell me why this wasn't possible, because I feel like you're being obtuse by repeating "timegated". There's no limit of production, doesn't matter if it takes a year. If there's 20 people that will overpay a char today, go start training 30 accounts and in a year you can meet the demand.
---
I agree that now there's no need to plan  or anything, but I see a way things can snowball by simply training characters. So somebody could have done what OP, but a few years back. Injector is just immediate and more expensive. You can always just plex and wait for it to train. And if the bazaar was well stocked before, things would have been just as immediate
---
So say we all!
---
Get wrecked sissies Reeeeeeee
---
As i did not encounter them yet, i can not say something about their strenght.
---
Also, CCP themselves said in the past that HighSec will not have certain kinds of NPCs (for example battleship-rats in belts).
---
I am not necessarily against adding new challenges to highsec, but the risk/reward balance must be taken into account and it must be properly communicated.
---
Out of sight, out of mind.
---
Go and buy a CD like you know that you should!
---
Don't be surprised the one who forgets are usually veterans of Eve.
---
You know, those with almost a trillion in assets, SP over 10 accounts. All isk making maximized to get blingy on their main account and complain there's not enough victims
---
&gt; Carriers are borderline immune to blops 
---
Thats because Carriers (Capitals overall) are to good against BS (all Subcaps) not because Blops are too bad, they are just too expensive.
---
&gt;because their gigantic sig radius and piss poor speed means fighters apply fully
---
Well they are still Battleships and you know Fighters are fucking nuts right now
---
Covops cloak only needs 4 iirc
---
What? Show me please some fights where snuff keeps on fighting and winning against an umbrella, ANY umbrella.
---
Of course there are some people making mistakes, dropping few unsupported or badly supported supers etc. But in the end, there is NOTHING that can sustain a fight against capitals if both sides are equally prepared.
---
There should be a counter to the caps, not a counter to bad preparation!
---
Solution is, they don't point you, you can warp off
---
join big blob and afk under protection
---
1 thing and then I'm gonna stop arguing. First off , you suggest that people spending money on the game is making it pay to win. This has been the case for a very long time. Lots of pvpers Plex their accounts so they don't have to krab for money. This is "fine" However, when someone does the exact same thing with injectors, they are running the game and are a cancer. Now while im not going to go into how one person having a titan dosent affect you at all, I do have to mention that you really shouldn't call people cancer for such an accomplishment. Why are you mad that someone is successful?
---
Fak your F1 lag fests
---
They don't?
---
Hm.. ok. Than no one can help the guys getting caught tbh.
---
I also do stuff Semi-afk in Eve in Highsec, but the longest time i am off the screen is when i have a biobreak and only than if it is urgent.
---
But being complete AFK for longer periods? Only docked.
---
Add a low secgate to stain, collapse the meatshield regions provi and catch.
---
Why does it need to be properly communicated? I can only speak for myself, but one of the main parts I love about Invasion expansion is that it's very short on information, prompting the community to unravel the mysteries and adapt to changing mechanics. Also, if you're actually playing the game (ie not being afk/autopiloting), you don't suffer any horrible surprises because you get a warning when you're about to jump into an invasion, and these npc's don't use ewar so you're free to warp at any time. The risk has hardly increased.
---
yo, btw guys...
---
heard already multiple times that they hunt afk players and such
---
but im more afraid of just being in orca with them on the grid... they dont tackle you, do they?
---
escaping in hs in orca from scrambling frigs would be impossible &gt;.&gt;
---
I disagree. 
---
The Umbrella exists because jumping requires one click on the cyno, and two clicks on the jumping/bridging ship in order to teleport past gates, past bubbles, and past camps. And that teleport is guaranteed to place you 5000 metres from the cyno. 
---
Would you say that deleting cynos from the game would destroy the Umbrella, even if caps and supers were still in the game?
---
&gt; Either you spend the next 2 months traing covert cynos and recons and a faction cruiser or you buy injectors.
---
I think if they allowed more than 71 days so that everyone could properly train into force recon would answer your question to they did this without any intention of increasing injector/PLEX sales.
---
Ahahahahahhaa
---
But it puts off players.
---
And Eve already has a retention problem from what i did read.
---
If CCP wants to change the rules, ok, it is their game, so they can do that if they want. But if they do not do communicate properly, they might do more damage than good.
---
And AFAIK *HighSec-Carebears* are still a significant part of that playerbase.
---
OP said in another comment he was afk 90 minutes. I mean why not.. but if nobody gets to be afk, it means the mineral cost goes up
---
You know that thing you like to do?
---
It's trash. Nerf it.
---
Always good to have a fellow WH’r to pew with! Good luck setting up and hopefully bump into you before you see me coming ;)
---
nope
---
\&gt; This is good for the game, changes in a couple weeks.
---
\&gt; Training requires 71d on Force Recons.
---
\&gt; This is not a cash grab but please buy PLEX/injectors to get your Force Recons.
---
You nailed it, thats how businesses are run.
---
Yeah, someone pointed out to me that these rats do not tackle, so i have little understanding or empathy for this guys.
---
But still, it is a rule change that you can no longer get away with this and this needs to be made clear.
---
I myself will not be affected by this, because i do not go AFK for longer than a biobreak (and even than only if its urgent).
---
If i have to go AFK for longer, i usually initiate the warp back to a station and dock up.
---
Very likely you are right or it might be an investment to gain insight on markets that CCP is trying to enter like mobile and access to people that have had success in those spaces. If mobile Eve gains traction it will be interesting.
---
Have your alt join FW?
---
&gt;There's no limit of production
---
....yes there is.
---
The limit is time....
---
Look man, I'm just telling you how it was. You can argue about it all you want. But subbing multiple accounts just to train the character to sell was not an adequate return on investment for people to do it. It was so much ISK just to break even on the game time (for a year's training) and then so much ISK for the transfer - all to just break even. Not to mention breaking even on the skillbooks. There was a LOT of overhead.
---
And the people who did keep subs going just to train toons for sale - they often had to flip characters, meaning they'd buy a character, sit on it for a couple of weeks and then resell it for a higher price.
---
It was a completely different economy and the turnover was slow.
---
He doesn't have them on overview - those Sansha rats are the usual belt rats.
---
The Triglavian recon ships are frigates though, and while they do a decent amount of damage an Orca should definitely have been able to kill them first, even with T1 drones.
---
Never seen them or heard of them being formed for it.
---
Though I'm not sure it would of mattered because phantasms to fight nightmares. I assumed you guys would at-least try and spearfish a nightmare or two with plenty of chances.
---
I guess sitting at 100 and talking in local is better though. Was just a ragtag but surprised you guys didn't try anything besides orbit at 100 to whore on the fort 20mins later.
---
No tackle, you're good.
---
Very nice... But until they fix Faction Warfare good and propper, then I wont be resubbing at the end of my current 3 month stint.
---
Right now large scale fleet fights depend on a capital cyno to get on grid.  No one has really come up with a reasonable replacement for that yet.
---
They weren't really hindering rolling wormholes, just lurch hictors.  Roll holes with something else.
---
it always sucked.
---
because missiles.
---
Last person that boarded the ships gets the Killmail. Right click an empty ship in space and show info. It shows the last owner. Not as much opportunity for floating ships since POSes aren't a thing anymore.
---
It is *far*different in eve. Feel free to prove me wrong lol
---
This totally wouldn't be posted if:
---
WHs were getting local
---
Cloaking was getting changed
---
Or anything that would affect the sole PVP player, because remember their playstyle matters, not yours.
---
Submit text summary or receive no upvotes
---
Which is fine, but cynos and supers get used for things other then super umbrellas.  Like fighting other supers. And that is getting fucked over here worse then the umbrellas.
---
Ah, I didn't know. That's great. 👍
---
Praxis seems more popular for some reason.
---
Min/amarr warzone is always good for fights cant speak for cal/gal just bring some t1 frigates or destroyers and you will have a blast. Stick to the hotspots to I recommend i.e. Kamela/kormonen/auga/amamake/sisede etc you should find more fights this way. Gl with getting back into solo pvp to mate.
---
Missiles are inferior to beams/blasters in incursions because of the traveltime for missiles as well as some application issues. Your damage can take up to 30 seconds before it actually lands, whereas beams instantly land their dps.
---
Again, the problem with these NPCs is they're so strong they will even kill plenty of non-AFK players - especially miners in Covetors or Retrievers.
---
I'm not alone.
---
Repeated Off-topic request for a gate from a low sec region to high-sec.
---
You can show info on a ship that is unpiloted, and most of the time it will show the pilots avatar in the top of the Show info page. The only time it doesn't I believe is when it hadn't been piloted longer than one downtime. Only say that because I've left a ship over downtime and the next day it still showed as my ship.
---
An Orca can tank and kill them (assuming you've got combat drones in the first place and such).
---
I doubt they specifically hunt AFK players though. They'll land on me in waves even when I'm not AFK. They're also not just limited to asteroid belts.
---
Did you drop school at reading comprehension? You will be able to use covert cynos.
---
The crying just never ends.
---
Thanks, I did not notice.
---
Do the other beam ships provide shield emissions?
---
wtb transcript :p
---
Not sure why you think the solution to for ships that you say people clamour on about being hard to catch is to make it even harder to catch.
---
Even if black ops ships are notably flimsier than their t1 counterparts, it doesn't mean that they're necessarily "weak", they're still capable of impressive tank and dps, especially in comparison to cruisers.
---
I think they're fine with their bonus to cloaks considering they can jump to covert cyno's, and jump other covert-capable ships to that cyno as well. Giving then covert ops cloaking would just make pve black ops impossible to catch, they're already hard enough to catch as you said earlier.
---
They do a fuckload of damage, but in my experience you can kill even the big gangs of them before hitting 30% shield in an Orca. You'd have to be AFK (or perhaps poorly skilled/fitted) to end up in hull.
---
I spent my entire eve life maxing this bitch out....I quit
---
you realise pvp isnt the only thing that people enjoy right? a lotta people enjoys just shooting rocks and relaxing and if it werent for those people you wouldnt have ships to fight with :)
---
What? Only logi “provides shield emissions”
---
miner corps are great
---
They do so much damage they can easily kill mining barges before they finish aligning doe.
---
This is the dumbest garbage i've read in a while.
---
Weak? I'm guessing you've never encountered them yourself - and if you did, it was maybe 1 or 2. Try fighting 6 of them at once and get back to me. :p
---
As a former high sec miner...probably because it's boring, mind numbing, and low isk/hr.
---
Raven fit for “warp to me” incursion group has raven dps with shield emissions
---
There's so much more you can do in eve, but ok I guess.
---
It’s often bugged tho especially for pods, best to use a civilian gun or something
---
Hard to summarize 1.5 hours...
---
* CCP was too risk averse in the past
---
* They don't care if they lose short term angry players if the long term health if the game is improved
---
* Injectors introduced some problems but CCP would rather try to address balance issues than throw away the good parts (including huge income)
---
* Bombers may be overpowered in a post blackout environment
---
* Olmecca Gold is right that caps have too much eHP
---
* Tiericide keeps getting delayed they know but there's bigger fish to fry
---
* They know Triglavian ships are OP but the community doesn't seem to be mad about it yet

Sure it would also destroy the game. Nerf capitals results in large numbers of people quitting the game. That's not what this game needs right now. It needs to hang on to the high quality high value high skilled players who have the experience of over a decade of eve while attracting fresh blood by making it easy for them to progress into the game. Offer some opportunity for new players to catch up to the vets somewhat.
---
EVE is heavily "right tool for the job" ... better to "pretty good" many ships than singularly max one (unless it's specialised like a FAX, Freighter etc)
---
"Our gameplay" the thing we like to do, It was nerfed and shit on for 4 years. I remember you coming into every thread about capitals, cynos and other imbalances you exploited to rationalize it or say to "just bring more capitals and htfu".
---
Shoe is on the other foot now. We can hope your favorite gameplay is left floating around as a rotting corpse for 4 years and see how you adapt.
---
Is this a brave dojo video?
---
What about raven for pvp?  Or is it just a mission runner?
---
What do you mean specifically? Can you link a screenshot of it or something?
---
So when you talk about large scale battles you mean the ones between large alliances/coalitions that can easily field recons and bo to light cynos?
---
Yes they are ;)
---
Y’all shit on me for like 6 months for “Renalad” you can’t just use it willy nilly now
---
OP was afk for 90 minutes, the orca take a lot of damage before going down. I don't think there's a ship with 90 minutes align, even if you try to
---
Nah just a bunch of losers camping hisec :(
---
I did, and I prefer fighting them compared to 6 diamond kestrels or Cassandra Tyrannos, whom I believe have also started appearing without their previous triggers.
---
Actually I have. Checked around in lowsec in Black Rise, Lonetrek and Forge. It looked almost completely deserted. The only systems with some activity were Aunenen and some others that had a trig invasion. Maybe I looked at the wrong side of galaxy? I have very little experience with lowsec. So my question was actually meant sincere.
---
We are the goons. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
---
Hey thats cool thank you very much, i will do what i like :)
---
An Orca shouldn't need to align; it can fight them. I specifically said mining barges.
---
Umm
---
Blah blah blah. More nerfs that conveniently sleeze passed delve coming soon
---
I think you underestimate how much we enjoy actually having wars that mean something.
---
Lots of shite in the subreddit lately.
---
Interesting, the population has dwindled flying around there, but I almost always encounter a solo engagement or a 1v2 when I head that direction. A ton of blobs as well.
---
We call them blinders in the US
---
did you forget to include /s?
---
I too do the EXACT same thing as you and totally completely agree, restating every point made in a slightly different way, but then how MY situation is worse for since obscure playstyle reason.
---
thanks, that all i wanted to know...
---
Hahahahha, tell us where the cap touched you?
---
I hope you realize this doesn't change much, all the large groups will just have their defence fleet always on undock to jump in that 60s window.
---
Yeah CCP has some sneaky ways of doing things
---
Not hard when you want upvotes though
---
 I don't think they're that hard to catch, I was just using the "they're hard to catch" logic to make a point. I was saying that if they're "impossible" to catch, what's the difference? The decloak-warp-cloak just adds a level of tedium. 
---
I also just think BLOPs should be covert. You can fit a non-covert cloak on any ship. BLOPs just adds a speed bonus rather than a penalty.
---
So why start asking about uses for a ship... after you trained for it? Makes more sense to ask before you devote time to it.
---
yeah, i got mediums and small drones in case of CODE. appearance... &gt;.&gt;
---
but since they dont scram i can just pull drones and fly away, so thats cool...
---
im not used to afk mining, as i feel completly defenceless and my insecurities are screaming inside me :D
---
but since they roam... can you salvage their wrecks for something nasty?
---
&gt; There are KPIs more important than PCU
---
Key Performance Indicators and Peak Concurrent Players, for the laymen out there.
---
Define "mean something"
---
It doesn't require skills for the ship bonuses. It's the preferred Alpha ship.
---
I mean they choose the easiest activity in the game in the stupidest space in the game to make no money. I dont think it exactly attracts the ambitious geniuses
---
No not just that, I'm seeing really blingy ones doing incursions now.
---
There's some solo PvP fits that use ASBs and a web/grappler for damage application.
---
Of course I'm going to defend the way I like to play the game.
---
However, don't confuse me defending the way I play the game for shitting on the way you play the game.  At no point was I ever just posting  "fuck your hole rolling lurch hictors" or any stupid shit like that.
---
At no point did I ever argue for making your game shittier to make mine better, I just tried to defend against people trying to make my game shittier to make that's better.
---
So whatever. You win. You were right. Have fun with your game.
---
Risk vs reward - working as intended :)
---
You sweaty, autistic neckbeards are so fucking pathetic. A new word needs to be invented to describe the "cringe" I experience when I read posts like this.
---
^ Let this be an example of someone who really doesn't understand.
---
Welcome to goons online
---
generic response from an obvious wher/highseccer/lowseccer about how you need to adapt or die
---
Nice, now imaging rats mass warp out once carrier lands in anomaly and you need to bubble it to farm in anything big.
---
8-plated Aeon with MWD running is the closest I found and it still warp under 1 minute.
---
Dunno what the salvage is like. I had one drop loot (worth about 5m) but that seems to be very rare.
---
No. Just bring mobile cyno jammers. It's literally why they exist
---
Ah, did I break your narrative bubble?
---
I'm sorry but please explain since you seem to be an expert in things that haven't happend yet
---
i love how rise intentionally misunderstands that the latest change was about money grabbing, then said blackout would be a bad way to get extra money.
---
no shit rise, that's why people are saying the cyno change is money grabbing not the blackout change.
---
The majority of the people who don't see this as a good thing are mostly concerned about how it will affect their ability to move capitals around.  This is the point, it's aimed at trying to reduce the proliferation of capitals and drive fleets back to more affordable, maneuverable and ultimately cheaper ship classes.   Bring back massive battleship fights with only a small number of caps .
---
And I'm saying that logistics gameplay is so boring for any individual character involved that is was clearly intended to be a multiboxed endeavor. 
---
Which directly refutes the basis of your argument: that all gameplay involving cynos was meant to be cooperative in nature.
---
If I'm right, then this is in fact a cashgrab because it requires signifigantly more training for multi boxed gameplay, meaning more MCTs will be sold.

Upvoted

controlled stress is relaxing in it's own way.

Sounds like Eve wasn't the game for them

Thank you for this post.  Always nice to have a good laugh first thing in the morning! Oh, and have an upvote, lol.
---
[deleted]
---
He specifically points out that there is plenty of time to train into cyno five between the announcement and the change.
---
As has been said before, outside the realm of helicopter dicking, these changes just don't work
---
upvotes and downvotes are no different than likes on social media:  stupid and meaningless.  This is the lamest thing about Reddit.
---
The confessor does maybe 50% more damage and the coercer has a very difficult time fitting any tank at all.
---
I don't  are about up votes, I'm just sharing this podcast because I thought people should hear it. Feel free to pay for a transcript service. I recommend Rev.
---
Have they actually given a hard date for the change? Must admit 2 months would be nice, just because it isn't JUST cyno 5 but all the skills to fly the ships.
---
What are these cyno changes? I've been out of the loop.
---
-when you didn't get it
---
So they are ok with losing "angry players" in the short term, while having no tiercide for the ones that stick around and having an OP ship that everyone has to pick if they want to be competitive...
---
Damnit, I DID click it.  Just couldn't NOT click it...
---
I don't know about you, but I generally don't sit in an apparently empty 0.0 system with combat probes out waiting for someone to jump in. And if I do have combat probes out...probably don't light a cyno?
---
They are mega OP, they're designed to compete with capitals rather than subcaps and as such are absolutely mad when it comes to small scale gangs. We just don't care because small gang has been fucked for so long that dealing with souped up battlecruisers and battleships are a walk in the park compared to fighting instagibbing supers and haw titans.
---
yet another oblivious comment. his stupidity is infuriating me too much - i'm not getting in to this one.
---
I did.
---
I've always applauded rats that bail when shit hits the fan, always seemed odd when the anomaly had massive amounts of ships all hitting you and then the last one just sticks around shooting like he'll somehow accomplish my death now that he's all alone

Why don't you two just get married already?  Jeez boys, it IS legal most places now.

cruiser V, Recon 1 yea, plenty of time =) Rise is silly
---
Thank you for the summary, I can't stand listening to Matterall and his yes men
---
Is that from their website?
---
Lets put it like this - if you get hit by them in a small ship youre not a good player. Most of the fleet in the gif was moving at like 800-900m/s at best.
---
What about a dino in a dino suit?
---
But they do that all the time now and we'd like to see something different.
---
yep.
---
It would be nice to see CCP on some other talk shows that are a little more critical of them than just talking in stations.
---
Depends on the alliance/FC. Some alliances will do some SRP for FC's "pet" doctrines if they are cheap. Some FCs give SRP themselves. Sometimes not. Really just depends. Personally I usually give some SRP, like 10 mil for a caracal (which after insurance covers most of the cost), and more for a command dessie, like 40 mil.
---
Please do....

They have all of the meaning that we attribute to them, actually. Posting upvote shilling shite like this probably means OP wants upvotes, ergo they have meaning to him. I think garbage quality upvote shills don’t deserve their upvotes, so I downvote, thus taking something meaningful away. 
---
Currency in most nations has no inherent value, either. But don’t conflate not having value with not having meaning.
---
Stupid though? Nail on the head.
---
Imagine thinking something is like something lmao
---
Faction/Deadspace modules often don't require the level of skill T2 modules do. I would have to look it up, but I believe Alpha incursion runners have to bling their ships up quite a bit to meet minimum resistances/tank and DPS due to the lack of skills.
---
I am in a very large coalition and would like to disingenuously inform you that this won't hurt me at all but it *will* hurt some "little guy" that I've made up in my head and feel superior to because I'm taller than he is.

LOL.  Here, have an upvote.

Hey man... that hurts my feelings.
---
&gt;And I'm saying that logistics gameplay is so boring for any individual character involved

Believe it or not but a few people in this game actually enjoy space trucking. Not all of the people that actually do it, but some of them.

Well to be fair we all had a change to genocide Goons when they fled to Delve. Nobody chose that option so now we live in a prison of our own sins.

Gotta do something to entertain yourself in between flakes I guess.

wow! 12 mil!

This questions thread isn't for CCP however sometimes CCPers do reply, this is more for players to ask questions to the community. Your best bet to get a CCPer to respond to your question is tagging their username or seeking them out on twitter, discord or the official forums.

Criticism in 2019 what is this heresy!
---
There wouldn't be free kills if you brought an escort. Like you should have to, you fat, slow, beautiful, juicy loot piñata.
---
Seriously there was an entire time in history when shipping goods without an escort was asking to be pirated. Why should Eve enjoy a complete and total lack of piracy because you want to be completely untouchable while playing Space Junk Hoarder 2019? It's ridiculous.
---
Nobody cares about FacWar besides FacWar so I doubt it will get fixed. Take your venture changes and say thanks
---
A rack of 7 smartbombs warping around cloaked give me the chills and hope it never happens.
---
This is a top level summary. Listen and make up your own mind.
---
That's just shy of 3 bil, btw
---
They are different. Most ships in EvE 'punch' well either down or across the ship classes. The Triglavian ships 'punch' well up.
---
They are pretty easy to counter at the same class level.
---
Well, a war just for the sake of having a war... Isn't as fun
---
obvious goon bias incoming but any of the INN shows if the host is right, sometimes boat can be a bit overzealous and that puts people off, but overall I'd just like to see more talk shows in general. They are great to listen to as a podcast.
---
There would have been celebrations around eve if this happened
---
Small of your back so when you do hook up he has to star at his own mug while going at it?
---
Bombers are already too overpowered. Boosh plus bombers are the most dominate doctrine currently in eve and they have almost zero risk in the hands of a monkey like Olmeca. In the hands of a great fc like Pando or Elo, they are unkillable.
---
Not gonna disagree, but there's also something special about tanking
---
Ah, thanks for that. I'm mostly inexperienced, but read up much. I'll try to test the waters a bit more
---
You should also add that you didn't read most of the comment because your attention span is too short for how much he wrote.
---
Check out [suitonia's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/suitonia) he often roam's in very cheap fits that are designed to fight until they die. T1 destroyers work great for this sort of stuff since a lot of people underestimate their firepower and will just ram you to get tackle. If you start out with cheap ships and set yourself a budget you can buy 5-10 of one ship, lose them all and see what you learned from flying them.
---
Ok I am wrong then :D
---
People would probably be less angry if instead of nerfing everything into the ground they introduced counterplay.
---
DELET ECM DRONES \&gt;:(

Damn, didn't even consider that, glad it's someone else's blunder I'm learning from through
---
WTS Pando corpse
---
When your boss said ' go play the meta', I don't think this is what he meant... He did mean this?  Oh, carry on.
---
Thats probably the most krab answer you could have given. "I don't join fleets except im forced to do it". Then why even play the game if not for fun?
---
I guess you can get torched on a warp in, if the titan anticipate
---
i want to ask some questions    
---
1) Do you think that bots did not inflate those pve stats?    
---
2) Have you actually asked or have been a part of small alliances like those in tribute that are actually thriving in the blackout era?     
---
3) Do you think that july or august would have the same amounts of kills without the blackout?
---
I mean the people that unironcally believe those things are obviously going to downvote ROFL
---
F to LUMPY and FUM8. They tried their best.
---
Upvotes and downvotes influence how high the posts on reddit get. By up and downvoting you influence what other people get to see and therefore, in a tiny way, bend the narrative, leading to circle-jerk behaviour that is far worse on reddit than most other social sites.
---
Fuck it I'd come back to haunt their nightmares...
---
Exactly, like I said, they are they lamest thing about Reddit.
---
Also covert ships trade some of their combat stats compared to their non covert equivalents meaning black ops would be even weaker with a covert cloak. Personally im fine with how blops work, seeing to how stupid supers have become blops is comparably balanced with their limited projection.
---
Recruit a friend 1m sp + starter pack 1m sp = 2m sp. I wonder.....
---
Who tf cares about up votes
---
It depends on what you do and how you do it.  Can you earn the cash?  Yes.
---
Will you enjoy the process.... that is the big question. Anybody of substance has friends and alliances they use to buy game cards. It’s absolutely unethical to utilize funds from your corporation for free play time....
---
Few people audit the records.
---
There are some afk methods of earning cash but if you cannot afford a 15 buck a month subscription, there are greater issues at play.
---
Some r/cringetopia material right here.
---
There's nothing in the rules against it, go ahead.
---
&gt; they are more committed to listening to dissenting voices
---
So when are we getting these ansiplex nerfs? Dissenting voice btw.
---
Yeah, you're right. I completely forgot to count the SMA contents for some reason.
---
CCP should remove the ability to warp cloaked
---
I know. :(
---
That should only be possible when you don't know theres a titan in the first place as "good" player (allthough in all fairness it's hard to define good i guess, but i'd count knowing how to deal with aoe doomsdays among it)
---
kinda proving the point that has been raised that it's a money grab when the first solution you suggest to me involves paying irl cash.
---
*shrug*
---
The real narrative noone is touching, Rote/unspoken had their caps waterboarded by a single dic.  Very skilled.

---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Can't you stash cyno ships is the fleet maintenance bay? Board them on field and light? And couldn't u light a covert (as said above) and bring in a load of regular cyno ships to light? One of them will live long enough, no?
---
Cycling a jammer isn't too hard, but jumping packaged ships into a fortizar in a hostile system can be very useful
---
They could sit around cloaked anyways and you would never know they were there, they just have to decloak to warp.
---
and the kinetic rig is wrong, in that it is the armor version
---
I don't think i ever refuted that. I still think cyno changes are needed. Yes they're not optimal like this but thats another discussion.  
---
Regarding moneygrab i think they just combined something thats necessary for the game at this point with something thats convenient for them. You still do have time to skill for the most necessary things (covert frig cynos for jf's) but they also offer shortcuts. Caps abd supers im pretty sure were never intended to be operated all by yourself though and you should be able to find someone in your alliance that can already use recons.
---
let me reply.   
---
1) we definitely lost players, but they were players not willing to adapt or bots. So they werent eve players no. If i can handle 2000 nerfs in pvp they can handle the blackout.   
---
2) We will lose some players but many oldies have returned im roaming with people that i havent seen since 2013, and yes in the long run it will help, people liked eve for being a hard game not a farming simulator.    
---
3) I really think its better to not have 40k more dudes pveing inflating prices and never losing ships. In every risk there is reward, in this case there is no risk, an acceptable loss would 10% of the isk you make, now go ask all those super and rorqs out there what % of their isk they have lost their last 2 years compared to what they have made.   
---
4) It will not spiral down as it didnt with blackout, everyone was talking about thousands of unsubscribes and AT WORST we have lost 500-1k if not gained in actual people and lost in alts.   
---
5) CCP made "game killing moves" and i applaud their balls, and as the graph has shown above, IF we have lost PCU its neglectable.    
---
6) You cant be asking for expansions all the time, triglavians and abyssal space is a huge addition pve and pvp wise that is still underutilized. They cannot possibly introduce new pve and pvp in the game every few months. Trig ships are nice, abyssals are a nice change of pace, and abyssal arenas are what some people were asking for.    
---
now let me ask you back some questions as well.   
---
1) What is the risk-reward of a cap ship under an umbrella.   
---
2) Do you think that blackout killed nullsec isk printing bots.   
---
3) Do you think that the game will not die in a few years with this capital proliferation.    
---
4) What do you think is the rate of generated isk/materials vs the destroyed isk/materials.    
---
5) When was the last time that nullsec was the high end pve and the best isk in the game.   
---
6) Who benefits more from the skill injectors and what should be done with them.   
---
p.s. im not having a beef with you i enjoy a non retarded convo and if you wanna discuss it elsewhere than here Ryu Chaos#1570 is my discord
---
Cyno change is Garbo, should have just restricted it for use by Capitals, recons and blops are to squishy to be cyno ships...works for dropping solo folks, but will never stand in fleet fight escalation.
---
Caps still due to a large fleet of sub caps though. They take a large amount of effort to make and the reason the large blocs have a lot of them is that a lot of people do a lot of work to make them .
---
It’s only reasonable then that a ten man cruiser gang shouldn’t be able to take down a super because even though it’s 10 people it’s much less effort put down on the field. Similarly a 100 man cruiser fleet shouldn’t be able to kill 10 supers in direct combat.
---
What sub caps can do much more easily is kill sub caps which the recent changes have made laughably easy. Ratting subcaps are dying in droves, excavators are being picked off left and right. 
---
People in smaller ships are able to poke at the weaker parts of a blocs money income. It’s unreasonable to expect a small gang to be able attack the strongest part of a large groups fleet and come out on top l
---
&gt; Caps and supers im pretty sure were never intended to be operated all by yourself
---
everything was intended to be done solo the moment they decided having multiple characters that could be logged in simultaniously was acceptable.
---
so ccp vs goons is the narrative? when ccp rise will be renamed to ccp falls xD
---
:/
---
Eve has its own official rmt. You pay real money in exchange for Plex, an in-game item that can be sold for isk, which in turn can (arguably probably solely) be used to buy injectors for the skillpoints to fast track the knowledge/training.
---
Someone who has lots of disposable income can in theory buy lots of Plex, sell the Plex in-game and use the resulting isk to buy skill injectors. I believe there is an example of someone doing this at least once to skill up very quickly to a titan.
---
i do fleets. they're fun. but it's MORE fun when you have an objective. i don't think you understand how nullsec players think strategically, or at least the upper folks. we want to use our big toys for something with significance. we put a fair bit of effort into obtaining such things, and we're not about to just throw them away.
---
ah yep was waiting for the "what about the smaller groups!!!!" concern trolling, you didn't disappoint (eventually)
---
What’s your rapid fire and surgical strike skill at?
---
Also they might be talking about ramped up DPS, ingame only shows you that once you’ve ramped up on a target
---
But nullsec is supposed to be a completely lawless wasteland where everyone is out for themselves, constantly stabbing eachother in the back because content is more important than friends. I think i heard ccp falcon say it on a eve pulse or something.
---
That were bosons there. Way wider area of effect and shorter spoolup. Still dodgeable but only if you know its coming. Allthough by the looks of it they should have seen it way in advance and i do agree they're usually rather skilled pilots.
---
u/verybadateve what's the story here?
---
they're pandering to the solo droppers... which is why all these changes are garbo
---
Oh I didn't even know there were different AoE titan weapons. It's true the lance doesn't look hard to dodge, even when there's multiple.
---
Where else can they get softball questions and hosts that make any garbage they spew out shine like a dorodango.
---
If you're ratting in a super and aren't in fleet you deserve to get danked.
---
You know CCP has like no dev time right? There’s other priorities
---
Covert cynos don’t last ten minutes.
---
Yeah you got the lance which is a long spear and the boson that is cone shaped and shorter but much wider. Both have a spoolup with a visual indicator though.
---
L5 missions and R64 moons are not new player friendly at all. One requires carrier(s) and puller alts, the other needs a group with the ability to fight the lowsec powers that be. 
---
But yeah I think the LS options need to be improved and made more consistent.
---
He didn’t want the embarrassment of the KM. This way he doesn’t have to tell his buddies he screwed up. Probably someone like IDRONE or Gori Thane.
---
Because they are throwing shit at the wall to distract us for the next 18-24 months while they work on the new player experience?
---
They're one of the strange cases where huge fleets of them don't really stack well outside of Kikis (which I would argue *are* OP), but they're excellent for smaller entities punching up that can't field 200+ man fleets since they can still output competitive long-term damage.
---
Hard not to know when you're the one putting holes in the hull.
---
Good luck countering a Kikimora with a t1 destroyer

---
Problem found.
---
Except kikis are basically omen navies in destroyer sizes.
---
maybe try not highsec mining in an orca? Seems like you were asking for it to me.
---
Having it on caps is literally half the problem they're trying to address.
---
The day when the scales are balanced, you can go solo or group, pve or pvp, small or large scale and all the risk and reward is proper. 
---
Until then, upvote pvp ideas downvote pve ones like an npc
---
Solo orcas are pretty damn good.
---
*shuttle
---
&gt;This also gives me the opportunity to call you a noob because you lost a Raven to high sec rats in 2007.
---
so much this.
---
this happened to me recently (not 2007 though)
---
Even what you’re saying is mostly right, i’m going to use this comment to shove in my personal beliefs of what will make Eve great again.
---
They get countered hardcore at the larger muninn fleet, ferox fleet, etc level, but when it comes to smaller scale small gang stuff they're leagues ahead of the competition, both for fighting up and fighting down.
---
Wow I almost got flair baited nice try gon
---
U smokin the cool aid bruh
---
A cormorant gang is bad news for a kiki fleet.
---
A jackdaw gang is worse news.
---
This makes me sad that this is true
---
With far less ehp and a range of roughly 40 km.
---
2.27m SP = 5-6 LSI ~ 5-6b ISK ~ 1700 PLEX ~ 65€
---
Plenty of time
---
Obiligatory /s
---
Jesus thats bullshit "we think strategically we want to do important stuff". You cant even do important stuff when you blue half the game and have all sort of treatys with the other half. But that is fine for the vast majority of null players as they are just turbokrabs that prefer krabbing 5 hours instead of going to a fun 1 hour fleet.
---
And like I said before as long as people hold to their little internet power they have they will never go to war when there is a small chance of losing.
---
Are you kidding?   Hilmar's considered EVE a throw-away game useful only for funding CCP's "real" projects... you know, all the ones that failed...
---
gf
---
When one dictor shits on your entire corp's effort to drop on a dread. Jeez unspoken is such a garbage tier alliance letting a nooby coalition get the better of them.
---
Ok lets put it like this: the people who do balancing and the ones that do finances are definetly not the same at CCP \^^
---
Miners are autistic and wormholes are Nazi cucks. I think.
---
tank your ship maybe ?
---
epithal can reach 18k ehp and 7s align. rats don't deal 2K DPS as a group…

---
oh is it shuttles? my bad
---
I absolutely love the rep bonus, it didnt need it but I love it.  It's the gun that fucked this ship.
---
Looks more like a blob to me tbh.
---
But higher speed/warp speed, low sig, good tracking. Role wise they are quite similar
---
"sighted" does not mean "attacking players"
---
&gt; CCP was too risk averse in the past
---
&gt; They don't care if they lose short term angry players if the long term health if the game is improved
---
Long term, they are demoralizing customers, shaking faith in the company, scaring new players off, and making it even more difficult to provide the fights that CCP uses to advertise their game.  Long time players, especially the more casual players, are being put off logging in because CCP's recent changes have been hurting content availability.  The rorq pilots don't want to feel like they are only there to be shot at and die, the pvp pilots want actual fleets and wars (wormholers and small gang players not included, most of them just want free kills), which CCP has deincentivized with how many advantages defenders get, cap pilots want to log on for actual cap brawls which are already non-existent recently, and only going to get rarer.  People feel more and more pushed into the mega-alliances, which is not really a healthy thing for the game.
---
&gt; Injectors introduced some problems but CCP would rather try to address balance issues than throw away the good parts (including huge income)
---
Injectors have caused some of the most massive problems in eve.  They won't be changed because they are a cash cow.
---
&gt; Bombers may be overpowered in a post blackout environment
---
Probably true, especially given how popular Gokus/Stukas are.
---
&gt; Olmecca Gold is right that caps have too much eHP
---
I disagree with this particular stance, I think personally think the issue is more in line with the power of FAX reps.  I think there should be a diminishing return on the number of reps you can receive, and a nerf to repping power of faxes, turn them into remote support ships instead of space priests that are a "I win the fight because I have more reps" button.
---
&gt; Tiericide keeps getting delayed they know but there's bigger fish to fry
---
There are bigger fish to fry, but CCP focuses on killing minnows by dropping dynamite in the lake next to the intended target.  The bigger fish should be citadel balance, cap balance, sov balance (current cyno jammers anyone?)  fixing the complete homogenization of effective sub cap doctrines (muninns, bombers, trigs) 
---
&gt; They know Triglavian ships are OP but the community doesn't seem to be mad about it yet
---
The community is more focused on the other problems.
---
&gt; Their goal is not to kill cap fights, and if that happens they will adjust
---
Cap fights will not happen with the proposed cyno changes.  There is already a lack of incentives for cap fights as is, and the proposed changes will make it so whoever gets their caps on field first wins, negating the need for a cap fight at all. 
---
Yes, but as far as indicators go, that is a pretty major one in regards to overall game health, and it is one of the few that the player has access to.  From a player perspective, the drop in PCU does not bode well for the game's long term health.
---
&gt; Rise reads /r/eve every day probably
---
Of course he does, where else would he get these *great* ideas from?
---
They listen, but it is just ASMR to them.
---
Please bear in mind, my points aren't just "nullseccer whining" but the trends of what I've seen and heard as an alliance leader.
---
Obligatory mocking response to said request.
---
A completely different company is developing that tech. They're just letting them use Eve's intellectual property for their test/demo game.
---
Oh yeah, it's the one that used to be useful but now is only good for being a brick tanked covert cyno.
---
Request for your stuff.
---
because maybe mining in HS does not require you to dock when you need to poo ?
---
Your comments read like a really bad bot that accidentally got trained on a set of trollposts
---
Fucking WHOOSH
---
It would make them even harder to hunt which is already stupid hard. They can prealign cloaked and instawarp as soon as they see danger, but sometimes they fuck up warping to 100 at a station and thats when you catch them. Introducing covert is just killing content and also making the SB proteus useless.
---
I always thought it wasnt, I thought that every border null point would have a million campers behind it.
---
Maybe I should just get better at finding info
---
Oh man... You have no idea how people catch supers these days. If you do it right there is litterally nothing you can do to prevent getting caught in a super even with the ability to cyno.
---
By the time you've warped to the next anomaly they already have a inhib and bubble up. You litterally cant do anything.
---
If you do not follow these procedures, live with the risk.
---
Ganking miners is a thing, you know? So i'd rather be there and at least try to save my ship when something happens than wake up in my new clone in the station without knowing what caused it.
---
Have you flown them against a destroyer fleet? 
---
They are good ships that have their strong point sure, but they have their counters just like anything else.
---
This. The loudest voices are the solo droppers or droppees whining about how hard the game is. Cyno needed changing, but this is a knee-jerk short-sighted reaction to complaining, that's it. I already got rid of my JF because these changes will have made me train for 135+ days to get all of my cyno apts usable.
---
Get fucked goonies haha.
---
Maaaybe some people can't chose when they NEED to AFK.
---
And that's the reason why they only play in HS, mining : because they can remain in safety even if they need to get AFK for an extended period of time.
---
well i doubt they were coming for tea and crumpets...
---
I think you should be able to see Alliance/good standing members in local at least, to at least see who in your alliance or who friendly is there with you.
---
Or is it already that way?
---
And I dont mean alliance/Corp chat
---
patch note did not say anything.  "some thing might happen" is not really of any help.
---
What kinda dessie small gang can even kill a solo drek lol
---
As a workaround... just use EVEMON and export/import. Pretty sure the skill queue code is buried deep.
---
Well...here I go screwing myself. 
---
Harpies, Jackdaws, Talwars, arty thrashers, Rail corms etc will dick pwn Kiki’s in numbers generally equal to or greater than their own. Especially if you are looking at isk war. Add a hyena/kitsune etc and you really start to put there hurt on. Most FC will just disengage at that point. Some will try to do elite maneuvers. Realistically though kill 1-2 and you payed for your hole fleet
---
Not really, oni is usually a mwd sniper boat in a nano gang. The 40 km range on the Kiki hurts that.
---
They have their strong points but they are different. Why I love flying them, completely different play style via the spool up mechanics.
---
Thank you! Appreciate the kind words :)
---
I think it's random. 
---
rats warp out at random occasion, sometimes even when their target is about to die.
---
1. Jackdaws.
---
2. We are talking about the destroyer fighting destroyers not the battlecruiser fighting destroyers.
---
Statistics that represent the right type of information.
---
And are accurate.
---
This is what is needed.
---
Goons have a culture of damaging the game.
---
EVE does not need goons.
---
yep so in the end you helped them actually find maybe the game which would have suited them better, i also think they would have left eve anyway someday.
---
I can say stuff with nothing to back it up too, but I dont.
---
Fact: soe ships are cloaky, except the nestor.
---
Opinion: The thought of a cloaked nestor(or entire soe fleet) in a wormhole makes my skin crawl and I love it.  Its fucking scary, and it should be. 
---
Someone down the line went further and asked for it to have a jump drive.  Dont be silly guys, nobody would ever fly the other blops if the Nestor could do the job.  It just needs a cloak, like it always has.
---

---
So as a carebear in high-sec, I encountered them once in my battleship (the Carebear-inator if you will) outside a dock, tried my luck, regretted that, docked, got a 1.5mil repair bill, lesson learned, avoid them. Avoiding them is surprisingly easy.
---
So my thing is: where are they/what are they doing where they're a high-sec problem like this? They take forever to engage unless you engage them, and I've only ever seen them at jumps and outside docks. Again, they take a year to engage anyway.
---
They're just not THAT much of an issue from what I can gather, so what activities are they doing in high-sec that's causing this amount of rage?
---
Seriously, I don't really null/low-sec often at all, but I'm kind of with you guys here. It seems like largely a non-issue. Don't autopilot or AFK out of station? Those were good rules in general because even before this that was a great way to lose your ship even in high-sec.
---
Who are you to judge tea drinkers ?
---
1 )Bots are hard to track but 200k average PVE kills to 30k is not only bots.
---
2) yes not the one in tribute
---
3) yes we would have roughly the same kills +- 10k like all years.
---
I'm English; I know my tea.
---
&gt; But it puts off players.
---
This reminds me of the old days, were the tutorial was literally dumping you you in space, on grid with a rat, and you had to figure out how to kill it before it killed you.
---
Somehow the game survived years of that.
---
except we are talking about NPC rats, not gankers.
---
A correctly tanked orca in 1.0 won't get ganked by gankers. That's the reason so many people switched to orcas.
---
I don't know whether to upvote for the fuck CCP or downvote for the yay age of chaos? wat do?
---
Hey, its not really a problem with this, its a problem with a submechanic of abother thing which no one has really done since 2014 because its dumb and not a problem. Also, I thought bombers bar was neutral!!!
---
i want falcon on the meta show and shittalking in stations.
---
Caps have too much EHP, but bomber fleet evaporates them in minute/s. So bombers are also OP. Solution - nerf them both. 
---
Caps cost insane amount of investment  in skills and ISK, bombers cost next to nothing. Do the math. 
---
With the current direction I feel bad for players who want to invest their time to EVE - it was second job before, it will be your live now. Save some $ for therapy. 0/
---
upvoting for the title
---
Would be interesting if when they started shooting you in hi sec an option appeared to call for concord or something.
---
NPC null region solo or small group is a better alternative and if you do scanning you'll find HS connections so you can dump your inventory.
---
Wormholes and small gangers don't want free kills. We want fights that don't escalate straight to broken OP HAW dread + FAX, or supers. Can't even be arsed to read the rest of your drivel after that moronic comment lmao.
---
Rats should warp out unless you disrupt them.
---
Either one.  Just make sure it gets bumped one way or the other so more people step in shitpost.
---
Laughing my Ass Off
---
Everything about your post indicates you are tone deaf to anything outside of your null sec bubble of wants. You further cement your prejudice by commenting about how small gangs and wormholers don't matter because "they just want free kills." 
---
Sorry, but these changes are badly needed for the overall health of the game. 
---
Btw- Reps do have a diminishing return based on the number you receive.

Triglav ships arent very good at fleet vs fleet stuff due to constant target switching. That´s why there are literally no triglav fleets around, and I have never seen anyone complain about them.  
---
FW for example though, the Kikimora completely dominates in the small plex. Unprecedented range, application and tracking, decent speed, decent tank. You would be very hard pressed to counter it within the plex´s limitation. And last time I checked T3Ds couldnt enter those.
---
There are other "strong" triangle ships, like the Drek, but I don´t think they are OP. Kikimora tho, for me, borderline OP.
---
Cloaked titans on the wh, decloaked + started "blind" bosons while we were midwarp to wh cloaked, died while landing from warp (unable to jump, of course) 
---
/u/Benaxle if you're curious
---
You do realize most of those subcap fleets move around by cynos, right?
---
Unless your NDA'd job also comes with a gov't security clearance and access to sensitive, classified information.
---
No NDA would prevent you from telling anyone where you work. It would at most prevent you from telling anyone about what you specifically work with and prevent you actively releasing or discussing confidential, internal company information.
---
Even security clearance jobs don't prevent you from divulging information about where you work. 
---
So, OP. Where do you work?
---
Are slower than a Drek and will get chunked hard within damage range. You're not going to kill a Drek with a reasonable amount of Jackdaws before it kills at least a couple Jacks and pulls out to rep.
---
Some say every wormhole has one but you can't see them
---
Imagine being this butthurt about forgetting to log in when you where supposed to in a shitty "log in event" and not getting free SP.
---
Come check out the system of Atreen. Currently there is a large group of very old players dumping Isk into what we call the Atreen Project. To make a long story short we want to make a pocket of occupied space with corps and players alike. You’re welcome to just come yourself or bring a whole Corp the whole idea is that even if the corps are at war we still have a pocket of people that chat and realize it’s a fun game. Right now everyone is on good terms and we have a conglomerate of every type of group there and we’d love to have more.
---
Join he chat channel “Atreen Universal” and ask around for more details. It’s a really really fun relaxed group of corps and people.
---
So a bunch of unknowns died lol. Gotta love ESI breaking lol.
---
Hm yeah I'm gunna need those TPS reports on my desk by Friday.
---
It's 15m
---
Bro who needs to imagine.  I live it everyday.  You know what it's like to take a shit and have to wipe away the blood as well?
---
Just scam a bloke for 2 injectors and roll out in a nomen
---
and England is definitely not kown for invading foreign countries for tea …
---
hasn't been that way for years, if ever.   A few years ago most of null was occupied and fought over, but CCP has been screwing it up for a while so that now you have a few pockets at best that are active.  The rest is just wasteland that nobody really wants.
---
What people who haven't played it tend not to realise about EVE is that the sheer age of the game (EVE is old enough to legally have sex now) means that there are, as you have discovered, a really large number of reasonably complete gameplay loops up and running. 
---
[The EVE Career chart is just enormous.](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg) I'm pretty sure that there's no game out there that comes even close.
---
Obviously, this data is inaccurate, but I can't explain to you why I know, because that's NDA, so you just have to take my word for it. 
---
Also, if you'd just buy more plex, this problem would solve itself.
---
The issue is Hilmar is going hands on, not the other way around. The man is an idiot.
---
Really, so when we respond with 100+ nerds to your 25 man gang, you don't complain about "dirty blobbers"?  Yes, cap escalations are a problem, but please don't pretend that they are the only reason you don't get good fights in nullsec.
---
I'm getting back into the game after a pretty long break, what are the recent changes?
---
I had alliance members offer me a million SP worth of injectors just to get me to keep playing, but I was/am way too bitter towards CCP over the whole mass reply email shenanigans.
---
1.03\^5 would actually be +16% DPS. Which is really super nice.
---
&gt; And I'm saying that logistics gameplay is so boring for any individual character involved that is was clearly intended to be a multiboxed endeavor. 
---
No it was not "clearly intended to be a multiboxed endeavor". It was intended to a thing you have to organize people to accomplish.
---
Sure, a lot of the gameplay in Eve is not the most exciting, but for me the fun part of Eve as always the organizational things. Like the sorts of things you can accomplish if you organize enough people.
---
Anything other than TiS where Matterall is all over himself trying to be nice. They need someone willing to tell them live that they are wrong, and be able to say why.
---
Why are you bullying Feeder Squad Kendarr?
---
Everybody thought drifters randomly attacking things in nullsec was great. 
---
Now that Trigs are randomly attacking things in highsec, IT'S CHAOS
---
Oh cloaked titans. That explains some other kills from the same titan duo. I wonder if there will be more aimed module for subcap in the future. Bombs seems fun. Titans don't look really fun.
---
6)
---
i can ask since i pay for it, without innovation/invention of really new mechanics the game stagnates which it does. A lot of the current situation is CCP made, and now instead of acknowledging their mistakes they try the most biased approach. They even accept the fact that player's will leave. The new player experience compared to a modern era mmo is more than terrible. The teaching progress is terrible. The retaining stats of those players shows it. PVE in this game is dull, abyss is great risk great reward with a % chance you lose your gila. Incursions etc. got nerfed. I guess CCP needs some better mission/raid system like other games have for all different spaces J space, K space (all securitys) with different rewards depending on difficulty and risk of the region.
---
1) What is the risk-reward of a cap ship under an umbrella. 
---
I agree that umbrella is not a good answer for every gang shows up, but sadly wormhole holes which can be rolled until you find the one which suits you are also not a good mechanic. When it comes to new players in nullsec the changes hurt them. I don't think we will see less supers or rorquals, i think less systems will be used less spreadout to have more "force recon" cyno ships avaiable.
---
2) the bots went into hisec and do either abyss 3 passive fit or other stuff, we lost some bots of course but i think the botting problem will not be solved by no local (aka free intel, while dotlan gives free intel on npc killed). i think blackout is ok, but also that dotlan should not get informations about npc killed. And that there should be a wormhole jammer.
---
3) the game will die anyway in a few years without innovation/investment. Every major block agrees that capital's need a rework but ccp never delivers. So they adjust stuff and try to chaos us but shitting on many players.
---
4) the material created (by ccp's own making moongo rorqual etc.) outweighted the materials destroyed, like in our modern western wealthy societys. Blackout changed the fact now its less materials created and isk farmed then destroyed. 
---
5) always if you are an old player you know that only wormhole space with the only risk of eviction has/had better rewards. Nullsec always was kind of save with local, and now without local but umbrella's up. The problem don't lies in security the problem lies in skill injectors and skaleable income. While you can try to nerf the income in the end you will hit the new players who don't have the means to scale.
---
6) while new players can benefit from the really guys who profit from it are either RMTer or people with a lot of wealth to scale their income stronger. Skill Injector made the game an arms race for capitals and on top an arms race of scaleable income like rorqual's.
---
And i still say nerf the cynos won't change the problems of the game it will just give some dudes some rorquals/maybe super kill who cry that umbrellas are unfair, when umbrellas are unfair in their mind. Do they think the new guy find it fair when he gets attacked by nullified nano cloaky gangs which a supcap fleet cant even catch while a super fleet says FU and they run with their tails. In both cases he will die, the only difference now is those nano gangs want to scaleup the killboard with rorquals/supers without scaling up the numbers of their pilots and the risk of escalating themselves and get outformed by the umbrella powers.
---
&gt;If people are not mad at CCP then they are mad at the goons (grr goons), PanFam or something else.
---
People are always mad at all 3 of those entities.
---
A jackdaw in sharpshooter mode goes 1870. 2,439 in propulsion mode.
---
A mwd drek goes 1511. If you poly carbon the rigs it around 1704.
---
The drek has an optimal range of 50km with Meson. 58 with a tracking computer and optimal range.
---
The jackdaw has an optimal range of 80km in sharpshooter.
---
A duel rep drek reps 629/s with a standard somewhat blinged out fit. A jackdaw hits for 215 DPS in sharpshooter and 161 DPS in propulsion.
---
Assuming mistakes were not made and you dont warp into the drek at zero, your faster than him and can easily switch between modes. Assuming you have the range you want (60+) it takes 4 jackdaws to out DPS the duel rep tank while keeping the range open.
---

&gt;Opinion piece from a retard
---
You got that right at least
---
damn that sucks. yeah cloaked titans with boson ready are annoying af
---
OP seems weirdly mad about something I don't understand.
---
"I love the new changes! But I'm mad and wont play! But keep on doing the changes!"
---
It's actually the result of a fix for another bug, because range collision on the types IDs and some items ids.
---
Really?  Nullsec represents a HUGE part of the game, and what happens in nullsec effects the rest of the game in ways that wormholes and lowsec do not.  Small gang players have been complaining for YEARS about "the blob" long before capital escalations were a major issue.
---
And yes, FAXes have diminishing returns on the number of reps, but they are not extreme enough that they can't be overcome by adding more faxes.  I'm talking about diminishing returns to the point that adding more than one FAX is useless.
---
Then why do they run away BEFORE the escalation? Like, I chase them around in a subcap and they literally run away because I am in a PvP ship instead of a PvE ship. 
---
A "gud fite" for a wormholer or small ganger is dunking a PvE fit Myrmidon. Anything more and they run away.

I was just lonely and wanted your attention bro.  How are things?  Mom still doing that weird thing everyone loves but noone wants to admit?

---
Cripes I'm old
---
Forming 100 dudes to scare someone off is much harder than forming 5 supers/dreads
---
I would add that they provide small gangs the much needed ability to take down a few capital ships. 
---
Considering the cap blob everywhere, this was a needed balance.
---
No fucking shit...  bombers are fine.
---
He meant not on caps.
---
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together.... MASS HYSTERIA!
---
not really. the CSM, which is &gt; half megablocs, warned CCP that it was a bad idea. did CCP listen? fuck no.
---
your blood would contain vast amounts of salt
---
&gt;That´s why there are literally no triglav fleets around (except the odd Drek/Lesh gang, but they are primarily used against caps)
---
Come on dude, you know triglav ships are the meta in the vast majority of wh brawls.
---
That one hit too close to home.
---
it makes droppers work at their kills, lmao.
---
Feel bad you had an outburst and now you're trying to lean into it?
---
And I thought moving everything to Discords was bad enough. Seems like now I'll have to listen to fucking fan-made podcasts to know where the game is going
---
Upvoted for delicious tears.
---
I really enjoyed watching Dirk cry into a bottle of gin last night over cyno changes. 🤤
---
Standard nano Drek goes 3km/s cold (snaked obviously) and deals damage out to 50, which applies fine to any tackle within range (especially with almost 25km web. It gets roughly 50k ehp with a constant 500 ehp/s repairer.
---
There's simply no other subcaps that even come close to competing with this, and the fact that your default drek fit that comes to mind is 2 rep + TC fit further solidifies that you have very little clue.
---
Try undock everything said is bullshit lol
---
The general issue with it is that it's virtually impossible to counter.
---
It takes very little actual coordination to set up and employ, and can entirely counter anything it's put up against, as long as the defenders don't make really basic mistakes.
---
Sigh why couldn't we recruit you before sniggwaffe did... :P

Yeah man they poop when they die, like kittens.

It is true your honor... This man has no dick.

Uh, they are the biggest issue right now dude. At least a blob required some effort. 9/10 times it's instant cyno and caps when something is tackled. We fight people out numbering us all the time, we're used to that. At least we can kill tackle when that happens. When it goes straight to a cap ball that had to save X we have to go home. 
---
And of course we'll complain, but at least it wasted 100 people's time, and leaves some chance for a fight. Sorry dude no more I-Win button for your game.
---
&gt;Rise reads /r/eve every day probably
---
TBF, there are corps that would take your 100 sub caps vs 25 subcaps.  But that isn't remotely close to what has been happening for the last 2-3 years.
---
I'm hoping for holes that can't be rolled I think that would be much fun and chaotic :)
---
I had them drop on my highsec exploration site twice so far. Luckily I was paying enough attention between hacking and scanning to warp off...
---
The hunters want free kills and no risk of losing their ship. They don't give a shit what you want, they just want what they want. 
---
Meanwhile, every and any change that gets implemented makes it exponentially harder for the little guy to make it in eve... and not much change for the big ones. Hell the big ones have people join them from these changes.
---
The Nomen is legit garbage friend.
---
No, delete ALL drones and repurpose drone ships as turret ships
---
Go into incursion systems, bookmark all the incursion sites, wait till they are gone, combat scan them to find left drones...
---
you can also salvage the incursion rats, but to do that you need to make bookmark inside the site, which could lead to your death... or you change to rookieship for bookmarking... then wait till the site despawns and salvage all large wrecks...
---
maybe works with invasion rats, but they are rather dangerously
---
They won't run when they know your subcap isn't fitted with a cyno.
---
THEY don't know you aren't about to drop titans on them.  In fact WE don't know you weren't, except that you say so on reddit so it must be true.
---
I don't know what wormhole groups you're fighting but the ones worth remembering aren't looking for a gank, they want a fight. Doesn't mean they'll ignore a ratter/miner, but we play this game for a fight.
---
Cost and skill restrictions were never balance factors
---
Certainly not in the eyes of the krab who warps a single jackdaw at 0 into 80 bombers, 4 falcons, 2 rapiers and 2 arazus.
---
Please accept these skill points for our ongoing failures **~CCP**
---
You think ganking sub capital ratters in null sec should be among the safest activities one could do? It's more reliably profitable to run sec three missions in high sec. 'Game balance.'
---
Seagull started off great but.... idk where things went sideways
---
They attacked my station a couple times too in high sec.
---
PSA for you, pull local out of the rest of those chat windows.  Have it be by itself as tall as you can make it.  Click "compact member list" to try to see more players in the window.   This will help you keep an eye out for (non-npc) hostiles.  Also add stuff that can kill you to your overview.
---
But these changes cripple solo droppers the most out of all people?
---
Good fight!  
---
I was part of Centi logi wing and flew 2 gilas on alts in addition. From my perspective it felt pretty even to begin with, then got caught up in the the logi tunnel vision and lost both my gilas. By that point however I think the tide had already turned. Logi also failed to notice too late lolrus in the basi being tackled and thus we didn't cap over him and led to cap issues.   
---
There's lots to be learned from this fight, particularly in my own flying and in our FC'ing. Thanks for the fight o/
---
imagine being _this_ entitled
---
I know this can't be true.  No one has seen Elo outside of a Munnin.  (J/K, had fun flying with Elo!)
---
You've been bamboozled
---
Sure, but nobody enjoys mining.
---
I wonder, what could they do to us? maybe scramble WH mass limmits? That'd fuck us up.
---
my mistake, so, it's even easier to not get caught
---
I'm in two minds on this though. I agree with the proposed cyno changes, but if someone wants to cap drop more power to them. As a small gang dude myself, I'm cool if someone does that. I'll usually run away if I don't die.
---

Just another day here, grinding through the npcs that plague this subreddit. They keep respawning too, I'm not sure if that's a bug or intended.
---
thanks for clarifying, makes my point even stronger
---
Deserves an upvote.
---
Limited to zero counterplay is the issue with the supercap umbrella.  Which is actually also part of the issue with the incoming cyno change.
---
He was afk 90mins and mined all of 1mil of ore.... totally worth afk orca mining
---
CCP Rise, muh man!
---
Thank you for verifying the complaint? I can't imagine a home defense fleet being simple to set up, deploy, and coordinate. No matter what size of cat they are herding.
---
&gt; so what activities are they doing in high-sec that's causing this amount of rage?
---
They kill afk miners (as intended).
---
Let's be happy they are doing things, since pretty much the only choices are easy to code things.  Making new things takes a lot more work than small tweaks with big effects (blackout).  We can't expect the latter so let's hope the former leaves us with a more vibrant game.
---
Maybe. Most solo dropper are using multiboxing bombers though
---
I don't agree. I'll take a subcap fight if I have a reasonable idea that they won't escalate to stupidity. If it's obvious bait for a cap drop I'll run. Depends on what their killboard is telling me.
---
Oh look, WoW classic is dropping soon.
---
Hilmar is a wormholer now, of course hes gonna believe their brain damaged bullshit.
---
Actually you are wrong cause the counter is numbers
---
So these Gangs want to go into the Lands were the n+1 meta reigns and cry cause they failed this meta and suddenly those who help their friends are the issue?
---
And just to deal with that CCP is now also handing out another defender buff as they have now a Hard cyno in every system they control for more then a month
---
He's probably just another frat botter
---
Here comes Hillmar! - Thats me!
---
Except it doesn't show that as a sole intention.
---
So, oh no, for a month people might have a tiny bit more difficulty. the horrors.
---
You're clueless lol
---
*Deploys mobile cyno jammer*
---
Is this too hard for you?
---
Okay, where in major fleet fights are noob ship alpha cynos required?
---
How will recons or blops cynos suddenly make those things impossible?
---
Not a more vibrant game. Just more turtle in null
---
Rather win the computer.
---
Yeah I actually picked the year I started playing for the meme, and I’m sure I’d come across as a bittervet to most new players - if there were any new players in lowsec, hah!
---
And perhaps now the new bosses said stop wasting the funds?  Maybe they, who know the real numbers, aren't happy with the cashflow trajectory.  They have a model, the Chinese server, and perhaps they are willing to take a role of the dice to see if they can avoid that as an inevitable end.
---
Wow - just wow!  As a group we are some jaded, sarcastic, whiny bitches.  Having said that, I very very much enjoyed quite a bit of the snark in here!  i may resub my main.
---
Make caps half the price and you sure can nerf their ehp. I mean they already strip defensive capabilities hard and Caps dont stand a chance against organized groups. Somehow i feel there wont bei any point of having a cap outside of fleets anymore.
---
&gt; 3 die in tidi 
---
Then nothing is different as tidi isn't affected by these cynos.
---
Considering you can significantly tank the cynos, position them well and have multiple go up presenting easy alphas, you seem incapable of adapting.
---
How exactly do cynos currently happen that would be differnet?
---
Dave Archer is a moron. News at 11.
---
Have you seen the other talk shows? 
---
I watched Open Comms last night and it was just a bunch of spergy ass mouth breathers trying to scream over top of one another and see who could shit talk the most. Granted, Dirk is hilarious when he's drunk, but that show is full of nothing but cringe most of the time. Brisc is about the most sensible person on there and he often gets drowned out by the other idiots. Not saying I agree with everything Brisc says, but he at least acts like he has some sense. 
---
Push To Talk is a Goon circle jerk with a bunch of old guys and one younger one acting as the pivot man. Basically just shit talking anything not Goons and pushing more Goon propaganda. 
---
The Meta Show is full tilt Goon propaganda. It's a bit more measured and sensible than the other shows, but that's because The Mittani thinks he's fooling people with that pretentious pseudo-intellectual front he tries to put on. 
---
I think Matterall strikes a good balance of asking questions and allowing them room to answer. You're never going to get an interviewee agree to an interview where they know the interviewer is going to come out frothing at the mouth, being overtly hostile, and trying to attack them at every turn.  I listened to the latest interview and there were some challenging questions asked, but they were asked in a calm and collected manner and CCP Rise was given the room to answer the questions without being hounded at his answers. I don't think you could get that impartiality from any of the other shows given the level of malevolence displayed by the other shows towards CCP in general.
---
I don't want an "I win" button, I want changes that make sense and don't stifle content.  I have also said multiple times cap escalations are a problem.  There are other ways to deincentivize dropping caps on small gangs.  Delete Haws, delete support fighters, change the NSA so it's not an instalock button, kill heavy fighter application, especially LR fighters.  Make capitals have niches and require proper subcap support to use properly.
---
I support this
---
lol r u ok
---
most of the people complaining have enough resources and enough of those SPs in some alts that the training won't take that long even without a remap.  And if they have that many alts, but they aren't trained up, i bet they have a couple of billion to scrape together to inject a few that are left.
---
I am a scrub (2 accounts, playing on and off for 4 years) and I have one character already skilled for recons but only cyno 4 (I will probably use some stored of those free SP) and 2 others who have cyno 5 and covops.
---
Horrible DPS pilot pov lmao
---
Can you please stop speaking on behalf of the little guy?

your are wrong for example i enjoy mining and how do you get minerals without miners?

---
This comment will seem funnier in a few weeks when they nerf anom respawn.
---
I used to doubt that that was coming.  Now I think we will be seeing big changes every 2 weeks or so and I have begun to believe they intend to end the umbrella's utility.
---
They're also vulnerable to much more than 5 supers are. Booshing, bombing, kiting, bubbles to split them, ewar, better logi. Being able to use those tools better is the only advantage a small group can possibly have over a big one.
---
Better than a Covetor? Hulk?
---
To clear something up, I am from TEST. So I am one that fights usually on the side of the capitals not vice versa. Thus, my personal interest would lie into keeping the status quo.
---
Now, about the supers. Why should 100 subs not be able to hold off against 10 supers? I mean, I totally agree with you that 100 subs shall not wipe the floor of 10 supers. But at least be able to pick one or two off, by perfectly countering them.
---
Also, I don't speak about 100 munnins that are good at everything currently. I speak about a perfected counter. Defanging supers is already quite possible nowadays, but there is no subcap that can overcome fax reps at this state of the game. Period.
---
And this is a problem. Caps, escpecially supers and carriers counter subcaps pretty well (with the exception of booshing fleets). But as long as the only counter to caps is caps, this game is going into a stagnating direction.
---
BTW: We fought fights with hundreds of subs against a mediocre supercap fleet with fax support. And there was ZERO chance to pick anything off, and we took the best counter there is currently available (bombers).
---
I think most of us have crushed in one way or another throughout or Eve careers... that either pulls people in or pushes them away.
---
Nobody likes losing but it's a learning opportunity, imo.  Get good, is what I told myself :)
---

I hear the best defense against highsec gankers is to put nothing but asteroids on your overview and hide local.

Yeah my dude, there was another 40 nightmares on a titan that didn't jump in to whore on the fort (lol wtf, I would be salty in that position).  Spin that shit, DJ.
---
And literally nothing of value was lost. Bye.
---
Complaining about blobbing is vastly different from pointing out very obvious flaws in the game balance that are the aids that is rotting this game from the inside.  
---
One is an emotional reaction based on a lost fight, but *usually* doesn't make people quit the game. Shit game balance with caps, rorqs and injectors does.
---
Nowadays it's so hard to distinguish between true and faked stupidity...
---
Going off what Hilmar was talking about in regards to caps most of that stuff is probably still coming.

They also literally do not work well at all with the restrictions and no tank.

his voice is too little so the big guy needs to amplify it for him obviously duh
---
&gt;for a month people might have a tiny bit more difficulty.
---
Instead CCP could become a decent company and push the timeline in October so that people could train into bombers or forced recons without impacting external RL money issues. Otherwise, sudden changes that forces say an industrial logistics customer to continue to pay a monthly sub but now have to pay extra dollars to sustain.
---
The idea of "just deal with it" because it has no impact to you because its not your gamestyle is the reason for death of communities -- not considering anyone else's perspective.
---
My statements here isn't against the change, there is no difference in implementation if CCP does this in October vs the planned mid-Sept timeframe with the exception that October is something a company would do with decency and customer service in mind, not pure greed and profit.
---
Most people going to Vegas already have their tickets. 
---
Not sure why they continue to test this new tech. With recent and upcoming changes huge fleet battles will be a thing of the past.
---
Yep. Giving covert cynos to JFs makes logistics basically risk free. Youd have to be a complete muppet to get caught.

looks like you only concidered warping when you hit hull, judging by the half spooled MWD, also have you tried heating your hardners? can help
---
Thanks, you're an awesome guy. Have a nice day!
---
And what, exactly, is bad about rolling holes with hictors?
---
Collateral damage?
---
Everyone has their own opinions as to why it’s bad. At the start of the game CCP didn’t look at Titans ever being produced at such a high rate. Hell even carriers and dread numbers are super high but pretty cheap for some options. The other thing is that people drop supers on small gangs and anything else to have that distinct dps advantage. I personally don’t really have that big of a problem with it. People want to defend their territory and a lot of times dropping supers is the best way to negate an attacking force. People just using the game mechanics and meta to their advantage in my eyes. Coming from someone that doesn’t own supers or is even skilled into them that’s just my opinion based on reading through the weekly threads that’s pop up about this.
---
dscan.. use it - you get intel on them before they tackle you... (or was this advice for nullsec?)
---
Then fix the BALANCE.  Before the citadel cap rebalance, carriers were not the go to ship to fight off a small gang.  Perhaps revaluating the ship's role and values for application etc should be looked at, before making a hamfisted change that kills a huge amount of content.
---
Your echo chamber isn't made of stained glass, it will be fine. 
---
In the mean time, give us some mechanics that get engagements to happen and not allow ships to just warp off if they smell danger. I want fights, not one sided slappings with instant escape options.
---
We literally run open gangs (\~NPSI) every day.
---
So you wrote a lengthy post of how you blobbed someone.
---
I'll even mine from time to time so as to (semi) afk mine (I'm really playing the violin or watching a show but still paying enough attention) and this has never been an issue. Ever.
---
It's too late, bombs will now take 3 full minutes to land and torps will have a range of 3km. Good luck bombers!
---
&gt; Maaaybe some people can't chose when they NEED to AFK.
---
when im out mining, and i need to do something, i tell my ship to dock up and only leave once it hit warp    
---
i dont just piss off for 90 minutes and complain that npc's have gotten my orca to hull
---
Which is still way less than 100 man fleet. A 20 man fleet is fairly fightable for a 5 - 10 man gang, especially when they just have some linemember shitter as the FC.
---
They already got nerfed and they're now pretty damn dangerous to take?
---
put them on your overview, warp the fuck off as soon as they appear on grid    
---
same as in null when you are solo mining and you get a dread or titan spawn, you got 10 seconds to  fuck off or you will die
---
To tank a lot of damage and be a fat drone boat.
---
I did my best to ask the tough questions.
---
takes about 5000 steps for a charmander to hatch, so will still take a bit

[THECL] apollo429Today at 8:14 AM
---
To those that came on the fleet tonight thank you for coming. Sorry we did not jump in but such as life.
---
AAR: some friends in vale of the silent had an offensive timer against some old friends of ours that go by the name of unspoken. The timer was a fortizar owned by no visual which are unspoken allies. Being a saturday night sunday mirning we figured they would have came in force to defend the structure. So we went out and sat in range of the enemy system for them to fully commit but we were scouted and they left the defense to 15 phantasms. Allies on grid we able to handle the fort and kill a few phantasms. We were also scouted and hour after entering system so that did not help.
---
It hasn't really been touched since release, but right now it's a ship for remote armor repairs and/or used for farming wormholes.
---
Found something similar once in a wormhole 5 years ago and couldn't get any qualified pilots to come fly the thing out before the hole collapsed.
---
It’s definitely a problem with how fast caps land and apply to an active combat grid.
---
Giving new players caps faster is not a viable fix.
---
Removing cynos is not realistically a healthy fix either.
---
So what should be done? Something along the lines of cynos having uncertainty to them. So that, for example, when you jump to a cyno you land in system, but not on grid within 5km of the beacon. This would force incoming caps to have to warp, and that means they can potentially be seen on their way, or bubbled. It removes the “I win” instant cyno button and makes you have to plan your warp. It also puts options back into CCPs hands for balancing caps around warp speed again, because currently warp speed is fairly irrelevant for caps.
---
&gt;How exactly do cynos currently happen that would be differnet?
---
So first and foremost, the fact you are asking this question indicates that you don't have experience in fleet fights. So maybe don't comment on how whatever change does or doesn't affect them.
---
But whatever. Suddenly everyone is a fleet fight expert, so I guess you can be too.
---
The difference now is they we use either a ceptors, or a nullified T3C to position an initial cyno that we know is only going to live long enough to get maybe two caps in, then we jump in a hard cyno on a capital ship that will live at least 20 seconds to get the rest of the fleet in.
---
Clearly, this change breaks all of that, and no one has really come up with an adaquate alternative yet.
---
Go read my comment history before you say to cyno in system and warp. I'm sick if typing out why that doesn't work now, and won't work after the patch.
---
&gt;Considering you can significantly tank the cynos,
---
I don't think you understand what "significantly tank" means.  300k or 600k or whatever PYFA warrior ehp isn't shit compared to a fax or dread with an EHE. 600k EHP on a shield extended, BS size signature at 0 velocity is going to die before you get more then a handful of caps through, even with fax reps.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would love to adapt. I don't have a problem nerfing super umbrellas more, I just don't see how this doesn't kill fleet cap fights in its current iteration.
---
Kinda self evident from the fact they're doing it
---
I agree with most everything he said except asset safety.  That SHOULD be off the table.
---
Prefer to call it 'a sense of humor' tbh.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
&gt; Olmecca Gold is right
---
I cannot imagine how much reading this must hurt for some people
---
Noob ship cynos aren't needed. I don't give a fuck if those go away.
---
You can't tank a recon or blops enough to get an entire fleet onto a grid that already has a hostile supercap fleet on it.
---
It’s is completely different than the Strat and Astero, one thing you’ll learn with this game is that consistency is not CCP’s forte
---
Reset your blues if you want fights lol.
---
No shit I'm right.
---
Everybody's over here going "bombers are OP!" and I'm just like "Well, sure, if being the only doctrine where you can actually reliably get kills means they're OP".
---
This is a salty post designed to show that I am affected by the event. I was also include a relevant name drop - mom.
---
I've said this before, but I've had 70 jackdaws dropped on me (solo battleship roaming) and 5 caps dropped on me. I much prefer getting annihilated by the jackdaws.
---
It doesn't, you'll be able to fly any ship in the game anyway; so just make your choice based on how you want your character to look and/or the lore behind each faction.
---
you lot bitching and crying and failing to adapt to an exploit being fixed until they made a super special module just for you snowflakes mostly
---
Toy could tell Rise knew it would twist the knife for certain listeners.
---
Its an amazing ship for wormhole living
---
&gt; It's almost like they had an internal goal of getting me to come back to the game, which would make sense considering the age of my account and their stated retention goals.
---
I think there’s a word for this 🤔
---
Why? As a member of CSM when they invented it, I guarantee you CCP can come up with a better version of it when they're not listening to crabs crying.
---
The fact that basically all of r/eve stood up for you when CCP considered them collateral damage, and now that fleet fights are about to be collateral damage y'all are telling us to get fucked.
---
Give all caps damage bonus versus structures, there you go.
---
You are on the eve reddit where everyone bitches and complains. Dont take anything these people say about the game dying seriously. It's a meme
---
At this point
---
Supercapitals are strategic assetts. They aren't supposed to be let's drop 32 supers on a roaming gang item. Perhaps CCP will finally address this and make those weapon systems not apply damage to subcapital targets.  Force the scrubs to git gud. But tbh I just hope all of these dudes quit.
---

---
You're not just wrong, you're stupid. There are tons of people who enjoy mining. If people didn't mine where would you get materials to build ships exactly? Do you think they just magically appear in Jita without someone having to build them?
---
Give me a break, I was on the CSM. Were you?
---
This is a question best suited to our [No stupid questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cqpk28/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/)
---
I agree it should have come off just caps. Perhaps off of rookie and T1s frigates too, but not to the extent they have
---
You know what would be great? Making excavators behave like fighters. You have to be present for them to work. Also nerf the PANIC button. 
---
Make all drones like fighters. People have to be more active to play then.
---

---
Um didn't you hear, there are retired porn stars living homelessly in the tunnels under the city?
---
Its just my suggestion, I mean I am writing this on the very same sub Im telling you not to trust. 
---
And if you need help dont hesitate to mail me ingame.
---
I do think the combination of faxes, citadels, and cynos as they currently work made caps the best fast response fleet, and I agree it should be rebalanced, and THEN in combination with that I could get behind buffing caps in favor of cap vs cap large scale fights.
---
What would need to happen first it make caps a much slower and much more tactical response option. Cynos don’t need to be more expensive, they need to slow down how soon incoming cap fleets can get to a combat grid. Right now it’s instantaneous. What I THINK would be a step in the right direction would be requiring an incoming cap fleet to warp onto a combat grid. I don’t mean they have to gate, but I feel like they should have to form up in local system and then warp to the contested grid. My idea in practice would be something along the lines of cynos continue to exist as they are now, but when you jump to a cyno it either outputs you at a grid near local star, or near to the cyno grid similar to where an emergency warp grid might put you relative to the cyno ship. I would see potentially giving the incoming ships a gate cloak so that they can orient and form up on comms before aligning, to better avoid instantly being probed and bubbled.
---
did they say what the more important ones were?
---
26 dps from 4k dps... thinking face
---
He’s a drone lands renter..he thinks he’s the little guy
---
How much interactivity do you want? A Hulk or Covetor loses a lot of mining time to their small ore hold--you have to warp back to your base to drop off your ore if you're truly solo. If you have a perfect Hulk *and a hauler*, then the Hulk is probably better than the Orca.
---
This I can all get behind. Sorry but you're comment that wormholes/small gangers (both of which I am) only want free kills takes away from real discussion because that is a blanket statement that is simply untrue.
---
&gt;That information there is not realy going to help much in preparing.
---
&gt;Does not tell me how powerful they are or how dangerous or that they attack indescriminately.
---
EVE has always been a game where the devs tell you that "something is about to happen somewhere sometime in the near future" and players have to figure out what that is, how to fight it and how to ultimately solve the problem. They don't just hand out all the details to you.
---
Iirc he's with evictus.
---
I think it's designed to hold a Zephyr, but a shuttle will also fit.
---
Sorry I only know how to read text summaries, gonna have to ask OP for that one
---
I can fly both, but let me summarize this for you: being a bitch to the corporations is the new hipster 'cool'
---
Which is way to easy to kill and you can simply light the cyno before it actives.
---
nope. deffo not. but seriously, wtf was ccp thinking? if they took the time to think through changes long term, they wouldn't have this problem! they would ahve seen "hey, if we give the rorq THIS MUCH mining ability, and combined with injectors, gee, the players MIGHT JUST use them to make a shitload of caps." it's not that hard to see.
---
What there others replying here have said: it can be tough to tell if your solo Hyperion is bait or just wants a fight. A huge majority of the time, we are talking 95-99% it’s bait. So most people just warp off. 
---
This is why cynos NEED to be changed so that it takes longer for caps to arrive at the cyno. I do think every ship should still be able to fit one, but the cap response onto a grid is way too fast.
---
&gt; This comment will seem funnier in a few weeks when they nerf anom respawn.

k. we'll just use crop rotation. i mean, mittens has already got a gameplan for that.
---
nah, ccp is the clueless people here.
---
that easy enough to fix
---
What's a good ship for solo trig invasions? Just coming back after a very long extended break and am interested in running those.

Why would you ever buy plex on contract lmao
---
I’ve been unsubscribed for awhile. When I left rusty insta-lock svipuls were the gate camp meta. I’ve seen a group using confessors now. Are they super scrubs, did the insta lock get nerfed, or other?
---
The same I can say about the response fleet or the crab that gets tackled
---
The crabs just want to crab with no risk of losing their ship. They don't give a shit what you , they just want what they want.
---
There are allways 2 sides of a coin.
---
Or they can just nerf their ehp without making them cheaper.  That would be a better idea.  Though I argue that regular caps are fine, supercaps are the ones that need the nerf.
---
you're a goon. people know by now everyone in delve will just squirt 100 titans and supers on you.Even if *you* in particular are part of the 1% without a cyno it's just not worth the effort.
---
you've been denying fights for years and now you cry about people not fighting you, irony at it's best.
---
There was no confusion.
---
So there is a counter to your counter-play?
---
Ugh, no, most of the people on INN are not bright.
---
did they say what the more important metrics were?
---
Dotlan has this capability, sort of. Look at a region and switch the view drop-down menu in the top right to "Vulnerable". That'll show you what is currently vulnerable, as well as the window for each system in the region.
---
It's not a matter of coordination. It's matter of numbers. Because how it works, defenders are almost always going to have numerical advantage. And all nerfs that CCP introduces are directed into shortening possible response window and thus neutralizing numerical advantage.
---
You would be surprised how hard is coordinating home defense when there are multiple enemy fleets in the your region at the same time. Or coordinating response again well led stuka/goku fleet. I admire FCs that can pull it and don't lose anything, even though they often have to protect people from consequences of their own mistakes.
---
Push to talk is hot garbage for sure.
---
"INSANE"
---
Hey man I’m also in TEST but I think I may have a slightly different view from you.
---
For me it doesn’t really make too much sense for low isk ships to be able to wipe groups of high isk ships out or even be able to fight them effectively. 
---
A 200 man bomber fleet at 60m per bomber rallies around 12b of isk on field. It makes perfect sense for this fleet to wipe a 2b carrier out or even 3-4 2b carriers out. Bombers during blackout routinely put 200-300m on field (4-6 bombers) and wipe out 500m (an excav) with extremely little risk to themselves already. A single bomber can take out a 250m dominix quite handily as well under blackout. 
---
It would make less sense for a 12b investment to pose a threat to a 20b investment (a super) especially if that super has another 70 (more supers and a few faxes). I think it’s perfectly fair that a coordinated 100b response to a coordinated 12b threat will be able to repel the threat, especially because it’s not like all 200 bombers will die. One group risks max 6b if they lose and the other group risks minimum 20b if a super dies.
---
The csm is half megablocs because of how the system works but not because they are the majority of votes so they do not represent the player base very well.  As well, even if they did CCP chains them down so much with NDA and tends to not listen to them most of the time.  The csm has become basically worthless as time went on.
---
Not all caps, just super caps really.  but yes nerf them both.
---
Thing is, supers in most cases aren't even the most optimal solution. But you know, since everybody loves to use their big dick toys, it's how it is. In short, this is nothing, but vulgar display of power.
---
Sometimes it really do be like that :(
---
it was already talked about how were ccp on the show (for ptt and meta), how it would be handles a little more tamely than usual. i wouldn't expect them on the open comms show tho.
---
&gt; So when people ask to be saved, those  big ships come to help. This seems to be the complaint. Bringing a  cannon to a knife fight.  
---
&gt;So would  the root cause of the issue be that it's not optimal, and more  rewarding, to use subcaps for ratting/mining? Wouldn't the solution be  to incentivize subcap use rather than disrupt warfare?
---
The issue is actually one of conflicting playstyles.     Home Defense Fleets tend to reply with overwhelming force because 1) who doesn't enjoy a good roflstomp? and 2) the whole point is NOT to offer good fights.    Nullsec denizens, by and large, don't want people roaming through their space.   They want their space known as a place in which you get stomped.
---
It's the same coin.
---
When a bomber gang find like a Myrm or Domi, do they think "that's a ratting fit ship, 1 bomber is more than enough to get the kill, we'll only send 1 in", no they all go to get on the kill.
---
Then ratters get dropped do they think "guys it's 50 bombers, just bring in 1 FAX and a carrier, that's a fair fight." Not they bring like like half dozen faxes plus supers to make sure the target they are saving lives.
---
/u/CCP_Rise i hope that you actually will read this

---------------------------------                        
---
Nullsec is big if i live in nullsec is just to **have big fights** sorry i am getting old and RL is first. 
---
* 95% **i will not** join a fleet that is just roaming around some space looking for a fight or not. It requires my constant attention, something i can no longer give to EVE at this point in my life.         
---
* 50% time **i will join** a fleet that is doing some big objective as there will be for sure fight and if enemy bail out i will logout knowing that i actually managed to make some difference just by showing up.               
---
* 95% of time i will join for a huge battle during a war that have **significant impact** on the war of how new eden look like.          
---
Because this is timer based and i know earlier i will be able to setup my RL in a way to attend it.         
---
Fuck i know it will be a whole day slug fest - i will need to talk to my wife and explain her WHY i am spending so much time at my PC and why i cannot go away even for 10minutes.                      
---
**I don't know why someone can think that capitals have to much EHP**         
---
**Capital ship melt when fighting each other** they literally melt, **we had issue with faxes** but it was addressed and there was nerf applied.         
---
Reps are stacking but we didn't have huge battle that could prove if this nerf was to small.       
---
From what i currently noticed it looks good enough.             
---
I seen 200 bombers killing tanked super below 5 minutes and i seen 50 bombers killing a super in 2 minutes .... if you reduce the EHP sure stuff will die get more ... no it will not as people will simply not use it.            
---
You cannot punish people for fitting tank.               
---
Like just compare PVE fit super and PVP fit one.           
---
Now put a PVE super on PVP battle field and ... it live shorter than a dread that know how to use emergency damage control ^(without titans on field)                      
---
You want era of chaos?        
---
**Fine** but make player actions and decisions matter.             
---
I know that you want less ratting - and if you want you can check my alts - I don't rat or mine.           
---
Don't kill PVP aspect due to PVE.           
---
Funny thing - quite often i just sit semi afk on comms waiting to save someone - mostly because those 5 roaming gang **will become so salty that bunch of people like me took a kill from them**        
---
I don't know it you consider this good or bad for a game - but there is plenty of people playing the game this way - at is one of the few aspects that people having RL can do.         
---
You don't roam for 2 hours and kill miners and defenceless ratters, but you wait for a call for help and get directly into a fight within 5minutes.                 
---
Honestly if a 100 old guys cannot deny a kill-mail to a 5man gang ... then something is wrong.           
---
Cyno changes are bad - don't want cheap ships used as a cyno i am 100% fine with that - but adding a T2 material ^(not price) tag over them is just bad.           
---
Make all command ships able to use them ^(can i bring a drake) or bigger stuff like battleships.                 
---
Something else, i am ganker ^(something you can also check) i look for big targets and while this is no metric for you - but since blackout started - my target ceased to move.           
---
To the point i stopped looking for them like a week ago.      
---
Even if this was semi afk scanning for 3-4hours sometimes - the movement of big value stuff stopped with blackout.                
---
If this was your goal - well you did it.
---
Yeah, it isn't fair that me and my 7 buddies in bombers or nano-HACs can't roam into the core of an enemies space without facing a coordinated and organized defense.  /s
---
To be fair, if it wasn't the supercap umbrella, people would bitch about cap response fleets, and if not that... it would be jump bridges or titan bridges or whatever defense fleet was dropped because HOW DARE people defend their space against those who come to disrupt activity.
---
EvE was touted as the one MMO that was NOT about peacefully grinding PVE for EPIC LOOTS,  but the big blue umbrella eliminated that threat and turned it into WoW in space years ago.
---
Hey Im not omnipotent, I cant say that you are wrong or that Im right. I can only say that based on the information at hand I dont think it will work. But I do understand why one would think it but its based on scale. Blocs dont care about drops, dont think they ever will. Individual members might, small corps or alliances might but not on that scale. They care about letting the machine work cause thats what keeps the lights on.
---
Because it makes it not awful when life comes calling and you gotta afk abit.  It makes it a game you can still be somewhat casual about.  I like asset safety even if I end up having to pay a tax on things (good isk sink and it does still hurt me.)  I think the current version of it IS the better version of it.  Maybe just raise the tax on it.  Anything they do it will just make it worse.  You say crabs crying but you really should change that to people playing a video game with a legitimate concern...
---
theyve got a tunnel, they arent homeless
---
Well obviously since he/she/it/xer ran the thing into the dirt.
---
LOL if 100 dudes need to instantly bail from a cap ball without getting some kills then you should not roam in null-sec. Your FC obviously is not up for it (yet). Try low-sec.
---
Ignore all the downvotes. Keep getting out there and have fun!
---
The actual problem is a small minority being obnoxiously loud about not being able to 360 no scope hyper dunk a rating Nyx with a 10 man nano fleet
---
You must have read this wrong as I never said we're 100 people running from a cap ball. My gang size is rarely above 8 lol.
---
Like what situations are they not the most optimal solution? HAW dreads and supers are almost always the best thing to drop due to the weaponised boredom doctrine
---
Trying to get a fleet formed and onto a titan whilst your friendly ratting super or rorq is dying is not the optimal solution
---
Ah but no Hauler go with Orca?
---
fair nuff. in my opinion no timer in eve should last more than 24 hours, but thats just what i think.
---
Well PCU is probably one of the most useless numbers for a business, it's only important to players because that's all we get. Stats on player retention, profits, ect. (All the fun stats we don't have) are much more valuable.
---
Yeah back when they weren’t able to dock, as original CCP intended, it’s fucking retarded how easy it is to get into a super nowadays, you can even have you main in it due to keepstars
---
Are you new? you sound new because its been this way for years and years.
---
lol, this is fantastic
---
Holy shit, this comment was prophetic.
---
Clone vat bay doesn't spawn you on grid, so literally one bubble and your whole plan fails.
---
Capitals are not vulnerable to any of the things that supcaps are *and* are very good at doing everything that subcaps can do. They can't be booshed or bombed, they're practically immune to all forms of ewar, they don't need to maneuver so you can't "out-fly" them, they have massive amounts of passive EHP to the point where they don't even need to manage capacitor to keep a tank running. All of these things are problems that subcaps have to deal with, so they're problems that other players can take advantage of if they know how. 
---
Experience might be the only real advantage that a small group can have over a bigger one. 20 or 30 guys who spend a lot of time PVPing together are going to be more way more effective together than 100 guys who don't. But once caps are involved that doesn't mean anything because there's so little room for any kind of counter play. Even if you bring your own capitals it's always going to come down to who has more on field, because that's the only variable that caps aren't immune to. In other words, the one advantage that big guys will always have over little guys is the only one that matters right now.
---
just get into forex and then you can just buy it in whatever currency you want
---
Yes, counterplay also needs counterplay. If someone throws rock, you can throw paper, not be locked into scissors.
---
Golf clap
---
&gt; but it's never going to happen.  You'd have to give me millions of free SP just for snubbing me 
---
Wait until next quarter.   That'll happen.
---
That does not address the issue. If that worked, we would not see the problems we see, and CCP would not even consider stepping in.
---
Fleet formations when? We can at least look like a proper space game
---
Stukas can fight the umbrella, they can kite around the fighters using boosh and put enough deeps on a normal carrier or dead to kill it. Its a race to see what dies first, enough CMDs or the cap the bounced/gets caught in a bubble. Obviously theres alot to these fights and im skipping over alot of finer details and exceptions but these are fun and very dangerous fights.  The supers are a problem because they have alot of EHP and it takes a long time to chew through them. It can be done but often its better to just go for the kills you can, also there comes a point where the incoming dps is way too much and the CMDs just get melted.  When you get a silly number of supers and titans and very few carriers/dreads/subcaps there is not much you can do. Defang a few t2 fighters to spite the supers and then go look for other targets.
---
I didn't say delete it, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved or changed.
---
Seagull added caps to the game?
---
There is no end game, but there is "end game content".
---
It is. It works like this.
---
\- You have people who have big toys they dont get to use much (supers / titans / etc). 
---
\- They put them in a standing fleet.
---
\- Anytime someone in a large PvE ship gets tackled within jump range of your super staging, PvE ship lights a cyno and the standing fleet undocks and jumps to them.
---
\- Given how hard FAX rep, how much EHP capitals and super capital have, and how hard HAW guns / fighters hit; the roaming gang cant break anything and the response fleet holds the field with very little effort.
---
On the difficulty scale its is chill on comms, see ping, log in, get in standing fleet, undock super, right click jump.
---
I don't think CCP anticipated how popular injectors would be. Like they probably expected them to be common but not like non stop heroin junkie addictive.
---
When they shoot you you get out its still red on your kb
---
Sure, that's why you(wh'ers and small gangers) roam null sec killing ships fitted for pve. Because you want a fight.
---
INB4: waiting for escalations
---
They take time to anchor. Cynos take one click to light.
---
As much as I really want the Nestor to have covert ops cloak, I mean I really fucking want it.  I think it would totally fuck up wormhole life.
---
Neither of you actually answered my question, but no I don’t actually think this cyno change is quite in the right direction either.
---
You’d think so haha
---
&gt;there wont be any point of having a cap outside of fleets anymore 
---
Uhm, isn't that the point? To make it so you actually need subcap support to effectively operate caps?
---
That's not balance. That's powercreep.
---
The reason they reliably get kills is because they don't really have any counters when FC'd properly, especially after the cyno changes.
---
&gt; The Triglavian ships 'punch' well up.
---
They punch horizontally and down just fine as well. They have lots of dps AND lots of tracking.
---
Wrong about what?
---
Yeah man, just warp right out of those bubbles...
---
Needing to have a specific alt for a super is piss poor gameplay design.
---
You can very easily find videos in which Goku/Stuka fleet does "The Lance Dance" to avoid being dd'd off field. Harpies and Kikis kill fighters rather fast, and unless the defender is going to feed fighters, it's not that viable. HAW dreads however are still very much good at what they are doing, provided that have enough support.
---
For repelling Bomber fleet Jackdaws/Harpies should be enough. But you are right in one thing. Forming them is much much harder than just jumping caps. It takes more time, and in such situations time is crucial.
---
Rorqs have PANIC that allows them to buy some time, and each Super pilot should have a fax on standby whenever he's undocked.
---
Ok thats easy then haha thank you
---
Hey that is me
---
probably true, which goes to show that ccp vastly misunderstands the playerbase.
---
I thought that was the legion and tengu?
---
So we go a month with less people hot dropping caps, what's the problem? It'll give groups time to adapt.
---
And you find it surprising that if you and your 8 friends walk into the home of 10k players that you get a response that overwhelms your gangs capabilities?  Speaking of biting off more than you can chew comes to mind here. Even without caps being dropped on you you will have to run without getting a -good fight-.    
---
My alliance regularly tackles stuff that lights cynos, and many times we even shoot our cyno inhibitor that was dropped by some overzealous member just to get an escalation which is the fun part of the whole adventure. Orbiting a lone rorqual or ratting super, waiting for it to blow up is not exciting at all.      
---
I think you just look in the wrong places for the wrong kind of fights.
---
i mean, it's just because the megacblocs actually have enough organization to form a coherent vote. hisec, and to a lesser extent, lowsec and wormholes are too fractional.
---
&gt;Getting blobbed can be avoided by playing better. Shit game balance can't.
---
Not entirely true. There are balance issues involved.
---
Nullsec is now that place you cant enter unless you have 3 accounts
---
..
---
The problem with everything you said was at the end. Your 100 bil response (that’s a bit on the low side to be honest) fleet should not be able to respond to a combat grid faster than any other ship type. That’s why people get annoyed when they are dropped on, because it’s instantaneous and there’s really no way to know if those caps are on their way or not. Short of killing the cyno there’s no realistic way to stop them.
---
Incentivizing subcap usage isn't going to work, there's no reason to use some less tanky that does less damage. Especially with some of these sites which are extremely difficult to do without using caps, unless they bling a battleship to the point that it's more expensive than the original cap (which people do).
---
And simplifying the coordination to "me press jump and rep" is ignoring all the other conditions required to make these standing fleets work. Getting caps on standby in standing fleet, SRP so they're willing to actually drop without fear of losing their ship, and coordinating jump timers aren't the most complicated things but by no means easy.
---
And there is counterplay, it's called setting up a bubble and mobile cyno trap. People expect to jump on someone and get free kills within a jump or two of their staging and get kills because they're too lazy to actually set up and be patient.
---
It seems null is mostly stagnant. Arguably cynos prevent fights because if you dont have n+1 there is no point.
---
&gt; repair bill
---
???? do not know this "repair bill" you speak of.
---
&gt; Injectors have caused some of the most massive problems in eve. They won't be changed because they are a cash cow.
---
I completely disagree. They merely expose existing issues faster.
---
If people flying supers is a problem, the solution isn't to gatekeep with SP. The solution is to balance supers.
---
I feel as though there was perhaps a critical mistake in understanding your fleet's win condition here. 
---
Yourself as well as your fleet are unable to land damage due to tracking issues. I can propose two strategies for resolving this issue.
---
1) Better anchoring. Simply put, the munnins were far too close, traveling far too quickly to track these gilas. In fact I would go as far as to say that webbing primaries exacerbated this issue since during moments where direction of the two fleets is the same, the angular velocity is increased as the gilas move slower. Maneuvers to keep constant transversal would have helped, and there are patterns and such to follow to accomplish this.
---
2) Ordering your munnins to anchor prop off. When considering the number of members in each fleet, and realizing that the time-to-till is much higher than larger scale fleet fights (this is goes without saying), and that your munnins have an ADC advantage over the gilas, who while still have high alpha with a drone cloud, shouldn't be high enough to pop munnins through ADCs.  
---
Having your fleet coast prop off achieves two things. Firstly, their webs become useless. Webs work against mwd hacs because it increases the sig/speed ratio (or decrease speed/sig whichever you prefer). This ultimately increases the application of the fleet by essentially denying the signature bonus of mwd hacs. ( I say essentially because you can equate the same sig/speed ratio of either a ship that is faster with higher sig, or slower with lower sig).
---
There is virtually no discrepancy in application between base speed munnin, and base speed munnin under webs. That is to say gilas apply the same with or without their webs when munnins are coasting prop off.
---
What is the key here to understand is what you as a fleet achieve by making this decision. As munnins you have incredible alpha damage and it is imperative that you track to apply as much of that as possible. Having your fleet coast prop off would mean that the munnins track gilas 100% of the time perfectly and apply 100% of their damage. The gilas are stuck with applying their constant drone cloud damage, which you as a fleet easily manage through ADC and your logi numbers, while you alpha gilas or logi.
---
Also please don't shoot phased plasma into basis; that hurt my soul to watch; fusion next time&lt;3
---
I lived like this for awhile, you are correct you need a faction prop mod and no cloak. It's more about getting off the gate asap. But IMO it is worth it if that is your mothership for your pirate operations.
---
Jesus Christ stop fucking nerfing things for fucks sake.  Ok?
---
Which is scary if they go down the route of wow in making playtime the most important indicator over active subs.
---
You know, simple, other than having competent carrier, supercarrier, armor fax, shield fax and titan pilots in standing fleet 23/7.  Simple /s.
---
Why? Damage cap is already being met with subs
---
Just remove torpedos from bombers entirely.
---
Leave it as a bomber.
---
Maybe give it light missile slots or something for defense.
---
And you know the poster was obviously referencing large fleeta, not small gang wh brawls that don't rely on alpha.
---
5 minuets 25 seconds left on the room, 5 mins of siege cycle and 10km to the exit, sweating intensifies.
---
I hate people that say this. If cost restrictions aren't balance factors, then why isn't every single fleet titans only? Why does nobody fly faction dreads when they are better then regular dreads? Why isn't everyone in a molok?
---
What happened?
---
The counter should be time honestly. I agree, it would be silly for a 10 man sub gang to take on your 4 titans, 8 supers, 5 fax, and 15 carrier response fleet. 
---
What I think should happen is that they cannot jump to a cyno grid instantly. Instead, jumping to a cyno drops them somewhere in system and they have to warp to the combat grid. Now it is no longer worth your time to drop the obscene cap response fleet. Instead you might only bother with a couple faster warp carriers and some subcap support. 
---
This would also change attitudes around killmails farming a bit. Now you can’t just sit around afk watching Netflix while your rorqs mine and you do cyno overwatch in your super, because now your super has to warp once before landing on a grid. Warping to grid carries with it all kinds of counterplay, balance options, and risks.
---
This is all accurate.
---
The music is the best part of the video!  I should tell you that the creator of that video spent 4 months finding the perfect music.  The music should promote EVE to greatness!  
---
Re-watch it again and again!
---
It will be the greatest thing you have ever seen in your life on this Earth!
---
Only according to you.
---
The small gang isn't running away from you, they are disengaging before the 1dq spodbrain burns his cyno to drop his ratting super on 2 cruisers.
---
This has happened to me personally when me and a friend were having a fun insurance suicide brawl vs local goons before said 1dq spodbrain dropped a titan and 2 supers, fuck the guys we were having the fun brawl with might have been you.
---
Everyone talks about crop rotation. Anom respawning wouldn't work that way.  People talk about resources like they would take weeks/months to replenish but have lots until then. What if there was just less per system? A region, no matter how long it is fallow being unable to support goons except if farming less per system, but regulalry.
---
&gt;I don't want an "I win" button, I want changes that make sense and don't stifle content.
---
Cynos stifle content.
---
&gt;Make capitals have niches and require proper subcap support to use properly.
---
Doesnt matter. As long as they have any advantage over subcaps, they will be preferred. The only issue is price, but there is so much isk in null it may not matter.
---
Yes, in our fleet of around 30 only ONE dude could pilot the Orca.  He jumped out of his Rupture and boarded the Orca and the gate guns opened fire on his empty Rupture because he (like everyone else) had shot the Orca which was neutral!  ROFL!  Our pro logi saved the Rupture too. &lt;3
---
They are not wrong in this case.
---
/me slurps.
---
now that's a good shitpost!

when the sigs team up they do.
---
&gt; INB4: waiting for escalations
---
You answered your own question. Like I said, we love to fight, it's the shit that makes cool videos and memorable moments in the game for us. But hey, keep whining and saying that all wormholes and small gangers are exclusively ratter gankers.
---
No, I think ransoming freighters with roving gangs should be viable and more profitable than killing them. Currently ganking ratters is more profitable than true piracy, as well as true piracy in eve being effectively dead. I think small frigate gangs should be able to tackle haulers with no escort, and demand a ransom. I think that the hauler should have incentive to pay said ransom because losing the cargo is much more expensive than losing the ship. Alternatively there should be some type of "boarding" mechanic where a tackled ship can have a certain percent of it's inventory stolen, which gives rise to the use of pirates using blockade runners to stash loot, and creates jobs in the form of mercenary escorts to ward off such attacks. 
---
But currently jump freighters can just teleport from their doorstep to the space Wal-Mart and back using nothing but a throwaway rookie ship. It's stupid. The game has pirate NPC's yet somehow PvP piracy is completely missing from the game.
---
Why would I play a space game with no space pirates? It's like watching Looney Tunes with no Bugs Bunny. Sure it's a cartoon, but WTF is the point?
---
Good content, vpuoted
---
Yeah that is why I said they would scoop it nothing is destroyed
---
in 2019 eve no less
---
Uh, ok? Where did I say we go to the home of 10k players? I didn't. I am comparing the meta of this game of ~2015 to now, and it's drastically different. There is no tier of escalation anymore. It's just instant capitals most of the time.
---
Regardless of one's opinions on these changes, it's hard not to respect the quality of the post!

I blew up a XL SMA in WH space post-citadel changes, and a assload of subcaps dropped. I panic'd and called out on comms to ask for people to come help extract through the chain back to our home. I walked out with a couple bil in ships and was content to let everybody keep everything they were able to evac themselves. It felt memorable because loot pinatas like that are basically impossible to find now, plus a bunch of corp mates got some free ships.
---
i'm just pokin some fun, I mean who doesn't love professor chaos!
---
Or we just spread out some more
---
&gt; Good luck countering ~~a Kikimora~~ *literally anything but frigates* with a t1 destroyer
---
FTFY.
---
amen brother lol
---
It all depends on standings vs the faction, Bloods attack me on sight and even at gates, i have been most of my time in Delve or deeper there
---
They really have no excuses when it comes to injectors. They basically ignored the 300+ page feedback/complaint thread.
---
The fact that you use 'standard fit' and 'high grade snake pod' in the same sentence tells me you have zero clue.
---
But even then, looking at pyfa the only way your getting those resists and speeds is to use deadspace mwds and armor reps. Driving the price of your 'standard fit' up to over 1B not even considering the pod.
---
Still, the point remains; the jackdaws are something you have to deal with. You have 50km range. Since we are all snaked now, they go 3.1k in propulsion mode with snake pods and a basic T2 fit.
---
Your 52.5 tracking speed is not going to hit the snaked / faction pointing interceptor holding you down while orbiting at around 6,000. To keep your repairs running your munching on cap boosters while only repairing 500 EHP/s. The jackdaws have 161 in prop mode and once they pull range (they hit out to 80), five or more of them eat you for lunch.
---
Is the drek a good ship? Yes. Is it a fun solo boat. Hell yes. Is it without any counter, nope.
---
A more tanky option for cynos???? Marauders
---
Love the tracking, in class on class fights the issue with their DPS is more the spool up time and the range. 
---
Dont get me wrong, they are great ships. But they have their weaknesses.
---
How so? I think I missed that
---
What he actually says is they are prepared to take a hit in terms of subs (which they already are), in the hope that in the long term there will be more activity.
---
They are also about to turn up income from ratting &amp; mining as the nerf bat was too hard especially as super and carrier ratting had already dropped by half.
---
He also says that this hits the smaller guys who are just starting out using caps way more than it hits the big blocs, which is a good thing I guess.
---
Cynos need a spool up time
---
Mysterion.
---
Remove d-scan in wormholes when?
---
Heaven forbid if someone defends their own fucking space you spod brain.
---
So I'm going to try and answer this with as little bias as possible, but I also proudly identify as an F1 monkey, so that disclosure is out of the way.
---
So back in the day, Eve was a lot different. You would just roam around in really fast warping, kitchen sink fleets looking for ratting Ravens in belts.
---
Killing ratting Ravens was pretty fun, but the real fun came when you either bumped into another kitchen sink roaming gang who was also looking for ratting Ravens, or the people who owned the ratting Ravens formed up some dudes and fought you.
---
So that second case, where the dudes forming up to protect their Ravens, it could go a couple of ways.  If you fucked with one of the bigger groups, you got blobbed hard AF and died horribly.  If you kinda knew your targets, you could usually get a pretty decent fight if you are willing to fight outnumbered a little.
---
At some point, shit started to change.  The Ravens more and more became bots, and killing those was a lot harder. 
---
Also, around this time Phoebe came out, and I was living in Stain with a small group that used carriers for logistics, so Phoebe hit us really hard, so I ended up going AFK for a long time.
---
I digress. At some point (while I was gone), ratting moved from belts to anoms, and that changed a lot of shit.
---
First, ratting in carriers was viable.  In belts, you spent most of your time warping, so carriers weren't any better then a Raven or Ishtar (which both warped at the same speed back then).
---
So now that people are ratting in caps, they are (1) making a lot more Isk and (2) when roaming gangs come to kill them, they might live long enough to be saved.
---
Also, the effect of ratting caps is that there is a lot more incentive to get a cap.  It used to be that a carrier was kinda like a Titan is now, where it was something you just ship spinned and hoped to get to use, now it's something you can make Isk with.  Additionally, ratting capitals created the opportunity to use your capitals in save fleets.  Now everyone not only wants capitals, but has the ability to get them.
---
So that's a lot of background without answering your question. Sorry about that.
---
So now, in TYOOL 2019, let's say you want to go out in a small gang and get some fights.  Way back when, you could go gank some belt ratting Ravens.  Now, you are limited to the odd VNI, (or myrm, or w/e) that no one cares enough to save, or even try to fight you for killing, tackling a carrier/supercarrier, or fucking with a rorq.
---
I didn't forget about rorqs, I just think the entire mechanic of rorqs, and tackling rorqs to bait a fight is so incredibly horrible that I just can't even.
---
Whatever.  If you do find a carrier, you have a decent chance of killing if if the dude is dumb, but if you get a response, it's not going to be a bunch of thirsty dudes in subcaps, it's going to be all those dudes buying capitals and supercaps with their carrier and supercarrier ratting income.
---
And that's the problem with umbrellas. They killed off one of the most consistent ways to bait a fight.
---
Also, since people stopped roaming around in small gangs looking for Ravens, because they were just getting supercaps dropped on them, there were fewer small gangs to bump into, so you killed off the second way people used to get fights.  Shit, anymore, when I'm out in a small gang and we bump into another small gang, we try to work together instead of fighting each other.
---
Whatever. There's your answer. Super umbrellas killed small gang roaming.
---
Having said all that, I feel like there are other and better solutions then the cyno nerf.  The cyno nerf feels like we are trying to roll back to 2008 instead of trying to grow into new metas.
---
This is where I drop the attempt to not be biased. This is all my opinion here.
---
First, I think it would be be cool to increase capital jump range.  Say what you want and the PL boogieman pre Phobe, and how oppressive they were, but they made people be careful about just YOLOing around their caps.  If every system in Eve was no more then one mid-point from an NPC station, with most systems being in direct jump range, yeah. You could dreadbomb anyone at anytime, and instead of trying to bait out kitchen sink fights, you could try to bait out cap fights.  You would have to fix cyno jammers for that to work, but jammers need fixed anyway.
---
Also, if you use the increased jump range to oppress someone's capital usage, now you can go get subcaps fights.  Instead of nerfing capitals, CCP would be giving us the tools to take care of the problem ourselves.
---
"But I don't want to fly caps!!!".  Ok. I hear you.  I don't know how, but I really think CCP need to fix NPC space.  I grew up in Syndicate, and it was amazing. It was the wild wild west. Small gangs came through every night looking for fights, and usually, they got them.  NPC 0.0 should be pirate infested wasteland where even the big nullblocks are scared to go because people who do nothing but small gang PVP live there and kill everyone.  I don't know how to do that though.
---
I get that with the longer jump ranges I asked for, you now have a better chance of getting caps dropped on your small gang in NPC space, but if people are willing to expose themselves to the risk of having their caps in the open, I feel like that is something that could be used to get a fun fight out of also.
---
The thing is, the game has changed. It's bigger, there are more caps and supercaps.  They are not going to go away without taking a lot of players with them, and they shouldn't anymore then caps should push subcaps out.  We can't just roll the server back.
---
CCP needs to figure out how capitals and subcaps   can coexist, but part of that might be players embracing the currently existing counter to capitals, which is of course, capitals.  If there is some reason players don't want to fly capitals, maybe CCP should look into making them more fun and engaging instead of trying to nerf them into irrelevance.
---
I'm not going to TL;DR this shit. No one is gonna read it anyway.
---
this is truth
---
Yes, you can. Standard ceptor (with scram and point) works. The only thing is venture might warp away, but same he can warp sitting in any ship.
---
I don't see how venture is not worse than any shit fit t1 frigate
---
r/mildlyconcerning
---
☹️
---
Attacking something on a bridge meant having to sacrifice at least one ship to POS jams and guns. That meant that nobody bothered dropping on T1 haulers and like VNIs on a bridge.
---
Nowadays the citadels don't defend bridge takers against gankers so it's much likelier that someone taking the bridge will get ganked.
---
Name me a gaming company that is this transparent and communicative with their base.
---
Of course, but it is a start.
---
It isn't perfect, never said it was.
---
Suicide titans are a thing. If people are willing to throw away titans for a cap fight, they'll be fine with whelping a few recons or blops to get their fleets in.
---
A small corp that was based in amarr lowsec Tainted Dragons. Were the best times back in 2012 - 2014 ish. No drama no bullshit just pure killing of everything and everyone
---
LOL! You got my upvote for creativity!
---
My man, I fking hate all those timers. I can perhaps get behind 2 timers for forts and upwards in which one is perhaps 1 week. You know just to ensure that people can actually be there. But most other timers really need to get lost. Literally the most boring aspect of Eve.
---
That would most def atleast ease the reason why not to fight cause right now theres more hindering fights than allowing them. You have to grind SOV for weeks if not months and then the winners gets the prize of killing one million citadels with one million more timers. And for no real reward or reason. Its a joke.
---
Its expensive as fuck, but if they're paying my travel and hotel Id be down to go again.
---
Really nice hearing Kendarr's voice again. I miss the curse days
---
EVE: The Season of PCU slope more like
---
I'm so excited
---
and I just can't hide it
---
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
---
Nothing you said is true, keep yourself safe
---
It will affect wh logistic to some extend. Moving caps to and from kspace will be a pain.
---
I'm tempted to buy Galaxy Pack (100$) but not sure if I should wait. When do you think next sale will happen?
---
It was my favorite ship as a noob for the look. But now I just fly storks for fleets.
---
Dealing with stuka fleets with a response fleet is rather different then just jumping a bunch of capitals and super capitals to whomever lights a cyno.
---
This is what waking up after a night of drinking looks like. That's just my first cup of coffee right there
---
You mean 20 people in ships incapable of direct combat can reliably kill a single ship? I am shocked I tell you, shocked!
---
Lol caps are cheap as fuck now. A carrier is cheaper than 5 proper fit kikis or 2-3 t3cs. wtf are you even talking about? Bombers dont cost much, but you need a lot of them to take down caps, which balances it out.
---
Yes, their 4 harpy form ups really spooked us YIKES
---
You're not interested in balance.
---
holy fuck lmao
---
&gt; If people didn't mine where would you get materials to build ships exactly?
---
You can refine loot.
---
In fact, this is how a LOT of the initial Titans were made in the Drone Regions when tracking titans were a common ratting ship. A ratting titan could rat up a new titan worth of minerals in a matter of hours. Far far less than the time it takes a Rorqual to mine up another rorqual pilot.
---
That’s the point. Super vs subcap where the numbers are even close to even is easy mode for the supers in an umbrella situation.
---
You don’t have to be competent. Your ehp and rep power mean the roaming gang has very little chance of harming you.
---
Managing logistics is not a difficult problem. If you have some competent people coordinating it, the rest is a need for manpower
---
&gt;Jove [...] are widely regarded as the most enigmatic of New Eden’s peoples.
---
Talocans: Am I a joke to you?
---
&gt; You can't tank a recon or blops enough to get an entire fleet onto a grid
---
Why? It will take less time than the lock time of a super to get the fleet in, even better if you light multiple cynos at once since coordinating an efficient destruction of multiple cynos at once will basically be impossible before the fleet gets in.
---
Even a hostile supercap fleet can't insta pop a fleet within second of it appearing.
---
Can we stop saying "make excavators light fighters" because literally it changes nothing. Do you know how you engage fighters on a carrier? F1. Walk away. Do you know how you do it with regular drones? F. Walk away.   
---
The reason carriers require high APM is because targets die fast so you have to continuously lock / cycle. Imagine if carriers could mine with fighters. They'd be just as braindead rorqs.   
---
Instead say what you mean, like, "make rorqs require active input or target cycling to mine."  
---
Btw, this still doesn't solve the issue. You know what does? Remove panic, remove excavators, give them capital mining lasers. Now you have a ship with a carrier tank that's vulnerable and requires active response rather than panic and drop titans, that also isn't completely shut down by bombers in the blackout meta.
---
In most cities, the lizard people live in the tunnels, in Vegas it's prostitutes.
---
I would agree if not for the recent announced changes.
---
I'm not saying that anyone should be roaming and not facing opposition, but the previous game mechanics made a supercap umbrella fairly limited in terms of real counterplay.
---
A lot of people suggested a lot of good changes to cyno mechanics that could've added counterplay and some general fun back into the game.
---
Instead CCP has gone full nerf mode again, which will just cause the meta to swing wildly another way, which is just not what anyone needs right now.  Because that'll do exactly what you're talking about: people will just bitch about the new defense fleet concepts or whatever stupid thing comes to be as a result of yet another heavy-handed nerf as opposed to actual incremental improvement.
---
Let's get two obvious points out of the way. Firstly, Olmeca is a hypocrite who now has a platform to affect change against types of players he has a personal grudge against. Secondly, the point of a capital ship is to have a big ship with a lot of EHP. HP is not the problem. Look at how many capitals and super capitals are dying and to what they're dying to. The problem is we need things to deploy those big ship against. We need more reasons to smash those big ships against each other and structures instead of subcaps and rats.
---
&gt; no one has really come up with an adaquate alternative yet.
---
Light 5 cynos at once.
---
Done.
---
&gt; before you get more then a handful of caps through
---
If 1 cap gets through, then that has already been enough time for EVERY cap to get through.
---
They don't form a line and go one at a time.
---
Well it's not like the ratters and people that come to defend them want to fight. They have to fight. So yeah mostly ratter and escalationers gankers.
---
Maybe not optimal, but the fastest.
---
It's literally a month.
---
Imagine being this entitled.
---
Sure they could wait, but that's hardly a satisfactory reason to.
---
Nobody that is regularly doing logistics is not going to have access to cynos after this.
---
from other loot.
---
This was, back in the day, the best way to get minerals. The Drone Regions were full of ratting titans "mining" entire titans worth of minerals by ratting.
---
Centi is alive?
---
Yeah. It doesn't work like that.
---
Seriously. Spend some time in super fleets before thinking you have any idea how it works.
---
oh really can you get some gas from ratting?
---
&gt;It's literally a month.  
---
&gt;Imagine being this entitled.
---
Imagine it's just a month for the company we are paying to, to advance the timeline forward, because it has zero impact on them to do so. 
---
Now imagine someone who doesn't like anyone's opinion because it doesn't impact him, and attacks them as someone entitled. No, that is the wrong attitude of not being able to understand perspective and to assume yours is the only one. That is entitlement.
---
Bonus caps against structures. Remove asset safety. Now caps have a role and a very lucrative reason to bring them out.
---
You want people to run anomalies  together?
---
Lol
---
&gt;Try and play the fucking game, huh?
---
changes make cap ratting too risky. 
---
Change the way I play to lessen that risk.
---
Get told to "play the fucking game"
---
"Change the way you play! It's not the end of world!"
---
K. I wont fly caps to rat.
---
" Wait, not like that."
---
Solid read. Well put together.
---
Grinding Gear Games but it wasn't easy to think of one.
---
Then why don't we do it like that now?
---
Oh, that's right... Because it doesn't work.
---
How long does that take to online?
---
How long does it take for a responsive target to light their cyno?
---
Last I checked, cyno jammers don't block active cynos, only prevent new ones (which would count as when it cycles).
---
So, like I said, so long as the defenders don't make really basic mistakes, it's very difficult to deal with.
---
The nature of whaling is hunting the low hanging fruit. No amount of skill will overcome the inherent power imbalance of the situation except the target making mistakes.
---
These changes make that effort required to enact that same level of safety a bit higher. Not totally cancel it, but make it much less automatic.
---
Fuck up or shake up?
---
The cyno change is going to fuck up null and low sec life. This is the era of fucking shit up.
---
Svipul got nerfed hard years ago.
---
&gt;  suddenly those who help their friends are the issue?
---
Nope.
---
That's not at all what my point was.
---
It was that the level of effort required to defend is EXCEPTIONALLY low compared to the amount of effort to attack.
---
&gt; And just to deal with that CCP is now also handing out another defender buff as they have now a Hard cyno in every system they control for more then a month
---
What is this? this sounds interesting. Isn't this what ansibus beacons are for?
---
So what I read here....  
---
Some nobody groups trying to claim victory in the smoldering ruins of the north are feuding. One group is obviously vastly superior, so the other group has to come to Reddit to gloat over a single victory in the MOST OVERBLOWN SELF FELLATIO I've read in r/Eve in a long time.   
---
You used a known hard counter to a doctrine and won. Do you truly believe yourself ultimately superior, or are you just so desperate for victory that you think Reddit to be your only favorable "battlefield"? I bet you want a Reddit Medal of Valor too huh?  
---
ULTRABIGGESTTHONK emoji goes here.
---
Denies small gangs easy kills of things under it.
---
Takes effort to deal with
---
Sub caps die frequently sure. But if the choice is lose the carrier or lose the battlecruiser, I'd rather lose the BC first.
---
Which in itself to some degree is kind of insane -‘don’t come here and bring content to us, we don’t want it’ o.0
---
cool story bro.
---
#CapLivesMatter
---
Depends on what you mean by large.
---
"lol it's evident". It's also evident that the earth is flat.
---
well, it's not about the JFs but about the cynos. But ye, i guess those survive mostly.
---
Not a big deal, that logistics do not get caught, those guys already got a shitty but hugely important job
---
The point of an interview isn't to try to convince someone they're wrong, it's to ask questions and get responses. That's the problem with your whole "I wish they would go on some other show than TIS" . You don't want someone to interview them, you want someone to tell them off, and that's pretty petty. 
---
That's why Matterall will continue to get interviews and none of those other propaganda outlets will. He conducts himself in a professional manner and not like a squabbling child trying to argue with a parent.
---
we are talking about trigs, not fobs.
---
&gt; I can't imagine a home defense fleet being simple to set up, deploy, and coordinate. No matter what size of cat they are herding.
---
Well, in many cases it doesn't take much of that at all.
---
Just have everyone ratting be in the fleet together and in TS/discord.
---
If someone gets tackled, they light the cyno, then say their name and what they're tackled by, and all the ratting supers and capitals jump there, plus whomever else might be around in a fax.
---
The fleet doesn't have to be particularly coordinated because there job is very easy. They just have to jump and then shoot things.
---
In masses, even a bunch of ratting carriers can deal with a fleet of bombers.
---
True fc. You lost your ship but it looks like your fleet mates are getting out.

I mean you dont have to use spreadsheets to be good at poker or eve but you will be have a better time using them.

Could you give me a tldr of who the talocans are? I’ve struggled to find a clear answer.

Back in my day, we didn't have safeties!
---
So supers worth 20-22b should just have there ehp nerfed because timmy's 8 man gang couldn't kill a pvp buffer fit Hel on his day off? 
---
Straight delusional
---
Thats not a counter thats a stupid thing either make it easy to kill or let it disrupt your active cyno.
---
&gt; Let's be happy they are doing things
---
no

i'm not gonna be content with shitty change for the sake of change when there are easy fixes on the table that they're fucking ignoring for god knows why, and neither should you

You are wrong in this case

Hi,
---
I'm looking for uncut videos showing pvp in EVE. Preferable one that explains what's happening.
---
I've been trying to get into EVE, but each time I spend most of my time doing nothing but travel. I'd love to see how it actually plays when you are seeking action, but the whole thing, not just the clipped version of the action.
---
I was talking about flying the kiki. I am not a fan of the oni.
---
gfys
---
Freud would like to have a few words with you.
---
Two questions:
---
Is there a way to hide or mark individual items on the overview? I want to avoid hacking cans that I cargo scanned and know only contain 2 carbon but I have trouble keeping cans with the same name apart.
---
The last time I played I used [evetrademaster.com](https://evetrademaster.com) to keep track of my profits but it seems it has closed down. Any alternatives that you could recommend?
---
:knife:
---
And then another wave of buddies come in to get blown up as well.
---
the more you post, the more everyone realizes how little you actually know and understand about eve
---
so keep it up
---
I’m glad you are enjoying it. It’s important for new players to not get attached to their ships. Anything you undock should ultimately die and your mindset should reflect that in your fitting. I used to gatecamp in lowsec and noobs would venture in, lose stuff and quit the game. Don’t get too big for your britches. There’s always a bigger ship and when there isn’t a bigger ships there’s always a group with more ppl than you ready to ruin your day. Have fun and fit smartly. Also, Eve is a game where there’s a learning curve. I have found that everyone learns the game at a pace that is equal to the group they are with. Keep that in mind as you go forward and start thinking about what your group is doing in the future. Join a group that does what you want to do and you’ll learn the metas and the tricks of that play style. There’s also nothing wrong with just remaining a corp and doing your own thing wherever you want to and just having fun. So don’t ever feel like you have to eventually join an alliance.
---
Asset safety in its exact current form may or may not be necessary, but *something* like asset safety needs to exist for eve to have any chance of retaining returning players. If a player is thinking of coming back to the game after a break and they find that everything they own was destroyed while they were gone, the majority of them are just gonna leave again, and the game can't afford that. And I will note that, contrary to the common 'asset safety is un-eve' type claims, the game has *had* similar mechanics for a very long time. Under the old station system your stuff might have been locked in a station you didn't own anymore, but at least it still existed and you could get a GM to move a suitcase to lowsec and put the rest up for sale. You'd lose some value (which the current asset safety fee somewhat replicates) but you wouldn't have to start over from nothing, which is exactly the benefit that the current asset safety system replicates.
---
And the particularly annoying thing is that deleting asset safety as people so love to call for wouldn't be a positive change even ignoring that concern. Everyone that can will simply move their stockpiles to NPC stations, large groups will consolidate assets into their core regions where nothing but a full scale invasion from another large group could ever threaten it, and small groups will get fucked over again. You might have the occasional staging fort kill that drops some stuff, but there won't be the universe-wide bonanza of loot pinatas everyone salivates over and mostly it'll just be yet another mechanism encouraging consolidation into big blocs.
---
If you really want to change asset safety, sorry (not sorry) but it needs to preserve the current benefit of saving the majority of a player's stuff. If you want to make citadels drop loot, my personal thought is to replace the 15% asset safety isk fee with 'random 15% of stuff goes into the drop lottery'. This preserves the same cost for the end user, but gives some loot to the attackers. (Obviously this would only be for destroyed citadels, unanchored or manually triggered asset safety would be the same as now, except the ability to manually trigger it would be disabled if the citadel is damaged/reinforced so you can't zoop your stuff out automatically before it's popped.) This does replace an isk sink with a material sink, which isn't really a good thing overall, but if we must have citadels drop loot in some way it's the best I've been able to come up with.
---
Fuck things up, I'm not sure how you would stop 3 or 4 RR Nestors in WH space.
---
Many people do, and many people dont have the isk, or dont want to specialize a ship to kill exclusivly ventures, but that is not the worst part, the worst part is that people that do their effort for their militia will most likely lose their progress, like you said, who wants to run around trying to kill uncatchable stabed ships
---
Got bored, decided to shitpost.  
---
Oh you mean in eve?  Shitty anniversary event was so shitty it made me hate the game, and even with all the cool new changes I'm still so bitter that I'll cut off my own nose to spite my face.
---
except they don't, because structures still have damage caps, which are the second most mind bogglingly retarded mechanical change this game has ever seen, behind only skill injectors
---
fuck off, stealth bomber boi, people who have actually shot structures for anything other than a laugh are in this thread, and you're not one of them

Yup, that’s goons for you.

It’s more that nobody wanted to grind to compete to get kills

94 days to train a rookie ship cyno alt (the standard for most jf pilots) into a bomber with cyno 5 (the shortest training option between bomber/prospect/recon)

so

Second statement is not accurate. He said they would evaluate it and determine if they needed to adjust the rewards.

He said it would affect everyone. Larger more organized blocs would be able to adjust better. Small groups, especially ones that don't rely caps, would be better off due to them being able to engage forces and not worry about any random ship on field being able to light a cyno. The medium sized groups that are starting to amass a cap fleet would probably be hit harder due to not having enough players to fill the new logistical roles.
---
step one: focus most of the development in an area while ignoring and actively harming the others(hello ls/fw and lifeblood and citadels), the same for different playstyles
---
step two: most of the players that don't quit outright move to the area/playstyle that actually gets some attention
---
step three: wow the area that actually got the attention is a HUGE chunk of the current playerbase, who would've thunk
---
&gt;so uhm
---
&gt;you cant put snakes on a ship thats not allowed no
---
&gt;btw this ceptor that can totally tackle you is snaked and faction fit
---
I am not sure if this is satire, honestly..
---
bro i literally shitpost on this subreddit everytime i'm hungry for salt.  you guys are so fucking predictable
---
Literally laughed @ 
---
“they are more committed to listening to dissenting voices”
---
any excuse to shitpost is a good enough excuse for me
---
TL;DR We don't know.
---
We know some of the things they did:   
---
They built a dyson swarm in W477-P. Damage done on it during Seyllin incident caused unstable wormholes to appear and when the star blew up we got Caroline's Star and connections to shattered wormholes.  
---
They basically made wormhole space into what it is now.
---
I love RvB.
---
&gt;Not just shit posting.
---
Your post disagrees
---
It’s just a I win button
---
Damn that was pretty well said. You've got my vote!!!
---
The recent changes are bad for null and cap pilots, AND it’s bad for small gang. Because getting any other meaningful change accomplished with the old cyno mechanics now is going to be hell.
---
This coming from a wormholer.
---
Thank you for the advice! We found a wormhole alliance that have helped us setup a raitaru in a c3. I am trying to encourage members to start exploring and doing gas sites there, as it’s where I learnt to pvp properly. I’ve been massively overwhelmed with support over the year I’ve been planning this. White noise alliance and the new group have had some fantastic teachers.
---
Ty!
---
We need more players with this attitude. Upvoted.
---
You have a jump ship, and a cyno alt, but asking that alt to train two lev V skills is that big a deal?
---
If the imperium came to fight snuff in full force, snuff wouldn’t undock.
---
It was people from those megablocs who told you 4 years ago this shitshow would happen when every dumb nullsec change was rolled out one after another, but this place was too full of obsequious cocksuckers fishing for attaboys from the devs that it got drowned out. Oh now you see it broke the game, great insight, useful for anyone with a time machine.
---
Wormhole groups are great to learn from. Learning to scan and defend your holes are very good places to start. Basically you’re in a good place. Gas sites are good isk. Be patient with getting your newbros out of hisec. It’s scary for them xD
---
It doesnt make it right, but maybe you'll sleep easier knowing I'm just mining for salt.  A two minute dive into my post history on this subreddit would make that super obvious.  
---
Do I think what I'm doing is childish and petty?  Sure fucking do, but for some reason I keep doing it.  Sorry for adding to the filth of the internet/reddit that I personally hate so much.
---
At least he gets paid to do it unlike the rest of us idiots
---
&gt; First off , you suggest that people spending money on the game is making it pay to win.
---
No i think that being ok with people spending money to just get ahead in a pvp environment puts us on the edge. And then from there CCP just has to sugar coat it well enough and people will gobble it up.
---
&gt;Lots of pvpers Plex their accounts so they don't have to krab for money.
---
This is called wallet warrioring. It was considered a disgusting thing back in my day.
---
&gt;This is "fine" However, when someone does the exact same thing with injectors, they are running the game and are a cancer.
---
I didn't say this.
---
&gt; Now while im not going to go into how one person having a titan dosent affect you at all, 
---
It does affect me when i die to their boson.
---
&gt;you really shouldn't call people cancer for such an accomplishment.
---
Good thing i didn't, you are the only one who said that.
---
&gt;Why are you mad that someone is successful?
---
My position has not shifted period over the years. Wallet warrioring is not strictly bad for the environment, it's when wallet warrioring gives that person uncounterable amounts of power that it becomes a problem. And either way its something to look down on imo.
---
oh man if you think i care enough about what you have to say to click on  youtube link youre sadly mistaken.  gonna need a summary from ya there buddy
---
You did a fine job
---
auto targeting missiles only attack targets that are already attacking you
---
well either way w my orca i try to be caught its 500k ehp and eso is getting boring lol
---
didnt know ultralocking is a thing
---
yes but I am against changing it at all with the exception of upping the tax.
---
We like to play wrestle. Sometimes it gets a bit intense. No kink shame plz.
---
It would be tougher if Rise had actually said that.
---
As a null sec denizen I enjoy mining. Its relaxing. Get off your high horse you pompous ass.
---
Olmecca Gold is not an idiot. He's just a bit short sighted.
---
Delete this trash.
---
More like they should have it nerfed so they actually die in battles.  I think you're the one whose delusional here and trying to conflate things.
---
This post is almost as dumb as Talking In Stations #public discussions.
---
Eve history is awesome.
---
Drones haven't dropped Matt's in ages.
---
yup you're right but that doesnt mean thats not a problem.
---
Yeah cause I can see Everest from my house 3head
---
And then I came all over you.
---
And you liked it so much you asked me to get married
---
Lol?
---
I think you’re fucked in the head
---
of course. You can see the Everest, therefore they chose. That makes total sense.
---
Is this a bait post or is he serious
---
Hey now :o the enyo definitely hasn't been a good matchup with a jag in my experience but I love it still! It's so much fun in lowsec. Especially against hecates and kikis.
---
Hull tanked marshall, ur welcome,  i am now a sky captain of test alliance please ignore
---
I use pyfa for ship fitting stats and I've used 1 spreadsheet when I was calculating gas values for huffing. If I'm not interested in industry or market trading, how else would I use spreadsheets? I solo and small gang for pvp and spreadsheets have little, if any, influence when it comes to my style of play. But to say "you will have a better time" is too broad a generalization to apply to all play styles.
---
Well, balancing around isk is extremely dangerous (and honestly, kills the game)
---
If something does not die, it does not matter how expensive those are, they simple are not defeatable. And that is not good for balancing, as it's basically the same as the premium equipment of p2w games.
---
You are then either, king of the hill, and win everything or you are the new guy, and don't win shit...
---
And we can all agree, we want a diverse universe, where it keeps interesting, and not a serenity.
---
BTW your example with the dominix is really good: This is good balancing: Bombers are bad, against everything except bigger ships than BCs. It is the perfect counter for Battleships. And they are also designed for exactly that. 
---
For caps, you do not have such a counter. I would be totally okey, if there was a new ship introduced that is a perfect counter but not really usable for anything else. (though this is eve, so we would find a way to abuse it) Like a glass canon, superfast high dmg BC that has basically zero tracking.
---

---
Impossible, no-one in wangs calls us pio.
---
Nah, I agree. Snuffed will keep kicking everyones ass. Goons is fat and lazy.

But no, you'll continue to not explain anything.

Weirdo.

---
I like lots of people's opinions that don't impact me.
---
Read it, good post. (WHer btw)
---
I think caps need to take longer to respond to a cyno, but not be handicapped by having to jump to a recon/blops. This way, if you see 20 supers in warp to your small gang, you can leave. But if you see a Sabre or two incoming via warp it may be too late.
---
If it becomes more difficult to immediately drop caps, then they of course should be buffed to compensate, either via jump range, or ehp/haw dps. This means when they actually arrive, yes they will smack your sub fleet, but you did have an opportunity to fight/escape etc.
---
Couple ways a cyno could be delayed.
---
(This assumes the future cyno changes are not implemented)
---
1) I’ve seen People suggest giving cyno a spool up similar to inhibitor, meaning you can stop the response fleet altogether.
---
-This is not my favorite option, as now you are denying a response fleet entirely as long as you meet the dps check on cyno ship.
---
2) Try and do more balancing around the cyno inhib.
---
-This is also not my favorite option because it also denies the response fleet entirely.
---
3) (Best option IMO) When any ship jumps to a lit cyno they do not land on the cyno grid. There are two ways I can see this going.
---
  A) Jumping ship fleet will always land near the local star on a personal random grid.
---
  B) jumping ship fleet will land within 1AU of the cyno, but at a random grid.
---
-Between A/B I’m not sure which is better, but I can say that I think this is a much more sustainable approach though it probably won’t make any one group or play style happy.
---
-Cap pilots won’t like having to warp to the combat grid.
---
-Small gang can still of course get jumped by caps, it just takes longer and you can see them coming.
---
-Large scale cap fights can still use their ceptors for cyno, but they will still have to warp onto the grid.
---
(This is the one bit I’m not sure about in my suggestion, is how positively or negatively it could affect the big cap battles.)
---
&gt; Because it doesn't work.
---
No, it just is less efficient than jumping a cyno carrier in.
---
But now the game has changed.
---
I always love a good eve lore read, and this was one of the best.
---
I've had someone in a 15b Malediction get forced off by a single Vedmak so I'm not entirely sure why you believe that a snaked cheap ceptor stands a chance.
---
hmmm...
---
bombers... what if they removed the "no targeting delay after cloaking deactivation"
---
and removed the explosion velocity bonus. 
---
might be over kill but could be enough to shake up the meta away from bomber fleets.
---
It was shitty how?
---
....what?
---
Who said it wasn't enough or is enough or what?
---
They do die in battles, the problem is the battles are few and far between because of the way damage caps are implemented making bringing Ferox's to a structure bash more efficient. Also gotta look at the citadel spam, a hard cap per system or something involving the size of the system would drastically help see those fights escalates because no one wants to structure bash for 3 months.
---
But many things drop items that do.
---
The drones one was just that to the EXTREME.
---
Instead of this, how about a special cyno that can be fit on anything that can't be used by capitals? Basically just a special edition item that is visual only
---
Give each bomber a different weapon system. Rockets for the Hound. Blasters for the Nemesis. Pulse on the Purifier. Keep torps on the Manticore. So you can always stack kinetic resist to make your ships more resilient against bombers.
---
They'll also be adding a decloak timer to bombers.  Being able to lock shit in a paper thin ship as soon as you decloak is op af.
---
Duh
---
You only need 5-10 bombers to kill a cap. You need 20-30 to kill one in 30 secs. Caps still can add up in cost while bombers are stupid cheap
---
Dude the amount of ore you get from loot is nothing compared to the amount of ore you get from a proper mining alt. Just because you dont like mining. Doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it either.
---
Drone npcs used to drop drone poo which refined into minerals. I think this has now been removed from the game. You absolutely need miners, it is totally impractical to build anything worth thinking about without them.
---
u/dunkdinkle
---
That's an interesting suggestion. At that point we wouldn't need to exclude it from capitals.
---
Large enough to alpha. Non-blinged t1 battleships or t2 cruisers.
---
We aren't talking about 200k ehp blinged out wh bhaals.
---
&gt; So you can always stack kinetic resist to make your ships more resilient against bombers.
---
wat.
---
Keep the cyno change .... Just use fireworks bro
---
Hello Francis
---
Use fireworks. Make nice shapes with lasers.
---
Ccp Rise was on talking in stations their aware of the conflict with the cyno change and the player base using them for vigils. He said internally they are working on a solution and dont want to remove that feature altogether.
---
"Z-S Overview" join that channel, click default then every single one of the packs below it please, also expand your overview panel. Other them that, maybe put ecm drones instead of hobgoblims, youll die if a baddie licks you so id recommend having a chance to escape instead.
---
Eh, they just drop dreads on me.
---
Yes, that is at LEAST two months of training on EACH character. That's JUST to sit in said ship of ONE race. To use them properly, its at least three months minimal on every character and an extra month per cruiser. Yes, I want to spend more MCTs and injectors so that I don't get fucked by these changes that came out of no where. If they at least gave us a month, then maybe people wouldn't be annoyed as is.
---
&gt; Dude the amount of ore you get from loot is nothing compared to the amount of ore you get from a proper mining alt. 
---
That's not actually relevant to the statements made.
---
The statement was "You won't have ships without miners" but that is entirely false. There may not be as many ships, or at such a cheap price, but that's not what was being stated.
---
But also, continue being slave labour for others.
---
what ships do you use to rat to make titans?
---
Same here
---
....yeesssss?
---
And here you sit with the rest of us mortals:)
---
Cyno nerf incoming
---
The hell are you talking about!? You cant get ice or gas from loot. Both are needed for ships.
---
You can't get pi from loot. Also needed for ships. 
---
Sure you can have ships in eve without miners but t2 and t3 ships will not exist. And say good by to capitals.
---
And how am I slave labor? Because I mine on occasion and make isk doing it? Or because you are intolerant of playstyles other then your own.
---
Then why do they have record levels of excavator kills. Why are they only going after soft targets. Why are you going into delve if you think everything is going to drop caps on you. Is it because every where else has stopped PVEing because its not worth sitting out in space and being free kills to wormholers?
---
Umm...well...this wasn't a whine thread about the changes. It was to clear up some misinformation about cyno mechanics and the changes.
---
its basically people crying because whenever they pick on the skinny nerd in the school yard, his weightlifting brother steps in to protect him
---
No one escalating when you attack a PVE player is looking for a fight. They are looking to bring overwhelming force to make you leave. Then you get upset that they didn't bring the fight you want.
---
Yes please. Make it easier to fight, not harder.
---
This has been heard. 
---
And it is being considered.
---
I have tried for years to make the community view me as a complete retard.  Here you are showing me up with one single post. I am impressed
---
Very good to hear, i hope that it will be accessible for all player no matter SP.
---
&gt; That´s why there are literally no triglav fleets around
---
Uh, triglavian fleets are pretty much the only game in town in wormholes. Leshak and Kiki are definitely too strong (though I don't think it's really the ship, it's the weapon).
---
This has been heard.
---
It is being considered.
---
However, waving a bloody shirt can also be considered disrespecting the dead.
---
You compare the thorax here to the Moa, Rupture and Maller -- but were't the other 'tier 3' cruisers the Omen, Stabber, and Caracal?
---
Olmecca is a mouth breathing idiot who only wants easy kills and to stop the Goonies
---
If the pilot is retarded and with polarized bombers maybe which are like 150-200m, and you cant kill anything other than a carrier with that.
---
WTB purity seals for my Purifier
---
Except normal people anchor them on keepstars within range of the doomsday.
---
Can I link it by blue tooth to my butt plug? Asking for my butt.
---
Coming from the FGC, I feel like a large number of them are over there. Especially Tekken and Soulcalibur. Also Rivals of Aether, Brawlhalla, and a lot of the more indie side.
---
&gt;How do you counter the "fast" ones?
---
&gt;Lots of guns.
---
&gt;But you already have "lots of guns".
---
Why is everyone so goddamn hung up on subcaps? They have almost no role in this game anymore outside of dreads
---
Probably because Triglavian ships are only OP at the small scale (due to the nature of the spooling mechanic), and in that context if a ship is blatantly OP, people will just avoid or blob it and the ship becomes less desirable to fly. Solo and small gang is sort of self-balancing in that way.
---
lmao you left because no one wanted your wormholes wind your neck in
---
Wrong, very wrong, 1ehp is nearly impossible without super pimped invulns and CDFE. 600k ehp is more resonable for max tank, and any miner who active tanks an orca is just weird, buffer tank all the way.
---
&gt; People would probably be less angry if instead of nerfing everything into the ground they introduced *power creep*.
---
Not 100%, like some of the other mouth breathers here. Olmecca is at least long-sighted enough to realize all nerfs to nullsec safety with no increased compensation is going to make his game preserve dry up.
---
If you wish for the notification to be sent there, so be it.
---
They do die in battles, they die plenty. For fucks sake we dropped them at 0 on a keepstar as heavy tackle against titans
---
I think firework represent happiness not sadness
---
But they are zero fatigue
---
that's the dumbest shit ever
---
I was stoned and then realized waitttttt
---
STOP MINING IN HIGHSECCCCCCC
---
If in highsec the only fuckin thing you should ever mine is one of the following
---
a) Ice
---
b) Event ore
---
c) Moon goo
---
You are wasting your time, your subscription, and if you do that to plex you shouldnt play.
---

A Hulk mines faster and fills up faster than a Procurer does, so the numbers will be slightly different.
---
Cool story. My butt plug is hooked up to a raspberry pi and small led display and speakers and it broadcasts ccp falcons tweets in real time via text to speech and flashes in morse code.
---
Oh. Test renter.
---
Can I lock more than one ship with a passive targeter?
---
I try to start a convo with anyone new that we blap on a gate in lowsec, so that they can make sure to understand what happened and I can give them isk for a new ship if it was make or break for them. But I find a lot of times people are just mad and don't want to chat, they call you a horrible pirate and curse lol.
---
GGG definitely doing a amazing job with communicating with their playerbase
---
The thing is, if you've ever been on a super fleet, or in a fleet fight, I wouldn't have to explain any of this, because it's stupidly obvious.
---
I'm kind sick of typing all this shit over and over again though. it's all in my comment history.
---
wrong... so wrong, people get bored, and want to do shit, if a domi gets tackled and is unretarded enough to have a cyno you can fuckin bet at least 1 dread is jumping, if not battlerorqs and carriers too. People risk their caps on domi, ishtars, and fuckin procurers all the time
---
The entire goal of the CCP employees now just seems to be troll the pvers.  They really don't seem have any other ideas left about how to fix the game or improve the long term health.
---
I'm not disagreeing. Trig ships are generally well-matched by being outranged at the same ship class. Kikis can do a little too much damage for their size though. There's not too much difference between a Kiki and a Drekavac in terms of damage.
---
Best way for a new player to kill a cynabal?  Can I do it in a stealth bomber?
---
god thats retarded of you
---
This is advanced shitposting
---
How is using a glowing ball that 90% of the time means your about to get curb-stomped a good thing to use as a memorial?
---
You don’t need to be sad about someone passing, you celebrate their life and the how that they brought to others.
---
So what you're saying is highsec is gone and anyone who doesn't want to pvp with a bunch of brain dead 14 year olds all the time should just unsub?
---
no one would
---
GGG has faltered in the last 12 months but they are super good, you are correct. Still miss Delve league. That was good.
---
Omg stfu. They have already stated multiple times it will be fixed by CCP Rise.
---
can't wait to see plex prices going up for real.
---
You can rat in 0.1 and 0.2 low sec asteroid belts and loot clone soldier tags. They're worth 30m-40m each. You can also run DED 2 and 3 exploration combat sites, and maybe 4 as well.
---
Did he finally realize that? Because last time i talked to him he was still thoroughly convinced that there needed to be no way for ratters to keep themselves safe period.
---
I think its link of represents a candle . U dont use fireworks but candle in rl life its kinda a representation of that
---
According to Ripard in his ama about his time on CSM. Hilmar couldn't wrap his mind around 3rd parties showing up to fights and screwing with both sides. 
---
I don't know if I want hilmar more involved. But hes seemingly interested in making eve a bit hostile again in a chaotic way which is nice.
---
4 dreks and 6 guardians on a hole isn´t PvP ;)
---
On a more serious note I saw them very rarely in random skirmishes. Maybe they see more use in bigger eviction fights, but the meta there is vastly different from the rest of eve space.
---
IRL candles don’t drop an aircraft carrier on you.
---
Your last sentence nailed why having to warp caps around is a fucking retarded idea. Stop bubbles exist and in defense situations, every second counts. Trying to secure grid while forming a subcap fleet to try and control grid so you can get caps in takes about 5 mins. Most ships die in 30 sec to 1 min. Longer if it’s a rorqual or super. At that rate of response, everyone will die unless you only do things in fleets with people which is just not possible. Or you just die over and over again.
---
I feel attacked :(
---
Lol okay.
---
Lol this is dumb as fuck
---
But fireworks won't light up the map as the cynos do.
---
I know my tea, and the English
---
This is such an egregiously terrible idea encapsulated in a freshly-windexed shitposter film of irony.  
---
I applaud you. Updoot
---
As an interesting parallel to eve: http://imgs.fyi/img/8qxt.png  
---
This is how games die.
---
But the people they try to kill die in 30 secs. How are we supposed to defend anyone without a fast response option? Or you saying we should just die and be thankful when people come to kill us
---
Come get your daily overdose of 'they said something' i dont like...salty.
---
I honestly don't care about response fleets jumping to cynos. I'm OK if that goes away totally.
---
We need to be able to have a cyno on grid with a hostile supercap fleet long enough to get our supercap fleet in to fight them.
---
Warping supers doesn't work because of the bumping.  It literally takes 5 minutes for everyone to get aligned.  Then, pretending you're fighting morons who didn't warp dictors to the cyno beacon the second it went up, it's trivial for them to set up defensive bubbles in line with the cyno.
---
Then, lets say you decide to ping something, it's also trivial to probe down a super fleet and bubble them again.
---
which is ironic because I'm unable to pass solids due to all the electronics in my butt
---
Managing logistics is difficult for *me* to conceptualise and *I* don't find it fun. Ergo, managing logistics is difficult for *everyone* to conceptualise and *nobody* finds it fun.          
---
Am I r/eve-ing right?          
---
Not disagreeing with you, btw.
---
Could have been doing what I do with random ship hulls I want to fuck around with. If it's not something I'm willing to fly all over Highsec shopping for, then I'll just dig through my module chests and slap some shit in. Granted, I've only really done that with frigates, destroyers, and cruisers so far, but I'm sure there are some folks out there space rich enough to build an Orca or even a Rorqual out of spare parts.
---
Only 2012...
---
that's what the ansiblex cyno beacons do. People aren't thinking before they open their mouths tho, said beacons are in known fixed positions and as such are easy to interdict.
---
More than 50 skills in the queue.
---
Will self-districting your ships in mass do it?
---
Well it's a bit of a naff send off to use corvettes, honour the departed by lighting them in Blops.
---
i'm pretty sure it will even be more accessible, as there will be no combat influence
---
Gay narrative, bad propaganda. Undock Titan, uninstall Eve. Gtfo.
---
That's not really the same thing, though. The cyno is traditional and it has special meaning. Remembering the dead in EVE isn't just about flashing lights and bright colours, it's about the symbol of the cyno, used to guide the dead on to the next world.
---
o7
---
Cynos are used to guide ships from long distances away along a journey. Thus, lighting a cyno for your dead friends is representative of guiding them on to the next world, whatever that may be.
---
Sir, this is a Walgreens...
---
Lol, exactly? The goal is to make subcaps applicable in large fights again. Or are you saying it makes sense that the majority of ships in eve are usless in major battles? 
---
The issue of supercap proliferation isn't that we can now make that many, the issue is that they're too useful, how does it make sense that a titan can apply anything below a battleship? Imo if you drop a titan and run into a significant subcap fleet, the solution shouldn't be drop more titans. The solution should have to be countering with your own subcaps because you titan can't apply to a cruiser gang and dropping more titans would simply be exposing you to lose more.
---
How does that relate to this interview?
---
Thank you, guys. I've now joined KF!
---
Well I mean I think it’s okay that the answer to capitals is capitals just as the answer to sub capitals is sub capitals. 
---
The thing that I find is nice about Eve is that there are a large variety of play styles out there. If you want subcapital fights you can go find a subcapital fight. If you’re a small alliance with the resources of a small alliance you can go fight another small alliance 
---
I don’t think it’s somehow unfair or oppressive that smaller alliances cannot pose existential threats against larger groups of players. A retribution gang or a bomber fleet has their place in small ship combat and capitals have their place in big ship combat. 
---
Why should a large group of people who have the players ready and willing to be online at all times of the day ready to defend their space, be disadvantaged against a small gang? If alliances next to each other say “hey let’s be friends instead of shooting each other” how is that a bad thing that needs to somehow be punished?
---
The fact that isk is buyable with real money and that injectors allow month old pilots into big toys is an issue all its own but who’s to say that people who want to play with big ships should have to wait 2-3 years before they get to do so? Don’t they deserve to play the way they want to as well even if it doesn’t fit the viewpoint of how older players think they should play the game?
---
I can’t get behind the idea that I should be able to sit in a ship that takes half an hour to acquire and be able to pose any threat against a ship that takes hundreds of hours to acquire or an alliance that has taken years to build. Should I be able to nibble at them? Sure I can, I can take my pvp ship and go murder their ratting ships. Heck if I find a dumb pilot in a capital with no support and no way of getting support I can even kill him. But in a coordinated fleet fight subcapitals should not outclass capitals in my opinion
---
This. They break the logic that several hundred of the hull class a size down can beat 100 of the hull class a size up, mainly due to their colossal EHP advantage over BS (which massively amplifies the count-to-volley, as well as the additional survival time FAX can grant). 
---
On a piloting standpoint, they don’t transition as smoothly between individual piloting skill/responsibility, and fleet tactics/coordination with simplified commands as subcap fleets do as the fleet size changes, probably due to the points raised above - there are fewer axes you can demonstrate individual skill with.
---
I actually read his manifesto because work was slow, and he had this bit.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yBNk4pX2TK8ytP0tQhsqFlaTtOQ20Jx9phDncEkJjD0/edit#gid=0
---
Rows 4-7 has the bit where he talks about things.
---
And here I am adding yet another essay deconstructing your argument on a 4th layer reply. Because this is clearly going to be read by the entire subreddit. 
---
I don't even realize I wasn't called out here and I genuinely believe that I can win an internet argument through intellectualism. Humans are clearly rational thins and will cave int to my superior logic.
---
&gt;quit in 2012
---
I agree cyno inhibs are too easy to kill and aren't  great counter play but it is a method.  
---
At the end of the day, any time you're making an incursion into enemy space, you shouldn't be surprised when they respond with overwhelming force.
---
But like this, you got no way to change the political landscape in eve anymore. It used to be that you could defeat 50 organized supercaps with 400 dudes. This caused the situation, where you could win any war, if you managed to keep your guys logging in and fighting. Those fights are fun, for all sides.
---
(Just to clear things up, I don't speak about T1 Cruisers, I speak about ANY subcap possibility. It can be a few hundred mills per ship)
---
If this comment legitimately hurts your feelies you should probably just let the game go from your heart. It would be healthier for you.
---
I would get behind a capital laser miner. And the excavators like fighters thing. Yeah F1 walk away but that ore hold in the excavator will fill up, it will come back regardless of rock being popped or not and you’d have to manually deliver the load before it goes idle and you have to F1 again. Oh and if it’s not delivered it’s a nice juicy target for a bomber. 
---
And yes fuck panic
---
I still think they need a spool up cyno that any ship can fit. Then we could still use t1 frigs for like regular every day cynos. life is going to suck after this but im glad I have a JF at least.
---
You basically just signed your post like a pubbie.  Well done.
---
You must be really hateful to just assume that anyone that holds an opinion different than you is not interested in balance and is being disingenuous. Then you go a step further and you aren't even willing to make the argument for your position.
---
So I haven't played in years (at least half a decade now) and I was wondering what happened to stations? I see they're now "faction structures"? Anywhere I can read up on what happened?
---
Tbf compared to normal rats
---
Take your upvote, this made me laugh.
---
god forbid you actually need to think for a bit before dropping an unlimited amount of capitals
---
My first day back to FCing, I stopped calling when our gang engaged because I was too focused on tank management to stay alive. It's always good to have a backup until that shit becomes natural again.
---
Has anyone gotten the download link yet?
---
Right they should just remove them
---
Alright, at this point people should be banned for this shit
---
They do more dps than nullsec battleship rats.
---
ah yes, nerf any kind of mid-slot heavy PvE and anything farther out than 24km
---
Factorio devs are pretty amazing.
---
Npc activity as a gateway to increased player activity. This is has always been the way to introduce more reasons to undock and play, we just need to go further. 
---
Naturally, some more pvp minded people don't want more npcs... especially npcs that might be under control/direction of other players. 
---
Then again... those players don't have the balls to fight diamond rats.
---
Let me use this space to remind you of our totally random wormhole gang made out of four dudes - but only one can scan. We achieved minor things like killing an afk sabre once and we close our holes and crab together but we do have a fort which is our cool tree nest.
---
This seemed liked the perfect post to remind you of our perfect playstyle so stealthy wow
---
wormholer btw contact vandamme13 in game for details
---
hey bud :D &lt;3
---
I mean, you have to understand that different people have different goals in game.
---
Also, some fights just aren't fun to some people.
---
For example, I don't really have fun fighting nano kitey shit. I'm not good at it, I'm not interested in getting good at it,  and if I'm krabbing and some nano kitey shit is around, if I can't boson trap that shit, I'm just gonna dock and go ride my bike.
---
That doesn't mean I think it needs nerfed, or I want that playstyle to go away, I just don't feel compelled to play the game that way.
---
I don't remember that.
---
As long as I can remember, eve was always touted as a sandbox where you could do whatever you wanted, including PVE for EPIC LOOTS if that was your thing.
---
&gt; There is nothing that broadcasts "oh this is a dangerous one" to players about trig frigs in highsec
---
The name literally tells you what they do and all the frigs do similar damage.. I'm not sure what your problem is.
---
And I managed to solo the conduits solo with 3 characters in non-blinged ships. So...
---
Delete dis I just made this fucking account
---
Fuck you
---
To be fair, that was years ago.
---
By coincidence last year was one of the first years I didn't play POE for a while, so I probably missed out on their slipups.
---
Nobody said they are surprised but theres no counterplay to it except for cyno inhib which is ... useless.
---
There's a tag system (check your keyboard shortcuts in options). You have to enable the tag column (and have enough space) in your overview settings.
---
I don't know if it works for cans though, haven't used it personally. Don't see any reason it wouldn't.
---
Adding abyssal space, Triglavian invasions, more dynamic NPC attacks, etc isn't content for PVE? It's trolling?
---
I totally agree with you concerning Titans. I would love to see them more as a buffing siege weapon. So If you want the best command bursts bring a titan but personally i think they shouldnt bei able to utilize HAW guns
---
We’re talking here in a context of a hundreds to thousands of players coalition. I’m pretty confident there are enough players in there that would engage if they weren’t hampered by the concept of killboards mattering, or only undocking with a FC in a doctrine.
---
That said, I appreciate that it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea to take on a roaming nano gang, I’m not a wild aficionado of the style myself - you’ll find almost every ship I’ve lost over the last 12 months has had at least one 1600mm plate fit ;)
---
On a content creation/enjoyment sense it would make more sense to me if you stepped back and let people who enjoyed the game in a corresponding way handle the interaction. Much as I’d expect the subcap/smallgang aficionados to step into a complementary role like tackle or leave people to it when there’s a big capital throw-down.
---
As a final point, you’re massively missing out on a host of fun if you’re not prepared to get stuck in to finding a role you love in a &lt;50 subcap gang, or a 10 player kitchen sink fleet (though maybe not missing quite as much fun as there has been).
---
In terms of extreme safety, any deep space transport is great for low volume items. You can make them extra tanky and using an afterburner align very quickly. Passive tank recommended. 
---
Otherwise a decent fit nereus can handle most hauls if you want cheap, where a freighter is more for moving massive bulk. 
---
Just pick the ship that fits your hauling needs.
---
&gt;The name literally tells you what they do
---
...no they don't. "serpentis scout" "recon [trigname]", which one does more dps? I'm not asking what you *know*, I'm asking what you can tell from the name.
---
Sites aren't the issue either. Rats that just randomly show up are.
---
If you limit torpedoes to Manticores, torpedo damage from bombers will always be heavily skewed towards kinetic. Therefore any ship fit with heavily anti-kinetic resistance will be guaranteed to take much less torpedo damage.
---
that's not entirely true
---
phased plasma into basis isn't ideal
---
the real lesson here is to stop taking fights with 3 actual people
---
Are you PIO leader?
---
Hi it's me, the friend of you random Bitter Vet who came here from the pinged jabber link to tribally upvote your post.
---
I also wanted to add a few points:
---
1) The change does not create fun stuff for my own activities but creates fun for people of other playstyles at the expense of my playstyle. So let me just argue that it will not create more fun at all. **#Nullprivilege** dictates that I should totally ignore other playstyles. So I declare that the change is just an inconvenience to everyone.
---
2) What Eve Online needs is more fun in my **#nullprivileged** playstyle. As long as a change doesn't create that I call any change bullshit.
---
3) Let's ignore that CCP makes the change for long term health of the game at the risk of angering me, the **#nullprivileged** Bitter Vet. So I will now just argue how the change is actually about Hilmar's financial goals and/or CCP's short term cash grab, as I have to inject something like 2m SP.
---
4) I also agree with the completely impartial perspective about the change I heard on INN twitch yesterday. INN features a **non-#nullprivileged** person every once in a while to legitimize giving tons of voice the random linemember with awfully argued one-sided perspective. Now I will take that perspective and parrot it to you.
---
5) Lastly I want to mention that in making these changes, CCP is listening to an imaginary reddit minority. It doesn't matter that for how many years us, **the #nullprivileged** linemembers has actually been that vocal minority on r/Eve and in any other medium regarding Eve.
---
Well the point of my post was, having SEEN other possibilities for asset safety, including from other CSMers, I think there are MUCH better solutions to a midway between current and zero asset safety.
---
Nah I thought it was legitimately hilarious and pretty accurate to a lot of posts I see, and updooted.
---
Plus, you can win EVE, but you can never truly let it go &lt;\3
---
Well, yes, I'm sure that people not near-AFKing or multiboxing beyond their attention (apart from leaving a piece of local sticking out) is a factor as well. This is also good - you shouldn't be able to print ISK while not actually playing the game.
---
But let's be realistic, a significant part of the loss of 'players' in null *is* because botters can't run their scripts safely without local.
---
&gt;The income from these Damavik gangs is a lot to some of us
---
do they drop anything?
---
What are people hunting these ships in?  I've been thinking of spending some time in HS to see what the Triglavians are all about but not sure what to fit.  I'd like to keep it below 300m.  Thanks in advance.
---
They warp scram too. Insta lock. Dead in 5 seconds.
---
In terms of the idea for jumping to a cyno not instantly landing your ass next to said cyno, the idea has been posed before:
---
Effectively you would warp in from the edge of the system as per normal warp, from the direction of the system you came from. You could get stopped by a bubble, but the hunters would have to know what direction you would be coming from to do that.
---
my 4 year old loved it
---
recon trigs don't point.
---
This is getting annoying
---
No this is Patrick
---
According to quite a few of the posts in here they don't tackle, so anyone not AFK should be able to at least warp away.
---
*witty response about goons being the best*
---
No we need less ships with covert ops cloak not more.
---
It's so true. I'm like 97% away from game but still slack/discord active. I went on a blops fleet last night which I think was the first time I logged in in close to 3 months. I had a good time, enjoyed the blackout.
---
Should games be set up around people for the people that are semi-afk, or around the people that are playing? the answer seems obvious to me.
---
You got only yourselves to blame, by upvoting the first one.
---
We need capitals to become rare again. Where deploying and losing a carrier actually means something other than "well that's 1,5 hour mining".
---
Matterall is an idiot. He doesn't have a basic grasp of what is going on. He fawns excessively over a moronic CCP developer that honestly should be fired. A good reporter is not scared to ask the tough questions. Think Walter Kronkite. Matterall does fluff pieces, nothing more.
---
I’ve just never understood having ships that are designed for “clandestine”  activities not being very stealthy
---
Well sure but (i) that's not 100 nerds and (ii) if I'm 10 jumps away they shouldn't be able to drop on me instantly.
---
And anyone else that knows anything about capital fights.
---
Thank you.
---
On second thought, it probably would be healthier if I let it go.
---
https://i.imgur.com/vfhVpgN.jpg
---
And yeah, the blackout stuff seems really exciting. I'd honestly re-sub if my life had room for EVE, but alas, when you're mostly active during AUTZ and you also have to go AFK for weeks (Or months) at a time, it's not very easy.
---
I literally said "time to train Cyno 5" not the rest of the skills.
---
🤣 but.. they can only be equipped to force recons and bloops now.
---
Sorry those were the Guristas something or other. Elite rats also on custom offices. Trigs can really do a number on a ship though. Pretty risky to tank them when you got multiple launch pads.
---
Im sorry EVE.
---
They give about 10mil in salvage
---
Wrong about recent and just announced changes. The whole "Chaos" schtick. It is stupid and is not producing any results other than appease a few small gang players who couldn't get kills without CCP holding their hands. The new cyno changes are just plain dumb and obviously not thought out in any way, shape, or form.
---
I am all for making Null Sec more dangerous, but you get that by giving folks a reason to fight, not by blindly swinging the nerf bat.
---
Still more risk than the Covert cloaked transport.
---
Umm...yeah, in an earlier post you said “remove asset safety.”  Make up your mind troll.
---
I used a pve machariel. You need a lot of tank so I would think a decent battlecruiser might work. Honestly not sure though. My 450mil machariel took 10 minutes roughly to kill them.
---
The bonus can be "penetrates 15% of a structure's damage cap."
---
I would insult your reputation back but I don't know who you are.
---
yes and i'm pointing out that that's an irrelevant comment to make because cyno 5 doesn't matter if your cyno alts can't fly ships that can fit covert cynos
---
keep up, junior
---
So instead you only fight PvE ships. Thank you for proving my point.
---
You forgot the local blackout which is driving peeps to unsub for good...
---
No. Maybe something like a VNI or a Vigilant if you can catch it, or an Ashimmu. Cynabals are extremely powerful if flown well, there's not really any direct counters in a 1v1 scenario.
---
&gt; don't have the balls to fight diamond rats.
---
if you had the balls to fight those players maybe they wouldn't need to introduce diamond rats idk just a thought
---
also super dumb comment btw, fighting npcs will never be a substitute for direct player interaction
---
What kind of fits do you use for hunting them? I wanted to maybe do that too. Is there a good way for tracking them down?
---
Look up Chessur's channel on youtube, especially the 'small gang archetypes' series. Most of his videos have at least comms enabled, and sometimes even commentary. It's a good insight into extremely good piloting and teamwork.
---
[plenty of ammo in the corp history](https://evewho.com/pilot/requiescat)
---
but you might bear in mind that my ad hominem actually touches on a real and valid point - your gameplay style doesn't involve grinding structures on a regular basis. mine does.
---
My level 4 machariel fit is 1400m artillery and armour rep. The best way to kill them would be to use something with small guns and drones. I’m not sure about hunting them, as I only kill them if they show up in my mission systems.
---
What in the world did they have on the captor to get it to 15b?
---
Also how did they get forced off? We tackle ved’s and the like l all the time with 6km ceptors.
---
Rapid changes to keep player interest, as the changes push out hardcore established players, leading to unstoppable player count bleeding, and eventual death.
---
I'm not a fan of the cyno changes, but, well, cyno vigils can easily changed to something else.
---
He's not wrong he's just an asshole.
---
I am a dev and you will respect my authoratay.
---
I think mining adds to the appeal and immersion of the game. It's cool that there is a complete economy that begins with mined minerals. Having everything made from reprocessed loot doesn't have the same feel to it.
---
4+ years...
---
Been pandering to them since before Dominion. 
---
That doesn't change the fact this change is just bad.
---
Make the bonus ignore a portion of damage caps.
---
Probably when they remove it from the rest of the game.  
---
Don't be mad at wormholers. It's our civic duty to punish NS carebears.
---
\&gt;  The statement was "You won't have ships without miners" but that is entirely false. There may not be as many ships, or at such a cheap price, but that's not what was being stated. 
---
You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
---
Because people like the guy above you whine to much.
---
The trig ship names tell you what they do. Tangling web. Anchoring scram, etc. The trig's have a scheme, no other races do not
---
If you're that mad over missing that small a amount of sp then you're fucking retarded lmao
---
lol savage
---
Id rather see T2 resists and an overhaul of the tankability of them, if they going to be 2B isk Cyno boats, they better have some fucking staying power on field.
---
Ah sorry, I thought it was about the RNG aspect of the new suits.
---
Just make a cyno module, that noone can jump to. Civilian Distress Beacon. Does the same, cant be jumped to.
---
Everything was max rolled abyssal mods.
---
The Vedmak shot the ceptor until it hit a shot and instantly got it into hull, forcing it to fuck off.
---
yea while youre at it just change the name of the game to "cloaky battleships online"
---
My problem with this interview and the interview done by Hillmar is that TiS is not challenging them at all. both interviews sound like a FoxNews interview of Trump......Rise, Hillmar and the rest need to be interviewed by people who will ask the tough questions and aggressively challenge them and their stupid ideas....
---
I don't know how you know I'm named after my father but it's mildly unnerving.
---
And can you tell how much dps they do from the name? Because that's the issue I'm talking about.
---
I think the questions that were asked more than covered a lot of concerns being expressed about the changes. Perhaps they weren't in the attack dog style that players like you who aren't very fond of the changes perhaps wanted, but they were asked none the less. 
---
Some of you people are pissed and want to bark at everybody, especially CCP. That's not how you conduct an interview though. Walter Kronkite was never that kind of journalist. You need to take a hard look at him if you think he was what you're asserting. He asked the questions, but he never went at his guests like you are implying you want. Quoted directly from you:
---
&gt; They need someone willing to tell them live that they are wrong, and be able to say why. 
---
It obvious you just want someone to go at them and tell them how wrong they are. That's not interviewing them, that's an berating them.
---
&gt; Capital ship melt when fighting each other they literally melt,
---
so its like any other ship class?
---
No because the fax dies instantly to dds the hard cyno for super battles is an around no acceptions. It's the only ship that can stand up to keepstar and Titan dds
---
Okay, so let me get this straight. You believe that any time someone tackles a capital, they should bubble up, the fc should split their fleet into two parts, one to stay inside the bubble, unable to warp, in a very vulnerable spot, potentially out of range of any logi they might have, just so they can decloak a recon that may or may not warp in cloaked. The other part of the fleet should do what, just anchor up normally?
---
The problem with your thinking on the warp vectors is that you seem to think everything is at zero on the anomaly. If that were the case, then yes many things would be pulled from a relatively similar vector into the bubble. What you clearly haven't thought about, though, is that a ratter is literally never at 0 on the anomaly. In theory, just that one variance in position opens up close to 180 degrees worth of vectors on the same plane that would not get caught in the bubble, and that's not even counting the "10%" of anoms that would be vertically outside of the vectors caught by said bubble.
---
there are many, mostly indie dev games

Hi.  Creator of the video here.  Music is one of the touchiest subject when it comes to making videos, you simply can't please everybody, chill-ish electronic music have been farily well received so I'm playing it safe.

I do appreciate suggestions and constructive critism, so thank you for your comment.
---
No and neither does any other rat, but the frigates do frigate damage dessies dessie etc. This isn't a new concept idk why this is even happening
---
lets start a petition for hilmar in shittalking in stations
---
Thanks for the link! Also just heard there's a new ship called the Porpoise how does that compare?
---
I really don’t want to be mean though, would a special ammo to replace vigil cynos for the standup firework launchers be cool?

Shh we don't talk about that half of the sand in the sandbox.

There is no response fleet that can outmaneuver bombers without a spy in the fleet to nab the blops, they can warp clocked and jump with very little fatigue.

You're famous!

Talkimg about recon dramaviks - what is required to kill them? 
---
Can i kill them in a frig?
---
Good Stuff
---
Yea you cunt, use a tragedy to push your bitch ass agenda.
---
What a fucking turd human being you are.
---
Costs and skills deal with accessibility, not balance.
---
Mainly this. Nobody wants to bother going carrier hunting with their own carrier. They want to use cheap nano shit to kill caps and complain when it won't work.
---
i was just saying it to be demeaning
---
I'm spinning what I didn't know? That's nice

I'm amazed they didn't jump to whore on the fort like every batphone ever. I don't know what I'm "Spinning' since I said I never heard they formed for it.

You have no actual evidence anything they've done will hinder those fights and large capital fights are so rare it would take a decade of evidence collection to source enough data for a claim like that
---
When was the last time wormholers evicted someone? Or had a war? Wormhole is the biggest care bear haven in the game. You guys can change your damn gate network whenever you want.
---
But heres another side to this. Do you agree the game is stagnant atm? And is this stagnation, for whatever reason, linked to there not being more large wars in Eve?
---
If you do, then you have to atleast consider the fact that every time you waste 100 peoples time, thats time they used to be defensive instead of being offensive. Im not saying this because Im against small gangs, but there is a limit to how many manhours an alliance has access to. Imagine if ten groups, which is a very low number, decide to roam through your space every day. Forcing us to waste that amount of manhours each and every day will only cause blocs to turtle up.
---
Stagnation will become worse.
---
Bullshit
---
Because you're being a drama queen
---
I see what ya did there.
---
So, someone told me to reprocess my cheap rat loot and sell minerals to make money, and to try to sell the better stuff at Jita or something.... What about tags? Should I just sell those? Are they worth hanging on to? I don’t even know what to do with them, except I thought they’re part of some of the stuff you buy with loyalty points.

Thanks!

Supercap Umbrella boi seems upset. It's a simple concept: you live in null and therefore cannot be afforded the safety of hisec.

Did someone hotdrop your rorq and now you have to swipe your credit card for another?  
---
I'd say there's probably less infighting between wormhole groups now, simply because we can enter a system without you docking up now. Gotta pop those Delve mining titans
---
Or maybe changing to cooldown to something that would be useful for more than 1 TZ a day.  Like 8hr so that I can do EUTZ in the AM and USTZ in the PM?
---
Cause why would you want to prevent people from playing....
---
Still crazy the guy who helped create this game had 0 concept of it many years into this games life.
---
Wait so Kendarr left goons? Another FC leaves as leadership's 'carrot on a stick' tactic doesn't work?
---
;(
---
you nob, value 2 is better
---
&gt; the pvp pilots want actual fleets and wars (wormholers and small gang players not included, most of them just want free kills)
---
Oh please. Cozying up in big groups then anchoring on an FC in fleet and pressing F1 when told is apparently your definition of PvP?
---
Give us a break, there's people that want free kills anywhere and everywhere, and some others who actually want good fights all the same. The difference remains that small gangs often have to fight outnumbered if they want to fight. So spare us your shitty rhetoric about wormholers and smallgangs. And people wonder why the nullseccers are so despised.
---
I can see where that might come from, as you seem to criticize those for calling out blobbing. Well, blobbing is the way to make sure your fight goes totally right without losing much compared to the other dude. Maybe it's not the smallgangs that wants "free kills" after all.
---
And I personally don't have any issue with blobbing. People roam in your space, it's your right to fend them off by any means. Just don't play the "free kills" card when you undock caps to fight T3Ds or send a 80-man cerbs fleet to fight off frigs.
---
I’m not sure if you’re confused or you just pulled a random putdown out of your ass but I quietly left over disgust from goon reactions to the whole chaos era thing and not wanting to have everybody everywhere blue.

They basically want a instanced PVP match: them vs their target, with an *approved* number of Home Defense ships of *approved* classes arriving after an *approved* amount of time has elapsed.
---
It's funny how nonconsensual PVP only works in one direction.
---
Sure all other ships use triage, siege locking them on space ... or are just big immobile targets that you can ignore if you rewarp.        
---
Capitals are bit different.
---
Good man, I am enjoying this content too.
---
Poorly. The Porpoise has its niche, but it'll be a strict down-grade from the Orca for what you're talking about doing.
---
What are you some kind of a TZ slut?
---
Dreddit SRPs all my fun doctrines 100% because Dreddit is cool like that.
---
Hey, I just finished Cashflow for Capsuleers and now I'm a bit overwhelmed. I don't know what to do to continue this adventure. I wanted to join the Amarr navy, but is that even possible? I'm really not sure how to continue.
---
Things die. Tell them be more vigilant. Pay attention . Rather than be "no matter what I do supers will save me" attitude
---
This isnt true tho. The only thing thats correct is that smaller groups are more coordinated.
---
Aids gameplay. Supers shouldn't need to be used for a home defense vs roaming gangs. That's shit tier effort
---
Carrier - 2 bill
---
Kiki - 200m
---
No u
---
It's good to be back with my fellow plebs.
---
I know I wrote that, I had a reason for doing so. that’s why I addressed it with the cloak suggestion. If the enemy fleet has stop bubbled the entire system, then you will probably have to ship a few subcaps and go clear their bubbles.
---
While I agree with you on using the deaths of others, lighting a cyno is basically a tradition at this point.
---
And we do change them, whenever the space is empty or there is no one to fight!
---
that means you're likely nlocking the cookie it uses - it pops up once, you click no, and it uses a cookie to track that choice and not display it again.
---
No, read dude. I want your “Fast response fleet” that keeps your ratter or miner alive to be subcaps. Once your subcaps have gotten some reps on grid and you’ve cleared bubbles etc, then your caps can warp in.
---
Welcome back. You always have a place with us, its dirty and cramped but atleast the toxic juice keeps us going.
---
But if you can’t cyno onto a combat grid anymore, the bumping issue can be fixed as the fleet can now jump and be spread out, ready to align and warp.
---
Exactly, I haven’t seen that before but it sounds very similar to what I was proposing. I’ve actually made more allowances for the defender fleet however in allowing you to enter system with a gate cloak and have a very short guaranteed warp distance.
---
Your opinion is appreciated, as always.
---
Unfortunately there's no agenda to push, unless community mourning IS an agenda - at which point I am guilty as charged.
---
They either warp to the cyno, or probe you down, and bubble you there, or set up defensive bubbles on the grid.
---
You really can't warp supercaps to a fight.
---
carrier is cheaper than that after insurance. proper fit kiki is more like 300m, so 5 kikis are 1.5b+
---
See BOT ping above. I would have linked dscan for it but I don’t have it anymore. 
---
No need to be obtuse about it. The batphone got scouted, and either we didn’t commit anything other than 15 phantasms, or maybe we just only had 15 phantasms bc all we cared about was a fight, for some badly timed short notice anchoring fortizar No Visual poked us about.
---
What is the niche it's for? 
---
Seems pretty cheap, if I wanted to mine in an unsafe situation would I be better with a Barge or anPorpoise?
---
First thing I disable everytime.
---
I never said anything similar to that, nor do I understand where you’re getting this “They” bullshit. You can keep making shit up if you like, it doesn’t make it true. 
---
What I have proposed is that capital ships are no longer the fastest and simplest answer to anyone you don’t like in sov null. Instead, they would respond a little slower, and if they want to catch a half smart fleet they’ll need their own subcap and bubble support.
---
he was literally a director though? or am I being whooshed?
---
No he doesn't, he's an idiot.
---
Did you read the change I proposed? Because with the changes they can’t be probed and they cannot be warped to via beacon. They can run into a stop bubble if they are too slow hitting warp, but that’d take a fast response and a good amount of skill and coordination to set up from the attackers.
---
No, the current cyno change is bad for everyone. So, a few people that actually care are posting about it.
---
Not if I browse /r/Eve AT work.
---
Been asking for this for many years. Finally :)
---
I don't see anywhere where you proposed that they can't be probed, but that would be pretty fucking horrible.  I would guess more supercaps die to getting probed down then anything else.
---
And no, you don't need to be very quick to drop stop bubbles.  Certainly not if you are spreading out to avoid bumps.
---
Its the pharolux and yes thats a big advantage since they are protected by a damage cap so invading hostile regions Sure will be fun when they can send reinforcements to the beacon whilst yours are dependand on a recon cyno
---
And about the Level of Defense now ccp overkilled it once more as this time sending help will turn into a massive pita
---
But hey i guess hilmar knows what hes doing with this patches right between classic wow and borderlands 3
---
Fair now I understand. It was the damage lock from all the other ones to kinetic (my misunderstanding) that had me confused
---
You forgot ma boi corax 
---
^F ^in ^chat
---
But no in terms of NPC's, it doesn't make a huge difference currently. CCP need to switch the old rats to new ones or something, it'll make PvE better in general
---
RIP to your alliance
---
Just like triple the damage but w/e
---
Also eve has been screaming for years to get subs that can kill caps...well here they are. Vs other subs they aren’t good because of the spool. Low alpha, and shit range mean you have to use a low damage ammo for range or constantly have to re start spook when something burns out of occult
---
Tldr dates are Hard and login is even harder
---
i would assume the devs would be smart enough to rebalance things around this.
---
Just like 2.5 times the damage but w/e
---
Also eve has been screaming for years to get subs that can kill caps...well here they are. Vs other subs they aren’t good (when you consider price) because of the spool. Low alpha, and shit range mean you have to use a low damage ammo for range or constantly have to re start spool when something burns out of occult
---
Just delete all capitals.  Problems solved.
---
&gt;as a gateway to increased player activity
---
Remove haws period. Fighter and fb balance is needed, the rest of your post is bad.
---
Sure there isnt
---
Wind-up on DDs is plenty long to get a number of ships in, and if there's enough DDs on grid that it's a problem, the opposing side probably doesn't want to be dropping at point blank anyway.
---
I'm not saying it won't stop any escalations, but it would remove most of the problem while still addressing supercap umbrellas, whereas cynos on supers basically eliminates the point.
---
The type of people who come are risk averse and  aren’t looking to engage anything that could pin them down and make them fight. Therefore the play is to put tackle and bubbles on them and make them engage, which generally ends being very run because they don’t want a slugfest. They want to kite/run away.
---
We lost something like 5 Kiki’s to a 15-20 man catalyst/corm gang in a wh fight a week or so ago. We “won the objective”, but we also outnumbered them and they just showed up at the end to whore and kill a few Kiki’s
---
Kitey nano aren’t brawly by nature, so they deserve to get nuked/bosoned.
---
Unless you get one down before the cyno is lit...
---
This would be nice.
---
Lmao @ people who think this.
---
This is not the worst idea floated here recently.
---
Big facts
---
The only correct way to use reddit. Who would waste their time here without being paid?
---
I don't get it
---
Fair? What game are you playing? :-)
---
Tbh I expect the prices will fall to pre-announcement levels, recons aren’t that difficult to build (just like Combat recons)
---
You could try the other career missions. Tyey're all pretty useful info.
---
Have you tried the Sisters of Eve epic arc? It's a chain of missions designed for new entries to EvE.
---
If you're sick of missions, you mentioned Amarr navy. You can join faction warfare with the Amarrs  though make sure you read up a little about it before you go.
---
same tbh
---
Why do you feel entitled to a 'fair fight' when you're in another man's house?
---
Reprocessing loot actually will reduce its value because you likely dont have the facilities or skills to reprocess efficiently. However it makes it much easier to sell and possibly smaller in m3 so easier to move.
---
You can hold on and sell tags. They're small and some are worth a lot though if you arent really looking for the valuable ones yours probably arent worth much.
---
the contractor is a 1 day old alt
---
Botter sends money to 1 day alt -&gt; "gets scammed" by the RMT'er who paid money on a website
---
Perfect CCP evasion, except in cases like this where the person who paid money is dumb enough to use their main to do RMT
---
Nah, I think I'll lose an AFK Orca to roaming triangles. Then I'll take to reddit with a bee in my bonnet after losing the second, still forgetting to add them to my overview, leaving you wondering when I'll return to seethe yet again.
---
Module more expensive, higher fuel cost.
---
3 clones instead of 1.
---
Only counts as 1 clone location, so the hard 10 max from skills can technically be 30 clones, in 10 locations. 
---
Probably would cut down on some structure spam a bit, as I know plenty of structures that exists solely for having multiple clone bays in a system.
---
🤷‍♀️.
---
I would rather let them express themselves than be talked at by someone with an agenda.
---
dont flood ccp support with corvette deaths.
---
I think risk averse isn't the correct label. It isn't currently possible to drive a slugfest comp into a bloc's territory and not get blobbed to shit. Part of that will always happen due to local/overall numerical advantage (local due to it being their territory, overall due to the reality of engaging a bloc as a smaller pvp group), but there's a large component of that reality that seems driven by turbopowered krabs who just want the potential threat gone, so they can continue watching numbers go up, rather than players who are actually interested in rising to a challenge.
---
Speaking for my group and those we have ties to, we're already entering another group's space expecting to be outnumbered, but there's a big difference between trying to take on a low percentage fight you'll have to leverage every ounce of skill and advantage you've got through expensive ships/fits/implants to make up for a numerical disparity, and brainlessly throwing your gang/fleet's ships into an unassailable grinder.
---
Well dreads counter carriers hard
---
Imagine if a 150 man nano gang was 30 nanos that baited a super drop then jumped in 120 dreads to wreck the supers.
---
But that’s effort
---
&gt; Good luck countering ~~a Kikimora~~ literally anything but **T1** frigates with a t1 destroyer
---
FTFY again.
---
For real? When did it ever happen as this stupid thing needs to be onlined
---
The jump-through a WH players are upset, that's the problem with umbrellas. Simplest pvp in the game, take a WH, jump in, F1. They mad.
---
Gotta get those whales staying logged in to break out the credit card.
---
lol is this a progodlegend alt account?
---
honestly if they change asset safety ill rage  and unsub... sick of the fucking snowflakes ruining everything
---
Cheaper than market sometimes. 
---
^if ^you ^can ^read
---
This so much. Massively annoying especially when you live in j space and wouldn’t normally have 5-6 spare structures just to have clones.
---
Why limit the number of clones? Nothing in lore supports a limit. Just make the module expensive and use fuel and have the same cool down as normal... all I want is more slots!
---
Trouble is CCP just keeps cranking up the sign that says "YOU MUST BE THIS TALL TO ENTER NULSEC"  and currently that sign is at 1.9 m.
---
Just curious are they hard to kill? Yeetted out of them earlier today when I saw them the first time?
---
He wants a ingame option to "report person for real money trading" like there used to be a "report isk seller" option
---
&gt;What I have proposed is that capital ships are no longer the fastest and simplest answer to anyone you don’t like in sov null. Instead, they would respond a little slower, and if they want to catch a half smart fleet they’ll need their own subcap and bubble support.
---
and why is that?
---
Doubt. Ive seen a massive influx of old players Ive known for years. My old corp is revived and thriving, with old guys and new players showing up daily. 
---
Its nobody's fault that you (and many others) cant get behind the changes. But even as CCP has said "adapt or fuck off". 
---
Also to answer your question, In 2015? Hell no. Now? of course.
---
Half supercarrier EHP
---
Sorry that the game feels broken for you, feels pretty bants for me
---
Upvote so much

I've been hunting them in a RLML Prophecy. Painter, web and nos look to keep aggro off the drones as well as their primary purpose. Hammerheads seem to work better than Valkyries. Salvage drones to clean up after. Fit could use some tweaking

How do I start this? Any kind of story arcs or breadcrumb mission series, I'm all about it. Left to my own devices, I meander and generally don't accomplish much if I'm new to a game.
---
Two words: CROP ROTATION.  
---
eg: This month ratters are in Delve, mining fleet is in Querious and Period Basis is fallow.  Next month everybody rotates regions clockwise.
---
Yep. I especially love seeing the dead rat fit BS’s that are in the 3+ billion range.
---
Nah, they too busy fighting ISK deflation
---
But then they wouldn't be able to cry about caps being OP either
---
I usually run about 500mil-1bil tanks on my orcas.  Fully buffer fit with deadspace hardeners, I sit at 700k unheated.  Overheated I can hit 980k.  Close enough to a mil without trying.  If I wanted to go apeshit, I could probably squeak out the last few k and another 400mil on a faction dc.
---
If you are paying 700mil for the hull, and another bil for implants... why wouldn't you spend the isk to protect your investment.  Cheap out on the barges, don't cheap the logi.
---
Get rid of jump drives give insta warp.
---
*"Weren't you all about logic old friend? Tell the Rapier that's 100k off to uncloak and light our damn cyno already!"*
---
They've pandered to goon way of life for 4 years, let pendulum swing towards the middle.
---
Most people that partake in cynos will already have some extent of recons trained, just not on every character.
---
\~\~\~\~\~twist the knife\~\~\~\~
---
They they not optimal?  They don’t die, so roaming gangs ail their objective (kills/fun fights) and they kill or drive off the small gang, thus eliminating the threat.  It may not be the most *efficient* but it sure works.  And as many people on this subreddit love pointing out, “cost [efficiency] isn’t a balancing factor”.
---
Your not wrong lol
---
Talocan? More like Talo-random-chance-of-extra-loot-can!
---
how is it disrespecting them? cyno recons instead, or use something else to honour the dead...
---
3-dmqt see you there
---
i don't think there's a single high class wh brawl doctrine that doesn't use them right now(maybe sleips?), i'm not sure what you're on about
---
More like you come in with 5 destroyers and eat fucked by some drones then roll your hole
---
No local in null right now no word on if it's permanent or not. Cynos are being restricted to force recons and blops battleships. It's got people whos main isk faucet is afking in null reeing.
---
Your music is a hundred times better than some of the other dubstep or metal you see on other videos. Like you said, anything more neutral like you use is much better when you want to target the average viewer.

"After me and my boyos spent most of the day scanning we found some juicy exits, so formed a 1HP fleet to get some content 📷    We scouted a few tackled rorqus in XiX space, and jumped in to get involved on the fun. En route, we found a bigboi rorqu taking gates 📷 who swiftly had his mining permit revoked.  We landed on grid and started primarying the FAXs, carriers and finally the super that came in, which also prompted dreads to appear. All the rorquals, enemy FAXs/carriers + supers died.  Our exit hole was critted so needed to re-route via another exit. TAPI was camping the initial drifter exit  in a 120 man Muninn gang, so we tried to escape via gate. We couldn't get drag bubbles up early enough so had to engage the muninns other side. Muninns jumped in shortly after we did, and we were a little slow to anchor up. I made a small mistake here and assumed our booshers would be dead by the time  everyone was in range for a boosh so decided on engaging the muninns and seeing what we could frag...but it seems we had two or three ready, so my bad boyos 📷. We managed to frag their muninns who sucked at anchoring, but took losses here.  **All in all, 88B killed, 10.8B lost.**  Had an awesome time with y'all - the anchoring, fleet discipline and memes were great" - Chossuh, CAPF
---
I’d say 200 dps with drones clears them quite quickly. I did it with 80 drone dps and it took 10 minutes.
---
So in the end, your actual complaint is that people defend themselves. Thank you for your input.
---
Oh would have been easy kill then with t4 fitted gila.
---
&gt;4 dreks and 6 guardians on a hole isn´t PvP ;)
---
what
---
but how else would you counter the dreaded oracle/keres/sabre gang when you have 3x their numbers
---
Because flying interceptors myself and watching our other interceptor tackle ships (including vedmaks) without issue.
---
Yeah, they do a lot of damage so be careful. 30k damage with 70% omni-tank in 1:30.
---
Not in Tidi once the server starts shitting it self your in the jump tunnel for 15-20 minutes
---
basically this\^\^
---
I'm fairly sure I could kill 3 of them with ca. 700 dps and 44k ehp
---
XiX will just buy capitals from tapi if they run out
---
Your other problem is feeling entitled about it.
---
This happened in SWG too, many people returned only for them to leave soon after, and Eve is a far more interlinked game that SWG ever was.
---
Diamond rats are pretty scary tbh, Corp mate of mine came in a ded/PvP loki to help clear them of one of our cits. The moment he landed he literally got popped. We only had 3 of the Angel BBs left
---
Edit: spelling
---
Damn, Looks great
---
It makes AFKing my money alt more difficult, but I've gotten some decent PI started, so...
---
Well let's be fair here. They were never going to be able to prevent people from multiboxing really. They could have prevented people from running multiple clients on one machine. Or they could have locked connections to one per IP. Both these things would have been terribad and useless. 
---
So instead they embraced it and tried to make money with it. So Killah is kinda right, the balance team did nothing and the finance team was happy with the extra subs (cyno is an omega skill after all).
---
Join goons, evac your stuff, then leave goons. Or you could just firesale your things. Up to you
---
Omg are you really this uniformed or are you trolling?
---
Maybe you should get gud and use cyno inhibitor. Or just stay out of the junp range
---
Man r/Eve is so cringe...no one understands the question....
---
Courier contract your stuff to HS or a NPC station, don’t wait and pay for asset safety, if you can sell off some high volume stuff that will make the courier cheaper.
---
I think they are also creators of The Labrynth a dead space pocket in Amarr High sec with a networked maze of connecting acceleration gates and a bunch of pirates at the centre.
---
&gt; The game is more fun if people spend 8 hours a day grinding dailies.
---
- blizzard devs probably
---
okay damn, I was hoping to hear that a deal could be made or a bribe or somehting lol
---
Fuck local, good luck doing hi-end exploration without cloak, you can’t do PI as alpha.
---
Does hisec actually have a coherent set of interests? It's really too diverse for any suitable form of representation
---
Fit a solo VNI just like a Vexor
---
. Anci+medium rep,DCU,EANM or two, Hybrid/Drone Damage mods, Cap booster,scram/web, blasters and a small-medium neut if fitting allows. Nano pump,Nano accelerator, Explo pump for rigs.
---
Cyno needs the nerf they're getting.
---
You’re being a bit hard headed here, not having read what I wrote apparently. I had suggested that if your caps were to land off grid they would also get a gate cloak, meaning they couldn’t be probed until they began aligning. 
---
Regarding bumping, I’ve just said that if you aren’t cyno’d onto a combat grid then bumping can be fixed. The reason your silly ass capital ships bump to begin with is that you all insist on jumping 50 of them to one cyno AND they all have to land in a 10x10km bubble around the cyno. Since you’re NOT immediately in combat anymore the fleet could then be spread out to reduce bumping.
---
Regarding stop bubbles, they would have to figure out which direction (random) you were coming from, which they cannot begin to do until your gate cloak goes away. Then they’ve got to burn or MJG their stop bubbles to the proper range and alignment before your caps align and hit warp. Not as fast as it sounds.
---
Thats a no for me dawg
---
As a nullbear, I hope you all die.
---
never trust a goon =) the best way to approach it is simply join one of the many feeeder corps of goons, they have very little requirements unless there is anything 'shady' about you.
---
No, the point is effort for defending is far far less vs effort for attacking i.e. generating content.
---
Well, the solution I’ve proposed in short is that instead of restricting cynos to recons and blops, we have the current mechanics back to start. Then any fleet that jumps to a cyno no longer lands on the same grid. They’ll land a short distance away on their own grid, not immediately in combat.
---
One thing that we're missing here is that we were too busy multi/tripple boxing. Good fight though!
---
A-NI is recruiting.
---
Actually corms do really well, I imagine arty Thrashers trade exceptionally well too
---
yes hello id like to board this "fuck local" train as well
---
&gt;Ofc you hide these from the playerbase via login events but you eventually have to fix it.
---
\&gt; CCP explicitly states they are removing the effects of the login events from their DAU/MAU data in order to get accurate results
---
\&gt; r/EVE spergs bitch about how CCP is just using the login events to bolster their DAU/MAU numbers
---
*sigh*
---
You can also jump through with an aggression timer and has a radius of 1.5 a regional gate. Try bubbling a jumpgate and cry as every single ship spawns outside your dictors bubble range, or aggros at 0 and then just jumps through
---
That's because of the capital targets they are going after, fleet vs fleet triglavian ships suck against most conventional fleets
---
Fucking wolf rayets
---
Welcome mate! All aboard!
---
Remove frigates.  
---
Remove destroyers.  
---
Remove cruisers.
---
&gt;won't the new mining/ratting meta simply be to wait until the response fleet is ready and light a covert cyno (alt) off-grid/D?
---
Exactly.
---
Thanks to the cyno changes, defenders actually have to be ready to exploit a limited window when they can drop assistance from a long range, rather than having a literally invincible cyno platform give them a minimum of five minutes to form and make ready. Rather than lighting a cyno and waiting for the cavalry to arrive, you instead need to form the cavalry and *then* cyno them in.
---
Thanks to the upcoming change, cynos are less of a defensive weapon and more of an offensive weapon, as they really should have been from the get-go.
---
I agree. I hope the days of a T1 frig teleporting 20 caps on top of people is over for good. It just doesn't make sense.
---
&gt; It is a bit of an inconvenience to drag an alt along but cloaking it in a safe spot in system should only lead to an extra minute or two for a responding fleet to jump in and then warp to the tackled miner/ratter. 
---
But why would you have a recon alt, when you could instead have another rorqual alt :D
---
Hi. I'm Revere, Gormswag logistics director and alarming mascot. You've probably heard of me, I'm kind of a big deal. I identify as a Federation Navy Comet and I know Materall and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
---
How does this help you? Logistics, my friend. I'm the logistics guy, that's what they call me. "Look at that guy doing all that logistics" is the kind of thing that is literally said about me some of the times. I can put all of your things into a big ship and logistic it all to anywhere. You can trust me, I know Materall. I'll do it all for free because I love me some logistics, just moving things here and there. Love it. Ask Materall.
---
Send your things to OhRevere and I'll even submit a delicious invoice because that's what I do. Invoicing and logistics and space business. See you soon, space friend.
---
What is it with kendarr and nightmares?
---
Attackers will just warp off once someone shows up on grid and go back in their hole like they already do, then rage roll to the next place. Easy mode.
---
Only on the weekends....
---
nah man fuck spending what, 3 bil on a orca? t2 invulns, faction extenders c type em ward, CDFE II's and training pod. Thats abt it. You mine w the barges so get covs or hulks. My invesment is sealed cause its insuranced and still has massive ehp, the more i put in the less it actually helps cause its nullsec, eventually 50 bombers will blap me im not gonna go w a deadspace invuln orca thats idiotic imo
---
Cynos show up on the map. &gt;100 cynos in one system colors the entire map blue in the cyno map mode and let's everyone in EVE know you are remembering someone.
---
For a small fee I will help you evac your stuff.
---
Obviously null risk is different.   But if you aren't under a cap umbrella I'm not sure I'd pull one out.  A rorq would be a better investment for both security and ehp.
---
No, still waiting 🖖
---
I haven't told my browser to reject cookies or throw them out.

I've never been interested in being a part of a large war. Those fights end up being a lot more susceptible to n+1 being the deciding factor. On the other hand if you're roaming and looking for organic fights it's unpredictable, it's exciting. If these changes increase the ability to pick a fight in null sec that isn't "we're being entosis'd!" I think stagnation will be the opposite of what happens. I think people who aren't in large null blocs have been looking for a more reliable way to enjoy pvp without having to hop in a doctrine ship, anchor up and press f1.

I'll buy it all for 8% of jita buy value

If I'm in an 8 man gang, I'd happily welcome 100 nerds in subcaps instead of the cap dropping shenanigans that happens constantly. It's just so easy to light that cyno! Fuck even 100 people in subcaps (depending on fit) can be manageable if you pilot well. With caps its "fights over" and the people that drop caps know this. They just want to rat and mine in peace and love the ability to say "ok go home, my super is on grid now" it's the ultimate middle finger to small gangers. I have the most respect for people who always take a fight outnumbered in hostile space.

10.01% and a mining permit.
---
*points at alliance flair*
---
I've flown with a lot of people's first fleets because of the nature of my corp. It's usually like that.
---
just send the isk, you don't need a reason CCP doesn't enforce RMT 99.999% of the time anyway
---
The best in my opinion. Weekly blog updates with multiple topics in each post, active on community forums, and feeding back game changes to support the community's needs (e.g. modding), testing changes and listening to feedback, hosting events, and even though it's a technical aspect, removing bugs as they appear with great prejudice makes a very supportive community that trusts the devs.
---
There is one area that CCP exceeds the factorio devs however; lore.
---
That's what happened to me just now, had my first FC experience leading jackdaws and an enemy fleet of 20 assault frigs booshed on top of us. Lessons learnt.
---
Don't worry though, they'll keep an eye on how that affects the use of bombers and make changes if necessary.
---
...
---
Three years later: "yeah, we know bombers are in a bad place and might have gone too far on nerfing them, but we'll get to them maybe some time after we make a balance pass on all the citadels."
---
you only need 1 frigate to kill any ship if said ship is just afk and it would take less than 23 hours, that's why you shouldn't balance with the lowest common denominator in mind
---
Not to mention what you call "running" could actually be called splitting the blob or kiting. You purposefully try to get part of a gang to engage you, then you jump through a gate so the 20 people you want to engage is more manageable. Also warping around in space separates the fast and slow members of the fleet. That way you have a chance to pull range upon landing on a new grid when you suspect 100 other nerds might be chasing you. I love fighting outnumbered, but you're incorrect to attribute regrouping and small gang tactics to "running away"
---
Yes it can definitely be worth it but an Astero wouldn’t handle most of them. It’s made for exploration not combat
---
Infinite covert ops ships dropping on a finite and rapidly dwindling amount of targets will cause a change soon enough. I'll be waiting, memes primed and ready.
---
That is a very fair argument sir, no I suppose they dont.
---
Wel lI just cant imagine one and until I see it I can only go off what I know so far.
---
This sounds like a pvp player crying about removing some risks to their decloak and get kill operation. Prove me wrong.
---
They dont die anywhere near enough and even in the GS battles it was a handfull that died for fucks sake.  Wayy more should be dying on both sides in those kinds of clashes.
---
You're sincerely part of the problem if you can't see why a single module and ship class appears on grid and it's "fites over". Pandemic horde started a program that if their members defend ratters and miners and get kills in defense of those ratters/miners, they get an isk reward for securing their space. There's a reason PH is known for good fights. They bring subcaps, they kill shit and they get killed. Win some, lose some and it's always fun. (PH members, do gobloons still exist?)
---
If you have a few raven pilots, you can clear c5/c6 gas sites pretty easily, and those are extremely good isk.
---
I agree with you on these points but I also believe that supers even with these changes would still need an ehp nerf.
---
I have never tried one myself, but from what I’ve heard is that you will just get alpha’d through. You should try a stratios or a t3 cruiser
---
It's a force multiplier, helping other ships mine better.
---
Why were your supers close enough to bump in the first place?
---
Are you saying you’d rather have cynos restricted to just recons and blops then?
---
I can help you extract your stuff ;)
---
up to 3/10 DED sites easy. 4/10s require a bit of bling. C1 sites require a lot of bling and are touch and go even then. C2 and up sites are a no go.
---
Keep dreads. They are the least overpowered. Mostly because their drawbacks actually mean they have to commit to the fight once they engage. And they can't dictate anything. 
---
We don't want to shoot sov stuff with subcaps.
---
\^that is a scam\^
---
Never send things to people.
---
Kiki vs vedmak yes you are right kiki vs drek? na man drek can push like 1100 without trying hard while kikis do like 700ish?
---
the guristas fob only warp to save the hauler.
---
The hauler only warp to the fob and to ore belts. So unless your poco was on grid with a belt, and there was a hauler in that belts, there is no way the diamond rats would have pointed you.
---
Diamonds patrols don't point.
---
The new VNI is not going to be good for fleets. It’s damage is split between slow heavy drones and medium hybrids, meaning it will be much worse than a ferox at range, and it’s rare that you can get a cruiser fleet into blaster range against another fleet.
---
TINFOIL HAT !!!!
---
Enjoyed the video, very nice
---
Two corpies of mine had to file tickets because they were pushing billions between each other in a relatively short amount of time and temp banned for this.
---
So mining bad but ratting good?
---
It will be significantly more difficult for larger groups to respond to these threats. That much you cannot deny
---
Thx mate o7
---
I personally think the problem is the ease at which 254 capital ships can instantly teleport to the exact location needed _in order to defend themselves_.
---
I remember being in PH landing at 0 on an orthrus as a hyperspatial griffin with caldari jams (before ecm changes). We got lots of orthrus/garmurs in PH space so I made a test fit to see if I could scram and jam them and it worked. I was so proud of myself. People meme about PH but I think the fact that they encourage undocking and doing shit speaks volumes to their play style and how much fun you can have making your own fits and seeing what works and what doesn't. They're an awesome group for impromptu fights.
---
That one’s actually the Takmahl - another one of the “ancient races”, but in name only, since they actually had split off from the Amarr at a time far more recently than the other COSMOS factions were active
---
You gravely overestimate any impact this has on large groups simply because of the sheer amount of people that can  fill for anything needed. Hell we had vendettas babysitting rorquals to remove NPCs back in the day.
---
Sure, in off TZ or for system when people are too retarded to wait for friend, it will have an impact, but guess what : these pilots are already dying. Look at goons, they lose supers and rorquals everyday since WWB or so, but they have the safest krab haven there exist : idiots and careless people will always die at some point.
---
Is the change making ratting more dangerous ? Sure. Has it that big of an impact on the 3-4 biggest entities in Eve ? Not as much as people like to think. it has no financial impact : what's even 1000 Recon losses a month when you rat for 13T and mine for 15T like delve ? And they won't lose 1000 of them. The needed players impact ? You mean logging in one more, already existing account, per 100 pilots to cover your krabs ? A drop in the ocean.
---
If this change was targeted to super umbrellas response, it is failing by a longshot. If it was targeting random supers drops on small gangs, it's better but still retarded, because for one eve shouldn't be balanced around that, and second : good luck bringing caps on a contested field at higher levels.

My corp uses the Porpoise in wormhole space as a booster for gas-huffers. It's also useful for ice-mining boosting in w-space, since it can fit through frigate holes.
---
If we're talking about unsafe mining situations, I'd think about what kind of threats you're trying to escape from. Among mining ships, only the Procurer and the mining frigates have any kind of decent anti-gank capability for their cost. The mining frigates are pretty good at escaping, and a Procurer can be fit to tank through or fight off some gankers... but keep in mind that safety should be weighed in as part of your isk/hr calculation. If I lose half my mining power in order to survive ganks 50% more often, that may not actually be an improvement.
---
I wish they would give me a deal like that so I could resub to this trash ass game
---
Sadly, yes, but that is a woe of sandbox pvp in any game
---
Really appreciate the comment, really makes it worthwhile to keep making these videos.
