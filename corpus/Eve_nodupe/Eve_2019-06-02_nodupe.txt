Can an alpha VNI rat? I‚Äôve got most of my relevant skills up to the alpha cap, but I my tank still breaks. Could it be an issue with the type of space I‚Äôm in (guristas)?

We won and defended our fortizar. FRT was unable to attack us + we reffed their cyno jummer. They were sitting on undock for 2h and waiting for help.

Seems most people have the same idea as I. Just to clarify a few reasons why the Damavik is bad:
---
1. Not enough range to kite. It can‚Äôt utilise it‚Äôs good speed in a kiting fit because of range issues AND if you mess up and drift slightly out of range (pretty much always) you lose your ramp.
---
2. Not enough tank to go toe to toe with the big boys in a brawl. You will lose to pretty much any AF brawler because of ADC and the high end frigs (Worm, Daredevil, Comet) will likely beat you as well.
---
3. The gun is retardedly expensive. You‚Äôre dropping 60mil just for a t2 gun on top of the hull cost for a ship that‚Äôs worse than other pirate frigs.
---
4. It has ‚Äúdead slots‚Äù - the 2 utility highs are very very hard to fit, and even if you manage to use them somehow, you give up so much that it‚Äôs rarely worth. You‚Äôre essentially working with a constant handicap.
---
5. The ramp mechanic sucks in frigate 1 v 1s due to them being so short. Damaviks can ramp to 500 in a decent fit but most solid frig brawlers will hit 300 right out the gate putting you at a huge disadvantage initially.
---
TL;DR
---
Damavik sucks, buy a Kiki
---
Ok dude.
---
Rekking Crew. It's what the group of alliances hostile to Provi-Bloc living in and around Providence call themselves. Includes alliances like Honorable Third Party and Rogue Consortium.
---
If you can, record fights. 
---
It helps a lot to identify mistakes that were made afterwards and can increase the pace you learn. And you can show it to others if you don't understand what was going on at some point.
---
Yea, you just sound like a douchebag in the process though. Just GF in local and move on.
---
NPSI
---
welcome to reddit, where the majority can be wrong
---
Provi isnt easy picking for us, but a challenge, a super needed one at that if NPSI is going to leap forward into the new meta of eve life. It's our turn to catch up a little.
---
I've been craving pews without the hassle of constant login, I kind of hope I can come back in a small way and this would be a good way I think.
---
Provi hasnt been able to "blob" since i was the head fc back in the brave war days ;)
---
We are working with any entity that wishes to have content created in provi.
---
The Damavik proves again no matter how strong other things are, a 3M 3L ship can never be good
---
You really should look into provi it‚Äôs next to a great hosed system dital. And close to a trade hub both very important things for new players. Also in provi you will get good small gang fights and with three players you will always have a force large enough to defend space. Also the NRDS rules make it so there is a reason to be there you are a good guy who is protecting other players who can follow the rules from those that cannot. It is very lively space and will give you a purpose to log in. Also this section of space has some of the best FCs in all of eve. They fight against crazy odds every night and usually come out on top.
---
Its a content war, so yes. Provi are cockroaches who gorrila warfare their space back...  
---
equi :shrugs: If any other entity wishes to keep the sov, so be it.
---
I and 3 of my Corp mates you‚Äôve included in your BR. We ganked a lone wolf. No idea what your screeching about but long story short gf to your wolf
---
Solid advice. OP take note
---
Spectre fleet took a harb fleet with a junior fc. The isk war isnt looking that great fro provi either. I would of loved to see how they would fight against real comps of munnins or eagles :)
---
Your 100% right, but its fun to word things this way. I for one think its a great post and gives provi the none serious meme we intended. I really hope provi embrace the content and have fun with us!
---
Perhaps. But then, they are the ones that started throwing propaganda around on reddit. Can't really blame me for firing back.
---
Thank you for the in depth response. Hurts to hear that after dropping so much to kit one though...
---
Burn and farm. We wanna show new people how those mechanics work.
---
Thanks for all the answers. Shame to hear such a nice looking ship is so "Meh" in even it's best situation...
---
Must suck to DC
---
Do Drones V, rest to IV, and eventually get light, medium and heavy V (in that order) so you can fly T2 drones, as finding faction replacements all the time is a huge PITA
---
If you were half way decent at flying hacs that BR is a poor reflection on provi and not on a t1 BC fleet :'D Lets play in hacs and you can fight me :) 90 hacs would of wrecked provi today.. so roll your nose in. I also want to point out the junior FC's did a great job under pressure. You guys were not smiling as much when i took over though ;)
---
It evolves to a new thing
---
Can't really be helped. NPSI fleets are full of random people from all over the place so it's impossible to filter out things like that.
---
Been at war with RC in providence for a year now. Our NRDS ROE is something we hold with great honor. It gives anyone a chance to experience 0.0 in a relatively safe environment. And yes this is most likely propaganda because they just lost one of their biggest allies in the region to fight against us.
---
Hmm i might come back to the game if were invading Provi sounds like fun fun , Ive read some of the replys pure salty Goodness
---
It is exactly what it is, at face value :'D you guys are so used to being fed a false narrative by your overlords &lt;/3
---
A BPC of Kiki is worth the most of all five T1 Triglavian ships 
---
And that is with a reason
---
Whatever, dude. Keep on being wrong.
---
I've seen better memes from 3 year olds
---
if you're not trolling, please consider education
---
Copied an almost identical layout and have been using it for years
---
Na we let those nerd off.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
He's talking about "nano gang" pvp style. 
---
Basically a relatively small group of ships that are very fast and can dictate the range to your enemy. Usually, they also hit well at range. (Chessur's videos show this style to pvp a lot, his YT-channel was linked already)
---
"Nano" refers to the low slot module that increases your agility and speed, but reduces your hull-hp. If you fit this, you trade speed for effective hitpoints.
---
The long-range Webs from a Hyena help you to slow down and kill tackle that would burn in an catch one of your gang while a Bifrost giving skirmish links to the gang will add speed and increase range of e-war. 
---
Usually, every ship in such a gang has a specific role it is fitted for and naturally good at. Every pilot has to know what his purpose is and how to use his ship the right way, they don't "anchor up", they fly their own ships individually.
---
The purpose for such fleets is rather to generate killmails, then to go for an objective like a structure or to "hold grid". That would need another, usually beefier type of fleet that can also take a punch or two.
---
You guys and the Kool Aid. As if equi isn't on his hands and knees making slurping sounds every time the bogey man comes looking for content.
---
You know what I miss? Corp ads in station. Whatever happened to those?
---
Yeah, firing laser at t2 minmatar resist...
---
Goes as expected
---
There is a difference between good spirited and fun propaganda and basically saying "good job welping a fleet, if you keep being this dumb then keep coming we like free killmails". That's not even propaganda, that's just douchebaggery.
---
&gt; prey apon
---
Ok
---
That would be interesting!
---
I leave a little errors or standouts, I should probably just make them perfect next time.
---
I've spent evictions assembling and equipping ships (both in a POS and in a citadel for different evictions). It's not at the top of my priority list, but it's a thing I've thought about for sure.
---
Got footage for another money money video stealing loot off people. It's not the best ISK but it's pretty ridiculous tbh. My favourite one is spending half an hour stealing every single ISK off 2 clearly quite expensive Vargurs in a 3m Destroyer without there being anything they can do about it.
---
I mean he's not wrong...
---
&gt; Spectre+RC fleet is badly outplayed by the Muninn fleet.
---
it surely was the l33t skill of provi and not the fact that they're using munnins against ab gilas and harbs lmao
---
*pry apron
---
IIRC it was quietly changed a very long time ago, I think before 2013
---
I know it's unlikely to have any meaningful response, but
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
No, it's my stuff and I like it, you can have that guys stuff, he might be selling it seeing as he apparently bought all the Drone fluid on the Dodixie market at nearly 10x market price by mistake.
---
trit is 5.06 ? wtf
---
Yeah happy bday
---
Felt like killing something tonight. No kitchen sink nano EBWF fleet on.  No BB to learn to hunt in a Tengu.  But Spectre have a Harb fleet heading out of Amarr.  *This could be fun ...*
---
Check out the doctrine fits, realise I only have Amarr Battlecruiser III, would feel dirty flying a Harb with BC at only three.  4 days training for IV.  Look at injecting ... *nah, not spending 223k SP on that.*
---
Keep scrolling and see Logi.  Don‚Äôt feel like flying Logi.
---
Scroll some more and find the Huginn fit. It‚Äôs been 9 years since I last flew a Recon.  I miss Recons.  Only 450m for the fit.  Not bad.  Need to inject Recon V, though.  Meh, it‚Äôs worth it.  1.5m SP injected.  Ship bought.  Fly down to Amarr.
---
Form up turns out to be Mista.  Dock up, notice I have a Panther here.  Hop in it ... *oh, a fancier web! Let‚Äôs put this on.*
---
We start heading into Proidence.  Frag a few interdictors.  I like this ship.
---
Get to the gate beyond which the fight is waiting for us.  Jump.  Anchor up.  Point and web some frigates.  Yay!
---
Links go off, check my web, 91km with heat?  Sweet!
---
Call goes out from FC to web their anchor, a Tengu.  It‚Äôs 97km away. 100km. 113km.  107km.  98km.  Getting close.  95km.  *Start to hover over F1.*. 90km!  Get hard.  F1.  Get harder.  Watch their fleet start to pile up.  Oh shit they‚Äôre totally going to shoot me now.
---
Overheat hardeners in anticipation of impending doom.  Broadcast for reps as yellow boxes start to appear.  Realise only two friendly Logi have me prelocked.  Watch my shield and armour and hull drop off a cliff.  Fuck.
---
Die, watch the battle a little longer, pod myself back to HS, fly over to Jita, fit up a Vedmak and head off to Thera.
---
10/10 would definitely get baited by memories of my glory days flying Recons in ‚Äò09/10 again.
---
there was a small batch for 5.06 in jita, its gone now , up to 5.16
---
True, I just thought it hilarious that Redline was on the wrong side since he is one of the three leaders of this "invasion"
---
Hah, no. We aren't l33t, nor do we want to be.
---
Arguably Spectre outplayed themselves tonight. Anybody who's done their homework on Provi should have predicted this is what we would have brought to this kind of engagement. If they are indeed planing to wage war on us, they should probably know this stuff.
---
Bet you are kicking yourself now that you didnt wait for the Samsung CRG9

---
It's called balance. Balance allows for a healthy pvp/pve ecosystem in the game.
---
If you want to kill 8b ships with a 5 minute siege timer, youll need to control grid for 7 minutes.
---
Its not that much to ask for how expensive the ship is.
---
So are you happy for them to be able to stop indy mode at any point in time? No? Cause if they are forced to stay with their pants down for 5 minutes probably you can at least give them a little bit of time to call friends when things get hot...
---
Very true. The bad thing about this is it wasn't an FC. Someone said something on comms. Someone was trying to be helpful and broadcast it out. Some of them did said broadcast. Oh well.
---
I thought redline is NC FC now? Is he splitting his time or leaving NC for this crusade instead?
---
Yeah salvaging behind supers is legit af.
---
Easily get 60m/hr+ with a salvage catalyst/algos.
---

He's a C-level in a Fortune50 company.
---
Those who have to unironically ask who Aryth is on r/eve are wholly irrelevant.
---
It says a lot when you don't even know who or what RC actually is.
---
Real Talk:
---
We fought your ~100 man fleet with our ~30 man fleet, managed to frag some logi and get out, losing about 30% of our fleet including links/tackle in the process.
---
10-15mins later, Spectre came in and we re-entered the grid to third party with what we had left. Got DPS primed by provi and our logi wing damped to shit by the spectre fleet... so we left.
---
If you're going to spin at least sound like you know what's going on in the world...
---
Wait NPSI still a thing? WOAH
---
I doubt he is giving his stuff away. Mistakes happen and you just laugh them off and move on. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I constantly (and by that I mean a couple times a month) buy modules worth 500m+ for anything between 2m and 90m. It is what it is. I've also bought a 160m mwd for 1.6b so that's life, you win some you lose some. Probably ccp could make it even better (they did, it is easier to spot mistakes now than it was before) but then it would remove this from the game and I kind of like it no matter on which side of it I am.
---
Npsi does üòÇ
---
Then balance the siege along with the PANIC. Shorter timer for both. Or PANIC only in Siege(Which would force them to activate it sooner).
---
Really because I always hear bitching that Provi overforms for roams
---
Yep, it made my day, got 132m more for the stuff than I was expecting. I thought it was an error at first lol
---
Had to actually log in my frat alt just to wait on undock and for FC to call for cap support. Reeeee hate this sht.
---
I'm confused. Who exactly are you expecting to buy that nonsense?
---
they announced it on twitter:

---
If you have never played, don‚Äôt start, not worth it.
---
large if accurate
---
They nerf'ed Carrier ratting... now its afk gila / vnis.
---
They nerf Rorq mining...  hope you enjoy catching procs.
---
Until they look at cyno's and local ... only big alliances need apply.
---
Then I suppose you don't need to ping about me, talk about me at your alliance meetings, or beg for my attention in local.
---
I think so!
---
Splitting time.
---
No one ever asks "How is RC?"...
---
&gt; I'm confused.
---
Pretty much my point right there...
---
NPSI fleet has a friendly fleet on the grid? Lol... this has nothing to do with NPSI.
---
If you think thats the only issue
---
Well, we don't, so there is that...
---
The battle report shows a large number of Nothern Coalition, and Pandemic Horde titans and supers vs nothing but goon subcaps.
---
How is in you consider goons as having all the advantages? Titans and supers against subcaps feels like a very big advantage to me....
---
the most recent patch has made is arguably decent... certainly in the realm of other pirate frigs right now, even if on the low side
---
the main issue now is price... for the amount of money you have to spend on even a shitty damavik, you can have a very well fit Assault Frig that is generally better
---
Most pirate frigs have some sort of specialty, the Dama technically has one, but it's mostly useless and impractical, which is that it's good in a tiny little ball with other damas who can remote rep each other
---
but that requires 3 or 4 other dudes, and if you have 3 or 4 other dudes there's like a million better things you can do with that many hands and half a billion (or more) isk
---
I started doing pvp in a Rifter, this guy started in a Rorq, they must have changed the tutorial.
---
Would be good if we could hold funerals for our old bodies and turn them into something useful... say biomass or something in order to create fertilizer, and then have that be used in PI or have it be required for some blueprint... atm corpses feel like useless loot if the person isn‚Äôt willing to pay sentimentally to get it back, so having that option to use it if they don‚Äôt want it seems like a good idea.
---
I mean, these are the people that just a few hours before made a propaganda effort post about invading Provi. They kinda had it coming.
---
Imagine smug posting as Provi bloc
---
Damavik sucks. Kikimora quit good. Vedmak so so. Drekavac godlike. Lehshak god of gods. Nergal tanky. Draugar too expensive. Ikitursa too expensive.
---
I like delivering them to people at structures they can't dock at.
---
NPSI fleet that has friendly fleet on the grid... lol...

Didn‚Äôt they just nerf panic? Crying over a response fleet saving offenseless things is like sticking a fork in the toaster and expecting nothing to happen.  If I tackle a rorq it‚Äôs for content. Idc what comes and I‚Äôll rush to the defense of them. Content is content and brings me back to eve. Shooting a fish in a barrel is boring. Enjoy the thrill of being shot back

Imagine declaring war on Provi... Oh wait
---
Unironic post: Don't exterminate (RL) bees, get a beekeeper to take care of them (move them into a hive) so they can help save the planet.
---
Nice in theory, but think about this; you're a pilot in a small corporation that just managed to put up your first structure. A week or two later, EvE Invasion is deployed and lo and behold the system you deployed your structure in is invaded. If Concord is disabled in-system... Your structure dies, any ship attempting to leave it dies, and ultimately the corporation dies, having lost something they spent months building with no chance to reclaim any part of what was placed in the structure. Just like with wars, you have dozens of new corporations quitting the game and EvE continues to slowly die. BTW, there are dozens of corporations less than a year old that have their only structure in an invaded system right now. Don't forget, High-sec is where new players learn the ropes, eliminate it and just troll new players until they quit and you ultimately kill the game
---
Stainguy pls

"shreeks" leave provi alone...

Something something dead horse
---
Try Sask. Alberta has lots to do.
---
Wanted to say: Changelog ep. on TIS was really great, thanks!
---
It pretty much is panic only in siege at the moment. Bombers usually carry some form of ewar in their mids. Often damps or ecm. If you apply them all to a rorq he needs to Indy core to be able to lock a rock to activate panic.
---
did redline get booted from gon or something
---
That fleetwarp looked sexy tho

I enjoy dumping them in a crate and sending them the location, and then waiting for them to show up again and get killed by me again...

EveMon is great for managing skills queues.
---
I have a blank character to create queues for distribution, so that it doesnt neglect skills already owned by my main.
---
If you already have the skills in a word document you can copy to clipboard and import into EveMon that way.
---
Once they are in EveMon you can export as a .emp skill plan file for distribution, or copy to clipboard and import into game either way.
---
When I first started eve I used to just shoot whatever wrecks the ninja salvager was going for.   Eventually they always pissed off.  You do lose some salvage/loot obviously, but you get the satisfaction of denying them.
---
Why are you so obsessed with me?
---
10m for a year contract to shadow adolf. 50b needs to be in reprocessed T2 trig guns
---
Give them back?! Are you insane!?  
---
I have a body collection.  A station container named Body Dump.  I sometimes take duplicate bodies in my cargo out on roams or just to warm them up some from the heat of the engines.  Sometimes I offer one to Bob at the sun.  Never give them back.
---
What kind of stuff is deleted? Do you have any links?
---
Genuinely interested btw
---
As someone who tried to do even weekly coverage of the political events, it‚Äôs not just the workload - It‚Äôs the community feedback. People do not appreciate good news when they have it, they only see the flaws within it.
---
Killing rats is something you can do anywhere. So why do it there where someone else steals what little reward there is when you can do it literally anywhere else and not have that happen?
---
Locator agents.  On the agency window you can search for them like mining and security agents.  The higher your standing with them the cheaper and quicker they email you the ‚Äúscumbag‚Äôs‚Äù current system.  
---
There is at least one channel in Eve that has people sometimes willing to run them for you.  It‚Äôs Locates Are Us iirc.
---
Everyone kinda needs a reason to push past the major learning curve of Eve.  Mine was revenge.
---
To me it seems like the easy solution would be to make PANIC not save other rorquals. But then again I'm just some FW scrub that doesn't know shit about rorqs.

youre trying to hard...

Please stop posting and crawl back under your rock

I saw a guy in jita advertising his a contract for his "cask of the dead, 666 corpses" one time. I liked the idea very much.
---
Remember that most everyone in here is looking at it from a frigate 1v1 solo situation. The Damavik is not designed for this so consider this when looking for uses for it.
---
Look up for fits in zkillboard for inspiration.
---
Expect to be focused if doing small fleet stuff, your killmail in that is worth quite a bit more than most destroyer sized ships.
---
We were all Tadpoles at some point, but with enough time you can become a frog just like the rest of us in the pond.

Yes, an alpha can VNI rat. You will need faction drones and some extra fitting to compensate for the poorer capacitor skills at cap (although that is true for new Omega characters too).  
---
Not sure what your tank is, but if you stack Kinetic high and get a good amount of shield hp and regen in there, you should be fine. If you're having trouble tanking forsaken hubs, that may be because Mortifiers shoot you with thermal light missiles--Havens do not contain Mortifiers and may be better if there are no carriers in system which need Havens.

Yes to all questions and statements.

No.

I believe it's rather that the trigs haven't shot a structure enough for a full shield timer / armor timer / hull timer cycle in HS. HS citadels have more days of delay than in any other space.

It's probably not how CCP is deciding who's winning.

Make she you are going to C1-C3 WHs "Unknown" not Dangerous Unknown, or Deadly Unknown.  Then go to the pirate sites.

That's right. Optimal is full effect, and it ramps down--and falloff is the 50% mark. For jams the attribute that fades is the jam strength points per jam.

EvE is full of evil people.
---
Definitely! EVE is an ever-growing, ever-complicating game. It's super fun even for new players. Honestly, most of the fleets I'm on I fly ships that are super easy to skill into. It's honestly about what you want to do. Feel free to just make an account and try out the tutorial! It only takes a few hours and is very informative.
---
Put a Emission Scope Sharpener and Gravity Capacitor rigs on for improved scanning and relic hacking.
---
Survivorship Bias in reverse?
---
Frigates are honestly a great way to learn solo or gang PVP and won't run you over 10m each for T1s (which are really enough). Fight over and over with the same ship, learn from your mistakes but don't overfit for specific experiences. Frigates, especially kiters, are the best platform to learn to position well and gaining grid awareness.
---
If you prefer something meatier, cruisers are the answer. Cruisers will run you at most 30m each and will last longer, and are the balanced middle class. They hit harder, last a little longer, in exchange for being slower (but usually still fast enough that you can move around grid well).
---
If you have gang or fleet content, a great way to start is in an EWAR frig. Join your corps' fleets or join NPSI groups like Spectre Fleet and hop in a cheap EWAR frig (crucifier, maulus, griffin, vigil). The strategy in an ewar frig is very simple--fly the fuck away from everything and touch people in ways they don't like to be touched. It's a great role for getting an overall view of fights and how they work, and learning about different ships.
---
The fleet must check that the FC hasnt gone blind from our amazing situational awareness
---
I like to autoconfigure graphics to memory or performance preset, and then go into the General tab to turn transparency to minimum. If you still want things to look nice, turn shader quality 1 notch up and that's like, 90% of eve's visual candy right there.
---
Definitely possible and worth getting into Eve still IMO. I would personally recommend looking into some of the corps focused towards new players such as Pandemic Horde, Eve University, Brave Newbies or Karma Fleet as they can be a great way to learn the basics with all the resources and support they offer to new players.
---
Nice :) I like it! :) I use 4 clients. The reason I made this OP was because a few months back I got a whole new rig/setup/screen and ive been too lazy to update my settings till today i considered that i may as well start using what I have to its fullest.

You're missing the point of my argument.
---
get back in those belts boi
---
We would do the same but it's the only way to make anything from the trig incursions atm so it's quite counter-productive.
---
let us take a moment to acknowledge that earlier a post was made about the lack of propaganda, now we have it lol
---
Most wormholes are actually dead quiet. Some HS ones near high traffic areas are camped--if you want to go wormholes from HS daytripping, fly into a quiet area of HS first and usually those aren't bothered to be camped.
---
Secondly, don't fly ships that you care so much about. It's a game with frequent explosions, don't let it get to you and don't put all your eggs in one basket.
---
Lastly, this is all relatively avoidable. Learn stuff like d-scan, how to use a cloak, check zkillboard, and you'll be much more aware of things and die less. I honestly wish I were attacked more while exploring because it can be so boring sometimes.
---
Would it be easier to speed tank a faction that didn‚Äôt use missiles?

This is gold. Spinter fleet gets destroyed twice in a row as soon as they announce they were coming to provi. The lols to be had. I cant stop laughing at them.
---
Ex-New Eden Store item; they were discontinued a few years ago at this point.
---
It's impossible to say whether they'll re-enter the game given that CCP have reintroduced discontinued stuff before.
---
\&gt;  We are working with any entity   
---
NPSI shouldn't "work" with anyone.  
---
That's why it's NPSI. If it's not in your fleet right now, you shoot at it. That's the entire premise, and why it's lasted as long as it has in Eve. You screw with that at your own peril.
---
Porpoise or Orca for the lazy. Boosted drones and big bay.
---
Retriever if you want to strip mine and click things but not move to station too much. But tank it to fuck--if you succeed, when you get ganked and survive it's pretty amusing. The mark is about 24k EHP.
---
Procurer if you dont want to shell out for a porp/orca but also never want to deal with ganks.
---
Venture if you're just starting/cheap/alpha.
---
Covetor never, unless you're with a Porpoise/Orca as your ore box and you fly super-skittishly.
---
&gt;And yes this is most likely propaganda because they just lost one of their biggest allies in the region to fight against us.
---
Oh, please do tell. I've been away from Eve, what happened?
---
if you're gonna try and change the contents of your post you can edit it, not try and spin it in a comment thread buddy
---
Wow you have bamboozled me with that logic lmao
---
Listen just an FYI though it may fall on deaf ears; living in an echo chamber means you will often only be fed a one-sided view without ever having a contrasting opinion to differentiate it from. You may wish to consider why the Imperium propaganda arm works so hard on revisionist history.
---
&gt; nc. Pl thrive on internal troll and internet spaceship bullying 
---
lmao
---
I'm in Sansha space now. They use only turrets but are, on the flip side, very short ranged and you can't aggro reliably in most sites. So there's pros and cons.
---
Guristas are also the faction whose resist is most focused (almost all Kinetic) and other than Angel they're probably the easiest faction for a shield VNI to tank.
---
Much needed post thank you fellow gamer
---
What's a cullender?
---
I was mostly curious about low power stuff as it only has two timers at best.
---
 So thanks capitan obvious :P but I hope they do start to kill structures. Everyone and their brother has a hs station, Would be nice to see defence fleets form for them. The pirate bases atk structures but they get bored to easy and buzz off before they break shields. Nvm any timers lol.
---
Altho I am curious what ccp is planning/ doing with this content.. Cuz it feels to close to incursions for me personally. I was hoping they would be fighting sansha or something amd we got to "pick" a side to some extent.. But idk.. Ccp is being.. Well ccp about it.
---
I'm curious too? Interestingly and for what it's worth the first I heard of spectre fleet as a public entity moving into the area was when we were asked to give them a staging fort in lowsec 2 or 3 days ago.
---
So, you want them to go back down to Delve, so there's no more action up north or in Delve?  
---
Yeah, great idea. Really entertaining.
---
 This war declaration is a symbol to how far NPSI has come in the recent years. A true reflection on what a bunch of dedicated and amazing bunch of guys can do. The community is what matters and in many ways we all share that sentiment with our own groups. NPSI is a way to enjoy eve onlines PvP without any obligations and this appeals to many, many people. This is very reflective of our recent but strange way to use CCPlease alliance mechanics to our advantage, in opening The Ancients. to full NPSI instead of elitist invite only NPSI of past. #ccpthanks for wardeck changes &lt;3  
---
 
---
As you can see, NPSI and not only English speaking groups can field very large fleets. Larger fleets than anyone can form bar very large alliances and coalitions. In a lot of cases it has to be coalition level to engage our prime fleets. Our pedigree FC roster in Spectre and the pedigree of other NPSI groups, often formed out of people who share the same vision of eve, is at its highest and at its best.  
---
 We also have a huge list of FC‚Äôs who are not of pedigree but wish to learn how to eve. They have no other conduit to practice but we do what we can. I would also say that a large chunk of your FC‚Äôs originated or trained here at Spectre fleet and continue to do so. To call NPSI trash is dumbfounded in that, these are your pilots! These are the very people who are in your alliances and buff up your killboards.   
---
This last 2 years have been a hard struggle to bring NPSI back into eve after its death. Uniting the public eve community such as; Streamers, EvE uni, almost all NPSI communities and the Nomadic ETC has been the forefront of our drive. ‚Äúeverything public in one place‚Äù   
---
 To bring all that content to the players that end up being some of the greatest pilots in your alliances was our dream, a dream that has been fulfilled. The unification of public NPSI/Public groups is a badge of honor I wear with pride and so should all the leadership involved!!   
---
 Our foundations are in place, they are strong. It is because of this hard work the NPSI community leaders have put in, that enables us to do these things like ‚Äúmake an NPSI alliance‚Äù ‚ÄúStart a war‚Äù ‚ÄúBuild a cap group‚Äù Please don‚Äôt be fooled about finances, The NPSI community is one of the richest there is, without a need for a central banking system.   
---
We can now adventure into the sandbox you have all created! We have brought NPSI back and this time its here to stay!  
---
My personal history is a long one and it involves every major name in this game. Providence can attest to this. My relationship with providence goes back to the day of the eye of providence uniting providence in the war against Brave and AAA. I hope my relationship with Equi is no different now as it was then. This war is not a malicious one. Its one based on content, We intend to show our members (your members) what sov warfare is about. This, we will do. It is my honor to fight providence or even be able to contemplate this type of content for NPSI. I wish provi the best of luck and hope this war brings all the appropriate trashy memes. Make no assumptions that mistakes will not be made on both sides, we hope you all can join us in this war, here is to the good fights o7  
---
Fish‚Ä¶ that is all.

Whoosh
---
I always carry Marines in mine. And if it's a longer trip I'll throw in an exotic female dancer to keep the boys email, and also a janitor...For the mess.
---
Friendly shameless plug that I still have Gorski Car's corpse.
---
This is EVE, the fact that a ship exploded is only the natural conclusion of it undocking and shouldn't mean that the fit or the pilot flying it were bad.
---
Missed a coma there.
---
Lone Wolf is CVA
---
Panic doesn't effect other rorquals....
---
So ate you angry you didn't get free kills or that you got a fight?
---
About tree fiddy I'd say as well
---
The ship has already been nerfed but what the hell.  I say shield boosters and combat drones are the problem.  Rorquals should have neither as a matter of fact let‚Äôs just take away all the fitting slots CCP can sell the mining drones thru the store for let‚Äôs say .99 a drone and we can all get easy solo kills in assault frigates.
---
had almost double the number of pilots, lost around 3x what the enemy did, and "won". Vily really needs to run for office cause holy shit he must have a silver tongue.
---
Honestly.. Just no.  They need to be reworked again WITHOUT MINING DRONES.. Panic is.. Ok. yes it has its issues but there are ways of dealing with it. There is no way the rorq will be in a balanced place with it being the king afk miner.. Best boosts, best yield, best tank, solid dps..  Like the fucking list goes on and on.. Panic is just one item on that list.. Amd I think with the recent indy core nerf and panic nerf they should be in an ok defensive state. But far FAR from balanced.. The issue isnt PANIC imho its the drones and infinite afk/scale ability of them is the true problem.
---
Hell GSM even fixed the mining drone button for the heavy spoud brains that press mine instead of mine repeatedly.
---
Mining drones are a mistake CMV lol
---
It dosent. Only you and sub caps IF your targetting a rock. So BOOOOOSHHH lol.
---
goon wanting panic nerf is LOL
---
If you operate balls deep into enemy territory and can't form a fleet.. (despite having intel about) then you are fucking not prepared. Other people put so much work into their shit to have everything ready for their well deserved kills.. if you fail to do so you don't get the kills.   
---
From the 343 rorqs I have killed in the past 2 years I would say that on at least 330 of them we had our fleet close by and ready to jump on the target within seconds. If you want to catch someone on the assend of the world and still kill them without having anything prepared I don't think you deserve it, sorry (not sorry).  
---
You know that there is people killing rorqs in delve when goons are not on deployment.. and they have been doing that even with a 7min timer in pure bomber/recon fleets? Learn from them.
---
dickholes aren't awesome, evan wasn't a dickhole (from what I saw). so yeah on his own terms, without infringing on others. how bou dah
---
I used to think the world of Matterall but after listening to this dumpster fire of an interview and him having no problems with gold ammo if you care at all for this game you won‚Äôt vote for this candidate.
---
Spectre fleets are pretty good fights for us in provi, but the instant RC is on the field and they start toasting the goal changes from having a good fight to crushing the enemy fleet. 
---
If you want to to come fight, do some offensive toasts and fight us, that's fine. But when you're teaming up with RC, well, now you're just fancy batphone for them.
---
Meh. I had fun.
---
it's free, just download it and give it a go.
---
Thanks for been there!
---
Then wtf is he whining about? And why would staggering panics be an effective strategy? Wouldn't you just force panic like you do with ADC, then come back around and finish them off? Wouldn't the first one shot take the same amount of time as if it was the only one on grid?
---
one client?  noob.
---
Can you answer the questions I asked the other guy too? Thanks.
---
&gt; My favourite one is spending half an hour stealing every single ISK off 2 clearly quite expensive Vargurs in a 3m Destroyer without there being anything they can do about it.
---
unfortunately, this is going to be the reason why nobody's going to bother running this content once the "oh look, it's new" factor wears off.
---
On the first 2 days it was a loot fest , i got some nice loot and then stopped playing when ninjas got organized .
---
No, we band together against each other.

is this a meme?

Stop complaining. I was there in a bomber shorting these Rorqs. Sometimes you kill them , sometimes they drop the hammer, don‚Äôt expect wins every time.
---
Karma fleet is a pain in the ass to get into as a new player. Say what you will about Horde‚Äôs recruitment but we‚Äôll have you accepted within a few hours, while karmafleet will make you wait a week or so.
---
Missed an m there unless you are saying the person was unconscious.
---
I can't tell if your agreeing it's a space station that can move, or disagreeing that it's a space station that can move. That's legit not sarcastic, I just can't tell
---
I'm about to click play, if this isn't the one where the proteus smartbombs a slave pod that pops out of a corm i will be disappointed.
---
I am not sure if you understand what balance means. Killing sitting ducks with ease means there would be no ducks to shoot very shortly. Good luck hunting Procurers.
---
Op is not goon.

We'll be there supporting you.  Love you @Quebber
---
What is this an incursion?!?
---
[Watch the trailer for Invasion where the Xordazh literally lights up its engines and moves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIhIMizrkWk)
---
Also, read the description for the in-game description of the Xordazh:
---
&gt;*The Xordazh-class World Ark would seem to be easily the match of any vessel known to New Eden and is presumably at least as powerful and hard to destroy as the heaviest military structures.* ***The ship*** *has been observed deploying numerous "field effect subpylons" of a variety of types as part of its defensive network. Approach with extreme caution.*
---
Can't get any more crystal clear than that. ***Ship***, not station.
---
You do you bro
---
Everyone is floating around clueless
---
I know.  It was a joke.
---
So.. who gets that payout and when? How do you track who is getting payed and how can people confirm that?
---
Do you really think goons and unspoken did a good job on that fleet? 
---
There was so much time between Sabres and dps that sub caps burnt though your bubbles and just docked up.
---
Waleing is a race against time, if you try again do not take the scenic route.
---
Sad legendary NC FC Redline needs to run NPSI Fleets just to generate content. Is NC really this dead?
---
Floating around clueless? Oh yea,  thats me after almost five years of playing. :) But still having a blast every day. You' ll be fine. Also: Welcome to the team!
---
We've seen TAPI smug about 10bn BRs.
---
have you met bombers bar or spectre fleet before? :'D
---
Debatable..  after looking it over it would be a solid option for triple boxing and spider repping but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll do well in abyss.. it gets fuck all for damage to start and takes 2 minutes at least to max ramp.. it would struggle against leshak spawns for sure. It‚Äôs theoretical max ramp damage in impressive (600+ with 1 sink) but I don‚Äôt think the feasibility is there for timed ratting like abyss
---
I asume you are from the US? In that case, i say CHEERS to you! ;) And goodbye to your liver. 
---
Btw. Iam from good, old germay. You can have your first ' legal beer ' at the age of 16. ;) Shots at 18. Its the law.
---
You can't always wait for the next thing üòä Hard to kick oneself for having something this awesome, even if there is something more awesome out there.
---
We use a Operation Tracker on our website. Just register for the fleet and fcs confirm at the end who came. 1 fleet = one share. Pay out is done weekly. All funds are kept in a holding Corp that all the FCs have access to view so people know where the money is flowing.
---
Although website is down atm so we are keeping track manually
---
Sorry, you are?..... who?
---
:(
---
I collect them in stations and leave the container when I move so I have a memorial of my time in that system.
---
What abusing stupid mechanics to talk shit while ganking noobs? Classiest of class :P
---
The other responder is absolutely correct. Nobody wants to be the alt corp. That said, many corps are fine with you having an alt corp on the side for making some isk. Essentially, if you rename your "main" to be your "alt", and rename your "pvp alt" to be your "main", you may find corps are much more fine with this.
---
Good point.
---
Yeah I'm from the US lol. Thanks man means a lot. Germany is wild from what I hear, tons of bars!
---
To be fair I would never say no to a dread fight one mid away since I hear low sec is dead.
---
OP is a scammer. No way that loot gets broken up evenly. The loot tracker just happens to be "down". This event is very profitable atm. Be careful who you fleet up with.
---
Have you even flown with us?
---
White Stars look really nice.
---
Also not disappointed
---
Corpses belong in the corpse bays of Blood Raider capitals.
---
That's just clever
---
which park ?? ill bring the bucky!
---
Extracting implants sounds cool
---
Probably would make buying implants less of an isk sink though. We do not need fewer isk sinks lol
---
CCP likes to do a lot of "almost symmetry," things that kind of line up, but then...don't.
---
The first example I noticed is the stealth bombers and the t1 frigates. Five of the t1 frigates for each race have a corresponding t2 variant that fulfills their role. For example, the gallente have the Incursus which corresponds the the assault frigates, the Imicus which corresponds to the covops Helios, the Navitas which corresponds to the logistics Thalia, the Atron which corresponds to the Interceptors, and the Maulus which corresponds to the ewar Keres.
---
All the other races follow this pattern pretty exactly. This leaves 4 frigates that don't have an exact duplicate for the t1 hull. This frigate is the "wild card" frigate that is a sort of template for the kind of ships that race flies: the dedicated drone Tristan, the punishing laser-ship Tormentor, the shield tanky rocket Breacher, and the kitey missile Kestrel.
---
(Here's another minor symmetry break: for Gallente, Caldari, and Amarr this is the *offensive* attack frigate, but for Minmatar it's the *defensive* bonused breacher. The minmatar offensive frigate is the AF template, while the other races use their defensive frigate)
---
These frigates might not have a straight t2 version, but they DO act as templates for the stealth bombers. The resemblance between the Tristan/Nemesis, Kestrel/Manticore, and Breacher/Hound is quite obvious.
---
And then randomly, the Amarr stealth bomber is an *inquisitor class* hull. Gah.
---
Any time something should fall neatly into place with the ship lore, CCP opts to be off by one. For example, the two classes of assault frigates are usually each bonused for one of the race's two favored weapons systems: drone Ishkur/hybrid Enyo, projectile Wolf/missile Jaguar, missile Hawk/hybrid Harpy, laser Retribution and...rocket Vengeance???
---
The navy Ewar frigs all get an extra bonus to weapon systems...except the Gallente, that get a bonus to Scrams.
---
The Guristas ships are all modeled on one of their parent faction's ships, all but the Blood Raiders cruiser and frigate are modeled on the Amarr line, and all but the Serpentis frigate are modeled on the minmatar...and that frigate is inexplicably the Angel Cartel frigate.
---
There's too many, man. This is just one more on the pile.
---
Lol, nothing of value was lost
---
its better, but it's not a great fleet ship (IMO)
---
its very easily countered by common doctrines... depending on how many are in your fleet and what you're doing... honestly Vedmaks are pretty nasty little small gang ships.
---
If you dont have the means to get to Germany, go to Wisconsin. It's the closest thing the US has to a Germany.
---
Not really. I think most people stick around because they have so much time and effort invested in the game. Eve is the greatest and worst game in the world
---
AFAIK this was the only fight horde showed up at. It shows that when we get involved it's an ez dub for the East
---
Don't forget the spirits, tobacco, and possibly the antibiotics!
---
I was hoping this would also contain FC whispering commands. 5/10 cause I feel slightly bamboozled.
---
If it was a low chance of success and destroyed the biomass it would not affect the market much.
---
I‚Äôve the same Q as the DnG guy - how did staggering PANIC save them? If one uses it they all get the bonus?
---
I only noticed that there was a lot of ship kills at this system, now I know why. Hopefully we'll see a video of this fight soon.
---
You can fit a pretty powerful double rep tank, with cap booster and 2 small neuts, but it‚Äôs pretty gimmicky.
---
Objective Secured, go back to sleep America.
---
NPSI vs NRDS makes me envision Nipsy Russell trying to fight the Tri Lams and so I have a hard time taking it seriously
---
are you the triglav defence discord group?

if so, yes. yesterday morning. low sec awoxers.

&gt;if i say it's not true, it won't be true.
---
here's the killmail. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77028287/
---
The wait is the symptom of a thorough review of applicants. Unfortunately this results in longer wait times to get in. It also means we aren't a screen door corp that literally let's in anything with a pulse. This time can be spent doing a number of things that all help new players learn the game.
---
Alternatively you are right, you can join Horde very quickly and you can look forward to getting killed by spies and hostiles that can join just as easily with the intent of causing havoc. KF is objectively more secure. Horde is more instantly accessible. New players continue to make their choices and play Eve, which is a win for everyone.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but we are not a Corp. It's a public fleet and we have about 30+ pilots in fleet on average. There would be ALOT more people on it of we awoxed you. All those pilots are KINNAKA. Stop being bad and make you have your facts straight.
---
Lowsec is dead, they already changed the timer so fights like that cant happen again.
---
Drop the bullshit mate. You work together with Provi's existing enemies, or was it just a coincidence you were there just as they were launching a sov attack? Where is your NPSI principle then? Nobody is buying it.
---
&gt; It's a public fleet and we have about 30+ pilots in fleet on average
---
yes, and i was invited from your public channel.
---
Simpry eric rall bait post!!!111!!
---
Modules on top of screen creates so much useful room at the bottom of the screen.
---
So then why are all the pilots on that kill mail KINAKKA. ?
---
Sounds like you were being bad and got raped by locals.
---
because you have a public discord and in-game channel with no security.
---
as i said, they were on YOUR DISCORD in YOUR COMMS.
---
this is why i joined up with an alpha in a cheap ship, because it was obvious this was bound to happen with new content. shame you're in utter denial about it.
---
Jesus, this is almost as shit as actual Pride.
---
Fewer people doing it means supply diminishes and prices go up... Which makes more people doing it...
---
Why would blap our own logi? They keep everyone alive. Stop playing victim and get real man. We've already SRPd two basilisks and a few other ships to our guys. If we really wanted to just gank and troll we would be 500 members strong. You don't have to fly with us and honestly prefer you don't. We don't need you killing all the good vibes. üòâ
---
&gt; Why would blap our own logi?
---
because your little discord is riddled with awoxers. which bit of this don't you understand?
---
I mean it would still affect the market...
---
This is the first I've heard of an awoxing incident. If it really was an awox why didn't you tell anyone in command? Awoxing is exactly welcomed on pub fleets in general. If there really was an awox incident you should have notified us and we could have resolved the issue instead of shitting up a Reddit post üòâ
---
&gt; If it really was an awox why didn't you tell anyone in command? 
---
because it's a cheap scythe, i don't really care about the ship.
---
also, this response is why - complete delusional denial. 
---
&gt;If there really was an awox incident you should have notified us and we could have resolved the issue instead of shitting up a Reddit post
---
it was, i just left the discord. i don't need you to srp a 20m isk ship, what you need to do is stop pretending that you don't have awoxers in your completely unsecure discord server.
---
i'm not saying this to deter other players, i'm saying this so that you can clean your house and make something that players can get involved with without feeling like they might get awoxed by some randoms because the guy at the top of the tree hasn't got a clue.
---
Oh fuck off.
---
If you managed to get awoxed by one guy then the ship your in probably isn't worth anything to begin with.  All our ships are buffer fit so there's plenty of time to call out the fact that a tard is awoxing. Also you weren't flying a doctrine ship üòä
---
Also doesn't change the fact that ONLY KINNAKA was on that kill mail. Pub fleets are Corp fleets. Can't really argue that logic.
---
Now you are starting to understand
---
That was one of the clearest most eloquent explanations. Do you do anymore writing on the mechanics of eve?
---
Thanks for sharing. Looking forward to reading that.
---
(Grabs Popcorn)
---
Good advice and good tip. Thanks for that.
---
the level of delusion here is staggering.

Thanks for this suggestion, I should contract them!

I'm sorry I could help you today. I'll sent your ticket to a level two agent.

Salvagers on biomass?

[removed]
---
Thanks for staying in the Caldari focus, we were farming the shit out of the minmatar one all day.
---
Honestly this. For the same price you could put a dual rep 1000 dps battleship on field and melt people. That's an extra 250-350 mill on the kb with low effort.
---
Jumping in and having fun is free. You have nothing to lose but time. Give it a shot.
---
The two Praxeis in that fleet made me moist ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Some corpses would not be harvested because of previous owner. The ones that are, with a low chance of retrieval would not inject enough implants to affect the market. Most corpses don't even have implants to unplug. Think about the recent plex sale. 15% off gets a few extra sales but does not affect plex price at all. I just don't see enough recovered implants to sway prices at all here.
---

---
You can try lowsec faction warfare. You don't need to join FW to shoot the fleets there. In these areas you should find small to medium fleets to fight.
---
Or go Bwf in geminate (horde) they fight you for sure. But bring small stuff so they don't blob you instantly
---
Whenever I take the time to write a goodpost on r/eve or any other forum associated with Eve the comments are filled with people throwing bombs or nitpicking the details. This is true regardless of which username I post under. It's the nature of the beast. The people here are toxic as fuck, they default to negative feedback in every situation. The bar is set even higher for people who attempt to be impartial when they do it.
---
There's a reason why so many IRL newspapermen are jaded and salty. You need thick skin to work in that business.
---
I legit would move all my shit here and live here just to keep the system.
---
We had a noctis with our fleet yesterday that was easily able to salvage 90% of the wrecks when there was a few destroyers around so eventually the ninja salvagers just moved on to follow others around instead. It never pulled aggro the whole day either but probably best to put tank on it anyway.
---
Apparently, people reading this thread do.
---
I also learned that the Triglavians love eating Logi pilots for lunch, even as they ignore the ships doing the deeps. Went out with my corp, and got an entire wing worth of logi ships shot out from underneath us.
---
I did get some revenge against the Triglavians running some Abyssals, only to come back to the thing more dangerous than Triglavians: Hostile players bubble-camping the trace.
---
Yes.
---
Haha! We run thermal resist buffer Basilisks and while sometimes they get volleyed off if there's a big trig fleet we found that about 5-6 work just fine and can take almost any sized fleet. Coordination is key ü§î
---
I pulled these 2 from my Pyfa.
---
This first one was "What's the best fit you can make with 4 rad sink II's" and this was the result, a bit of a meme but good dps:
---
Radiation Sinkimora
---
Occult S x500
---
Acolyte II x2
---
Hornet EC-300 x2
---
Small Energy Neutralizer II
---
Entropic Radiation Sink II x4
---
Light Entropic Disintegrator II
---
1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
---
Small Processor Overclocking Unit I x2
---
Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
---
Republic Fleet Medium Shield Extender
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
This one is meta (I think) you'll need a 3% CPU implant if you don't have one already:
---
Kikimora
---
IFFA Compact Damage Control
---
Entropic Radiation Sink II x2
---
Small Core Defense Field Extender II x2
---
Tracking Enhancer II
---
&gt; It would be cool if we could extract implants from corpses tho.
---
I‚Äôve advocated for this for years at Fanfest.
---
Also: a ship that has containers for corpses such that you can sell them to the Sleepers. Some people swallowed hard over that idea :-)
---
Gun. Mwd. MSE. Point. 2xsinks. 2xtracking. Anti-em. Anti-thermal. Core def. Ex.

I fully endorse this group. A lot of really good guys from all sorts of groups and backgrounds

I was thinking Horde / Brave would be a good place to start. Just hope they don't form 50+ fleets haha.

RC is an "elite" PL group that drops capitals for HTP and TRC.
---
Think my normal fit and all refits on my Nyx cost like this Hel killmailü§î Why ppls fit supers like a trashcanüòõ
---
Only 30 pilots in the RC fleet? How come?  
---
Maybe because SC died and NSH left a few weeks after they joined your ''war'' against Providence?  
---
Sounds about right. That Gila fleet looked so cute, aww, funny you need Spectres help now.
---
12 days old, you do the math.
---
I never really got along with it when we've done our Skeet Fleets. It's fragile and you never seem to to get to max out your weapon damage.
---
It's a pretty little ship though and the Singularity Storm skin I bought for it is one of my favourites in the entire game.
---
MAKE EVE GREAT AGAIN
---
Finding content in wormholes can be frustrating for sure. But I wouldn't rule them out entirely. 
---
For one thing, using wormholes as a highway to get to different areas of the map is an invaluable tool for changing up your content. 
---
For another, setting up in a wormhole with a k space static(low or null) will afford you the opportunity to pull some nice guerrilla tactics. Roll your static for a good hunting ground, extract the content, then reel back in and repeat.
---
Equi doesn't care enough for that tbh, I've only been here a few months now and IIRC there was only like one or two FC's that sucked up to snuff.
---
Though it's pretty clear that spectre is just another RC batphone at this point, this stalemate in our war has been going on for well over a year (or so i've been told) which is why timezones are horrible. I guess they're hoping to try and win some ground over from us, which is probably with spectre claimed they're only here for "good fights" and intend to kick nrds alliances out and "just let other alliances take the sov".
---
   
---
As much as RC/Spectre try, the fact of the matter is we're still able to outform by a relatively large margin in EUTZ, and even then I expect some of the older characters to start logging back in for the fun (as some have already).
---
I'm just looking forward to a nice campaign of pew pew and reddit drama.
---
because supers are cheap enough to fit for max ticks. U need 50 hours to repay that loss.
---
we're busy with NC. structures
---
Isn't it one of spectres rules or something that you're not a tool to be used by a group for their own gains?
---
Tell that to RC, before they batphoned you they cried a fair bit in eutz fights...
---
That's a lot of damage
---
I got 900m alone today, without a fleet
---
&gt;90 hACs iNstEad oF HarBS WouLd oF wrEcked prOvi tOdAY
---
Shoulda woulda coulda bro.
---
They're a batphone for RC who can't form enough in EUTZ.
---
With Lord Mittens as our supreme overlord, of course it is
---
My mentor Chicken Defiler taught me well
---
I've got around 1k bodies stored in two stations. I gotta start doing this, but at the same time my corpse collection satisfies me greatly
---
You poor deluded bastard, you have my feels.
---
F
---
&gt;you can have that guys stuff,
---
Only after he brings it into lowsec. Otherwise, our boys in blue will have a word with you.
---
That's a sexy fleet on that kill mail.  Good job!
---
Old enough to legally consume alcohol
---
But still too young to worry about insurance and mortgage
---
Don‚Äôt push your liver kid. End stage renal failure is no joke.
---
Probably going to have a heart attack if lost even one of them
---
I enjoy my corpse bay on my transport ship, but sometimes if I‚Äôm flying in a system where I know my enemies live, I‚Äôll drop them an offer for their corpse and then give them the classic blunder of dropping a fleet on them
---
Does he not understand stacking penalties?... Must sacrifice DCU for 2 extra DPS

If you show up with a 10 man gang in not to shiny shit. Normally they bring a good fight. At the beginning at least

That must be a bot. No real person can endure to wait 40s to lock a frig for multiple waves in multiple anoms...

You mean docked?

I'm so sorry I missed this fight, got on about 15 minutes to late to get positioned.  Next one, there's also more content to be had.  Good job lads!
---

I really like having modules, selected item window, locked targets, and the overview so close to each other. When docked, inventory comes up at the bottom, replacing modules and the capacitor. My alt is windowed about half size smack in the middle of the screen.
---
For most intents and purposes still blue with russia and china
---
wait, i thought provibloc got fucked up for good by PL or someone last summer.

are they back?

Thank you so much! I got a lot of hate at first, so I am glad to hear that people found it valuable. :D

It's a little tricky to kite in a battleship. Kikimoras, on the other hand, do very well in that role.

Different strokes for different folks. I tend to set my fights up so I can control the area I chose to fight.

I have a Fedo, one Slaver Hound (the rare one) and a Ship Fitting Guide in my Sin. All accompanied by a corpse of my good friend. I believe this will either bring me some luck or will just be a meme when the Sin finally dies üôÇ

Just roaming in branch and saw it on dscan.

What you really need is a test Bong, and some sweet leaves. now that's a party.

new tactic...  
---
Get Horde "SPAIS" and let them suicide supers.  
---
So we can post something on reddit  
---
EVE rly sucks.
---
They did, but shortly before the conversion of Stations to Faction Fortizars, Legacy attacked PL's hold over the region, liberated it and gave it back to Provibloc (mostly) while taking the now-Fortizars as payment.
---
lmao what a dumbo. good shit as always.

These aren't the bots you're looking for.

Have fun everyone :P
---
Good Job provi bros
---
If you‚Äôre willing to buy used you could go with like an i5 5600 for the cpu and a r9 390 for your gpu and play most games on max at 1080p. You should be able to get the gpu used for like a hundred or so, processor about the same.
---
It's the soundtrack from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_gA1i_ZeWA)
---
Next thing you know we will find bots for sale in the new eden store :))
---
Gpu prices are way down since the crypto bubble collapsed. 125 is still a steal for this but you‚Äôd probably find used 1060s for like $100 now all day on Craigslist
---
yes
---
oof, it's almost like the idea of third partying fights or working with someone to fight a bigger group has never been done before..oh wait.
---
Parking a **/s** at the end helps.
---
People seem to confuse NPSI with not being allowed to third party or team up with people to fight another group. This isn't anything new, we're just trying to stir some bigger shit up in provi for a chance at some more fun fights.
---
Eh, consider it as more of a community thing. There's plenty of pilots that basically only fly with us or other npsi groups now that it just made sense, plenty of people showed interest. So it's a sort of extra for people that don't have an alliance and fly with us all the time.
---
Get omega then.
---
Alphas already have to much at their disposal as its evidence in the rampant alpha botting.
---
You want to be part of this community fine support the game become omega. 
---
Your entitled opinion about what an alpha should be is not needed or wanted.
---
yes. 
---
https://www.thealphasguide.com/
---
pick something and go for it. if you get bored, pick something else. but do it with a friend or two. welcome to EVE.
---
Had to tell a few others as well, but what makes you think SF as a fleet can't or shouldn't? We third party fights all the time, or work together to fight a bigger fleet.
---
Meanwhile supers are dying every hour in delve.
---
What'd you expect with MASSADEATH and Barknor in NC... actual ships?
---
no
---
If they are really afk mining then you kill the drones without them getting a warning alarm.
---
Wondering this myself. Just started and having a hard time finding other RPers
---
Did you check if the one that purchased you wares is on the CSM?
---
This should be epic
---
Deliver them to Bob. Not Rob.
---
I had a lot of fun yesterday, thanks again for also having complete noobs in the fleet. o7
---
Just the amount I had and now it is 1440 plex
---
Anytime :D Payouts rolling out soon. Check Discord pings!
---
The Nyx will be dropped on a low sec system a week after this event, it will be amazing thank you so much.
---
We both loved Clear Skies so damn much.
---
It's the only supply of materials for those T2 triglavian ships, so it will be self-balancing regarding profitability.
---
The Moros will not be docking back up, going to cruise out of that station at full burn.
---
sometime people who hate them will pay even more. I watched  corp mate sell the corpse of a guy who hunts near where we lived at the time for almost 3 billion due to how many people disliked the character
---
I had to sell the purple and convert to plex to boost the  amount in the hold, it was that or miss out completely, had to organise getting a Nyx into a safe place for the week after event.
---
BTW the money also paid for a high grade slave set I will be sporting inside my golden pod.
---
Hope that is okay.
---
hey all so as subject says i cant contest. joined FW with corp 40 hours ago and this happens. any ideas ? :(
---
We were just upholding Provi's NRDS.
---
Hello, fellow cultured gentleman
---
They really need to do something about ninja salvaging. It's always been dumb that it doesn't make you suspect, when looting does, but it's a killer for this event. Either ninja salvaging should give you a suspect timer, or Concord responses should be disabled in invasion systems.
---
"They are" or "they were"?
---
 I too would like to get my hands on one of these and if it just means grinding to some level 4's I could do that.
---
unless its quickswipe.
---
well, you do, so there is that...
---
Are RC purple to you? No. So don't call it NPSI. Maybe call it Not Purple Shoot It As Long As It's Not The Guys Trying To Conquer Provi But Need Our Help With It. But NPSIALAINTGTTCPBNOHWI might not have the same ring to it from a marketing standpoint.
---
Thats Not how PANIC works
---
If one rorq uses panic it will only protect said rorq and the industrial subcap on grid all the other rorqs are still shootable
---
where did i have a "no u" reply? 
---
You haven't said anything other than "you're wrong", i gave you a reason why i'm right. Go back to your shitty d tier corp lmao
---
as the only member of "retard hills" i like this news , i can finally go and mine in provi and not be killed by the locals
---
I misread your title and though, "Oh no, here comes a Harry Potter rant."
---
Thanks! 
---
I will! o7 Need to get a better ship. :D
---
I don't get it why this skin line isn't available for literally the entire minmatar lineup.
---
Agreed. We are build a mobile death squad of cheap destroyers to deal with this problem :)
---
They'll learn it's not going to be very profitable to do it any more. 
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2odtfu.jpg
---
It depends. When you are like most new players you will join the game don't understand anything, join a "newbie friendly" corp and automaticly be one of the powerblocs and then you all you will do is pve what is boring.
---
if you want to milk the bot machine more first you need a monthly "bot pass" that lets you bot without repercussions and then an actual bot they could offer at the NES store too...
---
Thanks!
---
C üòÇ
---
is there any public channel where people can gather for fleets running these ? i am not talking about the automatic channel that you join when in an invasion system.
---

if triglavians have  organic body yes.  if body is just quantum energy then no?

---
umadbro?
---
You missed this gem Steve, [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77023937/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77023937/)
---
Isn't spectre NPSI? I haven't played in a while tho so I might be wrong.
---
Yeah that's my point its dumb as fuck lol
---
Not at all, I just don't like false pretenses.
---
I appreciate what they are trying to do as just spawning isk out of thin air like current bounty mechanics isn't going to do the game any long term favours.
---
however, since salvage doesn't flag you as a suspect then you can't do anything about ninja salvagers. on the other hand if it was loot drops not salvage drops that were where the money was, ninja looters would go suspect so you would have an opportunity for some interesting interactions.
---
Happy to help :D
---
Does it contest as soon as you warp in, and then once you setup your orbit it stops? Because one of the ‚Äúbeacons‚Äù is the capture area around the real beacon and for some reason you can orbit that, bring your outside of contest range
---
If by FC's getting farmed means killing dozens of billions in rorqs and supers while losing a couple bill bomber fleet or other assorted small shit, sure.
---
diplo in eve, whoda thunk it? jesus man, fleets can't go 23.5/7. you have to do shit at times.
---
i saw like 1 dude with like 10+ accounts in like W-4 of Branch with VNIS and Ishtars.... branch is a bunch of botters
---
there are these things called jump clones that allow you to move about the map easily once placed
---
How does it feel to grind unattended structures three times just to remove one, though?
---
Typical eve screwing over you're own Corp mates
---
Featuring Hilmar telling everyone the ideas he heard the night before like ressource depletion and all. My preference going for the "Will we get an Eve VR client one day ?" to which the answer was not "But Eve isn't even a FPS game you idiot !".
---
I hooe you killed em all!
---
Todays darwin award goes to ... isert name here.
---
how do u not know that this isnt  a troll name ?
---
Yes, you do exactly that. My guess is they had enough dps to bring multiple rorqs to panic, but response was quick enough to save the first coming out of panic.
---
CLEAN YOUR GOD DAMN TABLE
---
Because the entirety of branch is bot city.
---
10/10
---
Yeah that's mostly why I've stopped playing, I'm still interested in the game and am fine trying to work around the current shitty meta, but when I only have an hour or two to play I just can't get anything done.
---
I mean if you happen to have a corpse collector you can keep them and watch the body appreciate in value.
---
Or would it depreciate since the longer you leave it the more frozen copies of that person will drift out there?
---
The game gives you nothing so every built is by players.
---
Player cooperation is necessary not an afterthought
---
It‚Äôs not really boting if it‚Äôs just testing.
---
As a goon i will happily come and defend provi and NRDS
---
Is a Bot Test or a Test Bot?
---
I miss the sound you got from carrier/super fleets from the cap chain.
---
At this price point, why not A-type MWD too?
---
ignore the haters and keep doing what you do...waiting for a lore episode ash pls give me a lore episode
---
when you run in a cat ganking fleet instead of SRP they give you the ship to lose via trade in station. everyone says if they need a t1 or t2 fit ship and FCs trade out the ship. im pretty sure bumpers and scanners typically get srp, but ive never seen one die because antigankers dont gank non hostile ships. 
---
somewhat ironically the best way to cause trouble for code is to gank the hauler carrying a few hundred cats to a highsec station
---
When trit is 5.06
---
&gt;hi
---
nah when i warp in ill kill the npc and nothing changes. wondering if maybe i need a server down time for it to kick in for corp. ive tried sitting still when entering/orbiting/moving towards each object in area, nothing seems to work.
---
Welcome to Eve! ... I'd first suggest doing all of the training missions as they give your a taste of all the different "career paths" so to speak. See which one tickles your fancy. If you do stick to this game looking term you'll do a bit of everything anyway. 
---
There is a very steep learning curve in Eve and this puts off a lot of players but don't get disheartened ... I'd suggest joining one of the new players organisations as there are a lot of resources and help available ... My suggestion would be Eve University. They give you a safe environment to try out everything Eve has to offer. 
---
Good luck!
---
So NBSI then?
---
Could be a Geddon.   
---
We know it isn't though.
---
Elite doesn't have a subscription either, so all their funding has to come from cosmetics and the like expansion every 2-3 years thats costs about the same as 4 months of Eve.
---
Neither yours if I have to say..
---
That's cool as hell.   
---
All things considered though, we've had good luck here with just a bunch of buffer Enyos and some Thalias. If you're looking to ship down anyway.
---
I mean if it‚Äôs been 40 hours then you‚Äôve hit 1 or 2 DTs so idk
---
this belongs in the porn section
---
&gt;Provi hasnt been able to "blob" since i was the head fc back in the brave war days ;)
---
This was linked in leadership chat and everyone laughed, apparently you hype yourself up to be alot more than you were.
---
Upvote for wholesome.
---
ROFLMAO.... sorry when were you head fc? U always needed and still need jins hand holding to be able to do the core stuff such as target calling. You were never head fc and @ the most a skirmish fc.
---
Sounds like you're pets and you dont quite realize it yet.
---
daily downtime, mate.
---
I love how one can enjoy Eve in so many different ways.  Awesome!
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
May be because 1 super for ph is a big deal,   while 10 supers and 10 rorqs killed actually helps industrialists and miners earn more money and keeps the local economy  healthy.  Imperium is several times richer than the north!  Just swallow that fact already.
---
Nope read a bit closer I mentioned it has happened over an hour ago
---
I am having the same issue. We were in a fleet and about 20 of us DC'd and some got back on but still cannot connect.
---
Same issue midwest USA here.  Ran a speed test everything is fine  and low ping no packet loss.
---
Surprised he went for a cloak instead of a 6th Fighter support
---
if this just happened then it would probably be downtime, when you try to connect does it give you the same connectivity issues as I got?
---
You called?
---
NC. PL Special Interests entities.
---
Same issue in Australia.  Could reconnect sometimes, dc'd out within a minute or two etc.  Whole internet was fine other than eve login / support servers.
---
Telstra reporting an issue with the NBN / cable in my area
---
Yeah that might be the issue, how long ago did it start happening to you? I think mine started an hour or two ago.
---
Same here but Telstra not reporting outage in my area.
---
Botters use VMS.
---
As we entered system they immediately and simultaneously warped to their cit. 
---
Plus it just fits the meta for the pocket.
---
No it happened before DT and is still happening after DT. I sometimes get a error that says a network error has occurred and sometimes i can connect but will then disconnect after a minute or so.
---
'Calling them bottets is racist!' - Shart Dragon
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
He is whining like one
---
Lower your orbit. I did the same thing while in my garmur. I just had to get closer.
---
Me and a few mates having the same issue, started happening 6.30 onwards (3ish hours ago). 
---
Tried purging the cache and re-adding accounts to no avail. The in-launcher net tools show a stable connection to the server, however, I was also having issues connecting to the EVE online website. Again, using a VPN extension in Chrome let me connect to the website.  
---
I'm back in the game using a VPN to change IP / DNS so try using that if you guys have on. It's been stable since downtime ended, whereas without the VPN it holds the connection between 5-15 seconds, assuming I can connect.  
---
TL;DR  
---
Use VPN, seems to work.
---
I like how you've extended the Overview all the way to the top, then shifted your Selected Items to the left.  I think I might try that.
---
Provi bears unofcked and won like once against an NPSI fleet and smug about it?
---
Did you skip the entire few months of them being alien to New Eden? They don't give a fuck about your resists.
---
Here's the thing:
---
I don't know when everyone got this idea that winning the isk war became such a big deal.  In small skirmishes like this, 9 bill was probably made by the losing team on their alts while the fight was happening.
---
So in this instance I believe Test did win because the fortizar is still alive.  This is way more important than even 30 - 50b isk because it's in a strategic location.
---
Just some perspective:. I am a frat member (and I love this war... Makes our space entertaining)
---
well htp tend to have fcs who lead spectre fleet and or ties to spectre fleet, so they have been using them as attempted increase in milita forces against us.
---
Yeah that sounds like the same issue I am having, another user mentioned connection via their VPN worked so maybe give that a go
---
Yeah good idea will give it a go
---
you mean Shoan Dragon no?
---
After you've done all of the training missions you should go and do the 'Sisters of Eve Epic Arc'. Its about 50 missions that aren't too difficult with no hand holding and its in High Sec so its pretty safe to run for a new player. The no hand holding gets you used to finding and remembering where things are on the UI which can be a learning curve all on its own. There's a combination of trade and combat missions and gets you in a few different ships. After that you should be a little more comfortable with basic game functionality and when you join a corp like EvE University you'll have an easier time following instructions and finding things.  
---
I'll say one thing, unless you find something you really like doing in Highsec, don't spend to long there. You'll get bored and you'll burn out. I would personally recommend joining a reputable nullsec alliance when you hit 5-10 mil skill points. That's about the level you need to be, to be relatively self sufficient isk wise in null.

Last thing, follow the skill training plan below. Obviously select alpha or omega depending on you subscription status. Best place to get your skill books is in Jita:

These are the core skills you should train. This will get you into most basic PvP doctrines and PvE fits. When I say you should, I mean you really should follow the skill plan. Most organized alliances will require you to do a minimum amount of PvP every month (but that varies wildly depending on where you end up) and they'll want you to be in their doctrine ships, so be ahead of the curve by getting started on the training now.  
---
Hope you enjoy playing EVE! If you can get past the learning curve you'll love this game.

all good observations but

that's the combat frigate for minmatar, not the special snowflake one which would be the rifter (tank bonus=combat frigate, tackle bonus=attack frigate and then you have racial flavor)

amarr are not too big on drones tbh, sure they have a few drone boats but they are either focused on capacitor warfare, electronic warfare or both. missiles have long been established as an amarr t2/t3 capability under khanid lineup and missile subsystem.
---
&gt; And the VFI completely abandons its role as an ewar frigate.

Join a corp. Newbie friendly is best. It's easy to get overwhelmed and lose any kind of direction in this game and quickly burn out. This game is best played with friends.

Spectre FC decided that leaving half the fleet behind trapped in bubbles was a good idea, instead of growing a pair and fight. Very disapointing.

had the same issue in australia turned on my VPN and it worked again really weird
---
If it's anything like the UK -   
---
In the UK it's illegal to sell alcohol to under 18s, or buy on behalf of them with the intent to provide alcohol to an under 18.  
---
However, there are certain circumstances under which younger people are allowed:
---
1) It is Legal for someone over 18 to buy a child aged over 16 a beer, wine or cider if they are eating a table meal together in licensed premises.
---
2) At home, a child aged five to 16 can drink alcohol at home or on other private premises as much as they like. (of course, the implication is that it's therefore likely to be provided by their parents)
---
Yet it's regular empires adapting alien technology. Look at the Zarmazd - developed by Amarrian military, has amarr t2 resists.
---
Either way it's inconsistent.
---

---
so, what is the reward for this invasion?
---
this gives me an idea for a videogame.
---
the huge majority of the game is just an idle game where you minmax automated resource acquisition, the gameplay comes from spending those resources to damage other peoples resource acquisition. you topple enough of their systems and you can take over their territory and use it for more resource gathering. 
---
i bet eve feels a bit like that at the very top. you barely log in. you just make sure the miners are mining the right resources, indy dudes are making the right ships, defense fleets are doing their job. you log in to FC a fleet to go melt some miners and maybe take your neighbors space.
---
All bots should be run over with tanks and mashed into a fine pink pie.
---
Personally I care more about the lore part which impacts actual game. What technology empire engineers possess already, what did they reveal, what they want to achieve?
---
Apocrypha, for example, made perfect sense in this regard, with all the new t3 cruisers. How triglavian technology is adapted by the empires - doesn't.
---
I agree that the statement I made is too strong and generalized, but that's how it feels to me.
---
the only isk that sinks is when the implant is bought from lp store with lp and isk
---
and that isk is sunk the moment implant is bought, it doesn't need to be destroyed

Damavik actually shines in frigate 1x1 if you make use of its utility highs. It's not cheap though, but i think it wins vs almost each and every brawling frigate, including nergal.

RC is basically the dudes who live in camal keepstar, dropping on lonely supers who traverse the derelik region unaware of their surroundings. 
---
 https://zkillboard.com/alliance/173714703/ 
---
They are the owner/operator of the Keepstar and generally has loose ties with NC/PL as well as being freindly with TEST (in so much as agreements not to shoot thier structures).
---
I'd say loose affiliation /allies of HTP (htp allies The Rogue Consordium), ARTON (which base primarly out of arton and are basically the domain version of phew),

There are also some smaller tier alliances/corps involved in with / as alts of the main protagonists listed here
---
I am sure i am missing a few, but generally they all work loosely together and have some similar standings are nbsi and operate in parts of providence as well as the derelik region and the domain region. 
---
anyways hope this helps explain who those groups are. there are a few other smaller alliacnces that show up from time to time like removal, who dares win,  Templis CALSF , Waffles, and some other smaller groups besides these, but thats the bulk of the groups that tend to be loosely affilitated with RC

That was my attempt at making a joke... Yeah I know I am over exaggerating how things were then and how things are now. I have had many friends that have all gone bitter vet over the years and all had various reasons why they eventually gave up Eve Online.

I'd recommend that you step away from hisec entirely, as you have the skillpoints to make a lot more isk somewhere in null, but if you're really into missions, here's this:

Hello police? I would like to report an assault
---
Literally every group in the game does this...
---
I think it‚Äôs alright. We killed 6 of hordes the other day and they stagger panicked. Don‚Äôt know how we did it, boat was fc.
---
they make spelling mistakes like this and call them deficient.
---
Idunno man. I'm surprised they undocked.
---
A nyx kill gets its own thread....what year is it 2012?
---
"Some reason" being that it counts the range from its edge, so all the area you can capture from is 0km distance.
---
Sounds boring as fuck either way
---
These people don‚Äôt want to put in any effort. That‚Äôs on them. It should take time and skill to kill a 6 billion isk ship and those miners should have options to save it. Idiots die everyday in delve, because people like olmeca put in the time to kill them. We aren‚Äôt the only ones with an umbrella anyways, I gave up FCing whale fleets because of how much time it takes for only a chance at killing one. 
---
Ya‚Äôll should kill more supers in delve though so I can sell more nyx hulls :p
---
You can only use standard ASCII letters and numbers, so basically the English alphabet. You can't use letters like √â, for example, as well as other scripts like Chinese.
---
I don‚Äôt think that would help. They already have to lock a rock in order to panic and most of them caught are already sitting so close to a rock ewar wouldn‚Äôt affect them. In my experience it‚Äôs about timing and numbers. We managed to kill 6 PH rorqs the other day before they had the numbers to force us off grid and even then we were there for 20 minutes because they kept chaining panic. If you want to hurt rorqs go kill their drones. So many people afk mine. Watch olmecas video and make some money.
---
I haven't looked at the triglavian ships in much detail yet but, if t1 trig ships have trig resists and t2 versions have empire resists, that also kind of makes sense since one could argue that t2 versions were designed after the empires gained a better understanding of triglavian tech and were able to design them closer to their traditional designs.
---
They‚Äôll keep complaining because they think they should be able to kill billions of isk with no work. The people that kill rorqs know how and who. Look at all our idiots in delve that die.
---
I‚Äôve made fun of you in the past for being whiney and sounding like a girl but this is pretty cool. You put in a lot of time and dedication to counter the meta. You deserve your kills. 
---
Being in goons gives you a lot of tools and opportunities to never die, people that choose to ignore these rules and help get dicked on and I get to sell them more shit. +1 cool doc dude

I have no idea how to do those.  Like I said, I've been out of game for 6 years.

I'm new, but if I understand correctly, those resources are what's required to build the ship.

I did 2 T2s just fine, got screwed on a T3 due to 2 starving Vedmaks and a Starving Damavik! Some people in chat said there were things I could have done to live... But nothing I could have done differently would have mattered. My top was was just below 1,000, while the Vedmaks get up to 2,200m/s. I should have killed the Starving Damavik first but I did go for the tangling. The max range on this thing with Mystic and the drugs I had was 19km, though there was no way I was keeping far enough away from the Vedmaks to cancel out their neuts. 
---
It was a fun test! Now 2-3 Nergals, that‚Äôd be fun to try! I got my weapon DPS up to 596 at one point. Also all of this way in a firestorm. Maybe electrical would be better, but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
What would be the appropriate fit for burner missions?
---
Imagine target calling a chinese fleet. "*broadcast* next target... the wiggly thing followed by a house"

Blizzard shat their pvp bed by merging Russians into EU. Love calling targets when the opposite team consists of moon runes.

Well yeh, you've got to find a loss by someone that has kills with the same ship beforehand.

Lol, yep this thing also is something to consider.           
---
&gt; FC: Primary target .... ugh ...  the first char looks like IKEA lamp....
---
"The north"? Sure, and the south does exactly the same thing. Look at this thread where you have goalpost number 2, and then wait for next time NCPL feed a fleet trying to save an objective, and there'll be goons all over it with line no. 1.

Who'd have thought us dunking 3 of their rorqs would have enraged them so? Still, from the small part of the bigger fight I saw last night I don't think proviblock has much to fear, and potentially we have some good fight to look forward to.

Right, they did as all regular people who VNI rat do....

The standards for calling people bots these days are so low, soon we'll be just calling everyone who plays EVE a bot.
---
I literally fought PanFam successfully as a campaign commander for 8 months but ok
---
bring providence to dread fight, better insurance
---
It would be a problem for the vast majority of FCs - they'd struggle with target calling "Next is... um that house looking thing followed by the hashmark"
---
You can name your ship, because few people need that urgently, but you yourself have to have a target-callable name.
---
Though UUSEE is not bad.
---
there are ships with corpse bays though. just not that affordable

He dropped the corp so fast and gracefully that nor the zkill[https://zkillboard.com/character/1677619681/] or the [EVE](https://imgur.com/a/7Cd9Vwt) see him in NPC corp.
---
Yeah, but they recently announce an anti-Provi campaign.  Maybe.  Who announces what for an NPSI fleet and whether it means anything, who knows.
---
They also booted all Provi people from their channels, so maybe that means they're serious.  But... how serious an NPSI fleet can be, who knows...
---
All in all, pickup fleets verses any organized group, and you have to admire the guys in the pickup fleet for making a go of it.
---
this is the guy that fed a nyx yesterday he must be rage quitting eve.
---
Too bad that he was trying to join goons tho.
---
Wow two North special operation in a single day. Droppu g corp or ally is super retarded. Good catch i guess
---
for this titan in north he could buy 2 in delve ^(aka why NCPL is so fucked now)
---
Does it matter? I guarantee that. you will lose more isk on the Providence side of a 50v50 fight either way. Heck, it makes in universe sense: why would you give equally good insurance for a given premium for a warship as a freighter that isn't meant to be shot at.
---
Why was he active there anyways? Pilot dont seembretarded on the first look. Is there a story what heppened?
---
You seem so well informed on North prices. I think you should replace your spies they are retarded.
---
Well it is about being consistent      
---
T1 insurance was about base material cost, it was reduced for capitals ... but not all correctly like we see.         
---
This will create issues like insurance frauds quite soon.
---
Why can you orbit that at all and not just the beacon? Is what I was saying.
---
I thought about this, but honestly I have been burned so many times in this game, that I would rather do something like that within a corp, instead of a bunch of individuals.  The problem is I am in the USTZ and every corp I have joined the USTZ is very weak and I end up station spinning.
---
He lost a nyx to goon yesterday because he was retardedly gatting in M-0, and was denied SRP. Started awoxing PH members.

Left with his titan to join goons then proceeds to get baited on a free citadel.

TBH they should make insurance fraud count against you, maybe you get a billion in payout a month and then after that it is drastically reduced. After all, after the 5th or 6th dreadnought you would think and insurance company would drastically raise your premiums.

As others have said, do the training mission, then move on the the Sisters of EvE epic arc called "The Blood-Stained Stars."
---
3 rules for you as well:
---
1: Trust No One.
---
2: Ships are like ammo; disposable.
---
3: Only undock with what you are willing to lose.
---
Lastly, the game is a sandbox.  After the training missions and SoE arc, there is no direction.  You set your own goals.  See what you liked after the above and dive into it.  New Eden is your oyster!

wasnt this the same guy that lost his nyx then started awoxing?

some say he was on way to join goons

Incursions are not a corp activity you join an in game channel not a corp it's a 40 man fleet of strangers running under trained and verified fleet comanders who have an Sep program

Why are you running these in Jita?
---
Fly caldari militia l4 fw missions in a jackdaw. Way better isk than the high sec stuff and incredible safe. If you don't want to drop 400m on a jackdaw, a 60m enyo isn't much worse. 
---
Enyo might get in trouble with too big and organized Gatecamps. But you can usually just warp off or reapproach with assault DC. 
---
Also you have to pay at least some attention which the jackdaw does not require.
---
Cool, I‚Äôm very ignorant when it comes to rorqs etc. So, one guy panics when his tank is about to break, he has 5mins invul so attackers switch to another rorq - after rorq1‚Äôs PANIC is done, I assume the attackers don‚Äôt have the DPS to switch back kill it before he can re-activate?
---
?
---
&gt; Oh, how many regions u guys have left now? I heard something about Cobalt Edge being next on the chopping bloc ...

I‚Äôm not aware of Horde having any plans of taking CE, though after Goons leave Tribute I‚Äôm thinking Branch/Deklein in the fall might be a thing.

You deserved it sorry.

Don‚Äôt do it in jita would be the lesson I guess, rip.

Momma always told me Stupid is as Stupid does.
---
If you want to use your dread as per its design and you insure it, expecting it to die, you're making a good move.
---
If you want to use your freighter as per its design and you insure it, expecting it to die, you're wasting money.
---
As long as you cannot profit from a freight loss, who the fuck cares?
---
This. So much this.
---
Yeah I guess. Been doing them in jita ever since they came out. Not sure how they found me because I thought thered be so many abyssal runners so how did they specifically find me...
---
Didn't he get kicked for awoxing yesterday? After dropping a nyx to try to save a dread or something along those lines?
---
[Like this one?](https://highdrag.wordpress.com/2019/06/01/hd-98-high-drag-eve-universe-mash-up/)

The thing is the theme seems to be that everyone has kinda known about some of this stuff longer than we have. The Thukker helping smuggles out Alpha clones based on Drifter tech, CONCORD tracking the World Ark, The War of a Million Lies. 
---
You are entitled to not like the decisions made, I just disagree that CCP doesn't care about the lore. They have pretty great attention to detail, it just seems confusing at first because we don't understand what all is happening. I guess that alone could be seen as a hand wavey dismissal.
---
So should we please ignore it?
---
I didnt say they shouldn't be mining. They shouldnt be infinitly afkable and scale able. If you read my point it says MINING DRONES not rorq mining.
---
Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure of the mechanics bud so can‚Äôt be sure. I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt show on dscan/combat probes while in the abyss? So maybe they had combat probes ready, and got you at your safe spot then watched which way you warped to then camp the trace in that direction? Or are the entry and exit spots different? 
---
I would say more likely is timing and luck. They saw you were fit to run an abyss, then saw the trace pop up shortly after you undocked so guessed it was yours, and then just had a 10-20minute camp until you popped out? 
---
If you ask them nicely they might tell you.
---
Undoubtedly.
---
I'm calling the police.
---
Because HS is safe.
---
Ding!
---
Losing a dread is expected, if not desired.
---
Losing a freighter is neither expected or desired.
---
Pend is still dumb as shit for insuring dreads ;)

What would 3 do to you?

Maybe learn not to do a thing that leaves you completely vulnerable in the most crowded system in eve.

Find a better system to run them in lol. There are tons of empty highs RC systems not far from jita
---
It's a well known glitch for captured plexes that show contested after the timer is complete.
---
Nothing to do but move to the next plex.
---
you scan down the abyss traces and camp the exit. The t4-5 ones give you a different color i believe, and those are the ones that give you a suspect timer when you exit so they can agress
---
Ty, Edited
---
Test bot please ignore
---
theyre cheap now

Didn't u try that already in the past? Didn't work so well :)

As others pointed out, doing Abyssal sites with a blingy ship in Ganker's Paradise was a very (VERY) stupid idea.

You totally deserve it.

"No Rorqs die, just several in structure."

you had a shit FC then?  how do you put several in structure and not kill any?

Aye we were just wondering how they found this guy‚Äôs trace specifically. Could have just been luck, or there was no one else running t4-5s in jita ))
---
We got distracted.

Plus we were the only ones who saw through Sort at the time.

There are?

Which ones?

Goons titan are 2-3b cheaper than north. AndFYI  PH doesn't care about the killboard.
---
if you see him warp off from the station after you have ship scan him you turn tracking camera on and see what direction he warps 
---
then you make the d-scan con showing on the solar map and set d-scan 5 degree and just combat probes in the line the d-scan con shows he warped too
---
Theres still the target markers you can use in fleets, right?

Yea that‚Äôs what I suggested, he said he warped to a safe first so they would have had to probe him there quickly then do as you outlined. Entirely possible.

It's distressing wood!

Tracert eveonline.com and look at what nodes are failing.

Also Ping eveonling.com -t and look for huge spikes

That's just the resources needed to build the ship (and it's not very much at all) but that's not the point of the post. Look at the name of the ship at the top of the window.

I mean when they were just boosters they didnt have a use. Rather werent used.. At all.. So I thibk they should mine.. But give them a capital strip miner or something not super afkable drones ffs.. Its like carriers with sents back in the day.. Way to easy to afk with.

Something that gives them a reason to be in space. But why in Bobs name are they the best miner.. The best afk miner.. With the best tank.. AND PANIC...

Is it any fun to just go to Branch and shoot bots? Or are the logistics of getting stuff there that‚Äôs fun to fly around and shoot in more of a pain than it‚Äôs worth?

800 dps is nothing. Nuets go to 24 km. Drones. Feed more more plz.

Thats the good thing about EVE, do whatever you want to do it is still a sandbox.

On the other side many people will tell you to join a "newbie friendly corp" but this is a rather bad idea as all those corps are in big powerblocks which will limit the things you can expierience dramastically.
---
I have to agree with you if ccp wants people to do it make it loot instead of salvage make it more interesting for thoses involved.
---
Mines called can o‚Äô corpses haha
---
Look up Stimulus Kiki losses.
---
Those guys are the best with that ship.
---
I don't think this one has the escape velocity
---
I think they did for the first few days after release but they patched it out.
---
l o l
---
How many people show up to these events? It seems like a crazy way to spend your resources, to drag your devs around the world making mepty promises before a handful of hopeful nerds. 
---
I feel like the 9 people on stage could run some sort of tournament for EVE groups instead...
---
You mean jin'taan who I trained with ristlin and core? that jin? Jin was like 14 when i was head FC along with ristlin and coreblood. All the head FC team and diplo team left after the war was done because of this type of ungratfulness. You know when core made a statment and stole all the SRP money providence had :'D Short memory?
---
you could also try abyssals, start from t1 and work your way upp. T1 filaments called "calm exotic", "calm electric" etc etc require no more than a t1 cruiser with maybe a little tech 2 here and there. When you get comfortable with t1 got to t2 etc. 
---
t3: about 80 mil / hour, T4 : about 200, T5: about 300

I mean, you take the lazy route running them in jita instead of say 3 jumps out of jita, someday you were going to oay the price.
---
And if they could lock you your insta wasnt insta btw
---
It is absolutely not a waste of ammo. POSes can be taken down real fast compared to citadels, and whormhole poses will drop everything, so there‚Äôs a good chance of a loot pi√±ata. People normally use leshaks, oracles or vnis to kill them, because of the high damage and vnis and oracles don‚Äôt use ammo.
---
The salt from provi is amazing love the downvote popcorn :'D Its not supprising that line members love to still amarr victor reeeee.
---
I thought they hit it across the board.. Thats sad its only on caps.. Freighters are the problem with insurance fraud. T1 mats are getting to cheap.
---
Better get building orcas and freighters. Get that dank insurance fraud isk!
---
guess you have never seen how fast kikis melt drones with their near perfect tracking.
---
and its 800DPS per kiki.
---
Also have fun neuting a ship with cap boosters and that huge cycle time of heavy neuts.
---
Yes, but if you can recover the implant, someone somewhere no longer needs to sink isk back into that lp store.
---
Just name your VNI Tiananmen square massacre
---
If you have the time, isk and SP move to wh space.. Or nullsexs. 
---
L4 missions are bad.. Always have been unless your blitzing they will always be bad.. 
---
So if you MUST fly l4s get a tengu and blitz them dont do full clears unless its something loke blockade where you have to and its mostly worth it.
---
That being said. A c2-3 will provide you with way more isk making opportunities as well as give you PI options. 
---
If your a casual your more than welcome hit me up in game for access to a c2 static c3 im looking for players. PM me for names.. I like reddit being separate lol
---
Older than your memory in regards to provi it seems.
---
This would be straight up epic
---
Hey bud, I was the who did (most) of the gank. Thanks for the loot!
---
Well just look at it this way, that's your biggest loss *so far*
---
Ok... sorry I just woke up and had to go re-read the thread because I forgot why we're even here. Instead of letting you continue setting up a hypothetical scenario because ur l337 pvp, I should have reviewed the facts. I was especially shocked you continued you continued to assert yourself even after I was like meh, we all do things differently... but it is the internet...
---
OP said he's looking for solo fit. What you're describing is meant to pretty much hold down anything that isnt a snipy bastard sitting 100-200km out, and even then he would have moments to live. Keep stacking kiki's until you can take a carrier... doesnt matter if we dont have any parameters here.
---
So like he has a few options, I'm sure you'll try to annoying make up more scenarios, but in the end, the kiki as a solo ship isnt the best option.
---
If the person insnt a suicide banker then it will appreciate in value. If its a suicide ganker then the value is forever plummeting and will require a higher quantity to have high value.
---
There's a few people that I have multiples of their corpses because they're suicide bankers, but Bob doesn't care which corpses are destroyed at the sun, just that the deed is done
---
Doesn't count this was a goons titan.
---
It's because you have no idea what you're doing. 
---
Bring cyno inhibs, have bubbles on incoming gates. Have a bhaalgorn or two handy to silence their abilities when it comes to repping. Communicate.
---
Im really at a loss to your ree for RC. NPSI is the one to declare war, not just spectre. Although we will work with or against any entity coming ino provi to fight provi. This is nothing official between RC and friends and the NPSI realm. Not that the official story matters haha. We are all shooting provi, and no one like to be shot at, go figure.
---
Seeing that others have body collections makes me feel a lot less creepy.  Thanks
---
that's an indirect effect, and people may well keep buying as many implants as before, or consider other options on the lp store which are still isk sinks
---
i doubt that's what comment op was thinking anyway, no need to stretch it really
---
Truth? We asked them to entosis.
---
Sorry mate, wrong side of the universe to be us.
---
Is this game worth getting into at this point?
---
 I've read a lot of comments about people with 10+years under their belt in this game, it makes it sound like I don't have a chance. 
---
The other thing I was worried about, is this actually free to play? Or is it "free" up until a certain point to where you have to keep buying stuff or upgrades (not sure how it works) to remain relevant or even enjoy the main part of the game ( think WoW up until lvl20)
---
HTP formed out of NPSI because of the sheer amout of 3rd party fights going on and made their name around that so yeh. Its asold as NPSI itself.
---
Anyone who wishes to join our fleets are purple to us yes. This includes RC.
---
Yessssssssssssss
---
NPSI needs the warm up time :)
---
You declared war to one side and actively supported the other side in their conflict. Truly NPSI fleets don't have friendlies in their overview and don't mess with politics.
---
I want to get to the point where I can go "let's drop 3+ bil on this random npsi fleet"
---
Lol who was singing? That actually wasnt bad. May have sensed a hint of auto-tune though.
---
Trust me, leading provi to victory against AAA and Brave (The only war provi has won) Is not the highlight of my eve life and not something to over hype myself over. My statments in regards to my history with providence is to really say I left on amicable terms and highlight there is no ill intent.
---
By your definition of NPSI maybe. Provi vs HTP/RC/Etc has been a years long sort of weird stalemate in a sense. We wanted to stir the pot and cause some bigger fights and see what actually happens, and we have a group helping us do so. None of our guys are complaining about more stuff to fight over and bigger fleets to take out. That was the entire goal :)
---
I think people have some weird logic that a fleet consisting of people that wanted to join a public group somehow isn't allowed to work with other entities? It doesn't change anything about what we're doing or who we are - people signing up for no bullshit, just fun fights
---
Jesus, Horde are trash :)
---
Lol where do you find a wh group with no logi and no bhaalgorns?
---
I purchase a lot of skins but I cant bring myself to buy these, apart from the damage to the hulls they are too similar to the default skin, and for the cost there are better options.
---
You have some amazing logic. We are the ones who originated the idea. We contacted other groups already somewhat fighting/bothering provi since we're too small on our own.
---
SF's entire goal is to stir the pot, cause some actual bigger fights, and have fun doing so. None of us give a shit about sov/isk/whatever, there's nothing that would even entice us to do someone else's bidding as 'pets'.
---
Who suddenly decided that public fleets aren't allowed to work with others to fight bigger groups? Third partying fights or teaming up with people is something that's constantly done just to be able to have more fights and get more fun shit done.
---
I camped that part of branch for a while and I can confirm it is infested with bots.
---
Nope. People in our alliance are still going to shoot eachother when not on the same fleet's etc. If I'm roaming solo somewhere and a SF fleet finds me, alliance members are more than free to shoot us.
---
As SF's longest standing leadership - the day that someone tells me I can't shoot X target, they're getting their ass kicked out. We work together on fleets to be able to create bigger fights and more content, and that's our only standing together with any other groups.
---
It is tons of fun, and I am considering returning.
---
To do it, you need to have enough alts to camp many systems at once. After a period of time some of the bots will add you to the cloaky camper list and ignore you. Then you slaughter them,
---
We're not worried about the sov, we're just stirring the pot for more and bigger fights to enjoy &lt;3
---
From Bombers Bar Intel page... "The first who provides Intel will be bombed last , which side are you on? \*  
---
True heroes respond here with bomb everyone :) ."
---
You guys declared war to one side in the conflict and support the other. NPSI fleets have no friendlies in their overview.
---
You think that's bad, you should see the insurance on Pirate ships XD
---
Stratios - 159m to buy price in Jita, but the max you can insure it for it 6.5m!

My absolute biggest advice is to move the radial menu to the right mouse button and reduce its delay. The radial menu is incredibly flexible and has saved my life on several occasions just by able to being more reactive. Also you can set a hotkey for radial broadcasts which is incredibly handy
---
Right? It feels like something might be drawing northern attention away from FRAT.s war. Can't really put my finger on it tho
---
Everything dies to 20 supers and a couple recons. That‚Äôs what makes eve eve right now.
---
Is it still considered having a poor tank even after the 20% bonus to resistances were added?
---
We all know what BB says and does are two different things.
---
You have access to the fits of the best players of the game on zkill and this is the best you come up with? üòÇ
---
It is really disappointing how watch the community seems to be actively against people making those kinds of content. It is particularly bad on this subreddit. I have had to expand my feedback sources and just learn to ignore the haters and watch the statistics. I make things because I want them to exist.
---
You are just using NPSI cover to attract more people to help one side, you're not third partying. If you start shooting at both sides than it'll be a different matter.
---
Sure, having 3-4 guards, maybe 1-3 bhaalgorns and maybe Fax in grid would make this fight much more fun for both sides. It's a shame they did not know it.
---
What if its a defensive camp in your own system?
---
This is the part that I think is very confusing. I successfully ran a T5 firestorm and was pretty successful even without implants or real drugs. My only guess is would be he tried to run a dark and couldn't apply damage or more likely boundary violated.
---
The post is a bit over the top to stir some hype, yeah. Sov isn't at all any of our interest, but it's just the way to force provi to come defend their sov - We'll agress it and use it to cause fights, but we don't give a damn about who actually owns the systems/etc. For us, it's the tool used to force content here.
---
What if I was 7 foot tall and got drafted in the NBA Lottery?
---
It is if theres no ships bumping on the undock, since its so crowded
---
Yup. If we're not in the middle of a fight v provi, there's no reason we wouldn't. That's always how SF operates. We work together for the content, but that's the limit. I am very sure to make certain that no politics/blues/not being allowed to shoot xyz ever happens in SF.
---
Yeah same :/
---
Why not kick them?
---
/r/whoosh
---
So..the same as world war bee? There are constantly cases where SF temporarily teams up with someone to fight a bigger fleet, and this just isn't any different.
---
We work together to cause fights, wether we win or lose we just want more content to happen in EVE. Stir the pot, or it gets cold.
---
Only idiots would bot in their own space with their own mains. Test aren't idiots. Hence it could still be yours... =\]
---
Oh, zkill is a library of intellectual fits, I wouldn't ever suggest these builds are better
---
It's all spodbrains so it's unfair to count them as a full person. Maybe 1/4th is more accurate
---
Get a safe spot in a calm system outside of dscan range of the gates
---
We don't care about the actual 'winning' of any side. Hell, even HTP/RC doesn't actually have any use at all in that much space or running provi out. SF is just working to stir bigger fights and create more shit to shoot, and working with groups to make that possible. None of us are blue either, I fully expect HTP to shoot us on random roams and vice versa.
---
Based on the title I thought this post was made by CCP.  
---
Game is a fucking joke, but nobody is laughing
---
Who hurt you
---
I do find some of the criticism helpful - It's not always just "BOO YOU SUCK" - But I think the level of professionalism the EVE community wants from it's news is beyond what one person can realistically do, and any team will end up being infiltrated/fall apart/have stylistic differences over time.
---
CCP Archduke.
---
Definitely do not join a scam corp named Conoco.
---
See this thread :    [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bur4y5/whats\_conoco/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bur4y5/whats_conoco/)
---
If you know where to look I suppose..
---
Excellent point. Feedback should be used to improve yourself not to discourage you. I also sometimes suspect that people allow their personal feelings and loyalties to taint what kinds of content they support or discourage. additionally, in particular, people here on Reddit tend to be more bitter than average and therefore posts that positively reflect CCP or the game can be attacked as being naive or white nighty.
---
Otherwise there will be bunch of people running around in Russian, French, Portuguese letters in their name
---
eve, the tranquility server at least, is already technically banned in china and people from china seem to play without too much of an issue.
---
so, i doubt people give that much of a damn.
---
Exactly what you just said... and that is why this is not NPSI; you teamed up with a side in the conflict. Anyone not purple should be a target. NPSI has no blue's. You can call it anything you like but it's not NPSI.
---
You know that your own stated goal is not to take tribute but to burn it? Meaning all it takes to unfuck that is maybe two months of putting up structures. Less if you don't actually fight over them. Meanwhile you are in the process of alienating quite a few krabs and getting your economy borderline shut down. You know, the two things that brought you to where you are right now?
---
I think what happened is a bigger corcern.
---
Botting in BKG
---
This is another level of shittness
---
The whole game is infested with bots.
---
Obviously all of the rental territories are the worst, but botting certainly isn't limited to those.
---
Against a JFC in t1 BC vs hacs. Let them have their trash memes. I am 100% certain it wont be the last misspelled propaganda to come out of provi.
---
Test bot please ignore ü§£
---
CCP should leave an ad hiring for bot hunters. I'd take that job even at minimum wage
---
Are there any circumstances where you cannot eject from your ship apart from weapons timer?   
---
I tested on SiSi, and as long as your weapons timer is down, you can eject no matter if you are being shot, disrupted, scrammed, locked, etc.
---
Obviously this answer is a bit silly, however the streaming initiative dead put an emphasis on the new invasion which trains and encourages small gang fleets. people may not realize it but these new PVE systems being introduced actually embolden people to enter into PVP proper. So I would say that they are doing things, but I suppose it's kind of a hard answer. you could say that they are going to put in a fleet finder but a lot of people would find that ridiculous. That being said, I have seen several successful pick up groups within the invasions. Again this is giving experience to FCS and an opportunity to fly as a team in a situation that's as close to PVP as one is likely to get without the real thing.
---
Does anyone actually enjoy Eve anymore or is it just sunk cost fallacy?   CCP gives no fucks about their customers, and the game play reflects that.
---
You can buy a Jita Abysal permits from "Tikktokk Tokkzikk"
---
As a new player your job is to learn the game. there is nothing you can do and there is nothing that you can lose that will be painful in the long run. Find out what you want to do any and then begin to specialize into that field. Do not let anyone tell you what Eve is or isn't, or what you should or shouldn't be doing. however, once you do figure out what you want to do you should definitely listen to advice for the best way to do what you desire to do.
---
Absolutely not.  Game is trash and CCP acts more a pimp than police to bots.  
---
Game sucks, CCPS sucks, and the free SP is A FUCKING LIE
---
God I wish that was in almost any language OTHER than javascript
---
Well, people eventually going to need a pure "evil government" to hate and mostly, make fun at
---
That hasn't changed for like, the past a century at least
---
First Europeans hate each other, then Third Reich, then CCCP, then China
---
Get on with the train
---
When it was first released tier four and five gave suspect flags. During the into the abyss event last Summer the triglavian hacked the galnet system and removed the suspect flag permanently
---
Arranged fights are completely different matter, but you guys have temp blues. As long as you're teamed up with a side in the conflict you're not NPSI, you're NBSI.
---
You just described 90% of mobile games.
---
This. L4 blitz with tengu probably is the best, and you can go with a uni tank and be safer from ganker 
---
Or you do full timer burner, that makes good profit as well
---
some people backstabbed some other people who thought they were all friends, and stole all their shit.

Besides :D CCP started out Icelandic ... yet we all had to learn English to be able to play EVE ...
---
Not the EU, definitely not haha
---
I think it has to do with the P in PI
---
For when you lose a freighter every 90 days?
---
Can you fit that to something that‚Äôs not a jackdaw?
---
I'll buy that
---
So, does the Jackdaw still have a propulsion mode? And can you fit the propulsion mode onto other ships?
---
Tell him he is stupid for gating a dread into M-O and *then jumping a* ***Nyx*** *in to save it when it inevitably gets tackled* maybe?
---
it's definitely worth getting into - don't compare yourself to 10y+ players, just know that some of the best active PvP'ers in the game currently have not played for very long at all.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Clone_states explains the f2p element pretty well. you can train a certain skillset that is around 20 million skill points, it allows you to fly a ton of different things, but there are limits. it's not nearly as restricting as level 20 in WoW, you can do a lot of 'endgame' things in EVE with 20m SP
---
~~thats the joke~~

I look forward to seeing you guys keep your word and seeing you shoot ships and toast sov in this constellation right here to get fights:

They got static rolled to me, saw that I am active and set a camp on their side to get me if I try to roll it.

---
500M and its yours xD
---
No \^\^
---
**Background**:
---
Eve is somewhat unusual among MMOs in that there is a developer-sponsored method of exchanging real-world money for in-game currency. Many games restrict monetary purchases to some alternative currency used for buying Skins or other game-store items, but in Eve you can exchange this currency for ISK, the currency players use to buy and sell items from each other. This allows an easy valuation of items to the real-world dollar value of them. To keep the game's market stable, you cannot earn real-world money in this system - only spend it.
---
Why is this important? Because in Eve, when an item is destroyed in combat or stolen from you, it is *gone*. There is no way to recover it. You need to buy a new one. Most items can be built by players, but there are a handful of ships out there which were handed out as special rewards and so cannot be replaced once destroyed. For this reason, expensive items are often stored in shared hangars where you can limit what other players have access to them. The only way to get in is to earn the trust of the hangar owner, and have him set you to allowed.
---
**Blueprint Originals**
---
At this point I also have to divert and explain Blueprint Originals (BPOs): BPOs are the "template" players use to create new items from raw materials. While they're fairly common today, in the early years of Eve they were astoundingly expensive and rare. A BPO would be the prized possession of a group of players.
---
This was particularly true of "Tech 2" BPOs: Rare items handed out by the developers, which (like the ships above) could not be replaced if lost. "Tech 2" items are improved and specialized versions of ships and equipment players use. Today there are alternative means of "Inventing" Tech 2 items, but at the time this story takes place the only option was to be lucky enough to receive a T2 BPO from a lottery: A prize of incomparable value.
---
**What happened?**
---
As the article lays out, a group of players infiltrated the corporation (player organization, equivalent to a Guild in many other games) of another astoundingly wealthy player. They earned the trust of the CEO - the "guild leaders" equivalent - and so gained access to the corporation's hangars.
---
When the moment came, they simultaneously attacked their target while she was vulnerable in her rare and valuable ship, and used other characters to empty the corporation wallet ("guild bank") and hangars of the highly valuable items within, including several Tech 2 BPOs which were completely irreplaceable.
---
**A note on Eve culture:**
---
Today, it's something of a given that virtually any player group of reasonable size and influence has one or more spies in it. Players learn hard and fast - and from stories like this - not to give access to their stuff out freely. In 2005, however, the game's community was still developing. Using a long-term spy like this, to manipulate a target into vulnerability, was unheard of - and the value of the items destroyed or recovered made it doubly shocking.
---
Happened 14 years ago when 30 billion isk was thousands of dollars
---
Ye it has xD
---
&gt;Test aren't idiots  
---
Press X to doubt
---
Get your memes right.  Besides the guy has already mined 4 new titians in delve.
---
I think you should think about why chinese players are coming to the international version of the game. You may come to a realization as to why they have not as such been embraced by that community as you would like.
---
PP being annoying is the only thing that keeps it profitable
---
Yea, I've had the same thing. After I close the game and launcher, the launcher stays open in the background and I have to end it via task manager so I can run it again.
---
Apparently same for Spectre Fleet.
---
I still had 4.8m SP unallocated from the event boosters back at Christmas, and then the recent 16 day log in rewards.  Injecting Recons V had been on my list since I returned to the game a year ago (had it on my original toon and it was so much fun).  I just hadn't had an excuse to actually inject it until yesterday.
---
Yes, some of us still enjoy eve.
---
Didn't CCP only temporary remove the suspect flag to iterate on it?
---
citation please
---
I mention the breacher's oddness. Each race has two combat frigates: one bonused defensively, and one bonused offensively (relatively speaking. All defensive combat frigates other than the punisher have some offensive bonuses as well). For Gallente, Amarr, and Caldari, the defensive frigate is the assault frigate hull, and the offensive frigate is the special snowflake/basis for the stealth bomber. For Minmatar, inexplicably, this is reversed. I guess a more appropriate fix would be to make the Breacher the AF template, since the Breacher doesn't really feel like the archetypal Minmatar ship in terms of mechanics, but *aesthetically* it's the Minmatarest.
---
And the Amarr not being too big on drones is the point, really. Because they can't pick a secondary weapon system they're all over the place. T1 ships all treat drones as their secondary weapon system (though their cruisers do the weird Bellicose shuffle thing the Minmatar's do). And their secondary ewar *are* nosses, but that can't really be a secondary weapon system (though they do uncharacteristically show up in the t1 line). 
---
Fair point about the VFI. And the MNI gets a drones bonus. Rip. It's still odd how the CNI doesn't get its secondary ewar (which we mentioned, features heavily even in t1)
---
What makes you say they're temp blues? Literally during the duration of a fleet fight and then it's back to normal. They're not blues - that was one of my ground rules before the idea was even formed.
---
Ccp intentionally lowers insurance payout on capital ships, stain guy notices lower payout
---
:surprised pikachu:
---
this shouldn't be so hard to understand. 
---
Not Purple Shoot It
---
is it not purple? shoot it
---
is it purple? don't shoot it
---
nothing is keeping you from working with other entities as long as they're in the same fleet. And yeah there's nothing wrong with creating content and trying to stir shit up to get said content, but calling it NPSI when the fleets are different is kinda disingenuous (although if we are to take rocket x's comment on rc logi being damped out by SF you might say this entire exchange is kinda moot)
---
at the end of the day it is a technicality, yes, but when your identity relies that heavily on such a definition -and that's not a bad thing btw- you're bound to have to deal with it.
---
Again, implying we have blues, which we don't have. We coop during fights and the rest is fair game. I fully expect them to shoot our random roams and people fuckin about, vice versa.
---
no problem, Lets see you find me now!
---
That is honestly all any of us gives a shit about. Nobody in SF cares two cents for any diplo or whatever, we just want more shit to shoot and fun to be had. In this case, we just wanted to team up to fight a bigger fish. Outside of said fleet fights, everything's fair game.
---
Decent fit, you can ditch one of the computers and carry precision missles with you, switch to them for hard to hit targets, and put a second prop in the empty spot. Either MWD or AB, double prop utility is really nice.
---
Maybe I'm taking the post headline too literally but I thought China had their own separate universe servers ?
---
Not quite, Provi formed muninns to defend sov from RC gila fleet AND spectre harb fleet. It's just funny that they willingly fight a muninn fleet and then cry about how we're using muninns.
---
NSH welped a dread bomb to us a few days ago and havent been seen since.
---
it sucked and now its dead. all the players from there are in TQ now.
---
I mean we're literally the defenders... If you lack the brain cells to bring a muninn counter when you're attacking with 2 different fleets then expect to be memed upon when to enter the meat grinder and die.

Looks like people are being caught up in a DDoS mitigation effort.  CCP has advised using a VPN when this happens.

No, I'm a pvper, I don't want to ruin my -2.0 security status just for trying out the new gameplay content

how do i delete other people's comments?
---
Touche. Not all test then.
---
It sounds like a stretch, but I would highly suggest you find a group either in nullsec or a wormhole that is in USTZ (saw your replies). With that much SP you should get out of highsec and really experience what the game has to offer.
---
Try out some PvP if you fancy, and if not there are plenty of lucrative things to do in null or w-space that will get you more ISK than horrible L4 highsec missions. There's a corp out there that you will enjoy, you just have to find it.
---
Check /r/evejobs (I think it's that), or the EVE forums for corps recruiting.
---
So one side in the conflict is (and will be during this campaign) blue during the fight(s) and the duration of the campaign‚Ä¶ and that is NPSI? Not likely. You have to make difference between actively being involved in the conflict and always supporting one side from having fun fleets where everyone on the grid is target. NPSI is neutral, doesn't pick sides in conflicts, does not support anyone's expansion, blows stuff up for fun and does not give a fudge about NRDS, NBSI or any other political cr\*p. Sorry, but what you guys are doing atm has nothing to do with NPSI.
---
Thanks.
---
literally worst shit post ever.... Biomass mate
---
nobody particularly pretends QFC is neutral
---
congrats you just got a very expensive collectable
---
You're staging out of their citadel, doing what they want done, but you're not blue with them and therefore not NBSI, got it. Just gud fites. 100% believable.
---
Im confused so that means propulsion mode is a module now
---
Lived in Low-Sec for quite some time with my alliance. Honestly best time I ever had and I wouldn't think it'd have been living in Null.   
---
I think people need to get rid of the attitude that Null-Sec is the endgame of Eve as it's not... it's just different.  
---
I'll hit you up!
---
oh no, your epeen.
---
You can loot skillbooks and datacores, which sell for a lot.
---
If you always coop with the same side during this campaign it is not NPSI.
---
Like what you can do there if it is lacking so basic things like gate to Stain?
---
i would have described 90% of mobile games if i had included being able to pay2win by buying resources with real world money. 
---
i was thinking more on the lines of factorio vs. humans or eve online, but owning a system means planting a station in it, building NPC miners, then building npc combat ships that you send out to kill miners in the nearest non allied system. you have to balance miners and combat ships because too little miners and you wont get enough resources. too little combat ships and you cant field an effective defense fleet. 
---
as the number of systems grows you have to also balance logistical ships that move resources around. all resources dont exist in a single system so you have to mine, say, ice from one system and move its refined parts to other system to keep industry going
---
further idea if we keep the setting in space: lore says that all of the npc ships are a hivemind of drones controlled by the player character who chills out in a mother ship that acts like a titan-rorq combo. you are large, slow, can put out a lot of dps, very tanky, and can boost the drones for better tank/dps/mining speed but also there is permadeath. you are really hard to kill but if you do you have to rebuild you empire from scratch. 
---
you start by chewing up entire belts of ore in minutes until you can build a station to protect yourself in, then from the station you turn out miners and combat ships and keep spreading to nearby systems. 
---
articles would written about major players owning hundreds of systems getting headshot and losing everything
---
heck this game would be really fun
---
Rofl. Khm i was doing srp payouts with ristlin than trony took over. Than whoever. Core didn‚Äôt have access to the isk. Core had his personal isk for srp and market scamming he did. Stop  trying to be the next spin master.  U were a second grade fc that did bashes @ most. Ur skill as an fc isnt half if what that kid jin was back than :)
---
I'll delete it for you lol  :D
---
The thing is, despite some big battles that might have been significant to the parties involved, LS is not about big conflicts or massive battles, is all about your ragtag group of friends having a fight over literally nothing. A fight where each pilot's skills matters and can determine the outcome.
---
It's tackling a clear bait ship just to see what comes out of it, while screaming for your buddies roaming nearby to come help, while each +1 in local makes your blood pump because it could be reinforcements, unexpected help or just some random indy guy moving PI around.
---
There's no sov, no evictions and little to no politics, just you, your ship and your friends looking to make things explode. You never know who is coming your way or what could warp to the grid while you try to kill someone you happened to catch distractred.
---
It's not about big meaninfull fights, it's about getting your blood pumping while you slide into a plex, wondering if that Tristan inside will fight or run, or if it is a neut fit or a kite fit and you are fucked.
---
Nope removed for good. When the new Agency was on Sisi they used the old strings so it looked like it was coming back, but it was confirmed that it was not.
---
Doing what they want done? That's funny. Last I checked we were the ones starting this up and organizing it. We've done one cooperated fleet and have barely started, despite the fact we'll be running a ton of our own fleets, and immediately people are jumping to conclusions.
---
I remember you from back then Maded. It was a while back, so I might be hazy on some of the details, but I do know that Jin does not mention you when he talks about who trained him in those days. Sorry bro.
---
Provi never had an official "head FC" in those days of course, but like most such things that didn't usually stop there being a defacto one. The official position we had was FC Coordinator which was filled by Ristlin and he was actually quite active in the role at the time iirc.
---
Jin, as mentioned, was relatively junior but coming along nicely as the war progressed. Core, just starting to build his cult of personality, lead many large fleets but, of course, the real hero FC of that war was the great Hidetoshi.   
---
I jest of course. Hide was one of our top FCs, core was another, especially after hide left in a small fountain of drama. Jin and vysh started doign a lot towards the end, especially the planning backing up core.  
---
Maded was a provi FC at the time. He did some fleets. I've gotta confess that I don't really remember anything about what fleets he was doing. 
---
He says he left on good terms, there's a few people who were in his alliance when he left who are still here and still angry at him over how he left, so maybe not entirely good terms... I dunno

Any tips?

Yup, a tank bonus would be what the brutix has, a bonus to rep amount. That bonus is much stronger for an active tanked ship than a resistance bonus as it will not be stacking penalized the way resists are.

Actions speak louder than words, and first impressions mean a lot.

We've done one cooperated fleet and have barely started, despite the fact we'll be running a ton of our own fleets, and immediately people are jumping to conclusions that we're just gonna be 24/7 blueing up with RC/HTP.
---
Fair argument. I was a bit surprised they stripped it of the range bonus, but then I saw the Nergal.
---
how u managed to unfit it?
---
Like I said elsewhere: We've done one cooperated fleet and have barely started, despite the fact we'll be running a ton of our own fleets, and immediately people are jumping to conclusions that we're just gonna be 24/7 blueing up with RC/HTP.
---
If you want a low sec status just grab a smartbomb and go to anywhere in highsec that isnt a trade hub undock (ccp will ban for that) and viola: a nice low sec status for you!
---
Like I said elsewhere: We've done one cooperated fleet and have barely started, despite the fact we'll be running a ton of our own fleets, and immediately people are jumping to conclusions that we're just gonna be 24/7 blueing up with RC/HTP. Hell, we've even talked about the idea of setting up the fleets together like your own suggestion. It's been one fleet and people are just making instant conclusions on waht this is.

There's no level system really. We have skillpoints but they're mostly horizontal diversity. While veterans will be able to fly/afford larger and more specialized ships, the combat mechanics balance so that they are not straight upgrades. I can fly all the subcapitals and personally enjoy flying the smallest ship size, frigates, most.
---
So it's not like joining other MMOs and being the level 1 dude among level 120s.
---
I'm fairly certain when current CCP holds a meeting to decide what content they're going to focus on, they say "OK guys, what is the absolutely dumbest thing we can pour resources into?" and goes from there.
---
I'm not sure where is the risk involved in PI. You don't have to be near planet to set it up just need to undock with correct command center.  Rest is done without undocking. Collections are also risk free.
---
They're also just an impression, and not the actual truth :)
---
This is EVE
---
There shouldn't be any. External effects can't prevent someone from ejecting from a ship. Targeting a ship will prevent anyone but the original owner from boarding it however.
---
There was a rebalance to T3D over a year back which fixed things like the 3.5km/s, 300dps, 20kehp Svipul.
---
They changed the modes, and modes are actually an invisible module that applies bonuses and gets swapped on mode change.
---
So after all the modes got revamped, the old modes get unfit and kicked into the item hangar. They're useless of course because no ship will take them.
---
I farmed my pure -10 sec status without use any of such lame things.         
---
I created tickets asking CCP to give people ability to lock the damn sec status as you need to kill those pointing rats and they give you sec status boost.        
---
CCP didn't care.
---
I just try to undock then it happens.
---
Interesting, I was killed earlier because I could get out of my ship with my training pod (my fault for forgetting to reclone) wouldn't let me out

Used to be a pretty common bug. Doesn't seem to do anything but give you a weird and pointless module.
---
test is infested with botters.
---
It makes sense that it would, but maybe at a decreased rate because of how many there are to shoot.
---
I'd say that's reasonable.
---
The "stuffs" produced in PI have to be on planet or in the orbiting outpost for someone to get their hand on it.  That means at some point you have to warp there in a ship.  That means you have to find the "undock" button.
---
not sure what you think risk free means, ppl try and scram me all the time when im collecting
---
Same here, was wondering why my whole computer was crawling, opened up task manager and saw 5 eve launchers eating up my CPU
---
You do, which is why merging tractor beams and salvagers into the same module makes sense from my point of view

Not going to shut up about real events because your government is cencoring each and everything to keep it's population under control. Even if it's just a meme.

That's the point where your government actually wins.

What kinda of question is this? 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Why can't we manufacture modules and ships on planets?
---
lately they have been fucking up on fueling things so their bridges die without reinforcing, the stations die in one timer and they keep anchoring more than one jammer at a time which lets us just kill the offline ones without a cycle. Maybe they haven't figured out how defending sov works since this is the first time they have ever really needed to defend more than a handful of systems or structures?
---
I want to use Triglavian to name my next alt dammit!

You didn't have a combat timer but still couldn't eject?

Need to undock more often.

That‚Äôd be a good thing?

Can you guys come up with a new meme already?
---
Also, even with the mighty Elo Knight himself, pandemic horse couldn't take a single system in branch... If branch is so full of bots, why was it so difficult for you to take sov? Was it because the bots fought back? Or because they are real dudes?
---
Anyway, good luck defending the space you've got left.

Haha, I love how someone who knows nothing about rorqs just learned how to properly kill rorqs, but OP is complaining cause they did it wrong.

I'm very new to this game. I'm just wondering why every single billboard has the same glasses advert playing?

If branch has only bots operating in the region, why couldn't horse take a single system when they invaded branch with the help of Elo?

Bots don't defend sov as far as I know... Real dudes does.
---
I've been looking, but I haven't found any.
---
So there are spies in every corporation?I am only familiar with world of warcraft and while guild banks have occasionally gotten empty,it isn't that common and usually will ruin your reputation on that server.Why are there so many "spies" and how do you prevent them?Can someone destroy your ship while you are offline?

He's also been caught lying to the community on many occasions yet so many people still seem to love him.  No wonder EVE is in its current state.

Even though lowsec definitely has that sort of rough and tumble fights - politics, evictions, systems takeovers, big battles have existed from the beginning. While big meaningful fights aren't the norm like nullsec, there are meaningful fights and history there.

The vast majority of spies are just for information gathering and don't actively steal things.

The incursion groups are brilliant. Deffo worth a try. They talk you through everything step by step so you always know what to do. Really gave me a boost when I first came back to Eve.

I would say check out Warp to me first, see if you like it then try other groups.

Find Mcav, HK and lzhx sometimes, and I've seen tdsin also.
---
The worst part is that most of this stuff was in the game at some point.   I could understand after pissing all of their money away into other projects that they fired too many people and so the UI is neglected, but they actively make changes that are worse than the previos; the CCReee UI team literally regresses.

4-5 fleets a night, plenty of killmails to be had, drunk coms best coms. The occasional NC undock attempt usually ends in kills, yeah its been a blast so far but its early, its only week 2 if you count the first week we based in 6rcq
---
Is broadcast just not a thing anymore?
---
LOVE IT, thanks for sharing the WH content  not enough people do of get burned by wingspam
---
For me it is more of a nostalgic thing I guess. I started playing eve because a friend I knew from another game dragged me into it. After the first few months sitting in highsec with him doing pve and mining (lol) he introduced me to 3 other friends of him with whome he were in an alliance earlier. So we formed our own little 4 man corp and moved into 1 lowsec system we declared our home. Unlucky that the alliance that staged in the system wasn't that happy about it. So we fought them in some skirmishes and after 3 weeks they contacted us and wanted to be blue. For someone who hasn't playing eve for that long it was pretty awesome to be that annoying to an alliance as a 4 man corp that they wanted to be blue.
---
And from there on I lived the most of my now 13 years of eve in lowsec. From smaller groups like my first corp to bigger alliances like dead terrorists.
---
I'm not quite so vehemently against it, but I do agree that an option to turn it off would be nice. That being said, it's the same size and position as the logoff and jump fatigue timers so it really doesn't take up space you don't already use.
---
The X-Type LSB is under size. If XLSB too spendy, consider using a Dread Gurista one. Also Dread Gurista SBA.
---
Just broadcasting is much less efficient than calling it out too, specially when there starts to be more than a few possible targets.
---
I mean, you should be broadcasting anyways for clarity.
---
&gt;Either make it so that when someone activates a entosis link that he enters siege mode and is stuck in place for say 10, 15 or 20 minutes, all you need to do is add -100% velocity bonus to the entosis links.
---
The last time I checked, Entosis Links prevent you from warping for the duration of a cycle. In addition, I believe that you can just Entosis the same node someone else is toasting to prevent the toast.
---
The hell is a Dommy?
---
And the gif is broken on mobile at least.
---
Yes, they have, but they are only meaningfull for those involved... or well, to people trying to understand LS from  NS point of view. Of course, the "big players" in Lowsec play like Nullsec alliances (or very similar to), but that's not what most people in LS do, nor it is that relevant for most of the population.
---
Report as a bug?
---
I had a combat timer which it warned me about, as expect, so I de-aggressed and waited it out, when it was down it just did nothing each time I tried, no message or anything. I was not aggressed for at least a minute while I continued to try and eject.
---
You can. You use it to make fuel blocks and nanite paste for example.
---
Entosis only prevents you from warping during it's cooldown, it's only for like 5 minutes and during this time a T1 frigate can burn like 500km away from the ihub. They need to time people are stuck and decrease the speed people can move at while running it dramatically
---
If you can fly a Nestor you can get a few hundred mil/hr in a c5 wormhole depending on how it's split. Get into a leshak and or dual box or triple box leshaks it gets way better. 
---
A nag in c5 space earns about a bil an hour and it's relatively safe assuming you're at least somewhat competent in checking the signature window and spamming V.
---
concord are lazy bricks. letting us deal with trigs but if you dare to hit someone  by mistake. they swoop by and give you a concord token (even while you fight off trigs) than cill on grind and enjoying the show..
---
We weren‚Äôt really going for sov at the stage we were at, we have a weaker AUTZ than a literally all AUTZ pair of alliances in Siberian Squad and Ranger Regiment, and at the time we weren‚Äôt getting any meaningful support from outside while also fighting a war in hisec and dealing with the goon ‚Äúdeployment‚Äù to geminate. Doesn‚Äôt hurt that RR and SBSQ had significantly higher numbers of supercapital pilots available for large timers and were willing to alarm clock to fight in our TZ.
---
I mean, doesn‚Äôt take a rocket surgeon to figure out that if you‚Äôre distracted and disadvantaged that it‚Äôs going to be difficult to take territory in an offensive war. It didn‚Äôt exactly go badly for us, it simply took too long to make progress and we ran out of time before having to deal with changing situations.
---
Meanwhile, botting isn‚Äôt exactly a disadvantage in a defensive war bb. It keeps adms high despite potential threats that might dissuade people without illicit incomes from risking ships to do that work.
---
&gt; Anyway, good luck defending the space you've got left.
---
I‚Äôm not aware of is having lost any territory in the last year. Even if you mean panfam as a whole, PB/Fade was mostly a defensive effort made by the North to defend Sort, given that the territory was totally vacated by Horde when it left. Technically all that space went to Darkness. who were so utterly incapable of defending it that they had to have Co2 move into it purely to be a speed bump, which ended in Sort buying his way into vassalage under Goons.
---
Meh. I'd join npsi fleets more often if they did more than just roam provibloc. Especially because whenever provibloc gets invaded it's my assets and capital that I am sending to provibloc to assist it.
---
&gt; Why are there so many "spies" and how do you prevent them?
---
The "grind" part of eve is primarily money related, and bad social behavior is encouraged.   Most thieves are not an organized force trying to impact an enemy - they're just people who enjoy playing the asshole and looking for an easy way to circumvent the grind.  If we only talk about players who are actively working to impact their enemy's effectiveness - then yeah, "spies" aren't super common.  If we're including anyone working confidence to take things, then "spies" are SUPER common. If we include people who throw a random alt in their enemy corp just to gather information but don't really impact the enemy in any way, then spies are in every major corporation. 
---
Preventing them - Eve has an API that lets others view the wallet history and in-game mail history of a character, but that's easily circumvented.  Mainly, you just maintain control of the assets and delegate access to them only when necessary.  The real talk truth, though - if someone is enough of a sociopath, they'll eventually manage to earn enough trust to steal things. 
---
&gt; Can someone destroy your ship while you are offline?
---
No.  They can only destroy/steal assets that they have access to.  Personal assets in a station can't be stolen, and ships disappear from space very shortly after you log off.  The person in your original story was given purposeful access to the eve-equivalent of a guild vault.
---
Also, to the dude who asked about my flair:

&gt; Eve is somewhat unusual among MMOs in that there is a developer-sponsored method of exchanging real-world money for in-game currency. Many games restrict monetary purchases to some alternative currency used for buying Skins or other game-store items, but in Eve you can exchange this currency for ISK, the currency players use to buy and sell items from each other. This allows an easy valuation of items to the real-world dollar value of them. To keep the game's market stable, you cannot earn real-world money in this system - only spend it.
---
Eve was one of the first major players to do this, but it's not at all unusual any more.   Everquest, WoW, and most of the others have all adopted a PLEX-alike system.
---
That said, PLEX is irrelevant to this story - it didn't exist yet, when this happened.
---
Good god is it really that bad? I feel sorry for you that this little icon is so troubling. Seriously don't you have more pressing issues in your life to rage about?
---
I'm not sure if you are familiar with wow,but would this be comparable to people that jump from guild to guild to get geared?Also what happens in Eve when a player gains a bad reputation from "manipulating" others?
---

---
Utterly useless adition, as usual.
---
You're staging out of their citadel and Maded is asking for HACs on Reddit. You're being paid, it might not be in isk, but you are definitely being paid.
---
Ccp bans for smartbombing jita?
---
Not 100% sure, but, IIRC, CCP fired the guy or team responsible for the billboard adverts and never bothered to assign them to another developer / team? Something like that.
---
We had some relatively good coordination that night. We just did not have the numbers. And I ran that as an Alpha in an Augoror. I have since subscribed.
---
That is strange, I don't know what might cause that. If you were just worried about getting your pod out though, just setup a warpout tab, and spam warp as you are dying. Unless there are bubbles on field your pod should warp before anything can target it.
---
To draw a WoW comparison, pretend all WoW gear was tradeable and this was back during classic WoW.
---
The guy spent a year convincing a guild leader he was friends.  The guild leader let him hold his Windfury to take a screenshot, and the guy stole it then logged to an alt and cleared out a guild bank filled with raid gear.
---
To further the WoW comparison - also pretend that this type of behavior is normal and common, is expected of pretty much everyone, and is encouraged by the developers.
---
So a lot of the player base don't see the sociopath thief as having the "bad" reputation - they see the person who trusted the sociopath thief as having a bad reputation.
---
But that said - if someone gets a bad reputation, they just make a new character, or (back then) bought a new character legally with some of the stolen money.
---
Zero velocity is the stupidest idea that I have heard of. But yeah, a reduced or capped speed would be meaningful and I agree. Zero speed is absolutely stupid
---
Met Wingspan, it was actually nice encounter.
---
But, of course, there is some corps that prefer blob only.
---
Is this a dev team or a player faction? The only logical conclusion i reached about these billboards is that one player bought every one in the game and played the same ad on all of them for their glasses company or something.
---
restrict the entosis link modules that can be fitted only on tech2 tech3 cruisers and tech2 battlecruisers  or t1 battleships ..
---
this will not only  increase risk versus gain but encourage groups to bring more ships for saving the ihub/tcu. 
---
right now entosis link can be fit to most of ships and they can mwd away to avoid eventual fights... with battleships or battlecruiser or cruisers this will be completly impossible
---
Is it a bug though \*thinking emoji
---
All I can say is:
---
J-space makes me cautious.
---
Null makes me leery.
---
Low terrifies me.
---
Yo near the end of the video, when that stork fired his MJFG why did he boosh but you did not? You were within 6km.
---
&gt;Please make it so actual pvp is involved in sov warfare.
---
They capped speed at 4000 ms, people can do a lottt of distance in 5 minutes at 4000 ms
---
Mail me ingame and I'll link it to you
---
You need polarized oracles, bombers and a lot of time, if you wanna play it safe just look for lowpower structures and bash away. Make sure to scan them before to find out how aids the timers are
---
Or maybe you should learn to fly.
---
Honestly, my guess is that he uses dreadnoughts for their intended purpose, while you consider the point of EvE to be flying the biggest ship you can afford into a cloud of red trying to make the biggest ruckus you can. Honestly, both are fun, but I prefer the empire-building side of EvE to roaming null and lowsec. And accordingly I have 50 kills and zero losses over the past three years, and massive growth in my corporation
---
I can't seem to reproduce it but the best way to help CCP would be to do the following:
---
* Open up task manager
---
* Go to the "details" tab
---
* If the client itself is staying open look for "evefile.exe", if the launcher is staying open look for "evelauncer.exe"
---
* Right click &gt; create dump file
---
A dialog will say where it saved the dump, attach that to your ticket.
---
Gallente: Myrmidon, thorax, vexor
---
Caldari: Caracal (tanked), Moa, Drake, Ferox
---
Minmatar: Rupture, Cyclone(Iguess), hurricane(close range),
---
Amarr: Omen, Maller, Harbinger
---
Navy cruisers: All cruisers except vexor navy issue(Invasions dislike drones)/
---
Navy BC: rail brutix is fine, navy hurricane is good at close range, Harbinger navy issue, Drake navy issue
---
One of the biggest issues we heard repeatedly during war dec discussions was new players not understanding when their corp was war decced and what that meant.  For groups that weren't organized enough to have somebody update a corp MOTD with war status, it was a common theme.  
---
This is an easy fix that lets folks know whether they've been war decced and removes the possibility of people dying because they didn't realize they were at war.
---
Dominix
---
That sounds crazy realistic.I wonder why in wow they view all this behavior as completely unacceptable,it adds a whole form of realism into the game.I no longer play wow,but I wonder how different it would be if the game and the community gave you more freedom.
---
I think Hidalgo was around 30milsp. Bare bones naglfar dread for krabbing. So probably around there.
---
Isn‚Äôt it the the same as crime watch timers, jump fatigue timers, log off timers???    You‚Äôre not losing any vertical real estate there.
---
Maybe make a skill plan on Evemon instead of asking other people to do the work....
---
It'll even telll you how many injectors exactly it will cost.
---
Scripted DScan looks nice.
---
A great thing tbh because sometimes people don't know whether they are at war or not, let alone those who forget about it since most wars are just nonsense for us Nullsecers...
---
Never used Evemon. Maybe take that into account before being a dick about it?
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I know right? lol....
---
Never used Evemon. I'll look into it, now.
---
also combat timers with players and npcs. no real estate is being lost.
---
Kl well then yeh, Evemons skill planner is exactly what you want.
---
Why do you consider caldari?  
---
Currently it is considered less desired due to bonuses/weponsystems those ships use. 
---
Also 20-30mil sp is pretty damn good dread/carrier pilot.
---
The entities range is 30km so if they burn 500km they won't be making progress... the current mechanic forces you to stay close to make progress and prevents warp for the duration. I don't think a velocity penalty is needed.
---
13 days ago you were screaming to toast delve? guess you don't like it happening to you.
---
Evemon. Allows you to make a skill plan and will tell you how much ISK you'll need for the books &amp; total amount of injectors
---
Just what I'm going for, at this point.
---
Dont forgot about the jump dessie toaster...boosh away and youre gone...anti frigate intie killer.
---
Yes, you can always narrow it down digging a little deeper and looking at how many kills someone has with that ship, where, against what and so on.
---
Well used zkill is an amazing tool for both intel and deciding how to fit your ships.
---
&gt; Eve was one of the first major players to do this, but it's not at all unusual any more.
---
Fair, I was actually thinking about GW2 and its gems-to-gold system when I wrote this.
---
&gt; That said, PLEX is irrelevant to this story - it didn't exist yet, when this happened.'
---
PLEX didn't, but Eve Time Codes (ETC) did - and their ISK-to-USD conversion is how value estimations in have always been done. I believe at the time $30 would net you 2 15-day codes, although I forget what they were trading for in 2005.
---
But this is bad decision.        
---
You have 4 dreads.  3 use guns and 1 missiles.       
---
If you train/inject the missile one you need to train gunnery skills until you can consider some other dread.      
---
If you go for any of the "gun" based dreads you will have most of the skills ready if you are going to train 2 other.              
---
Next thing is caldari carrier.       
---
It have resist bonus ... but also bonus to ECM fighters and CCP fucked hard ECM.         
---
Next thing is what you get in terms bigger toys.          
---
Wyvern.       
---
It is nice ship if you want to run shield fleet boosts, but simply bad if you want to do PVE or PVP at this level.         
---
What i am saying is that your safest way is to do a minmatar carrier and dread.            
---
Why :                
---
* niddy and hel are pretty good in terms PVE and PVP          
---
* naglfar is considered the best dread (selectable damage and no cap use on the guns, also this arty alpha strike)             
---
* minmatar dread and carrier are shield based - aka you don't have to train armour so much         
---
The choice is yours. 
---
It is your choice
---
Caveat emptor, baby!
---
&gt;removes the possibility of people dying because they didn't realize they were at war.
---
never underestimate how unaware people can be, particularly new players who are probably overwhelmed, but this will certainly help.
---
How many Eve players does it take to change a lightbulb?
---
"AAR" : Goons blobbing 10 darwinism guys in Querius, Panfam arrives in muninn, goons dock up for 10 min then try to escape in rookie ships.
---
Ohhh, my bad.
---
Cosmos agents question. When making Caldari COSMOS, I am receiving standing increase for specific agent/corp and Caldari itself. But receiving minus standing for Gallente. No Gallente ships were killed, Just Cosmos npc.
---
Same stuff work vice versa, Gallente cosmos gives decrease for Caldari
---
Is it intended to be like this ? Or I missed smt. ?
---
&gt; I wonder why in wow they view all this behavior as completely unacceptable,it adds a whole form of realism into the game.
---
Wow is an entertainment product that specifically excludes the negative aspects and is marketed to people who want an enjoyable experience.  Eve is an entertainment product that specifically indulges people's negative behavior and is marketed to people who want to stop other people's enjoyment.
---
Different goal sets for different games.

---
Nobody has ever given me an answer as to why goons brag about having 100% SRP and being top of the MER but still act like losing a 100M ship will put them in the poorhouse.
---
at least they found the undock button in the end
---
their fc got told to dock up, didn't want that loss on their kb i guess
---
and goons run, in a non cyno jammed system, in thier space
---
usual shit
---
Wow come on CCP fix this?
---
In order to understand why lowsec matters I'll first draw a quick comparison to (sov) nullsec. When you undock your ship and decide to go on a roam into nullsec you're usually (in all fairness - there are exceptions) treated as an unwelcome intruder. From the moment they notice you their goal is: 1. Get everyone safe and 2. Lets make him not wanting to come back.
---
You go to lowsec and you feel like you're part of a small community that WANTS to fight. Everyone has their own styles and there is no meta that is set in stone. This is why nullsec players that come to lowsec often stand out like a sore thumb because they get salty when you didn't fit your ship the way they expected. It's full of traps, bait, cloaked smartbombers, gatecamps, l33t honorubru soloers, etc., etc. and this can be intimidating at first. But once you learn to live with all that it kind of feels like the last place in new eden where the sandbox is still very much alive.
---
oh wow a citadel what a massive thing that nobody in SF can afford. Asking for HAC's? You mean asking SF pilots to bring HAC's, something we've done more than plenty before? Hell, my own birthday fleet had something like 100 guys show up for cerbs?
---
Seriously, there isn't anything you can pay spectre with.
---
think the real importent question here is.. why do you have 513 notifications?!?
---
Provibloc has stepped up their game. My first realization that they had an FC of unusual caliber is when CVA sacrificed 3 PVP fit carriers to roll a hole to prevent our muninn fleet from joining the fight. We went home and CVA won their battle with something like 85% efficiency.
---
Wouldn't it be great if you could fit this to other ships ^^
---
But yeah just an amusing bug, I don't think it has any effect on the ship it came from or anything else.
---
It's the cryptomining they added alongside the 64-bit client /s
---
But everybody throws shit at everyone and everything constantly?

---
Yup. A great place for nullsec starters that do not want to want all the BS the bigger nullsec alliances have like prepping for war, sov defence, auth systems, you gotta use this 3th party tool or that 3th party tool, etc etc.
---
NRDS has always been the hateboner of Pamfam for many, many years. While Goons attacked provi to test the new sov system and test fought for the catch systems during the Hero Coalition wars Pamfam is the most active around provi. NC. took it once, Pamfam tried to get easy stations until Legacy happened, PL NC. always been attacking soon Provi sets up super cap production. RC loosing systems? No need to fear NC. is here! BB and Specter always choosing to side with Pamfam or RC, "insert bigthink here". 
---
And Seeing now an NC. guy in new leading Specter, oh lol what a surprise.

Was pretty funny, watching goons come bash one of our structures in OUR space 97 vs 10 bombers (the walnut) then run away like pansies when a bigger blobs of around 150 shows up. EVE I suppose

on second thoughts actually, if everyone was in a velator we would have wrecked those munnins, those reapers fucked it for us

if you want to talk about atrocities that's up to you, if you want to talk about video games, that's also up to you. there are plenty of communities out there, you'll find one you fit into. no one should expect other communities to adhere to their communities conversational standards though

Is this peak nc. posting? seems like their salt collecting tactic worked pretty well eh?
---
Wow has been described as a theme park experience, which I quite like as a description. The game is designed to be played the way the developers want you to. Eve isn't really any different in that regard, the developers just want you to play with as much freedom as possible.
---
it's funnier that panfam don't defend their own structures. I literally baked a potato waiting for them to show up yesterday. 
---
Turned out quite nicely, the outside was very crisp. I topped it with slow cooked beef and sun dried tomatoes in a red wine sauce, had a nice salad with it. Quite satisfying
---
i mean, goons wont stay in tribute,

and 'HAVE' in eve all comes down to isk.

Get rid of insurance. I fully agree. Too much isk in game anyway. If it exploded ....oh well...  Too bad. No payouts for you.
---
Why TF did they change it? Seems like a dumb dick of an idea.
---
You realise negative sec status doesn't have any meaning, right? All it says is that you shot first on a bunch of people. And you can smartbomb a gate in LS and collect a stack of negative sec status if you care about it.
---
Can I bring my Jackdaw?
---
Then you did it wrong and get a bigger fleet with some dedicated tractor/salvagers....
---
You only get a sec status bump from rats once per 6 minutes per system or something anyway.
---
Because CCP didn't actually consider how the mechanics of this invasion would interact with CONCORD or other high sec mechanics before releasing it.
---
So I haven't played Eve in a while, I always lose interest over time. So far what I've done is solo wormholing, Red Vs Blue PvP, and failing at being a pirate. I was in a null corp for a while too and that was fun.
---
So what I'm thinking, is if I get back into it, I'd want to try industry. However, I like the idea of mining too, despite it being so boring. The solution I was thinking of is to get a bunch of alts and make my own mining fleet, something like 11 accounts. 1 freighter/industry guy, and then 10 minerbros. IIRC a barge in high sec is like 100k isk/hr, so thats 1 mill/hr of microing a bunch of miners. My current character can pilot jump freighters, so once I get things set up if I'm enjoying it I'd try and move to null. 
---
Is this something that is still feasible? I know multi-boxing was outlawed, but I don't know the extent of it. Mining solo is boring and slow-paced, so I'm hoping to increase the interactivity by controlling a fleet.
---
No cheese? You monster.
---
Secondly, Why didnt you activate windows?!?
---
Seems like that this gate use razer technology
---
You can reset the drug timer by using jump clones on a cita. You can do that other and other again
---
Time zone tanking, mostly
---
Incursions have always been a boon because while they invade, they've offered their entire own PVE game. It's things to do, and they're not too super common.
---
Then came pirate forward bases... which are both a pain and don't actually drop anything worthwhile even if you do attack and kill them. They're just a pure disruption. 
---
Now alongside those two, there's the triglavians... loot and mechanics still to be seen, but i don't feel like they're getting anything near incursion levels of interaction from players and at the same time they're now the third RNG "sod off, player" those living in highsec can get thrown at them.
---
Basically, think from the perspective of someone who's not into pvp and primarily does pve. Just like you ,they want to do their own thing, enjoy the game the way they enjoy it. Most people like that tend to be solo or with a small group of friends. Having the game tell them "nope, you're not allowed to do your thing here even though it's clearly marked highsec, RNG said so" is about as fun to them as it would be for null to randomly have systems stop spawning rats, ores and sites until enough players sat out in space shooting festival launchers for the timer to tick past and the "event" to move on to somewhere else. For the people having it happen to them, it's mostly just seemingly there for annoyance and not much more. They don't get anything beneficial from it.
---
So yes, people living in highsec are hampered a lot more than your average player in a big coalition when different systems keep stacking up that disrupts everything they normally do. If a FOB spawns in null, an entire group can jump on it and potentially get valuable loot. In highsec, there's no hundreds people who will clear out the issue for you (aside from incursions, at least) and on top of that it's no value other than being allowed to do your normal thing again.
---
Meanwhile... it's a known fact there's plenty of people in null who are near 100% safe in what they do and won't ever be bothered. Put that together with people having their play hampered, and you'll have people either growing frustrated or just quitting.

Oh, you're not aware that panfam lost (ceded) Tenal over the weekend then? Shame...
---
Looks like the gate is having amid life crisis and trying to become a lightsaber!
---
The trig incursions at the moment last a day or two. If your gameplay is disrupted so much by a day or two of a system or two having an incursion, that's your fault. Try, I dunno, going next door.
---
Nothing better than this game
---
If people are too clueless to understand they're at war, this icon probably won't mean anything to them either.  Most clueless people don't even hover over icons or read tooltips.
---
are you 100% sure?
---
&gt;Because this was a half-assed expansion from CCP. They couldn't even release the full invasion, we are stuck in phase 1 all the time.
---
Its not a bug, it's a feature!
---
I've already gotten in the habit of going into task manager and ending the launcher after the client is running, seems to have fixed this problem, though it means you need to do it every time you play.
---
This is after hitting the corvette button multiple times in search of it
---
I died in the link you linked to a t4. 
---
The fit where I got ganked in was for t5. 
---
That t4 fit was also relatively cheap but also not as reliable - which was why the vedmak managed to kill me due to a piloting error. The megabling one is very hard to die to even with piloting errors and bad spawns.
---
Lutens look a lot different from what I remember
---
This.
---
No, only separate tics
---
Nope, wasn‚Äôt aware.
---
I stand corrected:
---
I‚Äôm aware of current Panfam members losing exactly one region this past year.
---
On the other hand we look to be gaining ER from Unspoken/Goons, which is infinitely more strategically valuable currently. 
---
Then again I‚Äôm not sure a wise man would declare Tenal lost just yet.
---
Member satellite
---
&gt;If your gameplay is disrupted so much by a day or two of a system or two having an incursion
---
it would be for a lot of people with not huge amounts of time to play. There's a reason a lot of people in highsec tend to be solo or small group; it's quite common for them to be more casual players rather than constantly active.
---
Again, think about it from your own end; if null systems got completely made useless for anything but waiting for days, there would be mass outcry. Sure, people can move but moving multiple ships mutliple jumps can be a hassle, isn't fun and in the end will most likely make the player play something else (for good) if it happens too much.
---
you're reading too much into it

Its useless for those of us in FW.

---
Unless they check their notifications and realize someone's declared war on them, it's not exactly obvious to a newer player.  Doesn't mean they're clueless, just not as seasoned as others. 
---
In any event, as others have noted, it's no more annoying than any of the other symbols up there.
---
you were never a Head FC in provi stop bullshitting people
---
You're forgiven since nullsec players tend to think everyone knows nullsec politics but to me and most of the people in black legion making nullsec harder and more dangerous to live in would be great. Eve isn't just a sandbox, it's a dangerous place. 
---
I also don't understand why the playstyle of the extremely casual players you're defending here is more important than the people who have flocked to triglavian incursions. You're essentially arguing that the people living in high sec should have to do absolutely nothing to use that space, and people who enjoy small and medium gang pve should just get fucked. Highsec is the ideal space for these incursions. We all know how effective putting faction citadels in nullsec was - only some groups get to run them. In highsec anyone can run them. If that causes some players who are so invested in one or two systems to quit over them being disrupted, fine by me.

Sounds like "pouge was"
---
I think that billboard came out when Citadels first dropped, so it was a way to get 'advertising' on them for a product Upwell were selling. They just never updated the NPC advertisments.
---
If they wanted everyone to have infinite SP they would just seed injectors. They clearly don't.
---
No I left gon
---
i dont do driveby talks
---
yessssss thanx and goodluck in fw
---
it's a bug for gods sake, it happens randomly out of like 500 undocks u might get one bugged undock where u get a popup and a "ship X mode" module in cargohold
---
Dude. Don't waste time doing that plan in highsec.
---
Start that right up in null somewhere. Inject your jf pilot into a boosting rorq, put your miners in exhumers and do it like a champ. The rorq compresses ore thus eliminating the need for a freighter to dump into. It will also be much safer and more lucrative than Orca boosting in highsec, plus the infrastructure out there now is mind-blowing.
---
Multiboxing is not outlawed, quite the contrary, ccp loves multiboxers. You just can't use input broadcasting. Which means individually controlling each ship.
---
lol I vaguely remember CCP saying they were going to remove those bugged modules from peoples hangars back when T3Ds were still a new thing, and in standard CCP fashion never got to it...
---
Give it a shot, best think you can do is join a new player friendly Corp (pandemic horde, Eve university, breve newbies, etc), ask questions and attend new player classes.

Hi there, my name is Redline XIII. I am one of the points of the spear that's going to be driving into Providence's heart. As clearly stated in the original post, our goals here are to create content in the region and give our pilots who have no interest in obligations to any particular alliance or group a taste of what nullsec warfare is like.
---
Regardless of what my ticker reads, there are no intere$ts of out$ide partie$ here. We are not being paid to run this incur$ion and no one requested that we do so. You have my word. I'll be honest, we sent a junior FC out for the first run along with some of the senior FCs and you certainly got the better of us. It was the first, and likely won't be the last, time the two of us really met for battle in this campaign and we didn't win.
---
As with all things, Spectre will adapt to warfare (that most of them have never experienced before) and we will hold our ground as best as we can against whatever you decide to throw at us. I'm looking forward to when I get the chance to stand up in your face and say "Bring it on."
---
Needless to say, good fight yesterday. We won't underestimate you next time. Come correct and so will we. Looking forward to our next encounter.
---
Gallente an Caldari don't like each other (see Faction Warfare) so the more one likes you the more the other dislikes you. Same for Amaar and Minmatar.
---
Also, Caldari and Amaar are friendly to each other as well as Gallente/Minmatar. So if you raise your caldari you will also see increases in your Amaar.
---
Factions have different kinds of relations with other factions throughout new eden and basicly your standings represent your "reputation" on a galaxy-wide scale.
---
Start relic hunting bud, i made my first Bill very fast in nullsec. Watch some videos about it first. Build a cashflow and then u Can afford to lose shit.
---
They really should have left it running an older track. Why would any gaming company leave it broken?
---
Its literally a BILLBOARD. Made to be super-visible.
---
Log out of Eve? No...Eve logs out of you now.
---
This is pretty good for newbies tbh.  As long as it remembers to turn off forever for vets...across all toons...
---
It's a great reminder for people that dont play each day to see that they have active wars. I do not, however, need to be reminded full time as a member of the gallente militia.
---
Sort Dragon anti racism pro tolerance and diversity respecter checking in. You racist.
---
You would have still been able to save your pod if you warped out after dying...
---
Not really, You should be able to easily do it, bots can do it without any issue.
---
Yeah, it is. There are reasons to bitch about this but the OP is hugely overstating them.
---
Oh faction mods are seeded now? Thats pretty cool.
---
Yeah I know CCP doesn't want infinite sp on SISI. I still think it is dumb to not have it.
---
Old unused pos dont drop anything, because 99.9999999% of the time its just the tower not the storage.
---
Ok cool, sounds like a good plan. 
---
What do you mean by inject? Its been a while. 
---
Does that mean I can take skills out of combat and put into industry? My "main" has years of combat skills and ship skills I barely use. Even when I PvP I'm always in t1 frigs and cruisers.
---
What's the cost of a rorqual? I feel like I'd be so much more helpful to an alliance building them ships.
---
On top of what these other guys said, you might also want to start out by bashing small, low-power citadels with an oracle or two as you learn. Plus, most of what you find in wh space are small citadels. I don't see many low-powered fortizars in wh space these days either which keans doing it like Olmeca described.
---
The comment section of this thread is the best one I've seen on this sub in a very long time.
---
I'm not- I just don't bitch and moan about everything CCP ever does because it doesn't cater to MY personal play style every time.
---
  How many EVE players does it take to change a light bulb?
---
  A: "CHAAAAAANGE?!!!!!"
---
The launcher stays open for me. Clients close fine but the launcher has to be killed manually. The actual window disappears and it looks like it's closed but when you go to run the game again it says it's already running.
---
Hahhahaha I've done more in a month of eve than you have your entire character lifetime.
---
Beta-EVE baby. Now dock up üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Yes... We honestly should. Especially with how many unaware americans ect there are.
---
Yep. That system is not tracked by API.
---
It's tied to payments after all.
---
the best faction for solo/small gang pvp is another game
---
Join the "Fits for L4 missions" chat channel, they have some decent recommendations. If you enjoy doing L4 missions in hisec, I think you should ignore the haters and do L4 missions in hisec. If you get bored with that, there are plenty of other options available. I like doing missions in NPC nullsec for a little added challenge/reward. Incursion fleets are definitely a good option, especially for ISK, and I usually enjoy running with those guys. Bombers Bar is another community that allows you to come and go and provides excellent content. If you're PVP averse and enjoy exploration, join Signal Cartel. Wormhole living truly is excellent, and there are lots of groups you can join or you can try it solo or with a few friends if you like playing on hard mode. Happy flying!
---
you get separate ticks per system so yes separate system affects sec status gains
---
Pretty much what Olmeca said, just to add with regards to hole control, a doorstop is super important. A rolling BS on the outside of a VOC hole. Its up to you how sensitive you are going to be with when you roll, but mostly if the BS sees probes or someones lands on him he decloaks and jumps back.
---
Look up that top left pocket again then. The whole of north down to eastsouth is their renters. GWCS lost all systems by Frat brining 200 man fleets and constantly camping all of the top pocket made them crumble over the course of one year.
---
someone similar
---
Yes, deadspace too.
---
CCP doesn't want more sisi-only heroes. Test server is for testing new features, not new fits. Makes sense with that in mind.
---
Super incorrect.
---
Sorry man I don't get outta bed for anything less than 500 billion.
---
What type of thing do you enjoy? PvP? PVE? Industry? Mining?
---
A lil bit of everything preferably battles
---
The best pvp is when you give people a ‚Äòfair fight‚Äô in your solo bling battleship. They think you‚Äôre baller for taking a 1 vs many fight but you‚Äôve already done the maths and know that they don‚Äôt have the dps to kill you.
---
There's at least 70% of an entire lightbulb there and y'all are just gonna let it go to waste? I'm appalled.
---
If you wanna mine like OP, your gonna be omega which often happens with IRL isk
---
What crack are you on bro? That‚Äôs been frat/Tri then frat and x random renter for over a year and a half. That space isn‚Äôt flipped. Like I said:
---
Is right order there? Yes/no?
---
Is bsod there? Yes/no?
---
Simple equation
---
They‚Äôre a bit sensitive up in Botworld (Branch). Apparently I‚Äôm racist for thinking aloud in local that Taiwan is #1 and China shouldn‚Äôt murder their citizens with tanks...
---
  Ganker's Paradise !
---
Surely somebody will do the song!
---
So you thought "he must be looking for juicy abyssal runners to gank", but despite being a juicy abyssal runner, you still decided to  run the site in Jita?
---
I ran into the same problem. Playing this afternoon
---
Sounds like B0T is very salty.
