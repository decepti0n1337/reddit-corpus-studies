Yeah, but due to high sec mechanics they put backups around .. so when 1 dies, the others take over. It's like zombie wars or something.
---
In truth, these structures are not ours. In fact, TAPI wants to destroy any competition on the market. The initial goal was just to make some kills, we were supposed to die to tell the truth 
---
you're an idiot
---
Must be fun.
---
It waste's CCP's time, and that's fine, it's their work time, not our play time, to waste.
---
I know, they are ICHOOSEYOU's Azbel spam. You have a contract with him. It's all good man and no big deal.
---
TBF it's a real subtle difference
---
they already have few enough people working on the issue as it is, adding baseless opinion reports with no evidence sucks up time they could be using to investigate reports from people with actual proof.
---
It's easy to meme and be mean, but for some of us, this style of communication is far more satisfying
---
An enemy FC isn't there to create content for you, he's there to create content for his people. 
---
Assuming you aren't flairbaiting, FCs during strat times are literally told blue ball or hell dunk even though the alliance can afford to lose ships. 
---
CCP could fix tidi and desync if they moved tq to the cloud and stored data in the blockchain.
---
1) The plex being bought from CCP to sell on the market is not going to decrease if bots go away because the bots aren't the ones buying the plex with real money in the first place. 2) Purchases of plex in game will only increase if it becomes cheaper as real people will be able to afford more of it for the same price. 3)  Removing bots would result in a lower price of plex for people purchasing it in game, which means the people selling it will end up with less isk as a result. This will result in those people needing to buy more plex with real money to get the same amount of isk back. This would lead to increased PLEX sales by CCP as wallet warriors will need to spend money money to get the same amount of isk. This is the reason for CCP to take action it would lead to MORE sales to wallet warriors which makes the MORE money, which last I checked is a benefit to a business trying to make more money.

delete this

at least its a fight, :)

Make looting give you a session change or something like that. Easy fix.

underrated comment
---
wrong, broadcasting means you click on one screen and it replicates across several. All near2 does is tell 1 player that another player typed something in a channel somewhere. That's not a replication of anything if anything it works similar to how the market aggregating programs collect all the different sale prices in the game so traders can find the best deal, and those aren't considered cheating  why would this be cheating? I don't use near or the other similar types of software but I have nothing against those that do.
---
tapi member gets downvoted on reddit, the home of the tapi menace. Even your own alliance can't stand reading your shit it seems.
---
you bore me
---
Please don't challenge this sub, please. There are horrors we have yet to see, I am sure of it. 
---
Honestly one of my favorite looking ships in the game
---
the grr goons is strong with this one, were talking about a guy who got caught broadcasting to his campers in local and all he can come up with in every response post is spodbrain this and spodbrain that...
---
&gt;I didn't break any rules to begin with.
---
Other than that whole broadcasting software is clearly stated as against the rules in that little thing called the EULA.
---
he broadcasted, not the same thing as  botting but still against the rules of the game.
---
will do! i too, hate bots with a passion. they're responsible for our isk inflation in eve, imo.
---
Be VERY careful what you do, this is a common scam, or was back in the day. Where a guy acts as if he is the jf pilot and just takes your shit. You may want to try only taking maybe a few things out there, just in case you don't like it. Plus depending on where you go doctrine ships will be on contract.
---
Sell it all before you join your new corp. (unless there is a special ship to you)
---
Transporting ships will cost loads and you should be able to just rebuy whatever you want when you get to your new home system.
---
did you miss the killmails where he was using entire fleets of his own alts to perform bombing runs on fleets of miners? How can you not understand that broadcasting makes coordinating 8 bombers a breeze?
---
Yes I am flairbaiting, but right now im having a serious discussion with you.
---
Can someone be described as creating content when they are blueballing? Its shitty for everyone involved especially considering 80% of fleets use cheap meatgrinder doctrines that can be funded by 1 player.
---
I have never seen Seddow run a fleet and win due to the skill of his command (does batphoning fall under skilled command) and throughout all of this he will act like a tool in local tethered in safety.
---
By no means am I an expert, but I would have to guess something that can disengage, vedmak has to spool up to be able to break you. Maybe the curse does it by way of neuts? 
---
Everyone has "Fuck it. I'll probably be fine" moments.
---
Oh I agree, it's counterproductive on many levels, particularly socially. I know it's a minority opinion but I don't care about bots so much. I care about gfs
---
we need a losec entry to eve's tranquility server bois, lets make it happen
---
Then post it here like they did with Don, post the actual screen shots showing actual broadcast usage. Every time I see someone complain the "goons" or the imperium is broadcasting it is based entirely on accusation and opinion and mob mentality BS, there is never a screen shot or video showing actual cheating. Except that one time that one moron uploaded a video showing normal ice miner activity and called it botting because he doesn't understand ice excav mechanics which didn't really do the "goons bot/braodcast" parade any favors.
---
&gt; Seddow 
---
I don't really see much activity for this person, nor do I know who they are actually. What activity I do see is kills he's getting for his guys, assuming he was FC on that fleet. 
---
You don't need to be a good FC to make content, you can be trash and if you're providing stuff for people to do that's still content. Kills are content for people, just cause they're low-tier kills doesn't make it any less of content for those involved. 
---
yeah, haven't seen more than a few  out here in lowsec, and they all died. Despite looking dapper af, they are not all that popular. 
---
I’d bet you’re just retarded and said that local is broken so that people stop making fun of you for being a retard 
---
English too. 
---
Oh geez. Another krab. 
---
So you do not think bots stand for a substantial amount of PLEX buying? You can't sell infinite amounts of PLEX if there's not infinite buyers. How big would you say the deflation on PLEX prices caused by bots are? 1/3? Because PLEX prices has been pretty up and down the last half a year.
---
I'm with you on the whole grr botting - but you have to account for all changes it will impose on the game. Not just the ones you would like.
---
You also have to take in account that people are so used to these prices now, and big time sellers who sit on large amounts of PLEX will control the market by soaking up all the low priced PLEX and selling when price goes up again. They have so much ISK they can literally sit on PLEX for 6 months or even more if it means a huge profit.
---
I WANT TO MOVE TO STAIN. WHAT IS THERE TO DO IN NPC NULL?
---
IS IT SAFER THAN SOV NULL &amp; LOWSEC BECAUSE 0 GATES?
---
*But I know how to restart my moms computer when her facebook is down*
---
I've seen some of the pits this place can sink too as even when I walk away from the game I keep tabs on the this sub. But this particular poster and those like him trying to get back at the "goons" who got don banned when it was don who got himself banned are just beyond awesome.
---
In Tribal Band we had a super shitty egomanical IT cunt. He was shit. 
---
I think D E L E T E L O C A L is more a catch all for making local more like wormhole space, NOT just outright deleting it.
---
Regardless, I think there is a group of people who feel free, instant intel is a little overpowered. Delay, etc is an interesting idea.
---
Back in 2011 I had that for a month. Samsung n150 something, right? Had dank 15 fps in jita on low!
---
It's pretty obvious, but expected. I'm not really sure why I keep visiting /r/eve, it has been a shithole for a some time. 
---
Be happy, you won eve. 
---
Delet dis.

because too many "friends" makes the game boring as hell
---
[Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/cVNaGKE.png). Capsules are 4m long.
---
You beat me to it
---
" They have so much ISK they can literally sit on PLEX for 6 months or even more if it means a huge profit." Assuming you could actually get rid of the bots and keep them out in the long run the price wouldn't swing back up to where it used to be without a massive influx of new real people playing the game to jack demand back up to the old levels. And anyone following CCP's marketing recently knows that the plex market has been unstable recently because of all the 50% sales on DLC packages that were run this past year. Now with a large majority of players having used those deals that event won't be possible again, without a massive influx of new accounts that can buy the DLC again, meaning plex prices would go back to being relatively stable unless something happened to the supply or demand on a large scale, something like all bots being removed from the game. But regardless of all that people selling plex they bought with real money would still be getting their isk that way regardless as they don't care who buys the plex the wallet warriored for as long as someone buys it they get their isk and CCP gets their money, and as studies with other games show, people willing to wallet warrior for their in-game progress are generally not deterred if the price goes up unless the price increase is dramatic and frequent.
---
Some of the best 3-2-1 game runners have legit contracts so you can actually win. This makes you keep playing. I've got a lot of 777k Firetails and the like from them.

I really want to say there is another region on the other side of it

Or nerf it somehow. The rorqual should not be able to mine insane amounts AND give insane boosts AND have enough tank to tank like 15 subcaps AND compress ore on the spot. But ccp has decided that caps are the answer to everything :(
---
So they got a market down, and even though you killed the other one Vily still fed so hard that you lost the isk war 2:1? NICE 
---
It's kinda more that you added nothing to the conversation lol jeez.
---
remember when you gloriously killed all those raitarus? now THAT was reddit-worthy... 
---
It's almost like skill injectors are the broken game mechanic you speak of! \^_^
---
Post your loss mail.
---
That's not the issue, not learning from first time you fail is. And killboard seems to indicate some trend towards small ships and pods having unfortunate contact with smartbombs near gates.
---
2019....uses sound card...

Nothing to add, just think it's telling that one of the most upvoted and commented threads on the EVE subreddit is an in depth discussion of IT infrastructure.

How did his pod get caught in lowsec?

Whoosh

Only snuff retards use skill urself flair tho

not exactly INIT are definitely their own group. Honestly the only alliance in the imperium besides gsf I feel I can say that about

It was fun fight guys we'll get yall next time. 
---
You have terminal smooth brain.
---
" Why is There No Incentive to PvP in EVE?" Maybe in highsec, in lowsec, null or wormhole space not pvping means you don't get to keep your stuff there for long unless you are a renter.

Really fun fight, GF to Frt.

Might have gotten the rorq if we had put it in panic first before killing the carrier

I proved demonstrably when I first became exec that if I am given unchecked power with no advisory checks in place I run the risk of destroying my alliance.  I do very little knee jerk and autonomously, but I also follow our own rules.  I don't get paid I don't get a personal moon (except that 5 month period I had a spod moon) and I don't do things that put the alliance at risk.  
---

JUST KEEP REPORTING
---
DEATH TO ALL BOTS
---
To your #9 point, also see what they are killing. Are you in a carrier and they have a zKill filled with excavator drones or VNIs? Probably not a threat. See if they have lost a ship recently. Did they have a cyno? No? Then you might expect a 1v1 fight. 
---
Problem with the corax is fitting on the one hand and its bonuses not meshing with the rest of its stats on the other.
---
Fitting, well, suitonia (I think) once noted that it has only 3 MW more PG than a kestrel but has to fit 3 more launchers. Nuff said, I think. It needs a current router just to fit rockets and an MSE, and then add a MAPC on top of that if you want light missiles.
---
For the rest of it, most of its stats say 'brawler' - midslot heavy layout, terrible speed, fitting that makes light missiles extremely hard to jam on, etc. However, the application bonus is only really useful if you *don't* brawl, because rockets already apply perfectly almost all the time. This means that most of the time it's just a wasted bonus, and the corax is already terrible enough.
---
My own personal preference would be to add +5 base PG so that it can fit rockets and a MSE without a current router, and then swap the application bonus for a 5%/lvl missile fire rate bonus. This would ease its fitting and give it a nice niche as the DPS-heavy brawling missile destroyer next to the slippery kite-focused talwar.
---
Reminds me of the Snipers mantra.
---
Be polite.
---
Be efficient.
---
Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
---
as it turns out the BP elo account has taken over  that job with his new delve botting posts, your services are no longer required.
---
They could always go an interesting direction with a T2 or T3 variant and make it an actual U-boot. Give it torpedo launchers and a special property that severely cuts the range in exchange for cargo hauler type ships not getting a counter-lock until after the first torpedo salvo hits. You could also reduce its maneuverability and give it a much longer warp spool-up time. That might be a bit broken for solo play but it'd be interesting to see that worked into inter-alliance play, perhaps a well-placed wolfpack could intercept a hauler full of spare ships heading to the frontline. 
---
I think CCP could figure out how to use tech from 2119 and still have tidi and desync

I'll do you one better…  WHY IS NIGHTBL4DE?!

Probably because of the money, social, and time investment. it's hard to just walk away from shit like that.

I kinda wonder if Seddow had a big bounty on him. Solo kill on a 7 billion pod might have had a nice payout.

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn't, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error
---
Always thought this as a Romanian...
---
Delete local
---
The overview is simply the visual representation of the information, and bot should be able to use the information with actions since they don't require visual confirmation
---
This is the perfect time to do that. Otherwise it'll be more Intel bots and stagnation.
---
Delay yes, based on sec status, ew.
---
What games deleted local before.
---
you need
---
a) scanning skills
---
b) probably some alts to log off in your hole of choice
---
c) a pos tower or citadel

enjoy

I come in system local is empty so i just warp my pod to the gate and bam im dead but local was empty?? CCP really need to fix this it just not fair

---
This is a common hang-up for newcomers. You're attached to your stuff in highsec and tend to worry about it. You worry that you won't be able to find what you need in null. 
---
In practice, when you find a home in nullsec your earning power will be so much greater than before that you will have no trouble affording all new stuff. There are contracts, trade hubs, and import options.
---
It *is* a good idea to consolidate your highsec assets at a trade hub before you go so it's easy to liquidate them once you realize they're just collecting dust. That also makes it easier to selectively import stuff you really do want later—just make a courier contract to your alliance's preferred service. Never ship without collateral.
---
Fundamentally, playing against NPCs to accumulate assets is unchallenging and invariant. PvP is challenging in the moment, beforehand in building a fit and selecting a target, and afterwards in getting away in more than a pod. It’s also not a solved problem, due to variation in circumstance and pilot skill preventing a stable solution (variably awful ship balance obviously impacts this heavily admittedly)
---
EVE PvE has been a solved problem for the most part for over a decade. Even abyssal content is mostly ‘pick your investment point and willingness for wallet variance’
---
EVE industry is considered unknown to many because it takes effort to work out, and those who have put that effort in are less inclined to put together foolproof tools (though tools like isk/hr, evernus and fuzzworks lower the bar massively).
---
If you want to play interactive TV in space, that’s your prerogative, but doing so, you’re barely scraping the surface of the game’s potential to engage and entertain you. People who prefer that level of engagement don’t want to spend their time playing a relatively unrewarding and repetitive gameplay loop just to enable their favoured gameplay. I’m sure a mission runner wouldn’t appreciate having to win 5 duels a day to continue their space and chill grindfest.
---
death to all citadels

---
My favourite ship class, in all its beauty. Love it!!
---
For some reason, Gallente school stations are not supposed to have missile skill books sold by the npc.
---
So you end up with these helpful players selling these books in starting stations for a mere 120x markup. (40k in npc stations in other regions)
---
This sounds like a load of shit.
---
Print them and flip really fast
---
Wow. This is one of the reasons I fell in love with the game. More please.
---
Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. And in this case it’s not close at all.

I was referring to south fountain of course. We call them Fountain Feeders Federation.
---
By that logic, companies that pay people to work for them support the drug trade by giving them a paycheck to spend on drugs...

LOL :)
---
At this point I think the challenge  is how to build your own rorq fleet and plex and inject into tons of alts. That’s what I’m doing, seeing how many alts I can plex and earn with while only buying sale packs.
---
Nah the Alliance logo updates have always been slow to go through, and logos I’ve worked on have always taken longer to go through. You should keep an eye on your inbox (to make sure it hasn’t been rejected).

---
with one exception of a single turbo nerd who feels that need a whole system of sanctums to themselves no one else I have played with has been adversely affected by that change, in fact most are making more now then they were before do to the possibility of double dread or single titan spawns.
---
&gt;the racist in imperium right?
---
we only have one?
---
so seed them yourself for a reasonable markup? 
---
or perhaps your time and market slot is worth more than the 5x markup and low volume you'd gain selling them at Dodixie price?
---
Ok, while your answer is cute, it misses the entire point. So I probably should have worded it better.
---
How is PvP supposed to be "more enjoyable" with regards to Isk making, compared to PvE activities, such as mining, mission running, or farming anomalies?
---
And implied in that, why must there be a Isk Faucet mechanic intertwined with PvP in order for it to be "more enjoyable"?
---
The large alliances have logistics wings that haul things to and from null.  So they will have a procedure for you to haul your stuff.  That procedure will be listed on a wiki or a forum post that you will be able to see after you join the alliance.  But don't actually have anything hauled.
---
Just sell anything you are not especially attached to except for a travelcepter.  Leave anything you are attached to in highsec.  Use the travelcepter to get to your new alliances staging, and get new ships there.  The big alliances have "free" programs where they hand out some ships for free, and you'll be able to buy the ships you need out there.
---
There's a couple reasons for this.
---
One, you're probably going to need different ships than you currently fly anyway.  Or at least new fits.
---
Two, you might get out there and say "this sucks".  Easier to leave if you don't have to move all your stuff back to highsec.
---
Sigh. Spodbrain is resilient I see and has addled your brain....or you are a better and just playing the victim. No one is this stupid.

Yikes a whole year to evict someone. +Bragging about eviciting a handful of player when you're way bigger as INIT. alone, excluding all the goons that came to steal your glory.

The respawn timer change or the dread/titan spawn? The timer change was just CCP altering how much time sanctums sake to respawn in a system after being completed. The dread/titan spawns work just like normal faction dreads, on the final wave of the site there is a chance for a dread, blood dread, or titan spawn, and if you win the lottery you can get all 3 in one site.
---
I can.

Yes, the smooth curves are a few circles stapled together to look smooth. Its only 1.25"x3.25", so its impossible to tell its not continuous. Used CATIA to outline the images, then just measured the points. and curves.

You can't rely on batphones. If you're incompetent enough that you can't take fights in a C2, you're not competent enough to gain and hold hole control against a bunch of T3s long enough to get a fleet in to help you unless they rage roll from their hole directly into yours which takes hours, isn't guaranteed to happen, and is thus rare.

I am sure CCP has hard statistics on players participation for each event. I assume their stats showed events that include broader play-style (combat, mining, manufacturing, mini game etc), will attract more players vs. event that purely focus on one aspect of the game, e.g, pvp/combat only. It would not surprise me if they will also include space-trucking in the future event.

Well it's not like they represent the most people, they are just the best organized for the vote.

Which is fine for the official forums, or in a discord, but that's not going to fly here. Reddit has always been about entertaining people, sometimes informing them. There's little patience for rational discussion here. Which is why I rarely do it, and instead rely on other places to be serious.

Fine, give us some name then.

Renter : BOT and I will give you some and there is also all kids with guns alliance since their leader made a post "I bot here and here is why"
---
Edit : OK I can give you some imperium name but I need to find a reddit post, it was a post from a black Legion guy saying "I bot in delve but it's to use the isk to do pvp" and well, again a certain side was happy to see that happening...
---
I heard wormholers were arrogant but this is another level.
---
Just because someone disagrees with your interpretation of a set of facts doesn't make them automatically wrong and it certainly doesn't mean they are a botter by default. What an utterly moronic statement.
---
The point is that many of the "bot trademarks" you are claiming, are exhibited by regular players who aren't afk as fuck too. If you try gathering more substantial data rather than just stating "VNI warps out to quick -must be a bot" you'd appear to have a more compelling case.
---
Imagine the dumb drama that happened all the time in the PFED "FC" channels, and then just imagine it was one guy constantly starting it but not actually ever really taking out fleets, or when he did, he got dumpstered by pretty much everything and then whined about how it was everyone else's fault. That was my experiences with Hudders in a nutshell. He made it not even worth spying on T-C at the time. That was, of course, before the huge drama bomb that he enveloped himself in before being purged.

RMC, or what will remain of it, is moving to Curse. Goons wanted more space to grow into, this was told to the alliances living in PB just before the anom nerf was announced (my former alliance included), so that was the cited reason. 
---
My assumption with RED backing TRI in the last war, continually fighting against Legacy, and helping with timers in the North prior to DARKNESS doing that agreement, GSF probably saw RMC as a security risk. I don't necessarily blame them. Even though RMC gave my small alliance a chance, I was pretty fucking done with them after [this](https://i.imgur.com/8BJ00cu.png) conversation in [Discord](https://i.imgur.com/mndvavO.png).

Oh, I want to, I've saved up for a decent gaming PC, and was about to buy it once the post-CES show sales on last year's hardware started. Unfortunately, I work in US government funded solar astrophysics research. Our lab only has 6 days of funding left before we are furloughed due to the Government shutdown. I may need my savings for rent instead of gaming hardware. So yeah, until I can pay rent with isk, my old mac will have to do. It's ever so slightly better at running isk than my kitchen toaster. :)

You can sell the plex in Jita plant 4 station 4. Its the major trade hub in the game and has been since near the start. Do NOT move the plex in your cargo, move it in your plex vault. Good luck.

For doctrine use, it's a bad idea since it's bonused for armor. Your alliance will advise against it and almost certainly deny SRP if it blows up. Some people use a shield fit privately, such as for max-tick PvE or niche small gang PvP.

Don’t worry about moving pled in your cargo if you’re in highsec, the police keep you safe! :)

At the base of the period.

Join a corp like Pandemic Horde they'll help you learn the ropes and provide you with helpful skill plans / ships / etc to get you started

What intrests you in eve? If its large scale fights you should probably join one of the newbro nullsec alliances. They have good wikis with basic info on how you can start making isk and offer lots of opportunitys
---
You like more small gang oriented content? Then probably lowsec or wormhole groups would fit your style more.

Joining stuff outside of hisec space might sound scary at start, but i gurantee you will not regret leaving hisec once you do it. Lots of people are out there ready to help and guide you, if you choose to join them.

Baaaack up. There is a lot more depth to this game than to something like WoW. If you skip ahead, all you're setting yourself up for is to painfully lose bigger ships. *SP will not solve your problems.* If you want, you can share the details of exactly what you're trying to do and we may be able to help troubleshoot. There's plenty of trolls around here, but there are also folks who will give useful advice. I'm afraid I don't have really good advice on how to tell those apart, so be cautious.
---
Making a few assumptions, here are a couple questions you should answer: What tier of combat missions are you attempting? What ship are you using? What weapon and tank system are you fitting it with?
---
At a *wild* guess now, I'd say you are trying to do Tier2 or Tier3 missions in a frigate, and (no surprise) you're getting dumpstered. If you get yourself into a cruiser (Vexor, Caracal are good choices) then you should find them much easier. I'm not super familiar with highsec missions.
---
Once you have your feet under you a little bit, you'll want to start thinking about what you want to do in this sandbox. Don't get caught in the trap of "leveling up" to bigger ships. Figure out what you want to do, and then figure out what ship you need to fly in order to do it.
---
Figure out what you want to do then train for it, look at ship mastery skills, get the relevant skills to IV, which doesn't take time. Don't rush to go into bigger ships, stick to frigate/destroyer for now.
---
Well he probably wants to join a non-shit alliance eh.
---
You can list it for .01 isk less than the cheapest SELL order in the station. It will sell. The way the market works is the cheapest sell order and highest buy order in that station will get filled first. This is a player driven economy. Everything has to be interacted with via a player to exist with the exception of Skill Books and Blueprint Originals that are seeded in certain NPC stations.
---
Wormhole space is the best part of Eve. You get to experience everything at once through your WH chain, I highly recommend it. Of course, what your intentions are in wspace really change the answer to your question, so what's your goal here? Isk? PVP? Exploration? In any case, there's likely a WH corp out there for you. Wouldn't recommend you try to go it alone.
---
That is a Gen Mattis quote
---
Sounds like a job for some gank alts.
---
I'd say the more gang orientated, getting to know regulars and characters in clans, groups and platoons is one of the great things in multiplayer games I've played. Chilling with a small band is always best, for me. 
---
Everyone seems to indicate that lowsec=higher isk earnings?
---
Eve and fast progression don't go hand in hand, even if you buy skill injectors you're going to be dumpstered by most people because you have no idea wtf you're doing with those skills which others have built up over 10 years.
---
But by all means pay money for SP and feed content to people ;)
---
I think he knows that wouldn't happen he would go alone. Something about retards united under one banner and all. 
---
Dam really wish I had been on that fleet 
---
Add those numbers up and see if you get more than legacys 35k + imperiums 50k
---
I'm not sure if you've heard but eve is not super easy when you first start out. Take your time and learn about each aspect that confuses you. You can 'buy' SP off the market but actual experience is the real currency and the only way to earn it is hard work, continual self improvement and learning.
---
If you are looking for a game that you can quickly get into and master, this is probably not it.
---
Brisc Rupal is very annoying and I wish people realized it. He isnt the lord savior that goons think he is, he is just a cringey idiot who constantly seeks sttention (re: look at all his comments) on a daily basis.

we killed the same amount and more in provi, but we didn't post about it because it was a great big grind through uncontested citadels. if that's something you're proud of, good for you, but please keep it to yourself instead of going around acting like your the judge judy of content
---
Oh yes that hellcamp was epic, still got all their supers there! Hahahaha they totally didn't get them all out in a week. 
---
Is that limited to anywhere in the faction's space or the "home space" IE, Curse, Stain, Delve, Fountain, Venal?
---
Eve does require quite a bit of grinding to play, unfortunately. Either find a form of making isk that is somewhat fun, like exploration, or mine/rat while watching tv or chatting on comms. 
---
Or just be really quick at looting wrecks, and really good at not dying. But that isn’t normally possible, since you need something fast to get to wrecks quickly, and frigates/destroyers die pretty easily 
---
not at all. 
---
Yeah I was putting "wdsawwwwwwwdddddd" in the chat when I first spawned in, that's when I knew it wasn't going to be easy haha
---
I'm quite good with the hotkeys and fighting, ship actives and passives, buying and selling stuff on the market... it feels a lot like no mans sky in a lot of ways so it's somewhat familiar.
---
I love that it's an mmo with all the player interaction, I've found a really good game in Eve I think
---
You can still hear two fucking dictors
---
You want to train those destroyer skills as it increases your hull bonus.  For example, if you go into the traits tab of your coercer, you get a 10% bonus to tracking and 10% reduction in usage cost per level
---
Nulsec is more profitable than lowsec (generally), and strangely safer too - if you join one of the newbie corps out there (check out [Pandemic Horde](https://www.reddit.com/r/pandemichorde/), but there are others too).
---
Joining a 0.0 newbie corp has many advantages:
---
* You'll be learning Eve together with other new players in your position.
---
* There will be veterans around and plenty of guides around to learn from.
---
* You'll get free stuff like ships and skill books to help you get started.
---
* You'll make more isk than you probably think is possible right now.
---
* Plenty of organised fleets for mining, PVE, PVP and everthing else you can possibly do in Eve to help you figure out what you enjoy.
---
The big downside (IMHO) is that you miss out on the natural progression in Eve going from highsec to possibly lowsec Faction War then to nulsec. No thrill in Eve will ever compare to the first time you lose a ship in low or null.
---
Try it out - it's easy enough to leave if you decide it's not for you, but it's a easy, profitable and fun way to start your Eve career...

I don't know how to reduce the effects of webifiers or warp disruptors etc, and I don't know how high tier ship interaction works, but when I get to that point I'm sure I'd be able to work it out through excel or just logic/ PvE or PvP

Completely skip mission running. Join a newbro alliance in nullsec, train a Vexor Navy Issue, use the freebie ships on fleets, loot wrecks from player ships or ask pilots in things like carriers if you can follow them with a ship loaded with T1 Salvagers and salvage the wrecks, sell the loot, buy a VNI, use the VNI in anomalies in nullsec owned by your alliance. Use local and intel channels your alliance hosts to know when it's safe to run the VNI. Whenever anyone who isn't blue enters the system, dock up. Do this until you have a decent amount of money and can get into something better for ISK. I highly recommend something like a newbro WarpToMe battleship. Incursions in this way can earn you over 100 million ISK per hour. Another option is mining in something like a Procurer if you don't want to learn incursions.  
---
This is the quick, easily accessible way. It's not a ton of fun, but you will at least meet people and make quick isk for a new player. Once you have an incursion ship, you'll have enough income that you can then buy things like skill injectors to make training other things much easier.

DO NOT JOIN A HIGHSEC CORP.
---
For one thing, you'll likely burn out as the game will be all grind and 0 excitement. For another, highsec mining corps are notorious for being run by people who set up 'newbie farms', attracting new players to mine for them, use their citadels, and heavily tax it. This money then goes into their pocket, not the corp fund. You'd be much better served taking what seems like a big risk (but really isn't), and going to nullsec.

The best money in highsec is newbro incursions with Warp To Me in something like a Rokh, Dominix, Hyperion. About 200 million isk initial investment, then you're printing money after that. Much higher than Level 4s.
---
LOL
---
Don't shield tank your Nyx you scrub.
---
Go proper Warpspeed Nyx instead.
---
There was not a single fleet "paik". Didn't feed when he was sctually doing somethingx so he fits right into test. 
---
But i must say generally he was a good dude
---
/s would have saved you some karma haha, they're just there to hunt players that kill other players right? They don't actually come to your aid when another player attacks you
---
if he really did shut it down and stop it just goes to show how many bots there are that a large setup closing up shop had no impact on the market.
---
Corpse taxes?
---
You don't need to hassle with Gatecamps on Sector borders if you set their Staging System as new Home and just  pod express yourself.
---
This must have been Bombers Association, everyone knows bombers bar is a mercenary group hired to hunt goonswarm exclusively, the best propaganda mens in the Imperium have told me.
---
But you would touch a 10 foot stripper "pole".......
---
A pretty basic HAAS 3-axis with a #2 centerdrill.
---
Ngl every time I think of mining in a space game I imagine the endless hours of zapping space rocks in no mans sky... i can't go back to it
---
Thanks for the detailed strategy, how hard is it to just be the pilot in the carrier though? How long would that take?
---
you should have changed the text to "REYNOLDS WE SAID DIE QUIETLY"
---
So....goons
---
Still don't understand how can someone shut down government. Its a government, not a company! Oof,
---
But gl with your Mac and funds 
---
I feel like something went over your head, but mystery makes the mind stronger so i'll let you work it out.
---
Go back to the forums.
---
Yikes lol
---
*discord message appears*
---
So it's dead and absolutely hell-bent on staying dead despite people's efforts to revive it?
---
Do NOT go into null sec, you will lose your soul there. Try saying in low sec for a while. 
---
If you're good with fighting, I left a rather detailed guide on two decent options for you. You might want to look into newbro alliances and newbro incursions.
---
Tapi pilots, report in
---
Orrr the drop has just been masked by pvpers leaving the game (they generally buy plex with $) and there being more PVE'rs (who buy plex with isk). A trend that will keep happening and will drive plex prices further up. I wouldn't be surprised to see 5mil plexx by christmas this year
---
Boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
Might of? You mean might’ve? Which means might HAVE?
---
FFS grade 1 English 
---
In the last 2 min the only real change was Init taking Fountain, and the fall of XIX. Fun meta.
---
Although i suppose its better than when Goons had half the map and NA had the other.
---
Olmeca Gold booshed them off their wheels.
---
Like 70% of the bot whine is because they are better at not dying to pvp than an afk person is.  You notice a disticnt lack of any other complaint other than 'they warp off'.
---
All of this is pre-supposed under a veil of 'all bots are bad for eve, fullstop'.
---
If someone was AFK ratting 20 vni's for 10h a day, or botting 20 vni's for 10h a day, what is the difference?
---
I thought the frostline event was pretty good except for how it bugged it was on release.
---
in my experience PVPers are usually the ones paying their sub the old fashioned way via subscription, mainly because of how much money you have to krab together to buy even a single month of time for just one account.  
---
" I wouldn't be surprised to see 5mil plexx by christmas this year " It took almost 8 years for prices to go from 600 mil per month of time to 1.6 ish billion and that's with the added demand caused by using the same currency to buy game time, extractors and skins, based on what forecasting math are you expecting the price to double in just 11 months?
---
They're making the North pay for foiling their invasion plans by poaching one player at a time, can't wait until it's my turn. 
---
Just because you didn't like them doesn't mean other people didn't enjoy them. 
---
I think EVE is the completely opposite
---
With every active member asking others to get onto the fvcking comm
---
If you are blackscreening for 30s, you need a better fucking harddrive.
---
Thanks for the advice, but I use a top of the line SSD and have never had any issues with other games or programs. 
---
Awesome, always love seeing these come out. My only request would be to add a calendar/month+year or something ticking in a corner somewhere. 
---
Lol.
---
If you continue to do military missions, your standings will go up high enough to give you the missions for the big space bux. But that is only one thing among several to do in Eve.   
---
Perhaps you can join a null sec corp and shoot at belt rats to collect bounties, or you can join a wormhole corp where the big money is, but also the most risk. 
---
The world's your oyster man, that's what makes this game the best.
---
it was great fun until a character with no hacking or mining skills gets exclusively hacking or mining quests.
---
or your character that has never fired a gun gets only kill quests.
---
or just generally fucking dumb quests like 'get a kill in an orca' or something retarded.
---
it was the only event i haven't done on multiple characters because it was so fucking painful to try and do on one character - even one with the skills to do all the possible quests. it was just really flow breaking to constantly have to swap ships every 15 mins.
---
it had a wide range of activities, then bottlenecked players in to doing the shit they least wanted to do. it was fucking awful.
---
Renters &lt; F1 Pushers &lt; Pencil Pushers &lt; Content Creators &lt; Non-shit CEOs
---
Tl;dr be useful. Eve is a meritocracy.
---
&gt;what are the line members even capable of in the political metagame?
---
shit posting on reddit.
---
There wasn't much point doing the quests. You either farmed the ore or the rats for bpcs and modules.
---
but once you get past F1 pusher, you're no longer a 'line member'.
---
there was - the only rewards worth getting were from the quests.
---
the rest could be brought off the market, and it was faster to farm isk than farm the things that you could buy.
---
All of Myths Exotic Dancer, Male come equipped with a "Whatever you want" Mod. So...if that's your thing I'd happily sell them to you in Jita. However, I am currently out of stock. Please return when I have more inventory.
---
Well perhaps your stuff is less tuned than you think.  I have been playing eve for 13 years, and I have never blackscreened for more than 5s, and only then after a fresh launch in a massive system like Jita.
---
Step 1 - shit talk on Reddit
---
Step 2 - repeat
---
Happens all the time to my corpmates. If this was a one off thing, why are so many people agreeing and upvoting?
---
Because CCP has massively increased the texture data sizes in eve online in the past 2-3 years and most people playing eve are running 2-3 hardware generations behind, using stuff like PCIE 2.0 and possibly even DDR2 based systems using SATA-2.
---
There are stl files on thingiverse, just a matter of getting it changed to the negative. Dunno much about CAD but I do have 4dc and I did stay at a holiday inn Last night
---
Noctis is **not** the best ship to salvage in.  
---
Warpspeed like a Battleship, Turnspeed like a PvP Supercarrier with 2x 25.000 Plating, absolutely no Cargospace and Costs about 300mil with Proper Fit.  
---
You salvage about 700m3 per Sanctum / Haven / Forlorn Hub + 100m3 MTU.  
---
Noctis got max 3.000m3 cargospace, so every 3-4 Sanctums you need to dock.
---
Noctis turns as fast as Aeon or Nyx with 25000 Armorplating in fulltank fullpvp fit - 15sec, a Rattlesnake is faster in warp than a Noctis.
---
Noctis is slow as fuck in warp, 3AU is like Industrial Transporter / Battleship. With none of the boni, cargospace like a transporter / battleship size tank.
---
Noctis T2 Salvage Tackle Rigs cost \~65mil in Nullsec, less in highsec.  
---
I dont plan to pay that much for a shitty salvager!
---
tl;dr.: Buy a Salvage Destroyer for fast Salvage and warping between sites, and loot MTUs with an Industrial Transporter fitted for 40.000m3 cargo.
---
This way you max out your throughput and can keep up salvaging after Supercarrier and Titans Bosonratting.
---
You only got 2h untils wrecks despawn.  
---
A very SMART and STABLE game!
---
If your in a reasonably sized alliance, line members wont see that side of the game. Most i would venture to guess, dont care to. Log in, shoot things. Win the objective. Shitpost on reddit. Thats really it. 
---
If you truely want to experience that, you will have to either build it yourself from scratch, or join with an up and coming alliance group.
---
in Stain.
---
A beam zealot that can shoot Scorch? Very cool. 
---
Look into the big nullsec ones like Pandemic Horde and Brave. I’d obviously recommend Horde, but Brave is also good. You don’t have to stay in them, but just try one of them out for a week or two, and be on comms and join fleets 
---
Missions as a whole aren’t great for isk until you get to lvl 4s, and those require a battleship. 
---
Exploration might be good, especially if you’re omega, since covops cloak is really useful for that
---
No u
---
He just wants a good time. A *really* good time.
---
1275 male strip dancers, thats one hell of a bachlor party
---
Have you ever thought about teaching posting classes ??? 
---
Because I would love to learn from you !! 
---
What Corp is the richest Corp in Eve? In order words who do I sell these god tier abyssal officer mods to lol. Don't think anyone will want to buy a mod that basically is half a Titan lol
---
Starting one myself would be an option, but apart from being a renter there’s just no null space to really claim. 
---
im glad to know Bad Dragon surveded the new eden gate 
---
yea i heard about that, they still play the ads in stations tho  
---
i wish they would allow for more ads/more frequent updates, its like 30% dead alliances now 
---
Did you plex with real money or with PLEX?
---
No they do come to your aid. Almost instantly and they pack a punch. If you can tank the suicide gankers (usually they make sure killing you is happening and that your loots is worth it) you'll find yourself surrounded by their wrecks ans tons of CONCORD ships.
---
very cool!
---
i do enjoy the corcerer too, as it has 8 guns, but its paper and only has 2 midslots so its practicly useless to do anything solo w/   
---
thrashers are way more common for gatecamp and yolo roam things   
---
&gt; You can still hear two dictors fucking   
---
fify
---
i'm also really interested in it, but only have one acc.
---
My main goals are to farm mega isk to plex my acc then burn the rest on pvp.
---
Also have a blood feud to solve with the drifter cunts, need to avenge my two gilas lost to them in abyssal space by literally dropping dreads on the fucks.
---
AUTZ by the way, so big ping.
---
Any suggestions for corps? I can scan, used to explo for cash.
---
CHECK CHECK CHECK COMMS COMMS COMMS REYNOLDS REYNOLDS REYNOLDS 
---
wait but that's against the narrative, you guys were fighting the entirety of eve and were horribly outnumbered...
---
We all know EVE *is* shit.
---
check his cargo, he had conflag and scorch in the hold, but didnt get to load it
---
also the fit is not perfect, but also far from the worst, its atleast the proper mod size and has a tank, unlike medium shield booster rorqs
---
I would say it’s more of an oligarchy. For instance, before the death of the DRF in the northeast, there was one rorq pilot in the “inpanic” alliance who seemed to notice how hard knocks was coming around more and more, getting rorq kill after rorq kill, then moving on to destroy their cyno jammers, then eventually their control towers, then their refineries, then finally their keepstar before moving on to annex the entire DRF. 
---
This guy was bringing it up constantly, and would be trying to tell the alliance that the DRF was currently at war with (Triumvirate) was a stupid conflict that was simply a grudge match while HK was pounding DRF miners. Now TRI was basically dead at the time, this being around the point where skynet ditched them, but the DRF was on a quest of annihilation, and wouldn’t stop until TRI was completely destroyed. 
---
When he tried to tell his CEO, then eventually the entire alliance in the meetings, they basically shrugged him off and said that HK harassed miners and structures across the galaxy, and that “Even if they blow up cyno jammers we’ll just put up another one”, even though HK killboards were showing DRF kills across the board, losing at least a couple rorquals every single day. 
---
The poor guy said every day that it was time to end the war with Tri and bring the cap fleets home to defend their space, but alliance leadership told him to stfu every time, and constantly tried to assure him that HK had no real reason to annex, and were just farming DRF for content. 
---
Oh boy, were they proven wrong that summer, that’s for damn sure. He tried to tell em, but since he was a lowly miner who would never find a position of power, the whole alliance died. 
---
Kinda weird how it all works out. 
---
Refer to above reply. 
---
I saw 4 contracts today, each asking for 50 male or female corpses today. Nothing shocks me in eve anymore. 
---
Just wondering, what is the point of bringing Nestors on a fleet like this? It seems like they just get volleyed off the field at the start and they’re pretty expensive to be throwing away like that
---
Seems like a good introduction to how EVE works.
---
Gotta fill that Molok Corpse bay somehow right?
---
Probably Aryth's alt corp. 
---
If you’re actually in Horde, look for a guy called Nygil. He flies stupidly blingy stuff all the time, so he’ll probably buy any good abyssals you get. 
---
Holy crap for real. I'm pretty new and still discovering items all the time. Thats a ship to remember!
---
"Coalitions" lead by actual retards with not a single brain-wrinkle are not representative of the rest of Eve.
---
it would not be the same, as I just etched, so I just used the tip of a drill bit to engrave it. the cuts are only .006" deep. You would have to  pretty much make it from scratch anyways, or get the code from someone who already did it (I sent him the code)
---
wait test deployed in geminate? i thought it was just welp and content roams up there 
---
I said hooooooold on the gate DON'T JUMP

No south fountian is a 100% safe place
---
I think there should be more supercaps ratting there, i heard you get better ticks
---
Concord is there to punish not to protect. Otherwise they would heal you.
---
Take it a step further, weapons timer, 1 min on grid buddy.
---
lets hope ```CCP_ROUND``` does not get hold of that number in ```CCP_RNG```
---
&gt;Just wondering, what is the point of bringing Nestors on a fleet like this? It seems like they just get volleyed off the field at the start and they’re pretty expensive to be throwing away like that
---
Logistics, all the Dominix were buffer tanked and the Nestors all had a full rack of remote repairers
---
I'ts bothering me that the Catalyst is sideways 
---
You sure about that?...
---
Though you see what I’m trying to say, right? The social side of null is incredibly stagnant to the point that people are just waiting for someone to quit the game and take their place within the alliance. 
---
I partially blame the blue donut for this one, but the major fact that upcoming corporations don’t really have a way to make any headway without submitting their autonomy to an alliance makes the prospect of founding a null corp rather unappealing. 
---
Step 1) Become Content Generator (if you don’t have ping permissions get someone who does to ping for you)
---
Step 2) Show initiative. When your coalition next goes to war, take out a shit ton of toaster fleets. People hate those, but someone has to do them, and you’ll slowly become known as the “Toasting FC” and start getting actual mission objectives shot your way. 
---
Step 3) (optional, results may vary) shit post on reddit with an account that can be tied directly to your main. It’ll get your name out. 
---
I love how people react when you show them fact, they insult you, grab their garbage meme, throw their low effort sentence and all of that thinking "hurrrr I so counter their argument, I show them they got no knowledge at all hurrrr".
---
No dude, you are just showing I was right and you have nothing to prove me I'm wrong get gud :)
---
Like we all .........
---
Come to daddy ... do you see this thing, when you see this getting big and those numbers here counting down - you press this button here and after short animation when you see little things moving on screen again - you press this button.       
---
Now sit here and to the same on all those monitors - and daddy will bring you some icecream.                 
---
&gt; So again, I ask, where's the incentive? I get that it's fun to rack up your killboard. But honestly, who really looks at that stuff and cares? 
---
No one cares, no one looks at it. 
---
The reason I PVP is to get revenge! All the other stuff I do in the game is to be able to afford multiple titans and faxes to get more revengerer. 
---
To be honest that sounds like less of an eve guide to politics and rather a guide on how to become a well known FC. But thanks, regardless. 
---
requiescat in pace
---
I think its the same as when starting a site right before dt. You just get moved out again and ofc lose the filament
---
Why? I mean, aside from them being subhumans  and all.
---
I know very few people who rose the ranks in an EVE Alliance who didn’t FC (at least at the start). 
---
Doing it any other way will take years and probably a meeting at “the BBQ” in order to get recognized. 
---
You don’t need to be a great FC, just do stupid cheap fleets. It’s more of a way to get your name out. 
---
Bot dead now, doesn't compute with icecream. Uggh
---
We woo wee woo, bad post police, pull over now
---
It would have no meaning to PVP if there wasn't some annoying cost to PVPing. It would just be another battlefield/CS/CoD clone if you could log in to PVP and never had to earn anything to be able to PVP indefinitely. 
---
PS: If you're in a big alliance you can fly in strategic fleets where you get 100% of the cost of the ship and fit after insurance payout, paid back. If you lose the ship. So you can PVP indefinitely without PVEing. 
---
Wait. Is this the guy who lost seven?
---
Don’t listen to this guy. If you’re new and don’t have trade skills you should be selling your plex to buy orders. 
---
i am... known ?
---
Then I'd make 50 000 fits before the change and we'd have cheap fits for years and years because the rest of the goon industrial machine did the same. 
---
Just ninja-loot the remains of a fight between two other groups. Like a scavenger hyena eating from the zebra corpse while two lions are fighting over it. Eve is a sandbox, grow an imagination. 
---
Didn't know what subreddit I was in. MtCJ? ProgrammingMemes? Nope. Eve.
---
Fucking Upvote. Elo is soooooo 2018.
---
I really thought this was going to be dickbutt.
---
&gt; (Director, Diplo, Journalist, Historian, Public Relations Officer, Alliance recruiter, etc.)
---
none of these people are relevant in the political meta
---
You have my sympathies. I have colleagues on the MMS team which are either NASA employees or dependent on federal funding, and they are having a bad time. Fortunately it is an international collaboration so the project as such is not in any trouble.
---
That was a fucking good fight in UALX, a true super vs super brawl - and the elite, experienced super pilot alliances stayed logged off.
---
&gt; has just been masked by pvpers leaving the game (they generally buy plex with $)
---
  I don't... I krab just enough to buy ships. Lose ships. Repeat.
---
Here's here to educate PGL on the arts of tactical dreadnought feeding
---
Start your own corp, build power and numbers. Get bigger and bigger fights, make friends, make enemies
---
I remember when CCP's original plan for carriers was to be the support ships that carried other fit ships- They'd hang at the back of a fight, and throw ships up for players who'd lost theirs in the battle. 
---
10 PRINT "REEEEEE"
---
20 GOTO 10
---
&gt; from their last (5?) failed events
---
  You claim they "failed", but I'm sure outside of the echo chamber known as /r/eve, plenty of people go about their day running them- CCP will have the logs and stats, no doubt they are continuing to make them because people run them. 
---
Instant gratification... sigh.
---
BuT EvErYoNe ShOuLd OnLy PvP In My SaNdBoX GaMe. No PvE AlLoWeD!

when 5 shitposters on an average meme subreddit cry about something in eve- other shitposters: EVERYONE IS OUTRAGED!
---
&gt; AMA
---
What's the capital of Kyrgyzstan?
---
Dont run the site? Not everyone wants to do pvp all day every day. 
---
But what does the X cost do. Why does it have power and toughness while not being a creature. It's clearly an artifact but called an interrupt?
---
4/10. 
---
oi, I've downloaded 700+ images yesterday and done subtitles with date every 0.1 second with excel, literally generated file to render it with these images, how dare you! :D
---
His post to reddit may have been after dt but I was on discord talking to him when it happened. Also I have seen is logs. His local was empty on both cyno and titan chars...
---
Good kill either way but he is not trolling about the local issue
---
Its bischKEK
---
cuz it has kek in its name
---
Washington DC, because Freedom.
---
So true.
---
The other he lost for someone else lol
---
the top one is pretty nice. Is it aluminium, or steel?
---
Now we need newbie alien and we'll get newbie alien vs predator 
---
If this is a serious question - In GSF there are calls for help with various positions going out regularly. Whether it's new FCs (any aspiring FC can apply to Skirmish Commanders), propaganda people, or whatever. Karmafleet for example always needs recruiters. And you engage with people from there. Build trust and relationships. Because EVE on that level is all trust and relationships. Obviously a 6 day recruit isn't gonna be able to do that though - you need to put in some time as well.
---
Sure you might be playing a long con (however GSF is so compartmentalized you aren't going to do much damage at all) but that is one of the main ways in to the higher levels of the metagame.
---
I don't know how other alliances work.
---
Har har har
---
ehhh Diplo paper pushers can be. Some of their failures cause big wars, like Jay Macaroni.
---
One suggestion that I did think of was to make going suspect the eluding encourage such a change timer. That would give pause to these Bots.
---
Doesn't even have to be shit posting. Some well done propaganda works wonders. Just look at the work that Catlos did for GSF in the buildup and during the last war. He reached a broad group, potentially influencing allies and foes alike.
---
If you think you can FC better I challenge you to arrange a fight.
---
Pick a system and number of dudes. I guarantee he wipes the floor with you.
---
Shutup or put up... I got 1b says he smashes whatever fleet you try to FC. Or do you just talk brave on reddit? 
---
Not on pizza. Weirdo.
---
simple question
---
This is where your diplomacy comes in. Who your contacts are, or who you can make friends with.
---
Case in point, FEDUP (galmilistan) went to cloud ring. 800ish pilots, arguably half of them actual people. Took sov. Didnt say it was good space but everyone has to get thier start. Now that they have held it and lived their, they have relations with INIT, slyce, darkness, etc. Sure they might not be blue. And they get blobbed alot but thats your way into the game.
---
Starting out your going to have to claw your way into sov space. Its gonna be crappy space. But once your their for a bit and make a name for yourself, then you'll start seeing that side of the game open up.
---
Its rough at first, but if it was easy, everyone would do it. If you need other pointers, DM me.
---
yeah but we were outnumbered 6:1 and held the field
---
All I see here is a business opportunity. Import books yourself and sell with a smaller markup.
---
Welcome to Eve.
---
certainly need a good imagination to see chest beating or stomping
---
I have a dream that you will make a proper Gila fleet happen. If anyone in the world could do it, it would be you. 
---
we have a few HAAS VF5s in our shop, gcode is gross though haha
---
Also directors have keys to things and can be flipped/bought which has an effect on politics.
---
Man, Catlos made some tip top art work. 
---
Even just as a piece of art that stuff was great.
---
Well I don't know about that.... I saw snuff and 3rd parties drop mostly anti capital buffer dreads all over the grid for no particular reason except as far as I could tell to get a cap escalation to meme on.
---
And the 6:1 ratio is um, well bullshit friend.
---
is this someone with code flair complaining about 'fair' ?
---
How dare one defend himself - common retard
---
Didn't infowars get banned?
---
&gt; and you’ll slowly become known as the “Toasting FC” 
---
And then you'll rapidly lose the will to live.
---
There was a change of tempo.
---
all i know is i saw a lotta fuckin people who weren't blue and there weren't a lot of us
---
Just wanted to make sure you weren't play the "woes me those bullies ganged up on us" card.  Also wtf why is sash playing for snuffed anyway.
---
Players Engaging Necessary Intelligence Services...
---
how many lines of code   
---
and what is the toons name   
---
as no one responded to you, i'll give it a shot, the technical definition is a procession or parade of people on horseback or in vehicles of some kind, however its more commonly used to just describe a group of things. 
---
Unlike you, the people I play the game with are smart enough to fly their own ships, why would I ever need to FC?
---
8 with comments, jitaalt556
---
Nope is boxer is not against the EULA. 
---
Is boxer is not against the EULA you idiot. Why don't you research you own facts rather than follow blindly. 
---
&lt;3
---
Clearly it's a glitch. It's gonna be weird. :)
---
It's beautiful and brings back good memories. Thanks!
---
They're "slightly less bad" people.

 Шшшщб тьмы
---
Yeah, most of my social circle is in federally funded research, and we're all making plans and offering help to people with shorter funds. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. 
---
We're trying to prevent "snowball" effects. For example, miss a few car payments, and you can't find other work as easily as you have to take public transportation, and your credit history may stop you from getting a good rate again if you can afford another car later. Missing a student loan payment can trigger punitive rate increases, making it even harder to pay off. 
---
Everyone is doing their best, but once it starts to snowball, there's no fast way to fix the damage. 
---
Could try the corporate lock down vote, though it's been awhile since I did that myself so I'm not 100% you can do it for containers.
---
I'm sure someone else can confirm that. 
---
yes there is a simpler way, become a content creator, the people that enjoy your content will follow you... sheeps will keep sheeping.
---
Thats what i was saying, pvpers are the ones who don't krab lots, so they spend Dollars$ to buy game time and plexx to sell on the market for isk. This population has gone down. 
---
Also, don't forget the change in demographics we've seen in the last year. http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Fraternity. 9000 chinese characters moving over from their server after it shut down. The Chinese are notorious for pushing up plex price hugely.
---
Thats why our FC lets us take gates, not jump them.
---
Havn't heard "Jump" uttered in quite some time.
---
At least use and insta-warp yacht or something!
---
That's only for blueprints. 
---
Off the top of my mind; Corps have a role called hangar take and container take. Hangar take allows to take anything but containers, container take allows the taking of containers.
---
Don't give people the container take role and it should be good. Always test corp roles with alts tho because they hinky as fuck.
---

Just swipe that mastercard and hit up Jita for some skill injectors, then dump plex to buyorders, join an f1 monkey alliance like goonswarm or test who will hold your hand and srp all your stupid losses, and there you go, you can quit in a week because you're bored and go back to call of duty for your instant gratification gameplay needs

I find it quite amazing that 40% seem to downvote this.  
---
Is that a bunch of macro-users and botters who disagree, or are there actually people in this game who don't bot that would prefer to see macros and bots being used?  
---
With all the complaints as well due to server and chat instability, removing the ones that are responsible for 90% of the chat messages being posted might be a decent start. Specially considering how easy it would be.

Hangers don't have access controls by default. You hang coats on them and anyone can take them off whenever needed. I don't think anyone has even tried to invent any locks on them.

There are tons of (trillion)^2aires in Jita.

They would probably delete the game before they ever run through all of their money.

that's a high-sec specific scam, with insurance and killright fraud. And if I'm not mistaken, by not registering your corp and alt corp ESI on zkill, you can avoid showing the kills you made to create the killmarks.

Join null alliance and salvage sites u can make up to 100m an hour

No there's a flaw in your reasoning chain there.

The correct example of fallacy logic would be:

Training any skill to 3 takes hours at best. 4 usually takes closer to a day. And 5 is a minimum of 4 days with a rank 1 skill. If you. Rank 1 is the base value. Requiring 250K SP to get to 5. A rank 2 is 500K. A rank 3 750K and so on. Getting skills to 3/4 is usually not that big of an investment. Don't even think about getting level 5 skills at this point. They add little benefit over level 4. Only thing are some support skills that need to be 5 to unlock another skill. 
---
Just train into some things you might like and try them out. You can get started on exploration in a cheap tech 1 frigate. You will die at some point. But the cost vs the payout is huge. Just drop your loot off as soon as you have something worthwhile. I am on my phone right now so can't link you to any things that might help you. But check out the eveuniversity wiki. They have a lot of info on a lot of things.

All blood raider ships have a corpse bay if you want to get started on your own collection

Those things are heavily intertwined.

You can't go from being 'just a linemember' to 'just a politician/leader'. You have to gain recognition, respect and trust from both your current leaders and other line members. Act as a scout. Provide crucial fleet roles. Volunteer for important jobs. Be dependable, be reliable. Then they let you FC a fleet - get recognition. Eventually you've risen in the ranks enough to be a diplo or something similar. Nobody will give you any authority just because you ask nicely.

Which site do you use to buy your PLEX?
---
You can also go the way of paper pushing. Do logistics. Seed the market with the things, which are constantly missing. Offer help to the guys who keep the citadels and jump bridges fueled.
---
Or do other special stuff which makes you "known" - regularily fly special, useful ships in fleets (e.g. (heavy) interdictor) and do it well, constantly help newbies, maybe contribute to the website/wiki of the alliance, ... Your word has more weight, if people (especially the "important" ones) know you for other things than bringing up your issue repeatedly.
---
I cannot agree more. Get yourself into nullsec. Karmafleet, brave newbies, or pandemic horde. Even try Eve University if you want to learn more about the game. 
---
Botters Bar*

I could see how it helped internal moral as it could focus the agreed narrative for people, but can't imagine it having any external influence. Most of it was shit and relied heavily on internal jokes.

Unlike some time of the other people doing drawings/art that were actually creative.

you spelled Delve wrong...

Agreed. Just sell to buy orders

What software do you recommend?

Dude is in a frigate mate. Read OP and dont just straight up assume he's in a battleship tomorrow and doing incursions with isk he probably doesn't have yet

It would take you more than a year training to be that carrier pilot. It would also cost you many many real life currency if you want to buy enough plex to sell for injectors. Dont skip the subcap stuff... 95% of the fun in EVE happens in subcaps
---
I am mistaken, it’s just the capital ships 
---
he took them for excavators
---
Priority skills are cloaking skills (covops frigates) and scanning skills. You will also want probably either gallente or Caldari battleship to at least 1 so you can use rolling ships. Then t3c's and a stratios.  After that depending on your current skills you'll want to be able to use heavy assault cruisers (preferably all but prioritise armour if you live in a wolf rayat and shield if you live in a pulsar). 
---
As far as making isk goes you'll want to get basic gas huffing and data/relic scanning skills asap. Then depending on what class of wh you live in that will determine how you would do the combat sites and in what ships etc.
---
Everything uses a cloak if possible in wormholes. Generally armour fleets as well. You won't see interceptors flying around much or fleets of jackdaws or cormorants everywhere like you do in null.
---
You also won't have to deal with supercarriers, titans and cynos
---
Am I mistaken in that you could program a bot to spam the jump button? As the next gate is automatically selected each jump.

Why?

Still can’t remove items from the container while it’s in the Corp hangar though

Can confirm. Everyone in CODE. are different AIs talking to each other.

I agree but it's not gonna happen, the share holders need to see profits. Skins make profits. The shareholders only see the superficial.

It's the classic managers seeing sales team as more important than IT.

Unfortunately that's the way of the world.

RMC was bad with their treaties... They had attacked both catch and esoteria through Stain proxies. There were times when TEST was bashing astras/raitarus everyday that was dropped by some of the stain groups and RMC formed from time to time to go and defend those timers. Sure, officially those weren't RMC structures that were dropped so technically they didn't violate the points about structures, but unofficially everyone knew what was going on. Doesn't surprise me that eventually they would get asked to leave.
---
And yeah, they have been quite inactive lately... Just look at NER - Period basis in frickin nowhere, nobody really goes there (apart from maybe some TEST roams or occasional wh roll), but the economic activity says its almost dead... Hell, some heavily roamed/contested regions have more ratting/mining income...

It's the same in all big companies unfortunately.

My tip. Do your own thing. Create your own corp
---
 find yourself some independent corp's hang out with them work togheter Then you can do your own Diplomacy and politics it might not be big but it's something     
---
We are currently trying to make a democratic alliance in high/lowsec and so far it's going very good. 
---
Vily wasn't FC during the first one.
---
With a client called Bloody Joy Toy it really doesn’t surprise me.
---
Money will flow and scale as your knowledge of the game will increase. What you need now is not "money" but learning the ropes. More skillpoints won't serve you as you expect and bigger ships do not imply "better".
---
My advice is to join a Null Sec newbro corp and also read the golden rules on the Eve Online forums.
---
Another point, please don't play AFK.
---
Stop.
---
I did read OP. I wrote him a very detailed guide about how to get from 0 to VNI or basic incursion battleship very quickly. I was amazed how easy it was to get into the newbro Domi. And here's the best part, an alpha can fly it.
---
So you did. Sorry, didn't look at the names. 
---
You commented before i even posted it. You didn't read it. But you did bother to be aggressive, just because you dislike a trend. 
---
In my humble opinion it's people like you who should stop. ;)
---
Lowsec scrub here. Suppose I'm looking for VNIs running anomalies in null. What are the most likely anomaly types they will krab? 
---
If thats the sort of virgin tier content you offer your guys then it's no surprise tbh
---
Problably depends where exactly they are ratting. probl. just sort the anons by profit....
---
Your entire alliance is funded by botting..
---
No. The entire trend of `xx day of x` is fucking stupid, and you should stop posting.
---
So you have zero interest in engaging in the activity as it doesn't suite your playstyle, and are triggered because of it? Fucking idiot lmao
---
This is cool. How fast things appear and dissapear on the map 
---
wrong
---
what better then having a whole corp of spies.. 
---
I was talking about illegal drugs, not legally prescribed narcotics, but  yes your argument works as well.
---
i agree with the fucking stupid part. i disagree with the "i should do something because it hurts your butthole" part. you downvoted, you commented, you expressed your feelings. you used the tools you had, now move along, that is unless you know of a site which explains PI materials behavior which i am obv seeking. and which is actually the topic here. 
---
Would VNIs normally run Havens/Sanctums or are they limited to smaller sites?
---
Right click &gt; show other player colonies
---
[Everyone and their mom has colonies on said planet]
---
Then the price would be increasing every day as people left the game, currently we have only seen a stabilizing of the market back to where it was before the non-stop 50% off sales that were running for most of the last 12 months.
---
New event?
---
Carriers are highly overrated. You never get to use them, and when you do use them, you don't want to be there with this lumbering slow beast because there are 2,000 of them in the system and the lag is unbearable. Don't worry about them at all for now, the 'fun' expensive/high SP ships are things like Vindicators, T3Cs, command destroyers, T3Ds, Assault Frigates, and the various T2 support ships. Focus on those and everyone will love you and you'll be able to use those every day.  
---
As for the WTM fits, you've got two options there. Bhaalgorn or Apocalypse Navy Issue. Neither is ideal for a new player, they're a bit expensive and neither is considered an ideal ship for incursions in the long run anyway. In the long run, you'll want either a Vindicator or a Nightmare, and for beginner ships, they like to see Rokhs, Maelstroms, etc. The Alpha Dominix is the absolute easiest and cheapest ship they will take, and I recommend training that, then training a vindicator. Another good option is something like Rokh --&gt; Nightmare, although they don't share the same weapon system, though they both use Caldari Battleship. In the same way, you could do Maelstrom --&gt; Vindicator, since they both use Minmatar Battleship, but again, different weapon system. Overall the best path is definitely gonna be Dominix --&gt; Vindicator in terms of ease and usefulness, but if there's a ship in that list that you just love the look and feel of, then train that. As long as it is in that listing I showed you, they will take it and you will make the 100m per hour.
---
Are you fucking retarded lmao
---
I'd rather want the art team focus on making a new celestis hull tbh.
---
about time for eve 2 then.. star citizen in 2020.
---
IS boxer the program is not against the EULA, using the BROADCAST feature located WITHIN ISboxer is against the EULA, why don't you try understanding it after you re-read the EULA you idiot. It clearly states in the EULA that using  program to replicate keystrokes or mouse clicks across multiple screens or account windows is cheating, that's literally what broadcasting does.

Take over the galaxy :P

"  that whole broadcasting software is clearly stated as against the rules"

Your whole brain casting software is stupid.

this
---
the butthurt is strong with this one.
---
Did you just try to call someone a retard.. living cliche
---
&gt;Am I mistaken
---
You are, as the game randomly selects a different gate or selects nothing to combat that sort of easy macro autopiloting.
---
&gt;Even if i didn't mention that there are only a few competitors actually extracting heavy metals, i think it would still make sense to get a post about the patterns (and the physics) of the materials. also an update on the rating system which could also take into account the sec of the system --&gt; this would give player enough variables to calculate if it's actually worth it to build on same planet as other players. So please don't miss the point of this. :)

---
Logs show wrecks before they appear on grid?!
---
I just wanna chill in a fleet every now and then with corp mates chatting shit and with moments of adrenaline during PvP.
---
I recommend joining a corp before trying to strike it out on your own. It gives you a chance to learn the mechanics in a safe environment while also not forcing you to dock up the moment one of the bigger groups enters your chain.
---
So that's why sometimes my gates aren't selected
---
Back when I started eve, I decided that I will get myself a super carrier.
---
Now, almost a decade later, I have said super carrier and my next goal is to buy a titan.
---
After that, just to have fun, I'm a simple man.
---
link yours then 
---
Lol on the trig.
---
Just calm your fucking tits. Itll open. 
---
Don't mind me, just downvoting your useless post.
---
RIP EVE, you'll be forever missed.
---
I'll settle for merely killing someone who attacks me! I've never won a pvp fight.
---
This is a terrible post meiqs. Also why isn't my space pixels loading?
---
You're the only one reeeeeeing here bro. You got caught, it was blatant, CCP didn't even need a full 6 months to think about it like they normally do. Just own it, take the temp ban and move on like everyone else who got their wrist slapped. This whole crying on r/eve about it being unjust is just sad. People used to look at you like some kind of boogey man when they saw you in local, now you just look like some angry neckbeard nerd who got caught cheating and wants to complain about how its not fair and you weren't actually cheating when its clear as day to anyone who has even looked at the software what you did.
---
To stop playing. 
---
I'm gay
---
Are we measuring from the base soft or hard?
---
Reps on server please, HEAT HEAT HEAT
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
- server sends update including wreck creation to client
---
- bot uses that data to send a loot command / client creates a graphical representation of the wreck (this happens at the same time)
---
- player clicks wreck
---
- player opens wreck
---
- player clicks loot all
---
- player curses because all the loot is gone despite him having done his actions as fast as possible 
---
That quote isn't even in the wall of text above, or do you just not know how reddit formatting works?
---
It's not an activity it's supposed to be an event for everyone. It's shit design if it favor those who prefer mining over combat, it's not worth doing if it's just about being more expensive reward.
---
What? HK did nothing more than killing miners and reaping the rewards off skillu in cobalt edge.
---
Not saying they weren't effective in what they did, but it didn't affect the DRF as a whole much.
---
You got other dudes buttholes on your mind? You’re the first person to being up buttholes. Just curious why your mind immediately goes to another dudes butthole. That’s all. 
---
You'll find it in the north. That's where the betas are.
---
I didn't do anything wrong. There is no proof apart from screeching on Reddit.  I'm banned? How do you know that?
---
Maybe im in Bulgaria and will be logging in on Saturday when back.  
---
Then there will be another reddit post Wahhhhhh mar5hy not banned and we got CUCK A DOODLE DOOOODD
---
You will loose your soul there as well and won't have the ISK to pay for a living in hell.
---
You're a beta
---
Havens, sanctums are quite rare anyway.
---
Hahaha RIP / F 
---
How would you design the event to appease every form of player in the game?
---
I too can write in pseudo code, I just doubted (perhaps wrongly) that this could actually be done by botters.
---
I've had a few accidental solo kills with a VNI while completely afk.  So... um... you are bound to get something!
---
This post is awful. 
---
Socket's closed... the moose outside should'a told ya.
---
I see you know a bit about econ. Demand for plex is inelastic, however volume traded per day is not always high. At this stage you're probably best off selling it to Buy orders and getting immediate ISK. The margin between the Buy and Sell orders is not quite so high for Plex, as opposed to other goods. if you like economics, you will really like this game's economy, as each item has its own market that behaves differently from others and the entire thing is player-driven. Everything on the market is there because a player put it there, either by mining and manufacturing or because they looted it.
---
I generally just right click/jump on the blobs in the waypoint list, always in the same place and easier than scrolling through a list.

Recalibration time reduced to 5s could be cool on the nestor.
---
Pascal's principle. The deeper your extractors push to drain the resources of a given area, the more pressure they apply to the 'container' of the planet, thus the remaining liquids seek a level which is higher than it previously was. As not all areas are open/permeable to allow flow to the surface, this pushes more force in some areas, resulting in a greater surge in the open/permeable areas that aren't clogged with extractors. If you pull your extractors away, the slag left behind will eventually be pushed out by the same force, and the liquids fill the trench; if you keep them running, the liquid cannot flow there as easily as it can an open 'lake' and so it will remain lower yeild with one or more other hotspots forming at 'weak' points based on the planet's topography.
---
This is also the reason why a gas planet might see less extreme movement of hotspots than others, because the topography is fairly permeable allowing for local liquid penetration, and the atmospheric pressure more variable, which would make liquids less likely to try to find its own level. Meanwhile a temperate or oceanic planet will have atmospheric pressure closer to our own (meaning Pascal's principle applies consistently), and topography more akin to what we see on Earth, with different areas being permeable/non-permeable/semi-permeable (causing some areas to be more or less prone to hosting hotspots).
---
Metals don't flow, hence why they don't spawn new hotspots as quickly: they're based on minerals in the area being compressed or reacted with in certain ways, and so it's purely a time issue. Any hotspot area will replenish, given enough time, and lower yield hotspots might grow more plentiful over time, but new hotspots don't just ping into existence, because each spot develops in its own right, rather than having a mobile/permeable substance forced into the area like with a liquid.
---
Lol, farming c5,c6 sigs since 2k17, check isk/ehp for these sites ther are 50% worth then anoms

And the code is there to explain how a bot can send his command way earlier

Lonely, said it in discord, but posting here. Looking forward to my first one and meeting people tomorrow!
---
/thread
---
Try hangars instead of hangers, that should work.
---
Exactly the same way it was before. Kill rats to gain points, mine some shit to gain points, gain the booster through points. Maybe change it so that the faction module that loot do need the special mineral or some thing if miners and industrial dudes want to participate in more. But the booster is like the one thing everyone want. Nobody want it behind a BPC with an event mineral to build it.
---
&gt;I didn't do anything wrong. There is no proof apart from screeching on Reddit.
---
You mean besides that screen shot showing you sending the same exact chat message across 6+ characters at the exact same split second in local?

Why are caldari and gallente in reversed order?

You don't have to do that anymore? Been a few years since I've played so sorry if it's a stupid question.

I can send you  screenshot of me fucking your daddy. Doesn't mean its true.

If I did type in local. What advantage does that give me? You know you are allowed to use isboxer broadcasting to login right?  
---
Also if one did type in local they would break the interacting with other players rule. That's pretty much it.   
---
See you on Saturday big boy. Delve will be reeing hard. Try not to faint from the massive hard on you have for me.
---
PI should just be automatic, the ui is dogshit
---
 Is it possible to do something against highsec gankers? Like... ganking gankers? 
---
 "I can send you screenshot of me fucking your daddy" ..." Try not to faint from the massive hard on you have for me." Sounds like you are the one with the hard on.
---
To maybe someday have fun.
---
I recommend going to faction warfare space and learn as you engage people https://m.twitch.tv/evelog/clips Jebi is great at it and it only takes 5-10mil for a t1 frigate so buy 20 of them and start learning what you can engage with them. There's a lot of info online on good solo PVP frigate fits.
---
You can increase your fights numbers by not actually joining any militia but loosing some sec status every time you shoot first at someone. Then you can grind the sec status back up by ratting or you can pay concord to get it back to 0 when you reach minus 1.5 or so for about 100mil per.
---
If you have an income that allows you to spend 100-200mil per week on ships you should be having a great time learning PVP in no time.
---
Yes that makes sense. Scrolls up......
---
5 trillion networth 
---
they didn't get kicked, corp imploded over director/ceo drama
---
You have to read local? Even if more than 2 Test players are in the system? I thought this was impossible...
---
First Id suggest to join corp that can teach you everything you want. You burn out and lose interest pretty quickly if you start to play solo. Try little bit of everything, then decide what you want
---
I keep seeing people use the word focus, as if an art team only works on 1 thing at once..
---
Seeing the CFC and N3 own half the map is pretty crazy. It was weird when that went away.

Thanks for the only useful answer in this whole thread.

Same tho, same... I’m 8 months clean, browsing the reddit to remind me exactly why I quit!
---
I would say breaking into already established ladder would take too long.
---
The only way I would see is take initiative ; start a small corp / SIG and do shit with it so that people notice you.
---
I like how before the eviction they were the biggest alliance in wormhole space with their own blue donut outblobbing everyone, but in the r/eve narrative afterwards they’re this poor little victim alliance that didn’t stand a chance

you are a hero man, i was thinking of this totally the opposite way. thanks!

i did that!!

i came back a few days ago..

Not really. You can try to gank them before they gank someone else but all you'll do is throw away ships to destroy worthless catalysts and talos.
---
You can try to ECM or countergank once they shoot someone but concord usually frags them after their first shot anyway. 
---
[idea] op should stop posting

You are frothing at the mouth a little too much man. We traded, but our ships were more expensive... after we killed the second one, we went back and reinforced the first one ... again. Chill.

u/soviet_elmo
---
your corp members have specific hangars relating to them.  Use these?
---
Sounds odd, but I want to make the single most expensive killmail to ever exist in the game (when I quit, at least). Got a bit of work ahead of me.
---
You CAN be arrested before being charged. In the case of reality, we hold them for a set period of time before release with/without charges, charges must be pressed for a person to be held longer. 
---
Oh would you look at that, suddenly charging suspicious accounts with accusation of botting and then investigating them while holding the offender in limbo is a perfectly realistic course of action. You are being incredibly facetious though, there are TOS and an EULA which directly stipulate how behaviour is to be managed. Everything you paid for is still CCPs property, you have no rights to your character or anything on it. You can say that's bad business practise but so is allowing RMT organisations like FRAT to fester for almost unlimited amounts of time thanks to a nebulous and rarely enforced anti-cheating doctrine predicated on wailing harpies like you defending the rights of AI programs to play a game they're literally contractually banned from playing.
---
So fuckin ban them under the presumption of guilt, a cursory investigation in to their behaviour to solidify it. Let the account owner appeal it and if they appeal and fail then work on punishing their associates for 2nd and 3rd degree.

You wanna talk litigation friend you will find the courts have systems to prosecute you for just about any offence they can invent.

So... Blueprints, skins, face painting... I still have to see this skins, but so far it seems we won't be having anything stellar being rewarded in this particular event!
---
We still have to sit and see how this one will play out though, I hope this one is fun to do at least o/
---
PS; Plz, do not be 1 site per constellation... That was horrible! --"
---
I want some of what you're smoking.
---
Nicely done. I'm sure many have a lot of memories and story's to tell about the history of Sov.
---
It’s more enjoyable because you’re doing the thing you want to do (PvP) to fund and sustain doing the thing you want to do (PvP). The desire expressed by several in this thread for greater isk availability in loot is to prevent having to engage in gameplay that isn’t fun (PvE) as often. 
---
I didn’t advocate for an isk faucet in PvP, though there are several sensible ways it could be considered. Merely altering cost of hull vs modules might address the issue.
---
Only join high sec corps for the purpose of tax evasion; however, be sure to check for war declarations (npc corps have 11% but no war decs)
---
NC or PL? Have you checked where these systems are.
---
i like how you put elminer here too
---
Omega will yield less skillpoints if i did the math right. Daily as omega you gain around 14000 sp. You can combine daily with +3 implants 
---
nice vid 
---
Tough to be solo without a web or scram for control but this is about as well as you can do. Good fights. 
---
Bears, cannon fodder, F1 monkeys, declaring victory on Reddit.
---
&gt;but no further than neighboring systems.
---
no. there are different distances between systems.
---
Lol are you aware that humans die to rats too?
---
You can market-manipulate a limited issue item by only putting a couple on the market for 1tril, and then put the rest you have in one ship to loose.
---
Right? Like the gate in fountain that takes you from one side of it to the other
---
Add ships in form of killmark
---
alpha, for the first few months, is faster.
---
The moment you hit 5 million skill points, it becomes slower. (and that's 5 million total, including from the injectors)
---
right, but then the next question to follow up would be about logistics cruisers, which are much smaller and then even have a small sig for their size class
---
Alpha with +3's = 907.200 SP per month  
---
add 30 x 50.000 SP from dayli injectors you get a total of 2.407.200 SP per month
---
Omega with +5's = 1.944.000 SP per month
---
Cost wise it doesn't make a huge difference. Staying alpha will have the added benefit of being able to get some off-remap skills done early (like Drones V &lt;.&lt;). But it will only get you to 5m skillpoints, after which point upgrading to Omega will be faster than pushing daily injectors (\~1.9m SP per month as Omega vs. 1.5m SP per month as Alpha).
---
Fraternity. 
---
You can't see them on the chimmy because there all on the Nidhoggur.
---
And if they had 5000 tanks on one battlefield it might be impressive. And maybe relevant. 
---
That's pretty much my life. We have a group discord where people send out pings if anything is happening. All of the fun, none of the bullshit.
---
Yup, i try to keep most of my wealth in plex. Also as Eve's sub bottom line drops plex will continue to rise. As plex rises the rmt market will switch from isk to plex.
---
Why would you pay CCP $15 pcm when you can pay a botter $5. 
---
I make my isk in game and would be happy to pay 5 billion pcm before considering to pay real dollar.
---
Brisc get in here someones using copyrighted doctrines again
---
wrong, alpha injectors arent affected by sp
---
Fly with all the best players in the game, to combine their knowledge into my gameplay.
---
&gt;Your... *shouting* is making everyone nervous. 
---
Daily Omega gets around 43k SP without remaps and implants. 54k SP with a remap, and 64.8k SP with remap and +5's. 
---
Alpha without remap/implants gets around 21k SP, and with a daily injector that's 71k SP daily without remaps/implants 
---
Yeah, but I want a genuinely expensive KM, not a manipulated fake one.
---
There are a few ships worth far more than 1t isk, that's easy enough to beat, especially if I use ship bays...
---
Oh man that was a good watch, made me both sad and happy to have mostly stayed out of sov warfare for all these years, until now.
---
Omega Clone on remap with +5s is 45 SP/min, or 2,700 SP an hour. Over a 30 day month, that is 1,944,000 SP.
---
Alpha Clone on remap with no implants is 18.75 SP/min, or 1,125 SP an hour. Over a 30 day month, that is 810,000 SP.
---
A daily injector gives you 50,000 SP. Used over the month, that is an additional 1,500,000 SP. Your total Alpha account SP using daily injectors is 2.310,000 SP over the course of the month.
---
So in smaller fleet sizes the nestors are really really powerful. And infact big fleets theyre not bad either. Our problem tonight was a lack ofnlogi having around 15 nestors on field initially for a 200 man fleet, an issue thats alreay been resolved. Why nestors over cruiser logi? Higher rep power with lower pilot numbers, but again more useful in 30-100 man fleet fights rather than 200 v 200 where alpha is a thing.
---
Shure hope you are , been stroking yourselfs for a while now 
---
So, it's not. Maybe we have some bots but if anyone is found of botting one is publicly executed and kicked. I know that Frat changed. IDK how much. What I know is that it drastically changed before I settled in Frat.
---
It's the free alpha training that stops at that point
---
Win eve
---
Flair checks out.
---
We've got a lot going on, and having the pilots to fill the slots helps a lot lol. Also, we're a pretty chill group, people seem to be having fun for the most part :D
---
Or like my CEO &amp; FC once said "this a joint OP so if you die don't scream in the comms; die with dignity".
---
but would be the first choice
---
Its determined by your imagination
---
who are RL? serious question im bad
---
Caedes and Rabisu (the Blood Raider AT ships) too I think?
---
I like making isk and flying ridiculous ships/pods for no reason
---
Once I start flying trivalgian ships with high grade whatevers I don't know what my next step is after that.  Maybe gating marauders into delve

Good news for you, theres a Raven State Issue for sale atm

Unite all of Eve under a single Blue Donut Banner and reach singularity.

sorry too busy paying the salary of 17 artists who do so much for the game
---
I doubt local or the absence of local had anything to do with that loss. 
---
Local can´t undo ones stupid decision making. 
---
Jesus, what would you do with that much?
---
Like a little frigate for one kill, then a galleon for 10? Would be a cool skin.
---
Or I guess you mean a picture of the actual ship killed? That would be extremely cool.

I mean there's some fine cheesefits for the Coercer.  The basic gank coercer is a solid ship, and  then you've got things like the double web beam coercer, because who needs scram or range control if you can fight at any range and blap frigates before they notice they're dying.

This doesn't really strike me as relevant to EVE. Even if the client is single-threaded, the typical EVE player runs half a dozen clients at the same time so the CPU gets fully utilized regardless.

Meanwhile in other news The Culture, well the culture failscaded and folded into PL and have done....well they've done nothing since...

CCP is adding three new implants that increase the range of scrams by 2, 3 and 4% these implants require the existing _eros_ webifier implants to be built using a BPC.
---
Don't forget the [pink Avatar skin.](https://puu.sh/CC7jV/eda4e7ab2b.jpg) Unfortunately, CCP isn't also taking this opportunity to add a pink Thorax skin.
---
Add skins that you can only apply to ships that have above X number of killmarks.
---
You've clearly never tried to launch multiple clients pre launcher. It was fucked.

Cheer leader and shitpost for your alliance

A little, what if we had another falling where randomized gates start having problems and then others break entirely subjecting the system to a security change and possible region change. A system could turn into wh/ cyno access only and previous pockets could all of a sudden be rerouted to a different gate; low sec transition into high sec or null kind of deal
---
Havens first, then rally points, then hubs. Sanctums are usually too hard/slow for VNIs. Drone space is a bit different but it might be the same level of site... not sure tbh
---
It would seem to be a common theme though, the "still in Bat but doesn't play" contingent? 
---
The Bat old guard are great, and they built what was once a formidable corp but, let's be honest here, Daktar Jaxs alone was worth keeping Bat Country in PL for and he was a 2016 entrant. Bat was taking shit for being afk when I was still around, and that wasn't recent. 
---
The corp isn't unique for having a Discord server and people who get on well. Kismeteer needs more than Reddit post platitudes to make your corp what it deserves to be again.
---
/u/BP_EloKnight can you add this to your CSM Campagne?
---
Damn, have my upvote .....       
---
Oof
---
you're still too kind with the old launcher... 
---
They are leaving NC but not for TEST.
---
scram range and web range all in one implant, no? 
---
What does any of this have to do with PvP though? I Killed you, your launchers dropped and I sold them back to you?
---
That takes no time!
---
EvE
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
Or just make all jump gates destroyable, with npcs coming out to replace them with a buffed hisec Ansiblex Gate, but the npc fleet could be disrupted/destroyed, next fleet that comes out is tougher, etc etc until the gate is replaced. That way the empires in hisec have a continuous program replacing gates.
---
FC I’m catching up; can I bring my drake?  
---
the second genesis of the orthrus is upon us
---
Correct. It gives both scram *and* web range, but the web range increase is not really that much, considering there are already implants that give you a 7% increase.
---
Nice Abyssal mods tho.
---
&gt; keep most of my wealth in plex
---
proceeds to explain why PLEX prices will continue to rise.
---
all CCP needs to do is have a period of devaluation, ie ISK sinks greater than ISK faucets, to make holding PLEX as an investment at least somewhat risky.
---
get the speculators out of the market, or at the very least make it not a sure bet.
---
In space getting yelled at by FC to target the Armageddon when I notice nothing is responding. Eventually I was finally able to reconnect and what do I see in my kill report? Fucking gate guns
---
It was fucked...
---
COMS PlZ!!!!!!
---
but things are also lost, and pvp takes time so time still wins....
---
Exactly :D
---
First few months, you're getting the free SP from being alpha, plus the SP from the injectors. putting you at around 1.5 times normal sp
---
but the moment you hit 5 million SP, you stop getting the SP for being an alpha, and only get the injector SP.

Damn, guess my time in ph was just rough, but I’m dead serious about a cap being dropped when the moon mining fleet was out. I’m glad you guys actually sorted out people to protect the miners, because when I was in ph literally we just had to blue-ball to get the gangs to go away.
---
Carriers are fun though

There’s something satisfying about being about to apply dps hundreds of km away

Also supers are fun

No matter what the narratives are and where they go, I wish Manny all the best, was CEO of one of my first alliances (FAIL.) and I remember him as an all around good dude ....
---
wow, truth getting downvoted, and all the goon narrative posters show up (but muh multibox pve no evil)
---
Gotcha... I always wondered if it was possible, thanks for the clarification. Also great job looks nice, now can you make me a 60% keyboard case 😂
---
Honestly, all of the best fights I’ve been in were while I was in a VNI being attacked by frigates. 
---
64 bit doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
Also, It's cool they have multithreading support, but it's not as easy as flipping a switch or adding a few lines of code. They'd have to re-write their entire engine.
---
Is that avatar made of jelly or silicone?
---
Love it, yes this too.
---
Get a scramkite fit Fed Navy Comet and roam FW lowsec. You should be able to kill everything except kiting ships, neuting ships, and hookbills. 
---
Wrong, PvP Players and a lot of the more adult players that have much less hours played a week (work/family etc.) pay their sub with CC AND buy Plex wit real money to have the ingame ISK they do not crab for. And that is the part that is declining in market (i am in a corp with a lot such guys). This developement was predicted not only by me already 1 to 2 years ago. It happened exactly as we predicted, and the messenger of truth gets many downvotes in this sub.
---
So whats up whit 64bit? 
---
You are winning eve and doing it so well, gj o7
---
There's one particular ship (and its pilot) that I'd really like to wipe out, but will never happen.  The rest of the things I've done.
---
If its me, you should always expect TF2. Or Futurama.
---
Must.... Resist... urge to... downvote for linking directly to eve-o forums cancer uuuuuhhhgggg
---
But I do like this idea.  
---
No, he was a hiseccer who controlled a fairly small portion of the plex market before PH showed up. He made a deal with Gobbins after Horde started blowing all the trading structures up, so he manages the structures and gets some percentage of the profits. 
---
Now he just keeps putting up 0% markets to mess with Test, and we go and save them when we can. 
---
We’re you in diplo immunity? I was too but left because WH life isn’t for me.
---
What the 64-bit client for eve would do is basically allow eve to access more RAM. While 64-bit and multithreading often go hand-in-hand, they aren't mutually inclusive.
---
Don't get me wrong, having a 64-bit eve client is a good thing. It just doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
Also, wargaming is a bigger company that brings in a lot more money than CCP, and they *still* had to bring in intel for help.
---
Real Life. 
---
Interesting. I was under the impression that Kids With Guns alliance were TEST's renters. They seemed to pop up before TAPI made it to esoteria though. Was I wrong?
---
No, especially the flood of incentive PLEX from heavily discounted packages like Galaxy pack should have driven the price down below 1.5 Bil for 500/30days. It did not, most basic economic rules tell you that if the supply is artificially increased (with packs) and the price still is rising, there must be a huge difference in increase of demand compared to increase in supply ... but hey science and facts do not match your koolaid-driven narrative, i am so sorry.
---
Just in time for my Recon V training to complete. weeeeeeee
---
Hot in NES! Killmark SKINs allowing you to change killmarks on all your ships to exotic dancer, male! Only 700 PLEX now on NES!

Hell it was about time, I remember when I used to play WoT just how badly was that game raping one core while the rest lied dormant.

Most of my eve goals were in this order:
---
* Plex my First account in the first month
---
* Plex my first account in the second month and plex my first alt

* Learn how to pvp (failed so badly - lowseck chockpoints)
---
* Have my own small fleet of alts (had like 5 at that time)
---
* Pushed it to 10
---
* Pushed it to 20

---
* Own a decent corp and start to build a great alliance
---
* Learn how to pvp
---
* Meet IRL some great friends made in eve
---
His demand for Plex to sub his botting accounts is gone. That leads to 2 theories:
---
1. The demand that was gone with him is back up due to other increased Multibox-PvE (not just botters sub with Plex, also the guy with 20 Rorqs that works according to EULA).
---
2. The supply is decreasing as less players buy Plex for RL money than the ISK-Buyers demand.
---
What was the feeling of eve players towards Northern Associates holding so much of the map? Did people dislike that the game allowed for that? Lots of hatred against them? 
---
TIL there where webbing implants, wtf
---
after losing two gilas to the fucking drifter battleship wave in abyssal sites, my goal in eve is to extinct the drifters. 
---
But since that's not reasonable, I'll settle for dropping dreadnoughts on them in WHs or some shit.
---
It should have a small graphic one one of the sides imitating on/off button
---
Actually for once a cool idea for the art team. I think that in general it would be nice that the enemy looking at your ship to check your guns could immediately see killmarks. The general idea that a ship would look generally cooler the more killmarks it has would be a nice drive for people that like “achievements”. Of course you can cheat killmarks by killing alts but whatever. With effort you can cheat everything anyway.
---
Gotta give the nanobois something to content with the carrier menace ...o wait.
---
you don't get anything if they upgrade with plex
---
Fun? What's that?
---
This is awesome to hear, stick at it and over time it definitely gets easier :)
---
Killing people !
---
Cap usage.  Yet neuted out and see how useful the active one becomes. 
---
if i had that much i would probably run t1 frigates in fw tbh
---
roam in a Marshall? 5 bil isk concord covops BS..
---
my rorq does not have a killmark bc a vendetta stole my kill &gt;:|
---
Was still more of a hatred of Goons at the time but during then NCPL could take 250 carrier ball groups and throw then across of even with hardly any planning. NCPL would get some hate due to the fact they could ruin fights that they had no reason to be in. Just drop 250 carriers and be invincible. 
---
So, I guess I made a smart move by completely forgetting about my boosters until now?
---
They say logs, but really it's more likely the bot is using Wireshark or something similar. If you can analyse the network packets quickly enough, and you know what to look for -- admittedly, I'm assuming the client either doesn't receive encrypted information, or the encryption is relatively easy to break -- then boom, bob's your uncle, the bot will have the information well before a player does.
---
I say this as a CS grad, mind, not someone who's actually done this. So, could be wrong, kind of hope I'm wrong, but you know.
---
Guess
---
Would be a weird implant to use on an Orthrus when it takes up the slot of Zor's.
---
Which is one reason we went to Horde. Lots of activity, less stringent recruiting requirements, more variety of content. A place to build both relationships and the corp. The EVE meta right now isn't in a good place which doesn't help, but we can put bat into an alliance where there's enthusiasm for the good stuff EVE has to offer and we can find new people to have fun with. 
---
If i had a ££/$$ for every time someone was new in comms and....
---
nevermind I'd still be broke af.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome. Mostly I would just suggest you leave highsec. Join a null bloc or something, make more money and enjoy the game more. You can try to find friends that are willing to put up a fight against the highsec gankers and try to bait them in something that looks juicy but has a very good tank and have friends around waiting to help until concord arrives. 
---
Literally this!
---
This is just the first iteration before the cat ears are added. 
---
There is no shame in dying, since in Eve dying is learning, but its good that you realize there are lot of things you are unaware of - it will possibly save you a lot of isk.
---
Sisi (Singularity - test server) is great for these cases, if you would like to try something but got no idea what to expect or how stuff works, try it on the test server, free ships and fits.
---
I mean literally everything in life takes time. If you're just now making that connection...
---
Dude, you my hero for the day, looks great!
---
that's very useful, thanks!
---
I have absolutely no idea what our relationship with KWGA is about, but i'm very curious 
---
Do you expect an armor pilot to know how to shields? Also why didnt you point out the faction invul?
---
I dont play much anymore but when I was still active my endgame was to set up a crabhole in a nice C4 and start up some moon mining and production. Eventually I wanted to get enough assembly lines running that I'd be a notable chunk on the WH space's section of the MER, just to say I did it.
---
How much isk does that go for?
---
Could they not just increase the percentage of modules/cargo dropped instead of destroyed? I would be in favor of such a change.

This please. I just want corp skins so we can all roll around with the same colours looking cool. Shit charge us  plex per hour used or ship or whatever I don't care.
---
Take the wormhole class you want to run sites in and make it your static. If you run all your sites in your home hole you will just run out of content. I like a c4 &gt;c5/c3 static personally as i can roll either one to find different content.

Very nice!

Pretty amazing to see the Imperium get completely destroyed off the sov map in the casino war to rise again. Kinda like Jesus tbh. 
---
Thx man ;)
---
Great for gate camping tbf
---
If you are interested in small gangs and flying frigates, then you might want to check out Faction Warfare. However, if you are interested in larger fights then you should check out one of the large nullsec corps that specializes in helping out new players (Karma, Brave, Pandemic Horde, etc).
---
After Tropa de elite, Hirr and Syndicate Enterprise? Which NC. crop will be the next one to join Test? Test finally becomes a superpower
---
To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women.
---
Let us be honest tho... If your male it's more likely the only Lamentations you're gonna hear is from your own woman.
---
That really should be the first line of this subred's description. 
---
Player made skins would be terrible. I don't want to see any pepe the frog atrons or merlins with swastikas.
---
Big oof
---
Posting Imperium reddit CTA !!!
---
Attention all bees, there is a thread up in reddit that spoils our narrative hard that everything is ok in the economic meta of EVE.
---
There are at least a few posts we cannot refute with facts, so I urge you to downvote them to make them disappear amongst our koolaid-posting.
---
Thx 4 coming, PAPs will be available soon.
---
Thats such a joke
---
Kjesus, can we get the game to be stable for a few weeks before putting more stupid cosmetic in third heads?
---
Hi how are you?
---
I migt have mixed up the order of words there.
---
I don't believe you.
---
Send Aegor Redd 1 Billion in game and you will be verified.
---
Make local (mostly) infrastructure based (needs refining):
---
* If you speak in local, you show up
---
* If you interact with NPC infrastructure (stargates, stations, etc... Not stuff in anoms or missions though), you show up (or I the case of using a stargate to leave, you are deleted from the list) 
---
* If you are ever on-grid with someone else who is already showing up in local (not cloaked), you show up
---
* If you interact with sov-holder infrastructure, you show up
---
* If you are not part of that sov-holders alliance, only people who spoke or interacted with NPC infrastructure show up for you.
---
* As part of downtime server stuff, every character in each system is assessed as to whether they are on the "show up" list for that system as of downtime, and they are the basis for the start of the list when downtime is over (all other characters on the list but no longer in the system are purged from the list)
---
Local is a chat system, not an intel tool, and the above changes make it fuzzy enough that it's basically ruin it as far as accurate intel goes. 
---
Please re-read the second line on my comment. :)
---
This! Dont play alone! Get into a corp.
---
Maybe run a tracert on it you mongoloid
---
A lot of sports coaches suck as players. That's not what they're here for.
---
hah, i'm 1 year clean and just looking for an excuse to come back unfortunately 
---
No worries my dude, its not a commonly used word. 
---
yes, 8 or so then
---
So in nullsec I can really buy a skiff for example or other T2 ships? I just imagined nullsec being very sparse with ships and equipment and everyone buying creates huge demand with not much supply (as it's nullsec) but it seems I have it wrong. 
---
Even if I can buy the ships and equipment I need in the main trading hub of the alliance, it will still be a bit of a risky thing to move them myself to the system I want to mine? Ideally I'd like to find a nice quiet system for my miner and then use my main for all the pvp related stuff.
---
Let it go dude.  People want to go play a game elsewhere, with other people, doing other things.  You find what you're doing fun, they didn't. Don't get offended by that.
---
Those are just rookie level of terrible, never underestimate EVE players.
---
Speculators are demand too, and when they can see that their “investment” always results in their paper wealth growing it’s a no brainier.
---
Until it isn’t .... then we really will see a shitstorm here.
---
KWG existed because they paid everyone around them for blue standings.  Before we held the south they paid stainwagon.
---
&gt;Third item =&gt; we want player designed skins.
---
heheheheheheheheheheheh. https://wgmods.net/media/pony2.PNG.1600x0_q85_crop_detail_replace_alpha-white.jpg
---
yeah......probably best not to.   we went a bit nuts in WoT with how far the skins went as you can see X.x
---
Reading what stainguy put in for PM skins, it seems like he wants them to sell patterns and a color palette to fill in the pattern with. Not make your own skin fully.
---
That's fair, but activity begins at home too; if Pandemic Legion is inactive, a corp providing 3 active players is as much to blame as anyone.  All those inactive players that are still around in other games are going to magically come back long term now that mean old /u/Rageliner isn't shouting at them? 
---
Bruh
---
In an alternate universe, they could just give players the tools to make skins, there is shitton of talented people in this game.
---
 players could submit them to some steam-like workshop page and ccp could pick the few best rated ones every once in a while (ofc lore/game theme friendly so no need to whine about swastikas frogs and anime girls)
---
Create a lowsec group that hunts the local pirate and hunter gangs, makes lowsec safe for noobs.
---
That would probably be ok
---
Between all three toons combined?
---
Nope
---
Its great, you can do t1 dessie fleets with veteran characters now for shits n giggles
---
old client?!?
---
they just overworked the whole fucking client! that is an incredibly NEW client. and the complexity is simply not comparable at all...
---
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssss queen
---
for me it was owning a titan, since i first saw one in game, now after a 11 year journey i only have to wait another week and it comes out of the cooker. 
---
at that point i will have a super a titan 2 fax alts a dread alt and a subcap pilot who can pilot almost all subcaps well. 
---
its been a long time coming and being that i don't play super seriously or am able to krab particularly hard im pretty proud and super excited. 
---
As a late 2013 starter, I resent that
---
We're not all ignorant of history.
---
Alright thank you!
---
Pandemic Horde Concurs With Test Alliance...  
---
Give us more Killmark related Art.
---
My only qualm about that is that in null there’s really no space to be had without submitting yourself to one of the many oppressive alliances out there. 
---
What a baby. Just submit your ticket, get reimbursed, move on
---
Hi guys. What's everyone up to? Did any of you saw liverpool earlier? God damn what a match! 
---
If you were to get a full custom palette and someone made a McDonald's logo on a ship, could that open up ccp to legal issues?
---
Eve time converts easily into dickbutt time though. If needed, you can convert into dickbutts within dickbutts *within dickbutts*, and that tesserdickbutt is much easier to manage.
---
The pilots were all allowed to apply to other corps, but the corp itself had minimal leadership and didn't meet requirements for a member corp. (yeah, hyuk hyuk tapi has standards)
---
A lot of the members are actually great people and have chosen to stay with us.
---
All I'm hearing here is someone whining about not being given authority when they've done nothing to earn it. If you're not providing something valuable and somewhat in demand to your alliance then your opinion is going to mean very little. There's thousands of miners. There's very few content generators. Guess which one is more valued by leadership?
---
Go out, generate content, make an actual name for yourself, put the effort in and you'll matter. Or stfu and get back to munching rocks. Simple choice.
---
My orgasm begs to differ.
---
They say one minute is short.
---
I tell them ha!
---
&gt; Eve is a game. If you're more stressed than entertained, you're doing it wrong.
---
Underrated last point.
---
You don’t really win In eve, or generally progress, you set personal goals and you fluctuate between being poor and rich and adjust accordingly. 
---
Fact. 
---
I want to own a nyx. In the 10 years I have been playing I haven’t even come close to being able to afford one. 
---
Yes to default skins (Jesus CCP. Just charge 500 Plex for a permanent slot 639 implant that causes skins to be persistent. Shut up and take our money ya retards.)
---
Meh on the rest of those ideas.
---
Yes to citadel skins, citadel interior skins/layouts, and cloak skins.
---
&gt;They're basically honey traps to segregate the Dharen Wakefields of the alliance
---
YOU WANNA CATCH THESE HANDS? 
---
Its not our fault you chose to play a filthy minmatar
---
On a 7 bil clone and with perma pyrolancea iv
---
To be rich enough that I truly, honestly, do not care about losing ships any longer. As it stands, I still sorta care. Mostly because I had to grind for them.
---
Wealth is a mindset! Until plex day comes again.
---
As a certified homosexual.
---
If it were silicone it would have high thermal and kinetic resists. Very interesting.
---
Also OwO.
---
Unless your new alliance is garbage you should be able to procure all doctrine ships and generally-used ships in your primary market hub. If someone thinks they can make a modest profit off those items then they’re probably being seeded. Your alliance should also offer freight services from jita and other empire space market hubs. 
---
is that before or after star citizen comes out
---
Clearly the solution is to drop supers on your landlord until he pays you rent.
---
That's what eve taught me.
---
Interesting. I’ll have to look that up too. Thanks for the info.
---
Although I kinda understood some of that... the only real fleet activity I ever did was a buttload of mining. Been wanting to actually learn how to fight but it’s always been rough finding the right Corp. Only got my feet wet in any combat which consisted of me either waiting in a station forever spinning the camera cause were at war, being the sacrificial lamb to tackle, or roaming around not finding anything with the group I was with.
---
My killsheet or whatever it’s called is pretty pathetic, unfortunately.
---
Yes
---
welcome to f1posting
---
Some will, yes. Others didn't enjoy how PL evolved in the current meta, with people in leadership leaving they previously enjoyed being in fleet with.  I don't get why people are so super offended why some people go AFK or don't want to spend their time and money playing a game they don't presently enjoy or don't enjoy the company of some people they play it with. The PL we joined is not the PL we're leaving, it's not been the same PL for probably two years now. You know that too ;) 
---
If people get offended that someone doesn't want to play with them, perhaps the person being offended should reflect on that rather than lash out.
---
To login or stop caring. Whatever comes first 
---
To lose one of each titan. No fun having them sit in a hanger. 
---
AAAAAARmor HACs
---
Those high damage taken kills are still after resists so really they took 3-6x as much damage as what you see.
---
Someone else posted about this, and I don't mean to come at you all aggro, honestly! I just don't know how else to put it atm
---
If you checked my profile you might see that I work 12hr nights. I can work 6 days a week, and if the gratification is few and far between because I don't "swipe that mastercard" (as someone else put) I'll never get anywhere
---
I think if I work so much I may as well pay to get somewhere or I'll still be grinding out missions that give less than 100k isk for weeks. I'm sorry if that means I don't earn anything from your point of view, but I definitely do earn it
---
well the effort and the amount you have to sacrifice to invade someone to remove them is staggering so its not unexpected
---
vOv Not explicitly, but that's probably where I picked it up.
---
They aren't 0%, they are just below our rates. He's making isk. He's not wasting 4B on Azbels and paying you guys for the memes. He has a pretty good hand on the plex market.
---
I want to find "my" ship in EVE and hit the All-Time Top 10 in it.
---
The sooner everyone folds into goons and test the better.
---
It's this guy, look at his history... 2 years ago PH was killing his structures and he claimed victim to PH and they made a deal. https://www.reddit.com/user/ichooseyou-
---
1 bil per minute.
---
I'd like to own one of every faction capital ship
---
If you think about it, all the T2 moon goo comes from null, and the best production bonuses are found on the structures there, so yes people build and sell T2 ships locally. Yes, traveling between systems has some risk. That's why there are intel channels and jump bridges.
---
The palette is colors to fill in CCP's patterns. Not the ability to make logos. Like taking the police skin and changing the colors on it to pink and purple. Same layout of pattern, but the colors are different.
---
i'm not dead i'm reynolds
---
Get into the null politics. But unfortunately starting a new corp in null sec without being subjugated by an alliance is pretty impossible 
---
Well, Theres only one way to get better at PVP - do it. My initial experience was putting an alt into pandemic horde (they take anyone) and training into a jaguar back before the assault frig rebalance - If I were doing it again today, I'd pick either svipul or confessor and train that and keep taking them out (Tier 3 destroyers dont have SP loss and are cheaper than t2 frigs nowadays because of wormhole farming).  T1/faction frigs are also viable. You could also try brave newbies, karmafleet and/or (that test newbie corp, sorry can't remember). I think most of these take Free-to-play accounts, and you can fly the t1 frigs pretty well with a free to play account, and even make some money with boosted moon mining from the mining frigs if you're coming back free to play.
---
Best of luck finding a corp and meeting your goals! Feel free to DM me if you're looking for more info on the changes.
---
Matalos desde adentro. :D
---
Send it to me and I'll double it!
---
Agreed
---
Kudos on flying a Zealot. Its a very hard fly. Thx for vid.
---
I don't think so. The speculators are people with more than a half brain, they lived in all metas and they just swap to other stuff. They should be flexible enough.
---
The shitstorm will come from people saying "CCPls do something, the mineral price slope is forcing me to mine double the time for my PLEX".
---
Recruit an FC for my corp. Someone who actually *wants* to FC. Game-changer, boy.
---
Feel free to come try again. 
---
LOL, sat down to post this exact question.  Please explain the Anti-ganking and "White Knight Mechanics" of EVE.  As I understand, we have a couple of options:
---
1. Activate a publicly available kill right.  I suppose this must be done just before you tackle them or they will dock up and log?
---
2. Wait for them to get CONCORDED and then destroy their flashy pod?
---
3. Provide reps to victims so the gank fails?
---
Please, am I missing any?
---
I would buy them, jettison them, then shoot them.
---
Just get a Phobos and say you've been at it really hard?
---
it was nice when we were getting evicted though. gave nice heads up even with the ending we got.
---
I mean. Short so that may be, it's still time. 
---
Ah, tbh it’s probs closer to goku than Stuka 
---
hm
---
Do you get a custom paint job included if you buy 8 shitty cars in a row? 
---
Just get another ship from the Beluga (Jump capable Bowhead!)
---
What problem is solved by this and what is not made worse?
---
If you are in goons and you are not jay, asher you  are not relevant sorry 
---
Show initiative, basically.
---
An example: after the Fountain war in 2013, or more specifically, after we won the landmark battle of 6VDT, Test Alliance Please Ignore was essentially in full retreat. As a symptom of this, they were increasingly abandoning Delve, a region they also owned at the time. I was in our blackops group at the time, and we were dropping blackops BS on the few folks that remained. 
---
As time went on, I noticed that not only were evacs happening, but infrastructure was being abandoned. POS were running out of fuel and going offline. So, I got an idea -- I'd try to take some of the valuable mercury and cadmium moons for myself. With that in mind, I brought down two dreads and two rorquals (used at the time almost exclusively as haulers in hostile space due to their ability to fit a cloak and MWD) and started scouting targets.
---
I proceeded to ninjasiege the target moons. However, after a few, I noticed that R64s were also being abandoned. I'd left them off my list initially, because at the time, I figured the main fleets would be coming to take them and that I shouldn't waste my time doing something I'd have to immediately hand over to the direkkktorate. However, after a week or so, the R64s still lay fallow. So, I dialed up the leader of the blackops group, TheAdj, on jabber, and told him what was going down. I don't remember the conversation exactly, but at the end, I knew something important -- our logistics group, GSOL, was extremely busy with Fountain. With TEST in retreat, that region's infrastructure was also being abandoned, and GSOL didn't have the bandwidth to spare on Delve.
---
With that, I expanded my scope, and invested every liquid ISK I had in infrastructure and fuel, and systematically sieged and towered every single R64 in Delve for myself. I held the moons for a month, after which point GSOL finally had enough time and infrastructure to receive stewardship of the moons.
---
What's this have to do with the meta? you might be thinking. Well, as it turns out, there were third parties who had designs on Delve and its R64s. However, since I'd towered them, they had the [CONDI] ticker on the moons. Essentially, I was feinting for the alliance -- hostiles assumed that my altcorp carried the full force of the then-CFC, and they didn't even try to contest them, thinking they'd have a thousand megathrons up their ass the moment they tried. (This is referred to as "ticker tanking.") In reality, the alliance would not have spared me a single fleet, since I was towering the moons for personal use. It's also my understanding that the feint was used as a basis for negotiation later on, though I wasn't privy to the details on that as a line member.
---
The moral of the story is that occasionally, doing things will make you a player. You just gotta undock and seize the day.
---
And ruin the fun for the rest of us?
---
I considered doing the same thing right after Wally's post, then I realized that this is a dumb meme and I let it go. 
---
Imagine losing an entire region and 70+ faction citadels to CVA carebears. Scrubs lol
---
You can be arrested before being charged for a limited time, again we worked this out in the Middle Ages. Well, it's a good thing that CCP disagrees with you on how they enforce the EULA. No rational business, let alone government, goes after people like that, it's unhelpful and counterproductive to their business. It's a child's view of justice that's divorced from the realities of human relations..
---
Get someone to join my small gang noob corp lol.
---
P O W E R C R E E P
---
11.25 km range with a 4% turns into 11.70 km.
---
13km becomes 13.52
---
16km becomes 16.64
---
You would need around 25km range to get a full 1km bonus (26km).
---
While this maybe true for you he is still right, somebody has to sell Plex and, just a hint, its not people that krab a lot that sell plexes, they are the buyers.
---
Veiny thorax incoming
---
There used to be an association for carebears opposed to 'non-consensual highsec PvP'. It was called *anti-ganking*. Problem was they couldn't stop any ganks and spent most of their time infighting and accusing each other of spying.
---
The best thing to do about highsec gankers is to fly smart and not make yourself a tempting target. Somebody made a [list of ideas](http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html).
---
I swear, alliance skins would sell incredibly if done well. Adding ingame identity between player groups will get people buying pretty quickly
---
Hard to focus when hitting blunt during break :) More Kitty ears!
---
Whatever the issue was,  It needs fixing and reverting the behaviour of a weapons/aggression timer.  Getting a timer just for activating the MFJG module is a very bad change for game play reasons.  If it has to stay. Then I put forward the idea that you should only get the timer if the MFJG completed and successfully makes a jump.  Getting a aggression/weapons timer with no fruits for your labour and in almost all cases getting scrambled on the gate with no chance of escape due to said timer is very poor gameplay.
---
Get to 2 Trillion isk and then RMT it just so the MEME can finally be true...
---
I have a Bus Avatar and Levi for sale - 55 Bil each in D-P ♥
---
TBH more like alt predators.
---
I pay extra for the convenience of not having to undock some of my in-training accounts, and I happily pay a margin extra (within reason ofc) for skillbooks in that station/system.
---
Besides I don't see many newbie players having 4m ISK on hand to buy a missiles skillbook.
---
Actually, yeah. 
---
Shitposting is just propaganda, and anyone can participate in propaganda with or without permission from your alliance leaders. In Eve that actually makes a big difference -- wars are won based on who has the morale and momentum versus who starts to failscade, so good (effective) shitposting can erode enemy morale help win your wars. Bad shitposting has the opposite effect, so don't be a total moron when you do it. 
---
Or you can be like me and my friends and just smugpost until PL deploy their supers on your alliance. That was fun, though not a particularly wise idea. 
---
How are people still this wrong about how Goonswarm Federation works ITYOOL 2019?
---
[in game]
---
Kak to tak
---
But then you are a hunter gang too, will you hunt yourself then ?
---
I appreciate the salesmanship but corp prices are cheaper. Or I can make my own 
---
I didn't say anything about the percentages. Just pointed out that, however many it was, it clearly wasn't enough.
---
Abyssal disruptor + arazu + links = at least 65+ km range. Do the same with a rapier and you have a deal long range combo tackle and web. 
---
They should have a skin to commemorate your endless stream of useless garbage posts
---
Your journey sounds much like mine, 12 year vet, 2 Titan Pilots skilled but no Titan yet because I hate krabbing in the too short times I can log in. 2 Super Pilots (old farts prefer Holders over Keepstars) 2 FAX, 2 Dread and 2 Subcap. Titan within the next 3-6 months. I feel excited bout that on one side but then think about people that started 3 years ago and have 10 injected Rorqs and with them earned the ISK for 2 injected Titanchars, i feel pretty much arsed by CCP.
---
no problem is solved and nothing is effectively made worse
---
it's for scrams not disruptors
---
The only one that matters. 
---
That is a really nice goal tbh. Hope you get to it. Don't forget to post on reddit about it ;-)
---
Cancer is made worse.
---
Isn't that how you FW as a pro - snakeset Garmur (T1 Frig) with Inquest Hardwirings etc. sitting in Novice?
---
Please stop posting.  
---
Forever.  
---
don't think of it like that, if you hardcore krabbed as much as them and for the amount of time you have been playing you'd have mutliple titans by now, play the game at your own speed man, i bet you any amount of isk that when you get your titan it will be worth far more to you than those who creditcarded their way into one. remember that the journey is just as important as the destination. 
---
2-4% scram and web range is not significant even on abyssal god-roll linked recons...
---
Sorry, guess you too late https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-the-best-there-is-the-best-there-was-and-the-best-there-ever-will-be-bret-hart-59-17-26.jpg
---
It seems like a case of not being needed or just adding to the cancer.
---
We should reject.
---
good thought
---
Not to mention someone at CCP would have to review each player made skin and such. Another drag on the system.
---
Can't wait to walk in the stations of New New Eden
---
This
---
Pretty meh
---
Fly a covops Falcon and hang out near a likely target for a few hours. If gankers appear, decloak and activate jams.
---
\o/
---
sirens dont scram people.
---
lol fucking power creep
---
Too bad the Caldari have almost no sense of design
---
tfw you try to be edgy but come out as ignorant.
---
just dont fly  in systems who are gatecamped. this post reks of butthurt.
---
bye bye brawlers
---
So, do you want to get a badge of trutrh-verifier?
---
You can purchase one for 2b from me, then i will be able to send you 1b.
---
After that, you are able to play the isk-double games with me, by sending all of your isk, i will double it for you.
---
If this is really a concern for you, you are playing Eve WAY wrong.
---
Word has just come in of this CCP leak of the [Cat Ear Titan](https://imgur.com/a/KwzKPMT) 
---
Noone can hear you Kawaiii in Space. 
---
That's why I did it, sperge. 
---
How bout no ?
---
On PC they just catch the exception and tell you Socket Closed. LOL
---
When is someone going to fix blasters? 
---
Well, there are LOT of amateur speculators, who believe the hype of never ending increases, they will get badly burned when the market turns, and you are right, the inflation puts active players in a bad spot, and those who don’t Bot or legally afk mine/rat in an obsessive compulsive manner, decide that it just isn’t worth it to stay on the treadmill where the idea of pleasing gets further and further away.
---
CCP DO need to act, but whatever they do will cause an unholy Reeeeee. But if they don’t EVE becomes failed serenity MK2. 
---
Do the webbing implants affect the stasis grappler?
---
There really isn't a game mechanic you can use after they start bumping the target.  If their bumper is bad, you might be able to bump their Mach with your own and get the freighter into warp.
---
If they happen to have pilots that are -5 or below, you can shoot them, but most gankers do not let their security status remain that low for long.
---
High-effort, low-probability-of-success things you can do include reps on the target during the gank, or ECM the gankers.
---
Just because you love other peoples garbage doesnt mean its not garbage.
---
Sadly yes....bloody garmurs. 
---
Same as mutaplasmids, this is CCP attempting to come up with unique / interesting rewards that aren't just isk or lp
---
Depends how hard you want to go. To really feel effective in wh space, you need to be able to use scanner + sabre + dps at the same time. 
---
Join a corp, figure out if you actually like WH space or not. 
---
&gt; Just wanted to make sure you weren't playing the "woes me those bullies ganged up on us" card. 
---
not at all that was a great fight
---
&gt; Also wtf why is sash playing for snuffed anyway. 
---
we're joining
---
My ultimate goal is to do solo/small gang battleship pvp effectively. I really love battleships and wish to put the effort in to faction warfare.
---
I also just want to enjoy playing with my mates whenever I can. There was a time i wanted a titan and super and to be super rich - it would be nice but it is not a priority anymore.
---
Thanks, I'm trying! I also mean to do it as a solo or small gang pilot, not just rack up 10,000 kills in an F Domi or F1 Nightmare or something.
---
I would still be very interested in one with visibile dates and possibly notes on big events?
---
The time lapse in the OP is great for the entire history if eve, but if you are looking at more specific happenings it becomes difficult to read.  
---
If you know how to do that we can just ask reddit for input on dates of notable events 
---
Please?
---
Do NOT join a WH corp.
---
If you have never been to WH space just fit a T1 explorer frigate and jump into very first WH somewhere in a quiet system. Keep scanning just to get familiarized with the mechanics. There are some good topics about exploration - read those. Spend some time on your own first, then you would have better feeling whether you want to join someone, or you want to try something else.
---
&gt; So what's the point. 
---
I see what you did there
---
Alright, but I think the translation from theory to practice seems lacking. I know I've seen quite a few battle reports where TEST has some heavy losses and the bulk of the cost is often Nestors. 
---
Citation needed
---
They are down to gank nados though. Thats something thays going to happen no matter what is used as logi. The practise and theory is fine as long as the fleet composition is correct.
---
But did you jump? Cause someone said something like jump...
---
 Build a upwell palatine keepstar in hs I'm sure you will get the killmail you are looking for 
---
Sure, when I increase my wealth tenfold and the market catches up in another 15 years... :P
---
Eve is not for you. Try mobile games.
---
That's the spirit 
---
No, go away.
---
Hangar Take does let you remove things from inside containers. All you can't do is take the container itself (whether packaged or not).

Also, my plan isn't high sec, it's a C1 Pulsar, because I hate myself. 
---
Mine is for some1 to kill my snake pod.
---
*inception*
---
Nah, I'd be the good guy.
---
How do you get your cyno in the destination system?
---
It's funny (and possibly a content generator) when it happens though
---
Just use Rorqual to mine your super! It takes few weeks and Heavy Water fuel. o/
---
I think this conclusively shows the Strat to be the best looking SoE ship. Very nice!
---
Scram range implant, say it aloud and let it sink in.
---
No cock like horsecock
---
Content generation should be no excuse for poor game design IMHO. 
---
Do ship scanners and cargo scanners give any sort of aggression in high sec?
---
I'd sort of caution against this idea though. This only holds true if people in the same coalition moved corps to be in the same corp as the fc, and at that point you're kind of eating each other. 
---
With triexporter
---
works very well but textures are a little hard to work with
---
I think they should allow it. But you'd have to by a separate implant for the pilot of each of your fighters, and they'd die with the fighter.
---
Yep.           
---
How do i see it.              
---
Player registers with CCP as skin designer - he design skin, that is liked by players - he ten need to **pay** (yes pay so we don't have 1000 new skins per day) to CCP specific fee for the skin to be verified by CCP as falling under the rules - (aka no offensive or waaaaaay to silly stuff) - he fuckups - plex is lost no new skin is created.     
---
On the opposite side skin is created and he as "ingame owner" of the skin can apply it to blank templates at some **discount** (this is how he can make profits from it - but this can be solved in many other ways).     
---
Now the pigments - **simply to say some skins have to be cheap... some more expensive** and to solve this lets call materials required for those skins pigments - they come from reprocessing other skins.        
---
If you use pigments (colours) from the event skins - pigments will be cheap, but then colour palette will be limited, also size of the skin will matter.           
---
For example a frigate skin will require much less pigment than one for titan.             
---
How the requirements will be calculated?             
---
Well quite easily - you get the textures ... size they are to cover and get exact value of "how much, what color you need".      
---
**Why make something so not complicated so complicated**          
---
Well it will be easier to code than you could expect, it will bring more demand to skin ... and make people stockpiling skins both from events and from sales, will also make this a separate industry.      
---
Why is it poor design that your ship jumps if you're dumb/forgetful enough to tell it to jump when you don't want to jump?
---
This made me laugh out loud.
---
Not according to neocom2 not tried in game though
---
CCP will validate and publish skins with some fee ofcourse.    
---
I don't want 5000 players creating skins, but like 5-10 players that actually know what to do and can create something by themself rather than copying stuff they see somewhere.              
---
It will also save CCP a lot of work ... work that player will have to pay. 
---
I don't think it's poor design at all, at least in this case. At least they moved the options away from each other. Features working as intended (tm).
---
Alternatively, it builds character/git gud :P
---
Huh. Yeah I like every part of that.
---
Like Esports teams skins. Good idea.
---
Totally agree - but instead of CCP dev ... players that need to register and pay CCP to put in design into a game.          
---
Also alliance logos could be a special case - like you have skin ... and have ability to project the logo on it
---
Clone Vat Bay, use it
---
Who says I'm concerned? It's a game I think this would be fun and cool.
---
#BuffCarriers2019

WoT and other games is not as "true multithreaded" as you (and me) would assume when they say they have made it do multithreading. 
---
Its more like splitting the work load in an assembly line so that one core does one job (putting the engine into the car, lets say) and another core does another job (putting the dashboard in the car). Obviously you can't really split the engine into little pieces so that 16 individuals each does 1/16th of the task to make the task go 16 times faster. And for many things in computing, its the same limitation. 
---
64 bit client is simply a client that can access more memory addresses. So the client doesn't crash when it hits 4gb memory usage. Here are some tips to avoid hitting that memory cap: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while\_waiting\_for\_64bit\_client\_here\_are\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while_waiting_for_64bit_client_here_are_some/) 
---
Converting a 32 bit application to 64 bit is no small thing either, but you don't have to reinvent the core function of the application. 
---
Hehehe my apologies for the faux pas
---
This could have been r/all material, but the subject line doesnt cut it.
---
Needed something like "hundreds of male sex workers sold into slavery" or "largest underground male human trafficking in decade discovered"
---
They do not give aggression of any kind. When combined with a passive targeting unit you can be very stealthy about scanning. There is a very subtle visual effect and that's it.
---
I think thats the point
---
you do know the difference between a scram and point, right?
---
Either kill an AT ship, or take on a fleet with a solo dread.
---
To be good at something useful. So I can contribute to my corp, my alliance, and my wallet. 
---
It locks you ... cannot logout jump out ... but you can be bumped. 
---
I also utilize this as solution but it is not optimal to overcome ingame design. 
---

Just cap yourself out by using a cap-hungry prop mod or offline-onlining a mod to keep yourself under jump cap
---
I hope for something like this. A customizable skin with some reasonable number of color/texture slots and your corp or alliance logo as a sticker or holographic banner. 
---
So your corp can go on Operation Purple People Eater one week in purple Gilas flying the corp logo, and then Operation Blackout the next week in black ones. 
---
In my dreams, this would be a multi-ship skin, so you could fly purple Gilas and black Feroxes in those ops. Would require sets of color/texture areas to be defined on all ships, not unlike some of the skins we’re used to.

Wasn't me.

Yeah who knew jump makes you jump and bridge makes you bridge 
---
That's probably a solvable problem.  I'm not aware of any other mirrors/scrapes of our wiki since eveinfo died.
---
Why C4?
---
Start off as a ls corp and gradually grow larger and larger. Learn to FC and train other members into FCs. Then grab sov in some far flung corner of the map (like the drone regions).
---
I think either the ship class icon stacked up on the side of the hull would be great, and you know large enough to actually see. 
---
Blow up the wreck before they loot it, if it stops being profitable then that’s that 
---
Instead of requiring you to burn 95% of your capacitor in a potentially risky environment to turn it on, maybe it would be better if it worked as a module you activate. It would then pop up a list of beacons/cynos in range.

The Joshua solution: the only winning move is not to play.

At the end of the day, you're a single player up against a mob (or a single player multiplexing as a mob). There's no part of EVE where this is going to work out well for you.

Excluding blops (which have cloaks and short reacts) don't almost all Titans bridge from friendly cits that provide cap? 
---
Though I would agree that a little rework would make the whole bridging process better. 
---
Sites are easy to transition into with my current characters, they're generally less desirable than C5s for site grinding so they aren't as contested, and I like the idea of not having a K-space static to discourage daytrippers. 
---
Would probably make logistics a complete pain in the rear but that's part of the adventure.
---
Oooh so much want. Looks like it's already too rich for my blood though. Good luck!

It's definitely not because I'm planing on manufacturing them, and hoping there will be silly carrier pilots who don't understand the difference.

Good One.

Although I only have the Minmatar and Amarr carrier skills....

how about no. cause its a risk mechanic.

mess up, and you go through. creates content.
---
i mean if you want to remove risk like that, we could let people see other sides of gates.
---
let them see the cyno they warping to.
---
see the problem? less content creation
---
I suppose that’s always a possibility. I just don’t know anything about that meta, such as which ls areas are valuable, as well as the space that is valuable in null. That knowledge is very difficult to come by, and typically just kept secret among those at the top of the alliances.

Dates could easily be done with a couple lines of code (i made the video using Python and FFMPEG, cause i'm a scrub and don't understand video editing software). Showing phases (like an ongoing war) might be a bit more effort, but certainly doable. 
---
For showing an actual event (like B-R) i'd have to get somewhat creative, cause the day it happened is only displayed for 0.2 seconds during the timelapse. I got some ideas tough, i'll see what i can come up with.
---
Devil's Advocate: Why wont CCP get rid of Local? At least in Null and Low. 
---
I'm totally cool with hard mode, but lets make it consistent then? 
---
They seem bent on keeping the best scouting tool in the arsenal, yet when simple QoL UI fixes are proposed everyone loses their minds. 
---
LS space teaches players and corps how to deal with danger and pvp, something that's very useful when you get your own piece of sov. Just grow bigger and bigger and teach your members how to fight and defend space until you grow big enough to grab a piece of the sov pi. Large alliances like brave for example had humble beginnings as ls corps.
---
last i checked htey were working on removing local while avoiding spoiling the surprise by pretending its a bug

no

If you're going to mess with it in the meantime, my solution for the 0.2 s days was to slow down time during eventful dates and speed in up during more stagnant periodes. However, that kind of sounds difficult so not sure how doable.

&gt;I don't think so. The speculators are people with more than a half brain

---
Get a Titan for fleets, then get a meme rag and meme hel/nyx for memes
---
good
---
I just wanna see skin extractors
---
One of the best ways to become relevant politically is to work on getting a spy or two into relevant alliances, and then developing them. This almost forces your leadership to loop you in on things. After your are in the know it’s easier to transition into something more politically engaging.
---
As for custom skins, if players realized how utterly simple and easy it is to make recolour skins with ccp's skin tool then there would be an enormous amount of public outcry against the prices they charge, so it's never going to happen. We got a glimpse of it already when the any skin any ship bug was around. It's basically an automated process all they have to do is click a button and fix bad seams.

 Have been experimenting with running EVE from Amazon Web Services
---
Free Teir (t2.micro) : able to use to download EVE to an ELB to share accross all instances; If you want to keep that EBS arround. Crushed my CPU credits in 20 minutes causing client to freeze until next hour for CPU credits. Avoid.
---
I have found that t2.small and medium often run out of CPU Credits even when paying for a 2GB graphics accelerator. Cost for running per hour \~$0.075.
---
t3.medium was able to run on potato mode without issues, The hardware graphics accelerator is nice at 0.3X per hour . Cost of \~$0.09 per hour.
---
Download of EVE takes place at \~50mb/s from either t3 or t2.Eve full download takes \~20m with installer, even on t2.micro.

Turn sound off, turn graphics to low and disable all effects for best performance.

---
They're pretty new, within the last year or so
---
Skills you'll need: Cloaking, Scanning, Gas Huffing, Data / Relic Analyze.
---
Items you'll want: A combat ship, a cloaking ship, a scanning ship, and a gas huffing ship. A citadel (Weapons are optional, but bring a service module + fuel to try to discourage attacks on  yourself.)
---
You should get atleast one Alpha alt with scanning skills in a scanning ship into your WH in case you roll yourself out.
---
Before selecting your WH, think about what modifiers you want for the ship types you'll be using. Shield heavy? Maybe a Pulsar? The class of WH and the statics it contains are very important for your content. The harder the WH, the more money you stand to make but they get a LOT harder as you go up. Also, the class dictates some of the static combinations you can get. A class 3 sounds great until you have to consider weather or not you're fine with no having the ability to have a static that leads to known space. Is this good? Bad? Less day trippers for you to deal with. More logistics to refuel / get back in.

Depends on what you want to scan. If it's small, fast ships yo might need an interceptor. But if it's industrials, you don't need the lock time, so you might as well go with something less obvious like another industrial, or a random cruiser or something. Not a hiseccer btw.

As sort of an Eve noob, posting on the Eve subreddit isn't a bad way to start, it gives you an idea about what narratives and assumptions other groups have/want to push. In-game, I'd recommend trying to get more participation out of your own corporation to do stuff together/with the alliance, talk to people, etc. Figure out what they want and try to help deliver it (content, WHs to hisec, etc). 
---
In short, you have to get people to know your name before they can know who you are, you have to get people to know who you are before they can like you, you have to get people to like you beogre they'll follow you.

Yes they do. Well more than what they are sitting in is worth.

Does insurance still pay out on a kill right?

Yeah, it is more of my play style that has kept me from getting it. I play casually and then spend isk on doctrine ships. Be broke, rinse and repeat.

I don't know if there's any "guides" to making a successful corp. I think the key is for the corp to have something that other corps don't have. If you can't give a good reason why anyone would want to join your corp over someone else's, you're going to have a tough time.

Regarding the Tri Fortizar:
---
I'm pretty sure NC (and PL btw) were there to defend the Fort instead of killing it. They decided not to engage tough, since Tri apparently didn't form for the timer themselfs (or something else, i really got no idea why Tri wasn't there) and Kendarr was on his way with another Goon Fleet (running late, as usual). So it pretty was pretty much Init + Snuff + Oldschool vs NC + PL + Tri Fortizar Gunner

These are going to be kinda of hard on you. Eve is a weird game and has always been. I would recommended not to worry about money at all. Find something you enjoy to do. Then read up on it over and over again. Check your information and make sure it's up to date. Create alts that help you do what you like to do. Join a corp based around what you like to do. If you get lucky you will join a corp that will teach you even further what you like to do. 
---

1) Find something you like to do

2) Research what you like to do

3) Join corp based around what you like.

4) Have fun!

seeing my RP corporation flourish and own at least 1 solar system either unofficially or by having my own alliance. very hard to achieve when it seems there's a very low influx of new players coming to the game, less so when i do minmatar RP.

Man... We must just be wired differently... For me there is zero incentive to PvP in most MMOs, because it's just yet another grind for gear mechanic, or a meaningless gold star willy-waving exercise, complete with badges or hair dos or whatever...
---
In Eve, PvP is for real... You play for keeps, big boy rules with no takey backsies! You get to put your shit on the line and mean it, and when you lose you suffer that loss... Forever! When you win you know you took the other guys lunch money, and he ain't getting it back... Maybe you didn't get rich from his loot, maybe you didn't even get to scoop it, you walking him in his pod, or worse, and that means something... 
---
Nope, we were there to kill INIT
---
That's fine with me as well. The report should correctly reflect that Tri and NCPL aren't exactly hostile tough.
---
Ha I am glad you felt that way being there, I was looking through all the different groups and it was just like jesus man. 
---
Yep, which makes it a worthwhile challenge to pursue.
---
Please no. I actually wish I could hide killmarks. 
---
Not sure what he's on about but my guess is long range scrams are mostly used by gate campers.
---
That too, as a matter of fact silicone insulate fairly well against EM aswell.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74773321/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74773321/)
---
We're as hostile towards TRI as you are
---
But will probably not shoot them when you guys are on grid
---
Its like you pretend the USA and EU don't have political prisoners of their own. The recent MAGA kids Facecrime public trial and assumed guilt fiasco should tell you everything you need to know about your infantile view of real world law systems. There were multiple groups including FBI backed SPLC going after the kids, even after evidence shows they were in the right the presumption of guilt is still in full swing.
---
Add skirmish links on top of that and the ball really start rolling. I'm not surprised if this ends up being a dedicated regional gate camping implant.
---

Take an updoot. That was amazing.

I am frothing at the mouth, what lol?

They are coming North.
---
This is not a good starter ship for someone learning to PVP. Scram kiting, for starters, is way harder than brawling (or kiting, I think). A Fed Navy Comet is also going to be dramatically more expensive than any T1 frigate, meaning your inevitable losses to early mistakes will be much more expensive than they have to be. Sure, your engagement range is wider, but that also means more things will just run from you rather than fight.
---
Only one other artist was creating actual art.  I'm sorry, but pasting alliance logos on stupid memes is not art.
---
I'd like to own, fly, and lose an AT ship. 
---
Is Dorkness dying ?
---
horde and dotto are neutral to tri, pl is light blue with them
---
Scram kiting means setting orbit to 7km, it’s not complicated 
---
Lol, Init + Snuff + Goons and “no idea why Tri wasn’t there.” The world may never know...
---
I would like to get a frag
---
me too
---
Yes most definitely this aswell, give the player the option. 
---
We have Revenant spawns in Esoteria, so no.
---
It's just SUAD
---
Init + Snuff had roughly equal numbers to NC + PL. If Tri had brought 50-60 people it could've definitely be engageable (even tough PL Stukas would've had a hard time against Muninns + Tengus). The Fort actually died before Goons even made it there so yeah....
---
absolutely
---
because theres that good game making company known as .....
---
To be able to fly, fit, and replace ships of every class in the game.
---
my killboard looks bad because i only take the most elite fights, if its gonna be an ez dunk for me i just warp off
---
good thing you remember now, then
---
Deimos is getting one tho! #nopoors
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion but I'm so happy more pink skins are coming and I'm getting the SHIT out of them.
---
1) green sites usually, or spawned drifters.
---
2) yes
---
You killed a leftover Fort 2 regions away... I don't even know why you're arguing here. It's in NC's interest to have Tri installed in Pure Blind as a buffer entity, especially given the history of cooperation. 
---
The fact is that you will always shoot everything that's on grid that's not Panfam over shooting Tri. You will never interfer against Tri if they have an important timer in Pure Blind and you will work with them whenever you see an opportunity to dunk us (see that recent dreadbomb against Init + Snuff supers). 
---
I'm not saying that you guys are actually allied, but it's definitely not hostile.
---
A dude in my corp did this. He had every single one at once except for the vanq and molok. 
---
Look for people ratting. Then kill them.
---
Southeast
---
This is truth
---
You've got to make some kind of a timeline or sth that people will understand, I'd mark on the timeline by colors or sth by the level of importance, I'd be really interested to read stories of alliances like when it disbanded and some fun facts, not only great battles and ccp stuff, you could go through evewho for alliance members, make cool graphs, go through each system on dotlan from 2007 till now, get the [verite.space](https://verite.space/) script and make sure to make the coalitions as they really were (like for example Ranger Regiment isn't part of Winter Co rofl).  
---
All in all it's not executable by 1 person. I'm really looking into something like live, done by community historical website.
---
talked about eve with a few coworkers and my supervisor overheard, they joined in and convinced me to return.
---
The mass Chinese influx might be something worth including. The arrival of the bulk of frat. 
---
Just think about the pvp possibilities! Amazing :D
---
fc what is escalation
---
Besides the obvious like green sites and activity, I look for holes with capital size connections (k162's &amp; static) for easy solo rolling. 
---
And for your second question, I run green sites in home because why not? They are just lower effort sites. That being said I would never shutdown the chain in home or static unless I was in a krab hole or it was 3am.
---
thanks for your answer

Every time there is a market shift in eve a pile of people get burned because they speculated the wrong way or on the wrong thing.

When I start to play again I want to start a PvP wh corp. Just start raiding other people's stuff

selectable damage type, lots of lows for dps, a lot of people already have it trained, less gun management, some people just like them
---
Nah, [the original is the only correct one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcmWaz_UTBQ&amp;disable_polymer=1).
---
Yeah. It’s like an elite gate xD
---
The real cost is in the rigs if you choose to put them on. If you're just fitting it and not putting rigs on you're looking at a total of maybe 1-1.2bil including the cost of the raitaru for a t1 fit. 
---
You're looking for this: [https://www.empiresofeve.com/](https://www.empiresofeve.com/)
---
Gallente T2 resists are strong against railguns, which are used on Megathrons, Eagles, and Feroxes, all doctrines seeing heavy use right now. 
---
What is your asking price for this?
---
Ishtar fleet are not used in a main fleet setting. Though if flown properly, Ishtars can be a brutal ship to fight. 
---
Shield Ishtars look good on paper and allot of groups try to use these. They are absolutely trash. 
---
Armour Ishtars are the way to go, you are able to use a decent amount of ewar. But the only way to make them work is to use speed implants, speed drugs and boosts.
---
Also to make armour Ishtars work you need your fleet members to be competent enough to spread their ewar across the hostile fleet without the FC worrying about it. This is oddly enough the hardest part. Most likely due to the majority of players being trash at managing their own ships.
---
I do. I'm a part of goonswarm and want the data from 1dq can you tell me on how to do it?
---
"  Galaxy pack should have driven the price down below 1.5 Bil for 500/30days  "  The price WAS down to 1.5 for several months. And it didn't start to rebound until after the last offer ended, its now pushing 1.8 per and climbing daily.
---
"It did not, most basic economic rules tell you that if the supply is artificially increased (with packs) and the price still is rising, there must be a huge difference in increase of demand compared to increase in supply " This would be true if it wasn't for the fact that a month after their last deal offer the price started climbing again.  
---
" but hey science and facts do not match your koolaid-driven narrative, " You put market theory in a blender and came up with a nonsensical view of why prices change and threw in the word science because you forgot to use the word math instead. You're the one chugging the koolaid buddy.
---

Ah thank you!
---
So basically the same thing.
---
&gt;Wrong, PvP Players and a lot of the more adult players that have much less hours played a week (work/family etc.) pay their sub with CC AND buy Plex wit real money to have the ingame ISK they do not crab for.
---
You're misunderstanding what I said. I'm talking about people who buy plex on the in-game market to pay for game time, not people who pay cash for plex. Which is what I said PVPers do, they tend to be the ones funding their play with plex and subscriptions.
---
Have chat work
---
CCP demod a skin tool in the past where you project coloured shapes and stuff onto the 3d model which it would then render onto the texture. Shame it never went anywhere.

its impossible to know without knowing the rigs and services but 4b sounds fair for something decent

Ooooo.... I like this.

Don't you get wrecked if they slingshot you by 1km though? I guess I don't fly scram-kiting ships, so maybe it's easier than I think it is.
---
Be careful buying structures, its prime scam territory as one of you has to hand over and trust the other will reciprocate.           
---
              
---
If you plan on manufacturing consider the costs of running the service and buying it vs just paying to use someone else’s along with the risk of it getting blapped.  
---
Stealth Proteus buff?

My previous corp had a officer take offense to being told just that. Couldn't drop it and went full sperg on the alliance. He got the corp booted, but I brokered a deal for my friends and self to transfer corps and stay.

You ever realize that on the internet not everyone speaks English as a first language
---
based on the naming ('Eros') and the ingredients ('Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls') - this is a limited event for Valentines day (14 Feb) - I don't think these are being added 'permanently'.
---
If you’re fighting a brawler, odds are both of you are webbed, unless one of you is doing something very wrong. So there isn’t too much room for maneuvering, especially with how fast fights go; if the brawler pulls range to get the slingshot off, he’ll have taken too much damage by the time he comes around for it to be worth it. And if you’re orbiting at 7km, odds are he won’t get out of scram range. 
---
If you go into the plex with a brawler you generally just need to align to something and hear your AB, they will chase you and that cuts down transversal to zero, which will do something to help you out, since long range guns track less. However, if you set orbit at 7km on something within 1km of you, you’ll still end up burning directly away from them. 
---
Against kiters, it can be tricky if they start with range control, but that’s why I’d advise not fighting them at all 
---

What sort of ewar would you take with an Ishtar fleet?

Imagine being literally removed from Catch, even when NC tried to bail out PL, losing every citadel and Fortizar there, losing citadels and midpoints in Curse, losing 1 trillion in ships for an Athanor defense timer in D-G, losing KillahBee to NC, then losing Providence to CVA and 70 faction Forts, then losing World War Reeeeee and running back to daddy NC for cover. An alliance would literally have to TRY to fail that much.

Hey man my corp is late US and AU TZ we have a few kiwis fuckwits as well as some air force fellas in Japan. We live in a C4. Hit me up and I promise you’ll never regret moving to spooky space 
---
I'm having fun playing it? What are you doing? 
---
Firstly Install GESI into your sheets.
---
https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI/
---
Once you have that set up and Authed you need to find the Structure ID for the Citadel you want to pull the market for. There are 2 ways of doing this.
---
1. Link the Structure into a chat channel and send it. 
---
   
---
   Right Click the message you sent and click copy. 
---
   Paste into something out of game (Example of what should show when you paste: [21:43:19] Hyperion Kado &gt; &lt;url=showinfo:35833//1026693248345&gt;LHGA-W - In Rust We Trust (Requiem Eternal Holdings)&lt;/url&gt;
---
)
---
   The large number after the // is the structure ID
---
2. Using ESI you can pull the structure ID with this equation in Sheets.
---
   &gt;=characters_character_search("structure","LHGA-W - In Rust We Trust")
---
   The ID will be in the last Column
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Once you have the ID you can then pull its market with this formula
---
&gt;=markets_structures_structure(ID goes here,,-1,TRUE,)
---
Note the Pull may take a little to load depending on the size of the market. 1DQ might take a min for so to pull that much data.
---
The pilot was in a cap before it, the cap died, and the guy for some reason switched to the bustard and when the killmail was generated, the game registered the bustard as the ship that inflicted the damage.
---
Running sites in your own system is a double edged sword.
---
If you don't, when someone comes exploring they see a system full of stuff, and might decide the system is empty, or at least infrequently checked. This is how you get unwanted visitors.
---
If you do, when someone comes exploring they see an empty system, and might decide it's heavily occupied and thus a good ganking target. This is how you get unwanted visitors.
---
I run the sites in my corp's system, because I'd rather have the regular explorers move on. You're always assuming there are gankers around, so having a system appear occupied really isn't any different. If the threat of gankers is keeping you in your citadel, what are you even doing in WH space in the first place?
---
armor ishtars are garbage and shield ishtars are passable
---
it's me reality
---
Dude you are awesome if I was rich I would pay you:)
---
real talk why does your corp *need* a home 
---
What is it about goons that gets people so salty lmao it's like magic
---
both of those things can be true if you're not intentionally obtuse and redictionist
---
more lore with no effect on the world
---
I don’t know what you mean, Snuff (plus goons plus init plus the family dog, probably) would definitely never escalate on a fortizar killmail fight. Snuff only brings equal doctrines in equal numbers for gudfites.
---
you don't, the math was done in a previous reddit thread shortly after tapi claimed to be defending against "all of eve"
---
Months ago, I was scanning holes looking for easy pickings, like haulers jumping into J-Space from Highsec. I was in Torrinos. Found a hole, c2, and while I was camping the HS connection, checked the signatures inside of it. Found another highsec hole, went through it, and I ended up in Torrinos again. It was a hole with two connections to the same system.
---
This is the reason for the post. I'm just trying to understand the WH'r mind better.
---
Can’t. Will get forced out by another corp with 5 allies or some shit. Cause blue donut
---
And why is it in Hi-Sec.
---
Im a ganker myself, just trying to understand wormholer operations better. This is an informative post so thanks.
---
That would be cool I guess, but there’s still no real way to make any headway in null or even LS at this stage of the game, where those who are already living their will just batphone in someone else to evict the new guys. 
---
This is a blunder made by strictly Americans.
---
You heard it here first folks, 2+2 = 5.  
---
If you can only afford a raitaru, you are awfully small for a corp. 
---
Putting a structure up will open your corp up to wardecs. 
---
Can’t. If I did that and try to take my own space some asshole with batphone and the new guys will just get evicted 
---
imagine being so desperate to claim a win that you're still chestbeating over a year later about "ending" a no-supers content deployment by only batphoning goons *a few times*
---
and then also chestbeating about halting an offensive campaign into your space by batphoning goons, but not before losing 2 keepstars and the world first moreau fort
---
largely because, goons having gotten bored of forming up 500 dudes in delve to get blueballed over raitaru timers in geminate, you've run out of minutes on your batphone plan or something and can't seem to make any progress on your ~~death~~ jump clone deployment to twist the knife or whatever mittani-ism vily has decided that tapi is gonna use today
---
just
---
imagine
---
I dunno about goons man, to be perfectly honest it’s too easy to get blacklisted in there. Not to mention that everyone is basically the leadership’s puppet. 
---
Nah man. The blue donut prevents this idea of “building power.”
---
rude
---
...you mean like pl did in catch last year?
---
holy shit are you actually a goldfish irl
---
I’ll pay 10 isk
---
Hey that makes sense. Thanks for answering!
---
Add loot boxes with stat track skins.
---
If your in hi sec. Use a station. The moment you get a structure, your going to get a war dec.
---
Plus it doesnt sound like you guys are ready for one.
---
also valid
---
Do supers count as the same spawn as titans? I've heard of and seen lots of people in delve getting titan spawns but I haven't heard of any super spawns here.
---
I can kinda confirm this. While people complains here, ingame there's people farming the sites all the time. I even earned a good amount of money mining the event ore, as much as I would mining r32 moon ores, and that is what matters. As long as the players keep consuming the events, CCP will continue developing them in the current way.
---
The only thing I disliked are the manual claims of the rewards, and some dumb objectives like pvp in barges. Other than that, It's a regular PvE activity. 
---
They pay you a ton of money to leave them alone, like they have with everyone else. They're a botting alliance.
---
We usually bring crucifiers, usually with range scripts loaded 
---
We use them as a counter to Eagles, as Eagles are a good counter to Muninns
---
Not so sure about the loot boxes but stat track would be would be some old school cool. 
---
if only
---
Even as colour by numbers skin would be better. At least then corp fleets could be corp colours. 
---
were you just moving an implanted pod withing being in an interceptor? 
---
It's fine to only have one account, although alts can be useful in J space they're by no means mandatory if you are playing in a corp.
---
As far as I know, for Sanshas Nation the Revenant replaces a potential faction titan. So, there are no titan spawns in Sanshas territory and no super spawns other pirates territories. Bounties and drop-values should be the same in principle. 
---
Never ever ever issue a courier contract without the correct collateral. If you're joining the Imperium, we have our own logistics organization that will jump freighter one full load to delve for free for you. You can look them up on the forums, pm me if you need help. Otherwise I'm sure the other big alliances have similar programs. Also wait till you're accepted and talk to someone before handing over all your stuff for transport.
---
Like others have said, you will make significantly more money in null, so if it's only a couple hundred mil in ships, you might as well just leave/sell them in highsec
---
Drop 400 dreads on Snuffs faxless superblob.

Wurm online, a game where finding content also depended on local, and there was a local list identical to EVE's. A steam minecraft esque version came out where you mod your own servers and shit, some of the same "REMOVE LOCAL, JUST DO IT, JUST DO IT IT'LL BE GREAT BUT I HAVE NO EVIDENCE OR SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS JUST DO IT" people plagued the game, each one of those servers shut down in the month because absolutely zero fights happened because you absolutely couldn't find anyone, there was a situation where someone even walked within 10 tiles (think minecraft) of someone and just walked away because they didn't wanna fight anyone at that moment. If you want a more solid argument and more in detail of the game itself just pm me, you're the first to actually want to hear the other side instead of 'naw dawg you're retarded just remove local' on reddit.
---
If you can't defend it from war decers don't bother anchoring it, with the new war dec mechanics having a station in highsec just makes you a target, especially if you are a small or indy related corp.
---
Nope!
---
good to know.
---

Oddly enough, the problem went away on its own. Thanks to everyone who tried to help.

---
I'm pretty sure neither pl nor NC. Gave 1 fuck if that forti lived or died.    Lol
---
They're fun but they're not really something to worry about when you're new. A newer player will find himself far more disappointed by the cool subcaps he can't fly but he sees are constantly called for in fleets. I think this bro should get his money situation settled and then train/inject for those doctrines his friends need him to fly. Carriers and such are toys or strategic assets that come later.
---
The "drones are bad" thought process came about after a patch that made it so only 10 pilots could assist drones to a single player. Gone are the days of the past of slowcat carriers in droves with sentry drones assisted to a sebo'd Loki with a target painter, deemed the finger of God.

---
its gets people who love the game salty because the goon game style kills EVE. The Chinese play like the goons but even more so, blueing up huge amounts of characters and krabbing so hard that they have huge capital proliferation and endless money. In the end this literally killed the chinese server as all players were pretty much in one single group then the server shut down. We just want to avoid that

Ugh, that killmail doesn't count because it's not a solo kill. Mwehh

I lived in wormholes for a long time until recently. I sought either vanilla or magnetar holes preferably with a single static connection and a several data/ gas sites. I very rarely ran green sites out of home and over many years in J-space never lost a single ratting ship to ganks. 
---
The data/gas sigs protect you from anyone that hadn't already scanned and bookmarked those sites. By running them, the hunter's best bet is to combat you after dscanning you down but if youre on the autism spectrum with your dscanning (which all wormhole dwellers should be), you'll see the probes and instantly MJD out and get safe.  This is opposed to seeing a sabre already in warp to you on dscan instead of probes. That extra reaction time is all you need to live. 
---
Still, I preferred to krab in home and I was slightly more brazen with it especially if we had some people logged in. Properly fit nestors are tough to break unless you have more than one Bhaal on grid. Knowing this, and having backup seconds away, I was comfortable running sites in home. 
---
Thanks for the response. Unfortunately it hangs on get tripwire data. It is able to detect if the user/pass is incorrect so it's not that. I guess I will just have to use it for inserting myself into null space.

Instead, you should just hand that ISK over to a high-sec griefer corp like Marmite. Spare them the expense of declaring war on you. Have you seen how fast a few Leshaks can take down a Raitaru?
---
A bigger Corp I’ve been in would save those sites for escalations and crit every static. We were a big enough Corp that people wouldn’t want to do our sites because there was almost always activity.
---
Do faction warfare corps with LP buyback programs still exist? 
---
Cool! TIL.
---
Having enough people around to discourage gankers is a great thing, provided you have enough content to keep everyone satisfied. It's a delicate balancing act that I wouldn't want to try and tackle.

In general it seems like CCP knows lots of the major problems and wants to fix them, but they're finding it difficult. Local chat for example I'm sure there has been hundreds of hours on CCPs end trying to fix it, but they simply haven't made any noticeable progress. 
---
CCPs main problem in recent years is keeping the community informed as to what's happening with various issues, something that seems is getting better, aka making a blog post addressing the broken local crap.
---
To have control of the entire constellation I live in, plus one nullsec system. A freeport keepstar in one of the lowsec ones for trading, and a fair few friends to bullshit with.
---
I dream big.
---
I must admit that (living in a wormhole), my finding content really doesn't rely on local. Nullsec is definitely bigger than w-space though and has bigger systems as well. Thanks for your reply. You've given me a bit to think about.
---
&gt;CCPs main problem in recent years is
---
they've actively worsened the state of the game, through vastly unpopular UI changes, to introducing skill injectors and f2p, to ignoring the mass increase in botting activity, and their failure to iterate on broken systems and mechanics
---
the outcry is dying off because people are just quitting the game
---
5 years ago the PL/NC gamestyle of helicopter dicking anyone they wanted for fun was killing eve. 3-4 years before that the Tech cartel of the old school NC was killing eve. Before that BOB was killing Eve. Same reeeee different reason.
---
Blob sent fleet of vnis do take them back but lost to forsaken hubs on the way there

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

I love how every time someone gets downvoted while having a discussion with someone using a goon flaitrthey instantly blame it on goons, and not people in general disagreeing with what they said.
---
why? i thought farming horde was their main content.
---
I miss the adrenaline rush i used to get from pvp.
---
Old junkie btw.

Just roll up an orca toon and haul all of it back every 20-30 min.  
---
You'd be better off asking this question on Jabber. I could give you some hints, but I don't want to also give the hints to every Tom, Dick, and Harry reading here.
---
One day I will oneshot an AT ship with my artillery Panther.
---
nah we roamed space and time with free will! we just happened to find more horde than anything else...
---
I feel like we already had this thread...
---
and thinking.
---
literally what am i reading
---
Imagine there's no CCP
---
It's easy if you try
---
No citadels below us
---
Above us only sky
---
Imagine all the pilots
---
Living for today 
---
Imagine there's no alliances
---
It isn't hard to do
---
Nothing to kill or die for
---
And no corporations, too
---
Living life in peace
---
You may say that I'm a dreamer
---
But I'm not the only one
---
I hope someday you'll join us
---
And New Eden will be as one
---
Imagine no Fozzie Sov
---
I wonder if you can
---
No need for entosis 
---
A brotherhood of man
---
Sharing all the world
---
And the New Eden will live as one
---
how do you see all time top solo?
---
the beauty of eve if how much things change. contact some of those old friends and reconnect or dind a new corp.
---
theres no reason to be unhappy about your videogame corp.
---
How Reavers shut down the North. Your comment is exactly why everyone knows you know nothing about the state of Eve online.
---
&gt;Ishtar fleets are not used in a main fleet settings
---
For those who do not know;  
---
A capital that ejects an unfit Nestor is using its fitting service without waiting for a mobile depot timer. 
---
"I'm left in a position where I can't move forward." follow the guys you liked to where they went, it sounds like you more enjoyed the game because of who your where playing with and not what you were doing, getting back to that will most likely be more fun then what you are describing now.
---
Come to provi. Lots of  groups here will give you a shot
---
These days corp history doesn't matter a whole bunch.   
---
There are plenty of organizations out there that love industrialists,  I'm sure you can find a new home.   
---
Or as above,   contact some old friends! 
---
Playing with people you like matters more than any alliance or corp ticker.  And way more than the space you currently call home.   ;) 
---
You've been playing for a long time like me, all that is in recent years in my mind :') 
---
Whilst a lot of that is true, not all is bad. Yes I personally hate some of the  new UI changes, particularly to the skill queue. What other UI changes have come through in recent years that are so awful? The main problem I have with the new UI is seemingly lots more lag, but don't necessarily blame the UI directly for that. 
---
Skill injectors I also personally think were an awful idea, but CCP is a company and they have to make more money every year, it's just the sad reality..
---
Bots again, major issue. But the solution obviously isn't so easy... Honestly they need to outsource the detection of bots to players somehow. Maybe trusted reporters with high accuracy get more points.. if a bot gets to a certain point it gets manually investigated by CCP or some trusted community member.. but those kind of changes are hard and take time.. so it's really difficult to say that CCP is failing to do anything. It really just comes down to poor communication on their part, not keeping people informed.. 
---
Because Ishtars, in the hands of competent pilots, led by a competent FC, can absolutely wreck other subcap fleets. Reavers started with VNIs, then moved on to Ishtars, in the lead up to the war in the North and were highly successful with them.
---
Stiletto says lol
---
Would love to see a some options below the skins settings for large, small, or no kill marks, with color being skin light color or default. 
---
Obviously you were not paying attention to the game this time last year. It's ok, we all know you are an idiot.
---
This year, we're barely a month in so there's not a huge selection of great stream moments to choose from.
---
&gt; someone who attacks me
---
That's because you got jumped on. People pick fights they can win
---
Come find me in game through private messages. 
---
I dont see why you cant just move corp?
---
An inactive KB just rules you out of Panfam, what industrialist would want to fly with them?
---
Unless you are on some blacklist somewhere im sure a TEST  corp would have you.
---
Have CCP acknowledge my Eve videos :)
---
Fake (would have access to this info if was actually in Goons) and gay (claims to be in Goons).  
---
Lowsec
---
Same as Null my guy. People like snuff will just batphone their goon friends. 
---
'F' is for friends who gank stuff together.
---
'U' is for uranium. rounds.
---
'N' is for no survivors, when you pod them all.
---
Sent me a link i wanna check it out as well
---
It died because of the jump changes. It was mostly either gone or in the process by the time Fozzie sov actually rolled around.
---
Same reaction, more like wtf wow
---
  Just wondering what godawful shit youd have to pull to get out on a blacklist for test???  
---
Pathetic recruiting ad is pathetic. 
---
There are plenty of systems in Delve still.
---
Maybe Ayrth learned more anom nerf incoming?
---
I thought they are going to Curse 
---
yikers, must've hurt you at some point
---
Can’t you just take out a loan. /s
---
Yea Htp, Trc, and friends, cva is kinda hemorrhaging people at the moment so they qill take anybody, i mean anybody.
---
World of warcraft also recently finally introduced proper multithreading support.
---
The blacklist used to be visible to members. There were some funny/awful shit on there
---
No good security person says that. Just that it alone is not a viable method of securing your computer
---
well at least you are using the right flair to post something that stupid.
---
Why didn't you bookmark 
---
great spy resume
---
8/10
---
Blood of gods lets play hide the sausage
---
How exactly does the passive targeting system work? So within a certain range from ship?
---
 Some of that I can understand.    But,  doesn't dreddit just kinda recruit anyone and everyone?   Lol
---
If you have a rorq and are in goons, you should know better than to ask reddit how to use it.
---
Hi teff miss u BB
---
Initiate generic recruitment post  #172837
---
But in all seriousness reach out to the old crew you flew with, a corp is just a name theres no reason to hang onto it when it's the people in it that make it something
---
TEST lets quite abit go but if you're an actual Nazi or you did something like what Skruff or Teo did then you're likely to have to move on.
---
I wish I could buy 8 shitty cars in a row, then take them home and put on my infinite custom paint job I already own though, just like the current skin system, that would be pretty cool. 
---
If you're planning on watching a pipe to scan for juicy targets, most folks just use a disposable T1 frigate, then have their DPS a couple systems down the line.
---
Happy birthday Fawlty7
---
Just send me 1b and stop embarassing yourself. 
---
Hahaha
---
I thought the same thing.  
---
Then I thought...   why not help a guy out?   
---
Even spais have feelers too
---
1. Have no targets locked.
---
2. Click the passive targeter
---
3. Click the other modules you want to activate (cargo and ship scanner)
---
4. Lock a target. 
---
Your modules will then cycle but the target will not see you yellow-boxing him.
---
No, try creating a smooth gradient in photoshop in 32bit and then converting it to 16bit
---
I think it was more of an do-not-accept-again list. Some had expiration dates on them, albeit years
---
Additionally love to the DV bros, who allow us non Russian, crazy Aussies, to come along in their fleets, big thanks to the translators who allow this to happen 
---
It does fade but I find small gang or solo.still does it for me. Big blob fights are as boring as pve now unfortunately. Maybe I need a break lol
