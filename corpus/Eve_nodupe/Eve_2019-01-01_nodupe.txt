using a widow and legion logi on a single carrier is kinda irrelevant because the hull of the widow alone before fitting is almost the price of the carrier post insurance, makes no sense. A super will alpha thru reps of the legions easily unless you have a pretty high amount of them. It's just not worth it

If you take the bonuses into consideration, then yeah I'd say that's accurate

Sure thing, sweetie.

Ok, how are you going to explain the fact I upvoted this as goon?

FC: "Avatars warp to gate"

FC: "Erebuses warp to gate"

Random fleet member: "FC you didn't call my titan what do?"

FC with dismay and laughter in his voice: "Armor ragnarok warp to gate"

Another good classic throughout the year:

FC: "Jump to [Hostile Dictor](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114407381/)"

Entire titan+fax+supercarrier fleet thinks "uuhhhh, ooooookaaaaaayyyyy" while questioning if it was the FC who talked or someone else with a very similar voice.

True, with the plex, the Multiple Char Training and extractors they're almost begging you to set up a skill farm.

At least half the time the northern line-members were told we blueballed them, they just stood down because we had massive number advantage and the north didn't want to risk even showing up against spodbrains (One would assume their eliteness would make up the difference in numbers). Ironically this probably tired out the northern line-members more than it would if they showed up and lost. 
---
Of course, space barbie comes first. 
---
Fun. You should always try to maximize your fun/hour. Do what is fun for YOU, no matter what others think.
---
More like "Baddies have pinged for this fight and we are outnumbered so we're going to tell our line-members we got blueballed because we care so much about our killboard that we'd lose our sense of pride if we traded badly against waves of spodbrains". 
---
It's a shame because this is a good one. 
---
Whats ur tz?

and yet the vast majority of non russian jspace were rushing to help them. Maybe they did maybe they didn't but it's pretty rich seeying kspace nerds calling them oppressive or blobbers or some shit and that wspace is better without them while completely ignoring the fact that most relevant and smaller entities were rushing to assist them. If they just wanted to evict them sure, whatever, but drop the pathetic excuses and posturing when the numbers are freely available.

Y'know what? No. This past year has been a fucking dumpster fire and I don't see this one being an improvement in any way, shape, or form, and I'm tired of pretending differently just to protect the delicate sensibilities of a bunch of snowflakes.

I hate HK and HK hates me even more.

Even I said that I'd offer my support and expect to get rejected.

It was kinda schrodingers eviction. I felt bad that they really had no chance and really just got blobbed but at the same time I felt it was just deserved and was eating popcorn the same time.
---
If it was a giant wormhole coalition that evicted them, no one would say anything to support HK. the only reason that there is ANYTHING positive about HK is because there is a tiny itsy bitsy part of every wormholer that feels bad that it was because of 1000+ null nerds.

When the history of EVE is written, two chapters are about him exclusively. Like him, loathe him, but you sure as hell can't ignore him.

It is not direct because of PLEX but any non-alpha account in the game generate revenue for CCP. While we can pretend all those PLEX used by bot account would still be used but by legitimate player, we can't actually confirm it. We have to remember that CCP does not really care whose money they end up with in their bank account, as long as it's ~15$ per month of someone's money per account in omega state.

I don't think this is actually what happened.  Everyone keeps saying it, but I have yet to see any real proof.  In another thread, a guy claimed this, but it ended up being some other group entirely.  I think HK became the boogeyman because they're good, so now whenever there's a wormhole eviction, HK is the presumed culprit. 
---
Pls CCP, need new corp uniforms.

Dude on comms was telling a story about his time in the military, and how him and his friends were hanging out with females of questionable choice of occupation in a land I cannot recall, maybe Singapore. They were pretty drunk, and were not only questioning the occupation of their new friends, but there was also some question regarding what type of equipment they were born with... I do not remember all of the details, but I do remember the line when he says, 'So I grabbed her by the beer can.' 
---
Beer can quickly became a corp meme, and eventually now a banned meme topic.  
---
Nein, bitte nicht awoxen, nicht das face, bitte nicht. 
---

---
That makes sense.
---
ah ok. i agree there. i think a big part of the issue is economic incentive more than mechanic. t2 mats have gone up while carrier and super costs have gone down yet insurance hasn't changed meaning losing a carrier is a 300-400 mil loss while a blops is only getting back 100-200 mil.
---
Against supers yeah makes sense. thought we were talking carriers

&gt;While we can pretend all those PLEX used by bot account would still be used but by legitimate player, we can't actually confirm it. 
---
We can't confirm, but over time, and with no bots, those plex must be used by humans. I guess the "final" plex before the game shuts down at some point will not be consumed.
---
Another thing is that RMT is an indirect cost for CCP. We don't know how much isk is being sold this way, but we do know it happens. So even if CCP indirectly "makes money" off of bots, it may be the case they actually lose out because of RMT.
---
Happy new Year! o7

lol was that what was asked? plz take a read again lol..

I mean maybe if you actually wrote a comprehensible sentence I would understand.

dude really you need to take a break from gaming and reddit, when you get this offended by a post 
---
This is something I see in a lot of dev's. Great actual dev's, corporate, a good number of which arnt engineers or technical sorts, but in more then a should. It's an issue I've seen with ARK. the dev's are really god tier people and have great passion and understanding for what makes a good game. Who are then ham stringed by the people who define the minimum workable product to be way less then it should be.

I don't think Provi would be Provi if it became just another null sec coalition. There is something about how, where and what they do that makes them.

yeah, I played in wormhole space for 6+ years.

It was HK/LZ doing the evicting and so did blood union as well.

People from HK were talking about how they were planning another wh eviction and thought it was funny when they showed up to defend them.

That calculation doesn't even include how much I've spent on omega 💀

well i said  BEFORE supers were called i did not state after the keepstar fight if you read correct
---
Yes but RMT isn't only caused by bots. Hell CCP even commented on the issue some time ago where a lot of effort had to be made by them for account security because hacked account were a large part of the RMT happening. PLEX usage rate going down by lack of bots would also probably reduce the rate of purchase since the market would slowly get flooded unless legitimate player suddenly decide to sub more account.

Ah, sorry thought you were disagreeing. :)
---
paying 100 daily for month feels less than 1000 now. That's how microtransactions work, and often times business's have their liquid capital invested in something so they are unwilling to halt forward developement in order to invest in upgrading rather than moving forward.

Essentially it's the fault of modern investment ideal of constant growth which works only in short term, but when your scope is only the short term, it seems like a good deal.

Seeing as you don't even know that you don't get insurance from deaths to concord, I'm going to say you don't even know how much ganking costs, nor the time involved/prep/skill/monetary investment.
---
Sure it pays out when you hit the top level and are on skill extraction. But it's not like we tripped over 1 freighter and now have hundreds of bil.
---
If we are already in the "indirect"-territory, RMT by bots is as valid as anything else.
---
There is this idea that for the massive amount of botting to make sense, CCP has to be in on it in some way other than just not giving a fuck. That's not necessarily true.
---
That's a slow month!

the narrative

OMG... I remember that happening in 7RM when we were in Fade. Literally 200 people ready to bridge and the titan just goes POOF - gone. About 20 seconds later the FC literally goes "*Oh my god, I think he jumped...*" and it's full panic mode and laughter for the next 15 minutes.

What is your trading site? If you mean you've spent $1375 on eve, yeah I do that for sure. I think of it as a hobby though, people have guitars, RC cars/planes, w/e else.

Vet vs vet, the one with the money wins. The only way money loses is if you give it the disadvantage of noobness. That's not a true comparison to assess the power of p2w in eve.

Risk/reward.
---
If the risk is not worth the reward in your eyes, don't run the site, or choose a different ship.
---
Working on them? Lol have you seen most skins? They are a 30 second job to pick 2 random colours in most cases.
---
Not a lot of work being done there.
---
And the skins that require a few images slapping on them along with a random colour selection are so absurdly priced you would think every time you applied it they would summon the deceased remains of Picasso himself to paint your hull. So the price is a bigger deterrent to buy them than some flimsy principle about issues with other areas of the game 
---
Absolutely. I just didn’t realize the risk was so high for an L3, otherwise I would never have done it.
---
Yep! I did. Won’t happen again for something this risky unless it’s PvP.

Not a bad start.

There was such great feedback to my son's [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a129mn/i_encouraged_my_13yo_son_to_share_his_lego_eve/) with Lego ships and many of you pilots send him ISK in game to make your favorite ships too.  Here are three of them.
---
And he wants to thank again for how generous you all were with your feedback and ISK tips in the first round.  You made his month.
---
So, what happened? Did you get neutted out or did they break your reps, or what? How do we know you didn't derp out without an AA report?
---
We don't talk about who did it.... right Travis? ;)
---
Must have been distracted by a crow.

i call them hell spawns. they nasty. thats why i only fly a 300m gila up to t3.

Youre both fucking dumb

Calls someone else dumb. Doesn't say "you're" correctly. I believe that is called a self burn, sir.
---
he pretty good at MOC's
---
majority of my solo kills came in fleet situations where I used a bigger hull to quickly annihilate a smaller hull before a second player got a shot in a situation where a fleet was scattering.  second biggest source of solo kills has been haw dread (issue here is the second a fleet engages you very limited time span before cynos burn to the fight and either friendly or enemy supercaps jump in and the fight ends one way or the other.
---
You arent worth the time for proper grammar
---
There are a great many people that would elect to not look uneducated in public. There are others that apparently think it's hard work to grammar and that only special people get to see the labor of that hard thinkin'. I'm guessing you think grammar is hard thinkin'.
---
My dude, go back to pushing f1.
---
r/eve isnt for you to attempt to go full psychology 101 everytime you get called out for being such
---
What is that on the left? A mitten?
---
welcome to r/Eve. 
---
No real discussion, just toxicity 
---
Sure, you can resort to calling me an F1 monkey. Doesn't change that grammar being tough shit though, eh?
---
/u/man_whosoldthe_world Your thoughts?

This kid has some freaking serious talent. Good job boy, Bob bless.

5 minute cyno cycles

yikes.

Have fun bud

I always do.

cheffery is a bad choice all around, holidays, weekends, nights, unless you are single and have a drug/alcohol/both problem....
---
Oh wait, you also play eve, nevermind you are all set
---
Eve mogul
---
Genesis is a noob lowsec area. This won't fix it. Plus there's lore reasons why this is like this. Better idea...link Solitude with Fountain.
---
I've been wondering about that 
---
Hah, I got neuted out. Drones couldn’t track for some reason (I was out of range of any tracking disruption).
---
Nice looking womb
---
Makes sense. Are there no fittings that can handle that kind of spawn?
---
Disappointed... Clicked this expecting a request for a gate...
---
I love your anger its so good.
---
This concept isn't exclusive but yeah, there's a ton of low sec systems that should be merged for now at the very least.
---
If anything kills the game, my bet is on the community, not CCP.
---
That being said, I still find some great people. I’ve been very selective about recruiting for my corp, so we have plenty of good ones :D
---
Pbuh
---
lots of people have more than that up at one time
---
I'm impressed with the Nestor. Good job kid! 
---
While you were tunnel visioned on that keep a region and a half were burned to the ground. So yeah you hung onto your keep, but lost everything else the keep was supposed to protect.

Say hello to vile rate for me. Tell him, tell him we miss him. o7

your son got talent man

oh wtf i just realized it's a mino

Theres alot ot good people who play Eve. I have made a lot of friends. Hell attend a meet up or major event, they're full of them!
---
r/Eve is just the bottom of the barrel.
---
Describing almost every war in eve
---
Nice video, good to see people participating in content outside of the standard methods 
---
I havent played eve in around 6 or 7 or 12 years and am HYPERAWARE of how much cheffing sucks.
---
Abyss requires proper piloting which you cant buy. You can run L4s in a 600m gila
---
swear to god i thought that was FL studio when i saw it scroll past... 
---
I got alphad in a kestrel by a tempest back 11 years ago today as a noob by sitting still! Said thanks to the guy and he said: 
---
Yep! Happy new years!
---
Are you fucking retarded? lmao smh.
---
Welcome to the sandbox.  We will see if you can last.
---
&gt;That's only for a specific device in the tactical camera.
---
That’s what they were talking about. Cant remember exactly where I first saw it announced or mentioned, but I do remember not thinking it would need any special hardware when I went to try it out, only to find out what it really was.
---
friends and i reliably running l4 so idk. i wasnt there but hard for me to imagine being able to die to that wave unless u just boated into them all at once instead of kiting as much as you could. 
---
These regions are irrelevant to the overall state of lowsec, the only people that live in non-fw low is risk-averse hotdroppers preying on lost hi-sec newbs and the occasional super/cap dumbo that doesnt know what bait citadels and kick-out stations are.
---
There's a dude who always joins Thomas Lears fleets and will randomly "meow" when  bunch of dudes are talking so no one can figure out who it is.  It fucking cracks me up every single time it happens and thomas just sighs in frustration

Tried to use mogul but it's not showing. I expect it was 600b +

Seems like a high barrier to entry for content creation.  Would be nice if they'd put the advanced function back with our requirements for a $300.00 space mouse for cad work. 
---
*"Oh my god he just ran in"
---
Yep, I’m sure there’s something I could have done differently that would have made the difference. Oh well though.
---
Yep, I didn’t kite this one enough. I’m definitely leaning toward that as the reason it went down hill. Am I missing something on the drone tracking though? My drones were having trouble hitting them.
---
We laugh our tits off everytime our spies report that hostiles stand down and the FC gives the "enemies ragepinged a 500 man fleet with super support so we won't fight it" even though it was just one ping for some Ferox.

bad post

"oh well though".. stop moping, harden tf up, and get back out there bro

I have 1. We were trying to grind ADM's in Delve when we first took it over. Someone tried to gank my Procurer. It didn't go so well for them.
---
Burn Jita (chat)
---
I literally proved you wrong in one sentence. Seems you're too salty to admit it. Bye chump. 
---
Same. And noticed there was no kill mail.  First I’ve heard of a ban.  Tragic. 
---
which filament were u in?
---
which drones u using?
---
those shouldnt be hard to hit even in darks. im not sure if ewar applys to your drones other than webs so really unsure. may just be bad luck or a factor of drones being eward and slingshotting themselves
---
IGNORE THE TITLE, this video was from Jita not Amarr, that video got lost.
---
Well looks like it's time for another round, please ask him what he wants for me
---
Was expecting /u/stainguy

It is, just to a lesser degree.
---
exactly this
---
99% of the skins is a bad joke
---
Happy new year, everyone. 
---
That holds true if you are there as a local or are frequently in the space and especially the reset times.
---
But what happens when you are just flying through sometimes ? And not around reset times ? lets say you jsut come through a system once in a great while looking for fight or whatever and have no idea who the locals are or how they behave.
---
No you get a code that you redeem through a page on eveonline.com.
---
Were you running a dark?
---
Whats in game name I want a Manticore! Roflmao should get my kid to try shes got enough lego for sure!
---
It has to be arranged for you to see they lack numbers so you down ship or log off alts?
---
Whew lad no one is saying arrange fights we all know thats shit and leads to more drama in the long run. I've seen groups dock up/run cause we had alittle to  much at that point why wouldn't I make it more enticing in any form for them to fight. If they run from one doctrine doesn't mean they will run from another.
---
I have a 400 mil isk gila (including the pod)that can run gamma t3s almost all the time, and maybe all of them if you have decent piloting. I actually lost it to a similar spawn to what killed you, by the looks of it. 
---
Just go full passive fit, with two adaptive hardeners, 3 shield extender IIs, and then in the lows use DDAs. For high slots just rapid lights and a DLA/tractor beam depending on your drone range skills. For the rigs get the ones that increase passive regen, and the choice of drones should be obvious. 
---
Meat-be-Gone! The #1 meat-digesting enzyme aerosol!
---
Nah, I actually liked the ECM Widow, but now its pointless. It should definetly be replaced with something of some actual use. Tank, DPS, faster cloaking, more mobility, better lock times, whatever. Just something actually useful.
---
Point taken. 
---
Tt does but it takes the warp speed down to worse then a frieghters. So the idea is you run as many 1600 plates killing the aline time. Then a higgs rig killing the warp speed.
---
TBH more importantly is having actual "shipping lanes" that can be turned into content areas for piracy.
---
This is great! You should Xpost to r/MMOs, they're probably doing end of year wrapup compilations too 
---
I'll let him know - and it's Tyrannee
---
Is there any reason not to use a PoS for Manufacturing, researching, copying and invention in highsec?    
---
    
---
 I'm aware of the taxes but they're negligeable with low system Index.    
---
Is it true that in case of the PoS getting destroyed all my items are transfered to the nearest NPC station and I don't lose anything? 
---
Thats awesomeee!  Good luck! 
---
One father to another's lego is the shit. I hope mine enjoys space ships when shes older barely old enough to help me pilot lol
---
Thank you so much 👍👍👍👍 been googling all day lol 
---
unfortunately with ab they catch ya. ive lost similar to yours wit a web neut spawn. plus one of those tyrannos things 60km off so he hitting hard, ya cant move coz webs and by time u clear neuts ya pretty much no cap. once ya clear webs ya still gotta get 40km to the big bopper. i have a feeling these spawns are just a cost of doing business...
---
Hope he killed them at least. Even though that probably doesn't even pay for the T2 fibos lost. 
---
if u lost this in a t3 youre terrible at the game holy shit
---
All the social butterflys congregate around Amarr. Is there something I'm missing? 
---
Better than cocaine I guess 🤷
---
The fun part is, if you break it down per capita, goonswarm isn't mining or ratting more than anyone else.
---
Doubtful
---
dawg let me tell you i dont know shit about this retarded company i am running, and people don't really like that but it doesn't matter because im literally a psychopath lol :D so nothing matters except what i think and im never wrong about anything even though i know anything, basically i look at the work people do, and because i dont understand it, i throw it out! it's really super cool you should try it
---
There is a different sub for that
---
Go cry some more about ganking. Carebears a little mad
---
The Golem is my favorite! Fantastic work. 
---
nice!
---
Sorry to break your buble but there is more than one timezone in this world. 
---
That’s what “oh well though” mean. Stuff happens, moving forward.
---
Local is broken.
---
Dscan is broken.
---
Combat probing is broken. 
---
And many other weird things happening in the last few days that are progressively getting worse. 
---
The enemy web was on me, so drones weren’t affected. It was an L3 dark.
---
Yep!
---
Brilliant words. Thanks for being an excellent human being.
---
Gotcha, thanks! That’s good to know. I’ll have to try a cheaper fit like that. Do you use any special implants as well?
---
Dont run darks in a gila.  Bad news bears for your primary dps.  Stick to Gamma, Exotic, Electric

What a nice cringey Post to start of the blessed year 2k19
---
Ha!  If only I had the time or patience to actually do these.  He has dreams of being a Lego designer and the good dad in me wants to encourage every bit of it but the realistic side has me guiding him toward backup plans.
---
Buy a backup generator. Problem solved.
---
Or just move to civilisation.
---
I'd rather just have ships gain invulnerability but have the countdown continue counting down.
---
I had several power outages in my abyss career, but never ended in a kaboom, were you out of time?
---
This would be an alright solution. Stop the ship so it doesnt wander off into abyssal deadspace and make it invulnerable until the player logs back in while timer keeps going, at least gives power surges or random quick disconnects a much fairer shot.
---
You knew it was dangerous. You knew you are prone to service outages. You knew there was a time crunch. And you knew there is no reimbursement for losses.
---
It's your own fucking fault. Quit bitching. 
---
If this is an issue, maybe Abyssal stuff isn't going to work well for you until it gets fixed?  
---
It definitely sucks, but that's one of the troubles with a shitty internet/power connection whilst playing MMO's :( I used to have similar and it sucked.  
---
Good luck!
---
I had about 13 minutes left and I had finished the second room. Pulled drones in, set to approach the transfer conduit and disconnected. Logged back a minute later and I'm dead to abyssal depths, not even sure what happened. I'm not sure if something bugged, or if the ship just kept going straight and beyond the edge of the map in that time, I dont know anything because I just logged in straight to my pod at home station, and not knowing is also part of what makes it so annoying.
---
Eve isn't a game that lacks an impressive breadth of content.
---
pick something you won't whine like a bitch about, and do that.
---
So as far as i know you simply cannot do industry in them anymore. 
---
Starbases are being removed by CCP and replaced by citadels.
---
No idea for the asset safety in POS. In the case of citadels yes but you will pay 15% of the price to retrieve your assets in the station.
---
Or maybe its not the player's fault and the system is just badly designed from the get go. Everything else in eve has protection against being disconnected in such a way because CCP recognised it was a necessity or they wouldn't have done it. There are many ways to solve it if the devs actually cared, but I guess its easier to blame the player and tell him to move or not do content than bad design regarding crashes/dcs when it comes to abyss.
---
I think you're confusing POS's with Upwell structures.
---
POS's are being removed, and no, if they blow up, everything either dies or drops.
---
Upwell structures on the other hand, do have asset safety (Provided that you're not in a WH!). If the station goes boom, it can be moved to a station, usually with a small fee attached.
---
Just a few years 
---
Adding onto this, the ore that now comes out of moons refines into a combination of the reaction materials and normal asteroid minerals.
---
Michigan.
---
You’re full of shit Jon
---
It's definetely a buggy experience, i'd try to petition it, as this is not the way it's intended to work, if you reconnect fast enough you should stay "on grid", maybe this has something to do with transition mechanics
---
True, but dying to a disconnect in most other games is just a minor annoyance since you dont stand to lose as much as you do in EVE, so I dont care as much. I dont care TOO much for this loss either, but it sucks to lose the equivalent of a game sub ingame to something that is external to the game itself.
---
Friendship.
---
Yea, let him realise his dreams in his spare time and make sure he gets the best possible education.
---
When he is graduated he can then decide what it is he wants to pursue in life. 
---
I've always liked FXR and I won't say no to a propaganda video.. but a ferox fight (with weird overview settings) and dropping a lonely ratter are not particularly inspiring. At least to me...
---
This is very accurate.
---
You've got a really talented son. Glad you're encouraging his creativity. So cool! 
---
Also maybe consider a passive shield recharge gila? Mine is pretty decent.
---
Well done!
---
Harden the fuck up! Happy new year! 
---
&gt;Or maybe its not the player's fault and the system is just badly designed from the get go.
---
This. There should be no instances in eve. 
---
When lego wyvern looks better then normal wyvern. Gj
---
Those look really amazing!
---
so more payed for accounts make you win. got it.
---
hat goon. LOL!
---
&gt;Perhaps that is not at CCP's end?   
---
Ummm, that's not how EVE works rofl
---
I have it on my computer 
---
Into one... system?
---
Nobody denies that the game takes a long time to make and that the management has a big vision for the game. In contrast to other companies, they can look at the future to dare to make next gen games, without having to worry about running out of cash before finishing the game.
---
But saying it will never be a game and will fail is just plain wrong. No amount of downvoting is going to change that. You can just go ahead and keep fanboying EvE and bashing on all other space games, while we enjoy all games :D.
---
That was the info I searched for, thank you. You're right I thought this is the same. I searched around a little, I'm not sure I understand it right. I find the Eve uni Wiki sites about that confusing, what is the difference?    
---
 From my understanding so far: Raitaru, Azbel, Sotiyo are POS and Astrahus, Fortizar, Keepstar are Upwell Structures
---
Well i never saw exploration bot and i have been doing it for long time.
---
Hell i dont think it is even possible to make bot like that.
---
Well u complain that your connection and power supply isn’t stable and it’s caps fault ? Well you wouldn’t blame EA for losing a Game of Battlefield because you disconnect or have no power wouldn’t u? Maybe don’t play online games with your connection and don’t blame the companies ..
---
What happens to stuff you have listed on a market when an Upwell structure explodes? Does it drop or goto asset safety?
---
y yes as allways
---
New years resolution 240p
---
So split the dps?  Bring 5 widows, have each jam out one fighter, ancil tank single fighter volley.  The problem is people bring less widows when they should really be bringing more.
---
It's obviously a squirrel with a big bushy tail
---
So does that mean that the big value moons in NS are still big value, or do most moons outside of HS have similar yields?
---
I used three or four of random ones I thought would help. I know it was the cheap Zor implant, but I forget the others. The whole pod I remember being around 50 million. So, look at any drone/shield/speed implants that would be in that range. 
---
Also, I forgot to mention in my original post, but you’ll want the agency drug for speed as well. It’s not completely necessary, but it bumps up your ticks by a lot more than it costs and makes you slightly harder to kill. I don’t remember which class it was, but I know it cost about 3 mil. You could try more expensive ones and see if they help more, or a cheaper one and see if it works nearly as well. 
---
Sorry for being so vague here, but when I got the fit from someone he said he used it with no drugs or implants, so I was kind of just winging it when choosing them, and ended up slowly upgrading my pod a bit over time. 
---
thanks love brave pilots  and happy new year
---
How dare you call idiots stupid? Don't you know that's rude?
---
That took me back to AP Euro...
---
It's the abyss. The most difficult and unforgiving solo content in an unforgiving game. You knew what you were going into when you hit that filament and it's up to you to manage your risks. There of plenty of things you can do in this game where you won't lose 3bn to a random disconnect, but you chose the abyss. This is what you chose and today you got it.
---
Great job. Happy new year.
---
Couldn't have put it better myself!
---
Just make sure to have all skills to lvl5, that way you minimise the risk of penalties as much as possible.
---
using boosters with the skills maxed out is not to recommend.
---
most of the recent content they have released esp in the last 3 or 4 years have been Hugely marketed for short term profits ever since citadels update.
---
it seems with release of new citadels/ships it seems heavily geared towards players not required but pushed towards of buying a large amounts of plex. This has been signifigantly emphasised with the introduction of skill injectors.
---
instead of giving us a minmatar/caldari skilled pirate faction which a lot of people have already skilled in they opted to give us a *new faction* requiring large skill training or "injection".
---
tldr: they opted for quick investment for a quick short burst of profit instead of fixing and or improving the player experience.
---
Even PIRAT? That's a terrible situation.
---
I was thinking more coalition level
---
and thanks for your reply
---
B...bu...but I love the broken jita Chat... I just love it not being tempted to read about 200 different scams per minute. And Browser etc worked for me so far 
---
 Well, theres a dude who listed all relevant alliances and their coalitions.
---
Make svipul ~~great~~ ok again!
---
I never said we won ever single time. I said half the time the northern FCs said goons blueballed them, in reality goons had formed 1500 people and the north didn't want to hurt their precious killboard. 
---
How are we winning if we blueball you "every single time"? Or do you mean you blueballed us? 
---
Its fantastic. CCP killed jita Chat and they hopefully never bring it back. Its no Bug its a Feature to kill jita scam bots 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9rtnex/updated_coalition_list_october_2018/
---
It was a fire one right?  Those little suckers always got me in the fire ones 
---
only goons + pets (test, init) vs panfam fail-cascade now. with a side of salty-ass gotg / wh / lowsec that doesn't matter.
---
can panfam lose more players before crashing out? will goons remember how to fit non-mining mods? will lowsec matter? stay tuned!
---
Why is your System information Redacted? You're in T5ZI-S, Delve. Don't be a baby. You have so much redacted on your screen that it's just unbearable.   
---
What would have been much more interesting to include would be the fact that this is the second titan that you've encountered in a 12hr period! 
---
Not like you did much of that anyways.
---
The key to not needing any tank in your super is looking like really bad bait
---
thanks for the help, this is exact what I was looking for
---
cheers
---
I mean, isn’t that what Rancer is? And it’s not uncommon to have smartbombers in the lowsec system between Geminate and Jita. 
---
But every system can’t be a border system/pipe, right? 
---
You blew your load early by max forming for everything against a few SIGs and squads. Then you were tired when we made it a real war by deploying everything up there. 
---
If the northern leaders had some sense of reason they wouldn't have formed max numbers for everything against a few SIGs and squads, it tired people out quick when they were told to alarm-clock to save some random fortizar or whatever against a single SIG. 
---
/ Thread
---
Not intuitive that these features are separated / shown like this, but they have it already!
---
so this is where you throw a wrench in that formula so in a 1 v 1 most of the time if you outclass the ship your fighting by either p2w or just regular old grinding you would win if youre not a complete numpty.
---
outclassed doesnt mean outgunned which means the "weaker" ship could bring a lot more friends and get a decent kill. 
---
but heres the wrench thrower, this may be only 1% of eve playerbase but you have players that are very skilled and are able to take on 10 man fleets on their own. Very few players are capable of pulling something like this off. a very famous pvper comes to mind is iBeast. 
---
so yes the game can be very paid to win but not guaranteed win. 
---
&gt; Do not join one of those corps that say they do everything because they are lying to you. Sure the mega corps probably have everything going
---
confirmed -- there are only 4 real newbie mega corps to look at; karmafleet (bees), brave/test (dinos), horde (virus), and eve uni (nerds). the good: lots of resources, in and out of game. the bad: youre just pilot #1128. don't sweat too much which one, they all pretty similar when starting and moving from one to another isn't that big a deal. 
---
Tbqh I'd like those artists revamp some old parts of space visually. Made the mistake of going into a drone ded a while ago and the last room turned into a slideshow whenever I looked at the clouds there.
---
While I admire Goons organisation and ability to overcome hurdles,  I'll happily watch everything mitts's built online stomped into the ground. Nothing against you or goons as a whole, but that man deserves to experience what he's been doing to others for over a decade now. 
---
Nice job !
---
Wow trin, wow.
---
Dont leak my ign. I like namelessly shitposting
---
I think he came
---
I think he jizzed in his pants
---
You're right but the quality of the site stays, so like you could get 90 intact armor plates from one site pre and post downtime
---
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK.
---
But noone cares about what you like or not.
---
There are also more pilots that include trin. 
---
Wow, such a meaniehead
---
kids never have enough lego
---
I agree, What is quite possibly the best PVE they have come up with in years, something that can be done in bite sized chunks, and thoroughly enjoyable, is shut of behind a requirement of living somewhere where you can guarantee a perfect 24/7 internet connection. 
---
Of course We have a choice, and the choice forced on us is to not engage with the content.
---
That's a pretty crappy choice to be forced to make.
---
No.
---
That was also my dream as a kid, ended up studying engineering, dropping out, and became a design draftsman (CAD etc) last year. So, pretty much consistent!
---
or CODE.
---
Take my upvote master
---
Bad design is bad design, It's not necessary for the customers to defend it.
---
That Nestor 😍
---
Like NASA or SpaceX hopefully!
---
*whom
---
Darks are not a good choice for a drone boat. The drones will hardly apply any damage, and you will either get neuted out, blown up, or timed out. 
---
There's not a lot of other results likely on a regular basis with a Gila in a dark.
---
Know how they found that for you?  The search function!
---
&gt;Except PIRAT. Nobody likes PIRAT.
---
Good start to the new year, You really encourage other players to strive to do their best and give excellent advice that will make them a better player in the future.... no wait!
---
Maybe you should reevaluate your New Years Resolution? Usually they revolve around becoming a BETTER Human being......
---
Pos is a control tower, all others are upwell structures. 
---
I hate Samuel's cyno alt
---
.. cause all HK is PL alts.
---
PS, Thank god i was talking about the UK and not america. Atleast its good to have English Law
---
Bombers bar declare they are an NPSI, anybody is allowed to join from any alliance or group and fly with them however they reject all goons/test and then proceed to only hunt in Delve/esoteria
---
Moral of the story dont play with Bombers bar INB.AWOX ARMY 
---
Praise James!
---
Posting useless ideas every day is not the best new year resolution, I'd suggest to change it to somethibg else.
---
I'd agree with the "no instances" idea, if the instanced content we get wasn't perhaps the only engaging PvE activity, that can also be run in a group without diminishing returns. If we get a proper PvE rework sometime, sure, delete the abyss.
---
Advising Pandemic Horde as a new friendly Corp is like telling this guy to go quit the game in 1 weeks time they care 0 bit about member retention and it's only aspect as an alliance is the chern members as fast as possible.  
---
SHAME ON YOU 
---
Bad design has nothing to do with your connection though, especially when you know your connection is bad and you still engage in a completely optional part of the game.
---
Great job, great ships :)
---
htfu
---
While I kind of sympathize with your loss OP, I can't say I agree with you. A corpmate who recently joined our group had the skills for a carrier and was ready to hop into one, but held off for a couple weeks. Why? Because his connection was trash and he knew bad things could happen. Instead of going forward and then blaming CCP for his loss, he acted intelligently and waited until his new connection was ready. Besides, what's the difference between your case and getting disconnected in a fleet fight with bubbles all over the place?
---
tried to change the topic but it was not possible, but thanks for pointing out the error
---
I suppose I wasn't as clear as I meant. Lets try that again!
---
Even PIRAT doesn't like PIRAT? &lt;sarcastically&gt; Because that's *terrible*.
---
Yes.
---
Your 3b ship was underprepared. Always have a nos in your utility high for those tough waves so you can at least run an/resists. If it's leshaks put drones on them asap, if it's cruisers burn away to give yourself a few extra seconds to kill a few. Also passive gila I find way more reliable unless you go for the PvP room.
---
last I checked the reason is because goons are fucking up their fleets using alts and waiting sb´s titans.
---
Can't stress this enough, darks are suicide unless you're doing them in frigates.
---
im in bombers bar discord.
---
i havent been kicked.

nor am i going to be kicked.

damn artists not banning bots and fixing chat
---
its very fucking standard by now. just go to zkill and check for rattlesnake deaths inside C5 wormholes.
---
Not sure it's a good thing to watch dead fits. I mean, there's a reason they are dead. 
---
Dead by rats = bad fit
---
dead by players = bad luck
---
Who reads Jita local anyways?
---
Not really sure what it has to do with bad luck, but okay. 
---
You make a good point
---
someone rage rolls into you and snags you. if youve been heavy krabbing and half paying attention, you miss a few dscans and suddenly sabres. that's bad luck.
---
some cheeky explorer comes in through your VOC because you're a bad and dont know that you should lock yourself in, and notices that you're on your second to last or last wave in this garrison and the drifter structure is decloaked. he uncloaks, aggresses it, and warps off, leaving your snakes to the drifter + site. that's bad luck.
---
Extremely accurate, scaled as CCP intended them.
---
Yeap good catch, I was wondering why it was so garbage resolution. Guess I never turned it back on after the last Tidi-fest.
---
They are great. Would it be terribly rude to ask how generous the community has been? :)
---
"Just put it back after"
---
"Its dead."
---
Ahh i miss he old days in Horde with Travis spam pinging 7 times  for a fleet 
---
Pos can't do industry anymore, they're basically just parking spots for supercaps at this point. Up well structures with proper rigs are quite a but better than normal stations and have asset safety, except for industry jobs. If a citadel goes boom and you having industry jobs there that you have not delivered, then all the materials and blueprints drop in the wreck. Asset safety only works for assets in your personal or corp hangars.

They are high value because they are rare and needed for production, you just need to actively mine them now.
---
I was in the first room once and the enemy was half poked out into the danger zone and not moving. It was unable to take damage and I was unable to progress. I reported this to them expecting to be reimbursed and they told me that what I claimed was impossible. I had been playing as an Omega for a long time. Haven't logged in again since my subscription ran out. I tried to log in the other day but all I get is a token error so obviously they are keeping up the quality control.
---
I know. I think the last time he pinged, he only did it 2 or 3 times. I thought it was it was an imposter. 
---
Man I run a cheaper version of this exact fit and run exclusively darks because of the speed bonus.  Never come close to danger.  Might be an SP issue?   Keep flying man it’s only isk lol.  Better luck next time!
---
You are a faceless nobody regardless of what alliance you're in. If you want to be somebody, then go do something remarkable. FC fleets, become and amazing hunter, start your own corp with a grand vision and strive to see it come true, go the AT and make the semifinals or something. Don't just sit there and pretend you're somebody, that just doesn't work.
---
Remove smartbombs and boom lowsec fixed and those lazy smartbomber noobs leave to go play fornight
---
Space empires have always been cyclical, they rise and fall over the years. We were all pretty convinced ALOT of powerhouses would always be around but being ran by people those things can be fickle.
---
If and when that happens to Goons, we will very likely become a 5k man alliance again once the “easy” 24/7 krab life doesn’t exist anymore.
---
But that’s cool too, even if it would be a hard pill to swallow.
---
Huh, makes the whole botting thing a little easier to understand now if that's the case :P. Must have really shot up the T2 prices after this change then.
---
No need to get all jumpy mate. 2019 just started, have a drink :) I said I havent seen or heard it ingame, im not saying it aint true
---
As to Jita being the likely center: I almost never go there so theres that! I prefer Amarr anyway :)
---
1) you probably had rotten luck, I usually see about 10-20% maximum drone sites.
---
2) HAMgu can reach all the way out to 40km with perfect skills and rage missiles, or 30km with decent skills, and does very high DPS with decent application. I personally do 850 at 55km with rage missiles, so you need to work on your skills and fit.
---
3) Can't remember the numbers for my travel fit but it's similar to yours. The important thing is people can't lock you the moment you hit the cloak button. So the situation is way more in your favor than you think. That ceptor pilot would have under 5s to get within 2k of you to decloak you, target you and point you to tackle you. Which is very, very hard to do. With nullification bubbles don't matter, so you're almost uncatchable, unless you accidentally cancel cloak or otherwise fail.
---
That’s like saying , you know your tired are broken , but you decide to do races and then blame the car manufactures for destroying the car
---
Nice

Asset safety, except in wormholes 
---
It certainly sucks you in though, I even went back to school and got a degree in computer science, yet I am still cheffing it up a hundred hours a week some weeks!
---
Blueprints are asset saftied, but you’re right about the rest
---
 AAR?
---
But who would willing fight a dragoon in a 1v1? And it’s not like destroyers are going to be able to keep up with the kitey bs that is the meta right now 
---
msarm aren't very good at eve online, news at 10
---
Imperium are blue with legacy, and i think that about covers the majority of eve atm unless you want to go into the fine details of smaller groups. 
---
Pirat is blue with test atm so you're wrong
---
Those are amazing!
---
ah okay, didnt know that. probably for convenience of highsec shenanigans?
---
I was once in a bombing fleet we were burning back after getting bridged by blops...suddenly they camped the other gate The FC shouted to not jump
---
but one of us said:(DID HE SAY JUMP?)
---
some of us got him trolled And said yes...he lost his arazu
---
Seems like they were bored
---
Seams like they still won the isk war tho
---
Suppose you were a solo roamer. Would you rather go 20+ jumps and either have a bunch of VNIs already tethered by the time you jump into system or 20+ empty system, or would you rather go to very packed systems where people ignore neuts in local and continue ratting/mining?
---
there it is
---
Literally this was the case before we even started AWOXING him, PS i wont stop awoxing his fleets until the guy quits eve online 
---
Lmao at this mindset.
---
Or fly a tackle ship, and get point on blingy stuff, and become everyone in standing fleet’s best friend. 
---
Or fly fast dps, because all the tackle in the world is useless if you can’t kill something. 
---
Or fly a instalock nado, and set up impromptu gatecamps on oijanen and delete 2 bil tengus in half a second. (That happened two days ago, although really it was a 700 mil tengu and a ~1.3 bil pod)
---
If you make any sort of attempt to stand out it’s not hard to do so, we usually only have a couple dozen active pvp pilots in standing, at least as long as the fight isn’t in o-v, so you’re not just a random line member except in big fleet fights. 
---
And of course, unlike everyone else, we don’t actually require you to go on those. We’d certainly like it if you did, but we won’t kick you if you don’t find those fun. 
---
Bad Goons.
---
Have you ever considered that some people wanted to use their Titans and wanted to be able to acquire Titans, then definitely were not able to forgive PL for ruining provi?
---
Are you at all aware of the history between Dreddit/TEST  and Goons or do you prefer that your opinions be totally unbiased by fact? We have been friends since their earliest days. Our two cultures have always fit well together. When Dreddit was new, we saw a lot of ourselves in them. Also like us, they've always seemed quite organized, despite their chaotic culture. The only times we haven't been close were when their leadership decided to go their own way. With different leadership over there, it's very possible that you'd have never seen daylight between us. You're busy whining about how we're not deadly enemies, but you should be thanking your lucky stars that we aren't still 100% united. 
---
Just to be clear, you are aware that real Goons try to kill games? That the neo-Goons of EVE support, either by not working against or actively helping, a bunch that meta the hell out of EVE and try to ruin it for the players?
---
They are where the lowest common denominator gathers. Why the difference between Goons and neo-Goons? Mittens realised that he needs EVE to keep real $$$ flowing into his back pocket, hence the change in goal.
---
There are no high ideals or greater goals, just a pack of vermin aimed at tearing others down.
---
I guess so. 
---
Succubus vs Ares, each side brings friends, escalates to cruisers, they light a cyno and jump 10 subcaps from various sizes, we bring a single carrier, they bring 2 dreads, we bring several carriers, up to titans
---
Strange ... I am looking at the coalition map ... and there are more than two colours on it ...
---
You can by the mouse second hand cheaper on eBay you know.  I'm sure how ever mouse and keyboard could of been used to create the same effect.
---
Sweet, thanks. I can't use t2 large hybrids, so would you recommend upgrading something else in that case? And won't the mwd hurt cap life badly? I prefer mjd personally as you have some defense against bubbles but I'm curious to know why you prefer mwd

Awesome list of activities available exclusively to horde players. It's younger, dumber fresh faced kids with edge. If you can't find a home elsewhere, if you're an outcast, sperg, dumpstered on by other players, other communities - you can join Pandemic Horde and feel at home and in good company.
---
High sec Incursions.  Do what a lot of people do. Have an alt in high sec trained for incursions. Make isk, transfer isk to null sec, become the predator.
---
He probably flew it
---
If you are interested in flying any hull, especially solo, I would definitely train for the t2 guns. That said I think you could use T1 until you did. MJD is a fantastic tool, forcing people to come sit in brawling range if they want to hold you, that said the MWD gives a lot of mobility, to burn to targets, slingshot people, burn back to gate. In a perfect world you would have both, but of course their are only so many mid slots.
---
In general I have done more MWD on turret ships and MJD on missile ships, although perhaps that's just a personal preference thing.
---
Amazing how people like you say that NC/PL is too “elite” and are all neckbeards because of their selective recruitment/tryhardness, but in the same breath say Horde is too casual and just accepts everyone like it’s a bad thing 
---
For more of the HTFU and to have alliances controlling Low Sec, I always thought forcing people to travel through Low Sec to any other major HS area would be interesting.
---
There could be NPCs that assist you based on your standing. Want to be a super carebear? Grind up enough standing with a NPC group so they protect you when crossing the Low Sec highways.
---
you can use boosters that don't have negatives for your ship, like mindflood in logi ships without any skills to level 5.  I think this is too conservative to start using drugs.  
---
coalition sov map not accurate since the coalition list it uses is out of date
---
Go join one, marshy has no problem with goons, goons have a problem with marshy
---
&gt;people like you say that NC/PL is too “elite
---
Are you memeing me right now?
---
Yes!
---
Msarm has about 40% eff here, rusrus won the fight and the isk war
---
Daras and that was nullsec people.
---
Who cares about efficiency. GF all around, great way to start the year
---
Who are these Ferrata Victrix guys?
---
I was responding to "your Linux build is the best ever" to further support your claim that it's not really an alternative.
---
I like this.
---
Helping the "enemy" have more fun.
---
+ relog in. Leaving jita isn't always enough
---
you claim CCP "rewards" people for having a good power  connection? get a fucking job and solid ISP like the rest of us dipshit. 
---
Its resentful, entitled and utterly stupid morons like yourself who will be destined to wallow in their own shit and piss until they drown. 
---
&gt; So you are happy that your alliance mates are losing money 
---
Sounds like a normal Goon to me?
---
&gt; then you should be kicked from Goons for your comments cherishing the situation lol.
---
I still remember how strange it was when Goons started putting out mining fleets instead of swarming and destroying them all the time.
---
A corp does their own thing for fun, let them feed. Just follow corp gatecamps for content and you won’t be disappointed because they are likely unsupported by the alliance as a whole.
---
Oh :(
---
50 off where?   
---
Also can I use this on existing accounts?
---
Cool ^^ not Rupee's level but hey ;) Sad she was banned tho 
---
If you think losing your space doesn't kill your momentum as an organisation losing it's WH does, I'd recommend you take a look at how many people have been able to cockroach it out after an invasion - It's basically just -A- and CVA, with Goons and sort of TEST (TEST kinda had to die and be reborn).
---
wtf is that bhaal fit
---
Lol @ you being awful
---
Think that's one of my Praxis lol
---
It's a beautiful ship isn't it? I was just a touch pumped when I realized I got to make a thumbnail out of it for the video.
---
Well that escalated dramatically. +1
---
They lived in Esoteria before TEST moved in. Now they live in stain and due to proximity there's always fights. It's more of a nuisance than a real threat
---
O... kay ... why aren't you in Goons?
---
I brought up the AT10 video the other day. I remember how surprised we all were to be 8 points under. We thought we were at 100. We suck at counting, just like we suck at finesse. 
---
Still so proud that comp worked!
---
There are exploration bots 100%
---
But pl on the other hand is the real boogeyman
---
This is why I stick mostly to T4s instead of T5s. Only do T5s sometimes when I feel brave or I'm testing a fit adjustment or something like that. If I can't reliably complete abys site in 12-14 minutes, I don't do it. It takes me about 3-4 minutes to fully reboot my computer and reset my router. Then another minute or so to get back into the game and another minute to fly to the gate as it always seems to land me quite a bit away from it when I get back in. And in T5s, if I get 2-3 rooms with battleships in them that take a while to chew through the hitpoints, then get disconnected, I do not have enough time to make it out of the site. T4s no problem, always need to have that extra time. I haven't lost a ship due to disconnect for long time now.
---
your br doesn't work.
---
Awesome, thanks. That’s really great to know.
---
Do you play on a calculator 
---
Not so much 'out of date' as 'was never right to begin with'.
---
neat! banderlogs are the russian version of Brave Newbies, a newbro focused teaching alliance. That said, they have a lot of numbers and will throw shit at you until you die. You don't have to worry about haw dreads or supers being dropped on you though, so there's that.
---
3/10 no cap booster truck alt.
---
Love fighting banderlogs. Always give a good fight
---
Also no command destroyer to bounce on and off grid and provide links. It's not that I don't want them, I am am just a scrub and multiboxing is hard :)
---
I feel like anyone that does not drop supers on any and all roaming content in modern EVE gets a gold star. I will have to roam out their way more and see if we can't get some good fights.
---
Why is test still doing stuff in stain?
---
That place has been nothing but embarassment for them.
---
Really nice story and it really captures the feeling in a gank fleet. But no ”FREE COMS”?
---
Banned for RMT
---
2018 is over, 2019 is my best friend now 
---
This question assumes there were actually any good posts in 2018.
---
Just throw in the clone bay module. Can’t jump while it’s active iirc. 
---
Now imagine if Stain had a lowsec gate they could use instead!
---
They do love ECM though so just be aware of that. It's very possible that any gatecamp you run in to will have 2-3 cloaked armor blackbirds about 65km off and that one derpy dude like 20 off.
---
100% agree. This feels like generic hipster pop music for a teen flick, not a spaceships game.
---
Good heads up, thank you :)
---
Where do they live? 
---
welcome back Lasker, its been a year :D 
---
Their staging is [NPC Pure Blind](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/5ZXX-K) but they have a krab pocket [here](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind/K-QUVW)
---
You are an idiot. But the game needs idiots like you. 
---
Awesome, thanks. Yeah, lots of people are saying passive is a good way to go. I’m going to try that next.
---
Could be SP, though someone pointed out some potential piloting errors that I may have made, and I’m leaning toward those.
---
Like you said though, it’s only ISK. I’m going to make a little more then give it another go in a cheaper fitting.
---
This. Having lived on a Caribbean island I can tell you they are life savers. 
---
chevis was the only good mod

Best post are sooo 2k18

im blue with ur mom

I think ur just lazy and like it. Old chool like i doo. Balls deep

Beautiful. 
---
Thanks. I'm wary about the ecm but I want to take my tempest there
---
And be known as a quitter? I think not.
---
Good idea, thank you
---
Well the lazy part for sure is true...
---
Just you know, there are a few requirements prior to joining. We don't just instant invite like PH does.
---
Sure, recruiting is much more lax. But that's because we are a new player friendly alliance.
---
What's so difficult to understand about that? 
---
Hasn't been this way for a while. 
---
Volt left before pl invasion 
---
Brave has training fleets all the time. Anything from industry, PI, to learning how to use the right boosters. 
---
£30 gets you an ups, replacing your loss with cash is more, dont forget to plug the router in as well
---
I think CCP is on vacation year around these days.
---
Why are you so salty against Brave? They bring new players to null space. They give you something to shoot at. They even join other Null groups once they are ready.
---
What's so bad about that? 
---
Wow, you're a cunt.
---
Word.  I’ve had some pretty obscene pve losses over the years.  It happens lol. 
---
Hawks, HK, sound, darkness consumed and IIRC correctly one other group was rolling.
---
Each of the 5 main groups had 20+ ships online and ready to go the moment someone found it.
---
Sound was the group to make a connection to you, they pinged and everyone rolled out from there. A wormhole was found in the c5 static which gave a null connection.
---
Both hawks and darkness ended up having chains that put them under 5 jumps from this connection and gave us multiple easy ways in.
---
But you believe whatever narrative you like. 
---
Very cool stuff, thank you for sharing.
---
Contact ccp!

[Your BR is broke](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1045&amp;b=8415600&amp;e=90&amp;t=rb)
---
So Horde was flying something like 100 dudes in circles around Curse, and FRT had formed Bombers for some shit, I guess either to fight them, or more likely to third party us.  FRT kinda hate us. It's cool. I understand.
---
So two pings later we have 40-45 dudes in a decent (for once) Feroxes comp with four carriers for support.  Personal, I thought we were gonna eat shit because Border has some dreads and an Apostle, and I didn't thought the dreads would hit the Feroxes pretty hard, and didn't think we could break Apostle reps, but whatever. I'm bored.
---
So we kinda chase them around Curse for a little bit until we eventually crash into them.
---
Somehow, Horde manages to find the tiniest little sliver of space where they are 1), out of range of their Apostle, 2), too far to apply to us and 3), right around Thorium optimal from us, and decides that's where they are going to fight.
---
It's a fucking turkey shoot.  I actually felt bad at one point.
---
It's whatever. FRT bombs a few Feroxes.  Who cares.
---
It sucks to see all the salt in stream, but I understand.  They really could have done a lot better if they had just sat on the Fax and made us come to them, but expecting us to come welp kitchen sink shit outnumbered around 2-1 isn't really realistic.
---
CCP hire this child.  I bet even you can afford his wages.
---
You should get help. 
---
Is that not what you wanted?
---
No, that's not what I wanted at all.
---
(FC what do?)
---
No, It is like choosing not to drive a Car with a Braking fault, 
---
You know the one when a child walks in front of the car, where it steers you into the nearest lamppost, and a metal spike shoots out of the centre of the steering wheel in place of the airbag.
---
Funny, that model didn’t sell too well......
---
Active gila fits are pretty vulnerable to neuts (whether PVE or PVP) and you need to maintain range to avoid being neuted out by neuting enemies. I'm not convinced about the AB meta for abyssals, it makes it impossible to kite away from spawns.
---
And yeah dark filaments are bad for drones because they end up outtracking themselves (moving so fast their targets always have high traversal for them).
---
Give me a good reason why goons or test wouldn't mess with their fleets when they hunt in their space.  Being an npsi fleet it is impossible to keep us out. They are only kicking the obvious ones. 
---
If CCP would just fix the spawn rate and adjust rats to aggro fighters instead of the current broke AFK shit it is now these sites would be great. Brought it up to the CSM on the fighter cheesing multiple times. Why is this the only PVE thing in eve where rats don't aggro fighters. Or could you send fighters in from outside of 2500km and no rats even spawn...cmon ccp
---
thank god 2018 was a fast one tho, here is to a good 19! 
---
No, I am NOT blaming my connection, I actually have made the choice NOT to run these because of this, and it is actually currently the only part of the last years developments I would like to do. I find that a pity.
---
It is no worse than most places in the civilised world, I AM blaming a Design when the player gets punished, severely, when the inevitable connection/power cut, client crash, memory leak, DDOS attack, or hamster seizure, occurs.
---
This is either marketing, running out of control, or lazy programming. They really don’t need their inadequacies whitewashed, and excuses made for them, they are a business, and we are customers, there is an inevitable relationship or future lack thereof.
---
I know it wasn't super flashy or blingy, but I really enjoyed the vid.  Thanks for sharing
---
bah humbug
---
I actually waffled on posting it for some time because it was not flashy or blingy. I am very glad you enjoyed, thank you for taking the time to comment.
---
Just one thing, have you considered voiceover narration over text narration? I feel like the next narration distracts from the action going on screen. You can keep the music on but low volume so it doesnt mess up the pacing while you are narrating.
---
inb4 highsec sov. concord still in operation but claimable by player entities.
---
Wow. This will likely be a double edged sword for the guy himself, if true. CCP will likely need the expertise from a master cheater if they wish to defeat cheating as a whole in game. While at the same time, may give the guy some problems because of the scale to which he operates. This doesn't surprise me one bit. I think he is terribly stupid for going to such length to cheat in a video game, I mean, what a douche bag. Yet at the same time, you have to admire the intelligence and have respect for the man too, because lets fucking face it, none of you out there thought of it. 
---
What an interesting read. This is definitely content in its totality. :) 
---
Well hat off to you for the effort and creativity. 
---
I have thought about it, and even go so far as to go out and buy a better mic. Thus far all the recordings I have put together have sounded terrible, so none have been posted. I plan to keep working on it and hopefully some day I get up a video with commentary rather than music.
---
it is not about RNG but how uneven New Eden is, due to this if you live in north-east part of New Eden you will get almost constant spawns, while south-west part of New Eden will have minimal chance for a spawn.          
---
By moving rng from system to a rng to a faction you can remove this issue.         
---
Similar story as me .. I returned to EVE after watching the Expanse :)
---
So many informative posts here.
---
So we should distribute all resources evenly in every area of space? R64 moons for everyone!!
---
I hope he considers a career in engineering.
---
When you start to get comfortable, try frogi (frigate logi).  Same rush, twice the speed.  It's intense.  Basically you'll know within 30s - 1min whether you're going to hold your fleet up or not.  
---
Okay $50 is a bit much.
---
What will it take to get your $25?
---
I guess CCP desire was for all players to have equal chance in having access to those Sotiyos - simply RNG item was badly chosen.     
---
It is not a resource, but a PVE content having PVP related reward. 
---
If you don't like the spawn rates in the space you live, move space.  Maybe if enough folks thought like you, there would more wars over space which would only be good for the game.  If spawn rates were even why would anyone invade someone else's space other than grudges.
---
I woul love to see it tho
---
I took a dump today - there you go updated.
---
Like i stated in other post.         
---
CCP idea was to have all players having equal chance to get the chance to run the Sotyio (earlier it was faction area locked) but simply it don't work due to reasons stated in main post. 
---
There is only ONE isp where I live, I dont really have other choices when it comes to that, and I know I'm not the only one on that boat. I shouldnt have to move to be able to enjoy some of the content in a game when something like making the ship stop and be invulnerable but keep the timer going while I relog would fix 99% of the problem.
---
I am very heavily against the homogenisation of EVE.  I am 100% fine with some regions being better than others for some things.  This is why conflicts (should) occur.  
---
"Ohh their space has &lt;x&gt;, we should go take it."
---
Local works fine today, Its the market that isnt working now.
---
Yeah, I am considering switching to nanos.
---
The only updates we get are new skins.
---
Its not really the same because outside of abyss if I get a random disconnect, most of the time the ship logs out with me thanks to disconnection protection eve employs. I've disconnected in the middle of big fights and find myself warping in several AUs from the battle because EVE realises there was a crash thanks to either an unstable client (and let's not say EVE is particularly stable) or some error on the player's side. I carrier rat regularly and have dc'd while ratting and sure, I lose a couple of fighters, but every time I log back in, the carrier is loging back in with me since EVE detects the disconnect, so he shouldnt have worried that much about it.
---
You're overthinking it mate. Just don't have terrible gain settings like Jin'taan's last video and you're fine.
---
standardize nullsec geography first

so?

Elo went AFK

They want people to spread out and use player owned hubs.   Why do you think its been gradually getting worse for the past year.   You are the frog.
---
Will do thanks pal
---
Thats all true, but I wasn't talking about coming to kill my fortizar. I know that was a group effort.
---
I'm laughing at the general comment of "I don't recall HK really blobbing" which taken at face value is a HILARIOUSLY incorrect statement. 
---
My uneducated opinion:
---
I know a lot of people in Black Legion are just alts of people from big nullsec blocs that are looking for content (not necessarily spys but people who would gladly shoot whoever, including their main alliance for content).  Because of that not a lot of people step up to do anything and I can imagine Elo gets burnt out.  He's already quit a few times so it won't take much for it to happen again.
---
I tried it out for a minute with my main but I got tired of only flying Muninns.  As someone who can fly every subcap in this game you miss out on the beauty of all this game has to offer.   Only flying Muninns also allows your enemy to easily out-escalate you when things get serious. 
---
I hope they stay active.  They are good for content in this game.
---
The abyssal meta/fittings go way deeper than I knew before making this post. 
---
Once my account gets copied back over to Singularity (or once I get the ISK) I’m going to run some test fittings with ships I don’t normally fly.
---
It's the government shutdown. 
---
Wow. Can't leave it alone can you? Just shows how childish you are. Please pal... talk to me when you understand this game. I'm guessing that'll be never. Haha. 
---
i see where you guys are coming from. This year i wanted more upbeat music with an interesting lyric. my 2017 compilation was all doom and gloom so i wanted to bring a happier vibe to it. 
---
perhaps if i share with you me alternative song that was considered for being on the video you might look more favorably upon the one i did choose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOEOsEgp6BI
---
Don't ask.......
---
They have been more of the "active" groups jumping around different locations of nullsec for content which is good for the game. unfortunately Black legions is full of people who will give ELO a good rimming the moment he asks and overall it isn't hard for any alliance with a strong backbone or coordination team to make ELO go afk again like we seen when he came to delve 
---
Who knew having only 1 competant fc that is known to quit regulary is bad for an alliance.
---
I only hope no one actually invested substantial resources into bl, all the smart people just joined for easy pvp with elo without comitting themselves.
---
Just a message of goodwill for and about our community.  In game we could be the worst of enemies - bout IRL I've seen us pull together for us and ours that I've hardly if ever seen in other gaming communities. 
---
I thought it was an appropriate time to recognise that and call some attn to it in a wholesome way.

“Uhh, you guys wanna drop on a Marshal?”
---
I had posted up in NPC Delve when we got word their dread bomb hunters had logged on there. One of my characters was out in a dead-end system cloaked off the NPC station when I saw one of those ISRAD nerds decloak and drop an anchored bubble in a Marshal so he could catch some Gila running missions. 
---
He started burning back to it, maybe to pick it up, so I piped up in comms confirming that I would have DPS able to jump. I got the OK, decloaked, warped to the bubble generator and hit my cyno. 
---
Unfortunately I got stymied by some game mechanic and it took about 15 seconds for the cyno to actually light, something about my ship realigning its magnetic field. By then the Marshal had cloaked again. 
---
I ordered the carriers to send fighters toward the station for a decloak, but our target managed to dock safely. All in all not a terrible first drop, but I was pretty bummed I couldn’t get the kill. 
---
Payout time.

Man that's really sad if it's true :(

depending on rat and difficulty of the sites,

I know a lot about guristas so here is my input on them
---
Maze - &gt; Proteus ( will face-tank and smart-bomb fit) &gt; Tengu ( carry drugs if you get surprised on the last wave ) &gt; Loki &gt; (NO) Legion
---
9/10 ( unrated ) -&gt; Proteus -&gt; Tengu &gt; NO ( you need a carrier || binge or sinper (300KM+) Rattle || marauder for the last room) a long range pancake can do it too. they fire anti cap weapons and web. so a dread will struggle close range. but i have not tried it.
---
8/10 or 7/10 -&gt; Tengu -&gt; Loki -&gt; Proteus ( manage drones carefully + a web on the mid with best cap skills ) &gt; Legion ( but serisly why though )
---
unrated 6/10 - 8/10 -&gt; Same as above ( sheild fit ships need to be carefull on one of the sites which does  a 80KM EM smartbomb (once ) will put you in armor if not hull if you dont have a dcu. stay away from dps sentries on some sites. maintain high transversal. they do omin damge and hits you for wrecking shots. some of the sites have ninja trigers. so fast runs are crazy profitable. and one of the site never escalates. 
---
6/10 -&gt; Proteus. &gt; MWD Tengu. &gt; Loki &gt; Legion 
---
cloaky nulifled travel fit. and you gonna need cargo expanders to carry ammo or a dedicated alt for the tengu/loki. but the proteus Drones ftw. have a small hull reaper and armor reppr as refits. if you don't have access to citedels. 
---
drones are your lifeline. treat them as carefully as you can. 
---
have a zeguma in the mids with the travel fit + a 920 implant. for those high level exploration sites if you wana explore too.
---
and a wettu mobile depot. very hard to scan down will buy you time to refit fast in a hostile situation. but if you are being activly camped and unable to refit. keep get to a safe and keep pining off. crash and log off when your yellow timer is up. you can take on a fight with the ded fit.but you will most probably die sine your ship is a one trick pony. 
---
NCPL in the southeast and the northwest. 
---
Shield and Armor supercap fleets.
---
Breaking bads.
---
Seeing that you noted yourself as having T2 large projectiles and were interested in the Tempest, have some fits:
---
    [Tempest, brawl dual rep]
---
    Large Armor Repairer II
---
    Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II
---
    Reactive Armor Hardener
---
    Gyrostabilizer II
---
    500MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
    Warp Scrambler II
---
    Heavy Karelin Scoped Stasis Grappler
---
    Stasis Webifier II
---
    Heavy Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I, Navy Cap Booster 3200
---
    Dual 650mm Repeating Cannon II, Republic Fleet Phased Plasma L
---
    Heavy Energy Neutralizer II
---
    Medium Energy Neutralizer II
---
    Large Auxiliary Nano Pump I
---
    Large Nanobot Accelerator I
---
    Hammerhead II x5
---
    Hornet EC-300 x5
---
Running hot without drugs/implants/links this gets \~960 DPS omni tank (the RAH can drive this higher vs specific damage profiles)- switching to AAR+T2 gives more burst tank while you have paste in the rep, but much worse once you're out of paste. I personally favor dual T2, but it's really quite preferential.
---
Same goes for MWD vs MJD; MWD is great for mobility on grid and for, say, a blaster boat it allows you to ram'n'scram things, in addition to the usual benefit of being able to crash gate. MJDs are of course better for moonwalking away from things, but pretty much only nano kiting battleships (a super rare breed) and the Dominix- and *maybe* the super rare brawling rapid jesus Typhoon- can bring both MJD and MWD.
---
MWD can also be used to transversal match if you aren't scrammed, though naturally this is only relevant for turret battleships.
---
Note that for the above Tempest fit you can get dual heavy neuts, but you'll need to sacrifice one of the tank rigs- probably one of the nano pumps- for an ACR in order to have the necessary grid.
---
Note that cargo on the Tempest is quite a lot smaller than the Hyperion (or the Mega) and it requires much bulkier ammo than say a Domi (which usually fits cruiser guns), so your ability to carry a bunch of navy 3200s is rather more limited.
---
Nobody gives a fuck about the shitshow that is jita local. Spambots can’t spam, nothing of value was lost.
---
Hi!  
---
First of all this sheet is awesome, but I have some issues.
---
1. If I try GESI -&gt; Authorize Sheet I get the "invalid link" page already reported by someone else. But if I follow "Add-ons -&gt; GESI -&gt; Authorize Characters" I manage to reach the character selection. The problems is that even if I replaced characters\_character into the ESI assets pulls, for some reason it does not import anything.
---
2. Another thing is that when you select the Hulk from the list, all the numbers drop to zero.
---
I tried with different characters but I couldn't manage to making the sheet work.
---
Can I borrow some of your time?
---
Thanks  
---
Just hang out in perimeter 😛
---
You know, THE narrative.
---
See this is what happens when you offer too many isk doubling propaganda in Jita local. All those spam broke it! hahaha... only sigh of relief is safer entry to Jita from PRIAT and Marmite. If war dec'ing isn't going to be properly address beyond owning structures then I'm all for the delay. 
---
You can take the corp out of LowSec, but you can't take the LowSec out of the corp... 
---
Yea im going with something very similar. Just with 800s, one medium and one heavy neut and a dc
---
So wait, it currently has an equal chance to spawn in any system, but apparently that's 'unequal'? Under your suggestion, the 3 BR regions would be 2-4 times more likely to receive a Sotiyo spawn than any other region.
---
Sure, there are currently more Angels Sotiyo spawn opportunities than BR ones. But that's fine and makes sense, because there's more Angels space, and the chance of spawning a Sotiyo of any kind is evenly spread across space.
---
He's going to be gutted if he finally gets one only to get a notification upon trying to anchor it...
---
"Only one of these structures can be online at one time" 
---
Im sorry to hear about the situation. But I'm not surprised. I saw the writing on the wall a long time ago and got out. Your fellow corpies may be cool to hang out with  and all but once middle and upper management get involve all bets are off. They don't care about individual line members only  the Goons interest. Let it be a fair warning to all. Some reputations are debatable while others are fairly earned.

Thanks man, I still make a ton of mistakes, and their are plenty of people who are better than I am, but it's fun to work on it and try to improve. I am very glad you enjoy the videos.
---
Yes
---
Happened to me recently too, got DCed, i tried logging back in but all i got was server error and my gila died. CCP just told me that it was not server lag and thats it. It was not very expensive gila but still sad 😔. 
---
tl:dr
---
Any Titans spawning outside of delve in Sanctums or Haven ?
---
Maybe.
---
Did DHSJ even have any fleets with the rest of BL, or just doing their own thing around amarr fw.
---
This is the ideal Bhaal fit. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
It would help if you were more specific. The game clearly shows everything that you can't access as an alpha so you can decide for yourself.
---
Isn't the real solution(not the band aid) to this problem to finish coming out with content for the rest of the factions?
---
I'm talking everything, why not, right?
---
If it's going to be capitals online in 2019 can we at least have some depth? SOE dreads CCPlz!
---
Give every faction Sotiyos and give some depth to capital metas!
---
Caps Online TYOOL2019 open the flood gates!
---
If you can afford to buy a monthly sub or a pack that gives you game time try it out just for a month to see. 
---
 Just wondering the same, but I am coming from a point, where I already was subscribing and now returning after a 12 month break. More or less mandatory for me to enjoy the game... 
---
They just appear and yes other regions have faction npc caps just spawn in the last wave.
---
Eve 2019 in a nutshell.
---
"is it worth subscribing to a subscription based game?"
---
that's entirely up to you, mate.
---
Ha, Nerd.. oh wait.
---
In your case I would say no...
---
The thing is, you have to do something fun, and once you do that, you can multiply the fun by becoming an omega. Basically most gameplay can be accessed with alphas, but I doubt you even scratched at the surface of gameplays available... Did you join a Nullsec block yet, a small nullsec entity, wormhole, pirate, highsec demolishing groups, specialized SIGs in nullsec blocks, etc. 
---
Omega allows you to play with the big toys with the excellence of skills, but the actual game is the same.
---
They were in BL?
---
Omegas get double training speed (well, really, alphas get half speed), and access to skills which are critical for some career paths - cloaking and tech 2 frigates for exploration; tech 2 industry and mining, and mass production skills, for industry; volume skills and tech 2 industrials for trading. But for combat ships, the skills you need are all available as an alpha. Omega doesn't offer any new areas of gameplay, though it does enable you to be more effective in most of them.
---
If you don't know what you want to do as an alpha, you won't as an omega either.
---
Usually on GreenManGaming and Humble Bundle. You can can apply each pack once to an already existing account 
---
Personally I have never had anything bigger than a dread spawn in both Serpentis and Guristas havens after (way too much) ratting. I can probably cound the dread spawns on one hand as well.
---
Npc null has always had a bit different mechanics for special rats. 
---
You can cure a mental illness
---
Only always...
---
Alpha is like a demo trial mode. You get to try out lots of things, but you can't really get too deeply involved into anything before you run into "must be Omega" signs.
---
I yolod a freighter thru a 20+ small gang and lived
---
Brent and I talked about it the night before. This was back when it was group stages and you needed to be top two in points in your group to advance. We were very low on points compared to the rest of the group after the first match and I was afraid we wouldn't get enough points out of a match with PL to ensure our advancing. I made the argument to Brent, he agreed and tweaked the comp. It worked, too. We got 12 points instead of eight for coming into the match under strength and those were the extra points we needed to advance. From memory, we only needed two points so we could have come in four under strength instead of eight.
---
So high-sec would become goon-sec
---
Problem is also other people ping and nobody shows up unless its elo
---
Upvote for the translation, sad to not see a 2 in it though
---
That's how I feel.  Jita local is nothing but continuous spam.  I dont know why anyone could possibly miss it.
---
Bro! Your kid has talent! Let's see an Avatar next, oh! Or a Bargherst! Can we send isk to support this bad ass habit?
---
well it's home region vs non home region in this case.  Sometimes there is overlap between NPC null and Home regions but they are not necessarily the same (think great wildlands and syndicate)
---
Home region = officer spawn everywhere 
---
Non home region = officer spawns only in &lt;-0.7 iirc.   
---
Anyway when capital spawns were introduced you'd get regular dreads everywhere and in havens and sanctums and outside home regions you'd get faction titans and dreads in belts. Last patch they put Dark blood Titans and Dark Blood dreadnoughts into havens and sanctums.   Because this language is used for shouting at the monkey in the next tree it is hard to distinguish faction dread from nonfaction dread because when you say faction dread people think the 60m bounty, non [faction prefix] Dreadnought which is why people are responding with "Yeah i got a few dreadnoughts."  
---
I was asking specifically about the 120m bounty dreads and the 240m titans.  (which are actually 114m and 228m bounty but that's an entirely different story altogether.)
---
So you also ignored the part where I listed the UK's Computer misuse act?
---
Also illegal. Also not considered a protest. See what happened to this self proclaimed "Hacktavist" https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/anonymous-hackers-jailed-for-ddos-attacks-on-visa-mastercard-and-paypal-8465791.html

About 2 billion in ISK and three faction ships were sent to him.  He has had so much fun with it and training to fly his CNR finishes tomorrow morning.

Local there works
---
You really gotta admire the creativity involved in some of these "BL FAILSCADING" narratives.  DHSJ probably pulled out of BL for some of the same reasons DnG did - interest in more lowsec involvement, decreased member participation in alliance fleets, and a desire to grow as a group outside of BL's shadow.  
---
None of these things really have much to do with having "1 competent fc" in the alliance or muninns being boring. Sometimes people just need a change.  Reading all these supposed _deeper meanings_ reminds me of some highschool level literature analysis class.  
---
&gt;DickButt-Sec
---
FTFY
---
Well tbh BL has only one competent Fc. When Elo is afk, BL is afg.
---
I think he's talking about the DDOS that happened before the fight even started. Nobody was blaming burst jammers for that, as it happened before PH even formed.
---
I haven't seen local in weeks, lucky you
---
Love your videos man. Keep them coming! 
---
Well it carries on after you leave Jita as well
---
Never not take the bait.

i dont have adblocker i just also dont click any links that are on side bars for any website. i assumed u meant that if u click the link it auto redirects you to some phishing site which in over 4 years of using lightshot it has not once done to me or anyone in my guild 
---
oh yea. is it ironic to say already replaced? some nice XIX guy sold one public for 14 with t2 legacy rigs and about 3b in krabbing fit (which i sold off making the cost for my New Hammer 11b)
---
Is there a reason BL only flies Munnins? I thought that was just a meme 
---
are u in XIX bc if so i just bought the one that was in BWF :3
---
Maybe, I feel like the clips I recorded sounded terrible. It's definitely true that none of us like the sound of our own voice.
---
does that make Spectre Fleet the aunty :thinking:
---
Well the most fun I've had in this game was stealing loot from other people :P seems exciting to loot in middle of battle and walk off with it. I'm sure it'll work out!
---
thats not a super its just a Drake with the new "Hammer Time" skin thx /u/CCP_Falcon 
---
Wow, that is not insignificant! Glad he's having fun. Looking forward to seeing more Lego!
---
Nope I am making around 500 m a day but I keep losing faction ships with deadspace mods in pvp. :( As of right now I make 500 mil a day combat looting in pandemic horde space. I know it's 500 mil because when I decided to go for Omega it only took 3 days to Plex Omega.
---
He said, "Yes please.  I can't do the curves of the Avatar but I can try the Barghest."  I'd rather not share a kid's Eve name but mine is Tyrannee and I'll forward to him.  
---
BTW, join today. Skills for Venture and Thrasher required. Anything above is bonus. 
---
I probably didn't know your friend but that doesn't matter. What I do know is that those he flew with in this game knew  him well. If they went to Reykjavik to hold a memorial for your friend he must have ment a lot to those that knew him. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
I would say yes. Using assault frigs like the jaguar makes it possible to be fast tackle and not feed 24/7. Bomber fleets are also fun, even when it’s just Mist dropping a single VNI I still enjoy the fleet. T2 exploration frigates are also a huge upgrade if you do that, especially since dodging gatecamps becomes trivial with them. T3ds are also great for pretty much anything, from sniping to brawling. 
---
I haven’t trained any t2 cruisers yet, but being able to fly mainline dps/logi on the big fleets would make them a lot more interesting. Although, if you’re not in a big nullsec Corp this probably doesn’t really matter to you. 
---
That removes a massive ISK sink.  Jita transaction fees eat insane amounts of isk, and removinf that will mean the new ISK from ratting, missions, selling sleeper loot, etc. will drown the economy.  
---
Good call from a good pop. Your kid has skill. Get him a 3D art set for the PC at some point
---
Dont be a retard, but a nos in the top
---
That is pretty legit.
---
Hello, how did pulling your corp out work for you? See you lost many men. 
---
If only there was a legocad and you could release block lists for your own builds.
---
The best post on here by far.
---
Feeding titans on an anchoring fortizar is though :biglowesecthink:
---
At least they didn’t post shit tier daily circle jerk youtube videos about it, like their first iteration.
---
Oh well, one trick pony gonna one trick.
---
Sounds like you are abit lost in the game, Omega will not help with that.
---
Are you in a sutible Corparation? If you are not in one, come join Pandemic Hord(or brave or test). All ships that you can fly as a alpha will be given to you for free and every skill book for them. There are lots of fleets 24/7 so you can find out what you enjoy.
---
If you are in a Corp already make sure they are doing what you enjoy.
---
Vagabond over Muninn for abyssals?
---
Alpha is more or less an unlimited trial. Omega is where the meat of the gameplay is at.
---
Thanks to skill injectors/extractors you can keep an account in Omega state at near zero cost indefinitely by recycling the skillpoints into injectors and selling them, at the cost of not getting any additional usable skillpoints.
---
I'm at the point now where i have everything I need trained and the accounts subscription pays for itself. If something new that requires additional skillpoints comes up I just buy the needed PLEXes to train it.
---
Hey I was there for that in goons. You bastards bombed me :P

Thanks man, you and me both. Happy new year!

He's started using stud.io but still isn't a huge fan.  I told him the more he uses it the more comfortable he'll get.

It looks like your making good money then with one character.  I’d suggest looking at the ships and mods your using to see if you can do it cheaper.
---
You're in Perimeter, right?
---
Indeed. She'll be missed
---
For clarification: My comment had nothing to do with DHSJ leaving BL.  It was a response to the OP saying Elo "went afk again"
---
my appologies if I mislead you. it HAS been a while since I started a new omega account. I guess things have changed and I hope I didn't fuck it up for you.  
---
(never thought I would give a hat tip to a CODE player... u/CptMunninator May the next hulk you find be max yield fit.)
---
Yeah, I had left Jita with an actual working local to Perimeter, then it had abandonment issues and kept trying to re-insert itself into my life
---
As of right now I'm mainly using dramiels and gilas for pvp. Problem is that in horde space it's almost impossible to get a 1v1 or 2v2 fight :(
---
Their members get tired of typing "Drink, Whelp, Repeat" in local.  DNG is a strange cult.

What about  [D0nnieDark0](https://zkillboard.com/character/1166488821/) ?

I need to check that out!

Muninns **are** pretty good fun - but as you say, even if your card is a good one if you play the same one every time then it's increasingly easy to counter.

People like to bag on CCP for balancing mistakes, but to do them justice, there's really a very diverse mix of viable doctrines these days . (Heck, even *Ravens* are useful again :preen: )

Hey Man yeh I remember you the rifter vs your Tristan was a sick 1v1 :) and thanks for the complements will see what's its like with light music in the background for my next video

Since real life is keeping me busy and inactive, here is my last 2018 clip for my pixel friends and nostalgia reasons. No special piloting or plays, just casually fighting Horde Beans with Sixty in Nosprey - Retri pre ecm nerf. Looking forward to shoot and agressively banter with all of you again. Happy new year.

a sloppy way to do it is warp-&gt; see aligning line-&gt; cancel warp-&gt; manually align

"derp" is "pred" spelled backwards.

this is the real answer OP needs to read.

My favourite way is to buy large quantities of high volume items and then set my price a good 10-20% above the average. Then I just let time and demand slowly fill my pockets.

First, don't worry about your age. Lots of people start playing EVE in their teens, many in their early teens and a few even earlier. It's no handicap to either playing or admission into any corp or alliance.
---
Second, I strongly recommend you join a new player corp such as Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, or Karmafleet. Representatives of each will be in this thread soon to point you in the right direction. ;-) EVE is much easier playing with friends, particularly people who understand the limitations that you're operating under and can help you overcome them.

Regarding ship fitting, I wrote the following several years back but it still stands up pretty well:

It's also useful to ask corp mates for advice (once you have corp mates) about ship fittings for tasks that they do commonly. They'll have lots of information to share with you. In a good corp, someone will take you under his wing and walk you through the steps for some of the stuff you want to do to make ISK, if not take you physically along with them while they do things.
---
Is it okay to be in a Corporation/Alliance and not be active a lot?
---
Cutesy error messages get old really quick when it's the server that's fucking up.
---
When you will be quitting Eve shortly, can I have your stuff please?
---
&lt;3 FXR. Best and braves small entitiy in EvE ! Even Kendarr approves their quality !
---
I’m bad 
---
HICs are perfectly fine, carriers need to be fixed. Change my mind.
---
That weird thing those of us in K-Space use. It's very uncivilized, but how else are you supposed to REE when something happens?
---
Why did you stop?
---
I've never gone on an NPSI fleet.  I would assume they do, although I'm sure it just depends on the FC's wishes for that fleet.

Can you explain this "undocking" ? Killah Bee here, gimme a hint please. My cheeks are glowing for that kind of information !

American ?

Hi Wald, nice to see you and belated ~~condolences~~ congratulations on your wedding!
---
There's definitely more niches you can try with an Omega character. 
---
For example, flying an interceptor/interdictor is some of the most fun i've had in this game. Or being able to fly t2 logi will make everyone in corp's heads turn whenever you waltz in.
---
Don't fall into the trap of immediately trying to pay for Omega via in game plex purchased with isk. It will turn EVE into a job.
---
Imagine that the average NC. Pilot would have ripped off that implants already before the Nightmare even would have a chance to get on the pod.
---
*Eve is real, I was there.*
---
Thanks, I’m getting back in school tomorrow so I won’t be active too often.
---
Bollocks, horde is terrible for a new player to learn anything. The comment around finding a decent corp is however the way to go. Look for something smaller rather than a big corp in a big alliance. Find a small helpful corp, doesn't matter where. If they are helpful and work together you will learn and grow. If you want to go to null, then from my experience a corp like froosh is very helpful, and by that I mean they involve you in what they are doing. Not sure they take alpha. I have heard concord branch office in HS is OK.
---
**It is also very much going to depend on your Time zone.** 
---
Look for a corp which has a ceo with more than a few years under his  belt. If you on before down time let me know and I will be happy to do some stuff with you to get an idea of what is possible.
---
There are multiple ex-HK members that are motorcycle guys, me included. Fortunately, I am not married.
---
Anyway, I feel the same way about HK.
---
This is why you don't join horde, a ship doesn't make the game fun, its the people you interact with. 
---
Maybe the fact that they couldn’t build a proper cap fleet for 3 years?
---
Or maybe 1 hour + formup times?
---
Or maybe it is the divide between North and South Provi which has done nothing but hurt then?
---
Only reason that Provi is still standing is that no one wants this region. Great for content but not much else
---
Booooooooooo, no interceptor footage.
---
Nice fights, DaeDrah. Keep em coming.
---
Let's see some ceptor footage soon ;)
---
no problem
---
maybe mining is more your skill level
---
As long as you let them know and don't just go awol for 6 months 95% of corps/alliance won't mind and you just jump back in to it, I'd use this time to start lining up some long rank 5 skills if your keeping omega up during term times
---
because no1 cares
---
The best isk/hr, aside from running C3 anoms in a rattle, was advertising my isk halving business in Jita local.  Made close to 100m/hr from people who thought it was hilarious.

---
yikes
---
Well last cap fight we had about 20 hics warped into our cap fleet. They died like they were T1 mallers. They can't get reps while doing their job, everything else that cannot be remote repped gets MASSIVE self boost bonuses, which HICs do not get. Provided you are in nullsec, dictors are cheaper, and do their job better. Combine that with the addition of "Heavy" warp distruptors/scramblers, and they become completely useless.
---
So they either need a buff, or a new role. My suggestion is to have nullification not work on HIC bubbles.
---
What obsolete languages do they use?
---
I'll just leave my downvote here if you dont mind
---
1st thing I would recommend doing is joining pandemic horde (Other corps available I just like this one), great newbie Corp and they will answer any questions you have as well as give you plenty of hands on experience, they also give next to zero fucks about how old you are or any time committments as long as your somewhat active and aren't a dick. As for fitting ships, that comes with time and knowledge of what you want to achieve with your ship, you'll pick up stuff from Corpmates and using a corps doctrine ships aswell. Another good resource is zkill, you can look at top pilots for a specific ship and what fits they use. 
---
Lol don’t join a small corp first thing. Big alliances will be better for new bros, as there are plenty of people to ask for help and so many resources for getting your feet in eve. Horde is a great choice OP.
---
This was what drove the major wars of the tech bottleneck era and it was a great content generator, some space needs to suck some needs to be average, some needs to be awesome otherwise why bother fighting to take what someone else has if you can just set up on baltic ave, and get the same return as the guy who shelled out for boardwalk.
---
This is stainguy common  
---
badposting and reeing about 'the north' is all he does   
---
I miss the early days of logical posts about stain and news from there
---
Apparently Delve is not a good enough region.
---
I'm well aware of your channel and standing fleet. Hard not to be aware when y'all don't shut up about it week in and week out.
---
Just saying, there's an incongruity between saying you "welcome and empower carebears" and then being utter dicks when they don't take advantage. 
---
In response to "Carriers", while they are quite effective in one off situations (Where you were probably dead anyway), in massive fleet combats it just turns into a space superiority fighter fight. They actually end up doing very little damage to anything else.
---
I don’t even know how to respond to that, have a nice day with your 6 DDAs and not asking for help if you need it
---
Use a laptop.
---
1. gf ;) 
---
2.  its called -DTS- \^\^
---
3. Triage is too good on subcaps vs. non alpha doctrines in my opinion
---
4. we see Derelik as a "second home". We have our ties in this region and dont wanted to let it go down without at least a little resistance
---
5. we asked Frat. if they wanted to join, cause we thougt about a possible little "cap fight", so we scanned a nice wormhole connection
---
Not really, CCP actually balanced the transition pretty well for the long term. (Short term spiked a bit as there was a supply gap and hoarders).
---
What is wrong with dscan and combat probing? 
---
HICS are ineffective at tackling caps, so the answer is obviously to make it so they can catch interceptors.
---
Totally agree with OP here. 
---
Even though i dont like instances, abyss is one of the most fun PVE options atm and its sad not everyone can enjoy it equally due to fear of disconnects.
---
Lets look at different reasons for disconnects:
---
1) Server or node crash/lag/bug/other problem
---
There is nothing player can do about it. And for some reason CCPs policy is to NOT reimburse any loss even though everywhere else in EVE they do. Fortunately these are pretty rare even with current state of EVE. Happened to me only twice so far.
---
2) Electricity problems
---
You can buy UPS and it will solve 80% of problems but it wont save you when your ISP loses power too or when power outage lasts longer than few minutes.
---
According to r/eve i should move to different city/state :D and to different climate that does not have snow and storms. Or maybe i should build my own power plant...
---
3) Connection issues
---
In lot of places there is only one or two ISPs (excluding wireless internet but that is even worse), all using the same base infrastructure so when one fails they all do.
---
Again reddit thinks i should change my ZIP code but that seems bit too much even when we are talking about EVE.
---
4) Random cosmic rays hitting my RAM :D (hardware fails and other reasons)
---
And again there is pretty much nothing you can do.
---
So unless you live in underground atomic shelter with redundant internet connection and diesel generators you are out of luck and sooner or later will lose a ship. I have lost quite a few due to each of those since introduction of abyss and i live in city/town with 30k people in the middle of Europe, hardly some rural village in the middle of nowhere.
---
5) And one bonus problem: why the hell does it take up to 40 seconds (20 on average) to leave the abyss? What the actual fu*k, that is not normal game mechanic, that has to be a joke, CCPpls. What should we do when we cant trust the literal numbers on the timer!
---
This is not the last of my problems with abyss but enough for today...
---
Now short list of possible solutions i came up while writing this post. I am sure CCP could figure out something too, possibly better, but they dont seem to care about paying customers.
---
1) Since abyss is instanced there is nothing that would prevent CCP to just hit pause on everything when player disconnect and just wait until he connects back. It would not affect anything in EVE universe (you might argue that come beacon camper might have to wait longer but do you really thing that is such a big deal?).
---
2) Stop the instance but give limited time (10-15 minutes seems fair) to login back. This is my preferred option.
---
3) Stop the time (and your ship would have to be able to tank the npcs without you)
---
4) Making ship invulnerable to npcs (and you would have to finish the site in standart time minus how long it took to get back). This is probably the worst option but still an improvement.
---
I cannot see a change that would allow them to tackle capitals, that would not make them broken as fuck.
---

It's why the game is so damn stagnant now. All space has the same minerals available from moons. All space has sotiyos. All space has good anomoly ratting. All space has dread/super/titan npc spawns.  There is literally nothing that makes any region more/less attractive than any other bar 'ease of logistics'.

&gt;Why is test still doing stuff in **stain**?

  Erm, VYJ is in Esoteria m8

DTS.TrainingCamp is based In Thirarer (Derelik) so they use the few structures owned by DTC in that losec pocket
---
This made my day. That's just hilarious and genius at the same time.
---
buy 500 plex on sisi and upgrade account that way worked for me and saved me 6 bill plus pods testing 
---
Thanks for the colour. Always good to hear from the other side.
---
remove yourself
---
So why is the chat going haywire and why hasn't ccp fixed it yet?
---
If you waited too long to start it, or had to warp out partway through, it's possible your site despawned. Contacting CCP is probably a good idea, but you should also be able to safely abandon and restart the mission.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have fucked with the wrong alliance
---
no - because the song is actually good
---
Was thinking escalation as a loot item that would be obvious to a buyer where it takes place, and probably have a bit longer to run than the normal 24h, but good point about explo in hostile space.
---
At least in Minecraft the player can decide whether they want creeper's gutted. With MMOs there isn't that option. Why not make it a server option if enough people want this?
---
you did fit a frig size shield booster to a cruiser...
---
So much this.

lowsec is dead
---
it's a good design change

that means they wont do it

I wanna steal some things that do not belong to me, FC how find?

I vote stick with text. Much easier to edit/fix as you remember or notice things in the video, rather than recording a whole segment of voice again. 
---
Also, since you have music and some folks may not enjoy your music selection, they can mute the vid and still obtain 100% of the information.

You and /u/captainkirkandco both do a great job of concise explanations of reasoning/mistakes.

yes, we do need 30 posts like these every day

They wont even talk about it never mind fix it

Getting back stabbed. Eve Onine things.

As for the Hulk did you set a BPC and Runs Amounts?

Yep, good advice.

Haha, thank you!

Anyway, yes, I set BPC and Runs, but I have zero everywhere. It seems happing with all the ORE's ships (Exhumers and Expedition Frigates).

Omega lets you do a few things you can't do as an alpha and offers more of the same but bigger. There's a comparison table here https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213020969-Alpha-and-Omega-Clone

The metor pack is on sale on humble bundle which gives you 1 months of omega and some plex if you just want to try out without having to subscribe https://www.humblebundle.com/store/eve-online-meteor-pack
---
Most alpha friendly corps will have alpha ship doctrines that you can fly without upgrading and give you advice and help in making isk/fun. No one is useless, if you can fly a t1 tackle frigate then you can fly in a big fleet and pew pew blingy expensive shit.
---
You made a thread about Horde standing fleet comms and drama? What is this your first week of spying?
---
ye its cringy enough without even mentioning this lol
---
Correction it was BLESSED beans standing fleet comms.
---
Not blessed enough to not get yelled at and threatened with purges for questioning why we never attack Goon/Test citadels though.
---
Mikal doesnt dng leave an alliance every few weeks or so you guys have a very short attention span
---
Cuz there are not that many players to inhabit so much space
---
EVE will be a completely different story with 60k peak concurrent online
---
They joined on like max kta fleets but even a quick look at the killboard shows they were more focused on FW space than nullsec 
---
Breathe hard into a microphone
---
Yeah, the only difference is like escalations, buuut people dont care too much. Other than that - truesec and location.
---
So far i only see to so get on it... Post post!!
---
Join a corporation. They will offer goals and if they are a larger, organized activities, standing fleets and advice on where to head next.
---
Great to see some more videos from you, one of the things that got me into pvp alot more was watching your videos :)
---
Basically due to game changes last few years, the comparative advantage gap has been widened so large between the rental space and the mega empire space. Almost nobody except botters rent anymore.
---
Due to mechanics like how 2 regions are actually enough to address all Eve nullsec's krabbing needs, major krabbing alliances recruit pretty much everyone they can. And they demand less of your time compared to what you'd spend trying to maintain and protect your rental space. And they provide perks like good infrastructure.
---
Also Rorqual/titan ratting in rental space is a death sentence. And with supers you'd need to be really careful when you can just AFK in krab empire space.
---
Was. Eve was different at 60k peak. It's not likely getting back to that point at the rate were going.
---
theyre already old when youve seen them 0 times

nidia threatening to purge people is a weekly occurrence

its a meme you dip

oof! haha good. hes a dickhead

I too hate that cyno character
---
«is shit talking FC’s»
---
Really makes you think what part made them react..
---
maybe if we ignore gooners and pets they will just leave.
---
Old news that horde is garbage. The real news is why TEST and NuGoons are too cowardly to fight each other. 
---
Nice vid Mr Deadwood. Kudos. 
---
The module is trash to me for normal exploration so I never noticed, but god this is hilarious. Fits in perfectly with the level of effort on this latest event.
---
Try multiboxing logi on a smallish fleet, oh boy, do you even multitask ?
---
Here, have a downvote.
---
It's a good ship that works well, can punch up a fair bit without needing ~huge~ numbers, avoids some downfalls of BS fleets that are doubly annoying for a non-sov alliance like BL, and also Elo just really likes them.
---
It was the go to for basically every iteration of BL since the Muninn was reworked. WL used them almost exclusively as well.
---
There's been a constant supply of these posts since March. Come on op.
---
On the one hand - sad to lose a player dedicated like that. On the other hand - they were banned for RMT, fuck em. 
---
It's elo's favourite ship. It is also very versatile and combat effective, especially in the hands of a skilled FC. Can fight pretty much anything with enough of them, and they can leave whenever they want.
---
Tbh, Haven't actually seen a DHSJ member in whatever AOO we are in.
---
And found the issue with that. Forgot to re-extend the search area for Gallente Based ships when I was tidying up some formulas.
---
Fixed on the Pulbic sheet.

If you want to go it on your copy just do a find an replace in the Calculations Tab with these two. Both should replace 45 instances

where did elo touch you?
---
It's worse than a Zeugma at double the cost. Some reward this is.
---
In your case i wouldn't recommend it, omega doesn't "unlock" fun. Eve is as fun as you make it yourself, its a sandbox afterall. Omega compared to current alpha with recent changes doesnt provide anything usefull for a newbie, you can use t2 guns, t2 tank and good faction ships. Find a corp that will suite you and as you progress you will figure out a point when you have to turn into omega on your own.
---
That makes me happy, their are a lot of things wrong with EVE, but when a good fight comes together it is an experience like nothing I have ever enjoyed in another game.
---
elo goes AFK over the Holiday breaks, like most people who have a life outside of this game. clearly he has gone afk for ever and BL is failcascading 
---
&gt;Not blessed enough

yes
---
Zeugma is 200m in parts to build from bpc, the frostline is 40m as of a few days ago.
---
Zeugma also needs hacking and archeology V, with arch V and hacking IV the frostline just beats a T2 relic analyzer, can do both data and relic, and you only give up one utility slot.
---
Honestly it seems OP, I bought 10.
---
Good tip! Thank you. 
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
Being a tryhard in Horde. It’s like you passed the test not to lick the windows first day on your job at McDonalds so you can now be trusted not to drink the bleach and got promoted to bogtroll.
---
I agree with Olemca, the game would be much better if renting space was a more attractive option. 
---
I enjoy a good shit post as much as the next man, but yours aren’t good.
---
I see you conveniently missed 99% of the chat to make drama out of nothing
---
he cant reach me, hes too tall
---
I love this, fuck local. 
---
Did he say jump ship?
---
Yes we need to improve renting........
---
How about smaller sov owning entities... that would be all around better for the game.  But greed etc etc.
---
EFA: Hilmar fired everyone and now pimps out skin work on fiverr, whilst eating mangos on his yacht in the Caymans.
---
Renters typically want exclusive access to space, regardless of their actual capability of exploiting that space.
---
Also, renter groups tend to not be very big. Once you have a group that's past a certain size, you start to be able to do more substantial things.
---
They moved it to its own cloud based server.  Its never worked since.  
---
Ligature doesn’t seem to be useful because of its strength and while I am ok with two utility slots only having one is crippling. It’s also 100m to build from parts.
---
Would being able to play the game without a bunch of limits be worth it?
---
Some of these threads are fucking stupid.
---
#LocalGuy
---
nidia is a fucking retard lmao
---
Looks like I should buy more before the price goes up.
---
You would think that they would if known that wouldn't of worked.....im not a cloud expert though.
---
Because we love goons. Goons are best bros.
---
Because the krabs are concentrated to a few well protected systems, feeding on the endlessly spawning anoms. There's no reason to spread out as one system can support a fair number of people indefinitely. There's also too few people currently logging in to be able to occupy all space successfully, but I think spreading out the ratters of Legs and Imps would help a lot to the specific issue you're referencing. 
---
when we had 60k PCU it was also like, probably 30k unique players? now the current state of the game you'd likely have 10k unique players or less
---
anyone notice how goons have been trying so hard at reddit the last 6 months or so
