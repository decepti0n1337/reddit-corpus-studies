If you couldn't understand that I really don't know how you get to work/school or pay bills on time.

---
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Lol and they call me tinfoil
---
&gt;Oh wait, they tell them to dock up while the supercap fleet is deployed?
---
they were told to dock their ratting ships and come participate. But I can understand how a panfamer would confuse "docking up" with "going on campaign"
---
I would use a Myrmidon long before a regular Vexor, since the regular Vexor is bonused for guns, not drones
---
If I somehow get elected it will be thanks to the Goon reaction to threads related to me
---
A Myrmidon with an oversized prop mod will handle a lot more than a 4/10. It will do Forsaken Hubs with ease.
---
Got any hot pics of the mittani?
---
Fuck Amazon, agreed. They have FAR too many ads n about and have started hiding them a little too.
---
Not a fan.
---
No need. I meant what I said, it's still accurate, and it explains why he wasn't going to bother replying, individually, to a group of people that can't understand directions.
---
Do this thought exercise: If the group that had this issue was even **REMOTELY** close to the majority, would CCP still have neglected to give out the rewards? I'll ruin it for you: No. If there was that big of a misunderstanding CCP would have said "Our Bad"; instead, they said "some of y'all didn't read...that's your fault".
---
I'm more interested in seeing Aryth try to do his gay metagame shit to someone who's not invested in nullsec lol
---
one day i will be as jacked and hot as tomalak and almost as good at pvp. great stuff as always.
---
I dont think compyn has done his yet
---
There's an incursion in Fabas right now. Sansha is scaling back because of sp00ky Triglavians.
---
Lol you are going thru histories of every positive comment about me to prove they are my alts aren't you.
---
Not gonna lie reading these goon badpost give me headaches don't they have actual good posters somewhere?
---
I guess you promote suiciding caps on the undock then
---
What’s the connection here? Draw it out for me like I am actually stupid.
---
Me and a few irl buddies started last month, its hard to make any money in hi-sec and we dont want to be another puppet in nullsec, so we decided on wh life, anchored our first citadel in a c3. We are literally only 6 weeks in at this point, have some shitty t1 BS/BC etc, were ratting around having a decent time but were basically just trying to get break even on the citadel setup at this point. A week goes by and were almost to break even when a larger group starts evicting us. We assemble to fight them on the last timer, but we have only 3 BS versus 10+ enemies and we are lowskilled, we lose everything and my friends quit. GG
---
And Imperium skins too... oh wait....
---
natural progression lol
---
Story time, 
---
A few months ago, I decided to go out solo gatecamping in a sabre (maybe I'd catch marshy or one of crasters wives).
---
A friendly vindicator showed up a half hour later,  sat on the gate at 0. Didn't jump.  "Strange, but ok" I thought
---
Then an aeon warped at 30. Followed by a devoter at 0. Followed by a Lif at 0.
---
"Huh, maybe I should get out of here"
---
Then 6 titans warped in, each to a different spot on the gate. The Lif, Vindicator, and Devoter all locked me up. 
---
Now,  utterly convinced I was going to be hexa-bosoned by a bored goon, I convoed the Vindicator, who invited me onto his gatecamp.
---
We spent the next 3 hours obliterating everything that jumped through that gate. 
---
I asked the guy "What are those titans for,  DPS?" He replied "No, just decloaking. I don't even have them tabbed much"
---
And that's when I realized how stupidly space rich some goons are.
---
can not upvote this enough...lore is interesting but this is player history!
---
last news was that his enyo is stuck in traffic control on a wh...ccpls
---
Isn't this from Brain-in-a-box?
---
I miss the map of where things are, was cool for the epic arcs page
---
Also interested in this.
---
calm down miner, you got structures to bash still
---
It really depends on what activity you plan on doing to get ISK. Simplest for an alpha is probably either exploration or VNI ratting. Exploration is very inconsistent, but you can easily make a good amount of money for very little skill investment. VNI ratting is very consistent but much more boring. I haven't calculated it, but a VNI skillplan is probably around 2-3 months (haven't calculated it though). Exploration is nearly day 1. You can spend a day or two getting max alpha skills for explo.
---
To be honest, if you like the game and can afford it, you're much better paying for it. You will be miserable after spending the around 35-40 hours of VNI ratting needed to PLEX an account. There are faster ways to make ISK once you're omega for a few months (ex: incursions) if you really want to be 100% free to play
---
Not a fan either

Did you listen to the video?
---
Being in the room with Olmeca would be the real punishment, for the other CSM and CCP
---
Looking at coming back and haven't played since around 2015 and was hoping there was a comprehensive guide to read on all of the changes without having to comb through patch notes (for instance I heard you don't need to insure your clone anymore?)
---
Really interested in coming back, but holy hell even the skill interface and plex system have changed dramatically.
---
didnt he also argue in favor of, or at least not against, gold ammo?  that's a disqualifier right there, imo
---
5+ minutes of rambling about things unrelated to the initial question turned me off from even finishing this.
---
Woooo Twitch prime loot!!
---
As you talk about lewtboxes I think you need to take a stronger stance.
---
Lootboxes are gambling, they're [designed like casino slot machines](https://massivelyop.com/2019/05/20/ex-cryptic-studios-artist-decries-harmful-video-game-lockbox-designs-based-on-slot-machines/). They're unethical and illegal in some jurisdictions. They have no place in EVE, not now, not ever.
---
A huge part of being on the GSM is understanding how to talk to CCP. I think you're going to win, so I'll tell you this: Pay 2 Win (P2W) is perceived wildly differently in Western and Eastern cultures. In the West we like to play for our space stuff and view industriousness as an honor - whether that's skill in combat or business acumen, take your pick. In the East to purchase online goods is seen as a mark of prestige, that you're monied enough to afford it. (There's an excellent GDC talk from a Nexon producer about this, but I'm too lazy to dig it up right now).
---
You need to think about how to help CCP manage this cultural difference with their new Pearly Abyssal overlords, because over the next five years this will be the make-or-break for EVE Forever.
---
good

Reinstall?  It looks fine.

Fair enough.

Purpose was to get you login and show nice numberz to investors with you not even playing.
---
Well they did fuck all to celebrate did they? Just gathered a bunch of stuff related to the game, put it as an ingame item, and just so you care at all (and so they can show off them numbers) they put up juicy SP for you to claim. Except it isnt gift, its a reward. Gifts were items from Yule Lads. This was shit.
---
I dont think you understand the issue at all.
---
I dont care about SP, I care about CCP not giving a fuck about their game.
---
I've found that the sigs only update when you first log in. This would help the people who don't have a lot of time to play, but does not help stuff that's on for a while, e.g. bots. IMHO, this is the best possible outcome for this feature without completely removing it.
---
Hy Wanto still hasn't interviewed yet.

But we can't have too much fun with Alliance logos because 'muh grimdark'. Sounds legit.

This post exemplifies the disaster of current null meta for players raised in it, who know little to nothing of what came before it. Congratulations.
---
Tbf 6 normal titans are propably a better Investment than a faction titan
---
In the patch notes for the Trig invasions, it was stated HS will go from 3 incursions down to 1.  There is a respawn timer as usual.  Just, when there was 3, it didn't matter too much.  Now that there is only 1 in hs with 4 HQ communities, it's a shit show.
---
Let us be the judge of that.

Does Olmeca Gold really want to do away with risk free gameplay? I don't think so, his entire campaign calls for nerfing defence fleets (supercap umbrellas for example) and nerfing defence in general. Olmeca's in game activities consist almost exclusively of killing defenceless miners and ratters who rely on defensive fleets to fight back.   
---
To me, Olmeca actually wants to create MORE risk free gameplay for his playstyle, he wants to nerf defence so that he can kill miners and raters with 100% impunity, in other words, risk free.   
---
The way I see it, if you want to do whaling then you run the risk of being destroyed by defence fleets. I see no problem with this.
---
grr gons
---
Sure
---
Which version you are running? It was running ok in the previous version.  But the latest one, 2.9.4, the graph function is greyed out.  I have two instances of PYFA running in two separate computer - both have same issues.  I doubt it is because of the corrupted installation.
---
You're right, they don't care so much they continue to release.... Expansions....
---
Can confirm, tried to jump through earlier and was informed that "you cant do that while undocking"
---
Pos code was stopping this still is but it was
---
I hadn't even heard of this till today, and I been playing for two years! O.o
---
lets be real.   
---
it was either completely random, or CCP dicked the coding and they all tried to spawn in the same place.  
---
kek if anyone thinks thats intentional
---
I have never seen fleet of Drifter Battleships without some kind of event running.  But then again, I hardly ever venture out to highsec.  May be drifter battleships are normal in highsec?
---
Because they needed to pull lore out of their ass instead of iterating on a group already in the game. The entire concept of "The Agency" is horrible.
---
I'm not saying the system itself is bad, although there are parts I do, in fact, hate. I'm saying that the naming of it and introducing this all powerful group that has its finger in more things than even CONCORDE is just mind boggling, especially since there was never a mention of this group prior to its introduction.
---
A better idea would have it be in line with Sisters of Eve or Society of Conscious Thought.
---
Would that turn the keepsake into a giant spod rock ?
---
Nah, I thought you guys were staging out of a Frat citadel cos I saw you guys running with them and shitposting with them so much in the past week.
---
Too bad you weren't, I would have loved a fight, Frat just dropped fuckin supers on us.
---
2.9.4 install works fine here, can graph anything and can open an empty graph with no fit.
---
Reinstall.

Drifter BS can spawn in the reinforcement wave when you kill Autoscythian Lancers, it could have been some leftovers from that
---
Will they engage one-another, or will they just collectively attack the players?
---
Yes, but it's a trial account, I paid for nothing. :)
---
I'll have to check out the new Agency window. I've always struggled understanding this game.
---
man  they should realy shoot eachother (lore whise). it would spice up the space.
---
Yea I hear arranged fights in wh space are all the rage.
---
You are getting downvoted by all the lazy fuck pvpers out there in modern eve.

6s Combat Probes, Bubble Nullification, WH teleports, WarpAcceleration buff.

The attacker has gotten consistent power creep in eve since 2008, and it has only harmed the ecosystem.
---
Ive heard they’ve reduced highsec spawns (which is a good thing imo), there will now be 1 spawn and it won’t be up 24/7 as it takes a few days to respawn. I don’t have a source for it though just someone mentioned it to me.
---
I was the Dominix pilot at the start of number 2 :)

I just installed the update just now.

Jesus fuck this is bad.  You don't rat in a gila lmao.

Rattles are memes that die.
---
Good now they’ll have to contest more which was always the most fun part of when I flew highsec incursions. More concentrated ganking, less efficiency (for a highsec activity I think incursions are a bit too lucrative), and more full fleets as people can be with multiple communities in the same system (eg if WTM isn’t running you don’t have to go to a different system to join a TVP fleet).
---
The more people moving out of highsec to low/null the better imo
---
I wish I got approached for an interview :(
---
I re-downloaded and re-extracted the winzip version.  Unfortunately, I still have the same issues - graph is greyed out.  Are you using the .exe version or the winzip version?
---
If you use citadels, use View Outside Station that way the black screen will only occur the first time you log in.
---
Absolutely seething
---
&gt; No ones gonna undock anything expensive they know they have even a &gt;25% of losing. 
---
...I do this every other day, but ok. From the perspective of encouraging active gameplay, it'd be great to have the "sweet spot" of isk-making pushed into this realm too. Push both risk and reward upward, so that there are more explosions. You can probably get net isk-making to go higher too, and all us hunter types will be happy because more explosions.
---
Like it but for two things.
---
Seeing exploration stuff systems away.
---
And it's not realizable.
---
Dont forget about the 64bit client too... yup. they absolutely don't care...
---
no. You cant see the timer when it unanchors. thats the reinforcement day and time if you shoot at it.
---
nobody actually makes profit making t1 hulls anyways
---
By spodbraining even more, right?
---
Without unrestrained space capitalism, how do you expect us to pay for all this luxury gay space communism?
---
I fucking LOVE Mike Oldfield.
---
I always thought it was in Garry's Mod or somethin. Was made before the source animation thing came out
---
So the agency is supposed to be something along the lines of space masons/illuminatis that share their shortcuts through that interface? the more you know...
---
yeah the old events were much better, this event theyve given you SP and then basically trash. Before they would have new sites that people would run for skill boosters (gave you +10 attributes for example) that you could sell or use yourself (effectively giving you SP). It was great content I'd go around in a gila and ceptor alt hunting people running them and running a few myself if i got bored.
---
why replace that with login and you dont even have to undock and you still get stuff? because wow look how successful this even was it increased our login metrics by almost double! then they pat eachother on the back not realizing that it was mostly just people logging in skill farms everyday and not actually engaging with the game like the old events had you do.
---
CCP must be the worst developer in the world from a "knowing one's own game" perspective.
---
Also, don't miss out on "Ticket Zero", the Clear Skies creators last (and very underrated) movie:

You absolutely can rat in a Gila. It's a decent middle-of-the-road option between a VNI and a Rattlesnake that doesn't take as much time to get into as an Ishtar.

And I get that you don't get out much, but wormhole space is a *thing*. That *exists*. And dreads/Rattles are absolutely the meta for ratting in wormholes.

Pull your head out of your ass.

He's never lied to us before. Well, except for that one time he said he was a wizard.

I think non goons generally don't understand what a lunatic sperg olmeca actually is. He keeps it relatively calm on reddit, but just as he can't help but respond to every post about him, he loses his mind in local at even the mildest banter. People should really start posting screencaps of his meltdowns; they're some surreal shit.

I believe it's made with half life 2 but I'm not sure.  Just something I remember reading once.
---
So you're saying the game mechanics gave goons their wealth and infrastructure and somehow did not bestow this on other players? Other groups have exactly the same ability to build titans and create empires, but that would take work, so they, and you, cry to CCP to take away what goons have instead.
---
imagine if you would unlock cruises too while training them, as you would if you were training for an arty blap nado, a structure bash oracle, or any other of the BS platform battlecruisers.
---
Yeah it's cool, but imagine if you didn't have this stupid system in place? You aren't "gaining" because "oh cool stealth bombers" you are still losing out here
---
I did not mention, that this citadel is not in my Corp...which picture are you hovering you over?
---
He doesn't want to see the world burn, he wants to see Delve burn. He just cloaks his desires with moral superiority by claiming to be against botting. If he were, he'd have moved to PANFAM space when the pie chart dropped.
---
Let's try that sentence again...the Citadel is not in my Corp, if that makes a difference.  And what picture are you hovering over?   Thanks!
---
How do I get this? sign up for amazon prime?
---
I mean not really. You and the rest of the butthurt grr gon brigade downvote everything you don't like into oblivion to make this place an echo chamber.

I linked the wrong account 🙃

Thanks for reminding. Gotta watch again, will never get old.
---
Quality tear post. Link your lossmail
---
isnt a lot of cosmos broken - expect CCP forgets about it on purpose
---
There isn't a way to see when someone else's citadels are finishing unanchoring
---
Yeer. My thoughts exactly, the whole style reminds me of the other 'movies' made in gmod.
---
I guess a Titan basically decloaks everything.
---
Tomalak... mate that vid was oddly calming - I just sat there smiling the whole time whilst feeling a wave of peacefulness overcome me... super odd...
---
Kaas
---
&gt;  wealth and infrastructure and somehow did not bestow this on other players? 
---
Yes. If it wasn't possible to fit 50k players under the same umbrella, if there were counters to umbrella mechanics, if Rorquals weren't this much multiboxable, etc. Goons wouldn't have their 800 (or more) to 350 titan lead today.
---
I had this conversation tens of times. I talked about it in the video. I hate that each random Goon makes me repeat myself. But here is how it goes. Right after Rorqual changes, the game was going to catapult the first alliance with the biggest regional umbrella and willingness to recruit any mouthbreather to supremacy. North didn't want to non-selectively recruit. TEST didn't have that strong an initial umbrella. So it was Goons. But just because they were able to exploit broken mechanics the best, it doesn't mean the mechanics aren't broken. And just because I argue against broken mechanics, it doesn't mean I hate Goons.
---
Mittens and co brainwash you folks like I hate Goons, want to see it burn, go for CSM for that purpose, etc. In fact, I'm a whaler. My best interest is the thriving of the region I hunt in, so that there are many whales, so that I get more kills and fun. I'm not some dude who wants to collapse Goons. I don't play that kind of politics So how about you folks
---
100% agree. a million sp for being on the internet once a day.
---
I too went on vacation but I can read and add so I just RDP'd into my PC like a normal person.
---
hey, no damage caps on pocos at least.
---
Oh hey that came out.
---
And when you say last, as in last ever or just latest?
---
Agreed. I don't get the allergy with "lootboxex". What matters is what's inside. 
---
And the issue isn't p2w. If "Golden Ammo" lootboxes is p2w, then so is Omega Status or injectors. Game literally gives you t2 ammo only with Omega.
---
What matters is that Eve has a unique feature. Items of consequence, ships, modules etc either are produced, or are obtained from the game environment by effort. If you but them into lootboxes for $, you take away that effort which in fact makes Eve universe lively. If the people running missions, DED sites, Abyss, mining anoms etc found those items in lootboxes/market, you'll kill that livelyhood and consequently the vibrant universe. That's why my red line about stuff for $ is PLEX/extractors/anything cosmetic. CCP should find better cosmetic ways. There are tons of ideas circling around.
---
This is bait.
---
Drifters are top dogs in WHs.
---
Thank you. I had quit eve before part 3 and never knew it existed.
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
I still get excited when I get to work with a titan
---
Oh man. I forgot about Clear Skies... 
---
That was good.
---
No one. Some guy called Brisc Rubal defeated them all.
---
The comment replying is something you'd classify as surreal local meltdown. When I explain the logic behind it people get where it comes from, and how it's right. 
---
You talk about non-Goons' opinion. Your internal comms is a horrible echo chamber. Your INN functions like Fox News with obnoxious people spreading erronous perspectives. Just maybe, you're the one drinking the koolaid.
---
This scene is why my second titan had to be a leviathan :D
---
Every place Olmeca was, turned into drama. Everything Olmeca touched, turned into Drama. When there is a place to recycle Olmeca Gold, then it is him being a CSM. Give him your vote vs 30.000 other votes, feed his need for attention and drama, support his Dunning Kruger Effect. He will burn out like a candle in the wind, after he realizes that his white knight attitude has no impact onto the greater thing.
---
Therefore, oppressed people of New Eden, vote for Olmeca Gold ! You need that man, he will build a wall around Delve, and he will make New Eden great again. If not great, atleast he will turn it into Drama. Like he was doing it with Bombers Bar, and many other places!
---
The necessity of logging in every day was fucking bullshit, especially since I was on vacation for the last ten days.

Lol why is it always like 20 Goon guys trashtalking anything about me under everyone's comment.

---
I really, *really* don't like this 'log in every day to claim shit' thing a lot of games have been doing for the last few years. Yeah, I get that it's a ploy to look good to investors who don't actually know shit about how the game works, but if you have shit to do on those days, well fuck you.
---
I happened to be on vacation during the 'event' so I missed out on half the stuff. lol oh well
---
You need to be more clear and concise about what it is you want or are campaigning for. 
---
You're all over the place, you drown yourself out in noise.

At the end of the day it's grr goons and 'change' which resonates with enough people to develop a following.

---
I feel like I just listened to the unfettered ramblings of a cult leader. Olmeca is exactly the kind of person we do not want on the CSM. A wannabe game developer with an out of touch handle on the situation. It would be an absurd waste of everybodies time to have to sit and listen to his incoherent psycho babble during the CSM process. I cannot see how he could be productive.
---
The only way this whacko is getting a seat, is if Goons vote him in for the meta.

Well... like I said it wasn't perfect system. But that is the price you have to pay.

One of my first memories in game was coming across a gate camping Nyx in 2006, which could be used with impunity in low-sec back then, as HICs didn’t exist.

There were [PL Snowflakes](https://zkillboard.com/kill/22820807/) gate camping in titans in 2012, which “[militia noobs](https://youtu.be/2U0dTlU-QUg)” all had to band together to destroy 😉

If you ignore the root of my my point then  your comment makes sense. Fortunately for my point I already addressed this. Is he capable of listening to someone in an objective fashion and ignoring a guild tag in the process? At the end of the day - the point is what matters. The, as you tried to put it, ideas and values.

It's not a hard concept. Keep up.

Lots of angry down voting goons around here. Yet.. seems fitting I guess?

Thank you. Will download the .exe version. I suspect the problem is with the WinZip version.

To clarify, I actually had a really old version of the .exe on my computer already.  I downloaded the winzip because I forgot I had that.  I then remembered and updated the old .exe and that updated version is what worked.

Are you talking about the daily login campaign where they gave you Glamourex boosters, cool skins, a monocle, and free skillpoints galore? The one where you had to log in for literally 10 seconds to collect your rewards? 
---
Jeez OP, there’s no pleasing some people. They could’ve given us another bullshit loot box grind event or literally nothing at all.
---
At this point idk why you think I would take your feedback seriously but thanks.
---
i laughed at this
---
Lootboxes are different from cash shops. What we have now is a cash shop. You see a skin, it says 500 PLEX, I know that 500 PLEX is whatever quantity of my currency. What I see on the tin is what I get.
---
Lootboxes are driven by random chance. They're designed like slot machines with bright colors, usually with rolling animations, and celebratory sounds. They are engineered to give you a hit of dopamine, and in a way that we are hardwired to become unhealthily addicted to.
---
I'm glad that we're on the same page with cash shops - I too don't mind and even welcome cosmetics and omega time being there. I don't think that's a big issue. But lootboxes are different and they're designed to get a different reaction from players. If CCP can build a slot machine into the game, then bring back Somer Blink and IWI while you're at it. But as it stands today they don't belong in EVE.
---
Anyone know why hecates jumped up in price recently?
---
I think rolling for cosmetics would be fine. As long as the ecosystem isn't harmed we should be happy someone is willing to pay CCP for it.
---
What you are worried about is a larger issue and if there is any action about it, it should be at government policy level. Because right now idk why while Dota thrives on lootboxes CCP shouldn't. If it's bad for addictive reasons then governments shouldn't let neither of them to do it.
---
Since kind of in sync with the Minecraft 1.14 update “Village and Pillage” title also seems fitting here. With it being an empire building/economic type war.
---
MOM?
---
The reason I liked the other events is because it gave me something worth ninja looting and generally being a butthole over in high sec. That was what made the frostline event the best for me.
---
Na, they get farmed pretty hard
---
From what I've been reading it's illegal in parts of Scandinavia, being considered for a ban in the EU, might be illegal in China already, and is a candidate for illegality in the US. I don't discount the "if they can do it why can't I" reasoning.
---
^^you missed Ishtar, and the man is shooting Gurista rats so make sure you are doing kinetic damage as your primary DPS
---
Sansha should drop like 20 ~~corn-filled turds~~ Revenants on the World Ark.  THAT would be an event worth all of the reeeee hype.
---
I'm agreeing with him, but he's not wrong.
---
And if it's a bug, expect it to be fixed in about 5 years.
---
Wow someone else who remembers cosmos missions exist. I wrote about how shitty they were back in [2015](http://www.lowseclifestyle.com/2015/02/guest-blog-cosmic-travesty-or-why.html). Now I feel old.   
---
It's going to take a lot more than including them in the agency to fix them, but it would be a nice start.
---
I didn't think this sub gave a shit about anything but nullsec politics.
---
Use protection, they spew GALLONS when they ejaculate.
---
I started 3 days before the new agency, and with the new one its so easy to figure out what i want to do next, i love it.
---
This is dad, sorry
---
Is having a weeb tolerant culture mandatory or a requirement for you?
---
They’ll probably make trig invasions pay out LP when they’re finished messing with them
---
Just listened to the Venal narrative. I wish I didn't sell my characters. And my Alpha just went Omega. So, kind of hate this dude for that, but thems the breaks.
---
Ah, Wolfsbrigade. Fond old memories :)
---
So you want to deny him logging in "hundreds of campers" has no affect on the game? Sure buddy sure
---
nice thanks
---
Inundated with the 10 billion j4gs whose drooling slobber threatens the last of the TRVE GOONS with drowning.
---
Pretty much all ships will experience price fluctuations. Could be due to somebody buying them all up, could be due to a decreasing supply. Usually both when it comes to tech 3s.
---
A lot of the clone mechanics have been changed. You no longer have to upgrade your clone to avoid SP loss, if that’s what you mean.
---
not a handy comment
---
Who said anything about majority?  5% is enough to be considered statistically significant.
---
"My Sofa!"
---
I did login over 16 days. On the 15th day it said 2 days left to claim prizes. Next day it said 14 hours left but I had 16 left before I could claim.  You really should check your confidence because you're not playing with a full deck of cards.
---
&gt; saying kek ~~in 2019~~ ever
---
The launcher saying 2 days left to claim prizes when I claimed the 15th prize, and then the next day I only had 14 hours left with a 16 hour timer.  I'm assuming you're one of those losers that would have logged in everyday regardless because your life sucks and you have nothing better to do.  Otherwise you may have paid attention to that message every time you logged in.
---
Here is the wormhole leaderboard. It’s not perfect but it has most of the big names.
---
https://eve-tracker.org/whkills
---
I've just re-listened to EoE for like the 3rd time. Can't wait for the second one to be out. It's so close!
---
As some folks have said, it can be very hard to catch bots with a retribution, but it is fine for killing them. Most bots don't even fight back when caught. If you have access to an alt then a retri + dictor is a great combo. Find their site, warp to their citadel or POS at 100 from the site and log off. Log back in, drop bubble and likely catch them as they land for an easy kill.
---
sansha incursions end with a mothership site (aka 'mom') where you shoot a Revenant.
---
Event was still shit, and the feedback they requested had no place to tell them it was shit.  What exactly is the point you're trying to make?
---
Top dogs right now are probably Hawks, though there’s a fair few active groups (off the top of my head, POSPY, WHSOC, TDSIN, SOUND, PGGB, EPSYN, MCAV, Singularity Syndicate, Wrong Hole, NOVAC), others have linked the leaderboard which has a decent list of active corps.
---
If you want to move to WHs then either C4 or C5 space is the most active, C4s tend to be more laid back, with less capitals, C5s are a little more hardcore.
---
Thanks. Knew nothing about them sure to enjoy!
---
T2 variants tend to fit tank in the lows, plate + Ancil is pretty common.
---
they want to know my credit card .... yeah right for sure they get the info ........
---
It a hell of a lot cheaper than having to replace that titan + fit.
---
I ate these up when they came out.  I realize Andrew is now 100% focused on the new book, but these were a great taste of the beginning of the first book.  All they needed were history channel reenactments and slow pans over relevant still Images for the full documentary effect.
---
&gt;If "Golden Ammo" lootboxes is p2w, then so is Omega Status or injectors. Game literally gives you t2 ammo only with Omega.
---
This isn't quite the same though. Golden Ammo is generally referring to the ammo you get in World of Tanks for real-world cash, and said ammo is strictly *better* in every respect than standard ammo - take any two players with the same level of skill and ability (map knowledge, game knowledge, reaction time, etc.) and the tank with golden ammo will outperform standard ammo 100% of the time.
---
Omega status is not P2W because *EVE Online is a subscription-based game*. Alpha clones are a mechanically limited trial, sure, but if you take two players with the same level of skill and ability, put them in two identical clones, and two identically fit ships, with the only difference being whether one has Omega and one does not, it'll be a pretty fair fight. T2 ammo, T2 ships, all the stuff that having Omega - or injecting skills - grants you access to does not result in you winning at everything forever, nor does it even guarantee a win in a hypothetical, perfectly balanced duel.
---
With the ever changing nature of WHs, arranged fights aren’t really a thing - usually group A rolls into Group B, both send out a ping and have a fight (or one side rolls the other off because krabs).
---
:wut:
---
A normal smallgang will rarely have &gt;4-5k dps even with a Leshak, breaking a carrier in 30s would require over 30k dps.
---
Leshak for PVE? Drone lands ?
---
Gambling will never exist in EVE so long as you can convert $$$ to ISK. Too much legal and PR liability what with the CS:GO shit and various other "gambling for ingame items" sorts of things.
---
The only way gambling in EVE could possibly exist is if it was tied to a currency which is only used for that single purpose, cannot be obtained by *any* conversion of real money directly to it, and cannot be transferred between players *except* by playing poker or whatever.
---
After the eviction of HK I doubt anyone is gonna step up and claim any sort of "we rule wormholes' mantel.

Drifter Wormhole rats vs Sansha Incursion rats (with the modern NPC AI rework) vs Triglavian vs Capsuleer Incursion Armor fleet, on the same grid in a 4 way free for all. 4 go in 1 comes out.
---
There are a lot of dummies on this subreddit, but you might be the dumbest if you thinks goons currently or have ever given a shit about killboards. Notice how goon idiots that die repeatedly in shiny shit never get booted, unlike panfam idiots. Panfam is so tryhard about killboards they have people drop corp before losing a super to protect the precious killboard. Pathetic beyond words.
---
For what reason they are broken? I did few over the last few days, as I never did them before, and I heard they could be removed.
---
That's huge pants upside down
---
I agree with your title.
---
I have lived in WHs, HS and 0.0 - the game has had so much power creep and dumbing down.
---
Chimera will work but it's not the best carrier for ratting. It doesn't really compare to ratting with Geckos because you have to manually assign your fighters to the rats.
---
Maybe you can practice a bit on Sisi (testserver). For optimal ticks you need to find an optimal order in which you kill the rats, keeping in mind that you have the rocket salvo on your fighters to finish off enemies so the guns don't need to cycle again.
---
This.
---
I "upgraded" from a VNI to this Gila ratting fit. My survivability is fine, but my missile damage feels like shit. I'm in Sansha rat space. Am I missing something? I'm doing Forsaken hubs. Should I go against the ships bonus and use Mjolnir's?

Losing a titan that was piloted by an idiot who didn't bother to deploy doesn't affect the alliance. Losing literally all of your infrastructure does. 
---
But either way, the real reward of this war has been the endless sea of tears and downvotes. "Didn't want that everything anyway"
---
They stream assets to your client as you ask for them. There is an option in the launcher somewhere to download all assets. That might help.
---
Matteral ideas about what the game needs is ... eh ... let's just say the word "industry" is inside it and not in a negative way.

I would love to see a quick summary of all the interviews so they are easier to compare and contrast over the questions posed.
---
Lmao it's literally "Didn't want that region anyway". The cope is real.
---
Oï !
---
Your fit looks alright, at least for me. As a Gila pilot, your main source of damage come from your two bonuses drones, as the role bonus of your ship give them the damage of twelve medium drones. Your missile damage might looks bad because of your skills. If you’re sure you don’t have any problems coming from your skills, then you might want to look at your lowslots : three DDAs is a strong option, as it’s what will give you the best return on your DPS by boosting your drone’s damage. However, if you want stronger missiles, you might want to drop one of the DDA and take a BCU instead. Or if you’re willing to bling it a bit, try to buy a C3-X BCU, as it boost both missiles’ and drones’ damage.
---
Hope this help !
---
Let them fight... let the npc fight each other
---
Latest, hopefully. I really enjoyed it.
---
Just make sure you have fully landed before telling them to return or they will end up miles off.
---
I watch these at least once a year, highly recommend to everyone. So brilliant.  It's got genuinely lovable &amp; enjoyable characters, with a plot that does not let you down.
---
PLAN "B" !!!!
---
Was Hard Knocks but I think something happened to them.
---
Your entire statement ignores one of the biggest fundamentals of cloaking camping. Cloaky campers do not have to decloak unless they are in a position where they know they will win.  
---
You talk about risks with cloaking camping in terms of "you can blap them" but cloaky campers don't decloak unless the fight is already won, its one of the most risk adverse ways to play the game.  
---
There is a reason that the most common response to people who call for nerfs to cloaky camping is "get a competent defence fleet", its because that is one of the only consistent ways to defend against a cloaky camper when said cloaky camper is smart and only takes fights they can win is through defensive fleets. To suggest nerfing defensive fleets is to advocate for making cloaky camping 100% risk adverse and by extention is to advocate for more risk free gameplay.  
---
Also, I didnt even specifically target my statement towards cloaky camping, it was directed at hunting in general.
---
Very nice. Very very nice.
---
&gt; The risk hunters take is entirely emergent. You can blap them, you can make it hell for them, or you can die.   
---
Cloaky campers dont have to decloak if the fight they are getting into looks like a fight they wont win, unless the cloaky camper is dumb and doesnt know how to pick their fights, cloaky camping is almost 100% risk adverse.
---
with online of 40000 at best, in the game where 1/2 are bots , almost anyone has 2 accounts and single player could simultaneously use 10+ accounts for mining , there is maybe 5000 real people online at best ? across the world. And most of them are extremely autistic .
---
PanFam paws up and roll over war
---
Like I said, I don't think it's going to get you what you want. I think you're suffering from false nostalgia - by the end of the pre-Phoebe era, the good moons had long been sniffed out and were 99% owned by panfam/goonswarm, reflecting their sov duopoloy for exactly the same reasons we have a space duopoloy.
---
Now we have another sov duo/triopoloy (increasingly tending towards a monopoly, many would say), but the bloc owners don't generally bother with moons more than 1 cap jump outside their borders because it's not worth the risk and effort of deploying rorqs. You're proposing to remove that effort/risk barrier.
---
Well, duh. CCP don't want any negative feedback because then they'd get a realistic view of how well they're doing and because rose tinted spectacles make the world a much.... rosier... place.
---
That said, what exactly are your negative comments? As far as I can tell it was simply a case of log in and get free stuff. I'm not really sure there is anything negative to say about it other than whining about not being able to log in every day or that the free stuff wasn't exactly what you wanted, both of which should really be responded to with "boo hoo for you".
---
[removed]
---
Or you know, DON'T STORE EVERYTHING YOU OWN IN A CITADEL!!!!!! If you can't handle the risk of losing a titan or super while you are away for a few days, guess what? DON'T OWN ONE!
---
&gt;Faction ammo is not that good now. You can always enable distribution of those unpublished Advanced Tech 2 ammo (Lux, Blaze etc) for a great reward tier instead.
---
I wish they'd have given us meaningful quantities of faction ammo. Now I just have a bunch of microstacks of ammo that I dont regularly see employed. 1k of each so I can go welp a ship with "shiny" ammo. Faction missiles will always be decent as things currently stand. I agree with the rest of your sentiments.
---
Maybe they are just tuning incursions down during the invasion? Lore wise Sansah seems to be ready to attack them too after all, so that could explain them stopping their incursions to prepare for the invaders
---
So youre saying you all 'have' to look less literate than a third grader?
---
i think you might want to re-read your smart ass comment pal. 
---
fucking hell xD
---
It is another one of those comma users!
---
So, according to statistics, you are either a bot or autistic ?
---
I love this feature. It makes it so much easier to move my pod around.
---
Out of all PVE carebearing activities incursions are one of the ones I wouldn't nerf the availability of.
---
  
---
Pay out is reasonable, you have to fleet with real people, sit in comms and actually work together.
---
 As opposed to infinitely spawning Anoms, I'd much rather see infinitely spawning Incursions HQ's. It's lame to have hundred dudes wanting to fleet when content simply isn't anywhere to be found.
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/
---
No you don't need to insure your clone. That has been gone since well before 2015 I believe.
---
Plex system really isn't much different. 1 old plex = 500 plex now. You can also use plex to buy things from the store like ship skins, extractors and injectors (those are new).
---
The same theran alliance that, while party of frt,  announced they were renting out esoteria last summer. Sgeine only had a partial grip on reality.
---
Yeah... And when I reached 2 years of playing I simply didn't have the money for a super. So imagine a Titan. furthermore, Titans requires different skills, and a shit ton of them... Remember that you're flying a 50+ B ship (Hull) so you will want it to shoot right,tank right, so will be fitted right... All of these things requires game knowledge as well... I don't believe there's a "newbie" Titan pilot (apart from goonswarm ofc)
---
Was looking for this kind of stuff. Keep doing !
---
Saving for a capital alt?
---
Like, why not just start training today dude?
---
VNI-&gt;Rattlesnake-&gt;Carrier  
---

---
VNI is king in ISK/h/price tag.  
---
A Rattle can run DED´s. Until you can use a carrier.
---
Heh, I was the main in cyno for the hics. Had to refit just before undocking as the ship I got handed only had small smartbombs fitted, and no way I was going to be sitting next to the smartbombing titan using those! Civ gun for the win!
---
incorrect. 
---
ive never said goons are loosing or going to loose this war, you seem to be just another imperium douche bag insistent on concentrating on the needless parts, and making stuff up.
---
im saying, that goonswarm have killed many structures. however, it has not come without a great loss in total.
---
* Moving
---
* losses at home
---
* getting absolutely shrekt on grid loosing 100? 150? bill in subcaps.
---
* considering goons live by 'making money is king' for them to now be making like 100's of billion less a day because of deployment.
---
thats all ive fucking said xD. goons just like sheep hon hon'ing to be against anything non  goon, and if they dont understand whats said, they get ultra defensive.
---
i dont know what goonswarm leadership is pinging, or saying Panfam are doing, or what kind of bullshit AAR's they give, but its got to be something really fucking sky high on the idiotic scale.
---
&gt; It's a hell of a lot cheaper than having to replace that titan + fit.
---
Yes, EXCEPT that it's an isk sink (got that one going). And then you still are in a station that is most likely camped for titans/supers etc. And finally, the alternative is not "losing a titan" but maybe losing a titan. 
---
Not every titan that is asset safety'ed to lowsec would have been lost. Actually, I think that usually less than 15% gets destroyed if evacuated like in the old days. 
---
The last 2 evac moves that actually got caught, were able to safe more than 70-80% of the ships. And both GOT CAUGHT! Countless other evacs never get caught and come out with ZERO losses.
---
Asset safety gives ppl a COSTLY but low risk Out from bad situations. Yes, it's less content for other players, but cost-wise it's definitely not worse. 
---
Plus: Isk sinks are always good. (Building new Titans is a very small isk sink)
---
SPOILERS!
---
No. Eve is dangerous.
---
These are the kind of people Stewart Lee wishes would stay at home
---
Lmao
---
This reminds me to go and check my R&amp;D agents that i started to work with years and years ago.
---
Circle agents?      
---
Whats that?
---
Ah unified resist profile like in drones - no matter with what just the raw dps is important.
---
I was confident enough to get all the rewards over 2 omega and 3 alpha accounts.
---
Cool!
---
Sounds to me like they caused you to have fun, and in an Eve-y way too! 
---
This sickens me, thank Bob we now have simple none undocking ways to show high user numbers to the new PA overlords.
---
Still a small fee to have your titan stored safely for you untill you need it again.
---
Lying?! You trying to get a job at CCP or something?
---
Its hotdrooop aclooooock
---
DOESNT COUNT THEY HAVE SRP YOU IDIOT
---
The models/characters are from GMOD (halflife), but i'm not sure if they actually used GMOD to do it all? The game/program does have face-animation for voice actors, so its possible it was all done in Gmod.
---
You have like 2 active groups that do stuff, and then like 15 shitty groups that don't do stuff (other than rolling out anyone that does stuff). In terms of finding content, wormholes a really quiet these days, so it's real hit or miss. There's still some stuff out there, but people mostly roll for the same couple groups to fight, killing the odd 70 iq ratter along the way.
---
TVP is dead
---
The unachor time on citadels is 7 days from the moment you start the clock. What most people tend to do is start the clock, wait a day or two till they find a quiet spell when no one is around (perhaps in a different TZ), and then quietly cancel and restart the unanchor.
---
That way it's difficult for potential thieves who want to steal the citadel from seeing what time it actually unanchors.
---
The reinforcement timer shows you when the structure has it's final reinforcement timer set to. As unanchoring structures are treated the same as low power ones, it will generate the final timer and will aim for a time +/- 2 hours from the next Wednesday 0800 (as long as the next Wednesday is more than 2 days away, otherwise it will go to the Wednesday after). Reinforcing of course pauses the unanchoring.
---
preach it
---
The problem is he DOES want to do the survey, there is just nowhere on it for him to put his opinion.
---
A bit autistic yes. Also i play eve 1-3 months a year, unsubbed atm. mostly because new patch\\ being in recovery (had a series surgeries for the last 2 years, and needed to stay at home for recovery ) , but i can't say my condition is common .
---
Not full autist tho, because i play just with 1 acc and i just can't gring shit more than few hours at best.
---
Normies are also present for sure, but rare
---
content generation? you guys in PL were once really good at it
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Nani ?
---
this. all these rookies don't know what they are missing :( i want a rollback
---
I'm seeing a lot of people using glass canon hecates recently, could be that.
---
how do you come up with eve dying now? there was no mention of it in the comment chain you are replying to.
---
strawman
---
thanks :3
---
one of the worst expansions ever and most uninspiring gifts since i bought my mom flowers from the gas station. great fucks given
---
It’s jita \o/
---
I am puzzled here, what did they change about NSA? I remember in the old days even fleet supers have them installed and I haven't played since then
---
this is not what it's about. people might not have enjoyed the event (many that did get all the SP didn't) and there is no way to communicate that to CCP. they know their event was shit and did this on purpose.
---
&lt;3
---
you are not a normal person if you leave your PC running over the vacation to claim 1m sp over 16 days....
---
Seriously?
---
it's not free if i have to login.
---
I mean, if you think about it, agencies find stuff for you, whether it's work or housing etc... And this agency finds content for you, so it makes sense to me
---
most people are missing the point here:
---
CCP commodifying their loyal and paying customer base.
---
it's so insulting, i can't even.
---
also please stop calling it a "gift". It's no gift if you have to do something for it.
---
do you use the steam version?
---
that's tje only thing that comes to mind right now.
---
TBH it still won't take any alpha.
---
For sure fleet that's under 50 ppl they might survive but 50+ they really struggle.
---
what? there is a ton of in-between.
---
wtf is going on with the playerbase...dumbing down every year
---
it's not free
---
mowing my lawn doesn't sound like a lot of work. but it still is.
---
that's not his point. his point is, that it's not a gift, if you have to do anything for it. he is right about that.
---
:)
---
That is why I stay they "Can" die very rapidly.    
---
If you are good enough you will survive maybe multiple time but the risk is still there.     
---
I won't count on new player's ability to pay attention to the situation, when they have not even learned how to anchor. I do agree with you that it is a good exercise for new players, and a good lesson to learn how to pilot low ehp ships :)
---
"can you mow my lawn? i will even give you 10$ FOR FREE you ENTITLED FUCKHEAD"
---
unironic "git gud scrub" wow
---
Welcome to YouTube. Also, welcome to Eve. Neither of which will provide you with a pleasant experience.
---
A sansha and a triglavian walked in to a bar...
---
Ouch.
---
did you even read? that's not what the post is about.
---
lol you know that every bittervet got at least 20x the SP that every rookie got? you are dumb if you think this event made newbies "catch up". same goes for injectors btw.
---
the SP was free? i didn't get it...
---
why would you release a feedback form with no place for negativity that's not trolling
---
abstraction... you seem not capable of it
---
But as long as neither A or B have any intention beyond gudfites it's hardly a fight for survival for either group.
---
The random nature of WHs make actual arranged fights probably impossible, bar 2 groups living in the same hole. But those skirmishes, while fun, aren't exactly meaningful in any way.
---
If people enjoy that, that's nice. But i haven't had as much fun in EVE after the constant pressure in the drone regions since 2015 by lumpy until our final eviction from Cobalt Edge was finished.
---
:D you should move to china, you would fit right in
---
Great:) ...now what am I going to do with 14 twitter prime accounts :p
---
I was hoping someone would link it. It's great stuff
---
I would say nullsec is more predictable. Any neut in hisec could be after you but most aren't , while in nullsec you know for certain who your friends are and everyone else is a hostile by default.
---
But yeah, these days it's increasingly rare to get random people dropping by. It's either a large whaling fleet or wormholers.
---
Hey! I tinkered around your fit a bit, and I saw you are missing out on a lot of DPS not using four launchers. While I don't know your playstyle, it is possibiel to switch out the Heavy Missile Launchers for Heavy Assault Missile Launchers. You can switch them to four HAM Launchers with doing a bit of downgrading. This will obviously strip your range, but will deal a lot more DPS (on paper). 
---
Another reason you may not feel your Damage is application. Forsaken hubs have a lot of frigates, and you will not hit them so well with the launchers + Medium Drones. You can make the change and swich out the DVC to a Omnidirectional Tracking Link, or change your Launchers to Rapid Lght Missile Launchers. The last will obvoiusly cripple your reload time, but will make dealing with frigates way easier. 
---
Mjolnir missiles will probably not do you any better, because of the reasons mentioned above.
---
Here some alternatives:

So what is your alternative? go back to logged out Titan pilots again till you need them again? sounds about as bad.
---
The only thing I can think of if Structures would start dropping everything (or drops large quantities of large aka Titan sizes) is that the most powerful entity (currently goons) would just become even stronger. If NC. is defeated, they lose 30% of the titans which were not moved and logged off in time, which means, that simply the losing team (aka NC. in this example) would have EVEN LESS power to fight.
---
Yes, make stuff more dangerous and more costly. But STOP making the losing team worse off. Make it that it is possible to fight as hit'n'run or underdog doctrines can punch above their weight, at least a little bit.
---
paying your sub with plex is not a short terme objectif.  
---
IMO, a good medium setup could be :  
---
- 2 omega account, one is a SP farm, he almost pay for himself  
---
- with 6 PI caracter you can produce enouth for one plexed acount passively

don't try to actively earn 2.5b/month until you have access to high end PVE (munlibox C5/Rorq or super) or you will simply ragequit in 2 month

Hey, much as I love the salt, I'm not actually PL, best not waste that on me ok?
---
&gt; Because right now idk why while Dota thrives on lootboxes CCP shouldn't.
---
Dota is a free game.
---
If CCP wants to get rid of subscriptions and go full F2P, we can talk about random lootboxes or whatever. But as long as I'm giving them $100 a year they can fuck off with that shit.

I want to buy the Amazon Kindle version of the book Empires of Eve.
---
 [https://www.empiresofeve.com/](https://www.empiresofeve.com/) 
---
Opinions on the book? Does the kindle version contain images?
---
... missing checkboxes to hide contents, I am not intrested in
---
Wake on Lan lol, read a computer book sometime
---
I think I have no idea what your point is...
---
Can anyone explain how I connect my Twitch account with my Eve account? I don't get an option in the account settings. Thanks in advance!
---
It's a Amateur move to use your personal email for eve online. It's a game with spys, dictators and terrorists that have one goal, making your game experiance horrible. How can you not realize your email should not be traceable back to you...
---
How the F you not sell to your enemies? Because if I sell to everyone, and not just my contacts, I also sell to my enemies. Alts are ez to make, yknow? 
---
If I can have a virtual monopoly on just one of the goods used in making Fermionic Condensates, I can screw over everyone who wants to use a T2 ship. Same goes for quite a few R64s. This is not just "I don' sell to enemies", it's an economic blockade for resources and allowing larger alliances to fuck everyone even harder than they do now.
---
Is thet war?
---
So it would be "whoever got order up first will sell first"?  
---
And a huge supplier with a trillion cubic meters of shit will fuck over the small guys even harder?
---
You sir, are my hero.
---
&gt; PS. If anyone likes the sheet enough feel free to throw any amount of ISK my way. Honestly I never really feel like throwing my complex sheets behind paywalls because I like being able to let people be able to do things easier. But I do take commissions if a specific sheet is needed for something. ;)
---
You didn't include an ingame nick for people to throw ISK at you: Hyperion Kado
---
As above, your missile dps will be about 1/6th - 1/8th of your total dps as the bulk of it will come from drones. It's mostly used for killing smaller ships like frigs/destroyers while your drones take care of everything else.
---
Im so hyped for part 2 \o/
---
I did this quite effectively with just the boosher
---
its amazing for finding new PI planets. i used to have to select a system, then inspect each individual planet. now you can sort the planet type you want and it will show all the planets in scanning range. you click on a planet and it will show you its resources, one click more and you can see the heatmap on the planet's resource distribution.
---
Seems to be indeed some issue specific to winzip build. I've filed it in the repo, see [https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/1998](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/1998). Matplotlib is not loadable on that build which causes the menu item to be grayed out, a bit later I will try to find out what causes it.

I think people should know me by now with all the stupid loss stories I have posted

I like the use The Spiffing Brit YT icon. :)

now you showed them who's boss XD

Sorry, i'm a new player. But what are you viewing all these details in the screenshots on?
---
&gt; You didn't stash everything you own in a POS. You stash what's needed and what you can afford to lose.

just do that with your trillions upon trillions in assets?
---
what are you talking about? ...i can't even...
---
I think the dude who made it once said in an interview, that it was not GMOD but Source SDK.
---
He appeared to have been rather "uneasy" about that particular question.
---
sadly true. even the DED Proteus use drones over blaster
---
&gt; I also fit deadspace mods to assfrigs and T1 cruisers when I fight because, i can't outwit my opponent
---
Its also really out of date , no corps have been added for months
---
Stop playing then lol
---
how is it possible to be so incompetent that you lose a JF in eve 2019 and blame it on the "cut throat" mechanics.
---
oh i just saw your flair...that explains it...and the downvotes in the comment chain...
---
this. all was dandy until CCP tried to cater to casuals and now the old player retention is as bad as the new player one.
---
You need to do it while trying to redeem loot from twitch.

6 titans is enough for you to fight entire corps, provided you can get some rookies to fly tackle/ewar for you.

Holy shit is that BR messed up or did they legit drop 3 titans and a few supers into Frat territory and walk out?

Source SDK is the engine/platform that built Garry's Mod...

---
My point is you are naming someone, calling for them to be demoted or fired over a video game and that makes you a worthless piece of shit.
---
One little heads up here: when agressing flashys on Stations, they are able to dock up and reship into something bigger, and because you attacked them earlier, you'll have a limited engagement timer for 5 minutes that will carry on even if they switch ships. This is a common bait tactic, especially in front of big tradehubs like Jita.
---
I believe those are agents that offer a one-off mission and then they send you off to the next one in a chain... eventually ending up back at the original agent you started with. 
---
Nothing special though, iirc they are like standard level 1 distro missions. Did a few when I ran the SOE epic arc for the first time as there was one based in Hek.

It's comical to me that just because I'm calling out Goons' blatant hypocrisy on the topic of undocking, you think that means I'm a PanFam member. You realize people can disagree with your views on /r/Eve and also -not- be your enemy in game, right?

Apparently they are above subreddit law.

Any, it doesn't matter

You can use Google  Chrome. The jest is they didn't follow the rules. Had been told to follow rules. They said naw. And then died.
---
It didnt but if you couldn't fly a "ship you wanna fly" but could fly it after, and then another ship, or added T2 mods you need, it feels quite a bit different from "hey, I can now add 20% progress on that long-ass skill (or not even bother injecting the 1M)" 
---
Basically, woosh.
---
Caldari, closer to jita, and you can free deathclone yourself near jita.
---
guys, calm down it's just a rolling carrier
---
if i hae amazon prime only, will this work?
---
Yes doesn't matter. I go either caldari or gallenta since its close to trade hubs
---
At least for some alliances we all know and don't name here.
---
You obviously haven't gave this a listen.
---
How long did this take you hype? Shits thorough.
---
structure skins are so fucking common sense i dont get why its taken this fucking long. just like normal skin for ships. Free basic no brainers would be the pattern of all the different npc corps. MASSIVE isk and LP sink right there. Literally would turn mission running on its tits for isk making. And as someone who had loads of skins for the ships i used it would have been a massive isk sink. 
---
structure skins would have as well. I would have skinned ALL my logistics citadels and maby different skins for each one. 
---
But instead we gona get like 2 or 3 fucking skins per and they will drip one or 2 per a year like the idiots they seem to be at ccp.
---
Whichever tickles your fancy. It literally does not matter.
---
Surely that would be Caldari or Amarr?
---
Or everyone except you, you pussy ass
---
You can train any skill regardless of faction you start out with. Pick one that sounds cool to you and go from there.
---
There is a corporation filter....
---
i've heard the dude was gonna had some newer corp, but no eta :(
---
Or the middle. Gal.
---
What matters is the fact they act the exact same way slot machines do. 
---
That gambling addict mentality will kick in, except now **if** they won they don't make that money back.

The fact a very common addiction goes over your head is a telling sign.

&gt;For the discipline of the alliance, directly kill the monkey police chicken
---
The only one with an objective downside is Amarr, as their corvette cannot hold enough ozone to light a cyno at cyno IV. 
---
I'm sure you have no idea what that means right now. It's just something that can be a minor annoyance later on and that you'll never be able to change without making a new character.
---
The only one with an objective upside is Caldari, because their starter stations that you can always go back to from anywhere are very close to the game's major trade system, Jita.

pve is a game of three outcomes.  1) nobody bothers you and you are fine.  2) someone catches you but you light a cyno and bring in super friends.  3) you die.  
---
There are no good fights.  If you get caught, you are dead.  Pvpers know exactly if / when they will win and rarely take fights that they have a chance to lose.  Pvers know this and either dock up whenvever a neut enters the region or rely on their umbrella to protect them.
---
They're most likely gonna be DED LP though, not CONCORD LP
---
Can't warp or jump with NSA on.
---
The first two points were valid though and you asked why the trash talk. 
---
How can you expect the player base to trust you to represent **their** interests when you dismiss feedback and then make it personal?
---
Do you want someone who doesn't grasp the basics of gambling addiction or game mechanics that are illegal in various parts of the world?

There's a lot of dumb in this thread in general from both sides

Frankly, out of most of the things I read on here, that makes a lot more sense

and a higher crime rate /jk

Exactly, and that have tied bonus payments to key numbers. Hilmar will only get the full price if he reaches them.

Read a bit of lore and do which sound the best.

You can train into any races ships so it doesnt matter.

Caldari, Megacorporations rule over effectively slave labour.

Gallente, Freedom loving hippies

Amarr, Slave Trading religious zealots.

Minmatar, Ex slaves of the Amarr they fought for their freedom using ships made out of duct tape, rust, and dreams.

Amazon prime is twitch prime you just have to link your Amazon account to your Twitch account
---
It is like always, the design team realy excels at its job, delivering great stuff for user experience. If just the people that are responsible for overall balance would deliver the same quality and not implement game-breaking features that are really well suited for botting (like the new signature preview)
---
My cavalry ravens... :(
---
Caldari to start but this literally only affects your starting skills. You can train into any ships you want immediately after. 
---
In which case try to decide which race style interest you more. Shield vs armor tanks. Missiles vs lazors vs blasters vs drones as a weapon system.
---
For pve Caldari is still probably the best choice. The only race I don't recommend for pve is Amarr,
---
EVE is 16 years old. For 13 of those years we didn't have anywhere near the level of safety in nullsec that we have now, and wow the game worked even better. People lived in null. People mined in null. People fought in null. From small groups all the way up to mega alliances with tons of cooperation. From small skirmishes all the way up to B-R. 
---
Your fear mongering about going back to that level of risk is completely baseless.
---
Not stain the region but stain the guy
---
Yikes, you aren't wrong
---
what? If you think it's either 10bil vs 70bil, you obviously have no idea...
---
It's 10bil for sure and a 10% chance to pay 70bil. Because most evacs get away, and even those who get caught can save a significant part of their fleet. It's NEVER a 100% chance to lose a ship.
---
If you have Amazon prime you have twitch prime, just link your account
---
From what I gather from that forum post it was due to repeatedly violating mining rules?
---
Forget them, Exploration site overhaul a few years ago killed them.
---
Before that I made about 400 Mio ISK per month with 12 (!) R&amp;D Agents. They could not let this huge passive income remain and made you play hacking minigames instead, that you can do while your tabbed out Rorqual "actively" mines that 400 Mio ISK in 1 hour on a sufficient Moon.
---
Are you too poor to go to Russia to save money? Pleb
---
About 2 weeks of on off work/fixing the occasional bug
---
That confirms my hypothesis that it was all staged by British eve players to achieve cheaper plex prices.
---
Skill wise it's much easier to get in 2 Barghests than 1 Dread. Also there's the much cheaper option of doing it in FOF Ravens. Slower, but half the price tag, so there's a clear upgrade path. And you can do the sites essentially AFK.
---
You'll be able to train into any faction you want. When creating my character I just read the descriptions of the factions and bloodlines and picked the one that sounded the coolest.
---
Well, VAT from the purchase should (and I will assume it does) go to the specific country.
---
I actually forgot about them.       
---
When i started to play my first home in higsec was Silen (damn remember this name after all those years) and agent is running those ... i think CCP once reset the agents years ago due to some changes ... i wonder how many points i have.
---
Nah sometimes they are fun. 
---
There is one agent that let you grind max ytri standings using like 100 dectryptors.     
---
You just give this mission over and over - stumbled on this accidentally.        
---

---
Wormholes are the best for more smaller scale warfare, where the soft cap of mass mechanics will teach you to get the most out of how little you have.
---
When I looked lately it was several 10k LP per agent
---
Can you pastebin the text?      
---
TY
---
You've never been in a wormhole, have you?
---
i think one unit cost like 50 lp or i am wrong ?
---
You're acting like PA has no insight into user retention. They run pretty successful games already and probably aren't gonna be fooled by numbers pumped up by events, so how exactly does that fit into your theory that CCP is pulling one over on PA to get Hilmar a bonus? It doesn't make any goddamn sense but because it fits with the narrative that CCP is both incompetent and duplicitous people here eat it up.
---
Doesn't matter unless you care about the free corvettes used for cyno alts, in which case choose Gallente. If you're new you're a long way off caring about that however
---
This remind me about a thing 30years ago.
---
No difference except the look. 
---
Basically check what race looks best for you, also i think only amarr can wear hoods.
---
serial violations of krab law, I think cherry picking and waiting to start mining until the smaller belt was already mined out possibly. violators were warned, fined twice, then commissar'd
---
Latest (i hope). It's just my bad english that made it "last" (i hope again).
---
This game lets you cross-progress right from the get-go. So it's more a question of which faction to train into first than which faction to start with. That being said, starting close to a big Eve market (Caldari/Amarr) is a nice bonus.
---
As for PVE, I'd say focus training racial skills in this order:
---
 
---
1. Caldari: Missiles are great for PVE and you start close to Eve's biggest market, Jita
---
2. Gallente: Drones are also really excellent for PVE and you need Caldari and Gallente skills to train for the king of PVE cruisers, the Gila.
---
3. Amarr: Amarr market is Eve's 2nd market and Amarr and Gallente skills let you train into the awesome Sisters of Eve combat exploration ships.
---
4. Minmatar. Minmatar ships are slightly harder to train into but generally excel at (fleet) PVP.
---
spodpurge then!
---
aslong as it looked as cool as this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTwtZrtmOCU
---
First of all you pretty clearly don't know what a strawman is, you heard someone use it on the internet once and it sounded clever. You assume it meant "this person is making the argument about something I don't want it to be about" and never thought beyond that. 
---
The only reason CCP would need to artificially boost numbers in the way you're talking about is because Eve won't get people to come back on its own. The "Eve is dying" narrative has always been that people around here assume the worst because _obviously_ Eve is failing and _obviously_ CCP is barely holding it together and so _obviously_ they're gonna try anything to keep it going. 
---
Injectors were proof that Eve was dying and needed microtransactions to survive. Rorquals were proof that Eve was dying and needed overpowered isk printing ships to get people to stay. Every goddamn change or event is met with people here saying something like "well obviously Eve is shit so this is a trick to get us all to keep playing." It's exhausting to hear you all bitch and moan about a game you choose to play.

he Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx brings your roundup of the latest news from around New Eden as the Triglavian Collective escalates its operations to establish persistent conduits through space-time from the depths of Abyssal Deadspace into K-space itself
---
New Triglavian Strategy Emerges As Collective Establishes "Minor Conduits"
---
Yulai, Genesis – A new phase in the Triglavian invasion has developed in the last few days, with it becoming clear that the appearance of sites of space-time distortion across invasion zones is an effort to establish persistent "conduits" from Abyssal Deadspace into New Eden's known space. Triglavian messages heralding the appearance of the conduits were received by a number of capsuleers. CONCORD has designated the sites as "Minor Conduit" locations but the Triglavian Collective are maintaining significant forces at these sites, while continuing to roam across the systems within the invasion zones.
---
In an apparent change of strategy, the current invasion zones centered on Charmerout, Elonaya and Esescama have persisted for two days so far with no sign that the Triglavians intend to retreat as they generally did within 24 hours with their previous roaming scout operations. CONCORD sources continue to maintain that a strategy of "containment and defeat in detail" is the best method of combating the Triglavian threat. The Empires are continuing to establish co-operation protocols and a summit meeting hosted by the SoCt in FDZ4-A is continuing. Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall of the DED continues to co-ordinate CONCORD response efforts in space, with Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir of AEGIS responsible for planetary and installation defense operations.
---
&gt; During the gathering, Chairman Arteu explained that the new contract comes with the public disclosure of a new line of small arms designed by Upwell Consortium. In accordance with the needs of the AEGIS division, the weapons are engineered for ease of production utilizing standardized components and a familiar aesthetic as well as modular capabilities. Representatives would not go into detail about the destructive capabilities, citing AEGIS operational security, though those later noted that the weapons appeared to be capable of immense damage.
---
:thinking:
---
Good interview but I would like Olmeca to firm up his stance beyond increasing explosions. He has a really good line of thinking on balancing the ecosystem - and more explosions is pretty clearly a part of that - but when he is in the room with CCP they're gonna want to hear specifics. He has them, I'm not worried about that, more his ability to communicate them (which is the hard part for anyone). Quickly getting my vote though.

I dont know who you are, ive probably read some of those stories.

Always include the name if you put a donations note.
---
&gt; The only one with an objective downside is Amarr, as their corvette cannot hold enough ozone to light a cyno at cyno IV.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I'm sure you have no idea what that means right now. It's just something that can be a minor annoyance later on and that you'll never be able to change without making a new character.
---
But to be fair, lighting cynos in covops is something that is rarely done by "main characters", whatever that means these days.
---
This is what it must feel like to blob.
---
Warp drive.. Active.
---
That's why I said it's a very minor annoyance. Most of the time if you can buy a cyno you can also buy a t1 frigate or something.
---
But I do occasionally light Velator cynos on my main, so it would definitely be a downside for me.
---
there a discord?
---
Does this change the Triglavian invasions? Anyone at the invasion sites and confirm that this changes anything compared to what it was previously?
---
He was gatimg through systems. That's where we liked him. On a gate.
---
Nah its just animation whlie changing system by using gates.
---
There is 100% carebear friendly autism content in null. Infinite spawning anoms as far as the eye can see.
---
At least incursion promotes social interaction and fleeting up with your friends.
---
Pick whichever one's lore you like the most, and whichever has the characters that most appeal to you (each race has 3 bloodlines which each look different).
---
Then pick Caldari or Amarr cause you're not filth ;)   
---
(I hope it's obvious I picked Caldari and am a caldari/amarr loyalist).
---
(caldari/amarr are 'allied' against gallente/minmatar, but that doesn't matter unless you end up doing high level missions for the faction or do faction warfare).
---
Thats more accurate
---
In the bottom left corner you can bookmark agency windows that you want to use often, if that's what you're looking for
---
TY!
---
This is the program Pyfa. Google it :)
---
What PA "feels" when they look into user retention is pretty pointless. It only counts what was written down in the contract, and these are just isolated key numbers. If CCP reaches this numbers they fulfill the contract and get the extra payments bound to these numbers (if I remember right it was 50% of the 400 Mio $ tied to metrics).
---
Im voting for him/it regardless
---
Hmm this bring back memories.
---
This guy sounds scared of his own shadow. GL rooming with Goons CSMs.
---
Why you start posting with no clue and write nonsense? The deal is still ongoing, the contract is containing a 50/50 split of payments, with 50 % upfront and the other 50% are tied to key number metrics like subscribed accounts, PLEX sales and logged in account average.
---
Where are my fucking rigs war

Allow players to opt out of the killmail system (think WoW's opt in/out for world pvp, but with more restrictions), make jump drive travel non-instantaneous, and introduce pvp battlegrounds similar to those of other MMOs.

The downside is that you'll make many veteran players very angry and possibly cause some of them to quit, but they're a minority anyways, and catering to them murders your retention rate for newer players. Removing some of the incentive for vets to prey on newer players (plus some of the punishment that new players suffer from being preyed on), removing one of their most infamous methods of doing so (hotdropping), and introducing the abundant and relatively balanced content-on-demand of a pvp battleground system would more than compensate for the alienation of even a majority of the bittervets.
---
There's a difference between "you're never safe" and "you're never safe, plus the powers that be actively incentivize everyone to avoid far fights and force unfair fights as often as possible".
---
50k online within a year would totally be feasible.
---
So you think the contract is so poorly worded and enforced that CCP could game it with transient player bumps from events? You have no idea how any of this works. You're making it up and it shows.
---
I still remember when it was released, multiple Devs commenting on the thread.  And who didn’t send him 30 mil?  I downloaded all 3 many years ago.  True classics.
---
Pick which ever one has people that look the way you want to look. It's 100% cosmetic.
---
Currently working on it right now. 
---
All player presentations are slotted finalized, just waiting on confirmation from EVE North that they've all accepted.
---
CCP presentations are all confirmed too, just waiting on meeting with a couple of the presenters on Tuesday to finalize things as Monday is a national holiday in Iceland.
---
Megablog will be drafted Monday/Tuesday, and most likely released late Tuesday early Wednesday :)
---
What the fuck does that even mean?  Do you just assume everything you say is smart because you said it?  Fucking incel
---
Seems good to me. As I said my fit is specifically to deal with jaguars but with ab/scram/web you should have range control against most stuff in nullsec.
---
And you're trying to argue with on troll on the internet, which makes you retarded.
---
I tried SS fighters and they weren’t nearly as effective as normal fighters but that was before the changes.
---
"*Now* are we even?"
---
Cheers thanks o/
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I *need* the Baba O-Reilly CS remix...
---
You just assume you know what you're talking about because words sound familiar?
---
You either failed stats or never took it.
---
LOL.
---
I really miss our masive Tristán fleets. That shit was fun and we got some pretty nasty KM back in time. XD
---
everyone has been rolled out by at least one time.  
---
at this point gating until death seem ok to me
---
Wait you have 5 accounts?  How many actual friends do you have?  When's the last time you left the house for a social gathering that your family didnt make you go to?
---
If all you do is grinding then go to sleep.
---
Eve is shit these days, you have no idea how it was 2003-2007 .
---
No problem buddy
---
Enjoy this phase. The burnout phase and then the unacknowledged anger at not being as young as you used to be and this is 100% CCP's fault phase aren't as much fun.
---
The more you grind, the sooner this phase passes by. :)
---
I see my two cyclones weren't the only thing they dropped supers on last night
---
More boring with nothing to do?
---
(✿◕‿◕✿)love you guys, and i hope you all have an awesome weekend!(✿◕‿◕✿)
---
(✿◕‿◕✿)weather is actually good here in iceland atm so i'm gonna do some cooking with mah dude, and spend some time outside chilling! (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
Yes I know, global contracting in a 100-countries-plus IT company ... you just ranting and have no clue. The feeelings and sentiments of players that might just not have quit yet because of sunk-cost-fallacy is not something that gets written to a contract ...
---
WiS is back on the menu!!!!
---
D E L E T E  C 4
---
It's listed in the patch notes that the number of incursions will be lowered
---
Single handedly! What a chad
---
Keepstar = pants on head.
---
This explains all of nullsec.
---
Yea problem is I'm not sure if I will sleep
---
Damn really? It's fun as hell for me. Yesterday I just did a lot of running but I still got a massive adrenaline rush.
---
If you don't mind, what's CCP?
---
"All ships have been reverted to what they were before we made everything a rorqual"

nothing changes
---
The issue with lootboxes in other games is not the gambling aspect, it's when the gambling aspect is made a requirement in order to obtain the best gear.  That's when it gets out of hand. 
---
But there's never going to be pay-for lootboxes in this game anyway, so I don't know why folks think its a big deal.
---
One agent in the circle gave you faction standing - one time only
---
Minmatar if you want to be a black dude with dreads!  Also known as Winmatar
---
A well setup small gang can, and will kill carriers from time to time, not everyone is in some big NS bloc, I'm not sure EPSYN could field 200 characters, even with max rage ping with everyone multiboxing...
---
You will have to reset your sleep time, it will most likely take 3 days. Do some sport before, watch some youtube video rather than playing a bit before, should be good.
---
30 mins in a dread vs 90 mins in a botted unkillable barghest)
---
iirc one guy dominates t3 production, so anything could be him if there's no other apparent explanation
---
he could have forgot to deliver the hecates or something really
---
There was a time when you could do Guristas Forsaken Hubs in a Blaster Talos or Naga. I'm not sure if it's still doable or if it has been changed, maybe somebody could elaborate on that. If you want to do active ratting on a budget that might be an option for you which is not incredibly skill intensive.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

it's nice seeing the same regular faces doing 1v1 in fw and ~~getting trashed by them~~ learning a whole lot.
---
I am not knocking small gang activity, if it sounded like that. I rather enjoy taking out 8-12 dudes myself. More a statement of what has become the norm. Across 4-5 regions of intel all day I see reports of small gangs of 4-8 dudes as well as reports of various bomber groups or dreadbombs being set up. It is the norm to see 40-80k of dps drop on grid now. Big null blocs are also big juicy target rich environments for hunters.
---
The devil.
---
Caldari is kind of useful since you can deathclone to your starter school which should be within 5 jumps of the main trading system, Jita. Other than that it doesn't really matter at all which race you choose
---
Make sure you keep setting long term goals, that way you have something to work for and accomplish. Building my first Nyx way back when was a brutal affair, but it was worth it and I still have it to this day.
---
Only problem so far is finding career agents other than the ones nearest to my starting system, I need to open [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career\_Agents](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents)

It was my dad's birthday this week.
---
Anybody else bothered by the fact that an omnipresent, ultra rich, unexemptable, shadow government that meticulously monitors and incentivizes the actions of every capsuleer is called "The Agency"?
---
Like, the CIA is referred to as the agency, but they didn't go out and register "The Agency" with a trademark. I mean, it's got the word THE in it's name! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
---
Thanks!
---
First Goons, then TEST, now FRT 
---
Even krab ourselves are getting bored with krabing and looking for bigger krabs to kill
---
Can you build a dread in a POS right now? Did they remove that yet?
---
I really want to grow my corporation and get involved in a lot of wars, etc. Is that realistic?
---
I am 100% ok with respawn timers on anomalies in null as well. People doing mindless krab content 23/7 is nonsense.
---
Then continue doing what is fun for you. Bittervets like Vara will quit eventually (only to start again because there is nothing like EVE out there, complain some more, quit again, start again, etc.).  
---
Meanwhile people like you need to hold the colors high and tell others how fun this game is, so we got new exited players when you reach the burnout/bittervet stage.  
---
We all done our all-nighters to grind, but make sure you set yourself a goal and stop the grind for a while once you have reached it and enjoy what you have archieved.
---
yes.
---
move to wormholes. you will burn out of nullsec as you realize everything is futile and pointless
---
but wormholes have the world you seek
---
???
---
I know how it is. My first 3 days in eve, i was like: who the fuck plays a game with 2 pilots?
---
Then, suddenly, i created one alt. I could mine much more but i would lose a lot of time hauling it. Then, i created a hauler. Then, that hauler would waste to much time in grid without hauling it, so i had to create another miner.
---
I "ended"  with 600 alts i think.
---
Dont let the cancer spread. 
---
Make some iskies then GO PVP!
---
Lose a lot of frigates, destroyers, LEARN A LOT! 
---
Gank, steal, explore WH, there are so much fun stuff in eve, its literally endless.
---
Find a good corp for you and your buddies, eve is a social game for socioapths &lt;3
---
You might be better suited to find a group to grow with. You are just learning the very first steps of EVE, trying to also recruit and lead and provide content for players will be an immense challenge and one that won't be ultimately successful at this stage of your career. But, finding the right corp for you to join that is active and has content would provide you with a lot more fun and time well spent in game.
---
Yhat will teach u to mine the arknor first
---
so, for how long have you beeing playing?
---
&gt; But as long as neither A or B have any intention beyond gudfites it's hardly a fight for survival for either group.
---
Not bringing gudfights is a good way to get evicted. Also evictions in general produce fantastic fights for all involved.
---
People are just biased because they only remember the fun times
---
The idea behind them is to mitigate damage, not tank it, unless someone drops a 50man cerb fleet on you you should be able ti mitigate most damage.
---
There is a huge difference between being a troll (which I do quite often myself) and calling for someone to be fired.
---
So in the words of Mike Tyson, you're a piece of shit.
---
Don't pay attention to the whiners on here, they're just mad because they want to live in the past and ruin it for anyone trying to enjoy Eve today. Play how you want, as long as you are having fun. Fly dangerously!
---
Who says the two approaches are mutually exclusive though?
---
Here, have some SP with a relatively short expiry date and a permanent lore item. Also you get a ticket you can use to have an agent give you a mission of your choice for even better rewards. Missions which send you in to sites which happen to have rewards of their own anyway like the old seasonal events.
---
Not long only a week or two, *filthy casual*

"This is not a war, This is a Tribute"

You forgot to add the "rofl" at the end for the unironic triple laughing at a random statement.

Nice, wishing him the best of health and happiness for the many, many years ahead of him.
---
The ones you give tags in exchange for faction standings? Those were awesome beofre citadels made standings almost useless for trading
---
well, in that period playerbase was a bit different than now. Which dramatically affected gameplay .
---
An when it comes to MMO gameplay , important thing is what keeps you playing for years, not weeks.
---
Thanks :D
---
Wow that's a lot of alts 0-0
---
Alright
---
Yes evitctions don't fall under that.
---
And it is just my own subjective opinion anyway.
---
Winmattar
---
This is written like a follow-up report, even though it is The Scope's first report. I guess they're bowing to The Discourse? :P
---
Also, from the ticker: "Upwell Consortium refuses to comment on rumors of stealth structure technology" :O
---
Thank you. :)
---
Kind of. There were a lot of things better and worse about the game years ago. Depends what you enjoy about the game if it’s still fine or gotten considerably less enjoyable.
---
Quitting Amazon Firesale?
---
Governments can't find a common ground even when faced with a common foe? 
---
NOOOOO !?!?! Who would have ever seen that coming. Maybe we should just help them blow up the empires. Not like 00 doesn't have more fire power. 
---
That's how ccp should end the game in a few years. The last year they know eve will be around d. Just take the handcuffs off. Let us fire the empires.
---
Sounds more like anchorable guns to me.
---
The format is perfect. You get to hear not only the platform they are presenting, but also the personality of the candidate. Don't change a thing.
---
Actually empires was united upon one thing in lore , is to kill sansha , that exploited people so hard that Amarrian slave worlds may sound like a kindergarten .
---
Standard fit Rattle, no. Bhaal is the exception because it shits on just about everything.
---
Nope
---
Yup! I did the math when shattered wormholes came out, before realising they didn't have any moons to anchor a POS on. The Confessor is the only small-size ship that can get 2000m^3 in cargo space.
---
And only a capsuler walks out
---
Flipside you get to wear a cool hood.
---
It was more fun when a bunch of the minmatar ships required missiles guns, and drones. The naglfar for a long time wasn't just the worst dread, it had a much higher training time because capital guns AND capital missiles.
---
my unallied sandbox corp has started aggressively recruiting for our push into neighboring systems.  its endearing to see a bunch of salty bittervets taking time away from krabbing and pvp meyhem to gently lead a gaggle newbros by the hand.  teaching them how to survive in eve, how to prosper.
---
it warms the cockles of me little black heart
---
And Triglavians hate Sansha....
---
Interesting times coming
---
Those are false accusations!      
---
This information you are citing was fabricated by CONCORD operatives.          
---
What else you can expect from organization that will look elsewhere if you give them bribe "aka war bill" so you can kill someone freely.          
---
Our beloved Lord Sansha Kuvakei will do anything for his citizens!
---
Poses making a comeback then?
---
Just no, man.. just no... you need help.
---
Create 12 characters. 4 factions, 3 bloodlines each. Wtf create 24 (male/female). 
---
Alpha accounts are unlimited and free, just do it.
---
Welcome to EVE
---
I'm still stranded btw
---
*hides true slaves from people that was stolen in incursions*
---
I meant the faction maulus, the Navy issue, but yeah that too!
---
I like it too!
---
It's not blobbing if elite wormhole pvpppers do it
---
Those people were freed and joined our utopian Nation.       
---
Aren't you to old to believe in every thing you see in the CONCORD propaganda.
---
Mittani lied, Excavators died.
---
Level 3 go up to 4800 m³
---
It's only one or two of the missions
---
They don't hate us... well, i will try to explain this in more simple way.         
---
Triglavian tried to create utopian nation, Sansha succeed.         
---
Triglavians simply cannot accept this fact.
---
Amen, brother.
---
The Great Tribute Turkey Shoot?
---
flew in a nergal fleet yesterday and got some pretty sweet kills.
---
Will be even better when they fix all the bugs in the exploration section. I go into a system, scan down the sigs, and the agency window will show whats in that system... until I leave that system. Then it still shows x # of sigs in that system like i never scanned them? plz fix
---
I still ponder how much coordination it takes to cyno 20 capitals to their own unique position
---
All for the sake of quality!
---
Reminded me of this gem: https://youtu.be/2GFTWlhNkm4
---
There is a real reason, which is this:
---
CCP coded SKINs to be tied to individual characters. A corp is not a character. Well, it kind of is, but it isn't.
---
So it's like, who pays for the SKIN? Who applies it? Who owns it? They have had to re-jigger the existing system a lot to make it work I'm sure.
---
i'm glad you are keeping the solo blops dream alive!
---
I get massive lagspikes every time a titan bridges onto grid, which is super awkward overall :/ other than that...
---
Ok that seems to be true ... wait a second CONCORD was not established before rise of Sansha , so you can’t blame it’s propaganda
---
Pos guns, yes. They are missing fast-anchoring beachheads for feature parity of POSes and Upwell stuff.
---
Or a way to anchor and upgrade your own gate guns.
---
Or something [completely different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o)
---
I took stats. Statistically Significant literally means that there's enough data to suggest a a lack of coincidence. 5% would suggest that there's a reason people had issues, but that would leave 95% that did it properly, which means the reason could be anything from "CCP is evil" to "5% of people are ****ing stupid and can't read the rules that CCP wrote for them to read".
---
But, sure, make the assumption that it's the former when the statistics don't back that assumption up.
---
Here is all the TIS interviews.

I don’t have I list of everyone who hasn’t interviewed yet

still not investors
---
you people make this game fun ^^
---
Or you burn out in wormholes, having to scan absolutely everything all the time before you can jump to another system..
---
nice strawman to deny the still valid fact that, putting a "holder"-proxy between CCP and investors does not change anything ...
---
So why are kidnapping people , and make them something unhuman to serve your *true* citizens ?
---
2.5 cyclones. Are they STILL hell camping the pipe? We got the guys in 46DP home save a couple who went to bed.
---
Also haha made em form and waste a fuckton of fuel dropping on us
---
The sooner you get into PVP, the better, trust me even with a cheap ship you can go do some damage and have some insane adrenaline rush.
---
Most games companies love to hear that people are getting addicted to their games - we'd prefer that you keep a healthy balance and that you make sure you're taking care of yourself &lt;3 
---
EVE is always gonna be here when you want to log in and play - always remember that.
---
True that it's persistent and a bit of a rat race, but if there's anything I've learned in 17 years of being part of the community - don't lose sleep over it.
---
Make sure that you take care of yourself and get an adequate amount of rest. Make sure you're staying well fed and are tending to those around you too.
---
Don't stress, so long as you've got a skill training, you're not losing out. 
---
EVE is about the long game, not rushing to get things done.
---
Enjoy your time in New Eden - sounds like you're having a blast already, but remember to take it in moderation, and take good care of yourself &lt;3 
---
ONE OF US
---
Stil Love iT!
---
Maken me almost want to stop winning Eve!
---
Be sure to sprinkle some PVP in!  Even if it’s a crap ship with crap skills.  It will extend the time before the burnout phase.  Grinding is great and at times a necessity, but if you never include pvp you’ll reach the burnout phase way faster!
---
&gt; haven't played eve in 10 years
---
says the PUBG-alliance-member ;-P
---
Hold the line and pass the antimatter
---
all the scources i see say the buyout closed in oct of last year, so no proxy, as thats finished. thus 100% owned by PA, thus no investors. if you claim im wrong, instead of being a dick, a source would be nice.
---
It would be nice if the bookmark thing (or whatever they called it) would be a bit more prominent than a little link at the bottom of the page. Or maybe I am doing it wrong.
---
At least with that I can add escalations there so I can go right to the one page I use the most.
---
very very MEH
---
a lot of great fights in low sec lately which have made things very exciting. i just quit my job and am moving to the beach as well. who wants to visit for a bbq? : \] hope everyone is doing well!

This is why I hope Google never cracks how to properly translate things. The internet is so much better this way.
---
But logging in 100 SP-Farms with Rorqual-Chars , and tieing them with TACO and NEAR2 so you can afk your billion-ISK-farming to ACTVELY collect minutes on Netflix or Prime is okay? Asking for a friend ...

&gt; Don't stress, so long as you've got a skill training, you're not losing out.

It just counters the Delve nerds logging in hundreds of carebear accounts ... every fauce needs a sink ... but what do you know about economic healt ....
---
&gt; is okay?
---
No it isn't.  WTF is wrong with you?
---
Why billions of people die on board of capsuleer ships and ships destroyed by capsuleers ?         
---
Why you can pay CONCORD to look the other side so you can kill thousands of people ?        
---
Why all the nations so easily moved to UPWELL structures from heavily shielded outposts that no one could destroy?      
---
Like billions of people are dying in all those Upwell structures.          
---
Yet you are asking me why people in glorious Sansha Nation are working for a greater good of our utopia? Utopia that provides them  with all they need and shield them from other "para" governments that only care about ISK.          
---
Oh you poor summer child.........
---
I miss Amarr Certified News.

The best news.

This is the new LS site on Sisi ?

If you pimp them both the rattle does more dps than the leshak can tank without heat and tanks the leshak comfortably, both with injected fits. I haven’t checked whether that has changed since Officer RS became a possibility or where the crossover point is expense-wise.

How does that work if you don’t mind me asking? Lol I just started playing it and I wanna pick up mining

Also gonna plug in a series called “Legend of the Galactic Heroes.” It’s anime, but it’s damn good anime. Has none of the things that makes modern anime unappealing to non-anime fans. It’s only 110 episodes plus some movies x(

Ho...what? I mean I know people with a lot of alts, but nowhere near 600. How do you even keep track of everything?
---
It is on TQ :)

really excited to fight with shoot first and iron armada. thank you for the content. (✿◠‿◠)
---
Oh nice.
---
And stay hydrated!
---
&gt; WTF is wrong with you?
---
I actually think before posting, I know thats weird on reddit but I can't help it ...
---
Lets just say that the skill queue is probably the only reason I can hold down a real job. I still remember many a day rushing home on my lunch break to switch skill training so there wouldn't be any down time.
---
Grow up kid ...
---
What do you think the „e“ stands for?
---
If you think its bad now, wait until you go fuck Eve for the first time and the withdrawals star to kick in after a week.
---
Keepstar "Denim" skin when?
---
Gooble gobble, gooble gobble.
---
^ this, just have a 4th "rig" slot
---
I told you to fuck off but you're still here.  Strange.
---
can you use mining lasers and excavators to lay siege to the keepstar   when that skin is applied?
---
Apparently you don't.
---
i hope your mach will live for all eternity and get many frags, windsigh (◕‿◕✿)
---
Everything in Eve is killable especially bots. You 0.0 troglodyte.
---
Okay but only if they can drop as loot.
---
All of them. Because Avatar
---
Thank you.
---
If we’re being extremely fair.
---
Using corvettes is the poors version. You can fit out a cyno ship for relatively cheap. Considering you’re cynoing a multiple bil isk ship to come to you.
---
I have reel of super 8 film I shot last weekend I've been itching to develop, but I'm not sure if the camera I shot it on is working so I should probably mail it out for development. 
---
I'm also busy for the rest of the weekend which means tonight's probably gonna be my only EvE time this week so I'm likely kidding myself if I think I'm gonna do anything other than play when I get back from work.
---
You don't need to go in HS, only to have a Jita alt that just sit in the station to buy and contract stuff for your main. You use a JF service to bring ship in the NS systems where you're living / deployed. You stay in NS for isk and shit.
---
&gt; If I can only make one or two ops a month is there a group that will not care? 
---
Most likely any large group as long as you're joining a large corp inside it.
---
&gt; Do I have to fold and make a hauler alt?
---
No
---
&gt; Are you allowed to do your own thing?
---
Of course yes (except obvious stuff like shooting blue and specifics). People might get angry if you doing something else during an op or something.
---
&gt; I know this is probably wildly different depending on the alliance.
---
It's pretty much the same for all non too shit alliances.
---
Seems like shooting ninja salvagers might be a good time.
---
Got it, thanks!  That practice of starting the timer and then picking a quiet time for restarting it is ingenious.
---
&gt; Breaking: Reports of Triglavian assault forces breaching stations and asteroid colonies
---
PLEASEEEEEEEEEE steal structures, Trigs I believe in you
---
Yea, ganking them is pretty easy.
---
It’s a slight hinderance I guess maybe. Idk ive never cycnoed from a vette. Even when I cyno onto a wormhole. Smart bomb them off and jump in.
---
Also the hood is OP.
---
Well I find it's not so much the alliance you need to find but a good and active corpcwith active members and especially a five leadership. As a CEO I'm online everyday, maybe not for alot of hours or always at my PC, but on out of game cons like slack or discord and on voice coms as well as active members on voice coms as well. That is what makes anything in eve. Null is just the same as low or whs, just need to find a Corp you like, with majority of thier playerbase in your timezone and decent enough to be chill. In this game, that's what is always the real win to anything.
---
Kind of. Higher likelyhood code is near Jita.
---
Brave has absolutely no requirements for members, allowing you the opportunity to do whatever you are interested in. Also, our space in Catch is always full of roaming small gangs looking to us for content
---
Do you know of any public fleets, or in particular public channels?
---
Damn right
---
The article refers to small arms, which usually mean personnel.  Moreover these are for AEGIS, which the article noted earlier was planetside.  Lastly it says "modular capabilities".
---
Sounds like Project Nova to me.
---
Yes. Eve has gotten very risk averse lately, especially nullsec. I'm trying to make it more dangerous, roaming in small gangs every couple nights. We're going hard to make a point.
---
We get blobbed, we don't care. We're getting supers dropped on us, we don't care. We're GOING to kill your shit or have fun trying.
---
Null has been trying to make eve more safe for a long time, and they've gotten close to perfecting it. It's boring, and it needs to swing back!
---
Bruh. Ive been trying to convince ppl to let the starting choices matter. In skill distribution.
---
At the moment every race and every school starts with the same stats, different appearences the only difference is the free skills and ships during the carrer missions ( of which you can do any for any race, regardless of your starting race. 
---
Literally the only difference is asthetics and maybe the free corvette which is not a ship you want to main.
---
I assume you are flair baiting, but.....
---
You do realize the irony of someone with your flair saying "unfettered ramblings of a cult leader"?
---
Possibly my favourite fan fiction of all time. We need more!
---
Fuck me stealth structures? Please no. If they must make it at most a small single person deal with a small storage space. The structure plague is bad enough.
---
So by your logic, no one should own a titan, because no one can guarantee that real life won't kick you in the balls from time to time.
---
!remindeme 2 hours
---
"Any intention beyond gudfites" - and this is the problem. People don't roam for the gudfites in null as much anymore, and I don't know why not. Even fucking Dreddit stopped for a while, thank god we've got guys running corp roams and looking for pewpew every night again now.
---
A lot of it's blueballs or helldunks so we're looking for wormholes to go fight jspace people lol. We won't wait for you to come to us, if we find your hole it's fight time.
---
Are those only spawning in HS as current Invasions?
---
Who?
---
They instantly MJD + cloak if probes or ships are on scan, and instantly cloak if a new sig pops up, while sitting 420km away from the site.
---
Give Trigs an uninhabitated constellation/let capsuleers fight for them and join them.
---
Yes, moving for war is a great burden. Took all of 3 hours.
---
So by your logic we should count all of the moving that Panfam is going to have to do to recover all of their shit and rebuild.
---
it's not really about price, it's about convenience. With a ceptor you can pack a cyno and fuel an go anywhere, and then stick it on a rookie ship that you can get at any station or citadel, regardless of the market there
---
I don't see anything wrong with a structure that is cloaked as long as nobody is nearby, doesn't provide docking or tethering and just serves as a war depot
---
Friendly reminder from angry OP that a shitty post is about a poor survey about the event, not about the event itself.
---
Seriously you dudes ignore damn topic and start bitching about "how dare those entitled retards not like what I like" and when you get argumented answers you start calling us (people who did not liked the event) bitching entitled retards. What the hell.
---
Everything's still in salvage??
---
This invasion is officially a boring failure then...
---
I did. Back in the POS days you stash it in an outpost, where even if said outpost is flipped, you still have your stuff. Now, you stash it in a citadel, where even if the citadel is destroyed, you still have your stuff.
---
Yeah ok maybe that could work, but the prevailence of structures is getting a bit nuts. There isn't enough structure death keeping shit in check. Umbrellas are too strong, it's a problem.
---
That's another subject tbh.
---
The level of industry coming out of wormhole space has more to do with the nature of wormholes and their shifting connections and complexity of logistics than they are about absence of local chat. Your argument was that lack of local chat would destroy the isk machine and I simply point out it’s only a risk averse mindset that would cause that.
---
Yeah fair that.
---
Calm down Becky.
---
Other than the LP and Isk yes.
---
&gt;the entire game blobbed us
---
wasn't entire game, only few stood long enough to be somewhat relevant and/or posed some kind of threat to you.
---
&gt;hang around and at least pretend to fight back
---
your memory is shit
---
I regularly light cynos on my main in noob ships?
---
Clear Skies reunion tour...
---
Though honestly I just turned up on SISI and got shot at for a couple hours. Hardly had to twist my arm. :P

Yes. If they spawned randomly it would be abit weird.

You can pretty much do anything you want. There are enough players that it's easy to find or form fleets. If mining and indy or ratting are your thing or you like it as a side activity you can do that in as much safety as the alliance can assure. On the coalition level fleets are often quite large, but corp and smaller alliance roams are more small-gang unit feel which I enjoy a lot. Fleet participation is tracked, but any expectations of participation depends on your corp/alliance. The corp I am in requires 5 per month minimum with perks for more than that, others require one per month or 3 fleets per quarter or whatever, it varies. If you pvp as your primary activity you will be fine even if you can't get out much. Real life comes first for most groups in my experience. Good luck on your search!
---
Has nothing to do with "outwitting". I have more ISK than time these days, so when I do play I like to go big. I like risking billions of ISK for no reason other than the thrill of it. Remember, its a game. The point is to have fun.
---
Thanks Falcon! I'll keep my eyes peeled :)
---
The max payout I have gotten is 1000 LP and 15 million ISK. The payout goes down above 3 people in the site.
---
Recommendations on (cheap) fits to try these sites?
---
I have looked at brave a bit. From going against them once on a NPSI fleet they seemed like they actually appreciate a GF not just hammer smash with a bigger more expensive fleet. Or maybe just a cool FC by chance.
---
Did you not read? The dude literally said he hated the event.
---
&gt; I prefer solo or small gang pvp with some explo on the side to fund it.
---
Heads up, depending on the alliance you join you can heavily limit your targets due to blues, might be worth considering
---
Same tbh
---
Just a point I'd like to make is cruise are perfectly viable for brawling. In fact they have better application than torps for some reason.
---
Being in a big alliance:
---
* Lots of pings for fleets. "Oh yea, got a fight any time I want!"     
---
* Lots of pings "Stupid carebear got tackled in his rorqual - woo content go save him and get kills."  
---
* Lots and lots of communication in alliance and your own corp discord, mostly great means and that NSFW channel on fire.  
---
* Lots of people to get to know and befriend. A few edgelords that obviously shit up chat every day at the same time (when they get done with classes or something **eyeroll**)  
---
* As much isk making capacity as you want, but expect to be hunted because the more people there are around you - the more opportunity for content for the guy hunting you.  
---
* Having to mute that one guy on fleets because he is always drunk and "effff seeeee, hergle bergle ephhuph awooph mehph" on coms.  
---
* Being that guy on coms and laughing because they can't get on your level.  
---
* Infinite opportunities for people on reddit to talk shit about you because you chose to be in a different group of space nerds than them.
---
Can't lie. That may be the most boring video I have ever watched. And I do PI for gods sake.
---
Happy 14th Birthday
---
I do love getting Scope news updates. It's great to be getting these again.
---
Mail my character and I'll link it there.
---
Probably because you're not using it for the same reasons as other players. For roaming PvP the new map is absolutely useless.
---
Thank you
---
I was in a small sov holding group for a while. Liked my Corp not so much my alliance. That's why I was thinking of looking at the alliance this time. Kinda sucked leaving a group of people who were fun to hang out with in space because I did not like where the alliance was going
---
r/HydroHomies
---
You can do whatever you want and solo pve life is viable. However it sucks in comparison to the isk and the fun you'll have in a proper corp. EVE is a social game. There are many newbie friendly corps, but for newbie *focused* corps the big 5 are:
---
* Pandemic Horde - No wait time, nullsec, guristas pve, super large group
---
* Brand Newbros - dino mascot, nullsec, sansha pve, mentor program, smaller corp
---
* Karmafleet - One of the most secure pve areas, nullsec, blood pve, strong local economy
---
* BRAVE - smaller group, nullsec, sansha pve, a good place to find pvp content
---
* EVE University - high/low/null/wh (a little of everything), great classes and wiki, smallest, 1-2 wk wait time
---
There is also going to be a third wave. They do things in threes.
---
It is with the third wave we will be seeing their largest warships: the surprise and “completely unexpected’\^TM arrival of the Triglavian Titan class super capital appearing on the battlefield.
---
Does anybody know of any public triglavian invasion fleets? what their in game channel might be?
---
&gt; Upwell Consortium refuses to comment on rumors of stealth structure technology
---
System-wide decloaking pulse please.
---
Took me 7ish years to get mine.  Named it "La Procrastinator"
---
That’s a good name for it! I haven’t named mine yet
---
thats for the lootfairy to decide
---
I had thought of that. a little worried I may cut my possible targets in half
---
It’s their choice to make their way to ships or structures , yes some of them is forced , but this is how people work  . Also I think that crew is a hoax , because we don’t have to supply big ships with water , oxygen , food and wages for crew .
---
But at least I can agree with you in one thing , Upwell made space structures too accessible , and this is cancer
---
We usually reserve the big hammer for our leaning system, but in Catch it’s generally ‘gudfites’ in almost all time zones. I wouldn’t think Kim’s from NPSI fleets would be a huge deal. Brave has been the best alliance I have been in, and there’s always something going on. Also, the lack of drama is nice
---
"Triglav defense" is an ingame channel that runs public fleets
---
We can all hope for a truly all out war the last year of eve whenever that is
---
This. In the past Caldari were best due to racial bonuses, but that's long since been removed. At this point it's essentially  just a cosmetic/RP choice.
---
ohhh you're makin' me mad, ho boy, phew!
---
And you chose the flying penis...
---
Congratz, remember on my first char, when i got a titan, okay back then all had to work together, and in all of eve there were only 6 before mine. 
---
Still it was a great fealing, and i think you have the same the day you jumpt into your titan-pilotseat the first time and docked up.
---
I love flying Amarr, have to keep my faith
---
Please don't... Honestly. If I was starting again I would do as much as I could to get into PVP as quickly as possible. Also, leave highsec ASAP regardless of your goals. You want to mine? It'll be a lot more lucrative out of high and you'll learn how to survive. 
---
You want to make quick bucks, train up explo head to stain. Sansha sites are the best. There is a Freeport down there somewhere too that you can sell at for about 70% Jita price.
---
[invasion intensifies]
---
Idk, talk to someone from red frog I think.
---
Wow that’s amazing, back in the old days when I saw Titans I was amazed. My first fleet with one instead of opening the jump bridge the titan jumped himself instead. Glorious times! 
---
I’ve been sitting on the undock for hours just admiring it haha
---
Think hard on one. Must be unique. I truly feel like every titans name should be thought out.
---
Being blue to brave, I actually like hanging out with them. Evictus is a nice place to be, there are some good PvP corps as well. PH can get you some good fights too, I believe.
---
Ofc you can always join Odin's call, inner hell or those wh players as well, good whalers
---
I heard the triglavians also want to build a lowsec gate.
---
It's worth mentioning that gold ammo in WoT was not cash-only for long.  It became available for the equivalent of ISK in like 2012, albeit at a high price.  Also, HEAT shells (the typical gold ammo) do have a few specific drawbacks (really bad against spaced armor mostly) that standard AP does not, although it would be fair to call them niche cases.  For tanks with APCR gold rounds, gold is still strictly better.
---
There won't be a final year. You severely underestimate many of the players' level of autism. I could see someone trying to keep it going if CCP shut up shop.
---
Sure, the more going on the better for the game.
---
I was just saying, that for me personally fights with my back to the wall are the most fun.
---
Prepare to be boarded!
---
You can learn a lot from watching 'tubes.
---
Also there is a haulers chat channel in game
---
Maybe they were expanding it to LS or something like that, idk vOv
---
That's fair. Where do you make those happen? Start a small null entity in NPC and try to take sov? There are some guys up in PB doin that right now.
---
Any idea if they added new stuff to the LP store as well? Just after release it was a handful of skins, datacore and 2 Indy skillbooks. If it's still just that LP isn't likely to be worth much in a few weeks.
---
I suggest a Caldari character, as it puts your 'school system" very close to Jita.  It won't make sense why now, and it's a long thing to explain,  but it can be a huge timesaver in the future. 
---
Also, welcome to EVE!
---
May your blood sacrifice to Bob bring you luck in your future endeavors.
---
The two things I am learning are mining and how to fight and I honestly enjoy both, I’m stilll getting a feel for the game before I leave high sec
---
Congratulations man! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
There are groups that believe RL &gt; Eve, Dreddit being one of them. You come on ops when you can / want to, and people get motivated. You do your own thing when there's no big ops on, and in my case that means a lot of corp fleets, small gang pvp, and solo. The occasional isk related activity.
---
You don't need a hauler alt, you have alliance freight services to haul for you. Just pay them and get stuff delivered. Or buy stuff on local market.
---
Don't just be an "alliance player". Join your corp for your corp and be part of the alliance culture. I don't consider myself "in TEST", I'm in Dreddit, Dreddit is in TEST. :)

O God yes and I 2oukd play that "new eve" too. Been playing this since it went live. I love this game. If I could just play eve and make money doing it I would.

---
Thank you CCP Falcon!
---
Seems pretty clear from this report that the Trigs ARE going to bash structures soon.
---
Ok, sure. A lot of new folk are targets for shitty high sec mining corps that will never get you anywhere. 3 years down the track you'll still be spreading your cheeks for a million isk. 
---
Find someone that shoots at you that is friendly and willing to help you learn and join them instead.
---
That's what I remember too, being able to see the ship enter warp, not loading when't it's already at 0 m/s.

You forgot including on the last one that you also get infinite opportunities to talk shit about others in different space groups than you.
---
It actually stopped raining where I live and promises to be a fantastic weekend, I'm probably going to go spend some time outside (◡‿◡✿)
---
Well, that's only after the hazing.
---
Lmao what do you mean shoots at me? I do agree of the mining Corp thing though
---
I think the important thing is you enjoy it, who cares how long you get tied down by a game?
---
I mean if a player shoots at you and wipes you off grid, try chatting to them. Good way to learn pvp. I've recruited plenty of people I've either killed or tried to kill in the past. If it's a total noob, I'll usually pay for their ship and throw in a bonus too. I only really want the corpse.
---
Dammit you beat me to it
---
afaik everything will be saved to the server except your overview - you will need to go log onto eve on your old computer, go to overview settings, export overview, and then transfer the file that is created to your new computer and do the same thing except this time 'import overview'
---
A tip for next time. Make a private channel just for yourself. Put your overview in the motd and your overview will be stored on the server until eve really dies.
---
The actual game settings are in a subfolder that's named according to the path where your eve client is installed. If eve is installed in a different location on the new PC you need to rename that. For example:
---
C:\Users\Me\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\C_program_files_eve_client_tq_tranquility
---
might need to change to
---
C:\Users\Me\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\D_games_eve_client_tq_tranquility

Upvotes are the real currency of Eve in this YOOL 2019.

---
You don't need hauler alts, most big block alliances have hauler services and there staging systems are Well stocked in general. If you realy need to use jita you can create An alt in one of the two extra character slots.
---
Congrats
---
Shameless plug but you should consider giving wormholes a try. You can get the big fleet experience while still having a good deal of small gang pvp to do. Granted you really don’t see the HUGE fleet fights that the null blocs see, but in my experience they sound alot more fun than they really are. Mostly a shitton of tidi and you dont really pilot your ship as much as you just shoot the primary. But the fleet fights I’ve experienced in wormholes have been the fights I had been looking for the whole time. I flew with null blocs most of my 6 or so years of eve and wormholes created the content I’d been looking for. Might not be exactly what you’re looking for but it could be worth the try!
---
What if my Irl name is as shirt as Pa H ?
---
If you like being a mindless drone it’s probably ok. Otherwise it’s fucking terrible.
---
Still waiting for Urd to post about the Hel we stole from Evictus last week. :/ 
---
Side note - Evictus does bring GF's consider them and some of the other smaller lesser partners as well as the main blocks.
---
They paid you 100mil to light cynos? Where can I get on that business?
---
I have a 150m sp character that can basically only fly amarr. TRUE FAITH
---
That was the point of CONCORD. That they are not attacking the Triglavians breaks all common sense.
---
Stole? I'm more on Reddit then online so I haven't heard about this ahaha quite epic, even more when it's from blues
---
I've had some rando kill me but since it was my first death, I was at a loss but I'll give it a shot when I'm on. I feel like I really wanna get into Eve
---
[Praise Bob and pass the ammunition] (https://youtu.be/uV9s1a6AZT0)

Make a free alt, apply to Pandemic Horde (they'll accept and guide you through) and find out, lots of activity.

CCP literally put in triglavian ships just make you, you personally, upset. That’s their only role! You figured it out! Good job little buddy.
---
So you gonna help him or stop half way?
---
&gt;  "easier for the new player to be relevant without having to train capital skills."
---
Who ever says is about as clueless about the game general state of balance as I'm clueless about why my girlfriend is with me.
---
&gt;  The other thing I disagree is that we shouldn't be making EVE dumber/easier for new players.
---
A thing triglavian ships are not making.
---
&gt; After all his game would be a lot easier on new players if everyone just flew Triglavian.
---
... lol no ?
---
If only all you idiots would quit reading reading Reddit 100 times a week and do something ingame: then content creators like me might have a reason to... create content.
---
No need to put up with stupid space-nerds for that when flair-bating and sockpuppets will do just fine.
---
This. Carrier ratting is the best form, unless you're doing C5/C6s in a Dread, but it requires a lot more attention than the VNI/Gila/Rattlesnake variety. You have to be constantly engaged, but you can pull out an easy 50-60m/tick for your troubles. I do an easy 150m an hour while not stressing, and I can take down the faction spawns in \~4 seconds flat.
---
To cause tears and to get people to buy more i̶s̶k̶  plex
---
Stage One: Start adding groups of racial ships every six months.
---
Stage Two: Always make the new racial ships *slightly* overpowered.
---
Stage Three: Start charging for access to the new ships.
---
But really, shut up. It's nice to have something fresh that people can be excited about.
---
Trig ships have (relatively) horrible range and cannot pressure logi by rapid target switching, they are also hard countered by tracking disruptors and ECM drones since it resets their spool.
---
They are fantastic in WHs (a little too fantastic if anything), but in Nullsec they are much weaker with the high cost and short range.
---
They won't make other ships obsolete. Large alliances still use and will continue to use ships other than triglavian to shoot each other and that's not just because of the price. It's just more useful for them to have all the damage apply immediately.
---
I'm not writing for the average player. I'm writing for the average content creator.   
---
So when did you last get the weather to change for you?  
---
Why is changing your environment such a favored option? It's far easier to change yourself.
---
Ah this feeling when old member feel his butt burns when game becomes easier for new players.  ~~ 
---
They don’t have to suffer and point of the game to have fun, not “sucking it up” and becoming member of the community. 
---
Game should be easier to new players or they will drop it.
---
Wasn't even that bad. We will got s ton of free stuff that CCP had no obligation to give us.
---
If someone runs for CSM with the platform "make old map windowed" they should win
---
Aye we rolled into Evictus space, Urd scanned down a Hel tackled it and aggressed ready for the whaling fleet to come through.
---
We all get hype, and then he notices it is unpiloted so we hop a char in it and as we do a Malediction from Evictus lands on grid in the safe.
---
presumably the pilot.
---
Sorry dude. Been here since 2007. Not excited.

Thanks that's pretty helpful actually

Small alliance : I just saved Joe from being tackled by neuting his tackler. 
---
Big alliance : I just saved our entire capital wing from dying in a bubble by booshing it off.
---
BoB?
---
They are designed for smaller groups to fight larger groups.
---
Big block alliances aren't going to waste the isk on these, and they are hard to get in volume for a larger null doctrine.  Also if you are going to field these in larger numbers, they can easily be countered by TDs. 
---
Assume you are going up against 100 drekaviks. 100 Harbingers with a tracking disruptor fit to each can basically ruin the entire fleet. Not to mention, the ramp up sucks when you need large amounts of alpha in these type of fights. 
---
Trig ships just like any other ship in the game have their place.  Sure, they are strong, but as an example, [my Kikimora fits cost about 500 million isk a pop](https://youtu.be/aBayjH5Fz68). If you had 10 more people you could use Confessors and achieve better results for 1/4 the price.
---
No. This is bullshit. Alliance doctrines are set by cost of fleet. They have to SRP it.  
---
Don't try this garbage logic on me. Besides, the original question is: Why do we need these ships? What's the purpose?
---
Probably for the best that you don't know what kind of penis he's referring to.
---
Join haulers chat channel for sure. And just learn to use public contracts safely and avoid ganks/scams. There isn’t much more to it.

But I'm still correct.

I would suggest Panfam. Other choices include Legacy or the Imperium. If you speak good Mandarin maybe consider Winterco?

I started in 2007 after finding a book on my brothers shelf called “Enders Game.” So I looked up space games and eve came up!

However, it's a stupid business that determines they don't need their long-term customers. Just ask the Boyscouts of America who ticked off their religious members and oh wait.. Now they're bankrupt.

Anyone who thinks 60km range is poor makes me think of the typical F1 monkey that only fights in TiDi where the ranges are generally 75km-100. There's more to Fozzie Sov than structure timer fights.

KK Thanks Bro! I'll keep working on it!
---
Yeah, the downside is that playing only EvE from 13 to 25 makes all of the other games (with online components) look stupid.
---
Its one of those naughty wyvern things isnt it?
---
I don't think you *can* make them happen really.
---
On the other hand, you could just decide to move in somewhere and try not to get kicked out by the residents. But that's hardly the same as defending a home you grew to like.
---
Hi, I use a Vedmak for nano gang stuff. They are good for small gang stuff cause they have good speed, tracking, and if piloted correctly are like a Swiss Army knife. Non T2 ammo has amazing tracking and can track inties easily. They are also good for killing that last bit of tanks things cause of the ramp damage such as a dual rep hype. 
---
My vedmak goes up to like 4.5k with our drugs and implants.
---
You still have it? Or did it blow up? Very curious.
---
Im sorry for you but if the game was not easy for you it doesn’t mean it has to be hard for everyone else here. I’m playing 5 years already and I am happy about newbro friendly changes they making.

Trigs meant to destroy caps and they are easier to get than caps.

They are also more fun to fly and play overall.

---
My point was that it has it's uses (WH brawls, cap hunting) and it's limitations (Fozzie Sov fights).
---
Do spend some time with your dude my dude    :)
---
Yeah it’s hard to find any games with the amount of detail, and the strategy involved in nullsec.
---
It's okay, you chose the 2nd best Titan. At least you didn't go with a Ragnarok or Leviathan.
---
Plot twist: he just started yesterday and injected the hell out of his toons.

---
Trig ships are great for small gang / solo roamers, they have uses in null, lowsec and WHs. the t2 versions are especially interesting. Are they necessary? Not *necessarily* (right???), but they are a great new ship line that a lot of people are having fun with so...yea.
---
It took more than a week for them to decide to team up.
---
Enjoy Exterpation
---
Eve easy mode.
---
Donkey!
---
This is a decent answer. However was this a role that another ship can't fill?   
---
I don't mind killing shiny ships. The triglavian ships don't scare me. Just wondering why they are so op. What purpose do they fill.
---
To period basis?
---
If they were meant to kill capitals why do their weapons need such amazing tracking?  
---
Last I check structures and capitals were pretty easy to track.
---
I dont know, really. Some are strong, some are lackluster at best especially in light of their high cost. That said, I dont think everything has to be "necessary" or even "best at" something or needs to be useful in fleets.
---
Because they are also good in few vs many situations. 
---
You are so pissed like if they would cost as a heron, not like a t3. Start your t3 rant then, they are powehouses too.
---
for small scale lmfao how is that not obvious
---
Thanks Falcon, this is good advice whether someone has been playing for 10 days or 10 years!
---
It’s the only way to identify if someone is part of a X alliance/Corp. Why would you represent a group if you are not a member of said group?
---
And CONCORD is going to be too busy fighting. Trigs in invasion systems to engage rogue capsuleers....
---
DED LP for Twilight skins will be worth it
---
Im sorry
---
they are though...
---
I recently left the wh discord praisebob on a personal boycott with myself refusing to rejoin it until I work out 4 days consecutively. They’ve changed the server emblem to a gif of me getting blapped in a barghest. Really makes me miss it even more now.
---
Was that at Asakai by any chance?
---
Tell me moar about the your emotions that made you write this post.
---
Hey, I was trying to figure this out a few days ago (the previous version that is), and I have just a few questions:
---
Does it need structures to exist in space? Or can it be loaded with hypothetical structures that are not anchored yet?
---
How do you load the ESI for a certain character into the sheet? What about multiple characters? I granted the ESI loader permission, but I'm not too sure what to do with it exactly.
---
Its not a penis. its obviously a buttplug.
---
Why it shouldnt?
---
Might be, honestly it’s been many years since then. I’ve been on a couple fleets that have had the titan jump instead of bridging
---
If you think that’s fun, try a faction scram Keres with 3 range damps, MWD, active armor, snake clone. 4.5k/s with 23km scram and the ability to drop most battleships lock range below 12-15km is fun. Can tackle solo kite cerbs and shit too.
---
I always thought of WH life as being more "time intensive" then I can commit to at this point in my life. Is it over sold or does it really take a lot of time even in a decent sized group?
---
thank you, init, for having caps out for us to shoot, and shooting our caps.
---
They make a nice brawling ship and structure burners. Yet over all the lack a lr gun making them kinda useless for most main line fleets. If given a lr gun though I think they would break up the meta.
---
No that's the Hyperion.
---
Living the alliance life is ok. It gets kind of lame being another board in the wall tho. Overall i wouldn't reccomend it unless you plan on playing mostly by yourself anyway.
---
Playing EVE has been known to ruin the experience of other games for being ‘not as engaging’.
---
Half the people that got fucked on the SP were people that read until 20 and assume it would encompass their timezone, something CCP totally forgot is a thing, other half got to read an emaol/ad two days too late or had one or two days of fucking 16 that they could not get to use their computer... Yeah totally our fault and we should throw money at CCP to show that we are sorry for our own stupidity.
---
The players are spoiled by the average IQ of an EVE player, that being much higher than in any other game and by the complexity of the awesome interface.
---
That’s awesome man! I sometimes find the game to be quiet relaxing and it also has helped me through some times! I want to fly capital ships so bad!
---
Also give Dreads 2 reinforcement timers, unless they run out of fuel in which case they only get 1
---
About to ignore all of that and stay inside for 3 weeks playing
---
Yeah that's a myth perpetuated by Eve players. You're all stupid fucks IMO, but that's just me.
---
except Dwarf Fortress
---
 (◡‿◡✿)  thanks nomex for the fight even if you outnumbered us 20:1
---
So hard to find another game where you issue 2 commands and watch Netflix at the same time..
---
Salty much? You don't understand the market.
---
They already did this regarding cap reps.
---
The recent addition of the diminished returns on FAX reps was simply the mirror of a long time idea to force dps to spread out their damage as well.
---
I wouldn't go with the damage cap mechanic. I would rather them use a form of dps curve that mirrors the new fax changes.
---
Then squads would have a target calling use again. Fill up squads with X number of ships needed for optimal dps and let them broadcast their own targets. Would really engage a lot more people in a large fleet.
---
Well without knowing what alliance cant say, but yes sometimes there is that. Cant just join an alliance thou you join a Corp in the alliance.
---
OP's link literally has a screenshot of the skin.
---
A friend reccomened I start with a thrasher and 200mm light gallium guns. Is that good?
---
30 minutes? Run two nags with a shitty t2 fit like 2.5bil total for each and you can 2-3 cycle sites
---
I imagine what you are trying to say is "let sieged dreads bypass current structure damage cap"
---
Well it kinda depends. If you’re wanting to actually run your own group then yeah its alot of work. But if youre somone like me that just hops on for a few hours a day then its really not. It takes a bit of time to get yourself setup in the hole youre living in but other than that its quite easy. 
---
I’ve only ever flown with one wh group so far but most of our doctrine ships are on contracts in the hole so its not like youd have to haul a bunch of shit in. A good amount of the chain is scanned most of the time so you its not like you’re spending hours scaning around all the time. It does sometimes require you to scan around to find new holes for stuff to kill in but not much longer than youd spend flying around null looking for someone to fight. 
---
All in all i do think its a little exaggerated unless you plan on taking on a leadership role. I only spens maybe 3-4 hours at most a day and it doesn’t feel too time intensive finding content whether it be PVP or PVE that im looking for. I always thought WHs were extremely time intensive and thats what kept me from joining all these years, but at least with WHSOC I was in the home hole the day I joined and had ships and was flying in fleets within my first week.
---
In the Imperium life is great!  We have our own Jita and thousands of ships to fly. You don't need to do much to participate and every activity on EVE is coveted to some extend. From within the coalition you get forum and specialised channels info, also the numbers of players you need to run different content. Fleets go out several times per day, the nearby gate is yours to camp too. For me personally my Eve online experience had changed dramatically ever since I joined Imperium.    GF
---
Don't need more bullshit damage caps; need balance so that ships that do 15k DPS aren't cheap enough to be considered a 'throwaway'.

That's a funny way to spell Void.
---
Imud Hubrau, a lore friendly name for your titan.
---
someone should give this memo to the devs so they can fix the kiki then
---
Never not more salt
---
I was speaking specifically about APCR, yes. It has been a while since I tankd because game is not fun.
---
Honestly their main role has been for structure bashing as you just need a single leshak to hit damage cap on an astra or rat. The new vedhak is really strong in small gang and can easily keep 30km+ with nasty dps or get within 20 and push 1700+  they all have the big issue of tracking disruption and ecm tho. A good burst jam or a few coordinated disruptors ruins their dps. I have noticed they're really good at killing tackle excluding the tracking disruption situation.
---
Well yeah, but the most retarded EVE player is still more intelligent than the average WoW one.
---
Soulsborne multiplayer was pretty innovative and enjoyable imo. But you're right, not much else compares to Eve
---
That's not gambling per se. Mutaplasmids are a random roll, yes, but it's not gambling.
---
Now that you put it on Reddit, it's probably the biggest target among all Titans.
---
That’s great, and I believe you. My point was that it is eve easy mode, perhaps he wants a hard life / more “old” eve, which he won’t find in null, but maybe WHs or such.
---
As he sits in 1dq1a
---
I agree.
---
For me the biggest distinction between bigger and smaller alliances is that of individual identity, most contributions by line members in alliances larger than say 300-400 characters go completely unnoticed and make no difference to the overall performance of the group (with the exception of the contributions from leadership level personalities; usually).
---
For instance I can specifically identify the exact human being (not referring to irl identity) responsible for every single character in my alliance and every single one of the contributions by those people. This is a just a sign of a close knit group and there are certainly plenty of groups like mine in the game but I assert that the larger blocs have absolutely no concept of individual contribution with the exception of the rare individuals that excel and stand out from the crowd. Line members tend to turn into replaceable parts.
---
So basically, what it's like is to be a face in a crowd.
---
I see your flair and assume you've flown under Thomas then
---
Just try things outside the box it s fun and you will learn. There is a lot of bitterness in eve and people caring for isk per hour.
---
What is boson camping?
---
Mostly pretty good except some dum dum named koahi keeps spamming our main jabber channel with dumb stuff.
---
Yeah it’ll stay docked up for sometime while war is going on
---
I’m not doing anything with it for some time! Will stay docked until war is over
---
&gt;  Is it to overshadow, or make other sub-capitals obsolete?
---
This was also a question in your post and that's what I responded to.
---
You are correct in that large alliances won't be able to fund and/or source these ships, but I don't know why they would because these ships aren't very useful for them anyways. These aren't large blob fight ships. That's also part of the reason they exist - to have a line of ships that are useful for smaller entities and can't really be exploited by huge blobs.
---
why are you like this
---
Just to make that clear: You want Dreads to be more expensive than they are now?
---
Stop crying. 
---
They are a new ship that has pluses and minuses. A big minus is the cost just to start. 
---
They are new, different, and fun. Don’t fly them if you don’t like them.
---
OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH
---
Fun.
---
a decently programmed bot isn't, not without going absurd lenghts to do it at least. Hate to break ot to ya but most higher end bots aint the reddit bait retarded ones you people catch.
---
Why uneasy?
---
Yeah I most likely have
---
is that possible lol
---
They’re basically the new-age equivalent of introducing Pirate-faction ships. “Here’s a new kind of ship that mixes bonuses in a weird way to specialize on a play style everything else only dabbles in (Spider Tank, in this case), and within certain limitations it can fill more roles at once than anything that has come before. Also, material scarcity will make these things pricier than their contemporaries, which is kind of okay because they can potentially be *more effective* than those contemporaries.”
---
But then you factor in the unique weapon type, the Omega limitation, the focus on them in new content, the elaboration of their ship tree... and the execution is decidedly different.
---
Thanks. Good to know.
---
where do you see tears? do you think ncpl cares about some keepstars?
---
Then why do you care? You said below they don’t scare you. Don’t fly them if you don’t like them.
---
You really have to be dumb to play this game though.
---
I'll have you know I have never played PUBG in my life!
---
o7
---
"There will only ever be a few titans."
---
To add to your question of disbelief: You want Faxes, Supers, and Titans become more powerful / safer?
---
It means I injected into electronic attack frigs on my main, racial frig V on my alt, and you didn't get anything.
---
I said it *because* it's smart.
---
Why even have it then? Like you've done all this work to get it a war is the chance to use it.
---
Unless you plan on doing nothing but bosoning frigs in it or something.
---
Yeah if there is a move op I would, I don’t want to be on the walk of shame in delve right now
---
Don't let anyone tell you how to play the game.  There's a millions things you can do in Eve.  If you listen to anybody telling you what to do, then they've only experienced a small fraction of that.  Go be whatever you want, learn however you want, and enjoy yourself.
---
Just join and try it out!  Horde is great
---
1.Im planning to start moon mining with my friend with between us we have about 5-6 roruqels , if we wanted to start getting into industy what corp in test would you recommend applying too? 
---
2. How many rorquels is too many roraquels?
---
Minmatar were/are slaves, not slavers, that was the Amarr.
---
I blame the iOS reddit app, and Western Society in general.
---
Reading the responses its clear that didn't come across. Yes dread dmg when sieged goes into a separate pot when shooting a structure. Not implying ships should have a dmg cap.
---
As I said, I am referring to the average solo fit. Not to mention, it's so easy to 'counter' the Rattle's DPS by putting ECs on its Gecko or simply by harassing its drones that it absolutely does not compare to Leshak DPS.
---
Since we're talking battleship balance, let's compare a torp Rattle to a Leshak at around 1b (I spent five minutes on these fits, they're not perfect):
---
https://i.imgur.com/xnGmQMN.png
---
https://i.imgur.com/8X34qNx.png
---
The Leshak would absolutely wipe the floor with it. And in reality, the fits would be a little different to account for more than battleship vs battleship (heavy neut, no torps, etc.), which only puts the Leshak further ahead.
---
Don't get me wrong, the Rattle is one of the best battleships and I like it a lot but in terms of balance the Leshak is overall stronger and much more versatile.
---
Good catch! Edited
---
I'm suggesting halve the current ones by counting dread dmg output against structures against a separate cap. I'm not suggesting we put dmg caps on ships
---
If you’re not joining Legacy, then I’ve found provi/catch a great place to roam. 
---
If you are, idk where you’d go, maybe geminate. Horde is a bit blobby but if you come with a decent size group or are careful about picking fights you can get some good ones. Just with everything deployed to tribute I’m not sure you’ll find much to shoot at left. After the war it will be much better.
---
This battle report confuses me.
---
TIL there was a frostline analyzer.
---
I knew I should have stocked up on more of those when they came out
---
My last mentee made a billion in 5 days. He went to Stain (nullsec) and ran Sansha relic sites and was picky about it.
---
Wormholes are a lot more dangerous.
---
T1 ships are fine, but a covert cloak increases your safety, not your isk. If you're in space with a lot of sansha sites, people ARE hunting explorers, because that's where the good explo isk is.

Absolutely not, caps and supercaps just aren't quite disposable enough yet. In fact, why not 'Board my Dreadnought' instead of 'Board my Corvette'?

---
How do I get my alliance to show up next to my name here?
---
Why better? Half the fucking map including formerly thriving space like hek and rens is a deadzone because all the scrubs went to be scrubs in null. Give them their fucking incursions back.
---
Obviously the latter are an even bigger problem.
---
Notably CVA won't shoot you unless you try to take a site from someone.
---
Ideally I would probably prefer a smaller group. It is a game after all and with a small group you can get to know people a little and that does make the game much more enjoyable. One big thing that has made me think of being a face in the crowd for a bit is the desire to fly caps and not just turbo crab with them. Do you see a lot of GF's with caps in the smaller scale groups?
---
Here I disagree equi, what you only say is true of alliances where alliance leadership doesn't have an intimate relationship with their member base, obviously the larger the group the more difficult it becomes.
---
I say this because at least with my group there is no distinction between corps and corp recruitment and alliance recruitment; indeed nobody is recruited whatsoever into any corp without alliance leadership level interviews.  We aren't the only group that's like this too; PL in their era of dominance was infamous for it's recruitment threads and procedures.
---
I guess what i'm saying is that corp identity is only important for groups where the alliance identity is too nebulous and promulgating one corp over another is the best that can be achieved.
---
Honestly the opportunities I’ve had in GSF have been pretty amazing, fleets are usually always fun, very helpful community and everything is strategically set up. Not sure if I’d be able to afford this or most of my ships if I wasn’t here.
---
If you're an "amoral prick" and cherry pick the good cans, fail the bad ones so the site respawn timer for the constellation starts. It will increase your isk/hr if you stay out for more than 20 minutes.

Dun goofed.
---
A serious shout-out to FC's everywhere - on my side, on the other side, and across the game.  The unbelievable amount of time and effort you devote to making the game so fun for the rest of us is woefully underappreciated, and I'm doing my bit to address that.  THANK YOU, FC'S!
---
The dumb ones that troll sites so they don't respawn? Yeah. Bubble camp those little shits.
---
wondered who was in the gif, it's too small for me to see
---
Didn't get pornmaker, you only killed his wannabe underlings
---
That sounds like a you problem
---
62 dreads and one carrier just “happened” to be ready to jump .... nice bait, objective achieved.
---
This sounds like a fun challenge. I'll take a look at how fleet logs work and see if I can duct tape something together after work today. Do you happen to have any fleet log exports on hand you could throw at me to work off of and test with?
---
Reasons I do explo in an interceptor.
---
Wait, there are rigs to increase strength now? I thought there were only rigs for coherence.
---
EVE still lack of time consuming competition like other MMORPG do, that's why I still play WoW on an high level (nooooooo I never multibox mythic raid and in game mining/gate camp that's not true)
---
What purpose do any of us fill?
---
Are we talking about a community fill with dirty superblob and high sec afk miner ?
---
Congrats on reaching a milestone, may you enjoy the many good fights with it to come  good luck on your next project o7
---
This is amazing and thank you for sharing. Brings me back to old days, LV, RED, FE and the max campaings. loved the time then but was younger as well, it all gets different once the wow factor of a first time event is gone. not sure what can happen in todays eve that could surprise me....
---
Large alliances won't use them outside of the rare fleet because of supply, not isk. Pirate battleships are roughly same cost and used relatively often. But if you welp a single fleet of trig ships, have fun sourcing another.
---
We need more data before making conclusions
---
underrated comment
---
That's a fair answer. Makes sense. I hope there is one so you get a chance to use it!
---
Good man, that game is hot garbage.
---
Gang banged is more like it
---
This is correct to an extent. This is referencing small arms and is for Nova, though it's not necessarily planetside. AEGIS is the CONCORD section formed to fight against the increase in pirate activity and boarding actions going on as a part of Nova.
---
You were closest without going over.
---
uh I main 2nd support in Overwatch, play a bit of league, spam discord. And oh yeah I go on a fleet to press F1 sometimes.
---
well sure, but i mean you don't "apply" to goons, or test, or pl. you apply to a corp in pl, or dreddit or some corp in test or some corp in goons. Your alliance is more akin to a larger corp, as well, its basically 200 chars (which is basically my corp) so i would say that its slightly different for your alliance vs mine, as there are smaller corps that have less activity and or different tzs (as some are koriean, or aus, or eu or us majority wise) and well, not saying its hard to be in a corp with low activity, and still be active in alliance, i just don't think it would be as beneficial and or helpful to people to join smaller corps for people moving into null. 
---
Granted I think that if you have alot of history in it and or ability, smaller corps are sometimes okay, but i've found that alot of times if the leadership goes stale so does the corp, and then the corps become slowly inactive. looking at your alliance on zkill for example is 1-2 chars pvping in a corp basically means its a corp of 1 person, and if i was going to tell someone to join your alliance i would suggest your corp or maybe 1 other, fatal, as they seem to have some sort of pvp activity of more than 1 char. So essentially your alliance IS mostly just 1/2 corp, with a few smaller 1/2/3 man corps as well. 
---
But i also am not sure i'm free to comment on big block as i'm just a medium :)
---
who would win? 2 supercarriers w/ 1 fax each or 182781728 dreads?
---
Lost my vote after this conversation. Fly safe
---
So dreads killed some supers? AAR plz
---
Oh, so the increase in pirate activity is also tied to Nova?
---
I don’t have the link right now but hoping someone who sees this does. My Corp has a spreadsheet they use that makes the salvage breakdown/payouts easy. Generally used for L4 fleets but I can’t see why it couldn’t be modified to work for this purpose. If no one else links here before I get home this evening I will attempt to find it and leave the link here in the comments. There is definitely a spreadsheet for this somewhere. :)
---
im so poor i actually plex with isk
---
cuz the even was perfection manifested
---
They do the same thing as their non-faction counterparts, just shinier and stronger
---
&gt; still remember many a day rushing home on my lunch break to switch skill training 
---
I cannot deny that I may have done this once or twice back in 2007
---
Be very wary of whom you take advice from during your journey. There is a mass of complete retards thinking they are the next shit because they figured out how to wipe their own ass. Caldari is the best race because of cyno fuel and because you get a free jump clone 3 jumps from jita. Gl in your eve.
---
afk farming can make me rich, with enough accounts ofc. !m plex just extra bil per account

git gud

True alpha males, silver back, with beard of a viking woodcutter, fly only Minmatar. (.  -_-)
---
yeah I'm losing and it feels bad after looking at my SP more closely.  
---
It is annoying--I didn't realize rockets were separate from missiles till it was too late, I'd already trained a bunch of shit.

https://i.imgur.com/Sh0CJD5.png
---
Damn kebabs
---
Not what I said. If you can't handle possibly losing it while you are gone then don't own one. Asset safety is a crutch that you null sec people think you need. One of the balances to titans used to be that you were pretty much stuck in it. Or always had to plan where you log off ect. That's all gone and so is the risk that goes alone with it. There is a reason everyone and their dog owns a titan now. It's just not good for the game.
---
Cograts Mr bee. Remeber that owning the hull is only half of titan ownership, the other half is getting an awesome skin
---
Lame
---
Yeah I have the cold iron, I want the capsuleer one but it’s pretty pricey right now. I’ve got it all faction fit already as well
---
AAR for those need it. Tired of losing supers/titans in Delve to the beeb, Goons decide to bait out the most dunce people in Snuffed Out, the JF gankers. Once the bait was set, they just had to wait for the small brains to take it and then the trap was sprung.
---
Uh-oh....
---
thank you for fixing the formatting, I unfortunately do not have a solution to your problem.
---
If you already have Amazon Prime, just link it to that and it's free so long as you have Amazon Prime, of course Amazon need your card details, which I dont think is that bad considering they probably have 80% of the western worlds card deets
---
I like the Star Captain skin for Avatars. The event one is really good too. I'm sure there are other good ones, those are the ones i can remember off the top of my head
---
Most guides regarding tactics to prevent ganking are still relevant I think (less than X ammount of isk in cargo, webbing/scout alt, chokepoints to avoid, etc).
---
Besides that, ask around in Hauler's channel and/or contact Red/Black Frog.
---
Once you start to pop pods, there is no going back. XD
---
You do know even small alliances build and own supers and titans, right? You don't need to be part of the blob to build them.
---
However, it does make it safer to use them when you're just one in a hundred (or more) of them lmao
---
And yes. Trust the Rust. Minmatar ships is the right anser, no matter the question. Don't follow that satanic slavers with their fancy looking ships.
---
You do realise that every coalition wil nowl make it their #1 priority to divest you of said titan?
---
Well, sometimes invasion spawn at the hs-ls edge. For example, Heydieles was invaded.
---
Exactly, thanks for proving my point that it influences the in-game
---
I’ll be at the correct machine soon, and will see if I have a log I haven’t broken available, if not I’ll save some from tonight’s fleet.
---
Lame like ganking jump freighters?

Don't forget the people on comms also that sound like they are playing inside a steel mill.

Or you know, log your titan off at a safe like everyone else used to. That's the problem with all these hand holding mechanics, they make the player base dumber.
---
I'm new to Eve and creating a character. It's telling me that they name I've chosen is already taken, but [evewho.com](https://evewho.com) is telling me that there's no pilot by that name. Assuming EveWho is working fine (my friends character shows up in it without a problem) why would the game be telling me the name is unavailable if there's no existing character by that name?
---
Then be the best miner you can.  Learn what ships to use, what modules, how to avoid ganks, how to transport it, what to do with the ores, etc etc.  When you get bored, try something new and keep working towards new goals. Or don't, Eve is whatever you want it to be.
---
lol no
---
Why don't you find out for yourself? Just make an alt and join an alliance like Pandamic Horde, which unlike most alliances, has literally zero entrance barrier and also has their space right next to the Forge/Jita.
---
It literally can't get any easier to get an instant taste of what it's like to be in a big block alliance.

its a sed lyfe

It will make you rich though.

Great stuff, thanks for posting!

Delete subcaps

only 200kk with fitting.

my condolences

The imperial jubilee one has racing stripes.
---
*Racing stripes.*
---
drifter
---
who cares?
---
sure
---
This really resonates with me. I started EVE when I was about 18, I am 30 now and I never could find a game that compared to EVE. I've quit too many times to remember only to come back.
---
Me too
---
u/ThatOneClone Do it for the racing stripes
---
The few times I have had to do it for my employer, I would break the script down into smaller pieces and read/record them over and over until I got it right. It got easier as I practiced and I found myself making fewer mistakes by the time I almost had it memorized. I hope I have helped. o7
---
Negligible
---
Now lets see some in action pics.
---
OP take this advice.
---
I grew absolutely enamored with EVE. Creating corporations, forming bonds with new people, and establishing some of the top small gang corps really got the better of me. My obsession with EVE was a contributing factor to me dropping out of university twice, losing a girlfriend, and being a generally unhappy person.
---
It took a cold turkey break for me to graduate university, and get a solid job. I'm back now after that long break and only a few of my friends were still playing. Despite this, many of them now our returning to EVE because we all enjoyed the good times we had back in the day! What /r/CCP_Falcon says is true, EVE will be here always to come back to. It's hard sometimes to grasp that, but don't get sucked in by competing in the rat race.
---
I love this game, but don't let it run your life.
---
except the trig invasions have a drone damage and hp penalty...
---
Appreciated!
---
There is also a movie about it now: [Ender's Game (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1731141/)
---
somewhere around 20.368.757.500
---
The history of this corp is really discouraging.
---
Bragging about how many contracts the company you clean toilets for has doesn't mask how completely ignorant you are about this. 
---
&gt; monthly revenue of PLEX, logged in account average or subscribed account numbers are typical key numbers for a software like this .
---
I'm gonna need you to explain to me how an event that lasted less than one month is intended to boost metrics over the period of a contract with a term of substantially longer than one month.
---
If the event led to increased metrics that persisted beyond the termination of the event - well gee Sherlock _I think it fucking worked._ The situation you described (CCP staging an event for a transient bump in metrics in order to satisfy metrics over the long term of a contract) is so fucking pants-on-head stupid that the only thing that could possible make it more funny is you saying it with such _confidence._
---
Snuff joins goons to buy cheap supers, leaves goons, gets ships blown up by goons. The circle of life is complete.
---
I was going to write some clever metaphor to explain nullsec bloc life, but honestly it's just a smorgasborg of choice in terms of activity. You're exposed to all kinds of players, good and bad, and while there are rules to follow they're typically straightforward. There's always a bit of drama, but it gets sorted by the herd eventually, and with a good, active corp that welcomes newbros and hosts training sessions/fleets you can get exposure to many different styles of gameplay without worrying too much about ruining your wallet.
---
If you've never tried, it's worth doing it once. There's no obligation to stay forever.
---
underappreciated addendum
---
That was a good night. I was living next door in okkamon back then. I made billinions looting that fight. Bouncing off Titans trying to get out of bubble with my wares.
---
Just keep an eye on the EveNorth Discord, we won't let you down.
---
Pretty much, whenever anyone mentions an MMO they're playing I have to check if it's single-shard permadeath and usually it's not.
---
No one is talking about it, so it's either really good or really bad isk/hr.
---
Invasion can make you 0 isk for 3 hours and then git the jackpot and make 1 billion. That's why people say it's not worth. Also, you need to go with a fleet.
---
Philippe, you know we don't use skype... lol 
---
As one of the local organizers (Apo, btw), I can tell you it's entirely up to Falcon, until he gives us something to do.
---
How much isk?
---
FYI, doesn't take more than 10 mins to setup to a previous state, you just have to be aware of what changes need to be made.
---
well apparently you can't even read the first sentence so...
---
The "eve was so much better" is stupid and boring and not productive...
---
An honest question: In what block are you in? Cause usually only ppl that are dominating the battlefield say that the current game is "handholding". Not the actual small alliances fighting, not the FCs leading the fleets nor the logistics that organize stuff, set up the citadel chains and fuel them, no. Only ELITIST PVP *shitonthePVEr* type of guy talks like this...
---
I think it all has to do with the loot.
---
Then raped to death, have your flesh eaten, and your skin sewn into clothing.
---
And if youre very lucky, it will happen in that order.
---
That's the single dumbest idea I've ever heard, hope he doesn't get voted in
---
Pornmaker almost got me the other day, I was JFing a large batch of stuff into Aurohunen and a cyno Impairor kept lighting a cyno for a Rhea that was coming through when I did. I thought nothing of it really after the Rhea came through, but on my very last run, as I was aligning to gate (not warping), through the cyno comes Pornmaker.
---
Needless to say I hit that fucking CTRL-Spacebar so fast it almost broke in two and docked before he got the torps off. Very sphincter-tightening there.
---
You can now quit Eve. Congrats!
---
Imagine if these are the only super kills if they deployment
---
Brohamo probably before he left.
---
Great book. If you liked it read the sequels. This is one of those rare cases where the sequels are so much better then the original. And the original is great to begin with.
---
Eve-hr.com has a new fleet tool.
---
Agreed.
---
Shitty, homophobic author tho.
---
Well... I don't own a Titan, I always wanted a Levi. That's a point, Avatar's judgement is sexy. But do we even see them during potato tidi fights?
---
I only started using dreads and carriers in PvP, so a Titan...
---
It all makes sense when you come to realize that IQ stands for autIsm Quotient.
---
Is it still true that targetting in EVE is done alphabetically and so it makes more sense to have a character whose first name’s first letter is later in the alphabet?
---
I'm right there with you, Goonbrother. I started playing in 2006 and my first Titan comes out next week. I didn't even have to krab all that much. Most of the isk came from various cons and from selling brain juice (I already have the skills I need anyway).
---
The doomsday does 3 billion damage but takes 3 hours to charge up.
---
Do you mean to tell me that people who play other games are even dumber?
---
First thing that happens : you're lost because you don't know what to do.
---
Most corps/alliances have a newbro carepackage program. You'll be given  free cheap ships to use, if you lose them again people will give you more. I was in Brave and received free ships, jobs, it was fun. I was in hord and the same happened. Lots of love for newbros in there. In hord I knew more the game so I even gave free ships (a few VNI, but more important T1 ships , scanning frigs, indus ships).
---
So first thing to do is notify you are newbro and ask the newbro resources you should learn. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Corps have lots of toools to manage what you can do : intelligence tools to not go in a system that is being camped, or extract from a system that will be soon ; mining tools to know what moons will pop and when ; defense fleet to participate in denfese ; industry tools to know what you can use, for who, when ; fleet tools to know what is programmed, etc.
---
Your fist goal when joining ANY corporation is to make bonds with people, in order to know what you can do with them. just find out who is mining, who like to sit all day ready to warp on the first WWW that pops in defense chat, who needs WH information to prepare a bombing  run, who will gladly use his BS to micro roam the next systems with you, etc. know people, you will be given chances to participate in the corporation life and that's your goal to ENJOY the game.
---
Also participate in a few training fleets to understand what is expected from people in stratops, and later on participate in said stratops.  Remember, an atron costs less than 5M but can be the tackle that will allow to destroy a much more expensive ship (often at the cost of said atron :P ), and/or defend an ally against a dangerous threat. defender dessies are always worth bringing even in a BS fleet. A salvage catalyst can help a super increase the worth of its sites, eg for 50% of the loot, and having someone present in the next systems allow for better intelligence .
---
Oh since then I’ve probably read Enders Game over 20 times and the entire series about twice. Might be time for another read through!
---
Which one do you have in the oven? That’s exciting! Any plans to move it to the war?
---
The doctors do tell me my sodium intake is too high
---
In keeping with the theme for current reddit posting;
---
Doesn't count because something about unused citadels
---
Doesn't count because something about being deployed and your doing Snuff a favour.
---
Also, compulsory Fuck Snuff

---
We do do a lot of circle jerking in EVE
---
and to think... all he had to do was join goons and learn to crab like a real pro!  
---
Some day... when I grow up... I'm gonna join goons too and have that win button right next to my numpad.
---
A big one and maybe.
---
Back in my day son.... there was no queue.   
---
Much sleep was lost on those days.
---
~15m ISK mining the ore at the conduits for a hour in two T2 fit ventures, not worth my time, I had fun with the mining fleet there through.
---
I flew home last night and bumped into a gas site, made double that in the first 15 minutes.
---
I used to set my alarm clock for odd times just to train over some new skill.
---
Oxygen 
---

---
Sleep
---
Food
---
Yes, humans survive longer without food than sleep. 
---
Sleep depritation can cause pernament damage(like insanity). A radio host did a stupidly long maraton, and it ruined him. 
---
There was a study somewhere where they tested how long it takes the brain to return to "normal" state it was before the test period of not sleeping at all for X days. Turns out it doesnt on the scans, at all. Ever.
---
shit
---
thank you for not banning me from r/eve for the crazy shit i say sometimes. i spend too much time in jita and it has caused some of my wiring to get crossed. o7
---
all the isk.
---
Things changed on Tuesday. Things do not seem to have changed since then.
---
AEGIS was originally formed to deal with Case green magic which means this is likely part of the plot leading up to Project Nova.
---
I'm building my leviathan now and the only names I've thought of are minamikaze doragon.
---
I decided to name it in Japanese since caldari tend to have Asian names
---
I pretty much left when they killed the Clan Wars sandbox with constant henpecking.  Ironically that's a large part of what led me to Eve, because the sandbox of Clan Wars was brilliantly fun to play and watch and talk about.  Even more ironically, goons in that game were very much on the elite side of the pubbie vs elite war.
---
These AARs are lacking in the details that make these stories so fun!!!  How was the trap prepped, how was it sprung, what type of a defensive response was mounted, if any?  Did initial tackle survive? 
---
Make a little effort in the AARs for those of us not sitting on grid and you’ll be the hero that r/eve needs to spice up the tryhard kill-mail posts with shit for background details.
---
Depends. How good are you at ninja looting?
---
Knowing is half the battle, and knowledge is power!
---
Toll rds what great idea , i never undock now if i had to pay to jump id never undock again
---
The true war is coming...
---
May we all be spared by the new War in Heaven!
---
Loot and salvage, but folks in groups are around and will steal and go suspect, but if you open fire their friends are going to get you, so you need a fleet with dedicated salvagers that you will need to baby sit.
---
If you dscan fast you can get to a group of Triglaves first, but it’s sketchy all around.
---
Duuuuude, thats by far one of the coolest books I have ever read. Funny story, I actually read "Enders Shadow" first then found out about all the other one in the series. Amazing book, and grats on the titan!
---
Eve isn't permadeath although deaths can result in significant losers.  Still miss Asheron's Call Darktide which was similar although one of several servers for the game.
---
Goons are making friends again I see
---
I think they planned it for a year?
---
about tree fiddy
---
Thank you, fixed.
---
The minerals I mine are free, so I always make a profit manufacturing!!"
---
Yeah no, EVE is full of stupid fucks too.
---
Please use a remote desktop solution to save yourself from this.
---
I was using the DDNS+VPN on my router to do Remote Desktop, but am using Chrome Remote Desktop because I got a new router and am to lazy to set all that back up.
---
at least there are the rigs to fall back on
---
Ok, so there are two types of fleet logs, one is the loot log, which is useful and there are plenty of parsers for if you are trying to figure out how much was looted by who, honestly i don't care about this as I assume honesty of the folks I fly with and don't need to spy on what they pick up.  This is the only log with a direct export button in the client.
---
The member log has the information I do want, but no easy structured export.  An example of what it spits out when you copy and past the log from the fleet window:
---
&gt;!19:17:10 - Nariana Frost left fleet!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:16:59 - Jagahati now has role Squad Commander!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:16:56 - Nariana Frost now has role Squad Member!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:16:53 - Nariana Frost now has role Squad Commander!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:16:37 - Jagahati needs shield (Sleipnir)!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:13:11 - Nariana Frost joined as Squad Member!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:07:46 - Nariana Frost left fleet!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:07:23 - Jagahati is at location Charmerout!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:06:25 - Nariana Frost joined as Squad Member!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:06:07 - Nariana Frost left fleet!&lt;
---
&gt;!19:05:49 - Nariana Frost joined as Squad Member!&lt;
---
Which is fine until you put it into a format you can do something with and loose all the &lt;CR&gt;'s  when I tried I kept running into issues with the fact that EVE names can contain spaces, numbers and even dashes, this made parsing tricky. Perhaps I just don't know the right tricks?
---
Wish this thing had an instruction manual. Looks great but can't figure out where to begin O.o
---
The same has happened to me over the course of 14 years
---
I'll allow it
---
I really hope you're flairbaiting
---
Mine says I had a sodium deficiency and recommended salt tablets, I installed eve instead.
---
Isn’t that a lot easier now with the Agency?
---
All the serious null blocks have an out of alliance JF service that can move anything you need from Jita to nullsec for you usually for a very reasonable rate, just create a new character on your existing account (or move an existing one) to Jita for when you need to buy things.
---
That's nice I suppose, but not really in line with the core of EVE. This wasn't meant to be a casual game, if you can't put effort in you shouldn't reap rewards.
---
Damn those goon pilots sure were skilled to drop 40 dreads on 2 super carriers.
---
If they messed with overview settings people would be upset as well, enter new situations cautiously and adapt.
---
Hey, when the Factional Warfare change came and 5 guys got together with a spreadsheet to compute how to manipulate the market to figure out how to get more out of the interaction than they put in, AND keeping in mind that the variable that stored that information most likely was a 32-bit variable, meaning they could not exceed the 32-bit variable limit, you could be forgiven for thinking you were dealing with some pretty smart cookies.
---
Versus: people whining about a drop in a game that is not rare and that can be had again with some effort...
---
It’s not a game for everyone. It’s not a place where the lazy thrive.
---
The long lost community spotlights!

Never not shoot the HIC's

---
I'm unclear how EVE HR works, or how it's fleet tool works.  
---
As far as i can tell it is a way to track your corp and hand out LP like other MMO's have DKP.  Since I'm a veteran(victim) of such systems I have little interest in getting invovled in them in EVE.
---
I would rather remove something than be forced to add something every patch. And hey wouldnt it be a wonder if it was just a popup.. Hey these entities are new would you like us to add them to your OV? Cool thx. But this is CCP.
---
James is much too sexy to take that bait.
---
Yeah that was a piece of 'Eve hard mode' that is better off left well behind.
---
The one where you dont finish installing the game.
---
It's happened before.
---

I haven't been able to find a whole lot on it though.
---
Holy shit I’m canon
---
Also a chance that the ship is damaged beyond repair.
---
Gf
---
Twitch or it didn’t happen.
---
Would it give you extra fitting as well??
---
Also buy lootboxes now!
---
This is so real.
---
the agency sucks! It will always suck!
---
Congrats! :D
---
Not to mention jf pilot tears are premium
---
Hey if it gets him a free month of rent from NC, i would do it too.
---
I read this in a Russian accent. I hope you're Russian. Also I agree.
---
And an effective means of communication!
---
because eve sucks and should die
---
I gave much to the Empire. But I never got anything but salty agents talking back. Jamyl lied.
---
A random enemy renter tells you in local the position of two of the best bait ships ever invented and recomends you jump them... not suspicious at all.
---
Don't get me wrong... I'm glad to see 7sins eat it... but damn... overkill much?
---
Yeah, totally balanced!
---
good luck on your move.
---
Are all major corps anti-fun like pandemic horde ? It seems that every harmless joke offends the directors and NBIs ...
---
That would be a dumb way to balance it. Just make it cost more if you're going to balance it like that. Saves hassle and annoyance for no reason. Should be like 400 calibration too.
---
Awesome, I should definitely be able to do something with that. My bash knowledge is very limited so if I wrote a parser for this in that it'd be a satanic pile of pipes.
---
Using a language I'm more familiar with (like VB or Java) I think it would be pretty easy to use regex to cut out the irrelevant information and generate a CSV that would look something like this:
---
    CharacterName,TimeSpentInFleet[,Join/Leave Timestamps] (linebreak)
---
Character names in EVE are 3-37 characters long, can contain the character set [A-Za-z 0-9+'-] (forgive me if my regex is trash) however the first and last characters are limited to alphanumeric characters only. I also notice in the log that the name *always* follows the timestamp and a hyphen. Separating between the first hyphen in the string and "joined" should make it pretty easy (unless someone has "joined" in their name, but fuck that person. We can work around that anyway.)
---
Even without linebreaks, we can determine where an event starts/ends by the format of the timestamp. From what I can see, nothing in the middle of an event should ever share the same format as a timestamp.
---
I'm off work in 3 hours, mind PMing me a copy of the raw txt file so I can experiment with it?
---
Good choice in literature
---
This makes me sad and happy all at once lol
---
Lasers are magic.
---
What's next? The 07 show makes a comeback?
---
Lots of biscuits eaten
---
Lame like pretending flair baiting is a thing.

Make it use contaminated lorentz fluids
---
I used be a gamer, now I just read EvE articles...
---
because we only started spoonfeeding retards in the last few years, before that people didn't need their hands holding quite so much.
---
nah, that's part of how it's balanced. you'd get extra slots but you might have to meta things to fit them in
---
that's how they tried to balan ce titans thogh and that didnt really work all that well
---
Are there rigs for strength? I only see ones for coherence. Did you mean coherence?
---
The blackglass and the zeugma looks nice but they are like 44 mil and 170 mil. I cant afford that. Thank you for the advice.
---
yh
---
Made about 1 bil/hr sniping zorya a week earlier when the skill books are crazy expensive
---
The one thing I am struggling with is my Viru's strenght as I fail to hack some of the sites. From what I understand the viru's strength comes from:
---
Ship role
---
Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 (44 mil+)
---
lvl 1/ 2 data/relic analyzer vs Zeugma Integrated Analyze which (170mil+)
---
Where else can I get Virus strength from?
---
oh yeah
---
Well now how am I supposed to bait people with NPC damage types on my bio?
---
You forgot
---
Salvager I
---
The most amazing and perfect circle jerks of any game.  Ever.
---
I see what you did there.
---
How about a rig that makes your ship screaming "Reeeeeeeeeee" when gets hitted
---
I will do you one better and get you a ‘full one” of actual fleet data to go through, I should have plenty by the time you are ready to do anything with it.
---
I just remembered I forgot to restart my training after my omega got renewed crap
---
Can a rei forced poco be traded?

As long as there is something done about local, to which cloaking up in a system till people ignore you is the only counter.

tf is that

are you whorus

The real lose here is the large rigs. Good bye legendary fittings. We will miss you.
---
Bagged a PH one in m-o last week.
---
Just your ship. Covops &gt; Astero &gt; T1 explo frigate, as far as I'm aware, and your analyzer.
---
Don't try to run relics in an interceptor without a T2, or Zeugma+Blackglass (which I don't have/can't use).
---
The invasion space has huge penalty on drone damage and drone speed in case you missed it
---
Title says for the ones who are interested. If you don't, you can just skip this
---
When a hordeling leaves EVE for WoW the average IQ rises in both communities.
---
That’s a low bar
---
Leave them there, duh.
---
Katana Knight is one of his alts im almost positive.
---
There's no alliance in the game that lacks potential targets.  Anyone telling you otherwise is propaganda.
---
I agree, but your idea of balance with randomness is exactly the same. e.g. imagine if the titan build job had a random chance to fail, and didn't return any materials when it did. That's basically the same as making titans cost more in the long term.
---
But Dave had to walk up hill to google and type on some keys in a blizzard for that info, these new kids just don't understand how hard it was and how much of a better player it makes Dave.
---
that would require to engage with the invasion content which isn't worth it
---
until you've reached the warp threshold, you only press align precisely for this reason. only click warp once you're aligned and at sufficient speed; 
---
also, an emergency cyno that's not tethered counts as dead
---
[More interested in the 2nd tweet tbh.](https://i.imgur.com/x1GcX5n.png)
---
yeah fuck half a month of free game time who needs that shit right?
---
The nice thing about the "replaceable parts" bit is that you're replaceable.  You can take a month break from eve without your shit going unfueled.  Your alliance doesn't fall apart when your main FC leaves.  There are always people to stock ships on contracts.  And you probably don't need to worry about leaving the game for three months and finding your super in asset safety (unless you join panfam).
---
Normally, owners have very limited actions concerning their structures if they are reinforced, particularly on moving, disabling or modifying them, since it could make the opponent’s efforts worthless.
---
I can’t give you a clear answer, but I’d say no.
---
Don’t really know, but there’s been a lot of hate and memes against TAPI some weeks ago because they’re basically trying to blue every threat to them. Which is quite funny, and fun/content breaker.
---
But to be honest, if Pandemic Horde’s Command is offended by a bunch of jokes on Reddit, on the game’s forums or in Local, they shouldn’t be in their places first.
---
Back when rigs were first introduced to the test server back in the day they had rigs that changed slot loadouts. iirc they would take 250 calibration points and add a single hml slot of your choosing with no drawback. There were also ones that would remove one hml slot and add 2 hml slots for 300 calibration. These ones had different draw backs such as reduced cpu, pg, or cap.
---
The idea was scrapped in lieu of T3 Cruisers.
---
Tabbing out and googling to achieve the same result makes an elite, bittervet Ne
---
I bet he is so elite that was the brilliant mind that came up with the idea of pasting that info in the bio of his character... all the rest are just pretenders that don't understand his strugle to aquire that knowledge.
---
At first glance this appears to be quite ill conceived. game balance would go out the window regardless of your use of the word. it simply causes a huge variance in the system, which invalidates any sense of balance. the rn-gesus nature of the rig populating into High, Medium, or Low is lame af as the desired configuration is easily achieved by rolling rigs. Personally I would like to see a greater understanding of these concepts in CSM candidates, buy you still have some time :)
---
It depends. If you’re talking about PVE, rats will often change targets to pick the "most dangerous ship" for them, even if it’s still fucked up because CCP. Like, they’d rather shoot a Griffin that failed a jam, rather than the VNI’s drones or the battleship murdering them.
---
In PVP, it all come down to the player’s personal skills at picking off important target, so the name usually doesn’t matter to a good PVPer. However, if their Overview is fucked up and they actually class it by name, yeah, that’s what have a character name starting with Z would be interesting.
---
Otherwise, I don’t really see where this has a tactical advantage...
---
All it takes is 1 good boson
---
Maybe evewho.com isn’t working properly, or maybe you picked the name of a character that got deleted, but the game still considered the username to be taken.
---
Incursions are still a good ISK maker. I can make usually between 105 Mn/hr and 175 Mn/hr on a single account flying with Warp to Me (even more if multiboxing is on), which is definitely good ISK. Another good way to make ISK is to join a large alliance (like Horde \*nudge\* \*nudge\* \*wink\* \*wink\*) and buy a cheap T1 ship with a decent cargo hold and sit in standing fleet waiting for ratters to call that they have salvage available. You can make a really nice amount of ISK doing this, especially if people are super ratting.
---
Beyond that, exploration *can* make you a decent amount of ISK, if you know what you're doing and you get lucky. Exploration is a bit inconsistent in incomes but tends to be both fun and profitable.
---
"I just waterboarded Triumvirate caps enough that they couldn't show up to the battle of X47 where CO2 caps got slaughtered." - Farmstink, probably.
---
Fuck off Sathas
---
Is Arrow doing Hers or did she withdraw?
---
Yes, show them you're not smart enough, to even check show info on rats.
---
Sure but my point still stands. And nothing is preventing people from tackling with force recons that don't show on dscan or other inventive ways that take away the preys options to leave. Just like in the rest of eve.
---
When one or more Titan-class ships stay near a high traffic gate, and use a special Doomsday device that doesn’t need target lock and can hit subcapitals if aimed right. They can basically oneshot any subcapital in the game if it doesn’t warp away quickly enough, or isn’t specially tanked against the DD.
---
If frat purged bots they'd have nothing left.
---
By “optional”, I meant “going there at all is optional”
---

oh and the people who key up on global so they can let everybody hear them laughing at a joke, or the people who key up on global and crack open a beer or rip a bong
---
listen buddy
---
don't forget about that horde idiot who fed his titan in m-o
---
Put guns on something and come to GE. We'll show you a good time.
---
but ccp doesn't play the game...
---
Then please don’t drop supers on our stabber roams in catch
---
Talk to the guys in r/evetech. There are fleet API end points. You could maybe write a script that periodically logs who’s in the fleet.
---
Truth.  Eve ruined all other mmos for me as well.  Nothing even congress close as far as player driven content,  permanence of your own actions and achievements , And  the pvp is in a class of its own.
---
I think she's one of the five that do though.
---
Incursions are still a good isk source, other than that VNI ratting in null will cover FW plexes PVP quite reliably.
---
Will depend where you want to PVP and flying what of course, but those are "decent" low effort isk making activities.
---
Just leave 1000 dreads after deployment in north. So each time NCPL try to raise their head you can send a ping and see them hiding again.
---
Dropping carrier good idea?
---
Never did exploration back when I played, got a good guide on it?
---
"cover FW plexes PVP quite reliably."
---
I'm not sure what you mean?
---
When an alliance made up of renters wont trust the words of a renter :(((((
---
Someone was a huffin' for a scruffin' 
---
would be nice if they did this to all bots though and not just bots that were set up to mine the wrong stuff first.
---
Honestly they are all the same. That being said, the economic capital of the universe is in Jita, a system in Caldari space, and you will be spending a lot of time in Jita no matter where you live, so it might be best to set up your first character in Caldari.
---
&gt;I’ll always be thankful for the great community.
---
Sorry. You must be confused.  This is Reddit, not Pinterest.
---
White dudes can have dreads too....
---
How quickly were you ganked afterwards?
---
10 seconds later
---
PVP in Lowsec, specially around the Faction Warfare plexes (whit acceleration gates that limit the size of the ships that get into them) is usually done in T1/Navy frigates and destroyers (you see everything, but mostly those ship classes, Assault Frigs are also very popular, and Pirate ships are considered OP so many run from them), what makes it a really cheap way to have PVP action.
---
The fuck does code have to do with this?
---
I somehow get the feeling CCP would manage to *add* structure timers if this happened.
---
At least in Null they can be content
---
Basically just fit up a covops frigate and head out to null (usually using WHs as your best bet to avoid gate camps) and run data/relic sites until you're full or have enough isk you don't want to risk dying.

my bank number my gf so sad oww well have fun laughing.

Gee. It's not in a 1,000 peoples bio or can copy from a website and paste to notepad in game.
---
Tonight: null sec content killers content kill low sec content killers. More to come at 9
---
Making me rich in Albion online with eve scams though so there's that. Fresh meat boys 😂😂
---
Something went wrong with the copy and paste. I went back and compared folder sizes and there was a large mismatch. I think that was the problem. Will try again.
---
You're welcome Mate! Fly Safe!
---
I only run Sansha's improved GPUs.
---
imagine being baited this hard
---
there is rental space in Period Basis
---
Yea, alliance needs to do. Leadership is the #1 problem. Lack of guidance. There was many reasons they were removed from winterco.
---
odd that they were just booted though :/

Always [blown-away](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3dfa4n/thanks_for_staying_at_work_to_fix_tranquility_ccp/ct4umww/) by CCP Karkur.
---
How about...
---
I always wondered why people put that info in their bio. Don't people know that eve has a notepad feature. 
---
Must be helpful for newer people trying to gank them. Let's you know what dmg type not to use.
---
Memory and spredsheets, i know whey they expire (synchronized) and they always have a never ending training queue, so..
---
Do not start to mine.
---
I am assuming you live in a developed country, so, it will take a lot of knowledge, time and effort to make more "in game money" than money in real life.
---
Mining can actually be fun (if you are a weird, like me), but there are much more funny stuff to do in eve.
---
Do the math, you might earn much more "plexes" in real life than you can do in game.
---
if you still want to follow that dark path: there is not a trick, just a lot of alts, hauler, booster and thats it
---
&lt;Eve Doctor&gt; There is a cure for that:   take two injectors and ping me in the morning.
---
Good for you! Fly safe my dude
---
Interesting that the last time TAPI deployed to Gem to shoot horde they went home defeated...
---
Even though it's exactly what you're asking for.
---
I kinda did the math Nd it was a bit of numbers lol
---
Bean is my favorite character.  Having read them all he's the best ihmo
---
wat?
---
It's not about numbers, in WH space force multipliers are king and an outnumbered group can win a fight against a more numerous opponent that doesnt have any force multipliers.
---
EVE is *the best* mmo for playing casually.  You can leave for three months and come back without finding all your gear is now worse than random green drops.
---
As a Rustyboi myself, I approve!
---
hmmm yes, quite

Congratulations. :)

You need to complete that.

Use your actual log file.  The default directory is C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\EVE\logs\Fleetlogs and C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\EVE\logs\Gamelogs depending on what specific info you want.  It generates a new file every time you open the client.
---
your stupid comments on offering up ships in our public channel were, well, stupid.

I don't think anyone is saying this wasn't bait

can anyone who's a super lore nerd determine if the corporation that the jove gave capsules is supposed to be a self insert for ccp
---
in that they were gifted this awesome moneymaking technology out of the blue and haven't done anything good since
---
No.
---
Most corps have people that will courier stuff for you.  I used to move stuff once-a-week between Jita for tips or free; I operated at a loss, but didn't mind because it helped corp.
---
Most blocks also have alliance couriers, which move stuff for a fee.
---
To a point.  You are usually required to participate in certain ops, and may have a quota to meet for others.
---
Just to add that if you can't afford/aren't trained for a covops frigate, every race has a frigate that's bonused to exploration stuff (for Caldari it's the Heron), so those are generally good choices.
---
You are right, my bad... but Karmah Fleet public channel is probably even worst lol
---
Please tell me its people in fleet in the site and not just randoms in the site
---
How long do you think before someone builds a Dyson Swarm around a star?
---
As TAPI leaders have repeatedly clarified, the withdrawal from Geminate was a strategic redeployment and all conclusions regarding victory conditions are categorically unsound.
---
Imagine having the name highsecmissionrunner :bigthink:
---
Public Karma chat channel is the biznatch, the bees knees, the best place to hang out.
---
I'm legally required to say that or something.
---
There are quite a few fits you can run actually in Null.
---
It really depends on use case/what you want to do. but if you're talking solo/small gang the VNI/Ishtar hunter still works. you can also fit up what's basically a super ONI ( struggles with smaller tackle but works anyways. )

Is this the newest Jared Dale scam? Ok OP, make sure you get someone to make you a cool little advert image, maybe with retro industrial feel? Then you make a post in a few days about getting your Iteron ganked and how you intend to keep on keeping on. Then post every third day with an update until people start throwing ISK at you.
---
i recently found a new nullsec corp. i joined them, and the ceo is super nice, so i am helping organise english bulletins and helping with training rookies. it is rare that i find such a great group of strangers, even rarer that i feel happy within a nullsec community. i love these guys, and they deserve some love. i also learnt that eve is more diverse in language than i realised. going to be not homeless soon, and eve and the people here have been a bug help; it is great having people to talk to. eve is the one stable thing i have atm and i appreciate it.
---
TBH this video is massively boring. No editing involved, we're just watching you write stuff out on screen.
---
It's highsec, there is no gate, anyone can warp to it, it's only dangerous if you get aggro, salvaging is a big part of the payout.
---
I am doing them in a Solo ship.
---
With slaves
---
Was jared dale a scam? D:
---
Ah, feels good doesn't it.  Jay delivered mine some months ago.  Same story as yours more or less.  That looks like 1DQ.  Get up to KQK but don't autopilot.
---
Wtf?!
---
Even a basic level of editing is needed here. This was like going to open mic poetry night down at the plaid man boys coffee bar.
---
Explosive damage it is!
---
I like this change - i was just answering his question. way back when, people didn't struggle to google basic shit and didn't need half as much hand holding.
---
as other people have pointed out - it's not difficult... so the fact ccp are having to put it in the games for the new generation of players says a lot.
---
They’re more likely to gank ppl near jita.
---
All these QoL updates are so late...
---
I said tanked. No plebian learning clones.

&gt; I have seen multiple older sources say that you could get as low as 0.75%, but i'm not sure if CCP increased the minimum tax at some point.

Base was 1%.  It was raised to 1.5%

Except there are a lot of rats that don't match the standard weak resist profiles.

Back in my day we checked NPC resists websites with our in-game web browser.

5 bombers is enough. He doesn't need the cyno and the bridge, he can just sit cloaked in the best mining system in the region and wait for the rorquals to get dumb.

There was always that 1 person with the resist profiles in his bio
---
The entire sheet needs a structure to function.  You can add 'fake' ones to it manually.
---
Ouch, that must have played havoc with your birds &amp; beers years
---
&gt; so the fact ccp are having to put it in the games for the new generation of players says a lot.
---
Them being the same group of people willing to eat tide pods says a lot more.
---
technically it's somebody elses character models and environmental assets
---
&gt;  very subjective
---
Most accurate part of this post.
---
Huh, I know it might be pointless to say, but I'm not sure if 0.5% is going to do much to the inflation of Isk, lol.

Does follow the pattern.

Yes we did. I had two goals.

1) Show the new feature to those who haven't seen it
---
2) Visually show the data to those who haven't hunted for it yet

you mean 'Dun Gooned'

If only any ship had a bonus for explosive bullets... your commen wouldn't be completely stupid.

This is a zero factor when poding yourself to jita. Code are worthless cucks who fail at real pvp. I ran 7 jf for 5 years and avoiding code was childs play.

I dont need your money or your girl, but pics plz

Amarr will save you all

INIT is still seeding dreads and in the planning stages.

The tide pod thing was pretty much a fabtication though

Imagine being in karmafleet
---
yea, being in the corp with the largest super/titan fleet in the game is awful
---
It must be if you feel the need to brag about the size of your super fleet
---
I forgot that reddit is your personal blog
---
You can use kitey gunboats just fine in K space sites, the ships are slow and burn straight at you with 0 transversal most of the time. It isn't as efficient as a typical droneboat, but if you find it more fun then it might be worth it.
---
You can kinda sorta use dotlan to find what planets are in each system, but you have to go and look individually. I suggest just joining a nullsec bloc since everyone will want to buy your PI.
---
Is the game free??? I paid thousands of $ for EVE subs over the years and im an entitled fuckhead if i want a minor gift once a year?
---
Incursions are still among the top isk-earners in highsec.
---
Level 4 missions are still good isk, provided you have enough standing, decent skills and a good ship.
---
Abyssal sites can be good, but generally require a bit of bling for higher-tier sites.
---
Exploration in null (data and relic sites) and WHs can be good, although training-up decent scanning skills can take a while.
---
VNI and Carrier ratting in null are both still good, though not as good as they used to be.
---
Rorqual mining was heavily nerfed recently; wouldn't recommend it any more.
---
PI in null is about the same; decent isk, but the tedium is likely to drive you crazy after a few weeks.
---
If you're in the right corp, moon mining can be good, but it's often sporadic.
---
And there's always station trading. Like with PI, the isk can be good, but the tedium can quickly become a killer.
---
You're right, but mass downvotes cuz 90% of people that aren't retarded have moved on to other games now.
---
I seriously doubt there are any InterBus owned Customs Offices anymore.
---
Remember for up to date info be on the stream, this isn't a plug for my channel but once I start streaming 1 hour before the jump I will not be able to come on boards and answer questions or let people know of any changes, stream starts 18:00 eve time, undock and jump is 19:00 Eve Time.

Snap whether this is intentional or an accident, CCP enabled triglavian invasion on sisi!
---
They are still around, but pretty damn rare, have seen a few when exploring J-space.
---
This is just one of the things that makes EVE so unique from other games. For a game with such an unforgiving reputation, the community is just amazing. You're the best Falcon! :)

Good point! Maybe a low class wormhole would be the ideal place for them.

Yeah I'll give that map a look. I was afraid we would have to look around for ages, but if it comes down to that then sure! Thanks for the help!
---
They should have taken a lesson from Jita, and at least doubled it.
---
Triglavian's two weakest resists are Explosive and Thermal.    
---
Triglavian guns shoot out Explosive and Thermal damage.    
---
Coincidence?
---
Oh man, I feel sad when I see you being downvoted. Exploration of PVE content by trial and error without instantly looking for "YouTube guide + fit + ISK/hour + full info" IS fun, and when game doesn't let you feel totally lost and doesn't feed you all the possible info at the same time it creates such a good experience.
---
Class 3 wormhole with a nulsec static.
---
You are more likely to find an abandoned one than an active one.
---
What i've heard is that if a corp owns a customs office and disbands it becomes a interbus one.
---
Instead of attacking their bots, they just shot a miner that wasn't following their mining rules.  
---
The FRT bots are untouched.
---
DELETE THIS
---
You get to be another number in a large group.
---
omg yes
---
i friggin love ccp. all you haters can kiss my face
---
That would make sense to me, have not heard anybody talk about that though.
---
It's sort of one of those things, like in WoW they have a 30 copper postage fee for sending items to other players, but that 30 copper is such a small amount at this point, it has literally no effect on the economy. At least EvE's tax in this case is percentage based so it scales over time.
---
^^^^

big talk from you lmao

Since the Svipul nerfs, there hasn't been a pwn mobile like it in the game.
---
That's the purpose of the trig ship. Pwn mobiles.
---
This. So much this.
---
Contact Wingspan. They charge a really modest fee to find you any wormhole you want.
---
You can pick the class, the effects, the statics. You can even ask for a specific hole.
---
And they'll get you in. No questions asked.
---
Yep we pride ourselves on our highly successful location services, the chat channel in game can be found in our public chat WING-DS, and from the locater chat one of our brokers will discuss fees and what you're looking for and then the entire Corp gets pinged about the new request :)
---
We also guarantee to vacate the hole and not make any deliveries for 24hours
---
&gt;* Feels like he picked his ideas by sorting r/eve by new
---
lmao
---
You could literally do that with an Intro to Excel course. 
---
They figured out that LP awarded was based on the value of the kill and manipulated the market on certain items to artificially inflate the value of their kills to exploit the LP reward system. 
---
I'm not sure why you're trying to punctuate your point by saying the value was stored as 32 bits. The highest value for a single precision floating point value is more than they could possibly reach anyways.
---
It was exaggerated to a comedic level sure. But a lot of the "challenges" aren't and most are as bad or worse.
---
Absolutely untrue.
