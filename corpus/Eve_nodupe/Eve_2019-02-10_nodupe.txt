C6-C6 Red Giant meaning it's a C6 red giant with connections to other C6?

---
Not a wormholerbtw. Genuinely looking to learn.
---
Planetside has none of that.
---
Yeah, mine goes red/orange/yellow(0.0)/grey(none)/light blue/blue
---
The Isogen-10 will always have to come from the abyss, and since Leshaks and Kikimoras are in demand, they will always have value. If nobody else is running abyss, I imagine Iso10 will spike and people will rush back in.
---
nope, with carriers unironically being cheaper than a blops bs and the reward for killing people being so low there's hardly any reason to use them anymore.
---
Yep that’s right, there is a 30 minute timer when you first enter and both players die at 0! I think at the 15 minute mark you both lose 50% resists or maybe 25%. 
---
Okay cool. Thanks!
---
I just trained rockets to lvl 4 (daily alpha injector) because I want a brawling fit so any help is good.
---
&gt;How can you possibly pass up the most ideal set up to pay him back for screwing you over?
---
By getting over it.
---
They give specific skills such as targeting III or faction frigate I, etc.. If you have already trained the skill you get nothing. The side quests give 50k isk each.
---
there are several other squads out fucking with people at the moment as well.
---
What's the purpose of being in a renter alliance in this game? Is it really that terrible to go on one or two required fleets every month? Are renters that scared of PvP? The only reason I can think of to rent is to bot.
---
Those security missions that are essentially unchanged in the 7 years since I started playing, and probably longer still? Oh wait, they added burner missions that can be cheesed, and dropped the value of scrap/dropped mods off a cliff.
---
actually its more like 3 hours spread out over a week to 10 days maybe less if they don't show up to defend or they let the fuel run out.
---
Join karmafleet, horde, or brave. all have intro programs for new players. 
---
VNI ratting is incredibly passive and easy to run but has very low payout. Plenty of active pve (carrier, c5, abyss) pays out more. The scale of effort to payout exists, it's not even bad, and the variance in choice is actually quite nice.
---
The main frustrations when people think of PVE are inflation, botting, and the lack of other available targets in space. None of these things can be addressed via making PVE more 'active'. Available targets comes from huge megablocks owning massive swaths of space often designated as rental, which can be solved with breaking up the blocs and giving small groups time to shine. Though good luck getting them to do that or finding people who will be dedicated enough to commit to snagging space from them...
---
Botting has kind of always existed and needs constant watch to keep in check, but it's more noticeable when there's nothing else to shoot.
---
Inflation is a totally different beast. I'm no expert on that and I won't claim to be.
---
EVE Online: Where being an asshole is not just acceptable, but encouraged!
---
Mindless grinding is in every game. That's not exclusive to Eve.
---
There's a decent scale of payout to effort in Eve's PVE. You make a lot more in a carrier or a c5 dread than you do in a VNI.
---
Most other mmos don't support alts like Eve does. That can of worms was opened far too long ago for a realistic change.
---
This is what EVE has come to. People asking about super fits for ratting. If you have to ask don't do it.
---
not gonna lie, I use the Tengu for relic exploration, because of its scan bonus and nullification, and the ability to chase off Asteros and Herons. I also used to use the Tengu to hunt some random Russian renters in Period Basis.

I don't krab or would ever rent, but I can see the appeal to some degree - most of the big alliances are terrible

They used to be there but were considered too complicated.

Anyone still has there's?

*Runner being someone that does power leveling services such as Chaos Sanctuary runs, Baal runs, or uber Trist runs.

I just came here to post the same situation! I was watching last night as it happened. He took the PG conduit and the cache had already exploded and the gate was open. The system shouldn't have put him in with that Gila if the Gila's zone was already 'finished', and it should have put him in a new instance with a fresh 5min timer.
---
Here's a link to slightly earlier for full context:

It's definitely a bug.
---
The Imperium is friend with Legacy
---
Panfam is friend with... sorry want to go to bed early I don't have time to list every other alliance in the game
---
Expecting that to happen out of nowhere is, though.
---
The session timer is a fine fix considering the issues that triggered it being implemented. Calling it a "bullshit bandaid" and blatantly not understanding the complexity of the task at hand when putting out one's hand and saying "I WANT BETTER RAAAAARRGGHHHH" is, indeed, entitlement.

One of my favourite things to do is station trading. I enjoy logging in each day to see how my investments are doing. Some days I'll only make a few hundred million ISK but on occasion I'll log in and find I've made a couple billion overnight. Plotting it all on a spreadsheet with graphs etc also pleases me and helps me to track my profits.
---
Some may find it boring but I do enjoy spreadsheets in space.

I'm so proud of this community *happy tear*

I go double neut plated with mwd and mjd figure the rest out

What is it?
---
The real question is why Tapi is fighting so hard to get the perimeter market? 
---
Also it's going to cost a bit more than a bill 
---
Sure ~~people~~ bots are still doing them
---
You aren't helping people.  
---
You down them in veiled pity and platitudes. A small group within the whole concept pushes a narrative that revolves around hugging those who need help rather than actually talking with people and "helping them" in ways they need. Not everyone desires to be smothered and have their shit drowned out. But when you then take an approach that suits that individual, you're being pushed away and told off by those that make up the little inner circle. It's been that way since the day of slack.  
---
It's more a community server than a "help" community. That's fine if you want to be a community, but don't pretend to be "helping" all people when you push out ideas and principles that help people but may not be entirely be a full on soft approach.
---
Having tp have 10 clones in 10 different places is one of the contributing reasons im not loggin in much atm. Spending excessive amounts of time just trying to sort the most basic stuff isnt fun.
---
I like to pvp in certain clones (10 tbqh) but i also have characters who re-process etc etc. Some basic QOL Changes are needed to make it less tedious for the most basic stuff. Up the clone bay fuel cost for every clone installed, tax on an actual scale of income!!!! Shock horror.
---
Because there's a metric fuck ton of ISK for whoever controls it.
---
Try listening.
---
Can multiple players run PI off of the same planet?
---
Its very little, you get some really low modifier skills trained to 1 or 2.  
---
Before the last remake you actually got useful skills like CPU Management, but I guess CCREEEE thought giving new players some fitting skills was a bad idea and changed it to Marketing I instead.
---

If you're talking about solo mining that's not like fleet mining. When we have armor-tanked 70 procurers with combat drones we're praying for some gray or small gang to attack us cause we'll eat them alive. That experience feels very different than solo mining. Plus it pays well.
---
I'm not sure but I suspect it may be the reason I die alone and rich.
---
Judy, it was still pretty funny. Also, we miss you. 
---
You need to be realistic. You aren't giving an ear to people with depression and/or other mental health issues. I used to be in a position while in your community where I needed someone but could not rely on any of you. Rather than actually listening to what was needed, and genuinely paying attention, you ridiculed and pushed away someone who needed someone. It was more important to keep the small inner core entertained, than to actually focus on what you claim to do and listen.  
---
Not everyone needs a hug to get out of it.
---
But sir, that would make things less safe, and that is not the way we do things in eve now!!!!

This is my solo Panther. Shield is the way to go so you  get more dps out of it. Bling is generally needed to get the most out of a solo blops but you can't cheapen it if you wish.
---
Found this at a Goodwill a few years back. I loved the art, but never really played EVE too much, but I know it's a concept piece from EVE. Figured you all might be able to help! 
---
This is not the EVE way.
---
The EVE way is to look for alt accounts to see when a titan account is imminently poised to rejoin, to have the scouts find out where the main will enter the gaming universe, to have a fleet ready when the titan lands on the grid to destroy it on arrival.
---
And to do that with a lead time of two actual Earth Standard years.
---
This guy stole your account and all your gear. You don’t ‘get over that’, you get even. You make it known and you are seen to make it known, that whomever fucks with you will end up paying the butcher’s bill.
---
You just indicated that people can screw you over and that ‘you’ll get over it’ in due time. Maybe not the most ideal philosophy to go through life.
---
Fucking... Goddamnit, you're as thick as a goddamn brick wall, aren't you?
---
The session timer _is_ the fix. It's the best fix that can be done given the realities of software development and the context of the codebase CCP is working with.
---
Fucking read what I'm writing, dude, I'm a professional software dev. This shit is fucking _hard._
---
Pretty sure they kept some of their guns on the azbel to keep damage cap, so they weren’t fully engaging our feroxes. Ferox fleets we’re also at 0 and I think the maels were arty fit so lol tracking 
---
Pretty sure that's called being a doormat.
---
This meme was made by a toxic person
---
you could go to fights like this as a third party and just shoot mangos that go suspect for whatever reason
---
So you are saying remove implants as a barrier to do pvp?
---
You have given me something to live for.
---
And a burst jammer for luck.  Little known fact, all of those killmarks are from the jammer.
---
Join Pandemic Horde. Lots of content, good banter, they’ll even let you FC.
---
Yes. 
---
None of that changes my original point that it would be nice not to have to deal with constant delays when swapping clones, ships, and fleets. 
---
Ah, right, you're just here to be a shitbird.
---
No, I made a suggestion that a small change would be a nice thing 
---
You suddenly got your panties in a twist and went off the deep end for me suggesting a small qol improvement would be nice.
---
I will literally buy that right now.
---
Yeah we don't have any of that and yet people still turn up....
---
It's the joke.
---
No clue, but apparently someone lost everything in the divorce/breakup.
---
I addressed every point you made. You've not addressed any of mine. Like when I point out citadels, local, alliance gates, jump bridges, cyno jammers, super cap umbrella...your arguments do not address these massive advantages. You only suggest "well just play the game like me." You're an F1 mashing krab with a shit KB. But you're "empire building."
---
What empire have you built? What have you done?
---
yeah, there are only 16 C6-C6 unshattered holes, and only one of them is a Red Giant. 
---
http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c6&amp;staticdest=c6&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered
---
is a really nice site, shows all the wormholes and you can filter by type, static and class.
---
I know two of them, one is CCP TomB an old dev, and CCP Oveur, I have their signatures too 
---
All the major groups have newbies corps
---
Karmafleet if you want to be int the Imperium (goons)
---
Pandemic Horde if you want to be in Panfam
---
Brave for legacy
---
or Dreddit/Brand newbros if you use reddit (also Legacy)
---
I think I threw mine out
---
You have a strange definition of "even".
---
This is concerning to me, if you don't mind PM me information regarding this: in-game/discord, if you remember who you talked to that would be great as well as any dates. 
---
Or any of the not nullblob groups. Wormhole society accepts new players (wormholers) Eve uni is still around I think, and a lot of the faction warfare guys love teaching newbros.
---
"Oven Bomb" and "Lemonade", looks like
---
It was way back when, I don't have the dates anymore but it was a major group of the people and frankly, B4R lost any and all credit they had. I've pulled my own shit out of the bog through persistence and I am not planning on supporting or trusting any B4R idea ever again.
---
I have no idea the value on this at the moment. I have no attachment to it besides I like the art, so I wouldn't be too opposed to it😅
---
Awesome! This is what I was looking for. I figured it was someone from the original team, but didn't know what area they were involved in:) 
---
Storyline neuts are also great. T2+ stats but better than meta-compact fitting requirements.
---
What I'm worried about with Horde is just how giant it is, I'll be more of a pawn than anything else.
---
Also, I haven't quite nailed down how to make money in highsec, much less null, so the fact that from what I see they don't have an SRP is worrying to me
---
If you've already trained them you get the equiv in raw SP to inject as you please.
---
If he doesn’t I will 
---
I don't really know much about the different alliances, so don't really have a preference there. Would I eventually be able to learn to FC or do small group PvP if I applied myself in TEST? Are there avenues for eventually moving up the corporate ladder into positions of authority to learn the corporate side of things?
---
 Just keep chugging some maple syrup.
---
Basically this. We’re having a blast.
---
I would actually love to get into wormhole space, seems by far the most interesting. Thing I'm more worried about there is just how inexperienced I am, I've heard that it's generally very challenging. Eve uni I've heard has died out a little, and isn't based in null where I'd eventually like to end up. Also I've not heard of faction warfare, could you explain that more?
---
only 45k plex?
---
wow thats an awesome picture
---
Dude who sells kill rights for the cost of the ship, makes insurance cost off of every activation
---
Little jelly tbh
---
max tank ferox at 0 on a arty maels.  
---
don't want to be a pawn?  in horde you can aim to get into Vanguard,  Foreign Legion, or Blessed Bean.  
---
or other ops like Partisans.
---
we also got groups for specialized stuff like whs, burners, abyssal,spy,and more.
---
in nullsec, making money is simple,  train into a Vexor (Horde provides NBI Vexors for new players),  rat in some anomolies.  and train into PI.
---
if you want money in highsec,  i'd suggest looking into Warp To Me, an Incursion group where you can make up to 190m an hour.   they even have alpha account fits that they accept.
---
&gt;Would I eventually be able to learn to FC or do small group PvP if I applied myself in TEST?
---
Yes, in dreddit anybody can run a fleet and the corp will SRP (ship replacement program) it. To FC bigger, alliance wide ops would take longer and alot more knowledge/skill. 
---
&gt;Are there avenues for eventually moving up the corporate ladder into positions of authority to learn the corporate side of things?
---
After 3 months you can apply to all sorts of alliance groups, HR, Intel, FC. Basically you get up the ladder by doing things that help out the alliance. 
---
Not sure how it works in test, but goons run regular classes to teach people how to FC, they also have skillbook packs for new bros, and for the most part when you die you make money on the SRP
---
The one on the bottom left almost looks like Kieron, who was an Eve Community Manager back in the day.
---
*Woah!* it's your **4th Cakeday** M4jok! ^(hug)
---
The one in the bottom right is "Lemondo", but again, I have no idea who that is. 
---
I'm sorry that this happened to you and I can see why it would have broken your trust in our group. I am trying to add more accountability, to stop anything like this from happening again to other people. 
---
Yeah, it's always been a good piece to have on the wall by my computer:) 
---
Lol! No kidding... poor sob. 
---
Sell kill rights for cost of Orca hull. Max insure. Profit.  
---
They weren't even involved in the fight.
---
That's unfortunately less interesting.
---
Oh, LeMonde... I can see that now. Well thanks for the info. I've always been curious about it, but never thought of posting here until just today:) 
---
....honest question, when did CCP gut its QA/PTE team?
---
Support tickets work that way. You'll get a response if you create a support ticket, but not for a bug report.
---
Pretty shit system TBH. Bounty system as a whole needs a complete rework.
---
Are you sure? I recognize Kieron from 2006/2007. And CCP LeMonde would have been around at that time (ex \[link\]([https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=333925](https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=333925)))

God bless this Reddit community.

I see what you are doing here... gotta bring the newbies to the right path of the one true deity, the Nanofiber II.   :)
---
Pre-trained skills.
---
Yeah that sounds about the right time period, I got their signatures at the 2006 fanfest, I got them to sign the insert for my boxed copy of the game
---
Through trusted 3rd parties. Normal eject and board mechanic.
---
&gt; Muninns are boring
---
HACs are horrendously boring with the ADC but if u think BC meta is any better then you're high.

---

well who does it? always thought it was Concord 
---
Thanks

Since you mentioned hands-on-learning, go for [EVE University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page). It's a neutral corp that focuses on teaching people the basics of the game, has campuses in hi/lo/nullsec and WH and hosts many public lessons. They actively update the wiki, focus on newbro experience and actually expect you to join another corp when you are done learning, a very thing if you want to keep all options open. 
---
Imperium wont like being second fiddle to tapi.
---
So Dreddit is the orginal reddit corp (hence the name). They take brand new players with active reddit accounts 90+days old. 
---
Brand newbros is a bit laxer in requirements but they are both part of TEST Alliance Please Ignore.
---
Dreddit does have a 1 on 1 mentor program if you fee like you want to take advantage of it.
---
Let me know which you want to join and ill show you how to apply.
---
Ypu could sell that fpr a decent price to an actual eve fan, then buy something you are into....
---
Eve dudes will boner over it. I am bonering right now.
---
There used to be no or very reduced session timers when citadels first came out.  You know what happened?  Weird shit l like ships jettisoning out of the citadel happened.
---
That guy is confused, he's talking about the orcas that were on grid. The Oracles were definitely involved. 
---
Exactly
---
Hey, I've removed your thread as your question is more responsible in the Weekly R/Eve No Stupid Questions thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ao3j1w/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_february/. You can go ahead and post your questions there and they'll be answered :)
---
I definitely want to learn, but the problem is I really don't have isk right now. A few million, sure, but not enough to supply a lot of mistakes
---
they may have changed this? I half remember reading they did because people were running it just for the free SP.
---
I put a capped Alpha through the NPE a week or so ago and didn't seem to get any unallocated SP. but i'm not 100% sure.
---
Dreddit definitely sounds the most interesting. Would you mind letting me know?
---
Nice
---
PM me your in game name
---
PANFAM Vs LIMP
---
I kinda like LIMP.
---
There's even 10-11 bombers  on the killmail..... 
---
We need pink standings 
---
I feel that a better alternative would be making it so your name does not show up in local until you decloak.
---
Which will also kill most null production activities and hence basically kill the game
---
Citation needed
---
Questionable entry doesn't need citations
---
When you move out to null/wormhole space you’ll find its a lot easier to get ISK. I remember when I moved to catch I hacked a relic can that was worth like 2x of what I had in my wallet at the time. 
---
It's not going to work
---
No. It is using Excel to get your character or other game information through the official API.
---
This is the EVE way. There are two ways to approach it - either you totally screw someone over in most complicated and vile way possible because they deserve it, or you screw someone over just because you can do it. Neither is wrong.
---
it would also break most non pvp activities in nullsec.
---
so how about you just get good at hunting. instead of needing prey served up on a plate for you. not very skilled of ya
---
Biomass Royal: Starring OP
---
Because ISK that they want, but even more important don’t want PH to have.  
---
Also...something to actually do that is of no consequences to them building a Null sec empire.  
---
No. There are plenty of Chinese websites and blogs to teach you coding using all kinds of language. However, there is no difficulty for a good Chinese programmer to read an official English coding documents.

"There's been quite the magenta donut recently"
---
"The blacks are forced to use seperate facilities... For their industry needs"
---
"Everyone in the alliance sees xyz corp as the lower caste, that's why they're green"
---
The whole more colours idea is just going to add some stupid bureaucracy. We don't need more colours, we need content drivers.
---
Why the fuck does anyone go through the standing camp at the Hroduko gate in Frulegur...
---
Krab opinions are irrelevant to me.
---
Why not just link blops? They cost more than capitals across the board and some marshals cost more than supers easily.
---
Ahh right, thanks.
---
I'm good with it I would probably switch from doing ratting to abyssals probably tho or just do high sec incursions
---
Don't worry about injecting those to 5, train em all to 4 as soon as you can along with the exploration skills you need, use your isk on a set of +3 implants for a training clone and a few exploration frigates. Plus get someone to help with a remap to speed up training on stuff you need currently.
---
Depends a lot what you'd want to drop on. You can get really good solo Panther fit capable of breaking most DED runners (and being able to 1v1 most subcaps if you can ensure tackle before jumping in) if you go active shield with mix of DDAs/Gyros in lowslots (refer to Flightleader videos on youtube, there are fits used at end of one of them), but that's quite expensive way to fit one, while also lacking MJD, so if you get into bad spot, you're pretty much dead.
---
For cheaper one, go towards ancillary + deadspace or dual deadspace armor rep, 650mm or 800mm ACs, MWD+MJD and tackle in medslots, utility highs for cloak and neuts. Specific details are up to you, but when blopsing solo you'll get better overall results from having active tank than buffer - most fights will take long enough for reps to outperform buffer, and also active reps don't increase your mass (that would reduce agility and max speed). Plan fit around how the drop should look like, including proper capacitor management (800 vs 3200 cap boosters), ability to heat when necessary, what can or can't you tank reliably etc. There's just too many variables when it comes to personal preferences, target selection, area you're hunting in and other factors to give "the one best fit you should use".
---
Depending on your space will depend on what t2 you use but 3 lights and 2 heavy should be good. With mine I use dragonfly 2s and termite 2s
---
just remove insurance
---
serves no purpose, tilts the game meta
---
Pith booster isn't that great when fit with heavy neuts, it's got great rep power, but overall EHP/GJ (capacitor efficiency for tanking) is quite awful compared to Gist, even with purple capbooster and capacitor safeguard rigs you'd have troubles keeping up with cap while heating.
---
Does it really though?
---
Op is delusional yea. 
---
But can you post a good effective fit for curiosity sake?
---
Panda Mic Chore?

4bill hurricane fit....

Hurricane fleet issue* The guy apparently farms escalations next door to us all the time.
---
yes

people use t1 bcs simply because of insurance payouts
---
Still. 
---
Not for the number 1 Krab alliance in game lmao
---
Blopsing is more than just battleships.
---
SB, Recons, T3C
---
Only if there is a pulse decloak upwell module and scanning us easier
---
tbh use Sin for solo drops. Panther can’t solo decently fitted T1 BSs even with pimped fit.
---
It's their turn to be Test pets this month though.
---
ok
---
I heared one can dodge bombs by bringing even more numbers than you already have. next time bring 6:1 odds. 
---
If that doesnt work increase the numbers 
---
at auction in vegas, a fanart from Razoren went for what 200$ just saying a signed concept art for an Amarr Dreadnaught, Revelation probably would go for similar
---
The price of this is really going to depend on the artist and which names have been signed on this.  
---
Leading developers, CEO and original artist?  At least a couple grand.  Ink printed copy + some community manager randoms? Maybe a hundred bucks.  
---
If you can get CCP to give this some sort of authenticity the art and verify the signatures, I'd be willing to offer myself.
---
dude made the definitive lowsec frig guide.

---
Or the people who own the system get a scanning bonus
---
Thank you
---
Because it's expensive and when people are away from their isk farms they get salty 
---
A way that this might be possible is magical server timing, where at 4:57 seconds in you activate prooving grounds and directs you to his ring. 3 seconds later, before you complete instance transition, the ring times out and loot can pops, but you are still directed to go to that ring. So you land 1-2 seconds after  the can pops and gate opens. Just a possibility.
---
This is absolutely incredible. Love the breakdowns 
---
I think its ranked more by overall power. While test is very powerful, I don't think they could win a sustained war against Goonswarm. Hence, Imperial Legacy. Not Legacy Imperium.
---
I would like to remind you, it is not the players job to deal with botters. That duty falls to the Devs of EVE. You want local to become limited so you can more easily hunt people, not to fight bots. Don't try and fool yourself or anyone around you.  You want kills?  Earn em.
---
That's more interesting!
---
So anybody who tells the truth must be a Krab. Would also like to point out. The vast majority of nullsec krabs in some way shape or form.
---
Yes, Goonswarm does krab alot. It takes quite a bit to keep a massive economy running. Unlike our enemies in the north who want passive income, causing "Working for isk is hard"
---
Happening to my alt corp too.
---
Excuse me? You have never heard of Goonswarm have you? I think they have like 3-4 sig deployments at this very moment. I know for certain that Liberty Fleet has been attacking horde. 
---
There's nothing stopping you from moving in the future either. Unlike many other games as long as you aren't a dick most corps will take people back in the future, so if you join say Brave then quit after a month to try WHSOC, there's nothing stopping you going back to brave if you didn't like it. 
---
I moved to wormhole space straight from highsec, it was hard at first and everyone around me was a lot richer with a ton of SP. Wouldn't do anything differently if I did it again. Violence is the Answer are the main PvP entity in WHSOC and they're great guys, I think they're fairly noob friendly but you'd need to check. 
---
I've noticed the same thing today, cant search, link or contract to certain corps
---
Why do you punish yourself?
---
What's stopping them from putting bots on all their gates to see when someone enters? The previous suggestion of not showing up in local until you decloak would make that pointless however
---
For now AFAIK when using Isboxer you need to kill the launcher after each client launches or it will break the window slot layout ZZzZzz
---
It looks like a rev with Erebus tail.... very strange one
---
EVE Online: Fuck you.
---
If you increase the time between client launches it helps too.
---
I think that's how it happened, but they seem to build in a grace period that presumably covers this case. If you are in the arena and the clock hits 0 for unlocking the cache, it can take 15 or 20 seconds of the timer at 0 to actually unlock it. I suspect that's because it is waiting to confirm nobody has tried to enter the room to prevent this sort of thing from hapoening.?
---
Hmmmm wonder how the ferox market is doing...
---
It won't work. And that's coming from someone not opposed to removing local.
---
Botters will just put cloaky alts on gate grids for overview checks. I know, you'll have 60 free seconds of d-scanning sigs within 14AU of the gate.
---
Botters (where possible) will focus on larger systems where most anoms are far from gates.
---
On top of that they'll probably be programmed to spam dscan and warp out using that. Maybe some botters will set up common overview profiles that exempt other typical ratting ships from overview so they dont get spooked by otber ratters.
---
Botters will stop using ships that cant be replaced easily, so VNIs will be more common as carriers/supers will be too expensive to replace.
---
There's plenty of game changes that will inconvenience botters, but little that will easily resolve the issue.
---
Injectors, unlimited alts, and lack of CCP punitive measures make botting easy.
---
I don't know the solution to botting, but removing local is a band-aid that only mildy alleviates symptoms without dealing with the actual ailment.
---
I'm so bonering right now too.
---
nah, just remove local
---
removing local is effectively a developer fighting botters
---
imagine being this small brained
---
Cap insurance is a boom more than a curse. Remove it and the ONLY thing keeping supers MARGINALLY I check is eliminated.
---
25% at 8mins IIRC
---
That siege mode though. The EVE that could have been.
---
No, a bot that is taught to identify botters and point them out to devs for review and investigation is Devs fighting botters. Removing local is changing a large and very important game mechanic that would heavily favor the stupid and lazy. 
---
&gt;No
---
NARF
---
Lol
---
14. Two of those are shattered.
---
Null-sec is that way ➡
---
I don’t have a fix but when I try logging in more than two accounts simultaneously I just get socket closures across all accounts
---
&gt;yes  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;devs making a change that removes a huge chunk of botters?  
---
&gt;it's fighting bots by definition
---
If it only affected Botters, than yes. But it won't, and we all know you don't want this for botters. You want to be spoon fed kills because you suck at hunting. So I return to my earning comment.   
---
**You want kills? Earn em.**
---
Yes. Red Giants are particularly sought after since they help high-class dread ratters be more efficient. 
---
HK/Hawks hold the C6-6s because they're generally valuable and sought after holes. Dura have, for a long time, lived in a 5-6 RG. They started harassing this 6-6 when HK were getting evicted, so LZHX evicted their 5-6, and now they've decided that they're capable of taking the 6-6 RG. Unfortunately for them, it's well defended by both HK and LZHX, and that probably won't happen before Dura run out of resources and eventually get forced back to a 5-6.
---
I see. Too bad, I would be all for removing most implants as it seems to make a lot of people risk adverse.
---
I had a fit a year ago and forgot it cuz I stopped playing 
---
Thanks for your help

---
I'm out of words...
---
We're working on something on that - cannot confirm anything at this stage but hang in there
---
Time to dock it, take care of business, and then undock it and back to EVE while she is sleeping. 
---
Again, hence why I mentioned the realities of software development and the context of the codebase.
---
If CCP devs had oodles of time and so on, yeah, they could re-write the thing from scratch, spend all the time in the world chomping down on the problem, and get an ideal, flawless solution implemented.
---
But they don't, and they can't. And that's what makes it really difficult, because there are only so many hours in the day, and there's a lot of stuff to do.
---
Have Boner, will trade for art.
---
It's not a small thing! Holy fuck, dude, I've been trying to tell you that for ages.
---
You think it's a small thing because you don't understand the complexity of the issue. You think it's a small thing because you can't imagine the length of time it would take to work out what the fuck is going wrong.
---
The devs don't have the time to spend on it, and there's so much complexity and technical debt in the codebase that they, in fact, went as far as to implement a whole new line of structures just to _replace_ POSes wholesale rather than fix the POS code.
---
Stop assuming that these things are just tiny little simple small itty-bity fixes. They're not. I've been trying to get that through to you for the last, what, five hours?
---
The only code that isn’t spaghetti is written by university CS majors for a senior project.
---
True....but I just logged on. Literally.
---
the only people who agree with you are in your alliance, and even most of them don't
---
Bots would simply adapt.  Eg. Botting program then ships with unlimited alt recce bots.  Alts sit at gates, listening for warp-in sound.  Alts look for cynos and new sigs.  Alts scan sigs and sit off any WHs listening for activation sounds.
---
Local is the current approach and easy but bots will very quickly adapt.
---
Dude this is amazing if you’re not married do it now 
---
Holly fuck I hope to never with with you on a project.
---
I have one. I got it at PAX 2008.
---
Null sec = rorquals
---
High sec = orcas
---
I figured that out already, what I was trying to ask is for an idea of how my fleet of alts should look like, what kind of ships to go for each character. Or just fuck it and go all rorquals? Lol
---
&gt;because they lose the ship ~~and I can loot it~~
---
FTFY
---
If bots are confirmed, they are (supposed to be) banned.  Players can set up a website for identifying and sharing bots and spend ages dealing with false reports or players can hunt.
---
Beyond that, it should be CCPls.
---
You can sell this in the neighborhood of $100 probably without much trouble. It's high-quality hand-drawn art of a well-regarded ship in excruciating detail.
---
The ship is not a concept, it's the [Revelation](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Revelation) which is in game as a capital gunboat.
---
On the other hand, you could keep it and gain an appreciation for it by joining us...
---
I've made 1.1b in the last 9 days just running combat anoms/sigs in highsec for the escalations. I find it fun but that's just me.

And what if you log off in the system? 
---
I’m not familiar with all the acronyms. You mean like scan sites? How exactly? What ship/fit?
---
The vast majority of nullsec is DISGUSTING
---
Earn them says the krab hiding behind local, alliance gates, supercap umbrella, citadels, moon mining platforms.
---
When was the last time you did anything outside of spoonfed content in the form of F1 fleets, you mongoloid?
---
\&gt; I was back in a Mackinaw \[with a better tank *grin*\] 20 minutes later, in the same spot

sounds like bot aspirant behavior but okay. 
---
Both the Combat Anomalies that show up on the scanner by themselves, as the ones you have to scan down. Vexor Navy Issue (VNI) with an Active Armor Tank.
---
Nope for good measure

And create diplomatic situations. But whatever.

To quote from the OP:  Also on another note I dont have a JF toon - will logistics just be a HUGE problem in NPC Null??

I was addressing the logistics part of their question.

Not welcome it seems. Oh well.

At least I don't go around making low effort insults at people without adding anything of value.

To the OP, whatever else happens I hope you find a great place to be and a lot of fun.

---
Why tho? Seems like there is a separation in the strong points between the two. Taking a risk gives you an advantage that people who wont take the risk, wont get. Stop the nerfing of eve, its already too safe.
---
So...I have joined Biohazard after having a conversation with Asion saying I would have lots of help being a new player. My help has been told to get into a hawk ASAP to run abyssal sites. I have been looking more into LS mechanics and looks like I am missing out on so much of what LS has to offer. I’m not USTZ so I know I’m not prime time but wow it’s slow. 
---
After reading this post I think I’ll be looking for a new home. My character is still only new but I’m keen to get stuck into more PvP. 
---
Level 4s are steady, but not great isk. Maybe try abyss for something more interesting. I'd suggest fitting up a retribution and soloing low-tier electrical abyss.
---
There are several newbie friendly corporations that will welcome you.
---
The one I belong to: Karmafleet - has many advantages stemming from being part of the Imperium, to include a major economy, great player support programs and more. All about new players.
---
Brave newbies, which has an advantage in not being a member of the Imperium (some people really hate us).  Very new player friendly.
---
Pandemic Horde, which takes everyone, including everyone's spy and awox alts. Is associated with Pandemic legion, a somewhat tarnished but old blood group. Also not Imperium as well.  While I tease them here they have had many start their eve career with them.
---
Dreddit, which is a Reddit based newbie corp. Neat group, but I know little about them.
---
Eve university,  new player focused, with a great wiki.  Seriously, regardless of where you go in the game check out their wiki.  In particular read their magic 14 article.
---
Is that a hi sec thing? I don’t wanna screw around pvp yet as Ive been gone so long I’m pretty much new. 
---
Link to the article: 
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)
---
The real victim here is baiting people with fake killmails. 
---
Link colors have been changed to make it easier to see what is a link and what kind of link it is.
---
..and neuted  
---
..wait
---
Love it or hate it, elite pvpers have targets because of krabs, elite pvpers have plenty of cheap stuff to blow up because of krabs, elite pvpers have their sense of accomplishments and satisfaction because of krabs
---
Like a food chain, if life for harmless krabs gotten worse and reduce in number, predators will also starve to death
---
You want words, I give them to your effortlessly shittalk
---
I think there is a bubble involved aswell.
---
One of my corp mates that I've played with since 2006 lived down the street from they guy who created goon swarm. He didnt know this until about a month ago when eve came up in a conversation and he mentioned it. 
---
Definitely a small world we live in.
---
If I were botting, I'd just set up my characters and have any change in the number of characters in the system be considered a hostile entering.
---
Karmafleet will welcome you, and you won't get stuck doing only one thing.  The only limit is you.  People in Karmafleet engage in a great many things.  A partial list includes the following:
---
Highsec ganking, gate camps, small gang roams, black ops/cloaky stuff, big fleets/fights, industry, and market speculation.
---
While many like to mine, many of us do not.  Several people have used Karmafleet as a springboard to go on to start corporations, become serious FCs and other positions as well.
---
If you want to start a corp, infrastructure is key.  Few in game can boast as complete and effective an infrastructure as the Imperium (Goons).  This makes it a great place to learn if Corp leadership is a goal.
---
Pvp does not interest me much. You small brained ape.  There is more to eve than pvp
---
Abyss is a new instanced PVE challenge you can enter from and area of space. You get 20 minutes to clear 3 pockets of randomized enemies and take the gate out.
---
Entry is by using an abyssal filament from your cargo while in space. With each type of filament giving different bonuses and penalties to you and enemies in the pockets. I'd stick to calm electrical filaments until you have a good feel for the sites.
---
Most of the loot is contained in a single cache per pocket you can pop and loot. This cache drops materials, BPCs, and skill books for the new precursor faction ships and disentegrator weapons, as well as mutaplasmids that can modify existing mods.
---
Battleships
---
"Bubble my wormhole"... wanna see that on some t-shirts stat
---
It is adding content. It lets me know who is eyes of some guy I'm trying to kill so I stay out of his d scan range instead of forgetting who his alt is because I've only seen it once. 
---
"EVE is a girls name, it must be another woman" is also a t-shirt candidate
---
I will check that out. 
---
Inflation happened. Poor you are now. 
---
To someone so maladjusted to the real world that they feel the need to scheme revenge in it, simply because they lost literally nothing of value whatsoever in a virtual life, sure.
---
Think about now but also long term. Think about your configuration of characters and how each one supports each other. When you’re logged in with your main, what characters should also be available online?         
---
       As an example, one of my JF chars is meant to be my long traveler. Whenever I have it online I have 5 other accounts available to provide cynos. Another example is my revenant account. When it’s online I can also add 3 mino pilots to fleet. For each scenario, be prepared to leverage your other accounts. 
---
I use Reddit to see how rich I am
---
To me it seems what you’re doing is on the next level though, I’m still a newbie I was thinking something more simple that’s why my first thought was mining, I’ve read online that ratting with alts require some baby sitting to a degree ..

Saw a guy in my university’s discord was playing eve (out of like 200 or 300 ppl lol), messaged him, talked to him for a bit, then didn’t talk to him much again. This was last september. In comes 2nd semester, he’s in my Calc class and we get assigned to the same group for some group work! Now we chat about eve a bit in class, crazy small world. 
---
It will be fun to have someone to talk EVE with. Nobody at my high school played, ofc people knew about it and my friends liked hearing about how I was joining these thousand people battles or whatever, but different talking with someone who actually plays.
---
For your case think about which character can bring in the most money now and how your supporting characters can keep it active. I see a lot of new players have alts available to haul their ore so their main never leaves the belt. With so many skills to train, spread the training burden across your characters to assist. Many hands make quick work. 
---
&gt;I'm a bit miffed
---
i noticed that when you started taking your PMS out on me for merely suggesting how nice it would be not to have constant delays and session timers between taking basic actions when docked.
---
Awox rattle used as bait. Bunch of shit blind jumped and died.
---
Literally /r/eve in a nutshell
---
Fun fact about kieron: he's a piece of shit. 
---
Can you imagine how shitty that'd be for botting? You'd never get anything done.
---
We use them in wormholes for bookmarking site warpins.
---
Don't bots usually flee from neutrals anyway? Just get my botter friends to agree to not fly anything through our systems and we're golden.
---
Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but this guy is the only one who correctly chose the best ship. 
---
I see art, i upvote.
---
did stainguy and doomchinchilla stop posting?
---
because people design bots to work with the current system, not a fantasy system that doesn't exist.
---
Thanks for the advice, I’ll keep that in mind :)
---
No, this is merely proof that people fly expensive shit. This does not prove your theory about capital insurance.
---
Thank you!

&lt;3 space pod

Originally I wanted to do this as a Rorqual bursting out of the desert like one of the big worm things in Dune... but I've never really read the Dune series and thought it might be better to try to capture the Rorqual as-is with all its detailed indy bits.
---
Mine on, you rockmunchers.
---

She got real excited when she said "Warp drive ACTIVE!!" 
---
Please don't speak with any authority on how hard or east it is to hunt something. Your opinion is invalid. Get a job.
---
I havent seen an eve art of an exploding ship... perhaps you could try that lol
---
I think it's actually ranked by who needs who. Test needs goons to do anything. Goons can do shit solo. 
---
its time to admit we made a mistake and remove citadels
---
It’s extremely unlikely you knew this exact guild, and not a different on that also got robbed. 
---
Calm down satan. 
---
Letting people walk all over you irl is an even worse idea than letting them do it online.
---
Yeah I don’t think there’s much fear of that.
---
Also: If someone write code and you they think it doesn’t stink, it’s probably shit. Programming languages aren’t a panacea. They have their own bugs and quirks. EVE is old and written in a language never meant to do what EVE does with it.
---
If you’d told devs at CCP headquarters in 2002 that we’d be having Titan slugfests with a few hundred supers/caps per side...
---
They’d probably be shocked to find out people were still playing EVE.
---
The Dune worm was a great idea, hope to see it soon!
---
The spod must flow! Great job on this one btw
---
This was frickin hilarious
---
Warp Drive Active was the best bit. At home we'd call her a keeper mate. Well done.
---
Oh, that might be cool with a ship like the Rorqual. It's big and has a lot of distinctive parts that stick out, so even \*rapidly disassembled\* the pieces would still have much character.
---
I've hunted before,  I wasnt much good at it, but I never begged ccp to make it easier
---
Ok so you get a fleet to log off in system. Log back in once the bots are back to krabbing. As soon as you land on one of them even if you manage to get them tackled and kill them in the time it took to do that the rest of them are safed up. 
---
Congrats you afked for however long it took for the bots to get back to work for one kill.
---
This is gold.   
---
And yes, this happens to me also. so you're not alone.
---
+1 for art, +1 for Dune reference, you get +2 👍 o7
---

It’s just a scam, and it’s wasn’t on the oracles, it was on an Orca. 
---
When the ibdustrial core is active, the side containers turn horizontal. 
---
If you want to do highsec stuff, I would recommend DED / combat anomaly sites - you’ll find these by scanning sigs in your probe window. Much more fun than missions. 
---
If you want to try something other than highsec then I would recommend either spending a ton of your isk on frigates, destroyers and t1 cruisers, and become a pirate in FW lowsec - or join one of the FW militias of you prefer (join galmil and run their missions if you want mega isk). 
---
Again, non-highsec, I would say why not check out wormholes. Before living in them for a couple of years, I dipped my toe in by “day tripping” with a Tengu or rattlesnake - scanning out some WHs from high/lowsec, finding a nice c3 and running all the sites. I’d recommend at least one alt as well, for scouting / rescue purposes, and a lot of reading up on wormholes. 
---
The 5 min timer for the gate only applies if no one else enters in that time. It's so you're not trapped if no one else shows up.
---
I came to suggest blockade runners, sabres and covert cyno bois, but forgot we don’t really play that game anymore. 
---
Typing in chat and linking worked for me, hopefully for you too. Dunno how the fuck they’ve managed to break this..
---
I'll look into it, but I'm not sure how I'd go about doing that. It doesn't look like a print. The framing is professional, and it looks like an original sketch to me, but I'm no expert, so I can't guarantee anything for sure😁
---
Eve uni website has a lot of “cookie cutter” fits. If you have a specific fit in mind, give me a shout, but off the top of my head, for brawling, I’d recommend the Merlin, Comet or tormentor. 
---
Also, I wasn't really looking to sell it, I mainly just wanted some info on it since I have it on my wall and people always ask about it. But, it would seems some people want to buy it, so I should probably at least look into it since some of you might appreciate it for sentimental reasons and not just the artistic part of it. 
---
Wherever you go Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brave and so on they are all comparable and have their own slightly different flavor to the same basic essentials like SRP (Ship Replacement Plan), Skillbook Packs, Training Plans, mentor programs, training and onboarding sessions to teach you how to fly, fleet up, mine/industry etc.  There are always differing pro's and con's to each, but overall creating a great new player experience is what they are about.
---
Flying expensive shit, like 2bil t1 cruisers, is one of the funnest things in eve because you get that “tingly” fear again. Removing cap insurance might bring back some of that for what is otherwise pretty boring and risk free gameplay. 
---
i can also imagine a settlement between rocks that float in the sky in a fantasy anime, too.^^
---
I think what a lot of folks are missing here is that lore is what drew in and kept many players over many MMO's. I'd argue *just as much* as gameplay.
---
EVE has some really solid lore, and a good foundation for some excellent story-telling (hence multiple books written so far). What I'm seeing as lacking in the PvE is story-telling. Going into Sansha space you are greeted with a little dialog box of a man who went crazy with power and made some pretty crazy tech. Well that's cool and all, but is that really it? Just that blurb and ... what?
---
Who are in charge of these empires and why, what goals... what are they trying to accomplish, what crazy doomsday weapons are being created that will justify some sort of response that could be fun and engaging to play, what about other alien races.... where exactly *is* this sector of space compared to Earth...
---
EVE has so much potential just sitting there waiting to be told but CCP seems apprehensive about diving in, which I can't really blame them for. EVE also happens to have some of the strongest PvP player groups ever seen. It's a massive part of this game too so they do want to cater to that crowd since it pays the bills.
---
But... they also have been dying to get some fresh blood (and wallets) here. PvP is great and all but it's kinda like 4chan or Reddit. It's a fun site but it might be a bit shocking at times. PvE ends up being a backdrop, but really if it had a spotlight for a bit then I think that could perk things up. 
---
They tried with the Space Legs thing, but never seemed to fully commit so it just sat there.
---
My two cents anywho. 
---
Go dual web armour kessie with a fistful of rockets, I think you’re in the region of 140dps (chose your flavour) and 7-8k EHP, which is p nice for a t1 frig. 
---
How about the ability to make contact notes, like "cyno alt for xxxxxxxxxx" 
---
+1 the condor is terrible
---
aaah frulegur, place where all my rl friends except one stopped playing years ago. i am the only one that survived it but i came out on top and i just went there today after years, what a coincidence
---
Yea I did the whole lowsec pirate thing way back when. It all turned into blob warfare. Back when I ran it was me and 4 buds roaming lowsec pipes and hitting haulers or mining ops. We kicked ass and any fights usually 4v4 or such. Now it’s all massive blobs. So I don’t wanna do that. Last time I was on I lived in a. C5 Wormhole, and did the sites. I didn’t like the high alert all the time. 80% of my time was spent sitting at the pos scanning down some guy who came in, or hiding from a blob of reds. I made a ton of Isk but just couldn’t keep doing the grind. 
---
I think I’ll check out the high sec abyss stuff. At least until I get legs again. Does anyone have a decent fit for that? Then I can sort of build from there. 
---
How are they doing that without local?
---
So bots are going to be able to tell who is in system without local...how?
---
I can’t help with the abyss fits, again I think eve uni and YouTube will be your best friends there. As for lowsec blobs, they do happen, but I’ve been doing frig pvp in black rise for the last year or so and maybe have been blobbed two or three times...there’s just certain areas you definitely want to avoid ) 
---
\&gt;Undock from your citadel  
---
\&gt;Bubble on the Undock  
---
\&gt;Dock up again under 30s session timer.  
---
\&gt;Shoot campers with your Citadel  
---
\&gt;If the Citadel can't clear them, you might need to actually form a gang to get rid of these bad meanies making conflict happening.  
---
\&gt;2019  
---
\&gt;Undock from NPC Station  
---
\&gt;Literally the same as now unless you're a spodbrain who doesn't know how the session change timer works. 
---
It's a real pain with a fountain pen, haha.. I have to wet my fingertip and smear a little of the ink to shade it on a post-it note scale.
---
First thank you for what you do.
---
Second I am curious about this:  "An argument broke out between Marrowbone and the rest of the team over whether we should be going to publicly announced Cyno Vigils hosted by Null-Sec entities,"
---
Would you be willing to either discuss the gist of this or what your current view is as a new group?  In particular I am curious why Null-sec entities were discussed/debated.
---
things like dscan, alts on perches, etc.
---
what the fuck do you think people in wormholes do for security? just blindly hope?
---
if a player can do it - a bot can do it more accurately and without fatigue or distraction.
---
No, dude, you stepped on my nerves when you started running your mouth about how easy it would be to fix it, and just calling the session timer a "bullshit bandaid".
---
And again, you seem to labour under this absurd premise that session timers aren't a little thing. They really, really fucking aren't. It feels like a little thing, maybe, because all you see is a ten second timer. But the reality is that it's solving a complex, poorly-understood problem in a complex, technical-debt-riddled system. So, yeah, unless you want a dev to take anywhere from two weeks to three months to work through a single session timer issue, working down that ten seconds to, what, two seconds at a theoretical minimum due to the whole one-second tick system the server runs on -- during which that dev isn't working on anything new, and isn't working on fixing anything else more pressing -- then yeah, you can learn to accept that sometimes the simple solution is the best, because the least-flawed solution takes an asstonne of work.
---
But I don't know why I'm even bothering to write this, really, because it's pretty fucking clear you're not reading it.
---
i never once claimed it was easy. feel free to quote where i did.
---
i just said it would be nice - because it would be nice.
---
How you gonna d-scan someone who is cloaked tho
---
(cap out the fit fit) Your stable with 3200s until you barely use the cap booster and cap out because you can only carry 7 charges in your cargo.
---
Not to mention kids who want you to get off the computer so they can play fortnite.
---
for me it depends on catagory of use:
---
Tristan for versatile frigate pvp
---
Catalyst for ganking
---
Venture - versatile for mining and oddly, some fun pvp.
---
Noctis, lost track of how many people have salvaged enough to buy a super with these.
---
Imicus, nice intro ship for exploration, also most will agree it is also the prettiest ship in the game, symmetrical too.
---
Slasher, pretty much a poor mans interceptor
---
No kiddos my end currently, so can't comment. But I have friends in the same boat haha
---
Never botted, I will do whatever the fuck I want in there and if I want anyone’s opinion about that I’ll give it to them. Fuck CODE.
---
Damn straight.
---
And this guy had cause. This is a legitimate beef. No way am I losing that advantage. This guy would learn the hard way not to screw with me.
---
How do people get rich in this game. I have had many things handed to me so far and still lack the ability to make real isk. I rat in a Hel that is was gifted, mine in a rorqual I was given, and do exploration. Yet I lack real income unless I buy plex and sell them on the market. I have tried doing industry even by building T1 hull that we use but I feel I'm still space poor cause I can't afford to plex all the account that I paid for at a time in the past. Am I an eve failure? Maybe it's time to win EVE and sell my gaming desktop so I can be sure I won't come back.
---
PS. Yes I have been drinking.
---
try it in Baystate Blue next time :)
---
Gotta pay attention, dude. We’re playing with fire there.
---
I heard about this before, I’d never actually seen it happen.
---
Get her an account or bubble her wormhole, then you finish your trip.
---
Also: why are you flying a fucking pod. Reship already, dude!
---
What? Thats how the siège mode works ingame. 
---
i will get married in mai and i appreciate your post
---
Easier than you think.  Just everyone drop a cloaky camper  alt  In their systems
---
Why is TAPI calling in master goon to protect it?
---
Dura and Wh0re Squad like to roll the C6 statics to try gank other C6 site runners. Just their thing. 
---
No code fuchsia memes yet?  I'm dissapointed in y ou all.
---
&gt; your arguments do not address these massive advantages 
---
I did. I said: Burn it down. I also argued that, since CCP has given some more options to empire builders (Citadels, essentially), the game changed for the better and I've backed that with numbers. Numbers you haven't looked at nor did you made an attempt to argue against me interpretation.   
---
You didn't read most of that, which is sad but since you a moron it doesn't matter much anyway.
---
You're definitely doing something wrong if you're not making good money in a supercarrier. Are you using heavy fighters, and do you otherwise have good support skills for it? (e.g. Minmatar Carrier IV)
---
What kind of money are you making with it, and what do you consider 'good money'?
---
When the title of the post describes the beginning middle and end, it's a lot less enticing to watch.  Just got the whole story of yet another rorqual dying again.
---
Did you even watch it, it was a very well managed fleet and there's plenty to be gained from watching it, and the fact that the title says exactly what it is is probably a good thing don't you think? O.o
---
Working on the skills now but with 60m Skill points injectors are about worthless. 300m per hour or close would be really nice. I just finished JDC 5 before I hot the hel so I'm not looking forward to fighters 5 and all those other skills to 4 when I still can't fly a dread. I tend to spend about 2-3 hours at a time ratting but think crowded systems might be more of a problem. I sometimes warp to 5 sites to find an empty one. 
---
Yeah, you're right. just trying to see one that works tho : p
---
I got one tho now, it will do, thanks to people here.
---
yeah I sorta regret going into the panther, the sin is next on my list to train
---
I don't know who gulnar is : /
---
EVE online, a game in which old prics tell themselves how edgy and special they are, while only ever mining.
---
This would affect a huge portion of the playerbase who aren't bots so it's not a good idea
---
Awesome work.... Can you do a hel? Would look amazing in this style. 
---
Slapping someone with your penis can sometimes be fulfilling
---
Did you try the [wiki](https://github.com/exodus4d/pathfinder/wiki/Installation)? Pathfinder has good documentation for setting it up in an Apache or Nginx.
---
The lowest Digital Ocean should be more than enough to host Pathfinder for a small corp. You could easily run Pathfinder, TS3, and a killboard on that small droplet. 
---
Thoughts and prayers....
---
Christ this looks so amazing /u/ccp_falcon revelation model update pls :D   
---
We have PC's for this kind of graphics now. 
---
We need model upgrade ... we can have this kind of graphics now 
---
He's flying in highsec my dude, probably in a trainer clone, the only one he flies.
---
Yep tbh there should be a hard limit 3 locations max ... and like 5-6 clones in each location. 
---
**Can we please have a high quality picture/scan of this**           
---
TY
---
40K Does have some ships that are even larger than player Titans. However nothing that would be the size of the first titans, which were basically same size as a moon.
---
40K Weaponry does seem more lethal though, weapons to destroy a planet, to kill all life in it with one weapon. Hard to say really. Space wise, probably EVE, planet destruction wise, probably 40k.
---
Great, don't watch it then, this is what a title should do, I ain't no scum bag click bait journalist 
---
Condor should be max dps &amp; speedtanked, so preferably with a TD, and only used in specific matchups.
---
What did we have to do in this event?
---
So you support them getting treatment with confidentiality to avoid making them a pariah? How else are you going to get them help before they are convicted?
---
Eve doesn't have something that you can perform the exterminatus with? 
---
I don't recall anything that could do that in EVE
---
Pretty sure 40k would smash eve outta the park. Compare the size of Eve to 40k. Now, if you unite ALLL the factions of Eve together and duke it out in one system, there MIGHT be a chance.
---
I would trade a 30s local delay for a spool up decloaking upwell thingy in a heartbeat
---
that doesn't give anywhere near the same level of security, because logoff traps are a thing.
---
Well, boarding actions would be the real killer here.
---
I'm interested in joining Bombers Bar how do i find the entrance to their staging wormhole? cheers
---
40k imperium of man, they have the man power. They don't even blink when whole solar systems of humans are deleted. Eve throws a fit at a few slaves on 1 planet.
---
There is a lot of stuff which never bothered people in the past but started to be quite important. Human rights are one of examples. Following your logic HR should not be taken seriously.
---
titans can
---
It’s not, you should do it 
---
i know it's casual on the internet to find people who speak latin very well, but that's not a common subst so just use "proteus" even as you are talking about more of them. 
---
Tom B was a dev, oveur was a producer, kieron was a community manager and I forget what lemonde did. 
---
Hush mate, let them figure it out
---
ytho
---
Redeemer pilot here. Just any blops will have a price tag
---
The imperium of man. It wouldn’t even be a contest.
---
The imperium has around 600,000 capital ships (cruiser and above, a 40k cruiser is slightly bigger than a EVE dread) which are each vastly better armed and protected than anything in EVE.
---
For example imperial navy can fire at targets tens of thousands of kilometres away and have common weaponry that can casually create black holes to destroy the enemy. And their defences go beyond mere technological armour plating and shields. Void shields, for example, absorb attacks and displace them directly into hell and not only that but can be so powerful they can prevent inter dimensional travel through them or even stop radio waves. 
---
In addition to that they have over 3 million escort craft and even some of the escorts are capable of carrying weaponry more powerful than a Titan’s doomsday such as melta or vortex torpedos.
---
Good fight, thanks to all parties for hard work
---
Soooo when did he steal your stuff??
---
Depends if the imperium can figure out warp disruptors. If not, Eve ships could just run circles around them and beat them to any target.
---
EVE, where the biggest expression of trust is "he wouldn't steal **everything**. Just most of it"
---
Damn that puts things into perspective. But the empires surely have thousands of ipetian titans as well which are moon sized according to someone else in the thread
---
There’s nothing in the lore or beyond that a Titan’s DD can destroy a planet. It’s probably a city-level attack at best. 
---
yeah there is, the whole caldari/gallente war said a titan dded that one planet and nuked it
---
Hmm, /u/ccp_falcon can you help out? I think i remember you mentioning eve population as in the trillions? If so yeah eve would lose since ive read imperium has around 40 quadrillion souls 
---
You can run it on free tire AWS. 
---
PvP Brawler fits do not work out very well in PvE, quite the opposite. They are doable, but its a PITA, here are some starter PvE fits for you, these are all alpha ships and alpha skills, replace T2 modules, rigs with T1 stuff where you don't have the skills available and you can use faction ammo instead of the T2 ammo. the PvP fits you can get from the guide posted, they are pretty good.
---
Anyways, here are the PvE fits for you, these are for very low end PvE, like starting lvl 1-2 security missions, up to level 3 in a pair of Worms, but there are like 2 L3 missions you won't be able to do with them or may have difficulties, especially if you go solo. So be ready to warp out if need. Starting from the cheapest:
---
\[Kestrel, \*Simulated Kestrel Fitting\]
---
Limited Adaptive Invulnerability Field I
---
Small F-S9 Regolith Compact Shield Extender
---
Small C5-L Emergency Shield Overload I
---
Light Missile Launcher II
---
Small Processor Overclocking Unit I
---
Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
---
Small Semiconductor Memory Cell II
---
Inferno Fury Light Missile x212
---
.
---
\[Worm, \*Simulated Worm Fitting\]
---
Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
Small Semiconductor Memory Cell I
---
Hobgoblin II x4
---
Hornet II x1
---
Inferno Fury Light Missile x159
---
\[Gnosis, \*Simulated Gnosis Fitting\]
---
Power Diagnostic System II
---
Missile Guidance Enhancer II
---
Large Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
Large C5-L Emergency Shield Overload I
---
Large F-S9 Regolith Compact Shield Extender
---
50MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
Heavy Assault Missile Launcher II
---
Medium Processor Overclocking Unit I
---
Medium Warhead Rigor Catalyst I
---
Hobgoblin II x5
---
Hammerhead II x5
---
Inferno Rage Heavy Assault Missile x330
---
The Gnosis you can do all L3s and some L4s even but relatively few unless you go omega and heavily bling it and that is just not worth it as by that time you will have much better options available. Hpe this helps you guys out a bit.
---
???? When? Where? That didn’t happen as far as I’m aware. The Titan Shiigeru spent months bombing Caldari Prime and didn’t do anything like that kind of damage.
---
Imo would walk it. They just have so many more resources compared to the Empires of eve. The weaponry is more lethal too. The 40k universe is literally designed around everything is turned up to 11.
---
BUBBLE MY WORMHOLE DADDY
---
&gt;I find it that the people
---
I don't care what you think. I find people that try to dodge arguments until called out multiple times and which fail to adress arguments with arguments irrelevant and replacable. Does that stop me from trying to have a discussion with a vile retard that can't follow a discussion and doesn't behave properly for a discussion? Obviously, the answer is no.   
---
So, you finally recognized that you need more people. Tell me once again - &gt; why should 5 man be able to deal with a construct made of thousands. 
---
  
---
Now, you don't like the idea of getting proper manpower? I am sure you don't. Just because you call "blobbing" stupid doesn't mean "I don't like it" isn't a proper way to do things.   
---
I said it again =&gt; alliances have the numbers advantage and while you can make up for some numbers with skill, it will stop working eventually. So, at some point, you better realize that you have all the tools, but you just refuse to use them and refusing to use the tools you have and cry to CCP because you want them to do it for you, is childish.   
---
That could be a proper description for you too - you don't realize what arguments are, you can't handle them properly and you can't discuss things properly. You cry for changes to be centered around your playstyle just like kids usually cry to get their way. Luckily, it doesn't work that way in the grown up world. 
---
I care
---
to create just two iapetans, an entire planet had to be stripped clean
---
the empires at most have like a handful each
---
Join the "Bombers Bar" channel in-game, all the info should be there. Basically they schedule a fleet in advance, tell everyone to meet up in some HS system, then travel together to the wormhole connection, where their scouts lead the fleet in. You don't stay in the wormhole long-term, only during fleets. 
---
D-scan solves this in J-space already, and your rhetoric can easily be reversed - you just want to be spoon fed content without risk of being hunted. Why shouldn’t you have to pay attention to your surroundings?
---
There's a good mix of TZ coverage in the groups I've listed.  Most of them have activity within EUTZ, well maybe except the shit ones, you'd never know they're logged in!
---
Aww, come on, man. Grow a pair. Fly some of the nice ships!
---
/I had a doctrine fit Maelstrom. I was so proud of, it cost so much money. I lost track of the fleet and ended up in a gate camp. Goddamn those were 40 of the most intense seconds in EVE ever [for me] :-). Bob have mercy, but if that 1400mm artillery lands it kicks like a fucking mule :-).
---
Damn that place is so much fun :-)
---
Fantastic! Thanks for the reply
---
Thousands? Try 4.
---
The Amarr only built 2 Iapetan Titans. The Caldari-Gallente war saw the use of a single Iapetan Titan on each side.
---
After that they continued to build Titans, but the smaller ones similar to what the capsuleers use.
---
That's why I only love Aura
---
Lots of tools exist to protect yourself without local - gate control and d-scan being the obvious two, it’s how we do it in J-space. You say that hunters should get good, but where are you exhibiting any skill in avoiding being hunted?
---
idk im not a lore expert, if a mining drill can blow a hole in a fucking moon that's tens of miles across it's easy to see a weapon doing 100x more damage
---
Docking request granted!
---
This war is really becoming a lot of fun. 
---
A Sin.
---
I tried out a calm electrical and did pretty good. Used an omen with t2 fit. Total cost me less then 32m. Finished it with about 2 minutes to spare. I didn’t get 2 of the nodes in the last room - the battleship spawn took 2 minutes to kill, but I was able to tank the damage ok and burn thru the spawns easy enough. Not bad. I might look at eventually upgrading to a zealot, and eventually maybe absolution. 
---
what a nerd
---
Oveur, now there's a name I hadn't heard in a while!
---
The Enterprise
---
I kinda disagree here, quite a lot actually. We have plenty of PvE stuff we can do that allows us to break off, or warp off and dock up for when we wanna go get a drink or whatever, and as pointed out elsewhere. When I PvE I usually like to break my PvE sessions to 1 hour intervals, as I tend to do the harder stuff, or stuff in what are considered sub-optimal and underpowered ships to challenge myself. Quite literally. Often times though I have to take booster for it, usually a 20% rep one, which lasts 1 hour and is perfect for my attention span. For example, I did some L4s recently, full clears in a blaster Moa, just to mess around while waiting on fleets etc. and as a "proof of concept" to myself. And it worked.
---
So now when I switch to NS, the PvE seems very bad and actually, magnitudes less challenging then doing L4s in a Moa.
---
The game is progressing, we have entered the stage where multiboxing and super ratting are becoming the norms, even titan ratting is on the rise. Pretty soon, in a not too distant future, the way things are going, we will be multiboxing Titans for PvE. This is a guarantee.
---
Meanwhile, the PvE content is just not balanced for that. It needs to be rebalanced to accomodate multiboxed titan fleets of 5-30 titans at a time. I know we are not there just yet, but will be soon and all these players will need something engaging not just AFK their fleets, and the PvE ought to be rebalanced so that it can actually hold for a while, so with thought towards that. Likewise with mining. Mining has to be rebalanced to accomodate multiboxed mining fleets, and this, unlike the combat PvE, we already need and have needed for a long time.
---
Just some thoughts ...
---
It's almost as if Bombs are good against alliances that rely on just bringing as many anchor up, F1, Spodbrains as possible.
---
What? Are you stupid? The bots are all running from a handful of computers on the same network. They just tell eachother.
---
Why would it affect a huge portion of the playerbase? Because literally everyone in the game relies on local, it's the quickest way to make an informed decision otherwise you'd have to warp to a safe place and start scanning or have an alt scout the route ahead or constantly have an eye on gates. It's an unnecessary complication which would only make people miserable and only favour pvpers.
---
That's not important tho? If the Imperium launched a full scale invasion into New Eden, they could just sit on objectives and dare the natives to do something about it. They also have 100x the range of normal EVE vessels. 
---
So TEST hosted a Cyno Vigil for one of their members, who recently died, and they posted it on reddit. A few mods from B4R went to it as B4R representatives. 
---
Now apparently another Null-sec alliance hosted one a Cyno Vigil at a point before, which nobody attended. So we were accused of bias. So the argument was whether we should be attending the vigils. 
---
It was then later found out that the null-sec alliance never publicised it which is why nobody attended. 
---
It has uses, and a whole lot of potential, but I would say there are ships that perform better in every way. It needs either a decent DPS or speed boost, in my opinion. 
---
widotting is the answer
---
legacy coalition is basically tapi and then critical mass of highsec doofs who think their culture is unique and they couldn't possible take their 8 guys and merge into a larger organization but want to live in null
---
As an aside, a few of the parallels between the Amarr and the IoM are amusing, down to their weaponry.
---
I quite love the Punisher and flying “Las Tackle”.
---
the exact same way it works in a wormhole.
---
&gt; You just indicated that people can screw you over and that ‘you’ll get over it’ in due time. Maybe not the most ideal philosophy to go through life.
---
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
---
I'm all for more gradiant as some else said where is all the other numbers.
---
Post this in the little things forum thread.
---
the imperium of man shits all over any other sci-fi world.
---
the 40k universe is that batshit absurd in scale that it's not even remotely based on any semblance of reality as they aren't trying to be plausible unlike almost every other sci-fi world that does try to be plausible.
---
Think of it this way: Is it really worth your time to spend years to get revenge for something that barely affects your real life?
---
Yes: Do it
---
No: Don't do it.
---
Completely sucked dry.. 
---
&gt;PLEX are skyrocketing.
---
Are you in a position where you can just buy plex?
---
Not really, there is a reason I don't buy PLEXes or sub with real money :/
---
If you're in a good wormhole, do pi on 3 characters there. Go rat some to bling some ships in a C5. Should be most of what you need.
---
plex is skyrocketing since so many people are quitting, those on the fence refuse to pay real money and are just plexing until isk runs out
---
no clue tbh, haven't once looked at it seeing how underused it is
---
The Phalanx is the largest single ship in 40k, no hard dimensions but it's moon sized so it could be close in size to the old Eve titans.
---
So they don't. Got it.
---
Since when has this fucking game changed to cater to god damn krabs. What the fuck
---
tru tru
---
Is it possible in Thera ?
---
IMO making isk is not supposed to be fun. I will rat for hours mainly because of the bullshitting with other people on comms. Find something that makes making isk fun and you'll never worry about it again. 
---
The thing is, it won't get better if it goes like that, cause I clearly won't pay 5B a month for 2 accounts. 
---
except they do. clearly you've never lived in a wormhole.
---
well, large scale deployments.
---
About small scale deployments I have no idea, but considering what sometimes comes up randomly, I expect there are alot more on the small scale.
---
Also you say "number of alliances" the deployments I mentioned, contain often multiple alliances. If you count every alliance separately, the number gets high, very high:
---
Deployed is currently:
---
- Test (on 2 fronts)
---
- Skillu
---
- Horde
---
- NC.
---
- Imperium sigs (all over the place, multiple alliances)
---
- Scourge. 
---
- Legacy (nearly all alliances, 5+)
---
- TRI
---
- Prothean
---
- Unspoken
---
- Tickle (other non-legacy deployment)
---
- Snuffed
---
That's only from the alliances deployed I know off.
---
When looking at the coalition map, that is 5/8 larger coalitions involved in an active conflict. With Winter Coalition stuck in a NIP for another 2 months, though they sometimes fight in the conflict they cannot yet actively join in yet. That leaves Provi and GotG out of conflicts (Provi have regular skirmishes but are not deployed). 
---
There is constantly stuff brewing and heating up. There was rarely more skirmishes on a regular basis. There is no large scale invasion going on yes, but it's far from being stale.
---
it's the mmo death feedback loop
---
people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying so people quit because the game is dying 
---
do passive things for isk.
---
i plex my account purely on activities that don't require any input other than saying "start extractor/job".
---
This is the type of explanation I was looking for, thanks for that and appreciate the time you took to comment that :)
---
I think insurance is fine, without insurance there is little reason to fly battleships in the game (not that there is one right now with current capitals). Also keeping pvp losses affordable is a good thing.
---
What's obvious is that Feroxes are OP right now and I'd rather CCP nerf them. 
---
&gt;I don't care what you think. I find people that try to dodge arguments until called out multiple times and which fail to adress arguments with arguments irrelevant and replacable. Does that stop me from trying to have a discussion with a vile retard that can't follow a discussion and doesn't behave properly for a discussion? Obviously, the answer is no.
---
Whine about me being "vile" and automatically call people names. If you're going to talk shit, talk shit. Don't whine cause someone said a mean thing to you. And I haven't avoided any of your points. Why the fuck are you still talking about your delusion from 4 days ago.
---
&gt;Now, you don't like the idea of getting proper manpower? I am sure you don't. Just because you call "blobbing" stupid doesn't mean "I don't like it" is a proper argument though.
---
"I don't like it" isn't my argument. My argument is that krabs have increasingly more and more advantages. And no skill krabs like you feel empowered because of that.
---
&gt;I said it again =&gt; alliances have used their numbers advantage to create advantages for themself and while you can make up for some numbers with skill, it will stop working eventually. So, at some point, you better realize that you have all the tools, but you just refuse to use them and refusing to use the tools you have and cry to CCP because you want them to do it for you, is childish.
---
Just blobbing like you isn't "the tools."
---
&gt;That could be a proper description for you too - you don't realize what arguments are, you can't handle them properly and you can't discuss things properly. You cry for changes to be centered around your playstyle just like kids usually cry to get their way. Luckily, it doesn't work that way in the grown up world.
---
That's a lot of words for someone just hiding behind a blob with all the factors in their favor. Luckily those sort of environments attract idiots like you which I suppose is kind of a balance.
---
&gt;Oh and I've said it before and I will say it again =&gt; I am not against changes to local, I am just for being reasonable with changes while adressing possible concerns. You've still failed to adress 2 of the 4 problems I've listed properly (i.e. with arguments instead of "I don't like it").
---
I've addressed every single point. YOU stopped addressing points.
---
&gt;If you can't deal with 1000 players against you, maybe pick a smaller entity or bring the necessary manpower and tools for the job. Tell me how that is stupid. In other words: why should you be entitled to kill every target easily no matter what they do and how many they are? It's l ike asking for going 5 against 500 and then demand to win.
---
I'm not trying to fight a thousand people at once by myself. And honestly if 1000 of you are afraid of me if local went away just shows how big of a pathetic krab you are. Nobody is asking to nerf YOU. I'm saying local is over powered in conjunction with all the other tools that have been HANDED to you.
---
I mean, I get it that it's not supposed to be fun, but the thing is, carrier/super ratting is really overboring for the risk and the input you need. I make more with two incursion chars than a Nidh in null, it's kinda nice but well, same as ratting, it get's boring quick sometimes. 
---
I don't think EVE is dying tbh. Yes, the univers is way too large for a niche game like this, but well... And yeah, fuck local. 
---
i never get enough of running reliks and relikers
---
I do right now. And you are full of shit if you say that limited local wouldn't hurt botting.
---
I’ve no knowledge of the 40k universe, but that was an interesting read, cheers! 
---
one way I handle the boringness of isk making is when I am pressed for time or just trying to make a certain amount in a time limit. Makes me actually care(sometimes).
---
because game is boring,full of afk pve and bots....wish they got the balls and introduce new mecanics to thetering(no theter while u got npc timer or agression timer)
---
A fitted ferox is around 50mil after insurance, so its still like 9.5b loss. But yeah, 14b is hardly accurate.
---
drag the module around
---
True enough
---
To think all those times the nagging wife tried to drag to me to some thrift store / yard sale/ flea Market .......
---

---
Mow someones lawn, work a shift at burger king or smuggle crack cocaine in your anus. Srsly. Unless you live in a third world country, why would you ever waste your time grinding for gametime ingame.
---
it's dying, just look at the population charts and recognize that the game is the lowest it's been in a decade and yet:
---
1) There are more bots doing more profitable activities than ever
---
2) There are more people multiboxing and people capable of multiboxing higher numbers of characters than ever
---
3) The game is free-to-play, turning the barrier of entry to playing eve to zero
---
Imperium of man. Hands down.
---
atomic booleans are a performance mass murderer when it comes to distributed environments.
---
it wouldn't.
---
you're pretending bots would never be updated to deal with local being removed - which is the most retarded assumption i've ever seen on this sub.
---
This. So much…
---
I started playing Eve because shooting people in spaceships looked fun, and paying for my sub. A little PVE at first, to try and afford some ships. Then I made a friend who enjoyed the industry part of Eve, and would help me out with things to go explode most of the time.  
---
Eventually I tried incursions to put a little extra in my wallet, also eventually falling on harder times RL, and couldn't afford my sub. Feeling obligated to grind incursions so I could play, yet missing out why I even started playing was the cringiest shit ever. I understand completely about losing the will to live.
---
Decided if I couldn't pay my sub, then I should probably find something else to do with my time. Happened a couple times. Sounds bad, but is what it is.
---
Protip. Horde is the Scientology of Eve. I've seen their pings. 
---
No, you implied with "instead of" that "correct fixes" are as easy to do as "bullshit band aids".
---
Read what you wrote.
---
Too real. I joined the PLEX until ISK runs out group a couple months ago when my subs expired.
---
you did. You did not say it would be nice ; you said it would nice instead.
---
**THAT’S AGAINST THE EULA!!!**
---
a lot of wormholers live in Thera. Unless you are blue to them, you'll get raped very quickly.
---
If you are living in Thera you arent a wormholer btw
---
OMG that's so true :D
---
i said it would be nice if we could have proper fixes instead of bullshit bandaids
---
that says nothing about the difficulty. saying one thing is nicer than another makes no inference on any level of difficulty.
---
yes, it would be nice to have a proper fix instead of a bandaid fix
---
none of this references difficulty at all.
---
only one situation can be present, that's why it's an 'instead'.
---
It's easier to work an hour in real life than it is to mine an hour in eve
---
You need lots of FC's to deploy offensively. Many of the good FC's have already quit or are burned out from herding sheep around. You can't do anything offensive without FC's in Eve. 
---
CCP has slowly increased the time &amp; effort needed for pvp :-(
---
you and so many others
---
game is gonna hit a brick wall soon and finally it'll be over and CCP will have reaped what they sowed
---
Returning player here too, thanks for the concise summary.
---
Need Cap on Sir Edmund 
---
and you can make more with two burners accounts in HS than with a super in null, for less APM.
---
It's kinda easy to make 200-250 M/h with one toon in HS burner, however the toon swappin reduces that a bit, I am  only half of that with second burner toon (but no implants, no max skills). In some cases you can make more, right now I had consistent 330 M/h for one toon.
---
I think  250 * numberoftoons^0.6 should be a correct approximation of the hourly gain.
---
As long as PVP in Eve is extremely engaging &amp; fun then you have a reason to grind PVE because you have a purpose for the isk you are grinding. Back in the "golden years" of Eve PVE wasn't a problem because you really needed isk to fuel the war machines. If you want to boost PVE to have more meaning then you actually have to boost PVP.
---
it's not passive. You still need to reset your exactractors, move them, move your PI. IT's actually a lot active, for an isk gain/active time comparable to the one you have in a super.
---
Gigx's Child
---
[Yes it does](https://imgur.com/a/6v3g48u)
---
yes it does reference that they have the same cost. Especially in the context of you sentence.
---
A sandworm 
---
yes, that precisely says that you discard the cost of having this.
---
It would NOT be nice to have this BECAUSE the cost of having this is too expensive and thus may prevent CCP from making more important things.
---
The way you formulate your shitty sentence, you imply that it is only a matter of choice. IT IS NOT.
---
Local is just for krabs? ok..that makes no sense.
---
go more or less all rorqs but if youre not in delve get a jf pilot then. if you really wanna splurge get like 3 or 4 rorq pilots a jf pilot and a fax pilot.
---
to be clear : "it would be nice if X instead of Y" IMPLIES by itself that you consider that X and Y are as easily reachable.
---
As in, "it would be nice if you minded your own business instead of claiming things you have no idea about".
---
also forgot to mention on each of your empty slots fill it with a cyno toon. as a cap pilot this will give you a lot of diversity on where you can setup.
---
EVE Online: Assholes win
---
[removed]
---
Always love some history and just general videos like this. Great vid.
---
If making the ISK to run your accounts isn't worth it then just buy the accounts to actually want to play with with real money. How many accounts do you actually need? Maybe 2?
---
This is one reason why nullsec ratting needs a big nerf - it devalues ISK so other ways of PLEXing become impractical. The ways to make ISK should also be things that involve playing the game in an engaging way.
---
What
---
That's K-Space, come to wormhole space if you want to incorporate stealth in engagements. Just watch out as there's always a cloaked up T3C behind you.
---
nice virus
---
5 minutes of clicking a day plus 30 minutes of transporting it hardly equals super ratting
---
If you are referring to the statistics provided from [eve-offline.com](https://eve-offline.com), you might did the same mistake i did in the past.
---
If you look at the last year, the site is taking the average playercount from each individual day but if you go further in the past, the site only takes the daily peak for its calculation.
---
this is the best. my god &lt;3
---
This. So this. I try to say the same thing to everyone I encounter who grinds for PLEX. It's not worth your fucking time. It's how people burn out and quit the game.
---
Ratting/mining to do ingame stuff like buy/build ships or shit is OK because you don't "have to" get to a goal within a certain point to be able to even play. And you can scale up/down your ISK making efforts based on needs. And even then mix it up.
---
No 
---
I live in a 3rd world country, but im always subbed for 12months. Grinding sucks balls
---
But can The Imperium fight through the inevitable TiDi?
---
I mean the real eve player would just wardec the Raitaru and kill it. 
---
Whatever alliance you choose , once they started asking for isk or asset before you join,then you know you either talked to the wrong person or chose the wrong Corp 
---
I think with almost 4 million ships in system, there wouldn't be any TiDi in game. It would be in Real Time.
---
&gt;goon code
---
&gt;isboxer
---
Lmfao what could go wrong
---
&gt;Whine about me being "vile" and automatically call people names. If you're going to talk shit, talk shit. Don't whine cause someone said a mean thing to you. And I haven't avoided any of your points. Why the fuck are you still talking about your delusion from 4 days ago.
---
I don't whine, I just return the favor. You cried about this mean dude that you called a bitchy neckbeard before resorting to return the favor. Vile retard is just an adequate description for you and that's it.   
---
&gt; "I don't like it" isn't my argument. My argument is that krabs have increasingly more and more advantages. And no skill krabs like you feel empowered because of that. 
---
Yes of course it is your argument. You don't like bringing adequate numbers for the job, thus you refuse it as a solution to the advantages other players have build for themselves. Again: you cry so much about capitals and how an umbrella has made your enemies safer, but why do you cry when you have the tools to take that away?   
---
Because you are lazy, to loss averse and to socially inept to be able to get a group together and do something against it. That's your entire point. 
---
&gt; Just blobbing like you isn't "the tools." 
---
So, bringing 1:1 numbers is blobbing? So everything except fighting severely outnumbered is "blobbing". Sure, if that's your definition then take it. I don't consider a 1:1 numbers ratio a blobfight but then again that's just me.  
---
Bringing adequate numbers for the job is a tool you just refuse to use. 
---
&gt; I've addressed every single point. YOU stopped addressing points. 
---
Then finally tell me about your conclusion about the numbers that I've presented. Because, so far, you didn't. If you did, quote it.
---
&gt; I'm not trying to fight a thousand people at once by myself.  
---
You are trying to use the argument of "Small gangs can't compete with the alliances" as a reason to remove local. That's what you are trying by crying about the advantages players have built for themselves and which you could take down and tear apart if you would stop refusing to use adequate tools for the job.   
---
Ofc you can't fight a 1000+ Alliance with your 5 dudes in frigates/BS's. Why? Because they have superiour numbers and superior tools for the job. Why I don't consider this a problem? Because the same tools these people use are available for you to play with too. 
---
The problem with missions is that they haven't been meaningfully charged in a decade. 
---
How is the market in Thera? Maybe there some space for hauling cap charges, nano paste, combat boosters or ammo/drones?
---
I like having a big universe. If infinity universe came out together and had all the complicated mechanics of eve I'd switch in a heart beat
---
don't ask people to actually check facts, its easier to just cry "eve is dying" constantly for over a decade
---
No
---
This is awesome :o
---
It looks like it's aligning out to warp.
---
Just pay for your account. A 1y sub is £90 even when there isn't a sale on. 
---
Plexing your account is neither a right nor an obligation. If you're doing work you dont enjoy to buy plex, then you're effectively working a 1/5th minimum wage job you hate in order to play a game.
---
You. Are. A. Legend. 
---
i live in a first world country being a university student and working on the side to pay for my needs as well as my mom's because she is ill.
---
while i find it funny that you say just mow someones lawn, it is not always possible. if i could do that for some extra money i'd still save it for medication and other expenses.
---
Ratting in wormholes (C5) will net you 500 million ISK per site. It will take you about 23-25 minutes to run a site with 3 rattles. You're limited by site respawns unless you're prepared to krab in your static.
---
Ultimately if your goal is to play a lot and farm a lot less than you play, wormhole sites are your best bet.
---
The old iapteans caused tidal shifts when they moved too close to a planet. Thats pretty close to exterminatus if you do it deliberately
---
If you don’t mind could you expand a bit on that, I’m pretty new so I’m trying to understand how the whole alt fleet thing works, also thank you for your help
---
&gt;Unless you live in a third world country, why would you ever waste your time grinding for gametime ingame.
---
This. At 100 mill/hour you're effectively generating 1.05 dollars per hour doing something that sucks ass. It will also take you ~18-20 hours. Work 1-2 hours of overtime per month instead and save 16-18 hours of free time for fun stuff.
---
Eula of what? Eve or diablo 2?
---
About the same as BCs really 
---
ADCs could use a nerf though I agree - the issue isn’t specific to the muninn. Mwd eagles and ishtars have some pretty obnoxious numbers 
---
Feroxes and Canes are broken
---
Harbingers suck
---
Drakes suck
---
Brutixes lmao
---
K? 
---
&gt; This war
---
?
---
All of this except the dumb part of living in a third world country. I live in one, have a job and pay 5 subs.
---
The whole point of the moon mining changes was to combat this autonomous massive income generation. I say no. I realize bots and other afk and alt stackable nonsense still exists but I'm also against all of that.
---
Pretty much this. I sometimes get the feel that some EvE players think, buying and selling plex is frown on or sth alike. But if you´re not a teenager it is pretty inefficient to "farm" ISK and buy plex for ISK. No matter how hard I would try, it´s always a loss compared to work and use my freetime to enjoy the game/doing other things. 
---
For a year of subscribing people in "middle Europe" need to work like 1hour or maybe 3hours if you´re in a low payed job. So no matter what, you can´t farm that much ISK ingame in the same time. 
---
Cash bless you beautiful first world children! 
---
Sure but when I say passive I don't mean it in the sense of active/passive listening I'm saying that they aren't pushing things forward and being aggressive.
---
Active listening is a very important thing to make sure takes place and I don't see a lack of it with the discord. v0v
---
If you are new, AFK shouldn't be a consideration.
---
If you're not new, AFK shouldn't be a consideration.
---
This is a game, play it!
---
You don't need a heap of ISK to play, explore, fight, whatever.
---
I mean that’s the thing, I don’t want to spend my time grinding isk on my main.. My plan was to have alts make me some isk while I enjoy myself on my main and sustain my losses. I really enjoy pvp and exploring wormholes, but I tend to die often so I’m still practicing.
---
Probably for the best.
---
Also, cat ears when?
---
Drag the module around or turn the autocycle off. 
---
I like to think its more the assumption that 3rd world incomes are low enough that an hour in the office would earn less than an hour in game.              
---
          
---
Whilst true of the national average there are exceptions to every rule. 
---
Then pick smaller ships or something.
---
You don't need an army of alts to fund playing a game.
---
AFKing is a not an engaging activity to be planning for
---
Who wants to win forever?
---
he was not wrong 
---
Coming next expansion - standings skins, only 5000 PLEX a month
---
I am picking smaller ships, but the losses rack up. My point was I don’t want want to get burned out from the game by grinding isk, that’s why I wanted to make alts to have a bit of income on the side.. Obviously it’s not an engaging activity, or else I would have to actively play multiple accounts simultaneously. 
---
Try manufacturing literally the only thing I do in this game is making ships and growing my wallet for no reason since I don't spend that ISK other than building more ships... for others to lose.
---
ADC and emergency hull energisers should be removed
---
Don't touch the Rev! Ffs. Best looking ship in the game.
---
EHE is pretty shit now 
---
I still think it will improve cap battles... More shit dying
---
cannot unsee!
---
Low sec heading to Jita, aligning. Random cyno points you/ couple of tables bombers point you. Guess I’ll die.
---
so you have 1 main toon on each account. and 2 empty free character slots then just create a toon throw a skill injector on each toon to get to cyno III or IV and move those toons to places where you may need a cyno. so you dont have to move 10-20 jumps each time you need a cyno.
---
*That's* how void shields work? TIL

It'd be a draw, the node would crash. 
---
Pathfinder and siggy have pretty well documented security holes.
---
Why not work and afk mine at the same time?
---
As shitty as it sounds, I would recommend paying the sub with irl money. Unless you really like pve, it isn't worth the time and effort to plex your account.
---
Pathfinder and Siggy have pretty well documented security holes.
---
Everyone has pretty much turned into a full time Krab and war is not something Eve players really want or they would be out there starting wars.

Yeah probably
---
&gt; Do we need more passive activities in eve?
---
Yes. Increased tedium doesn’t enrich game experience
---

No contest
---
I don’t give a fuck. Posts fits 😂 
---
Just don't plex your account then? Seems like a very small price to not have to do a bunch of shit you hate doing.
---
&gt;Glotis
---
Agree on what you say, though most people don't mean it like that. It's kind of tiring the meme of 3rd world people living in flip flop land and in caves.
---
Concord will kill any criminals that break the rules of engagement. If imperium of man attacked empires of eve, they'd find themselves slain in mere minutes! If they survive then they broke game rules and are therefor banned!
---
So you don’t get fired.

#fullofshit
---
You admitted that you don't actually do PI, and all that you know about it comes from an experiment you did 3 years ago.
---
Here is the sum total of what i know about wh40k vs other fictional universes:
---
wh40k is n+bullshit where bullshit is whatever force level you were thinking of plus infinity. To the point where it isn't even fun having a discussion because wh40k fans already have some kind of multiverse destroying power level already come up with as rebuttal to whatever it was you were going to say before you even thought of it.
---
Steal assets 
---
Sell assets
---
But plex
---
Works in game and irl 
---
Well I'd assume that if your only invisible in local during your gate timer, then you would appear in local upon logging in to the system
---
yeah I admitted that I did PI 3 years ago for long enough to understand that what people claim and what they really do are two very different things.
---
Are you aware of how fleets are actually generated? Seriously, you and all the idiots downvoting, have you ever hunted before, scouted out targets for an FC etc? Or are you all downvoting me because you think content delivers itself on a silver platter if people just undock and roam?
---
These bad-faith, coy arguments are hilarious because of how much of a waste of time they are on your part. The overarching theme of everything CCP has been developing for the last five-plus years is to encourage players to be logged in and actively playing the game. Alongside this, they’ve also been eliminating activities that you can do outside the game, passively, especially when it comes to the economy. 
---
Why would they, after nearing the end of this big development roadmap, suddenly reverse decision and start adding passive-income generation back into the game?
---
It is not going to happen. 
---
Not only easier, but more efficient, can perk up your resume, meet new people, all the while making dank isk/h. 
---
6B ? Lol thats nothing. 100B + is common for most null seccers now.

At least he only has one account. Proof that he can still come back to you. Once he get a few multiboxes going he will be too far gone. 
---
Great same here. Except b4r is a bastardization of that and isn't any better than a church asking for offerings
---
FACTS! 
---
You say that, but every time I do it my killboard gets sadder. Also more hilarious. I wish more of them weren't just "undocked from 4-4 and instasploded".
---
I think I sawr a ring.
---
That's not the kind of "activity" we're talking about. Fights over any given moon prior to Lifeblood occurred once every 2-3 years, at most, with rare exceptions. These fights rarely lasted more than an hour or two. Compare this with moon fracks, which pop off anywhere from six to 56 days and take many manhours to clean up. 
---
what's your point?
---
you're a nobody
---
There is forgiveness for infractions, which I believe should be an integral part of the human experience, and then there is stepping over the line. 
---
It’s true that you can’t lash out indiscriminately, I would say that there is merit to the idea that people should understand that you’re only going to accept so much bullshit before ‘something’ is done about it.
---
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, but always being the guy who gets kicked in the nuts your entire life, you don’t get old with a smile on your lips. You’ll ‘get over it’ but it costs you that part of your soul you never wanted to lose in the first place.
---
And it doesn’t garner any respect either. When OP announced himself he and the other guy didn’t become friends, so there wasn’t even that ‘let bygones be bygones’ effect. It established the roles in their respective universe and OP was still the guy who got clobbered.
---
Weeb war II when?
---
the fit wasnt that high, more than half that cost was in his cargo hold. and most of the cost of the fit was in 1 module. Hard loss indeed though.
---
No I'm not, you are missing the point. You're trying to say people don't want to PVP, that they'd rather carebear 24/7, yet whenever a ping goes out, 100-300 nerds show up if you're in a decent sized alliance. The problem is LACK OF HUNTERS, not carebears who won't pvp. That is where the lack of content is coming from. And there's a lack of hunters because hunting is usually at least a 2-3 hour frustrating ordeal, and sometimes 2-3 days worth of intel gathering.
---
And over those many man-hours in which they’re being mined, ships are in space and can be attacked at various times for 2-4 days in different time zones.
---
My argument is that barrier to entry is not a balance factor.
---
Historical eve has proven this multiple times.
---
Your argument is that barrier to entry is a balance factor.
---
thanks I hate this
---
I do not now, nor have I ever, nor will I in the future, give a wet slap about my kill board. I am *not* interested in it.
---
I know it’s a fetish for some part of EVE demographic but I don’t care about the social merit at all.
---
The only use I get from kill mails is to see how people fit their ships. And then to understand that that was the fit that lost O_o.
---
Kill boards mean nothing to me. I love EVE to pieces, I love the lore, the luster, the beauty, the people, the umpteen ways you can make [and lose] a fortune, the ships, the systems, just about anything. I do not care about kill boards. I don’t like losing ships, it’s not as if it gives me joy because it often is a serious pain in the ass, but kill boards mean nothing to me. I haven’t lost a Planck Moment’s sleep over whether or not my kill board looks sad.
---
I’m not saying what should or should not be important to you, but I’m not there to be a stat [I am a stat for sure] in there. That’s not what EVE is to me.
---
As a contrast: I did lose that Maelstrom, easily one of the more expensive ships I’ve lost [I don’t fly capitals], at the same time was chased by two Russians or 10 jumps in my Iteron Mark V and it felt utterly glorious to be able to escape :-).

Hello o/ I'm Chingy. I am working on a self hosting option for mine, but it gets tricky when the technologies I use won't be cheap for the person that would want to host it. I have most of it open source though. As for the resources that are required for each system it really depends.
---
I know people have gotten both tripwire and pathfinder "working" in Kubernetes which makes it scale, but neither really supports a microservice architecture (as mine does). Depending on how many people are going to use your site it really depends on where you host it. It sounds like you are just trying to do it all on a cheap VM on Digital Ocean so as said above if you are doing something small just for testing the cheapest droplet should do the trick. Keep in mind that caching, and hosting location does greatly matter for latency and performance.

These posts seem to be coming more frequently, but the best advice, since plex was thing, is to not play with the goal of plexing.  It sucks.  Eve PvE is boring.  If you want to plex there are dozens of strategies that all work.  They are all boring.

PURGE THE HERETICS
---
Oh I really don't either but it's fun to look back at how much ISK has essentially been "wasted". That's all I get out of it. My last kill was like 3+ years ago.
---
That said, glad you took at least one of them down. ;D
---
Capitals are a responsibility I have *zero* interest in. The Orca and Rorqual are enough for me, and I barely touch those.
---
Ah yes a baddie has revealed itself.
---
A Max skilled T3C implant with Evasive Man. was rocking 28.1% reduction in sig.
---
Currently the max is a Command Ship with implant, rocking 16.2%.
---
Owait, wuts this...  T3C caused link powercreep you say?  Old Command ship was only 25.9%!
---
So we have:
---
0.719x (old T3)  
---
0.741x (old CS)  
---
0.832x (new CS)  
---
0.719/0.832 = 15.7% worse sig...  
---
0.741/0.832 = 12.2% worse sig...
---
You be taking like 13% more damage and thinking it be a big deal.
---
A sandqual

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
So HK/Hawks are defending a duopoly on carebear holes while an active pvp group is trying to introduce pvp into the region. Got it.
---
I don't know it's pretty damn hard to find a job that I can just pick up for an hour whenever the hell I want.  Even the online things where you grind out surveys and shit for even less cash than grinding ISK have ridiculously annoying hiring requirements to avoid being flooded by half-assed workers.
---
And if you're not at a job where you can just take paid overtime willy-nilly, asking them to completely restructure the way their company operates tends to be a bit tough, too.
---
okay and what's your point?
---
Maybe because my wife was diagnosed with cancer and money is extremely tight at the moment. I still want to play Eve as Omega, but in game grinding is the only way to keep my account up right now.
---
Just saying don't make judgements based on your life and apply that to everyone that plays the game.
---
duo pvp. Just me and a buddy looking for fights in FW. It is much easier to get fights as the enemy doesn't see a whole fleet in local. That, and the extra layer of strategy a fleet of two provides over solo pvp. eg. "I tank while you dps".
---
If that was your point, you were bad at making it. You kept talking about PVE and didn't mention hunters/hunting at all. While I was, and was getting downvoted and "lul what's your point"ed.  
---
I keep forgetting Reddit is full of morons.

the only thing that needed to change about eve for it to get better, really was tidi.  all of the other problems in eve pale in comparison to this one gigantic white whale.  at the end of a long struggle to own titans and caps all you are left with is a sick sense of regret in your stomach as you realize this game's servers arent equipped to handle the escalation owning toys like that leads to. pve is work because owning things takes work... plain and simple.  ccp of course wants to punish you for earning in game isk because obviously they'd rather you just bought isk.  
---

In terms of old EVE? IOM would win.
---
Dont play for isk, play to see explosions

so blueballed? Unless hic is also involved in case uh... redballed?
---
CONCORD can only destroy capsuleer vessels easily because of a back door into the tech. A handful of Elder Fleet dreadnaughts destroyed CONCORD's HQ in Yulai back in like 2008ish?
---
well there's your problem. EVE is a pay to play game, plex is giving you the illusion that it's free to play.
---
plex doesn't exist so every player can keep their accounts up year round for free, it exists so they can get an extra month or two for free unless they're rich in game.
---
It's in the comments of the code, the last place anyone would look.
---
haHAA im 12 and everything anybody does is cringe cause i cant bear to see anybody do anything that’s not completely normal due to unresolved self esteem issues i developed early in my childhood haHAA
---
I HIGHLY recommend you don't do this if you value your relationship Source: I moved to a different continent because my stepdad got my mom into eve.
---
Lots of ppl willing, just hard to find the right group.
---
Jump around and learn what you can
---
Equip pink and play vanu and the criteria matches from the sheer amount of lag and eye aids you cause.
---
You live in nulsec
---
Also cringe.
---
Pulse is optional, only hard requirement is finding "Apply to corp" button.
---
One of my bartenders quit and I tried her name when I created a new character.
---
Why not? What’s the problem? I’m sure there are plenty of people here who can help you if you just explain the situation. Grinding to plex your account is a surefire way to burn yourself out on the game. It’s turn a fun game into a boring job and pretty much everyone in the community recommends to not do it.
---
But if you just keep turning the other cheek you'll just end up with both sides of your face hurting and a bit of dribble from your heavily abused ass.

Yea because it took zero effort to get that infrastructure set up....
---
Fuck off faggot
---
They cant cause all of eve is blue to them
---
I'm just not enthused with the current meta. Which is content citadel fights then when that isn't happening mining in rorqs
---
This but unironically. If you can't find fun for yourself in Goons, there's no point in not leaving.
---
Every trend or hype subsides after a while. Doesnt mean its "dead", just not as popular and often-iterated-upon as it would be during its peak.
---
money controls universe, and it's quite peculiar how 'true pvprs' are often broke af with few exceptions.
---
As a community we need to know where this is and take it out together. Ill be DAMNED if i ever see a waifu ship skin. TIME TO PURGE.
---
The guy in the video is also cringing.  
---
Also, get mad.
---
What I’m I looking for? What are the two types?

I pay for subs then do PI/market seed for isk. 
---
LOVE MY WORMHOLE!!!!

Not everyone finds mining a boring activety, othera watch tv or chat on voice coms or in game.

Just because you dont like it doesnt meen its bad.

---
Your comments never once mentioned hunting.  
---
inb4 ninja edit to save face
---
Biggest miner I ever knew worked the key drop at a parking garage, graveyard shift.  Back in the day dude ran a multiboxing hulk fleet (with a rorqual lol) for about 12 hours a night 6 days a week.  You just need a really, really shitty job and you can pve all you want!
---
once again, what the fuck does hunting have to do with anything i've mentioned?
---
Good ship to pvp in
---
Wife agro cost him his ship
---
TomB, the original soon™.

Can you just go back to your nazi glorifying subreddits, they are more to your low iq posting style.
---
He slurped in some power juice, ate mushrooms growing off his gamer room wall and channeled his inner Grath to activate sphere.exe, which caused the name of his target to appear on Zkill and thus drain a innocent account of its sacret, secret name.
---
The target can only pray to the god almight of Eve, Mittani, or the old heretical faith, Bob, for redemption and release from the mortal coil of heretical picture.
---
\&gt; he doesn't understand why hunting is particularly important for content generation
---
lmfao I'm done, you're a waste of my time
---
Totally right. It was difficult though as he was running at zero or near to zero capacitor somethimes. If you get 0 cap from the cycles, you are essentially neuting yourself by using it
---
Don't be salty cuz you're poor, peasant
---
ITT: people claiming to know how eve was coded
---
Not even ccp knows how eve works
---
I never said it wasn't important for content generation, nor that i don't know it isn't you absolute retard
---
My intel channel clearly shows that of all those things you listed, not a one has stopped people from roaming around Delve this morning, getting kills.
---
All that would happen is that instead of lining the pockets of NPC corps (so ccp) players would end up lining the pockets of large alliances who can buy, control and defend high sec market hubs....not really worth it imho
---
&gt; I am not worried about a bloke that diddled kids, I want to stop it from happening in the first place. 
---
Same.
---
You mean take care of business, dock it then undock it, and back to business in eve while she is sleeping. 
---
Stratos are bad for ticks
---
this is one of the reasons why I don't go in perimeter. Don't want to fill other players pocket, rather gain less.
---
If you want to do it - do it the proper way.            
---
NPC tax is based on security status of the system - X% multiplied by security system so lets assume 2%  this puts us for 2% in 1.0, 1.8% , 0.9 .... **this is base tax that is applying to both citadels and NPC stations** that people need to pay always - but citadel owners get 1/3rd of the tax in return to their wallets.           
---
This way more people will be willing to put up and fight for market hubs. 
---
From left to right, some of the first people to hold their respective positions:
---
CCP Kieron - EVE Community Manager
---
CCP Oveur - Executive Producer
---

CCP Lemonde - Community Developer &amp; Tournament Coordinator
---
These signatures are all circa 2006 - that's a nice piece of history you have there &lt;3 
---
Dude, when you make a point, you have to make the actual point. You don't defend your 'point' by saying "I never said this true thing isn't true". You never made a point.  
---
My point was answering the question: more groups don't deploy offensively because of a shortage of hunters.
---
You decided to be a fucking sperg about that. Go get your blood pressure checked, jesus christ
---
why would that be dumb? exchange rate is so oprresing that i make far more per hour dual carrier ratting than my full time job. Is like, for real man, you sure know the struggle why lie?
---

---

---
Just because you dont bot doesnt mean you dont act like a bot :&gt;
---
it doesn't imply anything about ease - it just flat out tells you a preference.
---
In terms of available options not much changed, there are still more engaging and demanding kinds of PvE being available. It's just that lowest risk, lowest effort, lowest attention needed kind of PvE is also the kind that scales best and has overall best value return for time actively spent. And that is something that should be fixable by rebalancing PvE activities towards gain-when-fully-optimised (and shifting rewards from there, so higher risk or more attention required means significantly better potential payout).
---
&gt; you need more than 5 minute a day
---
no you don't. not for installing jobs and restarting extractors.
---
Well the test vs panfam stuff shows that leads to meat grinder battles.
---
So its a win win
---
Yeah, well, sorry not sorry about that.
---
I’m harvesting ore, you go right ahead and call Concord on me.
---
&gt;My point was answering the question: more groups don't deploy offensively because of a shortage of hunters.
---
okay, and you bring this up why?
---
Then again you could just titan bomb any 40k fleet. The bumps alone would scatter the entire enemy fleet crushing ships in the process. Obviously this is a huge advantage oh and eve is way more maneuverable. Instead of spending years in warp eve players could just plot the enemy course and ambush the enemy fleets as they exit warp space. Imagine just having a huge ass capital fleet and a timetable and all you do is jump from system to sysem smashing imperial fleets. Dont get me wrong i love 40k but the whole place is backwards. This and we are not even talking about eves top tech either. Id like to see the emperors finest try duke it out with concord.... 
---
Same. Extra to npc's is better than paying to other people. Probably the same one who will shoot you at the end of the day.
---
"You're bubbling her wormhole, aren't you?"
---
Nerf capitals pls.
---
That's not just EvE bro.
---
Or or, imagine this:
---
You're in a fight. You're either FC or linemember who does individual shit like pings or EWAR in small scale.
---
A fight breaks out. Turns out its enemy coalition 1 (red ones) and enemy coalition 2 (red ones), and a enemy WH gang (deep red ones) some neutrals who happen to be there (grey ones). Okay. You also have a semi-friendly gang there as well, who are really bluetrals for content and shoots on sight after fight ends, marked light blue. And your alliance mates, marked deep blue.
---
If you want to know where this happens regularely just hang around provi for while, either as neutral 'renter' or as a content creator.
---
Now, assume you want to distinguish between the groups of enemies easily to judge their remaining power: you can either a) not do that or b) try to trace number of ships on blob c) count lasers and bullets going between targets.
---
It's pretty hard when you really only have 1-2 colors and multiple factions possily duking out, not to mention if you want to track individual people like FC's, scouts, eyes and other people of interest on local and on immediate area.
---
and get shot at by everything, not a healthy plan for organized groups.
---
If you're playing the game so you can play the game, you're doing it wrong.
---
With a normal wage it costs a few hours a month to earn enough to sub your account. Trying to earn enough ISK every month to fund a PLEX will take many times more.
---
So in the end it's all about how much your own time is worth to you. My advice would be to dish out the 15 bucks a month so you can actually enjoy this game.
---
you need to move the extractors from time to time. For me it was like once every 1week.
---
Then restarting extractors take more time if you have more extractors.
---
&gt;okay, and you bring this up why? why are you so concerned by my lack of mention of this as if there is a caveat i'm missing?
---
Probably because you're acting like a sperg, contributing nothing, and derailing my discussion of the meta behind hunting, which is THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR for content generation.
---
Lol your bubbling her work whole army you.
---
wow a goodwill? thats a fantastic find (im curious what story's that picture has to tell) 
---
it is a 'new feature' for the next five years
---
Why not just anchor your own citadel with a clone bay? 
---
Also, would setting your Corp HQ at a station give you no jump timer?
---
.02
---
i want it aswell, even just a high res scan would be lovely
---
yeah, and that takes mere seconds. I install all my jobs/reset my extractors once a week.
---
once a month It'll take me a bit longer as I do a round trip between the pocos.
---
honestly, listing the shit on the market takes longer than anything else.
---
That argument works if there was in game TV serials and ingame coms.
---
If I go play another game alongside it it doesn't mean Eve mining isn't shit.
---
Yes, it does. Of course, it requires that you have a functional brain and are not making useless statement about things that are not on a comparable scale of cost. And that's what we assume on internet because we don't know the poster.
---
It takes a long long time to get your isk back doing that but it is doable. 
---
10b is a pretty great investment about to get a great industry setup going. Especially with that many alts. Slightly more work than completely passive but will bring in a lot more too. 
---
If you’re in a null alliance then seeding the market or contracts with doctrine and ratting ships is easy as hell. Do it at a 10% mark up from Jita + shipping and you just constantly turn over your isk at 110% every time you sell through. 
---
No. Income should be earned whilst logged in.
---
Yeah but they are scattered across a warp storm riddled galaxy with little coordination. The nids made iy to macragge before they were stopped at most a few hundred ships would ever be within range eachother to render promp assistance. All an eve player has to do is light a cyno on an alt and jump ontop of anyone they dont like using their 40 titan alts.and anyone input broadcasting bombing runs. They have fucking swords that are chainsaws for christ sake. EVE has undying demigods who can split a a space marine in half. What else al i missing. Oh right the entire empire depends on the astromincon to navigate, know eve players they would all just team up diplomatically with other races and wipe it out. 
---
What makes mining interesting for me is the conversation, mainly. Dwall and Yeti and all the rest are usually on moon mining fleets and chatting to people in fleet is a lot more interesting than solo VNI ratting.
---
&gt; Yes, it does.
---
"that's nice" means, it's nice.
---
it doesn't mean it's hard
---
it doesn't mean it's easy
---
it doesn't mean anything other than literally than something is nice.
---
Bots are life. Use them, love them. My 36 rorq bots bring in hella isk.
---
&gt;Not everyone finds mining a boring activety
---
&gt;others watch tv 
---
:thinking:
---
i want this for no particular reason whatsoever
---
Big isk takes more than running just a single super or rorq. 
---
It comes form multi boxing rorqs, running high end farm wormholes in a dread, setting up big reaction chains, setting up big industry chains, setting up burner or level 5 mission blitzing...
---
yum
---
My main isk makers before I got into manufacturing was runnning escalations.
---
I found them to be a bit more exciting due to the loot drops, but running them efficiently kind of requires a big alliance.
---
Tbh Eve fireranges are based absolutely on tanks and guns/arty lol.
---
1km - 200km is average for most stuff.
---
200km in *space*. LUL
---
I think that’s a bit of a misinterpretation. The taxes for NPC stations were raised simply to create a more noticeable benefit to using players structures, not to eradicate them completely. There’s a lot more to making a market than just taxes. If anything, Jita would likely be one of the last NPC hubs to die.
---
130 euro in 1 hour?
---
thank you
---
Same issue
---
it takes much more than resetting your extractors. You have to delete the old one, check the resources, find a correct hotspot, create the ECU, link it to the storage, submit, open the ecu, use the correct amount of time, the resource, place the heads, submit, submit, right click the ECU and create route, select the storage, submit.
---
same for extractors, you need to move the heads when the output is not enough. You really underestimate how long of your life PI requires.
---
Play the game
---
&gt;and derailing my discussion of the meta behind hunting, which is THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR for content generation.
---
i'm sorry, you came to me and replied to me you retard, so go make your own post if you want to make random observations that have nothing to do with the person you're replying to
---
sometimes i wish i had a magic computer that could access every website ever created no matter of its current state JUST to browse /back up this kinda stuff... the "old" internet is full of amazing sites , blogs and forums wich slowly died and got deleted as the owners moved on or passed away 
---
Implying there's important shit
---
You are either a shark or bait!
---
It takes months even years for them to travel an invasione would be detected and promptly ambushed by every player in the game. Either that or they would subvert factions of the imperium with the promise of immortality and watch as half the empire become heratics. Nah the sheer numbers thing is bullshit they cannot win a war from a distance even if they can hold jita44 to ransom. Eve players can just duck over and wipe out the astronomicon. Then clean up the entire Imperium backbone hice world by hive worled doomsday off the map. I did the calculation a while back and it would take 250 titans something like 4dd cycles to wipe a planet barron. The entire imperium would fall weeks and they would have no idea until they had nothing left to fight with.
---
We have cloaked cynos
---
Yeah about 250 titans and 20 minutes
---
would you:
---
Ping falcon over (another) gamebreaking bug
---
or
---
Ping falcon over a WWW thread that's completely off balance like comparing a nuclear warhead to supersoaker in amount of devastation caused?
---
Until NPC stations are destructible there is no way i'm moving all my shit into citadels and having to do the fortnightly shuffle.
---
I'd rather pay more in tax and not have to deal with the citadel churn aids.
---
are you literally re-creating your colony every week?
---
you don't need to do almost 80% of that, at all.
---
Its not like Omega magically open all of eve in an instant, apart from a cloak, most stuff Omega locks take a month or almost that to train. Dreads, capitals, Supers, T2 logi, HICs, Maradauers, Recon, JF, dictors... Unless you have a plan, just going Omega doesn't equal fun in the first month.
---
and "it would be nice if X instead of Y" means a totally different thing. It means a preference in the choice between X and Y, and for this preference to bear a meaning it implies that X and Y are both choosable.
---
You did not use "X is nice". You use "it would be nice if X instead of Y", which implies more things.
---
Time to warp to Hella Nopest III in the Fuckthatshit cluster
---
Are you really counting pressing the submit button as a step? That's less than 5 seconds of input. All up that takes ~2-5 minutes. Are you purposefully being obtuse or are you just very slow to press submit buttons? 
---
completing "The Seekers Investigation" in all its steps provides you with 50K isk on each mission, some of them reward a complete lvl up on certain skills like targetting and the like or the equivalent in SP if you have already trained them, the tutorial also makes you get some race based weapons with ammunition and an attack frigate to learn how to fit and swap ships.
---
so lets say you start with a Gallente alt, at the end it would have gotten some support skills up, a lot of money to start up on the career agents, the small hybrid turret and gallente frigate skills and a free Atron with turrets and ammunition to fly around. also you starting Velator that you can strip down to get whatever civilian module you may need.
---
I deal with this shit . Once time my wife(then GF) wrote me a note about how I play Eve too much and need to see help.  
---
We are married now, so we know who won that war.
---
10/10 posting OP.
---
nope. Every week-end the extractors that need to be moved, and the transport of P2 resources to the factory planet and the P4 from factory to buyback.  Plus every Wednesday, the reset of extractor (so 3d+4d long but kept it at 4d).
---
My money is on them, there are some serious autists in that sub xD  Although, we would be striking them while they are weak as they just lost one of their most prolific mods.

dude, neither of your possible choice is correct.

And yes, pressing the submit is a step, especially when you need to do it 3 times per planet, are you purposefully being obtuse or are you just a complete retard ?
---
What's your vector, victor?

Yeah, I replied to your shit-tier meme comment about carebears with an actual specific problem the game has, and you chimped out.

Hmmm, actually pay money for a product?  Just because you can plex doesn’t mean you should...the “game” is produced by a business entity and profit is their goal.  You might also consider taking business classes if you don’t understand this concept.  Do you think plex just magically appears on the market like all the products in stores just arrive on the shelves?  Seriously an annual sub works out to about $11/month and you’d rather spend hours of “play time” paying for those hours to grind for that play time?  “Free” really is a catchy word.
---
&gt;you chimped out.
---
spoken like a true chimp
---
This is my life. I was showing this to my partner and she was laughing so hard and was saying 'so accurate'. All the way to EVE being 'the other woman'.
---
i have no idea what you're doing - but it's way more than you need to.
---
reset extractors once a week, haul once a month. done.
---
&gt; You use "it would be nice if X instead of Y", which implies more things.
---
it implies that i want x not y, nothing more.
---
and why wouldn't i want the better of the two? there's no reason not to want the most desirable outcome.
---
What bureaucracy? You search for pandemic horde, you click apply, you get accepted within a few minutes.
---
"duke it out in one system" does not mean that one side gets to bring all their shiny stuff and the other doesn't. And I think you are really not understanding the scale of the Imperium of Man. And the absurdity of the 40k universe. "Undying demigods that can rip a space marine in half" is pretty low on the list of fucked up shit they fight on a regular basis. And I would really like to see the EVE universe wipe out the astronomicon. Because that's Big E himself, on his golden Throne. On Holy Terra. Or, exactly the only situation that could semi-realistically force the Imperium to concentrate all it's assets in one system. Plus, by keeping with your logic, the Imperium actually *gains* mobility in New Eden. The stargates are basically miniature webways. And they can still use the warp to travel. Sure, maybe capsuleers can react faster through cynos and whatnot, but how does that help you? You would have to muster a gargantuan force for every detachment the Imperium sends (their ships being stupidly strong in comparison to most shit EVE can field). Imperial ships have a much higher sub light speed than EVE ships, have much higher range, hit much harder and tank a great deal more. And that's only the mainline ships. Now look at their really shiny stuff. Like Battleships or some Ark Mechanicus ships. EVE simply can't match the Imperiums individual firepower and resilience nor the sheer quantity of it. It's the cluster with 5 thousand stars against the Imperium with a million planets.
---
My spirit is with her. Spacehaters sisterhood unite!!
---
6 bil isn't poor. It will seed quite a lot and is more than enough to give you breathing room.
---
That said, as a lesson for all Eve players, never keep that much liquid isk if you don't need immediate access to it. When I stepped away from the game for a year,I sank all my isk into plex before I left. 
---
Stupid anime fans and normal people
---
Pretty sure I've read where a DD could glass a planet
---
Yeah. No shit. But what does that have to do with anything in what either I or the OP said? No one got “walked all over” irl. 
---
Taking revenge irl over something that happened in an online game puts you in the same league as people who physically cut internet connections or initiate SWATings. Is that really where you want to be?

My wife once said " you love that damn game more than you love me".

So I said "well, when this game starts to nag at me as much as you do, I'll hate it too".

Oh, you're right! I forgot the flames too. That's what I get for using my Rorq in station view as reference.

You obviously need to smoke a joint and chill, you fucking prick.
---
Awsome
---
&gt;I recently started station trading in Jita, but it feels like my buy orders are getting turboraped and insta 0.1 isked, I'm probably doing something wrong
---
You are not doing anything wrong.  Chances are that you are just getting 0.1'ed by market bots, welcome back to eve.
---
I just got back to Eve after a 4 year break, so I can honestly say I don't fully get the new structures yet.
---
The main issue I have is that Control Tower/POS were assets that scaled so individuals up to megacorps/alliances could afford them and use the functionality.
---
These new structures are priced so high, both in BPO cost and materials that they are effectively only megacorp/alliance level assets. I have no major issue with that, but when combined with removing the old POS functionality I feel like a whole raft of options have been removed from me as a solo and casual player.
---
For more detail:
---
At my peak playing Eve solo 5 to 7 years ago I ran a small moon mining and reacting operation, along with a research labs and doing T3 inventing/production. While I only had 1 R64 thulium moon which output was only stockpiled for a future rainy day - the operation mining about 10 minor moons and reacting basically made enough ISK to cover the fuel plus maybe a return of 200m per month on the 5 Bil or so left dangling in space. I used lots of the reaction products in my T2 invent and build operation - I did this mostly to produce lots of my own T2 gear for my PVP and a bit to sell. I created content by FCing a bit in militia, solo PVPing, and helping out small level capfights for friendly CEOs etc - generally adding fun content and activity to the game.
---
The ballache of fuelling so many towers and constantly looking after these whiny nuisance structures (especially the reacting towers!!) took so much time I wanted to spend PVPing in the end that I eventually took all the setups but lab down.
---
POS certainly kept me entertained at the time with the levels of complexity and activity required. they were certainly overpowered in terms of HP and annoyance to remove/destroy - and income was out of hand at alliance level due to the effective zero risk - but that was also due to moon mining being the single source for moon material.
---
The sad thing now is not the loss of ISK making from passive moon mining - it is that the option for every player to do all this and have access to this content is massively hindered now mainly for price, but also by utility - Moon mining for example now requiring armies of people to "Mine" (which is still the most boring activity in game). Why didn't CCP try adding moon materials to asteroid belts in small quantities first? This could have stopped the monopolies and ridiculous passive incomes of the past without removing the utility/content from players.
---
The functionality POS offered scaled well from individual to corp to alliance asset. The new structure and mechanics do not.
---
I understand the social part of the game and that corps are important, but  putting all this content now effectively behind a 'corp only wall' for me only exposes the lack of options now returning to play the game. Either I have to join a big corp and get fleeced by some big ego to access this content. (Note: I say this having also been that big ego in the past with my own corp in an alliance working together to build corp assets and all that associated drama - before I even went solo long ago)
---
Silly long post - you got me triggered. But look at all that content I once created and words words words...
---
Never thought I'd hear the words "Kubernetes" and Eve together in the same sentence, but keep fighting the good microservice fight!
---
more like the current state of eve tbh
---
1. " since I PLEX my accounts "
---
2. complain about ISK Farming.  
---
Choose one? 
---
A specific fit would be great. I am omega and would like to be pvpve oriented. Brawler seems interesting but I'm up for just about anything.
---
Promising immortality is Chaos's schtick. And please tell me how exactly EVE's forces plan to move between systems that don't have stargates? How do you light a cyno in a system you can not reach? And even if capitals got to jump around as much as they want, how much would that cost in fuel?  How do you keep supply lines running when your forces are jumping around in a space that's roughly 180 times larger than your own home? And if you need 4dd volleys to wipe a planet clean, and assuming it takes 40 minutes to get these out, you are looking at roughly 76 years of volleying planets clean until you have killed of the Imperium. And please, let the players "ambush" imperial vessels. They will get pulverized. Remember the 10s of thousands kilometers of range?
---
Can confirm it’s a ton of fun. And lucrative, made just over half a bil on my last dive into null on my explorer in an astero.  And I’ve only been doing it about a week and don’t have great scanning skills yet.  Drones for damage personally. 
---
Grinding for high level MMO income is never fun. It sucked in WoW, it sucks in GW2, it sucks in EvE becuase it's always some maximum-efficiency boring ass routine in one place doing the same thing over and over. Just pay for your account with real money or accept that MMO grinding is the lowpoint of the genre.
---
I started eve just paying the sub with real life money. I couldn’t stand doing pve activities, so I just found ways to make isk off of pvp, consensual or otherwise. There are lots of ways to make isk to keep yourself in ships I have found.  Fly cheap and effective. It can be a ton of fun. 
---
What about a normal job, assuming you can get paid in currency that isn’t horrible to convert to dollars or euros?
---
Why must eve be paid by your overtime specifically?
---
yes it implies more.
---
The game needs more isk sinks, not less. Without NPC taxes, Eve's hyper-inflation problem would only be exacerbated. 
---
Look up spectre fleet, see if they have one. They’re a pretty good NPSI group
---
No an yes amarr had 3 before kador split, gallente had 8 before losing one to the serpents I believe caldari has 3 an minmstar one uncompleted one
---
no it doesn't.
---
if i wanted to call ccp lazy shitty developers who can't fix bugs for shit - i'd have just done so
---
you guys manufacturing outrage when i expressed that the session timer is irritating and i'd rather the transitions were seamless is fucking hilarious.

Did you forget about that whole "displacing attacks into literal hell" thing?
---
Ah, yeah I don’t really watch anime 
---
Imagine thinking that a one word comment could possibly contain enough information to convey sarcasm without being an extremely well-known ironic phrase.
---
"more than I need to". Well I don't need to play Eve so that's for sure -.- 
---
also building P4 need to move the stuff more often (not enough room)
---
A one way ticket to hell, yeet
---
Correct.
---
If you aren't in a situation where you can add an hour of work then try looking at your budget to figure out where playing Eve ranks.   Roughly $30 a month can fund ~100mil T3D roaming for the month, then add on the sub cost.  Depending on where you live that is only one night out to eat, seeing a movie, or one day less a week at Starbucks. I lose ships all the time but spend zero hours doing PVE for isk.  
---
No reason to lose time and money to a game activity you don't enjoy.
---
Someone using drifter WH?
---
&gt; "I mean yeah, we were all wiped out and then shot for heresy, but at least my kill boards now look green as **FUCK**"

Sounds absolutely plausible.

wait u dont have to imagine lmao

 Cheerszah
---
well the I-Archive is nice, but its flakey, what i wanted is use a 2003 search engine to find &lt;2003 websites, on internet archive you dont get that, you need to know the site before you use it, so its kinda meh for just browsing, not to mention that plenty of sites are missing and most of the assets are gone aswell (no embed pics, etc) 
---
Most Eve players have always wanted to be spoonfed pvp content and FCing can be stressful and time consuming even if it’s incredibly fun, so they’ve been hard to come by for the entire existance of this game.
---
Offering people money to create content for the masses isn’t the worst idea tbh.
---
It sure as shit beats all your members relying on one poor bastard to FC every day.

How To Gain Downvotes 101
---
I'm assuming a case where the question of "mine in Eve, or give it up completely" would come up.  The most obvious to me is a strict budget.  An Eve subscription may not cost very much, but it may be competing with limited luxury time and limited budget for other hobbies.  If it comes down to "give up other hobbies" vs "give up Eve" vs "keep playing Eve but it's boring as fuck now", then it's pretty easy to drop Eve and focus on other hobbies and non-subscription games.  
---
The only other alternative I see would be picking up random jobs for a couple hours every few months, but those kinds of opportunities don't seem to be nearly as easy and reliable as people on the internet make them out to be.
---
I never understood this obsession with being able to pay for a sub with isk. Why? Don't you have a job? I'm sure you do. So, why turn Eve into a job? Because thats what you are doing if you expect to pay for your subs with plex. For 13 years I have had 4 accounts. I usually pay them out of tax returns or portion of my student loan money while I was in school. In turn, my play time is just that; play time. If you are suffering its because you have chosen too. Therefore, suck it up buttercup.
---
This isn't irony.
---
The Imperium is so damn slow though how long do you think its gonna take eve capsuleers to metagame the fuck out of that shit. I build paint and play 40k but damn that shit is backwards. Maybe thats what happened on the other side of the eve gate! What if they are the same thing... im really high
---
You should hire someone to hunt him down and keep killing him in game so he quits. I will offer my services for a paltry 2b isk, barely 15 usd.
---
Very sorry for you, that is a shitty situation, and one I hope I will never have to experience. Nonetheless, his analysis is correct, the amount of time it takes to grind for a free sub is significantly larger than the time it takes to make the real money to pay for that same sub. It's not a judgement on anyone's character, it is just the math based on exchange rate between minimum wage and plex, which is still much higher than pretty much any eve isk making activity.
---
Plenty off them
---
I am rather well to do because I don't throw away my wealth on such garish trinkets.

There’s spectre fleet, there’s bomber’s bar and Bjorn Bee the streamer does public fleets as well (ingame channel The Beehive). 
---
But do join a corp though... at the very most it’ll be a 5 minute chat about what you like doing in Eve and sending ESI info, a low price to pay to play the actual game instead of sitting by yourself in highsec watching all the people with allies and a purpose go by.
---
did the same a few years ago, made enought iskeritis for plexing my 5accs the next 5y, but lost the whole motivation for the game... so its just skillqueue online for me now.
---
Could be someone else now, charrecters are sometimes sold on the charrecter bazaar especialy rorq miners.

Yep. Become a credit card warrior and your space-life becomes instantly easier.

I run pathfinder in a medium ec2 instance in AWS.  It supports all 40~ people who use it. If it’s just going to be you, you can easily use a micro sizing, which is free for a year. I knew almost nothing going into it, and although the documentation was...very lacking, it should be doable.

I wouldn’t trust any “security” concern bs unless someone comes out with facts as to why such a concern exists.(other than ignorance)

Dude... what?

Moral of the story: sell feroxes and railguns
---
Offering incentives to FC shit, especially for first-time/newer FCs has been a thing since I joined my first non-highsec corp in 2012. Not really anything to meme about.
---
I fully understand the math and his math is correct. I just wanted to point out that not everyone can afford to sub every month and it has nothing to do with where you live. Up until recently I did sub on my credit card. Just sometimes situations change.
---
I think we're hitting a language wall somewhere, possibly mine, since I'm fluent, but not native english speaker. I can't think of a SP loss as a "barrier", unless people get cap/super skills at lvl1 and then fly them out. Personally, I'd take it at least to 3 and I know groups that demand 4 or 5. Nevertheless, I'm thinking of the SP loss as a tool to discourage casually throwing around caps/supers, since at these levels the pilots get minimal returns from skill injectors. With super prices dipping super low (pun intended), the loss of one hits someone's wallet a lot less that it used to. Especially in friendly space, where you can recover the dropped items from the wreck. Yes, a 60-100 bill super is a loss you can't ignore, but minerals are getting cheaper by the second because of Rorqs deflating mineral prices, while injectors get more expensive because of market inflation.
---
Still, if you don't mind, I'd like you to explain to me what you mean by barrier to entry. I may be missing something important there.
---
Yea but then there's dozens of wiki pages to read, logistics, setting up coms, etc.  Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
What is their channel?
---
Possibly but it was his main. Never can tell these days though
---
Yeah I found this out the hard way with all of my abyssal mods

If memory serves, when MBLOC was getting started in CalMil we used to pay anyone who would FC a guaranteed fleet a week one plex per month.  It was a great way to build up a strong roster of solid, dedicated FCs.  The issue here isn't paying FCs, it's that nobody will take the payment ...
---
bad bot
---
So eve style strike while they are weak and ravage rorq chams
---
And they wear flip flops and live in caves, right? Dude, I know my country very well. I'm pointing the fact that many from first world countries don't know jack shit about what being poor really is and frown upon/meme about that all day. It gets tiresome, that's it.

Is there still a pretty actice player base for EVE? I I've though about trying it out again throughout the years, but just never got around to it. Perhaps I'll give it a go:) 
---
That's the problem, you set rules, you're civilized. Just kill everyone thats not blue, otherwise (this situation has happened to me before while leading a fleet) tell people to not shoot xyz group make sure they can see corp/alliance ticker in their overview, and voila.
---
PH is probably the least bureaucratic corporation in the game as far as joining... I mean, there's not even a ESI check, and everything you need to know is in the Corp bulletin when you join. Back when I joined them it was literally a discord server, get your forum username and stuff set up, and mumble. That's it.
---
How are you supposed to know if someone enters system without also knowing who they are if there's no local
---
Wouldn't it be better if in-game methods of earning ISK were more enjoyable so that the go-to option wouldn't be to spend IRL money instead?
---
Other games don't get away with that, but it's so ingrained in EVE culture that people do it here without even thinking about it.
---
"Pros" aren't really available to everyone .
---
And b) They are expensive AF.
---
c) Not everyone is a guy wanting to kill/die. There's casual/"normal" (under happy times) stuff that you might need to get out of yor chest.
---
D) Talking to ransoms is much much easier.
---
You have doctrines, comms, rules, etc to deal with in public fleets as well. And you don't have to do any "logistics" in horde, the market is well stocked. I don't know if they even *have* a wiki.
---
No. The problem with active moon mining is not that people have to be active, it's the safety umbrella of the athanor deterring content. Athanors shouldn't be able to fit (or run?) offensive modules during the mining phase - you can lore it as the mining laser and dragnet taking too much energy or something.

---
Besides paying real money (which has the best time-to-isk ratio, as long as you can afford it), some of the highest return activities in EVE include WH ratting. I don't understand how you are in a WH corp and no one told you how to do that.
---
Also, any activity that gives items instead of a straight isk reward is potentially better, as inflation in Eve is stupid right now. My carrier ratting alt gets as much per hour as my main when he goes relic-exploring. And I'm expecting it to get worse. In null, the top isk-per-hour is probably running 10/10 escalations or running T5 abyssals.
---
Any activity that can be botted (afk ratting, mining, trading) will either bore you to death, or get you podded, or drive you to botting and possibly banned. Welcome to Eve, anything you do you're going to lose, till you quit!
---
Yeah, I go with my girlfriend from time to time, and kinda just wander around aimlessly while she does her thing. Got lucky that time I guess! Lol
---
Yea, that'd be great. Most games don't require such a time investment in PvE to support PvP though.  The majority of the player base cannot fund PvP strictly through PvP alone and are forced to PvE.  For comparison, in older versions of WoW you'd PvE to a point but were then solid for PvP for a while.  Eve requires the continued investment which is why the PvP matters/is exciting.
---
Because someone is attacking them, yes.
---
Man, I've had to deal with that from 2008-2015.   
---
It took that long to find a lover who supported my hobbies instead of trying to split me from them.

EvE is not a second relationship. It's a hobby.

Relationships need more hobbies.

Long live hobbies!  
---
Abolish the bored anchor! 
---
You're right, nobody ironically memeposts 'cringe'
---
I don't understand why people are okay with the fact that grinding sucks, to the point where their goto way of making ISK is to simply buy it from others via purchasing PLEX with IRL and selling that on the market.
---
I mean.. here's a novel thought: couldn't we just make farming ISK more enjoyable?
---
Shit, other games come nearly DOA if there's even a rumor of loot boxes, yet spending IRL money for ISK in EVE is clearly the most casual thing you can do. It's pretty bonkers.
---
so out of all the boring stuff you pick incursions to actually do
---
Literally read the current sticky
---
Why are you taking yourself or this comment so seriously
---
Chill out lmao
---
Interesting, are they a good group to hang with? 
---
Nothing indicated that was ironic.
---
Stop plexing then, stupid, seems pretty easy to fix.
---
Take your time with the game. It’s not really one that you binge. Training for the ship and roles that you like will take a very long time, so taking breaks between play sessions really helps you feel like you’re progressing.
---
Why would anyone want to fc for calmil? The options depending on time zone are either get supers dropped on you  by snuff or get outformed 3:1 by galmil.
---
I'm confused. So what you are saying is that it's not PVP if you aren't the aggressor?
---
I would think that if both parties are manned by players and not NPC's then it's "player vs player" by literal definition. But my logic is obviously flawed.
---
I have to say IoM, mainly because it is written at power levels way above 9000. I doesn't make any sense, any of it, but the power level is absurd. 
---
Amarr: Of the true faith and has one true empress. No chance of coming to terms. The IoM would condemn them as heretics and apostates. Amarr prime would get exterminatus at first opportunity.
---
Minmatar: Tribal and their history as slave would make it too hard for them to bend the knee. Would either fight and die or run away. Besides, they are tribal and would be taken for abhumans.
---
Gallente: Pleasure seeking hippies. Joining the IoM would be a hard sell. IoM would either consider them Slaanesh cultist fit for exterminatus or cattle in need of reindoctrination.
---
Caldari: Could make it through OK if they surrender on the spot. The step from corporate dictatorship to Imperial rule is not that big. The IoM doesn't give a shit how worlds or sectors are governed as long as fealty is assured and tithes are payed on time.
---
You can try Nord but I would suggest Slickvpn. It works great for me. Amazing speeds and secured connections. Definitely worth a try. :)

Where’s this citadel? Asking for a friend.

Very much so!

It is not huge/mainstream like WoW, because the scifi genre and the harsh nature of the game, but it's a very strong community as a whole.
---
This accurately depicts my life with my girlfriend.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I mean, I'm biased because I'm a member of Karmafleet, which is Goonswarm's new player group, but i was in PH for a while and don't really have anything bad to say about them. If you're looking for small gang/solo pvp and expierence in bigger fleets, PH is great.
---
Well that's awesome! I played Wow for a few years with some old friends, but stopped pretty much as soon as they did. And not being mainstream has always been fine by me, so long as I'm not one of the 7 active players in the game😅

right now i can´t play eve cause no internet time and  dude i really miss it been like 3 days already and  feels to me like it is been years i miss my friends on eve , miss my corp mates on eve, fleet chats hearing a crazy dude talking how many  and much he do sex , that  strong woman  leading the krabiing fleet and not afraid to drop her rorq  if it need to help another
---
and YES i have to do fucking PVE to fund my account cause  IS MY ONLY WAY TO and here you are complaint about it  lol  before you small world of YOURSELFT  close more go get out there make friends that is what is EVE about and stop fucking complainint about PVE don´t like it dont do it and move on

Cacique Yuhasz
---
ok I got a GM to give me the answer. I had to delete the cookies and cookies journal for eve. I worked great. The old cookies were causing problems.
---
Yet that's exactly how your post is perceived.
---
I am not outraged. I just think you have no idea what you are talking about and don't realize the issues at hand.
---
And you expressed the same thing again. No you would not "rather the transitions were seamless" because you are not wiling to pay the cost for it.
---
We encourage it friend
---
125€ so yeh, 5 too short but close enough. 
---
But even if you work in craftmanship or so and get like 18€ or so an hour it´s not worth it to farm for ISK. 
---
We got cat ears.  The triglavian suit given to Eve Vegas players had a cat face painted on the faceplate, with ears. Cat ears in Eve confirmed. 
---
Horde and GOTG did not go to war because of co2 lol.
---
But the latter don't play Eve
---
If calmil had taken Tama as is their undeniable destiny, then there would be no logistics trouble. But you always chose to fuck around in the arse end of the warzone making everything needlessly complicated. 
---
Btw who are calmil now? Everyone left..
---
If you at all like sci fi (which I'm assuming you do...) you ought to read Dune. The first one is just an incredible story and not too long of a read. The rest of the series is a philosophical masterpiece IMO
---
It's great if your sad yes. 
---
It's less great if your are acculately depressed, the issue is that a lot of the people you speak with are also depressed. this re-enforces your own thinking pattern and normalizes depression in your own mind. 
---
The enivorment it creates is one where people with a brain chemistry issue will read sad stories of other folks and it only re-enforces the negative thinking the already have such a enivorment is not just unhelpful it's actively harmful. 
---
Like if your pet turtle died yes B4R would be the place for you, the issue is they often appeal more to the people that well need real help rather then just somebody to listen to because there sad. 
---
You're in a wh PvP Corp? Go evict some people and extract their assets. Why do the work when someone else will do most of it?
---
Your testimonial serves as a fine rebuttal to those who would claim EVE is pay to win. Even when you own all the things™—without the knowledge, experience, and pride of ownership that normally come from earning them yourself—they serve only to weigh you down and confer no lasting satisfaction.
---
You know... You may be onto something here. In fact, player owned structure markets in systems above 0.5 should get taxes too. At 0.5 very little, at 0.6 a bit more, at 0.7 a bit more, 0.8 medium, 09 and 1.0 should be high.
---
There is too much ISK in the game and another sink like this would be very good for it.
---
The coop frigate abyssals are actually alright for this. Especially if you're doing them with newer players, it can be pretty funny, but ofc your isk/will suffer since the newbie won't be able to necessarily do the harder abyssals off the start.
---
Yeah my pve days in Eve are over lol

Second thought. SP farming. It will either make you isk or subsidize your account. Has a lot of room for growth. I don't like trading b's &amp; b's every month but I like work less

Irl there are plenty of gig jobs out there like door dash, Amazon flex, etc., depending on your location that you can take advantage. Picking up a couple hour block can generally pay for your gas and a month or two. 
---
In game look towards more nefarious methods. Maybe scamming is your ticket. Either that or get some buddies together and do ganking. People haul a lot of expensive shit through highschool, code and pirat don't even come close to catching it, plenty of room for somebody with the urge to make dough.

imagine joining goons with anything other than a rorq alt and putting any more effort than 3 paps per month in a vigil in YOOL 2019

Wormhole ratting is among the most interesting form because it's always dangerous even tho you can put an insane amount of failsafes (rolling all the wormholes, doing it during early EU TZ) in place which can make it mostly safer than any other kind of ratting. But the possibility of losing your ship is always there if you don't take care of yourself or have friends ready. You're far more self-sustained.
---
its actually time to lower the taxes again. The taxes were raised to give incentive to players to use citadels. With citadel proliferation out of control its time to lower station taxes.
---
There’s quite a few null blocks that have done this in the past tbh... and with a lot more than 100m

Please insert more gobloons for upvotes.

Wow a lot of effort gone in here, thanks. 
---
Unfortunately not. But there are significantally worse people around nowdays, seaka.
---
Use real money instead of isk for your sub
---
Show me a game were it is fun to farm coins.  I don't think you can.  It's the nature of the mmorpg and pvp central games.  If anything, Eve is one of the only games out there where it is fun because you can loot other players.

Let's stop with the pedantry. HK is defending bear holes. There'd be no PVP there if these guys hadn't brought it. These guys want to use the hole to PVP, HK wants to use it to bear. You know what's up so quit it with this stupid shit.

How about the word cringe being used in the year 2019

Hah, I used to do that, but then I was the boss 😎
---
&gt; How about the word cringe being used in the year 2019
---
Are you kidding me? Do you know how many people use it unironically? Plenty of demand for “cringe compilation” videos, /r/cringepics , etc. I’d wager more people use it unironically than ironically
---
&gt; How about the context of the video
---
What about it? A girl poking fun at her SO for playing lots of eve? Not understanding your point
---
Hi everybody, Peter Griffin here from the popular TV show "Family Guy" to explain the joke
---
You know this based on what? Have you looked at frigate sites?
---
Like what game where you playing back then ? 
---
Because that's no where close to a accurate number, like sure most moon fights where not big massive brawls ironicly a lot of small groups would own small pockets of moons in NPC null or Lowsec. 
---
Compared to now where these groups are either dead or moved to sov, mostly because moons have become absolutely worthless ( because as a small 50 man pvp entity you're not gonna mine them and nobody wants to rent them, because there are literally more moons then rorqual miners in the game ). 
---
Picking fights I can’t win and seeing if I can win I usually don’t 
---
Well my first recommendation would be the merlin: 3xneutron blasters, 1mn ab, 2 webs, shield extender and 2 mag stabs stabs in lows. Shield extender rigs. 
---
Kestrel: 4 x rocket launcher, 1mn ab, 2 x web t2, warp scram. For lows go 1 x 400mm plate, 2 BCUs and then 3 x trimark rigs. This is great because you can select you dps type. 
---
Atron: 3 x ion, 1 nos. Ab, scram, web. Ancil rep, mag stab and damage control. 3 x transverse or rep rigs up to you. 
---
Just some rough ideas, if you want specific fits I use then I’ll mail you - is that your eve name? 
---
Yeah normal people and animated perverts.
---
What a healthy relationship, he communicated he wanted her to stop and while she was having fun she respected what he asked so she actually stopped.

How dare you ruin our lonely narrative that all eve players are abusive to their partners because we're all addicted. Every. Single. One of us. 
---
The only thing surprising about this conversation is that it's not in Russian. 
---
Thanks Gorgo for making this vid possible
---
Mate, CCP literally made a trailer advertising this exact scenario, and nothing else. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uGplrpWvz0I&amp;list=PLF614A7A6461E61E1&amp;index=31&amp;t=0s
---
HK and Hawks, being the biggest wormhole groups, have a lot of members who have taken control of C6 systems individually. NOVAC, TDSIN and SOUND have a share as well, and the majority of the rest are controlled by a bunch of Russian groups.
---
Our 'monopoly' involves us getting in first and nobody really putting the effort in to try evict them properly, except for Dura, who have put a lot of effort into this one hole.
---
You wanna guess why they're so invested in a 6-6 RG rather than any other 6-6? Dura are krabs. They might roll their static to gank ratting dreads but that doesn't exempt them from needing isk themselves.
---
But of course, let's spin this another way: Members of the coalition that control near half of nullsec are disgusted that the two biggest wormhole groups maintain control over \~50 C6 systems - obviously VERY unhealthy for the game (but no we're not killing nullsec LOL)
---
Also, when facing such issues, take a lot of screenshots. If you had multiple screenshots of the AB blinking red and cycling, possibly with the timestamp visible, they'd refund. It's not mandatory, but when you can prove that a bug killed you, and if you're polite, respectful and within the limits of the client-and-service-provider relationship, you usually get your ship back. Still, that is NOT a rule for them.
---
All the straight men do, probably some of the homosexuals too.
---
Dura want the hole for the same reason everyone else does, otherwise they'd be perfectly content with a 5-6 or a different 6-6.
---
Thanks a lot :)

We pay our FCs in karmafleet. It's a great incentive to get some newer players without mountains of isk to lead fleets. In order to get paid, you have to write up an aar, mistakes you may have made, and how to be better next time. It's a pretty good system imo and adds to the betterment(is that a word?)of the game
---
Sup?

If you really must PLEX your account (which is very inefficient compared RL work to pay for your PLEX) here's the way to do it: Have one passive income activity (Jita station trading is the most effective activity for this once you get the hang of it) and combine it with an active income generation activity (exploration is highly recommended for this). Use different alts of course.

If you work for minimum wage you get 600mil dank ticks!

Sadly we don't have stats on how many moons get mined directly, but just looking over the MER and the mining value of NPC null we can safely say nearly 0 of the moons in NPC null are getting mined.
---
I know of two regions in which 100% of valuable moons in NPC null get mined. 
---
That's a little red LED that shows activity :) 
---
&gt;Maybe I will submit a request for a confirmation dialog when repacking a non-empty container. What do you all think?
---
Don't waste a  GMs time with a petition for this, go to the little things thread and post it there where it has an actual chance of being seen by someone who can help pass this along to the right people.
---
WH ratting is very profitable, as far as fits etc. go, jsut ask in your corp / alliance that you joined. They will know the specific rats and sites, WH effects, etc. and help you out much better then getting a generalized fit over here.
---
Alternatively, L5 Abyss is still fairly good, especially if you get good enough at it to run Gamma and Exotic filaments and sell those instead. Run Dark and Fire for ISK. Electrical for ease and learning curve, but electricals give a lot less ISK due to the average types of mutas they drop so their income isn't that great. Also L5 Abyss is quite more engaging then your average super ratting in NS. It isn't something you'll AFK through, especially on the ISK making filaments.
---
Alternative is to sub, wait for a sale or promotion, stack in on top of the 3 or 6 month sub deal and you'll basically be subbing for almost half the price. Do this just on your main account, the one you use the most and all of a sudden the rest becomes so much easier to plex its incredible. Add to that trainign certificates for your otehr character slots and you can use extractors / injectors to pump more SP into characters you actually play or sell it when their prices swing up, often making a plexed account entirely free. But beware, you have to sell the injectors on an upswing and buy training certificates on a downswing, the swings can sometimes take months, sometimes just a few days and everything in between, otherwise you're still gonna have to rat or do whatever else a lot. So you have to plan for it.
---
I made this video about ISK farming fatigue a few months back. Hopefully it helps you in some shape or way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2nEMIWrUFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2nEMIWrUFY)
---
[Still have 8 of these myself](https://i.imgur.com/zj4UiUJ.png) but they've seen a lot of use storing presentations for fanfests and whatnot over the years, so they're wearing quite heavily haha
---
EVE is also the only game that gets a pass when it comes to IRL money being relevant in-game. Because that's the case, and players can just open up their wallet when they need ISK, there's no incentive for CCP to try and making farming ISK enjoyable.
---
People love to say that there is no pay2win in EVE, but I'm not so sure. Ships are regarded as consumables, right? Well, being able to leverage your IRL money to afford more consumables than the guy you're competing with means you increase your odds of winning, right?
---
Never say never... I'm still subbed, so ... 
---
Mmmm, that isn't entirely true. It is if you intend to just buy plex on market and plex your accounts without any sub or you intend to pvp in blinged ships etc. If you jsut stick to cheap-mid priced stuff and sub at least 1 account while plexing your side ones, it becomes perfectly, and I do mean perfectly viable.
---
Use the station containers if it's long term. They have a log system that prevents repackaging them if they've been interacted with in the prior 3 weeks. 
---
It's not foolproof, but even so much as trying to repackage is enough to trigger the 3 week clause. Plus you can lock items in them which actually makes organizing stuff a bit easier visually.
---
That was more about the null region, then about an NPC null system in the middle of a region ( those have always been controlled by the surrounding sov empire ).
---
The issue is that if your not a big sov empire you might as well not bother to take moons anymore ( likely nobody is gonna join your group to mine them ). so there literally worthless for anybody that isn't well in the top 10 of alliance sizes. 
---
Let it go. Get as many weeb clones as you can in there then delete the clone bay. 
---
Good groups pay for space jobs. My null group paid me 250 plex for having the most fleet participation last month. Anytime in this game if  you are in a group that expects a lot of time and effort from you they usually have incentives if they aren't shit.
---
That's bullshit, those are minor problems.  The real problem is CCP is retarded and works at a snail's pace that would be unacceptable in ANY other MMO, while funneling all of EVE's profits into failed shit projects for nearly 5 years now.  You can only neglect your product for so long, no matter how loyal the playerbase.
---
Kinda depends on where you live. I once did an internship in eastern Europe and got a whopping 42 Cents per hour, so thats like ... 30h of work for 1 month of game time.
---
If you have the time to grind isk for your sub then you have time to go mow a few lawns or clean some windows. And if you wife really is dying of cancer stop fucking playing Eve and go spend time with her, she won't be here for long.
---
God?  I thought Santa Claus made these decisions
---
Google Adsense
---
Do they have fax tho?
---
What country if you dont mind me asking?
---
Yeah pranking someone irl for being a shithead online is on par with potentially killing someone, grow up.
---
This is the crux of the matter.  The real expense in player time to acquire assets, whether through PvE or dollars earned to buy PLEX, is a necessary component of EVE PvP.  It wouldn't be worth doing without risk.
---
Now that nullsec stations are gone you are right that we could have multiple clones per station/citadel.  It used to be more of a decision if you had only one friendly station nearby, you'd have to decide on doctrines that fit only one clone.  Now it's just a nuisance.
---
Plex is skyrocketing because there hasn't been a plex sale in over 2 months now I think. 
---
This is why I hate Plex! On one hand it cheapens loss and on the other hand it gives people the idea that they can farm for their subs, which ruins the game experience for them and causes burnout. 
---
Did this comment time travel from 2018?
---
Accept that the risk component of EVE PvP only exists because of the cost required to replace assets expended in the doing of it.  There are a thousand other games that "don't get away with" making PvP expend assets... if you want that you can go have it and respawn endlessly to your heart's content.
---
From there, you can either go mow lawns for 
---
I don't understand why anyone would FC. It's a tiring and thankless job that often puts you in the spotlight of everyone being pissed off if it doesn't go perfectly.
---
That's good to hear. 
---
&gt;Wouldn't it be better if in-game methods of earning ISK were more enjoyable so that the go-to option wouldn't be to spend IRL money instead?
---
The specific problem with Eve Online is that people grind for PLEX just to play because working an extra hour or skipping a few coffees or a couple trips to McDonald's a month IRL is too much to ask apparently. 
---
It's not about becoming a credit card warrior. There is no shame to paying a tenner for the game compared to spending hours of your life running potentially multiple accounts so that you can enjoy the same pixels. 
---
Try task rabbit or Uber driving. Work when you want. 
---
But if you’re grinding ISK, not enjoying it and not doing something else productive at the same time, is that time you could be out mowing a lawn instead, and what’s the ISK per hour doing that?
---
Apologies I meant no negative connotation there. Agree with you. 
---
Oh man I lost it at Eve is a girls name, must be a girl.... I too know this struggle 
---
Surprised you even got that much. I did the same once as well and got fuck and all for my troubles
---
Most null blocks pay FC's for taking fleets out as long as they aren't feeding everytime.
---
Have you ever actually done an eviction? 
---
Its 90% work and 10% fun, thats being generous.
---
never had one
---
Where they are currently
---
I have this problem myself, I've got unlimited overtime, so I often think "why am i spending 4 hours a month farming plex when i could just do an hours overtime, catch up on work and plex in a quarter of the time?"   
---
The answer i always came back to is, work is work, and eve? Well, even the farming can be fun if done right :) I mean has anyone ever sparked a mini-block war mining in a rorq or been chased across LS while ratting another corps DED sites? 
---
In terms of WH space, my personal favourite was farming C5 wolf Rayets in confessor fleets, we'd make 300p/h each and wouldn't even bother securing the holes because the whole fleet was PVP fit was logi anyway, so company was always welcome if you know what i mean XD   
---
Considering he had access to how I would pay FCs for the 2+ years I was running FCON's Military he should already have access to everything he could potentially need to do that. As for the logistics department its always aids to balance seeding for profit and not raping your buddies. Most people feel it isnt worth their time or effort to list things low enough that people dont cry.
---
I also have done this for years, I fly the cheapest yet most effective ship for whatever PvP I'm engaging in. If I think of using a Ishtar I'll try to see if a vexor will work instead. And I never take the "good fights". I will stack as many advantages as in my favor as I can and risk as little as possible. Using this methodology I have been able to profit from PvP. Alot of people will call me risk averse or they just won't like my style of PvP but I enjoy it. 
---
The former. You get the target's exact location at the time when the probe cycle ends. It's common practice for hunters to scan two or three times and bookmark each result. Even if the target cloaks, the bookmarks can serve as an arrow that points to straight to his location.

You're the "retard" who doesn't understand that no matter what updates come through, it'll still be more difficult for bots and that's good.
---
Paying an FC to run fleets is a good idea. 100m per fleet you are probably gonna average out 50m and hour, max, given average fleet length plus prep time and whatnot. 
---
Ah Argentina isnt 3rd world. At least, its not what people think of when people say 3rd world.
---
From my experience when people say third world they are thinking of countries like Bangladesh whose median income is like 10 times lower than Argentinas iirc. 
---
Yeh, argentinas Median income is around $6000 and Bangladesh is $600. 
---
No you were just following along with the same narrative your leadership told you to - better backtrack and bring up the insecurities you wish I had once logic comes into the equation.
---
It's a game. Why should the best way to make money *in a game* not come from actually *playing the game*?
---
I don't understand how that's an unreasonable expectation. Why should working an extra hour be the best way to make ISK?
---
This is some major schistposting
---
The rest of the series is a disjointed boring mess.
---
At a certain point, plex price increasing can just make you enough money to play. I pay for my sub with irl cash, and pay for my welps with the isk I earn from plex price increasing (and I have a relatively small amount of plex, only about 500b invested) 
---
I don't think you understand what TiDi is.
---
Get a job bro.
---
It would also be more difficult for regular players. You know why most of the playerbase don't live in wormholes? Cus they don't like wormhole mechanics. You do, good for you, not everyone is you.
---
It's quite a lot if you've just come back after a long period away, we aren't all Goons with 25 Rorqual alts
---
Of course we're not as bad as some other countries but wish my median income was 6000. Poverty percentage in argentina is around 30% and to reach that barrier your income must be lower than 653 USD (as of today, 25 thousand pesos divided 39)... not that far from Bangladesh, lol.
---
What i've heard is that drifters that are part of the Vigilant Tyrannos corporation will attack you on sight for having a low reputation from wormhole krabbing and abyssal filament running.
---
the state of current calmil is bad, but the reason is hardly related to "needing to pay for fcs to undock" or some other silly strawman, hell the state of all militias is bad, gallente either went to null or joined a blob and *then* went to null, minnie/amarr is just lmao, FW as a whole is fucked and calmil is just dealing with the consequences of not really leaving ls or black rise.
---
I logged onto my Jita alt and checked prices history for Feroxes and the modules , weapons used and I must say I am very disappointed in the whole affair. This whole thing was not even remotely close enough to make any significant swings in Ferox prices. Pointless.
---
Haven't moved mine in a year and they still extract the same amounts, AMA.
---
"I'll take one shift, please!" Lmfao what weird ass world do you live in
---
I understand that, but the participation standards for most alliances and coporations in nullsec are very low. Two hours of PvP per month isn't much.
---
Its a lot closer to 3:0 these days.
---
sf - spectre fleet
---
6b is still quite a lot in high sec, and it should get you a pretty solid abyssal fit Gila that can really easily run through the higher-tier sites. Have a look at this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98asvw/300_t5_abyssals_no_losses_a_complete_guide/) from last Summer for a bit of a better idea. The ISK/hr will be a bit off as more people are running the sites now but it's a good starting point for researching it. I would try out the sites with a cheaper ship before spending that much ISK though.
---
Another option could be high-sec incursions; they can get very repetitive but there's a lot of potential for ISK making and most incursion groups have SRP in case the FC or logi messes up so there's not a massive amount of risk either outside of suicide ganks.

But Brisc Rubal told me that HK is dead, how can this be?

 I don't like that it makes the skill that lowers your clone jump timers meaningless. They should have really looked at mechanics of both and rework them better. There ought to be some sort of a significant bonus or incentive to use player stations, but not entirely negating a skill, that is too much.
---
Yes, we all deal with this shit. Just ignore her and let her go to bed while you play spaceships. At least then you get some peace and quiet.
---
Not his fault his girlfriend doesn’t have a hobby lmao.

You phrase ‘working an extra hour’ like it’s just a matter of walking into a random business and going ‘hello I will be working here for one hour to supplement my income please pay now.’
---
 I have to say my favourite legend is removing POS's from the game is what created new PLEX. The legend goes, PLEX, back in the day, was immoveable and was locked to the station that it was redeemed in, so basically all PLEX has a location ID on it.
---
PLEX was later unlocked and such fun was had shooting RMT traders moving billions worth of PLEX in shuttles, but for ease of programming reasons, location ID remained. Then along came citadels and CCP start to phase out POS's but, BAM!, you can't delete POS's from the game without breaking all the historic PLEX floating around with their legacy location IDs. So to fix the problem, CCP have to introduce “new PLEX” and remove all the old code from the system before them can move on with citadels.     
---
Fact? Fiction? Who knows, but the timing was there, so there's probably more than a grain of truth. Anyway, what's your favourite Legacy Code Legend? 
---
Well thats median Househole income for the year. 
---
[source](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/argentina/annual-household-income-per-capita)
---
So considering Bangladeshs one is $600 that means that there are much poorer people in Bangladesh. 
---
This story is complete bullshit. 
---
I mean, not the part about the lack of commenting, but that's pretty standard for early stage startup codebases. POS code was nowhere near 1 million lines, it was the product of multiple developers, and none of those developers have been hit by a car (or a bus, as the story goes sometimes).
---
No. I was very seriously thinking about that but sadly, its not even a noticable dent in the overall market :( so it doesn't work. To make a dent you'd need like 2-3 engagements like this at the same time for a few weeks or even months. But then again they aren't jsut cheap ISK wise but material wise as well and Rorq mining ... yea, kinda pointless unfortunately. 
---
Wow people actually upvote this shit?

---
Yea a lot of my money is in ships. I have a rattlesnake and Kronos all high grade faction mods and whatnot. Isk wise I have around 700m 
---
\&gt; I don't whine, I just return the favor. You cried about this mean dude that you called a bitchy neckbeard before resorting to return the favor. Vile retard is just an adequate description for you and that's it.   
---
Nobody is crying about you. You're a herbivore. Completely harmless.  
---
\&gt;Yes of course it is your argument. You don't like bringing adequate numbers for the job, thus you refuse it as a solution to the advantages other players have build for themselves. Again: you cry so much about capitals and how an umbrella has made your enemies safer, but why do you cry when you have the tools to take that away? Because you are lazy, to loss averse and to socially inept to be able to get a group together and do something against it. That's your entire point.  
---
Your argument is essentially "Use this broken thing too if you want to get ahead." That's not how balancing works. Again defenders have almost all the advantages. I'm saying fine...keep almost all of them. Just modify local. You aren't negotiating anything as you claimed before. You just want everything.  
---
\&gt; So, bringing 1:1 numbers is blobbing? So everything except fighting severely outnumbered is "blobbing". Sure, if that's your definition then take it. I don't consider a 1:1 numbers ratio a blobfight but then again that's just me. Bringing adequate numbers for the job is a tool you just refuse to use.
---
Yes blobbing means having a huge fleet. It doesn't mean just outnumbering your enemies. But again you don't know any of this. You are a spineless herbivore krab kept safe by the tools of this game.  
---
\&gt; Then finally tell me about your conclusion about the numbers that I've presented. Because, so far, you didn't. If you did, quote it. 
---
What the hell are you talking about? I've addressed every single point. You stopped addressing points. Name one thing I didn't address.  
---
\&gt; You are trying to use the argument of "Small gangs can't compete with the alliances" as a reason to remove local. That's what you are trying by crying about the advantages players have built for themselves and which you could take down and tear apart if you would stop refusing to use adequate tools for the job. Ofc you can't fight a 1000+ Alliance with your 5 dudes in frigates/BS's. Why? Because they have superiour numbers and superior tools for the job. Why I don't consider this a problem? Because the same tools these people use are available for you to play with too and/or removable by yourself too.  
---
No...it's never been my argument that "small gangs can't compete with the alliances." I NEVER said that. I said that defenders already have numerous advantages that have kept increasing in the past few years. Citadels make every system safe. Alliance gates make it so you can avoid camps. Mining platforms keep your moon mining operations. The new cyno jammers again favor the defenders grossly. These are new mechanics created within the last couple of years. You want to build them and make them? Fine. Keep them. But limit local or give small gang groups a way to have some counter-play. I agree being the small gang group SHOULD BE DIFFICULT. That's why I play in this manner rather than the F1 mashing krab manner you do. But holy shit this is idiotic. I bet if CCP introduced a region wide module that just instantly killed any enemy ships in your space you'd just be blabbering "lololol why don't you just build your own mega coalition and install your insta-death module stop whining!"
---
This is (not) a gneiss post.
---
I would sell the Kronos, t2 ship prices have really gone up dramatically since the moon mining changes, and you will get more bang for your buck from pretty much any other ship.
---
The rest, well, it's up to you.

Have you heard about the exciting internships in the US? You’ll pay all of your expenses, work long grueling hours doing something tantalizingly close, but not quite related, to your area of study and then the job spots will go to executives kids anyway!
---
I remember a time when it was considered a disgusting thing to break out your wallet and wallet warrior your way into things.
---
congratulations on your drug habit 
---
I just searched up Imperial Trans and search by partial terms. 
---
&gt;I dont really understand. Wasnt being a diplo or named fc one of the biggest dream of most eve players? I mean what else in our life give us opportunity to lead others and reward fun at the same time. (Sry for shitty eng)
---
I was a raid leader in world of warcraft. It was a very similar thankless job that made you a target. It's just miserable and unfun trying to herd everyone around.
---
&gt;Actually Fcs should thank people for letting them to be fcs and have fun leading them.
---
Actually go fuck yourself please.
---
Thankyou friend
---
Imagine you are in BL / PL /BB Mun fleet and have to run your **tail between** your **legs** !
---
This video is great for ASMR, this is the EVE panacea I need to get to sleep at night, thanks.
---
Of course it isn't all that linear, the average income needed to live below the poverty line isn't the same all around the globe. I bet the slums in Bangladesh are quite similar in their country as in mine.
---
What many people don't get is the extreme poverty that some people live in. To see people opening trash bags in landfills searching for food... that kind of poverty is so ingrained in here that everyone has witnessed in someway quite often. In third world countries there's like another 'layer' of poverty that sadly goes quite deep.
---
Besides all that i think i get what you mean. It's just that listening on fleet comms and media in general (american movies for example, sometimes they depict countries SO WRONG). Those things Just accentuate the false sense of superiority thing that some first worlders (?) have.
---
aww cuuuuute.  its like GOTG is a little kid who found a penny and is expecting us to praise them for it.   sorry kid, try again, thats not an impressive isk value
---
Sounds like you'll fit right in :P
---
First pvp death, first pvp kill, first x shiptype, first x amount of isk, stuff like that. 
---
Lol typical wow raider.  
---
Most hilarious people who yell over killing rats. I mean i do understand u can get mad over people who cant even read how-to pve in wow.  
---
Why would u keep leading when u think its miserable unfun job lol. Are u an idiot or a liar? 
---
&gt; first worlders
---
I love that, sounds like someone from a  scifi insulting the peasants that still live on Earth:p.
---
And yeh i get what you mean, Most peoples ideas of anywhere that isnt home is skewed let alone their view of things like poverty.
---
I think in some ways its better than what a lot of people think but also worse in some cases as well. 
---
Wizard hat.

I'm looking for an MMO to play. I've backed Star Citizen. I'm not a huge fan of space games or Sci-Fi but I'm craving for MMO and had fun playing some Endless Space 2, so I thought I might give EVE a try. I'm not afraid from the learning curve, in fact, it's the hardcore aspect that's intriguing me. However I wouldn't want to stop playing EVE for SC when it gets out. How does the two compare? 
---
Yeah especially in the areas around starter systems anything over a few million is a lot to most people in local 😂
---
Reminder, always post your recent nice loot into local when passing through tutorial systems, it motivates newbies.
---
Honestly it's the current state of EVE everything is stale and retarded
---
Exactly, my initial thought was some sorta whale fetish thing. 
---
I'm still trying to find the reason for the 3-L's on "realll good and quick like."
---
No one asks people to fc, 
---
They choose to be leaders. 
---
They have fun being leaders but they also have to bear some responsibility at the same time. 
---
And you’re saying u were a leader of wow raider group once and it was a unfun miserable job and people should thank them.  
---
And i should fuck myself. Right? 
---
I'd rather someone bringing content to my door than them being banned.
---
Yeah I mentioned the Highsec Combat Anoms/Sigs myself, those are fun and decent money, plus you get to poach sites from other people sometimes and they can't go after you without Concord coming to see them.
---
but he never was banned?!
---
also low quality bait
---
It’s a good place for a small group of people to learn to work as a team as well, running 6/10s in frigs using logi etc, on the pathway to pvp :) 
---
&gt; No one asks people to fc, They choose to be leaders.
---
Both is true.
---
&gt;They have fun being leaders but they also have to bear some responsibility at the same time.
---
The responsibility can suck the fun out it.
---
&gt;And you’re saying u were a leader of wow raider group once and it was a unfun miserable job and people should thank them.
---
No. I'm saying just don't be a dick to your FC or other group leader. They are already doing a thankless job don't add you being an asshole on top of that.
---
&gt;And i should fuck myself. Right?
---
For saying that FCs should be thankful to take your shit? Yes you should.
---
I'm pretty sure a single space marine could destroy an entire Titan by himself while blindfolded and missing 1 arm.

back in CO2 and TRI, i learnd that there are no quick ailok fleets ;)
---
You can just stop being fc if responsibility suck the fun out of it. It just means fc are not your type of job. 
---
And lol being not thankful doesnt mean being an asshole. Its just mutual benefit. U can thank shop owners every time u buy stuff from them, but  you shouldnt ask other people to do it or tell them to fuck themselves if they dont.
---
Yes.  How do you know a wormholer when you meet one? They'll tell you :P (Wormholer btw) Evictions are, imo, a key part of living in jspace.
---
You're not wrong. The 10% fun is when there's actually some sort of fight (preferably 3rd partying someone else's bash to avoid the grind). The real work is the extraction but that's literally shipping out the spoils of someone else's work. If you want to make your isk in game then it counts well for return on time and effort. I don't find pve or mining particularly exciting either and the return not as good.
---
luckily, you never welp
---
6/10 don't spawn in HS afaik
---
I never liked warhammer. Now I know why. 
---
You don’t like the scale. It’s okay. There is a lot of things which was okay yesterday and completely bad taste today. Some of them are pretty small if you feel better this way. You can see them around you. 
---
Still the rule applies: “it was okay yesterday “ does not always mean that it should stay this way always.
---
There's less isk sink though if the money is redirected to other players
---
Finding the hole and hole control is a lot of the work as well.
---
&gt; You can just stop being fc if responsibility suck the fun out of it.

What the fuck? I never said this, i said don't be a shithead to your FC, most people are shitheads to FCs thats why people don't want to FC. If you say nothing to your FC you are already doing better than average.
---
&gt; You ALSO need to be present every day without a fault

No you don't, you can afford to not login if you don't want to or can't.

Ha, you should see mine.. I don’t even wanna look at it.
---
Can you elaborate a bit please? I thought Siggy was closed source so I'm not familiar with the issue (or is the security flaw the fact that everything is hosted by them?).
---
How is it like playing on your TV? I was planning to throw in my TV as a third monitor so I can have more space 😂
---
The games are completely different in almost every aspect besides the setting. 
---
* SC focuses on first person and high details, in EVE your character is the ship you're flying and you can't zoom in beyond that.
---
* Star Citizen will likely be more themeparky (the gameplay centers on quests and tasks generated by NPCs), EVE leaves the players to their own devices and lets them do whatever they like (which, as it turns out, is mostly killing each other).
---
* in SC, you have direct control over your ship and weapons. EVE is more old-school - you use weapons by activating them when you have enemies locked, and the ship aims for itself
---
* the high attention to detail in SC means the game will never be able to handle battles much larger than 100 people at once, in EVE this is considered a small, casual skirmish while the largest battles involve over 5,000 players fighting each other
---
* SC is still in development, EVE has already launched
---
* the universe of EVE is very rough and unforgiving, and the inhabitants tend to be the same way. They will kill you on sight if the opportunity arises for no reason at all. From what I've seen in SC (both from the community and the devs), griefing like that will be policed and players will have to act nice. 
---
The list goes on, but I hope you get the picture. You should judge both games on their own merits instead of trying to compare apples to oranges. 
---
"I tried to do one thing." 
---
Said every Eve player ever.
---
its great , bigger space ships lol
---
Fleet comms would enjoy this immensely
---
That could mean only one thing, bigger explosions...
---
Who shit over fc? Ure lying. Most people simply thank fc after fights. Which is perfect 
---
Plex was movable from day 1. 
---
You know what you need to do OP: Create an account, follow him around in game while saying "LOVE ME" in local chat.
---
&gt; Who shit over fc?
---
Who gives cashiers, servers and such shit?
---
&gt;Ure lying. Most people simply thank fc after fights.
---
No i'm recounting my experience as a brand new FC trying to learn the ropes and being deflected off the profession with a firehose of shit.
---
Yeah it probably got fixed after downtime
---
Not sure if they still do but WECU. used to do corp blops drops
---
Thank you for showing us your drug habit and flexing some modules. Very cool.
---
KYAAAH, MACHARIAL-SAMA!! P...please be gentle with Abaddon-kun!
---
Pretty sure that depends on the severity of whatever is wrong. The old launcher had a box that displayed ads from CCP such as skins, PLEX, etc. Then we had scrollable news / a list of the most recent news.
---
New launcher moved away from that and now both the ads and the recent news are all in their own boxes. That's the only difference, there's not more ads than before.
---
Show me you complaining about that exact problem when we had the older launcher ;)
---
We should be happy that he still gives us rorquals to save... a quick response fleet can make a slow day fun
---
As eng is my second language, couldnt really understand ur abstract expression. 
---
But whatever. Im also in legacy, and i do thank my fcs for protecting our space and assects. And i know how much efforts they put into besides fleet fights. 
---
Good for you  being a brave fc and Good luck, wish u have fun leading in eve this time. 
---
Daaaamn

Meh, not nearly as fun as delivering stuff to someone whos alliance is pissy about killboards.

They want that hole so that they have one less red giant to roll for when they're krabbing. M8 you're a nullbear so I don't expect you to understand how this works but nobody wants a c6 to pvp. If they wanted to pvp in c6 space they'd have stayed in their 5-6.
---
You're essentially saying that goons shouldn't hold delve because all they do is Krab in it and other people could have used it to pvp.

*Woah!* It's your **6th Cakeday** L_Andrew! ^(hug)
---
It's similar at voltron.. I hear our enemyes pay our FC:s to not undock
---
Except that like 99% of that alliance members were not affiliated with that story you are revenging for. Some of them are not even aware about and would not support it.
---
That’s what this story is about.
---
Because a game like Eve requires resources to exist. It's not an offline game that you pay once and only use up resources whenever ***you*** play. The infrastructure needs to be there at all times (not to mention all the other operational costs a company has).
---
What I'm saying is that if you extrapolate the scenario and imagine every single player PLEXing every single account, Eve suddenly would not be sustainable anymore and would die.
---
Therefore it is in CCP's (and Eve's) interest that the game is not 100% self-contained, so some people will actually pay for it. The alternative would be something a lot of people here complain about, CCP adding tons of things like skins in order to make money. People need to think about this a lot more than they seem to do: do you want a better game, or do you want a "free" one? Currently there's no way to have both at the same time.
---
Lastly, I'd like to point out that if the game didn't encourage (or force) you to have multiple accounts, this would be way less of a problem.
---
Gotta make the most of the peace before goonies come and roll them for another 50 fac. Forts lol.

those who undock and those who stay dock

that is the two types of players in eve

Lol legendary. I do like declarations of war tho.

You have no idea what you are talking about do you? 125 \* 36 (regular work week) = 4500 euro a week. Lol. That's top tier salary. 3000-4500 a month is much closer to reality. And that's before taxes.

Because it's good content and the accuracy is largely close aside from a mistake in a 50 minute video. Discouraging the attempt is everything this community doesn't need.
---
Perhaps because your mother smoked heavily while pregnant with you.
---
I have found it's always the same few people crying about prices,  I list high enough to cover fuel costs and my time.  Then while 99% of a group is enjoying content those few people sit docked up waiting for someone to run their cheaper stuff to staging, maybe next week, maybe not.  Logistics though can burn out just as fast as FC's, anything other than an F1 line member really can.

If it was a small mistake, yea.

When its something thats easily checked by doing a 5 minute google search, no.

AFAIK you still have to pay the sales tax in citadels.

A lot of people see that as a net positive to Eve, that its PVE has risk. I don't mind that, and I do a lot of the lower-effort PVE. My VNIs are at risk, so are my haulers and miners. I have to keep them safe. If we still had the old moon miners, I'd have to protect those and the ships pulling materials from them.
---
Passive income that retains some risk is still acceptable.
---
lol, go whiteknight somewhere else
---
Maybe you should look at zkill for Delve today, it would answer your question. 
---
Sounds like the next expansion!
---
The problem is that EVE battles can often look like something from the Syrian civil war. Multiple sides with varying levels of animosity towards each other and shifting loyalties depending on the objectives fought over. 
---
If you want to fight like the Russians and literally kill everyone who’s not your primary ally then no problems, the current system is set up perfectly for you. If you’re going to LARP as western special forces and truly immerse yourself in the nuances and politics of the region then you need more than just  very bad/bad/neutral/good/very good categories to truly get your head around the different sides.

as opposed to cheaters who aren't caught?

Nah, these guys did their level best to avoid any kind of even pvp for the last month. We just had a handful of alts in there to fight their corp. Like that dread brawl was still them just trying to gank one of my dreads and leave again. We just caught them and actually had a fight. These guys do not pvp other than risk-free ganks at all. 
---
Gotta go fast?
---
I like that legend about concord billboards somehow being an essential part of the game that couldn't be removed because of POS code.
---
It would be nice if you could set a property in a container to not repackage. I know station containers are supposed to have the 3 week thing but I don't get how it works or if you can override it. I and I'm sure everyone have all had this happen at some point.
---
*  This advice - to use your Carriers in conjunction with at least one Titan in the fleet as your flagship 
---
Cap stability is overrated.
---
The note says to run one rep constantly and second rep when needed. It reps more with one rep running (stable) than your fit with both reps running.
---
Wether you need more tank or dps I don't know.
---
Wish REEEEEEEEEEEEEEing on reddit served as evidence, eh?
---
This and the OP are wrong. PLEX was introduced originally to replace GTCs, which weren’t in game items at all, and PLEX were always moveable

I could say the same but apperantly you're to stupid to undersgand that.
---
I'm not the one getting offended lol
---
Forgive me, but what does FC mean?
---
generally I respect your shitposting strength but the reason plex is spiking (in part) is because the injector boosters caused everyone who was HODLing to dump their stores when the price jumped over christmas. All the skill farmers want in on those high prices rn, and there’s been no sales to offset the cost. 
---
It also generally hurts because yes there is a dwindling PCU so there’s overall less plex entering the game (but I have no way of proving that because correlating anything to PCU, even real players, is a crap shoot)
---
What?   
---
It only reps 26hp/s with one rep running and if you don't have perfect skills you're going to have CPU and PG problems.  
---
Mine reps 38 with both running. (I do C2s all the time, you don't need more than that.)  
---
More DPS = faster sites = faster money so.. yes..  
---
You don't need more tank.  
---
You clearly don't even do sleeper sites so why bother commenting on the fit?
---
At one point you couldn't log in on the forums if you were docked in a citadel. (I don't remember if this was when citadels were added or after some other change)
---
I didn't say the vid was bad, i said that part was bad.
---
Why touch a topic you know nothing about when there are so much to talk about, it would only shave 5 mins of the video.
---
No need to get triggered
---
No. It will never be more difficult for a bot.
---
Bots don't get fatigue, bots don't accidentally press the wrong button, bots don't get distracted.

Just be fucking honest. You don't give a fuck about bots. You just want to be fed effortless free kills to pad your killboard.

Hi Jack, I hope you've been on some of my fleets!

The feeling of providing fun content and making friends is a big reason why I love to FC. The other big reason is what I'll leave in a video. The feeling of just pulling a maneuver perfectly is amazing, almost like after you have a really good workout.

---
26 HP/s is meaningless number. You need to look at EHP/s.
---
Your fit repairs 129 EHP/s while the wiki one reps 133 EHP/s with one repper and 267 EHP/s with both reppers.
---
No I don't do sleeper sites.
---
Fair point. But do you have evidence of Mar5hy using it illegally, except the chat messages of his chars?

Exterminatus is "just" planetary bombardment of some such. 
---
I faintly remember a phrase about "glassing" a planet (or just a city for starters?) in eve lore. Sounds like something Amarr would do. That would probably serve as a good start to exterminate a planet.

That's not what an exterminatus is either, tho.

They just bar the planet of life permanently. Virus bombs and various kinds of nukes.

Yes and skill injectors are the biggest cancer in the game :(

I'm surprised it's not standard practice to pay FCs.

Zarvox also does public fleets several times a week. all the regulars have public channels, just google some stuff.

---
Putting Concord in the equation is meaningless, since their **equipment** is \*magic\* and as far from lore as possible. I think the most powerful equipment in EVE that follows lore is the WH npcs. 
---
Beyond that the Imperium has more than a million fully colonized, heavily industrialized and militarized planets with an average population of 5 billions per planet. And that's just for base economy.
---
Their ships have weapons that can crack planets. Then again, they have planets that are fortress worlds, meaning that the PLANETS play the role of VERY BIG KEEPSTARS. PLANET big. With weaponry to match size in number and strength. 
---
Imperium ships number at 3.5 million, give or take a few hundred thousand. We make the news when we see more than 15k users online. Also, Imperium BS are as big as player Titans, have bigger and stronger guns with longer ranges, have their own DD called nova cannons, are a lot tougher and faster in space, don't mind ramming enemy ships and boarding actions are part of standard tactics; the boarding actions are performed by 3-meter-tall augmented monsters that used to be human, that have internal carapaces, armor, machine pistols that fire explosive rockets(!), carry chainswords (WTF!) and are ferociously loyal to their emperor.
---
The only thing we might have going for us is cynos, reps and stealth tech. Cynos will provide mobility but Imperium can ignore warpgate routes and travel right through the Warp to the destination of their choosing. Reps may or may not counter the toughness of Imperium ships (imho, they'll just alpha through everything). Stealth... well some of the Imperium's enemies also have stealth, and they also have as good tech as the Imperium (which means better than New Eden's), and still the Imperium is coming on top.
---
So yeah, we wouldn't stand a chance against the Imperium of Man, even if all Empires, Pirate factions, players, drifters, sleepers, triglavians and drones actually came together. And you haven't heard me say a word about the magical powers that are available as part of the Imperium's arsenal.

Nope, but its nice to have!

The imperium of man has the technology to ignite the atmosphere of a planet. That’s destroying it for all intents and purposes. And in the gothic war Abaddon used a planet killer which was based on imperial technology and could blow a planet up Death Star style 
---
so which of your rorqs did we kill tonight?
---
None, actually. I just don't think an organization like BB should be so accepting of known cheaters
---
Making a spreadsheet about experiences in spreadsheets online. You just turned it up to 11!
---
that aint 6 gorilion in kills
---
so does this mean Raitarukun is a tsundare? vulnerable but still takes an effort to get past her shields and defenses?
---
#whatthehek

GOTG did not attack horde, horde with the help of Black Legion and CO2 attacked GOTG.
---
Barely. Really only dreads use ehe, and if you have to use it you're likely to die anyways.
---
Shut up you fat dribbling spastic. 
---
That's why you have to be assertive, if someone looks shifty, don't bend over and welcome them in. Stand your ground, if they stabbed you in the back and you trust them a second time, it sucks to suck buddy. 
---
Always assume someone will try to screw you over. If an entity has a habit of shifting loyalty, they're just a potential loose end, you deserve that lossmail. And every character is potentially a scout, you might as well color every character in the game.
---
this is going... well probably one place
---
Do people not have grass that need cut or snow that needs shovelled or other short duration manual labour tasks that people don't mind paying $10-20 cash to do? 
---
Jake Lightman... the myth and legend and torch bearer of the remnant of FCON
---
CCP didn't ban him after the chat incident so everything is fine.
---
Faxes too... An apostle with an ehe can tank a direct hit from a KS DD
---
Not normally ones where you just walk up to someone’s home and go ‘pay me bitch.’

&gt;It's a game. Why should the best way to make money *in a game* not come from actually *playing the game*?
---
Where did I say that? I said the best way to pay subscription is cash, then you grind in-game for the in-game stuff you want. 
---
whats with the salt man? have you slept with your wife recently? getting laid is know to improve mental well being and easy tension meaning you'll be less angry about pointless shit.
---
...fair.

[To the person who downvoted me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq76UtQWLJw)
---
Adversity?
---
Farming? In an MMORPG? Unheard of!
---
I think it's 100m/fleet. The Corp just pays your wallet with isk. Not bad honestly if you have fun doing it
---
I mean I'm making bank from them so not really complaining but they defo killled the fundamentals of this game.
---
i think he sold his account, his kill count has gotten progressively higher the last couple of decades
---
Corporation [Nazi Germany]
---
Alliance [Axis Powers]
---
you couldn't even do that right
---
it's for the people who can't afford it
---
James 315 is generous and has gifted many in the new order hundreds of billions over the years.
---
Questionable piloting confirmed
---
Team10 btw
---
I would make isk off them too if I could. Its a mechanic, so use it... I just wish it didn't have this bad an effect on the game 
---

---
Shame you didn't do the same earlier I guess
---
actually that would make it worse not fine, because it would mean you can blatantly cheat in public and they do nothing.
---
Consistency is key
---
Yep saw that! Was gf for sure not knocking skill U 
---
who makes this shit up 
---
Uninstalling 2019
---
obligatory no u
---
Eh rorquals where a separate issue to skill injectors. Really bad balancing on CCP Parts. 
---
Injectors just made them even worse because now you can have everything immediately if you wanted it,.
---
That's the best part though, that type of chat message is mentioned by Falcon is his forum post about IS boxer and broadcasting as being against the rules, so even IF all marshy ever did was use it for that one message its STILL cheating.
---
Skill injector cancer and Rorqual aids go hand in hand... People are injecting 3 or more rorqual alts... And thats all that alt can do... Sit in an anom and chew spod. 
---
no, fuck effort free isk faucets.
---
Ccpls nerf insurance
---
no, I'm telling you that this is not a passive activity. And the (isk gain) / (total active time) was &lt;300M/h when I did it.
---
I know you are shocked. I mean people told you again and again that it was a passive activity, while now I tell you it is not. 
---
Take your time to think of it, make your own experience of the topic.
---
You mean, like when gaara lit the cyno on all his rorqs at the same time and wasn't banned for it but weeks later for RMTing?
---
Some of us even do things in game on alts while mining, just because you lack imagination does not mean the entire servers population does.
---
Wow.....you lucky bastard.
---
If this is a serious question, FC stands for Fleet Commander
---
I'm more shocked you are so trash at doing PI that you managed to make it such an active activity you think it's sensible to compare it to actual active ISK making methods. 
---
Well black ops BS and covert cynos didn't always exist. Plus anchorable cyno jammers and stuff.
---
Personally I think the whole problem is cynos. They should have a spool up time for cyno beacons.
---
imagine being in GOTG and literally getting shit on by everyone daily...
---
yikers
---
I have been on some of your feets. I'm glad you like FCing, it's just that it wasn't for me. When i first joined bni i was encouraged to try out FCing so i did from my atron. We flew around for a half an hour and found no one to fight and people were starting to get frustrated with me and i took us home and everyone was mad. 
---
That's the part i don't get why people put up with it.
---
Has this been a fun war for TAPI/Horde line members?   Seems kind of cool to me to be fighting for an objective.
---
Maybe someone fell asleep on the return key....
---
Cheating on accident to spam chat isn’t worth a ban. 
---
They are called flash drives these days good sir.
---
You think galmil would have let that happen? Pen is out lives next door and snuff the other rakapas entities  3 j out (or 1 cyno away) ... Rediculious to think that calmil could have clinged onto tama after the last system flip..i forgot  fedup they were 5j out ( now they are 30 :D
---
Man if only you guys sold them you might make some money 🤔
---
The Eve Capsule app on Android has that broken down by months that lets you even see exactly what you bought/sold.
---
While the drag/offline thing exists, there's a newer issue I've found - dragging the module won't let you disable it. Only docking will, so lmao get fucked if you need that module and you're a long away from docking. 
---
" You mean, like when gaara lit the cyno on all his rorqs at the same time and wasn't banned for it but weeks later for RMTing? " So no, it wouldn't be like that because clearly the cyno thing set off an investigation that ended in an RMT ban because they found a reason to perma ban for RMT instead of giving him a 30 slap on the wrist for broadcasting. This would be like them doing nothing to gaara at all.
---
They have many terms to them. 
---
Every day we stray further and further from God's grace.
---
Yeah Goons are bad and get hellafarmed. And?
---
Then why do so many bots die when local glitches out and dies?
---
The girlfriend started weaving Eve terms into dirty talk in bed the other day, OP you should try doing that and see how it goes!
---
black ops already get countered by capitals. And again defenders have citadels, alliance only gates, and of course local. The defenders have overwhelming advantages. There needs to be fair play and counter-play.
---
My favorite legend is ship skins. Everytime CCP releases a ship skin, local breaks.
---
Around here they do that themselves.
