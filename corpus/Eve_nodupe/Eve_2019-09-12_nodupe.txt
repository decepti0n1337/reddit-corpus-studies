Hey, I've been playing on a real turd of a laptop and have noticed performance declines recently. 
---
I'm not sure why this has been working for me but if I change the shaders and textures to medium from low after I'm already in game I get an increase in frame rate.
---
If the game starts with the settings on low and I change to medium I get improved FPS. And if the game starts in medium and I switch to low I get a similar increase. Point being, in my case it seems to be making the change that improves the framerate not the setting itself.
---
Also if you're on a real turd laptop like me close the launcher once you're in your account. It makes relogging slower but the Launcher takes a bit to run as well.
---
Very few have done that man. Cant say I read all the shit on here but most have just kept quiet regarding to new players.

But if people are then fkem.

Nope, cause eve is dying! :)

its new game. well some ships  similar to eve
---
Every single post where someone asks if they should come back or if they should start has at least 1 shitlord comment.  I usually message the person directly as well as comment welcoming them to the game.   Its crazy that the same people that complain the player counts are down are the same ones telling people  not to play.... totally nuts
---
&gt; but the negative and circlejerking has made me look elsewhere for eve content
---
I'm a Newbro looking to inhale Eve discussion, can I ask where you ended up? :)
---
found  in starting system like 20.. remember this game is fresh so it will have to build up
---
I tried it for a few minutes then promptly uninstalled it after rescuing The Damsel. Take my advice... don't play.
---
Ok guy.

&gt;I've noticed screwy situations before where the item hp goes negative,

Can't they fix that by setting it as unsigned? O.,.o

I'm not 100% sure of who at CCP this issue would be best sent to, but I would start with their security team: security@ccpgames.com.

Literally my only argument. Just look at every September. There are plenty of people who are in school at 23. Literally anyone in grad school who took some time off would be in that category and it’s not like PCU dropped 50%.
---
Burner missions are fine. Not everyone is doing them and they’re difficult to bot. Once those standings drugs expire in October, LP prices will rise again as the hard farming subsides a bit. Fewer people will be willing to develop faction pullers at that point, so fewer burner farmers will enter the market.
---
For the amount of effort, money, and time I’ve invested in my burner running setup, I can honestly say that if CCP nerfs them, I’m just going to quit and play another game. Fuck grinding any harder for the ability to have fun. I’ve already “adapted” to this from other time consuming and expensive activities.

To be honest, calling someone a SJW pussy makes you sound like a neckbeard.

Ah ye thats going too far. Like I seriously dislike the path were on but its an argument between the parents and involving the children is just wrong. So good on you for taking care of them.
---
Props to the nidhoggur pilot for having balls and enjoying the thrill of risk.
---
Haven't seen those things, but it seems odd to lose so many real players over one little thing. Though, maybe it just seems like a minor thing to someone who has spent time in WHs?
---
Wasn't discounting those things, just didn't know of them.

Oh ye? Where was this?

HAHAHAHA thats what you get for thumbing all my ~~shit~~posts down.

you're trying too hard

Is it me or did this post not age well?

There are three main categories that make EVE - the gameplay itself, the strategy, and the social /psyche of EVE. People sort of ignore the second category but almost everyone greatly underestimates and neglects the third category and fails to understand how impactful it is on the overall health of the game.

No, people are laughing at them for being dumb enough to start a second war when they're already getting shitcanned in the last one they started.
---
While the client may have at one point processed it, I doubt it retains a cache of the durability data on items not actively in use, especially in nested containers. That would be a waste of memory except in this case and I doubt that CCP made a design choice like that.
---
It would also mean that people who own and hoard a ridiculous number of items (we all know a hoarder) will have worse client performance and that doesn't make sense from a fairness point of view.
---
Looks fun!

First time doing something like this inn a long time so alot of mistakes where done

I feel like everyone is being super ridiculous about this and wagging their psuedo code dicks around.
---
Client side gets same info it already gets. Then client filters out items at 100%. Or at the very least sorts them by lowest to highest. 
---
And the repair state is indexed in some manner because it's fucking returned in a list.... And the game is already either (shittily) adding in a bunch of zeros for every single 100% item every time it calculates the repair cost, or, (more likely) removing those items and then calculates the cost of remaining items. In either case, it's doing the math already and it is not going to crash the server to add literally a single code block of 
---
Foreach i in  fuckinglist do
---
        If i.damage_cost &gt; 0
---
        list.add(displaylist,i)
---
        End
---
End
---
Or any other of the million ways to put that simple concept into code. Eve is spreadsheets in space and there's built in filter options. It just hurt my brain enough to make me comment that people were talking about intense server queries as if they were a legitimate reason that this couldn't/shouldn't be implemented.

But it's ok, now he cares and he's giving us a sov null sob story because something he liked got nerfed (like countless other things before, it's what happens in every MMO game periodically).

Yeah yeah, i know, scamming is all part of the game and all that jazz...which brings me to the main point, so i'll cut the sarcasm and be serious.

90% of people here also like to say they do and enjoy pvp but couldn't fit a ship or manual pilot if their life depended on it, so unless you recognize the name i'd advise against taking pvp related opinions in here

Yet the UI/UX design team is by far their most active department.  This must be what Hell feels like.
---
There are edge cases where you can and should drop to negative HP.
---
For example, if you take a lot of damage in a Wolf-Rayet, and splash out, you lose that armor HP effect and can drop into negative HP. You don't die, but will if you take even 1hp of damage. You could argue that instead, a valid solution is just to die; however, this means that in terms of gameplay you can be killed without a killer (since it was loss of effect, and all the killing damage happened in another system so it doesnt transition to killmail) and additionally it makes such an effect less valuable since at low HP you essentially become trapped inside. I'm also not entirely sure but this may apply to links too which becomes... problematic since they are technically continually reapplies.
---
This can also happen to drones since they get skill based HP buffs. It would be pretty silly for a drone to go *poof* out of combat if for example you eject ship with a sufficiently damaged drone. That would just suck.
---
Man, carriers are so bad right now.
---
Intelligent shit talking lmao
---
So I have an easier idea than trying to get more nigerian princes in the game (like literally).
---
How about, and this one is a shocker I know, we just revert the shit that is driving away the current playerbase? Oh sorry bots right? Tadaaaa!
---
Do that and the next person to undock from a citadel will be flying the citadel.
---
I haven't seen this, but I have noticed that it is mostly useless.  It is way too imprecise to be worth paying attention to.
---
I mean, Eve players are some of the most intelligent gamers in the world and the propaganda to come out of this community is world class
---
Also I love how to responded with one answer.....then 10 min later changed it to make it sound cooler. You're not helping out your situation here.
---
true its in an especially tough spot. i was more trying to say that sub is not historically pro ccp. have you ever been to the start citizen forum. its exactly that, everything is shut out if its not praise of some sorts.

So you quit in 2004, before freighters, dreadnoughts, outposts, carriers, motherships, titans, or jump freighters were even introduced?  Because of capital proliferation?  Are you having a piss?

Oh johny123 is online, oh he's probably mining or ratting let me join him. (In a different corp/alliance)

Oh there's that new guy, let me see if he wants my salvage.

Those little things made where you set up shop feel like home.

I enjoy playing with players not in my same corp/alliance. I enjoy that community of being part of large null bloc. You keep seeing the same people in your area and you build relationships with them.

I am autz so it's normal to see low numbers and not having alot of people online, but recently is something else.... I'll be flying around for hours, doing PI, exploring, and gas mining and don't see anyone (or barely anyone).

---
I see you conveniently ignored the options mentioned that are already in game or the simple possibility of just not doing it in the stupidest possible way.
---
&gt; It would also mean that people who own and hoard a ridiculous number of items (we all know a hoarder) will have worse client performance and that doesn't make sense from a fairness point of view.
---
Funny you mention it, but I've used degraded client performance due to excessive items as a market weapon before.
---
I was competing with a region-wide buy order against another buyer. This was for an item that is useless unless you buy &gt;100 of them at once. I was fed up with 0.01 isking against him all of the time, and I noticed his region-wide order didn't have a minimum quantity, so I hatched an evil scheme.
---
I started by changing my region-order to have a minimum quantity enough to make it worth my time to go to the station. Then I used an alt and made 150 courier contracts shipping a small amount of this item to every single NPC station in the region. 
---
Then I went through the list of delivered items and sold *one* of the item from every single NPC station in the region. I used an alt because loading that many items really killed my game and I didn't want to deal with that shit on my main account.
---
This means that his asset window now included 1 item at every single NPC station in the region. In my experience, that took his load-time for the asset window from a few seconds and increased it to about a minute. 
---
I did that every day for two weeks and then he quit eve. I really just wanted to get him to drop out of competition for that item and I kinda feel bad that he quit the entire game. 
---
My point is that you get severely degraded client performance when dealing with large numbers of items, so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if CCP is doing the slower thing even if it doesn't make sense from an outsider's' perspective.
---
Yea its so easy to be uncatchable
---
Ah that was why I was confused. Thanks.
---
Hey there!
---
You're right.  It's terribly difficult to say "Hey guys, anyone in this system with me?" 
---
Fucking impossible.  No wonder eve is dying with the level of effort required to type that in chat, or, I don't know, speak on comms.  What will CCP force us to do next, breathe our own air?  CCPLEASE
---
Excellent, why not do more of it? Go completely steam roll them out of the game. You guys have the means and it's fun.

“I walked through a shitty part of town waving money and didn’t get mugged, therefore I was never at risk.”

There was a popular post a while ago here about a guy from Cuba and the challenges playing games there.
---
You didn't even reverse-interpolate the transversal property of the modified Jacobian. Let alone integrate across the temporal axis to deduce the transposed secondary loop.
---
Frankly I don't understand how you can expect anyone to take this seriously.
---
Why are you attacking the physical attributes of a real life person for making changes in a game that you disagree with? Criticize his management of the company, the game, or all of his ideas, but you don't know a single thing about the actual man. I'm not perfect, I've said some shit in the past that I now regret but that doesn't change what I'm saying about this now.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you do that ? Do you just have a bunch of anchored containers in a deep safe ?
---
I've really been enjoying myself in the chaos era - I came back from an unsub and a biomass for this.  I've been creating all sorts of havoc by myself that I could never accomplish before.  I subbed three accounts for this.
---
So this is what the player base who is against EvE chaos changes turns to?
---
Nothing cuz the Zen master is a bit that left!
---
The performance/QoL problem here is based on exploration of nested containers. That's the reason that containers are limited to 10K item stacks.
---
However nesting allows us to have more than 10k stacks in a station. With double nesting we can have 100,000,000 which is a significantly more difficult case.
---
While you may argue that this worst case can't possibly crop up, this would create significant amounts of lag that can be abused (for example locking out a system by massive lag generation as was done with Goon drone comps)
---
You may also be incorrect about the database design, because of damaged modules vs damaged ships. Damage of a module is going to be its own table, and damage of a ship is going to be a different one. The table structure is probably 4 tables here: one table linking hangars to stacks; one table for stack name/properties not including damage (since, for example, a stack of ores cannot be damaged), one table for stacks which contain singleton assembled modules and their properties (such as heat damage), and finally a table for ships and their contents/hp levels.
---
Especially for modules it is not guaranteed that names are even stored within this hierarchy. Since we know there are general item types with names we can surmise there is a 5th table that doesnt really change, ordered by TypeID, with the type name and static properties. Like, one entry for all Worms for example. This design also allows for Abyssal modules to exist for example.
---
In fact I would argue that keeping names with damage in the same record is the *wrong* design. Suppose you have twelve blasters of the same type. They can all have different damages, but they *must* have the same name. If CCP decides to rename *Neutron Blaster Cannon II* to  *Void Stabbies v2* one day then it doesn't make sense to chase down every last one with a query; instead you should be able to rename a single globally shared record. This not only keeps maintenance effort and storage requirements to a minimum but also improves data integrity in case of accident/corruption.
---
&gt; PCU is literally everything

Why do people post stupid shit like this? Guess this is the reddit cancer i hear so much about.

all game discussions aside, this is hysterical.

definitely not

it's me or this shit actually sounds fucking scary coming from mangos? when someone messes with them (the already helldunked elo and used their super fleet to defend their stuff) they've showed that they can pull more of their weight and if elo actually messes with them there will be only blood and ashes left on mango's path.

and yes i forgot about fw plexing, +1 the list tyvm

This why he wants to attract newer, younger players, so he can steal their youth.

That's just it.  It's not one little thing.  It's a cascade of little things from over the years.  This one just happened to push a lot if folks to the point of finally saying "enough".
---
The game had been bordering on the edge of "not-fun' for years.   
---
Now but being able to come back from a real life break and not bring able to effectively move myself about to fly with friends just ticked it over for me.  By the time I find enough people willing to risk recons or blops to move my carrier suitcase, my rare free weekends when I can get into decent fights is over.

Great way to bait out solo hot droppers then...
---
One things is they copying another game, another one is using the same engine. The engine doesn't have anything to be with how the game looks.
---
First, we are moving the goal posts. It was 'small alliances', now its 'small low skilled alliances' .... But regardless.
---
If your a brand new alliance null should be hard. That is the point of null, one of the harder but far more rewarding regions to  play in. Start out in low sec and build up.
---
Beyond that, I still dont see many of those 'small new' alliances complaining on here. It is still large null groups complaining about changes that 'dont affect them very much' for 'small new alliances'.
---
This assumes everyone’s sub renewed right before the blackout went into place.  Its more likely subscriptions from unsubbed players would have been slowly ticking up rather than a sudden spike.  
---
Then you have to consider returning players, such as myself.  Without CCP releasing numbers publicly (unlikely) about the number of active subscriptions and unique players with a subscription, there’s no way to know with certainty how CCP’s bottom line has changed.
---
Are you lost bro? This is r/eve not r/SafeSpacesOfReddit.
---
Not kidding, not trying to promote SG.
---
Just wanted to see if light could be shed since there's been no word on how the game engine licence happened.
---
This might be a novel thought, but maybe make join a corp/alliance/make friends.  Makes the whole game much more enjoyable.
---
Would be nice to have a decent community though
---
Implying that wasn't happening already before the recent changes lmao
---
agreed
---
I'm looking for anything free in-game. Free advice free ships. anything to help get that edge.
---
Not with out a Mcaffee endorsement it doesn't.
---
A guy I knew who worked for a financial adviser was legally blind. He had software which read out audible notifiers of some kind when changes happened on the screen, and he was somehow able to input back. He was scarily fast too. Unfortunately I cannot remember the software name, but it might be useful to know this stuff exists (if you didn't already).
---
Eh, it's hard to call it terrible when it actually does a competent job of explaining all the controls.
---
Frankly I was pretty impressed, I wish CCP took a design cue and forced actual new players through a hand holding tutorial. As much as "here's a ship, fuck you" is the standard, real guidelines would help EVE seem a lot less daunting to a prospective player.
---
My old Corp had alot of military, NSA, and I at the time was working for Homeland Security. We just gravitated together and had real world friends join us playing that game. So it stands to reason that our friends were a part of that world.
---
Granted, it does have its merits, but "here do this" without any context as to why has me still trying to wrap my head around some stuff and why it's there. But for a game that's one day old, I guess it will get better...
---
goon stop posting
---
Your username suggests you already lost your innocence.
---
I just don't see how missing Local is enough to quit playing. Cyno changes either... I mean, Caps have been cancer for a long while, and sure these changes are jarring, but not unworkable.
---
Hm, it hasnt done it anymore today, at least not as harsh as mentioned above. Hm, maybe some quirk cause of my ages-old-installation and having it freshly patched? No idea. But, well, it is still off most of the time. My faster ships tend to start warping when the bar is just half-through, while the slow slugs hit the end of the bar and then keep aligning, aligning, aligning, aligning... -.-
---
EVE is so unique, in fact, that it would be very difficult to accidentally duplicate. It's EVE re-skinned.

AAR: Winter Co. and PanFam have begun to fucus their entosis efforts onto Tenerifis and created a very favorable timer for FRT at 1400 out of a RAZOR i-hub in system B-6STA. This system is part of a linear dead end constellation, Legacy had intended to help blockade the entrance to the constellation.
---
However, while in route, Legacy saw Snuff's bomber wing jump ahead of them. Suspecting they might bomb the Legacy fleet before arriving, Legacy took a back route into the constellation via jump bridges that lead to 0P-U0Q. Blockading this system would give RAZOR control of four of the six systems in the constellation and a good chance at more entosis nodes.
---
Winter Co. entered 0P-U0Q with 275 Muninns, Cerberus, ONI's and Feroxs to face off with Legacy, Mangos and [FI.RE](https://FI.RE)'s 325 Muninns and later 10 [FI.RE](https://FI.RE) capitals. At this time, hostile entosis slipped into the system to contest deeper into the constellation.
---
While Winter Co. forces were pushed off the field, the entosis battle continued at a stalemate of 53%. Wintero Co. reformed with 150 Muninns but turned around at 46DP-O, the border of Detorid and Tenerifis as the entosis battle swung towards RAZOR.
---
GF all around, big props to the guys who reshipped so quickly on both sides and got back out there. Also, big shout out to Ron for his first big fleet against Elo, we had a great time flying under you. Hope y'all enjoy the video!

Eve isn't dying, but it takes some gymnastics and leaps of logic to deny that it isn't healthy atm.

Yes, well, CCP was purchased by PearlAbyss which is now BlueHole, so the new parent company has probably given or sold the game engine, without bothering to mention it, and I'm wondering why.
---
Join Constellation or Region chat. Make it feel more populated yourself and stop asking for others to do it for you.

Or move to lowsec.

would be nice to have a ceo who doesn't [listen to the voices in his head](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d2vy76/the_reason_chaos_seems_like_insanity_hilmar_is/) telling him to destroy his company's game.
---
oh, sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your delicate feelings.
---
Real life politics = no.
---
Yeah it started about 10 years ago.
---
What is a clone soldier? Do you mean the carrier mission? The reward is under 250k at level 3 missions. And it's took me two months for these.
---
just because it doesnt effect your playstyle it effect 1000's of other peoples.
---
I played every day since 2009 with 10 accounts paid for with cash and ive quit as i saw these bad changes coming about 4 months ago. yes i still read this sub but honestly at this time i dont ever see me coming back.
---
It's not about characters and skillpoints, it's about knowing a few things (and that's why most people tell newbros to join a corp, to learn).
---
I was away from the game for more than a decade. I came back, made an alpha clone and decided i would try exploration, since it didn't exist when i first stopped playing and i wanted to explore different playstyles than my old null-sec habits.
---
Brand new, fresh alpha clone, straight off the tutorial and career agents. I read a couple of guides, fit a t1 exploration frigate and on my second day i started wormhole diving. I made 100 mil in a couple of days, despite losing a couple of ships.
---
I put that isk into a VNI for running combat sites and the event sites CCP occasionally puts in the game. While training the skills for it, i did the Sisters of EvE epic mission arc to get some extra cash and for the standings boost. Once i could fly the VNI i started running those event sites in a group with 3-4 other people i met in the starter corp, a few of which were completely clueless (less than a week old characters). I was a returning player but i was also very rusty and didn't know all the new stuff that had been added to the game while i was not playing. Still, we made a few hundred million each from cerebral accelerators.
---
I put that money into gas huffing skills, some trading skills and some manufacturing skills. I started making and selling tech1 rigs for a bit of passive income (rigs get destroyed all the time, so there is always a demand). I also started buying faction ammo from a trade hub and moving it close to a faction warfare hotspot to resell for a higher price. Everytime a batch sold, i would make 25 million isk.
---
At this point i could afford a gila, so i started running combat sites (both regular ones for the escalations and the scannable ones), which over time gave me a nice stash of faction loot to sell. All the while, i was flying around with some other newbros, talking to people and exchanging ideas about fitting ships (i was away for so long, that a lot of the ships had been significantly changed in the meantime). I ended up taking some of the new guys into a wormhole, about 5 of us in frigates, looking for stuff to kill. Sadly, we only found 2 other newbros from the same starter corp, so we just made a "dry run" on them to scare them (warp scrambling and dropping their shields a little) and then explained to them what they should do differently to be safer.
---
After 6 months of doing all this, playing very casually as an alpha for a couple hours a day, i had 2 billion isk, at which point i stopped playing again for a few months.
---
So it's not your character or your SP, it's your capacity and willingness to learn. I had a starting advantage by being a returning player with nullsec experience, so i could easily survive wormholes on a 2-day old character, but most of the other things i did were competely new to me because i was away from the game for so long. That character was just an experiment to see how well i could do starting from scratch. I had some isk leftover on my old characters but i didn't touch them and didn't fund this "experimental" alt with any of it.
---
I came back to try abyssals a few months after they got introduced. But i had a trading alt with a few hundrer millon in the wallet from back in the day. I realized that instead of taking the risk to run the abyssals myself, i could use my trading alt to just buy and sell the items before the market stabilizes, since the margins at the time were quite big. Like before, i didn't use any of the 2 bil on my exploration alt to fund this alt and kickstart his trading, i played him as a solo character instead. I turned my starting few hundred mil into 10 billion isk in 3 months, on the severely restricted alpha clone skills and extra taxes that alphas get. Granted, it was a grind but it was another experiment.
---
Currently, i can make enough isk to plex 2 accounts each month and still have a few billion leftover for pvp ships. I don't depend on anybody, nobody depends on me and i don't really have to live in nullsec full time to make a living. Granted, it's not a very social way to play the game, but i tend to take frequent breaks so i can't really be in a corp full time.
---
So what's the point of this post? It's not for bragging. It's more like a tutorial presented as a story of what i did and telling you what works.
---
Look around for diverse income streams. If you do the same thing all the time (especially mining and missions), it will take a while to accumulate any serious amount isk. Sure, mine a bit at the start to fund one of your immediate goals (eg, get 10-20 million for a batch of exploration frigates).
---
Set small, attainable goals. This keeps you motivated as you move to the next best thing, and the next and the next after that.
---
Most of all, don't be afraid to try out new things and take risks. Just make sure those risks are calculated. So i'll close with some risk management advice.
---
* Don't put all your eggs in one basket. This includes (but is not limited to) the following:
---
   * Don't put all your isk in a gas huffing venture that might die in a wormhole.
---
   * Don't haul all your belongings in a paper thin tech1 hauler.
---
   * Don't spend everything on a single ship.
---
   * Do use a ship when you have enough isk to buy a second one as replacement.
---
   * Don't sink all your isk in a single market investment.
---
   * Do invest in more than one item in the market. It's very unlikely that everything tanks at the same time, so even if prices drop on a module and you take a loss, you can make it up by your faction ammo sales, and so on.
---
   * Do take a tech1 exploration frig in a low class wormhole (class 1 to class 3) as soon as you have 10-20 million isk to keep replacing it. The ship and fit costs 1-1.5 mil and with a bit of luck can make you anywhere from 20-100 million isk per run, paying for a lot of replacements to keep doing it, even if you die every second trip or so.
---
* If you get lazy you will die.
---
* If you get too greedy you will die. This includes staying online to run "one more" abyssal while you're sleepy, running "one more" relic site and getting caught by a cloaked hunter, or taking that lowsec shortcut through Tama and seeing a gatecamp as soon as you enter the system. It's not a problem at all if you are just traveling or looking for fights in a frigate. It is a big problem if you were carrying your entire livelihood in a tech1 hauler.
---
* Even if you do everything right, from time to time you will still die. Follow the above to make sure the loss is recoverable.
---
* Even if you don't die, you can still lose money. I have lost 1.5 billion isk because i made a typo on market buy orders in 3 separate occasions, 2 of which happened in the span of 3 days. Shrug it off and keep going.
---
* If a deal is too good to be true, it's probably a scam.
---
Have fun :)
---
You missed the point... 
---
The point being that many MMO's have very similar characteristics and play styles. 
---
Space is space.. So a space station is going to look like a spacestation. Even if they made it 90% different, you will still see the 10%... 
---
Spaceships.. now we know some Eve ships look like ships from certain movies and comics.. OR are they just similar with a EVE twist.. or were the devs influenced by what we know to be "space themed"
---
At the end of the day it is like saying that BMW or Mercedes copied each other. Fact is that they went with what the market likes. We the players / hoomans have a certain vision of what space looks like in the future. 
---
Anyway, I hope some of that makes sense..

---

---
Umm sorry, that would be false. Nice propaganda though I guess.
---
Personally, I don't think a lot of things we do in the game were every really intended. A cyno-alt isn't the designed method of movement, it is a thing that you are supposed to have trusted allies help you with and prone to miscommunication, espionage and just plain bad luck (bounce off stations, etc).
---
There was a time when we moved freighters with webs and security escorts... and lost them a lot more often. Maybe Chaos is an overshoot in trying to bring back that type of gameplay, but Eve has been far too safe for far too long.
---
Most of the people I see get ganked in " PVP " are those doing PVE things and not being vigilant or just newbros that don't know better. It is rare to see a group not insta-dock as soon as you enter a system and avoid all conflict. Miners, ratters, whatever... and ratters were using cynos to just drop a Capital on whoever tried to gank them. Blackout at least kept people honest and made them check DScan or have actual intel. Sure, people have gamed the system with bots or pods on gates as someone mentioned, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an attempt to inspire old-school style gameplay.
---
I've never understood why people just farm ISK to farm ISK, and get upset when their boat is rocked. Some of them risk the isk, but others just count the pile and cry about changes that are so far removed from them at that point...
---
Do you really think us Goons want the rorqual online and super umbrella meta?
---
We adapted to this meta because we had to, and we will adapt for this one too just as much, Goons don't want stagnation but any of the changes CCP are installing are driving players away.
---
That we are concerned shouldn't just apply to us, we all should be concerned, especially if someone like Innominate says this, and I value his opinion highly.

Moving jfs in nul and low is very safe. The most dangerous part of JFs is high sec hands down.

Innominate always talks like this, sure he probably gave it a thought but it's not like he's reading it off paper.

I don't think people saw Cyno and Blackout changes coming that far off. I mean, how? You threw darts at a board of crazy-Eve-changes Bingo squares and landed on those?
---
It may "effect" the gameplay of others, but it doesn't make the game unplayable. It makes the super-safe cuddly bubble of nigh-immunity go away... and they have trouble pressing the "Unsub" button through the tears being cried for their ISK-printing enterprise.
---
Faucets have long been a problem anyway, as they do exactly that... print ISK out of nowhere. When you have a chance to lose your stuff while doing risky things, it balances that dynamic. The risk has fallen by the wayside and losses are more rare than they should be. Same goes for WH space and FWPlexing. Just control as many variables as you possibly can, then play the odds. You'd have to be reeeeeeally unlucky to lose out repeatedly.
---
Take away the safety nets, and suddenly people don't want to engage in those activities. If anything, I think that was the very intention of the changes.

People keep complaining because there's not enough conflict in Eve. Why would there be conflict when everyone has enough of everything? Why would anyone risk their expensive stuff on fun fights? This age of abundance has created a generation of risk averse, static empires sitting around doing the same thing day after day.

Two years from now when they're all quitting because they don't enjoy watching the wallet button blink any more and running the same pve content 600 days straight isnt fun, people like me will be here to tell you...

Ok, i'm not sure CCP is really thinking this through properly, i'll give you that. Changes were **urgently** needed, but some of what they did change looks a bit rushed and not very well thought out. It seems like they are trying band-aids to avoid tackling the real issue (citadels, capital rebalancing, asset safety, etc) probably because they fear that the backlash will be even greater than what it is now.
---
But some of you guys from the big blocs have dug yourselves in such a pit over the years, you now have serious credibility issues.
---

"damn bbtb3 makes cringey posts"
---
Get woke go broke?
---
It's cool. 
---
Phobe was kinda the same deal. We went from being a small corp in Stain supported by carrier logistics to needing to either get a JF, move somewhere else, or unsub.
---
I unsubbed, and came back once they iterated to a more reasonable nerf.
---
So basically, CCP will either come up with something more reasonable, or the game will die. Either way, I don't think you'll be missing much if you go ride your bike for awhile or something.
---
&gt; Sub is a cesspit ~~these days~~
---
It hasn't been healthy all year.
---
That's shit that happens during a major war.  Things have been quiet recently as far as major pvp goes, so we sit and moan about the game instead.  It'll bounce back.  Maybe.  I hope.
---
I remember those days and was both the freighter pilot or the webber in turn.  I remember the freedom of getting a carrier when they were still relatively new and how world changing what was.  I still have it too.  That Chimera has seen things.  I used cyno alts back then too.  First rule was don't trust anyone else to do your cynos.   First thing I did was jump her on top of some friends to show off and almost lost her to a roaming gang going through Venal.
---
I was also 13 years younger back then.  I can't cordon off 8 hours to escort freighters down the pipe to keep posses fueled on a war front.  9 times out of 10 there was nothing that happened, or we would have to log the freighters out for 6+ hours until folks hunting us got bored.
---
I couldn't do what I did back then these days.  I don't have the time.  I can't stay awake through the nights of tedium.
---
 I agree in more risk, that's part of what has had the game drifting, but I also appreciate some of what kept it accessible as my free time has diminished and my real life obligations have grown.   I see what they're trying to do, but the side effects suck for some of us.
---
If they'd have timed this with a jump bowhead or some such for example, maybe planned the changes out better?
---
I'm still learning the essentials, so I kind of fly around looking at what everyone is doing either w/ a covert ops cloak or in an interceptor.  I take the occasional rat here and there, set some bookmarks (new to nullsec life), look at how to interact with cynos and jump bridges to be able to travel more efficiently, see what decloaks me, who travels through the region, what sorts of fleets come and go - at this point I either sit on the curb people watching and learning - or I mine bistot.  I find both fun when I'm otherwise super busy with real life.
---
I see a lot of traffic man.  I don't know if it's just where I hang out, I do look at dotlan to see where the action is at - but mainly to avoid it.  I've stuck my neck in some stuff before and promptly lost ships out of noobishness.  Something is always going on somewhere close.  Two nights ago I was coming home and went through a jump gate with an orange goku fleet I didn't know was there - on top of all the people I already ran into in that system.
---
Speaking of cloaks, there are a LOT of cloaked campers in nullsec.  Doesn't matter where I am, what time of day - I can cloak 100yds off an alliance gate and try to report intel on orange/red that comes thru the gate.  I get beat to the punch most of the time from all the other cloaked campers.  Cloaked fleets camping here, cloaked fleets over there.
---
So no - though I only just started playing again weeks ago nullsec seems alive to me at least.
---
It's nothing like eve wtf
---
Fucked up that the objective answer to most of these is "neither"
---
its cute you think im a nullbear, you couldnt be any further from the mark i WAS a pvper. i like how anyone who opposes these changes must be a krab in your mind.
---
Blackout has been coming for a while you must be dumb to have no seen people wanting it.
---
its also a sad state of affairs when a community manager is spitballing ideas that get implented into the game
---
i agree, i think CCP should make some resources regional specific to inspire wars/treaties/invasions/blockades etc.
---
Any AT would be nice at this point.
---
Just because you got brought up in easy mode mechanics doesn't make the rest of us who've been around during the rough beginnings clueless, just more thick skinned and better at dealing with in-game adversity.
---
Now, do you have an actual counter-point to make or is your entire argumentation based on "try to insult it and hope it goes away"?
---
This is more cringe than my OP

you should contribute to that result by just disconnecting yourself from the internet permanently tbh

Make eve completely ftp. I can't believe they still charge $15 a month for what costs $1 or less in storage and processing time.
---
I post on this forum in real life.
---
You make the assumption that i don't consider things like nullification easy mode. Power creep is also real, no contest from me there.
---
I'm just calling them as i see them. The reason i focus on caps is because they scale a bit too well compared to other classes when there's a lot of them on grid and become oppressive, unless you bring more of them (n+1) or your only bring hard counters to them.
---
In other words, the reason half the game only flies stuff like T3Cs and bombers that can pick and choose engagements, mitigate damage with sig/speed tanking and volley caps off the field with enough numbers, is exactly because the other half drops caps en masse on anything that moves. I'd just like to see this disincentivized on both sides of the spectrum, so we could have a bit more variety.
---
You are right, I'll work on fixing it, thanks!
---
Unfortunately, treaties would be the most likely outcome with current mechanics.  Hell, even back in "the good old days" things like OTEC still existed for peaceful resource exploitation.  
---
I really hope CCP flailing around with this chaos stuff sparks something though.
---
Just because they copy mechanics, names, assets or whatever doesn’t mean they’re running the same engine.
---
People are forgetting that time is important, these changes while annoying, just reinforce that the game is becoming more unfun and time consuming. To me personally, I think CCP is trying to help  the game. The reality is that they are tying to achieve this with the laziest dev effort and save money. They don't want to make a fun or creative way to add changes, that or they are going to war against null sec. If CCP actually took the time to make the game fun, I think most of us would be more than happy for changes. Maybe they are taking a conservative approach and trying not to mess with too much, but I don't think they play this game sometimes. 
---
Supers dropping on everything is bad, but making everything cancer isn't a good solution either. Forcing people to inject recons isn't exactly something that will make people feel happy. I remember those industrial roams btw.......
---
I really hope CCP decides to ACTUALLY develop SOMETHING before the game dies. Unfortunately, I have very little hope of that.
---
why's it so blurry
---
It's Dorkness, it could be doctrine tbh.
---
&gt; I mean, Caps have been cancer for a long while
---
See, that's the problem. You believe that just because you think caps are cancer, caps are in fact actually cancer.
---
Well, that like, your opinion, and you are in fact in the (very vocal) minority.
---
Most of us love caps.  We love cap escalations, we love using caps for defense, some people even like krabbing in them.
---
So yeah, honestly, for me, the cyno change was enough for me to take a break for a bit.  I get the intention of the change, and I can see the value in nerfing krab saves, but they basically turned Eve into a game I don't really want to pay for anymore.
---
WTB USTZ
---
This only stands if the only effort you recognize is the effort in getting the ship and the skills trained and getting the necessary logistics in place. Sure, it's effort, but when actually using big ships, it's lower effort than when using smaller classes simply because everything happens much slower.
---
But it's not the only definition of effort just because it's the only one you know. If you had ever flown outnumbered 3 to1 in small ships you'd know the other kind of effort too.
---
So, from where i'm standing, you too want kills for fuck all effort after your initial investment.
---
a sub 2 second atron will do, there is nobody placing bubbles thankfully as the bot menace was extinguished. (via making the game bad enough that nobody wants to bot it because it's no longer "worth" it)

Duh the people who don’t play anymore obviously took the life rafts and then there are the suckers that are riding this thing to the bottom of the sea...

"This would make a really shit reddit post"?

---
I would rather see a "Skilled Fitting" link in chat. You select a hull from the simulation menu, press the Skilled Fitting button which creates a link in chat, and you send it. When others click it, they can fit a ship but limited by your skills, and see what your skills mean to the ship's tank, weapon ranges, dps, etc.   
---
No more stupid 20 minute adjustments to a fit to make it work for the new kid without having a clear picture of what he's capable of until you find out he's 10km short of range for the fleet because his missile skills are shit.

O, content~ Is this a conspiracy of CCPlz who want to bring people back from Vanilla?
---
First of all, EVE doesn't have an issue with attracting new players. Something like 600,000 of them come to the game every year. The issue EVE has is keeping them there, and that has basically nothing to do with the language barrier.
---
&gt;The language issue can't be that hard, £25k per year to someone in each of those nations should solve it.
---
No. Oh no nooo. In a video game of this size with a lexicon that is relatively ubiquitous you would still need a team of professional translators and six figures easily to do the job. But with EVE's lexicon being composed of a decent amount of made-up jargon or words strung together from multiple root words, that's an even tougher and more expensive task. So no.
---
I work with MySQL and various programming languages as a part of my day job, building prototypes for new products and collecting data on existing ones. I had a table with 1.3 million rows of data in it that I made a query on the other day. That's not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but the query took 33.67 seconds to run on my test server because I had forgotten to build an index of the column I had been searching on. When I built the index, the same query completed in milliseconds. SQL can is incredibly fast if you've optimized your query and structured the information in a way that is fast to access and easy for the database engine to optimize. This is a question of the resource cost on the server on CCP's side versus the performance impact on the average client machine. Getting a list of items to be repaired straight from the database might be the better option, or having the client build a list of items that need to be repaired from the list of items it already has might be the better option. It all depends on how the client software and server-side database were put together. Every method has a different resource cost. CPU time, memory, and storage are all limited resources that need to be managed well.

They announced it month ago TIME TO TRAIN A CRUISER TO V and more
---
Its not just these changes though. Its a combination of what has been, is and what is going to be. People just lost hope in the game and CCP. 
---
Mind you, people are not arguing against changes but rather these specific changes. Blackout is massively unbalanced and the cyno changes are way too brutal. And no iteration even though CCP promised fast changes. And more of these broken changes which wont get iterated on are coming. 
---
If you ask me most of the people "quitting" are just taking a break until shit cools down, if it cools down. And the firesales Im talking about are real (in NS on alliance contracts). Im certain this is happening everywhere.
---
One good way to measure it is by the amount of times fleets have to get pinged. Its much more now than before, people simply arent around in the same numbers. The dotlan and MER numbers also back this up, activity has fallen of a cliff. And thats both PvE and PvP.
---
Part of the whining is exactly for the reasons you say. Another part of it is people who want to avoid change to the way they're used to doing things just because it suits them, to the detriment of everything else.
---
Like i already said, i don't think what we got is the best possible outcome, but it's a start. At least they showed willingness to recognize the problem and do something about it, even in the short term (because these hurried solutions do seem like short term band aids).
---
What they need to do now after killing the incessant isk printing is iterate on the changes and adjust for the long-term. A couple of months of blackout, see the metrics and act accordingly. Couple of months after the cyno changes, look at the data and rebalance, etc etc. I know they have a less than stellar track record for being on the ball with regular balance passes, but that's what needs to be done.

You're going out in a 5m ship. If you huff gas, you're bringing back 15m on a bad run. Do not warp to an ordinary site uncloaked. As soon as rats show up on-grid, leave immediately. Watch D-Scan for other players.

Good old sico

Believe it or not, this translation is a master piece which is far more elegant and professional than the original one.

i mean, it WOULD make pirating and privateering a real job if resources were regional specific.   People would camp trade routes
---
You make a lot of good points. I'd completely forgotten to consider nesting containers. Most of the databases I work with at my job are relatively simplistic, even compared to my university database courses. I'll have to think about this some more, see if I can come up with another possible solution!

---
Using them outside a supercap umbrella is nearly a guaranteed death sentence. They don't die enough *under umbrellas*.
---
Do I seriously need to tell a player in a game where the median player age is 32 why posts like these are shitty?
---
If people are posting to honor the memory of a friend, a respected rival, or just someone popular in their favorite hobby, I'm fine with it.
---
If it's someone who sees "ooh look, someone popular died, here's an opportunity to exploit the death for political reasons" then those people are scum.
---
Was a sabrepilot for NC you guys did a good job holding him. Cheers for the frags. Invite us anytime (just not to fleet ;)
---
It wasn't free to play in 2003.
---
"blackout" has always been talked about in the guise of "DELETE LOCAL," etc... but that was players asking for it and always being shot down by the Null people. I can certainly see it mentioned from time to time, but I don't think anyone thought it was going to actually be done until it was nearly upon them.
---
Did I say you were a bear? I don't know you and wouldn't assume.
---
In any case, the changes target issues that arose from them not being nipped in the bud long ago. It has been established as "the way" instead of a mistake that was never corrected.
---
I think trying something &gt; doing nothing, but the shock of them suddenly doing something drastic is too much for those that can't adapt.
---
I'm game for pleasant discourse, but resorting to insults and assumptions is where I get off the train.
---
Enjoy Eve, if you can find a way to do so.
---
Before the blackout it was semi-stomachable
---
Instant intel in the age of tools like near2 was obnoxious and really needed to go. But CCP should have just added a delay on local (like most of us pvp players asked). Without the mass limitations of wormholes total local blackout might be bit too much and and make the meta not fun for even us pvp players. At least I'm not the biggest fan of cloak heavy pvp.
---
I agree with you that it might be too late to get the pvp players back anymore. We've been away for too long. Except if ccp does few really smart moves and pvp gets reaaally fun there might be small hope...
---
Tbh, there aren't a lot of MMO that are healthy right now. 
---
- WoW has been slowly dropping in subs since [WotLK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/), to the point Blizzard had to do [the obvious](https://i.imgur.com/V6gihCo.png).
---
- Guild Wars 2 is in pretty shaky legs right now, with the recent layoffs (~150 people) and the community is pretty salty with the lack of communication from ArenaNet.
---
- Elders Scrolls Online is having problems in a lot of areas, like peformance, builds (ZOS just did a big combat rework which players aren't that happy with) and networking.
---
And that's the big boys. I'm not even counting the countless MMOs releasing that die in a year (Bless Online, anyone?).
---
The only ones that I think are doing fine are FFIV (new expansion is pretty good), WoW Classic (which is cucking all other MMOs) and maybe Runescape? 
---
IMO, is not that EvE is dying, but the whole genre is losing appeal. Young people don't give much of a fuck about it, and the old guard is getting bored/filled with adult problems.
---
It's not the missing local. That I could deal with.
---
It's absolutely the cyno changes. Limit to cruisers or something at least but only 4 ships is silly.
---
It's about time...I've paid for this game so long and I'm ready for something else.
---
It's about stepping away even though I still like parts of EvE. Mostly my alliance.
---
But now it's about letting go.
---
Although not completely shit I'm still compulsively checking here for something exciting to happen.
---
Same deal for me. Newer player and excited for the future of the game, this sub is a cess pool off whiny carebears however.
---
Always happened in Chinese history, competing for the most important resource in New Eden, capsulers,  the domination of Chinese community  and cntz. Of course, being interfered by other super powers.  How familiar the story is!

DARKNESS AAR, of sorts
---
Prior to the Avatar's demise, 3 of us were in TS talking about titans. I myself am a relatively new Erebus pilot, and the one who lost the Avatar was grilling me, telling me that was a mistake and I should have got an Avatar. More tank, the Erebus can't compete, but reminding me how grateful he is that my Erebus will tank for him in a proper titan fight
---
The third corpie in this discussion made the remark that "ya know I kinda wanna undock my titan and look at it for 5 minutes". So we did, the 3 of us. My Erebus and their two Avatars. I even remarked that to avoid any danger of getting warped off is to burn up (Which i was doing), yet he was warped to the Astra after getting a fleet invite and is now a killmail not a ship
---
He isn't upset and i got to kill 3 Hictors in a day for the first time since 2015 so... I mean that doesn't mitigate a titan but yeah
---
GF
---
...also, please move "repackage" away from "reprocess".

Stream highlight, forgot to record inn the background.

Breaking News: CCP Devs are now taking 30 seconds to personally respond to all 5000  customer complaints individually. “Feature launches and bug fixes are still on track,” according to a source speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about CCP’s new restaurant franchise.
---
Yeah, and that's core to the issue. Less new players with time on their hands and more aging players that want stuff to happen faster with less risk when it isn't PVP.
---
I get that, I do. But the gameplay needs to change in order to accommodate faster things and better use of game time. Is this the solution? I dunno, tbh. Trying things isn't always successful, and it isn't like they could blackout or remove Cynos for one Alliance and say "now... how does that make you feel?" :: hmmm, the bees are SOO angry and so many have died ::
---
Back to seriousness, the meta for all of gaming has shifted to faster gameplay and get-in then get-out rounds with quick results. Not sure Eve can duplicate that, but it is what would draw in a newer audience.
---
Most of their recent games (other than WoD) were an FPS, a Fighter Sim in VR then ...? Not sure what the next project will be, but they were also going to do Nova and make another shooter, iirc
---
None of those things were slow and all were trying to move toward the newer audience.
---
IF the new project they are hiring for is fast-paced and gains traction, I can THEN see them packing up Eve and calling it quits. Until then, they need it to fund the next thing unless it starts losing them money.
---
Trust isnt necessary, just dont bury your head in the sand. If you are even a 10% objective you can see that something is wrong. 
---
And this whole thing about changes being so urgently needed, I mean na. Some things have been needed for a while but it wasnt "if we dont change today the game is dead". And so the changes that are supposed to fix this "dire" situation are actually turning out to be far far worse than anything that would have happened if left unchecked.
---
And stop with the asset safety. You remove that and youre gonna see a clusterfuck beyond anything youve experienced so far.
---
i wish i could upvote this guys comment 100 more times
---
It's getting to that time for elo to do his annual flounce.
---
Just in: CCP now inspecting the small penises of EVE player base.
---
“Hopefully” the server loads your info on demand and keeps it in memory. Their server architecture is ginormous so “hopefully” they are doing it the easy way.
---
Oh and just to add, unless I am mistaken at one point all bubble were completely off him and the only thing holding him was the Astra
---
Had that NC fleet showed up perhaps 30s later (given that structure points are time based) he may have gotten away
---
so you can image my heart sink seeing that damn NC fleet show up
---
I am under the under rated comments.
---
i see you didn't google it first
---
It was so casual too when he called for the head shot. "Take out Elo... yeah, let's head-shot Elo." &lt;3
---
That's probably what echoes is going to be, tbh
---
...what?
---
Maybe, but most players that undock do have big balls
---
Im not disappointed. Its got the correct amount of panache:)
---
so black out is here so are the cyno changes. who did they hurt? yes goons lost a little isk making but look at the mer they are still doing fine. 
---
its the little guys who always get fucked trying to nerf the big guys. so the rich get richer and everyone else is fucked
---
See skill injectors and asset safety are bad and all.
---
But that was a hilarious story
---
Dank frag
---
Slowly dying from terrible decision after terrible decision, same as the past 2 years.
---
So you're suggesting everything about eve change for the end result of not changing anything?
---
Oh, if you fly around Delve for any length of time, you'll see various nerds placing bubbles to catch whatever idiots they can.
---
The fun part is seeing what decloaks.

Nothing to do with login events ending right?

Sacrificed 2 sabres, would do it again in a heart beat. Even brought my hg crystal pod with by mistake :&gt;
---
Thats incorrect there was a hic alive that was alternating point / rep between the 4 logi lokis. Sabres primarily were to screen off apostles.
---
If you are going to revert things then you need to buff them, you realise this right?
---
But no damage bonus
---
What? Come on dude.
---
&gt; MacOS users
---
Well there's your problem =)
---
Eve is kill
---
10 polarized bombers are not cheap, though.
---
You are missing the fact that ratting has dropped a ton already? So caps arent really being used as much as you think already. I however am waiting for the isk faucet that is WHs to get nerfed to shit next. Cant complain about faucets without fixing what is becoming the biggest one (if not already) right?
---
I decloaked my last sabre at this exact point and strung out the last 3 bubbles before getting blapped, thank fuck for the hic. I think the hic was Darius?
---
Are you sure? There's a 2 minute gap from 1:09 to 1:11 between the death of Count Scary's Onyx and the NCdotte one
---
In that briefest of moments after Scary died is when this happened, perhaps maybe a 30s window at most, where beside the Astra he would have lived, bc NCdotte showed up at propably 1:10 and by then well, we didnt have the Muninns to deal
---
The real problem is that any changes in 2019 that will make Eve harder will drive players away. If you don't change anything game will slowly die. If you try to fix it by making it harder again it will die faster.
---
Killing it faster is better so people can stop wasting their time.
---
Dont worry, seems they will be nerfing EHP soon enough. If olmeca gets his wish subcaps will be able to alpha titans. But people are surely still gonna fly them. Or play the game.
---
Hey CCP called, they want there tagline back....they need it as an internal Crunch Slogan when shit hits the fan by the end of the year.
---
Are you serious?
---
Hey, that's not bad. The more people living in null, the better
---
You underestimate yourself.
---
Oh you've got me wrong.  I don't want -less- risk.  I haven't done non-pvp gameplay since plex became a thing because the pve gameplay puts me to sleep outside of some of the limited time events.
---
My complaints aren't about risk at all, it's about tedium.  I don't want the instant gratification, but things were really good for a long while there.   I guess, I miss what EvE was.  I miss being able to spend an evening catching up with where the fight is now so I could see people's space ships explode (ours, theirs, don't care really) with my friends.
---
We even used to be able to do an afternoon long low sec run and get a good fight or two out of it with my low sec alt.  These days, it's either a ghost land, massive blob of insanely bored people, or having cap ships dropped on you.  (As an aside, this change won't address that because it was almost always a recon lighting the cyno for a drop anyway.)
---
The good fights have gotten fewer and fewer and the gearing up for them has gotten longer and longer.  This last cyno change just exasperated that last part.
---
You're right about the meta for all gaming.  That's part of why I've kept lingering around EvE for so long (and even still do my eve-radio sets). Instant gratification gaming just isn't as fulfilling.
---
This reminds me of the time when I was trying to scan someone down with an Astero.
---
I forgot to cloak. They found me first.
---
You laugh, but this is all technical analysis people do with with securities charts.
---
agreed.  Gotta make r/eve ~~great~~ stomachable again !
---
This does not need peer review.
---
You weren't the only one who brought the wrong pod
---
Before the cyno changes, if the pilot had a pulse and basic common sense you could instantly teleport an entire support fleet to you. Yeah. It's pretty risk free. Rorquals even have a "hahaha you can't shoot me for 5 minutes" button. Even after the cyno changes, if you're not dumb and don't panic, the chance of you dieing is still less than that of a hauler or mission runner in high sec. 
---
Null sec blocs have become so used to throwing caps at any problem at all that they forget sub capitals can gate to systems. If even a few tackle frigates had warped in with those force recons or had they brought in four or five subcap PvP ships we probably would have been held down and died. 
---
Instead, null blocs and those living in null blocs have become so used to having faxes and super capitals saving them that everyone forgets there is non capital ships capable of killing sub capital fleets. I mean come on, we were eight people. You can't handle eight people? 
---
Also. Be like wormholers. If you want to Krab in a system, close any and all open wormholes. It doesn't take long. If that hole was closed, the likliehood of us rolling another one close to it was extremely low. 
---
If you just want to sit in capitals all day and ignore 95% of what Eve has to offer, good for you. But don't be surprised when a non capital ship comes in, locks you down and kills you.
---
But I don't want to pay repair costs on the ship hull since I can do that for free with modules /s
---
Can you kindly contain the butthurt to the designated butthurt threads and not shit up battle reports please?  There is after at least one designated butthurt thread daily.
---
Thank you.
---
Eve is a tactical space submarine mmo. And that is where it shines. There is no other games like it. Trying to change it into something else doesn't work. Sounds like you haven't really understood how the game works yet.
---
Didn't see the session timer crying about a few seconds of wait time between switching ships while logging in alts to dic with. Didn't lose it thankfully heh
---
It’s already implemented. If you control A repair it does this check for you. This could be solved with a keyboard macro, or probably two lines of code. 
---
After all, isn’t this what everyone does now?  If you bring up the repair window you’re not going to figure out which of the 40 talwars needs repair.
---
Leave goons and roam - space is plentiful
---
Ya, it was a raid/hostage situation. He was shot by the assailants.
---
No, you dont want to pop the rock. If you do everyone else knows its time to move on. You want to leave at least 1 unit so everyone else wastes their cycle and gets practically nothing
---
Jump drive smut drive.
---
A 1.4b and 2.1b (or there abouts) pods were lost by your side that i know of
---
Dunno about us tho never checked
---
I had to lend a travel ceptor to our enyo who was in an Asklepian pod.
---
You give us to much credit, its the one we deserve.
---
No we still had him pointed when the NC. Hics / fleet arrived on grid. Im sure because i was cloaked in a sabre in front of it. Had the munnins kept shooting us instead of pulling range that titan would have lived.   
---
However they decided Munnin &gt; Titan.
---
Sotiyos drop all items for in progress jobs. There was one guy who tried building a Komodo in geminate while Horde was deployed, and the Sotiyo got hit and the Komodo parts all dropped. And unlike how Poses were, they don’t become invincible after you hold sov for so long.
---
*facepalm*
---
Yeah, I should have expected this. Thank you for the heads up!
---
Couldnt they just filter out items in the repair menu that = 100% ? When I select all and hit repair, then it does that exact thing so I think the  best process is to skip that 1 screen and show me only damaged items.
---
I made an extremely bad taste joke on Discord today about a certain Goonswarm diplomat's death, which was offensive even by my standards and even I felt bad after I said it. That's the most that I'm getting to connecting real life politics to a spaceship-themed spreadsheet game.
---
o7 Mattress.
---
Yeah, I really miss those roams.  I don't know.  Blackout seemed like a pretty good idea, but it was just kind of spitballed.  It actually made null-sec more dangerous than wormhole space for small groups which is kind of weird, but *shrug*. 
---
This cyno change was a logistical kick in the teeth for me.   I've always kept my multiple alt accounts subscribed because hey, I might get a weekend free to play once in a while, but now those small windows kind of closed.  
---
Still going to do the Thursday night gigs (well skipping this week) but the accounts are unsubbed.  
---
On a bright note, that's a decent new board game to buy every month from the subscription money.
---
Imagine unironically thinking it is irrelevant, though.
---
Because usually they have no idea what they are talking about as they have next to no knowledge of how wormhole space works.
---
To the average null, F1 monkey spooky space is too spooky and difficult. Also, the recent loss of local chat in null seems to make some of them feel like they know something about wh space since thats pretty much all they knew was different about wormholes.
---
Hard to separate "we're all just eve players" from the huge red "/r/Conservative user" tag I have on you, lol.

If you print the receipt it is.

The hell is this weeby response, gag
---
9999 to go
---
Well, with Vily sucking up to Mittens, you don't need astute AoM leadership, you just need a sucker. :D
---
Yeah he was pointed by one thing, which the titan pilot noted as the Astra. Maybe it was a HIC afterall but that was the closest he got to escaping, which only ratchets up the drama of the moment since there were no bubbles. Still of NC took 30s or 1m longer to arrive in force i think he would have gotten out
---
Obviously did not not happen
---
What a gorgeous way to recruit absolutely no one
---
Damn i was on top of that enyo with backup and disengaged in my Stiletto
---
Even though its not the smartest decision
---
I applaud them for not going with the blue everyone aproach that has killed nullsec
---
Kudos to thsm
---
&gt;IMO, is not that EvE is dying, but the whole genre is losing appeal. Young people don't give much of a fuck about it, and the old guard is getting bored/filled with adult problems.
---
this
---
end thread
---
Ended up gating a dread fleet all the way to range and not use them because for some reason even in 30 minutes this titan didn't get saved.
---
Would do it at 5 in the morning again everyday.
---
&gt;Someone in the past once predited something and it didn't come true, so now 16 years later the predictions of completely different people based on completely different basis can't possibly be correct either!
---
Count the logical fallacies
---
We also had a HIC that came in 2 or 3 minutes before the main fleet and that died a few minutes after we got on grid.
---
Half of those countries dont even have computers or internet, let alone any kind of stable economy where the citizens could afford $15usd a month to play a video game. You know how rich you would be in Argentina rn with $15usd??
---
post feet
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
I keep saying that the changes are rushed and there's a problem. Read better.
---
That doesn't discount the fact that the previous situation was far from ideal. People have been leaving for years, it was just gradual because a lot of them were part of groups that like a challenge and fighting against adversity, until it became almost impossible to do so. The current sudden drop in a short timeframe is simply because the new changes target a somewhat "softer" crowd who won't even try to stick around and fight it out.
---
As for asset safety, it's a big part of what trivializes conquests (the other is endless anomaly spawns and too much minerals). If you guys could loot each others titans by killing keepstars you'd be at each others' throats killing and having fun, instead of posting here all day long.
---
But currently it's more like
---
"Hey, let's kill those guys!"
---
"What for? They won't really lose that much."
---
One of our guy was in a old super pod he probably forgot about (on a subcap character) and died in the process.
---
Nothing of value was lost, if not pride.
---
I fell into the trap of thinking that the blackout would bring solo pvp, so I went all over and surprise surprise, I found jack shit.
---
Solo is dead, space is dead, for an MMO that sells itself on its interactions with players its very lacking in that department.
---
I wouldnt say that the blackout was the sole reason that EVE is going to die, but I would be confident in saying that if anything it is the nail in the coffin (along with the release of WoW Classic)
---
God, do you remember the screeching over Phoebe? I do. I was one of the most vocal haters. But, for some reason I kept playing through it all.
---
Get the fuck out
---
Lost the titan pod before most implants could be pulled i think so fair trade i guess
---
PCU on 9/11 remained the same as day before
---
PROOF that all EVE players HATE AMERICA
---
&gt;Haha, I deliberately did the statistics wrong which means that all statistics ever everywhere are wrong
---
??????????????????????????????????
---
I've seen a few Indian guys already, so...
---
Well a loss is a loss anyway, and this is 2019 eve, a 5b pod is not really a surprise anymore.
---
I have 42 minutes on the timer from landing on grid to the time it died. 1 hour 14 minutes from the ping of initial tackle. Them cyno changes though :&gt;
---
Unless its on random subcaps
---
Those are always fun surprises
---
Translates to basically "moving stuff with just my alts used to be easy, safe and free and now there's risk and it might *gasp*need more than just me, cry".    
---
Basically.
---
I disagree, if it really did shine we would have a lot more people playing the game. In fact, I think that it is one of its fundamental failings and a big reason why new players leave. Where the game shines is the social aspect and the ability to have an impact on a true sandbox environment where almost everything is done for and by other players. If you really think that where Eve shines is clicking in space with a zoomed out camera, while you stare at purple/red/green/grey squares on a screen, than YOU really don't understand the game.
---
Hey, even Tom Brady couldnt win a superbowl if the other 10 teammates are retarded.
---
Yes EVE needs more languages as well, but you know what? CCP doesn't seem to care at all, neither many gamers I know.
---
I'm from Mexico, and I couldn't care less if the game was in spanish, I'd still play it in English.
---
With goon production numbers what do you think they need to import?
---
things not available in goon space (certain t2/t3 products)
---
username checks out
---
I could see that being a solution, and other people have brought it up as well.
---
CCP pls give real fixes m'lady. You're an intelligent man, the solution to a problem is to find the real solutions. So wise.
---
Actually, we obviously don't. If people are under an umbrella they aren't on a PvP roam...
---
Join a corp blue to 60% of eve --&gt; get mad at CCP

Skill up to a procurer. It takes like 3 days and adds like 4x the EHP. Then laugh at Atrons and solo destroyers trying to gank you.
---
Don't let the bitches get you down, +1 for the Warqual meta!

It's actually true, oddly.

Damn it, you're right! I need to redo my maths

Oh. Damn, I’m really uninformed.☹️
---
I met vile rat my first few weeks in eve. Man was a legend. One I wish I could have gotten to know more. Gone but not forgotten. You touched many lives and passed too soon.
---
You brought up, DSM, not me. Here, 26m results. https://i.imgur.com/9LxpB08.png
---
Now get fucked wormhole guy.
---
I agree with deployment.   T2 is only regional based, and they have multiple regions so should be fine.  T3 is wormhole based which they can access if they wanted to, but I'll give you that one if they wanted t3 fleets its easier to source.
---
Deployment would be harder but I think even then they're using cap SMAs to move subcaps.   
---
The only thing I think they'd have to import are region based goods like combat boosters and bling meta modules that are region locked.
---
what incentivizes a supercap pilot to accept a fleet invite from scary space people
---
"oh random pop up box i guess i'll click yes haha"  
---
i don't understand
---
I've advocated for having only anchorable bubbles stop 'ceptors. Hictors doing it makes more sense lore-wise, for sure, but from a gameplay perspective it'd be nice to have a fairly well-defined way that it's easier to prevent someone from entering a system than it is to kill them.
---
I like it how every random idiot and their momma feel themselves rightful to speak on behalf of "majority".
---
let me get this right.
---
players fit cloaks to deal with your fleets they can't fight.
---
you want them to nerf cloaks because
---
you refuse to fit defender missiles to deal with fleets they cant fight
---
:thinking:
---
Yeah, r/Eve is a cess pool of Salty people, great place to trigger a bunch of millennials if you get bored.
---
Skill injectors, lack of experience in a super/tit, not having 4+ year ago experience in buying/moving a super/tit from the opposite side of space and moving from temp pos to temp pos etc yadda.
---
The BIG issue I had back as a alpha was capacitor, practically none of the corp fits even for 'alpas' could actually handle it for longer than 20 seconds.
---
Not affiliated with Legacy at all but I do recognize how hard it is to FC now. Before I used to say shit about FCs who fed and how they were "bads" but then when I actually tried to FC I realized how stressful it is. You have to keep eyes on the enemy fleet, not get baited, watch out for tackle and booshers at any time, watch your fleet's position, call out multiple targets, see if your fleet is getting fucked and you have to get your fleet safe, manual pilot and anchor your fleet to good positions... Imo it's one of the hardest things to do in EVE. When you solo PVP you don't have to worry about all these things, you just manual pilot and shoot whatever's close to you, about to tackle you, or easy to kill.

I made a post about this last year, and all I got was people saying I'm crazy :??
---
positive people are usually the minority.  Dont give up, its my mission to be positive around here and help get more people in the game.   I will give negative people shit in a positive way (you can see me responses)
---
I have to give you the credit, this is an masterpiece of translation.
---
I so hope you're right. My brother says its actually impressively functional. I thought CCP kept saying "nah" when asked about it specifically though.
---
In other words "when i don't want PvP i should be perfectly safe from it".
---
You keep dancing around the point in a lot of circles, but the main theme behind most of your arguments is "there should be certain things that cannot be countered".
---
But if things worked the way you want them to be, then everyone would be doing the exact same thing. Might as well delete all other ship classes from the game and have everyone already injected into a carrier upon character creation. And then what? There's no reason to do anything and it's not a game anymore.
---
Well, touch luck, because that's not how it works. Not just in EvE, but in every single game out there. If there's only one thing to do and no competing variables, it's not a game. And that's not me talking, that's science and mathematics:
---
&gt; A game is defined as a **conflict** involving **gains** and **losses** between two  or more **opponents** who follow formal rules. The study of games belongs to  a branch of mathematics known  as game theory.

Ah, another angry krab
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 is in pretty shaky legs right now, with the recent layoffs (~150 people) and the community is pretty salty with the lack of communication from ArenaNet.
---
Damn, I've been meaning to play that game, I hear it's pretty good.
---
&gt; Elders Scrolls Online is having problems in a lot of areas, like peformance, builds (ZOS just did a big combat rework which players aren't that happy with) and networking.
---
This one, too.
---
most people with a couple of working brain cells can appreciate a good meme or joke without losing their minds over the fact that its insulting to the subject.
---
Doesn't it query the system when it attempts to repair a fully repaired items
---
Can we make a new subreddit?
---
Well I mean... the freighter would get hot dropped almost immediately
---
MUH FWEEDUM?
---
I don't think anyone has used the word classy unironically since 2013 without having some sort of fedora sewn to their scalp.
---
we can downvote all the negativity and be positive together.  Attitudes are contagious.
---
Am an idiot.  I uninstalled eve multiple times.  Reinstalled Mojave.  Finally put a ticket in and they got back surprisingly quick with your fix.  No idea why I didn't uncheck the box to begin with.  I remember seeing it.
---
Would that be the number of Drifter ships who have gone sentient and are playing the game by themselves?

&gt;I logged out.
---
this. this is the way to win at mining.

yup.

Your reddit bot is faulty

you seen it here folks.

Bad bot
---
Second Galaxy works on my HTC One S Android phone, Eve Echoes doesn't.

I think they didnt make kill quotas or something. Its a small corp as you might suspect.
---
after the last jedi...i can't see ww2 bombers without having flashbacks to that horribly illogical movie.
---
You have proof of botting by Mango? If so, file it with CCP. If not, just your whore mouth.
---
[Mine! Mine! Mine!](https://youtu.be/p-3e0EkvIEM?t=3)
---
Also a repaired mod should be auto repacked. Repackaging is a useless step entirely. Just make them stackable (if repaired).
---
Because you need to beg and beg and beg 😂
---
I once got really bored and ganked a venture in 0.5 with an autocannon rifter.
---
So you wanna accuse CCP with PA? what are you? five?

Come to lowsec
---
No. Just have one suitcase character. You dont want any evidence you are there. Containers show on scan. I rolled two rattle snakes in a shattered c5, could do most sites. One ammo/loot truck that never warped to a site. I took loot to it. Jump drives and a cloak. Some days I couldn't rat at all because to many holes. But some days the connector residence rolled the holes and I could spend all day at it. Takes a bit to do c5 sites with two snakes.
---
You aren't allowed to mention him under Texas Law.
---
No dought. Also it would ruin my rating style.  Which is nomad c5.
---
It’s more than likely because the school year is starting up again. It’s not the end of the world.
---
tbh, if they were actually doing things that would actually fix shit, wow classic would not be nearly as much of an issue.
---
Can still jump blops to indy cynos fyi
---
&gt;EVE lost 50% of its active player count in the last 2 months
---
Unprovable with the data we have.
---
The rolling average number of logged in users is down 50%. There is a significant difference.
---
&gt; nobody had the foresight to realize this would be an issue?
---
you mean like most of nullsec that were simply called carebears and to HTFU?
---
just because its better? lol
---
usually, this is when number start picking up
---
Except in the movie Fletcher at least had a coherent idea of the end result he was trying to get.

This sub on the other hand...
---
So do you get a percentage of the ore if you cycle your miners off halfway through? I always assumed you just got nothing, but never tested it
---
really still ahrd to catch a 2s align ceptor
---
If the two Id personally recommend GW2. 
---
I think you can now jump into the base game free of charge.  It’s not perfect, I was on board the “no trinity” hype when it launched, but in hind sight it was a bad way to go. One WvW was figured out a lot of the fun died too. 
---
they take risks, they do innovative stuff with the game, and their art style and story telling is one of the best out there today. 
---
Other games should(and have) take notice of what GW2 does. There are some gems in that game that need to become industry standards. Fractals(dungeons with scalable difficulty), their mount system, armor, dyes, zone wide meta events. There’s a lot to take note of.
---
All that said....I’m playing WoW Classic mostly right now.
---
Simple Farmers do it all day every day in SV5 in Catch. Those boys have it down to a science. Got a 1.7 sec align Ares of mine last year. But the old Svipul worked well.
---
True
---
Intel Report: Hull tanked Sigils spotted in low sec and near Null choke points.
---
Did the bots really matter though?
---
We had a perfectly functioning game even with them. Attacking botting by killing playstyles that people enjoyed isn't the answer to making the game better.

---
Wtf look at playercount around 11;00 eve is dying!
---
Perhaps there "Bounty Hunters" as you describe, but I do not know them. What is more common are independent groups ( pirates!! ) being paid to actively harass another group. Or, they just aren't paid and just interested in hunting the capital PVE ships of a specific group. There is money to be made there if they successfully loot the wrecks of other players they create.
---
The biggest example is Elo Knight's corporation which, iirc, are paid by FRT to fight for them.
---
Or hust have someone else in your mega coalition light the cyno? It’s not like every cap pilot needs his own cyno right?
---
That may be true for one or two accounts, but CCP seem intent on forcing everybody *not* in Goons to have a dedicated alt for every little task. Pretty soon they'll stop selling accounts individually and just start selling them in sets of 4.
---
Unless of course you expect them to play in high-sec, which isn't exactly going to entice people to stick around.
---
All and all I don't mind the blackout. It hasn't really impacted the way I play the game.
---
However, it's made the game much less social. People aren't talking in local, I'm making less friends. 
---
The other day during an entosis fleet we were getting harassed by a guy multiboxing hectates, it wasn't until 30 or 45 minutes into his harassment that I finally caught his name (was never on grid with him until that point). Turns out he's an old friend!
---
So I messaged him and caught up, it was awesome. But at the same time it was so strange to be playing a game with an old friend, with recognizable names, and not know that they're your opponent. 
---
The game just feels far more lonely now without local. And for a game that is largely a social game, it seems an odd design trait to reduce the social element. 
---
I understand and agree that local chat gave out far too much information. I just miss making friends with random people in local without having to first run into them at a gate or an anom.
---
it's never been THIS BAD before. you don't have the csm dropping hints about their concern for the game right after the summit. you usually see an increase in numbers right about now... but not this year... now its slowly declining, on a week by week basis
---
&gt; In other words "when i don't want PvP i should be perfectly safe from it".
---
not even remotely - but if you aren't willing to put in a bit of effort you sure as shit don't deserve the kills.
---
you can't complain your disposable frigates can't kill the biggest most expensive ships in the game - i mean, you can, nothing stops you asking for effortless free kills but it makes you sound like a retarded moron.
---
&gt;Your ChAoS that you have been implementing has been great!
---
the PCU agrees.
---
OK, overlooking the blatant stupidity (racism?) of the second sentence...
---
There are plenty of non-English speaking communities in EVE already. Many Russian communities are very strong, and we've got plenty of Chinese communities as well. They don't seem to have much trouble playing the game despite not even sharing an alphabet.
---
I still can't believe CCP made such a premature decision
---
things to improve
---
literally everything.
---
other than updating your skill queue it has about 0 other features.
---
What's Pearl Abyss?
---
Wait... EVERY one of CCP's customers is complaining at the same time?!
---
Agreed. This subreddit is fucking pathetic. Adapt and overcome. Sad.
---
Agreed 100%
---
&gt; What does THAT kind of negativity do for growing the community and player base?
---
growing?
---
fucking best lol i've had all week.
---
Oh well. Guess you should fuck off from this subreddit as well.
---
Update: 2003 skinny CCP Falcon’s MySpace page briefly taken down to remove incorrect HTML markup.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
As someone who’s never played WoW before, what’s the appeal of Classic?
---
I played last night and everything was fine after the September patch, then they did a day 1 patch to the patch today and my game is unplayable. Anyone else having something like this happen? Basically what it looks like is EVE tries to access a folder that doesn't exist (yes I've reinstalled) and launch my account from information supposedly stored in \~/Library/Application Support/Eve Online/p\_drive/Local Settings/Application Data/CCP/EVE/Shared Cache//wine/bin/wine (playing on a mac, which is technically supported but mac still runs it through wine because ccp doesn't actually support macOS they just claim they do to look nice on the steam page)
---
I've also tried removing the account and re-adding but I think I'll just have to wait on day 2 patch once they realize what they've done :(
---
It does shine if you are into tactical space submarines. But the joke is that there are not many players on this planet who are interested in that kind of niche game.
---
Changing the game to make it more appealing to masses would most likely destroy it. You can make your own game if you are not interested in this one.
---
I get where you’re coming from, but it really is better to leave real life politics out of shitty excel simulators.
---
We do that, mate. However there's a definite feeling of being alone is space now, even when you consciously know there are other people around. - Out of sight, out of mind, as they say.
---
There are also often groups of people living together who don't necessarily share comms. Down in Provi it's not uncommon for several alliances to be working in the same system. Not to mention the neutrals that used to live with us in NRDS space. None of those groups will be sitting on the same comms as me on a day-to-day basis. They have their own.
---
I have done, just as I have with egregious characters in other coalitions (including my own).
---
Thanks for exhibiting more of your cretinous infantilism here on /r/eve. I needed a chuckle.
---
It doesn’t hold your hand like modern WoW.
---
To be fair, small communities tend to focus on individual members more than large communities. It's easier to hide in a crowd than in an empty room.
---
second galaxy is nothing like eve its just an appetizer for the real thing. It gives me the eve fix while I'm at work or away from the computer. 
---
PS: its laggy as hell
---
What do you expect, all except 1 of Darkness active FC's left with Kenshin when they joined Init, there is literally nobody left to actually do the saving. 
---
There are plenty of supposedly strategic FCs, although most of them wouldnt have even taken 1 fleet out in the last 6 months. 
---
Counting the days until my corp gets out of here
---
CCP's reasons weren't exactly great tho. Basically: "We don't have any good ideas so: chaos, bitches! Lets throw some shit at the walls and see what sticks!"
---
New and obsessed as well. Hell, I'm 6 months in and just downloaded an audio "Empires of Eve" copy. 
---
This sub has really been getting me down a bit though, despite the blast I'm having in the game. I believe the vitreol to be a substantially negative influence on retention and recruiting. It's actually hurting the game. You all say CCP is at fault. Nonsense. You fucks whining and bitching all day on easily the most public Eve forum on the internet are really what's driving any such decline in numbers. 
---
My advice to those that come here to say things like "I've unsubbed all my accounts - thanks CCP": fuck right off this Reddit sub as well.
---
The people leaving now were the people who probably would’ve left in 2018 but decided to be patient and stuck it out, then got fed up with the new changes. This is not the first year that PCU is declining after small changes and it will hopefully not be the last.
---
Nobody's gonna stop saving rorqs just because they have to spend an extra 300mil on a cyno lol. Your entire comment is a gigantic overreaction tbh.
---
Elo Flight ?
---
Guild Wars 2 didn't just do its genre well, it advanced it in pretty much every way. I played years ago, but it was stellar when I did. I was so very happy with just about everything.
---
Unfortunately it seems like more and more of our null brothers are just now speaking up and telling us that they finally see?
---
O7
---
i’d love to hear some rage audio
---
Blackout it is then
---
Fleelo
---
&gt; limited time events
---
Honestly why don’t we just have those all the time (they don’t have to give OP drops just something around 50 mil) and make people compete to get the treasure at the end? One of my most memorable times in the game was snatching up someone else’s loot in a Rogue Drone Site and flying off before they could catch me. Unlike Abyssal pvp, they won’t be limited by player location so newbies can do them too.
---
Mmmmm salty
---
Ore yes, ice no.
---
&gt;This sub has really been getting me down a bit though
---
Eh give it a bit. The subreddit goes in waves.
---
Triglavian invasions/abyssal deadspace might be up your alley
---
"For the first time, a Jita isk-doubler had ignored the United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights. Since Erotica 1 is a member of CODEdot and there were many wardecs active, Erotica 1 was arguably guilty of violating the Geneva Convention. "
---
lol
---
how can you kill that which has no life
---
A bunch of whiny cunts torpedoing their own game on the most visible eve forum available with a parade of unfunny memes and pseudointellectual commentary about how CCP Hilmar is destroying everything. All while stating they've unsubbed all 50 accounts they have yet are still lurking on the forum for the game they apparently quit because things became too hard. 
---
If you can get past that and actually undock the game kicks ass. I came in just before blackout and saw the change happen and love it. The cyno changes in particular are also wonderful for new players. Helps limit the playing field by preventing ships from simply cap dropping when they get into trouble. Actually forces some social interaction, planning, and trust to be successful rather than relying on a win button.
---
He was out of bubbles and only held by the Astra when I got on grid with the first NC Sabre and had to suicide to rebubble him at zero.
---
It was touch and go until we got a few more guys on grid to lock the tackle down again.
---
Both are pretty good. If you're a new player, you'll still have hundreds of hours worth of content. Most of the complaints is from veterans regarding the endgame and it's suport from the devs. 
---
Take Gw2 for example. There is a mode I usually play called World vs. World (WvW) where your server fights another 2 in a weekly matchup. It's probably the best big scale PvP from all the traditional MMOs. But it's pretty much forgotten by ArenaNet, with like 1~2 guys handling fixes/exploits, and that's it. The meta is pretty much the same since ~2017, gold per hour is inferior to almost all other options and when it's updated, if for something incredible odd that wasn't even a priority (a special mount). It's like Eve's low-sec.
---
Well, at least until 2 weeks ago, when Anet said they would change some things. Time will tell if this will revitalize it since they don't have the best track record of following their promises (one of the changes they want to implement has been "in the works" since 2016, IIRC).
---
But yeah, like the other guy said, the game is pretty damn good. Combat is satisfying (best one from all MMOs I played), their interation of quests is much better than the standard one and the community is friendly. You'll like it.
---
why did he hit you to hard? =P
---
Good project, keep at it. But why German? It is really weird seeing something programming related that isn't English.
---
Mine would not launch even after I disabled it. I am redownloading right now.
---
nah i just like shitposting on stainguy posts
---
Like complaining about the taste while filling ya face
---
A one fleet pony.
---
They were at one point iirc
---
Was it the Goon ticker that triggered you?
---
its a small percentage of people that make the most noise.  Welcome back to the game... Its the best game EVER made and only getting better
---
You mean motorcycle? 😃
---
And hilmar is op to balance eve when he only plays the part of the game he’s buffing?
---
be part of the solution and not part of the problem. I know negativity is contagious, but please dont jump on the negativity bandwagon and DONT EVER shit on new bros or people coming back to the game.
---
10/10 AAR and it didn’t matter between racial choices, clearly the one with the brain works
---
It's so my friends (who I mostly made this for) don't get confused
---
lol the mental gymnastics are claiming that because we raised an army of AFK miners over the last three years and now those are taking a break while the AFK mining meta settles with the added 300mil tax on cynos and spoopy local the game is dying
---
I mean.  It’s more that we made then quit and the bots moved to hisec/alpha pod alts.
---
Big issues tbh
---
Pythons GUI frameworks are all notoriously shit. You might be able to extend this into a web app using flask / Django in the future if you wanted. 
---
Not to do anything hardcore, it’s just miles easier to work with.
---
There’s actually an extremely easy method of doing it that isn’t resource intensive in the least. So that logic doesn’t work.
---
why he would cheat like he did in the past.
---
I ran into it a couple weeks ago when i setup the launcher up on my macbook, enabled 64bit and bam, wine error. Same error came up this time.
---
You can kinda write async code. The GIL still limits you to 1 thread. So you can’t get purely async/multi threaded code like you can in a more dedicated performance language.
---
&gt;or taking that lowsec shortcut through Tama and seeing a gatecamp as soon as you enter the system.
---
Why do people actually take shortcuts through Tama? Doesn't everybody know that Tama is for killing, not for hauling?
---
I admire how well CCP went for broke in the pants-on-head retarded category; pun intended.
---
At least I can say, "I was there!"
---
Good riddance if anyone really quit over spoopy local and 300mil cyno tax in their home space where they can ping for support and get 100 supers and caps around the clock. Think we just got overwhelmed listening to angry tantrums tbh.
---
It's also summer. Still.
---
3miles is nothing in space, since a projectile fired in one direction will keep flying forever. And some ships are longer than 3 miles. I think all caps that is . Dunno about BS ..
---
You're right. Popular releases of blockbuster titles have never happened before.
---
Hmm ty for the recommendation I’ll look into it!
---
Now, if they only deleted all the pesky players, the universe could go back to being a vast expanse of tranquility.
---
I tried it and couldn't get past 50. Some of it is interesting but I didn't really see any end game potential. ESO I couldn't even make it to 10.
---
CONCORD provides a great umbrella. Under the protection of the DED branch of Concord, you will pretty much never be hunted by cloaky T3C's. You should check out their space.
---
&gt; filled with adult problems.
---
Well if Walgreens would just start stocking Metamucil again I could get enough fiber without having to drive all the way out to Target, which would honestly do my hemorrhoids a favor so I could spend more of my sitting time on EVE!
---
Test just refuse to admit the fact that their rental pets are botting. Anyway, won't blame them for not roaming in Feythabolis and Omist.
---
Hmm, 3 years since your last post (did you resub your reddit alt just for this)?
---
I think with all the bloody nerds capitals have had since then ita only right refitting comes back.  But minus any fax and if you fit a triage module it cancels everything else.  You cant be both
---
But when I quit I thought weekends were up above 40k, though I could be wrong and maybe it was just 24k or some such.
---
How are you lagging? Eve has 1/4 of its players left :)
---
Good for you, but a lot of people didn't.
---
Well.  You’ll get your wish looking at the absolutely plummeting player count
---
Indeed, unfortunate that "chaos" has become a synonym for a rather prolonged yawn.
---
and they will .. nom nom nom
---
I have an example.
---
You can generally make quite a bit more isk in an hour than you'll lose in ships as long as you fly cheaply
---
As I said as soon as the new AFK meta forms they'll be back.
---
You can't expect from people who can't handle having to work with other people or whose most advanced defence is warping off when a neut enters local to be sticking around to pioneer the meta.
---
good riddance when you quit again because it gets too hard for you
---
Emphasis on again
---
Nice gank friendos. I guess nobody manned the fort?
---
goodbye friend, can i have your stuff?
---
Sure, but this is still looking at it purely from an engineers perspective. That a closer 1:1 representation is best.
---
But the reality is that users are frustrated by that.
---
Front loading, while technically giving a less accurate picture makes users feel better about the wait, because the way humans view time isn't very in line with reality.
---
They understand
---
They just don’t care.  They’re the most sheltered playstyle and they cannot play well with others
---
It was a lot of jf pilots complaining about needing to train alts into bombers.
---
Yes, a capital industrial ship.
---
Haha nice.
---
Not really the same things, considering the length of time skill training takes and the fact you don't sit there watching it tick down.
---
&gt;~player count~
---
Character count. Ftfy
---
Uh.  It, as a minority
---
Shouldn’t punish everyone else and push ideas that fuck everyone else
---
Yes it’s a corner.  But as you said, it’s a minority.  You don’t burn down a city to pray there’s enough debris to build shelters for the homeless
---
At least they are doing shit unlike a lot of eve right now. Who gives a fuck about losing anymore.
---
If I were a woman evaluating EVE megacoalitions, I'd probably join the one that pointlessly drew attention to my gender before I even apped up. Mhm.
---
It was then ccp lost 3/4 of the players
---
Fuck that I love slurpies
---
OMG stop adapting, how many times does the Mittani have to tell you that the game is dying!
---
You can download highlights from Twitch in max quality with some websites out there.
---
Covert ops cloak on interceptors?   
---
Inties can use normal cloaks.  There's no way other than pure luck that you will be caught.
---
I spent a good year exploring null in cloaky Ishtar ninja running sites.  I took a Rokh cloaky and circumnavigated the null map.  
---
No way you need cov ops inties
---
Newp.
---
Man, I love ESO, I have easily dunked over 700 hours in that game. And I don't have any of those dlc, besides the morrowind and still not finished (only the main story). So much more to discover. No regrets buying that game and I'm thinking about buying the Elsweyr dlc.
---
Not even that since one guy logged in for 10 hours and 5 guys logged in for 2 hours each but not overlapping is counted exactly the same.
---
Because space is empty? Gosh... people these days.
---
New player here and I can only agree in everything you said. r/EVE: Stop being 15. 
---
Seriously
---
Wat
---
tbh eve hasn't been "healthy" for over 10 years
---
I'll do for you dw
---
600k new players,.....didn't know it was that high, depressing thinking about all that lost talent, you need an imagination to play Eve, maybe CCP should go in that direction during the tutorial.
---
So you have no evidence of it using EVEs engine?
---
Earrape warning woulda been nice.
---
Why not hold it in single query ? If you press the repair all button then the query should more like this 
---
"SELECT xyz FROM assets WHERE
---
 OWNER = abc AND location = abc AND itemHP &lt; 100"
---
ISK/hr from anoms is constant, and is injected directly into your wallet.  
---
 ISK/hr from missions, abyssals, and DEDs fluctuate. The more people who run them, the lower the isk/hr drops. Also, there is a lot of risk involved in transporting all these goods around. You can get ganked before even getting to your market while carrying all your loot and get absolutely nothing for all those hours of PvEing.
---
I haven't played this game in about three years now. Played a decade. Ran a corp, ran an alliance, fc'd everything from duo roams to 20v600 to 500v500 fights, lived in null and lsec, farmed incursions, wh's and industry, made almost a trillion isk, bought two titans, lost one. Point is, i tried almost everything the game had to offer, as long as it was pvp or supporting my pvp habits.
---
I been lurking this sub ever since. As the chaos era began, i even rised an eyebrow, that should i return.
---
However yor reply made me realize that i e'nt returning anywhere as long as r/eve is my main source of eve news. Thus i shall unsubscribe from this sub now and we will see, if that makes a difference. If nothing else, it'll reduce negativity and bad mood from my everyday life and that can't be all bad, now can it?
---
Well it's why we anti-locals were always asking for region or const local not a complete blackout.
---
Why would you put the higher magnitude number second?
---
That's like say 001 is one hundred.
---
Nonsensical.
---
But why? Like if you know that this is the case you will just drop a can with fuel on gate and park your interdictor next to it.               
---
In the battle you will refuel it from other ships that will need to carry it.       
---
Whats the point of creating annoying mechanic.
---
Heck Yea!!!! Need more propaganda on r/eve   
---
Makes me wanna become a brave newb !
---
Dont you have standing fleets that show who is online? dont have have ingame chats full of these same people?
---
Dont you have mumble/teamspeak 
---
IDK what to tell you but the bubble is poped and we have to adapt or just stop playing.... I am haveing loads of fun... I am also doing things i have never done before in the 14 years i have been playing because of these changes... so i guess its not all bad... + have have had to make more and new spredsheets... #liveingthedream
---
This relates to your server ping and quite probably some client modification that will activate the point instant new ship is detected.
---
Most endgame is in PvP . I also havent played for years anymore, but battlegrounds and faction/server battles were enjoyable
---
But but... it´s BRAVE.
---
why is this downvoted
---
How many start to bleed players just after unwanted changes?
---
So your a miner and your whanting to drop a triage to save your rorqual... join an allaince.
---
Have you played bdo?
---
Silly muricans trying to do everything differently from normal people.
---
&gt; after post-patch
---
Chinese alliance other than Fraternity.
---
actually no.         
---
If you had sub running and resubed just before the blackout in 2 weeks you will have the option to resub again or quit.     
---
If you didn't subbed just before blackout announcement your sub expired already and you will stop login.           
---
So what we see now.
---
So everyone is supposed to ask everyone else where they are and what they are doing so every spy in the corp knows. Cause getting intel is too hard otherwise.
---
or was it the 5th of December?
---
Ouch.
---
Meet Dave, Dave's a crabass cunt.
---
Initially i started to make a bigger graph with Wednesday each month to show up the trend, but decided to go with a single day as it is simply more visible.
---
lol after you spend some time in the dark you begin to rely less on the eyes and start 'seeing' more with your elbows.
---
You'll learn to discern activity based on other signs pretty soon :)
---
Bounty hunting was effectively killed when they removed the ability to track standing changes on a players info and then the ability to see when players were online. So you could see someone losing standings with Guristas every day in a particular system, and see that they were online.
---
The End of Eve is here ... And it's name is called "Second Galaxy"!
---
No simply end of 2019 is just one big holidays so no one is playing
---
&lt;3
---
And/or we should be able to cmick on a repair all button
---
Or have a ranking from the most damaged to the lowest....
---
Only seen you guys screeching past 2 months tbh.
---
Or become a woman. You can do that in 2019 if you want.
---
ow look, the daily "eve is dying guys look at numbers on eve-offline"
---
Mining was a semi afk activity, super ratting very much not. Both risk substantial amounts of isk. Incursion running is a low APM activity with much less risk and higher isk/hour. Multi boxxing burner missions is painful, triple boxxing abyssals not so much. Ultimately null players are either going to quit null or migrate to high sec.
---
What you don't understand is the impact on players. I don't know what your favourite activity is, but imagine if it was removed and the 30b+ of assetts and 2-3 years of training and subscription payments you had invested into that activity suddenly became all for nothing. As much as you lack empathy, I can very much see why that would hurt and I think CCP is beginning to see it in lost players. Falcon posted yesterday about the balance having shifted too far in the wrong direction and i suspect history will show my comments in a more favourable light than yours as changes are made to redress the lopsided balance introduced by the blackout and cyno changes.
---
you can fit them some nanoplates and get some logi to rep them *shrug*
---
lmao its not jumping on the negativity bandwagon to point out literal wrong statements.
---
Don’t pause podcasts/music in the background when you start the app. Especially when music and effects are turned off..
---
It would be really nice if you could at least check the status/notifications of indy stuffs. Sends you notifications when your research, manufacturing, and reactions finish. Also send you notifications when your PI extractors go offline, or if you have full storage, ect. 
---
I dont think they should add the ability to modify your indy stuffs, but at least send you a notification and be able to check how much time you have remaining on indy would be super awesome.
---
And are any of those mechanics in Eve? 
---
  And don't give me a crystal ball "prediction"- People have never been accurate when it comes to "CCP WILL ENACT GOLD AMMO"
---
Mail needs a unread only filter like every good mail client on mobile has .. don’t you guys have phones?
---
so the state of the game is such that feeding is the best one can hope for at this point, that says a lot.
---
Still not very good. I can see this fit work but only on explorers and t1 t1 frigs in fw. Not on battlecruisers alone. A fleet of these however could do okay.
---
Grath - you are an asset to EVE - I respect you a lot and im gonna come wreck shit with you someday soon
---
so how did this work, do you just invite a titan to fleet and hope it accepts?
---
umm no
---
That was extra hard screeching. Being top is a given. But still bring top with minimal reduction whilst almost all other regions dropped by 50% or more is funny.
---
Done
---
I know, but i cannot edit the title
---
\[anecdotal evidence of said content missing in the game\]
---
\[some sentences that can be summarized as DAE\]
---
are you denying me my libertays?
---
You obviously don't do anything that is effected negatively by these changes lol.
---
Its one of those 'Oh look, the game just got more annoying/tedious and I've got nothing in return, why keep playing?'
---
supers can yea - at least jump freighters - theres a dude doing it on youtube. 
---
now freighters, tanked ones, with logi support, will be harder to kill and with the new cyno changes it would be harder to drop caps on them I guess. We ll see how it unfolds
---
None of that sounds fun at all lol.
---
It doesnt use the eve engine though, it uses unity.
---
But like how often do you really speak to people in local as opposed to via TeamSpeak, Discord, etc etc
---
&gt;Is this the solution? I dunno, tbh. Trying things isn't always successful,
---
The problem is that in true CCP fashion, literally nothing is going to be iterated on.
---
So if you don't like version one of the patch they pushed out, there is no reason to stick around because it isn't getting changed anytime soon.
---
They haven't killed the incessant isk printing. The best isk continues to be found in High Sec and Wormholes.
---
I would want to also remind you that 1 tanked freighter is about 5 dsts, which are way harder to catch and much more mobile, can pass through c1s etc. 
---
when it comes to importing ore, 5 porps are also the rquivalent of a freighter and they can pass frigate holes too. 
---
might be that logistics for a nullsec corp might be actually interesting and not just a side job :)
---
Can you stop. This is incredibly off topic. I am replying to a dude who is doubting if he should return to the game because of shitposters like you.   
---
And then you burst in like an elephant in the china shop, just because i had the audacity to point out that it doesn't matter what people on this sub post.  
---
If you have the desire to play the game, then play the game. Then the dude can decide for himself if he likes the changes or not.  
---
It is as if you guys actually want the game to die with your cringey ass attitude on this sub.
---
Why do I feel like even if CCP changed it to 5min delayed local people would still be bitching? Somebody would come up with something to whine about.
---
I'm not here to lie to people.
---
Shits not growing, dude.
---
Don't you get bored of following me around reddit? You're worse than that old wormhole Corp mate that used to follow me around here.
---
My pods are formatted already to fit
---
Oh dam. I just uninstalled it and it's busy re-downloading all the files. Thought I'd check reddit in the mean time and see this!
---
Yes. Because every ~~VNI~~ Myrmidon in null could just ping for their super umbrella to come save them at any time. There's no one ratting in null not under a super umbrella.
---
Oh wait, you're a fucking idiot.
---
I wish the locator agents would update the info they provide. 
---
like o get you cant tell the wh systems the target is in but at least say "we lost track of him in ..." so people can track. 
---
you know "last seen on, in system x" 
---
I would want to run these things then, as you said. Otherwise it s super hard to track a person down.
---
I'll do you one better, what is code?
---
So the best solution is complain and whine on reddit?  Or is it better to help new bro's come in the game and usher the next generation of PVP Bros that are excited about the game?  With all the constant negativity on reddit, this is a serious question?
---
Because if enough people say 'eve is dead' and CCP sees their player base start to panic, they might start working a little harder to make the game better.
---
Exactly, it just keeps working :)
---
FC what is a standing fleet?
---
I'm just trolling mate haha :P
---
Fact a are facts, I simply corrected an error.
---
You seem pretty mad about that. Why is that?
---
Ah that sucks lmao
---
Our channel name has changed too anyways since you were there I think....it's TAABE Public now. 
---
ALSO YOU CAN BACK UP YOUR SETTINGS
---
I finally got so sick of losing my settings all the time that I made a permanent backup saved in an external HD. It was absolutely worth it. You should look into it lmao
---
also trying to keep 40-100 ACTIVE people into a single wh is gonna impose some mass limits too, i think.
---
Buy plex and stick it on a character somewhere in hope the game might get revitalized.
---
The alternative is to rmt it, but thats not super worth.
---
Darkness are dieing and it wont be long until they are gone, Sort is sitting on his hands and looks like he is ignoring the inevitable, its been coming for months, lost around 1000 members since the end of may, they have no fcs and no active players to join fleets even if they had the fcs to take them out! slyce getting booted hurt darkness bigtime, and when kenshin bailed the writing was on the wall! Only a matter of time before they are no more,
---
As was explicitly stated in the patch notes, btw. Read them maybe?
---
Have you ever seen your rorq or super dropped by bombers bar? Seen your titan explode having spent 18 months training up to and saving isk for it? Jumped multiple caps into a fight you know you are losing, but you do so anyway because friends on the field? That harsh punishing playstyle is there, it's just the big fights don't happen as much anymore. The entire reason I farm isk is purely in wait for the next big cap escalation, that's what a lot of null players thrive on.
---
The solution for me isn't to change isk generation, the best isk is in null/wormholes, it's to introduce more massive sinks to counter the faucets. Perhaps introduce a new dread, carrier and titan only purchaseable with isk. See how quickly null will unfuck itself in terms of liquid isk wealth. Incentivise more capital escalations so more titans die, it's what null players want.
---
Higher cap drain?
---
You're a cum guzzling cockernaught! I fucked your mum. 
---
I read the patch notes. Some people didnt. It was an FYI. Not a TIL.
---
I am in alliance and I still need a fax, but now I need a recon. Is it so hard to grasp?
---
Why do you think make the game more tedious and annoying would be a good chance?
---
You need some type of ship that can just get you somewhere without hassle.
---
Otherwise, nobody will ever leave their home systems because gatecamps would be set up on literally every funnel system.
---
My point wasnt that eve will become a bdo copy but what to expect from the new owners in terms of their mindset towards their games and communications.
---
I played *RuneScape* in 2008. Despite the Goonswarm propaganda that you keep spouting, this is nothing. I have experience with an actual situation when the devs screwed up the game in a crusade against botting and RMT.
---
A handful of the billion they have? Well that totally contradicts what I said obviously.
---
I dont see any reason to post EVE offline pictures 5x time a day, complain about everything, and shit on people constantly.  I would like to see this subreddit return to a place where people can come an inquire about the game, ask about mechanics w/o being told their game style is shit, where people can post awesome propaganda, and where people at war can gloat about conquests.   I will always welcome new bro's and help people discover this awesome game.
---
Jam the dreads lul.
---
It makes more dangerous for everyone to move caps, and now if I encounter a small group I know they probably cannot open up a cyno immediately, or if they do it is prolly a force recon who is immediately primaried.
---
I submitted a lengthy feedback thorough the app with a bunch of ideas. Then I realized that CCP isn't trying to release the best app for everything, they just have to release features not possible with just the public API. Otherwise they'd be effectively trying to kill 3rd party development.
---
Cannot agree more.
---
I have been playing for over 11 Years now and honestly the amount of crying, doom and gloom posts in the last 6 months has just made r/EVE really look pathetic. People are going on as if the game is about to just stop working or CCP announced they turning the servers off in a year.
---
This game is not going anywhere. It has outlasted almost every MMO so far and honestly for ever cry baby we lose I say good. Good because we get old hardcore vets back that want to shoot faces and will teach the next hard core group to shoot faces.
---
I am very happy you enjoying the game.
---
Yeah, this. I didn't (and still don't) see the appeal behind ESO. What's the idea behind that game?
---
I like citadels. I own one just for somewhere to call home. I know how to use my Overview in Perimeter. I have no problems with citadels.
---
Awesome ! This game is better because of pilots like you !
---
&gt;Its one of those 'Oh look, the game just got more annoying/tedious and I've got nothing in return, why keep playing?'
---
Yep, that's roughly where I am right now.
---
Ccp just seem intent on making it as obtuse as possible to do things for no real reason.
---
Rad ! Welcome to EVE !!!  Enjoy this Awesome game.  If you ever need advice, my IGN is the same
---
&gt; The biggest example is Elo Knight's corporation which, iirc, are paid by FRT to fight for them.
---
Wouldn't that make them mercs instead?
---
Ayyyy feels good to be corroborated
---
Come back !  The PVP is better than ever before.  This sub is full of people that complain because NS is no longer safe and the roaming fleets are better than ever before.
---
Bounty hunting was never alive in the first place, what's with existence of alts, friends and jump clones.
---
Why the fuck do you guys accept random fleet invites?
---
He probably thought it was one of his 2 fellow titans.  
---
But yeah. better look twice in a big toy.
---
people stopped roaming after rorq changes.
---
the rorq got more (loads) of people interested in mining, which meant hours upon hours of not roaming or gatecamping.
---
which led to those who dont rorq mine to not have anything to fight, camp or even mates to fly with.
---
rorqual changes destroyed eve of old.
---
&gt;Young people don't give much of a fuck about it, and the old guard is getting bored/filled with adult problems
---
Still ccp insists on improving the new player experience, and punishes the old guard.
---
&gt;What does THAT kind of negativity do for growing the community and player base
---
You do realize that back when the pcu was at it's peak eve was so utterly negative towards new players(starting from game mechanics and finishing with the olders player attitude) that what we have today pales in comparaison?
---
&gt;I dont see any reason to post EVE offline pictures 5x time a day,
---
To illustrate how well received the recent changes are. To explain why space is beginning to feel emptier. There are a myriad of reasons.
---
&gt;I will always welcome new bro's and help people discover this awesome game
---
Me too, I just don't lie to them either.
---
This is why we have Jabber/Slack/Discord/IRC, no? You can see if those guys are online even if they're not in your system.
---
lol, wasnt wow when it was first release the most hand-holding of all games?
---
I dont feel alone in Provi. Theres always plenty of reds on D-Scan. :p
---
It also needs a playerbases that is mature enough to not scream its own head off at just the announcement of some changes without even letting them settle to see what really happens.
---
1 million EHP impel - 500k ehp blops - FAX + Umbrella. done
---
my mistake 'imawormholerbtw' pilot #12
---
Bye, have a good time!
---
Try zooming out and include the total time eve has been available, this graph will give you a better idea of what is going on.
---
Make luxury yachts the main travel method and gimp ceptors? Yachts can't kill anything.
---
Close but a bit more abstract, everything in eve is an item, so there is just a single table containing everything in the universe , so it’s more like 
---
Item_id, location_id , owner_id , type_id, qty(-1 singletons) , flags.
---
and it is true it get more complicated with containers as they have a location_id of the station and flags for hangar, but every item in it has the location of the container.
---
Then there are multiple tables for singletons to look up against to find additional data. Types that are dogmatic( our attribute system ) and are Singleton will have a line in dogma_instances, which will store information like damage, is it online etc.
---
Blueprints will link to another table and abyssal items to yet another.
---
However to the original question, the client should know the state of all items in the hangar(sans containers) as that information is primed when you dock
---
EVE's had a slow, insidious cancer for a while. It looks sick right now because it just completed 2 rounds of high intensity chemotherapy. It'll be a little frail for a while, but it'll come out of this a better and healthier game.
---
I wonder how many people naturally went to WoW Classic and how many people are taking a temporary break to try and force CCP to do some reverts, and how much is part of the decline that's been happening over the past few years since citadel release.
---
not bad idea. i mean it should be simple knowledge to CCP devs, but probably isnt.
---
but why post here instead of sending it to them.
---
It was written this week, far after AOM chose Legacy and Omist as their home. The difference between Mangos and FRT, is they actually hold to their agreements and have good leadership.
---
This subreddit shits on people trying to come back to the game a lot.  I am not attacking you, i am calling out the constant negativity. I've roamed NS for years, in many regions it was mostly intel bots, ratting bots or ppl that docked as soon as you entered local.  Its always felt empty/lonely in NS, just because you saw a name in chat doesn't mean someone is actually there.. common lets talk real
---
CCP Hilmar was quoted saying something like this some weeks ago: "It is heartbreaking to witness that of approximately 600,000 new players who tried Eve during the last year only a few thousands kept playing for more than a week or so."
---
This is IMO the crux of the challenge CCP faces ATM:
---
How to make new players stay and become regular Eve players?
---
My guess is that new players don't care about the blackout, they don't care about cyno changes, or visual appearance of WHs, for obvious reasons...
---
They care about what it takes to get into the game, my guess is that the way the skill training works, especially how incredibly time consuming it is, disheartens most new players. 
---
Additionally, the amount of immersion one gets from looking at the ship one is flying from the outside, may come across as quite shallow and unimpressive to a young, new player in 2019. I think new ships which utilises first person view is one way to address the latter. 
---
I love Eve, btw. It is the hardest and most unforgiving game I have ever played. But I have played it off and on since 2005 and, so to speak, is a minority.
---
Let the doom and gloom continue.
---
Currently playing  eve classics or stelaris. 
---
Blackout is boring.
---
Citadel timers are boring. 
---
Sov toasting is boring. 
---
Eve is boring in the current state
---
If that is the case...   why not give change a chance or do you think negativity should be the norm here?
---
because drifting is a thing. you can be facing your vector, be at full speed, and not warp.
---
to make this bar not follow exact data pulled from the actual speed of your ship is silly.
---
if the progress bar moved on time estimation it would suck ass. as it would be ovious it did so. im surprised CCP didnt do this tbh
---
I always wondered why people need more than 1-2 account and what they do with 6 accounts?
---
settle down, dino.
---
I wonder how many people are just taking a break while the changes settle? I imagine it would be easier to come back to a new way of life in eve after balance is restored rather than be a pioneer developing it.
---
have your tactical view open.
---
theres a blue direction arrow, when the blue direction arrow points along the line of the warp to line created when you click something. you hit warp. its had that for years
---
Where the hell is the option for 32/64 bit in the mac launcher, i can't find it anywhere.
---
I don't think you fully appreciate how poorly built the back end of EVE Online really is.
---
﻿
---
your slow ships are drifting, stop your ship to a 40-50% speed then click warp. its not the progress bar causing this, just you now noticing how many bad habits you have.
---
the faster ships that insta warp. maybe they need to speed up the maximum possible progress on the bar. time will fix that
---
This. And Ansiblex gates / capital ships just mean people take less gates in general. And when they do, they bounce off a spammed perch citadel.
---
I used to love gate camping because it was an easy way to provoke a response fleet but nowadays you rarely see more than a few newbies who dont know better.
---
We have also had the speed with the little tick for years, doesn't mean that the behavior wouldn't be useful to newer players, or hell sometimes me. There can be a lot of visual noise sometimes.
---
speed with a little tick?
---
I can assure you, factually, there are less things blowing up since blackout started.
---
Come to Provi. Local shittalk is alive and well.
---
Remember, small alliance's are DEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAADDDDDD! /s
---
Once again thank you very much sir! 
---
I really appreciate the time and will you took to explain this to me. 
---
Each time I am amazed at how people in the EVE community help to new members like me. This game sometimes it too overwhelming with it's complexity.
---
Well nothing to prove you're correct.  It's not content creators as such it's just FCs.  Every fight in eve relies in the constant need for active FCs, then the need for people to have fleets everyday.  When you have one or 2 main FCs the  burn out happens and alliances die.  We've seen it alot. 
---
AAA
---
PL
---
NC.
---
etc etc all have been hit by that. How many alliances have died when FCs go AFK.
---
The fact is alliances and FC egos choose 1 or 2 people and that's it they dont train enough upcoming FCs and the players only want to fly with the good FCs anyway.  Bit chicken and egg
---
It's more about space just feeling populated, you can fly 100 jumps and not even realize other people play the game.
---
And running across people that you know was just cool whether they are in the same alliance or not.
---
&gt;i am calling out the constant negativity
---
Then may be ccp should give us something to be positive about?
---
School year, wow classic, aging player base, stagnation since citadel release...
---
I do not care about fighting or interacting with your six alts. Begone thot.
---
Kind of agree that it could be worst, but cannot deny the fact that CCP is making eve so annoying that people quit. 
---
A lot of people
---
this is an awesome game, with awesome content, with awesome players, with awesome graphics, in a great sandbox... They recently upgraded a ton of little things, graphics, 64bit graphics. new ships, etc..   
---
I have a ton of reasons to be positive.  Dont buy into the negativity
---
imo it's not nullification that's the problem. It's the combination of nullification with insta-warp or cloak. Make it so insta-warp isnt a thing any more and cloaking disables nullification and I think you'd see a return to gate camping (and lots of people crying because their zero effort travel got changed -- see cyno changes).
---
Because this is my best way to do this.
---
Hello?
---
Is there anybody in there?
---
Just nod if you can hear me
---
Is there anyone at home?
---
Come on now
---
I hear you're feeling down
---
Well I can ease your pain
---
Get you on your feet again
---
Relax
---
I'll need some information first
---
Just the basic facts
---
Can you show me where it hurts?
---
T2 inventable Dictor bubble that catches nullified ships but not non nullified ones. Make it a choice.
---
Sure.
---
That could be a potential thing.
---
Though there is still plenty to do in EVE that isn't affected by the changes at all.
---
I liked this dread
---
ENJOY TYPING
---
WITH
---
YOUR HANDS!!!!!!!!!!
---
^ Exhibit A
---
Yeah and we still do (as much as friggin hate having to use out of game apps to play a game correctly, but that's rant for another time). Right now and at over the last few weeks alot of them don't even log in anymore.
---
It's not really a WoW classic, or back to school, or any of those other reason people keep saying, many of them don't log in because direction of the game and feel betrayed by CCP, and it's just more rewarding to play other games at the moment.
---
The group I like to play with aren't just mass super building, 15 rorq piloting, afk ratting cancer in the game like I feel like this subreddits interpretation on null block players are. We would do ratting together, do exploration, dive WH, roam capitals, roam subcaps, run abbysal sites. Most of agreed that the issues that face the game need to be addressed, and I totally see that alot of them have been fixed, but it was done so wrecklessly and what feels like disrespectfully (spent years training skills we will barely use anymore)
---
And I probably could totally find a group do all those things, but it's just depressing to lose a group you have had great memories with. (Like your XBL buddy that said see you tomorrow night but hasn't logged in in 7 years)
---
Hopefully it's just a summer slump, but that's how all this has been affecting what I enjoy about the game.
---
The solution is not to rely on people to act against their own best interest but to balance resources in the game such that fighting over them is in your best interest.
---
Make anoms moons and rats deplete based on the rate of farming them similar to PI and only replenish 3-6 months later for example. 
---
Just like reasonable taxes are better than relying on charity you can't rely on a few great people to create content in EVE out of the kindness of their hearts. It's always better to have a rewarding system for content creators.
---
We've given change a chanche since 2015-2016 and we're plummeting. Mae it s time to go back to the tested old ways.
---
I think you missed his point he wasn't bitching about geting ganked he was pointing out the toxicity that's slowly killing the game just as much as any change ccp could do.
---
I will hand it to you,  this is a good post
---
''Manual Pilotting here is Key, so watch me manually fly directly towards this brutix, and let him get away from me.''
---
I think youll be surprised how much better just overheating your AB, going into prop mode and burning around would do compared to loosing your orbit on him.
---
cruisers however like omen navys seem to be too fast for this and is where you need to be able to manually pilot an orbit behind them, while still going fast enough to keep up, your dual rep dual cap booster no web tanks alot, (not much more than a single rep fit well)
---
 Would like to see that 500k ehp blops
---
Toxicity exists in any online game. The only counter is surrounding yourself with friends and EVE is great at that for the reasons I gave - loss matters and hence friends matter. If you want to play EVE solo you have to also be your own grief counselling whether it's about losing the ship or the shit talking in local after.
---
wouldnt you just, friends only snigg
---
PI alts ($$$$$$)
---
Invention alts
---
Production alts
---
Mining alts
---
bots and people multiboxing 10x rorq's are plummeting and thats a good thing.  I've seen nothing but great people enjoying the game for the last couple months and plenty of my friends have come back to the game.  I guess we can agree we disagree.
---
Most of you are missing the point it seems he's not whining about geting ganked he's pointing out how toxic half the community is with reddit being the greatest hive of scum and villainy.
---
can't wait  for eve to "die" if by dying means quite a few of the current subscribers move to another game like Wow classic. Null sec people have become a cancer to this game and i really wouldn't mind at all if ccp displeased them to the point that they quit. So we could have some fresh new blood coming in indoctrinated in a different fashion
---
Well Cyno changes don't explain everything. They could have fucking pinged the FAX, brought more people in subcap, etc.
---
Even in our lowest TZ we have way more people than that, and we are way fewer members that them.
---
It's lore is very well done compared to other games, with storytelling and voice actors..but the game is too easy. It's even easier when you hit max level instead of harder. Makes no sense
---
&gt;with awesome content
---
If that were true, the pcu wouldn't be falling off a cliff.
---
&gt;level 2
---
Honestly the game is fantastic. The changes are what are needed and CCP are not stupid. The game feels exciting again for me. I just wish that the other cry babies would piss off. They seem to be so but hurt.
---
Well sort had it coming, you cannot backstab people every 5 min to get keep your dying alliance alive and expect to stay afloat.
---
If only Brave Newbies was still a newbie corp.
---
That's true but it doesn't justify someone being an ass for no reason. That's life i know that'a why humans suck.
---
Agreed
---
Same tbh. Region local would be a good halfway point.
---
I been thinkin on it a lot. But am afraid it en't  that simple. Ya know all the talks of eve is dying. Well, I think it en't dying for itself, however my eve did die.
---
Other big reason is, that i got so used to play it hardcore I en't able to play it causally. Nowdays mi life is filled with other pleasant things aswell, so the time investment en't possible. I also always played in the very edge of meta. Thousands of hours in eft theorycrafting the last bit of edge i can find to beat the numerically superior enemies. Now there are just too much new ships and modules. The damage control was a active module when i last played. The barghest was the newest ship. Or maybe it was command dessies. Cant remember..
---
bots and multiboxing carebears are falling off, content creators are coming back in waves. We can agree we disagree i guess.
---
&gt; Nothing will really change, its just more tedious.
---
Many people don't want tedious, which is seen in the sharp drop in toons online since the ~~chaos~~ insanity from Hilmar began with some dream where Eve talked to him. He literally said that on PC Gamer. The man is unhinged and PA should carry him out in a straightjacket before none of us have a game to log in to.
---
How about you uninstall the game and do us all a favour. You clearly are bitter to the point of being spat out. Just HTFU or Fuck off
---
PanFam and WC FC's are wonderful tacticians however not the same can be said for strategy.  They are woefully inept when it comes to strategy.
---
Maybe you have to rethink this post... i´m thinking because of some toxic behaivor he got mad in the first place! And every one knows where it all ended! So wouldn´t be the solution to ask ppl in here to be less toxic?
---
I was getting long load times undocking , stargates, restarted the computer and all good, seems to happen if i leave it on overnight.
---
You can get a widow to 1.8 million ehp.
---
well, i keep an alpha in faction warfare just to shoot things and have fun. You can always do that casually.  Glad you are still hanging around and have a good attitude.   EVE isnt dying and tons of awesome content creators are coming back.
---
Ummm who?
---
Learning something new every day. Does the cruiser have to eject manually? Does it matter in terms of invuln or the time it takes the Orca to scoop it?
---
Yep, that's pretty much what Echoes is.
---
It's not the same New Eden though. not Tranquility.
---
the faster you unsub and piss off the better the game will become. Please do it fast
---
:tinfoilhat:
---
If this is the posting quality of Co2 than what the Judge did to you was a favor.
---
Lmao it's like you don't realise that there is plenty of wealth in India and parts of Africa. Tech support is specifically outsourced to India because they don't have PC's. Nice one.
---
+1 been playing EVE since 2005. I can't get my head around the hysteria. 
---
Speaking only for my corp/alliance and where we live: the game is fine. We get plenty of fights, I have lots of dudes to talk to, our activity as a group is on the uptick by all measures (ex. # active players, # kills, # characters, # dudes on teamspeak &amp; discord). 
---
Looks more like people want to generate hysteria to revert things back to 'how they were'.
---
&gt;Aside from that, these people in these countries spend more time on basic survival needs and I’d suggest don’t have time to sit staring at a computer screen 12+ hours a day.
---
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, do you?
---
**BYYYYYYYEEEEEE**
---
No
---
Just as they don't want their linemembers losing ships in the transition their line-members don't want to pioneer the new save meta. 
---
It's completely reasonable to wait a week use it to practice saves on SiSi etc.
---
All are pretty unaffected by changes so far; or effects can be mitigated.
---
Boring people are bored. You're boring.
---
&gt;I'm a simple man
---
You got that bit right.
---
Only because I'm bored
---
Listening to Hilmar, he understands more about psychology than you do.
---
&gt;More bots got banned, nothing of value was lost.
---
Do you genuinely believe this is all bots? 
---
It's wilful ignorance at this point, holy fuck
---
Most narcissist do.
---
&gt; i guess we can agree we disagree.
---
Then, factually, show it
---
Player online drop started before cyno patch - honestly the best thing you can do now is to unsub your super for 2-3 months if there is no reason for PVP in it so you can wait and observe what is happening around. What new hunting methods are being implemented and how to protect your heavy assets.         
---
To many unknowns to be "dumb" and go in blind.             
---
       
---
Like remember that times have changed **new super and titan hulls are not something you will get easily quite soon**            
---
While people are still selling cheap supers and titans, materials needed to build a new titan went up from 35bil to almost 50bil already, and this is just start.
---
proof that eve is copy?
---
And you have proof that PA is going to do this? Or is it all heresay and rumour?
---
The free RMT cocaine is too good. He'll be around awhile this round.
---
I 100% agree with you !  Thank you for posting !
---
The genre is only losing appeal because the devs are focusing on whales and microtransactions instead of making actual good games.  Stuff like Classic's launch and even FF14 (which isn't as popular as it could be because of the anime aesthetic) should show there are a lot of gamers that want a good MMO, there just...isn't much to choose from.  There's old neglected games, WoW, and WoW clones basically.
---
Well its 1080p and not blurry for me weird
---
And what did the previously large number of players with double that in characters did for the game?.....
---
If only numbers could make this game fun it 'd awesome , but they can't , it takes a) certain game mechanics b) gamers mentality,  for this game to be organic, balanced and fun  and for the past 2-3 years that has eclipsed. 
---
One can only wish that ccp tries to improve the game mechanics , and either gamers change their attitude ar altogether quit.
---
Sadly it's reached this point, but it is what it is and no fine tuning method will succeed. 
---
the Chaos Era might be exactly what the game needs right now
---
This is CCP we are taking about. Attempting to repair what is working, at the cost of not noticing what is actually broken, is kind of their thing.
---
Maybe you posted it before YouTube finished processing it. It takes the videos playtime on average for all the quality options to be available.
---
It's not bitter to correct errors, my friend.
---
you mean shield. shield power relays,shield extender and field purgers
---
&gt;I’ve been thoroughly enjoying the blackout
---
Me too! I'm Level 17 now and went Deadmines for the first time in a Decade again. Was really fun.
---
I think it would be great if you could basically do everything except “stuff which requires you to undock” through the app.
---
Exactly this. I remember that it used to be that if a ratter got tackled a defence fleet would form (might take a minute or two but whatever) and would come and try to save whoever you'd got tackled. Now you either get nothing or you get dropped by a load of carriers.
---
GW2 was decent, but the "no tanks/healers" things turns off a ton of MMO players as it really puts a ceiling on PVE, while the skill system is so dumbed down compared to GW1 that it really hurts the PVP.  It's a good game to play now and again, but not one that's going to keep most people hooked long term.
---
Nope it was out for  10 hours before hand
---
Add a function to participate on the forums through the app.
---
The fun fleet invites you mean.
---
Oh, I know. Phoebe cost me more friends by far than Blackout. Worst game design choice ever: “we don’t actually want you to play Eve. We want you to do nothing at all for hours or days on end.”
---
Good call!
---
Yes, it's still super casual compared to games like old school EQ, but its not retard-roll like every modern MMO (which is a large part of why the "genre is dying", devs are too focused on MTX and welfare loot to make actually engaging games)
---
&gt; Also Gobbins in particulary, is member of CSM who should help devs, but instead he uses his influence in Horde, causing people to not log in, and therefore affecting statistics and possible CCP desigions at the same time, as well as directly harming CCP income in some amount. Same can be told about GoonSwarm CSM members as well.
---
I suggest you send yoru head toward a wall with a certain amount of velocity to create an impact big enough to remove your stupidity out of here.
---
It gave the game PLAYERS. which is what makes mmorpgs successful
---
Dumbass, that is common sense for anything ever.  Business, more customers, good
---
It isn’t rocket science
---
Chuckle this comment made me. Upvote I bestow.
---
A-FUCKING-MEN
---
To me, CCP should see every third party app as a big glaring sign that something is sorely missing in Eve. It’s absurd to me that it took so long to add a ship-fitting tool to Eve.
---
The biggest thing Hilmtard overlooks is how TERRIBLE EVE's PVE is.  You can call EVE a PVP game all you want, but PVE is REQUIRED to do anything, and a LOT of MMO players like good PVE.  If there was actual engaging, fun PVE so it wasn't AIDS to farm ISK, a lot more people would play and the PVP would naturally come.
---
I want super umbrellas to fight super umbrellas.  More death of supers means more goes into and out of the economy. 
---
Frigate spam online isn’t fun for anyone except people who already enjoyed frigates.
---
I can mine enough to make about 400,000 frigates in a day.  That isn’t balanced or sustainable or fun for anyone to make that the STRONNGEST form of warfare as long as you have pilots (or bots) to pvp with them. 
---
Period.
---
No, the main point is people wanting to start conflicts for the sake of having fun or making enemies and not playing house of cards online.
---
My favorite wiiiinnnneeeee is tequila
---
Where do you see him complaining? He just explained a simple concept lol.
---
No, "they want their players back", because you know players who just rat and drop titans on small gangs are the core of their alliance right now.
---
The whole chaos era thing could have been handle about 20 times better (will be looking for the CSM minutes about that) but it's a pretty good sign of how much NS players where just there to rat and maybe frop caps once every 6 months in a big "war".
---
You don't really play this game, do you?
---
Just to humour you, I'll bite. Dreads can't be jammed. Now you'll say, dropping dreads is dangerous since you can be countered. Given how many dreadbombs happen with the attacker just moon-walking that won't happen very often.
---
Now regarding the rest of your EWAR idea, EWAR generally has terrible DPS. So let's say you go with jams, the attacker can still not fight the support fleet, since the amount of EWAR needed to effectively fight them will mean the support lacks the DPS to kill them. And even then they can just wait for you to fail a jam since RNG and keep killing your freighter.
---
So you'd need such a support fleet for each freighter which is usually used to haul larger volume, lower value stuff, that people will stop doing that after 2, maybe 3 times. So good job, you've found a way to empower large blocs. Since they will probably be the ones able to get enough people together to make this work.
---
Your suggestion regarding 'just stopping null sec logistics' is too uninformed to even respond to.
---
So.
---
They’re docking up the biggest targets.
---
Not losing them
---
Not being “dangerrreous” with them
---
Not letting”ChAoS” cause losses
---
And you think this is healthy???????
---
You actually think that when devs are feeding T2 BPOs to their alliance members and overlooking RMT from certain individuals, that they aren't also making design decisions based around the conversations they're having with the players they interact with (to keep them happy and proliferate their communal play style)?
---
That aside, CCP has always lacked good management, which is why EVE has also lacked a consistent source of visionary leadership (for a long time - maybe not at the start). I would bet there isn't a single person in their office today that could tell you where they want the game to be in 12 months, never mind 5 years. Whether that actually happens is irrelevant - the fact that you have that person steering the ship is one of the most critical things a creative project can have. Instead we have years spent on balancing (which could actually be made a lot easier with changes to the core game mechanics) and a whole host of features that either get forgotten about, left behind, deleted or endlessly revisited to try and fix them.
---
i mean, without using officer mods, highest ive seen was 500kehp without these shield slave things..... bravo for going higher (1.8million i highly doubt though lol)
---
Tfw there are more meaningful statistics to an online mmorpg than people playing said mmorpg
---
That’s some SERIOUS ego to assume that if people are having fun “they’re doing it wrong”
---
Why specifically did the mats go up?
---
Its too late for rollback. First thing they should do was to improve new player experience and then try to fix end-game. They have nothing to offer for new people, and they made 90% of old players mad.
---
Next year you will have total F2P with more monetization. 
---
Game is colapsing just like Hilmar said he wants to kill it fast before it goes down naturally.
---
The issue is people aren’t building them.  Why invest in the blueprints and skills and effort when they’re being gutted when everyone and their mentally incapable cousins are flying frigates?  
---
You can’t even sell what you mine because this meta is so easily proliferated it isn’t funny.
---
If something is cheaper than everything else, more effective than almost everything else, and the one thing it can’t beat is getting nerfed ito the fucking ground.  Then that thing will be abused forever
---
Your paranoid. This isn't being done to screw with CCP. It's being done so they can real-world test their cyno adaptation without throwing supers away.
---
The Rorquals are essentially being used as test subjects to see how their tactics work. Both because they are cheaper and because they are tanky enough to survive if somebody screws up in the first few days. 
---
After they get the hang of it, then it becomes time to get the supers out again.
---
ships are easy, infact, i often go to trade hub, buy up a whoe bunch, ship them to where i fight, and re ship time after time after time for hours until i cant go anymore.
---
Lots of eve players have died. Vile rat gets a spotlight however. 99% has never met him or spoken to him.
---
that is not gonna happen, ever. People prefer to lose keepstars their space and all their assets than risk losing their super fleet. If an entity knows it is outnumbered, they are not gonna risk it for the biscuit. The only 2 instances that this happened was a) from mannys mistake and ncpl thinking goons didnt have balls b) from a staged fight that most thought server cannot sustain itself but it did and a lot of titans died in that keepstar siege in the north. Since then how many super fights have you seen
---
I joined eve for supercapital production and warfare.  It was so cool to me... and many others that had joined with me.
---
I guess CCP thinks it’s wrong to have fun and enjoy building big things ina fucking spaceship simulator sandbox mmorpg
---
&gt;Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want?
---
Local
---
&gt;Do you want the game the way it was in May?
---
In may we were camped by cloaky bombers. Was still more fun than blackout.
---
&gt;Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely?
---
Life in NPC0.0, so no Umbrella
---
&gt;Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel?
---
A bit of a loaded question, but yes.
---
&gt;What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities.
---
Can't really remember the last time I did L4's/Mined so I'll just say 0.
---
&gt;When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly 
---
Before Blackout, duh
---
&gt;and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.
---
I look his KB, if he's a soloplayer i look with what ship to engage him (if I can find the motivation to undock).
---
&gt;How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.
---
0 Times.
---
&gt;And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.
---
Longer than it will now.
---
Well i appreciate the changes until the cyno changes.. No i dont mindmy rorqs ain't got a cyno anymore or my supers run around without one.. But onlya allowing 2 (T2) ship types to carry a cyno is stupid as fuck.. Thanks god wow classic is out and i dont have to care about this mess for a couple months..
---
agreed, perhaps it was too sudden, perhaps there could be other things that would bring down empires efficiency in a different way (like esi removal), but again all i can see right now is people quitting over the danger of losing their ship
---
it would seem, the only grumpy bitters on this reddit are those saying this reddits full of grumpy old bitters. LOL
---
look at you too u/benzh
---
Welcome to a forever issue
---
“ play the game a different way” ... it’s easier to play a different game.
---
“harden the fuck up” is swallowing the love you had for something and seeking to love something else when it spits in your face
---
That’s life
---
Oh boy make a blue donut required for people to rat and mine.
---
Brilliant. Because people definitely will fight instead of work together like they ALWAYS have
---
GigX made a wrong decision and he should and is feeling the consequences of that.
---
That being said, I'm so confused regarding most of these posts. First, there are/were/will be many more content creators than just GigX. So saying Eve stagnated cause GigX got banned is wildly exaggerated.
---
Second, what is stopping you from going out and doing just what he did?
---
tbh i see more an industrialcyno-&gt;blopscyno-&gt;fax abuse than anything. If you are talking about the logistic side i see how it can be a pain, although once you set the route you should be kinda ok. That said, ccp has been screaming for years make stuff locally.
---
Yeah, people are just spiteunsubbing.
---
at least you are honest, kudos
---
&gt;"The cyno changes will not affect big umbrellas at all they only hurt small groups"
---
But I'm excited to see what people come up with to work around the cyno restrictions.
---
And what evidence do you have that Hilmar has NPD?
---
Maybe back before the changes. Not anymore
---
Carebearing
---
Did you just hallucinate while reading my comment? Yes there's more meaningful statistics than logged in characters lol. No I didn't say that having fun is bad.
---
&gt;The solution is not to rely on people to act against their own best interest   
---
You seem to have a general perception issue. There are indeed people playing in this game whose goal isn't being the biggest hypercrab with the fullest pockets. Some people enjoy fighting. Some people enjoy battles where the stakes are high that aren't limited by NIPs, NAPSs, or however you want to call it. And for these people building the safest krab empire where noone can bother them isn't their best interest.
---
The point of resources being scarce is to break up the doughnut by making the pieces fight each other over resources when one of them runs out. How did you get "blue doughnut" out of "remove infinite resources" is beyond me. Currently nobody has any incentive to change from the space they own to new space because anoms and moons respawn forever.
---
&gt; I look his KB, if he's a soloplayer i look with what ship to engage him (if I can find the motivation to undock).
---
"I undock in the perfect counter or not at all"
---
Yea, sure, nothing was wrong with game play in EVE before all these radical changes.
---
&gt;CCP Hilmar: Downloading the character model client side improved NPR by 35%. When we worked with reddit to get /r/eve banned, NPR improved by 80%. It turns out the game is fine, but the players who post on forums are garbage.
---
What's funny is it was all the PVPers that where complaining about turbo crabs and miners but what now that all of there targets don't even log in to the game anymore it was people like omecca that destroyed the game and skill injectors and that's coming from someone that used to super rat to fund my pvp its sad to see eve dying but it was good while it lasted i killed over 6 trillion isk and made some great friends il be Provi 4 life and im proud to say that i played this great game for 10 years its sad to see what CCP have done with blackout and cyno changes it drove me away i was content and happy before the changes now just sad and moving on
---
You're the type of player EVE needs. Please stick around. Things are going to get real exciting here in a minute.
---
I wanted to be able to tell if i was wasting time in a region without having to spend 5 minutes a system scanning every corner or having to fuck ass about with the shitty ingame map when looking for fights. I also quite liked not being resigned to a boring cloaky bullshit meta to get anything done.
---
This is something i hate about the game.  But the only solution is a group willing to scorch keepstars at any cost nonstop.
---
And nobody has the balls or the apathetic zkill mentality
---
Obviously there's people who do things for fun or the good of the game. What I'm saying is you can't RELY on them and it's better to make what's good for the game also be what's good for those people.
---
Are you dumb?
---
People logging into the game is the BASE of it staying alive
---
Period. 
---
If nobody does the game is dead
---
If many people do it lives and thrives
---
They won’t
---
Like i said before pa is the owner.
---
&gt;ft or imploded in the
---
if everyone joins Goons, who are you going to fight with? Concord?
---
Even as it is, it's bad. Goonswarm Federation is bigger than it should for the health of the game. 
---
EVE Online is PVP centered, so, I really think that your alliance is 70% filled with offline accounts and the active people are either ratting and making money without a goal or are bored out of their minds. Indeed, all the respect to your capital umbrella, you protect your space as an alliance (sort of, head you loose shit tone of rorqs), but you as an individual... need to go in a hole different part of space for any type of action. This is the main reason I don't want to join Goons or other big alliances.
---
1% of all EVE players is still a lot, and whether you knew him or not he had a huge impact on all of nullsec.
---
He also gets the spotlight because of the circumstance of his death : he was *killed* a few minutes after sending his last message to EVE players. Of course that's going to leave a mark on all of us.
---
&gt; ... **for a change** 
---
Title promises a change. Then goes on to be just one more *"I love blackout/cHaOs"* thread. Very disappointing.
---
He was extremely well known in game. I never interacted with him personally but if you played in his era and were any sort of mover or shaker in sovereign nullsec, you had dealt with him.
---
Even though I never spoke to the man personally I feel at least as close to him as I do to some of the traditional celebrities that have died in recent times.
---
But once more anyone that seeks to exploit his death for IRL political purposes can go and drink bleach.
---
What people do when logged in gives you more information than how many people are idling in station lol holy shit how hard is it to get that through XD
---
This is probably the 8th time youve posted this
---
Just trying to be the voice of reason.
---
If you have the isk, get the firesales now. They're everywhere. Then again, at this rate of player decline and unsubs, I'm not sure it will matter in a year. We're at Defcon 1 with a mentally unstable CEO who literally told PC Gamer that Eve talked to him in a dream and that's why he moved forward with "ChAoS". The man is bonkers. I can only hope PA stops Hilmar from suiciding Eve before it's too late.
---
dotlan is your friend, also ingame map is your friend. While cloaky bs is the fotm for solo or 2-3 people stuff, nano-ing around is fine as well
---
Yeah honestly this is the most level headed, spot on post ive seen. I no longer play, i started a long break from the game before even the AT cancellation announcement. The blackout and cyno changes are a step in the right direction. The game got boring.
---
Awesome man! Hope it works out for you.
---
Yet you do the opposite
---
Worlds biggest thinking emoji
---
Much like, MUCH less mining.      
---
This 15b is simple material increase so far.     
---
Since the blackout changes you can add like 1bil of potential additional cost for JFing stuff around.     
---
You can still find cheap super/titans as "not so smart" people are just selling them now under the material cost or firesaling ratting stuff low population also reduce the price spike.          
---
But as we speak materials for a titan (including the BPC cost) is around 50bilion, unless you go with the policy "if i mined ore it is free" and sell stuff heavily under current production cost.
---
What do you want me to do? Undock a Brawler-Hyperion to hunt a kikimora? Of course i'm gonna take an appropriate ship for the encounter. 
---
And I'm a complete PvP noob so i have no clue what the "perfect counters" are. I'm just gonna pick the ship that i think is gonna give me the best chances.
---
yeah well this game needs more leaders with lets burn them attitude that dont worry about politics. Leaders are too drawn into sustainability and how they will stay on top for years than having fun, tbh i doubt half of the big alliance leaders even log into the game
---
Reeeeeee
---
hillary did 9/11
---
Nullsec already had big problems before CCP added two new ones
---
So much shit like 
---
- citadel spam
---
- weeklong Citadel timers for a 500m raitaru
---
- carriers outclassed by supercarriers in basically every way
---
- Faxes that can easily tank whole fleets of subcaps
---
- Super docking
---
- Empire building is the only way to win big nullsec wars
---
Not to mention that Low is also pretty dead so disgruntled null players cant move there either
---
Thats why quite a couple null players including me quit in the two years before these changes
---
Click the gear next to the download bar on the left
---
To make it clearer. My issue is its making everything infintely more effort to get less results than I got pre blackout. Shits just empty and long now (sometimes hours) to find an engagement that inevitably lasts a few minutes tops more often around 30 seconds.
---
If it was easy everyone would do it. Players are the consequence of a good game, not the recipe. If you make your game versatile enough to appeal to a wide audience it needs to be superior in every category to retain those players.  
---
Otherwise you promote your great game to everyone, take everyone's advice, and everyone leaves because you didn't make anyone happy. Feel free to check out Robocraft if you want a good example of that one.
---
Yet, it’s in Alpha
---
There is plenty of supers and titans around.    
---
But it is more about the fact that materials needed for new super (ore, BPC even the fees) are now around 50bil.             
---
Like if  you don't spend this isk on industry jobs, sell BPC and ore - you can get 50bil for it **with much less work than hauling the ore and then parts**.
---
Maybe you should have pulled your head out of the sand before the blackout :)
---
i get your point but i dont think there is a parallel universe that i would prefer to be seen in local and reported 25j out by near2 or intelmaps, than being able to sneak past systems and get on top of targets
---
"G***oogle goatse***".
---
but thats exactly what im saying, it isnt
---
Maybe this is related? https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d31kei/psa_macos_users_that_are_getting_a_wine_error/ 
---
and/or have the launcher check your installation files.
---
lets make another hypothesis, game stabilizes at around 10k, massive alliances fall appart and new content is created, supers are much more difficult to use and there are no 250man titan fleets anymore, all big fights dont have tidi and with batphones they dont go over 500-600 man battles, how does all this sound to you?
---
I do so much PVP at lvl 42 ;D
---
Sure, it's political.
---
Well they will. 
---
Look at the big group policy.      
---
Don't use the big ships for ratting until all things are solved.          
---
Big groups are :          
---
1. Enforcing polices to reduce the strategic asset loses        
---
2. Guide members in what and what not to do            
---
3. Will provide ways people can use the heavy assets again         
---
What smaller groups will be able to do the same if they struggle with the issues is with getting a simple cyno chain.
---
its pretty easy, if i join a fleet, i am not aligned. i am stopped. xD if i undock, or in a fleet i am warp exempt
---
You just triggered so many Nullbears.
---
I love it!! Keep up the good work!!!!
---
Big groups will **Adapt** much better than smaller alliances.
---
Like desert space all around and wasting hours to find someone.
---
.... and that changes the demand how?
---
They’re saturated and barely die because nobody can counter fax blobs (that’s literally the only issue)
---
Everyone is selling their blueprints because they’re getting nerfed less and right to ENSURE they’re used even LESS it’s unreal
---
People might be more willing to go to war if big fights weren't decided solely by how many titans you can field. And if citadel spam wasn't so horrendous to deal with. And if they didn't have to spend all their time crabbing more titans just to keep up with everyone else. 
---
Stuff like that caused the leaders with a lets burn them attitude to quit. Skill U for example.
---
... which is why people leaving is an example of why this mismanagement is cancer
---
Well if you see cheap heavy asset buy it if you have isk.     
---
**If EVE die due to CCP actions ... like who cares about this ISK on accounts don't exist any more.**
---
puling pods? like, why lol. its such a bitch out thing to do.
---
if i die, i want my pod on that killboard to show i got balls. and to see how much i truely have got sploded in eve over my years.
---
They would if they didn’t give a damn.
---
Imagine “they have 500 titans” and an fc said “LOL PING 5000 dreads, every alt you have fit no tank let’s gogogogogo”
---
But everyone’s sooooo scared of “losing” and their killboards being red that this never happens. 
---
Also fuck faxes
---
what the hell does that have to do with my question of healthy or not
---
Trump, is that you?
---
If there are less logged in
---
there are less people to idle or do other things
---
that isn’t a hard concept you fucking potato
---
That's way too low for Deadmines, don't be a deadweight.
---
Sounds unlikely, that's how. You folks who keep singing the joys of new blood and new content forget that it won't happen just because the vets left.
---
The problem is people from the "empire building play style" have been telling people outside of that playstyle to HTFU / adapt or die for the last 4 years while those playstyles where bleeding numbers, slowly converting the game into nothing but empire builders ( i guess it's the new carebear ) and now that their playstyle is being nerfed we get screams about how eve is for everyone and really my only response there is cry me a fucking river. 
---
Now yes these changes are gonna bleed players as the game has selected for a player type for far too long that is currently on the nerf bloc but leaving something broken because the players will get mad if we don't leads to a game that is in a horrible state. 
---
I mean personally I disagree with the route they took because it's solving the core issue's without really touching the core tools but the route I would take in CCP's place would bleed more players not less so it's understandable, they took the safer route rather than deleting assets from the game.
---
&gt;make what's good for the game also be what's good for those people.  
---
Conflict is good for the game. These people generate conflict to enjoy the game. Fighting **is** good for them because that is how they achieve their goal of enjoying the game.
---
It don't changes the demand.      
---
Simply like i stated no cheap heavy assets can be build.      
---
If you cannot build cheaply - limit your loses.
---
All I want is delayed local tbh. Shouldn't be able to sit ratting in a massive blingly ship and dock the instant someone enters a system 2 jumps away.  But I hate the idea of entering a site and not knowing if somebody is camping it or not, there ok pretty much nothing that can be done at that point, just have to hope nobody is there. I will not enter any site with any ship of any value when there is a chance somebody could be sitting there waiting for me, which limits the stuff I can do in null.
---
[deleted]
---
How? Best I managed to get without officer mods and mutaplasmids is 415k.
---
haha yea, had to chuck mana potions like crazy, but managed to heal the whole dungeon. Van Cleef was very close tho!
---
Well adapting is **healthy** for people docking up heavy assets but it is **unhealthy** from game perspective.
---
Bro....
---
Or has been cancer and is now flushing itself out. No surefire way to tell, but toxicity of the playerbase is an informal gage of which it is.
---
Finally someone with 2 nuerons to rub together that can post on reddit without sounding like a crying baby.
---
How local is locally. Because I keep losing falcons at 500m a pop just moving things a couple lightyears. Are we all supposed to now live in a single system? There's nothing I can do about the constant roaming assholes hunting easy prey and running like hell whenever we undock combat ships.
---
Nothing has changed. It's just more expensive and annoying now.
---
And at the same time the changes can have other effects like the rest of the people being more engaged on average roaming more getting more kills and so on which is something CCP is aiming for with those changes you straight banana! CCP isn't in the Bisness of providing a login simulator hence people being logged in isn't the end of the story lol they want the game to be interesting enough that logged in people spend more time and money on it.
---
The fuck is wrong with you.
---
There is nothing healthy about “stay docked or log off” bro for any side of this game
---
It causes death
---
How do you tell the difference between the two?
---
I stopped playing it because it was 100% QOL and 0% MMO that makes you feel like you're in a single persistent world. All the instancing, zoning, unlimited teleporting. Moving from WoW (before all the cross realm zones and sharding) all these things bummed me out.
---
I actually have only 1 brain cell but it’s stronk AF.
---
Message Xuixien in game I'll send you the ISK for a barge if you need it.
---
Working wonderfully as intended.
---
Uh.  If the “gankers ” all left people would be saying the same thing “bye cancer gtfo”
---
It doesn’t matter which side is being forced to quit, i’m not so smug to assume either side “deserves” to play more than the other
---
And trying to get people to, or celebrate people LEAVING THE GAME. is the pinnacle of toxicity in any community.
---
“Be like me or die” is the most cancerous ideology humans implement in any group
---
So why is not gogX thriving for his action against the blue doughnut? My point is we should adjust mechanics to make it profitable for people to do what gigX did. Not hope that people like gigX are just badass enough and fun oriented enough because people like that are rare.
---
For someone who has been playing eve for 15 years and spent many years doing fun 100 man roaming gangs RR BS, nano etc where enemies would form just have GFs I really dont need a history lesson.  But I agree with your sentiment.
---
 However the fact content and fights rely absolutely on active FCs. That's simple fact
---
If you have 2 people logged in and shooting each other, hooray 100% activity
---
I guess that matters more than having 30,000 people forming empires that makes the game look cool... 
---
But not to me
---
I can't unless it is clear from the post content. 
---
So I'll give the benefit of the doubt if the post doesn't make it clear.
---
patch rolled out tuesday and you have already lost multiple falcons? Sounds dodgy. Moving things can be done with industrial cynos as well, so when you move parts ore or whatever you use a jf..
---
Maria would have died if you would have used your 3rd gun!!!
---
You can anthropomorphize it all you want; it's how it works.
---
and 2/3 of them are highsec bots
---
honestly, i have never waited on a single site for hours on end just to kill something, there are so many options around, it would be stupid to do so
---
&gt;how does all this sound to you? 
---
Boring as fuck.
---
im playing for 12 years now, i dont want anyone to leave, i want people to adapt the way i adapted when they kept nerfing every time my type of income.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Oh my gosh!  I would give you a huge if i could! And i will look you up now! :)
---
It has not Newtonian spaceship physics, just like every since game that came before it
---
That's a good exaggeration.
---
How long does it take their Titan to warp? Would they not hear the warp drive activate?
---
I've already got a huge. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
this desert space people keep saying is kinda dumb imho, there are places to go at certain times, if you go on a RU tz region at 01:00 ET ofc its gonna be deserted. There are places with constant activity due to the high volume of players they have (horde/goon/test space) and there are hours of opportunity on regions like omist/detorid/insmother/malpais/deklein and ofc pvp havens like tribute currently were 3-4 different alliances will hunt you and end up fighting each other
---
i find rorquals and titans online boring, i personally like to matter more in a fight than just being a #
---
I agree with your statement, but at the same time this is logical action after CCP action.          
---
Sorry but what did people expect?        
---
That people will constantly feed supers and titans to bomber fleets enjoyment?                 
---
Hint:           
---
Have you heard about "Null First"           
---
It was communication platform created between big block alliance leaders across whole New Eden when CCP decided to implement "Chaos".          
---
We went from block fighting each other for last 16years to working together against CCP actions for the first time in EVE history ^(no it is not healthy for the game, but people adapted)                 
---
So after you know this ... look all groups did the same at the same time.           
---
Guess what happens if after the week #nullfirst will decide that they super ratting is still forbidden ... how long it will take for people from those bomber gangs to start to quit due to lack of targets.           
---
CCP declared 'playerbase as the enemy' well players organized and united themself against the enemy.
---
This is the problem with the CSM- entitled people like you cannot even engage with the community.   You make your propaganda statement and walk away..., you make your scripted statements on the Meta show but can’t even reply to a single post.   People send you ideas and your army of edgelords just downvote them.   Try being part of a solution and not the problem dude.  Take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why do you play this game and why are you on the CSM ?
---
&gt;So why is not gigX thriving for his action against the blue doughnut?  
---
Mainly because hes banned but that's a different story.  
---
The thing is: with blackout and cynochanges CCP just took small pokes at the direction of the game and look at the response. What do you think is gonna happen if the game is gonna get turned around by 180° after CCP kept implementing changes that discouraged conflict over the past like 5 years. Look especially into the big blocs and you will see the playerbase tanked accordingly. Look at what kind of alliances we lost over the past years because of players quitting.  
---
IMO the current changes are a good test to see if enough people can be roped back in that actually enjoy conflict driven gameplay.
---
so what engine eve using
---
Test got new pets, simple as that
---
ask in mining channel.
---
The thing i dont like about blackout is that null has wh space local. Null is not J space, there are diffrent rules and its on a different scale. Honestly i think the problems null faces are down to player actions and habbits rather than game mechanics. For example do we have a boring world to live in? Or are we just boring people?
---
I guess you are missing the point where supercaps are literally everywhere and proliferation and projection has gotten exponentially worse. They used to mean something - a really rare sight &amp; a ton of work to build.
---
Now you can buy them off market for &lt;50bn.
---
i want to download  wormhole sounds as ringtones.
---
so if i manage to hit send in discord just before dying i get the spotlight to?
---
do you really think he'd get the same spotlight had he died of a heart attack in a pub back home?
---
People will just adapt and don't form bomber fleets until people rat again.
---
I'm #nopoors and don't have a JF yet. I use my suitcase rorqual.
---
Then don't play a game based around fleets that number in the hundreds? Go and play a game based around 3v3?
---
Collateral damage
---
Sadly yes
---
Mine doesn't work on 32bit or 64bit. thanks CCP - thanks for that btw.
---
Yeah the current changes are absolutely a great step forward. Lit all I'm saying is that we need more changes like that and other changes that make it profitable to do what gigX did. Cuz let's face it he was probably not going to thrive in that meta even if he didn't get backstabbed or banned.
---
Well, the game also needs more FC's like gigX so theres that. Maybe he wasn't a good tactician or shotcaller, but he had an aura that motivated people to follow him into battle, and into battle he would go even if a loss was easily predictable.
---
Bots bring harm to the game, krabs bring nothing to the game.       
---
Nothing of any value was lost.
---
What i would like is that the ones who quit are the bots and the people who defend them or the ones like you who suggest to quit the game when somebody try to alert about bots.
---
Some people think you are required to feed. No idea what those people are smoking.
---
we made it a game based around the hundreds, it wasnt. And we can make it again a game based around smaller numbers
---
Xix has a coalition?
---
they always can undock myrms
---
&gt;it wasnt
---
Yes it was, fleets have always been 256 people.
---
I think the changes are awesome, but I do find wormholes creepier now. Also, if you were the guy in the proteus last night... leave my Astero alone!
---
if you use catalyst to haul stuff when you could have been flying an iteron its not exactly the games fault, i see how it is inconvenient but its not exactly the games fault
---
And? CCP call the shots for their game. 
---
  All I see is "PA OWN THEM" as if that's gonna count as actual evidence they are directly in control of the game.
---
Its hard to say definetly, but having seen the havoc that TRI i can tell there would have been much more mapchanging and meaningfull wars if CO2 had been fighting alongside them. We (the playerbase as a whole) got robbed of these conflicts, and their potential power to keep EVE in motion.
---
Yeah and while you're talking about eve is dying there are people out there actually playing the game and having fun... look at those guys that killed an avatar at about the same time of you're post.
---
Let that sink in... keep posting in here talking about the game is dying while me and others actually have fun.
---
boring people 100%, game has so much to offer but we like turtling and when someone(ccp) tries to break us out of our shell, we get upset
---
Nonono.. Its not quitting because of danger.. Its more like i dont really see a chance to lose the ships i want to fly.. So theres no point to play.. But sure.. Big parts of the community think all the players not logging in in eutz anymore(-30% or something that) are only bots or crabs..
---
im suprised that nobody of them had nestor in ship hangar!
---
and yet people couldnt form more than 50 people for years. Corps could also have 10k+ players but that wasnt the case for the game for 10years+
---
The faster you unsub and piss off the better the game will become. Please do it fast
---
 the faster you unsub and piss off the better the game will become. Please do it fast
---
New accounts do now get chunks of SP via various means (Like 1 million for signing up through an affiliate link, though that's not pushed very hard for some reason).
---
Would be good to give them that SP for completing the tutorial missions rather than for signing up. "Have a million of these things that you don't know what they do" isn't the biggest lure.
---
Probably its own.
---
Second Galaxy probably uses a modern engine instead of a 20 year old one.
---
Yep, also rorquals should not use excavators any more as you cannot save them from bombs.
---
Giggity
---
when someone says im unsubbing my 10rorquals and now all the coalitions have put a ban on supercarrier and titan ratting, i find it hard to believe that people are quitting over lower pvp opportunities, cause even if you cant go and hunt whales, there are always subcaps running around pve and pvping in space.
---
So don't bring a t2 ship? Every challenge YOU face so does whoever you're fighting.
---
I think this is working exactly as designed.
---
Part of the reason why it was a 'wrong' decision is the EVE meta of super proliferation means a smaller alliance going rebel against a bigger aliance or bloc is pretty much suicide. The cynogeddon and Intel changes are a step in the direction of addressing that.
---
The only cancerous thing in Eve is an opinion like this.   
---
There are issues with all aspects of Eve but anyone who thinks that at this stage in Eve's life it is okay to lose customers and that they will just be "replaced by new blood" is, at best, delusional.
---
Chaos effecting the bots now...
---
This is the gayest post of all time.
---
Did you really bother to reply all this way doen without even reading the rest of my replies?
---
Paging u/BBTB2 - please tell this man the smokes of your choice
---
I met Vile Rat once while I was a newbie just flying my Navitas around exploring.  We had a nice little chat.  He was happy and funny and a great guy to talk with.  A few years later I ran into him again and this awesome guy remembered me and it was just a really great experience.
---
I still remember the day we all got the news.  The fundraiser for his family.  The bits that circulated about what he said last before logging off.  I never felt pain like that before for someone I met online.  I was on shift when they brought his casket home on that cargo plane.  I watched them wheel it down the ramp.  I listened to the speech that was given over his body.  I started crying and didn't stop until well after the end.
---
I don't know why his death hit me harder than others but I miss him and I hope he's well...somewhere out there playing amongst the stars &lt;3
---
in high sec you have:
---
\- FOB  
---
\- Inavsions - They really fun  
---
\- Incursion  
---
\- Missions (Nothing New here)  
---
\- DED Sites  
---
\- Abyssal Solo with a cruiser  
---
\- Abyssal group play with 3 frigs - very fun
---
Probably.
---
I can't reach the top shelf, doesn't mean you aren't meant to put things on it. It's a fucking shelf.
---
Christ.            
---
This is game in game you are to find something that you like to do and find enjoyment and do it until you get bored, find something else giving fun or look for other game.
---
I cant talk for others.. As long as i played ccp pushed towards supers/titans.. I worked my ass off for over a year to train my fax alt and be able to afford my hel and nyx.. And when im finally got everything i need ccp changed their mind by 180°.. Hell yeah im frustrated and unsubbing my accounts because it was a fucking waste of time getting all the stuff without selling plex/buying injectors.. I literally dont care for the 10+ rorq multiboxers or small gang wormholers..
---
Can confirm.
---
There are a few freeport Keepstars as well that people can use to dock up and sell their supers
---
No, it wouldn't, because most botters aren't in supercarriers, they're highly parallelized alpha accounts doing low ISK/hr but over lots of accounts.
---
Upwell OP!
---
Who's to say that you won't enjoy playing another way you've never tried?
---
 fully agree !!
---
The game is actually fun to play... shock horror and most of null does not like the changes to make it fun to play.. its messing with their way of life QQ such sad pandas.
---
This.
---
I can only up vote once.. sorry
---
I do get your point but srsly who uses ringtones in 2019?
---
Oh... "Game is hard! QQ" Guess you shouldn't play then?
---
\&gt;,&lt; sorry bro. update/downgrade to current prod OS version. Delete/reinstall. Try a different user account.
---
so working as CCP intended I see..
---
Why do you assume i never tried it?
---
The only thing I have not done in EVE is dropping capitals and titans on everything that moves. PM me if you want to provide me with a Ragnarok, Hel or Nyx for 30 days to get some insights :)
---
The only content gigX created was fucking over his members with his toxicity and poor decision making.. but people still see the guy as the pope...
---
ok man, just know there were people that had bought 100b titans, in an age when plex costed 250m and money was fucking hard to make, and their titans from tracking drakes went to "you see that 7shield extender mwding battleship? if it moves you cant hit it". This happens in every game ever, op stuff get nerfed.
---
They did, he wasn't able to refit because the Hel killed the Nestor he dropped quickly.
---
Im pretty sure every csm member has begged ccp to not do the cyno change. Hilmars greed and ego is clearly so big that he wont listen to reason
---
ok man, put more and more and more stuff on the top self, fill it to the brim and keep your lower ones empty and watch it collapse on top of the others.
---
Both of you should stop posting, but especially you.
---
Maybe they both are absolute fucktards and should stop this nationalist bullshit in a videogame. Just my 2 cents.
---
I mean should this guy engage you when you have the advantage? It’s zero sum and someone is going to have an advantage and the other person won’t want to fight.
---
I have a better suggestion. This guy should start playing hello kitty online so he can avoid pvp. You should go back to high school and start giving wedgies instead of getting swirlies in the girls toilet bowl.
---
I'll be watchin your 10k EVE online gameplay.
---
No ratting doesn't mean no login. Take a look at the 1DQ  keepstar when something is tackled.
---
I have. It’s fun. There’s a wonderful joy in sticking an alt inside a 6/10 in hostile space and waiting for the Blingu to warp in. On weekends when I can keep an eye on the client for hours, it’s a nice way to ambush an elusive and expensive target.
---
17 year, vintage, 'EVE is dying' meme.
---
8 hours according to my wingspan spy. So you roll the hole and when a new one pops you dont warp to it. do this with all the wh in your wh and you will have 8 hours of fun time. of course there could be someone in your hole as you doing this but that adds to the fun of it.
---
You have to risk it for the biscuit.
---
\&gt; Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want?
---
A less lazy fix that looks at mineral and ISK abundance. I'm OK with blackout if CCP gives us a little more counterplay against cloaky ships, though.
---
\&gt; Do you want the game the way it was in May?
---
No, it was cancer, but that hasn't changed. Goons &amp; TAPI can still roflstomp whoever they want.
---
\&gt; Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely?
---
I've never had a super umbrella protecting me.
---
\&gt; Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel?
---
No, not really, but I also don't want an autist who logged in his bomber at 11:04 to be able to point me at any time of day or night with no counterplay whatsoever because he never appears on d-scan until I'm pointed.
---
\&gt; What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities.
---
Very low losses, but mostly because the majority of my PvE has been highly active wormhole PvE. If I were a single account player mining in a Procurer, it would take me 2 hours of uninterrupted mining just to cover my T1 barge.
---
\&gt; When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.
---
Probably the day before blackout. My procedure if a lone Cynabal enters my system is to check next door on my ceptor alt for his friends, and if I think he's solo, I'll take the fight in a similar class of ship (pirate or t2 cruiser). I primarily play this game for PvP though.
---
\&gt; How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.
---
Lots.
---
\&gt; And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.
---
A year at best, but I don't think the current chaos will save the game because it only further encourages people to join the massive blobs, which is the opposite of what Eve needs.
---
I fully agree. PvE is mostly quite repetitive and tedious, not really a great game in itself. I do fear that creating appealing mission arcs require a lot of manpower and hence big investments. Maybe this is the sole reason why PvE is essentially static year after year, ie the same content with an updated wrapping.
---
Not hard, just effort. No challenge just unnecessary blocks to content.
---
Or, I could just put up another shelf if one gets full. There's no limit on how many shelves I can have.
---
I can sell you a Hel. :p
---
On mobile so a bit hard to format well:
---
Rollback to May: No
---
Super umbrella rescue: revert cyno changes BUT buff inhibs (anchor time 10s, 50% omni resist and 100k shield 100k armor and 50k structure). Also with an inhib active on grid cyno cycle time gets reduced by 50% of the remaining time.
---
Local: A delayed version id prefer, 30s-1min after gate cloak drops you appear in local
---
Ratting: Have not ratted after blackout, it was already tedious before and nownit just aint wort it and costs to much time. Srp, pvp loot and some trading is all income i have.
---
Last willing fight before blackout: have to check zkb to be sure but 1-2 days before. 
---
Lone cyna: Do i have ships to counter it in system: lets fight, otherwise meh ignore it
---
Bots: A few times i guess
---
Survivability: eh going back to old is bad but staying at this point is also bad. A healthy middle id what i prefer (see earlier points)
---
They do get the notification and sometimes they cancel. Sometimes they just aren’t paying attention or they’re part of the elite “eve has sound?” group.
---
WTB weekly subscriptions
---
You know what I really miss? Local NSFW spam with the old in game browser.
---
And instead of automatically emptying and repackaging containers, there should be a popup asking if you want to exclude these.
---
This. The definitive under rated comment.
---
Yes, I am toxic, especially to you. Now go F yourself
---
I'm not saying you specifically. Maybe you have tried everything in the game, but for a lot of people they found the first thing they liked and kept doing it.
---
looking at what the bots use it will be the myrm
---
there is an actual ceilling that you cannot overcome due to 1) hardware 2) player availability
---
Don't worry, You'll be called a Fa\*\*\*t constantly by Requiem Eternal while in Impass so you don't have to worry about the 'PC' culture. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/yHDGaVp.png](https://i.imgur.com/yHDGaVp.png)
---
Sure.. But the question is.. Is the player willing/the game worth it to adapt or not.. For me for now its a crystal clear no.. And when i take a look at a couple numbers im by far not the only one.. Questionable if ccp can afford all the lost players or if the meme finally comes reality.. Honestly i hope not because at some day i will comeback(if possible). But the numbers are scary
---
nope still system.
---
The only one really getting hurt by this is people who got their big ratting ship recently. Keep in mind there are people who have done super ratting since supers exist, in addition to other sources of income (trade, industry, whatever keeps yourself from biomassing your character after a multiple hours of shooting the same NPCs over and over again).
---
The only way to get that ISK out of the game is probably a buffer overflow resulting in negative wallets.
---
&gt;It is curious, that representatives of some alliances listed there, managing to post about how eve is dieing and online going down while knowing actual cause.
---
The cyno patch hit 48h ago. The discussion about dropping numbers has been going on for weeks now.      
---
To give a counter argument, we are still mining, we are still running subcap fleets. A docked super does not necessarily mean that the accounts are not logged in.
---
And its not 5 people in frigates.
---
You can't get Rorquals through the thera holes anymore.
---
malaka, i dont disagree and you know me, but people that would burn a dev alive for the changes only care about their safety, ofc there are better fixes that could be tested. people saying blackout ruined the game just didnt care about the rest of the playerbase since before blackout. When certain entities weaponize boredom scamming and highsec ganking to win wars they shouldnt come out crying "REVERT"..
---
The game is infinitely better now than it was in May. 
---
You can do so much fun stuff now. The new possibilities for really messing with people are endless. 
---
People actually have to put in some effort to find you - no matter what or where you are doing it. 
---
As far as the recent changes are concerned, the only change I would like to see is to add Cynosural Field Generator I’s back to Interdictors and Heavy Interdictors. Hopefully this happens before I refit the two dozen Cyno Dictors and half dozen Heavy Interdictors I have on hand.
---
A solid suggestion in a well written post with a reference to one of my absolute favorite podcasts? Delete this shit right now :D
---
Nah for but seriously thanks, I'll raise this with the team.
---
Wait, since when did EVE have achievements?
---
Ah so game is not hard just "effort". I dunno man, hard usually includes "effort" in my experience. I find being a wormholer a G DAN BLAST atm. People that are willing to put "effort" into adapting are, and new tactics / strategies are emerging. Speculation on alternative tactics and strategies are at an all time high! The content runneth over... Maybe you are doing something wrong, or looking at it with the wrong attitude?
---
Coming from a PVP point of view first... it really depends on the person and how they like to fly. if you are the in your face shoot close range type of person then Gallente blasters are your best guns. If you want range then Minmitar Artillery are great alpha monsters.
---
Missiles are ok and great in big numbers but for say a more solo pvp point they not the best.
---
Add boosts, genos and C6 pulsar effects.
---
Shood, niet als de paus maar als god :)
---
Lol I think you don't understand what he meant by "lopsided". Sov null has, until blackout, seen nonstop buffs for years straight.
---
But sure, unsub your injected rorquals. You genuinely won't be missed. I don't think eve is the game for you if you are so utterly terrible at adapting to change.
---
yes its 1500 supercaps from each coalition that will kill your game with stagnation.
---
He would have to invent ftl travel for that tho
---
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo, leadership telling their people that they are still figuring things out after a major change and asks them to not undock valuable assets to prevent them from being farmed and lost by risk-averse "elite-PVPers" in frigates. How dare they deny us easy feeds and instead take a professional approach to the situation?
---
i cant up vote it more than once.. I am sorry.
---
A rorqual is far tankier than a JF, and if most of what you move is ore, it can move more than a Rhea, and has the same range. A well fir Rorqual costs just slightly less than a Rhea. I had to pick one, so I chose the one that can help me earn money to get a JF later. But suddenly, CCP.
---
It *is* the game's fault that the *industrial cyno* can not be used by the *capital industrial ship*. CCP are just taking the piss at this point.
---
I think the "well written" is a bit flattering, but thank you!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utxb-kzvFZU
---
Ccp's mechanics are killing it.
---
If you remove caps it would just be bhaalgorn and megathrons. Just like it was a few years ago.
---
And no local makes the game more alive have you talked to anyone in local since blackout il bet you don't even live in null so these changes don't even affect you
---
So what you're saying is he doesn't deserve to be mourned ?
---
NO its not dead... just null sec crying about how everyone had to HTFU for the last 10 years and as soon as they get changes made to null they all REEEEEEEEEEE eve is dead.  
---
Its strange because all the HTFU posts where done by mostly Goons. If you look at all the doom and gloom its mostly Goons now and i am not even a grrrr goons person
---
i had  beoing GPWS warning  as ringtone for years but wanted change it to eve style
---
This is pretty much the founding story of Pandemic Legion. Miner got pissed off and found friends to kill the guys who kept killing him.
---
You're gonna go far in this game.
---
yes, use wh to get to null. just because there is no local does not mean they dont have intel. cloaky alts in the  pipe can also give intel so use WH's to get to areas quick and use the more Hit and run mentality.
---
that is up to people who wanna mourn him.
---
what i'm saying is, that the circumstances of his death are highly political, and saying that he deserves to be mourned just cause he was an eve player that was killed somewhere due to stupid actions of US government, is a bit rich
---
this guy metaphors
---
the fact you notice this means your game play has to change. if you notice something and dont change your game play to counter it then well yeah... you going to get blobbed. Maybe try and fish them on the outside or allow the bait to come in and play with it knowing there is more. then play with the fleet at range.
---
We as a player base really developed some terrible habits in the last five years. To me, it really started to go wrong with Phoebe. The problem was there well before Phoebe of course, but the instant that local groups could start to swing around Supercapitals without fear of having PL or BL suddenly materialize out of nowhere, they began to do so. And, when you have a hammer, you go looking for nails. 
---
As a home defense leader, we already sometimes had a tough time getting people to respond to a roaming gang, but it was usually pretty easy to shame the unwilling into jumping in a tackle ship and chasing off intruders. Sure, you might lose a Sabre here or an Interceptor there, but you usually got a nice little scrap out of it. 
---
But once capitals and Supercapitals became the default response ships, it fostered an even more extreme helldunk or blue balls mentality.
---
~~I mean, your Nyx is still~~ *~~really really~~* ~~good, it's just not quite~~ *~~as~~* ~~overpowered as it was before. You can still have loads of fun with it.~~
---
You're right, before you quit if you could contract that Nyx to Twilight Winter I'll make sure to ~~have fun in it for you~~ reprocess it into minerals to build more nano cruisers.
---
Daily pls
---
&gt;well written for an r/eve post\* 
---
There we go, fixed ;)
---
My current playstyle is a modification of some of my original and favorite game play in EVE, and it involves a combination of krabbing, marketing, wormholing, exploration and null sec. I have a few thoughts I'd like to share.
---
Empathy is not something you will find in most of the younger players, nor most people online, and I don't think this is an empathy challenge.  
---
In a sandbox game that offers PVE players as content for PVP players I find it funny that someone says "hey come on, feel bad for not letting me do what I want to do all the time without risk or consequence."
---
I like blowing things up and looting the spoils. If you want to play a space game that is purely PVE I hear Kerbel Space Program is pretty cool.
---
When I go hunting I often put billions on the line to kill a ship that is worth far less. I figure if you can kill me you deserve a reward! There's my empathy for you. :)
---
serious question here.     
---
For sure more ratting supers than PVP dreads.
---
Who knows what science we can create to help him
---
Why that’s what he said.  You asked a question I answered it.
---
To me and everyone who cared, the politics have nothing to do with it and mentioning them in the same sentence is just disrespectful. I think we can agree on that.
---
so is your friend the attacker or the defender.
---
\- Attacker then yeah you have to attack  
---
\- Defender then you can assist in the war and will be able to shoot the enemy but not fleet up or logi your friend. High sec rules still apply.
---
The pope is the hand of god. See what i did there....  Yea i will show myself out
---
Smaller groups weren't boson ratting, super ratting or rorqual mining at a meaningful level.
---
!remindme 364 days

Next time it's my turn to reap all the karma.

That would make them soldiers of fortune yes lol

I think your best-fit line got depressed half-way through...
---
How hard did you roll your face across the keyboard when you wrote all that?
---
Really? I'll try it.
---
chinese drama is good shit
---
I base out of lowsec, but given that most of my pvp these past few months has been nullsec, I feel like it's worth answering.
---
CCP to iterate on the game.
---
There were more people to shoot.  Local needed balancing for sure.  Complete blackout has been too heavy in the other direction.
---
I don't live under a super umbrella.
---
Nope.  I wanted delays instead of full blackout.  And then for CCP to iterate on those delays into a balanced spot.
---
I don't track this.  The vast majority of my time in-game is Pvp.
---
&gt;When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.
---
I take fights every day willingly.
---
More than a couple.  Obligatory, not every person who warps off quickly is a bot.  And also, they're figuring out how to do it in the blackout era as well though.
---
Plenty long.  Eve is a unique and interesting game.  I actually don't want the chaos era changes removed.  I want them iterated on.  CCP has made hunters have it as easy as krabs used to have it.  And one group in the game having it be pointlessly easy to go about their business is bad for the game (see the previous few years).  We need balance.   Real balance would lead to actual chaos.
---
There’s a critical mass of that language speaking community in the game already.  
---
Not being racist at all.
---
I think I was mini g for 6 hours so there is a lot of ore, was waiting for the moon mining fleet.
---
More than you appear to want to give credit for
---
Go team up with HONORABLE third party, and ask them assistance to carve out your own piece of Provi. All their ADMs have gone to crap lately. Providence is a great place to live if you like feeling constantly unsafe.
---
Who?
---
&gt; While people are still selling cheap supers and titans, materials needed to build a new titan went up from 35bil to almost 50bil already, and this is just start.
---
This is cool and makes the game more balanced if true. If anything its too little too late now.
---
I for one would love to be told about how someone fucked my mom in Portuguese.
---
Its a little bit of a pain in the ass but if you're willing to run a Miasmos to grab your cans it works out. Armageddons or Rohks work best.
---
should  have backup...i always carry 2 nestors with me
---
upvoted
---
I found a contract for 10 run Rupture bpc for 500k isk so was gathering materials for it.
---
Go on, tell me how people in Japan have real problems and can't afford to spend hours playing games then. 
---
I could use a laugh.
---
ask lepus fatalis in game and i will lead you to miner heaven, in your beautiful procurer all gritty and yellow!
---
following your logic this would be the 3rd war started.   
---
1st  war: Test + Legacy Pets (+occasional frenemy Goons)  
---
2nd  war: FiRe (basically XiX and pets)  
---
3rd war: AOM (who basically attended fleets vs WC anyway)  
---
game is dead, there is no content anymore...
---
having fun in eve at the moment so im happy good sir... looking at your comment history though... dam.
---
Nigeria... South Africa... Argentina... Brazil.... 
---
The fucking 3rd world countries asshole.   
---
If you need a laugh look in a mirror.
---
All you can prove now is that you're a bot that passes the Turning test.
---
What about it?
---
Ha... I'd bet real money he is lying.
---
For starters, I want 4 things:
---
1) passive moonmining to return to the game.
---
2) citadel mechanics to be like pos mechanics, or at least less horrible than they are now.
---
3) fozzie sov to be reverted in total.
---
4) a mechanic forcing alliances to spread out rather than being able to cluster everyone within a single region.
---
This would indicate to me that CCP at least now realizes where things went wrong with EVE. Blackout in and of itself isn't what's killing the game, it's just the latest in a long series of bad ideas.
---
Also your op sucks because it is clear that you don't take any of the valid criticisms of the game seriously.
---
maybe they should each mind their own niche, then?
---
who else but ReedIcculus
---
I love the new WHs. i loaded one on grid and stared at it for like 10 - 20 mins. ended up having to explain what WHs are to my base liner room mate after that.
---
It's really interesting to read about the dynamics of those alliances and the political tropes being used.
---
Blackout the repair tool, it impedes my play style by allowing the other player to repair their docked ship. Rabble!
---
What drama?
---
Do you take everything so seriously? It would suck. I’m already bored, I live in other people’s space and hunt them and even they’re boring.
---
&gt; when someone says im unsubbing my 10rorquals and now all the coalitions have put a ban on supercarrier and titan ratting
---
.
---
&gt; i find it hard to believe that people are quitting over lower pvp opportunities
---
uhh what???
---
If you read me as a PvE player, I think you've got the wrong idea. I've done very little PvE other than buying large quantities of raw materials and putting them in my manufacturing structures for a very long time. Most of the time I like flying T3Cs or running gate camps in hostile space.
---
Since I became a CEO of a corp, I've become a lot more mindful of what PvE players need because they're an invaluable part of any nullsec alliance (you can't keep ADMs up without people ratting and mining, and random sov defense timers at buttfuck o'clock aren't fun and don't promote content).
---
This has given me a more balanced view of the game where a) I want to be able to find fights and targets, and b) I also don't think hunters should get 'free kills'. To give one example, cloaky bombers logging in just after downtime and picking targets at their leisure has little or no counterplay except baiting any time you're PvEing. 
---
They're likely to bring in blops and T3Cs so that bait needs to be a fleet which can fight an unknown number of blops &amp; T3Cs as well, on standby, any time you're PvEing... with about 20-30 seconds max to respond (I'm not talking about capital ratters here -- these are dudes in Procs and a Porpoise or such). It's not reasonable to expect every group to sit a pre-formed fleet on a titan 24/7 waiting for a blops drop.
---
We like to talk about risk/reward for capital krabs, and I still agree that their risk is too low, but the balance patch hasn't only affected capital krabs.
---
There is no need at all for that screen anymore since repair is free. Should just auto repair on undocking tbh.
---
Your sanity is reaching EOL
---
Come to Delve, buy a discount Hel.
---
South Africa has areas of significant wealth in addition to poverty. 
---
Brazil has areas of significant wealth in addition to poverty. 
---
Most countries on that list have plenty of people who can afford to (and do) play games. Do you seriously think not a soul in Chile has a computer that can run eve??
---
You're a fucking idiot with no life experience whatsoever. Get some before you make sweeping generalisations based on backward world views.
---
It´s always my favorite part when people throw in for how long they play this game as if that gives their post so much more meaning.

I left goons to try and do wormhole and solo

I also remember him self-destructing an entire Macharial fleet during the opening stages of WWB. As one of CO2’s allies, that didn’t inspire much confidence.
---
I can, because dumb changes that people warned CCP against lead to current situation.        
---
Even worst changes are implemented now.            
---
You are CSM now, ask other CSM members what was the CSM position on :               
---
* citadels            
---
* capital changes          
---
* fozzie sov             
---
* moon mining          
---
* rorquals                     
---
People were against or asked to fix stuff the moment issues showed up.            
---
Now the same people are saying that all current changes are bad and if you look what is happening around - they are correct.                
---
Why small people cannot exist any more ?                
---
Because they cannot compete with others as the investment they need to put on field is so huge that no one sane will do it without proper backup.                
---
Sure you can live in some NPC station and do 3 man roams but you are not a small group but bunch of friends roaming together.
---
Well isnt the big blocs that cause a lot of the problems?
---
&gt;  C6 pulsar effects. 
---
Plenty of cynos in there!
---
&gt; I want super umbrellas to fight super umbrellas.
---
This won't happen anytime soon and when it happens it won't remove enough minerals from the game to balance the pre-blackout mineral spam.
---
any kind of passive income is a bad idea cause that translates to less time in space and more appliance of Malacanis Law  
---
citadels suck donkeyballs in so many fucking ways  
---
fozzie sov if iterated correctly could be ok, now its just cancer  
---
i partially agree with the spreading out but i wouldnt want places like the current tribute to fall victim to that. mainly i would agree if it made big alliances schism.   
---
i try to reply to everyone and reason with him, im not shutting down anyone or anything or say that there arent bad things in the "Chaos Era".
---
Hi Drax 👋
---
Yes it is way overdue.          
---
If only CCP listen CSM members asking to not implement excavators or look what was happening and reacted to people asking to undo those changes over the last year.            
---
Thankfully they are gone ... oh wait, not we still have mining rorquals.             
---
Injector cash won again!

#keepGigxBanned
---
Not that I care really but current Meta is to tell certain people their game play is shit. Nothing has changed really just the people saying it. And before some one says it. I live in NPC null and low sec and the changes while somewhat annoying because of cloaky and non scannable ships just hide and wait for easy kills, I'm still here
---
Oh certainly, if the changes were more popular then the EVE community would have been much more invested in EVE and less likely to jump ship.
---
I have had 2 or 3 solo fights in the entirety of 2019, these blackout changes along with the other "chaos era" stuff just made it feel more empty. 
---
Shame that wasnt the case, because with how unpopular these changes have been instead of playing the game people have looked to WoW Classic as a means to scratch that itch and while I cant speak for every other EVE player who jumped ship and hopped on the WoW Classic Bandwagon I can say without a shadow of doubt that WoW classic, despite not being PvP centric like EVE has much more Solo, Small Gang and Large Group PvP content in the first week then EVE has had in a year.
---
I definitely wont be coming back to EVE anytime soon.
---
 
---
Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want?  
---
CCP to stop acting like losing 10,000 players logged in over a 4 month period is just bots and no big deal
---
Do you want the game the way it was in May?  
---
it beat the fuck out of the rats abandoning a sinking ship simulator we have right now
---
Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely?  
---
people died every damn day in delve even when the umbrella was there
---
Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel?  
---
It was just as useful to me when I went hunting as it was when I was krabbing
---
If so, please inform the rest of us a couple things
---
What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities.  
---
haven't krabbed in over 2 months, once they start this whole Chaos shit show with drifters I went from playing 2-6 hours a day to logging in for pinged fleets and literally nothing else.
---
When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.  
---
June and blob the fuck out of them for bringing kitey bullshit to my home
---
How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.  
---
0
---
And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.
---
longer than it will if we keep losing 10,000 accounts off the player count every 4 months
---
Yup confirming I get solid 60FPS and have no issues with the 64bit launcher
---
you cant say people stopped logging in for pvp from cynochange day 1 when there was a 2k drop, when 2 days after we(people that dont have spies) learn that multiple entities have banned supercarrier ratting and even if you suspected it, you would fucking try to see what they are doing, not go oh cyno changes now we can kill fucking supers easier but wait they are not gonna log in so im not gonna log in and even see if they are in space.
---
I'll always consider an attempt on bountied pilots that i notice. You can set your overview to colour them - making it simple to identify targets. It's suprising how many you'll see passing stargates in a week. Just make sure they're suspect or have a killright on them before you open fire.
---
I don't suppose it'd be hard to actually hunt down certain pilots. We've got locator agents, intel ships and modules. Figure out what they're flying, where and when they go. If you're willing to put the effort in, go for it. Document your experience and yours could be the youtube guide proving validity.

Have you tried making the wine prefix 64bit?

&gt; oh wait, not we still here !
---
Blackout took null mining from 60t/month averages for null 25t. Also put excavs in a nice tradeoff place where a solo attentive Rorqual can still use them. A nicer middleground solution could probably do the same as well, but blackout proved that increased risk is also an instrument to put the macroeconomy back on the right track.
---
Can't be helped ... it is indoctrinated at a young age ... another reason to blame CCP
---
No it wouldn't,  because Baltecs are a meme doctrine and in reality fucking garbage, theres countless sub comps even ones that are smaller than Battleships which are objectively better.
---
I agree with most of what you're saying.
---
But we cant take Rorquals, injectors etc back now. All we can do is looking at ships people inject towards, and making their use more dangerous.

a day to remember.

This actually made me chuckle, upventured

yeah, because how dare he want to stand a chance in a fight. Doesn't he know pvp noobs are required to feed for years before they are allowed to try and win?
---
The truth is that it takes a lot of time and dedication to become a successful FC or other “content creator.” It’s not just about building a good reputation. It takes a lot of planning and time to make a successful roam happen. When I last FCed consistently, our goal was to roam for no more than 60-90 minutes. Now, with a wife and kids, if I can get 30 minutes of uninterrupted Eve time, I’m absolutely ecstatic.
---
CCP has consistently made the consequences of mid-promoting the wrong person to even mid-level leadership nearly catastrophic. This promotes burnout. This has caused an agglomeration of larger and larger groups around tightly knit leadership cores.
---
CCP has done nothing to make it easier for people in 0.0 to create and get to content for themselves. Yes, players are to blame for some of this, but CCP has failed to set the conditions for small groups to grow.
---
Give in, obey God's whispers and bring him your offerings!
---
Interestingly enough I don't think I have ever seen a gun kill someone on its own. Unless of course were going to blame cars for wrecks and spoons for making fat people.
---
no worries, it's no big deal either way. :)
---
Thanks tho!
---
Wow exciting times ahead maybe? I simply love these posts showing the strategic posturing on both sides!
---
As someone who does not PVE at all. I can say this reads like some one that wants free kills. 
---
You should never expects for anyone who is PVEing to willing fight you. As it is literally suicide, unless they PVE in a PVP fit ship. 
---
It is the hunters job to catch the target. If you can catch them then you dont deserve a kill, it is really that simple.
---
The permaban handed down to gigX was always viewed as a little ham-fisted on CCP's part, but unfortunately it would become characteristic of how their interactions with the player base would be handled in the future, slowly driving away content creators and veteran players (recall the manner in which they were so quick to point the finger during the Brisc Rubal incident). Now, with average player count about to fall below five digits, it's quite clear that the company has fully lost its grip on community expectations viz-a-viz the future direction of the game.
---
Clearly the days of CCP using the excuse of so-called 'consultation' with the CSM to palm off responsibility for shoddy design choices are over. At this point blackouts, cyno changes, and other sleight-of-hand mechanics changes just aren't going to cut it - and, as OP suggests, the game's only real hope at this stage is to issue a call to arms to content creators.

I agree with most of what you're saying.        
---
But while we can't injectors back now we can rework Rorquals to remove the ore injection and rethink the moon mining to :            
---
* reduce the workload that need to be done without mining rorquals existing        
---
* stabilize the T2 market            
---
* reintroduce timers people can generate and fight for          
---
* reduce structure spam across the New Eden

RIP Bless Online. I'm glad I waited before paying for it. It looked like a regular MMO at the start but as more people reached what would be considered "endgame".. there wasn't one.

As someone who was optimistic about blackout etc, this entire post is one gigantic straw man. Fuck off with this nonsense.
---
So of you lead one of the nullblocks, would you let every ratting super / titan into the meatgrinder because that’s the best for the game itself, but not your linemembers?
---
Sure, 25b and its yours.. =)
---
I have, but only a super or titan. Anything else isn't worth waiting around for.
---
You seem to be making a LOT of assumptions there. NO.
---
At least you tried. :)
---
This was exactly my problem with it.  They did a tonne of great stuff to make the game interesting and fresh.  The dynamic questing and everything was really a step up from fetch quests.. There was actually worthwhile exploration too.  I found several hidden away places where there was a chest with guaranteed rare drops for your level.  Some of them were not easy to find at all.
---
Ultimately though, the dumbed down skill system and every character being somewhat self sufficient just made teamwork and coordination dull, and that's a death sentence for an mmo
---
True pvp is mining Shining Monazite with your corpmate.
---
K beeboi
---
What’s a base liner
---
sounds like you bought a shitty shelf.
---
PvP shoul'd be a profitable way of income!
---
I dont know how to achieve that. There is always the problem with alt accounts.
---
And i agree with you that the terrible, tedious, boring PVE i one of the main reasons people leave EVE so early.
---
New players get greeted with a super complex game with almost no real explanation. And the first things they learn is that it takes years to close the SP gap and if you want to speed that up you have to insanely grind ISK.
---
Also if you want to get into the fun part of pvp you also have to do horrible grinding.
---

"The Chinese are *very* forward thinking" says Hilmar in one of the recent event videos - I think it was [beyond the friendship machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw67gb6eoYk). I doubt there's a significant chance Pearl Abyss will seek a way out of the deal, judging by the amount of cocaine present during CCPs presentaions to PA. Gambling has always been effective money laundering.
---
I've started doing new things instead of super ratting and rorq mining, like exploration and PI.  
---
Wish I started doing PI along time ago, it's **riveting**.
---
That should still work fine.
---
I prefer an MWD over the AB myself to get to all the cans in time, but you will need to bling up your lowslots a bit to make it fit.
---
Disregard females, acquire killmails.
---
Sry but I am interested. How do you make 300m/h?
---
how dare he not be willing to spend hours searching empty systems to find no content right? The nerve of some people...
---
Who the hell talks to people in local?
---
Draugur pilot here.
---
No snake implants there. T2 AB draugur is still almost 400m/s faster than the hecate. I think your best bet would've been to turn and try to apply some dps.
---
Enjoyed the video though. Thanks for sharing.
---
&gt; any kind of passive income is a bad idea cause
---
You're wrong. Passive income is a driver for conflict. Take away too many drivers for conflict and your game gets stale.
---
&gt;fozzie sov if iterated correctly could be ok, now its just cancer
---
Fozzie sov is NEVER going to get iterated in a way that will make it not cancer. CCP's iteration cycle has an average of 3.5 years, so I am not holding my breath on that one.
---
Pog
---
I've been doing PI, so fed up of my Silicon planet going to shit every 3 days lol.
---
I like the fact two larger alliances are enemies .. reminds me of the old days.
---
EU/US should declare both of them targets
---
This is rather alarming, eve online appears to have had more than 40% of the playerbase leave in 6 months to a year, with a large portion leaving in the last few months.
---
Get rid of the magic 14 skills. Or pre set them to 5. (those cant´t be extracted)
---
Increase initial SP on creation. (those cant´t be extracted)
---
Increased SP gain the lower you total SP are. Total SP are all the ever gained SP. (so extracting SP would speed up your SP gain again)
---
Get rid of attribute ramapping and attribute implants.
---
The fear of losing training implants and the fear of fucking up the all so precious remapps makes people (new player) risk averse.
---
Yeah baltecs fleets were so shitty in the 2018 war the north started using them instead of their own comps.
---
Oh, its this thread again
---
&gt;ATM: How to make new players stay and become regular Eve players?
---
Simple thing:   
---
Stop the deliberated campaign of large nullblocs to make life in Hisec miserable. Currently (at least until blackout) the umbrella areas were safer than most Hisec systems, because of miniLuv GankSquad of Goons, or Nullblocs paying PIRAT to harass/remove all Hisec Moonmining. Eeverybody that has some insight in this, knows that at least for Goons this campaingn is planned and deliberate. The goal is to make hisec life annoying especially for newbros (experienced players usually know how to dodge hisec harassement) to drive them into KF and make money of them.
---
i hope ccp lets the cyno be for a while.
---
Currently, everyone is scared to drop offensive caps. But everyone said "the first that drops caps now, will win the fight". So I have hope that someone will start dropping these caps.
---
And once the caps are on grid, there are still a possibility to drop on these caps.
---
So, I have hope, that there might be groups that risk their caps earlier, to gain the "first dropper" advantage. If that actually would happen, it will take some time until someone tries that.
---
you say that but my kb is up there, i try to solo a lot after blackout and sometimes i kill sometimes i die, i dont expect every anom to be a kill, but reship and come fight or bait me, the attitude is im gonna afk here till he gets bored and leave.  
---
the whole point of the post was dont pretend that the game was better before blackout and it wasnt dying, it just that it was getting maintained cause less and less player logged but more and more people multiboxed heavily.
---
I don't know why this is being downvoted so hard. Dropping the monthly sub, if not to zero, then to say $5/account would have the immediate effect of attracting players from less affluent parts of the world. No matter how much CCP claim that alpha is a near fully featured experience, the perception amongst MMO players in general is that free versions of 'premium' games are a waste of time. If only a handful of those new players go on to buy plex, CCP recoup at least some of their lost revenue, potentially much more. 
---
I'm sure CCP won't publish figures for the percentage of revenue generated through subs vs through plex sales. Would be fascinating though.
---
Ok go to SISI with some friends.       
---
Tell a guy to sit 0 on rock in colossal and mine the ore.        
---
Take a bomber and try to bomb the excavators.      
---
If you manage to decloack deliver bomb before he can pull the excavators - then a single rorqual cannot use them.    
---
Tell your friend that you will do it in 2min so he will not be afk.       
---
Hint - excavators cannot be pulled back in time even if pilot give the command instantly as the bomber decloacks.              
---
-------------------------------                  
---
Now my simple opinion about blackout.               
---
Blackout is bad as it cost eve a lot of players.            
---
CCP could put work to make place dangerous but instead of spending some cash on developer time the decision was just to disable some mechanic people used for years.                                          
---
People react to this badly and we see the result.         
---
Simple RL example.           
---
For years you buy coffee in one place.        
---
For years you buy coffee with milk and sugar.       
---
Someone decides that from now that they will sell you coffee without milk now.              
---
What will you do? Keep buying coffee in the same place or find new place where you get what you liked for years.

Roamed into deklein - tackled and killed a phantasm which caused Darkness to undock and retaliate. After a nice skirmish we decided to move on as they had enough alpha on field to start removing our cruisers. GF
---
Red Light on Rorq-Mining and Super-Ratting seems to kick in ... good
---
The corp was pretty dead for the last year or so they were with us, their remaining actives moved to a different corp. Look at the dotlan graphs and zkillboard if you want independent confirmation.
---
I think another issue is the combat isn't engaging. Its basically the same as a 15 year old MMORPG (turn on auto attack, wait till enemy dies, loot shit). Eve has somehow kept the combat system while all other mmorpgs have changed.
---
I'm not suggesting they add stupid reactive button bashing to eve, but it is a big difference betweem the mmorpgs... eve reminds me of my sodding paladin on classsic, turn on buffs, hit it with primary weapon until it dies).
---
Are you flair baiting?
---
Just because you got a second guy to lick the window doesn't mean window licking isn't fucking retarded.
---
Archeage unchained is coming, who knows, the mechanics might appeal to some eve players.
---
This is said so much better than I could have. I agree with it completely, but I live in NPC null.
---
It was 50% of the Logins from 2014-2018, so BEFORE Blackout.
---
I don't think you're wrong, I think he's just a hypocrite.
---
Sure its the going rate for the nyx with all the refits..
---
Well, if about 8k of them was the bots banned then I'm not too worried. I mean it's still a huge drop it's not that.
---
- but how much if it is actual unique players and not single players with multiple accounts.
---

---
its nice if you are a big juicy alliance that can form quite some people and control moons 4 regions away(for example old BL), but i dont see a way that this is fine, i havent touched moons after the changes but at least active moon mining brought riches to the people that gave man hours for them.
---
eve has been on its deathbed since 2004, nothing new (tho i dont mind if it actually dies this time around)
---
When you put it that way, it confirms the statement I made about "doing something wrong".
---
Maybe CCP should actually make the NPE good so new players actually stay, no point tearing the game down to try and build it back up if no new player would keep playing it.
---
TBF though, most of what people call market analysis is financial market phrenology.
---
and how would you characterize eve and the way it has been coded
---
Me too, also for about the last 2 weeks.
---
Rubberbanding on grid. All over laggy. (Dock/Undock, module activation wich sucks)
---
But the game is in its heathiest stats EVER!!!
---
/s
---
It would only add N time if the entire database was a CSV file and you were using a naieve for loop. 
---
In this case a container is an object with other objects inside it, which would be implemented as a Foreign Key in an SQL database (which they may or may not use but is a common piece of tech), and to query those attributes you would use a Join operation, this is not O(N) and does not result in O(N^2). In fact, considering the cost of Network and UI render time, you'd likely save on performance over all by filtering your results at query time.
---
&gt; I cant talk for others.. As long as i played ccp pushed towards supers/titans.. I worked my ass off for over a year to train my fax alt and be able to afford my hel and nyx.. And when im finally got everything i need ccp changed their mind by 180
---
every single one of your experienced nullsec mentors could have told you that putting all your eggs in one basket is a pretty dumb way to play the game. they obviously failed to do so.
---
back in like 2007 i had this awesome flip phone that allowed you to turn recordings in to ring tones via the voice memo feature. I miss that phone.
---
It's a *little* more complicated than that.
---
Because this is concurrent users, not total users. So we don't have the *whole* story.
---
An example of how this can be affected:
---
A game has 25 users. 1 stays connected 24x7, because they're an evil bot. the others play for 2 hours a day, with only 2 players overlapping at a time. (yes, I'm simplifying massively, to keep this simple to understand)
---
so the PCU is 3. as you have 2 normal user, and 1 bot connected. 
---
The bot is now banned.
---
you've just dropped 33% on the PCU, and only 4% on the number of players. 
---
So bot bans will be affecting this. As would, for example, people playing for shorter periods per day. (as there'd be less overlap). 
---
All that said, yes, I have fairly significant concerns.
---
No. BRAVE actually has good standing fleets and home defence. We encourage everyone to be in comms and pay attention to Intel so they have a chance of getting saved. 
---
At the same time as I said there's also people who never get in comms and learn to help themselves getting saved and those are the ones that rage about the blackout the most because the only thing they know is warping off if a neut enters local.
---
&gt;  some bored dude cloaky camping 
---
Just a sabre alt :p
---
&gt; Hint - excavators cannot be pulled back in time even if pilot give the command instantly as the bomber decloacks.
---
Mate I've literally spent hundreds of hours on the bombing side. Tons of nonafk Rorquals pull them on time. If what you said was true everytime I go for Excav booshing (spool 6 seconds btw, not 12 seconds like bombing) I'd get drones.
---
Unfortunately that's not a stat we can pull I'm sure ccp has an internal tool to show that but  if it's anything like my corp we lost 12 of 32 people that have gone dark in the last 2 months with 45 days of inactivity with no ESI wallet changes or fleet participation. Many others dropped from our system and move to high sec
---
we were above 20k for 20minutes
---
1. passive anything is bad. king of the hill events would be cooler. Like an iteration of the pirate sotiyos
---
2. citadel mechanics are too strong, but pos mechanics were not perfect either: make something in between.   
---
Plus: Lower the defense of flex structure and/or their usability (mainly cynojammers)
---
3. fozziesov is great, the combination of jammers makes it annoying. But in general it causes great skirmishes.
---
4. totally agree.
---
It's still going to be the biggest blob wins it really doesn't fucking matter what ship they pick.
---
You know what they say about wormholers, they'll rape you to death, eat your flesh and sow your skin into their clothing. And if you're very, very lucky, they'll do it in that order.

So I think your behaviour is appropriate
---
It's just a little on fire, it's still good, it's still good!

Well, I m sitting in HS with most of my small toys. So blackout and cyno-changes( I still havent read up about their details, hm, I should, I think :D ) All/most of my big toys still are somewhere in null where I lived before I felt like having to throw a tantrum and leave :D
---
You may hate the Mittani (ingame) but that sentence of him from 2013 still stands true:
---
"Many EVE-Players may not know him or what he did, but they all were living in a Galaxy mainly shaped by his work &amp; presence"
---
PL is shit anyway. Good move.
---
Yes racism and nationalism, exactly what Eve lacked, because you know "destroying shit is fun" is apparently too complicated for fucking krab players these days.
---
rip Beth
---
Wasn't that long ago empire builders were shit on and poached by the likes of PL, BL, and NC but they got told to adapt or die as well. I think both extremes are bad.
---
remember its all the bots getting banned, ccp have never banned bots before the blackout started /s
---
I understand what you are getting at.. but how does that apply if the bot is just recreated and sent back into the world again? We already know that when a bot is banned it’s just going to be remade and start the cycle again, right?
---
But... but... I love my bad habits... I had so much fun with them... :(  
---
;)
---
It doesn't limit anything.  Are Goons struggling to communicate and organize?  No.  Of all the things to complain about with the recent changes, this is by far the dumbest.  God forbid you TALK to the people with whom you play a MASSIVELY MULTI-PLAYER GAME.
---
5 second rule just run some water over it
---
Yep. I'd probably return if gigx got unbanned. Dude could create some content.
---
if you love them, this mechanic showing them to you wouldnt annoy you :D
---
not sure how you can count bot ban's when its super clear they literally just waited 5 minutes then made fresh accounts and resumed business as usual. the people that left were not bot bans its actual people who have stopped their subs on their alts and are no longer loggin in their alts for longer than a few minutes to move isk or items.
---
But but but, all the NEW players will stay around. Ow as they do not get dropped by titans in newbie systems!
---
Now, newbies can get into fleets and kill what ever they want in rookie ships as bots are purged from the game.
---
Null is a great place to visit, you will see players everywhere and they will run from you as, being a newbie, you have nothing to lose and they have everything.
---
Trust me, Day 1, this game is easy!
---
Ooooohhh 
---
Thats sounds actually good! I like it.
---
But cloaky scouts will let you know in advance what type of ship is coming at you.
---
Welcome to every day in a wormhole... I see your point with Provi - but there are still regional intel/krabbing channels so people don't step on each other's toes with sites.  But forcing people to communicate more is really not a problem that needs to be fixed.
---
Please stop telling our secrets. We can't have that.
---
*"normal players"* \- That made chuckle :P
---
Even more in a Prospect and you can blops bridge it.

Small violin
---
The only ones that will get you are the neuting waves with that fit. If you're only doing tier 3 abyssals you might want to look at replacing one of your shield extenders with a cap battery. Not required, but I notice you're running 2 adaptive invulns, and when the cap runs out it makes for a super bad day. I run a similar fit, but I've also replaced one of the invulns with a thermal or em resist. Also might be worth throwing an MTU in your cargo hold. With your drone link augmentor you can send out your drones to pop some of the extractors and then pull them towards the exit gate. If you run out of time you scoop the MTU and leave, but it gives you the options.
---
I see your point, especially about the fitting simulator, but there are still good reasons to support 3rd party development and provide features that are an addition to it, as opposed to outright giving us official CCP versions of the same things.
---
For one, it helps build a community, player groups can offer you value with 3rd party services, more internet exposure for the game, etc.
---
Second, CCP can deliver a more polished and professional tool because they can sink a meaningful amount of money into it, but a 3rd party dev can make himself/his corp/etc an uglier and slightly buggy version of the same tool that matches their particular need perfectly.

You, two hours ago.
---
and lets not forget the bizzarre attitude to making PVE more interesting CCP has taken. I hate to think how many newbeans have died to the random uber npc's that roan hisec. a Three week old guy is probably feeling pretty confident blapping hi sec anom rats and then he stumbles across trigs, diamond rates, burners or lancers and must be left thinking wtf?
---
&gt; Consider your current playstyle, and do the opposite for 30 days.
---
Roaming in lowsec and dying to gatecamps? I need to think about it for a moment. :)
---
Svipul ist still in my top 5 ships of zkill, mostly from gate camping. It was such a fun ship.
---
How can you control moons 4 regions away with jump fatigue?
---
I repeat my assertion... for EVE Online CCP has just thrown QA completely out the fucking window. And still, since this is r/eve, the CCP white knights will appear and tell me I am wrong.
---
In the end that will happen, yes. Even if asymmetric warfare was possible again most of the people capable of it have long since left the game.
---
True but there's still reload time and it's non-negligible for dictor bubbles.
---
Lol, f*ck no! It was a wrong decision cause threatening someone IRL over a video game is massively wrong. Has nothing to do with any meta or being the 'underdog' alliance.
---
Can confirm. Many excavs pulled upon decloak. Just need to be on the ball
---
The guys giving out homework assignments!
---
Nice job C0NE!
---
&gt;Speaking only for my corp/alliance and where we live: the game is fine.
---
How many turbocrabs do you have out in rorquals and supers right now though? You're playing the game wrong bro, YOURE PLAYING IT WRONG BRO
---
ggggrrrrrr ccp/falcon/hilmar/mom/etc

Supercaps aren't abundant on the Provi market. :P

Ha, even the new player counts are starting to fall off. GG, CCP, GG.

I have relatives living in Chile and South Africa, both are enjoying high standards of living, specifically in Chile, my cousin informs me that in terms of wealth and living standards it's up there with top EU nations. He's a Scientist so I believe him.
---
We're talking here about people starting fights that are impossible to win in the supercap meta. Obviously OP is saying that people who start fights are good for EVE not that IRL threats are.
---
All is fine. It's just the bots, college students, people on vacation, summer break (which paradoxically ended because look at excuse 1), etc.
---
if you've played lately, fatigue caps at 5h so thats 3 easy back to back jumps with only last jump lasting like 20minutes orange timer, put together that you only need to defend a structure after 2 timers with athanors and you get the answer
---
I get where you're coming from on this, but guy, I've been playing this thing for two days to see what's up, and I shit you not, the "Smart" ripoff race has the same color scheme/aesthetic, even has a ship called the Curse, sound familiar? Aight, let's talk about the tech 2 frigate for the Race that is clearly the Caldari, called the fucking GILA. Can provide screenshots upon request.
---
My guy, there's being inspired or being dirivitive, and there just absolute ripping. 80% of this game, is exactly that - IP theft
---
Wormholes should be scary.
---
See?  Nobody online.  Now you can all safely carrier rat again.
---
I would like equal amounts of intel for defenders and attackers. e.g none
---
I would like jita to be deleted
---
I would like wormholes to be only temporarily habitable and anomaly spawns reduced
---
I would like no supers in lowsec
---
I would like no asset safety 
---
I would like heavier taxes on npc markets
---
I would like only small industry stations allowed in hisec with heavy penalties
---
I would like no high end pve in hisec
---
The problem is that you're not playing them backwards. Take a lesson from rock-n-roll, play them all backwards for a message from Ozzy.
---
&gt; It's not content creators as such it's just FCs.
---
wich group of people do you think most FCs used to come from?
---
You need to join me on comms more often so we can make tu ko tears more often dude
---
And yet many others who did worse than Gigx aren't banned. ie the Mittani and his fanfest sperg.
---
Don't bother. If you are a small alliance, both your isk and fun potential is currently better exactly where you are.
---
I am talking about POS timers. Good luck holding onto your moons 4 regions away with jump fatigue mechanics.
---
Stop acting like you have a clue or a voice for smaller groups. You are trying to feed the narrative eve is dying because changes affect small groups - that is not true. Eve is dying because people like you want an afk farming simulator
---
Fit for my new shiny Sin.
---
No.
---
We have no super umbrella ;)
---
No. I want some intel about dedspace runners, for ganking them. I think I figured it out now and ready.
---
\&gt; If so, please inform the rest of us a couple things  
---
No, but I will inform.  
---
I lost A LOT. I am ok with it.
---
\&gt; When  was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and  what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.
---
Like...every my login when I saw any targets.
---
\&gt; How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.  
---
A LOT. I want CCP to NEVER bring local back.  
---
\&gt; And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.  
---
&lt;1y
---
As you see in my response, I fully agree with that. However, your response seemed to want to explain GigX wrong decision by the super meta which aren't related.
---
What about calling your alliance mates to kill the camps. 
---
You see those camps as a burden, a hindrance. 
---
I see content! But only if people are willing to stop krabbing and do some pvp.
---
Does anyone have a recording? I wanna listen at work 🤗
---
There was once a Goon called Atalama in german community eve boards (dead since end 2017) that was a shittalking legend, I always was on the opposite side and I enjoyed the forum battles with him. I miss the trolling and shitposting of him. This sub here is 3 steps down at least in quality ....
---
Yes but the POS you could only have 1 job running. The Sotiyo you can have as many as you have slots available on all your characters. Also if your structure is being attacked you can cancel your jobs in a sotiyo before it gets RF'd and the materials return to your items hanger which does not drop.
---
ok you are in denial if you ever think that poses are coming back, sorry man
---
Slightly related, I noticed that a verge of collapse wh no longer makes a sound, anyone know if this a bug or part of the *age of chaos*?
---
happy cake day, i like all of those suggestions if they are implemented together
---
Botters when one account gets banned make at least one if not one more to replace it. It's how they make their money dude. If the botters actually did disappear the pcu would look even more dire than it already does.
---
Soo what? That's just an example that some have brains and know how to deal with changes and risk mitigation lol
---
There's also the chance that now that summer has come to an end, students go back to school and all that kind of stuff. 
---
Like yeah it's cool to say ohh look at my pcu, but do you really expect every eve player to log in every day? Some people play once a week, others play every day. Some people play in waves, other treat it like a marathon. And like, it's the middle of the week, it's always low on people.
---
give us back our castles.
---
Alliances and sov holders work their collective asses of to take space, hold it, build it up with new stations, build out those stations and the infrastructure to give the villagers their towns, their places to build and manufacture, they SHOULD have the advantage inside their own space, they SHOULD have better intel in their own space, they SHOULD be harder to deal with in their own space.
---
Current state of the game is bullshit.
---
Dumb argument is dumb.
---
The fact Mitanni wasn't perma banned, just temp doesn't mean GigX shouldn't be.
---
I think that's fine as long as his shitposting doesn't have it's stability significantly disrupted by it.
---
Great for ninjalooting gatecamps :)
---
Taiwan #1
---
The next Goon that cannot adapt to Multibox-AFK-PVE-Farms not 99.9% safe anymore ^^. Nice deployment to Frairie that was lol
---
i like this change ppl wont over use super now
---
All my corpmate told me they are leaving the game because recent change is bullshit.
---
Most of botter (as reported on reddit few days ago) already converted into HS explorer/miner.
---
Classic is already dying and summer is reaching an end.
---
Can we stop twisting the knife and finding excuses ?
---
&gt;Huh I guess on the 15th I can login and claim a region for Fatal Ascension then
---
Finally we can defend Fountain from NPC space. ;)
---
If we could just get like 2k players from each of those nations above, then the numbers would be back up to where they should be.
---
I dont get the negativity OP is recieving in here. Trying out other peoples playstyles is and being able to understand their perspectives is a good thing to do.
---
Yes, but the situation is more complicated than this.            
---
We have :          
---
* nullsec players         
---
* wh players         
---
* lowsec players        
---
* higsec players            
---
on top of this we have           
---
* omega multiboxers      
---
* omega small players &lt;3 acc           
---
* alpha players           
---
* abusers (alpha multiboxers, bots , alpha abusers etc)              
---
Those changes target specific area and type of players aka nullsec and part of lowsec population, while not affecting places like higsec in so big extent and potentially promoting WH space gamplay that base on hunting in K space.     
---
While no one care about "abuser group" the scope of the changes also include 'omega heavy' groups across nullsec and lowsec and no one sane can deny that we losing those players, thus losing subs.      
---
Like you stated the online number drop don't translate to player drop as people don't play every day - so the number of lost players is greater than the online drop.                   
---
For me CCP used a nuke to kill wolfs in the forest.         
---
While the wolfs are gone, the same is with the forest and every thing around is now dying due to fallout.
---
Can I have all our stuff please ? And much water damage from the tears??
---
Sov-Null Inhabitants are less than 35% of the EVE playerbase ... where does your assumption of being a majority come from ?
---
one of the rorqs actually had a cyno fit for what its worth :P
---
I'm primarily a lowsec PVPer but I've done elements of the 'hardcore' carebearing folks do in null and here are my perspectives:
---
Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want? 
---
&gt; A game where skill actually matters again and there are answers to n+1 gameplay.
---
Do you want the game the way it was in May? 
---
&gt; Absolutely not.
---
Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely? 
---
&gt; Absolutely not. However, I do concede that permanent blackout is a hard nerf to those without one. It is impossible for me to effectively deploy my Rorq+22 Hulk setup or a multi-Rorq setup in a blacked out null.
---
Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel? 
---
&gt; Local should have been in a timed mode, not fully WH-like. Honestly it should have been tied to gate/WH cloak. Once you decloak you're in local. Same if you login, you're immediately in local. Thus roamers still get the benefit of being able to tackle shit in the system but cloaky campers cannot lock down the system permanently. (I personally do cloaky camp and would not mind seeing nerfs to that kind of play)
---
What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities. 
---
&gt; I haven't felt compelled to PVE since I came back. I came back to Eve due to blackout.
---
When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.
---
&gt; When I was mining in Drone Lands, my procedure was to siege red and dock the miners. There wasn't much a Rorq can do on whatever skill urself/volta would drop since there wasn't anyone coming to save you. That said, the Rorq was normally fit for combat and I had almost gotten a kill or two from them. Mining in GW, I have killed things with the Rorq while mining. So normally, happy when shit comes in, but not having an escalation path means there isn't much you can do against a group that can drop caps on you. I can see precisely why this drives folks that want to hardcore bear to groups with supercapital umbrellas.
---
How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.
---
&gt; I run a 10 box Malediction fleet and sometimes a 1 Maly+10 Enyo fleet when 'solo' roaming. Before blackout the only kills I got were in Horde space cause they legitimately just AFK ratted, not bot ratted. After blackout, I was able to get quite a few kills but have noticed in some areas (Insmother) are only Rorqs mining and Supercaps ratting. Post cyno change I suspect this will be the same in areas with an umbrella.
---
&gt; The game will die slower, albeit, in a worse fashion. There's a chance that the chaos era can work.
---
Please for the sake of having a conversation, reply -if possible- to all of these, if you just cherry pick what you want, there is not much point.
---
Overall observations:
---
There will never be another WWB or major war unless drastic changes are made to supercapitals (e.g., nerfing EHP) and skill-based gameplay being able to overcome n+1. Even then, no one is going to sit and war with Goons, Test, or Panfam. A war between any of these groups will quickly cause burnout because it takes minimum 4-5 days, in the enemy's preferred timezone, to win a system (Sov status doesn't matter, only citadels do). Most of those fights would be under heavy TiDi. I've stated before that breaking up the big groups with resource scarcity is the only realistic way of bringing potential wars to a manageable level for minimal TiDi (the recent Snuff v GOTG supercap brawl is a shining example of what this game COULD be if we didn't have megacoalitions).
---
Eve has stopped being a hardcore game for many of these groups. When you look at Rust, or Ark, etc. you can literally lose everything overnight being offline. Eve is good, in a sense, that there is some balance against being 'offlined'. However, it is way too much in the safe direction. Groups (skill urself, Exodus, etc.) that thrived in the hardcore mindset have dissolved and the players either moved to one of the larger groups or stopped playing entirely. CCP will seriously have to swing hard in the 'hardcore' direction to bring them back which I think is the idea behind the changes but they aren't enough currently.
---
the most epic eve storylines are from that era so would it really be that terrible?
---
but, they make the same sound
---
Really?  A new player who stayed longer than three days? This unicorn must be safely trapped and studied so we can replicate the procedure to retain new players.
---
Assuming that you aren't flair baiting do you think it's possible that your group and the playstyle it's promulgated over the last several years has been has contributed significantly to the current state of the game?
---
11Sept2019
---
I agree.
---
Yeah I really fucked up with the weapons this time :D Maria died anyways in case you did not notice! &lt;3
---
CCP: Ok that is whack. As part of 'Chaos', we've now disabled docked repairs. This will stimulate the economy by boosting demand for paste and hull repair units. Enjoy!
---
&gt; cucking all other MMOs
---
&gt; cucking
---
If you use that word, you're a retard
---
"Content creators" should take a hands off approach to being the entertainment for their group. Alot of the time you get hundreds of dudes following the same content creator when a bunch of dudes in that group would also be capable of leading.
---
&gt; Every day the entire dev team holds their breath awaiting the first login post downtime.
---
Actually, they are probably some of the most relaxed out there. 
---
Reboots are fucking scary if you never reboot. I spent months fighting issues that started with a reboot.... gee what changed? Beats me the last one was 6 months prior. Turns out, so was the change that caused the issue; it had just been waiting on a reboot to actually be enabled. 
---
Another time, I assisted an operator for the reboot of a machine that had uptimes so long that the last person who even understood the operating system well enough to do much (VMS) had already been promoted to the point that nobody wanted to bother him for a reboot. 
---
If there had been a camera in that data center, it would have captured myself and the senior operator, with our hands in our pockets, doing slow circles around a dead machine on the floor. We were looking for anything, did the power cable fall out? is it loose? Then.... it just came back on and started to boot. It was a tense few moments.
---
Reboots and backups are both things that can break and sit for months before anybody notices, and its always at the worst time when they do, if your process makes sure both are tested regularly.... that's a lot of stress reduction right there.
---
Null is boring af. Try something else
---
I think it's a specific type of druggy or stoner?
---
Well they are brainwashed but when will they kill each other ?  Like with an actual big war with sov changes etc
---
not really since the one single cynohunter that is left just opens dotlan and burns max speed once a System reports a +1 NPC kill.
---
I cant help you, but salute what your trying to achieve. Also dont blue locals, closer the content the better.
---
I krabbed for 20 whole years thank you very much! I deserve to be able to krab safely because I have spent so much on subs
---
I fully support this post(LowSec and NPC-Null with short breaks for the last 8 years)
---
Use cost effective combat ships.
---
Are there NPCs in Null? And can I find them with combat probes?
---
You should really follow the link. Cause you're comment doesnt pair well with reality
---
&gt;any kind of passive income is a bad idea cause that translates to less time in space and more appliance of Malacanis Law
---
Cause it's different now. Local lowsec corps can control the moons.
---
Oh no wait, it's Snuff that hold all of Cal/Gal FW zone.
---
I love ESO, but I am biased because I've been into TES games since I played Morrowind back in 2004 or so..
---
There has been tad of improvement to performance lately, I think they had some patch for that, but it was mostly server side. At least, I don't encounter that much lag in PvP anymore.
---
Anyway, excellent game imo and the quests are really fun. First mmo where I actually cared what the quest givers said.
---
We actually just build T1 indy ships locally on the mid points. That way there's really no time wasted aside from ensuring there's manufacturing slots involved from a couple cyno toons.
---
It's not just bans. 
---
Blackout's had an effect beyond that.
---
I don't mine or rat &lt;3       
---
For me mining should be removed from game same for anomaly stuff.
---
Didnt they change how cynos work recently?
---
I thought only industrial ships can light regular cynos now.....
---
Blops jumping to indy cynos isn't a bug.
---
It's in the patch notes as possible.
---
Maybe we need it for r/eve cause this shits getting old
---
Skill Urself took over the whole of drones with like sub 100 active individuals, Hard Knocks Inc, own/rent out the whole of Cobalt Edge with barely 15 people online at any one time.
---
&gt;     How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 0 Times.
---
Hmm, then you obviously haven't roamed any remote Nullsec region for sure
---
You did this pre blackout /cyno era.       
---
Rorual that can live cannot have speed augmentations now.      
---
Try now.
---
Same tbh
---
I see we are still at the anger phase of grief ...
---
Well why dont do 1 big endwar then blocs going to war with each other but that will never happen because that means they will actually risk something and use those stacked up ships they have and their trillions of isk      
---
Eve will die earlier then that the blocs go into a world war in a formal war declaration/ actually a war that changes some sovs
---
I would often reach out to people in local. Even if it’s just ‘o7’. Now you don’t see anyone and if you talk you’re giving information away.
---
It’s not a good idea to remove a social aspect of a MMO.
---
&gt; Welcome to every day in a wormhole... 
---
Well the problem with that argument is: *we're not playing in a wormhole*. Arguing everything is fine in null because it's like that in j-space as well kind of highlights yet another issue here. Namely that null *becoming* j-space is not a good thing. They are separate things for a reason.
---
&gt; but there are still regional intel/krabbing channels 
---
Yes, but those aren't exactly for socializing. Unless you like having people yelling "INTEL ONLY!!!" at you, those channels aren't really going to help.
---
&gt; But forcing people to communicate more is really not a problem that needs to be fixed. 
---
I don't agree with that. There is a LOT of communicating already going on in EVE. Far more than in any other MMO (or any other game, really) that I've played. I think the implication that people aren't (or weren't) communicating enough is just plain wrong. - Of course there's always one idiot in a group that goes Rorqual mining without being in standing fleet, or on comms, or without any support lined up. But that's not representative of the norm in null. Most people aren't that person.
---
yes, a free base liner...
---
Another great idea to keep the ecosystem alive
---
There are people who will buy LP from you zero thought required for 1000 isk per lp.
---
There are people who will move anything you want in highsec for a laughable fee.
---
The only thing sov null good for is mining/industry.
---
Ratting is NS just isnt worth it compare to what you can make in almost perfect safety of HS.
---
Yes but what exactly those words mean in that order I got no idea.
---
This is true.
---
Everyone in wingspan is a spy it's basically one of our recruiting rules.
---
This is a very bad idea ... hmm are you suggesting that CCP will hire me?         
---
Always wanted to visit Iceland
---
Where does it says, in any of ur quotas, to not log in?
---
Keep titan/super docked may let ppl use those chars to go to fleets.
---
Spinning the narrative, eh?
---
I think the approach of "Take a look at the other side" aint bad. Just look at discussions about game-mechanics and rules. You ll find so many folks there who make "genius suggestions" whichs odds and ends they obviously have no clue about. Or where they openly neglect the interests of all other playing-styles in EVE.  
---
Yeah, Hunters/PvPers want content. Yeah, indies wanna mine/farm/make things and survive. Yeah, ratters wanna rat and survive. Yeah, Empirebuilders want empires built. Fleetcommanders want everyone in their fleets. Each has someone who doesnt want him/her to succeed or has other plans. And that needs to be balanced somehow. And you cant balance something while looking only at one side of the pair of scales.
---
Do you mean the "humming" type of sounds at the half-mass mark? I never noticed a sound at the verge of collapse stage. Unless you mean the sound when you jump through and it goes to VoC, is that what you mean?
---
First of all, dont dare to blame the awesome mentor program from test.. They are awesome and its not their fault.. Back to the topic.. If u want to play golf and buy what you need for, are u going to play minigolf with it? No u want to play golf -&gt; same with super/subs.. I worked hard to get them and now im not able to use it because of some cryholers who cant kill a rorq because thebad friends save it..
---
One who uses freebase cocaine in lines perhaps?
---
Yes diamond rats.
---
I think its more the "there is a moving thingy in my field of vision"-part that annoys me :D
---
&gt; but recently, eve has taken quite a sharp turn onto a path many of us just cannot agree with
---
that sharp turn happened in 2016/17 with the patches Citadel &amp; Lifeblood (Moonmining Rorquals) Before them EVE had 55-60k Logins on Saturday EU prime) At the end of 2018 (long before blackout) we wre down to around 30k logins in the same timeframe. And this while the number of people running huge afk-multiboxes in Nullsec increased massively.
---
Aaahhhhh that makes more sense.
---
Nope. We bombed tons of excavators after the blackout, and many people didn't use drone navs pre-blackout. Lots of people with 300m/s were still able to scoop. For full disclosure the largest rocks do give enough time to ensure one or two drones to die. But one can select the rock carefully and Excavator mine nonafk.
---
An almost 20 year old game is dying. Fucking shocker.
---
Without sounding to condescending, this is exactly why CCP is making the right move. The amount of null bearing has gone sky high, ever since they changed the way ratting worked(in multiple steps). The playerbase has gone way way to complecent, which has been detrimental to the gameplay of 0.0. In effect people has been fostered into the idea of just logging on and ratting, and the gameplay has centered around that idea. So much so, that warfare has gone into being a nuance that is not favoured among many of the players. The result is a dull and boring 0.0 landscape.
---
Hi there Darius,  I saw all the pings in discord and enjoyed getting an update on the action you guys had. Looking forward to seeing you again at the next Eve North my friend. Nice to see you are getting good fights. Still hoping to fly along with you in the future.
---
p.s. I miss the soup dumplings :(
---
This would explain the hordes of people complaining about pcu. They have nothing else to do than watching pcu fall because their leadership prevent them to play their big toys.
---
How about I don't decide to fully commit to a playstyle that I've dabbled in and found not fun? Once you found your niche, you know that's what you want to do.
---
That doesn't mean you can't have empathy anyway. I've been playing this game for long enough that I know people in just about every major group in null, multiple w-space entities and even some lowsec small gangers. 
---
Kind of hard *not* to consider the other side's point of view when you talk to them on a regular basis. But that doesn't mean I'm suddenly going to start buying rorquals or live in the shithole that is Providence.
---
CCP made this mess by doing effectively nothing for so long, the only way to fix it is to actually change some things from the ground up. None of this half assed patching, ship adjusting and so forth. If they aren't willing to gut parts of the game and rebuild them so people undock and play, there won't be any people left.
---
haha yeah so much this. all my eve career i used to do the edge case stuff as an eve profession. CCP has been mercilessly killing those since 07 and you don't see me crying for more then a  couple of days.
---
Socialize while mining.
---
This update reseted this sound option for me on all my accounts
---
It was a weird feeling
---
Go to jita
---
Ok, than you answered correct and all is good. Fly risky o7 ;-)
---
Stfu already.
---
Hey any Goons want to go into business? lol
---
I dont get it.
---
What? It's not about pvp it never was, cynos where nerfed cuz reee supercap umbrella. Roquals where nerfed to the point you might reconsider subcap ratting they are immobile and with all that blackout bullshit the risks outweight the rewards
---
The fact that a 15 year old version of WoW is the current hottest thing on the MMO circuit does not bode well for the genre.
---
It's barely a change. Gameplay is exactly the same. The only difference is perspective so you can see what's going on. You are making it sound very dramatic by saying if would destroy the game, it wouldn't.
---
I agree that it's more complicated than a base stat. That said I dont believe botting accounts for the majority of that drop as bots replace themselves otherwise the issue would not be as prevalent. Do they account for some of the drop yes. But as bots have been banned for years. I also halve the stats of my corporation showing 45 day inactivity on 12 people (more than 120 ingame characters among them) backed by ESI data, and fleet participation data. That's 12 of what was 32 people straight up quitting with a lot of omegas. And 7 of the remaining left for high sec but show inactive for 30 days since leaving. I'm just one corp and I know that it can be different elsewhere. But its painful to watch changes get implemented that are literally killing eve. 
---
As many have said chaos is a bad business practice, people hear that and they go find somewhere to weather the storm. Possibly not to come back. I dont have a major bullet to unfuck the current path but I can say down this road isnt the right path.
---
and they said structure grinding is boring ... pfft plebs
---
Honestly your ship is overtanked if you just do kin/explosive filaments. Swap 1 RLML to a heavy launcher and pop cans with that, then drop a MTU.
---
Yes yes the world is ending, move along ...
---
He means the sound after the voc shrink. It’s a breathing noise the hole makes in the old designs. It’s changed now.
---
I sold a character but still have access to mails,  can view location and ship they are in,  and can see skillplan.
---
I think the issue is less its dying and more that it's being murdured
---
Sure why not?
---
Especially null sec it's the safest place in eve.
---
&gt;2) citadel mechanics to be like pos mechanics, or at least less horrible than they are now.
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
My mentality when it comes to ratting in a Myrmidon or Dominix is not to compare it with “max ticks in a hyperspatial Hel”, but to compare it with the “joy” of going for a solo roam in that same hull. The end result is likely the same, but I’ll probably be up by more than the ship cost.
---
There would have been more conflicts IF CCP didn't make the capital ships easier to get (2011, before they required Battleship V instead of VI and multiple others skills, and modules was also made easier to access) and so CREATED the Capital Proliferation, and IF they remembered the pre-citadel situation before releasing them (a station in nearly each system of the galaxy, obviously if we could do that, then we could create a Citadel Proliferation).
---
Also, having to wait a week to finish off a citadel is too long, POSes didn't have this problem.
---
The ability for the defender to choose when he would defend is also a problem, cf the Panda/Legacy conflict who is stagnant since 6 months !
---
When they were to release the refineries, I tested them on Singularity and I saw that they were TOO generous (best one I saw was 16 B), more than the previous POSes (best one I saw was 8.5 B-10 B, I think). I seriously thought that CCP would nerf them at release. But they didn't......... Even nerfing a bit the moons without changing the repartition would be a good start.
---
In short, CCP think of us like we are still children, incapable to maximize the potential of any of the content they create. But we are EVE players. We brainstorm, we maximize, we optimize... and so CCP do stupid errors because they don't think about what will happen of any move in the long-term. The local/cyno would obviously create not a departure of some players but an hemorragy.
---
CCP released multiple bad things who made the nullsec stagnant. Maybe they can create incensitives to wage wars, but it won't be enough as long as the elements who made any war really slow to advance still remain.
---
tl;dr, historically CCP is the real problem of EVE Online.
---
It's funny that you ask because I actually did work one whole afternoon listening to a "stargate sound" YouTube video, so much chill.
---
Wormholes sound are too weird for me...
---
I'm amazed Darkness were able to form at least 10 dudes.
---
Can you explain to me how its dumb? I see this argument all the time but both issued RL threats and one even did it live in front of a huge audience.
---
Good vid redline o7
---
It's because new games are coming out. Not to mention school just started. And other stuff too!
---
&gt; First of all, dont dare to blame the awesome mentor program from test
---
well obviously if they make new people comit to a single, very specific form of playstyle that also takes enormous amounts of investment without showing up perspectives they, well, just aren´t all that awesome no?  
---
also nobody keeps you from using your super but yourself.
---
Very risk averse choice. Excellent work!
---
Dying sonce 2013^TM
---
I know that smaller rock give better chance of recalling drones. 
---
Like i said to use the spod rocks.     
---
Mining is afk activity, lets be honest about this.
---
Paul is dead.
---
The best in this "work" is your salt dripping from it ....
---
Just keep moving around while ratting so its harder to track. duh.
---
Where's that retard that claimed C0ne would never get another Titan kill?
---
Yeah, I thought that happened after half-massing the hole, not at VoC, my bad.
---
It is not his game any more, it was sold. 
---
PA owns EVE now &lt;3
---
Go to a neutral staging system.
---
A decline in playerbase over the last year doesnt account for it being the end of summer (which historically increases player count post labor day)
---
archaic and antique.
---
You must be new on r/Eve...
---
Nah you need tackle
---
Maybe they are in a band together and live together and his roommate plays the base.
---
My work schedules been all fucked up the last three weeks, hopefully I'll be on line  a little more.
---
The direction your ship is visually facing is irrelevant, if anything that's the biggest lie in this case. Even if you are drifting you can still handle that with the formula, and when I said "given starting heading" I was referring to whatever your movement vector was at the moment you hit Warp, not the direction your ship is pointing.
---
I mean...
---
Check the store under Ark:
---
Ships / Capital Ships / Jump Freighters
---
Open its info page, look under Traits, Ship Characteristics:
---
XL (Primarily fitted with Capital modules) -&gt; this is the trait applied to all capital ships
---
Also Advanced Spaceship Command, although not explicit, is only used for Capital-size ships.
---
Where do you have the information i was talking to a mentor? I dont get it oO
---
Honestly this mentality is the entire problem with the game. I've played for 15 years and just this year bought myself a super. Supers/titans should never have been widely available assets and now that we've reached that point we all know how terrible that game play is.
---
Well, first that comparison goes wrong. Mitanni didn't actually make IRL threats. What he did was wrong and dumb but saying Mitanni and GigX did the same thing is disingenuous.
---
But let's say people did get away with it. My stance on it is that they should have been banned too. However, the fact that didn't happen shouldn't mean that from then on we let everyone get away with it. Imo that would be dumb. So objectively: Make IRL threats, get a perma ban.
---
I think the asian market is fairly healthy for MMOs. But ofc those are "different".
---
Which also reminds me I have not heard about the state of serenity in a while. Besides it being a blue donut bot heaven.
---
Then he would have said bass player. 🤔
---
Instructions unclear my JF is now tackled please help.
---
You yourself said Excavs were a mistake.
---
Now that only pure nonafk Rorquals on small rocks can reliably use them, I don't see what's bothering you here.
---
Tbf Rorquals under umbrellas are the ones that got the least affected farmer group from blackout + cyno restrictions. They are in a good place, if not still low risk.
---
You refute sweeping generalization by making sweeping generalization.  
---
Noted and ignored
---
Sound?
---
cause they couldn't see that trend on a bad metric (DCU) as it was counterbalanced by alt account spam.
---
IMHO amount of logged in PLAYERS didn't siginificantly change much it's just alts and bots not logging in as scalability was hit hard
---
The people that do what you are describing are the people that go hunting for whales. You’re not collecting a head so much as making a trophy out of their ship. There are some folks who spend a fair amount of time hunting folks with AT ships and blingy capitals. But there will never be a bounty hunting mechanic in this game. If you want to chase targets, you gotta make your own road and figure out what you want to do on your own.
---
what did they do? You mean the cyno changes?
---
PA owns CCP. CCP owns EVE. Hilmeth is the CEO of CCP. EVE is Hilmeth’s...until PA sees the drop in revenue and kicks him to the curb.
---
Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal
---
It happens on both. So the way the old holes went were:
---
Initial shrink noise with the physical animation of the hole shrinking
---
You then get the hole breathing. 
---
Then the second shrink with same animation. The hole gets smaller
---
Same exact breathing no change. 
---
It was very easy to interpret. Not sure about the new indicators .
---
&gt;nd hear the noises they make I immediately start see
---
i mean, read the frekin post man xD

you also can change AB and INVUl to passive resist and drop off nosf.

and you can see some activ fits.  some cheap fits used by russian sreame iBeast.  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MXAMpCpnj9trDKSGTBptWZUK9gI28OGKjfc0ehIHgE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15MXAMpCpnj9trDKSGTBptWZUK9gI28OGKjfc0ehIHgE/edit)   
---
He run t5 on this fits on alpha clone.
---
what was the problem back then and what did they change?
---
Be more like the zen master and stop bitching then
---
EVE HAS SOUND?
---
&gt;I would like jita to be deleted
---
Elaborate on this?
---
Well, maybe you shouldn't have screeched for changes that make the only current, viable option to stay docked or logged off then.
---
i know all this already,
---
i have eddited my previous post to read 'approaching' it now reads correctly
---
the game wasn't sold, the company running it was. PA owns CCP but CCP still has free reign over EVE and operates independently from PA.
---
you can safely ignore dave stark. he's the literal definition of a bittervet krab. engaging with him only increases the chance of a headache.
---
Wow didnt really start bleeding till the first cataclysm patch dropped at the end of wrath.
---
I disagree it wasn't an RL threat but I if you can't see it that way I won't be able to convince you. Its weird your saying he should have been perma banned but since he wasn't its all ok as long as all future rl threats are banned? You see how it looks like you are saying two different things at once?
---
He also said "room mate" and not roommate...maybe there is more meaning to this...
---
i think you mean to comment these on the OP's post. not me, this entire post OF HIS starts with talking about audio. ?
---
I agree with you.. But do you think that cyno changes adress the problem? If they would like to see less crabbing they probably should do something with the sites or the payouts or the amount of ore? The cyno changes hits pvp at least in the same negative way they change the pve aspect.. Maybe i just dont get it v0v at the end it doesn't matter everyone who likes munnins online can go on.. I wont..
---
Fly safe.. Or dangerous.. What every u like x)
---
It's perfectly fine for T3 exotic, you can also drop the DCU for a third DDA or C3-A/C3-X Ballistic Control for more clear speed.
---
Since you are using an afterburner, consider a tractor beam instead of the drone link in high slot, to help with faster looting, unless you are using a mobile tractor. Not sure about the drone skill level, if you absolutely need the range then keep it. I found ~50-55KM to be just fine for most pockets.
---
Just one thing: Vespa II does marginally more DPS than Caldari Navy Vespa, but CN Vespa is miles ahead in EHP. Consider switching, you won't lose any after that unless you really ignore them.
---
Buddy, you need to chill the fuck down. This is no way to talk about people.
---
botters stop botting when it becomes unfeasible, like it is now in nullsec
---
that's so cute you think they won't have any influence on their $400m investment
---
*sigh*
---
Kinda true but backpaddeling in the way ccp is doing it now wont make it any better i think.
---
holy shit this
---
&gt;PCU is literally everything
---
Please do show us the part where your lone neuron thought it read anything like that.
---
Holy shit why are the Chinese dragging so much nationalism and ethnocentrism into EVE? Just goes to show that some of these Chinese players completely looks down on the rest of the world.
---
Yes, poopsock and alarm Clock for my enjoyment nullcrabs. Fight in the worst sov system ever designed.
---
Because I'm trying to work on my Eve career. Not all of us can find as much joy picking off ratters/miners.
---
What?
---
I agree with you the changes thus far are just desperate low effort attempts to shake things up instead of doing any actual balancing or new content.
---
You're a special kind of stupid aren't you. Go grind it yourself.
---
I think someone did the reasearch and Thursdays are usually the lowest day of the week for PCU and Sundays the highest so it will probably been even lower today.
---
To be fair, nobody really believe bots went away. They're just either doing something else (Highsec missions, low tier abyss, exploration, etc...) or just reshipped to myrm (even without the cloak bug).
---
This number cannot be explained only with bots, nor WoW classic or whatever. Some of it can, though.
---
are you fucking dumb, like seriously.
---
read the mans post at the top. he talks about audio. which if you didnt know is sound.
---
he says the sound the wormhole makes is in his nightmares, 
---
i am pointing out that the sound that a wormhole makes currently is the same as it always has been.
---
i know this from the patch notes. it said they were not changing the sound.
---
and here we are, me explaining a post to a guy who cant even understand small sentences about what hes literally talking about himself. fuck man, shiiiiit
---
Yes, that is what I do, ratters and miners..
---
No Charlotte. No. 
---
In conclusion, eve career .. lol. hahahahha. Hilarious.
---
What sweeping generalisations have I made, fuckwit?
---
Nigeria and south Africa are the wealthiest African countries in terms of GDP?? This is not a sweeping generalisation, it's a fact. Look it up. Calling India a third world country is stupid, as it has a fucking space program (these ain't cheap). The issue lies in the division of wealth, similar to Brasil on that note. Japan was also on OP's list. Japan is not a third world country by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Do you need me to hold your hand to help you do some research? Since you clearly know nothing about the countries OP mentioned.
---
I think both shrink and VoC noises are absent now, I won't miss the "Chanting Monks" we used to get after half mass, but some indication it has massed is needed. We now have to check the info text all the time to be certain.
---
Also, part of wormhole life is getting hole watch duty, watching a hole for hours on end that now makes the noise of concord landing played through a broken speaker, really really mind fucking. Most people are just gonna zoom out and thus miss jumps.
---
Idfk why man go put up your own thread on this if you want an answer
---
the only answer a dumb faggot can put online and not seem thick :) .. one more for good luck, go on
---
Like Gigx, sure. Gigx, no.
---
I just don’t care if there is a bomber cloaked in system with me or not. The potential for sudden danger is part of the draw. I’ve been the bomber pilot enough times before to know how frustrating it can be if you don’t make it easy. Don’t sit still at zero. Don’t orbit in a highly predictable fashion. Have at least one person in your group watch the entrance to your pocket and another watch hostile staging area. Chit chat with your friends on comms and stag engaged with each other.
---
To me,  good leaders in Eve should always be around. They should always communicate. Set the example. If you expect your members to be undocked and active in space, the best way to ensure that is to be undocked and active in space.
---
Orca fit?
---
Yeah that sucks. I loved the fact that you could interpret most statuses of a hole visually and audibly without immersion breaking text checks.
---
Or whatever, fuck it, the best content in the game comes from people who hate each other. More hate please.
---
You might not last here bud. Calm down miner.
---
that's the joke
---
Can you adjust the skill plan still? If so, that’s even more disturbing.
---
There's nothing stopping you taking sov now, mate. Basically everything outside of the 3-4 big supercap umbrellas hasn't been maintained in weeks. Most of it is ADM 2.0.
---
The problem is, of course, that nobody *wants* sov now. Because it's practically worthless, outside said umbrellas. Mining and ratting there has become a very low-income + high-effort thing, so everybody has moved their ISK making to other things. And being able to upgrade the ihub for better mining/ratting anoms was basically the only reason small groups even took sov in the first place. Not sov is just a worthless flag in space.
---
But, like I say. If you really want sov, there's plenty of vulnerable space out there. And few people will put up more than a token defense at this point. Not worth the resources.
---
at least i reply with comments suited to what it is im replying to.
---
at least im not sending an comment i should have sent to the op, but instead sent to somone else because i didnt read the post at all (or understand it)
---
Incarna was another of hilmars great decisions that brought in walking in stations that nobody asked for, along with the nes shop with ridiculous pricing, doubled by hilmar the day of release. He's quoted as saying when told it was a bad idea by other employees in the room "you have no balls". A large portion of the player base quit to the point ccp had to have emergency meetings with the CSM and players to try and right the rapidly sinking ship.
---
CCP soundwave was a newer dev recruited from the playerbase(goons) who had a little black book of problems players had that he'd been collecting for a long time. When CCP were desperately looking around for a fix to the dwindling player base he offered his book as a solution, CCP implemented many things from soundwave and that patch is widely regarded as one of the best eve ever received.
---
drop one extender for scram then
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk)
---
IIRC, the problem was walking in stations, monocules and Greed is Good.
---
I don't know how they fixed it. I was riding my bike.
---
This takes actual work and cannot be turned on or off with the flip of a switch. Not interested, thanks anyway.
---
Just sounds like a microwave to me.
---
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
It's not just that bots have been banned. 
---
Bots have been made significantly less valuable. And there's a point where you stop using them. Blackout has had an effect there.
---
I just tried, yes I can. Start and stop training, if they are offline. For me it is just an amusing "peep" moment, but should definitely be fixed.
---
Replace the extender rigs for purgers, replace the damage control with one of the DDA/ballistic control hybrid mods.
---
We all know whats coming.
---
The widot of Darkness into init mercenaries. 
---
How much dick sort will then need to suck to convince Sister to allow his corp into actual init is unknown.
---
Also WoW classic, didn't want those krabs anyway and PCU doesn't actually matter.
---
lol it was a metaphor. Elo seems like a competent FC. I'd say he's a decently skilled pilot and leader. But he doesn't have a lot to work with it seems.
---
When we yell insults at strangers they are those we most fear of ourselves. I don’t think you are dumb. I do know that you missed the joke at the beginning ( eve has sound is an old joke) but it’s ok.
---
Been there done that more than once  got shit on by several big entities with their caps and huge fleets   or by renters that cried to their overlords and then bang 80 to 140 man fleets on us
---
Yea they do. FC and Content Creator are exactly the same thing.  That's my point.  We had lots of them we now have little of them that's why eve is the state is.  
---
Makulu
---
Supertwinkey
---
Shadoo etc all gone never really replaced 
---
Vince Draken
---
Only ones now are and they sort of having their.own thing.
---
Elo Knight 
---
Pro God
---
The players have changed eve has changed.  We need to get back great fc content creators but I honestly think it's too late.  Why because we simply scare off new player retention to fill that gap with this constant htfu  let's scam everyone attitude.  I dont think that rhetoric for 10 years ago has a place in eve anymore
---
You seem confused. You disagree but then say you agree Mitanni didn't make a RL threat.
---
You could convince me if you had evidence Mittani make a RL threat. Unfortunately for you, that doesn't exist. For GigX that evidence is there and was live-streamed to however many people.
---
As I said, I think everyone who makes RL threats should be banned. That should be an objective decision for each case, disregarding what happened before.
---
Can we stop being toxic cunts and personally attacking devs? Like holy shit what do you think you're doing, do you *want* them to hate us?
---
There are plenty of space for smaller alliances. Those who want it already have it...
---
no, go away.  
---
- wormholerBTW
---
It's not worth now, but it will worth after supercap era will end ;-)
---
Fire and explosions.
---
The first to drop caps may win the fight, but they will feed a recon to do it.
---
Sucks to suck?
---
I mean across my 2 or 3 scanning characters it would be 5 if I could pool them, but each individually has it to like 4.
---
Yeah not like US or Russian players would ever do this
---
There is also the option to send mail to Corp or alliance, but do not want to get buyer into trouble.
---
Im not confused. I said I disagree with you that it wasn't an RL threat. Telling a person to kill themselves is a threat. Plain and simple.
---
I have trouble believing more than a third of the online accounts were bots.  (Though I'm sure part where)
---
You forgot a few of these ........ ,,,,,,,,
---
Ah, in that case. Yes, we do disagree on that.
---
To be fair-a LOT of people wanted walking in stations. The implementation was horrid and poorly timed, which among other things, lead to players getting hella mad.
---
You think supercap era will ever end ?   Its one of the reasons eve suck these days
---
After the losing side quitting or migrating to TQ (biggest groups should be Frat and in goons) the winning side did basically the same (mango army).       
---
I think they still maintain their dominant position on serenity, but without any contestants that can't be too exciting.      
---
So what's left can't be much more than "unimportant (in the grand scheme of things)" groups and bots.
---
Seconded. Within the context of a proper frigate fleet the Damavik really shines as a logi frig that can output decent DPS, especially if you're going toe-to-toe with something big, such as a carrier.
---
&gt; to avoid any danger of getting warped off is to burn up
---
Isn't the easier solution not to accept random fleet invites?
---
&gt; Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want? 
---
Well, I want more players.
---
More targets.  More fun.  More pointy bits on a phantasm.
---
Quafe Zero, Pyrolance IV's and sexier exotic dancers.
---
New players to know that the Mittani himself indulges in over use of the tilde and knife twisting.
---
I want more alliance thefts and backstabbing.
---
I want a procedural way to make PVE more engaging to prevent bots from running any type of anom.
---
I want system wide cyno jammer changes.
---
Bomber cloaking counterplay.
---
I want a organic fights to break out all over New Eden and not arranged fights, and I want less blues and NIPS that last three years.
---
Goodnight.
---
It made sense at the time to say that
---
Regardless 
---
I told him to burn up. He didn't
---
r/eve is nothing but cry-baby whiny nullsec krab bitches
---
Hes just salty because he still doesn't have his gate to Stain yet
---
No u
---
Not a lie.  This is a true account of what we heard on Teamspeak last night.
---
Thank you Hilmar and falcon for the black out , I love it , it makes killing the noobs who mine all day all that much easier , I’ve resubbed all 5 of my accounts and am in full hunter mode - long live the era of chaos ❤️👍
---
There is no reason for the blocks to go to war. No resource imbalance, no big grudges, nothing. At least not big enough to deal with the horrible sov system and citadel spam we currently have.
---
Fix that and im certain the number of players will double
---
Was it Jaws, Voiceover, narrator, or thunder?
---
I’m blind and these are screen readers I’ve used.
---
Hilmar isn't a dev. He's the CEO. If he had a firm grasp of game development, we likely wouldn't be in this mess.
---
With 70% of dev's working on the NPE, they'll put  something out soon(tm).
---
Not really, no. Supercaps don't really affect ratting and mining outside the umbrellas. So even if supercaps get nerfed into uselessness, the income-vs-effort ratio for non-umbrella areas will still remain the same. - That is: you don't get *more* ISK for subcap ratting in Catch just because a super can't rat in Delve.
---
Weirdly enough the way skills worked appealed to me when I started playing (in 2012).       
---
I was still playing wow casually after raiding for years and the idea of my character progressing even if I don't feel like playing for a week held some merit to me.       
---
And when I knew that today is the day I finally could not enter but reasonably fly my new XY, that was just like the old rush wen I got my first epic in Molten Core back in the day.
---
Apparently the majority of new players sadly feel different.
---
Nope, we are telling the truth and hopefully he will wake the fuck up, it is very apparent that he reads r/eve anyway
---
There is always a cloaky Proteus chasing you in wormholes
---
&gt;Bots have been made significantly less valuable. And there's a point where you stop using them
---
Or you run more to compensate
---
I’d bug report that ASAP if I was you.
---
You are never going to get your gate.  So stop posting   !
---
I absolutely agree.  What CCP have done have made supers and titans outrageously cheap and made them in just massive pvp ships that now anyone can afford.  Someone dropping a 1000 titans (cough goons) is just ludicrous.  They need actual mothership type roles.  But it's too late.  They need to make them harder, longer and more expensive to build.  But then we have a zillion titans suddenly worth 100bill again in an instantly. Same with Citadels are outrageously cheap too. Its absolutely mental.
---
I mean how the hell did a titan go from 100b to 40b for the hull? How.....
---
Where has the sense of awe gone in eve.
---
I saw a full fit hel selling for 16.5 the other day.
---
Fuxk off !
---
No you're just being toxic cunts, and if anything will make him act more spiteful than you think he is.
---
If it is not working as intended, tell everyone it is.
---
I think everyone reading this thread should deliver OP a venture in the closest citadel.
---
You're obtuse. 
---
In future, stay away from subjects you know nothing about.
---
Nice kill
---
Oh, that makes it much better. Toxic cunt away!
---
The problem really is that we min max'd all the fun right out of the game. It's a part of the human condition. For instance, wars in the past used to be a ton of fun. Everyone would just line up and get a turn shooting at the enemy. Look at the shit we have now, America is basically goons bosoning everything before it has the chance to even jump the gate.
---
Curious where my Rorqs I still have in some citadel out there will end up when Darkness closes its doors... Maybe they re not lost to me after all.
---
They do but at least in the US or Europe you'll be called out for it and not absolutely shit on for doing so.
---
Faction warfare
---
Uh, I can see the kb and yea, looks like eve career to me.
---
Tbf it's just better to have webs and multiple point/scram, you get all your mids when you hull tank
---
Why would I try someone else's playstyle when theirs is wrong and mine is right? smh
---
They mostly hear that from others, I think.       
---
When I started other people already had a 9 years head start.        
---
I didn't expect to really mesh with them until later. I was surprised when my first Corp took me out and made me feel relevant even in PvP after only a few weeks.
---
I claim that a huge problem is the perception starters get conveyed.       
---
The NPE could always be better, but instead of trying to mitigate the rocky start, large parts of the community keep putting new players off.
---
I’d watch playing your hands in a card game with him tbh !
---
Or covert haulers.  I just mentioned blops because blops seeding would only require the standard two characters vs. three.
---
I actually like Hillmars ideas and the need to shake things up for the future of eve. Not all of us hate him!
---
So I will say this: my alliance is moving into Null space in large part becuase of all these changes. 
---
Cyno changes means that we can actually fly and have fun without the risk of being dropped by some bored/scared Null bear. The umbrellas basically made Null unplayable for independent small groups.
---
Blackout means there is an actual sense of danger, which excuse me *is the fucking point*. We didn’t join eve to afk rat while I go do something else. It also makes scouting more important and something you actually have to do well. 
---
All I can say is that to the smaller groups that are trying to generate content, this looks like the chemo that is curing the cancer.
---
yes, and that joke should have been sent to the OP. not my comment. i know the 'joke'.
---
you post, its dumb and in the wrong place.
---
i reply politely, you continue to not understand your speaking in the wrong place.
---
i explain to you that you are being silly and dumb, please notice this and correct your mistake.
---
you then post a low quality pun to wind somone up and infuriate.
---
i reply with an equally low quality insult, and further do my best to point you in the right direction
---
you continue to misunderstand, state it is infact ME WHO IS WRONG in what im saying LOL. say i fear you, i think, im not sure your wording is as bad as my punctuation. and here we are, a dumb confused reddit pro vs a guy who simply posted to an OP, talking about sound in eve.
---
I mean I can see some similarities between abck then and now, but I think overall Eve is in an acceptable state mechanics wise. Although I'm not sure what to think of the cyno changes, no local in null on the other hand I think was a good idea (then again, the rewards should probably be a bit higher for those who run sites in null now)
---
Im one of the noobs who dont know better ha.
---
&gt;Tbf Rorquals under umbrellas are the ones that got the least affected farmer group from blackout + cyno restrictions. They are in a good place, if not still low risk.                   
---
If the rorquals in the umbrellas were the issue and honestly they were the target of those changes ... then why implement something that have minimal effect on the real issue but kills all other things?
---
hull tank fails often.
---
&gt;Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want? 
---
a fair balanced game with one side not getting the advantage over the other
---
&gt;Do you want the game the way it was in May? 
---
No i don't want the game as it was in may but i also don't want this one sided game.
---
No, but there needs to be a game play for them.
---
&gt;Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel? 
---
No, -but i would like away that i am able to work for said intel i also don't want the free intel when hunting once again a fair and balanced game. 
---
&gt;How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels. 
---
how do you know they are bots and not active players? this is one of the issues i have, they warped must be a bot, they didn't warp must be a broken bot. Bots really have become a boggyman in eve and i wish ccp didn't have this 3 strike rule find that you are botting ban no coming back
---
&gt;And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era. 
---
I see the issue as being we have done the blackout and looks to burned a number of players.  to me and others the issue isn't the black out it is the one sideness of it.  If ccp had done an active intel tool and the black out together i don't think this would be an issue but it was no intel to you all intel to the hunters now.
---
Go away.
---
I’m sure players will find plenty of other reasons not to fight even if CCP adds all those things.
---
Make sure you keep your mouthguard well polished my dear White Knight.
---
Complete nonsense.  Nullsec alliances currently do nothing to hold their space or take new space.  Most of them have more space than they need and since taking space now requires months of grinding structures with no real pay-off no one is at risk of having their space invaded.  You are right though, current state of the game is bullshit.  It's still too safe IMO.
---
Every year this has to be said and every year it makes me sadder.
---
Not sure what's wrong with your setup then.. we exclusively hull tank bait and it works fine
---
ofc ccp can, but they choose not to. Wonder why......
---
Ok now serious question. Are you Australian? ^(wondering how to interpret this 'cunt')
---
You should probably explain what DKS is for the people who may not be in the loop about the TEST SIG.
---
The amount of tears from these changes, however temporary, have made the game much more entertaining. People getting creative to vent their salt is just icing.
---
 should have fitted a cyno on that titan :kappa:
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Pretty clear targeted harassment and vote brigading he has 4 posts and did the same 12 hours ago with a similar image again got about 20 upvotes and even bought himself some gold. This breaks at least two of the sub rules one of them written in bold at the top of the list.
---
Just use the report button.
---
So you think a CEO shouldn't be taken accountable when his game is going to shits?    
---
You think Zuckerberg shouldn't be isolated when we speak about how Facebook is now?
---
I think it's the one of the only person in a company that should be, as opposed to "devs".
---
Have you seen how fast the newer ships rip things apart these days?      
---
The timeframe you have to actually get help in has significantly decreased.
---
~Hey PA bosses. 
---
We accidentally killed our main product, but it is ok CCP is intact and we can continue our normal operations, just without EVE~
---
Disappointed that you didn't answer "Who?" or "HTFU".
---
It's okay you can say fuck on the internet
---
Eh?
---
Typical Goon line-member.  Complete and utter shit.
---
The whiners either forget or ignore the fact that the game was getting stagnant and the population was dropping slowly, much before blackout. Blackout and the release of WoW Classic means people find an excuse to stop playing and 'stick it to CCP', but it's mostly skill injected supers/titans/rorqs and pve-only players throwing a tantrum.
---
The game is on a downward spiral.  One reddit thread compared it to a patient with a terminal disease, and CCP is trying "Chaos" as the "experimental treatment".  Lots of excuses and scapegoats will be used  for Eve's demise;  reddit,  injectors, etc...  but the real reason will be CCP and Hilmar.  Eve is under their control, their leadership, their development.  CCP has failed miserably for 16 years with the NPE and in the last two month's releases, what drastic improvements have been made to keep new players?  
---
 Lots of sticks and no carrots so far, but I'm sure that's all part of the plan.   /s
---
I don't agree with the statement, but I think the edit is funny. What do?
---
It's one thing to call him a dumbass, it's another to post shit like this. Glad someone is calling this shit out.
---
Meh.....all these daily graphs and eve is dying posts are getting rather dull
---
Doesn't matter what I am. Stop whining and quit already.
---
TBH i hope they will be back for short time, have like 2000 cit bombs for sale
---
Yes they do in part address the problem. I expect there to be more fights under umbrellas now as responses are no longer instant.
---
He prolly had shitty cheap implants, and pulling them makes him not look so bad...
---
My theory anyway
---
2018: the year that the Romans finally had to stop oppressing Loretta.
---
Fuck off, goon. Plenty of people are happy and content with the game and the recent changes. The only whiners are risk adverse pve-only krabbers.
---
Where can I do that?
---
I sent it to you because you seem like you need a friend
---
Most other gaming subs are about accomplishments, cool shit and making new gaming friends. This sub is just a bunch of man children crying about change. I 100% agree with you, stop shitting on devs.
---
&gt;Doesn't matter what I am.              
---
Are you a bot?      
---
'who' - person       
---
'what' - item         
---
????
---
You will be waiting a long time.
---
NOPE, just want dumb shit sent to the people its meant for
---
They remind me of the converted radio waves from Saturn recorded by Cassini. https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/17359/spooky-sounds-from-saturn/
---
There's a difference between criticism and between personal attacks. "Hilmeth", calling him crazy, and so much fucking more disgusting stuff is way over the line. You'd think instead of being an older more mature playerbase that it's a bunch of 12 year olds throwing a temper tantrum.
---
It was meant for you buddy.
---
I have a better idea
---
how about another apocrypha? 
---
you know, the best expansion ccp has ever released?
---
Incarna was different because it didn't actually break gameplay. It was annoying and stupid, but at the end of the day, when you undocked, it was still the same game.  That's why CCP was able to recover from it.
---
I don't know about this release.  At the very minimum, they are going to need to iterate on the cyno changes, and that's just going to piss off everyone who isn't pissed off now. CCP kinda backed themselves into a corner here.
---
incorrect, the question you posted was clearly meant to be directed TO SOMEONE STATING EVE HAS SOUND
---
which i did not.
---
I mean.. someone was showing interest in the game on the sub, and people were telling him to *not pay attention to the sub*. Such disgusting behavior coming from adults.
---
&gt;plain and simple
---
Not for everyone apparently since I genuinely disagree. How is that line a threat? An insult, okay, but a threat?
---
It's just a shitty troll account he has 4 interactions on Reddit.
---
I have been doing this to. But I only find data site and relic site which are not safe. There is enemies in all of them. Have I misunderstood something?
---
the counterplay against cloaky ships is the fucking infinite supers in your umbrella, retard
---
Maybe he thinks mittens sells bread ?
---
You thought someone would log into the account of a man who died 7 years ago to clear bounties?
---
Now half those noobs have to move into a garbage unfun nullbloc and the other half quit, all of them refusing to give in to pearl abyss expectation of them  spending excessive amounts of money for no good reason.
---
You quit too because doing more damage than can be replaced is unsustainable and your playstile was soon reinstated only for those that are actually skilled enough to play it.
---
You could also try roaming in delve and dying to bosons. Have fun! :)
---
It is unfortunate that you found your niche in this way.
---
People throwing a temper tantrum and playing something else out of protest.
---
i heard flying a nano super is like flying 50 nano cruisers at once
---
Yes. Pilot ejects from iki.orca scoops iki. Iki safe

Well it worked, so there!!!

Thank you

Go tell your boss to kill themselves in front of your entire office. I will await the results.
---
The changes didn't have minimal effect on umbrella regions. Mining in top 20 null regions gone from 35t value in March to 10t value last month. With cyno changes it will be supressed a bit further and capital ratting will follow a similar pattern. We're only beginning to reach a sustainable macroeconomy.
---
What bothers me and what was overkill is the situation which subcap ratters/miners are under right now. I believe CCP can fix their problems by moving their activity behind acceleration gates but that requires significant devtime to do so. And without a solution here the next best thing is meeting at a middleground solution for blackout/local.
---
Didn't that turn off wormhole splash? Or is that a different sound setting?
---
The imperium already made guilds, a while ago. You're late to the party.
---
And yet, it's about the only thing going on to talk about.
---
Well said, very well said.
---
You cannot do it through the app. You have to do it through the big report function on the CCP website.
---
so you post a picture, (as fully expected btw) of me stating that the new wormhole changes in eve, make no different sound than before. theres no NEW audio, 
---
ive never even heard it myself, so i cannot confirm whether or not there is, or is not sound in eve, but the wormholes changes, if they do or do not make a sound or not, make the same sound, either way.
---
OP states he has nightmares about the ''SOUND A WORMHOLE MAKES''
---
this my little padawan, is where your comment should have been directed.
---
What sort of dps do you get from that?
---
Also, if anyone can answer, what sort of dps would you be looking and wanting to reach to clear t5s? I understand tank is important as well however I am under the impression that being able to blap the rats quickly is more important than having ultra tank
---
Holy fuck I wish I had isk to buy some to flip later when they calm down.
---
Seriously where/how are you hunting?!! If you want some tips Lorenzo don’t be afraid to ask xx
---
Ok, today after work I will.
---
I, for one, find it really interesting. In RL History there were several attempts by empires to legitimise themselves as only true home country of one ethnic group. Like Russian Tzars thought they were only rightful rulers of all Eastern Slavs, and more.
---
I find it amusing to what degree Eve mirrors real life. 
---
Two Chinese groups arguing who holds a sort of "Mandate of Heaven" (I know this term means something a bit different in RL, but I couldn't not use it). I agree that nationalistic sentiments should no weight in game, but it once again proves that even though in game we are capsuleers, behind the screens are are still humans, and we behave as such.
---
Should we tell OP GSF doesn't even own Goonswarm name in Eve?
---
Goons don't want to make content, they want to undock, right click jump to, and hit F1.
---
lol :)
---
Well thats the point.. This is not true.. But let me guess ur a wormholer? The umbrella will be intact after a shifting phase.. Mostly this changes hurt the possibility of escalate into a cap/supercap brawl..funny how  U guys really think there are alot of ppl ratting in a 20b ship without an umbrella..
---
Same thing people want in real life: maximum power for minimal effort. And to never lose, even if it's dull as fuck.
---
:(
---
Praise this one. Praise him.
---
And I certainly welcome that sir 😀
---
My playstyle is not logging in, so reversing that means I actually have to log in. Nice try CCP, nice try!
---
It's just a fleshwound.
---
splash you mean jump sound? then no, the most important sound is still there :)
---
What sort of dps do you get in that fit? Apologies if it shows in the video I'm watching on mobile and it's not clear on my terrible phone
---
:clown:
---
Just negative
---
How is it being murdered? The most common complaint I see is about the black out. And I started playing around the same time that blackout started.
---
The game is on a downward spiral because CCP doesn't give a shit about EVE. The money made from EVE was not being used on actually improving or fixing EVE for a very long time, and sunk into hilariously ineptly run projects like Dust and World of Darkness.
---
CCP needs to diversify but it appears that their corporate structure/culture/management is extremely poor, and EVE survives in spite, not because of CCP. That gets a pass in EVE since it's really the only offering in a niche market and has a dedicated fanbase that will continue shelling out money regardless of what CCP does. But if they try to bring their shitty organization into the much larger and competitive FPS market against companies like DICE and Respawn that weakness will make itself very apparent.
---
What CCP needed to do was to focus on EVE while fixing their corporate and culture problems, and only start expanding into other fields once they have their organization in shape and not fall flat immediately because they are not competitive.
---
Well zam has been very helpful.
---
It was for you my little pigglet, because you comment looked so lonely and i thought i might brighten your day with a joke about eve having sound. The OP was actually really good so i did not want to get into the up and down votes with an (eve has sound meme) . so, as I did not see one already posted , I saw that you were on the bottom of the stack with something innane like "well tekuncly it is the same nose" and thought i might get a little fun injected into your comment.
---
That’s just not the case. A quality pilot is worth 10 F1 pilots
---
Bullshit.
---
 CCP is doing their bidding, just look at how EVE, from the awesome player driven game it was became just an artificial cash cow milked for every penny.
---
Yeah, the cyno changes is a bit difficult for me to come to a decision to. On one hand it might decrease the effectiveness of super umbrellas on the other hand there could have been other ways of achieving this and even do so more effectively I'd say
---
LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!
---
This gets a nice little downvote lol
---
&gt; Many players think that the CSM shows up in Reykjavik with a printout of a big proposal that was posted to the forums or Reddit and makes CCP read it.  That simply doesn’t happen.  There are no manifestos pinned to the front door of CCP.  
---
Consequently many campaigns are built on the premise of the candidate doing this very thing.
---
nowhere in the past  month, since i got bored of empty space :) now I just armchair dev on r/eve like all the cool kids whilst I wait for the game to die or CCP to undo their mistakes
---
Ironically, Exookiz did this via PowerPoint.
---
Sounds like this feature is working well. Originally, wormholers are taught to act as if there is ALWAYS a cloaky watching you.... But now the wormhole itself is ALWAYS watching you. 
---
always.

Who cares?

---
That is the most unrelated point you could possibly make. Also, the effect would be pretty similar if I would insult then in a similar situation
---
mission failed
---
indeed, it seems to me that nullsec logisticians find the role so tedious and unrewarding because jump freighters have essentially bypassed all the things that could make it somewhat interesting and rendered irrelevant some many economic and strategic aspects of nullsec.
---
The last place prots are worth a damn in PvP. Honestly do people still like them? They seem even more pointless now.
---
Buy a plex a day keeps the name krab away 👍
---
People keep telling me its unrelated but how? Its the same thing. You are threatening someone to take their life. US courts have ruled if you encourage a suicide you are just as responsible.
---
Crucible was awesome
---
Then maybe those ships should be balanced so that they are more in line with other ships in their class?
---
At this point, I just use the isk I earned during my time to have fun ingame. Should easily last until the server shuts down
---
What Exookiz presented was a "state of wormholes" set of facts. 
---
He did not present a proposal for changes.
---
PVPVE aka npc sotiyos
---
I second that
---
What about structures and notiffications when structure is being under attack or has entered reinforcement timer?
---
Please add that
---
No offense but that sounds terrible. 
---
Question to you: Changing your playstyle from the grr-PL to Provi, how have you found provi? Did you make this change prior to the blackout? Or did you make the change almost at the same time? If you moved before the blackout, how is life on that side of the fence? Do you/did you interact with Provi leadership?
---
You seem to be severely misunderstanding the situation, friend. This is not the end of supercap ratting, just a pause while they practice the new meta.
---
Hey dont judge my bojack horseman theme song ringtone

i take fights willingly man but i dont feel like looking up killboard in my phone tbh/remain docked aint nobody got time for that shit

i never really found them so op success for bots, i just stay away from botlands  
---
meh 2-4 years i guess
---
I didn't login the game for quite some time now, what is the mess you referring to?
---
And you want your cute little micro gang to be able to kill the largest ships in the game from the largest group in the game with absolute impunity...
---
So who’s right?
---
Dunk's Corner is always great. My friend and  I have stepped away from EVE for a while to play Ark but will return one day.
---
&gt;Damn, I've been meaning to play that game, I hear it's pretty good.
---
Give it a shot, the core game is free to play. It's not dead by any means and the layoffs that people keep on saying had no effect on GW2, it was people working on other projects not related to GW2.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.

Bruh, within a couple of days of the Mango announcement that they were moving to TQ, they had bot venture fleets up in caldari highsec that became ice bots near Osmon once they had the isk for the injectors.
---
Lol ok dad
---
Oh I think not. ;)
---
There are so many things I can do as an alpha rather than industry. I can roam with cheap ships, gate camp, and not worry about pvp. Without skilling implants, I don't need to worry about being podded. Alpha cloning does sound like an interesting playstyle.
---
thx mate i didnt even think about that just checked gsf forums
---
I agree with all of those points. One caveat being make passive mining an option if you'd rather not mine it.
---
If I may ask, bc I don't remember now lol, did you invite his Avatar first or did you try the other Avatar first? If he did the smart thing and rejected, would you have tried inviting my Erebus?
---
There is risk averse and then there's stupid and suicidal. There's quite a difference between the two.
---
You're bashing a corp that's known for regularly engaging roughly 3 to 1 odds or worse (just look at the involved pilots in that battle report, it's 10 vs 25).
---
There's nothing risk averse about putting yourself in a position like that.
---
But most people are too lazy to pvp in any manner that requires effort and get upset when someone who puts in the effort runs rings around them in faster ships and doesn't sit still to get slaughtered by superior numbers.
---
"But but but...i should be able to catch and kill them in my ship that is at least 3 ship classes bigger (and slower), because it's more expensive". No you should not, that's the whole point of having diverse classes in the game, to create rock-paper-scissors gameplay. Bring a couple of friends in tacklers and learn how to play one. Arguably, it's one of the most skill intensive (and i'm talking about real player skill, not character SP) things you can do in the game.
---
I am a nullsecer who bases out of a wormhole. 95% of my time is spent in null. 
---
Yes the umbrella will be intact. But without an instant cyno they will have to be organised. There is now counterplay available to aggressors but I doubt you are involved in offensive strategy for your alliance and so I don’t expect you to fully grasp the changes
---
You stopping worrying about everyone else's opinion and play how you see fit. Everyone krabs at some point
---
This is so wormholers also get draged into the age of chaos and insanity. It shouldnt only be nullseccers who suffer 😗
---
There actually are people out there with that attitude.  But what you imagine will will happen.  First of all, no one is getting 5000 dreads into a system that is already prepared with 500 titans (and various other stuffs).  No one with 500 titans doesn't have another 500-1000++ faxes, recons, hics, dics, dreads, supes, etc.
---
You could get people in 2016 to welp machariel fleets at 400 mil a pop (2 months playtime), and dreads are cheap, but no one is going to go out and trash titans and supes.  No one is going to dread bomb an overloaded node if it means the 1000 pilots they managed to get into the system won't be able to get back in once podded.
---
Also, these set-piece battles remove the skill component a lot of those (now lost) other players enjoyed.  There isn't a way for some group with 100 cap + subcap composition to outfly some other group with 500 caps + subcaps (or even NO subcaps).  Rock paper scissors is gone.  It becomes more about who can get in system before the inhibs or tidi, who might be able to crash the system when it is in their favor, who has their titans or supers in the right position.
---
My only big fight was in UALX.  I thought I remembered it as a lot of fun.  But it wasn't.  The battle itself was cool at the start (we were one of the first subcap fleets on grid).  Then the fighters were launched, tidi started and then everything went to shit and the lag was ridiculous.  
---
What was fun was the breakout of the trapped caps over the following week.  With "only" 1000-2000 people in system at any one time there was no lag, a lot less ti-di, and what you did as an individual pilot seemed to matter.  Not as much as when flying with 5 or 10 or 20 other guys, but at lest your mods responded, and individual pilots (looking at you, brave sabre pilots who died trying to bubble the fleeing caps) could actually take initiative.
---
I have 5 that have many different uses. They're all high sp chars, they can all fly caps, have a couple titans and supers. It's fun when you can drop more dreads than some small corps can. There are alliances out there than can punch well above their weight because they require members to have a main, have a dread alt, have a fax alt, and some, like mine require to have or be working towards getting a super or titan while be able to simultaneously field fax.
---
There is a point where you have so much it's more fun to hell dunk on people on your own, than fly in subcap fleets.  
---
The last few days has been most interesting, with people thinking cynos are now extinct, it's opened a whole new realm of content and given gankers the feeling of safety they needed to get brave. Now cloaking a cyno falcon or widow on grid of a friendly mining op is a very realistic option. You need alts, with high skillpoints to do this on your own.
---
Anyway, In no time you have a gang to dunk on or scare off, and save your friends from annihilation in their defenceless ships.
---
I’ll up vote that
---
Actually I killed the Nestor with the astra before any dps even showed up lol
---
Krab sneakily
---
If asset safety wasn't a thing, people would have a reason to structure grind. Right now, "ohhh yay you get a kill mail" but no "1000 ships dropped". What's the point...
---
Average. Not above or below the base line.
---
So you're saying the company that depends of EVE to succeed to survive doesn't give a shit about it... seems legit.
---
If they didn't bother they would let the game stay like it was... slowly dying, while squeezing every bit of money they could... But, hey look, by the looks they prefer to lose income on the short term and are looking at the long term. 
---
Yeah, seems CCP are actually giving a crap about the game afterall. 
---
I've been playing this game since 2005, and I have to give credit to CCP: they manage to create and get this game going on for years already while others have been gone for years already... So maybe just MAYBE CCP actually knows what they are doing.
---
Afterall the consequence to CCP to an EVE premature death it's bankrupcy. I find that, the best incentive a corporation can have to "give a shit"...
---
I'm surprise you weren't aware of this. There were several high profile and international cases about literally this exact thing.
---
Weirdly, even though I'm running Android Pi, I can't download the app because it's not supported for my device. I can't even see the app within the Play Store.
---
He stated in his post that he doesnt have one of those, can you read?
---
I can't fly caps so...
---
But I doubt it will go on for much longer
---
Nullsec is vast and if you know where to look there are plenty of targets. If you couldn’t/can’t find any that says more about you then CCP. 
---
I’m glad you get some fun out of your posts in this subreddit.

There are many imaginable ways to take subcap farming behind acceleration gates.

Loot drops.
---
This is a question best suited to our [No question is too stupid thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d37m1w/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread/)
---
I am beginning to think the devs are not so smart.  ;)
---
I do believe it is their game to ruin, but I would have killed bridges and nerfed anoms before I messed with the cyno changes.  And that may be coming.
---
And for those who say it isn't worth it to krab in null, my guess is that it will be again when (after probably too long) the once valuable resources of null become expensive again.
---
ahahahhahahahhahaha you used to have to actually field a mining fleet with ships that are reasonable killable by drunk dudes. now you can enjoy your uncontested 24/7 mining in a fortress.
---
i hope this game finally dies so it can make room for some true cut throat pvp gameplay like we used to have.
---
NO! It has nothing to do with anything serious. Have you seen how many bot accounts have shut down?
---
Unexpectedly* as intended. FTFY
---
Ill be honest Mango, I hate Dorkness of the Galaxy as much as the next guy, but your posting is getting pretty cringeworthy
---
We favour subcaps for engagements and occasionally carriers. We don’t hunt supers/titans as we prefer small gang stuff. Not sure where your comment comes from, we don’t expect impunity - we relish a challenge. If goons could tackle better they’d have killed me a lot more with their super fleet !
---
I don’t see how the Frarie deployment is relevant in this thread? If you want to use it to beat your own ego knock yourself out. But to the point, most imperium members have adapted by not subbing as many accounts. Which less accounts mean less people which mean less targets and less fun for us all. But you do you man. Also lol at a lowsec guy commenting about null
---
I totally agree. The sooner the game dies off, the sooner I can stop paying subscription fees on 5 accounts. Because I sure as hell ain't gonna stop voluntarily, trust me.
---
&gt; A month from now every single target in delve will be logged off as they are helpless carebears not being able to handle changes ~~on comms (wasn't like that before), will have proper fits (wasn't like that before), will have jabber for pings about fleets (wasn't like that before), will have a microphone (wasn't like that before), will be on intel channels (wasn't like that before), will be on a coalition-wide in-game chat (wasn't like that before), will have his/her own cyno alt that scouts the next site (wasn't like that before).
---
&gt; You haven't seen oppressive nullsec umbrellas yet compared to what you'll see by Christmas.~~
---
Baseliner is in-universe capsuleer slang for "normal humans"
---
I went from 4 years of nullsec to wh some month ago, I realize eve community is fucking dumb, WH is the best place to have small gang warfare, roll your static BOOM free shiny nestor on dscan or undock to do some PVE BOOM 10 + guy just uncloack next to you.. Meanwhile eve community want to make Nullsec the place where Supers/titan and mega coalition live and clash for decades a place like wh.. Why don't you just move to WH ??
---
yeah but anecdotally before blackout I found lots, post blackout I found considerably less so it's pretty easy for me to say this is a negative, but yes it is good that I can find solace in shit posting here :)
---
"The hostile staging area" in Providence is about 15 different systems spanning from lowsec to Catch. We watch the big two but you can't realistically watch everything. My point is more that neither hunter nor hunted should expect risk-free play; giving some kind of counter-play against cloaky campers adds more risk to what is an entirely risk-averse playstyle, which is exactly what we called for and got with the cyno changes.
---
&gt; One caveat being make passive mining an option if you'd rather not mine it.
---
I'd be fine with this. I'd even be fine if the yield was a little bit lower that way. But it will not happen.
---
at baad expense to others. No valid counterplay. also nullblobs can still rekt you with subcaps.
---
Never forget. I came back and started playing again.
---
They are in fact to blame in some part.  Anyone who has been in this game long enough has seen some part of their game nerfed.  
---
I used to kid that I would charge good isk to train into something someone else wanted nerfed because I have several times had the ships I was training into nerfed within a month or two of achieving the goal. 
---
If you don't realize that the people who like blackout are not just people who want to fly 100 bomber fleets all day then you have been in EvE too short a time and been exposed to spodbrains for too long.  Possibly that is what was meant about your mentors?
---
Proof that Bob is in fact one of the old gods.
---
Yes but at least subcaps it will be fight. Thats all we want.
---
I made the change just after blackout, primarily because of lack of content in Malpais and burning out on having to burn down to Fraternity space to get blueballed by TAPI 9/10 times.
---
Provi is a lot of fun but has its own set of challenges, namely a far lower latent wealth in the coalition especially when it comes to capital/supercapital ships. I speak to leadership of holder alliances on a regular basis, they're good people, we don't agree on everything but on the broad strokes there's a lot of common ground.
---
That great Provi-bloc super umbrella, right. I must have forgotten.
---
I didn't know you needed to explain why you left PL.
---
Back in 2014 there was a ton of drama in the Russian groups when Russian Nationalists would get in fights with Ukranians. However most of that drama didn't make it here due to the language barrier.

surprisingly i am enjoy wow classic atm. who would have thought..
---
will come back after it lost my interest. really enjoying the organic world pvp and the feeling of a fresh start in a mmo
---
But, but the blackout ? Null sec is empty isn't it? You mean there is actually content in null sec ?
---
WTF the cpu...

this is some mean girls level of passive agrrssiveness, amazing

&gt; “ play the game a different way” ... it’s easier to play a different game.

&gt;Now half those noobs have to move into a garbage unfun nullbloc

Because lowsec and wormholes don't exist anyway.

ROFL  ... OMG and at 11:01 also!  Eve has died!

Maybe being on the other side of a fence is terrible to you, but this is about learning a wider perspective.  This is a sandbox community with a wide variety of play styles and there is an overwhelming attitude of grrrr\[not me\] in our community that really isn't helpful to anyone, even the aggressor, at the macro level.
---
You go into a wormhole and roll all of your statics and keep eyes for any new sigs, while you bear in perfect safety,  then you go on r/eve and bitch and moan about how super safe the nullsec guys have it and dont realize you are a massive hypocrite because your middle name is dunning-kruger.
---
Eve too hard, can't find difficulty options in menu === reee
---
The only question that matters is one that wasn't addressed in your report.
---
Are you confident in the health/state/future of the game? 
---
In the same vein as the Innominate question from the Meta show.
---
So 1 third of all logged in accounts per day were bots. 
---
*wonders how people can breath with their heads buried in the sand
---
If you dont have a bunch of people to vote you in just because you're their tribes' favored candidate, the best way to campaign is still showcasing proposals. It is mainly for voters to understand candidates' command over Eve issues and how they would navigate them. Yes, it doesn't mean the candidate's sole job is now pitching those ideas to CCP.
---
But the whole thing is much more nuanced than the two extremes of "CSM is there to campaign for specific changes" vs "CSM doesn't pitch ideas at all":
---
- If CCP is convinced that something is a problem and they want to allocate bandwidth to solve it, they do ask CSM opinion on what do to about it. 
---
- But they go to CSM less if the change is controversial, and if there is playstyle conflicts of interest at play. 
---
- Also, an idea pitched today can go into the game 2 years later. 
---
- And lastly, CCP does directly follow player feedback as a constant source of ideas; so if an idea is already public, it doesn't require a CSM to specifically pitch it in a meeting, but it doesn't mean CCP themselves come up with all the implemented ideas. This is why CSM campaigns are also important to foster a marketplace of original ideas.
---
- Overall, CCP does use player and CSM ideas but just in a way more indirect sense than what some in the community think they do.
---
A lot of people like seeing the big numbers roll up.  It makes them think they are accomplishing something.  It isn't an accident that over the years pinball machines went from 5 to 6 to 7 digit scoring and kept the high scores displayed.  
---
But pinball is a PvE game, and Eve if Eve was about the PvE maybe it would be designed better.  It was supposed to be about PvP so much that scams and markets and ganking existed.
---
Ah, thought it was Darius talking earlier about killing it. Either way, shit died before it was useful
---
The proteus is my favourite ship in eve :(
---
Can't have that on the kb ehh?
---
Your intro was great, but then your interpretation is lacking a bit.
---
Of course the drop of 5k concurrent drop is less than actual players logging in. But the % number is most likely the other way around. People log in shorter, as afk ratting is done, multiboxing nerfed, botting got a big hit. All of these three groups were overrepresented in the "old" Concurrent User count by a lot.
---
It's simply impossible to see how the monthly active user count is. Or how many individual players there are logging in monthly etc. However, CCP has got the number, and they will do their interpretation on these numbers
---
Nothing changed about that, my Super pilot is currently in a FAX in 1DQ, and my dread pilot is training recons. This difference is that my subcap alt went to highsec to run abyssals.
---
We could really do without your useless commentary all the time. As an /eve shitposter, ever feel a pang of embarrassment?
---
Just don’t tell people when you krab lmao
---
If you add that multiboxing got a huge effective hit, then it might be.
---
Running 10 VNIs (or myrms) or Rorqs is hardly feasible now.
---
Who would have thought eve offline wasn’t the data ccp were using !?! 🤔🤪
---
Looks like a vanilla minmatar ship to me
---
First of all - why do you care if someone calls you ... anything?
---
This is a sandbox, you go and do whatever you want. Then you face the consequences.
---
Go find your own Valhalla!
---
&gt;!Just don't mine for Bob's sake! ;)!&lt;
---
Is that John FCing? Nice job!
---
yeh, your 30 ppl gang against lets say 200 ppl fleet. you get stomped, thats not fun.
---
There needs to be valid endgame and usefulness for all ship classes and players. Valid null for farmers, hunters, supers...
---
What this guy is saying is huge.  
---
During my 9 years of Eve I've tried a huge variety of activities - even if they weren't outright appealing to me. Even though I don't need the isk any more I've still tried highsec and nullsec missions, incursions, ratting, explo, abyssal space, market seeding, manipulating, daytrading, hunting (predditor btw), roaming, camping, solo, small gang, block blobs, and then some.  Basically, the only things I haven't done are actively live in a wormhole, scam, haul, or mine.  Okay, I tried Ibis mining for about 90 seconds once.  It really wasn't for me.  
---
This has been a massively positive experience for me.  When I talk about what I like and why I can support it.  When I call out a problem I can see who it affects and how.  We need more of this in the community.
---
Heads up, all:
---
We had a conflict with a bit of deprecated code that affected some (but not all) Mac users with the switch to default 64-bit. Part of the problem stems from us getting the client functioning correctly on the beta version of Catalina. 
---
That said, we're pretty sure about the fix and will be testing it out today and tomorrow to resolve some additional potential conflicts. Provided nothing explodes, you should expect to see it hit Tranquility early next week.
---
Apologies for the inconvenience.
---
The risk for the hunter is that the target is bait. If you don’t think it is worth the effort to bait out the drop, that’s not the hunters’ fault.
---
For what it’s worth, I fall into both categories. I’m usually baiting in my own space while hunting in other space.
---
If CCP truly cared they would have hired more more devs to clean up their technical debt way back instead of letting it fester for over a decade. They just didn't want to reinvest the money back into EVE.
---
im posting a lot of stupid shit, but that you picked this among all of it for such a comment says a lot about which direction you're coming from here lmao.
---
No that isn't the only question that matters that was a clearly set up question so Mittens can go "Yikes" in a handsomely understated way as part of his propaganda against the Chaos changes.
---
I tried to tell people that breaking caps would break the entire game but here we are.
---
I find a bunch of those too. I’m not sure what the normal distribution of safe vs unsafe sites are to be fair.
---
Start off you “Git Gud”
---
Then adapt of die, (throw on lots of hurf”
---
Scream, rant and rave like a lunatic
---
Go out and be such an elite pvper that you actually make isk by looting the wrecks of the lesser pvpers and bears you hunt in your leet pwner-mobile
---
(At least that’s what me, a filthy krab has been told)
---
Provi is shit space anyway so....
---
Yes but i am :     
---
* pointing the obvious way        
---
* that is already implemented         
---
* can me expanded by adding new missions    
---
* all improvements to this can be instantly transferred to higsec mission hubs, lowsec mission hubs and FW missions                    
---
Having one system is very good in terms of maintenance as you don't need to support multiple systems, just one.
---
Just like i suspected, you have no idea of what goes into a successful hunt with smaller ships in smaller groups that die instantly the moment your transversal drops below 200m/sec. That's ok, i don't drop capitals either (i just shoot them), people have different playstyles, etc. The problem with you is that you're unable to realize there needs to be a give and take involved and a balance. 
---
Yes, if you get repeatedly shot by 500 frigates, your super should die. That's how Goons became a thing, they had been doing that for years and nobody complained. But now that you can inject into the big stuff and bypass everything, suddenly people act like spoiled brats who think big ships should be immune to everything else, on top of their already ridiculous warp disruption and ECM resistance bonuses they get? Get real dude, at this point it's starting to get ridiculous trying to explain the obvious to you.
---
And since you can obviously operate a PC and play a relatively complex game (albeit without fully understanding or wanting to understand how games are supposed to work to remain interesting), i don't believe that you are stupid. So that leaves us with the other obvious choice: entitlement of playstyle.
---
You just want overpowered win buttons and the ability to stomp everything based on if it's smaller or not, plus you don't even realize or acknowledge that's not how game design and balance works, because you don't want to, because it doesn't suit you.
---
Go ahead, i don't mind, it's your own opinion. But propagating it is dangerous for you, not me. Because this mentality you exhibit is exactly the reason CCP is nerfing all your shiny toys to shit right now. So keep going like this and we will end up in exactly the place you don't want the game to be, lol.
---
I think it's safe to say we agree to disagree here, i'm heading out. Have fun in the game or don't, your choice.
---
But really they’re just swipin that card and not actually being engaged with the game...
---
I consider player that went to alpha while keeping playing a lost player.
---
So you mean they tried to diversify so they wouldn't give a shit about EVE, if they want to...
---
Each time I read reddit, I want to unsub.
---
Can you guys try to be optimistic?
---
I know, no, you cant.
---
Yesterday was slow AF
---
“Perfect safety”. Are you talking about high class ratting or low class? Static krabbing or bear hole krabbing? What’s the cost of your setup? All of these factors are improper at in the risk vs reward of everything.
---
We are all filthy krabs in our own way. The difference is between those who krab to krab more and those who krab to buy stuff to make explosions. The former has the majority of eve players in it - they expect content to be handed to them at a time that suits them.
---
How can they know their game is dying when they don't use the most important statistic in the game!!!! If they looked at PCU numbers they would stop this madness!!!!!
---
Ive never made use of a mentor or said i did.. Thats the funny part... Im on and off  around since '09.. And i dont even see a problem in no local.. Hell i wouldnt even mind if corvettes and super couldnt use it.. But the way ccp went is like.. Lets roll a dice and see what happens.. And for the end.. F'ing dont blame ppl who try to help newbris probably not everything is 100% accurate but at least they try to guide ppl who cant find their own way...
---
If you don't understand that was setup, and had already been discussed multiple times before going on ThE MetA ShOw, I don't know if there's much help for you.
---
What is a decent spacefaring online game that doesn't have the frustration, griefing and assholery of EVE's pvp system?
---
(I'd have been okay with EVE if it wasn't possible to get suicide-ganked / kamikaze'd in high-sec systems.)
---
I think this is one of the main differences between people who are trying to beat the game vs people using the game to generate stories.
---
If you're trying to beat the game, then you find a play style that maximizes your enjoyment while minimizing your perceived losses.  Whatever your personal sources of dopamine and serotonin are.
---
If you're generating stories, then you have to imagine yourself in the role of whatever you're doing - space pirate, space miner, dude just trying to chill and watch the pixels.  That role is not *you*, just a character in the story.
---
It's like every time I try to start a melee Fallout build, but invariably end up sneaking around with a sniper rifle.  I'm trying to beat the game, not imagine an invincible power-armored goon ripping the throat out of a deathclaw.
---
So because you don't do pve, the pve players should not be upset with these changes?
---
First, i'm not part of Tuskers.
---
Second, i read your post as "Tuskers are chickens for not sticking around to get slaughtered when the enemy brought almost 3 times their numbers".
---
I think we have a misunderstanding here, lol.
---
And judging by the downvotes you get, it seems other people misread the post as well.
---
Was it just a bit of sarcasm?
---
Thanks!
---
Tbh I think more people would be inclined to if there was an actual reason to fight, and structure grinding wasn't such shit. The ease of planting ten new structures to replace a single lost one is laughable
---
HEy….
---
A couple of nights ago on the eve of the cyno changes I decided at long last to head to Curse and retrieve a few long lost capital hulls , id put it off for ages due to the ball ache of having to move 11 Jumps to get to our home region .Though with the changes just around the corner it was now or never.
---
My 4 characters took 2 different routes to destination , having lived in Curse previously I new chances are several camps on the way and probable death of at least 1 character was highly likely . I mean 8pm primetime for many what could go wrong ...right lol ??? Well to my amazement all 4 character made it without the slightest problem I breezed the entire route seeing not 1 not 2 but ZERO camps or hostiles trying to snare me.
---
Next came the capital move 11 jumps of proper pain in the ass at the best of time. Of  I set , 3 chars to fly capitals and 1 to light the path with the cynos . I packed several spare mods and fuel as having done this in the past I was bound to die to some smart bomber in a pipe or one of eves many haters of cynos somewhere along the way. I undocked and the journey was on and I jumped to Great  Wildlands docked up and went to make a brew . On my return to my surprise I was alive and well and happily drinking a coffee in the Station ...HappyDayz. 
---
On I pushed along my path home , another quick burn to the next location and a second cyno surely this time I would meet my maker but nope it appeared I was having a streak of luck . This went on for the remaining 9 systems I had to jump to to reach B-D . Along the path systems remained more or less empty , even the odd NC/PL char that I passed didn't come to shoot me , not even them pesky neut alts came to say hi guns blazing. 
---
In short I moved a total of 154 systems via sub caps to reach destination followed by another 40 or so lighting cynos in 11 different systems. Not once did I get locked , popped and sent to that great clone vat in the sky. I have played this game since 2003 and since that period in general the numbers have increased ive seen them as low as 2k online peak back then . CCP has taken there usual approach to anything they deem unhealthy for the game by using a chainsaw to perform heart surgery and now we all have to pay the price. Some old players may well return but not nearly enough to stem the bleed out that's occurring atm , once confidence has left the building as far as player feeling towards Comedy Central Presents it will take a damn sight more than free skill points and trinkets to bring them back to the flock . CCP said we had a sandbox but they slowly replaced it with cement . Sad times 07
---
Yeah well if the summit taught me anything it's that it's very hard to guage how much devtime a specific change can take.
---
There are other ways, like drastically increasing combat signature spawns and changing their loot tables a bit to drop more overseer stuff and less DED stuff (so they drop more ISK and a similar amount of faction modules).
---
Imagine playing a sandbox, then imagine how to make isk, then do it.
---
Is there a link to those proposals or the presentation?!
---
i know you're not asking me, but my answer is no
---
This is one of Dunk's best articles. I hope everybody here who isn't functionally illiterate (you know who you are) reads it.

---
Hunters do you want guarantee loot drops?
---
Do you want no response fleets?
---
Do you want no counter play?
---
Post the questions as value neutral and actually respond to people who give answers even if they don't follow your narrative.
---
Its not even about what I want its that these changes are actively discouraging more and more people to play, the bare minimum should be reverting them to stop the bleed out of the player base. These changes could all have been done better but given ccps inability to iterate we are literally stuck with these.
---
The loki that lived
---
I don't have one. Exo was going to show it to the WH community after the Summit was over.  
---
I'm not part of the WH community because I'm not into secret sex parties.
---
Right, I'm not saying there's no risk for hunters, my dude; I'm saying that the effort required for the krab to pose a risk to specifically cloaky campers is far more intensive than the effort for a cloaky camper to pose a risk to a krab. This is really the opposite of any other hunting activity, and contributes to a very un-interactive hunting metagame which doesn't see enough fights happen.
---
The game requires krabbing unless you wallet tank it.
---
I mean yes, but it's our shit space. :)
---
spai
---
Do you feel that blackout helped or hindered you in these kills?
---
Because they talked about it on TiS podcast.
---
You can't make t2 locally, the moon minerals are regionalized. So ccp can scream about it all they want but they are actively discouraging it. Actions speak louder than words.
---
You make sure your company is capable of diversifying before spending the money to diversify. It's clear from how poorly WOD/Dust and how legion looks to be turning out is that their company has problems that prevent them from being able to produce good games.
---
Judging by the HTP ticker, I think he's saying that moving to Provi-bloc sounds terrible. :P
---
Fellow nullsec capsuleers, what is it that you want? - An end to post-scarcity, better balance of ship class, reasons for conflict other than dick waving.
---
Do you want the game the way it was in May? - No. 
---
Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely? - I want supercapitals to be a valuable part of the ecosystem that isn't the be-all-end-all hellicopter dick that ends all content. That being said, I'm not a PVE player so the umbrella protection isn't directly a benefit to me. 
---
Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel? - No, I like the blackout, but covert ops ships are wildly out of balance now and further iteration is needed.
---
What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities. - I've only lost \~3 bil through PVE. No Idea how much I made. I'm a market guy and a PVPer.
---
When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system. -  At first I had a blast working with gatecamps. I've gone on a few solo roams in cruisers and battleships. If I saw a Cynabal I would probably chase it down. 
---
How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.  - Most of the time
---
And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era. 
---
\- About the same either way
---
That the game is having a bunch of manbabies throwing a tantrum?
---
Level 5s
---
But gigx created more content as alliance lead than he did as FC...
---
&gt;And lastly, CCP does directly follow player feedback as a constant source of ideas; 
---
And also give no fucks. So effectively not really.
---
This. I mock krabs, but only when they don’t drop the pve for pvp when it comes up. As long as you don’t just grind and never pew krabbing is nbd
---
I had lv5 before i left null for wormhole space. I'm weird i like scanning.
---
Aww, found the salty nullbear.
---
Goons have than just 100 titans. Lol.
---
So, bury the other kids in sand and demand their lunch money?
---
lol Classic example of a guy who had his pants talked off
---
No it isn't. Your player skill means fuck all when the enemy has enough ships to alpha you straight off the grid.
---
Hate to break this to you. Eve is a sandbox game. If people want to be pure PvE pilots they are well within their rights to do so.
---
The only problem Eve has right now is CCP listening to people like you who want to stop people from playing the way they want to.
---
Believe it or not, i dont think this was an actual change. There may be more people scanning, and thus spawning connections, but I am unaware of any changes to WH space besides the drifter hives.
---
Ccp are welcome to give us things to be positive about.
---
Hmm. Fear inoculum sounds like.
---
Who did?
---
You haven't seen me write "all that". If you did, you'd have to scroll. Twice. And i can't do that by rolling my head on the keys, that's quite inefficient.
---
Still, the rest of the points after the "no sarcasm" point stand. You're part of the player demographic that likes to roleplay the "big baddie" in the game. Nothing wrong with that, countless others have done it before you (and also done it better), it spices up the game to have bad guys.
---
But if that's your chosen role play it. Act like bad guys and keep it consistent,because "help, the game will die because my favorite toys are getting nerfed" and "i'm a bad guy" don't mix. That's all i'm saying.
---
Cost is not a balancing factor.
---
&gt;Perfect safety

"Filthy Krab" ways of earning ISK:
---
* Mining (especially in Hi-Sec or under a super umbrella)
---
* Ratting (especially with a Super)
---
* Incursions (especially with a public group)
---
* Mission Running
---
Not as filthy ways (probably won't be called a filthy krab):
---
* Planetary Interaction
---
* Industry
---
* Hauling
---
* Abyssal
---
Big brain ways (you won't be called a filthy krab but you will be called other things):
---
* Market PVP
---
* Suicide Ganking
---
* Gate/Pipe camping
---
* Looting/salvaging during fleet (especially if in a doctrine ship)
---
*proteus wants to know your location*
---
We undock between 20-30 fleets a day and I havent whiffed on a fleet I led getting kills since back when we were deployed up North. There are a ton of great groups that arent in the big blocs but just like there are benefits to those groups there are benefits to the blocs as well and the new Eve player can decide which side is more to their liking.
---
Yeah, one of main changes would be removing a bunch of the ships.
---
You do know how large ships in Eve are, right?
---
Look it up, most are hundreds of meters long.
---
Place your keys in the bowl and take a seat.
---
Blackout chaos era crap is nothing like SOEs screw up with the nge. I get people are upset over their playstyle being nerfed but this is nothing like removing the freedom players had in making their character and dumbing the game into a linear theme park.
---
&gt;Consider your current playstyle    
---
(not logging in)

&gt;and do the opposite for 30 days.

---
Goons continue to cry about changes because they don't benefit their playstyle
---
Feeding, maybe? I just think too many people are stuck in meta level fleeting. "Aw shit they got one more logi than us... Guess we better stand down" heaven forbid you lose some ships. Who cares honestly. I've been in plenty of fights where being outnumbered didn't matter. Just brawl it out and have fun. Literally just space pixels that can be replaced.
---
Oh so you want free intel but the defenders can't have free Intel?
---
I did my time in Provi/VOLT and while I had fun at times I do not miss the mindset and attitudes. I spent my time being the bear and then eventually trying to coerce the bears to engage in PVP and better the alliance. The effort became more than the reward so I joined a group of like minded persons.
---
I do and its fucking hilarious thank you /u/KillahPee
---
I'm not really aware of the game at all but what about black desert online? Seems kind of appropriate to look at their state, what with the owning company having purchased CCP. :P
---
Lived there already and I outgrew what it offered.
---
Reeeeeeeee Where are my T2 Salvaging Drones Dunk.
---
You have 1 job.
---
Ikr lol glad he didn’t get a haw refit on
---
Some of what you say i can agree with. But as for the rest, that's exactly how the game is meant to work.
---
The whole game is build on diminishing returns to allow newer players to be useful and facilitate rock-paper-scissors play and decision making. The simplest example of diminishing returns is gunnery skills. You get 5% bonus damage per level for training the tech1 racial turrets, but you only get 2% per level for training the tech2 specialization skill, even if it takes longer to get there.
---
This is what people fail to grasp lately. They often expect that since they have more isk and sp on the field, they should be untouchable by cheaper or smaller stuff. But that's exactly what makes the game boring and not worthwhile to fight, because it kills asymmetric counters and the only viable tactic after that is either to n+1 the opposition, or bring hard counters (bombers and booshers).
---
I'm not sure what will happen with the current changes (they are good for the short-term but i'm not 100% on board with them for the long-term), but even if they didn't change anything you probably wouldn't see another battle of B-R5RB anyway. It's because of the combination of game mechanics and player culture that i described in the original post.
---

1) not to need to press "v" constantly in a already busy system to receive results that don't tell me much of use.
---
2) I honestly don't care either way. I have a saying, " It is what it is"
---
3) If I'm going to use a capital to do boring shit I'd rather not have to do. Sure. This goes back to the type of person I am. If I'm in home Depot and I want a specific screw, I do not look for the busiest person to get off a ladder or stop mopping to do a minor task I can do myself. I do not get a police officer directing traffic to take a report on my missing gravy spoon. If I'm out pvping I generally leave ratters and miners alone. Why? Because they might be like me and ratting/mining is like cleaning excrement from a bathroom wall. Let them get it done so they can come at me with a PVP ship.
---
4) blackout just means I don't have to read Olmeca complain about goons.
---
5 data section) Having to do it all is a loss of sanity.

6) The Cynabal...Pouge Was. Used the dead space pocket caused by the tutorial to drop that money sharing thing off dscan. Used same to hide. Usually reshipped and tried to run him off if we couldn't catch him. The exploits killed the fun of it. It became more annoying than anything.
---
7) Maybe they did maybe not, no idea. I want a fight, not to harass people doing drudge-work.
---
8) It lasts as long as it does. I no control over the universe.

&gt;In a sandbox game that offers PVE players as content for PVP players I find it funny that someone says "hey come on, feel bad for not letting me do what I want to do all the time without risk or consequence."
---
Very telling that you don't consider PVP players to be content. No one is asking to be able to PVE without risk, but give us a sporting chance. Right now, the hunters have EVERY advantage. They can enter a system undetected by all but the luckiest of D-scanners. They can fly around all day cloaked. They can sit on targets, organizing their fleet, planning the attack...and even go AFK for a drink before opening fire. Ratters have at least some defense, miners just have to accept their ships as a potential loss at every undock.
---
I know the current mantra is "get friends" but seriously, the price of ore these days barely justifies a single person spending the time to fill an Orca. There is no way it can pay out enough to justify 10-20 people sitting around for hours waiting to risk their ships and ISK for no reward....or at best the reward of possible content. Basically, if you don't have the 20 Rorquals, it's just no longer worth the effort....unless you are bait.

Is that the Eve you want? No room for beginning or independent industry any more? All meaningful means of production controlled by the big blue blobs? How long before we no longer buy Gallente or Caldari ships, and instead buy Goon or Test or PL ships? That just seems to be where we are headed.
---
*Do you want the game the way it was in May?* - Yes
---
*Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely?* - As part of Theta squad; I've NEVER needed to call them for assistance. So... No, but I do enjoy dropping on aggressors.
---
*Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel?* Yes; Knowing who is present in system is good. It allows you to switch from PVE to PVP. And not just surprise your dead.
---
What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities? - In the last 6 Months I've lost about 10 bil worth of stuff; I make about 8 bil surplus a month. (Most losses were PVE related)
---
When was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system. - Kill him with a carrier if possible; if not... get a PVP ship (anything between Caracal/Brutix/Confessors/Hecate or whatever) if he needs to be chased down and if hes not going to call 10 buddies or be uncatchable... I'm more than happy to play... but playing to win... and last time... I dunno; it happens all the time; killed some guy on a gate the other day with 2 corp mates. (baited him as a solo)
---
*How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels* - almost never... I don't solo roam- cause its just not my thing; small gang/corpie stuff: we don't really chase bots; mostly get people gating around by suprize...
---
*And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.* I think the game will be fine; it NEEDS changes and engaging content (PVE &amp; PVP) but I think blackout suffocates the majority of players gameplay.
---
Same for me, just thaz i couldn't find a single wormhole. 30 systems later still nothing and I had to turn back
---
give me your  k162 entrance,i will double it.
---
Both my farmholes have had one or two wormhole connections at most the past few days. I do somewhat believe high class -&gt; nullsec connections have increased since I have them daily, but could just be rng.
---
Near perfect safety, since my napkin math says wormholes have about 1/3rd the ratio of isk printed:ships destroyed as null. Yes that includes umbrella regions.
---
Nah, it was just one dude multi-boxing.
---
keep scan alt in wh ,you will be shocked...  i did leave alt in one planet c2 hole that nobody would want it...and there are evryday  4-7 k162 extra holes
---
I don't bitch bro, I provide meaningful feedback based on extensive analysis and real world results from an in depth experience of over a decade.
---
Hi. So if my current gameplay is being docked, should I undock?
---
You have to crab more to meet isk demands if your isk/hour is 60 and not 600.
---
I was there. SWG was my first MMO experience.
---
What Sony did to SWG was game breaking. They radically changed how basic combat mechanics worked AND ruined the economy in one fell swoop. CCP has not changed core combat and are correcting the economy back to healthy, not ruining it. 
---
Granted, they did implement the past changes that did the economic damage they are now trying to correct.
---
You know I never really got the keys in the bowl thing, Like I'm at the sex party, I pick out a set of keys, and now what?  I go outside and try car doors until one opens?  I walk back inside like "Hey guys, I'm here to fuck whoever has the green toyota"?
---
I can understand what you're saying . But your statement only shows that CCP due to, or not to, their incompetence, is pretty much stuck with EVE Online. So your "CCP doesn't give a shit about EVE" argument is, at best, a hard sell.
---
What we want is conflict driven by scarcity. 
---
Most people in nul blocks dont care much for small group PVP. The big, long wars are our kind of PVP.
---
imagine if CCP made resources scarce, so we where forced actually "fight for resources and power"
---
Right now the only conflict driver is "I want to PVP" what we need is conflict driven by a bever ending need for more resources
---
Lowsec has more to offer than small scale pirate stuff.
---
There are huge minings op. High isk/hr in missions. Some Nice DEDs. Etc.
---
****
---
Great post btw.
---
So you too accuse Hilmar of being a lunatic drug addict? Are you the main account of the OP or what else has shit in your brain, seriously?
---
Its like people would speak of your alliance CEO as TheMittaniPedo ... implying he abuses kids
---
This post makes me so happy. Best of luck! It will be difficult, so as others have said, get into your prospectful neighbours diplo/discord channels and coordinate with them.
---
Abyssals are hard to bot and require expensive fits for the higher tiers, which you can easily lose to a simple "socket closed" error.
---
Incursions are not abundant and you have to interact with others to get a place in the queue.
---
Burner missions require specific, expensive fits as well.
---
Wormhole stuff is risky by default, even if you close your statics someone can roll into you at any time.
---
All of the above pays a lot of money (and may also need adjusting, i'm not against that by the way). But the problem was not only the payouts, but the scalability. And relatively hands-off activities (the least effort, like you said) like anomaly ratting and mining, scale much better than hands-on activities.
---
You could easily multibox 5 rorqs, but you can't multibox 5 gilas in Tier5s with the same amount of safety and success, simply because it requires more player input.
---
How dare they.
---
I remember when i signed up for eve and the eula specifically said i wasn’t allowed or supposed to “pve” for more than 27.3% of my ingame time or else i was bad
---
&gt;  ive quit as i saw these bad changes coming about 4 months ago
---
I mean, it sounds like you were looking for an excuse to quit and any change would have done it unless it was purely positive for you (and probably negative for the game's health as a result). You even state literally that you'll never be coming back, so the game trying to cater to you would be pointless.
---
There is no reason to be upset.
---
I really hope that CCP has some sort of master plan for all this. Because they applied shock therapy to very weakened patient. There will be no long term gains if game dies before they could be seen, or if game falls so hard in numbers, that it never recovers. 
---
They took very risky approach, when game wasn't in it's best state, they started it by making people irritated in first weeks (drifters and lack of communication), and they are doing it when the MMO game market isn't in it's best health either, with WOW Classic cannibalising most of it.
---
People didn't had much faith in CCP before, and now, they have even less. Even if people agree that game needed a shakeout, there's a lot to say about it's execution and form.
---
Exookiz and Vily were both just on the most recent episode. Feel free to go listen.
---
Like I said, significant divide in wealth. 45% below the poverty line still leaves 55% above it. 
---
Disposable income/ generational wealth/resources don't stop existing. It's just a lower proportion of the population have access to them. Same with infrastructure, there are still parts of the Us, UK with no stable internet, as developed as we are.
---
You don't seem to understand anything apart from your low IQ grouping if countries into "first" "second" or "third" world (terms that are falling out of use in official contexts) in favour of less developed, developing and developed, as they paint a better picture and aren't recycled cold war terminology.
---
Amen
---
Guess I’m a scrub, I went from playing 2-3 hrs a day doing pve to fund my ships for fleets to almost not logging in at all unless a ping gos our while I play another game. Sure I had losses to hunters all the time but I made isk to fund the stuff I wanted to do. 
---
- insta death drifters made me give up subcap for pve and switch to mining in a heavy tanked procurer
---
- mining was ok until blackout, now if your in a barge you get hazed by cloaked shit unless your in a pack but it’s getting harder and harder to find the numbers to get relatively safe. Going solo is a death wish. 
---
- tried to go back to subcap pve which was a mistake.  unless you have backup waiting to save you your not going to get away from the hunters and it quickly went to isk negative activity as no one wants to hang out to try to save your Ishtar and I tried getting people to group up for sites but no one wants to feed or share bounties.
---
So now my income is PI and level 4 missions in hs but triglavians are a joy as when they catch you the time it takes you to recover the loss is harder to recoup. I am paid up until feb as I had an annual subscription but unless the game actually becomes less of a chore to do the fun stuff why should I play? I don’t particularly care if you call me a care-bear or whatever just how the recent changes have influenced me.  I still do fleets now and then but when my small pile of isk runs out I think I am done.
---
Just an eve player
---
Oh noes, random person I don't know called me a krab. Make it stop! Seriously?
---
&gt; propaganda tool transformed into racialism and nationalism 
---
WTF. Get that shit out of the game.
---
This is why I said that, my super pilot wait some dread KM instead of shooting npc. So yes, nothing changed.
---
*stares in MJD rattlesnake in my sealed up c5*
---
looks normal, its minmataar
---
...several people are typing.....
---
Does living in wormholes come with a tinfoil-kit?
---
No need to be paranoid about a post on r/eve
---
That only works if you have 5 dudes backing you up. You can't solo roam with 300dps. Even if you have 200k ehp. I feel like the Loki and Tengu are still the Kings of solo hunting.
---
You really just don't get the point of the post and are stuck on what I suggested. Let me make this clear, I don't care if what I suggested happens or not. It would simply be a means to an end of showing more than just different colored boxes on a space backdrop. 
---
Like I said in the post, eve is a great looking game and I am trying to brainstorm ideas that would help bring out that beauty. That is all.
---
Lol thinking gankers will drop dreads after the recon change instead of sticking to stealth bombers.
---
&gt;Dies after not noticing a new sig for 30 seconds
---
October 12 when PA boots Hilmar for causing 1/3 of the players to unsub/quit.
---
Wormholers seem to be despised by most of the people in this sub. It’s not paranoia, it’s just the sad state of this sub
---
I can relate to the wormhole things. Unless you are turbo krabbing in the safety of your wormhole, the fun level is entirely dependant on your friends being logged in. When you find you are the only one online, good luck...
---
Pretty much this. I hotdrop and hunt on some toons but I also have an anom runner and an Ishtar. Most ppl don’t actually care that u make isk and I’m sure 90% of the other crazy pvpers talking mad shit on reddit also make isk ratting or mining. Sometimes they even 1 up the turbocrabz. I remember the first time the new moons were released we went ham on those things. All of our tackle rorquals got a slight refit. I think we had 12 of them out (different ppl). We also had a pretty spooky dread bomb ready because we convinced ourselves that we weren’t mining. We were “baiting”.
---
I like to think that we did the rorqual mining correctly because we were hoping that it led to pvp and thus were prepared at least a lil bit for it.
---
Bathe regularly
---
Never considered more people spawning exits but it's clear that drifter wormholes are definitely more populated with sigs.
---
If only ccp would take note and try eve from the perspective of someone who actually plays the game.
---
I thought alphas were supposed to make number go up.
---
Exploration. 
---
Myrmidons to get escalations, but fit for PVP.
---
No Man's Sky, if the problems from the latest huge update were ironed out. The game has come a long way since it's rocky (more like avalanche-y) start.
---
You can actually call it a multiplayer game now :)
---
Well i play since 2007, I was in SovNull for 4 years overall, in NPC-Null for over 3 years, and Lowsec for 4 years, shifting inbetween. I guess I have seen the issue from more different sides than you think.
---
&gt; Which less accounts mean less people which mean less targets
---
Wrong statement, think about it ... more Multiboxes mean less players per account in space.
---
Just an example: Citadel patch and Lifeblood monnmining patch killed about 30k (50%) of the login numbers between 2016 and 2018 (long before blackout). In the same time the PvE-Meta in Nullsec became either Super-Ratting or, and this dramatically elevated the accounts per player stat, VNI or Mining-Multiboxes. due to heavy exploiting of the logfile leaks secured with botted Intel. So the result was less real people in space and less targets to shoot as the bot warned them 5-10 jumps out.
---
CCP Haimeh...  cant wait when we will see CCP Jita and CCP Amarr
---
lal we both know that 99% of the time that new sig isnt even dangerous and you couldn't notice it for hours and be fine.
---
You pretty much figured it out.
---
Give snuffed out a try. You may find it pretty fun, or maybe not. Either way you will have some pretty awesome cap fights. I sort of miss the brown london boy's voice tbh... oh tau....
---
RIP in piece Soundwave, 
---
I miss you on the alliance tournament footage, but I did see some porn a while back that had a dude that looked creepily like you.
---
I miss my old proteus. Decloak with 1k DPS and just facemelt.
---
Yeah I died if they got more than twenty feet from me.
---
Was still fun.
---
a lack of oxygen is killing ur brain
---
That's weird, as a former wormholer, I don't see that at all.
---
Also, are you the CraftyCroc that lived in Tama with Pyrasanth?
---
Repeat after me: "Players are not responsible for the health of this or any video game." We pay people to do that for us. These people are called "CCP."
---
If players are killing eve they should all leave the game.
---
Some alliances even have alts in other alliances specifically for crabbing so they don't taint their own killboard with PVE losses.
---
Why are players playing as they are?
---
Oh right, ccp's design choices.
---
&gt;What is NOT at the CSM Summit?  – the CSM presenting game designs, fists pounding on the table, detailed discussions of that special one thing you care about and posted about on /r/eve.  
---
&gt;Many players think that the CSM shows up in Reykjavik with a printout of a big proposal that was posted to the forums or Reddit and makes CCP read it.  That simply doesn’t happen.  There are no manifestos pinned to the front door of CCP. 
---
and this
---
&gt; **No, the CSM can’t make the CCP do anything.** CCP runs the game as they see fit and uses the CSM to bounce ideas off of and better understand exactly what the players are doing in the game. The CSM doesn’t make them fix faction warfare or remove warp core stabilizers or nerf \[insert your choice here\].  
---
are part of the problem and why the CSM is considered to be so ineffective.  That should change.
---
May I ask why?
---
WTB 1000 Exotic Dancers (Male)
---
With any luck the subreddit will act the same.
---
Could do the same with a legion. Can get 320k ehp out of a tanked legion that can shoot back, more if you want to completely tank bait it.
---
Nothing like trying to deny to your FC that you have a tractor beam in that utility high.
---
I have the Level V achievement for scanning. I scan a ton of wormholes for logistics/pvp while keeping a lookout for ghost sites.
---
Last night I happened to find two superior ghost sites in the same C5, got to test the tank of a new ghost site ship I theorycrafted and it worked very well.
---
I love scanning!
---
Over 300k ehp on a 500dps-ish legion, sounds like a better bet.
---
Please elaborate how CCP design choices made two huge blobs? What prevents the players from just being in individual alliances and not in coalitions
---
Cap scale pve should never have existed in the first place. 
---
Neither should capitals themselves.
---
+1 for this. If you've only ever done one playstyle, pick something else and try it. This goes double if you are rusted into your one singular playstyle and endlessly complain about anything changing; turn away from it, do other things unrelated for a while.
---
To be fair, there should be a place where all the proposals should be pinned. Go trough that pile once a year (at fanfest for example or just do a livestream), collect everything that already got implemented or will never happen and burn it.
---
Reddit and forums are nice, but a nice physical representation of the ideas pile never hurts :)
---
That's gonna be a big *yikes* from me.
---
Paint? THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH RUST FORMATION
---
Also, minnie ships should get passive hull regen
---
&gt;What prevents the players from just being in individual alliances and not in coalitions 
---
The game mechanics.
---
I too love it when one maths but leaves out a majority of one side to fudge the numbers
---
Players are playing the way they are because it’s the optimal way to play. People are always working on the best way to play the game, hence why fits are almost all the same, give or take some wacky stuff. We have doctrines that are more or less shared by all alliances give or take a few mods. Everyone rats in the same shops give or take a few mods. Why play in a way that’s going to disadvantage you? Because your enemy isn’t going to respect your choice to be different.
---
Hell yeah.
---
Eve's just going through chemo.
---
Nobody's healthy while going through chemo.
---
Can I have your shit?
---
What mechanics, elaborate
---
I get the point of your post.
---
It's just not a very good idea that you very clearly haven't thought through and now that people are pointing out your idea is bad, you are pulling the "but  that wasn't what I meant!"'-trick.
---
Unironically
---
Go steal from people. You don't need to awox but go to those big fights in a cepter and start looting them faction mods. That's how I got to 10b.
---
&gt;You go into a wormhole and roll all of your holes and keep eyes for any new sigs, while you bear in perfect safety,  then you go on   
---
&gt;r/eve  
---
&gt; and bitch and moan about how super safe the nullsec guys have it and dont realize you are a massive hypocrite because your middle name is dunning-kruger.
---
thanks for the salt!!!  =)
---
Rich coming from the group universally famous for exploiting every mistake CCP makes to the fullest at the expense of the games health. Now when CCP is beginning to fix those mistakes you guys are the loudest voices against fixing the game.
---
You're not interested in fixing that if it means losing an inch of influence and it's fucking disgusting that you try to take the high ground on this on account that you're also a consumer that pays a sub. This shit may fly in the nearby McDonalds but as far as I'm concerned you know where the Unsub button is. I honestly believe CCP agrees.
---
Changing the label doesn’t change the reality.   I’m over 40 so 3rd world reference is what I know.  Call it developing whatever.  It’s the same.   A large component of the population is below standard of living where spending hours on end in front of a computer game (again assuming the language barrier and power/internet connections aren’t an issue) is really not how these people will spend their time.  
---
There isn’t a market for these games in these countries, beyond a very small handful.  For different reasons.  Japan doesn’t have a critical mass of japanese language players for the new Japanese speakers to find community.  India and Korea are probably the countries on this list where I’d offer a tepid agreement but what’s the market for games in general in India?  It’s way underdeveloped for their technology and education.  SK has had the opportunity to play eve for a long time and it hasn’t really been picked up.  Why is that?  The others are just barely getting their populations out of poverty.  Call it what you wanna call it.  I call it 3rd world.  Whatever.  I call it a waste of time personally.  
---
But according to you ccp should piss away resources delivering a game to these countries.  You’re defending them like I’m wrong that these countries contain an audience that would yield more dedicated eve players.  
---
Seems like to me you just are white knighting 3rd world nations or feel compelled to argue on the internet to demonstrate how fucking smart you think you are.  Wikipedia warrior.  
---
Enjoy your day
---
No, it shouldn't. Things being perceived as ineffective and things being ineffective aren't the same thing. The CSM is specifically designed to be what they are, a sounding board for/from the community. Not game devs/politicians for a certain goal.
---
All of them.
---
The way players are playing is a direct reaction to the combination of the game mechanics.
---
YES CCPLEASE!!
---
That's the only thing left I want in EVE is for CCP to add a second pointless job to my already pointless internet spaceship job.
---
This \^\^\^
---
They benefit no ones playstyle and are literally killing the game
---
Lol, very intelligent responses
---
Hark, is that salt I hear falling from the sky?
---
That's called high sec ganking..
---
Doesn't need to be, it isn't a complex thing to understand.
---
Want a different output, provide a different input
---
Who is responsible for the input? Ccp. They are the devs, not us.
---
True. Still more dangerous than ratting under cap umbrella
---
They way players are playing is due to human nature on us taking the safest and fastest route to earn something. In this case it's isk and being in big alliances make it easy.
---
B0T + WERMT  this is the reason why nc+pl don't have pilots
---
Terrible null leadership that is followed by players is creating this lol not game mechanics
---
C'mon, Olmeca. You can't be this naive.
---
You know as well as we do that many of the people who voted for you did that in no small part due to you saying you would get changes made. Going back on that now by saying 'It just shows game understanding' is trying to work your way out of it.
---
That is only partially correct. This game is designed around players creating the content. Hence being a Sandbox. CCP is responsible for keeping the server running (costs money), updating to industry standards for networked communication (costs money), securing said network from hacking/cyber attacks (costs money). The base content in the game has always been just enough to get you started. Just like the toys in the sandbox just provide some beginning structure for you to use your imagination. 
---
If content were made by CCP tailored to Goonswarm, everyone NOT in goonswarm would likely be overrun by it. I know I can’t afford to lose my main ship every day and I have almost no combat skills (again sandbox, play you want).  If you as a player, want better content, take over the empire to which you have sworn allegiance and make some.
---
Yeah well, unlike you sir, I've spent my entire EVE career trying to get CCP to nerf people who don't play like me, and since I've been largely successful, why would I want to play in said inferior way?
---
Because it would be a healthy thing for me to do as a growing individual?
---
Yeah, lmao, no thanks.
---
Did you forget all preceding comments before jumping in? What an embarrassing habit you got there. I bet you have lots of friends with those impressive social skills!
---
Yes it should.  It's not just perception, the CSM HAS been ineffective for much of their time.  Their design is inherently bad.
---
TQ is quickly dieing the same death as SE. Hopefully CCP introduce more chemo changes to kill goons + pets
---
Leadership, reacting to the game mechanics.
---
It's not a coincidence they are all doing pretty much the same thing.
---
The way players are playing is due to human nature. We take the safest/fastest way to earn something. In this case it's isk and being in big alliances is the safest/fastest way.
---
&gt;All of them.
---
If you're going to make facetious arguments like that then let's take you literally: 
---
Does the undock mechanic cause a blue donut? Does dscan cause the blue donut?
---
No?
---
Then STFU and take the blame for player actions causing the blue donut or make an actual argument ya lazy git
---
It all depends on how you look at things. How much is your time worth? At my pay per hour, it's not worth my time to krabs for hours just to plex for a month sub.  
---
....But I still do it :X
---
Also how repeatable is it?
---
TIL "cancer" means players in a sandbox doing what they were encouraged to do from the beginning. 
---
This whole time I thought the definition was the majority of people doing a thing that makes their life easier and mine harder, even though I'm trying to kill them. 
---
Oh lol those are the same, nvm lmao I'm retarded
---
This.  I’ve fallen so hard into min maxing I have trouble even enjoying single player games these days
---
Elite dangerous also has pvp everywhere.
---
You're telling me things like dscan has no impact on how people play?
---
Ever been to a wormhole?
---
So you say you are telling the truth ... I would like to see your evidence of Hilmar being a Meth Sniffer ....
---
No you are not saying the truth, you are whiney bitches that cannot do themselves what they sperged at everybody when EVE was patched to FarmVille 2016/2017: Adapt or die HTFU and git gud scrubs roflcopter.
---
We haven't seen any uptick in k162s either
---
You turn off the Crynosural Field.
---
It's tough to get gables in highsec.
---
pbuh
---
I did not, you probably read only what you wanted to read.
---
Impressive social skills indeed.
---
Yeah but you can totally ignore it by playing private sessons
---
&gt;the CSM HAS been ineffective for much of their time
---
How do you know?
---
&gt;Their design is inherently bad.
---
That is a different point. If we want a game dev/politician group to push for certain changes, based on which they would be elected, you can try to propose that. ( I don't think that's a good idea but you're more than welcome to try).
---
But that's not what the current version of the CSM was meant to be or was selected for.
---
Found the vni spinner.
---
So creating massive coalitions to mine and not fight anyone is ccps game mechanic?
---
I know /r/Eve people are sometimes childish, but you cannot really mean a big part of the playerbase is also, right ?
---
Wait a minute...
---
Oh no, not the mediatic backslash...!!
---
Ok I think we are getting somewhere, DSCAN has created blue donught!
---
yes, didnt see any big blobs in there
---
&gt; wormhole splash
---
It's under "Jump Activation"
---
Buy PLEX and tell your mates that you're a market genius but can't share your secrets.
---
Big ships require lots of infrastructure to construct, so yes. It does encourage people working together.
---
fozzie soft encourages large alliances rather than small.
---
logistics for SRP/citadel fuel/nullsec markets all encourage large alliances for the most efficiency 
---
hell research the build up to WW1 for why mutual defense treats in real life lead to large alliances,  the same applies ot EVE
---
-------------------
---
seriously, give 1 benefit to a small alliance holding sov in nullsec,   vs doing the same in a large.
---
i   stab eve-online with giant  sword  by mining in 0.5 athanors... i think would  grab machette (rorqual) and kill eve in null by mining more (asteroids)
---
so far my  mackinaw murdered over 80000 asteroids..
---
if barges would have killmarks for asteroids mine would be master of eve and top and if we would have asteroid killmails and industrial zkill.
---
A goon a manbaby? naaaah, you crazy.
---
He's right though. Alliance wars in Eve are pretty high-risk, so you use optimized (winning) strategies whenever possible. The optimum strategy in the current era is to blue everyone and rorq mine for titans 25/7 until everyone in your coalition has 5+ supercaps. 
---
I dunno what CCP can do about this; "having more dudes" will *always* be an advantage. However, there's probably things they could do to encourage fights. For example, taking titans/supercarriers off the strategic field would reduce the risk involved in wars (if you can't physically deploy 5 years of mining work on one grid, you can't lose it and get failcascaded in a single battle, so it's safer to take fights); this might let people get into wars more often. Making it more useful to hold a lot of space might also be good.
---
So basically being the Obama of EVE Online?
---
(I mean, I voted for him twice, but he was a very status quo President to say the least.)
---
So much this. Most games don't even have a tenth of the depth Eve has.
---
&gt; The truth is that players need a reason to log in.  
---
And here lies the crux of it all. With 80% of null blued up and 20% not giving an obvious head on fight (suicide), there is no 'exciting reason' to log in, at least in null sec. Yea, you can login for the chores and rat a bit here and there, make some isk, many people will go on for the daily pinged fleets and occasional CTA, but these dont really mean much, there is no overarching narrative or story line. 
---
The biggest blue donut in Eve is the first and foremost, the biggest problem.
---
Goddamn it NC will start to win wars now.
---
Literally everyone does that. Drone assist was beyond broken and we (Pandemic Legion, NC, Ect) abused it too. No jump fatigue and travel refits for supers let us cross the map and dunk any caps in low and null. 
---
Players react and make choices based on the nature of the game. The Cold War era was due to the indy focused releases. The whaler era is a thing because the blackout related changes are a thing. If the game mechanics didn’t favor a certain play style then we wouldn’t do it
---
so a ship they never intended for individual line member use is causing players to want to own and use them individually?
---
depends. a cap with a cyno alt on standby is pretty safe. a subcap isnt though.
---
where does this narrative come from? it's so dumb, why is it so wide spread?
---
yes
---
I mean if you want to pretend wormhole groups don't work together in an identical way to goons and tapi  or horde and nc etc then that's up to you
---
Are you referring to “womyn power” from pizza?
---
yes because mechanics (mass limitations, dynamic connections, delayed local)
---
ummm. Do you even know what CSM is?
---
What narrative? Their is a post every day in r/Eve saying EVE is dying, look at PCU, CCP needs to fix game..blah blah.
---
I am just pointing out that most of the issues have been created by players and we cannot keep blaming CCP.
---
why do you think people's lives are so different from different parts of space? wormholer live is completeley different from null live is completely different from lowsec life is completely different from high sec life. because the mechanics change betweens those areas.
---
I’m just trying to get to the root of his “game mechanics” caused this argument lol
---
&gt; Going back on that
---
Lol, going back on what mate? Here is a direct quote from my campaign document.
---
"I also recognize the fact that CSM is ultimately a focus group. People seldom get their own specific ideas inside the game. But voters still deserve to know what I think the ways to fix Eve’s main problems are. And CSM candidates should be elected with their ideas showcased."
---
Here is a more detailed response on exactly the same topic.

Why wouldn't you want every capable pilot to have one?

Looking at their website, the game looks very similar to the EVE Echoes mobile game. It's like CCP and Zlon are competing for Pearl Abyss's parental approval.

---
When was the game ever marketed there?

&gt;But according to you ccp should piss away resources delivering a game to these countries. You’re defending them like I’m wrong that these countries contain an audience that would yield more dedicated eve players
---
I didn't say that. I didn't even say I fully support OP's idea. I disagreed with your statement that people in these countries have better things to do/don't/won't play games etc.

---
Yeah, no. We absolutely do exploit the game's mistakes, but in general, we do it to force them to be closed. Pretty much always to our own benefit, of course. We ain't philanthropists. See: tracking titans, technetium, transporter room, logserver, facwar forex, and so on.

---
Primarily the ones that made consolidation the best and most efficient way to earn ISK (Rorquals, supercapital ratting). Also the recent changes have made it so that to do these things safely you need to consolidate even further (cyno changes, blackout).
---
 In addition, a lack of proper ingame channels to work within large groups meaning that a majority of communication happens outside of the game. This creates an environment where external tools are created to make management of groups easier, allowing groups to become larger with little to no setbacks.
---
Probably the biggest factor is that the game really does favor larger groups and most changes have a larger effect on smaller groups. A small group can go out and have fun but you won't ever see a small, independent group making a dent in the empires of nullsec or becoming a real threat.
---
Hope those answers were intelligent enough for you.

How the game works and combat mechanics:  Blackout, cyno, escalation changes for end game
---
Economy: Look at Jita volume.  Everything industry is plummeting with the changes.  If fixing the economy means people doing less ingame, then i’m wrong.  
---
But SWG made it so people played and did less.  Look how that turned out
---
No I didn't.
---
I said the way players play is a direct reaction to the game mechanics.
---
You wrote it wrong : ~~NC + PL + FRAT~~ , should be  : REKTD  + FRAT + others
---
Cuz they don’t get used lol so putting every pilot in one at the cost of having diplomacy with 65% of null is detrimental to the game... not a mechanic killing the game, player actions
---
Well, I believe that due to the advent of GaaS, and offering the same experience while being less financially and mechanically curmbersome. Looter shooters in many ways have events similar to MMO's in a progressively changing world, while still having a mainline narritive.
---
Plus, since MMO's were birthed in the beginnings of the widespread usage of the internet, they had to consider the limitations of the era. Now that technology is so pervasively connected, mandatory subscription models look pretty antiquated. GaaS is the lean version of the MMO genre, and while it can lead to exploitive MTX pratices, it can create content more effectively than early 2000's era gaming ever could.
---
What is the Gui ? It looks sooo clean.

Hilmar has spearheaded projects personally using eves income.  And failed them all.

That’s why it’s fucking scary that he came BACK to eve “with answers” and an ego to not listen to anyone.... He has a horrible track record of ideas for longevity 
---
Period
---
Explain? Details?
---
Hahahahahah, 49 words out of a 3275 word document.
---
And in the response you acknowledge the fact CSM is a focus group while immediately going full-politician and saying:
---
&gt;But in many ways, I don’t see my proposals as “my agenda”.
---
So you either are pushing for your proposals/agenda/whatever you want to call it or you're in a focus group.
---
Continuing you say:
---
&gt;That’s why I say I’d be lucky if one of these ideas go into the game.
---
That sounds like pushing for your 'proposals'.
---
So what is it, dear CSM Olmeca?
---
Yes they are. That's why people are constantly bitching about them.
---
Aww. Lets make stain accessible only by wh and jump drive!
---
i will trust my intuition on this one... all roads dont lead to shangri la. the existential dread the devs have time and again continued to feed to their captive audience in this game are indicators of failures too great and far reaching to resolve by just wishing it better. ultimately hilmar has taken responsibility for his failure to develop this game into something the users actually want to play anymore, by selling the company, so as we await the transfer of ownership and development of eve to the new owners, from the admitted failures, there really isn't anything to do but unsubscribe. if pearl abyss really is up to the challenge of fixing eve, then we'll just have to wait and see.  no sense in rewarding CCP and hilmar for a job poorly done by helping them score their severance, to the contrary you should do everything in your power to prevent them from scoring the numbers they need, so that the new owners can use that money they would have been giving to people leaving the company, and use it to develop eve.... that is, if you sincerely believe pearl abyss is that type of company (hint: they're not)
---
Fully agreed.
---
Which NPC null do you live in?
---
As I said you aren't interested in fixing the game when it's not as straight up as closing an exploit after you're already ahead of everyone else exploiting it :) Which is your current situation. I personally believe this is an intentional overreaction on account of the Mittani to hedge against what's yet to come that might really hurt. Cuz let's be honest spoopy local and 300mil cyno tax isn't going to be the pebble that topples the cart over for GSF.
---
Players are responsible for making the content in the game, yes. However, you're hideously restricting the meaning of the word "content" to mean "spaceship fights." Let's say, theoretically, my idea of game content is to create Pax Aspergia. This idea of content comes in direct opposition to the idea of content roughly analogous to "let me shoot all of your spaceships without losing mine, forever, with no possible evolution or adaptation on your part because you're a subhuman species incapable of learning or basic pattern recognition. Spodumain, lol." Both ideas of content are equally valid, and neither are sacrosanct. This is a game about strength and competition, after all.
---
Not really. There were logical people who responded that recognize what I pointed out is a problem. While they may disagree with my suggestions to fix it they can still see the biggest picture. There were also a couple people like you as well, bitter and extremely passive aggressive with mocking responses. It's just a shame I chose to engage you at all, you obviously just want to "be right".
---
Great, what mechanics would dissuade players from forming big blobs?  Because every change that gets discussed is dismissed under Malcanis’s law as hurting small groups more than the blobs.
---
Its almost as if its impossible for mechanics to fight human nature.
---
Well it's harvest season, people don't have time to play games when they are outside gathering the crop, duh.

Those are actually well thought out responses! It is pretty impressive the out of game infrastructure that groups have put in place. However, I for one love the cyno changes it adds difficulty for response fleets. I still move my supers and JF all over the place, adapt or die.
---
While you were typing this the max online player count for tonight hit 20k for a few minutes before dropping to 11k. Between bots and alpha accounts that's probably 3-5k real people playing the game.

I can desire a game exploit to be closed for fully selfish reasons. Like, transport room. Gee, why wouldn't I want for people to be forcibly "jump cloned" at no cooldown with no warning to an NPC station? We figured out how to do it at Goon Scale™ and CCP's sphincter closed so fast on that shit that it left a soft serve swirl on the top.
---
Me neither. But many eve players are autists and will sit there. That is the only thing about the blackout that I can't just adjust to. Spamming d-scan and being cautious is one thing. But it's not possible to avoid dying to site campers, it's out of my control. Especially when there are other things to focus on. And I don't live in null, I have no umbrella or support. I pretty much just dive in.
---
Your right! How DARE people act like people! It's unreasonable to ask a game dev to account for human nature! ACT IN THE PARTICULAR ARBITRARY WAY CCP ENVISIONED AND ONLY THAT WAY!!!!11!! YOUR KILLING THE GAME ACTING HUMAN!!1!!1
---
I had a ringtone of headliner screaming at rive " SHUT UP RIVE, LET THEM CALL FUCKNG TARGETS!" One day in church I didn't have my ringer off.. it was great.
---
Two big problems 
---
- There is no actual incentive for conflict 
---
- no benefit  for operating in smaller groups. 
---
You could incentivize conflict in eve easily by adding benefits for victory but that would require work on ccp’s part and make the sandbox less of a sandbox 
---
For example
---
Ie if you have some mechanic where the winners of a huge null war get a skin commemorating victory. People would fight for that but ccp would have to put in the work of ensuring the sides where evenly matched. Far too much work and people would pile to the winning side because well, people want to win and again there is no benefit for operating in smaller groups.
---
Just spitballing here but those two problems are hard to overcome without real work on the part of the developers. Players want to win and will do what it takes to win it’s up to the developers to create an environment where N+1 is not the solution
---
I'll list off the ones off the top of my head.
---
1. In a pitched battle, the only thing that beats a supercap blob is a larger supercap blob. Supercapitals have an order of magnitude more EHP than the next best thing, which makes them uncontestable in sufficient numbers and a very efficient use of players/accounts. Subcaps or even dreads don't come close to being able to contest.
---
2. Supercaps being able to be repaired means a smaller supercap fleet sufferers disproportionate losses when fighting a bigger blob. If you lose critical mass of titans to DD volley enemy titans, your ability to kill enemy titans and reduce incoming alpha drops off a cliff, while your titans are being picked off one by one.
---
3. The enormous cost and time needed to build titan fleets means they are not very replaceable on the operational time scale. If you are on the losing side of a supercap fight and you lose 20 titans. It's not likely you can show up to the next one with all 20 replaced. If you had spare titan hulls, you would have brought them to the first fight since Titan pilots can be injected for only somewhat more isk than a fitted titan. Once you lose the first battle, that's it, any further supercap fights (if there are any) you'll have an even smaller fleet that loses critical mass even more easily. Thus the answer is to not fight a supercap fight at all if you can't win, and the best way to win is to have more because there's really no skill involved in a titan DD fight besides following basic orders in 1% tidi. How do you "get more"? Blue people with titans.
---
4. Capitals are extremely oppressive to subcaps. Lose supercap superiority and you can't really use capital ships, while your enemies can and will to push your shit in. If you have to bring guardians since enemy titans can alpha your apostles, but your enemy can drop apostles, you are in for a rough time even if the titan can't blap your subcaps directly.
---
5. The continuous removal of mechanical safety in nullsec in favor of player provided safety. Local and cyno changes are examples of this, other examples are PANIC and NSA self scram. Mechanical safety such as local allowing barges to warp out when an enemy enters system allows for safety without aid from the alliance. Whereas things like Rorquals and Supers require an umbrella to function since they self tackle. If you don't have an umbrella Rorqs and Supers are unuseable, since if you escalate the enemy escalates harder and you lose all your shit. If you lose enough Supers/Rorquals you chum the waters and attract attention from Imperium/Legacy/Pamfam sigs and SNUFF. The sharks gather and your members are going to have a very rough time.
---
6. Continuing from 5. With that pre-req for effective use, Supers and Rorquals turn into extremely strong "win more" tools, where you can only use them if you can save them with supercaps on a regular basis. If you can't you don't get to use them and you have much lower per member isk/mineral income. You'll never be able to build your own supercaps at a rate approaching bloc rates even even adjusted for alliance member count. The only way your members can improve their own income is to leave for wormholes or join a blob so they can use big ships to make money.
---
7. The continuous addition of non-scaling costs that encourage higher usage to spread out the cost of the fee. The cyno change is one of the better examples. Moving your personal suitcase carrier costs 300m per cyno per jump. Moving 10 dreads to drop on a dumb ratting super costs 300m per cyno per jump. Moving 250 titans to helicopter dick a region costs 300m per cyno per jump. Currently we have brick blops and a FAX sitting on the 1DQ keepstar as a permanent cyno, allowing our caps to jump to staging in perfect safety and for free to the pilots. That cost is fixed. Other examples include unlimited super storage in keepstars. A keepstar to allow your super pilots to get out of their space coffins makes sense if you have hundreds of them. If you only have 4-5 super pilots they are stuck in their coffins and a keepstar costs more than their supers combined. Very strong incentive to join a blob so they can get more value out of their super pilots.
---
I can add more if you want, but those reasons should be enough.

Designed in qt designer and exported to a python file
---
Why are you asking me, I'm not a game dev.
---
We have a set of mechanics, they promote turtling up and shitting out supers like there's no tomorrow while recruiting enough people to sit in them all.
---
That's the way to achieve what ever it is the big groups want to achieve in null.
---
do understand that goons are there as a sig not as an alliance or coalition you cant count the whole alliance in that
---
Fuq me dead, another clueless space cadet, they made a sand box, end of story.

Thanks Dunk!
---
Adding a new titan/super will just land us in this same position in a few years.  Remove supers/titans, reimburse players for them, reimplement them in new form that discourages proliferation.
---
I went solopvping the other day for the first time in months. There's still kills out there. Even if my normal style dies entirely, I'll still be able to have fun in this game.

First, thank you for taking the flair bait. It warms my heart every time people go for it.
---
Second, I continue to agree with CSM not becoming game devs.

Third, actually the unselect all from the Redeem Queue was implemented but idk how much Dunk had to do with that ;)
---
That’s all I have known to come from Goonswarm. Mowing over anyone who doesn’t follow their edicts. A more successful CODE out in Nullsec. Complaining that there’s have nothing to do because your group owns the world is just lazy quite honestly. Steal a Citadel, subvert leadership, don’t be a sheep. It’s a video game where you can do anything.

Are CCP aware of this of should I submit a bug report?
---
Hey Brisc,
---
To a certain extend agreed, however if CSM candidates want to run like politicians they should be held accountable and being ok with being called out.
---
I also think that being a CSM member includes talking to the community, maybe even esp people you don't agree with. Since the CSM is a community focus group and all that.
---
I enjoyed the way you conducted yourself while on the CSM, mostly by being very active here and not being afraid to go for a discussion. That's all
---
the hives was a deliberate change, mentioned in dev blog/patch notes. so them having tons of connections is intended.
---
Classic eq was brutal.
---
No offense but you are talking shit. If any entitiy wants to fuck over your "independent group" they will. Nothing has changed.
---
And WHs have been around for quite some time. If you want that type of danger go have fun, nobody was stopping you.
---
And also, you just pointed out the biggest flaw with these changes, "small". You are in absolute minority and you havent even begun building your empire. Wait until you actually put assets worth killing in space and we can have this discussion again. Your alliance will get turbofked til next tuesday.
---
Considering the video game is about ruthless competition, uh, yes, we're obviously going to mow over whoever the fuck we can. Also, who's complaining? I'm not. If someone else in my tribe is complaining, go bitch at them. I ain't the Thought Police.

Speaks of the AFK-Farms that unsubbed because they actually would have to pay attention now and actually would have to play the game instead of print isk afk while bots scraping intel through bad game design to make them safe ... the irony ...
---
You literally said all of the game mechanics are causing the game to die. You misspoke. Don't die on this hill; just be humble, admit your mistake and insist that your overall point still stands. That way people have to actually deal with your point rather than annoy you over a dumb comment.
---
Or... Continue as is. Lol
---
As I said, an entitled child.
---
"A lot of players are working together and I can't kill them, so clearly the game's at fault."
---
&gt; In addition, a lack of proper ingame channels to work within large groups meaning that a majority of communication happens outside of the game. This creates an environment where external tools are created to make management of groups easier, allowing groups to become larger with little to no setbacks.
---
This is one of the big things people don't touch on enough.
---
People have been asking for alliance taxes for as long alliances have been a thing. Today they exist, but only in organizations with the organizational power to convince its member corps to comply, and with the software development power to track taxes owed and paid. This is an example of where large entities gain advantages over smaller ones which go well outside "n+1". If CCP were to add alliance taxes, it would make it easier for GoonSwarm to administrate our alliance taxes. It would make our lives a little bit easier. It would also allow all of the alliances who don't currently have this source of income to suddenly gain it. 
---
One big thing CCP could do to help smaller alliances grow and succeed would be to start providing these necessary tools themselves. A CCP created or endorsed discord bot for example, which would automatically link discord membership/access to in-game characters. Better membership tracking, to see who is active and who isn't. Maybe even some intel/counterintel tooling. All of the tooling currently only available to those capable of writing and hosting it themselves should be provided by CCP in a package that can be trusted.
---
Along the same lines Eve imposes so many chores on the players that the best way to deal with them is usually to have a small number of people who are specialized in the task and enjoy that particular style of gameplay. So much of Eve favors large groups by sheer economies of scale. Larger groups have more man power, can specialize more, can have more specialists, so are more resistant to burnout. 
---
A small alliance might have everyone for themselves running JF to empire. Or one person running a JF service. Or be stuck relying on outside groups. The first sucks for anyone who doesn't own a JF, the second is at severe risk of burnout, and the third is unreliable and dangerous. A larger alliance winds up with a team of pilots for this, people can come and go without interrupting the flow of things.
---
A small alliance might have a single really good FC. Whether that alliance lives or dies depends on that one person. A large alliance will have several high tier FCs and possible dozens of other FCs at various skill levels. Any one person can burn out and things keep functioning.
---
A big part of this just boils down to the [Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Larger organizations are more resilient.

you are just clarifying the player driven issues... they wouldn’t get used for everything if so much of null wasnt grouped up and blue’d up

For exemple, it is not the players who lowered the skill requirement for Capital Ships, it is CCP in 2011. So with the decent coaching and financial program created by coalitions, it permitted the Capital Proliferation. If the skills remained as it was in 2011, there would certainly have less capital ships today in the game. And it was just ONE part of the dumbing-down done by CCP. They did so much that even Goonswarm stopped their recrutement scam when it happened, because it was so obvious that massive recrutement and massive capital equipment was the future.
---
Obvious not for CCP, thought.
---
The players are not to blame. We play as the mechanics permit us. The mechanics are created by... CCP.
---
Ooh, thanks for enlightening me, cognac! I'm also curious to learn as a new CS graduate looking for a job, why is this the better design and what does it offer?
---
Actually both are not true, the hardware was programmed to run on SI, but accepted and processed imperial units, and the displays showed both, depending on the circumstance/machine.
---
You see the average comptence level of any large Nullsec-Group atm, when they cannot form at least a few hundred bodies and outnumber the opponent 3:1 at least. Maybe NCdot is still above that level idk, but for the rest its true ....
---
Endgame has expanded in the expantions, Raids and High level dungeons for pve and ofc theres a pvp community as well. But it isn't much, and it does get a bit repetitive, they keep adding more, but when i quit soon after the PoF expantion, it was just too slow with new things to do, and also its a massive grind for very very little (fashion and convinience)
---
&gt; Elders Scrolls Online is having problems in a lot of areas
---
Biggest area ESO has problems in is Elder Scrolls Online itself.
---
Well, its not so much their deliberate design choices.
---
It's more a lack of designed safeguards to prevent it.
---
Which of course, after so long without them, attempts to put them in place will seem like CCP deliberately trying to destroy the game.
---
Cap and super Pve is fine, gives you something to do with the ship. The problem is it supers and aps doing sub cap level Pve. Give caps there own sights to run and you can balance them better. Hell just add capital escalation to sight. 
---
Kill the escalation in that cap then finish it off in a sub.
---
Do i want the game back? no just nerf dotlan and scrap the goddamed injectors already
---
Umbrella? no im not under i dont have response fleet either most of the time.
---
local back? maybe with 15mins to an hr delay. Space feels too empty now even when someone else is in
---
Alright lets answer:
---
My isk made is 52m from missions in curse and lost is about nothing. I plex.
---
Cynabal? depends if the JF resupplied me in ships. I rarely go solo especially since blackout ive no idea what im against and the damn cynabal requires something beefier than a caracal and faster than a brutix. 
---
Last time i took a FAIR fight willingly was about 8days ago . I camp a bit as well.
---
Ive roamed 0.0 about 30 times in 2 years cuz i dont like it and found instawarping botlike stuff 10 times or so.
---
No, it's definitely not irrelevant. The fact it can be said about every candidate is a sign people are doing it wrong. So we should call each and every one of them out on this. Saying everyone does it so we shouldn't say/do anything is the dumbest way to deal with that.
---
You occasionally see that one dude who posts saying how hardass wspace is over null when everyone knows every player is some level of being risk averse. Now that the pvp playerbase is on the same page w/no local, I doubt youd see that arguement being kept, especially now with the cyno change. It's good time to play the game.
---
ok
---
Hi!
---
Nice post!
---
My corp left our major null sec group in search of different pastures. Life was too easy, we wanted it to be harder, we ended up in Low Sec. It was nice going on small gang roams in the neighborhood and venturing into null taking what engagements we could until a blob formed. 
---
In the spirit of trying more things, after playing this game since 2012, I finally tried Faction Warfare. 
---
FACTION WARFARE IS FUN! It is a series of repeated engagements. But each engagement requires skill, speed, knowledge. (not to others: don't enter FW thinking you have to plex non-stop, join it to extract the content you want) 
---
I also got into market trading. Its not the most profitable since rorquals, but its been fun!
---
There are still so many things in this game to try.
---
&gt; constant struggle to encourage people to go rat in a Myrm or mine in a Procurer for 1/3 the ISK they and I both know they could make flying with WTM in highsec.
---
Why?
---
Let them go fly with WTM in highsec and then come back to provi for the pvp roaming. Best of both worlds.
---
*yikes!*
---
Theres more PvE now, but not released often enough to keep it interesing.
---
I swear looking at this thread is so difficult. OP has an excellent point, but most of the eve player base has consumed industrial quantities of kool aid and don't take a second to think. 
---
But oh boy dont forget to upvote the pcu posts! Keep drinking the kool aid!
---
FYI, it's Winter *Coalition*
---
Lmao you need your hand held through everything
---
I appreciate you putting the effort into the response. See below for some quick comments:
---
1-5. Honestly, I don't have much of a response to this because this is quite convoluted. Supers are the "end game" of EVE for alot of players. Skill injectors and rorq mining have made them more prolific. But, previously before rorq changes Goons and NC/PL would just stomp on everyone. The current changes have now allowed EVERYONE to have supers but also created huge blobs. I don't think blueing each other is the right solution. 
---
6. Most common saying in EVE, "don't use what you cannot afford to lose"
---
7. I do like the cyno changes because it adds challenges to response fleets. And the 300M is not the trust cost per jump, you cannot assume you will lose the recon every time.
---
You need to paint all this duct tape and spackling paste in rust like pattern, so that other guys are not laughing at you...
---
Nah, I don't  care about being right. 
---
You idea was still bad though.
---
I'm not bitter, you idea was just bad.
---
You do know you can already "look at" pretty much any ship in Eve, right?
---
Yeah, I've done loads of different things.
---
Maybe not super hard into all of them, but definitely enough to "get it".
---
There are then some that clearly stand above others as being truly compelling and some that are useful, and some that are neither.
---
be a gatecamper.
---
A fking game that actually gets attention and an expansion worth calling an expansion.
---
The game in june had positive aspects and negative aspects. Guess which ones we should have removed?
---
Yes. Its our sov, you come into our space you fking pay the price. You didnt before, we still lost stuff and you certainly got more advantage now. There has to be an upside in actually owning sov beyond bragging rights.
---
I can understand this argument and I have no issues with a delayed version. But not a long delay, there needs to be counterplay or nothing will change. The lack of counterplay is the problem.
---
I didnt lose stuff before because I was active, I rolled holes, I made sure my area was clear, I watched intel bla bla bla. Now, none of my knowledge and activity matters cause I can get fked by a cloaky ship. Thats not balance, only in the heads of people who want easier kills is that balance. And we have seen plenty of those around. If you play the game "correctly" you should never lose anything whilst doing PvE. If you fuck up then you kinda have it coming.
---
I used to solo roam and always took fights even when I knew I was gonna lose. Because "elite" PvPers are fking risk averse, they seldom take fights they can lose which means that you have to do it in order to actually get a fight. So the lack of content isnt really because NS was too safe, its because PvPers want fights they know they can win instead of actually just fighting for the luls. So people back out of fights constantly.
---
Many times, but bots isnt my concern. Fk them but they aint my problem, thats CCPs problem. And if I wanted to kill bots I would have done it with some effort. I just dont care about bots/people who are active and can get away. Besides I never really go for PvE targets, why the fuck would I? They pose no threat and therefore no excitement.
---
Plenty longer than it will going forward on this path.
---
Tweak your skill queue
---
Too real.
---
Ah yes the many historic US nationalist groups of Eve
---
yup recent data show I am
---
&gt; people using the game to generate stories.
---
This so much!
---
Emergent pvp games like EVE build amazing narratives. One problem is people suck at telling those stories, and another is that people suck at recognizing those stories when they happen to them.
---
Like the Clarion Call stuff. Those stories aren't actually all that rare, but they recognized the story and presented it.
---
Not for long, I haven't.  But I've been here long enough to see that many of the issues /r/eve has with the game are issues /r/eve creates for itself.  The guy suggesting there is only one possible fleet composition and one possible strategy that only works if the enemy fleet decides to play along is an example.
---
&gt; Your suggestion regarding 'just stopping null sec logistics' is too uninformed to even respond to.
---
I didn't suggest stopping it, I just suggested that you don't have to do it in ways that you already know how to easily counter.  You can source stuff from places other than Jita, build more stuff locally, take a different route to Jita, actually do recon, not put all your eggs in one basket at every stage of the journey.  Obviously nothing is going to be as perfect and safe as just instantly jumping halfway to Jita, but it's not impossible like the other guy is claiming.  People just need to undock and actually do stuff, or try something that's different in the game they complain is stagnant.
---
&gt; So let's say you go with jams, the attacker can still not fight the support fleet, since the amount of EWAR needed to effectively fight them will mean the support lacks the DPS to kill them. And even then they can just wait for you to fail a jam since RNG and keep killing your freighter.
---
Killing their fleet is a solution, but not the only solution to an escort mission.  However, this is beside the point.  The problem he brought up was "damage mitigation proportional to incoming damage."  That's what EWAR does.  Forcing enemy ships to engage your fleet is another problem, that is what jams can help with.  EWAR is a not a blanket solution to every situation he suggested, there's no reason to think you can hammer the same solution into every problem.  Sure EWAR doesn't work on sieged dreads, but if they're that eager to take bait... bait them.  This recurring theme of taking every idea and using it in the dumbest way possible is a pretty obvious problem in itself.
---
&gt; So you'd need such a support fleet for each freighter which is usually used to haul larger volume, lower value stuff, that people will stop doing that after 2, maybe 3 times. So good job, you've found a way to empower large blocs. Since they will probably be the ones able to get enough people together to make this work.
---
Again, beside the point.  I don't think the guy suggesting convoys is suggesting CCP remove jump freighters altogether, there's no reason to assume they couldn't still be used to safely transport goods, one might just change their scope from "always the best forever" to "supplying enough for small alliances, but clunky for megablocs."
---
Of course, Eve players are afraid of change and change has driven plenty of them away already, so I wouldn't seriously suggest making this change now.  But running freighters isn't completely impossible and Eve isn't exactly known for being easy and painless.  I'm sure these ideas aren't perfect, but I'd rather come up with flawed ideas than just give up immediately when encountering some change.
---
They do fly WTM in highsec, they also come home and rat/mine to keep our ADMs up because they care and want to make our home defensible. The problem is that they shouldn't be more rewarded for highsec PvE than nullsec PvE.
---
its 2 years long
---
Good to know maybe i'll give it another chance some time
---
Even close competitors like no man's sky and elite dangerous.
---
They have way more breadth, but so little depth.
---
I can probably guarantee you that people didn't have fun in those wars you're talking about...
---
One guy posted one here that was 9b.
---
Are you in NC?
---
He plays the base, not the bass.
---
You are describing low sec. It was always there, people didnt move to NS for the low sec or the WH experience.
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
---
This is pretty much what is left for me.
---
I've used capitals for things, but not really done significant capital engagements.
---
And as much as I would love to fly a carrier or dread for something seriously, it just seems like a quick way to lose a lot of isk.
---
I think there's a good concerted effort to get it to offer more than it offered. I'm trying to be a part of that effort.
---
not on primae :D
---
&gt;iterate on a change
---
lmao
---
I mean having local turned on lets me know they're in local, but I'm not arguing for local, I'm arguing for better counterplay.
---
The fact you said "rad" proves to me you're not 15, but 35.
---
TY been looking for a decent gui look and haven't stumbled on that one yet.
---
This is in fact the sound i meant, the constant pulsing/breathing sound. It's gone, exooki says it's a bug so hopefully it'll get fixed soon
---
Blasters are just fun plus its pretty fast in warp and on align with the hyperspacial subsystem. It's self tank isn't bad tho it's outclassed in tank by the legion. I find it a fun ship when solo or with a couple friends roaming around wormholes or lowsec or less blobby areas of nullsec like provi. It's a good hunter ship with the right subsystem and can still put out big DPS with blasters. 
---
Gotta be selective about your targets but it does its it's job in that role well imo.
---
&gt; isn't anything to do but unsubscribe. i
---
I'd rather keep telling interesting stories.
---
most systems you can cover with dscan in 2 warps, one to a midpoint and another from the midpoint to the out gate, sometimes a 3. If you are taking 5 minutes to do that i'm aftaid blackout is not the problem
---
Dear Croc, this will go as we predicted. There will be less fighting than you think because shit will get controlled much much more than before. NS will adapt and I promise you content will be much much less, the data already shows this. It will get worse.
---
Yeah he forgot to put snuff on the imperium side. Thats a bunch more supers / titans.
---
&gt; Supers are the "end game" of EVE for alot of players.
---
Endgame doesn't mean "no natural predators". Supers need to have a non-super hard counter that is efficient in terms of pilots used.
---
&gt;  The current changes have now allowed EVERYONE to have supers but also created huge blobs. 
---
That's not true, you need an umbrella to use rorquals or you attract Snuff/Partisans/Reavers. Rorquals tackle themselves so in a blackout situation, they are really easy to catch. If at the end of 7 minutes, the enemy forms a bigger cap fleet than you, your rorqs die, end of story. Rorqs actually have a fairly lengthy non excavator payback time of around 20-30 hours, which is actually quite long in a "get tackled and you die" situation. So no, not "everyone" can use rorqs to build a supercap fleet. You have to be able to fight off dread using gankers on a regular basis before you can use Rorqs effectively. 
---
5 minute beacon visible to everyone, and on the in game map. People are going to be hunting cyno recons.
---
having the same launcher bug atm
---
Definitely.
---
I think Provi though is an interesting difficulty in this regard as it isn't really what nullsec spaces mechanics were designed around.
---
Not sure how to rectify that.
---
I think increasing the profitability of nullsec can happen once the risk is more even, like with resource depletion encouraging sprawl, and the new cyno changes making a perfect umbrella harder to maintain.
---
Then increasing loot or spawn rates of deds and maybe adding new officers that are diamond rats that actually call in fleets to support them and such.
---
So far, lowsec PVE seems to be at the peak for low cost investment, low sp, fairly safe and rewarding.
---
Yeah, i burned out myself, but i would, it can be great fun, i mostly lacked a group tonplay with, guilds arent the same as in eve in my experience.
---
Yeah just fucking get your alliance to burn 30 jumps and kill a camp so one person can move through.
---
Jesus dude do you even think for a second about your responses?
---
Its hard to get to content when you will die to every funnel system on the way.
---
Isn't that a T2 rigged hull rather than a full fit?
---
Yeah we know he has been helping ;) none of this is new to us haha
---
Makes sense. Nerf nullsec spawns to get rid of the wormhole superhighway, buff wormhole spawns inside Drifter wormholes to create a wormhole superhighway...... #thinking
---
I feel that as a good trade to drop the single most powerful force in gaming second only to God mode on someone's head.
---
USA in local?
---
yes t1 frigs are cheep
---
Thats why you need reasons to fight. CCP removed every real reason for doing so and people are shocked things have stagnated. 
---
Not saying people are gonna sacrifice their superfleets cause ye that wont happen. But if there is a reason to fight sooner or later supers will get dropped. And thats how fights start. Its not scripted.
---
I didn't look super closely but the item window was scrollable and there was a nestor and saber inside it as well.
---
i didn't mis speak at all - he's saying i said things that i didn't.
---
you can quite clearly see what i wrote, it wasn't what he said i did.
---
Snuff isn't on Imperium side.
---
Also an increased probability of drifter wormhole spawning, and increased NPCs capital and super capital spawns.
---
not quite sure how you got to there from my statement.
---
It was a T2 rigged hel that the owner forgot to take a nestor out of.
---
I haven't noticed it for my home hole, but I have encountered multiple C2, C3, and C4 systems in the last week or two which have had six or more wormholes connected to them, some K162 some T405/other roaming. It feels weird seeing one of those systems, and much weirder seeing one every day.
---
&gt; they wouldn’t get used for everything if so much of null wasnt grouped up and blue’d up
---
yes they would.
---
there are 2 ways to increase your groups ability to do shit.
---
firstly; increase the effectiveness of each resource you have
---
secondly; increase the amount of resources you have.
---
people are a resource, and you make them more effective by putting them in more effective ships.
---
the most effective ships are supers, so you put as many people as you can in as many supers as you can. if supers weren't the best ships, and just having more people wasn't an advantage then nobody would do that. however this isn't an instanced game so there's no reason why you can't, shouldn't or wouldn't get as many people as you can - and equally there's no restriction on what ships they ca fly so you put them all in supers and titans.
---
My man, this just isnt true. You have a certain part that wont change but most would have agreed to balanced changes. In fact, just look back at all the things that have been said and you can actually see balance being used as an argument a lot of the time.
---
Your side ignored all of this and just went full on "get fked" mode. If you guys had stopped for a second and actually listened you would have seen that most would agree to changes. People arent leaving the game because these changes are fked, they are leaving because it only shows that CCP hasnt learned anything from their past mistakes. They just lost confidence in them and therefore the game.
---
A pilot unwilling to drop a 40mill ceptor because of lack of srp I would argue has no place in null. I loved flying, changing, and losing my ceptors and sort of made a name for myself. Some occasions I rejected srp and I always had 10+ on the ready. Just a fast paced fun play style. I could pay for a solid set of 10 that could last me a week to a month with only 2-5 hours of exploration and still have some left over for dps ships.
---
Yes and no, if you have a prepositioned cap fleet set up then you will most likely win the fight. But we will see how it actually goes. Maybe something clever can work.
---
Come to thera. We are putting balance in the force.
---
Yes I do.
---
Snuff are on frts side
---
The recon will ALWAYS be primary. The longer that cyno is up, the more opponents can stream in.  Only idiots won't kill it as soon as it gets on grid.
---
I actually found this to be the easiest part, I used qt designer which is literally a drag and drop ui designer, and just exported it to a python file
---
Eve isnt a PvP game dude. This game wouldnt survive without PvE but it would survive without PvP. So stop using that argument.
---
Isn't the problem high sec incursions then? Everything is relative, and incursions stick out like a sore thumb in terms of the risk/reward ratio
---
Dear Maria, we shall no doubt see. In my humble opinion there will be more and in yours there will be less ! I watch with great interest as this chapter unfolds
---
Hi there, I don't like the way you build up your questions as you seem to imply they are related to one another, but i'll give it a go anyhow:
---
**what is it that you want?**
---
To enjoy EVE like everyone else, it's stagnant and boring, there's no reason to play, current implementation of mechanics are half-assed and bad, they strengthen large alliances and forces alot of players to have another alt on standby if x happens, it's meaningless.
---
I personally want more content drivers, reasons for nullblocks to engage each other into actual fights, not just arranged meets to shoot each other.
---
Right now every region can supply almost anything to the alliance inhabiting it, there's an endless supply of resources/isk available to pilots, if we took about half or even 2/3rd's of space away from eve there would still be plenty of resources available for everyone.
---
**Do you want the game the way it was in May?**
---
Is it that much better now? No, I don't want it the way it was in May and I don't want to see it in it's current state.
---
**Do you want super umbrellas to protect you indefinitely?**
---
Not indefinitely, I mainly lived under the goon super umbrella and done some stuff under the INIT umbrella, during peacetime having so many supers/titans/faxes consolidated seems like a broken mechanic, I'd rather have super umbrellas spread out so people actually have a chance of breaking a response fleet, at least not the way it's done now.
---
To give you an idea of what I think it should be, Goons have so many pilots that they should encompass at least 3-5 regions and have seperate umbrellas installed to maximise efficiency, not just cram everyone in Delve, giving other larger entities at least 1 reason to compete for space.
---
Ofcourse the N+1 should have effect, if your guerilla warfare game is off and you can't extract fast enough expect the neighbouring umbrellas to drop the hammer on you.
---
**Do you want local that gives you immediate and unequalled intel?**
---
I want a local where I can see pilots based on standings, if there are mutual positive standings one should show up in local so local interaction is still a thing.
---
If one is neutral/hostile they should not show up in local, although this is my personal point of view of how it should be, I embrace the blackout as is.
---
**What is your isk lost vs isk made percentage from PVE activities.**
---
Lost a rattle, a few vexors and a few fighters, probably lost about 1-6% of my innings with PVE activities.
---
**When  was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and  what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.**
---
Pretty much right before the blackout, I love pvp.
---
Depending on my mood, if a cynabal enters system (looking at "pogue was" here) and i'm in the mood to fight I'll be flying different ships to catch him, ranging from hecates to camping a pipe with an achorable bubble, instalocking ceptor and super/battlecruiser on grid for DPS/webs.
---
I'll try and come up with multiple strategies to take them down so they don't get used to what I do, like anchoring a bubble at the sun (most people warp to sun and cloak up, super fucking predicable) and tackle them there.
---
Otherwise I just continue my business, what the fuck is a single cynabal gonna do versus my fleet of rorqs/super.
---
**How many times have you roamed 0.0 only to find instawarping bots to pos/citadels.**
---
ALOT, alot in the southern, southeastern and eastern regions, if I was bored and could not find content I'd take a fleet out and hunt botting gilas/vexors in a sabre, usually I visited a region with bots beforehand, figure out their mechanics/warp-ins and have bookmarks made.
---
**And last how long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.**
---
I feel sad to say the game would last longer with a rollback before chaos than in it's current iteration, it's driving too many people away even though I like the mechanics myself.
---
Less people is a less active environment and less targets to shoot, and as a Goon I already have few targets to shoot at.
---
Since I started playing eve the NPE has been revamped what 3 or 4 times? Do we really expect it to be better?
---
.. but i cant even get to the screen where it gives me the option to uncheck that box
---
The "Launcher Settings" icon right under the Play Now button. helped me to solve the problem. massive thanks for your post! o7
---
EBR-182137 reported.
---
Does the Huge Coward mode give any indication it has been activated, allowing active cloaked ships watching the structure to tell it has been activated?
---
Don't think we need any bargaining at this point it's too early to offer trades to undo blackout or the cyno changes.
---
But this wasnt an income nerf. This was an entire playstyle nerf, an entire place in the game that got nerfed. Dont equate it to "ohh my faction warfare isk making got nerfed". Its really a shitty argument considering NS has seen tons of income nerfs in the past years, several just this year and people werent reeing. Wonder why?
---
That's true, but literally no MMO has ever kept me hooked besides Eve, so I suppose I don't think of them that way. I spent the purchase money and played it like any other game.
---
We’re just slightly more intense than those tame Blood Raiders.
---
Sounds like karma
---
Hey you're welcome, it's no bother. My character is like 8 months old and there's still a lot of stuff I just never learned anything about. I find that a lot of eve players are eager to help, and after all its easy to talk about something you find interesting. 
---
If you want to see some pretty creative use of the old cynos, check this out. It's a bit old but it's a classic. Really amazing stuff, and the narrator explains what exactly is going on so anyone can understand. I think this is how I learned how cynos work. The video is very well made too.
---
https://youtu.be/LNUu75fH8Uc
---
All regions owned by blocs? If blocs are gone... It wont be as fun as you think. Not to mention the economic effects. Dude, you realise how much your ships/mods will cost? You dont understand one key aspect about all of this, if you alienate the PvEers you have to do more PvE yourself. Because the game wont survive even a second without it.
---
Unless CCP starts to sell ships via NPC stations. Which might very well happen. But at that point its not a sandbox anymore.
---
It is by viewing local that I got to meet Vile Rat. I only met him once, but it was because of local.
---
/true story
---
Jaws rings a bell. 
---
In your experience would any of those screen readers allow OP's friend to play Eve?
---
An actual hate fight in 2019 EVE?
---
I have been arguing about changes for a long time so this isnt on me.
---
Hahahaha.....we can’t blob you with supers? We can and will still blob. This week is practice week while we adjust to the changes but all our supers are still here and hungry for your small gangs.
---
80% blued up.
---
I stopped reading right there. Of you are going to  flat out lie in your second sentence, it shows that nothing else you say should be taken seriously.
---
I don't think you get what I mean, I embrace change fully, but the current changes that are happening are changes I do not agree with.
---
There are so many opportunities for CCP to breathe life in this game, but it's like they just can't see it.
---
They want to nerf super umbrellas somehow but all i have to do is to install a force recon on grid and I can go about my business again, it's ADDING to the N+1 meta driving people away because they can't be arsed to have another account on standby when doing PVE.
---
They are not making EVE harder, they are making eve more INCONVENIENT in the wrong direction.
---
The changes i'd love to see is:
---
Resource depletion/exhaustion, force people to spread regions and not cram 30k pilots into 1 region, having 1 super umbrella consolidated covering an entire region is a broken mechanic.
---
Actual reasons for nullblocks to engage each other for strategic/tactical advantages, you don't want wars in the current spaceweather it is now.
---
&gt;That should change.
---
It really shouldn't.  Virtually all gamers are terrible game designers.  Just like virtually all people who live in houses are terrible architects.
---
And bring up your grievances to see at CCP. CSM candidates have no say as to what makes it in to the game.
---
Im with you. Tedium kills games and this game already had unhealthy levels of it before these changes.
---
Isnt provi more or less dead by now?
---
I would love to listen but can't deal with Matterall. Can we get an interviewer/host with a clue?
---
I don’t know sorry, I search for blind people on r/all from time to time and answer questions I can.
---
On my end, it's more curiosity to see if the real issue here is gameplay change as such (local / intel / risk) or just the income nerf. I personally don't mind Blackout, whether for PVP or PVE.
---
For chaos purposes I say it shouldn't. However you could tell by finding and flying to it. That's seems a fair trade off.

We won't be getting high-effort attempts (as in coding and changing game mechanics).  We can only hope for good low effort attempts.  Blackout was easy to implement.  I  can kind of see the whole LS being sort of like NS but with local, and its krabbing being worth something between HS and NS.  That probably was how it should have been. 
---
I am not sure if blackout vs a long delayed local makes sense.  It is above my pay grade.
---
I am not sure if Rorqs should be nerfed more, but I am pretty sure resource availability is far too dense in NS.
---
If you read near the end of the article Dunk confirms numbers are low.
---
I dunno. Preference?
---
Where are the goals of blackout posted would love to read them? If the crabs go extinct is that when we begin “bargaining” ?
---
They will try. Rorqs were being lost in droves before the change dude. I know cause I tried to help tackled Rorqs. 
---
It most certainly is. Try to move your ship solo and you will rack up costs faster than you imagine. 
---
Where am I coming from? You mean the numbers that are constantly falling and activity being abysmal and getting worse? Look at the numbers dude wtf.
---
You dont get it dude. People are actually worried. When was the last time you saw this many people being worried about the games longevity? You guys are just ignoring all of it.

Too soft, too long, too wussy.

Does he also confirm water is wet? Just want to double check, if we're covering things that are plainly obvious

Wrong. Aryth made no such promises to anyone. His campaign was "Fuck you, I'm going to Iceland".

Well the first problem is to actually identify a problem. Which to my understanding hasnt been done yet.

Really since when has snuffed dropped supers/titans on any imperium entity? They might have fun with a dread drop here and there but in every major was their titans will either stay out or join imperium forces.

I'm just paying attention to see when Pearl Abyss steps in and fires Hilmar for financially crippling the company

Hopefully it gets fixed. It was always a good “ oh fuck let’s not jump this hole blindly” noise.

thanks for the feedback guys much love lol my little one who is 1 and a bit when i eve she runs circles around me then sits on my lap when i pew pew its amazingly adorable but costs me at times but its worth it thanks for the fight and taking the time to reach out and comment and watch the videos.  
---
i hope all your eve adventures as always as fun as mine cheers &lt;3

Items move a lot, and it’s much cheaper to change a location field rather then insert into destination table while deleting from the source. It’s can also be good to have a single authoritative source for the state of the universe. But you do end up with a MASSIVE table with very few fields which works well on runtime but is slow to work with on other things, like when we want to change everything of type a to type b.
---
&gt;Cyno changes means that we can actually fly and have fun without the risk of being dropped by some bored/scared Null bear.
---
Uh...no.  It means the null blocs have to do a little more effort to drop on you.
---
So you are saying you wntt CCP to make a rule change so its ok to make real world threats against people as long as they are a content creator.
---
At this point almost everyone on the show is a caricature. I don't know how Matterall has dedicated SO MUCH EFFORT to Eve Online and remains so woefully clueless about it.
---
Wasnt aware I used the words titans and supers. But they are most definitely living and working out of frt space with frt right now.

Shit posting and trolling on Reddit.
---
if that's all you want then unsub and play as an alpha. oh but wait, that's probably a dishonest statement on your part, especially since eve isn't the only creative outlet in the universe to "keep telling interesting stories". you're held captive by a financial investment without a clear picture of what's at the end of the rainbow, probably, like everyone else, which, naturally, CCP and Pearly Abyss will happily keep capitalizing on
---
No, I don't believe you can.
---
I think we need more of a new r/eve plugin for player proposed features - TL;DR
---
Well, at least something is working properly
---
Back during the heyday of Counter-Strike, my best buddy and I looked for friendly-fire-enabled servers, bought pump shotguns, and teamkilled the fuck out of our allies. 
---
The salt was unbelievable.
---
Some servers had mods that let you select punishment for the TKers. One option on some mods was to set the TKer on fire. But that wasn't really a punishment for my buddy and I, because you could spread fire to teamates by bumping them!
---
Anyway. Of course my buddy and I were ruining games. We were players choosing to do stuff that we knew was ruining other folks' fun, even though FF was technically permitted by the rules.
---
Server owners/mods never let us go on when they were around, of course, because they knew letting players ruin a game was as much their problem as anyone else's. 
---
Moral of the story: yes, players are responsible for screwing up the game. But no less than CCP is. Theyre like CS server mods who could change FF rules or change which mods are on the server or permaban my buddy and I ... but who elect not to.
---
Darkness of despair allegedly blew up due to Crimea related drama.
---
This has has the stench of Tzeentch.
---
You're doing exactly what you are asking about
---
I brought your last post up to my corp when you posted before, but at that time as well as now, we're not able to find more k-space connections (and in particular, nullsec connections) than normal. Perhaps your particular system for some reason gets multiple different holes rolling into it. I'll keep looking to see if I can confirm any increase.
---
God bless you and good luck.
---
Experts: Bantams should not chase Garmurs. More at 11.
---
Neither, just interested )
---
&gt;because they're an invaluable part of any nullsec alliance
---
That's exactly the problem with eve today. 
---
Groups are no longer focused in anyway there is no niche everyone is exactly the same group just a different size, there is no identity goons are not different then nc outside of there number of folks.
---
Yea that sounds fair, esp considering chaos.
---
You cant know this. You are assuming people left because of this. There is no way you can say this. People get older, they get married, they get babies, they get new jobs, they die and so on. You cant just put everything down to one cause. People just lose interest dude, its nothing new.
---
And its BS, you keep saying we are soft and utter nonsense. Are you an idiot man? Honestly? Where the fuck do you get off on telling whos who? Do you know one single thing about the people you are saying these things about? The entire narrative of the other guys being so tough and hardcore is fking laughable. These bitches have been whining for years and you are trying to make them into Rambos. Fk off with that attitude.
---
Lack of asset safety already exists dude, industrial citas. Are you seeing a rush to kill them? And you are missing another key aspect here. You think blocs dont make shittons more isk just by staying at home? You are speaking from small gang perspective and you fail to see big gangs think differently. And thats why these changes dont work. You and alot like you simply dont understand certain things because you dont think that way.
---
Yet we still had 2 wars this summer, 1 ongoing. Thats strange cause it doesnt fit into your narrative. Understand this, blocs dont shut down their massive income at home to go and perhaps get some loot from asset safety. Its a moronic assumption. A small crew might do it but bigger entities dont give a shit about it.
---
But some people cant see the forest. So Im glad we are getting these changes. To once and for all debunk all the stupid myths floating around. I just hope the game survives you guys and CCPs ignorance. Im not sure it will though.
---
Right there in the second line, my friend. :-)
---
What's happening now is completely different. Eve has been in decline for awhile now. I think if ccp doesn't falter and continues on this path we'll have a better game at the end... though considering their history of abandoning things mid way that's probably not likely, but right now eve is still eve just with a few new inconveniences. SWG's death was because the game had NO resemblance to what it was before the NGE on top of it coming out right after an expansion was released
---
We get it. You're butthurt.
---
Whats the best way to find the wrecks? Since you can't probe them down?
---
What? I'm talking about why going against Legacy was a bad decision for gigX. Not even commenting on how he got himself banned.
---
It has progressively less bad over the years.
---
Jita is a toilet
---
Have you heard of the Primae?
---
With a retention rate as low as it is the margin of error in determining that is questionable
---
I agree shitposting in local is comparable to an explicitly nationalist alliance
---
non capsuleer basically   
---
&gt; **Baseliners** (sometimes baselines) is an improper noun used by [Capsuleers](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Capsuleer) to describe mundane human beings that do not benefit from Capsuleer training, augmentation and access to clones. It typically reflects an attitude of arrogance of Capsuleers and condescension towards the mundane human being. Depending on the context can be considered to carry derogative semantics or pity. 
---
[from](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Baseliners)
---
It's hard to focus away from ratting and mining when the mechanics say you cant defend space unless you rat and mine in it.
---
add a bar for alignment?
---
Nah, still surviving. :)
---
Delete this
---
&gt;r/Eve assumes Sov Null blocs are notoriously bad for thinking their the only space that matters to the bottom line.
---
FTFY.
---
Goons themselves warned CCP what they would do with Citadels and Rorqs via their CSM members.  CCP went through anyway, and CCP (and r/Eve) were baffled that Goons did exactly what they said they would do.
---
Yes, we know your 30k+ character alliance has a voting ballot that gets people on the CSM without putting in effort. Want a cookie?
---
Incursions and abyssals are certainly very rewarding for the risk level.
---
I agree with you completely. The levels of risk aversion which I have encountered over the last decade are truly staggering.
---
I'd suggest firstly making capital PvE basically not a thing, then rebalancing rewards. Ratting and mining in subcaps already has a significantly higher associated risk than in caps.
---
Not really. But the issue here is that CCP handled it based on their current praxis. And you are missing one key aspect, gigx had been banned several times before from what I understand. Always due to the same irl shit. But it was always short term bans but he just did it once too many times.
---
However, I do feel it was real shitty. We need players like him. The whole co2 thing was bad, we needed another strong coalition in the game.
---
There are enough cowards in space already.
---
=)
---
A few haw dreads on a 200 man cerb fleet should cost a recon?  It will.
---
I am hopeful that the minutes show my efforts in this regard.
---
So, what mechanic do you want for better counter play? What constitutes better counter play?
---
You're being fed dumb propaganda. Of course rorqs have been dying because of fucking up. What you're conveniently ignoring is that IT DIDNT MATTER IF THEY DIED in terms of the effect on the economy. Null blocs blew up anyway.  It doesn't matter if you fuck up moving a cap since you can grind out the ISK to get it back in less than 10 hours easily. 
---
CCP doesn't care about the pain and anguish you feel losing a cap they care about the effect of massive blobs that are capable of infinitely replenishing themselves turning the sandbox into solid fucking concrete. 
---
That's why it doesn't matter if we're loosing PCU for a while after a salt inducing change like that. CCP knows they'll lose some subs over it in the short run but they're betting the game will last longer because of it. They are ABLE to bet on it because they're owned by PA who are able to think longer term than your average group of investor randos.
---
to be honest wormhole activation sound as  sms ringtone would be great.. you come to friend thats wormholer and you get sms,he thinks some1 jumps in and brings fleet :D
---
He was the ONLY FC
---
But I don't pay to play EVE?
---
I have the stories I want to tell and I'm working on them. And EVE is one of the few outlets that can help me tell these stories with meaning.
---
I'd tried other space games, and they just really aren't the same.
---
I even have had many years breaks, and nothing else quite scratches that itch.
---
The Chinese seem to be the major content providers in Null Sec at the moment and I really like these propaganda shit posts - makes a nice change from Eve is dying posts.
---
Pi is brain cancer that pays...  slowly.
---
or the NGE in SWG
---
People are fighting each other. You somehow missed the 2 wars this summer, 1 ongoing which all blocs are involved in.
---
I mean, I am a bit hungry. What kind of cookie?
---
"vote with your wallet"
---
"OK we won't play"
---
"no not like that"
---
Isn't not subscirbing because we don't support the changes the correct way to show ccp we don't support them and not a tantrum?
---
&gt;His opponents also blame him to be a “trade man” who regard EVE as a business rather than a game, and would exploit his fellows for his own profit.
---
I mean, yeah, you don't become the ruler of Serenity without blobbing and blueing every fucking thing that moves around you until the game is in a decaying freefall. Why would anyone be surprised at this?
---
&gt;As WC finally won a place to make its’ stand, the propaganda tool transformed into racialism and nationalism. Though Noraus claimed that WC is friendly to all Chinese players (which is actually not), some of its’ members started to insult their compatriots from international alliances as “traitors” “pets of the aliens” “not being true Chinese” in various communities, and such spamming was somehow connived by the leadership of WC.
---
Got anything to back this up with?
---
How deadly are gate guns exactly? Sometimes when I'm running around lowsec I want to engage people on gates but I feel like I'd just get blapped by the turrets.
---
or have special cap sites that are quite a bit harder but not necessarily a whole lot higher payout. Somewhat like wormhole capital escalations but with the escalation worth less so as not to be deliberately farmed.
---
So you can improve your individual isk/hr potentially, but without the site actually being so much easier, or so abusable.
---
But then again, I think in protected parts of nullsec, even lazy pilots in sub caps will earn isk at a quick clip compared to their losses.
---
Oh shit, I'm def going to do that now so that way i don't have to reconfigure 20+ clients whenever the launcher kills itself
---
Chocolate chip
---
No stop the facts hurt him to much.
---
No. Your ship is a flaming ball of lava. Clearly from a fight that almost ended in your destruction. Getting out alive is worthy of applause.
---
Also I don't mind downvotes, I welcome them. Gives me a good sense of the demographics around here.
---
Lower the amount of people that can live in a system. It spreads people out and historically irl this is really the only relevant thing that causes enough friction to get people to leave blocs. I dont think there are many other ways without killing off the playerbase like we are seeing now. 
---
People just prefer blobs, thats how any community of people works.
---
so what were your thoughts when you realized the goon CSMs were very vocally against the majority of nullsec-buffing changes that everyone likes to ironically claim we were responsible for? that we STRONGLY advocated against things such as the rorqual changes and unrestricted use of the new structures because we knew exactly what the outcome would be yet CCP pushed that stuff through anyway?
---
That's odd, because they are not friends with anyone in The Imperium except The Initiative, and are working directly with Fraternity. forces in current war.
---
Yummy!
---
Hey man just wait till you wake up for school and notice all your homework is done in red ink. But is it really ink...
---
please order the lazagne
---
I have jumped my  various capitals probably a few hundred times into fights.  The average PVE experience of getting jumped was Far Far hairier than the average Capital battle.  Never lost a capital on a fleet op.  Had a dread get targeted and neuted once.
---
Awesome response! People will always optimize, always.
---
for starters, highsec industrialists supplied nullsec fine for years on end. 0.0 indy isnt as important as you think. Second if people do less pve then pve gets more value to do it, i dont really have financial issues for quite a large amount of time, but again, if isk gets more value, the same tick will give you "more"
---
Ikr, too bad i never said im gonna give it to you. All mine! &gt;:D
---
I watch my skill queues progressing on mobile.
---
He was absolutely not the only FC lmfao I was in CO2 for 2 years during the trib war and then in the south. He was definitely not the only FC - if you think that, either you were never in CO2 and have no idea what you're talking about, or you were a ping warrior in CO2 and have no idea what you're talking about. Either way you're a fucking moron
---
And that's besides the point. His FCing didn't generate content. His politics did. He started wars because they were fun/he held a grudge and that made for great gameplay.
---
god shututp, you can literally make a significant more amount of isk in highsec on alpha accounts than you can in nullsec currently - get your shit facts straight before reeeee'ing on the bandwagon nerd
---
Oh make no mistake. Goons were smart to do what they did. Any competent entity would have been crazy not to take advantage of a chance to hyper industrialize their war machine. That fuck up was solely on CCP.
---
A Proteus that doesn't stand a fkin chance against my Girls.
---
One rorqual isn't bad for the game.
---
The problem is that mining is so easily afk'able that you can scale a rorqual up to as many as your wallet can support (eve subscriptions) I think the most rorquals by one person I've seen was 18. I'm sure there is more tho.
---
The inconsistency is what upsets me. It just seems like CCP is playing favorites.
---
I am pretty sure they did announce in a lore event not long after the drifter lore events stopped that there would be increased wormhole activity. Be sort of the same timeframe.
---
Agree our pocket is the same, lots of wormholes since then.
---
That would be a question for /u/countscary
---
You want me to goodpost for 30 days? Nice try but no thanks
---
I don't think I've ever heard of a pure USA nationalistic alliance. Do you know of any?
---
What does having the Congressional Gold Medal do, other then give them a medal? Are there benefits to family or something?
---
I am actually kind of glad that the blackout killed my playstyle; its why I am back. I honestly thought I was done with eve until the blackout drew be back in.
---
Has it gotten harder to make isk? Definitely. Its more risk, it takes more organization, but I like that. I don't actually like that the game fed into my overly work-a-day life of safe anom running in a blingy ship and nary a care in the world. 
---
There was no need for a standing fleet when local was empty and near perfect. It was hard to blame people for joining corps just to awox because there was hardly anything else to even be worried about.
---
Now that is shifted and the gaurd needs to be up.
---
"**What is planned to happen in EVE?** – new game design, ..."  
---
"**What is the strategy going forward?** –... long term direction"  
---
"CSM member can't give hints about the next meta to their coalitions"....yeah, right.
---
Hey dude!!!
---
Definitely looking forward to the next EVE North. Soup Dumplings are always a must. We'll do it again next year!
---
I mean that's part of the problem, it comes along with non-sov space basically being not worth living in on an alliance level as there is almost not way to run things like a SRP program that scales from LS nor is there really from wormhole space ( most SRP programs have some honor based tax system outside of sov and these systems have a habit of poor scaling ).
---
Youre kinda missing one key point matey. Very few were against any changes, the majority wanted changes but not stupid ones. You are yourself saying you dont agree 100% which means youre not totally lost.
---
And this is all based on iteration. Tell me, how many iterations have we had on the blackout in these past 2 months? In this age of chaos where changes are supposed to happen every week. Oh right, fking 0. So CCP hasnt really changed have they? They still making shitty changes without iteration? If only this was what people had an issue with.
---
Oh wait, it was. 
---
And ofc you are enjoying it. It was all meant to be fun for the vocal minority. Jeez what a surprise that you are happy over being massively OP. But if you think the game is better off then you are in fact totally lost.
---
you're severely misguided, my son
---
Fact
---
If you dont get it, maybe youre just ignorant and shouldnt talk about it?:):)
---
what? you must have misread, i said you can make more isk in high sec than null. That's why i'm advocating bringing back rorq mining and super ratting and balancing this off with some new isk sinks
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣 OK salty..
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
yes i agree, but rather than lose all the rorq pilots, why not balance off their activities with greater isk sinks?
---
Ah yes forgot about the "representatives" from goons, who are elected by sending out a voting list to the mouth dribblers.
---
I love how you so quickly get on your heels and defensive. "The small alliances will pack light. You will get zero fights. You will complain the game is dead no content. You won't get any loot. Small alliances will just move elsewhere"
---
Lol ok overlord of all small alliances in the game. It sounds like you are coordinating the actions of them all lol. 
---
BTW the best places to find a skirmish, are in blob space. If you don't get greedy, you don't get blobbed. You get stupid and greedy, you get blobbed to shit until you don't want to come back. That's the entire point of it.
---
For instance go visit LXQ in etherium reach. Right into the blob. If you go there not in a elite pvp micro gang and don't get an awesome fight you are trash at this game.
---
I was the anchor for our small loki fleet...Called out every fucking NC sabre I saw, "REP THAT SABRE, AND REP HIM.   LOCK HIM !  QUICK GET THIS SABRE SAFE! "
---
See everyone? This is how nullsec wars are born!
---
Sounds like CSM offers little real value...
---
You want an isk sink? Make all cynos only lightable on alliance tourny reward ships.
---
Game fixed.
---
Yes, Reeeeeeeing is your job. Hop to it soldier.
---
And yeah it is overwhelming. But with time you can understand enough. It's not realistic to expect someone to master multiple aspects of the game simply by reading eve wiki or watching videos. If and when you get into a corp (if you haven't already), try and find one that at least won't mind teaching you, not one that will give you shit for being new. I wish I'd known this was important!
---
J-Space systems have locations in the SDE. As far as I know, it's the same relatively simple math as determining jump range from a K-space system.
---
Most devs could have a script to parse the SDE, extract the necessary data, and do the calculations in an hour tops.
---
I am.
---
I'd pay a lot isk for a highsec capital and shit on triglavians
---
You're confusing a normal reaction to encountering an idiot with being salty.  Stop defending being ignorant by calling people salty.
---
Truth hurts
---
Oh boy, story time! Tell me the spin Mittens put on it so he doesn't have to work out of a position of egotism, but instead make himself out to be the saviour of EVE!
---
Apart from the fact that wouldn't be an isk sink. Ship destruction is an isk faucet (insurance).
---
Yeah I meant more that there's plenty of USA! USA! lolEuros in EVE's posting history.
---
Sigh... am i the only one on the planet that says “oh they deployed literally thousands of supers and it’s totally unwinnable we have 2 options.  Suicide bomb kill as many as we can...
---
Or go reinforce every keepstar in their staging
---
Sure. Or protect it once you drop. Who says it will die?
---
You clearly can't read. They see saying give us time to see how these changes work so we can figure out how to save you.
---
All of the things you are saying has happened and its getting worse. Eve is just massively complex and things arent obvious right away.
---
Check the markets, check activity levels and so on. Things are not the way you think they are and the economy is by no means healthy.
---
The morning after the patch I had 6x random holes... figured it was just CCP wanting to make sure we saw their new graphics
---
Thank you Dunk
---
There's already nothing left to burn except for deathstar keepstars
---
Good luck get yourself a one-man empire
---
I'd like that very much.
---
You are not wrong that you could make it more efficient. What I am suggesting is that in the back end things don't seem to work that well... If there was a simple join solution, I would like to think we wouldn't have half the problems we have...
---
Assume you're on a highway that has four lanes and then narrows down to one.    Traffic backups develop because people get bottlenecked trying to get down the road.      Is this the drivers' fault for trying to use the road at the same time as everyone else, or is it the fault of the people who built the highway?
---
The single lane section is an analogy to the single-threaded server code.   This is where TiDi originates.   
---
We're just using the game they gave us.
---
Okay, this was a stupid analogy.   Let the downvotes begin.   But please, continue to blame other people for CCP's unwillingness to fix their shit for 16 FRIGGIN YEARS.
---
I always went egg thief with a buzzard and friends in frigs if they were online, mind sharing that fit?
---
You know Crafty, if you really in Tuskers then good on you. You guys have a good rep and I respect that. 
---
My comment comes from a place of saltiness, yes, I’m hella salty. Because the vast majority of dudes that get on here and suck the dick of blackout, really have no fucking clue about what the speak. They just spout off half truths and copy/pasted buzzwords and its lame. 
---
Yes, null should be dangerous. But it should also be a place for empire building. Hence the various sov systems and the general design and advertisement over the years. But “they” screech about safe null and other random bullshit. If they had their way the whole game would be a pubg battleground. 
---
“They” screech about about capital proliferation, but the only thing they’ve ever done is hop In their nano sub caps and fly in circles looking for random ganks. They’ve never built anything or aspired to greater horizons. 
---
“They” yell about how they want the game to be “hard, like it was back in the day”. Well guess what? Back then,’when it was hard...there was local... And when they open their mouths, it’s actually pretty easy to tell who was actually around back then and who is just talking out their ass.  
---
Because, “they” whine about krabs...there used to be a time, you know, back in the day, when it was “hard”, that there was no difference between krabs and pvpers. Cause they were the same people. You had to “krab” to afford your ships and everything else. 
---
I’m salty because today we have a generation of players who can’t see beyond their own noses and can’t see that there are a thousand other valid play styles that get trampled under foot when they start stomping around.
---
True dat! Amen
---
&gt; That simply doesn’t happen. There are no manifestos pinned to the front door of CCP. 
---
Hey it worked for Luther
---
That's ok... 90% of EVE is convinced that /u/countscary and I are the same person with way too many alts. I've even heard that all of C0NE are our alts. We're really impressive multiboxers.
---
Gating Vanquisher?
---
Oh wow how gracious of him!
---
chart clearly shows eve dies on a daily basis
---
It's amazing isn't it. If I have idk laying around it's not being used to have fun so I spend it haha. Caps are too big and boring for me.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣 OK autistic dude.
---
Long story short: No one cares
---
Except with ccp, waiting to see how the changes payout is tantamount to them becoming permanent. All the things that lead us to the problem they are trying to fix were shouted about and what was labeled as doomsaying came true. How many times should we  calmly sound the alarm and being told wait and see before we have to go all out. These changes and the direction ccp is taking appears to many to be the final blow to eve and as people who enjoy this game we don't want it to see it die.
---
I don't know about OP in this case... when you're tackled for 60+ minutes, you deserve to die.
---
We want CCP to stop doing what ever it is that is making people leave. Chaos is working if it is to kill off eve cause the bonuses are now gone.   
---
PA is going to get a shell of what they paid for.
---
&gt;Consider your current playstyle, and do the opposite for 30 days.
---
lmao this will make people hate the game even more.

It's even worse than having little real value. They are detrimental to the game
---
I like the first part " ***Never*** **Write Off Your Existing Customer**". Like go on an interview and say that they expect people to leave and thats ok. CCP really shat the bed on this one. If they had made the changes somewhat balanced some would have left but they went ballsdeep and they somehow thought peoples goodwill was gonna keep them in the game, another thing hubris has killed. And you need people to tell other people to play the game. Now theres pretty much only negative buzz surrounding the game. Consider the fact that this game is notoriously hard to get into and now you have tons of players saying its not worth it? But the retention rates are gonna go up? Lul.
---
CCP, you fked up homey.
---
It's not a status bar, it's a measure of speed (not velocity), so is a scalar not a vector.
---
What you may want to ask for is a velocity indicator to pop up after initiating warp which measures velocity in the direction of the warp target location, and ideally the 100% portion of the bar should be 75% of current maximum speed.
---
Have the NPC's make the timers since I'm to lazy to make them happen and too risk averse to be shot at REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Cyno change means the bored super pilots have to bring an arazu and can tackle you when they blob you
---
hint: casb is op as fuck
---
“Fight”
---
The most obvious option would be something which can detect cloaked ships (it could be a change to the currently totally unused combat interceptors, or a structure, or a module).
---
You could require a cloaked ship to be in the vicinity of the detecting ship for that, or the structure could alert 5 minutes after they cloak in the system if they haven't left, and every 5 minutes thereafter.
---
This would roughly restore Local against cloaky campers but retain blackout for anything else.
---
Beyond that, counterplay to the covert cyno is another option.
---
&gt; This post is not be crying ...
---
lol, yea sure.
---
GW2 is that game where of you play it full time you will run out of things to do. It's a great game to come back after a few months though and binge all the new content
---
I can confirm that Dunk asked for T2 Salvage drones.
---
And I can claim that he did so, only after I did. 
---
One of those statements is true.
---
It's also easier to walk away from the game for good.
---
I said GOOD DAY
---
We've had a wide chain the last few days but I just put that down to coincidence. I'm still not convinced there's any real change (except to drifter wormholes which do have a ridiculous number of connections at the moment).
---
While I applaud any attempt to foster empathy among EVE players during this dark time, having a NS player ask other NS players do other NS activities to understand other points of view ignores that larger pool of players in LS and HS and the issues they face. Course, this being Reddit, I expect a F off to both this post and the idea that anyone outside NS has any value.
---
You do know super ratting is the least afk thing you can do in the game right? Rofl something tells me you have never been in a cap
---
I've been playing No Man's Sky and Horizon Zero Dawn a lot.
---
I do have access to the game tho...
---
idk, it's not easy to defend subcaps. Even a battleship is likely to be under 180k EHP so assuming your fleet can do 3k DPS (6 bombers) it's dead in a minute or so. If they're more than 2 jumps from a response fleet theres no way to protect them, and that's assuming the response fleet is pre-formed and undocked.
---
Look at the number of players online, you're being obtuse. We want Eve to be a game for more people than are playing currently. If you literally removed all the pve accounts there wouldn't be much sand left in the sandpit.
---
This is the Falcon quote I'm referring to:
---
_It's a super polarizing change for sure, and I do believe there needs to be an intelligence system in place, just not one that's as black and white as literally listing everyone in the system in a chat channel_
---
_As with everything in EVE, you should have to work a little for your intel. Not being able to do so right now isn't optimal - I agree with that. Needs to be a middle ground_
---
Explain the 12k online players
---
Joke's on you I can do that from my phone now.
---
I am in the BBC, we are FAR from being on GOON side lol. Especially being in ISRAD
---
pyfa
---
Just a lot of people killing bombers and making money.
---
Because randomly evaluating the social conditions in a corp post joining is so effective for women trying to not be sperged on by everyone once they realize you're a woman?  Pointless to draw attention to the fact that women struggle in online games with toxic cultures and we've worked to resolve that in our group?  Disagree, I prefer direct discussion upfront rather than pretending it's not something on a woman's mind when evaluating groups from the outside.  It's ludicrous to believe it's not something a woman cares about in whom they play with.
---
Women are explicitly invited to join, and we will ensure they're treated fairly, equally, and will absolutely come down hard on anyone who isn't classy at all times.  We have a bunch of women pilots in Brave, but even in Brave I know a lot of the women are reluctant to join comms because of their prior experiences in Eve and other games.  I actually originally made the poster after chatting with some of our women pilots about why they're not more active in comms.
---
&gt; Sa Matra/Poitot
---
Dharen and I were just talking about him the other day. His halcyon days were before my return to EVE but from what I can tell from what TEST people and Goons say, he made one hell of a mark for just one dude.
---
I ancil rep my impel
---
It's almost like people have stopped playing the game
---
Cringy. The irony is palpable, when one starts with a very nationalistic, even racist remarc, then acuses his opponent of doing just that... like... what?.. I guess Chinese propaganda is very Chinese.
---
Girls.
---
Nah he was absolutely right to. What happened to co2 was a human interaction  NOT a video game.  I would have done the same.  This hiding behind a video game forscrewing someone over is utter BS.  
---
Also have you never said anything in rage not really meaning it.  Its like saying I'm going to kill you for that but actually not really meaning it.  It was a massive excuse for CCP to use him as an example. Pretty disgraceful tbh.   Others have got away with a whole lot worse.
---
In so much as they appear to offer a false sense of representation and progress.   
---
I'm glad we voted to choose people to build 'rapport' with the devs.   I mean, catch a flight to a World Tour event if you want to build rapport.  We need people to get in the weeds with devs, discuss issues that these guys hear about in their discords, and discuss mechanics and other things which actually do have profound impact on the game.   I mean, if we think that a group of players drinking beers with CCP is going to change the vision for EVE that PA has assigned them, we're all fools.   CSM is not going to have any impact having 50,000ft level discussions, as the answers to those questions involve people way above CSM's paygrade.
---
&gt; I've always thought having hictors only do it would be a good compromise.
---
That's actually not a bad compromise.
---
Truthfully, I suspect that Classic WOW will lose appeal after more people hit end game. While I never played WOW (excluding the free demo), I heard original wow raids where a nightmare to organize. Unless something has drastically changed in classic, I don't sew people nostalgia lasting once they get to raids.
---
&gt; T2 inventable Dictor bubble that catches nullified ships but not non nullified ones. Make it a choice.
---
This is an interesting one, too.
---
No doubt. But lets look at like this. 1 bot in NS made 50m/h, now they move to HS and they make 25m/h so they now need 2 (just using random numbers). They are now increasing the PCU by more than before. Some bots get banned sure but they get restarted within a day mostly right?
---
We dont have the entire picture, by no means. But Im fairly certain the drop in real accounts is actually far far worse than the PCU says.
---
it's called hyperbole buddy

Still works, I fly around a 1337 dps. Gilas melt like they in a 1v1 frigate fight.
---
Well its more people like you that are the problem.
---
Instead of screetching here on reddit, dismantle those big groups solo in game
---
I don't really want to do big capital stuff, but small gang capital stuff.
---
Really? I think much more despise nullsecers more than anything from what I've seen here. I really haven't seen much hate towards wormholes
---
So then why keep screaming doomsday when they start making changes back in the other direction from the prior doomsday?
---
Why are people still using this shitty argument. People are at war for fucks sakes. And all the blocs are currently engaged in said war.
---
Still useful in wormholes. There's a particularly annoying blinged solo hunter active rep fit with a ton of cap that's kinda popular atm.
---
Things are setteling pretty well right now, soon we will be under 10k players at peak times, most of them bots and alpha accounts. I hope you enjoy jumping 50 empty systems looking for content only to crawl back to high sec when you realize no one plays the game anymore
---
There is no point currently other than strategic objectives. But if you think blocs are gonna go to war for some potential loot... They make more by staying at home dude. You are underestimating the costs of going to war and somehow think it will be justified by potential loot.
---
Works for small gang sure, but not blocs.
---
But also not totally.
---
Delta-v calculations are already able to be done fairly easily.
---
And things like Kerbal Space program can do it (albeit with a very different physicals engine).
---
But I'd imagine it can be done in EVE too even under the current physics, as it does use a mass/force calculation (apparently) for handling acceleration as is.
---
And once that's done, front load it.
---
Yeah, at this point at least.
---
Plenty of people huh. Where?
---
So get your ass out there and grind it?????
---
Just be mindful that once you setup all your structures take your shoes off and get comfortable, someone bigger is gonna come knocking on your door and kicking down your sand castle. 
---
We are patiently waiting for this very thing to happen, and hope asset safety to go the way of the dodo
---
Right after we remove cloaks
---
Lol. Do you even realise the amount of money botting brings in? I would say atleast 1 million dollars yearly in this game alone. Easy.
---
Sure, bots are gone dude.
---
I was a dedicated player and already kinda going to stop the game but the blackout really helped me. 
---
I dont oppose the idea behind the concept of 'chaos' but CCP is being really stupid about it. 
---
After playing the game for so long I am now pretty sure that they in many respects suck at game design, they dont really 'get' a lot of the things and  they continue to fuck up, hard. 
---
I dont expect things to improve. So bye.
---
It was a sarcasm
---
It may sound dumb, but it did take me years - and I mean almost a decade! - to realise that 9/11 is not November. Or a 911 reference...
---
I resonate with this statement.
---
Boy it sure is cold today. That must mean global warming isn't real!
---
It's still my favorite "so this one time I was playing eve online..." personal story.
---
Officially USA did switch into Metric in 1975. But not everyone got the memo.
---
So the Chimera is indeed pretty sweet looking, but it most common use-case is for boosts or FC's that don't like getting headshotted.  Instead of the fighter bonuses of its Minmatar cousin, it gets a bonus to local tank.
---
In the general sense, if your carrier gets shot you've probably made a tactical error somewhere so local tank isn't as important as effective fighters.   Because of its role as a booster most chimera fits are going to have links up high, shields in the mids, and a damage control + PDS or DDA's in the lows.
---
Some people will forgo that powerful tank and instead use drone navs or tracking mods in the mids.
---
The best part of the login counter is when you go to different timeperiods. 6m 27k average, 3m 22k, 1m 18k, 2w 17k, 1w 16k, 36h 15k.
---
I think its going down.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if there's anyone that isn't despised by most of the people in this sub.
---
Well, tbf, we are all dirty nasty eve players.
---
How many new players known about training implants really ( let alone use them ), like training implants was not something i did when i was new to eve and most folks really don't ( hell i still forget to get into my training clone half the time today ).
---
Or return Rorq to booster role and let them run alts in Hulks?
---
After thinking for a couple minutes, I guess my point is:
---
There is a place for all styles of gameplay. There’s a place for solo PvP, for small, nano gangs, industry, pve, farming, role playing, dicking off. Theres a place for blob warfare and caps. But it’s all not gonna be fair and balanced. 
---
Yeah, your small gang of friends can’t come in to Delve and consistently kill Rorqs. You’re gonna get a cap blob dropped on your face. It’s unreasonable and ignorant to assume and expect that David is gonna kill Goliath every time. That’s why it’s a biblical story, because it was fucking amazing that it was accomplished. Imagine if Al-Qaeda whined like eve players, we’d all stop killing them for a minute to laugh in their faces! “But Osama! The US has too much money. Their guns are bigger and better! Osama, they’re more organized that ya! Nerf them! We’re fighting is caves with hand me down AKs they shouldn’t be able to use their tanks!”
---
It’s an extreme example, but it’s the same thing. These people whine about HtFu and adapt or die, but they’ve literary been doing the exact opposite for the last several years. 
---
Goons got nuked into the ground, evicted, moved regions, and all the people that facilitated that, what did they do? They didn’t build something for themselves, they just said “well, that’s done” and got back in their cruisers and went back to flying in circles. 
---
And now, Goons have built back up, stronger than before, but now there’s no gambling money to instigate another conflict. So whining is the only recourse they have I guess.
---
Yeah I just wish I could play games nowadays without going out there and doing like 20 hours of research cause I want to know everything I need to do right and stuff to avoid doing...which I could learn from just playing the game but that min-max just keeps getting me everything.
---
What I do usually is run it as administrator so all what it have to install go true whit no problem. Not related to your problem. But might be could help since it's testing to install something.
---
I have to delete the CCP folder in the registry every few days. It works
---
The problem is that in the nullsec scenario you don't need to start a war because you got plenty of cookies yourself... i think we're onto something here!
---
huh
---
Actually the point of the game is having fun, and imo socializing with your fellow players. If you wanna do that while shooting red triangles instead of orange triangles it doesn’t really matter.
---
Nobody is feeding me shit dude. I fking see things with my own eyes. And dude, you clearly have no idea what youre talking about.
---
For a while. Its a major assumption that shit will turn around. In the game with the most complexity. With abysmal retention rates. Now tell me again how any change has changed that?
---
Sorry, hard to tell these days on this subreddit, the complaints seem to never end.
---
Props to them! You actually gave me a reason to log in now:)
---
the funny thing is the ISO Standard here in Europland is YYYY-MM-DD , but barely anyone knows that it is the standard. Even software shows DD-MM-YYYY, even Microsoft Windows.
---
no u :D
---
for starters, I didn't say "plenty of people" I said "plenty to do".
---
But there are still plenty of people out in FW space, where I call home.
---
At least one person got my allusion...  :)
---
Dude come on. That was another age. And you are massively underestimating what 0.0 plays for a part. You keep forgetting that passive moonmining is no longer a thing. If blocs go away then you can kiss T2 market right away.
---
Thats an assumption that works on small scale, not large scale. The invisible hand isnt as invisible as you might think.
---
With the current numbers and FW? 5 people isnt plenty rofl
---
This is a lot because of the immature player base. You'd probably say the cyno changes are part of that, but that has only been a few days, so clearly people were prejudging the idea.
---
But once again, what was happening before wasn't exactly causing higher numbers.
---
TL:DR Under NDA, CSM could be done over discord but you can't trust anyone till you have a beer with them.  CCP has a plan but Hilmar has issues grasping basic concepts, coding a 15 plus year old game is hard.
---
Because they didn't? Injectors, citadels, current sov system, super caps applying to sub caps. These are the the issue, local and cynos are not.
---
what did I just read? Is this a fight about who is more Chinese? I am more worried about the minmatar trash flying around in space. Damn those Gallente as well. Caldari master race!
---
Is 40?
---
Only a few systems are empty, and even they have regulars passing through, doing things, then leaving.
---
Does every system need to have 1000 people in it for the game to be healthy to you?
---
They are, thats true. But like what happened to Mittens was due to them not having the same praxis back then. And I mean gigx got the same shot term bans. They even afforded him more chances. He just kept doing it.
---
It will be very easy to get on the 1dq market. Seen em at 8bil as recent as yesterday. Goons produced so many that with the decrease in demand and reduced isk generation you will likely see further price drops absent large events that kill a bunch.
---
I actually mentioned LS and WH too, I think most of us already interact with HS to some degree.
---
Years of reading and watching the csm and the game.
---
And no that is not a different point, the CSM should change.
---
I used to fight you guys all the time in the Hagilur pocket (we were the Space P0lice back then). I was in the same spot as you, been there done everything. Small gang, solo, industry, PI, Null Alliance, FC, wormhole, shit I even flew in the alliance tourney... I came back now with the blackout changes and I do not regret it. Lowsec with a drastically reduced chance of seeing supers hot dropping in has once again become a fun place to live. I don't play much as I used to, what with my family growing these days and all, but I re-subbed one account and am loving it.
---
I disagree with this entirely.
---
If they had enough buffer, maybe a fax could save the recon.  Maybe, but they don't.   You light on that kind of enemy fleet that recon dies, period.
---
Local going away in nullsec has been called for over 8 years now.
---
Cynos being so ubiquitous are also a problem.
---
It's almost like multiple things can be problems.
---
Yes, some of those other things need to change to, but these changes also help.
---
LOL, the other 10% think there is only one form of "true" PvP and you can only enjoy PvP if you are constantly and ego-insulating-ly 99.98% successful at that one form.
---
Darkness? Thought they died.
---
Yeah we were there a little earlier then our own fleet 😂 I was the only hyperspatial fit there so I was a solid three mins before our fleet landed on grid.
---
How is he clueless?
---
In your windows system environment variables do this:
---
Enter 'QT_OPENGL' in the name field, and 'desktop' in the value field (without the quotes).
---
This might fix your issue.
---
Best fking comment ever!
---
casb?

Bounty hunting as relates to the bounty system has never worked or existed as a meaningful profession. There's just no automated way for it to work as bounty payouts cannot be more than damage done in collecting it. Mercenary groups have existed with various degrees of usefulness and success because they are typically taking on tasks which have larger more important goals that justified worthwhile payments. Even then historically they have worked more to offset their costs than to actually make money.
---
Bounty hunting style gameplay is possible in Eve. The problem is that it doesn't work like people would expect. The amount of effort it takes to target and catch individual players is so high and the relative ship value so low means that only a tiny number of players are worth hunting.
---
That said, it does happen. There are a small number of people who do operate as bounty hunters. People who fly expensive blinged out ships occasionally find themselves hunted. Alliance tournament ships are a good example of this, once someone starts flying them and lands on zkillboard, that is a mark on their head.
---
The problem with bounty hunting in Eve is that you can't play at being Boba Fett. You have to actually be Boba Fett. You have to take the time, figure out when they play, where, what they'll attack, what they'll run from. Plan a trap, potentially wait for hours or days. When the fight does start you need to be able to win against someone who is likely one of the better pvpers in the game and almost always being cautious with their expensive ship. Nobody is going to expend this effort on any common ship, few have the time or skill to go after the small number of targets actually worth it.
---
There are people in the game who do this though, and it's cool as fuck to know that this is a thing and these kills happen.
---
Those were good days!
---
I also forgot to mention 3 sets of at (top8 as best with triumvirate team) and 2 sets of new eden open.
---
I keep an open mind of return. I follow the news just tad more.
---
FF XIV~
---
   
---
do not by any chance go researching economic data, will discover so many corrupt and dishonest jobs that you will be disgusted with the whole Eve ...
---
Im actually more surprised that Gobbins had to discourage dread ratting.
---
And you are mental to think things wont change and it has anything to do with hurting CCP or that super ratters exist in such massive abundance.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/78617934/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78617934/)  
---
We did already. It ended poorly for him
---
Thats your opinion though that local and cynos are a problem. Even the things I listed are opinions but you will far fewer people opposing those.
---
Local has been asked to be removed by people who don't live in nullsec. Same with the cyno changes. These were both buffs to people who roam into null from either wormholes or lowsec. Why should their opinion be valued over someone who lives there.
---
Additionally we can clearly see these changes are taking the game off a cliff, and at ccps break neck pace of iterating after 2 years this could very well be the end of it so yes we need to sound the alarm.
---
&gt;I'm glad we voted to choose people to build 'rapport' with the devs
---
Except it's more than building rapport. They get proprietary information and all sort of info before the rest of the player base. 
---
On some occasions they used the presence of devs to gain ingam9aryth turning the judge) advantages which would have probably been imposible otherwise.
---
And they do influence the game. Think about whne aryth tried to remove the mer, ccp was fine with it and backtracked because of the rest of the player base pointing out how that would only benefit goons and similar large groups.
---
And the fact that they act like a focus group without being one( choosing aryth again because it's a clear cut exemple but not the only one) like who in the csm has the experience in large scale trading aryth does? who in the csm coordinates a trading group similar to goons trading group?
---

thanks Scrivver - we live in a c2 and i'm certainly noticing an increase in lower class wormholes. But C5's also!
---
CCP has found a new way to stop people from logging in:)
---

---
Incursions at least require people to play together. I haven’t done them in a while, but that’s the thing that drew me back into Eve after my initial group of friends quit.
---
Thank you haven't heard one called that before!
---
Suddenly TOOL
---
&gt; They have way more breadth
---
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I have a hard time saying that games with basically infinite procedurally generated spots of content have more breadth than a smaller hand-tuned map.
---
I play all three of these games and love them all for their strong points, but I wouldn't really say there's more breadth or depth with either elite or nms compared to eve. 
---
If anything I play the other two games when I want less "game" to wrap my head around at the end of the day. The decisions are easier, the focus is smaller and the amount of data is much less compared to eve.
---
You're not wrong. Alliances seem happy enough to rely on their trump card thinking it's all they'll ever need until of course they can't anymore. An alliance built around a personality cult only survives for as long as that one person will allow. It's even less stable when that alliance is also run by that FC. People just jump ship to another personality the moment that's gone.
---
I appreciate the author's intent and goal in releasing this report. I can particularly appreciate it in my non-game persona as a social scientist and can confirm that the importance of group dynamics he mentions is one of those unmeasurable "X-factors" that is even MORE important than the author suggests. How do you measure trust? How do you quantify openness to ideas? I am SO pleased to hear DD's description of what happens and irrespective of the outcomes, I am pleased to be part of a "game" (I mean, this IS more than a game to many of us, right?) that acknowledges the importance of working together as a team.
---
Eh that's a stretch. You're attributing the symptoms of an actually relatively healthy codebase (at nearly 20 years it's ANCIENT compared to everything outside Finance and Government). More code = more bugs, always, no matter how good you are. 
---
Using that observation to make the jump to "they broadly fucked up the fundamentals of database normalization" is actually kindve insulting.
---
&gt; Why should their opinion be valued over someone who lives there.
---
It isn't. But the people that live there aren't the sole arbiters of the nullsec ecosystem. And remember, listening only to nullseccers got us to where we are.
---
&gt; Additionally we can clearly see these changes are taking the game off a cliff
---
I don't think so. The game hasn't really changed that much. It's mostly the same. These changes aren't nearly as huge as the rampant screaming here pretends it is.
---
The vast majority of content, even when just limited to PVP doesn't really rely on local or cynos, pve even less so.
---
Standing on the corner reading r/eve while waiting on my next client.
---
Alliances are cults.
---
&gt;Now half those noobs have to move into a garbage unfun nullbloc and the other half quit   
---
I mean, that literally already happened before the changes.
---
I have found this subreddit does have a fair number of people who are just looking to create drama. But aside from them there are a few who want to talk about the game and how it impacts them. All playstyles should have their place, it's what makes the ecoysystem so engaging! But as you say things should be balanced. 
---
People whining doesn't resolve anything, offering solutions maybe does!
---
Anyway respect you thinking about it and responding. 
---
Fly dangerous RandomGoon420 o7

You really should elaborate about #2 because the way that I see it, it only help people. It provides them with cheaper market and production services.
---
&gt; I have a hard time saying that games with basically infinite procedurally generated spots of content have more breadth than a smaller hand-tuned map.
---
Well, considering that's what breadth is, it's weird you would have a hard time saying that.
---
You want to build a wall around High Sec, and get the Null alliances to pay for it?
---
This explains the clusterfuck in ZO-P5K, 77S8-E, and 46DP-O this morning
---
More like Nyarlathotep. Azathoth is notorious for being AFK. Uncle Gnarly though...
---
Oh, sorry. I thought you lived in null. Must have misunderstood.
---
Haha, good try.
---
imo the simulation mode is a no brainer. Allowing alliances to use it would be good too, since we can already do it on SiSi but this would be much lower effort factor.
---
Citadels are good, but the mechanics around them are bad, like spam and timers as you said.
---
LS being dead is a HUGE reason the game has issues, imo. There's no area for newbros to go to that gives them tastes of stuff anymore. It used to be a way-station of sorts.
---
It's the opposite in case friend. I would love to play but now with kids eve is overkill for me. Sad it's not more casual. I have unsubscribed all my accounts due to this
---
Truth, man, truth. Not even joking or trying to make a meme but I'm honestly surprised this came from you.

I guess, now that you mention it, self-loathing counts too.

I don't care how colorful you write your stories, your medium is shit, all of your stories are probably shit too. im glad you enjoy them, or whatever, but disregarding your dubious claims to be living in the now, ill just go ahead and recognize the present for what it is... some jack off trying to justify an unhealthy addiction with some wishy washy bullshit excuse
---
But afaik more people scanning does not have an effect on the total amount of holes - they will spawn in whether they are probed down or not.  
---
But 2-3 daily nullsec connections from a C5 is quite a marked increase over the past.
---
Let's do a little bit of basic math.
---
Currently, on a website I wont mention, $1 is going for 300,000,000 ISK.
---
$1,000,000 * 300,000,000 ISK = 300,000,000,000,000 ISK required to make a million dollars of sales.

That's three hundred TRILLION ISK made simply to RMT.  A VNI bot would have to spend
---
300,000,000,000,000/45,000,000= 6666666.6 HOURS to be able to make that amount, and that doesn't even take into consideration the time and effort it takes to sell, launder, and actually profit off of product.
---
There are 8760 hours in an average calendar year, and if we take into consideration a downtime and setup period of 30 minutes, we're left with 8577.5 hours.
---
6666666.6/8577.5=777.2 Bots running non-stop, around the clock, VNI ratting. We all know that bots incur massive losses post blackout (ie, they're not viable to run in nullsec right now) so a much not insane number 15m/hr abyssal or mission running bot (which is also on the 'generous to you' end, considering most bots are distro or venture bots which make 5m/hr), which would put us at (777.2*3)=2331.7 bots running, non stop, around the clock. That's over 11% of the eve PEAK concurrent playerbase (2331/20500), which means at any given point in time it's more likely than not that over a sixth (18%) of the players playing eve at any given point in time are botting.
---
&gt;Edit: Your numbers are whack.

I am not screeching and my type of gameplay is to kill krabs.

Is this copypasta?

Only the bots and krabs

The combat is very engaging if you do something other than anchor and F1.

I guess playing a video game occasionally and enjoying it is an unhealthy addiction...
---
You really love assuming a whole bunch of irrational nonsense don't you?
---
The salt is strong with this one.
---
It's just the bots that Ccp banned for recording your favorite shows to watch later on your mobile device.
---
We all know that CCP and Effort are incompatible.
---
Thank you !
---
Hands-down the best post of the day. Eve has seemed short-handed since Gigx was banned.
---
Using rocket science to explain how simple a proposed UI change would be, we EvE players are such nerds.
---
What would happen to the delta-v based status bar if a freighter was at 50% velocity in 100% the correct vector but then got bumped by a MWD Machariel up to 400% speed but at a 90% angle?
---
I suspect that the calculation you are doing would sometimes show a result greater than 100% but the ship would still not qualify for warp. I other words it wouldn't work as a status bar in EvE.
---
As long as these suggestions don't result in them having fun, I'm all for them!
---
10/10 lol take my upvote.
---
Would you blame the players if your game of Monopoly was boring, or would you blame Hasbro, who make Monopoly: a noted boring game?
---
So because people work together and make their area of space better means their immature? I think it's pretty immature to sperg on the fourms about not being able to have risk free pvp and crying to ccp to change the game because "it's to hard to pvp the way I want to on my terms" then when the changes are implemented and the playerbase craters because this is supposed to be a sand box and a vocal minority elected space trump to make the game easy for them. You dont seem to have the mental acuity to understand a connected game like eve needs mutiple play styles or it goes into a cascade.
---
For instance if one jump freighter pilot who supplies null sec with modules and ships quits (because moving a jump freighter is cancer now) then the people looking to fit ships now have to go to high sec to find fittings. So that's 40+ jumps which is about an hour. 
---
Why would someone waste the 2-3 hours a night they have to play videogames jumping to high sec just to get fittings or ships or mods? When they could play one of the thousands of other games out now? Now that that person has quit perhaps ore prices go up, or there are less people in fleet or less people pvping. 
---
One person quitting in eve has a massive cascade effect because their choices effect fewer people. Now with null sec dark it becomes a security risk to communicate in a fucking MMO so space feels empty because no one is talking, people are not undocking due to the constant bitching from "hunters" who dont want to work for pvp. So less players leads to less interaction leads to more players not seeing a point to playing the game which leads to even less interactions and more people quitting faster and faster and faster. 
---
Eve is at 2005 levels of activity, 90% new players quit withing 5-15 minutes of playing the game. Vets are sick of ccp flipping switches in the data base because they fired most of their dev team and cant implementanything new. Now ccp is deciding the most active userbase is "playing the game wrong" and those bets are leaving with not enough new players to make up for it. There are over 7800 systems in eve and the playerbase is about to go under 10k once the three month subs run out. 
---
If you cant see this is the biggest crisis that eve has ever had then your blind or delusional.
---
Listening to nullsec did not get us here, nullsec and their csm reps were ignored every step of the way towards this, get your narrative right. We opposed all the things I listed from coming out, but once they existed we adapted and moved forward. Now here we are yearsater being blamed for changes we opposed and being punished for using the things we told ccp would ruin the game. 
---
So you don't think the massive and constant decline of users is bad thing? The game was already on a decline and these changes have accelerated it.
---
As far as I know with this bill there are no benefits (monetary or otherwise) included, just the medallion itself. I just wanted to share it with the community since bills like this barely ever make the news and if folks care enough they could call their congressperson and reference the specific bill with ease :)
---
CCP didn't make every alliance blue every other alliance in the closest 5 regions. That was all the players doing. Why would alliances do that? Oh, so they could pve to fat wallets and then super cap up so no one could ever overthrow them. 
---
In case you all forgot, Eve was declining all last year. The blackout is meant to shake things up. You can all whine as much as you want, but CCP wouls rather have a lower player base than a shit fucked game where everyone krabs all day.
---
I remember roaming with you as FC. Was good times!
---
Can't remember when though... It was a small gang setup, at least.
---
Stop it dude. Dont ruining peoples narratives, it shatters their world. Just like Olmecas did, although he seems a bit slower on the uptake.
---
I have noticed this since i came back a week ago , i would go weeks without a highsec/highsecstatic connection in my regular area i have found at least 4 in the past 4 days and i am sure there have been more since i am only just getting my sea legs back scanning. more pew pew fun!
---
sure, im just irrational, because your idiotic excuses don't impress me, that's probably all it is
---
LOL this meme has legs. It could be hilarious.

Delta v calculations work for adjusting direction, not only magnitude.
---
It would never result in greater than 100% as the number could never be negative.
---
Warp would be at 0, and the start would be at the total required Delta v at the press of the button (or the maximum of later bumped).
---
I'm really confused about your question as it seems to functionally not understand 3d physics.
---
The force needed to be applied to change a vectors direction is still a calculable force.
---
Tell them what their ship fits for different things should be

I understand the sentiment and the desire to be proactive, and more power to you.

fwiw, I wasn't denying women's experiences but rather was telling you that declaring your group a safe space for women in this manner (with a lady on a pedestal) is a double-edged sword for many.
---
The taste of my friends is for clear and well-enforced rules and neutral advertising. They find gender callouts slightly patronizing at best and precisely as creepy as the shitters you're trying to screen out at worst ("come on in ladies, *we'll protec u")*.
---
Simply consider the fact that, when set in the context of an MMO community which is already a minefield for them, this kind of thing can have the opposite of its intended effect.
---
have you ever heard the phrase
---
'don't hate the player, hate the game'?
---
I believe my statement stands Snuff to my understanding does not use Titans and Supers against any Imperium entity and has general agreements not to. Snuff will only use their supers/titans to support Imperium entities this is in exchange for their supply agreements through INIT. So while you don't have general restrictions for farming them, your higher level agreements are to protect them in large conflict. 
---
This is clearly seen in the battle of X47  where snuff will support any major Imperium conflict with their supers and titans.
---
"Dont believe everyhing you read on the internet" -Abraham Lincoln
---
&gt; since we can already do it on SiSi but this would be much lower effort factor.
---
Also considering the SiSi rules aren't enforced at all a simulation that you could invite people to would get rid of the need for a "no non-consensual fights" rule.

Have you ever listened to the show? At best, he parrots with no understanding beyond the very surface
---
Okay, This is some good shit :P
---
Use hull warning for text.
---
The reason ratting isn't as valuable is because of the 20 Rorq krabs that have been doing it in safety for so long. The value of ISK has gone down as has the value of ores because of it. It may take many months before the value is corrected.
---
I love you guys. wh pilots have given me some of the best "training"
---
Unless they're kickguy, lol.
---
You can absolutely take direct player feedback and questions to the table and ask them and get answers. Just as you can present those problems on the internal forum system, whatever they are using now.
---
There is nothing wrong about a player believing that their rep can get answers to questions and .I absolutely expect reps who promise to take their voters issues to CCP to take their voters issues to CCP. Even if CCP has no answer at least you asked
---
No one finishes a game of Monopoly and says "man, this game sucks because of how we played it".
---
You say it sucks because hasbro made a shit boring game.

This is a good one

Your retarded
---
Fit?
---
for the long term health of eve, it's all about physical players behind desktops. More plain income is much less important. And usually, a game makes enough revenue as long as player stay, f2p or subscribing
---
I didnt day a CSM rep can't do that. I just said for an idea to reach to CCP it doesn't require a CSM rep to talk about it on the table.
---
Yeah the scram range would help a bit with MWD fit things to be able to actually catch them... But it's a super selective ship in terms of targets.
---
in alliance scale battles, recons are a small price
---
Oh no, I like to play the game, and that offends you some how.
---
I played and had fun. Isn't that all that matters? Why would I want players here that don't like to play the game? The left for a reason. They couldn't adapt, so seems logical they'd leave. Right? As long as I'm having a good ole time, it's not my responsibility to teach others how to HTFU. 
---
The game is changing. You either play or don't. The more you cry about it, the more you don't belong here, which is currently about 95% of the goon babies.
---
Capital ships aren't meant to be solo pwnmobiles. Fly them with a fleet and they are much better.
---
B I T C O N N E C T
---
*Inhaled* 
---
You are right
---
So what am I exactly wrong about? I'm sure your actually agreeing with what I said
---
I have no idea how it actually works out. But if it makes the "underdogs" commit caps earlier, it's great.
---
And if the "underdogs" actually win some fights with that, and the "drop caps asap" becomes norm. It's even better, as it gives huge opportunities to force a pyrrhus victory, which sometimes is good enough.
---
&gt; But afaik more people scanning does not have an effect on the total amount of holes - they will spawn in whether they are probed down or not
---
Nah. If you want, you can test this by scanning on Sisi. Spoiler alert: you will find probably 0 k162s.
---
What a load of propaganda
---
Satan doesn't fly a hauler, he flies an interdictor.
---
It takes 3 months to get max level in WoW (2012), casual playstyle.  It takes maybe another month to get your tier gear figured out, then 3 months to enjoy said gear, via the end-game raids.
---
EVE lets you skill up while offline, but the fact that it takes 12 fucking months to get your support skills to 4/5, and then another 6 months for a selection of T2 ships (not all, mind you), or another 1 year for a selection of capitals / a super, is ridiculous.
---
Their "greed is good" policy to only allow shrinking these 1.5 - 2 years down to "a few months" (like every other MMO) if you spend heavily on PLEX / injectors, is what's keeping the new people away.  Newbies look at the times involved, and see either 2 years or hundreds of dollars in PLEX costs, and nobody wants to spend that.
---
People paid money for PLEX and injectors.  People paid money to inject skills into their characters.  If CCP decides to revamp the whole skill system so it doesn't take so long, how can they do it without the veterans blowing up?
---
I think I found my new hobby. 
---
Lose ships. RNG Salt. Send EVEmail. troll /r/eve for my epic thread to be created. ??? Profit.
---
&gt; they will spawn in whether they are probed down or not.
---
No, if hole has not been warped to, its autospawn timer never starts.
---
You can have the same static persist for days by just never warping to it. Not sure it works the same way for wanderings, but why not?
---
Sadly no one's coming to help. FRT got rid of the friends it had.
---
This solution feels to much like move them straight to end game and hope that works. 
---
Honestly it gives new players both to much choice where they can't pick what to use because they lack the information to make such a choice along with reducing the "early game fun cycle", learning and exploring the game is fun finding out how mechanics work is fun, now i do agree we need to up the starting isk somewhat recently rolling a clean alpha again it's sorta a pain in the ass to get your starting capital ( especially if you don't want to look like you known what your doing ). 
---
Now the biggest problem with Eve right now for new players are really all UI related, where as a new player you often have no clue what to do ( i suspect a majority of the players give up because WTF do i do )
---
Someone lost a Titan, therefore EvE is dead?

PLEASE MORE TOXIC YELLING LEADERSHIP! YES, THAT IS WHY EVE IS DYING. WE LOVE BEING THREATENED AND YELLED AT DEEP DOWN INSIDE. IT MAKES US FEEL JUSTIFIED IN OUT LACK OF CONFIDENCE! PLEASE OVERLORD, REEEEE AT ME SOME MORE.

Sean was a good Eve player, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the indoors… and Eve Online, and as a computer janitor for the Imperalist US Regime he explored the consulates of Northern Libya, from tripoli to Benghazi and… up to… Banghazi. He died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at Kor-Azor, at Cloud Ring, at J7HZ-F. These young men gave their lives playing a lot of a spreadsheet video game for autistics. And so would Sean. Sean, who loved Eve Online. And so, Sean “The Vile Rat” Smith, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the Sahara Desert, which you loved so well. Good night, sweet prince.
---
Goonswarm
---
This is not bad advice, but people are either too entrenched in their habits and die-hard tribalist ways, or they simply don't know how to do other playstyles at all, because they get recruited into specific ones very early on as newbies.
---
Finally, there are also people criticizing their own playstyle and these are going to be very hard to convince otherwise, because they have previous experience of it. I used to be a nullsecer turned roamer myself, so i can see both sides of the "empire building" vs "hunter" coin. I came back to the game after a decade, saw all these extra tools people have now to secure, consolidate and stifle conflict and thought to myself "yeah, that's tanking the economy and conflict drivers so hard, it's not going to last much longer". Then i saw how much reaction gets drummed up when there is talk of balancing these things back to a reasonable level frankly the first thing that comes to mind is "these guys still have it too easy and still complain too much".
---
And frankly it's not unnatural, because a lot of them don't even know any other way. Maybe that's also a part of the problem. Mass recruitment drives are good for newbro retention and helping to get them up on their feet when starting, but they also create swarms of players who don't have their own initiative. It sure is difficult to pinpoint and balance.
---
I want a game where players have fair risk vs reward. I want a game where players are willing to take a risk to make wealth. I want a game where players don't quit because they're too afraid of dying. I want a game where alliances don't blue everyone 5 regions out. I want a game where people can work together to achieve greatness no matter how big or small you are. 
---
All I want are players willing to do the things to make exciting content no matter what CCP does. What I want is not about changes in the game, I want changes in how people play the game. I want players to stop whining and reset their alliances standings and start growing some balls.

I use Business Insider for many of my stock quotes   
---
 [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock)
---
&gt; So because people work together and make their area of space better means their immature?
---
Want to walk me through this logic? Because nobody ever said this.
---
&gt; I think it's pretty immature to sperg on the fourms about not being able to have risk free pvp and crying to ccp to change the game
---
At least we agree on that. But who is doing that? I mean asode from the people that want it to be as easy as possible to drop all the titans on everything that moves.
---
&gt; the people looking to fit ships now have to go to high sec to find fittings. So that's 40+ jumps which is about an hour.
---
Or you can...how do I put this....actually I'll use your words "work together and make their area of space better"
---
The whole alliance relying on one person isn't working together or making your space better.
---
You do know industry exists outside of highsec right? Nullsec even gets industry bonuses on multiple fronts. Oh no, regional markets with locally sourced goods. The horror!!!
---
&gt; constant bitching from "hunters" who dont want to work for pvp.
---
Where? Can you link this?
---
If it's so constant why isn't it anywhere on Reddit?
---
&gt; which leads to even less interactions
---
The statistics don't really reflect this at this point in time.
---
&gt; 90% new players quit withing 5-15 minutes of playing the game
---
So 1. Citation needed. 2. Cynos and blackout don't affect that.
---
&gt; most active userbase is "playing the game wrong" a
---
Citation needed. Nobody thinks this. At least not in hmthe way you're implying it.
---
Saying "the current mechanics are grossly in favor of this specific playstyle" is not saying "this playstyle is wrong". It's called balance.
---
This is the kind of immaturity I was talking about. You can't even have a remotely honest discussion without jumping to irrational exaggerations.
---
&gt; the playerbase is about to go under 10k
---
Citation needed.
---
If you cant see this is the biggest crisis that eve has ever had then your blind or delusional
---
I'm neither, as I do see that as an issue.
---
I just don't agree with your irrational position as a whole.
---
Maybe I missed it, but nullsec wanted player made starbases, right?
---
Were the nullsec CSMs campaigning against stronger supers?
---
Did nullsec CSMs campaign against better rorquals and infinite anoms?
---
That's not how reddit works mate- I see the message in the inbox, and show parent to see which comment you're responding to.
---
  So go on- copy paste what your views are.
---
One-time sinks won't solve the problem with vasts amounts of titans used. It would be better to add some kind of maintenance tax to supercaps. Like, 5-10% of jita mineral value per month.
---
Today I learned:
---
*Players are the ones who "balanced" rorquals into AFK Isk-printing machines. 
---
*Players are the ones who made it so Titans could boson entire frigate fleets off the map.
---
*Players are the ones who made it so Supers and Titans could do ANY damage to ships smaller than battleships, or do ratting. 
---
*Players are the ones who introduced skill injectors so ultra-krabs could pay their way into a fleet of Isk-printing rorquals. 
---
*Players are the ones who left things thus way for so long one player group could build a mountain of Supers and Titans. 
---
*Players are the ones who balanced citadels so they could give most all of their benefits (tethering and asset safety) without even needing fuel, and made them cheap enough to be spammed everywhere. 
---
*Players are the ones who allowed Titans and Supers to dock and fall under asset safety. 
---
*Players are the ones who introduced asset safety in the first place...
---
*Players are the ones who did nothing to de-incentivise merging together into huge blocs.  
---
*Players are the ones who prioritized short-term profits over the long term health of the game...
---
Yep, not CCPs fault at all...
---
Has CCP posted their upkeep costs?  You're assuming 75k euro / month doesn't cover it, and I'll give you that it probably doesn't cover *salaries* for the network people, but they can always "downsize" salaries, and I think they've done so already.
---
Then i misunderstood your point. My apologies.
---
P.S. It's not my ship, i was just commenting
---
Haha :) You must be old school, hopefully catch you in space sometime.
---
Fly dangerous o7
---
Sure. Didn't claim otherwise.
---
My point was no matter how much "CSM are not game designers" hurf and turf going around, the situation is much more nuanced and CCP does make use of CSM/player proposals in a less direct way.
---
Now this is a good shit post
---
Delusional it is.

Diplomacy, recruitment, shittalking.
---
Not necessarily in that order.

Where's the gain of zero risk? RMT?

Second that

It’s same for me atm. I’m a trader and I literally have no reason to log unless to update orders or import stuff, which lately I haven’t been doing either. I have no idea what to do with so much ISK as it’s not fun welping expensive ships when there’s no one to fight you
---
Thank you !  We need more good shit posting around here !
---
This is a really good post. My kind of attitude.
---
I find myself in a strange place in Eve now. I was a miner industry guy when I first moved to null years ago, and sucked it all out and reskilled when extractors became a thing. Now after years of mostly pvp, there are needs out there now. Fuel isnt getting churned out at needed volumes, a lot of people are clueless but eager to learn how to defend, attack and work together. I find myself setting up PI, even making a spreadsheet or 2. It's weird but also, and most importantly, it's *interesting*.
---
Thank you again for sharing that's really cool.
---
lol totally
---
Been there done that, that's why i moved out of null and into wormhole space.
---
If someone has a stubbed toe nobody treats that with a shotgun blast to the face. No one except ccp.
---
Same, this one is pretty good
---
I mean, its shitposting, idk what u expected

They also do them directly for some things are surprisingly direct.

But it never goes well to tell the people you asked to speak for that you won't speak at the table.

Please post this on the official forums, this would be great to start a conversation for.

There's plenty of racism in EVE, just go through GSF's corporation list and you'll probably find half a dozen, plus some station names and hundreds of characters with racist names. Same goes for misogynistic names, remember Gang Bang Team with their alliance logo that CCP had no issue with?
---
EVE has always been a racist, nationalist, misogynist and homophobic cesspool, because its developer doesn't give a shit about any of it. These chinese  logs are laughable compared to what we have now.
---
The real problem is isk price being too low. Imagine all WOW gears are in Blizzard's transaction shop with 5 dollar a piece, would you swipe your credit card or working your ass off in game for those equipment. 15 dollar is the starter pack price for most MMORPG and in eve that money will yield you more than a billion, that's almost straight end game money for new player, he can buy almost anything sub-supercapital with that money. And when he tries to make some isk himself, he will soon realize he's not making more than 10mil/hr. Nope, he's not gonna play this shit.
---
I mean the dudes but phoning suck though right?

I lol'd at that, never seen the meme before
---
Your assuming a studio that had 60k active players per day a few years ago now down to 12-15k has a sustainable business model? 
---
You are also assuming that all of the 12-15k users are paying accounts. That is not true. A large part of the 12-15k are alpha accounts and the rest are mostly  3 month subscriptions that end within the next week or two. The game is hemorrhaging players at around 1-2k per week.

I would even go as far as, Crispy!
---
Cite where we supported these changes. We are still calling excavators, citadels, injectors, sov all bad system.
---
Sov nullsec explained would be ruled by interceptors and capitals with entosis. Ccp doubted it launched as it was on sisi and sword fleet or fax with entosis became a thing and ccp had to nerf it.
---
Nullsec citadels would be an insane grind if launched as is and ccp had to eventually nerf shield timers.
---
Literally everyone said injectors were a bad idea but it made ccp a lot of money so here we are.
---
We projected rorquals would become crazy mining platforms and ccp launched the dumbest things ever and have kept nerfing them.
---
These things are the problems. Maybe ccp could start with these instead of nerfing randomly.
---
And no local was not perfect Intel before you even start to imply that's why it had to go.
---
Lol, right.
---
Having a toxic nerd who generates articles about death threats in the gaming media is not a good way to recruit new players.

Thank you for the effort Mr Dunk. I appreciate you being a window into whats happening even though there are understandable limits.

I've done this several times! 10/10 would recommend.
---
 It's always a fun thing to do. When I first started I got big into mining/production then after about a year I changed gears and joined a lowsec FW corp and followed them around for a few years. Recently I've joined a nullsec megablock just to see what extended living in null was like. It's been fun so far and I figure next year I'll be slapping the hood of my Loki as I scream into the endless void that is wormhole space :)
---
With the game bleeding 1-2k players a week by march it wont matter who's in what alliance
---
Really true.  Since the moment CCP devoted all resources to walking in stations.  They been making bad decisions ever since.
---
Oh BOY put on your helmet pull down your visor and strap in!!!!
---
Another week and we will be at less than 13k in ustz.
---
People used to watch Netflix while they played EVE. 
---
The devs made a change to the game, which caused some people to get mad and stop playing, causing a huge drop in Netflix stock price
---
Hmm wonder why.
---
His killboard shows 0 kills 80 losses, seems quite a few people have been cursed for all eternity. Scary stuff.
---
In other news: Drive thru restaurant stocks McDonalds ([MCD +2.0%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD?p=MCD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and YUM! Brands ([YUM +1.5%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/YUM/community?p=YUM)) surging on news that EVE players can now perform basic functions such as leaving their homes to pick up tendies.
---
Okay, buddy.
---
Many people would watch Netflix while playing EVE online passively.  The Dev's made changes to the game that made playing AFK more difficult and Netflix's stocks plummeted.  Coincidence ??
---
Tbh i wish they would since those're just karma farming 95% of the time
---
The meme was people would watch netflix while doing the most uninteractive and grindy shit in eve
---
The devs made some changes that made that playstyle far more punishing and less rewarding so many quit... thus not watching as much netflix
---
Look at all those established nullsec people telling an upstart it's pretty much not worth getting into the nullsec game, just because their toys got nerfed.
---
I have some free logic lying around, you all want some? Let's go...
---
1. If it's impossible for small groups to get their foot in the door then nothing has changed. So the established groups are whining over changes that are only a mild inconvenience to them.
---
2. If small groups are excited to move into null because of the changes, the "poor little guy will get roflstomped every time by our blobs" narrative is bullshit.
---
Choose one.
---
nah the WH and people that just play to hunt are there. What happens when the prey stop subbing.
---
Thought I misclicked and was in /r/wallstreetbets
---
More refined tools for finding other players/corps doing things you want to do in space that dont encourage everyone to drop into the same 4 or 5 massive nullsec newbie mob corps on day 1.
---
I like it. Local should come back to some degree but not back to what it was and this is an interesting concept. 
---
I would make the resource only available in low sec instead of npc null. I get the idea behind NPC null but that hurts the little guys more than larger groups that don't have NPC null. Lowsec, while making it easier still has its risks. Making the sources of the fuel scarce will be the content driver instead. Maybe non-static so people can't just move into a single system and camp the closest source?
---
Change the mechanic so it initiates on warp only including when cloaked(excluding the login warp). This way you cover any case where someone is in system. People can cov cyno in and not be on local until they warp or come through a wh. 
---
I think a limit on how many can be online in an entire region or constellation would be a good idea too. It would make them strategic objectives for invasions so you can have local in your staging system or in strategic systems. I think a high limit is needed but not every system and we know cost isn't a real limiter.
---
Fuel bay - It shouldn't be able to hold 30 days worth of fuel. 3 days? 5 days? 8?
---
offline/online time. I think the offline should be long. The tactic shouldn't be to just offline it once someone is tackled and then the debuff is gone. The intel was there when you were tackled so it should hurt.
---
I actually think with some refining this should be put into the game.
---
Reddit would die of the autism
---
I'm not assuming anything; I just asked if they posted their costs.  
---
I guess I could have asked for a source / citation for your claim that 75k / month (to quote, "5k real people" at $15/mo subscription rate each) does not cover their costs.
---
I'll take that as a "no", they haven't posted their upkeep costs, and am not going to engage in a discussion using player numbers and the type of account (alpha or omega) that are pulled out of thin air.
---
&gt; Sov nullsec explained would be ruled by interceptors and capitals with entosis. Ccp doubted it launched as it was on sisi and sword fleet or fax with entosis became a thing and ccp had to nerf it.
---
Oh no, iterative design, fuck.
---
&gt; Nullsec citadels would be an insane grind if launched as is and ccp had to eventually nerf shield timers.
---
Oh no iterative design, fuck.
---
&gt; And no local was not perfect Intel before you even start to imply that's why it had to go.
---
It was the definition of perfect intel.
---
It PERFECTLY represented a piece of information. That doesn't inherently mean it needs to go, but to say it wasn't perfect is nonsensical.
---
Imperfect would mean it is questionable, possibly wrong, or misrepresentative.
---
It isn't any of those things. It perfectly represented who was in the system. 100% (at least as designed).
---
This is the quality content we need

Imagine getting home from work and looking at your desktop. You see the launchers for 4 games: Eve, Overwatch, Warframe, and Path of Exile. Which one are you gonna click on to have fun with for 30-60 before making supper/going to that rec sports game, or whatever any of you well adjusted adults do.
---
Answer: Basically any one except Eve.
---
What did they change?
---
ledol (laughed)

Say you and 7 or so of your ppl were fucking around in and around someone's capital system.  Flying frigs and dessies.  Disrupting supply, killing ratters/miners, being a general menace, and melting the trickle of dudes that come in 1's and 2's.  All of a sudden you got 50+ jackdaws or 200 cerbs.  Typically we'd keep them engaged by showing a little leg while we move in a dictor and a brick tanked aug navy issue to call in the dreads.  The ani is 150k ehp with 0 bling btw (60m total).  It always dies before halfway through the cyno cycle, but we push off the cerbs/jackdaws by killing several.  Now the only thing that makes any sense is to allow them to push us out, and harass them again later.  I am not making to call to feed a recon to handle overshiping retards, would you?
---
I know Twilight quite well and I've never known him to have an ounce of salt in him. If he has a strong enough opinion of something to make a Reddit post, he has obviously thought it through.

Miss flying with you, friend. Hit me up anytime youd care to do more spelunking.
---
Balancing ISK sinks doesn't solve issues with Rorquals. They spam minerals to the game, and you only counterbalance that with mineral sinks (destruction).
---
I don't play E. V. E. but based on context clues.
---
EVE is a MMO with focus on ship functions and a huge world for players to travel. Playing the game can be amazing but Tedious to others.
---
The developers must have removed elements where players could "play" the game but be AFK. So imagine starting the game to progress, but you've left the house and went to work while the game plays itself.
---
This meme is saying since the Devs took out AFK features, players stopped watching Netflix. (Netflix viewership drops, stocks drop)
---
This wont change underdog-bigdog thing. I think it will just make it harder for people to commit caps against people who own the space. But its not enough to stop big dogs if you get what I mean? Real capfights are about owning the grid with subcaps. The underdogs wont be able to do that no matter what. Its more when the fights are somewhat even that shit will break cause one side will have cap advantage.
---
I think SOV fights might get a shitton more boring and the game becoming more stagnant.

Also some more timesaving.
---
Yea, actually just undocking in a ship and taking whatever fights you get can be fun, sometimes you lose and explode, thems the breaks, it's also how you get to be NOT a "pvp noob".  Like honestly your approach at learning PVP is only taking winnable fights, you'll never learn shit that way.
---
Flair checks out.

(Wormholer btw)
---
I’m laughing outside my supervisors office.
---
No idea what I just tried to read was about.
---
EVE Onion open up
---
Now this is a quality shitpost
---
The ability to see who was in the system you were in from local chat. 
---
It used to be an automatically updating,  real time list of everyone in the system with you.  That has been changed to you only show if you talk in the local channel
---
You do realise there has been reports on this already right? Saying that RMTing in Eve is very lucrative and has always been. Like in every other game. 
---
And all you are basing your numbers on is 1 website with 1 method. And you are for instance completely forgetting that NS bots are around, incursion bots level 3 missions, higher abyssal sites. I mean you can just as easily do t2 sites and get as much as VNI ratting right? Up to level 3 is rather easy.
---
Zero sum game lol. If you're not learning from dying, you're shit, and gaining knowledge in eve is important. So if you die, and learn something from your death, it's not a zero sum loss for you.

I've found the CSM unapproachable, similar to CCP on many occasions. The times I have seen fit to provide feedback or comment on something in the game or out of it, the CSM members I have interacted with have been arrogant, opinionated and self-serving and taken great pleasure in picking apart any feedback or idea I have provided. Now I just don't bother.
---
If you have a very public profile as a Pilot, the CSM and in many cases CCP will give you the shirt off their back, but if you are simply a casual player who plays Eve as a game, they couldn't careless. That opinion hasn't changed in the 10+ yrs Ive been in Eve and I don't see it changing anytime soon. However I'm open minded.
---
Experts: Players reportedly trolling Reddit, idling in Discord servers,  simulating fits with [Pyfa](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases)  and Alpha testing the 2019 EVE Portal app on their smart devices.

But a new player doesn't necessarily need all V skills to have fun... Unless people tell them they have to be complete to start playing.

I had so much fun a few weeks in.

That said, i don't oppose a less restricted start. I saw someone suggesting the magic 14 starting out higher or maxer, but unextractable (not counted towards the extracting start point).

"You're not wrong."

I want local for the "community", shit talking, whatever.  I don't care about the intel.   In fact, I'd be happy if CCP cut all intel out of their apis.

N/A.  I don't PVE
---
\&gt;  When  was the last time (before blackout) that you took a fight willingly and  what is your procedure when a lone cynabal enters your system.

N/A.  I don't play small-gang PVP.     And ganking is something that should be done behind closed doors and you wash your hands afterwards.

My playstyle is empire-builidng alliance member.   In practice, an F1 Monkey.    That's really the only thing left about EvE that interests me; I just like going on fleets.

\&gt; How long do you think the game will survive if we do a rollback before chaos era.
---
The work wouldn't be done with a rollback.  There's still problems with Sov mechanics, citadels, and the growing irrelevance of subcaps.
---
To answer your question:    not long, but longer than EvE will last if they continue with chaos.
---
Haven't played for 3 years.  Don't care.
---
are you serious
---
this is a real life threat now? 
---
imagine being this weak and sensitive
---
Not counting plex, since that is effected by a lot of different things, there has not been a significant amount of inflation.
---
How long do you think it will be before its china vs the rest of eve?
---
I wonder if enough people peruse both maybe we can troll /r/wallstreetbets
---
Thank you.  We can all agree that good quality shitposts are what this subreddit needs more of
---
And a max filter in case youre limited on space.
---
Iterative design that took up to a year. Do think we can survive a year at this current rate?
---
And that's not the point anyways, these are all things we predicted were bad, and are still bad, that ccp did the bare minimum to make less bad. Any one of those things listed still need to be changed to fix the game but we don't see ccp changing then. 
---
The only thing ccp is changing is amusingly stuff that makes roaming into null easier and living in null harder. 
---
Fine if that's how you want to define perfect then sure, but peollw often say it perfectly told you who was a threat, which it did not do.
---
Y'all got alt Netflix accounts too?
---
_Except_, why weren't they running two bots before in NS, to make the 100 m/h?
---
You think they thought "I'm getting 50 million, that's enough, I won't bother running another" ?
---
For all that, would you sign a contract that says you'll play for at least 3 months, logging in daily for at least 2 hours, with at least 5 hours of PVP combat per week?
---
 There are a slew of overly open agreeable player and the truth is they don't matter all that much. They'll 'play' the game regardless, those people who stop playing are the opposite, retaining them (still cheaper than retaining new players) means developing the game for them. 
---
If you make the game more niche your company makes less money. It already has that full loot pvp thing; its pretty damn niche to begin with. You don't develop for fewer and fewer people and succeed in anything but making your personal video game.
---
Put the development in a conservatives hands and we'll drown all the same as nothing ever changes. OTOH we'll drown if we go full steam in the opposite direction as well, we have been. It takes chaos and order to develop successfully - going full retard in one direction is not a successful game development plan - much like it wasn't when we got in this predicament in the first place.
---
The magic is finding where eve is fresh and different, has risk and reward, wolves and sheep. You need the animals coming to the drinking hole. This intermediary bullshit, where the game suffers through the mirage like vision
---
&gt;  the whole genre is losing appeal.
---
I think the whole genre burned out its customers. It's like when facebook games were all the rage until they suddenly weren't, because the developers got greedy and exploited all of their customers until they quit.
---
MMOs kept adding life-sucking features until everybody destroyed their lives and had to quit cold-turkey to get their shit pulled together.
---
Those of us who did have their shit together were driven away by the life-sucky designed to appeal to the 5% of hardcore nolifers. 
---
I used to be heavily into MMOs but now I like strategy games where I can play 30 minutes or 3 hours whenever I feel like it, rather than having to sit down and commit to 2-3 hours a day.
---
funny thing is that this graph is REAL.  If they take away blackout, Im buying stock !
---
Lol, this writeup is brilliant, especially the structure names and modes.
---
The actual mechanics are not bad either.
---
I was awarded quite a bit of gold recently, so have some yourself.
---
&gt; I hear it's pretty good.
---
I honestly loved GW2. I wouldn't go in expecting to play forever, but there's a few 100 hours of really thrilling content before you get into the "run dungeons and farm nodes forever" endgame.

What fixes? I'm curious as someone who didn't play then
---
You shut your whore mouth dirty squid!
---
Ah yes, skillbar combat with the standard RS 600ms lag/tic rate. 
---
Such fun.
---
The recent smithing/mining update was legit though.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cV_q-mVAAA
---
So you want me to mine and rat for the next 30 days?
---
try hollywood. or as movies are dead ask whoever is producing for netflix.
---
Join rest of us, stop playing and keep shitposting.
---
Sure, or bait hunters by pretending to mine or rat.
---
Look on CCPs SoundCloud. They have a ton of Auras stuff on there. On a podcast I used to do I had a sound byte I pulled from there.
---
Its a good way to learn their weaknesses. It can be torturously boring though.
---
That's a quality post right there.
---
Nah, he got all the big alliances covered, PH is just alts of the ones he mentioned anyway.
---
Gotta admit, was just looking at my portfolio to see if I could move some into Netflix.
---
Do you take patients?
---
I would contend that the changes are actually good for the overall health of the game but, severely impact some playstyles.
---
you are not worthy, I apologize
---
Yeah I've checked there, you can find those ones [here](https://soundcloud.com/ccpgames/sets/aura)
---
I'll bet they still have sub-caps. Those still work.
---
Same here tbh, I make most of my isk trading and I don't need to undock for it. If there is a CTA and it's comfortably in my TZ, I get on it or whaling fleets which are more fun these days.
---
They are gonna get crushed by Disney's service I think
---
Holy shit, what happened to Netflix?
---
from just observations I would say more are spawning to null.   But that could be a perception thing.   Wormhole rolling seems to be a constant thing.    where before it would be every few hours.
---
&gt;[...] encourage people to go rat in a Myrm or mine in a Procurer for 1/3 the ISK they and I both know they could make flying with WTM in highsec.
---
Why not let them fly with WTM and then use the isk to do PvP? Would make more sense to me than forcing them to do something even more mindnumbing.
---
This doesn't mean that the try different things idea is bad. Just why push your guys to do something which is neither engaging nor profitable?
---
I don't know if I can trust CCP to actually understand what their changes will actually do
---
It was exactly what I expected.
---
Loved this one!  Here's your upvote you magnificent b@stard!
---
The old Aura voice for this was great, it's felt like she was bored with your shit.
---
Never play any online FPS game you gigantic pussy.
---
Gigx should of got a slap on the wrist for his offense but instead Goons and Legacy like the cancerous dickheads that they are. Metagame the fuck out of the situation and got him permo banned.
---
Ban incoming for out of eve threats lmao.
---
I murdered other players and scooped their loot for isk. 3 smartbomb Machs dumpstered for 1.8 bil a piece . 50 minutes of effort.
---
Rocky Horror on repeat for years.

we will be lucky if it gets a numbers tweak,  5 years from now.
---
Look up the crucible patch notes.
---
I'm not being a smart ass, I just don't remember and would have to look it up too.
---
nope an attentive rorq miner will sooner or later lose em to a cloaky.  You cant pull em in fast enough depending on what your mining.
---
It actually looks like the blackout save the day! the price collapsed until the blackout happened, then it rebounded for a couple days.
---
eve saved netflix for a few hours!!!
---
You really are mentally ill aren't you?
---
Watching this fight was like trying to see who is going to win 2nd to last place at the special olympics.
---
This is a high quality shitpost.  Take my updoot.
---
You could try to play Vonhole style: find a random dude on zkill that throws around blingy ships, study their habits, then bait/kill them.
---
How is eve not a PvP game?
---
 When you take sov from someone what is that considered? 
---
I’ll even entertain your idea that this game would survive without pvp. What in the actual fuck would there be to do? Mine, to make more ships that you in turn use to mine and rat more? Until you eventually tank the price of everything in the game that every ship is practically worthless? 
---
I think you misunderstand people who “hate pve” they don’t hate it. Is it not their thing? Sure. They hate that people can effectively PvE with impunity. For numerous amounts of reasons. Look at seven and tell me that’s healthy for the game. Shit not even just delve. Esoteria too. The game was on a downward spiral to being the same as serenity.
---
&gt;And all you are basing your numbers on is 1 website with 1 method.
---
the website with the most traffic, and the rate with the best isk/hr
---
&gt;And you are for instance completely forgetting that NS bots are around
---
hardly, and hardly effective
---
&gt; incursion bots level 3 missions, higher abyssal sites. I mean you can just as easily do t2 sites and get as much as VNI ratting right? Up to level 3 is rather easy.
---
you don't, your assumptions are wholly incorrect.
---
Basically the game was updated that made a few people angry that they can no longer AFK "play" the game. now we know what they liked to do in the meantime.
---
But it did eliminate almost all non umbrella mining.
---
Yeah but why bother?
---
Like ok cool I understand the perspective but the reality is no amount of telling people to go do different shit is going to ever make pvpers do industry or vice versa. 
---
Because why would you? What possible meaning or enjoyment are you going to get out of it unless you’re a masochist? Ships mean nothing, fights mean nothing, and finding those fights are next to impossible. I can log into any number of other games and immediately do things I want to do - versus increasingly trying to draw blood from a stone, trying to pull what few players remain committed to being outside blocs, who know they’ll literally be forced to do miserable joyless tasks just to keep their organization running.
---
Logistics has always been bad in EVE but everything that’s bad about it just gets amplified when you look around and ask why should you do it for a small group? What are you realistically going to accomplish? Are roams even fun anymore for the majority of players? Even if you solo pvp and still get the shakes, it bleeds off. For a game that sells its meaningful, butter fly effect uniqueness, nothing much changes between the 15th solo kill and the 100th. When that takes hold, why spend 3 hrs only to get blobbed when you could play something with a lot less TTK
---
The horizon of possibility in EVE has completely collapsed, and we all know it. 
---
I don’t want this to come across as bittervet muh playstyle, I literally still play and pvp, but this game used to have 60k players. At some point the community itself has to contend with the fact that attention spans are finite, and without EVE’s meaningful gameplay as a selling point it falls flat.
---
The games straight up boring, and without any sort of story lines, or leveling, or gear progression or whatever achievement structure you want to overlay it simply doesn’t have anything to justify the moment to moment insufferably tedious nature the core gameplay loop has.
---
Fun fact, the building that used to house SOE and run SWG was located in Mira Mesa, California, about two miles from where im sitting right this instant. I used to drive by it all the time.
---
It has been gutted and renovated into a biomedical facility.

Not even the building where its developers worked has survived SWGs demise.

The sooner you understand that the blackout is a bug made into a feature, the easier your eve life will be.

He sums up current null life pretty well imo

That would be awesome, a whole new crop of players to explore and conquer Null space again.  Finding remnants of long-dead empires.  Maybe a few odd-looking space statues of Bees, Pandas, Dinos, whatever PL 's symbol is, and such.   It would be glorious!

it is a matter of you can jump into a game and make some progress towards a goal vs what eve has become.    Shooting bad guys is always fun but you need isk to replace the stuff you lose.
---
Thanks, glad you liked it!
---
Reading your post hurts me.
---
Its not a straight PvP game is the point. 
---
I agree with what you say but people argue its only a PvP game all the time. Its not. The main elements in this game are PvE. PvP is just a method to aquire PvE elements, its always been that way, atleast in sov null (atleast from what I know). Thats why the game can survive without PvP but it cant survive without PvE. That makes it inherently a PvE game. Would it be worth playing without PvP? Fk no. But it would "survive".
---
I dont agree with the discussion about the health of the game. Were things broken? Sure. Was I one of the many that was arguing against those things? Yes. But overall the game was quite healthy, atleast going in a good direction. Changes were needed for sure, have been since the stupid Rorq got changed, but it was not unhealthy enough to warrant chemo. Many many other things should have been tried before using an approach like this.
---
My main point is this. Both are needed and PvE people are needed in much larger quantity than PvP people, maybe 80-20 or something like that. If you scare of the PvE people with your changes then its game over. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Could someone record a video with sound of them? I'm not currently playing the game but I'm curious

I would argue the exact opposite. This game needs more pvp and more reasons to fight over things. May that be better recourses or diminishing returns over time for living somewhere for so long. Not too long ago the game was all over the place. People constantly hot dropping and fighting and it worked just fine. 
---
Anytime you undock your ship in this game you are consenting to pvp. That’s the game. That’s why even high sec is a semi dangerous place.
---
Don't believe it, but still funny.
---
Its business. You only make as much as you need with a little buffer (compare it to milk). This is especially relevant for botters since when they get banned its not just 1 but entire networks right? And the money gets confiscated. So there is no real need to make more isk than you can actually sell just to see it being taken away after a short while. If bots never got banned then sure it makes sense to make as much as you can.
---
One thing I can agree with when it comes to bots is that the random guy who bots 1 or 2 chars will be effected just like everyone else in NS by these changes. But I doubt botting as a business has taken a hit. Just look at the highsec corps/alliances that went from 0 - several thousand "players" around the time of the blackout. All of which are located in HS and lose things while doing "bot like" activities.

They're also no longer unique. They've lost a lot of what they used to carry, and while original stuff helps make up for it, when everyone has original content it isn't as big of a draw.

Yeah they should add those changes too. I feel like they might if players just give them time.

You can also copy your settings from one character to the others :D it’s a pain in the balls but you only ever have do it once, then you have a permanent backup and all 20 clients will be identical.

In March there was 60t of mining. 13.5t was in hs/ls, 27t was in umbrella regions, 19.5t was in nonumbrella regions.
---
In August there was 28t of mining. 13.5t was in hisec, 7.5 in umbrella regions, 7t in nonumbrella nullsec.

So no, so far it seems like blackout affected the umbrella region mining more. Or at least it's a myth that it affected umbrellas way less.

---
&gt; Well that's just not universally true.
---
In &gt;90% of cases, it is true.  Gamers are not good at designing the trade-offs that are required for gameplay to be entertaining.
---
&gt; Mmm no, it is true.
---
No, the idea that the CSM is supposed to propose changes has never been true.  They've always been a focus group.
---
The mistaken believe that they are supposed to propose changes goes all the way back to the formation of the CSM.  Making your idea not particularly radical.
---
But hey, keep raging against reality.  I'm sure sometime reality will lose!
---
We are not arguing different things here tho. I 100% agree that we need more reasons to fight. The stagnation that is built into the game is based on us not actually needing to fight in NS. We still do it but its meh. But when the dust settles you need people to actually use the space for PvE. 
---
Its like in irl, you invade a country with a military but then you need to rebuild it to make use of its resources. But the army is built by resources and not the other way around.

&gt;In &gt;90% of cases, it is true. Gamers are not good at designing the trade-offs that are required for gameplay to be entertaining.
---
Again no, that's not true.
---
&gt;No, the idea that the CSM is supposed to propose changes has never been true. They've always been a focus group.

The only mistake here is that they dont do that and they SHOULD do that idf the CSM was designed properly...

Since you took your time to raise questions lets go along with them:
---
1) no May state Was Bad no point in arguing. But the way ccp redacted this made Things just significantly worse
---
2) also a no to this but yet again the way they changed it was the wrong one a approach to counter caps in subs would help but also in Such a way that you need more then the average 10 man small Gang Group to field it
---
3) local was fine as it was as it balanced the cloaks whom are now just way out of Balance. The Intel bots were a problem and this 8s something they should have worked on.
---
4) sry dont have an exact number but its the perk of a big Group.
---
5) about every Day i would get a Chance to fight someone in a Situation where i could actually win.
---
On the cynabal its easy. Refit to combat and prey He Lands in point range.
---
6) i hate roams deeply as i find em boring but yet again the only thing Blackout did Was enforcing the botters to use better tools
---
7) significantly longer then with what is done now.
---
Hard to predict numbers but the slope is visible and nobody said the game was fine before. Everything considerable raised was that the way this is done is bad for the Overall health of our playerbase and was done because its less effort then actually coding and balancing things that needed an Adress.
---
This Chaos era is just fighting sympthoms while the core issues are known but ignored and usually one would do this if either the issue wasnt known ( which is not the case here) or if the issue could not be cured ( also not the case )

I implied you didn't understand the implications of nullification et al, not that they were 'easy mode'.  
---
Most people want 'easy mode' at first, until theres nothing of substance left.  We have a perfect case study in WoW and WoW Classic to draw from.

Curious where you are currently play eve?

But why the cap rechargers??
---
What's the best structure for the solo WH life? I've seen a couple options floating around:
---
* Astrahus (most expensive, least vulnerable)
---
* Raitaru (cheap and replaceable, but pretty easy to take down)
---
* POS (middle ground on cost/security,  but less convenient and maybe going away?)
---
I'm kind of leaning towards a POS but I don't really know
---
We don't force anyone to do anything, I'm quite openly handing out links to Abyssal fits and Incursions, but my point is that the game mechanics put the needs of the alliance (ADMs etc) at odds with what's best for the line members, and those things should be in sync in a well-designed game.

Why is everyone stuck on this make null riskier kick? So, assume we’re successful in making 0.0 riskier, then what? People adapt, change how things are done, and we settle back into a new meta? Again, then what? Seems to me we’d be back in the same situation just down a level on the ladder?
---
The real issue, as some people have said, but with seemingly no good answer, is the general stagnation. We’re so focused on, “make it riskier, make it more dangerous”. If there’s nothing worth getting your ship destroyed over, then it only makes sense that those stacks of ships are gonna get bigger.
---
Maybe he should loosen up on the catch phrase of “make null dangerous again” and start putting more of our reeee effort into thinking up more and better conflict drivers.

Regarding Poland:
---
&gt;The historian Russel Hart writes that Guderian supported the invasion because he "despised the Catholic, Slavic Poles who now occupied parts of his native, beloved Prussia"... Guderian's corps withdrew before the SS began its ethnic cleansing campaign. He learned of murder operations and of Jews being forced into ghettos from his son, Heinz Günther Guderian, who had witnessed some of them. There is no record of his having made any protest.
---
Regarding Russia/Russians:
---
&gt;In Guderian's 1937 book Achtung — Panzer! he wrote that "the time has passed when the Russians had no instinct for technology" and that Germany would have to reckon "with the Eastern Question in a form more serious than ever before in history"...  By May 1941 Guderian had accepted Hitler's official position that Operation Barbarossa was a noble defensive preemptive strike. **He had accepted some core elements of National Socialism: the Lebensraum concept of territorial expansion and the destruction of the supposed Judeo-Bolshevik threat.**
---
&gt;The German formations on the Eastern Front ubiquitously implemented the criminal [Commissar Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissar_Order) and the [Barbarossa Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarossa_decree). For all divisions within Guderian's panzer group where files are preserved, there is evidence of illegal reprisals against the civilian population. **In his memoirs Guderian denied having been given the commissar order. However, commander Joachim Lemelsen of his panzer group is documented as saying "prisoners, who could be shown to have been commissars, had to be immediately taken aside and shot" – and that the order came direct from Guderian.** Reporting to the OKW, Guderian is documented as saying his panzer group had "shunted off" 170 commissars by the beginning of August.
---
Regarding the July 20 Plot:
---
&gt;**Hart argues that there is strong circumstantial evidence that Guderian supported it**: he had recommended Himmler appoint leading conspirator Claus von Stauffenberg to become the army's chief of staff which would have given him direct access to Hitler; he delayed the mobilization of vehicles which implicitly assisted the plot; and he unexpectedly retired to his estate on the day of the assassination attempt. **Hart writes that he was playing both sides; he was aware of the plot and implicitly assisted, but provided himself with an alibi by being on his estate should it fail.** He communicated with the conspirators through his deputy, Wolfgang Thomale, who was already part of the conspiracy. Guderian briefly fell under suspicion, however, the same day Hitler promoted him to Acting Chief of the General Staff. **Hart surmises had the plot succeeded then Guderian would have supported the new regime and demanded a significant promotion as reward for his assistance.**
---
#LITERAL WORDS HE SAID AFTER THE WAR
---
&gt;Even after the war, Guderian retained an affinity with Hitler and National Socialism. While interned by the Americans, his conversations were secretly taped. In one such recording, while conversing with former field marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and former general Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, Guderian opined: **"The fundamental principles [of Nazism] were fine".**

The ganking and stuff you enjoy would be fine if it was done in moderation or if the burden of being gank targets was distributed among a larger population of pve players, but CCP's design choices over the years have left us with a population that consists of far too many "hunters" and not nearly enough "prey". We need either less hunters, more prey, or hunters who are willing to be the prey half of the time.

My man, you didnt have inflation before, you had deflation. Prices had been going down for years, not up. You have inflation now, I see some items doubling in price. The economy is in a pretty horrific place atm but it takes months for the reserves to get depleted before the full reality of it sets in.
---
The idea behind more isk = more inflation is taken from reality but things are way different irl and it cant be applied copy-paste style. And what you are saying is exactly inflation, if in gets reduced and out gets upped that leads to inflation. Which is what we are seeing. Inflation goes down if you increase in and decrease out.

---
Being able to fucking teleport the most powerful ship in the game directly to the front lines makes all of the wars into a number competition. 
---
Pretty much anything that makes that harder, im in favor of.
---
Just because Guderian wasn't a card-carrying member of the NSDAP and only *JUST* happened to align his worldview with what they believed in doesn't mean he wasn't a Nazi. Believing in and furthering the racialized war of annihilation in the east, buying into the Judeo-Bolshevik mythos, actively encouraging war crimes, all that makes you a Nazi.

Prices going down on stuff like capitals because of the huge amount mined by rorqs, look at the plex price. There was/is inflation, eve's economy is incredibly alike to the real world economy. And what im saying is, the in flow of isk to the game being reduced will reduce inflation, because if theres less isk its worth more. Same for capitals theres more of them, so they drop in price.

Fair enough, this is a difference in definition. My definition of "Nazi" is similar to my definition of "Democrat" or "Tory": The member of a particular political party. Your definition is the member of a political ideology. I can see where disagreement can arise.

They were fighting a group that outnumbers them, they then added more numbers to  the other side, they aren't going to be outnumbered by "one more logi" They're going to be out numbered by another whole fleet, I don't mind dying, but going into a fight where you're literally fish in a barrel for the other guy to shoot isn't any fun.

PLEX is one item man (and even here its kinda complicated because PLEX is dictated by the price of SP, CCP giving SP away will lower its price due to skillfarms being less worth). You cant base the entire inflation/deflation argument on 1 item. T1 stuff went down due to rorqs. T2 stuff is different and went up because of lifeblood patch but its stayed fairly regular and thats based on the fact that its not an infinite resource/timeperiod. DED loot was down. PLEX was up.
---
If you use a basket, as you do irl, you will notice that you had deflation before but have inflation now. Not the other way around.
---
Its really not though. Irl you have a financial sector. The irl theories are based on the existence of that sector. Like the theory of less isk = less inflation is actually not like that. Those 2 points are beginning and end in a long chain of events that have to be filled step by step for it to be true. And the financial sector is key via interest rates. This is in a perfect theory world even, irl the old economic theories are proven to not work anymore in the same sense. Which is why many if not most countries still have negative interest rates (almost a decade) to jumpstart the economy. Its not working as the theories predict it tho.
---
And Im saying its based on irl economic theory and its not correct. It will not reduce inflation outside of PLEX and expensive niche items like AT ships and stuff (and barely even here honestly). What you will have though is less people farming which means less stuff coming into the economy which means demand will be higher than supply which means inflation. This will be curbed by the fact that people are leaving the game so demand is dropping rapidly. 
---
I cant tell you how its gonna end up because its too many variables and Im not gonna do a deeper analysis. But I can tell you that isk is not worth more today than 2 months ago (with the exception of firesales). You can see this yourself, pick out a basket of things and compare the price of the basket with pre-blackout prices. Thats inflation. 
---
Trust me, the economy is not healthy at all. It was much more healthy before all of this. People keep talking about faucets and stuff but there isnt really any real disadvantage to it ingame. I dont personally like it and I dont like the mineral supply overflow but those things didnt actually hurt the economy, it made it better quite frankly. They needed balancing tho because deflation isnt good either.
---
Dont necessarily need to krab, could join an empire and just do larger fleets or bait hunters. It's just to get a feel for what "the other side" do.
---
Yeah I can agree with the later half of what you wrote, but personally if you are advancing the aims of a regime that wants to exterminate tens of millions of people, you're either willfully blind or a dupe, and I'm not sure which is worse

imo we need a rebalance of (nullsec) PvE where active subcap ratting pays more than it does now, supercap ratting pays less than it does now, and Rorquals are boost ships again. 
---
This will bring out more 'prey' as the reward matches the risk they're taking.
---
Good day to you, sir.
---
It so happens that I find your unique outlook on life to be the most mature, intelligent, and insightful philosophy I have witnessed in many a year! Would you, perchance, happen to write a newsletter to which I might subscribe?
---
It should be spelled Eev.
---
That's pretty fucked considering considering the price before rorquals online.
---
This is a ridiculous argument. CCP made skill injectors. CCP made the Rorqual OP.  CCP created the Black Out. CCP give us the tools and we play within the universe that CCP created. Blaming the player is like blaming a child for being born.
---
Just leave it on a can by the sun.
---
Ironically this same argument is why the PCU numbers don't bother me in the slightest
---
Normally the premise is that the lady grabs the keys, and finds the driver of the car and goes back with him.
---
Drekavik can solo it, but sometimes the third wave is too much and you need to bounce out, repair, and go back.
---
The "PVE vs PVP" argument is completely retarded and is a "them vs us" classic propaganda being put into nullsec megablock's koolaid supplies.
---
Change my mind.
---
P.S. I'm a PVPer, of my six characters (two accounts since a good couple of years, a single one for far longer) I only use my main for that and sometimes another character. My other four and the fifth most of the time are dedicated to PVE activities.
---
Why can't you find anyone to fight you?

LMFAO

Wierd that people complain so much about not being able to avoid pvp on the server with 500 people but then complain that the server with 20,000 people is devoid of life....

But Incarna got the most press!

One issue with the simulated systems thing like you propose is the hard disconnect once you join the real game.

Disney owns hulu, they will offer a discounted bundle. So you'll keep hulu.

If you *truly* think the game is just now having issues you're legitimately drinking the kool-aid. It's having problems, but these are problems that have been festering for years.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
Just goes to show you that if people actually wanted to pvp they could easily find a way.
---
That sounds about right.
---
I'd add to that that a suggestion that they reduce the effectiveness of multiboxing miners; doing so would increase the overall value of ores and make smaller-scale mining more profitable.
---
Perhaps making fleet/wing/squad warp not work for mining ships would help? That way the more miners an individual player runs at once, the harder it is for that player to save his ships from ganks. Those who get the largest portions of the ore also pay the largest portions of the blood tithe to hunters - hunters would be less inclined to harass small-scale mining operations when the larger-scale ones are more likely to feed them kills.
---
You'd still get more overall profit with more mining accounts, but with diminishing returns due to account #N+1 having more overhead than account #N due to more frequent ship losses.

Really the problem is that it was pitched as a walking-in-stations MMO. Millions of dollars and years of development time went into it. Ultimately what we got was walking in closets. If you left it on it would overheat your video card. If you turned it off, they quite literally showed you the door.
---
Close, but here's the bit you're missing:
---
EVE is a game with a very heavy focus on Player vs Player. There are things you can do vs the environment, but fighting other people is a big part of the game. This is especially true in "Null Sec", the areas of space with no law beyond that which the players themselves enforce - Null Security, see?
---
Previously you could at least tell who was in the same system as you in Null Sec space, because if someone else jumped in they'd be added to the "Local" chat channel - so people could just sit in a system, watching their chat channel for anyone else showing up, and could then react once they did (either to try and blow said people up, or to run the heck away before they get blown up).
---
The "Blackout" in question is a communications blackout, it causes the local channel in null-sec systems to not list who is in the system anymore. This prevents people from paying so little attention, thus less AFK gameplay. Gotta play more actively to track people down - or to be able to tell that someone is tracking you down.
---
wtf he didnt even send it to antsintheeye johnsen the true mastermind in his fucking op  garmur kitey pussy ship
---
I think it's a bit more complicated than that. It's usually a case of "i gave these guys somethig overpowered, so then i have to give the other guys something equally overpowered to keep it balanced on average".
---
The problem with this method is that you get a lot of power creep (i came back to the game to find at least 5 new ship classes that didn't exist when i stopped, maybe more) and two equally overpowered mechanics that are supposed to counter each other in a specific case. But players will not only use these features in those exact conditions, they will use them in all situations, so then all semblance of balance goes out the window.
---
Hunting is easy mode because half the players use cloaky and/or nullified stuff to pick and choose engagements. And they use that stuff because the other half are the kind of nerds who will drop a Hel on 3 guys roaming in Navy Omens, instead of undocking a few nano cruisers of their own to chase them off and have some fun. It's two sides of the same coin and one feeds into each other in a vicious circle. Whenever a part of the player base comes up with a cancerous use of a specific asset, another one will find an equally cancerous counter, it's all there is to it really.
---
Now if people had enough reasons (depends on game mechanics/incentives) and willingness (this is completely player dependent) to use more varied compositions instead of dropping caps on frigates and bombers on barges all day long, maybe we could get a bit more variety.
---
But I can't scan for them with probes right? And NPCs miner?
---
I understand that you feel that you need to justify your position.
---
There was 98.5 trillion in ISK faucets in Aug 2019.  
---
8.1 trillion came from Delve  
---
13.6 trillion came from Wormholes
---
I've been there done that. The only thing I haven't ever done in eve is mine... And that will really kill eve for me if force myself to do it.
---
Full tank fit (DCU + bulkheads | full shield mids | 2 shield command links and salvagers in high). 
---
RF Valkyries for kikis and Zorya ships and then switch to Warrior IIs for the frigates. If you are tanking well but lack DPS, you can:
---
 * swap a mid slot for a web because enemies orbit &lt;10km
---
 * swap reinforced bulkheads with drone damage amplifier - in case you are confident shields and armor will hold, the module does nothing. if you get ganked, on the other hand..
---
Have MWD on hand to move between sites faster. MTU and Mobile Depot in cargohold.
---
Shield can drop very low or be eaten by the end of the event, really depends on the number of spawns. Consider carrying a Shield Booster to replenish.
---
Capacitor isn't really an issue.
---
So what?
---
Well, i'm not the one who responds with ad hominem one liners because he can't formulate a counter-argument.

Oh snap, i just did, it's dragging me down to it's level :/
---
Seriously though, good guy, bad guy. Choose one. You can't pull off the big baddie persona when you have your line members (and some high profile ones like yourself) giving us sob stories in here every day. You could institute a r/eve posting ban similar to the supercap ratting ban actually, that would benefit all involved parties greatly. You get to save some face and we can maybe go a day without a "PCU is falling" thread.
---
Have a nice afternoon sir.
---
Is this saving or spending time? I feel like it’s definitely unnecessary expenditure of time
---
&gt;...do you have a suggestion for a replacement revenue stream for CCP?
---
Investing in salt futures should more than cover the losses.
---
There are almost certainly less people living in wormholes but they are making way more isk. All while complaining that nullsec is making to much isk.
---
Fraternity literally kicked PLA from Pando live during their coalition meeting and then called them race traitors lmao.
---
I don't think they'll offer ad-free hulu with that bundle unfortunately.
---
Sorry :(, what I mean is, if a ship needs to be doing 100m/s towards the warp target but is actually doing 150m/s speed but at a 45 degree angle towards to warp target so it's velocity towards the warp target is actually about 106/s so the required velocity towards the target is met, but not the 95% align. What would the delta-v "progress bar" say at this point?
---
Experts: Blackouts hurt the poor and disadvantaged. Source: CCP to announce new stimulus plan of High-Sec skill injector farming and additional glycerine-based lubricants.
---
excel online
---
second excelacy
---
excel dangerous.
---
But they have so much risk making isk in a worm hole!
---
Is that like a talking point I see it thrown around a lot. Did someone tell you CCP hates you for your ISK?
---
i would have believed "i just like playing the game"... because a lot of people really are that simple, and could enjoy this trashcan of a game.  but no, that's not what you said... you went on about some dumb ass wishy washy "im creating unique STORIES.. that cant be produced anywhere else"bullshit..  so no, not giving you a pass on this one. you concocted that statement to impress me or whoever is reading this, who knows why, maybe you are sheltered and dont often have people calling on your bullshit. a complete load of masturbatory reassurance, that's all it is. not impressed.
---
This is some of the best flair baiting I’ve ever seen
---
I sugest looking into the MER... both insmother and detorid have more npc bountys then esoteria and are 2nd and 3rd. Winter coalition has a super cap umbrella in cn time zone
---
Because no pvper has ever had any industry/trading/moneymaking alts, or any dedicated alts on top of the previous ones for cynos, scouting, interceptors and tackling, cov ops, logi, and the list goes on and on and on.
---
Just because it might be hard for you to multibox 3 rorquals doesn't mean a high activity player can't multibox 2-3 pvp characters, especially if 1-2 are in ships that are harder to simply alpha off the field. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, i'm just saying different people have different activity levels in how they play games.
---
Best content has always come from sides hating each other. If we’re all warm and fuzzy to each other, why would you want to invade? Dehumanizing the enemy is a tactic used by pretty much any military and has been used in eve (see: propaganda). People are afraid to really say anything for fear of being banned like gigx.
---
Remember mittens’ “incident”? Wasnt banned.
---
&gt;The group that worries me particularly is subcap linemembers
---
Yeah that's the real kicker that I have been trying to figure out, it's pretty hard to both have risk for capitals but have less for subcaps.  I liked the NSA change but the use of regular sebos to counteract it kind of made that not as impactful.  Even with it carriers/supers weren't really in enough danger compared to myrms/vnis.
---
Alphas make more isk in highsec then omegas in null. Yes that’s obvious. I know all of goonswarm is moving to highsec to start the great goon/hs war. I know you all have been on the trail going to hs for several months now and expect to reach jita soon. 
---
You are a world class shitbag. I get you want to make some dramatic over the top statement how null is getting fucked by blackout and cyno. But now your just being a drama queen.
---
&gt; There are almost certainly less people living in wormholes but they are making way more isk.
---
I see this speculation a lot, and would love to see some actual number to back this up.  Until then it’s conjecture.
---
Yes please!
---
Rorquals *used* to be for logistics. Now they're the iWin button for mining.
---
Nope nope nope. The whole reason for the Cyno changes was to make it harder to keep your ISK printers alive.
---
i never said they were gone
---
Nullified ceptors are the other end of the spectrum of problems that also includes Ansiblex gates and cynos. If it's too easy and safe to move stuff around, or if you don't have to gate at all any more, you take away all the opportunities to start fights by intercepting those movements.
---
My own proposal is taking the bulk of subcap farming behind acceleration gates. They are the mechanic that'd select against caps, for subcaps.
---
It needs devtime though.
---
Of course they have, but now that festering has lead to necrosis.
---
Look at your link again.
---
Seems turning-off 64-bit fixes it.
---
It would be off. because it isn't doing 106m/s towards the target, it's doing 150m/s 45 degrees from the target.
---
In this, it's fairly simple, to move a velocity vector 45 degrees in the most efficient manner, you would apply a delta v matching the current velocity at a 90 degree angle to the current vector (on the same plane and in the direction of the target vector).
---
So at that point, the delta-v to get to perfectly aligned would be 150m/s.
---
If that was the start of the alignment, then it would be at zero.
---
And as force is applied. is applied in that direction, it would go across the screen to aligned at 100%
---
This is slightly complicated by factoring in a ships maximum speed, but can be accounted for by adding in an additional friction force vector for simple math.
---
You're thinking of this in one-dimensional space.
---
The EVE physics (where force can theoretically be applied at any angle) would allow this whole thing to be simplified to a 2 dimensional space (with the z being marginalized by having this 2d plan intersect the current vector and the target vector).
---
removing local removes near2 intelligence which is the main method to safely afk in a pocket
---

---
&gt; "im creating unique STORIES.. that cant be produced anywhere else"bullshit
---
Sure, name one game where I can fly around in a cloaky mining ship and drop an energy neutralizing battleship on another player.
---
I want that game.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
You are kidding right?
---
I just came back after years being gone (life went down the tubes) and now I'm in a carrier, in nullsec, without an alliance and no safe harbor. What do I do?
---
It's true ! I used to dig and watch soap operas ....
---
True, if you have no supply lines to interdict, you are restricted to playing "medieval siege in space with teleporting armies". Everyone on a single grid around a citadel (aka castle), with a bunch of siege engines (capitals) around and the rest of the ships are all groups of the exact same type and fit, moving around anchored (like a medieval formation of footsoldiers)
---
It would be much more interesting if we could play "blitzkrieg in space" instead, with the same amount of players but spread out across a constellation or even region hunting and choking off supply lines and movement, instead of having to endure a blob fest at 1% TiDi on the same grid with everyone else.
---
I actually have been enjoying pi but i have it set for 7 day cycles instead of the optimal 2.5 and don't bother doing pi out of system on any character. I feel like a lord of my peasants slaving away planet side
---
summary?
---
The blackout affected bots less than it affected non-bot ratting.
---
First, a legitimate ratter is trading time for isk; if he's not getting enough isk for his time, he won't continue to rat. A bot, on the other hand, is providing "free" isk for its owner and is worth running as long as it continues to generate any profit. By the time botting stops being worthwhile, most legitimate players will have stopped ratting long ago.
---
Second, dying isn't fun for real people, especially when there's nothing you can do about it - few people enjoy either losing or being helpless. A bot doesn't care how many times it dies; all that matters for its owner is that it generates more isk than it loses.
---
Third, bots don't care about their killboard stats, since botting is typically done on throwaway accounts that are going to be banned eventually anyways. Most real people aren't willing to tank their isk/hour by doing their blackout ratting on a throwaway alpha account, so they have to watch their killboard stats take a dive simply because they needed isk.
---
If bots were running in certain regions before the blackout, they're probably still running there now. It's the non-botting ratters that were hurt the most.
---
/r/wallstreetbets
---
Damn simple. Good idea
---
This is an in accurate comparison. You are comparing all of Wormhole Space to 1 region of null. The majority of money in wormhole space comes from c5 and c6 farms and those anomalies are not infinitely respawnable or infinitely farmable.
---
There are 2600 wormhole systems included Shattered which are non-inhabitable. Meanwhile there are 97 systems in Delve.
---
Basic math concludes 5.1 billion isk per system average for wormholes and 83.5 billion isk per system average for Delve.
---
Conclusion: Comparing apples to oranges is not an accurate portrayal of data. This would be comparable to comparing all of High Sec to Delve.
---
&gt; The blackout affected bots less than it affected non-bot ratting.
---
I don't think this is true tbf.
---
Firstly it reduced bounties everywhere overall. But the reduction affected bots the most, subcap ratters in umbrella regions the second, all ratters in accesssible regions (e.g. Provi) the third. However, medium range alliances (e.g. Winterco)  or semi-organized people living in distant regions increased their bounty share.

It might not be ad-free, but you get National Geographic, Disney and eventually all the shows Fox ever made, think of all those shows that got cancelled too early lol
---
Rorquals are still used for logistics
---
sure.
---
Just remove the drone bay.
---
Yeah I like the idea of acceleration gates, it would also reserve certain sites just for subcap usage.
---
Can anyone recommend a T1 Myrmidon fit I can use for some L2 maybe L3 ratting? I will be partnering with a T1  Shield tanked Drake. Thanks!
---
He did.a great job don't so
---
that is a mechanism of the game. the story would be you ambushed your target with superior intel and gear. oooooo what a unique story that no way could be replicated in any other way shape or form anywhere else but eve
---
But it also drastically increases their safety against everything except the unscannable recons.
---
Of course, as you've shown with blops ded runners, people can be horribly stupid and die even when the odds are in there favors, this is a limitation.
---
But then, on the other hand, gates would reduce the impact of covert hot drops in these instances as now you would need an initial tackle and a seperate cyno, which could be good.
---
That's NOT a reason to roll back the blackout or cyno changes, but a reason to make ratting more dangerous in wormholes; and it's an easy solution- delay when incoming wormholes appear.
---
\*cough\* Mitanni
---
I just love it when people insist a lot on conjecture and try to present it as fact, and then some guy comes and slaps a fat bag of math across their face.
---
Hit them with science dude. They will still deny it (without even going to the trouble of coming up with any numbers to oppose it), but keep hitting them with it.
---
I think there are fair methods to hunt targets behind acceleration gates. Bring in lachesis'. Rely on carelessness (no dscan spam). Bubble traps. Or CCP can add moderate warp disruption inside.
---
Where is the wormhole breakdown?
---
It is false that no matter what CCP does it will end up benefiting large alliances.
---
All of WH space (2500 systems) farmed 12T in July. Here is the math
---
12t / 2500 systems = 4.8bil per system 31 days in July so an average of **154mil isk per day**. Now split that up between a 10 person Corp.
---
154mil/isk per day is poverty compared to the “dank tics” I hear people make in null sec.
---
Delve alone mined **1.9bil per day per system** and had **1.55bil per day per system in bounties**. That 3.45bil/system doesn’t include salvage and loot drops.
---
Solid DD
---
Yes, when you simplify the store to that little, the story is "I sat at a computer and clicked a button".
---
So you both don't understand what you're reading and don't understand what you're saying.
---
Mining is something I always assumed I'd hate, but it's actually pretty relaxing gameplay if you're just looking to chill out and play at a slow pace. I prefer it to ratting tbh.
---
That's pre Panfam eviction btw.
---
As if there's enough people playing Eve to bother Netflix.
---
What would it take for a Corp to destroy jita? Reset the economy.
---
We're all weaponized autists, they just look like they have it together for show.
---
I think you could actually solve multibox mining in other ways, just making it slightly more interactive. Smaller rocks meaning you have to switch more often, stuff like that.
---
Nah, made private temporarily because of the SEC
---
I wasnt gonna say it...but yeah
---
Fire Coalition
---
Yeah plenty of ways to do it in LS and there is LS + no bubbles.
---
I didn't say it was, but I will say maybe should focus on the area making more per player.
---
Yea i doubled checked and saw the change
---
I think I'm OK with subcaps being significantly safer than capitals. There are good methods to hunt behind acceleration gates to keep hunters busy. And it's certainly better than the status quo wrt subcap ratting, because currently almost nobody is anom ratting anymore.
---
We could probably compare per player and make it look even worse if the numbers existed. Unfortunately chaos Era is code for fuck with nullsec there by buffing wormholes.
---
Hidden, because CCP.  But you can derrive it since it is the only part missing. 1-(sum of the rest) = WH
---
Olmeca, did you ever play in a big nullsec bloc alliance?
---
Not a spreadsheet expert but your umbrella totals for mining point to mining on the mer blocks bs3 thru bs28  but that encompasses a period from jul 2017 to jun 2019 wouldn’t it just make more sense to look at the month before and after blackout or am I looking at this wrong
---
You made me laugh mate, so true
---
I think it's a bit too early to tell. You lumped in the cyno changes but they are literally two days old and there's no actual data.
---
Making null more dangerous means you make less money and people cheering this will fix the economy, except you still have wormholers making way more per person and nearly 80% of all nullsec.
---
LMFAO 
---
  no.
---
You are on the way to destruction.
---
You have no chance to survive make your time.
---
Haha not at all.
---
We cannot see what WH space mined.  It could easily be in the trillions as well.  Do you really want to base your argument on data you don't have that might also prove you wrong?
---
My hopes are that with the Pearl Abyss acquisition they would licence out the EVE universe to make books, movies, and  TV series someday
---
How many people are in goons amd then even pretend wormholes have a fraction of that. It's informed conjecture.
---
&gt; The developers must have removed elements where players could "play" the game but be AFK. So imagine starting the game to progress, but you've left the house and went to work while the game plays itself.
---
Nobody really played the game like that. There were/are a few people who use bots (automated programs) to play Eve for them. But that is a ban-able offense and only done by a tiny minority.
---
Everyone in Eve has to earn isk one way or another to buy stuff so they can go fight and watch explosions. One way to earn isk is to killing NPCs. It is a very boring thing to do. So people try to spend as little effort on it as possible. Normal persons already have a job in real life. Nobody wants a second, more boring job in a game. So they rat (kill NPCs) with the help of AI controlled weapons (in this case drones which is a game mechanic of Eve).
---
The patch changed nothing about that. Instead it hides the presence of other players, who are looking for non-consensual "pvp" (they really just look for easy kills). So now you will lose a lot of ships while trying to earn in game credits if you don't pay full attention to the most boring thing you could do in the game. Of course most sane people have no will to put up with that.
---
Sorry, but that orca fit has prob like 300k ehp,  no where near 800k... no damage control, not fit for max tank in mids, but like... why lie about the ehp?
---
I think it's pretty safe to say if even blackout was anti-Malcanis, cyno changes will definitely be anti-Malcanis.
---
I do admit that there needs to be more time to wait and see how large alliances adjust to things. Particularly Sep MERs will be weird with complete bans on capital ratting.
---
Yes. I have ratting alts in 3 main power blocs.
---
The poor oppressed  "little guy" in null is a fiction propped up by people with the most to lose, the same people that are often the oppressor. The same people who right now, this second, are having more firesales and cheap caps being dumped on their markets than ever.
---
Must be a wormholer.
---
It's not fair that the entirety of wormhole space made more isk divided up between the 1000s of corporations living there than a single null region with only one alliance living there.
---
happy to see some BS combat that isnt those boring ass trig ships
---
your story is simple, no matter how bad you are at describing something. wow you used a decoy to lure an attacker into engaging an ambush... like seriously... that was the best you can come up with? this game is broken, the head developer has admitted this through his actions, and you want to drone on to me about shit i can read in any basic military tactics field manual? GIVE ME A BREAK, stop jerking yourself off
---
Glad i could provide some laughs today.  Cheers !
---
you must be fun to bring to parties.........
---
What about bots just migrating to hi sec as a counter to the "insecurity" caused by the blackout.
---
Statistics aren't about making it look good or bad. Their about finding patterns. But you only find accurate patterns with good methodology. Your methodology comparing Delve income to Wormhole income is poor and yields inaccurate patterns. 
---
On a side note, there are likely far less players living in wormhole space than in delve.
---
a combination of other streaming services and the EVE blackout
---
I assume you imagine this acceleration-gated content will be more formidable than your standard AFK-VNI ratting, otherwise aren't you essentially back at square one, but now with (arguably) safer bots?
---
Rorquals are also used for combat so no.
---
You're working under the assumption that bots still operate in nullsec. They don't. They have moved to highsec now, en'masse.
---
malcanis' law only applies groups similar to eachother, ie a large alliance with good players versus a large alliance with shit players
---
that law doesn't apply from large vs small alliances
---
Constant ganking 24/7 for months upon months on a scale that even the most organized events in Eve's history have yet to achieve, by far.
---
wormhole ore anoms do not respawn, also only shattered holes have ice and you cannot anchor anything in those holes.
---
Could you break down the amount of players in umbrella and non-umbrella regions by any chance?
---
REDIRECT
---
What the fuck does an eve player know about parties?
---
I'd say since we are looking at percentage shares of farming across different space, the longer period we look at, the more accurate the data gets. In fact, some recent pre-blackout months the data gets non-representative due to the Panfam eviction. 
---
So it's better if we take all the available MER history. It's just blackout hasn't been out for so long, so we just have to look at the 2 months there. That's why I admit perhaps we need more time for large alliances to adjust and increase their shares a bit. But at least initially, we can say blackout wasn't Malcanis-adhering.
---
What do you even play video games for then?
---
Why are you here?
---
So you are pushing a false narrative without data to back it up by including cyno changes in your conclusion.
---
I think a buff to ratting payouts to compensate for the loss of local and cynos would be more than acceptable, like a 25-40% increase in payout across the board.

The problem was too many capitals and supers and titans in null, combined with every null bear dropping a carrier even on solo frigates.
---
Problem is now solved- Eve has been saved. 
---
I'm a wormholer and I do want them to make ratting more dangerous because then I get to have more kills in whs too.
---
But it's stupid to think whs need a nerf the way null did
---
You obviously have never been to EVE Vegas or any other EVE meet.
---
Ccp refused to include it so people had to do the math to figure it out. Odd how that happened.
---
I bet more people live in delve than all of wspace. Hard knocks famously claimed to only be 50 people.
---
I have to agree Less and Less FCs are taking up the mantle of Alliance CEOs which incase leads to stagnation. A lot of alliances leaderships only go to war when everyone complains enough which I think is a good chunk of what's wrong with eve.
---
Eve has sound?
---
At least we can agree on your fibal point. Many people in this thread are treating it as if per capita delve makes more.
---
Ok so if you change the spreadsheet to look at income for the two months prior to black out rather than for years back it changes quite a bit 
---
Umbrella mining gos from making 27% of mining up to 52%
---
Non umbrella from 38 down to 12% 
---
Ratting not so much effected which surprised me 
---
Umbrella 33% up to 34% 
---
Non umbrella 60 down to 51
---
But that’s percents the volumes are all over as you see more mining now than before blackout in umbrella probably because of goon deployment prior to blackout but who knows I need someone stronger with spreadsheet to double check this
---
Why do you think it affected bots the most?
---
Everyone keeps talking about how the blackout killed botting, but it seems to me that it would affect legitimate ratting more. In addition to the reasons I listed earlier, it also becomes more difficult to identify and report bots with the blackout active.
---
If you reverse your assumption that bots were affected more than legitimate ratters, your numbers paint a different picture: it's easier to get away with botting in less-densely-populated areas (this is even more true than it was pre-blackout), so areas for which botting was a larger portion of their pre-blackout income suffered lower overall income drops even if legitimate ratting dropped more than in umbrella regions.
---
The less-populated areas might even have seen INCREASES in botting activity - the chances of being recognized and reported as a bot in a high population system aren't really any lower than pre-blackout, while bots in a low-population area are even harder to find and identify. It's likely that many bots moved to lower-population areas where players have little chance of even seeing them, let alone recognizing them as bots.
---
Pre-blackout they had all the time upon someone entering local to getting tackled. Post-blackout, even with gates, they only have time between someone landing on grid and tackling them.
---
Moreover, they can be easily tackled at the acceleration gates when they "reset" without the old version of local.
---
i see we have moved from armchair devs to armchair data analysts
---
Again, this is inaccurate. Only a very few wormholers make large quantities of isk via c5 and c6 wormholes. Most null sec players will makes more isk per hour than wormholers will.
---
Thats great, but that isnt what I said. I have never said it. Show me one fking place where Ive said this shit.
---
I have said that botting as a whole hasnt vanished, its just changed. If anything we have more bots in the game today than before blackout. But not in NS.
---
Dude, dont put fking words in my mouth than say Im an idiot because of it.
---
&gt;My own proposal is taking the bulk of subcap farming behind acceleration gates. They are the mechanic that'd select against caps, against bots, yet for subcaps.
---
I'd rather not add in more accel gates, they're a cancer.
---
Your sheets looking at income over years rather than before and after the actual change....
---
Why not, they make way more money. And why are you entitled to a good fight? If this was wow it would be like level 20s crying about level 60s killing them and wanting Blizzard to stop it. Some how the elite pvpers have become more risk averse than low level players in wow. If goons want to drop a Titan on everything then so be it. Maybe don't go where supers get dropped on you. And if that's the only place you find content then maybe do something else like reddit keeps screeching at those unhappy with the change.
---
&gt; PS2: Some will problematize how I don't categorize regions of FRT, GOTG or some other people who still try to save their ratters as "umbrella" regions. I don't, because they aren't really the "large alliances" whose disadvantage from blackout we are interested in. Their regions aren't the ones people (and us hunters) complain the most about, or generate the most MER activity. 
---
And that's a big flaw in your data. Frat space, where I hunt, has an active umbrella and our guys do have to plan around counter-drops. When I was hunting in GotG space it was the same, though not to the same degree.
---
Gorgeous dog.
---
Sweet Jesus I was joking. Lighten up.
---
Exactly what is he showing? That the RMT sites are still up and running which is exactly what Im saying, botting isnt gone?
---
Thanks for specifying your criteria
---
I have been playing long enough I appear to be one of the few left who truly understands how sigs spawn and what they do.
---
&gt; On a side note, there are likely far less players living in wormhole space than in delve.
---
That's what he's saying.  If you were to look at the per capita earnings of wormholers vs Delve residents, the numbers would skew heavily towards the wormholers and look even "worse".
---
That's not even true either. Only high end super ratting compares and you can only support so many supers. Bonus irony the people hurt most by blackout are the ones not making massive piles of isk.
---
I just watch a movie or play fun games
---
Yeah, that's fair. I was just throwing something out there - it's the end that matters here; I'm not committed to one particular means of accomplishing it.
---
I remember someone mentioning giving excavators fighter-like mechanics, which wasn't a bad idea, though that would clash with returning Rorqs to boosters rather than miners. It wouldn't do much good to make that one ship more interactive when the majority of the fleet is once again comprised of exhumers.
---
So you looked at certain regions over a 2 year period that were considered "umbrella regions" ie Tenal, then stripped them of that title and looked at them for 2 months as non-umbrella regions, and then posted these stats? How the hell are you trying to claim that FRT space is not an umbrella region when they literally defend their stuff the same way as the umbrella regions?  
---
This is why people don't believe your "data" everytime you post it; you change things around and then say "trust me it's the same".
---
Fair enough.. I'll just miss the each ganks
---
Nullbear, highbear and wormholer btw.
---
He's literally making shit up and presenting it as fact, and attaching a mod flair trying to make it seem official. His methodology is questionable at best.
---
&gt;PS2: Some will problematize how I don't categorize regions of FRT, GOTG or some other people who still try to save their ratters as "umbrella" regions. I don't, because they aren't really the "large alliances" whose disadvantage from blackout we are interested in. Their regions aren't the ones people (and us hunters) complain the most about, or generate the most MER activity.
---
FRT has a supercap umbrella a pretty decent one that actively try to discourage roamers and droppers. I would consider them relevant to this
---
Look at this one:
---
https://i.imgur.com/4SV8cpB.png
---
WH space so dangerous, a single guy can cause 1/3 of all WH destruction
---
Ultimately the numbers mean not a whole lot without population figures. What you can figure though is the amount of isk generated per total system. Because there are fixed numbers of both wormhole systems and systems in delve.
---
Are you that bored to have to shit post in every thread. If you're so unhappy with the game leave. If you're so unhappy with life, maybe its time you grew up? 
---
I'll be blocking you, so farewell. One less shit talker on Reddit is a win for me.
---
&gt;The blackout affected bots less than it affected non-bot ratting.
---
absolutely false, nullsec botting is almost non-existent
---
&gt;If bots were running in certain regions before the blackout, they're probably still running there now. It's the non-botting ratters that were hurt the most.
---
they aren't.
---
e
---
congratulations you've cut bot profits down by two thirds
---
I live in a c2 with a c5 static. I also lived in a c3 solo for over a year. I have always made more money on a regular basis from my VNI alt in Horde ratting and running escalations. I consistently would get higher isk per hour than I was ever making in the c3 or running c5 sites in rattles. I can say with confidence that my opinion is formed off concrete evidence and data collected over an extended period of about 5 years in both areas at the same time.
---
Nah his numbers compare almost two years of data prior to the change against the month after. 
---
If you compare one or two months before vs after you get a different story. You can look at data how you want to justify what you want to say
---
no asset safety in WH's.  Everything drops and often its easier to just shoot all the ships than try and get things out.    
---
Bottom line - WH space is farmed by players from ALL systems.  NS/HS/LS all farm wormholes for isk.  Most of the people that farm wormholes DO NOT LIVE in them... i know this because those are the people i hunt.    
---
Your points are invalid, go back to rorqual mining
---
The compare all of null to all of wspace. I am sure even you can't pretend there are more people in wspace than null space.
---
Why does this post have a mod flair? Is it some sort of official subreddit stance on the blackout change?
---
\*draws katana\*
---
I've played 12 years mostly in highsec and have been ganked 0 times. Take a little care and pay a little attention and it's very likely no one will bother with ganking you.
---
Yess, tell me about those guys who live in nullsec farming c5s with hobo dreads?
---
Or those high sec dudes who roll c6's?
---
Or those dudes who run c1's? lol
---
Is c2 space used for anything other than a pvp highway?
---
C4? Anyone home?
---
This is obviously a broad and general analysis of 'RAW' data  that has many details and circumstances that are still not considered. Break down the regions more specifically and its not as obvious as it first appears. Firstly goons for instance are still going ok with a vast majority doing ok if they persisted in their ISK making ventures. Branch on the other hand has been hit very hard. 
---
Other assumptions can also be made. 1) Is botting really gone? Botting operates best in low density environments and these are mostly not under umbrella's. 2) The numbers of players in game now are of course going to lead to less ISK being made and for me tells me the real reason for changes in reductions of the data.
---
Data can be interpreted very differently depending on what a narrator wants to conclude. We see this in politics regularly. I do find it interesting that Olmeca now seems to be running CCP and that changes being implemented are there to impact larger entities. Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe players like being part of larger entities or that their potential demise might see an end to the game? People are looking at this from a narrow perspective that benefits themselves and their way of thinking and not the game.
---
We should ask judge
---
I hope this is a copy pasta
---
The npc's were killed because of the gate jumps and couldn't use cynos to save themselves?
---
You mean then compare? Again tho we don't know how many people are in null or wspace so we can't actually make that comparison.
---
Do the PIER REVIEW if you want....but the numbers don't lie...less ppl making isk, less ppl loggin in...no clear vision where all of this is going. I like change, but the kind of change that you look forward to play...not the type of change that does not make the game fun.  For all I know maybe i'm dead wrong here....but i don't see anything showing me that things are going well.
---
using that logic, so are black ops battleships
---
Dude this is absolutely dank
---
Hunting ded site runners was very popular and profitable before, skilled hunters were able to kill them still.
---
you're an idiot for what you have said, i don't need to put anything in your mouth for that to be evident.q
---
&gt; The group that worries me particularly is subcap linemembers
---
The majority of players in nullsec fit this bill.
---
Yeah but chili cheese or french onion?
---
All of the games you mentioned are either 10+ years old or shit.
---
&gt; .no clear vision where all of this is going.
---
it's there, you're just not listening.
---
I put in contrast that almost the same amount of gate jumps are reported in the ESI oddly, but the NPC kills have drop to almost half....
---
sure, ive killed Nullbears Nag's in C5's, and as you know plenty of WH people spend their time hunting in NS and losing ships in NS so you cant use "isk lost' as an argument either.  You bring up the OPs topic but then you post about WH isk, and thats not related to the topic of the blackout so you contradict yourself.   
---
And yes my flair is awesome ! I had it custom made in Thera by some gypsies on their way to Jove, i can refer you for a finders fee if you would like.
---
It helps to understand the PRC and anti-foreigner propaganda trumpeted by the CPC right now.
---
Plex is the metric by which you can judge that. So yeah not counting the only metric you can really judge inflation on, no inflation has occurred.
---
That surprises you? lol
---
what do EVE players know about joking?
---
&gt; ***HUGE COWARD***
---
you should start wearing deodorant
---
Lol youre special. Youre arguing that the game doesnt have 777 bots right? Its way over the top to even consider the game had that many active bots. And thats using your numbers which I seriously doubt are correct.
---
Sure, whatever makes you sleep at night, "factually wrong" lulilul.
---
"botting 5m/hr instead of 45 is a huge difference, a difference that is causing the majority of botters to no longer play ". This is where you fucking said they are gone. Its literally right fucking there dude. 
---
I should have known better than to write you. I mean you are a clinical retard.
---
Yep it kind of sucks that they are the ones suffering the most.
---
It's not, he mad XD
---
Thanks for this, even with everything said I think you hit the nail on the head with your tldr summary. We do need a reason to want to log into the game. Some still have it, some don't like myself. Unless CCP can pull a rabbit out of the hat, I don't see myself returning anytime soon. I think if they keep on this path or fail to act quick enough to reverse it, more players will just go elsewhere. At some point it will reach a real tipping point of player loss in regards to pilots online and willing to fight/trade/consume things, and then it may be too late.
---
ratting alts =/= actual participation
---
I'm glad I touched someone's life so deeply they let an entire community know about it. Its really touching to know I can reach others on an emotional level.
---
Not for nothin, I'm happy with the game now.
---
&gt; Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe players like being part of larger entities or that their potential demise might see an end to the game?
---
Playerblobs getting larger and larger are one of the major content blockers in this game. At some point there needs to be diminishing returns, or else people merely run out of things to do. Imagine there was a blob with 90% of all pilots in Eve; no, you don't want to be part of that blob because you'll run out of anything involving competition between players.
---
Caldari master race!
---
You effectively kill the ability to drop Black Ops BS on sub capital ships.
---
It's irrelevant. It was headed in the same direction whichever way you slice it or dice it. Groups want to sit and pontificate about how this change and that change is the **reason EVE is dying!!!2@@#!#**  
---
What happened in early 2017 that reduced numbers from approximately 40k to 28-29k during the summer with only a modest recovery later that year? The answer is - probably a lot of different shit. But the trend has been downward since around 2016. What happened during 2016?  
---

---
Whether or not CCP is killing *your* game right now could not be less important. Correcting the slope that's been curtailing the game population for several years is likely going to require a complex solution to many problems. Blackout isn't a great solution but it's not a terrible start to testing out the waters for some more ambitious changes and quite frankly the obtuse response from most turbo krabs is fucking asinine. Like I've said before, if you *just now* think there's something wrong you've had your head in the sand either willfully or through stupidity for a few years. On a side note, fuck any major group of people in the game who want to "quit in protest" and then cry about how the game's dying. CCP should be so lucky if none of them darkened the doorstep of this community again.
---
This is like a Tuzy post but with way fewer data points.
---
Take this gold u bastatd
---
The claim I am gauging is whether changes affect/hurt anyone but Goons/Panfam/TEST more.
---
FRT is an interesting case because they are new. So I can't really measure their regions the way I do Delve. Besides, if wealth generation is distributed more to the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th etc blocs, I'd be equally happy compared to the case which it is distributed to complete nonames.
---
No, having more data is the right way because it's actually accurate. Otherwise any tiny data can give you any slope or rise you want.
---
Omg my first ever !!!! Thank you
---
Yet the main ships we hunt DED runners behind acceleration gates are blops.
---
Do you have numbers for these areas? Without player numbers active in said areas, this is pointless, no?
---
Lmao using your reddit mod powers to sticky your own data thread so it gets far more visibility than anyone else's.
---
&gt;FRT is an interesting case because they are new.
---
They are not wide eyed newbies anymore and they haven't been for a while.
---
Myfreecams.com stock did the same thing when they took away sentry carriers.. I actually had to play the game
---
&gt;why are you entitled to a good fight?
---
You aren't entitled to virtually compete safety. And I'm entitled to gank you. 
---
&gt;If this was wow
---
It's not wow, thank God.
---
&gt;Maybe don't go where supers get dropped on you
---
Yeah that's healthy for the game. LMAO
---
I mean, he at least debunked the false narratives about the blackout so all you're doing here right now is slinging shit that has a pretty decent chance to backfire.
---
&gt; So you looked at certain regions over a 2 year period that were considered "umbrella regions" ie Tenal, then stripped them of that title and looked at them for 2 months as non-umbrella regions, and then posted these stats? 
---
Panfam got evicted. What do you me to do? If I continued to count their old space, you'd be equally whining. Besides if you crunch the numbers without them you still have similar results. Imperium/TEST is hurt more than the rest.
---
&gt; hell are you trying to claim that FRT
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3f9bi/data_does_blackout_really_hurt_the_small/f02ix0k/
---
&gt; This is why people don't believe your "data" everytime you post it
---
Zealous Goon linemembers like yourself won't believe my "data" no matter what. It's easy to poke holes and throw random skepticism at any collection of data. But next time you claim "this change will hurt the rest more than Goons" let's see your own data.
---
But then your not really looking at how a change made the numbers different from one month to the next. the numbers from the month before are fuzzed by years of previous changes
---
&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d3f9bi/data_does_blackout_really_hurt_the_small/f02ix0k/
---
now now, that´s no way to speak about 97% of your valued members.
---
The longer period you analyze, the better representation of shares of umbrellas vs smaller regions you get.
---
They were before the blackout. I'm quite sure they are the only viable way to keep null subcap farming alive after blackout.
---
Wasn't it time people saw something different than PCU?
---
&gt; Why do you think it affected bots the most?
---
An analysis of DOTLAN and my ingame knowledge.
---
No because you have data from 2017 to two months ago averaged against the month after the change.... how many changes to income have taken place in all that time frame. If you look at the months before then the month after it paints a much different story but hey you do you people have been adjusting the data they look at to get the results they want forever
---
Tht numbers literally show that mining is up in non umbrella areas compared to the entire year of non - blacked out null.
---
Think about it.
---
Maybe for you? I use Pilgrims, T3C’s, and especially the Stratios.
---
just buff the payout and reduce the effectiveness of capital+ ratting
---
problem solved
---
im playing eve-offline in excel.
---
&gt; probably because of goon deployment
---
Short term fluctuations are why I took long term averages to measure their share in all the farm the best. For blackout, we don't know what'll happen long term and I already admit that.
---
Are you at all interested in things like new player activities? 
---
Long story short, when I was a new guy, I was given a noctis and a stack of rifters. If I wanted drake, I had to salvage out enough money to buy one. I salvaged out the money for a hurricane and a drake, and the rest is history. Right now, It is fucking miserable to be a new guy in a noctis or salvaging ship. There is no counterplay. +2 WCS and the ability to fit a medium MJD would change this. Also drone damage bonus would be great for balance, but I'm not holding my breath. I feel bad when new guys ask me what they should do to earn money for spaceships, because ratting and mining are just not great, so I give them space gold and tell them to figure it out later. Salvaging is just a terrible new guy income stream right now.
---
he hasn't gotten that far in his studies, cut him slack
---
the first step in solving a problem, is admitting you have one. sorry you're too dumb to look at the hard numbers.
---
Ah, I see that you do not know what you are talking about.
---
&gt;Youre arguing that the game doesnt have 777 bots right? 
---
best case scenario for you there are 777 bots running 24/7, and that's not accurate. for your assertion to be correct there'd need to be over 3000 on, 24/7, that was the point of the math
---
&gt;This is where you fucking said they are gone. Its literally right fucking there dude.
---
i said majority, not all of them you fucking retard
---
I see zero risk emmisioned from the flaccid members of "hunters" as a reply to every anti blackout post. What is the most popular mmo in the world? How much risk is involved in that mmo? Is that perhaps a "pointer" to what is by far the most popular playstyle? 
---
That eve has a subset of players who just want to mine or rat causes you to break out in hives?
---
We need those players to keep our game afloat, could you imagine the dev budget with even 1 million subscribers? 
---
If theres soooooo many pvpers in eve you cant pvp each other??
---
I believe your data I just adjusted  it to show me the month before and the month after the change and well the results are different than what you present. Looking at two years of data averaging it and comparing it to a month is not a good way of seeing how a single set of changes actually changes stuff
---
legit not even a 10% drop. it's not the fucking end of the world. fucking daytraders.
---
&gt; It is fucking miserable to be a new guy in a noctis or salvaging ship. There is no counterplay.
---
I am absolutely strongly worried the interaction between the blackout and new players in subcaps.
---
There's also a question of what ore is getting mined. Nullsec ore anomalies and belts spawn the higher-grade ores (+5%/10% yield) while only the Shattered Debris Field does that in JSpace. But much more significantly, JSpace moons with any moongoo better than R4 simply do not exist. I don't know what the mining profit ratio is of RegularOre:MoonGoo, but given the value/volume of R64 rocks I would imagine that even with their reduced availability compared to regular anom rocks, they're a significant portion of the Null mining income.
---
And those are mechanical aspects that no amount of JSpace logistics can solve, unless you're literally organizing hostile locust fleets to jump out of your wormhole, into Null, and stealing people's moongoo and rocks. (But even that wouldn't help the statistical overview because that would still be considered "null mining".)
---
&gt; just buff the payout
---
It might be hard to justify reopening of faucets to CCP atm. Also local is so key for subcaps I wonder if they'd undock even with 2 times the bounties.
---
I mean he didn't, he compared multiple years to two months and abritrarily defined regions, while missing some.
---
Why ? Because if you compare the months before to the months after you don’t get the results you want? If you compare the month before to the month after you don’t get what you want? Ahhh but If you go back two years you get what you want I see
---
One of the mods wants to push an agenda of course, so why not pin it.
---
So, last night 1400 odd players had a fight between Test and Frat where 140 bill of stuff got destroyed. Thats alot of people interacting in one form of another and socialising. I would hope they all had fun!
---
Eve gets its publicity and boosts to its player base from the bigger fights. That interests many people. Thats a fact that data does demonstrate obviously. Why would you take that away?
---
So instead of mechanics that drive people out of the game why not look at things very differently instead of what a minority of people want to see to benefit their styles of play. Space is suppose to be possibly endless. Why is Eve so? Why not make space so big that both bigger and smaller entities exist? Why not make resources diminish and reappear elsewhere that is not industrialised. 
---
So polarised and narrow is the thinking that people are just forcing CCP to respond with mechanics that will kill the game. At the moment the community is suffering and in turn so will the game.
---
Well fair enough. Delve DED hunting needs tanky stuff. I was actually wrong.
---
But hey, under these conditions you can catch people behind acc gates and even bridge your bombers to the target system and kill the target. As long as you can kill the target, you don't need to directly spawn on top of the target.
---
Wow, 100% snuggly.  I thought that was just a myth.
---
Ya it isn't wow, you are more risk averse than people playing wow. If this was wow people would tell you oh its a pvp server deal with it or being friends. You chose cry to ccp until people can't drop on you. 
---
Also why are you entitled to gank me?
---
Reset your medical clone location to your school location (not affected by the only once per year like corporation offices). Move everything else to asset safety.
