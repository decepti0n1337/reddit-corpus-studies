im sad that i dont have minmatar ships and missilies/rockets for fw

Nice good call on the idea

Worm, Gila and Rattlesnake drones are the worst culprits of random wrecking shots. It’s basically tied to how wrecking shots work and it makes them even more retardedly powerful than they already are.
---
That's par for the course for xzest voyage. They front decent numbers (in their timezone) but generally aren't great pilots so they upship as much as they can. If you have the logistics and pilots to counter that it can make for a fantastic time though. They also haven't seemed to be big shit-talkers but maybe that's just the language barrier. Dropping caps if you don't have a \*reason\* to drop caps is typically a no-no in wormhole bushido, which can sometimes be a circle jerk but I personally like the sentiment.
---
Wait, people still play this game?
---

---
Shocker.
---
I am stress testing a ship atm increasing my site tiers, and I found a trig frig book in a t1 or t2 site.
---
I used to get so many solo pvp fights in a crusader it was awesome, then they killed it :(
---
iirc, I'm fairly sure there is a limit to how deep a safe can be.  Anything further just gets moved in to that point.  
---
People use to use to kill their in cyno's mid jump.  This would dump you really far out sometimes and people had ultra deep safes with supers hidden in them.  It was considered an exploit and ccp killed it by creating a maximum bookmark range.
---
many ppl  tried doing this but things have chaned,he updated his bot/macro to autowarp when is bounced off 154km 
---
his tank is very volatile according to intel his capacitor is 1/3 stable,perhaps suicide neut geddons with heavy neut drones to stop his shield booser then smartbomb his drones and let him die to rats?
---
looked ugly,at beginning of eve in 2003   even worse.

thanks

I think you will just lose money on it but sure. If you really do suspect him of botting or macroing then you should report it. You could also just get your own Orca and try to ninja the shuttle.

So you are looking for someone to execute... cute. 
---
The diplomatic way to solve this would have been, acknowledging  some missmanagement while assuring you are tryig to rectify the situation, and urging for an open discussion, while manuvering to silently extinguish the threat to your rule.(or god forbid actual real change).
---
The fact that you went full offensive  and attacking the caracter of possible true and caring complaimts gives even more credibility to your accuser while making you seem a incompetent  and unsure leadership.

Good job this is how not to lead.

Could probably make a decent scram kite ship in FW? Think it gets a fall off bonus, AB scram web MSE gyro DCU and autos? Idk I can see it working
---
Oh I remember the quick alt tabbing to login to two alphas. What'd they do to change it? A new message?
---
Thanks for the explanation i now understand.
---
Definitely! You can have a full T2 fit rapid light caracal which absolutely decimates most frigates and destroyers in the game.
---
Frigate wise you can fit everything you could want. You just lose out on a bit of dps because of the alpha support skills not going to Level V.

---
Well the interesting thing is that the average EVE playerbase was already working age in 2006. IIRC it was like 34 average in 2010 and 37 average in 2016. The change comes in from the "kids" who grew up playing EVE and have important positions. People who generally got into leadership during college/high school because they have lots of time, and then entered the workforce and "matured" the organizations around them as they "matured" (or quit the game/leadership due to lack of time). People like PGL, Boat, and Alphastar would fall under this category, while I'm sure you, Grath, Sort, and to a lesser degree Mittens were already well into your professional careers by the time you picked up EVE.
---
i have approx 380 boxes various size from small to large. was buying them to feed ammo for my corpmates and friends,great when you play as minmatar due to dice-roll for domination emp ammo.
---
When is not due to POS code? 
---
They probably fixed a description typo for some random trade good.

the fun part for me is frigates to cruisers, everyone enjoys different parts
---
They told me why. I played enough of the game to know it would take time to get some SP. I was going on a research deal for 6 months with no internet. I talked to a recruiter and he said train some basic skills (possibly the magic 14 I don't remember). Came back and applied. Turned down for being "too old" game wise.
---
File that stuck in warp petition early.

instead of adding a gimmick they could just make them a little faster and tougher

This new graphical update is awesome!
---
I have no idea about their high-sec campus.
---
In few years ago, they had very experienced PVP pilot like Kelon and I’ve seen many E-uni frigate roams at lowsec.
---
But after middle of 2018, I’ve never saw E-uni at lowsec and never heard about their PVP activities.

I think this is because of the 3d character model present in the char sheet. I've since closed it and it lags no more.

Risk aversion 101
---
Well, it's kind of personal for each one, you know. Find what ticks you. What do you like to do - find a goal. a target to reach. A quantifiable goal. Whatever is you're after - mined ore, missions done, money earned, items manufactured, killmail count, isk destroyed... but if you will play alone or even small group, without a goal you will burn out much quicker. Also, while going towards your goal, keep looking for another goals you could reach for. Helps to take mind of a single thing. Also do more than one thing too. Monotony is straight highway to boredom.
---
The SASB is literally awful, and SSEs are only really good if you have almost no fitting but you do have a spare mid for tank on a shield frigate or destroyer. If you're goal is to just instapop mission rats then an arty Thrasher would do that for way cheaper. You can't actually fit a full rack of 280s onto a Sabre with what you describe *and* that rig setup, you have to drop one of the CDFEs for an ACR otherwise you run out of grid.
---
The SASB is literally useless and- not kidding- an SSE will actually give more EHP, especially when you factor in that the SASB unspools for \~1.5k EHP and then either chugs all your cap or else sits through a 60 second reload cycle doing nothing. A third SSE will give \~2.5k EHP when combined with the resists and the CDFE, and buff up the passive recharge.
---
An arty Thrasher still does the job way cheaper. Not enough CPU to fit a point but in FW people fly "honor point" all the time on the basis that your opponent will be dead before they figure out they can just warp off so it's not that big a deal. Said arty Thrasher is also vastly cheaper and shoots further thanks to the T1 dessie role bonuses. Oh and you can fit a full rack of 280s and not care about the PG mods you have to include because you're not dicking around with SASBs and 900 SSEs.
---
You also do like 50% more volley damage if for some reason you decide that your Sabre fit should run 250 lights rather than 280 howitzers.
---
What exactly are you worried about getting killed by in this thing? Mission rats while capping a plex? The shits don't do much damage, and if someone brings a frigate into that you're probably gonna get shrekt since any brawler or scramkiter will lawnmower you into the ground while anybody channeling their inner Chessur will probably still be able to yeet you out of the ship and into your pod.
---
&gt; with low-grade crystal and strong blue pill should be immortal. 
---
If you're gonna go that far for a frigate/destroyer hull then fly something that is actually good at active shield tanking, like the Hawk, Jaguar, Stork, or Bifrost. The Sabre with LG Crystal, Strong Blue Pill and Hardshell 4 gets only \~310 DPS tank with a C-type MSB (MASBs work differently from regular SBs, mainly because they're more like buffer injection due to the long reload- also ASBs load the smallest cap charges they can fit, while actual cap boosters usually want the biggest unless said charge is bigger than you actual capacitor).
---
As an example a Stork or Bifrost with a C-type MSB will get above 300 DPS tank with *standard* Blue Pill, Hardshell 4, and *no implants*. It does require a link, but both are still pretty close to 300 DPS tank without said link running.
---
With just standard Blue Pill and a C-type MSB a Hawk will tank harder than a Sabre with LG Crystals will. And it has an emergency "oh shit" button with the ADC, and it's faster, and for the Hawk in particular it still has ungodly huge cargo bay for some reason.

This image implies the mods in this subreddit are censoring users.

&gt; &gt; So, on the one hand, it means that people running sites would have to crit their static instead of rolling it entirely. On the other hand, they'd know there is an incoming connection several seconds before anyone could possibly see them on dscan, because the person on the other side needs to probe it down, first. This is why I'm suggesting a 5-30 minute delay before the k162 gets a signature, rather than a 0-minute delay.
---
&gt; Not sure what you are talking about. Spawning of holes should be independent of anyone doing something to them.
---
Alright, let's back up.  How much do you know about wormhole mechanics?  Do you know how static wormholes work?

(I know I was grumbling earlier about how you should do your own homework, but I'm evidently invested in carrying on this conversation, at this point.)

One time I logged in and undocked to a few Drake  on grid shooting the Citidal, I docked and tried to hit them with the station weapons. But they warped to the other station in grid and start hitting it.
---
I pinged someone on TS3 and they got on,  I tried to undock, 10k warp, dock, take control, lock and fire, but by that time they warped to the other station, the corpmate now online manned that one, tried to lock them up, but they retreated into a C4-C5.
---
We got in Strats and bombers and watched both sides of that hole for a while, but they didn’t come back. 
---
Point is if they could get the session timers down to a tick per dock+take control that would be great.

&gt;Maybe because I live in JSpace and the only EUNI group I ever see is the wormhole campus, I got the impression that they were much more alive and well than they were (because, as was mentioned, those guys actually fly around in ships and try to start things).
---
That's been my (limited) experience as well, and it sort of contradicts OP's description of upper management.  Unless someone wants to explain why EUNI's CEO and top officers who supposedly hate PVP so much are perfectly okay with EUNI's wormholers doing PVP.

Every wormhole has one or two static (up to three for shattered wormhole)
---
There is also wandering wormhole that randomly spawn in a jspace (in C1-&gt;C3 you have wandering wormhole to all type of space, in C4 you have only freg size wormhole to null, in C5/C6 you only have Kspace wandering hole). 
---
If the wormhole name is not "wormhole K162" on the overview, you're on the "exit" side, so 
---
You can use http://anoik.is/wormholes to check all type of wormhole ID and where it leads, you can also search for the system name and check its static so you can identify if it's a static or not. 
---
There is one exeption in C2, for exemple if it has a C3 static (O477) this system can also have a wandering C3 which will have the same ID (o477) so in this particuliar case you won't be able now which one is the static

uBlock works fine for me :)
---
Haha, indeed.
---
It's not because supers went cheaper. BPC is the main part of the price, and it's price went down. Much less demand for new Revs.
---
Can someone explain why you'd fit four smartbombs to a super?
---
those are really easy to collapse if you know what you're doing...
---
That is totally what I said.
---
I’ll have to look into retro/Deacons. 
---
One of my favorite “wtf” fleet has been a combo of brawling canes and caracals. I have this idea in my head where the brawling ships ate basically just super heavy tackle.
---
Yea I wonder if you are able to make safes / anchor structures at these crazy spots...would be huge oversight on CCP’s part but, well..
---
What was that revenant doing there? The fit is quite strange looks like a ratting one but why so many smartbomb I don't get it
---
Sweet,I have one I found at a despawned combat site.
---
EVE is a serious business
---
COSMOS BPC's. And mods. Started hoarding them on a whim just in case, didn't even know about the AT at the time. As soon as the next AT rolled around they were beating down my door with name your price offers.

Well, my other post with the serenity server depicted as Winnie-the-Pooh, was taken down again. It only lasted a couple hours this time.

       Basic human rights isn’t a circle jerk issue, it’s an “all of us” issue. Just because yours aren’t being infringed upon at the moment, doesn’t mean you deserve to feel vindication in staying silent. 
---
    As to, why should we get involved or speak up at all?
---
So we clearly establish boundaries with governments and businesses, on what we think acceptable behavior is. 
---
 Staying silent only gives strength to the oppressors.
---
Same for project discovery rewards; you acquire something like 10000 crates on your way to level 500.  An 'open all' button would be a hell of a timesaver.
---
It sounds like you’re doing well with canes and caracals. Assault frigs and logi are awesome, and a ramjag can be you’re heavy tackle :) 
---
Also, inties are great all round scouts but consider having a hyperspatial sabre in gang just behind the scout if you can, or even acting as scout himself.
---
Man that was a good ride. I bought that revenant back when they first came out. I've lost many supers, titans and even a couple AT ships the last 15 years. I'll keep playing this way cause I love this game.  Gf  Darkness

You wont. It's not against the eula because you don't "move" items not "acquire" them faster.

---
Tin foil hat time....I don't think VINDI were ever really part of WinterCo at all! 
---
VINDI is basically F-OFF + friends and F-OFF already have a track record of flipping sides during a war (they left Legacy and joined WC to start the alliance).  At the beginning they were active and on loads of WC fleets but constantly pushed the agenda for their own alliance space.  When they got Cache their support of the coalition for any fleets from Detorid pretty much stopped and VINDI turtled up in Cache and focused on laying infrastructure &amp; digging in. 
---
It was also clear from VINDI discord that the alliance execs were in regular contact with Evictus and I suspect they were also in contact with TEST. When Vily made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d63nic/legacy_official_statement_for_winter_alliances/) there were a series of strange messages in VINDI Discord about "considering options" and the execs admitted that Vily had approached them directly before the message was sent out.
---
Finally there has been an overwhelming sense of elitism compared to the rest of Winter within VINDI, mainly in TeamSpeak since the alliance formed with certain members of the execs joining in.
---
So, what if VINDI &amp; Vily/TEST were in constant contact since F-OFF left Evictus and either Vily has been persuading them to flip or they were acting as spy's all along?
---
Isn't calling people stupid and retards in r/Eve the epitomy of an Eve player though?
---
I think EvE Uni suffers from the same issue as EvE in general suffers, declining player base.
---
There isn't enough (or experienced enough) middle management (FC, ppl driving other ppl on), may be the fault of upper management, I think they might need to give more wiggle room in the rules and regulations. But who's fault that is, isn't so clear.
---
Campuses tend to die, when prominent characters leave. Those prominent characters have a duty to foster the next prominent character however.
---
I do think it would be useful if Eve Uni went back to the principle of pushing ppl through the corp, start the total newbros in High sec or low sec, graduate to null sec and WHC then stay on and become FC/Management, or move on, it is after all the main goal to be an introduction corp.
---
Wars have always been a problem, no war targets are ever after a good fight, and Eve UNI can't give one, they either die one by one, or they go out in masses and blob, resulting in them docking up. If you think managing a campus or a random roam can be taxing, try hunting war targets SUCCESSFULLY with a fleet of new players, it requires stupid amount of skill, cunning and luck. Back around Aldrat EvE Uni had permanently standing WT hunting fleet going, mostly a dedicated small group of ppl who specialized in it and brought in newbros (or used them unknowingly as bait, hehe) to teach.

PS: Miss you Gareth Correllian, come back to EvE!

Looks like eve scams are moving into the real world
---
Around that time I was dabbling in industry, and I figured there ought to be money to be made building combat ceptors if they were going to be the default sov warfare ship. I started inventing claw blueprints with the intention of building up a small cache of claws that I could sell for a nice little chunk of change the next time the price massively spiked on them due to them being used in a war.
---
...I have a bunch of claw blueprints still.
---
Wow. Look at that. People in Eve exploiting for their advantage... never thought that would happen.
---
Nope, just seemed like a very Trumpian thing to say is all. 
---
Also, I don't really care about being down voted?
---
Jibrish IS China, obviously
---
Thanks man you've made my day.  You saw what I trying to say in the post.  Provi at the time needed more caps, my alliance itself was heavy on shield caps and could of brought faxes to go in the with chimera's but the coalition wanted armor.  While its not something I want to rehash or anything because I've been over it so many times when I was in Provi. However my wanting to fly the chimera was purely until I got the skills for the armor doctorine as I was slow training and it all takes time, I just wanted to see some action in the ship I had avalaible to me and didn't see it as harming the fleet comp.  As at worse I'd be a extra shield extender for my side and I also had another member of my corp that would ignore the FC and still drop a chimera and he survived about 80% of the time even though he was in the wrong tank.
---
Now i know what happened to missing gates between Lowsec and Stain.
---
sooo, pretty curious. Have any of you done that thinking it was sisi but was really TQ? 
---
also, how trouble would I be in if I anchored an ESS in a grandfathered deepsafe? I got a couple bookmarks.
---
It will be done after the path that will introduce Shield Slaves to the game.

It doesn't? TIL!

Correct, easy way to think of it:

a big missile will have a big explosion but a small frigate will only be hit by a small part of that explosion.

a small explosion is quick and targeted.

I'd try to log on using another computer to determine if your character is knackered or if the laptop is at fault and then go from there. I had a bad profile stopping the the client from launching before, but you already wiped those files from the disk.
---
You need to quit one alliance before you can join another, also, 24 hour cooldown
---
I don't know what you expected from Boat.
---
If your current alliance is wardec'd you cannot join another for 7 days (or war is cancelled) since the wardec transfers to your corp when you leave.

Cool thanks :)

Good listening.
---
The hardest sites (it sounds like you failed some of these) pay the most. A cargo scanner also makes it a lot easier to be picky and learning what factions pay more also helps you save time. 
---
You can tell from the names of the cans (ruins, rubble, ECT) which sites are harder/pay more, scan those, and figure out if the site is junk really fast. 
---
Maybe it's more like 10-20 mil but it's not 1-10mil. Rig the ship, bring the right modules, learn the sites, get your skills to max/alpha max, and get really good at the hacking mini game. As I understand it, some of the people who do this hardcore only go out of their way for 2-3 specific factions cause they pay a lot more. 
---
It's also worth noting that there's no bonus for building ship rigs exclusive to Omegas, unlike with the rest of industry, so you can increase your gains if you use some of the salvage instead of just selling it, which is a good way for a new player to go into industry.

I just wanted to say that you should more likely address this to people from lowsec or highsec. The only thing that offended ne was the way you said it like nullseccers dont know that. I mean sure as long as you cant fly it it might not be Common to you, but There are no nullsec roaming fleets without sabres except inti fleets or sometimes blops fleets which is pretty obvious since dictors are too slow (not nullified) for the former and cant use blops bridges for the latter. 
---
Reading your post gave me the impression you think about nullsec like we are all just carebears or bots and i am done with that bullshit.
---
Got a mining Corp that’s always looking for members. Ok for more info
---
I commented on the smug sentence of "losing only our shit ships that were clearly not part of any reasonable doctrine within what we brought "  when they had *more* than they needed to keep literally anything that even tried to be the same tank type alive against even more than they fought lmao.
---
Seems pretty simple to follow but I guess if your flair is accurate this shouldn't be surprising.
---
Ohhh my god I remember all of this. The neph xeno....... Remember that so well
---
Ready for this mindblower?
---
This is an activity that should be botted.
---
Change my mind!
---
google translator is getting worse and worse over the time....
---
What your saying is reinforcing my point, the mentality you approach the game with is just not good for the game. EVE is a sandbox, what you want it to be is a theme park. The reward is accomplishing what you set out to do. Not some irrelevant carrot at the end of a stick.
---
Make citadel's defangable thanks and God bless
---
ok
---
That was an informative read. Thank you!
---
When you quote something, you should typically quote it - not change all the words to fit your narrative.  Doing the former contributes to an honest debate.  Doing the latter makes you look like a salty shit who exists only to crap all over someone else's fun.  
---
I appreciate the insult based on my flair as well - that really makes you seem smart.  Let me know if you want to insult my mother, say something mildly racist, or comment on my sexuality.  I'll bet those are all tools in your toolbox.
---
not all tracks are on  soundcloud... im trying to find wormhole ambient sounds but they are not in game files either..
---
Question is Hotpocket, I remember you... from what I have said can you guess who I am?
---
I know alot of people complain about this before but it's great to get newbros into the game quickly. If some veterans get an extra 1m sp then oh well
---
Shit it down goy
---
Wooooosh
---
Ah hell, pays* for servers... Stupid mobile
---
I didn't even realize this was possible I've always just right clicked capacitor.
---
You’re making money off a video game
---
And making money IN the video game
---
But sure come here and explain why you “need” to do anything with or about it lmao
---
So it works on my 80mil SP main?
---
If you haven't purchased it before it should work
---
You're a Kleenex tbh
---
They have but they don't care about specific regions. They just want a center with regions of bodies around them. You could flip the map around and drop TEST in Branch, put the rest of Legacy in Tenal / Vale / Trib / Dek and they'd broadly speaking be just as happy.
---
That's great, but how do you get the smell out of your clothes afterwards?
---
Still means they care more about sov than the content they get from being there
---
Disband yourself In game. And IRL.
---
yep. edited the post to include more details
---
holy shit that actually worked. thanks dude
---
All of the tracks I put on the Jukebox are from the resources I listed. I didn't delve too deep for tracks :)
---
That was fun.
---
&lt;3 :-)
---
Throwback to when battleships were a thing and you could orbit a fleet of battleships at like 5k in an AB heretic and be taking almost zero damage for an extended period of time.
---
Can you ask your CSM representative if he heard about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?         
---
Thx
---
Knerf performs amazing services in private chats.  It is expensive but well worth. Discerning neckbeards always choose Knerf.
---
Oh I get it.  I also think it's a terribly minor thing, and people complaining about it must not have much going on in their lives.  They're literally complaining that they paid fake computer game money to a guy who created something for free and they didn't get what they expected from their fake computer game money.  I can't think of a more shallow or worthless argument to make.  But keep defending it - please.
---
i never donated since isk doesnt pay for server costs unless you rmt
---
I don't think 'chaos' is over.  We are seeing what the game is like with the cyno changes currently.  That is part of the 'chaos era'.
---
Boooooo, CCP Falcon get off the stage, booooooooo.
---
Go home to Hilmar and your adopted child and well decorated kitchen, booooooooo.
---
Thank you Squizz for your work on this. Don't let the complaints get to you. Your killboard is so easy to use and intuitive. Would hate to lose you as a community resource.
---
The issue here is specifically about the ones having paid still getting that add, stop being so dense ffs
---
Yeah it worked for me on 6 accounts
---
As much as I enjoy the killboard, and squiz does a great job with it, I do think the game would be in a better overall place without killboards. It's just too much information.
---
It’s in the articlw
---
&gt;Aryth asks Dunk Dinkle if he would engage 20 Sleipnirs in 20 Thoraxes, he would come out ISK positive by just killing three of them. Dunk Dinkle doesn't want that, He wants the hostiles to get the hell out of his system.
---
May I ask why you're against taking cash donations?  You put in time, effort, and money for a product people find valuable.  They are willing to give you money for your efforts in return for a service you already provide.  Sounds like a win/win to me.
---
  In the spirit of New Eden's free market economy you should take cash donations.
---
Do you have to work hard to be this retarded or is it a natural gift?
---
I remember when the old Allakazam site for Everquest had to sell because of ad revenue. A sad day for all involved.
---
I hope it does not have to come to that here. A Patreon would help a lot; I know myself and many others would help to keep ZKillboard up.
---
I'm not being dense.  They paid a fake in-game currency to a guy to remove ads from a free website, and now they're complaining because they can still see one ad.  That's the dumbest complaint ever registered in human history.  It's fake fucking money that we're complaining about.  And these people probably have billions, if not trillions, more of it.  Nobody is going homeless because they donated their last isk to zkill.  This is so utterly dumb and you're all so fucking pathetic for continuing to argue this like you got ripped off in real life.

Dont really play anymore but i did log in at the beginning of this year and they seem to be worth a fair amount. Way way more than i paid.
---
Quafe ultramarine itty for 50m 
---
Blueprints for asp mine and the other variant i cant recall now.
---
Bunch of other stuff i cant remember about, but it's bound to haplen when you've been playing since 2010
---
There was this bug that when you abandoned fighters (I believe), they would warp away to a ridiculous distance. Scan them down and there's your deep safe. We had some nice ones in Catch.
---
The cyno changes will likely stick around mostly because they have been proven mostly ineffective against what they designed the nerf, but you should be happy umbrella farming won and most pvp that isn't ganks is out of the game, the game is boring but fuck it you might get to sit in a tidi for a day once a year enjoy eve.
---
&gt;I will have to shutdown zkillboard.
---
Sounds good. You're complete shit. Bye.
---
Necessity is the mother of invention. Now there isn;t any need for a new kb because your provides exceptionally well. When it stops it will be a different situation
---
You know what dude, I'm ready to open my wallet and pay you real life money to take down zkill forever - just to teach these ungrateful pricks a lesson.  PM me what that would cost if you're interested - maybe we can do a deal.
---
Entitled much?  Why "should" CCP provide this service?  They built you an amazing game with APIs that allow for people to make whatever services they can think of including zkillboard.  CCP is already going above and beyond most dev companies.
---
“Nobody will abuse these reinforcement timers at all”
---
50 was a joke number, I don't know why I would actually count, but I have turned on collidables and had my overview totally filled with junk while in a data/relic site. 
---
Just wait for me to screenshot a fresh site for you at some point. Shouldn't take too long for one to pop-up in my wormhole where I can get at it before some else does.
---
Osmium died without direct replacement emerging, so you cannot apply this logic to every case.
---
Yes i imagine something will replace zkill, but it won't be as global/fast/feature-rich for years (unless someone else rehosts zkill, that is).
---
I'm quite convinced it's probably been done before :D
---
5b on StainGuy ingame and i will delete my post here }:&gt;
---
My kitchen is pretty awesome tbh
---
Decide what you enjoy doing most, look for a corp on the recruitment forum that does that. Beware of corps that say they do everything because they usually do nothing at all.
---
My dude, I will never ever ever allow ads on my system, but I will gladly donate a small amount when I can. Don't ignore the fact that you have an extremely useful website that 99% of eve metagaming is run through. People would gladly pay for it.
---
It does make a big difference in mindset, though.  Letting some ad-hosting company take up a little corner of your window, it's still 100% "your thing" and you're free to tell any complainers to fuck off.  Whatever ad deal is a completely separate thing.  As soon as your users are directly paying you - even through donations - it adds a sense of obligation to respond to their criticism.
---
I've bashed many, mainly Astras and Forts though :)
---
Nah he had exactly a full nomad pod (which is shit regardless hg snakes are better) imying hd didnt unplug
---
This. Especially given how cancer ads are in society, I much prefer being a paying customer. I mean, if I hadn't already flooded myself with golden wrecks and quit Eve anyway.
---
You still play this game?
---
The requirement for posting here is having an inactive account. Didn't you get the memo?
---
You missed a SpongeBob opportunity D:
---
If zkill shuts down, other killboards will take their place. Some already try, if you look at Fraternity for example. The change needs to happen at at a higher level with CCP, preventing or delaying killmails from posting to the API.
---
Every single top level thread is asking for a Patreon so we can give you money. Negative?
---
If the alliance you are in started the war then as aggressor you likely have to wait for the war dec to end.
---
If the alliance you are in was dec'd and is defending then you do indeed inherit the war dec and transfer it with you to your new alliance. For your new alliance they should be aware that the war dec will start INSTANTLY when your corp joins that alliance. This will happen 25h after they hit the accept button. The members will get no advance warning unless their leadership makes them aware.
---
I think so but I'm not ad savvy. I'm pretty sure you can get a base rate for housing the ads and an additional few pennies if someone clicks the ads from your site.
---
Yeah. But that isnt with crazy skills. Ded 10s are just nice because it takes very little training to do.
---
Well StainGuy is just trying to help.
---
Not that it's your ISK since you never owned the structures. It's only your ISK if you manage to get them transferred or steal them.
---
Well that wasn't passive-aggressive at all.
---
Can I pay to have a crayon drawing by Squizz of my favorite killmail, plz.
---
No most play in a corp. I am affiliated with Brave. And highly recommend them. However karma fleet. Brand newbros, and pandemic horde are also good groups from what I understand. However if you wanna stay in highsec for a bit we do have a new highsec corp. Brave Empire, which is war dec free and still has interactions with the rest of the corp so you can get your feet wet with Brave
---
 Fleet up with friends and not have to move across the universe if you arent ready.
---
Lame
---
Free Ranger Regiment?
---
taking down zkill would be a good thing tbh, imagine people not getting insta intel
---
The second nano is worthless, they both warp in 4 seconds.
---
The brave ads were still present after paying for the ad free option of the website.
---
When Britain handle over Hong Kong back to China following the end of their lease Agreement, China greed that Hong Kong would remain seperate for 50 years and be allowed to elect it's own "president".
---
That was 1997. Hong Kong has never had a free election of the top official who is hand picked by Beijing, and when they have elections for lower officials it is between people also hand picked by Beijing.
---
In 2017 China wanted to instant the national education system in Hong Kong, primarily as an attempt to slowly eradicate the Hong Kong culture by reeducsting the children.
---
Teenagers protested and got that rescinded, but more recently China has continued to push harder and farther, including basically importing people from the mainland to further change the culture and force a more widespread use of Mandarin over the local Cantonese, and use basically a military police force of mainlanders.
---
Hong Kongers are protesting, the police are getting violent, some.protestors are getting violent (or plain clothes police pretending to be protesters, who knows).
---
In China this is reported as foreign funded terrorists infecting Hong Kong. So mainlanders that follow the party believe this is open aggressive revolt against China, by outsider terrorists.
---
Even though what Hong Kong is protesting for is basic things like elections.
---
Free Hong Kong!
---
"So I was just curious about the state of the game right now?"  
---
This is a fantastic, dynamic, complex game. Impossible to master in its full scope, but you can try and enjoy so many different playstyles.
---
"Is it a good time to start?"  
---
Absolutely. The tutorials aren't perfect, but they're much better than they used to be and remain a focus for CCP. There are a lot of features designed to be new-player friendly (1M SP promotion, skilling spree, etc).  
---
"Will I EVER be able to catch up to the people that have been playing for years and years?"  
---
Depends what you mean by "catch up". There will be toons with 200M skill points, and they'll be better able to do more things...but other than the most large-scale things, it only takes a few months to be highly effective at most playstyles. Explore the game, discover what you enjoy, and you'll be able to enjoy it. The presence of high-SP characters or huge alliances are features, not bugs.
---
"Is there much PVE in the game now?"  
---
This is a contentious topic, but the game appears to have shifted in favor of PVE over the past few years. Whether you're into mining, industry, logistics, ratting, etc...there's a ton of PVE of all shapes and sizes occurring in different parts of the game.   
---
This reddit has become a particularly negative place...try to breeze past the "EVE is dying" meme. The game is great, dive in, give it a chance, find your niche, find another one. You'll figure it out.
---
Nice try, Xi
---
This rev survived being in nc but near Insta died in horde.
---
When is burning napalm going back to nc so you guys can get good again reeeee?
---
Have the neutral cloaked so they do it.
---
zkill would be better dead
---
Yup, things that happened in the past are totally more important than what is happening now.
---
Yup.
---
I think allowing Hong Kong to have free elections falls under "freedom" even in your cartoon world.
---
Yeah but stain guy is a retard
---
Sure, but they'll fuck you up.
---
So we have Free Hong Kong and now Free Syria from the invading turkish (thanks Trump for bending the knee)
---
So anyone else that needs to be free ?
---
Not anymore FoF nerf killed that range farms completely, now you just have to run with something that tanks the full site.
---
you got em right there, nice!
---
You can get one million transactions on a raspberry pi. It's nothing noteworthy.
---
edit; lmao you're pityful
---
    ------------
---
    TRANSACTIONS
---
    Trx id counter 327273416
---
That's 327 million. Zkill would wipe the floor with that number too, I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the trillions.
---
Man, boot licking and whataboutism all in one post. Who knew r/eve could get so spicey.
---
I thought they are already the de facto exec alliance of deadco so I guess... mission complete?
---
Hilmar probably heard they were working on something to do with slaves and sent them on an equality and diversity course.
---
mlyp
---
I have not played solo EVE in 3 years. What time zone are you?
---
Jacksonville.  Big. Oof
---
It wasn't necessarily a comeback, more of a concern after taking a peek at your post history.    
---
Didn't seem like he's looking for people to feel bad for him, more of a this free service is going to disappear if the cost aren't covered kinda post, but hey, you're welcome to prove him wrong by showing how much your online services cost to run
---
blahblahblah new skins, just login to buy them and logout, we don't need you playing this game to make it work.
---
You must have read a different history book, a really really weird one, and that kind of economic prosperity hasn't ever been nor will ever be for everyone.
---
Don't get me wrong, totalitarian regimes and genocidal goverments are the worst... but that doesn't make western global powers any better, they are clearly capable of the same horrible things; they just do it to other nations and not their own.
---
It's not clear that people are leaving in droves. I will give you that the game is bleeding players, but there is a reasonable possibility most of the "losses" have been due to banned bots.
---
1, Gecko's
---
Bought them at 30m a piece on release, they going 100m+ now, i'm still sitting on about 60+ of them for own use/sale if they keep rising :)
---
2,"field marshall " coat
---
bought this for 200m a few years back, early 2014 i believe. decided upon closer inspection i didnt like it, kept it around anyways. sold it a few months back to a 4b buy order.
---
3 Golden monocle
---
bought it for like 2b, am using it myself but they go for 25b now.
---
We also found those old dev blogs yesterday and did some code archaeology into the fixes from 2010, when we investigated our options on how to fix the consequences of this bug.  :)

Ads are terrible though; some people like myself will not tolerate ads due to not only annoyance, but the huge host of security issues they open up.  Yet I have no issue donating to sites that I make use of, just not through ads.
---
I thought I was a retard.
---
&gt; but there is a reasonable possibility most of the "losses" have been due to banned bots.
---
lmao
---
Can I pay to have my kills and deaths never show up on zkill? Just a thought.
---
More than you've contributed to the eve community though
---
They didnt blow up the citadels that were put in them
---
&gt; the CSM minutes do not confirm an AT, merely say they are hopeful to bring it back.
---
But CCP's other comments on how its hard to maintain the AT tool don't give a lot of hope towards its return.
---
Last chance to play it now before they pull the plug lmao
---
I am a wormholer and you are not, therefore I must have superior mechanical knowledge that can't possibly be contained in your feeble little nullbear brain. My willingness to do an annoying amount of scanning and logistics in Eve instead of just joining a kspace alliance with a jf service and doing something productive IRL with the saved time makes me a far superior player, and frankly all of you filthy casuals with "other games" or "more important real life commitments than some MMO" should bow down and accept your place lower on the food chain.
---
Yeah that's why I can still use all the safes I made with sun bounces and the structures people put in them are still there
---
Just charge people money already. Once it's stable you can divert the isk to pay developers while you're gone. Eve devs will work for isk.
---
Uninstalling my eve launcher.
---
" but there is a reasonable possibility most of the "losses" have been due to banned bots. "    
---
The losses were mostly from peak times. The problem with bots according to everyone who hates them is that they play 23/7, well if the biggest loss of players was ONLY during peak times, which is was, then those are most likely not bots since bots would be on from DT to DT.
---
I've joined a few high sec mission corps over the years and they have all sucked badly. nullbears are the guys to go play with imho

It can warp nearly 9000 AU per warp, I am using ascendancy implants so it warps at 12.35 au/s

I will add it to the post

you know things are bad in ns when vindi of all people are "elitist"
---
Give it the good ol CCP soon^(TM)

Like cyno nerfs besides distance change was a great thing... Every ship was fitting cynos and you didn't actually know if you were getting hot dropped or fighting. So I'm quite happy about that. But i came back after disconnected from Eve for 3 yrs and rorqs were becoming mining machines. At this point I boosted my sp per injectors... Spent some good irl money and speed trained to have fully functional boosted mining rorq. Not to mention the actual in game cost to buy fit fly ship in belt and mine. At the time was 13-14 billion isk. Plus 20 billion isk in injectors. If I knew that these "Balances" /nerfs were in plans I would have saved the iskies for something else. I dealt with it tho and ran pvp for a bit... Then the war that started ended with CCP blackout... Smh. Next CCP talking about "Chaos Era" smhx2🙄😞 these idea's are like a ship without a pilot just drifting off into space aligned to nothing at max speed. Many questions of directions and loyalty have came about... It's, before there was direction now it's try any idea to shake up. You shook the tree alright, all the apples are starting to fall. (Eve is the tree and players are apples) I for one don't want to stop playing eve and I definitely want eve to survive the death curve that all mmos have in there path. Soorrryy for rant!
---
check out public fleets!
---
Tuskers is doing nano stuff every friday, EU and US tz, channel "**The Tuskers Public Channel**"
---
Bombers bar is doing cloaky stuff "**Bombers Bar**".
---
Spectre Fleet is still doing all kinds of stuff "**SF Spectre fleet**"
---
And there are many more smaller communitys like "**Microgangs**".
---
Hell, you can even ask around in "**Bringing Solo Back**" if anyone wants to join up for pvp.
---
I update the website with a web app geared towards mobile phones located at [EVE Market Deals](https://nixed.tech/eve/market_deals.html). It's similar to the Android app but missing some core functionality, sort by, search, and setting max jumps. I plan to continue to work on those as I have time. Its updated after 30 mins.
---
Guess i'll do the same
---
It would be beneficial for your health and wellbeing

So are you ever going to fix the glitch that allows rorquals to mine out of siege with bonus - or multiply their drone values exponentially? I submitted a bug report a week ago and haven't even gotten a "we're looking into it."
