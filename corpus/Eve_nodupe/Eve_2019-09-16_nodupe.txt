a change is needed for sure, but turned out this wasn't it.
---
---
---
They will have scouts several jumps out so they have time to reship well before you get into system.
---
Why is it cowardice to choose to not be a free killmail?
---
In 30 days, there will be titans being sold for 30b in Imperium.
---

---
Good luck with that massive spam.
---
nulsec blackout ;)
---
Agree
---
I just started EVE. I created my account through steam, made a username for it, and the username in my launcher is still STEAM::(numbers). Is there a way to change it?
---
Out of everyone in this subreddit, you're the most wrong.
---
arenas with AT rules and match betting
---
Those baddies will bot so badly after tomorrow, to pay for that.
---
My carpal tunnel syndrome flared up at your proposal. Just how much do you hate miners?
---
The game doesn't need a nerf to mining, it needs more reasons to blow shit up.
---
i would really like to see a "ghost" inty = don't appear on local/dscan but aren't nuli, can fit a covops but activation cost +10000% (covert bridge)   
---
just being "ghost" with gate cloak seem insufficient, you just gonna catch afk farmer or retard like before, a real ghost inty seem a perfect counter against botter and balance 'cause you can bubble him  
---
but i think CCP can't do that local and game can't interact like that, even for your idea btw
---
Lowsec meta is still mach/rattlesnake/vindi/bhaal so BSs are not that bad. 
---
It’s just they are too weak against bomb and it must weak against bomb so can do nothing against stuka fleet.
---
Ferox is still decent cost effective ship so meta will spin around bs/HAC/ferox if stuka is gone somehow
---
but stuka is here so we’ll never see old schools again cuz we have 0 reason to not fly boosh bomber for that cost.
---
even frat are flying stuka so we can see how people adapt to this meta.
---
That's a myth, Snuff sits comfortably under Wangs capital umbrella.
---
My ideas on structures: Make them more expenisve. Make them require upkeep/taxes. Make them unable to tether/be docked at if left offline for too long. Make them killable in 3 days if left offline for too long.

---
But how you did not flee in time?
---
Every time that i tried to take a few of you, those guys were professional at running away.
---
Its actually scary how good a PIRAT is to flee when they are not fighting a JF or an Orca.
---
Also stop trying to balance the game around the once a year bloc capital blob fights. If those suffer while the rest of the game prosper's then it's a win in my books.
---
OMG, that 'description' of Rahne!
---
Boobs
---
Sad but true
---
&gt; As a new player, you should not set foot anywhere near r/Eve. Hang out with people who like the game instead.
---
You're wrong
---
Insurance covers t1 hulls, most ships that are purchased are t2 or faction, they also only cover hulls and not mods, also supers and titans are generally not covered under insurance to anything more than 10% of the hull.
---
Wars have everything to do with pve. Why do you think people crab? It's to make isk and survive being deployed for 3-6 months out of the year and not have to resort to flying tackle because they ran out of money.
---
If people krab just to make isk how does that hurt the game just sitting in their wallet?  Pve is a necessary part of this game and making it more tedious is shitty game design
---
What the fuck was this?  
---
yet, somehow, it feels so appropriate
---
CCP screwed up YEARS AGO! Thousands of Pilots left when the fun started turning into a job. Grinding is not fun.
---
We play to have fun! Remember that!
---
Hal Lubbert
---
300mil-2bil per cyno lmao might as well gate the damn thing 
---
No safety in cap pve either since you cant fit a cyno 
---
All the change that have been going on since the “chaos era” started have just been buffs to cloaky hunters while pve in null has been getting fucked completely 
---
Not to mention that provi basicly got executed by blackout
---
Yet another sad but true.
---
Small and regular updates every fortnight/month and content updates every 3-6 months, you'd think it'd be easy, but it apparently isn't.
---
I guess?
---
Null  and wh are diferente spaces trying to make them the same is just stupid
---
It would be both the funniest and saddest thing in the history of Eve if it turns out "blackout" was simply CCP testing to see if they could local chat entirely because they have no fucking clue how to actually fix it.
---
Lmao tell how to conter a bomber or a t3c that just poped on grid 5km away from you and has you webbed and scramed dosnt matter if your afk or not its like punching a blind guy and when he complains saying “maybe you should have tried”
---
thanks for posting this you reminded me to cancel my subscription
---
Well, they are pretty good at bling tanking but it's not really a skillful activity. The concept is that as long as you do DPS and can hold heavy tackle, you can kill things--and if anything puts up a fight, it can only bring a finite amount of DPS without being too obvious. Therefore all you have to do is have maximum possible bricktank with repping alts to survive being able to redock, since it's exceptionally hard to disrupt positioning without CDs and clear room to bump. T3Cs can heat for 60s without much issue, so you can see it's a staple part of their doctrine.
---
This of course, breaks down when they come out of the shadows of station rings because obviously you can't just decide you've had enough, timer down, and redock. I'll bet anything that they were pulled out away from the station by the Impel bait.
---
That's what one of the Ehefkae people said on another comment. Bait Impel drew them out.
---
You aren't being told your way of enjoying the game is wrong. You're being told that where you're enjoying that relative peace isn't supposed to be relatively peaceful. Arguably the presence of players like yourself in nullsec is symptomatic of the problem with sov null. It should never have been possible to reach the current levels of safety. Never mind have that safety sustained for years.
---
&gt; I like to go back to peaceful high sec and do stuff there like events, invasion, abyss etc, 
---
events usually have wh spawns and abyssal pockets can be opened anywhere. It's really just the trig invasion and highsec missions you can't run in null.
---
At that point I believe we would be playing world of warships in space.
---
You realise pve =/= bot    If you invested years into perfecting a certain aspect of the game and within a week the whole thing gets destroyed while the people that were already countering your play style get a massive buff that only has 1 counter play not logging in would you keep your sub?
---
Since you are clearly a fool whom I pity, I will help you.

"Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication."
---
Let's see social skills. The degree to which I'm an arsehole is on purpose.
---
Repetitive behaviors. Which?
---
Speech. I'm typing not talking.
---
Non-verbal communications. How the fuck would you know? On the other hand typing IS non verbal.
---
Try again with something non stupid IF you can. Which I doubt.
---
Yea and it only took an Imperium sized distraction to do it.
---
oldie but goodie from TF2.  And, yeah, it does sort of feel appropriate, doesn't it?
---
Yes let me just complain to the creators of the game while i violate the eula this is big brain time
---
I certain was looking around for a decent replacement for my time...
---
Very true. That's why it's so hilarious when we win.
---
Wrong.
---
You know that PvPers mine and crab too, right? Just with the sheer numbers of people doing it, its not worth the time or effort because of inflation and over supply.
---
Oh nice my play style that already worked got massively buffed so that my target has no counterplay but staying in station ... oh no they removed the completely unfair buff that affect everyone that lived in this region guess ill stop playing
---
Then stop annoying the rest of us with your posting.
---
There's what like 20k of us that still play? That many people are never going to be united. Especially not when a change benefits one specific playstyle and hurts another.
---
To be fair ever since they updated it months ago they also can't turn it on correctly.
---
Sure there's a lot of that going around, Tex. Find anything interesting?
---
Found a tank sim that looks interesting but I haven't looked into it in depth called "Hell Let Loose" 
---
I'm kind of interested in trying Arma 3 but some of the simulation details in that are kind of a "turn off" like for instance TOW missiles that work at point blank range and a Bradley auto cannon that was able to kill a T-72 FROM THE FRONT! That's theoretically possible if you can shoot it in the arse or back of the turret, but front? Hell no!
---
Source?

Flashbacks to when I was married
---
&gt; Insurance covers t1 hulls, most ships that are purchased are t2 or faction, they also only cover hulls and not mods, also supers and titans are generally not covered under insurance to anything more than 10% of the hull.
---
That still doesn't mean that ship destruction is an isk sink. The act of destroying a ship is an ISK faucet because it brings in ISK into the game that otherwise didn't exist. Module loss due to loot fairy is a material sink but not an ISK sink and is entirely separate.
---
&gt;Wars have everything to do with pve. Why do you think people crab? It's to make isk and survive being deployed for 3-6 months out of the year and not have to resort to flying tackle because they ran out of money. 
---
That's a very blanket statement for you to make and I don't think you're in any position to speak for anyone but yourself.
---
&gt;If people krab just to make isk how does that hurt the game just sitting in their wallet? Pve is a necessary part of this game and making it more tedious is shitty game design
---
ISK that isn't circulated provides no benefit for the overall health of the in-game economy. You can read more about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/velocity.asp) and apply some critical thinking to determine how it applies to EVE's economy.
---
I said the word catch. Catching someone isn't necessarily killing them. I want to interact with the other players in the massive multiplayer game, not just have them dock up way before any kind of interaction can take place. If I catch them and its bait and they kill me so be it. If people would put the littlest effort into playing blackout could have been just as dangerous for hunters as it was for the bears.
---
I think you should reword this poster...
---
It says something but even after you've told us the message it still doesn't come across
---
Says the salty krab
---
Lmao idk whats going on even more now
---
And that's why there's always one siding reeing about something in a sandbox.
---
Ah so I'm in no position to speak about anyone but my self, and yet here you are, a jelly belly. Doing exactly that. Karmafleet fleet is recruiting if you want to get out of highsec. Also I'll pull this one out of kindergarten class.
---
Insurance works like this.
---
If I have 5 apples, but eat 3 apples how many apples do I have left?
---
*sigh*
---
Enjoy the video game mate. 
---
/u/BBTB2 these are the people in your alliance.
---
Then why are goons in null and not high? After all, the isk is better. 
---
If highsec is such good isk then why didn't the krabs move there rather than tantrum?
---
I will, enjoy whatever it is you do.
---
You generalized by saying the buff/nerf cycle in games is cancer. What a brilliant statement. You must be so educated in game development. No buffs no nerfs no changes work better for you?
---
Thats a very insightful and convincing argument.
---
&gt; the oneiros and scimi don't have a cap bonus
---
They do though? Reduction in cap usage for reps??
---
delete wormholes better? NO....give all holes dual static
---
I've restarted Skyrim and I've also been playing Surviving Mars which is rather fun.
---
On the Space MMO front, I've been eyeing off Dual Universe but it's too young yet to dive in yet but looks interesting...
---
anyway notthing of value was lost..
---
wait. this is satire... so... we're right!  We did it reddit!
---
I live in a WH, you know without local.
---
I feel bad for the ccp employee that reads these garbage ideas.
---
Tldr?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzxgyUHImnA
---
&gt;I'm imagining a multiplayer version of that but in the wilderness where other people would frag you for your items, and even if you didn't ever encounter another player, you'd still be competing with them to find and empty the loot chests first.
---
So sort of like escape from tarkov?
---
That goes both ways. If I bring a solo ship into a system I get swarmed by locals that want to kill me.
---
Looks fun
---
you could try and bomb excavs but people will see u coming with no blackout
---
We have over 2500 characters in alliance and 90% of them actually do indeed only rat. It's the 250\~ characters that PVP that defend the rest. There's a reason why people say it's the case, as it is seen time and time again.
---
Please stop posting
---
&gt; CCP did a great job hiding their mistakes with the blackout. Now that it's ending, it's right back to broken Local chat! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've been in lowsec on and off through the blackout and local has been perfect. Seems like it messes up worst on the day of any change, then randomly afterwards.
---
Don't care if it beats bots, getting tired of this sketchy game.
---
6 factories per planet? Sounds low
---
well i live in blackout nulsec. y know without local too.. and we got statics that cant be rolled. also it last 'indefinitely'.. you got my point?
---
Like turning local back on?
---
Be fair though. "We" as a collective all want different things, and no matter what they do someone will be pissed. They've made a lot of great changes too, but they are drowned out by the negatives. Some of those changes did totally work, but either were implemented wrong or otherwise didn't have that huge a positive impact. 
---
Half the game swears blackout was good for EVE, the other half is literally cheering now that it's over. The playerbase can't ever be fully or permanently pleased, and EVE is a 16+ year old dog they're STILL managing to teach new tricks. Notice the, say, the widespread balance fixes? The visual improvements and upgrades? The (limited but still existing) alterations to innumerable things we got fed up with? The reworked NPE and tutorials? 
---
You're probably playing on a 64-bit EVE client right now. Fuck dude, that was a pipe dream of a meme for a decade and it's playable, introduced perfectly, and is in almost every way a free upgrade to stability and performance.  
---
CCP fucks up a lot but holy fuck they have a tough task. Give some credit where it's due.
---
It's not that you can't pvp without blackout it's that it's not braindead easy to get the drop on smaller groups of players.
---
Everyone says they're terrified of eve "going casual", [but on the other end...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d4ihko/hearing_the_feedback_from_people_at_eve_berlin_is/f0eaqx5/)
---
I merely explained logarithmic scaling. I’m not trying to even apply it to eve but could you not change how damage capped structures work to a new scaling damage cap?. If you changed the damage cap to a logarithmic instead of flat barrier the math would be harder but it would just be as canonically correct as it’s just made up by the devs. I’m not going to say that it would solve anything and I have been against it in the past but structure spam is real and terribly annoying.
---
Incorrect.
---
Maybe not. I know that Im naive but I would like to think theres some decency and intelligence left in us and everything isnt us - them. That people can actually put aside their differences and communicate instead of just flinging shit at eachother. 
---
Cause if we dont we just give CCP more reasons to break things and everytime it happens we lose more as a group.
---
That's what Alts are for
---
please stop thinking
---
CCP impersonation is a bannable offense
---
Would you like fish &amp; chips with that?
---
I love your enthusiasm, I just wish I could share it.
---
Notice how all the things you're mentioning as examples are technical things and not anything regarding game mechanics. That's exactly the point I'm trying to make. 
---
Sure, hurray for 64 bit client which by now are basically industry standard but what does it matter if the game running the 64 bit client sucks?
---
Nah, if they try to make retarded changes I'm not gonna just let it slide lmfao.
---
&gt; People have been trying to help CCP for ages
---
People also attempted to make CCP ~bend the knee~ when an artist released a character portrait background they didn't agree with.
---
Even though it isn't a plan at the moment, I hope that EVE grows to a healthy state where Angel capitals could become a reality.
---
How about nerf sotioys then back to 90 day cycle like the old csaa was instad of call all on bullshit on reasons like local? If ccp would not have smoked weed when they came up with sotioys and then ignored it for 2 1/2 years we would not have 800vs600 titans in the past. 
---
Build cycles for 28 days is just retarded. Same goes for copy speed and all that. It's ccp fuckd up here right from the start no1 else
---
Even tho I agree with almost everything you said, I've been reading your posts and friend, this is some nullkrab tier reeeeing right here.
---
Actually, that led us directly where we are now. I know it sounds douchy saying like "back in my day" but I watched all this unfold and see where we are now based on where we were. 
---
I remember the imbalance the tech moons caused and the joy when it was broken and then the rise of renter alliances and then where we are now. Simply splitting needed supplies around the area won't make people fight, it will actually lower it because we would need it to function and having it in a state of war hurts the supply. 
---
That's the problem with making people fight over a supply of something, someone is going to win and then that's it. That's why they had to change the moons, at a point, the tech issue was settled and there was no reason to fight anymore.
---
You're actually wrong
---
[Sorry bud](https://imgur.com/XybKEhy)
---
Its probably one of my worst traits so youre better off. Reality is like getting continously slapped in the face with a dildo, saints row style.
---
Eve online where even the devs are salty
---
It isn't a terrible idea, and I like where your head is at, but it just doesn't fit with the force multiplier mentality of eve.  Neither does structure timers to be honest, but its the game we play.  
---
Frankly I think if you show up with a fleet of titans and shoot my citadel, you should be able to pick over my smouldering carcass a few minutes later.  Thats your reward for being able to organize and execute a successful OP.  
---
On the flip side, they might give structures more teeth in general to take a few of those caps off-grid or require more than a token logi presence.  Make it less about logging in on off hours and circling a structure for 3 hours while you reinforce, and more about; "how are we going to neutralize the stations output and be able to put out enough damage to drop it."
---
Eve isn't supposed to be fair, but structure timers force a level of fairness on the mechanics of space huts.
---
We need EVE Classic with no supers.
---
It really was.  
---
If you're looking to have some fun of your own, I'm contractually obligated to tell you that Teddybears is recruiting

Now it's a party!
---
&gt; FIX THE INFINITE RESOURCE ISSUE
---
&gt; 
---
Tbf the unlimited resource thing actually did get fixed by blackout. You just gotta give the players something to *do* if they can't turbokrab 25/7 to build titans for the theoretical bloc war they might fight in 2025 against the PL-Beijing Axis.
---
The foundation is industry, we all would fly noob frigs or mission reward ships with NPC loot fitted if this game would not be fueled by our industry buddy's. 
---
PS I don't build or mine myself but I value those guys who supply our PvP needs
---
ok, cool ig
---
I too was around back then.  We had a reason to fight.  Now we have posts such as yours that are not thought through at all, trying to force fights.  
---
Here is what will happen under your plan. Krabby McKrabber will just make a punching bag alt that his guys can shoot at.  You can't require kills because face it, most people aren't getting that killing blow, to require it in order to be able to krab is asinine.  So they just have to participate in PvP, which is as simple as getting a PvP timer, which is super easy to milk.  You system is now broken.  Congratulations, people are still only krabbing, and they still have no REASON to fight.
---
People will disagree with me but I've said this before, not every alliance/corp has srp, and ships are not free, you have to pay for them initially anyway. If you are in an alliance that has srp, you still have to fork out the isk to buy that ship, and srp usually has conditions attached. 
---
You are 100% right, people need to stop hunting pve players and just go out and fight other pvp players regardless of the outcome. Pve is one of the main methods most capsuleers fund their pvp, especially if they are in a large alliance. If you constantly gank pve players they will just give up, as recent data has proven. Pvers will just stop logging in or quit.
---
Not everyone has the spare funds to buy plex to fund pvp, that is reality. Perhaps CCP should provide rewards for Pvping other than the killmail, perhaps in the form of bounties like you get for ratting. Different ships have different bounties? Just a thought.
---
You pinged him directly, tried to call him out and in doing so bashed his views and playstyle. He is an advocate for change and you are no-one. A Reddit poster with a medical profession or something. So you have invested a bit of cash into this game, he’s invested his career. Have some respect and it will go both ways.
---
&gt; Psychologically, you need to let PVE prey feel safe. You cannot totally decimate their environment and think they will live there without feeling safe again.
---
That or make it rewarding enough to PvE for a short window, for high payout, in an unsafe situation. The pursuit of total PvE safety has led nullsec to its current point of stagnation. We need ways for nullkrabs to PvE that aren't totally safe, but also don't require surviving 200 hours to make a good ROI on your rorqual.
---
infinite resources still exist.  exhibit A:  http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Q-VTWJ
---
40k kills in one system in the last 24 hours.  or to put it another way, more kills in one system that multiple other regions combined.  
---
blackout fixed jack shit other than having people not log in.
---
+1 for the pun at the end “eh”
---
Welcome back :) And easy there, tiger, that's quite a logical leap you made there.
---
so fuck anyone wanting to blops amirite
---
Hardcore and retarded are two different things.
---
Wrong about what?
---
Just because the game is over for you doesn't mean it's over for others. Quit being such a dog in a manger.
---
I don't think we need to nerf mining, I think we need to nerf multiboxing and promote active play. It doesn't need to be as intensive as super ratting, just enough so swapping from client to restart lasers is tedious enough to prevent you to have many rorquals or do it for a long time.
---
Well, the company is not a charity. After all their ad hoc changes, this one seems to have been one too far, and hit their bottom line hard. 
---
And CCP had years, and years, and YEARS to fix the broken shit. They just decided to add more and more things to the game instead of fixing things. Let's not act surprised that a hammer approach didn't go anywhere.
---
Krabs don't want middle of the road, hunters would be perfectly happy with some middle ground, but turns out krabs tantrum and go home instead of adapting like they've been telling everyone else to do.
---
-TEST blob member, saying it's a PvE game. 
---
Holy shit.
---
Lol:)
---
Thanks for proving my point:)
---
Lmfao cry more now that black out is gone! Mate you should just biomass in game or skill yourself to get better so you're less garbage and can hunt with some skill. :)
---
Anyways you dumb fuck, take a peek at those dropping player numbers  because of BO then shut the fuck up you dumb cancerous piece of shit. This game would be far better without you and dumb cunts like you.|
---
Nobody and I stress NOBODY gives a fuck what you think or what people like you think obviously since they've reverted those fucking retarded changes.
---
Go fuck yourself retard and learn to play the game instead of being a risk averse piece of shit that has to have kills fed to him.
---
But also lmfaaaaooooooo blackout is done!
---
Irony being they're still not 2nd though.
---
No. Most large nullsec alliances are treated as easy prey by highsec war-deccer's. So either you joni a small nullsec alliance, (Doesn't exist) or a competent one (heh) that doesn't get wardec'd ever or get used to alts/shitty corp history.
---
CCP has gotten to used to being able to do whatever blows there hair back while telling a certain percentage of their player base to just STFU and deal with it.  The industrial players that unsubbed did everyone a favor by demonstrating to CCP that they still have to answer to the Market Place.  Hitting the new owners in their pocketbook I imagine stirred up some serious leadership conversations.  There are plenty of healthy ideas that the CSM summit produced like those before it.  CCP should take those ideas and expand on them in order to add more sand to the sandbox and let the players play.
---
Highsec and content and war decs. You can only get 2 at a time.
---
The issue with battleship hulls now is they can't reliably apply damage to things smaller than they are in a meaningful way before they pop.  They also can't tank long enough against a capital to do anything meaningful before becoming space dust.  The problem with your idea is that you completely remove their ability to defend themselves from smaller targets, and don't have a meaningful way to protect them from HAWs.
---
Why bother with a BS, when everything else is faster, more applicable damage, and better able to defang larger targets.
---
The problem is smaller ships are able to punch up far better than battleships can punch down, and capital ships can punch down far more effectively than BS can punch up.
---
They just have no good place in the current ecosystem.
---
The sad part is that the system in wormholes aren't actually inherently good. They're just *so much better* than nullsec, that they can't help but look good by comparison.
---
Exactly this. I'm not using a blops bs or a recon to move ships i manufacture. I finished re organizing 36 cyno alts the day before ccp announced cyno changes. They were for hunting, jf cynos, logistics cynos for fueling shit and moving around pve assets, and capital/super capital moving. Also had a couple that moved blops around for sub cap pve.
---
I agree. I'm just saying that going back to the status quo is not a long term solution.
---
Find a corp that lives in a c2 with a high sec static, should be easy for you to get nullsec stuff own the chain and high sec is always available
---
BOOM! head shot!
---
I mean it used to be that those were good pockets because they had a pipe/single entry you could catch people on as they tried to get in.  It could even lead to fights, imagine that.
---
Let's say you set this to 10%. You kill a ratting domi you get 8 millions. Let's say you kill 5 of them in an hour, that's 40M. Worthless. Now let's say you do it with 3 friends. That's 10M an hour, even worse.
---
Now if you set it to 30%, it would start to mean something, then again you're not often finding 5 myrm an hour, but it still a good thing for roamers, added ice on the cake.
---
You cannot make a life on it, but that's still cool. Just need to nerf insurance so you cannot scam it.
---
GOONS went 3 years without losing a titan, and a few only died, because they were too dumb to listen to their leadership when the entirety of the alliance moved away from Delve for a month or 2.
---
CCP could just make the game the players want to play, instead of what they think we should want to play.
---
As is quite clear, you have not seen our former discussions where I pretty much implored him to stop promoting the toxic "just quit" players on this sub, he ignored it. We had quite a few back n fores and this is simply a continuation of his being unprofessional. 
---
Also note, there is a big difference, he is a paid member of CCP while I am not. I did not start any of the insults, he did.
---
Ratting is for funding other things in Eve, be it small gang, fleet pvp, other ratting ships, industry, facilities, etc...
---
People ratting for wallet dicking aren't the norm, there's not many of them.
---
Smaller groups wouldn’t need as many less to defend if they have 2 systems they maintain 2 goons would have to manage a ton of them just make being big a pain in the ass and being small convenient big groups should have the manpower to manage stuff
---
People have lots of false memories about EVE (sane in real life, people falsely remember the past as being better when in reality it sucked more than now does).
---
From day one most players of eve were pve player overwhelmingly sticking to high sec. Every time ccp would present those in game demographics at fan fest or eve Vegas it would show that.
---
PvP players and especially null sec players away overestimate the numbers of like minded people, which helps reinforce the false memory of eve being some PvP nirvana is some distant past when the truth is eve and all mmo player's tend to be risk averse at mostly afraid of PvP loses.
---
Back in the day people were asking for level 4 missions to be moved to low sec because "people stay in high because it's easy to make money there, move them to low and PvP will happen". 
---
Which was and idea every bit as stupid as "hey, let's turn off local, the krabs will play the game the exact same way as with local and totally won't quit or move to high sec, and we will get all those juicy krab kills!!!"...
---
Something, something Snuffs are killing low sec.
---
Well nothing new, I hope you guys are going to reorganize yourself in a new better way.
---
Which isn't surprising. I'd wager the average wormholer spends less time on average in highsec than the average nullseccer, so there's less exposure to random wardeccers. There's also the fact that almost every wormhole corp is small enough to be unnoticed and irrelevant outside wormholes.
---
she's hot
---
So, the last two months basically.
---
Who's sieging it? Snuffs?
---
Ditto. Small corps are better if you actually want to make friends and make a difference. Large corps offer more resources and more security but you'll quickly become Just Another Linemember.
---
Hey i used to be part of iron armada. I was in Godz-n-Monsters in fountain back in last 2017
---
The corp / alliance management needs to be easier as people burn out way too soon
---
It isn't. The only thing that makes null generating that much money is scalability. Most of the content easy with specific fits and most ships have AFK gameplay. If multiboxing wasn't a thing, nullsec wouldn't be viable with those payouts.
---
Even mining is retarded :100M/hour Rorqual ? 500m barges toping the 30-40M ?
---
That's why people left when blackout landed, unless you own a super or a rorqual under umbrellas, it is too much risk, not enough rewards, because first it prevent you from easily multiboxing, and second it takes so long to pay back a ship that even if you manage to break more than even, it wouldn't be a lot.
---
Take my upvote dear.
---
Apart from the fact that no corporation knows how to balance any video game ever that wouldn't actually be too bad of a thing really...
---
Like, EVE economics and industry but then Wargaming-Gaijin combat mechanics?
---
And, of course, they're definitely not going to compensate for the reduced payout by making more bots. 
---
Come on, man.
---
Nothing to see here.... move along....
---
So just PvP. Why even crab then?
---
Nobody ransomed CCP. Apparently some of their customer weren't happy with how CCP handled and implemented theses changes and left.
---
That's called business, not ransom. I think we don't even teach that in Economics 101 because it must be considered common sense.
---
Hitting things in 3d space would be infinitely more difficult than the 2d battlefields of WoWS.  Even hitscan weapons would be hard pressed to even the tables.  I like the pulled back tactical aspects of eve.
---
Like, when they cloak up, they are physically removed from the system? And help in some kind of Triglavian purgatory? Until they decloak again? I love this idea!
---
Thank you for pointing out what seems to have been largely forgotten.  Dominion sov was aids, the “small guy” r/eve suddenly cares about had to bash millions of EHP to take a single system.  Defensive SBUs.  The blocs with supers could do in 5 minutes what any non-bloc alliance had to do in subs for hours.  It was goddamn awful, and yes I was a part of it.
---
don't even dare to touch my local .. twitching, twitching
---
It combatted inflation because the total amount of players went down. Not a good metric for a game where you want a healthy player base.
---
Where would they disappear to though? Jovian space? Triglavian purgatory? Could work...
---
It's pretty straight forward. Piracy is death. Hang all pirates. Here is why you are safe.
---
In pure PvP games (like DOTA or Apex) you don't have to mine or kill NPCs for money and resources. EVE was never designed that way. EVE is designed to be realistic.  PVP in EVE serves a purpose, you must PVP in order to capture space. Once you have captured space, you no longer need to PVP unless someone threatens you.
---
Oh no! Not Skycrack!!! Been there..done that..oddly enough, earlier to day, I was reminiscing about my home in that city on the stone arch whose name escapes me. MIght well go like you and get on the Skycrack again. You ever play Fallout 4? Its pretty much Skyrim in the post atomic future. LOVE IT!
---
Most of that is nonsense. The problem isn't "changes bad!"...it's that they're making changes without doing the necessary planning and research to determine if they'll be good for the players. 
---
They're enacting knee-jerk reactions because they don't know what to do. They just see a problem and throw a dart at the board to try and fix it without understanding the base of the problem, itself.

but the only bad part of blackout was the ships that could be permanently cloaked.
---
&gt;and my RL time available is such that I'm not interested in investing hundreds of hours getting set up for a way-of-life (WH, Null, Lowsec, whatever) that might go "poof" at the whim of those that run EvE
---
This is exactly why people are walking due to the blackout/cyno changes
---
Tethers make sense for a POS replacement, but large and XL structures clearly go so far beyond POS.  I’m glad they finally replaced POS, but the balance was off.
---
And the guides say you will still lose ships occasionally doing L5s
---
big facts
---
You can't really say NCPL was "tied up" with the whole tribute thing, because they weren't even there for 99% of the possible fights. They had all the time in the world to go defend tenal they just didn't want that space either.
---
Sissies use blingly cloaked ships to prey on AFK players in cheap ships
---
local is fucked again people have posted about it a few times today.
---
Because any attempt to stop the push in Tenal would definitely be ignored by the CFC. I can't believe I didn't think of that
---
I still love this.
---
But it did take hilmar listening to the l33t pvp echo chamber on reddit to think it was ever a good idea in the first place.
---
that wasn't your first choice of excuse.

Because other things are more engaging.

Why does anyone do anything other than krab ever?

With  local back finally the newbros can take back Tribute, Syndicate and the  drone regions from the horrible blobbers who have moved in recently."
---
So you want to be watching your alt permanently for that 1 second that a ship isn't cloaked? Sure.
---
Really because during the entire blackout we saw threads talking about a middle ground and PVPers shouting adapt or die. Now that the shoe is on the other fought, we still see people talking about a middle ground, but its the PVP players who are leading the charge and most krabs saying ya we need to do something.
---
Even in the current middle ground threads we have PVP players saying that any middle ground is not enough and it has to be full blackout.
---
Okay that's valid yeah. Even with EVE (non-missile) weapons being basically hitscan already.
---
Is there any way to get accutate prices on abyssal modules?
---
This gives a rather unjust amount of power to covert ships.
---
Friendship is singularly *the* most powerful defensive tool in the game. 
---
It doesn't matter what offensive tools I have. I'm not going to go fuck with your shit when your easiest and most effective counter is to bring in countless friends. It doesn't matter what ships I have, and it doesn't matter what ships you have. It doesn't matter what entosis modules either of us brings. 
---
None of that matters. 
---
Your idea is a poor band-aid on symptoms of a deeper problem.
---
Okay then. Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it!🙂
---
We still camp intersection pipe systems. But nullified interceptors and cloaky nullified T3Cs really make camping hard for a lot of people if they don't have instalocking scram web ships like a daredevil with links. Even with a great instalock setup, lots of them still get through.
---
Nerf capital ability to punch down. 
---
All capital sized modules should be manually aimed in space.
---
No worries, hope that helps with understanding where BS meta is at the moment.
---
Good maybe you'll stop posting all together
---
That only eliminates half the problem and makes caps even more cancer to play.
---
Sorry man damage caps keeps some of the power blocks supers right where they are
---
Wait isn't local just going back to how it was for the other umm... 16 years?
---
Imagine the jump changes they made trying to restrict supers/carriers only made them stronger because 90% of the time there is no threat of reaction and the 10% of the time they are at risk it doesn't matter because rorquals+sotiyos allow you to replace them so fast the lose is irrelevant. lmfao
---
Not everyone has the time, and not everybody has the money. But if ratting was set up so it was automatically better as a group of individuals (mining, and killing ships) it would improve social cohesion of players and new player retention tremendously, for all regions of space. Wormholer btw...  
---
Also lawl, put in a minigame like project discovery, hacking, or bejeweled into eve for mining. Again make it so if you are within x distance of another miner, you both get a better yield or easier time yada yada.
---
They are hit-scan in the sense what we see when they go off, but they are tied to an accuracy formula that makes them miss.  Aimed properly a true hit-scan will never miss.
---
&gt;Galmil also probably has the strongest relationships to allies of the four.
---
Also, the only one with a respectable amount of sov.
---
Why not just fight other pvp fits and leave the krabs to their krabbing?
---
have you ever tried just working on being good at the game?
---
Only way people dont citadel spam is by making them so expensive which would bring you to the point no one but large groups can use them which doesn't help or you make a hard physical limit per system/consta/region.

Yeah 6 is low, you can do a lot more than that! Mine isn’t optimal and can definitely be done differently, but once this planet is done it’ll have a total of 12 factories. 4 of those 12 are pumping out robotics and the 8 others are producing the T2 stuff require to build robotics (mechanical parts and consumer electronics).

Thanks :D
---
The Onion made a Vox parody. This is an edit of that parody.
---
Bigger issues are the lack of mobility and lack of suitable targets to shoot. Battleships were kings of the meta in the time where you could park them on a POS, station, SBU, cynojammer, etc and leverage the comparatively high DPS/range/EHP to make sure said target died without exposing your dreads. 
---
Damage caps, capital proliferation, and the entosis meta completely removed that niche from them, not to mention as it turns out spending half an hour to go 12 jumps isn't exciting gameplay. Of course that doesn't change the fact that if you choose to bring a BS fleet to a large scale 2019 eve fight you'll just get absolutely shredded by fighters or oneshot by LR capital guns. People complain about HAWs way too much when it's the LR guns that absolutely dump on big, slow targets at range and helped kill the BS/BC comps.
---
But with recent changes that shouldn't be as big of a problem:
---
* No more hard cynos for either of those
---
* No more combat ceptors with nullification
---
* T3C changes a while back made it basically impossible to have a t3c insta align
---
So other than I guess a mass of Maledictions that doesn't seem like as much of an issue anymore
---
The shoe has always been on the foot of the blob member and krab. They have every opportunity to make themselves risk as little as possible. For years they were saying adapt or die, and for two months they had to adapt or die and promptly chose the "tantrum loudly" option, and immediately going full smug when they got their way.
---
The middle ground for a krab is "let us drop supers on you at any time, if for some reason we don't see you entering the region". 
---
The middle ground for a hunter is having a chance to get a kill before the cloaked/docked locals show up. 
---
Instead of doing what small corps and wormhole groups do, be on comms in fleet and nearby in order to help each other, the krabs threw a fit and played World of Warcraft until they got their way.
---
There were too many radical changes at the same time.
---
* Drifter invasion basically killed PVE for a while and put a lot of stress on nullsec. By itself, not a huge deal, but it was a terrible primer for what came next.
---
* Blackout definitely hit PVE hard. I was (and am) less than sympathetic to PVE players, but I've got to recognize that folks need to make money to pay for the ships I blow up. I still think it's the right idea but it was handled poorly.
---
* Cyno changes reinforced the negative aspects of the rest of it. Again, by itself it'd be manageable, but on top of the blackout, on top of the Drifters, it just aggravated people (including me) who were already riled up.
---
Any one of these things would have been interesting/fine by itself, and I think the blackout in particular would have been good for the game, but the combination of them all was an awful idea.
---
&gt; Nerf capital ability to punch down.
---
This I can easily agree with. I don’t think capital ships should be capable of targeting anything smaller than a battleship; the only way a dreadnought or Titan would be able to hurt anything smaller is by using a lance, reaper, or smartbomb.
---
&gt; You would know if you read my original comment, the one you 'stopped reading' because you saw something that offended your delicate sensibilities.
---
i told you i didn't read it, so why would you assume i read it?
---
also extremely easy on field refitting from acs to autocannons, whichever preferred ewar mid, etc giving a shit ton of flexibility without much issue on rigs and fitting
---
What about flying a cap is currently cancer?
---
I have my own opinions on the matter, but it would be foolish of me to project my personal views onto you.
---
I am against local, lil bro. I support delayed local or constellation chat. 
---
Rorqual is a mistake, sotyios are a mistake, current scenario for titan manufacturing is a joke. 
---
Structure spams is another joke, the fact that a massive alliance can live with 3 constellations is a massive mistake. 
---
There are so many errors to be fixed.
---
No. It's going back to how it was before the blackout. Some years ago, CCP moved the chat servers to a separate server, freeing up the load on the game server. Since that day, it has never functioned properly for an extended period. It would be fine for a week or a month then completely borked for a few days or a week. Before this change, the chat worked perfect but spamming local in a big fight would literally crash people out of the game.
---
Amen.
---
Second on that,  bombers are dirt cheap bu do tons of dps,  can insta point with fast lock and is giving invisible forever with no detection or cooldown. 150 of them jump you and you are so fucked.
---
Well that's what I feel exactly took place. For a long time, players wanted to remove local from null as it seemed too safe and too much intel to see every person logged into a system. CCP just took the opportunity when local being messed up to just turn it off and all the complaints went away with it. Now I am certain local will not work and the uproar will begin again.
---
I agree with /u/mekamoari's reply below. The most important thing is just max tank the orca except for possibly the rigs. If you're full T2 fit with strong tank people will just not bother to gank you. Here's a fit I run in highsec when I'm semi-afk

I know the midslots look... wrong for a tank build, but shield extenders actually are wrong and any fit including them is wrong. The Orca has huge natural buffer (pseudo-capital) but only battleship fitting room so resists are actually the most tank you can get.
---
Carry a survey scanner and a depot and whatever you need; whenever you're done scanning the belt just refit back to this and go watch netflix.

if this sub is any indication of the average player, it's quite trivial

Yeah it sure was a blast watching the player count race the lowest numbers we've seen this decade.

Pretty sure that the cyno changes will do more to protect the little guy.

You need to rewatch the video.

That's worse than blackout was for pve'ers. After looking at the pcu drop, I think that's the opposite of what we need.

https://zkillboard.com/ship/41030/stats/

when did blackout start?
---
You realize why blackout was so poorly received, right? 
---
People could fly cloaky ships around with impunity, getting easy kills on any subcapital that dared to undock, and blopsing on top of any capital that tried it, although those could sometimes be saved with cynos. 
---
With your change, all of the power imbalance towards cloaky bs is kept, but they also get easy intel on who else is in system. If anything, it would cause the PCU to drop even faster than blackout did

&gt; No.

"Piracy is death" - death to whom? To the pirate, to the pirated? Literally what does this mean? Why say this instead of saying "piracy is *dead*" or "piracy is *dying*"?
---
"Here is how we are improving" - what? who is we? also improving what?
---
"Hang a pirate today" - you're calling to go fight pirates which don't exist because piracy is dead?  
---
It may seem straight forward to you but the poster really doesn't make sense to anyone else.
---
I think the analogy speaks for itself.  Cancer is a cell that no longer obeys the "rules" of the cellular lifecycle.  
---
I feel that capitals were once this scarce resource that was meaninful and impactful when used on the field and hurt an alliance terribly when one was wasted.  Jumping instead of bridging.
---
Now they clog the spaceways and hearing about titan/mom (even supposedly rare faction variants) losses in null are an everyday and common occurrence.
---
It's intentionally vague for a reason. Lots of room for interpretation. For example, death to pirates, death to those who are caught by pirates, death to piracy.

Don't hurt yourself. Grammatically, you are still incorrect.

The issue is excavs and the absurd bonus they get from rorqs, just delete excavs, apply a reduced bonus to regular mining drones so rorqs are not completely useless yet no longer OP and the mining amount problem solves itself, And helps solve the cap proliferation problem. Everyone has caps because they are cheap, and caps are so cheap because you can solo mine them in a day or two with a handful of rorqs.
---
Finally someone said it straight up like it fucking is..

are u joking

---
lol blackout was like chopping off everything below the waste, the pvp crowd tried to pretend they didn't mind being just a torso but the bean counters at PA weren't having it.
---
the money of mass multiboxers and botters
---
CCP made their own bed. Players warned against a lot of these poor changes far in advance. (Not talking about blackout and such, more like citadel issues, rorqs, skill injectors, time zone tanking, damage caps, etc ) CCP were warned of the issues and chose to ignore them. Then once they issue had spiraled out of control to being basically unfixable, they decided to do something about it. It's too late, you can't fix Citadel, Capital, Super-capital proliferation. You can't unfuck the market from mass rorqs and skill injectors and years of unchecked botting. 
---
Eve was an amazing game, but this is it's final few years. I left with the cyno announcement because it shows how little CCP still know about their own game. The ability to drively drive engaging content on a daily basis is beyond difficult, especially when compared to a few years ago. If CCP wants to fix this game, they need to create solid content drivers and ability for players to take meaningful footholds. Which CCP clearly doesn't know how to do.
---
It's sad to watch, but I'm glad I left. I don't want to watch the game die croaking. Good luck to those of you left, I hope you find some joy in this game still.

I get that you want to whine and complain about the blackout, but toss some scouts on your stargates. It's really not hard.
---
&gt;but CCP obviously doesn't based on what we saw. **These players who quit may never come back and if then, only some will**

  You could say the same for the people who jumped back in for PvP after being unsubbed for years. Now we're back to uber safe krab lands.
---
&gt; so can all the ratters please stop quitting

  Implying that's the reason why it's being "rolled back"

It's nothing to do with pretending, the game needs drastic changes to prevent a repeat of serenity.

Likewise.
---
Go cry in your frigate about how the big bad ships can shoot you when you think they shouldn’t fight back
---
I'm sorry but you are just wrong and that isn't my opinion its a fact. lol.
---
Fair point. A mechanical change to the aiming of capital weapons doesn't immediately reduce their numbers. 
---
But I hope that it puts a soft cap on the demand for capitals. My assumption here is that there will be a number of people that simply decide that pointing guns in space, then re-pointing them when the target moves, and moves again... is too much effort. And that these people then downship to subcaps. 
---
To me, a frigate is a small three-gun ship. It targets things, and you press F1 to shoot.
---
A dreadnought is a big three-gun ship. It targets things, and you press F1 to shoot. But this time, it teleports, and sieges in place. It a big frigate that requires *less* manual piloting skill. 
---
They're mechanically close enough that ability to fly a subcap automatically translates into ability to fly a capital. There's no surprise to me that everyone moves into capital ships. 
---
Because of this, I don't believe *any* change to tank, damage, application, cost, or mining rate will fix the problem.
---
I used to play eve and it's been almost a decade but I follow the sub, because I may get back into it.

TIL the game was created in 2013 and not 2003 and that is less than 1/3 of the life of the game and that people just didn't get by before 2014 when burners were added.
---
&gt;there was also fwar, incursions, both of which outpace anom ratting 2-8x more.
---
None of these things have anything to do with local. 
---
&gt;your argument is pointless
---
This is you right now.
---
I mean you have fun your way, but in my opinion dropping blops on miners and ratting domis is a waste of my time and jump fuel.
---
Therein lies the problem, we have a rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock balancing act going on, and capitals are the glue people keep sniffing in the corner.
---
Eve needs a marketing push. Everyone outside the game STILL thinks it is completely unapproachable, or a giant spreadsheet.

---
Eh, jump freighters and caps, otherwise you end up moving allot of subcaps by gating. Also, wormholes, 9/10 if i need to bring something from high sec into nullsec its through a wormhole not a jump freighter. jump fuel is expensive.
---
There should be better reasons for a buff or nerf than the ones designers sometimes come up with. Popularity or unpopularity isn't good enough, because IRL some weapons are great and others are shit. There's a whole YT channel (Forgotten Weapons) devoted to some of the ones that were shit.
---
I'm thinking here of nerfs like the one that hit Battlefield 3 when reddit and DICE decided that too many people were rolling with the M16A3. Which was a fine weapon, but nowhere near so overwhelmingly correct in all situations as to rule out the use of everything else. The trouble was, there was no credible buff to some of its alternatives that could make them fully competitive. (I'm thinking here of the AK series, whose primary IRL advantages, simplicity and reliability, couldn't be modeled in the BF3 context — a real problem for a slow-ROF weapon in a high-ROF meta.)  So DICE responded by messing up the M16A3's aiming a bit to make it a bit less lethal.
---
Or take World of Tanks (please). The developers aren't allowed to nerf premium tanks, which people pay for and are thus governed by consumer-protection rules. So they if they decide one's OP they have to pull it from sale entirely. (The E25 and T-59 are  the signature examples; I joined the game too late to get a T-59 but enjoyed my cockroach long after it was removed from the store.) But even so, premium tanks with their fixed characteristics gain and lose favor as the meta changes around them.
---
There's an existing gameplay style referred to as "cloaky camping" in which one or more hunters sit around in CovOps cloaked Bombers or T3 Cruisers, and wait for someone to jump into a system, break gate cloak, and then they decloak and instakillthem. It's a playstyle generally hated by most people who aren't cloaky campers. Making CovOps cloaking block Local would be seen as giving too much additional power to these campers, who are already perceived as having too much power.

I don't know how to interpret that response. Not sure if you're indirectly agreeing or disagreeing with me. 
---
Either way, I had a good giggle at the metaphor. Take the upvote.
---
Either he really believes this and is delusional or has walked the narrative so far down the train tracks that there is no coming back.
---
Hey guys, I just started. I like to passively mine while I do homework or talk to my wife and I want to get into production. But like... what on earth am I suppose to be doing? What’s my goal? I’m just gathering right now? Should I be following missions? Finding people to play with and moving somewhere? I’m just kinda lost.
---
Having imported mongoo from the North, and exported my excess from the South, I'm extremely confident you're wrong.
---
Tell ya what, where exactly is this land of milk and honey and every moongoo?
---
I eagerly await your "you just have to go find it" answer, since you'd have some trouble actually naming it.
---
tbh i'm more mad that I have to refit an assload of ships across all of my goddamn supers titans and caps than anything.
---
It's big like the Hood but doesn't blow up like the Hood. It's more like an Iowa than anything else — fast, sturdy and lethal.
---
good guys win again
---
Aight dude. Just trying to help.
---
Didnt these guys get caught botting?
---
Move the U in UNO and you have NO U
---
Yeah we won’t look for contests, but if tdf tries to follow us in, we don’t back down. Got a good win rate.
---
After my fight with your executioner, I've really loved flying ab+point+web shit! Not purely kitey maybe, but man, a speedy web kiter even gets to warp in on stuff like a merlin and pull enough range to win the dos race before getting webbed. And it fucking wrecks non-mwd stuff with positional advantage or scram kiters if they're not a speedy atron.
---
I've left eve because of the recent changes, I'm a player of 13 years, started off carebear miner, went to pvp, became a shit teir FC, and then 50/50 carebear'd to pvp. 
---
I still enjoy reddit and trolling people watching what new bombs are going on with eve. But lets face it the last time I actually enjoyed this game was when it was sub based only, CCP had an obviously dedicated staff to making new content, a team to fixing bugs, and a team to balance/rebalancing. 
---
There used to be a 'expansion' (free with your sub) every 6 to 12 months. Red moon rising for example added super caps into the game. I'm talking great tools, more content. more ways to make money and destroy each other in the sand box.
---
Not only have the real woild costs to reasonably play gone up and ccp going insane with the nerf bat because of social/over optimization of the stagnant game, There's no new content.
---
Citadels (which are arguably the worst thing added to the game next to plex/injectors imo) are a rework of Pos's .. that took what? 3 years and they'll still bug fixing?
---
Rebalance and class pass / terracides are considered major content passes on the game, 'Major rebalance/rework and artwork updates to wormholes coming' .. that's not content bub. 
---
So I'd of probably played the game for another 10 if it's still around but CCP did the mistake of making me go outside.
---
Well frankly they would have to make and deliver on some starcitizen type of BS promise for content and new toys to have me seriously consider resubbing. and I'm seriously doubting either of those things will happen in Eve-Online until the servers eventually go dark.
---
Game was 'ok' .. people were amazing tho..  probably what I miss the most.
---
PS. 
---
Cancelling next Eve - Vegas was a huge mistake. Even if people don't buy your flagship product (or goto eve vegas) its still an aspiration for hard core game fans, removing that is stupid and although local meets are 'easier' to get to, if the house party naked BBQ in a steam room user meet was any indication, it looks more like a support group than an actual event I'd want to goto :P
---
[Sorry but you will only get to have the last word on THIS](https://www.cardkingdom.com/images/magic-the-gathering/2011-core-set/redirect-8229-medium.jpg)
---
Sure while we are talking about CCP spending dev time on something. Blackout cloak- removes user from view and local. While active all concord services go dark. Everything. No chats, fleets, maps, cannot activate gates, no overview, nothing. 20 second weapons/module cooldown while ship reestablishes link to fluid routers.
---
I was inspired.  I agree with you.  I don't think blanket nerfs are the direction we should go.
---
[I have had enough of thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=414370&amp;type=card)
---
This is a common suggestion, and you don't think that CCP has considered doing something along these lines as a compromise?  My assumption is that real 'delayed local' likely just can't be implemented mechanically in the game with the current chat system they have, it's either all-or-nothing (or broken, as we have often seen recently).
---
For years nullsec has said all these changes are bad.
---
For the Guristas? Intuition by Jewel.
---
Actually, the pvp gate is available starting at T3 and you can run those with a much cheaper ship than 2bil.
---
Let me say welcome to the game, hop in and make some friends, join a corp, lose some ships and have a good time.  
---
Also, I advise getting the fuck away from this subreddit before the toxic bullshit drags you down into the depths of abyssal dogshit.
---
I believe the MO is stilll CHAOOOSSSSSSSS!!! =)
---
First thing first Game is free if you want to experience the game just download it and try the tutorial but the game actually does not start until u join a corporation(your clan) .  Best thing is u know what u want to do thats protect your people and war so its better for u to join a Null sec corporation cause they try to save their ppl and their space and goto war over territory.
---
“Also, I advise getting the fuck away from this subreddit before the toxic bullshit drags you down into the depths of abyssal dogshit.” Wdym? And ships are bound to be destroyed right? And what’s fastest way to make money?
---
Well played, keep em coming
---
I recommend you keep moving, friend. We're all dying here.
---
[Reusing stuff is taking this too far](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/1f/95/3b1f9541943e428c7feed416ee6e766f.jpg)
---
What are the sectors of the games? And how does that work? So if you join the corps do they pay and provide a ship or do you have to earn that stuff?
---
What game do you recommend?
---
This sub is garbage for anything other than an echo chamber of anti-ccp shit posts.  Best way to make money is to get in the game and play.  Find your fun, find a way to profit from it, and keep going.  Some folks like to orbit rocks and mine ore.  Other folks like to orbit ships and mine items, and still others like to orbit players and mine tears.  It depends on you my dude.
---
But seriously, run.
---
didn't you use to multibox?
---
This is what I mean.
---
Great ideas, lets also take away bounties and make the rats in null drop "blue loot" of some kind.
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
Unless you want to sit on plexes and make a little ISK while you wait for content to come to you (which you probably don't need to do) I'd stay neutral, although you could just have 2 alts, one in each and do this in your target systems, and kill anyone that thinks it safe to piggyback of your plex
---
1. High sector defended by npc
---
2. Low sec defended by npc but to very less defree and mainly solo and small gang pvp happens here
---
3. Null sec lawless space owned literally by people who are country level entities
---
4. Wormholes spooky space thats toooobrandom for new player to be in and too much risky but fun at same time 
---
No they dont pay u they just give u a space and people to have fun with. U have to earn everything urself after a while till u understand what u want to do in game. Game gets boring until u find ur best way so just understand not everyone likes all types of gameplay 
---
For example : 
---
1 mining 
---
2 exploration - hacking boxes to get loot in space that spawn randomly
---
3 kill npc sites to get bounties
---
4 market manipulation
---
5. Manufacturing using bluenprints - need little money inhand to buy nlueprint but ammunation is a good place to start
---
I see what you mean.
---
Thank you
---
Hes kidding this game has been dying since 2003 . It never dies just some bad decision but jow they solved the issue today so many more players will be back
---
But it’s true?
---
That's a reuse? Fine. Give me a minute to find the Azorius version from the original Ravnica.
---
I mean if you were remotely decent at the game the local change wasn't really much of an impact.
---
I believe NC. went there to look for content.
---
lol ))
---
You’re only going to catch the odd retard gating though. We don’t rat or mine there, cept maybe a couple hairlips
---
On the one hand I don’t approve of others bearing up on the mentally challenged. But on the other hand, it is Dumpster Co.
---
Yes  sounds about right
---
They won't work with us so why work with them? They don't listen to our voices so the easiest way to share our opinion is to just unsub.
---
exactly. This would have made blackout better.
---
what about my wrong?
---
The lone wolf cloaky campers that I saw everyday before blackout are still around and still avoid a fight that's risky. They still just go for the easy ganks and it is easier for them under blackout.
---
The Brunnen-G song comes to mind.
---
Well, i guess they would know you were there by losing all the services.
---
So I would say go join one of the following:
---
Karmafleet
---
Brave Newbies
---
Pandemic Horde
---
They are pretty good about engaging new players and you will learn more about the game than if you hung out in Hi Sec and did the new player experience.
---
that would require the devs spend time making a new item and making sure it works, don't think CCP is up for that everyone is already busy remaking the NPE for the 10th time.
---
Love that game. Truly is the EVE of shooters lol
---
Serenity can't happen if you kill off the player base first.
---
And even the slowest group and sites are still going to be ~80-100m isk/hour + Concord LP.
---
of course its true, but that wasn't the excuse given, the first excuse they went with was we were already busy fighting, when in fact they weren't fighting.
---
Hehe, in support of your comments this whole PIRAT fleet was on grid for just the Impel. You know, in case it fights back lol.
---
As long as you can disperse tachyon particles through the deflector array and decloak them.
---
He literally capitalized the word “paid” in the very next sentence lol
---
Why not just use dovin's veto? only 3 CMC instead of 4
---
To be honest other than BO helping the lone wolf type campers that I saw everyday before BO, it hasn't been that bad. Do I get aggravated at the mechanics of it? Yes, I do from time to time but I will continue to adapt every time a change comes around.
---
 Personally I kind wish they would change it to some variable minutes of no local once you enter system. That would make it more even for both sides. Other than that game on and fly dangerous.
---
Because the one I'm thinking of draws a card for each counter.
---
AND DO YOU SEE THE VALUE UP THERE?
---
If you mean of January, I doubt that will happen. Recovery of the majority of the lost players is unlikely. The cyno changes are still in. While cyno changes of some sort were likely more important to long term viability than blackout, this specific change will be hated as well. More losses may be in store for the future. With the first week of cynogeddon being one where supers and titans were told not to rat we have not likely seen its full effect on player counts.
---
I think you are confusing 'Piracy' with 'pussy-coward-gate-camping-for-indys'.
---
Just a thought...
---
Underrated comment.  
---
If CCP can just do this much..
---
That's not what I said. I said they weren't comparable. The effort it takes to have a 10 man gang roam, scout, and find targets isn't comparable to some fucking moron that only has to activate one module and suddenly 40 ships appear with no delay, threat, or possible way to retaliate in 2019, especially under an umbrella.
---
So, none of those tengus fought back at all? Wtf?
---
Ironic coming from someone with that flair who couldn't be arsed to even try to defend their shit.
---
Says the saltiest of wormholers
---
&gt; As soon as they appeared this absolutely haunting female vocal starts singing a dirge and it was chilling in a way this game hasn't been in a long while. Having something sing a hauntingly beautiful tune to you over a radio while they do their best to kill you is creepy AF, on top of creepy blood raiders.
---
C'mon man, you can't post that and not give us a link, can you?
---
Wait why didn't this apply when you were all quitting because you couldn't see local? all you got was 'waaaaaaaaaaaaah the health of the game" and "waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah my playstyle" posts from cocksuckers like you.
---
I was being cheery.
---
https://i.imgur.com/V0l2ZSW.mp4
---
Caring about karma lmao
---
This is my general reaction to wormholers
---
You've clearly never lived in a deep wh. If there's no connections there's no connections man.. that's it. It's not a matter of what else can we do.. that is what we do..  
---
Honestly if they killed rolling whs is probably be a hs carebear and quit in a month. Whs would be cancer without rolling and not just the cloaky kill you all the time kind. You get a bad connection there is nothing to do that day simple as that. Or log an alt. Give it a week of this and whs will be empty.besides day trippers.
---
&gt;Like for fixing it how about more incentives to not just sit in a single region? Like Goons literally built an empire without having to leave the super range of their Staging.
---
You don't want Goons to have to take more space.  Because they will and will be able to make it as secured as Delve.
---
You need them smashed into Delve so that there's lots of other space for other groups.  Because you need more groups in null to get more friction which leads to more wars.
---
If the Blocs have to own the map to feed themselves, they will own the map.
---
Because they screwed up the chance.   
---
They are trying to get back all the people that hit the road, and you don’t do that with a partial walk back.  You do that by completely reversing the thing that pissed everyone off, and then start with discounts for omega and another ‘SP week’ of free stuff...and hoping that people have confidence that CCP will not just turn around and screw up some other aspect of their game play.  
---
My money is that they will not want to touch local again till everyone has forgotten about it.  What I really wonder though is if this left them too gun shy to actually change some helpful things.  
---
Time will tell.
---
Its krab logic. it doesn't need to make sense for them.
---
If ccp don’t make money they won’t have a company.
---
well you're the one whoring so...
---
"You can't really multibox 15 PvP accounts..."
---
The lie detector determined, THAT was a lie. -Maury
---
There are ***multiple*** CODE./Goon 25-man broadcast-inputs run by solo players. But CCP sees $$$ from 25 accounts and ignores their EULA. They are simply shady and unethical AF. There is no real leadership at CCP. Just a bunch of drunk Icelanders who embarrass their viking fore-fathers.
---
Galmilistan lol
---
Just do what the 'elites' do. Join one, then when you have basically everything conquered, join another, or create another toon for their rival.
---
&gt;I have seen nothing similar in blocs like test or goons.
---
It's way less effective when every hunter has a spy in your alliance.  
---
The spies will get their ships properly named way faster than the linemembers.
---
You could do with losing maybe one chromosome
---
It absolutely did. What this blackout episode showed was that the vocal minority who wanted elite/small gang pvp on easy mode were just that - a minority. The casuals and pve-ers turned out to be the majority. What can you do - money talks.  
---
Also, again, swing and a miss on what you infered. Your flailing game has plummeted since the days when you were a space somebody =/
---
Depends on how hard they made it to deploy the structures.  They don't have to be hard-to-build.
---
I meant the ship with the blackout module goes dark.
---
Once the queue ends does that fleet keep grinding though or is it one run then queue again ? :/
---
Very sciency
---
CCP will what they want to do because they have their data and they know better. Same old story.
---
First of all, my "assholes on comms" are friends I go out drinking with once a month. EVE is a social game, I've made good friends and others have help each other out in IRL when shit gets tough (players have helped each other get a job or cope with a loss).  
---
Second, I'm sorry that you are a hypertension snowflake who can't just play a game like a normal adult, but most other people can play this game for fun.  
---
Third, you don't have to play this game around the clock like a second job. In fact, as a prior recruitment director, I've clearly stated that we do not endorse that type of behavior. IRL always comes first, as much as I love EVE it's still just a game. Don't blame other EVE players because you where in a bullshit corp that took the game too seriously.  
---
Your "truth" is a few edge cases which do not remotely describe the accuracy of EVE.
---
But I was told goons aren't affected by these things, just the little guys. 
---
What is it goons? Are you the victims or are you immune to things?
---
SO quick question. If you designed a game and it was making you money and made changes to it costing you money? You would be ok with that? Last time I checked CCP wants to make money. So they made a change that cost them an amount of money they found unacceptable and reverted it like most smart business people would do.
---
  Mind you I don't have a dog in the fight on either side of this as I don't fly in a Sov holding alliance and I don't own caps. I also don't go out looking for random fights. I live in my little piece of space and do all sorts of things.
---
  If the game as you see it is that poorly designed for your play style find one that better suits you or Buy EVE and make it your way.
---
How they are at war every day is even more amusing when you think their leader at one time was caught botting 6 nyxes to pay for it all.
---
Space was empty before blackout. People were consolidating into bigger and bigger blue blobs long before blackout.
---
Exec does scram kite really well. You can also go tormentor and double web ab (no scram!) and it works too. Just   make sure you're over 200 dps, ideally closer to 250 with the drones.
---
It can be in the background with the sound on looking at the gate...or on a second screen so you can see activation out of your peripherals. Not all ships are cloaky, either. Out of the hundreds of ships in-game, only a handful can warp cloaky
---
The large cap battles were happening less often even before the cyno changes. Everybody has a massive super fleet that you're not gonna escalate because then you'll just lose everything.
---
Posts from krab nullblob members such as you, crying about the little guy that they never want to be or join.
---
But it's a pve game according to you, why should you care about em?
---
Eww no why?
---
You are paying out the nose for those P1 import/export costs unless you own the Poco. Export P2's once, then dump all the P2's into a factory planet if you want to make P4's.
---
15 man krab accounts give CCP 15 times more money than 1 man hunter accounts.
---
Join a a null corp with a strong industrial group. 
---
Do production in wormholes if you want to be a baller.
---
In addition to the CSM, many other folks make useful suggestions in the forums. It's squeezed between piles of shitposts, but they are there. For some reason, CCP has not been very good at taking this feedback into account, and have pushed changes out haphazardly.
---
Goons are an entity not a person.
---
Let's get this straight. The blackout was reversed not because it didn't do what it was intended to do, but because this community is full of no risk pve players that simply couldn't adapt. The irony of it all is that they are the first ones to tell everyone else to adapt when changes benefit them. 
---
Just so you understand... the Goon anti-blackout campaign also played a role as they screamed the loudest.
---
Generally once you're 'on grid' (i.e. off the waitlist/queue and running sites) you stay on grid until the fleet stands down/you have to leave. The fleets themselves just warp directly from site to site as fast as possible - which is why some smaller groups specify hyperspat rigs for their vanguard ships, because the ratio of site time to warp time is low enough to make it worthwhile.
---
Well, it took 3 years and 6 different nerfs to rorquals for them to get close to listening to the CSM there. So, if they could work on that reaction time a bit.
---
Clearly not.
---
What reason do they have to do anything else?
---
CCP is allowed to have their own bad ideas. Just because reddit also has the same bad ideas doesn't mean CCP can't use them.
---
Maybe, maybe not.  "Keep the lights on" mode is pretty damn cheap.
---
Of the MMOs that are 15 years old or older, half are still running.  'Cause it's really cheap to just keep the servers on and toss out some minor gameplay and graphics tweaks every year.
---
Assuming you are not an outright troll, what you just described is NPC nullsec, and it does already exist.
---
You can stay as long as you'd like, or until the fleet stands down. Sometimes it'll go all day, sometimes its a few hours, then down again.
---
Normally it's pretty consistent that one or both of the groups I fly with are up if I want to fly.
---
WTF did I just watch?
---
No more dangerous than doing anything else while in faction warfare.
---
So would you think for example an AC Loki or HAM loki would be better?
---
Sure. Blame us for local coming back. Friendly reminder that Delve thrived during the blackout while the rest of null sec was dead.
---
If you are going throw shade atleast study.
---
"This will happen if you do this..."
---
Say the people with enough influence to set that narrative, especially if they knew it was coming.
---
Something we all agree on? Have you ever tried to get 5 people to pick a place for lunch? I think you may need to tone it down to a more realistic level of expectations.
---
Everybody's idea is a good idea. Just ask them.
---
[WHAT?
---
](https://i.imgur.com/qKRkmlF.gif)
---
You're kidding right?
---
I 100% loved the blackout - but I dont PvE at ALL. I just buy isk rather than doing EvE's horrible PvE (exploration is ok, but I still have a ton of better gaming options than it), and I STILL thought it was a bad idea. 
---
Here's the thing - even if I don't like it, a lot of people do like mining and ratting and such, and if you make it so that their activity isn't profitable any more because of risk, you know what they do? Quit. 
---
Find the other post right now about finding ways to incentive PvE'ers to PvP and you'll get some good ideas (making PvE fits the same as PvP would be a start). Because driving them away just hurts all of us.
---
Make it so you show up in local once you speak, target lock (or attempt to target lock) someone, or get target locked.
---
Nothing you said is true. Goon leadership was pro blackout but accurately predicted what would happen.
---
The risk averse players are the ones running around in covert ops only during blackout. They wanted uncatchable undetectable ships with no counter play.
---
It probably has a lot to do with the fact that many of us who have been playing for 15 years now have families, real jobs, and obligations that mean we can't play 12h/d every day waiting for content to come to us.
---
Right or wrong, that's probably the cause of what you've identified.
---
NC needs an easy morale deployment :P
---
Its been turned on in wormholes a few times.
---
I agree they should remove excavs :)
---
with current changes, that went well :)
---
Did you make sure to mention that your alliance makes up a third of the c5 krab kartel?
---
I mean, any 5-3 you go into is gonna have a whboo citadel. Any c6 worth living in has a hard knocks or lhawx farming citadel and every decent hole worth living in through c5 space is held by a farmalt or already well established Corp. 
---
Exo, we used to fight that problem together when we lived in c6. And now you’ve enabled it.
---
Incarna.
---
have you seen probable bot shift to hisec? its same old again, people should ADAPT tp YOUR playstyle. thats just full of s*it.
---
Spod: not even once.
---
and if y9u ever start playing, remember game takes years so no rush. Unless you pay your way in ofc
---
The set it to 15% and not the hulls worth but the entire ship kill a 2 bił rattle you get 333 mil rating Domis are around 200-350 so you get 30 - 58 mil
---
It's not like any of this required convincing someone to do something they wouldn't otherwise do.
---
Rorquals are a pretty good design if you have like 2 or so of them.  They break when you can run 20....and the CSM warned CCP that their players would be running 20 before CCP brought them out of the POS.  They didn't have to go to their alliances after the changes and say "Everyone must get 20 Rorqs!!".
---
Citadels would be a very good design if everyone was in a mid-size corp.  They'd be a significant asset, and you just wouldn't have the cash to sprinkle them everywhere.  But the blocs aren't mid-size corps, and can totally break the system without having to order everyone to break the system.
---
You're not wrong. That's my point. So the choice unfortunately may fall to either make a shitty profitable game or a good game that makes less money.
---
Some people breaking rules doesn't mean most do. But my point stands. Exceptions confirm the rule.
---
No you don't understand it's only bad when ratters/miners multibox!
---
shut up retard
---
they aee still half assed but in a way yes
---
Yeah dude risk in Eve online imagine that.
---
There's a reason throwing changes at the wall to see what sticks is a bad way to run a game.
---
Krab tears pay the bills. It's an era of people who spent $5,000 on Farmville, got bored, and went and spent another $5,000 on Farmville Clone 1.
---
Speaking of paying the bills. I'm not sure how well CCP is doing, but from what it looks like, they have a few less than zero competent devs, the game balance team has completely lost touch with reality, and worst of all they simply do not understand the game. I can't wait for them to ignore the CSM proposals again. Hopefully we'll see goons+tapi formally blue one another and eradicate all life in nullsec this year to get this sinking fucking ship down and over with.
---
No I haven't convinced myself i'm anything. Merely doing pve doesn't make one a "krab." One is a krab if they want to make Eve into a farmsville roller coaster theme park ride game.  
---
I've spent most of my game time with small and medium alliances usually on the outskirts of the big empires. I've had alts in Imperium, I joined NCdot for a while (yuck), I've done the BL munnin thing. Since 2011 I've done pretty much every kind of pvp you can think of. I've done plenty enough of scouting and everything in between.  
---
"Who the fuck cares about your opinion." Well who the fuck cares about yours? That's not an argument.  
---
Oh boohoo it's so hard to have a citadel in every system, a cyno for a super cap blob to come save you, multiple structures to make your space safe and now local again to tell you the moment any of those naughty pvpers show up. So tough.
---
 *Maybe our player representation will have heavier weight with their feedback on things seeing how the cause and effects played out precisely as the CSM candidates anticipated.* 
---
Well Almost all of them.
---
My kingdom for a middle ground of Constellation chat or Region chat.
---
If your game is spiraling downhill, throwing random shit at the wall to see what sticks is not the correct way to fix it either.
---
I don't get it, why ppl complain about krabbers? You want pvp there is plenty in FW and plenty of fleet vs fleet action in the hot regions of nullsec. Ganking solo afk krab player is not real pvp, it's not that different from killing an NPC.
---
A working bounty system?
---
And then they announced they were keeping blackout.
---
And now they've announced "oh shit, our PCU is way down."....I mean that they're cancelling blackout.
---
I agree, but I also think that fueled structures should only have two timers. Why?
---
In the POS days, if you showed up with a fleet to hostile space and they didn't fight you, you'd just start RF'ing all their shit. Sure it was a little tiresome if you were on that fleet op, but it essentially guaranteed that when that timer expired, you could come back and either kill an asset, get a fleet fight, or both. You were always one annoying grind away from setting up guaranteed content in some form or another.
---
With THREE timers, there is no motivation to take your fleet and say "fine, if they're not gonna fight, we're gonna fuck up their shit," because you'd have to come back a second time up to a week later, and they can ignore that timer as well.
---
Indeed, this has been suggested by some. That the load was too much so they just got rid of a whole bunch of chat channels that were local. And they are pretty frickin' broken for some players today too, which is interesting given it's supposed to revert back tomorrow, so they are prob plugging things back in.
---
I can see why NC would be upset. For a while there not undocking was the new meta
---
&gt; I remember when we'd provoke fights from TEST by bubbling the warp from their jump bridge to 6VDT station
---
Goddamn, I remember doing this same thing in 6VDT when I was in Waffles. /u/lelob_from_eve did a thing where he'd tackle with an alt and kill them w/ an unprobeable Tengu, it was dope
---
Only the first one manage to put the stratios in half armor and the last one tried only to escape.
---
That honestly depends on your taste. If you were getting into Eve for the MMO experience there are obviously tons of MMOs out there and I don't really feel right recommending any one over the others. If you wanted Eve for the science fiction aspect, there are a slew of games in that genre from multiple universes. If you want ship-based combat I would recommend World of Warships or War Thunder hands down. If you just wanted go old PvP action, I recommend any MOBA or one of this quick-que games. Really, I'd need to know why you considered Eve in the first place to recommend an alternative.
---
So there's these ships called Jump Freighters.  You can use them to move your shit out of the citadel in the week or more that it is under attack.  Alliances even have services where they will carry your shit in a Jump Freighter for you.
---
Ok so lets see, numbers were around 25k before the black out, 15k after the black out (best times), so that means about 10k people didn't feel like playing. 
---
First, thats less than half, second, what happens to you farmers when the other part of the game fucks off?
---
Oh right the same thing that happened to us when you all fucked off. 
---
Games fucked bud, you're all too selfish to give any ground and the PVP crowd gave ground for 5 fucking years as they layered safety after safety.
---
You're fucked.
---
Also way to instantly abandon the argument and start attacking the poster, its a sweet dead give away that you know you're wrong.
---
Lambs? Please. Pay attention to intel and you're fine. Use fleets and you're fine. D-Scan and you're fine. You rather have zero risk as opposed to some risk? Just adapt bro. Wtf? Lol
---
This comment chain is /r/bestof material
---
It shouldn't have been, but it's been that way for so long that it's the name of the game at this point. It's a feature which has drawn in players like myself. When the removed it, we left.
---
TFW you believe in a 45k person conspiracy.
---
&gt; What was it that brought players in during 2008-9 and has been making them leave since 2013-4
---
In 2008-2009 you could do any number of PvE activities with *one account* for *even less time* and be able to afford to PvP every day. 
---
With inflation and the number of alt accounts rising, the average player with only one or two accounts gets discouraged by the sheer number of hours needed to stay financially solvent.
---
I can MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
But seriously, he didn't display the name and didn't know who it was either.  Solo female vocalist singing something vaguely latin in a very creepy fashion.
---
Lmfao if pandemnic legion is dropping 200 ships and supers on you then you're doing it wrong and deserve to lose those rorqs. Anyone who lost one deserved it, it took no effort to provide at least some level of safety.
---
Feeding ganks to anyone who can find a Covert Ops cloak isn't a good game.
---
Don't get me wrong, things need to change.  But this change was not a good idea.  It needed a host of other changes along with it as part of  a larger plan.
---
I see that the Grr Goons train really has no brakes
---
What kind of forces are we dealing with, who are they and how much do you pay?
---
I guess it depends on what you think null is. The reality is that null is there for people to build empires and part of that is having peace. There is nothing wrong with null being safe, if anything the fault is with high-sec being so inherently unsafe.
---
&gt; Capitals should never be efficient in fighting against subcaps
---
The number of times I've had to reiterate to people on nano fleets that "if that dread even gets a glancing blow or 'barely scratches,' you are still fucking dead" is insane
---
It's just not even intuitive. You're orbiting a HAW dread at 50 in an interceptor and after 10 misses he gets a "lucky" glance and pop, you're dead.
---
people have been predicting the obvious outcome to ccp's dumb decisions for over a decade or more.
---
that has never made them stop and think, why would that chagne now with a management layer that has never seemed so out of touch?
---
I don't want to say who publicly. I can get the Intel on what they were flying to reinforce. I am trying to figure out the going rate to see if it's worth.
---
maybe they should invest in a person to tell them what that data means.
---
cos they don't seem to know, given the choices they make - despite it being super obvious to almost every observer going. 
---
like, chat died and the pcu dropped off a cliff - it wasn't hard to predict that intentionally turning chat off would drop the pcu off a cliff in an identical manner.
---
Bow before The Queen of Rancer
---
&gt; It’s like null was turning into a forest full of invisible wolves
---
Over the past month, every time we caught someone I couldn't help but think "I cannot believe someone would actually undock to PvE out here like this"
---
must be mildly autistic
---
!remindme 7d
---
The rate is relative to the details of the operation, give more detail for a better defined rate.

---
Just because they're separate activities doesn't mean we have to make the fits incompatible.
---
Right now a PVE ship is WAAAAAAY better at PVE than a PVP ship, but can be easily dispatched by a shitfit PVP ship.
---
Change the game so a PVP fit is ideal for PVE.
---
&gt; This community is full of weak and softcore players that dont satisfy my taste
---
People will downvote you, but I think this is certainly more true nowadays. Like was said in that other thread, the average hardcore PvP players were slowly leaving the game in 2012-2014, but that number was largely replaced by an increase in people finding safe PvE content/multiboxing.
---
Industry standard rate is 10b minimum.
---
I didn’t say I’m not gonna fight I said I’ll just bring the best ship for the job.
---
&gt; he blackout was reversed not because it didn't do what it was intended to do
---
you mean, the intention of the blackout was to drop the PCU to the lowest numbers we've seen in about a decade?
---
seems like a monumentally stupid idea given the acquisition bonus that's due in 2 months.
---
This mostly just means that cloaky campers can go back to making entire systems full of ratters dock up and piss their pampers just by staying logged in while they're at work.
---
Iteration is the biggest thing IMO. Something they don't do all that often.
---
On the one hand you would hope that the game\\s designers would have a good grasp of what it is that they wanted their universe to do, on the other hand I do love the fact that they have the cohones to actually try something disruptive. There’s nothing wrong with at least trying to see what kind of change would make a great addition.
---
And then you do have the opinion of the expert in the field, the players who can gauge the quality and range of an idea from the perspective of someone who’s actually living in the environment and who can judge what a certain idea, once implemented in the environment, will achieve.
---
The CSM, having predicted what the outcome would be, should have gained a significant amount of kudos from CCP. CCP had already indicated that this CM iteration is a good one and that they were a valuable asset.
---
The CSM really does deserve the nod for their accurate prediction and their expertise.
---
&gt;You rather have zero risk as opposed to some risk? 
---
why not? other areas of the game offer 0 risk for the same reward. would you work in a job with a 50% mortality rate on any given shift for the same pay? i wouldn't.
---
&gt;Just adapt bro.
---
they did. they abandoned space that provided less value and moved to space that provided more value - or just moved to games that provided more entertainment.
---
they don't want people to adapt to their playstyle at all - they just want to be fed free kills.
---
they are already at an advantage on monday, they still have the cyno changes. yet somehow even with that advantage they can't do the thing they were already doing before the black out? seems strange.
---
&gt;the chaos era should continue
---
did it even begin?
---
2 changes in 2 months was hardly the "weekly changes" they said they wanted.
---
Man.. you really missing on those swings today =P
---
Not a farmer - don't own a rorq, even. The "you" you think you're referring to doesn't exist.
---
And the difference is without tryhards seeking easy mode, the game would die a slow, prolonged death. Without the bears, the game will die in short order. 
---
You wanted a quick, bludgeoning, selfish fix, almost out of spite. And almost killed the patient. Now go sit in a corner and seek penance for what you have done.
---
Changing an entire fitting scheme? Haha. That's not going to work. Constellation local. Done. Null is PvP centric and focused. If you want to live there you take that risk. The fact that you can just watch local, multi box 5 accounts and then dock up when someone jumps in your system is ZERO risk. People need to adapt... period. Or go to high sec. How hard is that?
---
It is the best thing to do with all the useless cyno alts now. One camper for every Nul-block system.
---
You were killed in lowsec because no local? Sounds like you should learn to use Dscan.
---
Organized groups did that, and solidified their cap umbrella. Bots also adapted. Guess who got f\*cked. 
---
They adapted all right. By leaving the game.
---
I am not even in my own local?  [https://i.imgur.com/GyXCrRJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/GyXCrRJ.png)
---
Slow burn better than nothing?
---
the only thing they burned was the PCU, and it wasn't particularly slow.
---
Whoever said it was. Don't be a smart arse. Don't lie. Don't be dishonest in your intent. In. Bad. Faith.
---
What if we change gate rats to start targeting pods?
---
So iterate and advertise. Call it the campaign to end stagnation.
---
But now you introduce a totally new concept: blockades. Like the Hellcamps of old, you need merely block those Jr's from effectively leaving the citadel. It's not easy, but there are options. Not to mention small gang fleets looking for exit cynos. There would probably need to be some balance changes of course, but overall I see grounds for a lot of non-meta PvP going on. That being said, the **MAIN** asset to destroy are the supers. Supercapitals are a strategic asset that allow a group to project power without actually deploying them. Why doesn't goon just meme drop Supers in Horde space? Because of the threat of being out escalated. Citing PL's days of marauding around as a superfleet as an example, if the opposing force cannot threaten your supercap superiority then you are free to crush everything that opposition possesses. Furthermore, you can achieve overarching goals such as draining your enemies of their ability to threaten small groups, given those small groups the ability to take sov from the bigger fish and further destabilize that groups power base.
---
Lmao okay retard
---
History shows the ccp generally leaves everything half-assed.
---
Welcome to Eve!! Log in, play for free, get a feel for the game and decide later if you want to upgrade your account if you end up liking it. Eve is a huge game and there is a lot of content to do, but you have to be willing to go after that content. There isn't much pointing you in the direction you should go, it's all up to you to decide. Figure out what you enjoy, and do it! Try a little bit of everything and find others to do that stuff with because the social aspect of Eve is what makes this game so unique!
---
Thats what you dont get, the patient is now dead  no matter what.
---
I’ll do it for 5 bil
---
&gt;no rick pve players
---
the irony of this is mind-blowing lmao
---
Is this a vague joke about... WoW ("You think you want it, but... you don't")?  Dang, brutal and epic.
---
Lmao you realise that if the game keeps being stagnant and dies all your krabbing will be completely worthless
---
Well if it worked what would all the big blocks cry about ?
---
Lets form se ragtag bunch, Im in! can find friends mayhaps. PM.
---
the fact that people are only good if there is no local is pretty baffling to me
---
50% risk? Are you serious? I didn't die once to the blackout while ratting. Not once.
---
that went well then. :D
---
The game is designed to make PVErs content creators, a reason for pvpers to undock, when it was blackout you had that in the form of gatecamps and such
---
Could. 
---
The fix would be to park the pod 4,000km off the gate. Probe scan or slowboat to get it then.
---
don't give them a narrative to use for this
---
The exact same as every single wormholer since the beginning of time? Be tanky enough that a single recon/t3c can't instantly pop you before your friends can arrive, be aligned as often as possible, have a cloaky alt yourself ready to counter jump someone if they go on you solo. But instead miners will fly with no friends online, in dangerous space, in untanked ships that die in like 20 seconds, and not use any alts to make their lives infinitely safer (honestly how annoying would it be to gank miners if they routinely had falcon alts cloaked on grid, so fucking annoying), and then complain when they inevitably die that there is nothing they could have done to prevent it.
---
Solution is to cut null sec space in half and then ppl will have a reason to fight if there's less space to hold
---
Are you saying you're gonna try it?
---
If you don't have a lot of time to play the game try looking up some videos and streams! There are tons of great resources out there to at least give you an overall understanding of different aspects of Eve, as well as showing you things you never knew you could do in game. 
---
As far as getting better, it all depends on you and what you like to do. If you're interested in PvP you gotta get out there and do it to learn and get better. Luckily this game is already geared towards you in the sense that skills train in real time, so even if you can't log on for a few days you're still progressing. For example, every level in a certain skill gives you +5% damage per level, and to get to level 5 (+25% damage) could take over a week. This is something that has kept me around for a while because even if I can't actively play, I'm constantly progressing. Though I suck horribly at PvP even with high skills! 
---
Aside from PvP there is so much in this game to look into, industry, exploration, PvE. Luckily this stuff you can learn without dedicating too much time in game because you're can look up information/videos. And just like above, skills progress in real time :D
---
DW, i'm sure this change will be reverted shortly.
---
rorqual "nerfs" haha. It needed a redesign.
---
No, it means I dunno the answer, but am curious, so imma check back in 7d to see if anyone wiser than I had the answer.
---
If you join Gallente, check out Aideron Robotics!
---
If you join Caldari, check out Templis CALSF!
---
Both awesome groups, good people, fun content. I have 0 experience/knowledge of Amarr/Minmatar warzone, but Caldari/Gallente is a lot of fun and really active.
---
\&gt;  the propaganda from all of the null leaders 
---
If you had actual eyes and ears in those nullsec blocs, and didn't rely on Reddit for your daily dose of fake news, you'd hear a fairly different tune in the pvp-oriented ones. WH diving has never been more frequent, thanks to blackout. It's just that the whales are getting fewer and fewer in number.
---
I regularly see ratting ships undock and mining ships going about. I just looked in test space man.
---
You can't dictate contentment of players. Specially those who have played for a while, and are immune to bullshit from any side. No amount of "campaigns" will make people enjoy, or not enjoy the game, if the fundamental mechanics are disrupted.
---
I believe you would lose the equivalent sp of whatever the previous level of skill, for instance you are at 155k skill points in a subsystem skill.  You pop, and you would lose 45k sp from that particular skill.
---
[removed]
---
Yes you bring 10 Bhaals in your 10 man gang to keep an injecting Fax down. And your own fax because that’s the only thing that can keep balls alive oh wait
---
And what happens if the majority is the group that is killing the game? Do you allow them to kill it? Or do you do something like focus on bringing in new players and try to make changes that will force parasitic players out?
---
From a long term business perspective for a game that has unexpectedly lasted 16 years, the choice is easy.
---
i, too, represent 100% of the playerbase.
---
So proving my point in order to disprove my point?
---
Dream on...
---
Oh how I wish I could live in a easy world like yours where everything is black and white.
---
I think cloaks are already strong enough. I think fatter less gay ships like the zealot would be cool to not appear in local, not someone's homosexualizing Loki.
---
Not feeding if you know what to do.
---
Exactly, I unsubscribed all but one of my accounts. No sense in arguing with ccp or anyone else, ccp notices when subs drop they hear that loud and clear.
---
Sure Ill take your word for it.
---
Or like... Leshaks...
---
I meant the stream, though the music would have been nice too.
---
It was on Markeedragon's stream
---
Thank you for the feedback, I appreciate it.
---
Three possibilities, 1: you will lose a random lvl4 subsystem skill and the 5 will be removed from your queue 2: you will glitch the Eve servers and cause a 30mins maintenance 3: God mode, all your skill will be lvl 5 and you the chosen one.
---
If I could put isk on it, welcome Neo.
---
Thank you!
---
😏👍
---
Im with you. But I dont like the aspect of Rorqs being the premier mining ship. As long as that ship is around in the same numbers as now youre gonna need an umbrella in another way. 
---
But thing here is, we dont need to do my thing right away. We can start with excavs and iterate which is basically what we have been saying all this time, small steps.
---
&gt; It's not easy, but there are options. 
---
Really.  Undock into tether and jump looks pretty damn unbreakable.
---
Unless you think you could manage to immediately get control of every system within 10 light years before you started your attack and maintain that perfect control for a week.
---
&gt;  Not to mention small gang fleets looking for exit cynos 
---
So it turns out it's not actually difficult to own more than one Citadel/EC/Refinery.  Sure you might blow up *a* cyno ship sitting on it, but you didn't get the JF that docked-on-load and they've got a *lots* more cyno ships sitting in there.
---
&gt; That being said, the **MAIN** asset to destroy are the supers 
---
Good thing those can't move.  That way you can catch them in the one citadel you're destroying.
---
I mean I have no idea how to respond to him anymore.
---
No. Unfortunately not. CCP, will not listen to the CSM or anybody. The grandeur idea you mentioned will go un heard.
---
When FAXes hit low class the Leshak was not invented for 3 years.
---
do you even wormhole? im talking about taking on multiple caps yeah you need more expensive ships. a few assault frigs can solo a carrier with no support
---
Thank you for confirming - indeed, TEST is one of those that adapted well to this change.
---
Imagine being a videogame development company with over 10+ years of experience and a bunch of rando nerds are still better at game design than you are
---
lmao
---
It isn't a conspiracy if the information is being tailored to bring your serfs in line with you and post about it as often as possible.  
---
"This sucks, let me tell you why I hate it and you should too..." before any evidence of good/bad has become a reality. So it actually does turn bad, because it already sounds bad/scary on the label and someone in charge told you "this will be so bad..." Sure, some people would run and hide and unsub on their own, but doom and gloom from the top casts a mighty large shadow. Wouldn't take much of a nudge to make an entire alliance feel like it is end-times instead of "oh, this will be a bit harder to do now..."
---
Nothing would make me happier and hopeful for this games future than that.
---
Many folks are having this issue today where they log in and none of the channels populate. They have to either restart the client, or in some cases, restart the computer to fix the issue.
---
Can I ask what the blackout did to bring new players in? Was there an increase in new players during the blackout? The answer to those questions? ***NOTHING*** and ***NO***
---
You talk like *ah have a blackout that will bring new players in*, it wont and why would it. New players come every day and 80-90% leave within 1 week(from memory). CCP should work on ways to improve the NPE improved ui improved training, better more easily understandable starter missions. Look at all the big null alliances, they all have excellent new player initiatives on getting new players into the game, putting them in mining ships to make isk(give them isk and ships), free skill books, training advice and instruction on how to play this game!
---
From a long term business perspective its simple, help new players learn and they will stay and numbers will grow, but a blackout in null will do nothing for new players sir and any suggestion it would is beyond the ridiculous, it probably hurts those new players that big alliances bring to null, to help teach and try to keep in game!
---
This sub exists almost exclusively to try to drive as many people away from the game as possible.
---
Yeah it's pretty simple. Play Black Desert.
---
You'll see.
---
It's insidiously, awfully fucking well crafted to drain your bank or your time in a perfectly metered manner. 
---
Then you'll worry about the possibility of EVE and/or Dust-reborn under such an influence.
---

Google result: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubZhS-0l4wk
---
ccp continues to make piss poor decisions and dont listen .. blackout was one of the best things for this game and they blew it . lost all their balls . subs drop , people crying . what a Chaos "era" it was all few weeks of it
---
I think they should just put a tax on wallet amounts. Guaranteed you'd see alot more spending and tangible assets people have to do stuff with.. oh yeah.. and stop making plex buyable with ingame currency.. cause yes it would go there :P
---
*cough*onecharacterperplayer*cough*
---
You obviously haven't fought brave have you?
---
tune heavy fighters to being unable to track subcaps, tune rorqs down to hulk levels
---
not sure, probably not
---
Huh. Automatic mining. That's a very interesting idea.
---
Cloaking mech is really broken.
---
The cloak should remove you from dscan/local (but not from probes) and you should be visible, since it's your signature being cloaked.
---
Or it should hide you from visual and probes but not from dscan/local.
---
And ofc it should eat capacitor and doesn't allow limitless cloack (with exception to specialized ships)
---
Wormhole has asset safety right?
---
You can medical clone in wormhole right?
---
Absolutely. I can perhaps go with 3 timers on KS or 2 with 1 week apart. I also want them to look at dmg caps. A guy said an interesting thing, that the cap should scale inversely with the the amount of damage taken. So if 10 people shoot it its perhaps 100 dmg/second but if 20 shoot it its only 175 dmg/s. And then some hardcap so its perhaps a ten minuter timer on max damage cap. 
---
Cause right now, honestly its a joke. If you manage to evict a group their vengeance is that you have to clean up that region. Like its a full month of timers especially with all the athanors nowadays. You win, you lose. You lose, you lose.
---
Skills are not trained in chunks, they are trained 1sp at a time.
---
Skills are lost in chunks.
---
So you have skill 4, not skill 5, so you would lose skill 4, which is equivalent to the SP difference between 3 and 4, so you'd end up still having 4 if you had enough SP, but 5 would be set back
---
So then your point is that krabs will never engage with the rest of EVE, they will simply krab until the end of time.
---
That's the point though, make them only marginally better than a hulk and the little guy doesn't need an army of rorqs they can get by with hulks. Right now its rorqs or go home.
---
&gt; Best way to make money is to get in the game and play.
---
Debatable
---
Yes sadly blackout was the perfect solution to AFK cloaky camping. We just didn't deserve to have it.
---
There is only one server, everyone is in there. This includes players from other countries who may not speak your language. Everything that can be done ingame, is legal ingame. Lying, theft, piracy, fraud and espionage. Sometimes on such a grand scale it can turn a major alliance (alligned corporations) that contain thousands of players, control large areas of the map and field fleets that would make The Empire say 'Overkill much?" Into a greasy stain. Beware.
---
This was more gregorian chant and less dubstep
---
Let's be clear, CSM13 said certain gameplay changes would negatively affect players logging in... CSM14 (the current council) have a member or two that think things like the blackout are amazing and should stay forever.
---
Did he go into detail at all? I'm no expert, but I can't help but wonder what they're after. What they've cooked up with Black Desert is extremely impressive in every performance category I can see, in pretty much every way. It was built a decade after eve was.
---
And they're the *fun* bits.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
I had a lot of success hunting marmite in their hayday by scanning the jita -&gt; amarr trade route and moving a fleet to the other side of a wormhole. Bait with a brick tanked slave battleship and warp in the fun.
---
It got so bad they started sending out Corp mails explaining to leave us alone (despite them bring paid to war dec us?
---
You don't think anyone with half a brain could predict blackout causing a drop in crabs and bots after three years of us living in a crab and bot sanctuary?
---
You do realise you just explained exactly why removing local was terrible right?
---
Imagine thinking that predicting a drop in subs due to intentionally controversial changes makes you good at game design
---
Any warp disruption prevents tether and dock on citadels I believe.
---
Yeah. It’s been done before, and it works okay. It just slows you down a lot while moving. Not something you roam with.
---
The argument was about a month ago so i can't remember much else of what he said (he is dumb i tend to find these people, shit on them a bit and move on with life) but if I recall it wasn't even about EVE, it was about the mobile shit they were dabbling in.
---
Catch.
---
You could always set it up on sisi and get someone to kill the loki
---
I didn't say good, I said better
---
The CSM is part of the problem, blackout was fine. Its all the needy krabs that are killing whats left of this game.
---
Youre under the impression that goons somehow found the one ring and rules them all. They dont even have that much power over their own members nevermind the rest of NS. But when you have a situation in which pretty much the entirety of NS agree on something then its probably because something is fked.
---
Most knew these results, nobody forced anyone to firesale their shit and move to HS or quit the game. It was just obvious that it couldnt work.
---
Don't do it, its not worth it.
---
Money talks louder than publicly appointed officials.
---
Go in here r/evejobs and pop up a post, 
---
lots of great corps out there and lots of really good people to play with(in this sub not so much) and people who will teach you. 
---
Get a corp and take advantage of the cheap first month sub $7.50 i think and jump in! be active in whatever corp you join, get on comms ask questions and enjoy, first 2 months are the hardest, after that its a blast!
---
Also these are really new guy friendly
---
This is such a cool suggestion. I loved the blackout and am sad to see it end, but I never even thought about displaying friendlies. For or against local, you guys definitely make a good point about null feeling lonely now.
---
Im not against the idea. I originally thought that would be enough, Im just not sure anymore. But like I said, baby steps. I dont think people will quit over the removal of excavs, most whove used them understand that they are in fact broken (when used in the numbers we currently use them).
---
A good way to increase pvp could be to make certain systems pvp only, so that players that want to be more certain about getting fights always have somewhere to go where they know that anyone there is there explicitly to pvp and would only warp out if they're outmatched or outmanned (or a salty brat that doesn't like to lose). It may seem rather counterintuitive for a sandbox game, but having at least one area that people know only has one outcome still helps. A bit like people that want a lot of action in a battle royale game dropping into certain areas (like pochinki in pubg) to have a high stakes shoot out. It doesnt stop other areas from being fought, but reduces the downtime considerably for most players.
---
You mean all will leave except one per system, and that will make you not use the space?
---
TDF and NGA are both running.
---
It's mostly blueprints, some skillbooks and agency boosters https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/sell/10000002/1000137/withblueprints
---
WTM is more newbro friendly, you don't need a 3b+ vindi to join with them. And the contesting isn't that bad, but yeah, it depends on how many newbros around at that time.
---
Pretty sure GOTG have almost completely pulled out of tenal and large sections of branch, they were trying to hole up in Deklein, Blackout hit them hard and they lost large numbers, any push on them will see them fold
---
&gt;I'm not keen to buy a loki and blow it up just to test and potentially lose SP over it. Anyone been unfortunate enough to find out?
---
Testserver... No time right now but I might try that later. If someone likes to try now please share the results.
---
The thing is, there are ways to give more safety while maintaining blackout.  Buffs to d-scan range would be one.  Introducing anchorable modules that give intel about what is on specific grids would be another.  Local itself is an extremely overpowered tool that should have been cut as soon as it started being used for intel back in 2003.  There is a need for intel options, but this isn't the right one as there is zero counterplay.
---
By surrendering with a big chunk of isk?
---
This makes for a good beginning of the week
---
Cool, that seems fair. So really, if you lose a tengu and are training the IV back to V, you would be *hoping* to lose SP in that skill again if you were to lose another tengu.
---
Thanks!
---
How about you show up in local when you decloak on the gate? You jump in, you have time to load grid, you can dscan a bit, check the map of the system a bit.
---
So if you are moving fast, there won't be much change, but you could still get a little bit of edge if you don't decloak.
---
They can't offend their blob overlords.

---
And what did CSM say about Fozzie sov, citadels and new rorquals, when they were first introduced and mined 400M/hr?
---
Most of the devs are surely incompetent or not playing the game, but how come CSM are more prepared?
---
&gt; IAS's can also hack structures, increasing the damage cap by 1 times the base damage cap per engaged IAS.
---
You do know that 1 x 1 = 1?
---
I’m trying to be nice.
---
You didn’t specifically
---
But money only decided to talk when those officials are ignored
---
450 euros in a few months? did he buy a titan or something?
---
Just roll a dice, it's the easiest way.
---
Maybe that's how CCP does it as well...
---
1. Rorquals were a bad idea.
---
2. Fozzie sov is terrible
---
3. Citadels are going to get spammed.
---
Wow the monday shittalk thread started early today.
---
It’s funny bc goon leadership was trying to spin blackout as a positive but everyone was like “no it’s fucking awful” and then it here like claiming the opposite because you read all this fake news garbage on r/eve and believe it then you post something stupid like this and look dumb so yeah
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation
---
paragraph 2
---
also, eve has had so rampant inflation from the rattinng bounties that the amount of deflation needed to be bad, is quite huge.
---
No man. They going to listen to the investors and shareholders before a CSM lol
---
Lmao at the non entity NC bragging about their super fleet
---
People with your mentality were never meant to leave high-sec. If you're too terrified to risk having to engage in pvp, maybe EVE isn't the game for you.
---
Lol you are dedicated good troll. If the game ever dies it's gonna be because of people like you pushing against anything that makes EVE uncomfortable for end game players ;)
---
can you post an example of one of your loki kills with a ratting ship?
---
yea i was thinking more as a defensive fleet
---
I don't think I said anything about blackout
---
Rorks got buffed so hard they became the major money making method in null, leading to a massive amount of supers and Titans being built over the last few years.
---
Now several groups have large numbers of supers and are unable to actually meaningfully impact one another.
---
Link your killboard lmao
---
This has been a thing for like 10+ years lmao
---
&gt;The bottom line was affected by the mass exodus of players 
---
Typically takes companies a full quarter to measure the impact to the bottom line. We've had blackout for just over two months. Do you have references to their financials or are you extrapolating from the numbers?
---
And about the mass exodus, has this actually been tracked to doomheim or is this just on people not logging in?
---
I don't really read into anything specific. Most of this crap is hyperbole spun way out of proportion in order to get a response.
---
"oh yeah, well well... I'll unsub if I can't see when bad guys come to shoot me... WHY should I be vigilant and not watch Netflix while I eat a couple Subway footlongs and talk to my Canadian g/f on Skype?"   ... trim your neck.

---
No, in order to prevent structure span industry part need to be addressed.                 
---
1. Structure on each mining moon ?            
---
2. Industry bonuses and rig/structure price force you to split into smaller T2 rigged structures ?           
---
3. Separate refining structure ?            
---
4. Industry index linked to a single system incentivizing you to do duplicate existing setup next door ?       
---
5. Pure safety makes you want to install your own structures ? ^(stuff like refuel, as do you want that your 10bil of industry jobs to get stuck in someone azbel as he quit the game and there is no one who can refuel the structure?)                                      
---
This is what enforce structure spam from the industry side.    
---
If you jump into a system and see 60 industry related structures - this is why.
---
And instead of anyone trying to use this for counters (i.e literally thousands of dreads)
---
They cry and spam cloaked frigates while claiming it isn’t fair that they can’t win against those armadas.
---
So the several groups continue to grow unabated, able but unwilling to meaningfully impact one another while the “hunters” refuse to lift a finger beyond spamming complaints to CCP
---
I have already explained this to you. The numbers simply dont back you up. Rampant inflation has to have real effects or you cant call it rampant inflation.  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png).
---
This is not rampant inflation. This is in fact no real inflation, or rather nothing that cant be explained. In fact, with explanation what Im seeing is deflation and not inflation. 
---
The money supply issue is however generally seen as something tied to inflation irl, for sure. But like I said, its more complicated. If you read the entire wiki you will understand more why.
---
This if from that wiki:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#/media/File:FRED\_graph\_US\_CPI\_for\_All\_Urban\_Consumers\_1969%E2%80%932019.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#/media/File:FRED_graph_US_CPI_for_All_Urban_Consumers_1969%E2%80%932019.png) . Thats inflation and its fairly stable. Compare it to Eve:  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5qeyHuSSaqqpDC3GQeTuBO/f08ab5bb4ffb3b680059a21a33861304/9d\_economy.indices.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5qeyHuSSaqqpDC3GQeTuBO/f08ab5bb4ffb3b680059a21a33861304/9d_economy.indices.png). 
---
Weve had pretty much the same CPI for the majority of the games life. This even though weve had an growth in the money supply. Theory and reality clash and reality is always the winner.
---
You are far to optimistic.
---
The inflation is whatvhas throughout eve as a game brought plex price from 300mil to  the peak of 2.3-2.4 ish bil it reached this year.
---
Well obeying the cloak friggy overlords was about to kill the entire game
---
So... lesser of two evils if you wannalook at it at who has more impact
---
#21 machs
---
Farming comes and goes. It all depends of the current Tier. Right now farmers are on the Amarr side : the more they farm, the more their lp market crash. So sooner or later, they will switch to Minmatar because Minmatar LP value rose up.
---
That's what is killing FW : we became a isk printing machine where outsiders just put a farmer alt in each militia.
---
As far as 1 vs 1 frigate fights goes, it depends of the timezone. Highly contested systems will see a lot of small gang fights in the busy timezones. 
---
If you are looking only for solo fights and are not looking for a corp or small gangs, just go pirate honestly. You will have more targets.
---
When I bring folks into EVE I give em' a T1 frigate and tell em to join our fleets. It's a good starting point. So I'm not upset that frigates have their place in FW.
---
CCP had to face the harsh reality that "loud mouth" players are not and do not represent the majority of EVE players that actually pay money for the game. 
---
One does not simply mess with carebears, because like a  whale they may seems slow and harmless but if you get them angry they turn to the most dangerous player in EVE
---
Dontcarebears 
---
Dontcarebear wont be returning back, they do not care about a game that calls "improvement" switching a feature off just to make a tiny minority happy. 
---
CCP will have to find and entice new players or end up to where all games eventually end, the land of abandonware.
---
Remove gates. More empty systems. Make it so when you activate your warp drive it shows up as a signature on overview like cyno. Give warp a longer charge time. Make space feel big.
---
well the point is if you watch zkill there was plenty of prey being taken down before blackout. so if prey conditions gets worse there is less prey and less to kill. Happiness is a target rich environment(and a belt fed weapon)
---
lol ok thanks for the input, good day
---
You don't need a 3 bill Vindi to join any of the incursion communities you're just expected to upgrade overtime. 
---
As for contesting ever since CCP reduced the highsec spawns down to one WTM has been getting face raped. The only time they thrive is in the USTZ when everyone else is down. Which is weird as it's traditionally there weakest TZ as they just don't have the numbers.
---
started off good got weaker to the end
---
Cry harder in your 20mil frigate that myrms won’t feed your killboards as easily
---
Find a more interactively gameplay bro
---
Being nice hasn't gotten us anywhere... time for sledgehammers and pitchforks.
---
i downvoted, lolthough.  This is. shit shitpost 
---
Kudos
---
You always lose the last skill you trained afaik.
---
you dont need to buy the game, but a paid subscription is needed to access all content and skills.  basically its paid subscription and some people buy extra things to sell to other players for isk (gold).
---
I think you might be the only one who didn’t see an issue pre-Blackout. 
---
I suppose we want different things from the game.
---
you aren't going to make great isk for your first several months in game likely.
---
No u
---
No no, what i meant is they care. (i dont think this changes their gamestyle that mutch, i recon they GANK you not BUMP you)
---
that roleplaying thing is their piece of fun. 
---
So hauling minerals (or ORE).
---
they do care :)
---
it was not a cry or a complain. More a stupid remark :) :) :)
---
[url=https://i.imgur.com/czb5mss.jpg]Here let me help![/url]
---
Sure.
---
But mostly, train only to 4, or when you know you are going to die, disengage and eject
---
it wasn't the random pvper that no local made all the krabs unsub.  It was the bomber fleets and to a lesser extent dread bombs.
---
nice to see this .... still remember the time when their drake gangs came to teach us humility !!!
---
lol yall's arguments are such shit now you have reverted back to nerd shaming - you play EVE dude, you're poking people on the same raft as you
---
Its fucked, now is a bad time to come back
---
Man you would have hated the station/POS system. BTW industry index is only a issue if you're in some turbo blob alliance.
---
define: irony
---
No this are golden years for me.
---
You arr part of the problem, blackout was good
---
well they have never simultaneously had a massive player drop AND been owned by another company at the same time like this particular circumstance
---
What should rats broadcast, when they trying to intercept huge Nyx in suicidal attack?
---
Do you have any data to back up these claims? Rhetorical question, of course, you obviously don't and are just parroting your narrative of choice.
---
Yes they pleased their krab overlords.
---
And now don't have a plan for whats next
---
*aDaPt Or DiE!!*
---
Not a very original one tho.
---
there is not much ability to assess risk in no-local null.
---
in wormhole space, you control your connections.  if an unknown sig pops, you scan it down ASAP.  in null, connections are static and someone can bridge in suddenly using 24/7 cloaky eyes.  in wh space, it takes effort to rage roll into a particular wh for a large-fleet gank on a ratting target.
---
Expect:
---
\- Low population
---
\- breaking  chat.
---
\- No major changes to upgrade experienced players content in upcoming year.
---
\- Chaos, no Roadmap for EVE
---
\+ Some minior changes to mechanics
---
\+ OP trivalgian ships
---
 \- higher trade tax
---
\+ Active moon mining
---
\+ Minior FW upgrades
---
\++ Some UI changes like fast search
---
\-- Some UI changes like transparency
---
\-- Harder Freight ganking
---
\+/- More farming bots starting monday
---
\- Mad ganker whining about end of black out
---
\- Mad Kraber coming back or not coming back "we will see how much damage CCP Hilmar did to the game"
---
\+ Agency UI
---
\+ Activity UI is promising
---
Backstreet boys - Bye Bye Bye
---
We dont need big blocks adapting better, its only 2 of them anyways.
---
We need the big block to break apart, and you are part of the problem.
---
Unfortunately, cloaky campers will be unwilling collateral damage.
---
Thanks for the help 👍
---
Which is why it's so hilarious to anchor stop/drag bubbles depending on the location of the gate in relation to the citadel inside Germinate.
---
For the forseeable future they said... Not indefinitely... Two seperate things.
---
Chaos does not weaken the big blocks. It just make them stay home.
---
major krab regions are typically among the leaders in monthly losses.  .
---
"Blackout will bring so many players back!"
---
Apparently not enough.
---
That's gold!
---
No
---
Why not instead of chaos allowing fucking over unsuspecting people until they quit
---
Structure to more properly engage people without it being roflstomp or cloak/run?
---
I completely agree the PVP elements of this game is a bad joke at best. Wasting 99.9% of the time to get to the action than actual action and have the balls to call this game a "PVP game" is hilarious to say the least. 
---
When I realised what actual PVP means for EVE , it was the most bat crazy moment in my life of playing games.
---
[Here let me help!](https://i.imgur.com/czb5mss.jpg)
---
the problem with the blackout wasn't the roamers so much as the massive bomber fleets or dread bombs.
---
That sounds like a legit issue yeah, I’ve not experienced any of that due to my play style.
---
indeed.  risk vs. isk went out the window.  and thus PVE ground to a stop.
---
People don't do things they don't have a reason to.
---
Water is wet, the sky is blue, more at 11!
---
Yes because before chaos they were super wild entities creating PvP everywhere. And when cynos where easy you were seeing entities fighting on a daily basis with capitals and not every 6 months to swing their dicks.
---
actually, its the second easiest way.
---
easiest way is f1 monkey in strat ops, but don't really do much solo pvp on the account.
---
There are levels.
---
Yeah that's what I'm talking about exactly, some middle ground that takes skill to either avoid detection or trap hunters.
---
You seem to have fallen victim to SDS\*, my friend. Sorry for your loss.
---
^(\*Spodbrain Downvote Syndrome)
---
By what metric?
---
Sure as shit wasn't by the metric of people being logged in.
---
If your flair is correct, your rorq was almost never prey for anyone.
---
Nice, thank you!
---
Every post that starts with "My", I always mentally replace it with "Baby's first". Baby's first idea on how to fix null sov.  Baby's first take on the blackout.
---
Biggest Krabs live in the safety of WH's based on ISK faucet data per number of players.
---
I mean carbonfury never was an actual FC, only a targetcaller
---
I have a special blackout, i can't see myself in corp ,local even in fleet but I can join fleet.
---
thx CCP for letting the krab won and for breaking once again the chat
---
Whoah,  all these negative votes.  People really don't jokes these days
---
you do risk it, its just the risk escalated massively and was unknown much of the time.
---
Lol way to opposite land. You realize there's other modes of income than rorq mining that improve the chances for PVP. 
---
Nobody should care that you feel entitled to a safe endgame passive income before you go whelp some frigates when it's ruining the economy.
---
This is weird. 
---
Not sure if we already have bug reports in on this, but can you file one so the QA team can take a look at it? &lt;3
---
The biggest problem with EVE is everything is thought about in terms of people who have played for years. No thought is ever given to the guy who started 3 months ago. This failing is what hurts EVE the most.
---
uh, pvp won't decrease because of no blackout.  there will be more targets and the cyno changes will still make some modifications to response fleets.
---
what will go down is the ease of cloaky camping a dozen systems and getting easy kills with a bridged in bomber fleet.
---
who do you mean with you ?
---
Shield ships don't need a dps buff. Tach beam nightmares already do buttloads more dps applied compared to a HAC
---
It took 3 months.       
---
Sorry but **IT TOOK 3 MONTHS**               
---
People that bought 3 month sub ^(the most popular one) and quit due to this have all right to be angry at CCP as they bought specific product and got something different.
---
This, so much
---
Oh please. I bet all the people who "quit" were just playing WoW Classic and are still connected to their coallition discord. One does not simply just cut EVE out of their life at the drop of a hat.
---
I'm sure a few pings later they'll come back, unless of course they're going to keep protesting that they can't bridge in a super fleet on top of their ratting gila.
---
Agree, it was awesome to see for example maelstrom fleets alphaing left and right.
---
I mean, do some changes like specific ressources by region, to force the blocks to move and have war. this kind of change would be effective.
---
If there's one thing we do know about people who quit Eve, it's that they stick around on forums
---
So true (my opinion)!
---
When you make a game that 90% is PVE , 10% (and I am extremely optimistic here) is PVP (including.... try not to laugh PVP players.... trading ) PVP and insisting calling it a "PVP" because once in a millenium you have a huge battle of slow motion ships that makes the news even though none of the people reporting the news even know WTF is going on. 
---
Yeah you feed the arrogant player while the PVE players stays quite tolerating being called all sort of names to make him insignificant.
---
Then you make the huge mistake actually believing as a company the arrogance that you have been feeding your so called "PVP players". You go and make a random change that makes no logical sense to anyone but your tiny minority of arrogant people. 
---
Then yeah that quite majority of so called "carebears" will quickly turn to "dontcarebears" and the shit will hit the fan , bounce to the wall and then back to the fan. 
---
Enjoy your shitstorm CCP. You have been warned but nope.... you knew better.
---
This sub has some gold advise, but 99% of it shit and cancer
---
Pvpers do all the time.
---
There isn't a benefit to going out to die.
---
This is one of those rare stainguy goodposts
---
Not to necro, but they show up there too, now. Just got a venture insta-popped, decided to go back to my station games.
---
You realize as someone with 15 accounts there were times I was multiboxing 7-10 caps in pvp fleets right? Its not just for krabbing.
---
Am i retarded if i liked Skilling spree? :(
---
It was good to train lowsec PvP alphas.
---
Yes, but there is like 100 changes CCP could do to create conflicts and they wasted their free throws are the most retarded ones. Anything more like drastic ressources reduction, less timers for structures etc would be nice for creating conflicts.
---
That's SDS* you're falling to.
---
(Serial dick sucking)
---
Introduce R128 and R256 "comets/asteroids". have those materials be used in the creation of T2 capitals.  have the location of those reset every 3 months.  
---
Have a wandering incursion angel fleet, stays for 1-3 months in a region, being in a different constellation every week (have it drop the angel cap BPCs).  do the same thing with sansha null incursions and introduce new sansha caps that way.
---
Also one key aspect:  make a small warning so you know where the next region rotation is to like a week ahead of time.
---
for low, introduce a new LP for navy capital guns/ships and ways to get it.
---
So you say less pvp because you aren't going to pvp with your second account ? Don't mine alone and take turn to provide cyno to go pvp. 
---
Also gdberating isk afk is part of the stagnation problem in eve.
---
Cyno changes make escalating less easy, so the super umbrella for krabs is a more difficult too.
---
There will be more subcap fights, the first to drop caps will have advantage. 
---
War doesn't resume to caps and supercaps.
---
Yeah how CCP put the changes is quite shitty but most of them are needed.
---
Well carebears will always be carebears.
---
People seem unable to use dscan or to put someone watching the gate.
---
Also with local back, people will have intel channel and near2 back to full power so people will unsiege/stop the nsa before you reach them, and ishtar/myrm/domi will warp off as soon as you enter local, that doesn't generate pvp.
---
As long as you are PvPing it isn't wrong.
---
**boom** roasted
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Are we talking about eve or my job?
---
yeah, stopping blackout really is a mistake I agree :D
---
Can you tell me the ingame channel to join fleet and roughly the schedule of fleet, never participate in one but I would like to :)
---
When the "part of the problem" group outnumbers your side, you might be looking at things from the wrong point of view.
---
But this is disingenuous and you know it. They aren't leaders in losses per amount "Krabbed" nor are they even leaders in losses per capita. The only reason they are leaders is because they are so much more populated.
---
Same here. Really enjoying the game at the moment and I’m still a 15m ISK noob.
---
Remain neutral and shoot all fw militia plebs equally.
---
The blackout lasted 3 months.        
---
It is quite a lot of time for people to also lose interest in forums.        
---
But it is more about the fact that we lack proper dev blogs and notifying people using emails will bring no harm.
---
Air Tech was so wrong he made me agree with Dave. Oof.

CCP Falcon, "Should be fun... :( "
---
This is Hotel Eve. You can check out but never leave. They will be aware because usually 00 is not the place where ppl life that don't understand anything and simply mine in their prospect and do dayly 30 LV 4 empire missions and log out
---
I'll take what is "Buying plex for 1000," Alex.
---
So what you're saying is if you had to choose between watching a bar of cargo fill up or looking for people to fight you'd watch the bar. We value your opinion and will keep it in mind.
---
I don't know why this is so heavily downvoted, but I liked it :) 
---
Keep fighting the blob!
---
it still astounds me what a salty cuck you are on a daily basis
---
Many wise words were already said, so I'll add just one thing.
---
In Eve you can do same things in various ways, using various ships and various fits. Most of the game "tasks" can be done easy 'good enough' way, or 'optimised' way.
---
For example, you can shoot things in basic ship fitted with mods you happened to have in station, or you did your homework and you know the damage type your enemy deals/is weak against etc, etc. Both ways will let you play. The first one will be good enough at the beginning, but as you progress, you will want to know more. The process can be challenging, but if you decided what is fun for you, at least you know what to focus on.
---
TLDR: Don't try to know everything at once, have fun and choose what you want to specialise in.
---
So happy im a poor goon right now.
---
Well that would mean you'd always lose the same skill, wouldn't it?
---
Eve is difficult but it worth it.
---
People will try to scam you but a lot of people will help you.
---
If you start, spend some time in high sec skilling the magic 14 ( eveuniversity wiki) do some missions but rapidly go to lowsec/null/wormhole to learn pvp.
---
I would suggest to avoid big null groups because it will be less challenging and you will just a n+1 pilot.
---
With eve you will make space friends, playing alone is boring and will most likely make you quit.
---
 The more time you put in it the faster you will get better but you can still play with few hours per week, it will depend what your goal are :)
---
Whenever money doesn't leave the game fast enough or forces people to spend it on the market, PLEX prices will rise because players want more money for their PLEX. Coincidentally if people buy more PLEX after losses to replace those losses, the influx of PLEX into the market generally causes a drop in the PLEX price.
---
Or so it should in a healthy ecosystem.
---
I don't feel entitled, i am just explaining how the Chaos means less PvP for me. 
---
And in general, for the PVE activities in null, more risk for same reward just lead to less activity , not more PVP.
---
CCP is a victim of what they were encouraged to do by players for years.
---
When I was playing in my nascent Eve days (2012-2014), the overwhelming narrative from people like Aryth, Sion, basically all the Goon reps (and also to a lesser extent, others from N3 and TEST/HERO) was the idea of Farms and Fields. The idea that nullsec should be very valuable from a bottoms-up style of income for the average player.
---
Since that period, Eve saw that vision unfold. We got:
---
* Anom rate in low-end systems upped in 2015 (Aegis)
---
* Capital rebalance, including new carrier/supercarrier mechanics that made ratting highly profitable (2016, Citadel)
---
* Rorqual changes, encouraging large-scale resource extraction (2016, Winter)
---
* Moon mining changes, which radically shifted income streams from top-down mechanics to a multitude of players contributing through mining individually (2017, Lifeblood).
---
While several of these things have received successive nerfs over the years, the case still stands that Eve has been turned into a much more pve-friendly game than it was in even the early 2010s. Mining barge fleets still existed, but were more engageable rather than a Rorqual + super blob. Carriers were risky to use in sites, leading to subcaps being used and more engageable prey being in space. Max ratting ticks peaked at 90m/hr for people, some carriers were capable of 120m/hr using fighter mechanics but were infrequently used.
---
Its no coincidence that the Farms and Fields style of gameplay design that CCP pursued was met at the same time with very few manners of countering increasing centralization of players. PANIC modules that are so useful for smaller groups become unassailable when put with larger entities with supercap umbrellas. Incredible isk and mineral generation makes smaller powers emerging into nullsec reconsider going it alone when there is more money and less risk involved with joining an established power. We saw an exodus of players and seasoned FCs from the game over the past three years especially, capping off with SkillU's dissolution earlier this year.
---
So unsurprisingly, CCP shit itself when they saw this general trend. Entrenched powers are stagnant, there is little to no groundshaking wars like in the past. Tribute 2019 flared out of existence before it even began, the 2018 small war between PL/NC/SkillU/Frat vs. Legacy/CFC pretty much ended at UALX because of the realization of forces present. The last surprising campaign/world-shattering event was SkillU's destruction of the DRF in spring 2018, and before that it was the CO2 coup/backstab and Tri's retreat from Insmother. Gradually fewer and fewer wars of consequence are happening, a downward trend that has persisted for years.
---
So CCP has tried to shake things up, applying shock therapy to their game. The result? Pretty shitty responses from players. They've become comfortable with how things are. Risk is diluted. There is nothing to fight over that they cannot have within their own space. There is no reason to engage in massive wars across the galaxy except for constructed reasons.
---
CCP has designed itself into a very precarious corner , and getting out of it is going to be difficult.
---
That looks like Counter but give suspend.
---
what were the faction warfare upgrades?
---
Oh that is most certainly correct. But that isnt general inflation. If PLEX goes up but everything else goes down your purchasing power is probably around the same. Thats why baskets are relevant.
---
PLEX can also be affected CCP having more sales and SP events. None of this will honestly work in the long run tho, PLEX will always rise especially since its tied to skill injectors. As long as you have players and especially newer players that are trying to catch up via the use of injectors PLEX prices will increase. CCP should give out more SP to curb this but imo PLEX prices going up is actually a good thing. Its a sign of prosperity.
---
But I do agree faucets need to be checked nonetheless. They do affect PLEX prices long term simply because people are wealthier. The other side tho is that the people that buy PLEX from CCP to sell on the market have far more purchasing power today than they did when it was only worth 300m. So its a toss up which direction one wants it to go but I personally would like to see it be more stable than it has been.
---
So Im with you, i want to see reductions in both faucets and mineral supply. But done properly.
---
Stop denying we need income to play Eve.
---
L U L
---
Oh so Tribute. Okay.
---
i totaly see the pre-blackout issues and they will be back now. but the blackout was the wrong solution. uncatchable inties with a cyno makes home defence come down to local and cap umbrella and thats where it all goes wrong. gatecamping to keep ratters safe and the brawls that results in someone trying to bust through is something we simply lost. i think we need to rethink the whole way getting a fight works because "sword fleets" is complete cancer. I think we need to encourage having a good brawl instead of everyone bailing out af the drop of a hat. i think the real BS is cap umbrellas though. i fought in the fountain war on the side of test and we had a bunch of great fights because it was subcap and you could not simple bail at the first sign of trouble
---
In the short term of course after raising crabs and bots on perfect safety for three years we're gonna see those people leave. That's just an extremely shot sighted view of the EVE ecosystem.
---
Yeah... I don't know I've never lost a t3c skill I just heard from people that they're reverted in the order you trained them in.
---
I think the issue of HACs is due to its costs and resource availability. I don't see that getting HACs for decenish enough price would be a problem. Sure, maybe we don't have enough of them dying due to not having really big conflicts right now. But it still should be that you either use cheaper T1 fleets that are easy to make and don't increase too much in price or more expensive and better T2 fleets that run the risk of jumping up in price if enough of them start to die...
---
This would honestly solve many issues but too many are against it. I would atleast want to see it tried.
---
EVE's situation is more like the popcorn is on fire ad well
---
I was sitting on the undock in catch thinking I was hot shit in a naga. Oodell decloaked and taught me a lesson about hubris with his legal at the time input broadcasting bombers. Tethering ruins so much gameplay.
---
Ok so, i use plex as a general judgement of value, because of the way it works, its one if the few items that dont come from ingame work, so it holds its irl value, and it also keeps the value of 1 month of gametime. So since it doesent loose any inherent value, the price is a good picture of inflation rates.
---
When I can login I will, forgot to mention after DT it started working again.
---
Most def. I mean we can sit here and pretend NS is at fault or roamers are at fault but the fact is we all share the blame on this one. Its not just mechanics that fk this game, we most certainly have a hand in it ourselves.
---
We learn our fleeing technique France
---
I think you are correct that dpswise they are fine. Range is however also not a real issue. The most popular Battleships have plenty of range. The problem is that they take 5-6 seconds to even lock another battleship, let alone a cruiser and at the 0 range you talked about, they cannot track anything unless both sides are completely stationary.
---
If I'd have to buff battleships I'd make them lock slightly quicker, warp slightly faster (traveling so bad right now) and buff their tanks a bit. I feel like they can buff battleships quite a bit before they become overpowered because they have so many counter plays which can use their slow speed and tracking against them or bomb them to oblivion.
---
1. Since I am a Newbro myself I can tell: You will get overwhelmed. The game is very complex. But it is not a bad thing. I was literally seeking for that after all the dumb and short life games I played recently. I wanted something challenging in a BIG scale. And something I would play for several years.
---
2. If you are willing to invest hours and hours into reading and watching stuff on eveuniwiki/other websites/youtube you will learn a lot and it will feel good. It will feel really good. 
---
3. Also, don't rush. This is not a rush game. People have been playing several years and find content they didn't know before. 
---
4. I am concerned about your way. You asked:"And what is the fastest way to make money?" This game is not about ISK. It's not a simulator, it's a sandbox. Just play and have fun. The ISK will come don't worry about that.
---
5. You can join the big alliances or Eve University for newbro help. But the smaller corporations are fine aswell. Just join a player corporation and be a part of the community.
---
Much love
---
I think no one deny here that mining rorqual and panic need to go.         
---
Quite probably same for ease of ratting in supers ^(or should i say sustainability of the process).             
---
Blackout killed subcap ratting and this was serious issue.            
---
You could not rat in a subcap as there was no chance to keep this ship alive.         
---
Even carrier have not enough EHP so only super were left and you can use those in the umbrella **as issue with blackout was simple : it was not the size or power of ship that you used, but EHP that allowed you to call for help and be saved**              
---
Moon mining ?   
---
In current form it need to go.
---
And what's the "blackout" and krabbers?
---
Oh yeah, i understand that and the point still stands for PvP. Being able to multi 7-10 caps or supers for PvP is also ridiculous.
---
Angel Caps where only a concept desing from one of the art guys I heard and where never a project that ccp planned to do
---
I think the goal is more to temporarily disrupt ratting so that they group up and fight for a bit instead of tethering and waiting for you to get bored.
---
&gt; blackout was good
---
lol
---
Most def. In war time all targets are viable but in peacetime its really boring to just kill randos trying to PvE. In the end its question of what gets your heart pumping and shooting someone who doesnt stand a chance is like killing a NPC. Might serve a purpose but its sure as shit not gonna get me excited.
---
Oh yeah and the point still stands for PvP. Being able to multi 7-10 caps for PvP is also ridiculous.
---
The moon mining mechanics change benefitted bigger groups and groups on the margin the most, but for mid-sized pvp groups they were a profoundly negative change. It's been talked about on this sub ad infinitum, but it removed a powerful conflict driver to focus on for alliances who weren't necessarily empire-builders in favor again of the Farms and Fields design paradigm.
---
As for blackout, I believe it is somewhat mixed. It definitely gave the attackers a much bigger ball to fight with, but removing local entirely is not so good of a thing. NS and WHs are completely different design areas of eve, with cynos and entry/exit routes the most obvious reasons why. CCP never intended local to be an intel tool, but it is difficult to remove such a fundamental part of the game without wide-reaching results.
---
Can agree to that, roll back 2012
---
The goal of the blackout was a noble one, although it threw the balance so from from massive in favor of PVE to massive in favor to PVP that is was never going to stick. 
---
I do hope they revisit it in a less hamfisted and better thought through form. Why not introduce a delayed local in which someone appears in local after, say 30 seconds of jumping in, or after breaking gate cloak. It makes a good hunter being able track it's target and get the jump on it's target, while giving a solo active PVEer some time to escape/react before being tackled. Balance is important in a sandbox, we have seen the consequences of both sides of the imbalance by now.
---
Ratters will choose to awox each other’s insured T1 BS or BC so nothing will be change tbh
---
it's a non judgemental statement
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
&gt;You were the one who didn't read the answer that was already posted before you even asked the question because it offended you.
---
you continue to act a baby.
---
&gt;TIL the game was created in 2013 and not 2003 and that is less than 1/3 of the life of the game and that people just didn't get by before 2014 when burners were added.
---
&gt;None of these things have anything to do with local.
---
jeez do you forget already? we're talking about the relationship between ways to make ISK.
---
&gt;This is you right now.
---
"it's horrible for the average player because- guess what- it's been balanced because local is a huge safety net."
---
So, name a metric.
---
you should send falcon another present you cringey retard
---
is there any difference ?
---
No. Rorq mineral output is good for the game. The problem is PANIC is OP and rocks are infinite in a small space with no depletion mechanics.
---
Feel like the blackout came about because CCP couldn't get local to work at all times.
---
No it don't, it needs far less players being able to use it, like it was in past.
---
That’s just the thing
---
They’re all not after pvp, they scream and insult and downvote and cry not for balance or the health of eve.  They ONLY want their agenda
---
“Stopping evil null krabs” is literally a lie.  Hey don’t care about the economy or bloc powers and standing capital fleets... Unless it brings danger to them.  
---
They only want free kills.  The game had evolved to make that harder which wasn’t “fair” and they cried “too safe”
---
They think things are “too safe” because they want to feel like they’re “dangerous”.  They want to be seen as impressive and successful “hunters” while downvoting/flaming the fuck out of anyone pointing out that killing defenseless ships is not only unimpressive, but does NOTHING to their “supposed” goals.
---
Olmecca farmed excavators for a year, recorded his “success”, bragged about the trillion+ he took..... and then still cried how unfair it was that people could farm “untouched”
---
They’re all delusional.  And they’re liars.  
---
Nobody gives a fuck about anything but their own fun, and for someone who wants to “feel dangerous” and be the robin hood fighting the big bag evil goon kingpin (or whoever they hunt claiming “bots” and whatever other battlecry).... there is no fun in challenge.
---
The game needs the cowards who pvp by hunting pve ships.  The game needs pve ships who run from them.
---
But the game also needs pvpers who want to fight other pvpers for more than zkill stats.  And the cloaking device for that is what local is for hunters... the ultimate deterrent that counters the other.
---
Nul local went to wh local mode so only show up if you talk.                 
---
                  
---
Krabbing is pve krabbers are people that are partaking
---
Yeah - but now we are stuck with the broken game. You might not have liked the change, but the blackout fixed a lot of problems. It opened up a lot of space, for the smaller alliances with the renter empires going dark. Drastically impacted botting and inflation due to super ratting. Made recon and being a spai a job again. It also brought the alliance members closer together, and all it cost was some super capital ratters who don't contribute to the game anyway
---
it's stupid to make real players leave to try to get rid of the bots.
---
For the bots, there are solutions: just make programs to detect patterns: exact same behaviors, timings, reaction time. It is not diffficult, you just have to put a developer on it, they just don't want to.
---
For the carebears, i don't agree to get rid of them, why force everyone to do the same thing in Eve? That's the variety of activities in Eve that creates the wide range of possible content and gameplays.
---
Economy is not fucked because of the carebears but because CCP did not balance it. They need to create more isksinks, for example make the structures more costly to maintain.
---
The only way you'll ever be right is to repeat everything I say word for word to every single person you know.
---
Dude I won eve in 2007 and I'm still here.
---
I would also really like this idea. Taking it as a starting point and maybe tweaking it here and there to achieve balance in the hunted vs the hunter. It seems like such a sensible middle ground to try out, that I was actually shocked that they roled back blackout completely instead of nerfing the blackout to this proposal.
---
I wonder however if CCP has the ability to implement this in it's current chat system. Seeing as it breaks regularly already. All of their last changes have been really easy to implement but crude changes, which makes you feel like they cannot or don't want to spend a lot of resources on this.
---
I do wonder if we recover more from this than we lose though. Like thise who got pissed and left may not all come back, and now those who liked BO may leave...
---
It is cause they will make everyone mad now ;D
---
And you present this like, it's players fault that, they are playing in the most optimal way. Most of null loves wars, because everyone hopes for fun deployment. 
---
But right now there's no reason to lead wars just to take more territory. On the contrary, it's better if you alliance online lived in one region, with one powerful super umbrella. And CCP designed it that way.
---
What's more, they are working even harder to make null as static as it could get. Look at cyno jammers spam. Look at timezone tanking, when even EU/US entities set them to AU/CN TZ. This is rather ridiculous, isn't it?
---
BTW krabs won reddit too, so you dont need to sound so serious, like someone is going to argue with you  :)
---
I think CCP should make cov ops cloak not work in sov space, if there is no + standings to its owner.
---
Thats the main concern for NS. Like we dont have an issue with roamers cause they honestly cant do much damage if you know what I mean. Like you kill a couple of subs and perhaps some of our guys chase you around but its all good you know. If the guy that lost the ship needs money for a new one everyone can just chip in so he rebounds.
---
But the blackout enhanced an already growing issue, stukafleets. They are massively OP atm and more and more are using them. And they cant be countered without capital drops, pref supers cause regular caps melt. Dreadbombs were also an issue and it was super easy to setup traps simply because you had more than enough time to do it in a no local environment. 
---
So its really hard to balance small gang with big gang activity. If small gangs get an advantage then it will become a massive issue for big gang advantage. And all of the sudden you are fighting 600 guys in stukafleet comps that melt everything in sight short of supers. And if you become a threat to them they just bounce.
---
Venture's &amp; ships with warp core stab cant plex.
---
Well
---
Farming in fleets in teamwork (aka some are farming, some are defending the farmers) is not an option?
---
They've nerfed rorqs like six times and they're still kinda broken if you multibox. Shows just how badly they were originally balanced.
---
Very true.
---
Investors and shareholders: Those changes you made, they've tanked paying player numbers into the ground. Are the leaving numbers the bots you were talking about?
---
CCP: No. We have solod evidence tbe bots just mooced to High Sec. The leavers are majority long term paying players. But r/eve called them carebears so we dont care about them.
---
Investors: So have returning players and newbros replaced the exiting numbers?
---
CCP: Well they swore to us on r/eve they would return in their thousands but that never happened. And the new player retention is in a bad way so no.
---
Investors: So why are you doing this?
---
CCP: We wanted to appease a tiny % of our playerbase with changes that piss off the majority of our paying players.
---
Investors: So the company we are funding is actively driving away the largest income scource we have in the game because a vast minority, who (Even post blackout) are not resubbing and logging back in in the numbers we need to keep the game, our business, the thing that pays your wages, viable, caught Hilmar's eye?
---
CCP: Well Olmeca is very sexy.
---
Investors: True but I dont care. You are activley damaging yhe playerbase and the game.Find a way to fix this to a balanced change that doesnt make people want to up and leave the game or revert it back.
---
CCP: Well the playerbase actially had some good ideas, spooling cynos, local being tied to structures that lowered ticks in that system if online etc. But thats fixing things and that takes dev time. Soooooo
---
Next Day at GFleet: 
---
CCP: Local back Monday  K thanx bye.
---
~~CCP Radio Silence~~
---
The argument for passive moons is the same argument for anomaly isk, just from different ends.
---
It just shows, the only way to balance them is to just remove their ability to mine.
---
It's summer and there is no school, what else did you expect?
---
CCP, my money stay in my wallet.
---
Right now people are uncertain about future of the game, CCP implemented low effort changes to fix problems and check how we respond. We did respond droping  online number around \~30%, and making small group of pvpers happy. Rollback will give a good result of rage quiting pvpers, and boting comeback from blackout.
---
Oh and Montyhly economic report reaveled that nullsec went almost to 0 pve activiti during chat backout and PVP didnt change.
---
The 10-20 persons which haunt /r/eve although they have quit are surely representative for all players who quit :)
---
Overall I'm not sure if so many players quit. Anyways, for the ones which did quit some proper information would be nice. In general better communication would be better.
---
These are things that players pushed for for years. Increased efficiency of smaller holdings of space, increased rewards for living in space, the smoothing of nullsecs differentiations, and so on
---
These changes were bound to cause homogenization
---
Well the whole community has polarized to a level that PvP people just want to force people to it and PvE players do everything possible to stay out of it.
---
Intense Rorq mining destroys the prices and losing a ship feels like nothing.
---
Massive null ratting has caused abysmal increase in plex price etc.
---
When i started the game plex was 800m and BS hull was 250m. Now plex is nearly 2b and BS hulls are 120m.
---
says the faggot brigading how he doesn't play but the games totally dead fam lmfao. Just cus mommy said your special doesn't mean it's true honey bunny
---
Maybe just a simple solution is to disallow nullification + covert ops. Pick one. Covops can be bubbled and caught. Nullified only makes them catchable and trades off cloak + bridging through blops.
---
scams, obviously... oh wait
---
&gt; Also gdberating isk afk is part of the stagnation problem in eve.
---
No, sorry but no it isn't.
---
Se I AFK farming always existed in this game, and nobody had anything to say about it until now.
---
Why?
---
You must be careful to analyze the causes of the actual stagnation.
---
I suggest to look at injectors, those are the primary cause of capital proliferation, which pushed people to inject (meh...) more and more rorqual toons to provide them. 
---
Maybe if a rorqual toon could not being injected, rorqual cannot dock and keepstars disappear, maybe the capital proliferation stop growing
---
If we also remove injected sp and turn them back to injectors, and limit the use of them to less than 5M SP toons, then the capital proliferation will start to be cured and stagnation with it.
---
Think you have a fan:)
---
new week, new retarded threads
---
wait people think thats tinfoil hat territory ?
---
I have been saying it since they announced it.  They have been unable to fix it correctly or permanately so they removed it from nullsec to take some load off the server and hopefully make low/hi work more consistantly
---
Oh awesome :)
---
Wish they would give fw an overhaul though. it seems like the sides take in turns at giving up and cashing out LP
---
Not all EVE players are checking reddit.       
---
Not all **active** players are looking at official eve forums ^(tbh i don't as it is utterly ugly and nonfunctional)            
---
Like you cannot expect that people that quit will still follow all kind of media about EVE especially that without r/eve and eve meet there was no official information what is changing.        
---
I state the obvious.       
---
CCPlease :             
---
* give us devblog about Blackout end, with the information why it is ending and if it will come back             
---
* send emails about this to all people that stopped playing during the blackout at least             
---
* update us about **chaos era** if it is ending, continuing or what we can expect, a lot of people lost trust in CCP and saying **we will tell you nothing what is coming** will not help to slowly rebuild this trust
---
Cheap PLEX does not really result in more active subs though, since most people would use them to buy extractors and skins.
---
That is the problem you are dealing with when you use the same currency for buying fancy stuff for stuff that affects the game.
---
Ah yes, screw being enviromental, lets join the masses in destroying our planet.
---
you clearly missed the part where nullsec gatecamps stopped, (they were now rorq mining or sitting in a cap standing fleet to defend rorqs,
---
you must of! also missed the part where because gatecamps died, solo and small gang had nothing to go for except rorquals.....that they couldnt kill. so they stopped romaing.
---
if you missed that you missed that now only huge fleetswith logi and FC's roam, because they need to be able to killa  rorqual or whatever drops on it to get content. killing off any solo or small gangs left as they moved around.
---
Every one and thier mom has a Titan now, that shouldnt of happened, and wouldnt of happened without rorquals. and that led to the fleets getting boson dunked by titans like theyre nothing. which mostly put off invaders at all. 
---
yeh, rorquals are of NO REASON any shit happened in eve.
---
I mean I dont even consider local to be on the top 5 of the biggest issues in the game atm. But since we are currently embroiled in this crap then most def, thats a good compromise. I would like to try a 15-30 sec interval. The gatecloak aspect might need some change due to the size of the system tho. Maybe remove it in big systems and have 30 sec so you can actually have a chance to get in scan range.
---
for all 25 accounts?
---
6 hours a day?
---
Pffft, casuals
---
All it needs is a redesign of the industrial core to only allow one active on grid.
---
don't worry dude, there was eve before the carebears and there will be afterwards.   
---
What will happen (and also happens in parts of space which are not full of smallnuts hiding under the skirts of the supercap momma) is that the pvp people will go out and pve, for a while, then go and pvp with the income. It's only natural, I fail to see why you would think a dedicated, extremely risk-averse carebear is an asset that adds value to this game, when it clearly doesn't.
---
Blackout is gone due to huge hit on the CCP bottom line.         
---
This bottom line is created by people paying for subs and buying plex.          
---
**So obviously people that paid quit the game**        
---
I 'Plexed' 2 accounts after CCP communication - not considered to sub them as i am not 100% sure what is coming and what is going away.              
---
Like who knows - maybe blackout is going for a month and then it is returning ?        
---
Maybe blackout is replaced by something even worst?                
---
^(aka lost trust)
---
Actually it was PL/NC that started the whole HTFU/adapt or die crap back when they helicap dicked everyone. It just got thrown back at the "elite" pvp crowd when the meta changed. So please get the facts straight
---
EVE 2020 where shitpost are worst than ever
---
Tbh the new destroyers are way to powerful.         
---
T2/T3 destroyers or the 'kiki' should be much more costly.     
---
They behave better than cruisers.
---
Maybe the ratters should get friends, and have that cloaky recon or handful of bombers next to them then. A pve ship should never genetically beat a pvp ship unless fit for that sort of bait. Why the fuck would you think shit like a myrmidon should beat a Loki....
---
Angel caps were meant to be reward of NPC sotyio.            
---
We got Blood caps, Gurista caps, Serpentis caps ... and CCP stopped the work on this.     
---
There is even a serpents carrier , simply not published.
---
Your statement is based on so many premises I don't even know where to begin. Simply put, if the game only contains players who like mining and ratting in relative peace, it inevitably dies in the same way Serenity did. No conjecture needed, just repeating the mistakes of history. Mining and ratting is given meaning, is defined, in the broader context of the game by the combat potential those gathered resources represent. If there is no combat they are meaningless, and the game slowly grinds into oblivion.
---
I understand why you do it.. But its like basing general inflation on the price of gas. Its not that useful when talking about purchasing power but everyone still gets pissed when it goes up. Its just not the correct approach. But I understand, I dont like the price going up either. My opinion has long been that CCP should set a limit on the price on PLEX and change it at intervals if needed to ensure it doesnt get out of  hand. This would fix the speculation aspect of it as well.
---
This is what I've been saying the whole time while wearing my tin-foil hat. 
---
The blackout was cover for them to fix their chat servers. The free skill point summer or whatever, or was called, was so they didn't have to hear people bitch about local being fucked and then give out free skill points. It was a preemptive attempt to stop the bitching.... but CCP forgot how bitchy Eve players are. 
---
I still think a delayed null local would be good. Something like until the ship decloaks or they say something in local, which ever comes first. 
---
P.S. been winning Eve since the summer of free skills. Winter is coming so I'll probably be back soon.
---
This was happening EAY before BO so... +1 for OP's Idea.
---
I am aware about this.             
---
But the damage was done and my assumption is that CCP considered this fact before deciding to remowe the BO.
---
6 hours, is that a warm up or?
---
Suggestions like these (make ships harder to get into, more expensive to build, etc) only serve to crystallize the problem at the top and ensure that no one other than today's big dogs will ever be able to grow into anything relevant. 
---
Suggestions like reducing the respawn rate of anomalies or adjusting the security level of a nullsec system based on npc kills (or simply removing green sites) would impact megacoalitions more than smaller player groups and encourage people to spread out, for example.
---
Nullsec campers "play" the actual game for however long it takes them to log the campers in.
---
Next thing to do is analyze the data you get over a couple weeks of camping, figure out when big stuff is out when it really shouldn't, then focus your playtime on that period of time.
---
i still think the release of classic wow, and it being this time of year is as much a contibuter than anything.  alot of people left alot of people came back.  the biggest diff is the people who left had dozens of bot/afk accounts.  like with any changes to a games life cycle itll usualky balance itself out.  worst thing to do is to panic and go backwards.  wich is exactly what ccp does.  instead of fixing the new broken and impossible to navigate agency window they blame other changes.  oh well
---
The influence of the CSM in large part is the cause why we are where we are now, where a bunch of asshole carebears can hold the game hostage to turn this into farmville online
---
They waste all Dev Time to create NEW PLAYER EXPERIENCE. Sorry you wont see any major changes to FW/WH/Null/LoW in near future. They might change some variables but that's all, nothing breath taking (Exclude Graphics team, they do great job)
---
I so love hear you people spout this crap now because it started with the "elite" pvp groups back in the day and then the meta changed and you have to reap what you sowed.  SO as you guys have been saying all along( practice what you preach) ADAPT OR DIE OFF MF
---
yeh but amount of stuff to work on, millenia
---
six hours?  i assume thats just between bathroom breaks.  filthy cadual get a damnd poop bucket
---
krabs cant do such things.
---
That's what super umbrellas are.
---
I was surprised to see you did not slip in low sec gate to stain among the things people have been asking for years...
---
we all are ;) but i guess they won't share them publicly
---
Just to throw a bone in their, but people that quit explicitly and only because Blackout are no loss for the game. In 9 of 10 cases it were plexxed multiboxes (no direct cashflow for CCP) and mostly are avoiding interaction with other players outside their Netflix-Discord-Channel ...
---
Look mom a retard
---
I agree with you, local is not the worst problem of Eve by a long shot, I do think blackout thought us a few things.
---
1. Current (non blackout) local is too powerful a tool, making hunters feel helpless.
---
2. Having no local makes hunting too save, making PVE players feel helpless.
---
3. Bots relocate from null to high sec without local.
---
Therefore I feel a balance would be best for the game. However, this is a lower priority IMHO compared to citadel spam for example.
---
I've said it a bunch of times, but they should delete enormous and colossal belts. No rocks bigger than like 600,000m3. Then you could get less rorqs in an anomaly and they'd have to switch rocks and anomalies more often.
---
We've all been on page 598 of the cloaky camping solving thread.
---
snuff being chink pets atm
---
Props to their draugur pilot, he was making havoc for our logi pilots more then once.
---
Great. The topic of this thread is delaying Local, not arguing that Blackout was the correct solution, but ok.
---
Please yes. Revert the shit that was done. 
---
Then fix SOV, slaves, tiericide, killing of excavs, fixing timers on citas, LS, HS. The order doesnt matter, just start fixing shit. And also, give delayed local a thought. A balanced approach will work, just take it easy.
---
Do you really think Eve PVP is "compelling gameplay"?  Gate camping?  Ganking? What?  It's shit.
---
just five
---
&gt; And you present this like, it's players fault that, they are playing in the most optimal way. Most of null loves wars
---
I don't think hes presenting it as the player's fault at all. His post literally ends with "CCP has designed itself a very precarious corner, and getting out of it is going to be difficult".
---
Oh youre exactly right about that.  CCP has been fucking things up like this for a long time. I expect nothing less.
---
Two steps back and when they take one step forward they do it without telling anyone.
---
And frankly I'm not sure whether this was forward or back. When you have a mature game every single change is going to cost you some customers. You will have people quit on the first day for the most nonsensical of stuff but people will take a year to return if you do something right. Plus, some customers really **aren't** the target market for the game, and you can't burn the core game down chasing the wants of the next 5% potential buyers.  Well you can, and companies do it all the time.
---
Anyway, I tell everyone that Eve is the best game I ever played. I wish I could say CCP has made me want to come back since i left in 2007, but they haven't. I think that tells you just about everything.
---
Do you ever hunt yourself when you get bored? :)
---
Stuka sound like cancer tbh, I’m all for dreadbombs tho because there’s far too many supers and titans in game and I like it when they die. 
---
I’m in favour of a delayed Local, not the Blackout.
---
&gt;on multiple language fleet
---
but....if they don't understand the first time....how are they going to understand on the 30th time
---
Permission problem with the shared cache folder maybe, can't see the whole thing.
---
Well that's the problem then isn't it. Not everyone in your alliance is in on the program. You still have carriers and rorq's doing their thing with no back up, not in comms, etc. So the hunters get their low hanging fruit and are back the next week because there's more low hanging fruit. 
---
Just because your line members are too dumb to participate in counter play, doesn't mean counter play doesn't exist or have an effect on the number of hunters in your space
---
You might be trying to run it on Linux... don't.
---
Welcome to the game! Don't let that Eve Vegas announcement deter you from playing.
---
Oh ye Im with you on all points. I didnt even consider local much before this so it gave us all some insight into what it actually does. Im all for balance and like if a group wants it very bad then for sure, prio it. As long as they dont just end there.
---
I think what the age of chaos actually brought us more than anything is the insight that most players are frustrated at the lack of change. The fact that CCP hasnt really done anything "valid" in a long time. We were lulled before this but CCP opened the box and I dont think they cant close it again.
---
I believe CCP themselves use plex as a basis to measure the economy.
---
Problem with the blackout was that it was an easy change that didn't require a lot of dev time. Introducing the tools to make the blackout work would however require more devtime and with 70% of development going into NPE they just don't have the resources to get that to work it seems.
---
I thought the narrative was that krabs have fifty billion supers protecting them 24/7 and that nobody could kill a meaningful number of them.
---
This is not entirely true. I am a new player and I started EVE because I am SICK of the quickmatch "I play 2 weeks and it gets boring af" games. So I wanted something more complex to be a long term game. I am definitely not the only one out there.
---
DELETE THIS
---
We don't actually want those people back!
---
Shh you are ruining his narrative with facts.
---
I don't think you can.
---
Happy cake day
---
TBH, I enjoy tears from both sides.
---
requesting to change your username to lawlful_whiny
---
It's clearly a Mac dude...
---
Just leave game
---
Capitals have a fair bit to do with the lack of battleship usage as well.
---
See Ivan, if you make no promise, you never break promise and you always look handsome
---
Except super umbrellas don't create content / fun. They are just a hammer. Random response fleet are the best fights I've had in Eve, and rarely are one sided. Super umbrella are the least fun of all.
---
It was 18 ....
---
Ok.
---
They most def are. Like even when you drop caps on them you lose the isk fight. They are cheap and extremely mobile and you cant lock them down cause they use booshers and dictate range whilst having great range themselves. Its really fun to fly them simply because you are so OP but to defend against them is a total bitch.
---
Ye like dreads have to siege. You are risking assets and thats totally cool. Its actually fun content for all sides even tho they usually win the isk fight aswell. But its hell of a lot more cumbersome to get the dreads in range and all of that. Stukas you just take WHs and all of the sudden you have a couple of minutes to react.
---
Stay away from reddit, it's full of ppl bitching.
---
The obvious abuse is regular T1 frigate thunderdomes. If you really want to abuse it then you give them all a smart bomb, hit approach on a can and count down SB activation. Suddenly my little frig is involved in over 200 deaths even if it died itself. That should help cover my ratting for a couple of days.
---
Honestly i dislike all changes to local as if i come to system i want to know if there is someone to fight or not.              
---
For me much better way is to incentivize people to fight ... and if they decide not to fight you also get something from it.           
---
Posted like yesterday small suggestion to link local with ESS ^(plus some mechancs) to sum it out :                
---
* no local : 50% boost to bounties           
---
* local comes only with ESS and if you reinforce this local/ess module - this accumulated payout can be pulled out only after ~24h reinforce timer. While this structure still works so the payout will be even bigger unless people decide not to use the system for 24h
---
&gt;where, exactly, is the danger for those players whose playstyle revolves around ganking ratters and miners with T3Cs?
---
look at this guy, totally unable to conceive on how a ship could possibly 1v1 another ship
---
That would make sense ye. Cause I heard Hilmar talking about it in terms of inflation as well.
---
Olmeca did pay a visit
---
That metric only shows that a lot of people in null sec blocks have a "high sec mentallity": 
---
Completly risk averse, completly unable to adapt to situations, "heard mentality". 
---
You're food...
---
Why the fuck do you think a carrier shouldn’t beat a small ship? ;)
---
Isn’t that the narrative?  They got big friends and the hunters cried foul/for nerfs, leading to these dumbass chaos changes that nearly killed eve?
---
Hey mister PvPer. Have you tried to actually move to the places that are more lawless? I mean, if you come to Delve expecting to just waltz around killing shit with little effort you've come to the wrong place. Can you do it? Yes, but it requires ingenuity. Anything you do in a nullsec empires space will result in them sending overwhelming opposition because a large proportion of them are like a pack of starved wolves. Ever time, and I mean every time you join a response fleet and you don't catch the attackers you will hear howls for blood and things like "Can't we just kill the crab we just saved?".
---
&gt;Cloaks are killing the game and not risk averse null empires
---
how dumb are you?
---
Injectors sure are part of the problem too.
---
Even if there was no injector the problem will be the same., juste the rate at people are able to fly rorquals will be slower but they will still be too easy at multiboxing.
---
Citadel and infinite anomalies of ore and combat have make possible for a single region to sustain alliance like test/ goons/ ph which is stupid
---
And you’ve done what about that other than point the finger at rorqs that
---
in case you forgot
---
inject 0 isk into the game?
---
TBH it is not about arguing who left but information from CCP.        
---
Maybe CCP could share some of the information like what was CCP goal for blackout it the goal was reached and what was the reasoning for removing the blackout almost instantly.               
---
If CCP gave like 2-3 weeks ahead information about it to players and removed it without it, like this points to very fast decision due to some fact.
---
Software that moves around and records these things for you helps with that
---
I mean, not that a bot could exist for ANYTHING but pvp.... but if it could....
---
That’s how it’d work
---
Well enjoy it. This complete cave in to Null bears has made me unsub all my accounts. I’m no longer willing to tolerate roaming for hours in Null sec while krabbers use near2 so they can dock up when I’m 5 jumps away or failing to catch BOTS that start warping to safety before I even load grid on entering a system.
---
This gate will affect people in Stain and regions around it.        
---
BO affected everyone.
---
I dont disagree that there are/could be better alternatives. But imo local isnt even top 5 of the issues we currently have. Its just easier to compromise to something less than perfect but easy to implement over more complicated things. After that I honestly dont even wanna hear about local for years until the real stuff is fixed.
---
You would think after 15 years of the EVE player base taking things to the extreme CCP would have learned. It's almost like they put no thought in to the possible outcomes of the mechanics they put in to their game even after being warned by the players.
---
I seriously think the EVE player base knows more about EVE than CCP does at this point or CCP just doesn't give a fuck.
---
Yeah like you farm too much a system it becomes a lowsec one (with a public station ?)
---
Lol good.
---
Or maybe stop trying to force everyone into a single play style.  Not everyone wants to PVP.
---
Dumb enough to believe facts.  Killing vexors and myrms won’t ever do shit to anything but your ego
---
And cloaks exist for cowards to lose even less while hunting pve ships
---
you fucking retard
---
If afk mining is what you like, then look at what items to produce, where to sell them and the logistics of making all of that. There surely are some groups you can join in HS for that. Joining a a NS alliance will get you access to much larger market and more ressources but the gameplay will get the same except people can (and will) gank you for sure. 
---
Mining / hauling missions are kind of both boring and not that worth it isk wise.
---
&gt;I seriously think the EVE player base knows more about EVE than CCP does at this point or CCP just doesn't give a fuck.
---
It does make sense with the amount of time most players put into eve, and that the majority of vets understand the game better than CCP
---
Damn, I thought writing based things about Nullsec Meta brings you the most neg karma, but it took me 2 weeks to collect as much as you in just a few hours ... hats off
---
it nearly swiped out all the needless pussies from EVE but sadly CCP stopped it :-(
---
Don’t play in NS then, wormholes don’t have that meta
---
So instead NCPL did nothing. Asset saftey extracted from both regions so they wouldnt have to, god forbid, fight during extraction. And then waited untill CCP's dicking around saved them on both fronts (Drifter attacks caused Goons to pull back home, Blackout and cyno changes drove GOTG membership off a cliff. Neither caused by NCPL.)
---
So when does NCPL declare themselves elite winners again?
---
More like a -1.0 could change to -0.1
---
you stupid -12k target and you rage go buy a brain monkey
---
The Blackout announcement was a joke.
---
" chosen to represent the average player opinion"
---
Because all players only have one vote, right?
---
Sorry but for me best years in eve are before we had a 'slowcat fleet' that conquered half of eve.     
---
I see no problem with all goons living in Delve i see problem in the fact that you can have sov or prevent someone having it in area next door that you don't live in.
---
Yes i understand that Rorqs dont inject isk into game but rather make ships so cheap that losing one doesnt matter at all.
---
Maybe people go for ratters to trigger a response or to remind people thay being afk is bad.
---
Some of the hunters just want easy kill same as ratters that want easy afk farm
---
You're supposed to catch it in your standing fleet when it jumps the ratter not be able to make sure that nothing that threatens you can ever reach said ratter.
---
as we say in the old country "you just let the pigeon fly out of your mouth" there  
---
 
---
&gt;The main issue is an expensive, focused PvE *or* PvP ship will still eat shit to a gang of 10 dudes designed to hunt down and frag it. (Even if you're ratting in a bait pvp ishtar, if you get caught by a 10-man cruiser gang you're buggered.)  
---
The thing with PVE now is that everyone and their dog tries to figure out ways to make it as much solo as possible or, at worst, with multiple accounts for the same player. That's why you see shitty, mind-numbing fits like tinker rattles that grind through a fucking site in 30 minutes.   
---
Sites should encourage group content with all sizes of ships, in pvp fits (which means high mobility, neuts, scrams) and whose rewards scale properly with the fleet size (maybe a variation on the way they do the avengers in c5 sites as you warp in caps).   
---
That way, when you get jumped in a ratting site, you are already there with your fleet, making dank isk, everyone is ready to rumble and you would have basically a three-way with the rats. THEN you can point the finger at the roamer gangs and tell them they are a bunch of pussies, IF they don't engage with those. RIght now, they would obviously go for the low hanging fruit of a single dude ratting in his little rock haven.
---
You’re pretty dense
---
Ratting with a super under a cap umbrella with 0 risk although you get 100% SRP helps nothing but your ego. Go get your 15th rorqual alt and then wonder why eve is dying
---
In fairness, no amount of dreadbombs would have stopped it. The mineral supply has been stupid high.
---
TFW you believe in 45k persons...
---
and again *sigh*:
---
- Login count 2015 saturday EU prime BEFORE Citadels and Lifeblood Rorquals ca. 55000
---
- Login Count February 2019 Saturday EU prime BEFORE blackout 25000-30000.  (Decline 40-50%, although the number of accounts per player exploded due to multibox meta and SP farming)
---
- Login count after blackout saturday EU prime 22000-25000 (Decline to before blackout 15 %)
---
Well that only means one thing. Null sec is not your duelling ground. CCP needs to develop content that will give you what you want. And give them what they want. Separately. Null sec IS fleet warfare you can't force a fair fight in that environment. So instead of changing null sec. Fix FW or something instead.
---
Cyno changes haven't ended super umbrellas, what are you talking about
---
My point was the previous commenter was in error in suggesting that crab regions experienced no PVP.  They do experience quite a bit.  They also usually have some of the better fights.  The low-density renter type regions are a different story
---
 **TL;DR:** Please inform all crabs that they can come back, log, undock and afk crabing in null again while watching netflix.
---
Karen?
---
I agree that small fleets fighting eachother without caps getting involved at all is the most fun. It's just not a good strategy for actually getting people to leave your space.
---
The way EVE is designed right now puts fun skirmish fleets in direct opposition to most forms of individual moneymaking in null. It's hard to design space to be both a team-deathmatch arena and also a place to live.
---
CCP never communicate anything, like what even is the plan anymore, they have barely 'announced' the end of blackout.
---
You would think they would release a dev blog or something that they were ending it with reasons why to end the arguing.
---
and you lose the Eve argument by default because you involved real life.
---
I am here but not getting back. The blackout change was such a dumb unsophisticated change (dont get me wrong, I am absolutely in favor of more risk but not dumb binary changes with binary outcomes), that it’s the final nail in the coffin in terms of confirmong CCP is hopelessly incompetent in the area of game design and balance.
---
Not my vid, but this guy deserves all the views he can get, tries interesting things, takes challenging fights and often leaves having killed more than his ship was worth, if not holding the field altogether.
---
doesn't feel like it.
---
Completely unable to adapt to situations. Right. Which is why Goons are top of the food chain right now. It might be hard to accept but they adapted to all changes better than all of you ever did. Half of Eve came after them and Goons got stronger for it. But naaah they've just... got this high sec mentality. If that's true then the HS guys have the right idea.
---
the issue is the "speed of isk" as ccp have shown, if you can print isk easily everything will inflate, make supercarrier ratting and rorq mining impossible and see isk prices plummet
---
Try going into the launcher settings and switching from 64 bit to 32.
---
Rat in a Domi with Neuts, Cap Injectors and dual rep tbh. Ticks wont be as sexy but hot damn will the Loki cry? :D
---
Forums and viral communication.
---
If you're crab who quit due to blackout, I'm pretty sure you'll checking for this kind of information on yourself.
---
They paid for what they got.
---
If you sub to such a complex game and expecting it to stay the way it is, you shouldn´t sub!
---
Just deal with the fact that it might change if you pay in advance.
---
Just put covops cloak and nullification both as defensive subs so you can have one or the other.
---
You don't have to be a speaker at Eve Vegas, don't worry about that.
---
Flair checks out ....
---
Yea there are a hundred ways to do it. Just like people could have rorq minded during blackout. But effort....or 'mah ticks'....
---
So you can't name a metric to prove blackouts success. I see.
---
Perks of being awesome.
---
Couldn't you sacrifice a small amount of your tick by not fitting optimally for ratting? So fit a scram to hold the hunter whilst your friends arrive.
---
You're calling to remove cov ops from T3Cs to discourage risk averse playstyles, which in turn minimises your risk.
---
You're complaining about people calling for nerfs whilst calling for your own.
---
An honorable man and scholar too.
---
I can assure you you are dead wrong , when you go below c5 :))
---
Oh how I wish we would finally get rid of AFK campers. Like I dont get how some have been crying for afk ratters/miners blood for years but they dont mind afk camping. Which literally is away from keyboard, like they just log on cloak and leave the house and nothing will happen to them. Whatever happened to "the only safe place is in a station"?
---
True.
---
Honestly the game is just as fun as three years ago for a solo player. Most of the stuff that people moan about like local and cynos impacts endgame players in null. If you want to do LowSec PVP/PVE it's just as good. 
---
Null is now much safer to live in due to citadels being spammed in every system so much easier to just crab up a bunch of money. For example I trained a rorq mined up a Hel hull and built myself a Hel with enough ore left over to build some rorq hulls cuz I didn't know what to do with it. 
---
The biggest point of drama on r/eve is exactly that. It's laughably easy to get everything you want out of null at virtually no risk of ever loosing a ship if you're paying attention or even if you're watching Netflix you're still gonna be fine for the most part. Most sensible players want that to change so null can be a challenge again and that's also what CCP and Hilmar want which is reflected in the Chaos changes to local and cynos. However a large part of players in null have been brought up in the safety of the last three years and their leaders are leading a campaign of propaganda against any change that disrupts the status quo.
---
Yeah, its quite often used as a steady point of reference. Thats why i referenced it as well.
---
Or CCP was experimenting and saw that the negatives outweighed the positives and backed out the change.
---
But as people who warned this was a bad change were told - harden the fuck up.
---
Can we?
---
Stop being so dramatic guy, take a chill pill and enjoy local:)
---
Would be cool to maybe have a cloak remove you from local. Offer any solutions though and you just get called a krab for not wanting a total blackout. Not allowed to have compromises right? I mean Eve is a sci fi universe why would we not be able to detect incoming fleets in your own territory. And I think in an advanced universe like that, certain ships should also be able to dodge that detection.
---
Hmm, well CCP listended to CSM around 2013-14, when representatives  of a certain group pushed towards a more farms&amp;fields meta. Seagull delivered with Citadel &amp; Lifeblood. The outcome was 50% Login decline in 3 years (until BEFORE blackout), Seagull (and the deliverer of bad news Quant) had to go and CCP panicked themselves into blackout. So be careful what you wish for if you are really here for the game and not the "wellbeing" of a certain group ...
---
No no no it's ONLY bots who left, everything is fine. Radio silence from every worthwhile eve blog because all the blogbots left. Comments on EN24 and mittani news down to a dozen from 100s because all the comment bots left. Crossing Zebras dead on its ass because the article writing bots all left. It was allllll bots, everything is juuuuuust fine.
---
Top tier shitpost right here
---
Yes.
---
&gt; There is no reason to engage in massive wars across the galaxy except for constructed reasons
---
even if there was, nobody wants to fight these bipolar wars with the bandwagoning culture of the game, which makes one part of the population to fight against the rest, when people tend to pile on one side of the conflict causing 4000 ppl slugfests.
---
&gt; It's hard to design space to be both a team-deathmatch arena and also a place to live.
---
Yet it's how it should work because making isk making assets basically risk free is killing Eve. It's not as drastic as blackout but people are leaving the game slowly due to a lack of content, along with the very big issue of isk faucent going on the very wrong direction until the recent changes.
---
It's Eve online. Risk vs reward should be the rule, and economic assets should not be free of harassment and destruction (and neither should harassment / PvP have free reign of action with little to counter them). It's stupid to think one side is better than the other and it's suicide for Eve to catter toward one or the other especially with big axe swing in the changelogs. Removing local is stupid. Having observatories providing local intel that can be destroyed in sub 5/10min and takes 30min to 1h to online create would create content. Sticking 30k players in 1 or 2 regions with enough ressources for all of them is stupid, reducing ressource availability per region would spread players and make umbrella a lot smaller.
---
Eve isn't some mobile game. You're not entitled to the best income methods.
---
We are exactly as risk averse as anyone else. Do you normally jump out of windows and off cliffs for fun? No? Us neither.
---
The game doesn't give us an enticing reason to risk our shit, so we don't. We are not cowards, nor are we carebears. We just don't play the game the same way you do.
---
Personally I could never make myself have fun in killing others. Spent a year pvping in FW but it was purely for ISK I could get from these kills. Spent half a year small-ganging in nullsec but it was purely to play with my mates, working as a team and supporting them. Could never make myself care about kills we get or losses we have.
---
I guess it’s just very personal if someone can find fun in killing others.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCT80HJWQ2A

So... that's why Goons begged for it to be back ?
---
playing a game simulating real life economy
---
I like how you're in literally every single thread making the same dumb argument that is debunked by like 3 minutes of rubbing as many brain cells together.
---
The danger is in that after today's downtime they can very likely roam for 6 hours and not get a single fight because "oh look someone in local, better safe up"
---
Carebears = Cowards
---
Living in wormholes and solo roaming leads me to losing an average of 3 bil per month with 0 SRP so no you can't call everyone else risk averse just because you nullbears are
---
the chat name is "SF spectre fleet" and MOTD (long list of text that loads when you load a chat) will list all fleets, its all random times when some fc wants to take a fleet out
---
and give to all ships +4 WCS,
---
delete ventures
---
give rokh,vindicator 100% mining yield bonus
---
make covert cyno able to lit in highsec and wormhole
---
delete local from all areas,replace ith with contact service array  structure that replace loca,no fuel required but 250mil ehp.
---
give us t3 battlecruisers and t3 battleships and  soe covops titans with 37% scan strenght.
---
covert cynos now consume strontium clathrates
---
regular cynos restored,all ships can fit it but can be lit low/null while covert also wormholes/high

concord now can destroy citadels of those who commit criminal act
---
security system lifted,you can  fly with loaded gun at your own risk..
---
Glevon Was Right
---
Honestly I don't think they know how to do faster. The balance in the game is left to stagnate for years on end before clearly broken ships are looked at whether they are overpowered or underpowered.
---
A good scale on their ability to deal with issues is the Griffin navy issue... Let's see how long before it gets reworked because they fucked it with rushed ecm changes.
---
&gt;Why doesn't a solo kiki wanna fight our 3 ramjags with two web lokis and 2 munnins i don't get it man
---
Ah ye that makes sense then. A lot of people have been talking about it which is why I feel it needs correcting. It gives a false sense of the health of the economy and might trigger extreme reactions that instead crash the market. Which I feel the blackout was doing.
---
Titans have been dying before you can respond. You can spy on a titan ratting without them ever knowing. Get ahead of them in a different site. Deploy an inhib before he gets there and before he does it's already online. The fastest response you can get is to cyno fax in off grid but even then they'll bubble fuck and you're not going to get close enough to save anything. You can't have a reasonable number of Fax on grid with you at all time and even then it wouldn't matter because bombers dunk Fax too. Even if you only kill a Fax or two and don't kill the titan the bombers just peace out, killboard green. Lose the entire fleet and they're still ISK positive. And one guy is short a Fax or two and already he's lost so much money. When even boson ratting can be so unprofitable. What were people suppose to do? There's no reason not to live in low sec at that point.
---
Sounds like you want a nulsec newbro friendly Corp. There's a bunch out there but as a fellow braveling I cannot recommend them enough. 
---
They do everything they can to get you started and get your participating in fleets.
---
Marrocsevestory.wordpress.com
---
It's old now but still relevant for new players to see that they don't have to wait to get involved.
---
Destroy a ratters ship.
---
Then tell him to get in a PvP ship.
---
Can't pay your way to victory in pvp.
---
Jesus the posts on here lately.. really? I’m fully convinced 80 percent of this sub still has their mommy tuck them in at night.
---
Oh look, more insults and not a single metric.
---
Blackout almost got me back as a paying customer, because it was the first serious step to reversing capital proliferation and powercreep.
---
Then I remembered injectors still exist and facilitate a level of paid cheating more at home in a Zygna game, so I just log on as a free player, say hi to people I know and slowly burn away my assets.
---
Bombers and all Triglav ships make sub cap response fleets even less viable options. Even more reason to drop supers instead. Perhaps the spooling effect should only work in WHs.
---
Let's not pretend anyone goes on roams for the greater good here. "Remind them that being afk is bad" my ass. You just want your easy kills.
---
Hunters don't chase lions, they hunt game that can't fight back.
---
Sauce plox.
---
Interested too to know
---
Can't speak for the others but brave newbies gives you free ships, free skill books etc to get you started and if yiu want to join a fleet but don't have a suitable ship then yiu get one for free as well!
---
It's all about being involved in what ever you want to be doing.
---
Targeting range on keepstars is 350km and that would be the DD range as well. Don't quote me on it, because I just looked it up with the info I could find. If you want to check in game, it is "Standup Arcing Vorton Projector I".
---
I'm not sure this guy gets how PLEX works.
---
Yeah I know, the vanguard should have come with serpentis fighters as far remember, and I dont want to even start talking about the drone fighters. But yeah, so far I only heard that the angels are caps pics that are floating around are only "fan made". But tbh, why would we need more faction caps atm, doesnt ccp have other stuff to work on atm ?
---
Yes. When it reaches a situation that you prefer to not play the game at all then try to react... yeah... food...
---
T3C's are about 2 billion+ with a pod and before you account for the skill loss, they jump the gates blind so any if anything goes wrong ( decloak drones etc ) there screwed also they have like 6/7 second align time like there really not as uncatchable of people pretend they are o and even the best pilots will catch nothing 95% of the time.
---
but please keep going how hunting is to safe as you are aware of there position 12 jumps away.
---
Localized defense fleets are not. The payout from ratting isn't anywhere near enough.
---
Ratting only makes big bucks when you do it for hours on end and/or multiple accounts. Good luck keeping a fleet of antsy PvP nerds there long enough.
---
So... You got your ass kicked by a few dozen players using a built-in wh mechanic... and you lost everything with no asset safety. 
---
That ever happen to your null corp? I have billions of isk worth of assets in a wh right now, with no asset safety, I'm well aware of the risk but I don't see how it's safer in there then it is in high/low sec. 
---
Do you mean it's safer to RAT in wormhole space? Cause it's sure as shit not safer to keep all your stations, ship's, and gear in them, right?
---
Why not, so long as fitting a cloak means you cant fit a scram or disrupter, intel or tackle choice.
---
So it's safer... But you got your asses kicked right out of it and lost everything you had in there?
---
To what end?
---
To make a single KM per player? Irrelevant.
---
Your ideas are poor.
---
I had this once when i bought omega status - it was ok after a relog.
---
Suuuure.
---
Clearly? Can you see something the rest of us can't?
---
Could be either from what I can see.
---
Blackout was fine.  Of course there shouldn't be open communication in nullsec if you don't want there to be.
---
However, this should have been an opportunity to create deployable structures that corps/alliances could set up around gates to see what ships are passing through.
---
i.e. strengthen the dscan mechanism and make it more important, and if you need more recon, get it from ingame assets that can be countered by blowing it up or hacking it.
---
Why do you think its ridiculous? Its not a competitive game and both sides can multibox. If anything its good for the game because ccp gets multiple subs from people and theres more things in space to shoot at. Also multiboxing makes the gameplay feel much faster, which is pretty slow at times.
---
New to here can someone explain what's the story of those 2 alliances I keep hearing about? Test is Reddit right ? And goons ? What are their goals or their mission statement?
---
And why the hate ?
---
Thanks

Angel caps were announced by a dev at edu 2016(?). It was an official reveal, not fan made
---
yea nice, when I proposed we get a mobile base like thing, I got my shit pushed in, when you propose it you're closing in for the gold :P   
---
must be my charming ways. But enough about me  
---
1. the dark matter is pure bullshit tbh but the intention is pretty good - it used to be you got nanoribbons because they had a chance to drop from frigates too so you would swat them as fast as possible and salvage after. I think that can still work - c1/c2s were a haven for salvage 
---
2. Add the booster gasses and consolidate existing ones and/or make them used in existing recipes (not just t3s) 
---
3. fuck right off with that decloaker :)) 
---
4. C1 are usually industry/PI holes 
---
5. add effects to all holes and add more, varied effects based on class (that is that only happen to c1 holes e.g.)
---
6. moon quality, ore quality and planets quality decreases as class increases 
---
7. Chances for ice belts to spawn decreases with class increasing (up to class 3 maybe )
---
8. chance for booster gas clouds increase with class  (up to class 3)
---
Farms and fields would have been fine if they had also created some raiding the silo and torching the field and salting the earth gameplay. But no, basically the only PvP in the F&amp;F era is saying boo at the farmers until they hide and wait for you to leave or forming an alliance with 6 nearby countries and starting the hundred years war.
---
You know he's not talking about solo ships right?
---
Maybe get your own head out of your ass first &lt;3
---
To add to your list there were boosts to mining, like ore composition, that made mining in nullsec way more viable, scalable and profitable. Also industrial structures that did the same for invention and production. 
---
Plus anom escalation changes that crashed the prices of pirate BS BPCs. Hurting DED runners and pirate LP shop, two of the main sources of NPC-null income.
---
&gt; Eve isn't some mobile game. You're not entitled to the best income methods.
---
The weird thing is that nullsec ratting isn't actually the best income, or the safest. It's just the most straightforward and scales well for alliances. High-tier Abyssals absolutely eclipse null ratting ticks, followed by Incursions and Burner mission farming. Unless you're ratting in a super or multiboxing rorqs, you will legitimately earn more money in highsec.
---
Null ratting is popular because it's obvious what to do, there is no "trick" to it or anything to learn, and it can pay for decent gear in a reasonable timeframe. It also looks like "endgame" content to newbies who don't know any better.
---
If I were CCP and had unlimited resources, I would redesign null PVE to be a lot more like chained escalations. Start off in an anom with shitty rats and no loot, get sent to a series of progressively more difficult complexes in different systems, with escalating payouts. Gate the complexes to be totally inaccessible to capitals, but include a large number of fast scramming rats so you can't always just run when hunters show up in local.
---
This is the age of null bear supremacy. The returning of their precious local has made them bold.
---
CCP has handled blackout horribly, they managed to pissoff both pvpers and krabs
---
nice blob sound.
---
Stop using tiny fonts.  It's a pain in the ass to read.
---
Believe it or not. It's not actually about local. 
---
It's about the mindset behind the change.
---
I agree with the blackout being perhaps a little heavy handed, even though I support it and it is 100% responsible for me resubbing to the game.
---
I feel like a half measure of some description would have been better. Same with the cyno changes. I agree with restricting them and making the lighting of a cyno a more tactical decision. I feel like the change was too heavy handed to be palatable.
---
I'm not going to pretend to be a game designer and I'm not going to spout off a bunch of my own bad ideas.
---
But I will say that the chaos era/blackout/cyno changes to me was a show of CCP recognizing the problems and at least trying to change them. Even if the changes were wrong, at least they are trying.
---
It's felt for years now that the game is slowly transforming from the brutal, unforgiving hellscape that was the EVE I loved, to farming simulator in space.
---
I don't know exactly when the gameplay loop shifted from pew to the most "risk/reward, isk-efficient" activity I can find. But it feels like we're stuck in the turbo autism of old-school runescape XP gains. If my ticks aren't max-efficient I'm playing the game wrong.
---
Not EVERY change can be catered to making the lives of krabs and miners easier. Some of them have to be for the other people who play the game.
---
Slowly but surely, me, and guys like me, are being patched out of the game. So yeah. It feels pretty bad.
---
no its not. its RNG
---
The big difference is that (especially in the case of rorqual) it's the most afkable and scalable form of income, and it basically transform into cheap capitals / supers for your alliance. Sure it's not the best isk / hour but it's surely is the best brain free method that get you more than enough isk. And let's be honest most people want that. Remove afk mining in Eve and you will see the same angry people than you've seen with the blackout (except maybe adding HS miners with that).
---
Nullified covops T3C's aren't that tough since the rebalance.
---
Did you mean Gevlon Goblin?   ::roll eyes::
---
Yes, blame the miners.
---
So what you're saying is that to counter a lone cloaky, you need two accounts, and to counter a cloaky gang you need to tank enough so your friend come and help.
---
Yeah, right, this is nullsec man, not wormhole. You rarely take 45 bombers on you while farming in a wormhole.
---
And the "untanked ships" are pve ships. I know that's a difficult concept for you but still.
---
You choose to be in wormhole and live in a constant no local scenario (I did that for two years, I know how it works), they didn't. You're compensated by the ability to somewhat control your own space and have high payout anomalies which don't respawn fast. They cannot control their entrance unless gate camping 24/7 and have low payout anomalies with infinite respawn.
---
This is nullsec, you're in wormhole. What you want is nullsec being a cheap wormhole full of easy targets.
---
Oh no.
---
you simply lose all progress in that training.
---
so if your at 4 finished, and your 50% to 5 and die, you go back 0% trained of lvl 5.
---
Good for you. And how do you pay for that? Please don't tell me you run anoms in and around your hole! You filthy krabber!
---
Wew lad, the risk averse don't like this one.
---
Yes as we all know when a T3C moves about in coalition null looking for ratting ships it actively avoids the honorable solo fights on each gate. That's what cloak nulli is about yes you're 100 percent correct.
---
esc &gt; reset &gt; clear cache 
---
normally fixes things like this, if it ever happens in the futrue
---
good to see that Dead Terrorists still kicking asses
---
well, debatable but yeah:)
---
&gt; In 9 of 10 cases it were plexxed multiboxes
---
*Sigh.*    And your evidence that this isn't a BS statistic is ....?
---
WTF is it with Redditors and imaginary statistics?
---
It is more to point out that :              
---
1. CCP announce something        
---
2. Never implement it or implement only part of it          
---
3. Stop working on it just to go to point 1.         
---
It is about finishing what was started and what players are waiting for.         
---
Why mention faction caps?         
---
Because in game like EVE you need a goal.        
---
Having a goal gives you reason to play.           
---
For example as a loyal servant of The Sansha Nation my goal is to obtain Revenant.             
---
I can afford one but for me the only valid ways for me to obtain one is :              
---
* get it from Sansha Nation (like BPC in lp store)              
---
* steal or reclaim one from someone else                  
---
Buying one from someone is not a possibility as you cannot get a Revenant BPC in another way than stealing the BPC from Sansha Nation.
---
The gray under her arms ruined the immersion.    
---
Typical CCP legacy code.
---
&gt;1: Delayed local. ...
---
I don't see the Point. If people don't get perfect Intel from Local they use Gatescouts as they did when they had no local at all. The only thing that changes is that you now know when you are permacamped by Cov-Ops again.
---
&gt;2: Citadels. ...
---
Don't have a strong opinion here. Yes, the amount of Citas spammed in some Systems is insane. Maybe reduce Citadel defenses the more of them are in System? Would also incentivise Alliances to spread to multipe Systems and to keep their Systems clear of enemy Citas.
---
&gt;3: Asset safety.
---
I think Asset safety should stay. Don't punish people for taking a break or they might stay away once they hear that everything they worked for is either behind a massive fee or in some mercenaries pocket.
---
&gt;4: Warp speed.
---
There should be a reason to have faster ships. Increase BS warpspeed a bit and give medium and large warpspeed rigs bigger bonuses.
---
&gt;5: Buff Marauders and blacktops battleships.
---
Marauder Bastion needs a huge buff. They cost almost as much as Dreads and are basically worthless exept for L4-running in Highsec. Maybe give them something fancy as well, like a special Bastion module which does 50% Damage redirection  that redirects Damage to the Marauder while in Bastion. This would make them really useful, but not too powerful since they can not get logi assistance while in Bastion and restricts Fleetmovement to the Area which gets protected (if they want to benefit from that Aura).
---
Blackops are Paperships, just give them the Option to fit covert cloak.
---
Imagine if players had to... Shock and horror! Work with each other and cooperate to make money. If only there was some way we could facilitate this cooperation... Some sort of co-op-oration perhaps?
---
Nuh uh. You see, Lil' Billy who joined in Nov 2018 is having the time of his life in Eve Online so the game is just fine.
---
I know how plex works and that someone bought it first.        
---
Simply i had plex and you plex for 30days.       
---
Subs that i bought so far was from 3 to 1 year.         
---
Currently i "committed" for a month as i don't know what the hell CCP is doing.
---
&gt; Oh boohoo it's so hard to have a citadel in every system, a cyno for a super cap blob to come save you, multiple structures to make your space safe and now local again to tell you the moment any of those naughty pvpers show up. So tough. 
---
Ah yes, the carebear argument where the guy you're talking to is probably a manchild incapable to undock in space unless there is a confirmed 0 possible danger in a 20  system radius. Real genius, easy way to discredit the guy. Well too bad it works only with your friends.
---
&gt; I've spent most of my game time with small and medium alliances usually on the outskirts of the big empires. I've had alts in Imperium, I joined NCdot for a while (yuck), I've done the BL munnin thing. Since 2011 I've done pretty much every kind of pvp you can think of. I've done plenty enough of scouting and everything in between. 
---
Totally sound like you did nothing of what I mentioned. Everyone has alt in the Imperium. Anyway, if you don't like it, that your choice, don't play it. Don't fuck with people that like it.
---
&gt; "Who the fuck cares about your opinion." Well who the fuck cares about yours? That's not an argument. 
---
I'm not the one blaming the "dirty krabs" for everything, making a post on a topic we already have 45 other posts about in the last 24 hours, to show how much I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should.
---
So yes, nobody here cares about your goddamn opinion.
---
&gt; As a new player, I havee no fuckin idea what's going on so i'll just be lurkin
---
No need sir, very few people here have any clue what they're talking about and it never stops a single one of them.
---
His posts are pains to read lmao
---
Sounds COMMUNIST
---
^ This! It works for 32 for me.
---
The answer whenever you brought this up was "just remove local and nullsec will be a paradise". Guess how this turned out.
---
Apparently you should have subbed them earlier.  Oh well.
---
What exactly a solo kiki expected ? He can kill nothing but miner and afk ratter. Or should i bring a t1 frig to fight him to feed ?
---
Remember that it needs to be split between every person on the killmail, else it becomes a dupe exploit.
---
The Bar at the Bottom is the Dock from a MacOS. Especially the System stettings button, [see here](https://www.designtagebuch.de/wp-content/uploads/mediathek//2014/10/mac-os-x-10-app-symbol-systemeinstellungen-700x700.jpg).
---
I run missions in lowsec with no protection from others. I lose blingy ships occasionally but still make enough. That's how all pve activities should be.
---
&gt;Drifter attacks caused Goons to pull back home
---
Provided a good excuse to get the FC already getting frustrated with unmanned structure bashes a break because as much as GSF went this is fine of course they didn't enjoy the process. 
---
Reality is with numbers so transparent nobody is gonna fight an enemy that so massively outnumbers them, goons didn't and neither did NC.
---
Imagine not being an idiot and thinking about what you're talking about.
---
Adapt or die you piece of Veldspar
---
Good question, could be, but note that Falcon had the same idea and said there were other CCP guys that were in agreement.
---
This.
---
Also for me the setting doesn’t save, so you need to remember every time you start the launcher.
---
Neither am I, it just seems that *only* frigates have a place in FW, so if those newbies want to dip their toes in anything other than frig brawls, they've gotta look elsewhere.
---
You wish, dear.
---
It seems to me that CCP has painted itself into a corner and is now stuck with a system that is guaranteed to cause massive inflation and stagnation, eventually leading to the death of their golden goose
---
Lol ye. A case of "be careful what you wish for".
---
&gt;Undock, get out, find some targets and start shooting. Larger alliances/coalitions, please do your part and destroy this blue donut. Make enemies again, bring back the wars and bring back the content this game needs to survive.
---
yes yes, I bet people are eager to travel 50 jumps to find a vni who is afk and isn't an instadocking bot.
---
As long as you undock a ship, you should expect to loose it at some point.
---
Ratters are used to trigger your «lion» response, if ratters are not attacked there aren't a lot of people roaming in their space to patrol and catch potential hunters.
---
People go on roam to kill, if it's easy and in numbers of course people will go for it and when a solo player comes, does the local respond with one ship to a go for a fair fight if they undock something ? No they will go in more/bigger ship to blob the hunter.
---
If there were more people in pvp ship in space, hunter would go to them but when space is full of ratting ships they go for that.
---
&gt; TLDR Just down vote
---
ok
---
and this sub
---
Maybe, or maybe not. You must not have used Linux before to know how customisable it is. That's ok though, I'll help you. See this link - www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/best-docks-to-use-on-linux/amp/
---
Ok will add this channel when back home, thx
---
As long as it forces people to move out of their confort zone to rat to take some little risk I fine with that
---
He's a carebear.
---
You can fight any brawly ship (with some exceptions) . You can fight mid sized ganks solo etc.
---

Perimeter is 1.0. So you were freely engageable by everyone.

* Security status of -2.0 or below means you'll be attacked in 1.0 systems.

So you really believe that goons players are forced to be were they are?
---
Are you sure it's *just* the tiny-ass fonts that make his posts painful to read?
---
Big ships need to die.           
---
Titans should not be viable at ratting - the fix for it is just so fucking obvious that i wonder why CCP didn't implement it already.           
---
**Just spread out the spawning points of rats for most ratted sites**             
---
If you cannot boson them ...           
---
As for big kills. 
---
No ship should be safe.
---
WTF I thought it was an official post from a dev!
---
I was going through the list and the points looked brilliant!
---
Holy shit I thought it was real.
---
I want to believe! Make it so
---
&gt; Then I remembered injectors still exist and facilitate a level of paid cheating more at home in a Zygna game
---
That ship has sailed a long time ago with the introduction of plex.
---
Haha sure m8
---
There's also the fact that the settings icon is the standard Mac OS settings icon, same with the trash bin icon, and a few other icons on the lower bar. That, and the silvery-white soft edge to the screen, it's clearly an iMac.
---
Maybe pull your head out of your open-source ass?
---
My man, since you took the time to respond in a respectful way I will return the favor. We are not on opposite sides of this. We all have our list of what we feel needs changing. Local and cyno changes were low on my list but if anything these changes have taught me that its high on others lists.
---
Thats why I and many others have been saying that these changes were bad simply because they would backfire. They took things way too far and we knew people were gonna leave forcing CCP to either revert the changes or flat out kill the game in a matter of months. There was no middleground and thats the issue. I still believe we have bigger issues but I dont mind them taking a backseat to atleast give you guys a reason to log on. 
---
Cause you are needed as much as the people on the other side. I dont like griefers tho, thats my line in the sand. I firmly believe griefing is why this game is suffering from low retention rates and in general has such a crappy reputation. But I dont think a majority of the PvPers are griefers so.
---
The guy above you. I replied to you therefore I'm speaking to you. 'This' guy when speaking to you implies speaking of somebody else.
---
Hilmar thought that too. You're as good at game development as hilmar.
---
EVE made over 12.5M $ for last 2 periods and 10M$ earlier.        
---
Whenever CCP will show us how big effect on the game blackout had we will see it.            
---
What this have to do with krabs?         
---
Well if CCP is rolling back in panic the Blackout you can assume that the bottom line was hit hard.               
---
This say that **people who paid subs and bought plex** were quitting the game.    
---
I don't know if those were krabs, like i don't know that.
---
but this requires CCP to have *common sense*.
---
 What they have is badly made icelandic crack cocaine.
---
Sadly, the "needless pussies" make up a significant fraction, perhaps even a majority, of EVE's playerbase. Make of that what you will.
---
When someone makes something in my freeport raiteru it gives me a job id is it possible to get info on what their job is from that id?
---
I'm guessing they implemented blackout in HS? Or is chat just messed up? Can't even see myself in corp chat on any toons.
---
KeK. Grr goons is a meme.
---
Marauders, Blackops definitely need some love. The covert cloak ships should actually benefit from that in certain way when it comes to local. Makes no sense that you can be seen in local if the whole point of you flying cloaked is not to be seen.
---
TFW you get all your info from Goons so you think otherwise.
---
&gt; Escalations usually require special fits to do, as the overseer turret fires very damaging torpedos that have to spec tanked with deadspace hardeners
---
you are aware of the fact that not all plexes are 10/10s right?
---
&gt; Escalations usually require special fits to do? 
---
most of them really don´t 
---
&gt; which need a couple mods in order to have a cap stable tank against
---
they need exactly 1 mod. a prop mod. either to sig or to range tank. or both. i wouldn´t call a prop mod useless in PvP.
---
Love the fact that the pic shows a very obvious possible bot name.
---
Depends production could be done in a lot of ways i do it on my alt for fun. I usually just buy materials in jita and turn them into items in my raiteru.
---
You can also mine them aswell just depends on your playstyle I would recommend https://eveiph.github.io/ for calculating your profit!

A simple Google search got me this https://www.deviantart.com/haris0328/art/Mac-OS-X-El-Capitan-Icons-for-Linux-708416609 try harder :)
---
why would i? i´m pretty sure i nailed it the first time around.
---
With all the current issues with Eve Online, i think this guy has just fixed them all.
---
It is mangos staging so not surprised.
---
Yeah I know
---
If you can multibox alot, it shows that this particular activity needs little to no input from human, and is most likely dull and dumb. Doesn't matter if it's rorq mining (and mining in general), VNI/myrm/ishtar ratting or capital PvP.
---
Simple answer: everyone hate these citadels mechanics and they need a fucking nerf across the board both in spammability and tankiness/timer/whatever you'd call that. Not downvoting.
---
TLDR fuck citadels
---
Somehow Teferi is behind all this.
---
Tldr: everyone wants changes that don't affect them. CCP should come up with changes that don't really affect anyone but still substantially change the meta game.
---
you can shoot one structure after another.  or in our case have multiple groups running ib different low power stations.  if you hack the structure first you can figure out the vuln timers and set it up so you can kill it the same week.  typically most people set there finals for Saturday so wardeck sat before initial bash sunday then go back saturday before wardeck ends.  low power you can usually bash Tuesday and still get sT timers   need five day minimum between armor and final typically.   if you or your group are interested in (or anyone else) learning current hs mechanics im willing to help teach.... for a price
---
1 person, 1 character
---
You’re wrong.
---
&gt;Wormholes deleted by popular demand.
---
Finally. This change will have been needed for a very long time.
---
Why do we need local back in null? 
---
Sorry but I don't find any other explanation that for ratting/mining. 
---
I agree that no local alone was not the best way to promote pvp, but we need people shooting people in this game. If ccp doesn't do something we will just stop playing at all. What's the point farming isk if nobody fights anymore? 
---
Here they just step backward and it feels sad imo. 
---
Today If I jump to my null sec static I will do 15 jump without meeting anybody. Tomorrow with local back I will just see some dude in station waiting me to leave. I get that blackout wasn't a magic solution here, but at least they tried something. Here it just feel they give up
---
Yeah.. but i only see  myself, and when i was in a POCO with an epithal, boom... killed by a non present guy.
---
CCP has reviewed your idea from r/eve and dediced to deny your idea any further work.
---
Reason: Good idea but to implement it would require actual dev time. And that costs money. Cant have that. BTW how is the new expensive Office fit out going?
---
Maybe you shouldn't anchor something in a wormhole you can't defend and can't afford to lose?
---
yeah, you lost.. but you are trying so hard... awww
---
to be fair hs was fkd today as well.  these sleepers and trigs need to be put down once and for all
---
nice catch :P
---
Well you said it. Every sane people in this game is aware we need changes, we will just fight those that will have a negative impact on this game.
---
You can have nerf, buff, whatever, but some as heavy-handed as blackout and recent cynos changes are doomed to fail, because that's not how you handle a playerbase. Rorquals nerf were better, it was done incrementally because the nerfs were needed and it didn't destroy the ship from the face of the game right off the bat.
---
I still disagree with these Rorqual changes (I feel they should have somehow made the ship active instead) but at least they achieved some effect without being that hard on people.
---
We want to change nullsec, we're the first people wanting it (the sov system is boring, the structure bashes are cancer, the pve is completely afk, etc...) but some people keep treating everyone as dirty krabs because "krabs leaving the game made CCP rollback blackout". Guess what guys, everyone told you that would happen.
---
As reparation for that terrible event I'd like to present you with this coupon for one (1) free extra hour in the ballpit.
---
yes, I didn't catch it the first look either
---
You're *
---
disclaimer: i rorq mine while cloaky t3c hunting for my blops so i feel like i have good insight to both.
---
translation:
---
my group is too antisocial to gatecamp and catch the slow warping t3c, or help each other in anyway so please just delete them so i dont have that problem anymore
---
You claim that you are easily outnumbered in your own space, and that t3c have 0 risk. The former is sad, the latter is false. 
---
srsly have you ever went roaming?  Unless you have 0 friends near you, "gankers" going into your space shouldnt be outnumbering you all the time. Most likely you have some people there but no one is taking leadership and setting stuff up. You be that person and bam this problem gets solved. 99% of groups wont bother to try and stop you gating around, so if your part of that 1% i'll just go somewhere else where theres lazy ppl. Its not possible for the enemy to just n+1 you everytime. they start roaming with X people and then they have x people. cant just gate into enemy space and find a 5man gate camp and magically teleport 6 people in, but if you have 5 people most groups have 6 people active to fight them.
---
buttttt ya wont. so few people ever want to work together in eve, just be selfish and pull each other down... like a certain type of crustacean.
---
T3C are not risk averse because fitting nullicloaki on a t3c makes them align really slow, making them very easy to catch unless they are 100% travel fit which then they cant gank you easily lol, and even then Simple Farmers does it all the time.
---
Not only can they get caught on gates, ive killed several t3c in old ratting vni. even easier with a domi now,  get a warp disruptor for helping with drone aggro and then you can put neuts in the highslots and an MJD in the mids. and bam, you cant get ganked easily. really that simple
---
also super easy to bait people. have friends waiting in station. 1 jaguar and some dps = dead ganker. vast majority are bad and solo so really easy to kill them. 
---
And for me, hunting is the joy. I dont care what I kill i just like hunting. reading maps and comparing with zkil to find quality targets to locator etc makes me feel like a bounty hunter. 
---
tl;dr its not hard to kill a lot of hunters, very easy to bait them. If a few people roaming into your area keeps you constantly outnumbered, you need a better group. Use intel channels to setup gatecamps, stileto can easily decloak and tackle a t3c unless its 100% travel fit which is exceptionally rare for a hunter.
---
occam's razor, it is a mac
---
&gt; When the "part of the problem" group outnumbers your side, you might be looking at things from the wrong point of view.
---
that´s like the most retarded statement i have heard this month. kudos for that.
---
Well that a big decline.
---
The fact you have to work out a low power structures most effective time slot by scanning, then running it through a quantum computing algorithm to then just find out when to shoot it for the best result in the final timer is really the issue here.
---
Why would anyone want to do that?
---
Structure grinds take waaay too long
---
[Yes](https://imgur.com/a/ZIbS2XL).
---
Overtime is the best IPH you will ever get.
---
Yet to see proof.
---
Age of incompetance confirmed!
---
Nothing other than unless you defend it Goons will most certainly get a expensive kill-mail thanks to you and loose no resources or very little in the process.
---
I have killed puny Asteros with puny ECM drones with more than that.
---
Eve ws never a pure PvP game. 
---
Biggest early corp? An industry corp.
---
First largest Alliance, Indy corp who blued a smaller merc corp..
---
The attempts to try and rewrite what Eve's history actually is to fit your "Narrative" is embarrasing.
---
Eve never was, is nit and never will be a pure PvP game.
---
Stop posting bullshit.
---
I think being able to walk around inside the space stations would be great for immersion.
---
maybe your too much of a pussy to, but i drop on forts and a keepstar once with t3c+blops =)
---
stop being shit at the game and you can too fam
---
In HighSec don't you also need to be at war with the target corp/alliance in order to pew pew their citadel?
---
Maybe CCP could lower the maximum base timer of citadels, and allow additional hours/days based off of corp/alliance collective security status / reputation level with the empire's space they are in.
---
If there is a way they can monitor activity for a given citadel then maybe this can negatively impact the timer if activity falls below a certain level.
---
test does it all day everyday. dreddit is recruiting btw
---
The blackout dropped plex price by 7-800mil (500 units)
---
No.  
---
Bad.
---
Keep telling yourself you could be right. You must be a delight at party's
---
&gt;adjusting the security level of a nullsec system based on npc kills
---
There's a simpler solution. Make completed sites respawn elsewhere in New Eden, similar to how they work in wormholes. This causes sites to accumulate in systems which have not had sites run in them and forces entities in null to move their krabbing operations and infrastructure periodically in order to maintain income, or to spread their krabbing over a wider area and make it harder to defend with centralised supercapital formations. It also causes systems with high activity to become increasingly vulnerable, as it becomes harder to maintain the Military and Industrial ADMs.
---
Convinced the blackout was cover up for them fixing broken chats. All chats have been breaking recently.
---
&gt; has no counterplay but staying in station
---
get friends and fight back.
---
ah but youd always bring 30 people or caps wouldnt you... and wonder why hunters go for the lone retards lmao
---
It was a good change for the game, in absence of the strong desire of the majority of the playerbase for near-perfect safety.
---
you're arguing for a d-scan nerf?
---
"Gimp your fleet just so the other side has more fun" is a dumb argument
---
Didn't say boson ratting should be a thing but when you can't even survive in a titan anymore then you can't survive in anything else. Assuming the attacker doesn't royally fuck up there's literally nothing you can do about it. That's the degree to which the game had been rigged. You can't fight it. So we used local to avoid it. Now you can't avoid. If we can't avoid it then it needs to be easier for null to fight it. But it just got even harder with the cyno changes. The only alternative is to just not undock it. At which point you're a krab for not feeding to them.  
---
As for big ships 'needing to die.' Doesn't solve anything. Doesn't help anybody. If the sole purpose for wanting to make the largest ships in the game so vulnerable is because there's too many of them and you want them gone. Then all you're doing is unbalancing the game by devaluing what a titan is, because the game is already unbalanced in how many of them there are. That's not a good way to fix anything.  
---
As I understand it. CCP only ever intended for a handful of these to exist? At first at least because I don't believe that anymore. They pushed hard for capital warfare. Injectors. Rorqs. They advertised the hell out of all the big fights. They kind of wanted it. And I don't see how anybody with a calculator couldn't figure out that there'd be more than a dozen through the simple method of n+1 because a titan is pretty much entirely made out of infinitely farmable resources. We all act like we didn't know the solution to this but we did. How many Revenants do we have in the game? Moloks? Vendettas? Aren't these perfect examples of exactly what CCP had envisioned for super capitals?
---
Let's ignore kill value per capita, shall we? Completely irrelevant statistic, nobody will miss it.
---
I keep logging in to banned messages from chats and having to relog and rejoin them.
---
Oh thanks, I am. Even if the OP were to say it is a Mac. My argument is the clearly comment. Show me what makes it clearly a Mac?
---
As a general rule, the more assumptions you have to make in order to be right the more likely it is that you are not, in fact, right.
---
bore off
---
Maybe those people are all that are left after 2 years of getting supercaps dropped on everything. Ganking stuff and running away is the only style of gameplay that stayed somewhat viable this whole time, everyone else has fucked off.
---
Instead of balancing ships and improving on existing game features - CCP just started turning features off and flip random switches in order to please the /r Eve wormholler voting brigades! Now observe how player community actually works. They have to start doing the dirty and hard work with the players. Make new stuff, balance on old stuff - don't remove core game mechanics and expect people to just love it - not everyone is a CCP fanboy.  
---
 R.I.P. Falcon and your bullshit stupid ideas.
---
You don’t actually want to fight, so stop complaining that you cannot force someone else to engage on your terms. This is true of both sides in this eternal argument.
---
Like human conflict throughout history, most Eve PvP is just bluffing, posturing, and baiting. Most of the time, the cloaky camper is AFK, but most people are afraid to call his bluff. Most of the time, both sides want to shriek and yell loudly at the other side, while making rude gestures, rather than close in for the kill. Most of the time, players do a very clumsy job of setting the bait, so the fact that it is bait is obvious to all but the most inebriated or foolhardy players. The baiter does this because he doesn’t really want to fight either. If he does too good a job setting the bait, he might actually lure someone in who wants to fight, which means the baiter gets a fight, rather than a one-sided massacre.
---
Oh I'm sorry, you must have misread. I asked for your proof. Keep trying though.
---
Make them use more fuel and remove low power mode to selfdestruction timer like 3 days. All problems solved, oh and selfdestructed citadel will get a normal loot fairy like WH. GF
---
"The reality is that null is there for people to build empires and part of that is having peace." you build empires by going to war... your comments are a great example of how warped the residents of nullsec have become.
---
I think you trying to complicate a very simple process. If anything is low power is should die. If that's how the old POS mechanic worked and High Sec, low Sec, Null and WH space if full of low power structures then they should be taken out in 1 sitting and have no reinforcement timer at all.
---
If you own a structure and allow it to get to low power then you as the structure owner should not own that structure anymore and is bad structure management.
---
Low power = 1 Day
---
just stop playing the game mate no one will miss you faceless goon linemember no 19502
---
Why would anyone want to gather some basic intel before attacking a structure? Gee... I mean, I have no idea.
---
http://prntscr.com/p6qhb8. Its on the launcher
---
People want fun. 
---
If you have to take more risks or you get less reward for doing the same thing, people are just going to quit, it's mechanical.
---
CCP has to do some "positive changes": if is negative for some people , it should be seen as an improvement by at least the same amount of players. 
---
If you only remove stuff from the game the effect is disastrous.
---
Don’t be dumb and fit scram+heavy neut+web on your little domi
---
or get heavy neuts + dromi and sirens on your carrier
---
or get cloaked recon alt with your ratter
---
all can wreck T3 hunters and you’ll get juicy 2b km
---
ratters have lots of way to kill T3 hunters since T3 rebalance
---
You must die to hunters if you don’t fitted to fight against
---
Only dump chat logs once every 10 minutes instead of in real-time. There, Near2 is now useless with 0 other features being impacted in a significant way.
---
Because K space != WH space.      
---
Unlimited access, cynos, stations, structures.              
---
Something that work in one area will not work in another.          
---
While blackout helped people hunting ratters it at the same time  :                 
---
* don't introduced any counter play for ratters other than to stop activity and/or quit ^(what they did)                
---
* ESI was still providing all information so hunters easily knew in what system who is ratting in what TZ           
---
* **what is the most important here** if you wanted to be saved if tackled only supercarriers provided enough EHP for someone to form up and help you. Subcap ratting was no longer viable in the blackout era ^(afk myrms that are designed to die don't count)          
---
* I think blackout for CCP was meant to be 'god feature' to weaken the big blocks ... and it was, but at the same it killed all people that were smaller and tried to live in null space.                 
---
TBH while Blackout is ending the repercussions in much lower numbers will stay, hopefully we recover some players and stop current bleeding.               
---
CCP will need to put a lot of work to rebuild the trust of the playerbase.
---
In its deployed form it wasn't a good change, it went way too far towards PvP.  Near perfect intel became near perfect no intel.  A balance needs to be found so that PVPers can catch things but give non-PVPer some ability to get safe.
---
That being said it's a complex issue that CCP tried to apply a simple fix for that rarely, if ever, works.

Can someone explain to me wtf is going on I've come back to EVE after a few years and I don't get it, what is the blackout?
---
wut
---
Okay, for one this video suits so good to the title, but on the other hand, that is a real room there, so ewww!
---
Just last night i was watching from a fortizar as hostile dudes had anchored large bubbles on an ansiblex in BWF. So i mean, you can do it. Have also seen people drop bubbles in horde staging but ofc that tends to provoke a rapid response. I mean, boo that people defend stuff.
---
If you need a cyno to kill a solo T3C you wouldn’t have killed it with a cyno fitted anyway. Most subcaps in this game not fitted for EHP are not going to last long against a group of T3C so cynos aren’t too useful there.
---
So in any case, cynos don’t matter for survivial in a ratting ship but cooperation does. T3Cs can easily be caught in gatecamps, also nullified ones that are not ultra-bling with Nomads plugged in. No need to remove nullification from T3Cs.
---
But you could start to trap them to get nice and shiny killmails...

"We will remove local for some time to collect data"

---
Idiots :D
---
You are again totally wrong.
---
Eve's basis has always been an Economic and Industry based game with attached PvP.
---
Dont believe me? Then ask why CCP had a full time economist on staff to ensure the markets and ingame economy was stable, why the earliest strongest corps were miners and Indy guys who could fund and make the ships needed to fight the battles the PvP guys wanted and had the isk to hire Meecs to defend them.
---
PvP players keep trying to twist the actual history of Eve to fit their narrative. Pity its been so well recorded that is so easy to prove people to be wrong.
---
Reminder, citadels HAD to be a bit OP to start with to actually get people to use them, and it would be hard to nerf them suddenly too hard because people would then just move back out. If you remove asset safety you think people will want to actually hold BPOs or other high value things in citadels? :\\ The whole citadel thing had to be to entice people to use them (i remember this from fanfest).
---
&gt; This is not a PvP game. This is a PvE game. You can remove PvP from the game but you cannot remove PvE. Thats a fact.
---
Haha, saying 'that's a fact' doesn't make ridiculous claims like that any less ridiculous, my dude.
---
inb4 'thanks for proving my point' lol
---
yes. I want a linear increase per ship, with a slope of the damage cap.
---
So for an astra with three engaged IASes you would have 5000+(3\*5000). if it were one it would be 5000+(1x5000). 1 *plus* 1 x 1 is 2.
---
Reflection of the keyboard on the screen
---
1: Dont think more than 30 seconds would work. Its honestly not even needed, good hunters can find you with ease in a small system with that amount.
---
2: No timers on low power. But it needs to have some "if its been low power for x amount of time". Remove shields on all non low power structures. You bash them twice, no more. No asset safety on low powered structures can be discussed.
---
3: No, dont touch asset safety outside of the above. It will backfire massively. There are no issues whatsoever with people keeping their stuff to be able to fight another day. Removal or touching it will end up in player behaviour changes that only brings about more boring aspects. We dont need more boring.
---
Yeah it's finally time to make some hands roll
---
That's the best and only proof I've seen. Thanks. Although... Haha
---
like I said it before, complete blindness is not a solution. Having to have watch alts on gates is not a solution. Make local delayed or give people at least some other sort of intel tool, not as powerful as instant local is but something that they can use to their defense.
---
Goon posters really make it too easy by constantly looking so stupid.
---
Titan kills are still a big deal, esp if you get more than one. Super kills also a big deal. Game is tbh pretty good, subcaps are insanely relevant to most fights as well. Sure super umbrellas exist but that is honestly just the nature of players trying to defend their own patch (think of them as player equivalent concord) Just means hunters have to both work a bit harder and be more mobile and don't get such an easy time ganking PVE players or miners. (boooo must be annoying not getting easy kills).   
---
Also FYI but rorqs have been nerfed really hard, they are now only worth it if you have at least 3 or more but even then can make more isk with FAR less risk in many other ways. HAW caps not really much of an issue since they can be murderzoned by anti cap guns and HAW titans did get a nerf. I would love to see a hard limit on injectors though (ie no more injecting beyond X skillpoints). Though dunno, really hard to balance. The only HUGE mistake IMO was injectors and I will always agree they were shit.
---
Only break we get is downtime
---
So with Blackout I decided to train up a bunch of alts for cloaky watching gates so I could safely (relatively safely) derp about with my hauler.  Having finished those I'm now training up a bunch of cyno alts, that's Cyno V, Cruiser V and Recon IV.   I've literally done nothing else since (just one uneventful fleet).  I was going to build a bunch of stuff but my freighter (Super) can now apparently only jump to a recon and I won't have one of those for a month.  For this build it'll take me about 5 trips in a Viator and I honestly cannot be arsed with it.
---
CCP can go fuck themselves can't they.
---
If so, they failed. Our fleet chat died as we were jumping supers in to kill a goon dread/carrier/fax thunderdome.
---
We have zero idea why blackout is gone. We can speculate, but unless CCP says "yeah, our internal numbers indicated this was not sustainable" then we're just spitballing. Yes, it makes sense, but we have no real idea. 
---
It's equally as likely that this is just more chaos.
---
It takes 2 seconds to google this. Blackout = no local
---
There were also (and still are) people in the CSM that pushed CCP towards farms&amp;fields (and can do great belly rubs), and sadly Seagull let herself being pushed around.
---
And it is the farms&amp;field patches that cost CCP the most clients and logins. The largest downfall in logged in accounts happened far before blackout. Quant pointed a finger towards that and it cost him his job sadly. But killing the messenger usually helps nothing, and so the P.A.N.I.C. ensued (ironic), Seagull got fired, and CCP desperately tried to get back old pvp-centered players that have quit in thousands before the blackout. But half-assed panic steps dont get back all the grown up old players. 
---
Thats were CCP shot themselves in the knee, 3 years of middlefingers to everyone not playing farms&amp;fields, and then thinkink you can get these people back with blackout and not harm your relationship towards the players you raised with that meta since 2016.
---
If the done it right hell yeah, but probably best for them to test and development as other small game First.
---
Add a NO POWER mode with no timers or anything, it just goes straight through to structure and dies. Citadel stays in LOW POWER for 1 week after fuel runs out, with the same rules as now, then goes to NO POWER.
---
If you really want to clean things up flag NO POWER citadels as suspect in highsec. Lore reason: CONCORD is getting sick of your shit.
---
"Rooks and Kings and PL could no longer suddenly drop all willy nilly." this is something that CCP wanted to change - the life of a veteran is much easier than that of the other players. vets can teleport their fleets instantly and however they like, while the rest of us plebs are stuck using gates?
---
you invoke similar examples several times: 
---
"Hitting a rorqual living under an umbrella and being surprised when an organized response shows up is not the fault of game design" - the issue is the ease of response vs its strength: supercaps are not only the strongest response, but also the easiest: you need the fewest numbers, they are able to mobilize and teleport to where they are needed instantly, while also being almost impossible to fight.
---
Because they realize that there is to many cloaky campers in one system :P Gotta space out
---
this post gave me PTxD
---
Did anyone not see this coming?
---
Why do they call it rage rolling?
---
You mean like most of alliance null-sec pvp?
---
How you can restore something that was never working properly?
---
That's what you get when middle/upper management barks something along "reverse that shit now" and devs scramble to comply, instead of an informed productowner that makes rational decisions with a manageable timeframe to execute.

---
The reason the 500mn hic was bad is that it made wormhole ratting to safe.
---
it may come as a shock to you but most of wormhole space want's more risk in their space.
---
There have been multiple people explaining how to do that and how to nerf high-class farming with minimal dev time, the reason a change such a no rolling is objected to is because it makes wormhole space safer not riskier. 
---
Like all you would have to do is wait for a dead chain ( there not exactly rare ) and then you can rat as long as you like nobody is rolling into you because well nobody is rolling.
---
If you want to increase risk you need to make sure PVP groups are actively rolling holes as it means a fleet right on your doorstep, with your dreads in siege.
---
You mention inability to kill a solo t3c, then mention not lasting long against a group of t3c... Which one is it that your argument is using... Cant use both, because then you're just a hypocrite.
---
Also OP's issue is with cloak, not nullification
---
How fucking obvious was this, right?
---
Oh look, a wild devblog appeared: [https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxx548/2019-09-16-nullsec-blackout-concludes?origin=launcher&amp;utm\_medium=app&amp;utm\_source=launcher](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxx548/2019-09-16-nullsec-blackout-concludes?origin=launcher&amp;utm_medium=app&amp;utm_source=launcher)
---
Seriously, it's people working at CCP so give them some minutes to write something up before hyperventilating about no information.
---
When I logged in, I got excited for a moment because I thought CCP pushed Delayed Mode to highsec as well.
---
if the defender cant even bother to fuel it why should the attack have to do more then the bare minimum?
---
&gt;Like we see Age of Chaos **is the moment when a lot of people lost trust in CCP actions**  
---
   
---
Many experienced players lost faith in CCP a long time ago, but hung around because their friends were here and the game still had it's moments.   
---
But that thread was going to snap at some point when they pushed yer another set of ham fisted changes without iterating on game breaking shit like citadel spam.
---
You can have local or you can have eve, but you can't have both.
---
And when we say CCP, we refer to the devs and not the communists.
---
the gaming scene and market has changed a lot since 2004 - EVE used to be perceived as hardcore as it was essentially one of the first 'survival' games - there are lots of mechanics in EVE that you can now find in mainstream survival games like ARK or Rust etc, albeit in a more hardcore form (in the survival games that is, EVE is softcore compared to them..)
---
Thats why everyone got into cloaky ships and bombed excavators during the BO? Cause they wanted to get a response? 
---
Its a great theory but as soon as the BO hit we saw excav kills spike beyond anything before once and for all proving this narrative to be utterly false.
---
So, apparently the blackout did nothing to stop the decline and even sped it up. So, by which standards was that a good change?
---
Final freedom from game of spod

Damn, that's gonna be a max-cringe from me fam.
---
It's ridiculous because then it's not even N+1 mechanics that will win. It's the person/alliance with the most RL money spent in game that will win. I've seen a multi-boxer completely faceroll a small WH gang. That's 1 player against 5-6 and they won because they warped in a 10-20 ship fleet on top of the gang. Don't get me wrong. It does take skill to PvP multi-box in certain scenarios and fair play to that player. But if you think about it, it's almost as bad as lighting a cyno and dropping some supers on them.
---
&gt; If anything its good for the game because ccp gets multiple subs from people and theres more things in space to shoot at 
---
No, it's good for CCP as they make plenty of money from this. I don't think game play like that is good for any game. Yes, I'll concede, there are more things to shoot at. But it's sort of a false economy. I'd rather shoot at players rather than toons (some of which will be afk).
---
Tell me this (and I'm no expert), but are there any other popular MMOs out there that allows multi-boxing?
---
I reckon if they developed a small FPS game set in the Eve universe it would give a good test bed for it all and then they could slowly link the two games together.
---
Well common sense,and basic economic knowledge. What do you think are market dynamics, and why PLEX prices are sinking? 
---
Also I have insights to different communication platforms, and for example your alliance urged their members deliberately to unsub (not plex) their PvE-Multiboxes to put pressure on CCP to follow your interests. But hey, I know your koolaid is free .... o7
---
First, I think you mean herd mentality.
---
Second, come and eat us.
---
&gt;The influence of the CSM in large part is the cause why we are where we are now, where a bunch of asshole carebears can hold the game hostage to turn this into farmville online
---
You're in the wrong thread.  This is the "CSM is powerless maybe now CCP will listen" thread.  You are looking for the "CSM is OP and Leads CCP Around By The Nose" thread.
---
Which is not true according to CCPs own data  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png).
---
I dont get why people keep repeating the same lie.
---
sorry i had to turn off  8  heavy energy neutralizers off my bhaalgorn that were draining chat systems.
---
One thing I've noticed during my time in EVE for the last 11 months is that they would rather flick a switch than spend actual dev time on fixing things. This mentality has to go and they have to rework shit for real.
---
You're not my dad, Im not down voting fuck you. Have an upvote instead. 
---
Take that!
---
Yes, full risks for us, less risks for PVPers who can still see us. Blackout v1 was a total failure because of the free intel of PVPers, and the fact that you refuse to admit it only proove that you are one of this PVPer Krabs who wanted easy targets.
---
Attacker doesnt have to do anything more than shoot it. 
---
Shooting it now means you get the earliest timer possible. scanning it and hitting it at a proper time means defender gets a shorter warning. I cant see a problem.
---
I was having a chat in local with people in at least 3 other systems. Nobody else was in my system.
---
Good times.
---
Injectors made it miles worse. Suddenly Mr Wallet Warrior could buy 15 rorqual pilots which might not even have been on the market previously.
---
U.S. Dollars, for which I have the privilege of paying foreign current conversion fees.
---
It was not, it was a paniced reaction to bad game design decisions since 2016. But it was not, like many here screech, the reason for the current state of EVE but a (bad) reaction to it.
---
Oh hi there!
---
Why? Because the game spoon fed them Intel they didn't earn? 
---
If you need local to find fights with a 20 man fleet, you're playing Eve wrong.  
---
The point is, it levels the playing field. Theyll never know I'm there if I see them first. If I check out a site or jump a gate without checking Dscan I'm sunk.
---
oh I'm gonna use this line so much
---
A modified directional scanner would offer the latitude necessary for modifying other sources of information, such as system chat.
---
YAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS
---
More deployable structures PLEASE
---
fuck no
---
&gt;  I cant see a problem. 
---
its a unfueled scructure. The citadel shouldnt even have a timer just like posses with no stront. If the defender cant even be bothered to fuel it why should the attack have to spend multiple days to get rid of it?
---
What emotion is that trying to convey?
---
Going to upvote because baby animals :)
---
Fozzie sov means that killing an enemy pve player can help to keep their ADMs down.
---
I get that issue when I try play on my mac. Make sure you change the setting to 32 bit rather than 64 bit.
---
I mean thats basically WHs in a nutshell.
---
Its PVP all the time whether you like it or not. 
---
The ISK is good but once a hole bottems out you basically just have to start doing small gang raids on nearby wormholes till stuff starts respawning
---
&gt; 4: Warp speed.
---
nope.
---
&gt; Most games these days let you hop on, go into a mission or match, and be done in 20-30 minutes.
---
you probably know eve for a long time now. warping is an essential part of the game. giving you (almost) instant jumps just increases that player ask for more and more quicker events. eve is not a game where you kill your boredom with another instant success. eve is business and fun. if you don't like it, go to the "other games" that gives you instant happiness.
---
Why didn't test before update on test server !?!?!? because it is so easy XD
---
&gt;Let's get this straight. The blackout was reversed not because it didn't do what it was intended to do, but because this community is full of no risk pve players that simply couldn't adapt. 
---
I'm sorry, I can't resist:   HTFU
---
There are things that you shouldn't involve real-life comparisons with Eve and some where it's acceptable. This is one of those situations where it's acceptable.
---
When it was first announced I was hyped because I had played all the Wing Commander games and Privateer. But I hesitated to pull the trigger on kickstarter, and later when they made their own crowdfunding site, because in general I was conflicted about giving money for alpha/kickstarter/presale on games. I just figured that I\`ll wait 2-3 years until the game is finished (as they had promised) and buy it then. As time went on and the magnitude of the shitshow became more and more apparent it started to turn me off and the last straw was when the toxic SC cultist started to attack people for very bland criticism. After some time Derek Smart posted his first article (which IMO was a pretty bland at the time). The ham-fisted response from CIG and the screeching SC cultists coming out out of the walls everywhere (including on EVE websites when we would discuss SC development), really got on my nerves and I embraced the schadenfreude of watching SC development turn into a dumpster-fire. That's when I started to really enjoy SC, for free :D . It was fascinating to see how SC managed to transform an infamous character like Derek Smart into the champion of gamers, who fought a relentless fight against the Goliath (compared to him) that is CIG. Needless to say, I now highly doubt that SC will ever be a real game. CIG might declare their current pre-alpha as a finished game to avoid charges for fraud, but it will never be anything remotely close to a finished game. 
---
There is some silver lining though. Thanks to SC I have made a firm decision to never give money for alpha/kickstarter/presale games.
---
Thats true. Im expecting logic from people. Should really learn to not overestimate the intelligence of certain people.
---
Everyone also thinks they are a chef because they like food.
---
Ah yes, shooting a structure for total of 60ish minutes in a few subcaps spread over 2 times is so much worse than bashing 50-60 million HP pos towers, cant remember 100% surely how much hp large tower had before hardeners. 
---
Citadels are stupidly easy to get rid of especially if no one is defending them. what makes them cancer is how easy they are to spam anywhere you want.
---
baiting with lowpower structures is a great way to save isk from war decks.  plus the defender gets to have all their buddies whore in the war.  pirate and hell house do a great job if setting up juicy targets all over just to kick in your teeth later while saving a few iskies
---
&gt;If you designed a game and it was making you money and made changes to it costing you money?  
---
Why are you asking the question in such an obtuse way? Like going out of your way to avoid asking, "was blackout really that bad of a change?" To address your extremely dumb strawman - CCP can do whatever they want. They can make money however they want. You're assuming an awful lot about the decisions most rational people would have made on the idiotic journey to where the game is now.
---
But that isn't the point. That's not even what I said. This is what I actually said:  
---
&gt;A benchmark of poor game design.  
---
In reference to doing what is profitable over making legitimately good design choices. This happens *all the time* in the gaming industry, and you're right - the predatory companies that engage in profiteering at the expense of users are indeed some of the most successful out there -  EA, Ubisoft, etc. While they're successful, they're also widely considered some of the worst offenders when it comes to poor development choices. Notoriously so, in fact.  
---
What's your vision of Eve? Is it one where CCP focuses on maximizing profits at the expense of good design choices, balance, and future sustainability? Do you think it's a smart business decision to undermine the legitimacy of your developers by rolling out an intentionally ambitious change and then quietly pulling the plug without any proper communication about it?
---
Oh how the turns have tabled
---
While I agree you have to understand CCP needed to stop the bleeding.
---
Paying players were leaving, not bots, not characters, actual players. The bots moved to High Sec (You can actually follow them on zkill to confirm.)  The drop in paying and active players was going to kill the game faster than the stagnation.
---
The "Older players will come back to replace the leavers" NEVER happened. Some came back and resubbed an account or two but not on the scale to balance the amount driven away by the change. CCP were counting on this and probably were hoping the r/eve "Im resubbing all my chars." Brigade would stay true to their word. They didnt.
---
In the end Hilmar said he wanted to try sonething to shale up the hame and to be fair it did. He never said he would tank the game just to get his changes in. CCP realised they approached this wrong and pulled back. Hopefully they have an idea of what they want the game to do bow and will try doing it in a way that doesnt immediatly make 80% of your paying playerbase want to unsub.
---
i too love spending an hour to get rid of something no one is using
---
Yep.        
---
Was a local issue ? Not really as it was part of the game for years. 
---
      
---
Citadels, rorquals, excavators where the issues? Yes, and this is new addition that made the game broken.
---
You honestly think because they reverted something they have always said was going to be temporary that they've suddenly decided to stop fixing the game? 
---
What?
---
Intrest and wants to play but scared shitless hissing defending his current passive way of life.
---
yeah but thats who you hunt. Those who would stand uo to you you'd ran from
---
I am of the firm personal belief that the blackout was an attempt to reduce load on the chat servers and give them time to fix their fucked up systems without as many people noticing.  That said, CCP lives up to expectations and failed miserably at that.
---
Some minutes ?       
---
Like the announcement was 2-3 days ago.        
---
This is more than "some minutes"                
---
Blackout coming in was dev blog like 3 weeks before and then another 1 week before it going to start.
---
why is anybody surprised?
---
Ships that can't shoot back have a habit of spawning other ships that can. Furthermore, they shouldn't be free semi-afk ISK makers just because people take pity on them. And finally, many pve ships can shoot back and present a realistic threat to hunters.
---
Amen to that! Thank you for putting words to what a great deal of us are thinking! :)
---
More like the entire house has been on fire for half a decade and the guy in the chair is too high on spod fumes and disconnected with reality in general to realize the fire in his little reality is fairly insignificant compared to the state of things as a whole.
---
Man, this slope sure is slippery.
---
But... Hilmar lived in a wormhole for a week, or something.
---
&gt; Chaos in general is bad for the metagame
---
The metagame is bad for the game
---
Im not... well im going to have to call your mom to get my money back then. :)
---
Yep. 
---
But what basically this post is about?        
---
&gt;CCP please inform us more why and what is going to happen.      
---
If big changes are made please send also emails to people, especially if they quit because some actions you are reversing.
---
_**JUMP IN THE PIT**_
---
You had to clear out old abandoned towers if you wanted to drop your own, you did not have a choice about it. So you sat there and bashed large towers that had been unfueled for years.
---
With citadels you dont have to do shit about it unless you really want it dead for some reason. So, if you hate citadel bashing so much, dont do it, just drop your own next to it.
---
&gt;blackout was fine. Its all the needy krabs that are killing whats left of this game.
---
Now that all the krabs are back there's absolutely nothing to hunt for PVP.    CCPls!
---
I have two theories about what actually happened. 
---
1. It was all intentional, they always planned to end the blackout now. It was an experiment just like they said. But they didn't want people to know if/when it was ending since it might mess up their data. Part of the experiment is how players react when they think it may be permanent.
---
2. It was all a cover up while they were doing/fixing something with the chat backend. Chats have been breaking left and right since the blackout. Maybe then implementing the blackout is what messed up the chats or maybe it's all a conspiracy.
---
Low power doesn't mean it isn't used though. That assumption is basically... false? Maybe add a 3rd level, super low power, which it hits if nothing has docked or happened in it for say a week or something. used to use an astrahus in one of the lowsec systems as a jumping in point for JF, that was low power as it was pointless to fuel it. Sure as shit was being used regularly though.   
---
Beyond that ofc if you go "okay if its low power it dies instantly if you forget to fuel it" just punishes the defender/owner. IF someone misses something/goes AFK/fucks up or even if someone in a corp purposely does something, at least now you get some time to deal with it.
---
We don't need to know why they did it. I agree with OP that they need to tell folks it's over, but the why is unnecessary. If anything it's just going to cause more drama.
---
Unfortunate that you resent to random accusations instead of arguments but let me elaborate in my points.
---
A solo T3c isn’t hard to kill or avoid. They can bring tremendous DPS to the field but this has downsides. It doesn’t take much to kill one, a domi can do it or at least force it off grid. Even a random drake can. So for this case you don’t need a cyno at all, you could do it on your own.
---
A group of T3C brings enough DPS on grid to kill even thick battleships quickly enough before most people could have assembled help for a cyno if it’s not dedicated bait.
---
So in either case cynos have not been as relevant as some people made them. Proper cooperation with friendly players in system is much more important and saves ratting ships.
---
Cloak and nullification go hand in hand on T3Cs and since thread OP opened a discussion about the balance of said T3Cs is natural to take nullification into consideration.
---
PIRAT own all the High Sec POCO's. Dont believe me? Shoot some and form up for final timer. They will be there if you start shooting it.
---
can we fund this idea please
---
Well now it is.
---
&gt; Which literally is away from keyboard, like they just log on cloak and leave the house and nothing will happen to them.
---
If they're not even at home why are you afraid of them?
---
Adding better and more varied PVE to the game is essential to Eve surviving. Yes Eve is a PVP game, but the PVE part sustains it.
---
You get more people in space by having enjoyable and instant activity. More people in space leads to more hostile interactions.
---
PVE in Eve is ridiculously boring. Why would you make it worse by making it harder? 
---
The blackout would have worked fantastically if CCP had also added new PVE content with it that kept people logging in to experience new and more dangerous activites.
---
Instead they just made the most boring and necessary aspect of the game worse. Of course people left in droves.
---
Wow a thread where everybody gets downvotes, sign me up
---
towers didnt have a dps cap. And a unfueld tower were useless. a unfuelled citadel still offer docking and thethering.  Which is reason enough to not want them in your space
---
CCP said Monday blackout is done: "We remove chat from the game" :D
---
You had 2 PLEX sales and a massive SP event chain during this time. Both of these will push the price of PLEX down which is another reason why I dislike the usage of it as a sole indicator. These things are outside of our control and its hard to tell what affected the price the most. Cause even tho many left it wasnt really that many that would usually PLEX.
---
But I have no clue.
---
I need anchoring lvl 5 to deploy T2 bubbles but only anchoring 1 to deploy a citadel.   
---
Now that's fucked up.
---
&gt; Well common sense,and basic economic knowledge. 
---
Of course.  I forgot common sense gives you carte blanche to lie in a post.
---
there are many arguments for the formation of the EU, the main one at the time however was that to avoid another world war (that had originated from intra european conflicts) there needed to be more economic and political links.
---
Oh, this was what Falcon meant when he said "It's going to be fun..." with the face of a schoolboy who hadn't done his homework and his name just got called by the teacher to come to the blackboard to show his solution to the class.
---
T2 bubbles are scary, man.
---
Ejecting doesn't work anymore
---
just the one near trade hubs and on the main routes.  they dont own them but they are paid to protect them.  its probably 65/75percrent.  they protrct alot of structures.  if you got the isk theyll do anything you ask them too.  thats how merc work
---
Now that the servers are back up, everyone is just mass disconnecting.  
---
But yay guys, local is back.
---
You should have done your homework, because according to your post you have been on this sub for 6 years and nothing of this is new or unmentioned.
---
Based on that, you could just have attacked the citadel on your own. If it gets defended, awesome, call for the new guys to fleet up the next day at the same time and hope for a fight, if nobody shows up, call the new guys to fleet up in 11 days.
---
However, I agree that the POS method for removing unfueled structures was better and they should have kept it that way.
---
I think it was exactly the people who would plex. Because the bots and crabs are the ones who plex the most, and so demand goes down as they cant krab.

From your response, I don't think I'm going to convince you that you are wrong about all of these points even if I gave you a mile long post.
---
All I can say is that I have spent the last 3 years of my game time in FW. After trying every area of space (WHs 2 years, NS 2 years, other lowsec 2 years, and highsec ofc) FW space is the place that keeps me subscribed.
---
I highly encourage you to try it out again and to try to keep an open mind. 
---

---
I did not lie, please prove that I am lieing scrub.
---
The big problem CCP faces now is no longer how to make changes in the right direction. It's whether or not the change they're going to make is going to upset the status quo enough that they'll have to worry about the player base they have left "going on strike" over it.  
---
Rolling back blackout is fine. Rolling it back with no so much as a word before a fucking Eve meet is absolutely the worst thing they can do. They've literally cucked themselves.
---
Don't touch my exploration+ghost site T3 lmao. I have never lost one(except during the blackout). Been using it for like 4 years lul. BALANCE
---
Yeah, saying 'everyone else is dumb' doesn't do too much to help your case, either.
---
I think AHHHHHHH
---
Completely agree with this. As part of a big coalition and fc for the defense corp, I hate myself for having to do station bashes/defense. Shit is so fucking boring its unbelieveable.   
---
Who wants to do a shield timer for a a station that dies potentially in 2 weeks, with the chances of a) 2 weeks of every single thing being moved out of the station and  b) 3 timers of brainlessly shooting a station, just to realize at the last timer that you had no chance against their forces initially. Complete utter fucking nonsense.  
---
... And to follow up on that, why can a station in LOW POWER that has 0 Fuel use its weapons? Kind of nonsensical if you ask me. Why even offline any of the services if it can still defend itself, even without fuel?
---
&gt; It can be in the background with the sound on looking at the gate
---
No, because allies use said gate too, you need actual eyes watching because there is a brief period where ships are decloaked and re-cloak, literally a second. 
---
&gt;Out of the hundreds of ships in-game, only a handful can warp cloaky
---
Which ship is mostly used by hunters recently?
---
They got rid of local chat from nullsec and the nullbears haven't stopped crying ever since.
---
Wormholers unsubbing all 40 accounts (wormholer btw)
---
This is a good post.
---
What about reverting cyno changes, or make it so that the ship lighting the cyno is movable and can dock up after lighting? Feels to stupid to put a 400 mill ship at risk just for lighting a cyno.
---
I really wish CCP would fix how bad PvE is. It's honestly more exciting to go grind levels in OSRS than it is to rat in Eve Online. There are so many directions they could go and so many ways they could make improvements. The current system is literally you shooting a static red shape in space for hours until you run out of red shapes to shoot or get tired of shooting red shapes for cash. It's fucking tragic how terrible it is.
---
Very few bots PLEX. Its marginal quite frankly, most are alphas. 
---
I dont know honestly. Many in my corp kept at it. From what I saw many in general did. I dont know the exact numbers. Saw many Rorq miners sell their equipment but its far from everyone that does PvE that PLEX.
---
This is anecdotal tho. I dont know. Just based on what I saw in our space.
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/p4i0qx/new-chat-backend-coming-with-the-march-release](https://www.eveonline.com/article/p4i0qx/new-chat-backend-coming-with-the-march-release) 
---
&gt;With the March release, we will replace the text chat backend for EVE Online to use ejabberd, a ‘Rock Solid, Massively Scalable, Infinitely Extensible XMPP Server’. 
---
This aged well....
---
You realize our doctrine Kiki costs 600m right? Half the price of a carrier, and you think it should be more expensive? Talk about risk vs reward. It’s a destroyer for crying out loud.
---
WILL IT THO??
---
Guess bringing back local chat didn't work so well after all suppose we'll have to un-undo blackout again, that should fix it.
---
REEEEEE THEY TOOK AWAY MY CONTENT BY BRINGING BACK LOCAL. ITS TOTALLY NOT BECAUSE THEY NERFED VNIS AND THATS ALL I HUNTED
---
My money is on pa intervention
---
Thats not what I said. I specifically said you are dumb:)
---
“Get friends” if your subcap ratting your ded before any “friends” come to save you
---
&gt; you continue to act a baby.
---
You were the one who didn't read it because it offended you.
---
&gt;jeez do you forget already? we're talking about the relationship between ways to make ISK.
---
Yeah so can you stay on topic at least? 
---
&gt;"remove local and buff nullsec anom payout"
---
&gt;i've said this 10 times at this point and you keep debating by saying nothing.
---
This is actually the first time you've said that. I would not have a problem with this. I'm guessing you think that i disliked the blackout. I don't i loved it and will miss it. My problem with the blackout comes from the fact that it didn't just tip the scales in the other direction it slammed its fist down on the scales and launched the miners and ratters into orbit.
---
I swear Falcon has the ability to manifest into your worst nightmare. 
---
Holy fuck.
---
Yeah, i mean, we know a lot of bots used super/carriers/omega ships in general.
---
This isn’t really true. Trig ships get absolutely savaged by a ferox fleet or such. For this reason, my WH-NS hunting corp is actually going back to classic doctrines such as herocats.
---
WTS 10/10 23h left 100mil
---
Someone in my corp said this, i didn't believe them. I believe now.
---
learn wormholes and learn em early!!
---
nothing from you is non-judgemental, don't even try
---
Who exactly ratted in a domi before blackout? Substitute domi for carrier, and a carrier can survive long enough for help to arrive against a whole bunch of t3c's...
---
Now without a cyno, we dont bother ratting in a carrier, since we couldn't get help now.
---
That is the crux of OP's argument... Groups of t3c have no counter post cyno changes.
---
will you gift wrap that salt for me to ship?
---
At this point it will be drama for a quite a while.         
---
Tbh.       
---
Statement from CCP that '25% of paying customers decide to leave without significant resubs' can reduce the level of drama as this is quite good reason why to do it.           
---
But again yes.           
---
There are plenty people at CCP knowing what to say and when to say and i am just stating my private opinion.
---
Well was fun while it lasted. Back to farming in 100% safety. Can't wait to see the next hot take on why the pcu continues to decline.
---
Give CCP a break for not announcing it in a dev blog on a weekend. They deserve A LOT of shittalking and trolling for fucking things up but certainly not for not writing a dev blog on a weekend when most of their workers are off.
---
For announcing Blackout a longer warning time was good so people could adapt. But a warning time to turn local back on? It’s just back to business as usual.
---
There's abyss PvP, you fight to claim PvP room loot.

Hello. I fully understand the mechanics. It was intresting to hear the reactions of new players to the game and their thoughts on it. Thats why i put it down here. This is not me complaining but more just explaining what happened and what was said by them. 
---
They also agreed the POS of same day death was much better.
---
Also why shoot alone when you can create content. Its a social game is it not

the irony when 90% of the guys on the CSM right now are the same people who influence the biggest battles EVE Online experiences and leads fleets multiple times a week.

---
The fastest way to money for an absolute newbie is most likely exploration (or scamming/begging)     
---
The best way is doing what is fun to you and not looking at the ISK balance too much.
---
blackout was always framed as a test, so its not surprising it ended. I think that its generally represents a positive step in the outlook of the dev, but needs more refinement in implementation - on the other side, it also needs tweaks to the other side of intel acquisition -&gt; d-scan would need to be made much more interesting to use for example. 
---
i personally hope that there will be many more experiments in the future.
---
2014 was when jump-fatigue was introduced you sad brain
---
What difference does it make. Someone bought that PLEX with real money.
---
Your corp has to be 9 days old to anchor a pos but can anchor a citadel minutes after creation.
---
To me Chaos is what describes the state of CCP, not the game.
---
There were most certainly. But in comparison its a handful. I would say most of those were players who botted, i.e., not the industrial botters. CCP tends to make a show out of the omega botters so we kinda know they werent in abundance. Ofc many are not seen but still.
---
Funnily enough, that's not even the worse part. The worse part in high-sec is when they are powered and defended.
---
A well fitted combat astrahus (no rigs) is massive pain in the ass to deal with. In order to deal with it alone, you pretty much need a full fleet of 20 people with T2 logi, links and tanky battleships. 
---
Thats if theres a single guy sitting in it. Then you can sit on grid and "tank" the immense amount of ECM, neuting and damage an astra can put out. 
---
Now if they even remotely have a fleet, falcons, any sort of extra disruption, you enter ridiculous levels of people required to siege a single astra.
---
And yes you need to do this 3 times even if you usually get the first one for "free". 
---
My 15 real people corp played around in high-sec for a month or so when they released new wardecs. The fact that we needed 2/3s of the corp running 2 to 3 accounts for each timer made it difficult to keep up. Now perhaps we aren't big enough for high-sec wardecs, we unfortunately thought this was designed for people out size.
---
They owned by corp with 1 person in it. That shouts alt corp... they own the POCOs
---
You have protection from CCP since they don't make the mission you are running a beacon and give you an acceleration gate so any cloakies have to decloak and be visible on D scan, and can't light a cyno after the initial point.
---
Exactly my point... so you can’t really say that Kiki is too good for it’s price today, if carriers are really that cheap.
---
#EVERYONE IS MAD. AND WILL ALWAYS BE MAD. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. EVEN IF CCP PAYS YOU TO PLAY EVE, PEOPLE WILL BE MAD. HTFU.
---
By pissing off the ones who you still had obviously.
---
Stroke or Insanity?
---
Yeah, theres also the gila bot epidemic, which i think might be omegas as well.
---
I didn't really see any complaints from actual Goons saying to bring back local, all I saw was people complaining about Goons wanting local back and people posting about player numbers cliff diving... feel free to source anywhere that an actual Goon requests for local to be returned though.
---
No fuel = instant kill.
---
  Good luck keeping 200 astra's fueled 24/7 forever.

And NCPL's excuse for not undocking against either Goons or GOTG was what? Latest League of Legends update was out? Path Of Exiles new season?

Did they finally get a new Minecraft mod?
---
they are beacons that show up on the overview....

lel now they're claiming it's a DDoS. You've got to be fucking kidding me.
---
Theyre not. Or ye they could be but I doubt it. The advantage is rather minimal I would think so no point.
---
Lol, they DDOSed Eve. Think some people are mad.
---
Players playing the game are usually very bad at knowing what changes would be good for the game. They are too focused on their narrow point of view and too interested in the way the game can change. They lack perspective of the overall gameand understanding of the areas they don't master.
---
I don't mean their opinion doesn't matter. Their opinions matter a lot when they talk about what they live and what they wish.
---
Their advices on what should be done is usually worthless though.
---
WHERE THE FUCK IS DELAYED LOCAL, THOUGH?
---
Delve Intel: 
---
rEtarDeDmIneR_01 - _10 back in Colossal ... dude that APM ... must be CSGO pro, 50 excavs pulled in 1 sek.
---
Apparently you think game time is what’s important. This is where you’re wrong and your little brain can’t comprehend the reality if the situation.
---
The longevity of the game is what matters. If the game make 500mil and dies next year is bad vs 100mil a year for the next 15 tears
---
what timezone would have been a good information
---
Then don't anchor 200 astras??? O\_O
---
Eve is down rn?
---
Add a 50% damage penalty to cloaks or something
---
I did think about it. I remember the days of NC and PL telling everyone to adapt or die and HTFU. At yet y’all didn’t follow your own advice and Goons was pushing your shit in and you decided to run.
---
THE NEIGHBORS UNDERWAER THAT THE SNIFF WHEN NO ONES LOOKING.
---
Isn't that confirmation in your screenshot?
---
Or are you asking for someone to own up to it?
---
Domis and Myrms became the meta after VNIs nerfs, not just with blackout.
---
Still, I don’t see how solo, small gangs or fleets of T3cs are without counter post cyno changes. They can easily be fought in subcaps, no cynos needed except for the comfort of bridging to it.
---
&gt; no damage caps on towers helped if you had lots of people who were bored and willing to clear moons. 
---
lots of people? medium citadel stop you at 6k dps, 1 dread will hit the damage cap. That doesnt just stop the big guy but also the small guys
---
KRABS KILLED EVE; FUCK FARMVILLE

SUCH EASY SOLUTIONS, BUT SISSY DEVS: WHAT ABOUT OBSERVATORIES ???

Hey! It's your Reddit Cake Day! 🎂🎈🎈

You've been on Reddit for 1 year!

Here's something about you: The subreddit you post most in is r&amp;#47;Eve.

***
---
^^^u/everbeam&amp;#32;can&amp;#32;[send&amp;#32;this&amp;#32;message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AnotherCakeDayBot&amp;subject=Remove%20reply%20id:%20f0i3l9l&amp;message=For%20reference,%20this%20is%20the%20permalink%20to%20the%20parent%20comment:%20/r/Eve/comments/d4xop3/now_that_ratting_ships_cant_fit_cynos/f0i3l9l/)&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;delete&amp;#32;this&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;View&amp;#32;my&amp;#32;profile&amp;#32;for&amp;#32;more&amp;#32;info&amp;#32;or&amp;#32;PM&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;provide&amp;#32;feedback
---
It's the same kind of people who uses "Repair Windows" option instead of a fresh install. :P
---
Am I the only one saw it? Cause my mate is already in da game. I was wondering how?
---
This is very true.
---
CCP built a 0.0 endgame that requires multiple alts supporting each other or replicating the same tasks to be effective. The only way to increase your rewards or be successful is to pursue one of these two routes. 
---
Supercapital gameplay: whether PvP or PvE requires paying fairly close attention to one client and clicking a lot or pushing a lot of hot keys on one client. It doesn’t scale very well,, but it does require some alts to support it. For safety sake it requires at least one FAX alt on standby. Now, safe crabbing probably also requires one or two Force Recon alts to be safe (one for exit cyno, one for rescue cyno). Probably a good idea to have a scout alt as well.
---
Rorqual gameplay: not much use in PvP, except as battle Rorqual, but also essential to building up the huge stockpiles of Supercapitals and FAX required for success in the endgame. Unlike Supercapital PvE, this scales very well. Almost no input required once you are on a sufficiently large rock. Unless mining moon ore, it used to take about three Rorquals to equal one Supercapital ratter. Then you have your standard FAX alt and a scout. 
---
Now, there are other ways to make great income while undocked in 0.0, but almost all of them also benefit immensely from throwing more alts at the problem. Looking for exploration sites? You can cover twice as much ground with two explorers (just leave one cloaked while you hack a site with the other). Running a DED site? Goes way faster with 2100 DPS than it does with 700 DPS. 
---
And, even if you do trade or industry, you are almost certainly going to need more alts for your cyno chain, jump freighter pilot, more sell orders, more research slots, more build slots, etc. So, once again we see that CCP has built an endgame game which requires supporting alts or replicating alts.
---
Ask Simple Farmers how many they have
---
we both know local isnt player made, unless they make it a structure of some sort and  thats if you catch them on your scan spam, if youre in range. i had a friend of mine who barely out of a bomber gank. so what did the gankers do they waited over an hour for him to come out and try to play his game, they tried him again as soon as he landed on a site. hows that fair? hows he able to respond to that? ganged up on, no real way to tell if hes good to enjoy his game play while the other side is content in having every advantage in information positioning what hes flying. sounds fair
---
Rorquals were barely affected by blackout. They are sieged anyway whether a neut comes into local or not. The fact that you quit because of second-hand cowardice is funny, though.
---
#THERE'S NEGATIVITY THEN THERE'S BEING A WHINY LITTLE BITCH.
---
TQ is getting DDOS'd
---
Who said it’s broken? 😂
---
I'm starting to agree with that. They put chat back onto TQ in April, and as soon as Blackout began, you'd see the same bugs from 2018 popping up again, up until last night. I bet they put it back onto their crappy 'new' service during Blackout. I don't like Pearl Abyss, but at this point, I really hope they are looking at at least two vacancies.
---
Came back up. They restarted it once cause the entire chat system went down. Then they got DDOSed so everyone got kicked from the server. But it seems to be working properly now.
---
yay
---
I feel like this is bait coming from /u/Rorqual_Miner
---
But do you honestly think wormholers *brigade reddit posts*? Holy fuck. There's dozens of us, DOZENS!
---
Like I’ve said before, blackout was just code for “we can’t make local chat work reliably, so it’s now a feature not a bug”.
---
What happen to my item when someone revoke my docking access to their freeport?  
---
There is NPC station in the system, but I didn't have access to hauler to haul it, and because it's mostly at freeport there for convenience reason..
---
WHAT CAN'T CCP FUCKING BALANCE THE GAME WITHOUT USING AN AXE
---
WHY STRUCTURES WEREN'T AFFECTED BY FUCKING CHAOS ERA WHEN EVERYONE IS ASKING FOR ONE TIMER FOR MOST STRUCTURES
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO HAVE A CHAT SYSTEM
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO SPREAD NS
---
Point is you cant force them into a fight they don't want to take... The miner or ratter doesn't have the same luxury.
---
As for the VNI, it was only for afk or poors... We can't carrier rat now because there's no umbrella for them anymore... You wont have anywhere near as many ratting carriers die as before...
---
Guess the 'leet pvp hunters gonna lament the decline of the whale population in a few month's time... Guess it will also be the krab' s fault then... How dare we deny them the content they deserve?
---
Mittens alt btw
---
Ask BOT.
---
Yeah.  Just came back from a long break and forgot about being attackable at -5
---
so what youre saying is you krab in a space where you can roll all the wormholes to lock up the system for yourself for a few hours leaving you do literally do whatever you want with 0 chance of getting ganked. must be nice :D. sounds like safe space to me :P.
---
Seems like its You who doesn't get what I am saying. I've never said it was fair for my cloaked ship to kill pve vexor that costs 15 times less. Is freighter being ganked in highsec by 30 dudes fair? No. Why should highsec allow people to use guns against other players with that logic.
---
I've never said blackout was a perfect solution, what I say is people who didn't even try to ''adapt'' and chose ''death'' are whining and people who chose to change their ways, like switching to force recons for ratting, continued living perfectly
---
You gotta have some minutes/hours leeway of decay, but I would like that.
---
What? Mission pockets? No they don't.
---
https://i.imgur.com/XtGeIoC.png
---
Medium citadels are easy to hit damage caps on, but killing large towers in reasonable time? that takes a lot of guys or a decent amount of capitals.
---
Okay, so what's the link between this answer and NC not defending their structures during the Tribute war ?
---
Also everyone agree with the last point, Elite mentality and hate of krabs made them lose a lot of power, not gonna deny that.
---
Try asking the official forums, /r/eve is very upset
---
Launcher could be the target and only impact those trying to log in, folks whos client has already launched may be beyond the reach of the attack.

I'm sorry your grammar is too obnoxious and I have no idea what you're trying to say..... Fam.

---
Yes, Blackout was too extreme and poorly implemented, and now CCP has to go back to the old shite to try and coax players back. I was hoping they had planned a "middle-ground" mechanic to take over when Blackout ended (such as structures, delayed local etc - lots of good ideas on here recently), but it's very frustrating that we're just going back to the same.
---
I'm perhaps one of the few that went from 3 subbed accounts to 9 during Blackout, but obviously that's because Blackout suited me as a mostly solo/small gang roamer. 
---
I did see a few bots I recognised, mostly running 10-15 vexors or myrms, and even found a guy back to botting in his super - he had all gates covered with noob ship eyes, the only way I got close to him was by logging in system for a week...not that my Loki could do much to his Nyx ) I agree that a lot went to highsec (market is out of control), I just wish I'd checked the price of illegal ISK before Blackout was annouced to see if it rose in price a lot.
---
Blackout's gone, as a cyno' (sorry capital lads), maybe they'll throw something crazy at us in a couple of weeks...a crazy shake-up to how anoms are run or asteroid fields are mined, d-scan stops working or gates go randomly offline or something...whatever it is I'd like the Chaos to continue in some way.
---
If you can afford a cap you can afford a Force Recon.
---
&gt;/r/eve &gt; Why won't new players try eve and stay?!

  &gt;Also /r/eve &gt; GAME IS FUCKED DON'T COME BACK
---
Players are the kitten.

CCP's in the cage.
---
PA's the cage.
---
Bullshit you do. A cap fleet standing by 8 jumps over is not localized defense.
---
@V0kan check discord dms
---
I like carrier ratting so that I can jump to any and all cynos and PvP. In fact I made more ISK with an MTU and rorqual saves than just by ratting. Can't do that in highsec.
---
well with cyno changes if you want to mine or rat, you have to blop the same system for safety in numbers and what not. there will always be a fight to defend crab areas bud.
---
God forbid people work together to defend their source of income and make hunters' life hard.
---
I choose Eve
---
To be fair considering the amount of crying and bickering this change caused, I wouldn't be so sure to dismiss that claim
---
Well there was once a glorious patch series called tiericide, remembered by many as the best patches ever, shaking up metas and providing lots of new fun content (tier3 Destroyer and BCs etc.).
---
As final part of this series, a Battleship tiericide was announced.
---
Then Seagull started to listen to much to 1 ingame group overproportianally represented in the CSM, that pushed for more "farms&amp;fields" and CCP is ain a panic slope since then. So the last missing tiericide patch never came.
---
The best way to do that is this, you make a small single player game.
---
The build it up to a interconnected game with eve or just roll it into eve and leave the small game as just a side game to play with out off eve.
---
There problem is trying to make large games out off the ideas before they even know it's gonna work.
---
Illed love to see a factorio style eve Pi game, you could end up rolling into eve to make such a boring an tedious side mechanics  into a small fun mini game in a game. 
---
Picture going to a small station to buy your pi from some one playing, eve colony's.
---
Could even have the ability to set up stations in non Nov areas to allow these,  eve colony players to set up and produce on your worlds and sell you there stuff.
---
I quit before when they couldn't make chat work correctly. Looks like I might be heading out again.

LOWSEC IS DEAD BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS ACTUAL PVP. THEY JUST WANT TO CLUB SEALS IN NULL.
---
I'm not really sure how blackout enhances Goku fleets.
---
I'm sorry but if you cant handle having that many structures from a management point then you simply:
---
a) Should not have that many structures to manage.   
---
b) Hire more people to manage it if its becoming a issue   
---
c) Simply live in a smaller space on the map where you can manage the structures in system.
---
Either taken before G-Fleet, or after laughing gas inhalation ....
---
EVE-playerbase is getting to the age where tiny letters are difficult to read ;)
---
As someone whose main time in Eve was in the 2010 era, it's kinda comforting seeing stuff like this and knowing CCP still hasn't changed.
---
reeeee blackout.
---
its not even been this bad.
---
its mine!!!
---
Yeah I even had goons dogpiling on me in other threads that nobody ever lived in a POS when you could store stuff in a station, thus all arguments against asset safety are wrong. Guess they are such pubbies that never encountered true Nullsec-Life before Citadels.
---
They never did get it working correctly.
---
whats important is that it feels right, from the gut.
---
.........That's the point
---
Wellz thats a dumpsterfire and a have, do they not have DDos protection?
---
HOPEFULLY SOMETIME IN THE NEXT 15 YEARS WE EITHER SEE FOCUSED CHANGES DESIGNED TO MAKE SMALL MEANINGFUL TWEAKS TO GAMEPLAY AND BALANCE INSTEAD IF WIDE SWEEPING STROKES OF A RETARD BRUSH...

Hey thanks for the reply! I appreciate any info I can get!

Yes, goons are the ones looking stupid in this thread...

I like that idea actually, kinda like the citadel is running on fumes/reserves for a week but after that, no tether no timer fuck you.

OH NO WRONG POST; SUPPOSED TO SHITTALK HERE:  
---
LOCAL IS BACK NOW REEÈ: 
---
THERE ARE GOING TO BE NO TARGETS ANYMORE: ITS TOTALLY CCPS FAULT THAT NULLSEC FOSTERED A CULTURE OF SAFETY FIRST AND NOT TAKING INTERSTING; FUN FIGHTS ANYMORE: EVERYTHING ELSE THESE ELITE KITING PVPERS IN NANO BULLSHIT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHO WANT TO KILL A RORQUAL IN THEIR SOLO DOUBLE NANO RETRIBUTION: THEY JUST NEED TO HTFU:
---
Without local I couldn't tell.
---
&gt; And CCP designed it that way.
---
Null blue growth was going on before all the blamed changes as well. Null bluing also continued in any new areas introduced where capital proliferation, home territory, injectors etc. can't be blamed; perimeter's agreements between all the big blocs to not fight because that way they can share the profits and not risk anything.
---
CCP isn't solely to blame, a lot of player at this point avoid PvP unless it's at zero risk to them.
---
Yeah I know profits can be made else where. I mostly enjoy mining because I can do it while doing other stuff School, Son, Wife, treadmill stuff like that. Plus every economy needs a work horse right?!
---
stop crying
---
Slide on the slope.....slide on the slope.........slide on the slope
---
Nobody believes that. But unless you work in an alliance's auth team you don't know the true numbers. So you gotta just say the easy number. I make up 4-6% of a 500+ "man" corp by myself.
---
Hopefully it'll stay there for a while too, unlike the tax changes that were announced, put in and all mention of them hidden from the launcher within 24 hours. :P
---
Wrong. Instead of reporting into an intel channel they just report to a Discord channel.
---
It's 2019 and the game I play is so unoptimized and pieced together that the chat client can't correctly integrate with the server.
---
CCP. Want to make eve great again? Start developing eve 2.0 and make a plan to port existing customers over in some capacity.
---
Stick a fucking fork in it, Jesus Christ. We are all dying for new life on EVE. Let's get it started before we die of old age.

---
&gt;  jump fatigue made umbrellas super potent
---
Much right, but on this you mix up causalities. Jump fatigue and jump range nerf were crucially needed to break up the 1st stagnation of EVE, PanFam instaprojecting all across EVE with at that time untouchable force, being able to hold all valuable moons with low effort.
---
It is Citadels &amp; Lifeblood mining that created the umbrellas, without them we now would only have a cluster wide umbrella.
---
Suuuuuurrrrreeeeee...
---
&gt; Like the announcement was 2-3 days ago.
---
Which would put it at a friday afternoon/evening. Expecting people to work over the weekend just because you want them to is unreasonable.
---
&gt;Blackout coming in was dev blog like 3 weeks before and then another 1 week before it going to start.
---
tax changes got announced one week before with no clear date, put into the game and all mentions scrubbed from the launcher within 24 hours. By comparison, this is very well communicated with a dedicated devblog on the specific time of change stuck on the launcher.
---
Yea also I forgot to add don't forget to look at the map and cost indexs of each system. Ideally you want to do manufacturing in a system with a low cost index.  The higher it is the more it costs in taxs to start industry jobs.
---
If you want to buy loot from jita to turn into items I would recommend rigs. My alt makes 75-100mil a day off them with only 4 industry slots. Not amazing but for 4 slots and not that many skills(training more slots/dst/freighter atm)  so it will end up making plenty more as I get more slots and ability to move minerals.
---
The salvage from rigs is low m3 which makes it easier for you as a newer player who doesn't have access to freighters/dsts without paying for shipping.
---
did you take this screenshot at like 11:15 or something
---
So was prince. Prince is dead.
---
Yes listen to the good and established players.  All I see is Loki and Bombers buffs to please wormholers. Stop reading /r Eve for ideas - mostly WH  briigades here coveted by biased moderators.  Talk to the CSM and test things on sidi before crashing the whole game with your cyno temoval and blackouts.
---
No power and it becomes an anom and is infested with rogue drones. Now whatever is in it drops if the structure is destroyed.
---
&gt; Then Seagull started to listen to much to 1 ingame group overproportionally represented in the CSM due to vote brigading and purchase, that pushed for more "farms&amp;fields" and CCP is in a panic slope since then. So the last missing tiericide patch never came.
---
It didn't help that they nerfed BS/BC warps. Already ungainly and slow ships became even more so. I don't even know what problem they were trying to fix. It's not like BS didn't already die in droves to bombers.
---
It’s just the return of the bots
---
Basically enhances every tackling and scouting aspect.
---
Off topic, but is your username a deep joke about salt/creating salt? If so, bravo
---
They have always been uber vulnerable to it. But it was much worse before, were long periods of attacks last year so they improved it. Its much better now. They managed to sort it pretty fast this time.
---
I keep saying this and I'll say it again. CCP is really bad at this and it amazes me that Even has lasted as long as it has. We're all quite fortunate that we get to see anything happen with this game.
---
&gt; niche elitist HTFU attitude
---
tfw this is now considered a niche attitude, not really surprising though.
---
the shit show... continues
---
One can't be reversed, one can be reversed but all effects are permanent (other than locking out any new players from also injecting rorqual alts to compete with veterans) and one has been true for at least a decade.
---
It's easy to complain and attack something, it's far less easy to analyze the real problems and create a solution.
---
Looks like a baby lynx to me or something like it
---
I was trying to point out nicely that you are a part of the obnoxiously vocal minority.
---
Yet another reason I'm strongly considering unsubbing 8 accounts. I thought things couldn't get worse after seagull left... Yet here we are.
---
Citadels. Low power = no damage cap, no timers. straight dead. All loot drops into space even in empire. Problem fixed.
---
Yeah i remember last years attacks, but i thought they fixed it completely.
---
Spectacular! &lt;3
---
Multiboxing itself isn't really an issue, it has been around forever. The normal downside is vulnerability, since getting attacked with 20 things in space means you're going to lose a lot when you get attacked, you can't manage your ships the way 20 actual players could.
---
The actual problem is how *safe* those 20 are in today's (now non-blackout) null regardless of how closely the player is managing them. If it takes less than 1/20th a person's attention and time to do something and still get great profit with near zero risk, there's a problem.

wierd i cannot find any titans killed by bombers on zkill in the last week

KITEY BULLSHIT IS COWARDS RUNNING AWAY
---
NEVER STOP PLAYING
---
&gt; skill injectors made every doctrine accessible to every alliance so all that matters is numbers...
---
Saying that skill injectors are to blame for that is rather disingenuous. It's not like big alliances didn't blob anything they could before skill injectors.
---
Modules (weapons) run on capacitor, services and amenities run on fuel. That's a fair enough distinction to keep.
---
They could mirror the EHP bonus from onlined structures to module/weapon efficiency, though.
---
Wtf is an end game eve player. lmao
---
YES
---
48h REINFORCEMENT
---
3 TIMERS
---
CAN BE PLACE 100m AWAY FROM CITADEL
---
WHEN ACTIVE ONLY THE OWNING ALLIANCE CAN SEE LOCAL AND CAN USE DSCAN AND PROBES
---
THAT'S WHAT THE PLAYER BASE WANTED RIGHT ?
---
He's not wrong. You act superior to everyone when a change benefits you, but when one adversely effects you, you lose your shit and have a melt down worse than Fukushima
---
It's all the krabs trying to log in at once
---
I considered this as well when that weird messed up "random local" thing happened. I assumed they took the chat system down to its bare minimums in order to rework the system.
---
&gt;trump fan. 
---
I'm not even American. I couldn't care less about your politics.
---
FARM THE KRABS
---
&gt;They just keep not fucking listening at all.
---
They have been, look at blackout. The problem is, who do they listen to? There's dozens of random ideas being throw on this exact sub, a lot of them get player support, they typically have glaring issues that are also ignored/downvoted. Do you expect every week to have changes based on whatever was most upvoted on reddit?
---
If you want to complain about CCP not listening to "the community", one should first take a close look at "the community" and realize it is a fragmented, undecided mess.
---
Your posts have a negative effect on the average IQ of this place, please cease !
---
Tired of the same old same old. Wish there wwas a way to turn it off.
---
EVE PAST BLACKOUT IS DEAD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
---
Ohshit sorry thought this was the weekly all caps shitpost.
---
So going to give unfortunate news. Those of us that quit dont want to come back. After talking with my corp who plays a ton of games together we are happy with our fulltime swap to warframe and dont want to come back. It turns out other games offer fun all the time with a garuntee of a fight. Imagine playing mortal kombat for 3 hours with a hope of a fight but not getting one. Would suck right? Yea... 
---
In terms of letting us know the game is less fucked than it was via an email may bring a few back but the loss of trust is on both sides. Industry, pve guys are pissed that chaos Mark's a change in direction back to an eve where we were shit on for doing our gameplay. And the opposite the pvp guys are pissed that ccp didnt follow through and keep going with it. 
---
Now how this plays out is a marked loss of pve and industry guys who say fuck it I'm out followed by a bunch of pvp guys who say fuck it I'm out. Only resulting in more losses. 
---
Damned if you do damned if you dont. 
---
But not really 
---
You see most people think that local in it's perfect state is too good. But a 15 to 30 second delay would be balanced and the happy medium between no local and perfect local. 
---
That said from the sounds of it the chat system is just as fucked as it was 2 years ago and the bandaid ripped off exposing those problems with the services. 
---
Not sure what direction eve is going but at this point they need leadership that I dont think Hilmar can provide. Chaos is not a plan and doesnt instill confidence in the future of the game. 
---
I'd also like to note that at this point the PCU has damn near halved from a year ago and is closing in on a death spiral of having too few players to make some systems work. 
---
Unironically Eve is dying and at this point the blame is on Hilmar for, to continue the analogy, its attempted murder.
---
Didn't they offload chat to it's own server?? Maybe they should just remove the chat box from the game and let someone like zkill handle the big boy pants stuff like talking to other people in a game.
---
DOOS
---
CCP solution: your corporation must be nine days old to anchor a T2 Large Bubble.
---
A little salty about that ay?  “SF are not a threat”. Lol
---
They're never going to admit whatever impact there is. There's no reason to. It just invites more bashing.
---
You raise a good point. I agree that they will be able to speak with some authority to the areas of the game they master, they will not be good at appreciating other parts of the game, and EVE is that vast an experience that you can’t really know it all, that they are not interested in but also needs attention from the devs.
---
I have some ideas how EVE could evolve as a system such that it would acquire the quality of ‘society’, which is what it really needs because of the scope of the game. For most other games that doesn’t matter and it would be useless to see it on that scale. But EVE is a purported cluster of systems with trillions of humans, that would have its own reality, also how it pertains to the experience offered to the capsuleer. I don’t think CCP has [been able to] explore[d] what that would mean for a viable third place where people lived and thrived.
---
yes, which is why everyone hunts pve players. I'm sure bombers bar is about to start taking sov too. /s
---
Really fuckin annoying.
---
I would probably classify every single person in this thread as a scammer.
---
CCP solution: it now takes Advanced Anchoring V to anchor a T2 Large Bubble.
---
Thank You for not down voting
---
Even if they did, nothing would change except those that got powerful because of them remain powerful and now nobody else can compete.
---
jesus eve really is a boomer’s game
---
impact font memes in 2019?
---
PLEX was never the issue that injectors are for the simple reason that for *years and years* the one thing you could never buy was the most important resource in the game: SP.
---
To put a fine point on that, would you rather have 50b or 25m SP to distribute as you would?
---
&gt; Was a local issue ? 
---
It's always been an issue in that it made bots easy to run. It got worse as people developed out of game tools to throw alerts at half-aware pilots. I can literally open a browser now and know 90% of reds in the region and a pretty good idea of exactly where they are and where they are heading... without having to read the intel channel in game.
---
I also think they went too far in the carrier nerfs and in not allowing a T-1 ship light a T-1 cyno to jump through a T1 cap. Yes, they needed to be removed from caps but the end result was pretty heavy handed. 
---
Maybe all caps should become T-2 and require the T2 goo to build. While it wouldn't reduce current numbers, the replacement of them would be more expensive and would require more effort.
---
&gt;Removing local altogether was an extreme change, heavily biased towards one style of play: Hunting.
---
Problem with that is that the status before/now is the complete opposite, heavily biased towards safe pve with little or no attention required due to perfect intel of local+intel channels+NEAR.
---
Neither extreme is probably going to be any good long term.
---
PER ZKILL, CAN CONFIRM, SHIPS STILL DYING POST BLACKOUT.  WEIRD......
---
When we find low powered structures in wormholes we die a little inside realizing that even when we bash it we have to seed the hole and come back in 2-10 DAYS to finish it off.
---
If you can't fuel your damn structure you should lose it.
---
Wow.
---
I'd buy it. I can imagine there is seriously mega tears and salt right now with local back. The krabs didn't ddos when they took it away. Pretty sad hahaha
---
at least it's not comic sans
---
&gt;FIX THE INFINITE RESOURCE ISSUE
---
Easily said, not easily done.
---
&gt;FIX CITADEL SPAM
---
For them to be easy fixes, i'm sure you could put forward a plan that will fix both problems, without being glaringly obviously bad for other parts of the game.
---
&gt; I was trying
---
correct. and you tried in a hilariously nonsensical way. 
---
&gt; that you are a part of the obnoxiously vocal minority that exists on reddit
---
opposed to the obnoxiously vocal minority that exists on reddit spinning a different narrative?
---
&gt; Hopefully this whole thing blew up in their face so badly they never listen to your crew again.
---
Imagine actually believing CCP gives a flying fuck about what people post on reddit. I mean i really hope you´re in spin mode right now. because if you aren´t...wew.
---
secret sources report the attack originated at https://ejabberd.im
---
So True
---
That was kind of confusing. Reading the article now, still seems like delayed mode was gonna be a thing.
---
How much do you offer for the character?
---
with the face of an alterboy who hadn't done his butt exercises and his name was just called by the priest
---
WHY WON'T THEY JUST BRAWL IT OUT AT THE SUN
---
this idea that they fight on the undock is not correct, they are not station campers
---
remember to ask him for a security deposit.
---
Lol you will still pay them for years to come. Don't kid yourself.
---
Meow ❤️
---
Well, obviously this mechanic isn't perfect - but what's a better alternative?  
---
Right now, people say it's too much work thus they need to make sieges easier. Using your experience as an example, one could argue 4-5 players should be able to deal with a well fitted astrahus in order to make the entire experience less of a pain in the ass and much more exciting etc.
---
But that also would mean that big corps/alliances would be able to take what they want with a small fraction of their members, further making it difficult for smaller corps to get a foothold in any system, which means at some point people simply will avoid that kind of content because defending a station now becomes a massive pain in the ass. Tables have turned, while you are happy, others are not - I don't see how that solved the problem - it just shifted, making a certain playerbase unhappy in return.
---
Here is the main issue I see with EVE balancing attempts throughout the past decade: certain players complain about something and demand a fix that would make them happy, even though it's messing up things on the other end. Now those people are unhappy and ask for changes that satisfy their expectations, which then impacts the gameplay experience of some other players as well, etc.  
---
CCP has been trying to fix shit one step at a time because the community asks for changes that benefit them specifically, without taking into account how it affects the rest of the game. That's why we have the current state of bullshit balancing attempts that only result in more frustration, creating more problems in the process overall. 
---
So it would be interesting to hear what you think should happen - while taking into account how your ideas would impact other areas of the game, both in a positive and negative way.
---
Yea. I lost motivation to log in when CCP announced how ansiblex gates work in summer last year (it was the last nail in the coffin for me) and i stopped playing completly in April this year, but i still visit r/eve almost every day. Its just routine ... emails, real world news, eve news, ...
---
Yeah chat is broken again when they tried to turn local back on. Blackout was because they couldn't get local to work at all times.
---
P1:  Help!  
---
P1:  guys have me tackled
---
P2: Where?
---
P3:  P1, where are you?
---
P1: on gate dieing
---
P2:  What gate?
---
P1: Dead

Ur not on the csm anymore. Get off the fence.

Except they never really fixed anything and broke more shit in the process... you know... typical CCP things...
---
You're welcome to link that meltdown.

next pulse will be right on halloween, so it might come true
---
Why does he have such a tiny thumb?
---
What?! I didn't know! They said it was only a test phase but I assumed that was just another way of saying it would be permanent. WTF are they thinking?!
---
VERY small group, but they apparently took control of this sub of 120K subscribers. Maybe it was a small group that though it would "solve all of eve's problems" as you put it, but the big overall support for blackout was definitely there.
---
I fly around in lokis sometimes tengus 
---
I fly through gate camps several times a day. Big ones, like in LXQ2-T for instance. I nullify cov ops and travel fit for the trip in. Impossible to catch me. I bring a mobile depot for when I reach my hunting grounds and refit for combat, usually leaving the nullify/covert in unless I need one of my various other fits. 
---
It is literally 0% risk, trust me. I don't even get nervous in gate camps anymore.
---
sorry, it's a common scenario…

Why down vote when you have a simple and good idea, citadel spam is awful and to kill them it's zven worst
---
Rip
---
Sometimes I would be put in the local for a system I had JCed out of; some people would be showing up in chat despite never talking.
---
When one can find local bugs during blackout, you know something is up.
---
&gt;This way if hostiles show up, people might engage them even in frigates just to boost their later payouts, even if they die. Give the loss of a ship a minor positive aspect to it.
---
This won't change anything. All this will do is people undocking in free corvettes to get blown up by their alts or friends so they can boost their ISK gains higher than before. If not corvettes, those same cheap frigates because they can more efficiently boost their status back up without actual enemies present.
---
Costly experiment on humans (neckbeards).
---
This thread aged well.....
---
He doesn't look as awkward in this one so that's nice I guess, I was a bit worried he was about to shit himself in the last picture. This one has more of a "ehhehehe come children I got lots of candy in my upstairs bedroom" -kind of vibe to it.
---
...
---
Actually that may not be an improvement.
---
This is the fix, right here folks! Take my updoot!
---
Thatd have been great... years ago. The spam cant be put back in the box at this stage. Who's gonna bash all those citadels? Even with 1 timer or something it's an outrageous task.
---
Finally they will see and welcome you again.
---
/r/evememes
---
They didn’t adapt to the changes to the game like they told everyone else to. So much talk and then came time to htfu and they ran.
---
I know I just wish all the needless pussies would be banned or killed IRL. Criteria of the category "needless pussies" defined by you and me. Then eve will flourish.
---
best battles I was in were the months leading up the black out. Odd that.   
---
TIT's and Supers out we went. Guess that was fake news.
---
It's not just a narrative it is true. I can't kill anything out there with my cheap alpha fit in one shot. The balancing is off. In reality I would be able to kill anything just by looking at it because I'm elite. CCP needs to fix this shit. I need to be able to have easy kills, otherwise this game is boring. When will this community understand that catering towards my specific needs is what will fix this game?
---
&gt; in that case why would i pick a fight that i definitely lose ?
---
Same goes for them. But the defenders in null typically have a lot of benefits that the attackers don't have so it's an even worse proposition for them than it is for you.
---
He actually enjoys being on fire now. It hurt a bit to begin with, but then he got used to the pain.
---
Eh, join R1FTA and setup a staging in each warzone pre-populated with the main frig fits you like. Then jump clone between as needed. Good lowsec staging for the amarr-mil warzone include places like Uusanen, Raa, Avenod, Bosboger, Saikamon. Quiet low sec system with a rarely/never camped high sec next door to make DST logistics (or even T1 hauler alpha alt) easy enough.
---
&gt; The blackout has given us an incredible amount of insight in terms of player behavior, sentiment and ability to adapt to rapid short notice changes.
---
Yeah, shows how many sissy crybaby Null Sec care bears can't stand not knowing the instant a strange face enters Local.
---
You sound salty. I am too, it's ok.
---
It is on its own server, they guy you replied to is just a idiot.
---
I've never really seen good character as a strong point for CCP but then again this isn't exactly a game about good character.
---
It can't be said for sure I suppose but OP's observations are spot on from the pixel's that are visible of the task bar. Occam's razor, probably Mac

So I've just popped into the game because the whole player-run economy was fascinating to me. I'm mostly interested in the politicking between Alliances (and Corporations too, but if I understand it correctly they're more of a regional thing while Alliances are the big boys?) and I was wondering if there were any good sources, like news sites or such, that explain the political relations between these groups? I study International Relations at the moment, and I'd love to use that in-game by acting as a diplomat or policy advisor to an Alliance, but to do that I'd need to get a feel for the relations as they are first.
---
On a side note, are there any inter-Alliance organisation (like a SPACE!UN) or diplomatic corps I could look into joining?
---
Thanks in advance! :)
---
It depends on how much isk the seller would be looking for,  but a decent market price in isk would be offered. I really would have to talk to that with the owner
---
If you repeat a lie long enough, eventually it becomes true. It actually works throughout human history
---
Oddly enough made a post yesterday that blackout was because CCP couldn't get chat to work all the time. Hmm. Thinking.
---
I wouldn't call flying undetectable ships the real risk takers compared to pve players.
---
Caracal? Its not a lynx?
---
You’re a pod pilot. You’re not ‘a nobody’. Never say that about yourself.

---
im glad they didnt remove your cloak ;D
---
Have you considered CCP is just bad at developing games? Everything they touch aside from mainline EVE has been an expensive failure. Eve itself chugs along with a development speed that would cause riots in any other MMO, but is tolerated in EVE because it's the only thing in the market.
---
People have become risk-averse and lazy, conditioned to achieve whatever they want with minimal effort. As soon as it gets difficult, they start crying. This isn't just an EVE thing, you can observe this in all other types of games, both multiplayer and singleplayer. 
---
Everything has to be dumbed down, everything has to be easy - make something difficult, complex and/or challenging or even slightly time consuming that requires some actual effort and/or brain work and people will create a shitstorm rather than try to use the few brain cells they have left.
---
Move away from gaming/entertainment and take a look at other issues. This is a problem within society mostly, not just EVE: if people fail for whatever reasons, they keep complaining until they get what they want. And it works because most companies just want these idiots to shut the fuck up and continue paying for product.
---
TLDR
---
When you immensely increase risk without touching reward people will stop undocking for farm and you'll get a sustainable macroeconomy. But an unsustainable macroeconomy was the only way to keep many people playing, as it turns out when their null farm is gone many people have nothing else to do in Eve.
---
A bit sad if you ask me.
---
so your prople would move across the whole map and fight exhausting wars to secure their sources of income but they just stop playing with the slightest amount of inconvenience that is no local?
---
stop fooling yourselves. any change that would midlely inconvenience your bears or forces them to deviate from the playstyle which has been hammered into their brains for the past 4 years will make them unsub in droves. There will be no wars, there will be no meaningful content. This is what you wanted and this is what you got. Go sit in your sandcastle and enjoy the view until the sun sets in the not to distant future.
---
Oh yes shield slaves and more collectible ships for the 1% are going to turn this game around....
---
Blackout hasn't affected me one bit. In fact, i haven't even had the time to play a lot during these two months, just logging in to adjust skills and manage some trades on my market alt. So i haven't done any hunting. Plus, my PvP character is lapsed to alpha and doesn't even fly cloakies.  But keep assuming everything is about you and your specific playstyle being attacked by a specific category of players, and fail to see the bigger picture. "The wise man points at the forest, but the idiot is looking at the finger." And it's not like you need glasses, you just don't want to see it and pretend the problem is not there.
---
I know you will not be receptive to this either, because at this point you're just acting like a stubborn kid throwing its toys out the pram, but the main reason people want changes is that your playstyle is slowly killing the game. And the first part of the game it will kill is ironically your own playstyle.
---
Like i said, enjoy the future, where nobody gives a fuck about interacting with nullsec anymore, because nothing interesting will be happening there.
---
Also, keep the personal insults coming. They are a direct confirmation for "i can't prove my points, so i have to shout and insult people instead and hope they back down". Good luck with that. Your opinion of me is irrelevant because you don't know me, and doesn't matter in the slightest.
---
What's relevant to the discussion is your inability to see you're cheering for a direction to take the game that will come to bite you in the ass in a few years, by making your playstyle worthless from oversupply and inflation.
---
Maybe i should come back in 2 years and reply here to rub it in your face, just like you tried doing when the blackout ended, but failed because you assumed too much ("he is supporting blackout, he must be flying cloakies, i'll shout him down and try some insults"). Your debating skills are weaker than those of a cat.
---
Apparently the definition of DDoS attack now extends to people logging in as normal. EVE must be running on a Raspberry Pi.
---
Well the chaos era just seems so badly planned, giving players no vision about the futures which is really stupid.
---
I wish I was like you.
---
I wish I could play this game a second time, for the first time.
---
Before my soul was sucked out and I became a black pit of cynicism and despair that still plays for some reason.
---
how absolutely terrible at the game do you have to be to not realize the krabs in this situation were ironically the most risk exposed player in this environment??
---
It works properly when you use it the right way... But it was never meant to be used the right way from the start.
---
No Blue Intel!
---
Guys, there is a blue titan in XYZ system!
---
Have you even logged in in the past 66 days?
---
Your analysis is right but none of it means EVE can’t be improved upon or grow as an experience.
---
It just needs a much clearer vision of where the place needs to go to and what steps are going to be taken to make that happen.
---
I don’t see any problem with EVE that is beyond fixing.
---
EVE’s problems are social problems, they’re not technology problems.
---
It worked out great. It cut down on the bots that relied on Local for instant feedback. The problem is that all the "hard core" Null Sec folks are really spineless cowards who fear the boogeyman lurking in the dark. And if they can't see his face in Local, then their fear is too much to bear. So they won't even bother logging in to play in their lawless space.

Leet whalers throwing as hissyfit as usual.

They should port EVE to console.

Oh fuck it’s adorable
---
Totally Agree. It will create WH day trip bashing and could be an actual game play people in low sec or high sec can get into.
---
Jump into WH and notice a low power structure. Send a fleet ping and jump into WH. Kill structure and loot what it drops and ofcourse shoot the WH people if they show up. :P
---
The game didn't change at "X" Expansion or with "Y" Buff or the introduction of "Z" Mechanic. 
---
It changed when big groups realized that being rich was the most powerful option, and the easiest way to get rich is to do it in big groups. 
---
Any of the changes in the last several years that made doing that easier isn't the root problem, it just accelerated the issue.
---
Exactly.

“Gimp your fleet so you have more fun” is the argument.  Losing 80mill ships isn’t half as awful as you think it is. Brave had a ton of fun flying moas against literally everything
---
This post is saying the current meta is boring and I’m saying nothing is stopping him from flying something else then.  You should check out baltec1’s talk at eve north about flying megathrons in every fleet. It’s not optimal but he enjoys it.
---
I would recognize that it's a problem, but are you saying that what's broken should never be fixed?

Probably isn't clearly. An argument could be made that it is a Mac as can be made for Linux. Nothing is for sure from what can be seen. Even the reflection for a keyboard could be anything; although it does resemble that of a Mac it could be a third party clone. Certainly more definitive than some icons on a taskbar though, that's for sure.
---
I was making a point about assumptions.
---
If I was into ratting all I would care about is having local and I'd be doing it in a super. I wouldn't need a cyno to be safe, hell I wouldnt even need local if there was a way to periodically see if anyone else is in system. I have many alts which all pass mains, able to fly recons blops booshers fax. 
---
Fortunately I'm not into it so I don't care local or no local, no cyno or 10 cynos on everything. I instead I've developed myself play styles that are absolute cancer and most frustrating to those I like to visit.
---
Well thank you, that was unexpected.
---
That's assuming the Risk vs Reward was balanced to begin with. Being able to AFK mine and rat 23/7, immediately know when an unknown face enters system, and summon a thousand Capitals to your defense, kinda sounds like there was very little risk.
---
I love the weasel wording in this.  The make everywhere wormholes bit was a complete failure.  This might as well have read, "we fucked up and lost 1/3 of our daily players, mea culpa, mea culpa", but we all know hilmar is constitutionally incapable of uttering the words mea culpa.
---
Nailed saying something undeniably stupid using a word you clearly didn't have the slightest idea of the meaning of? Clearly yes you did nail that.
---
Go work on your vocabulary.
---
Set a timer. You jump into new system and can neither see or be seen in local (unless you or someone talks, putting you or them on everyone's local). Once a short (under 5 minutes) timer runs out, you're logged in and can be seen by residents but also can see them.
---
LOG for the SP, return for the memes :P
---
It is like playing a gnome.. you did it all for the lulz
---
the game will feel alive and well with all those green numbers on dotlan!
---
r/eve is the primary gameplay of eve.
---
Did we ever get an answer as to why people in different null blocks were getting the local of their staging system, even when not in that system? This was maybe 3 sundays ago? I atleast heard reports from imperium and panfam members...
---
For all the hate that star citizen gets, you guys are going to pile on once it has a working economy. xD
---
We hear all this compaining of ccp do this or ccp to that. But in the end its players who are the ones that decided to join the nullsecblocks ala goons/test/nc./ph/pl, were its leaders are responsible for the blue donut. Leaders,  who think that renting out systems , is a good thing, its not. Leaders who think blue fucking is ok, its not.  Its the players who can just decide, to leave this nullsec alliances, and join alliances, who will fight the blue donut alliances.
---
Each to their own ;)
---
Oh god i will not be able to sleeo tonight
---
&gt;It worked out great. It cut down on the bots that relied on Local for instant feedback. 
---
They just moved to high-sec.  No problem was solved.
---
Good for you. Glad you're having fun. Don't mind that we weren't having fun at all, but you do you...
---
@XIX green light
---
&gt; it just accelerated the issue.
---
Remember, there is one main kind of "rich" that's relevant for groups. Capital pilots. SP growth was a hard limit on how many of them you can have in the game in total. No longer.
---
So one might construe Rorquals and injectors as mere "accelerators". But if they accelerated a 20-year course of events into 3 years then the acceleration itself becomes important and deadly to the game balance.
---
Im optomistic. The main takeaway from blackout is that esi gives out way too much info, moreso than local itself. Without blackout happening the way it did i dont think that bit of info would get the attention it really needs. I dont think ccp are abandoning the idea or the thought behind blackout. Im at least glad they rocked the boat, even if it was really dumb. 
---
Looking forward to blackout 2.0
---
True in part. Sure, people won't generally buy more launchers than they can fit because they're cheaper. But they will if they want to stockpile a few while the price is low, before it goes back up (which it does most of the times, prices move in cycles). 
---
Generally speaking, i've found that whenever margins drop, volume increases. And because people want to take advantage of times when the prices are low, they do stockpile and buy more than they need quite often.
---
In one case i might sell a faction/deadspace/etc module for 30 mil profit, in the other i might sell 5 of the same modules for 6 mil profit each. It's all the same to me in the short-term and medium term. I didn't work for that module. I didn't build it and didn't loot it. I just bought it from soneone and sold it to someone else.
---
Long-term? Yes, i will be affected. But so will be everyone else. If we get to the point where the market doesn't move because people don't use anything or player counts are too low, there's a bigger problem to worry about. But even that is a matter of critical mass, it doesn't just drop off to nothing immediately.
---
During the recent chaos changes where some players stopped logging in, my profits were the same. The only thing that changed is that i didn't have to .01 isk people so much because some of them were not logged in, so my orders stayed on top for longer.
---
So, until the game reaches a completely unrecoverable state, i will keep making 5-7 billion per month by typing numbers in a little box.
---
&gt; Revert the shit that was done.

I like how you cherry pick around my statement trying to prove a point but the bits you conveniently ignored already counter your arguments. You should run for public office
---
I wholeheartedly agree
---
&gt; implying eve players are anywhere near that cute
---
&gt; That's assuming the Risk vs Reward was balanced to begin with
---
It already wasn't. The side effect was an unsustainable macroeconomy at the expense of people currently playing/farming in space.
---
&gt; I'm not interested in investing hundreds of hours getting set up for a way-of-life (WH, Null, Lowsec, whatever) that might go "poof" at the whim of those that run EvE.
---
The only change that affected all of eve was the tax changes, which didn't really do harm to any particular playstyle aside from alpha's (because low trade skills) and station traders. They're not changing lowsec or wormholes (at least not drastically) because there's no obvious problems there. Null being dominated by PvE, super high incomes and lack of PvP/risk is an obvious problem that has been present for years.
---
&gt;I had spend countless hours and real money getting to the point where I could fly a Rorqual and start doing some serious mining, and then had the rules change so the risk/reward equation means I'll never be taking that Rorq out. 
---
If you know a ship is *the* best at something, is fairly unbalanced and very low risk, you should already know that it's likely to be changed or affected at some point. If you decide to invest everything on that one thing you already know is broken, you have nobody but yourself to blame for having made a bad investment.
---
&gt;I'm playing WoW Classic. They're making it too easy to win EvE.
---
It might be better for you to enjoy your limited time, honestly. If changes to the meta are making you not want to do anything in the game, a game with zero changes is perfect for you. You can invest heavily into getting to one particular super meta playstyle and not worry about it changing anytime soon.
---
Good your all so toxic I feel so bad for CCP.
---
&gt; Cite your source for the statement that 9 out of 10 players that quit due to blackout were multiboxers.
---
who doesn't multibox these days? I think CBP was understating it. :)
---
I long for the days when only two accounts were sufficient.
---
Why, what’s wrong with your clone?
---
Its all fun and games till you lose a few million dollars.. amirite
---
Large null blocs struggle to attract and retain hard core pvpers in any number. It is known that almost all null corps are filled with bears and have 2-5 pvpers that hold up the corps killboard so they dont get kicked from the alliance.
---
I just love how everyone who gets mildly challenged by a different opinion on this subreddit immediately resorts to insults or rough language, in hopes that it will make their opinion easier to accept.
---
Well, it has the opposite effect. It makes their "opponent" go defensive and shut them out, and  it looks as if they lack the ability to form coherent arguments. "If this guy is too lazy to push his own point, why the hell should i agree with it?", that kind of thing.
---
That's all i'm saying.
---
pretty good ideas. you get upvote.
---
also on damage cap - maybe calculaze cap based on attacking fleet? So it makes proportional sense to all sizes of fleet?
---
safety is big problem, you should be always able to evacuate but only via ships.
---
and wh cant make you rich, ejected ships vs wormhole mass make it tedious.
---
...except nothing but null has been affected by the blackout/cyno changes so claiming people outside of null are walking because of them is false.
---
you know what's also funny? hunters complaining about crabs that they cant catch them due to all the intel and so on and resorting to hunting down bots. They basically hunt for scripted NPCs that work on a timer with dscan functionality, they are pretty much PvEing and feeling like some 1337 PvPers...
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that to counter a lone cloaky, you need two accounts
---
he said to counter a cloaky you just warp off when you don´t want to just kill it because you suck at PvP
---
&gt; and to counter a cloaky gang you need to tank enough so your friend come and help.
---
when you don´t just want to warp off that would be highly advisable. 
---
&gt; And the "untanked ships" are pve ships. I know that's a difficult concept for you but still.
---
Imagine my surprise when i found out that PvP fit ships can shoot rats as well. Maybe at a slightly slower rate than a min/maxed to shit PvE boat, but hey.
---
Says you. I'm sure they have an entire scroll of half baked ham handed changes they conjured up over the many 8 balls they've annihilated together

make cyno inhibs viable mayhaps?

Make sure that current owner makes a thread with the character on the character sale forums stating a private sale is going on. This proves that the person you're talking too actually has the character, and allows CCP to help out if it turns out to he a scam. (Character scamming is not allowed).

Ccp needs to actually employ gamers not just people with a high grade degree.

Curious, does this work for you?  http://outline.com/www.eveonline.com/article/pxx548/2019-09-16-nullsec-blackout-concludes
---
Looks like some other people already mentioned this, but exploration is the way to go for newbies.  It'll help you get familiarized with some pretty important features like scanning, dscan, and wormholes.  Whenever you get the skills needed hit me up in game and I'll take you on an explo run through lowsec and wormholes.
---
&gt; who doesn't multibox these days?
---
Me.  Weird, huh?
---
Only when your desperately trying to not say "I was wrong".
---
The devs were certainly not indicating that this was still an experiment.  They were all for continuing blackout until the login numbers beat them over the head.
---
Well, even with this groups you outnumber them above 3:1 with Test atm. ... in Members and Titans. Its 70% of Sov-Null vs. 30% ...
---
Also I need no krab Alts, I krab with 1 of my mains, around 2-3 hours every 2-3 weeks. For more ISK i buy PLEX and sell them so Delve Krabs can stop shedding tears about "muh PLEX subs" ;-P

Weird.  It saved for me.
---
Just trying to help a fellow player enjoy the game by sharing my ideas of how you can enjoy pve in peace, no matter what side your on.
---
Personally I would probably go with 50b actually, regardless whether it was for a new char or an old one. It'd allow me to largely skip the tedium of ISK acquisition and just do what I want (namely PVP), even a low-SP character can have fun in that regard. My main character with 80mil SP (trained, not injected) doesn't even have 50b asset value... unless you count extractable SP of course, and I did extract some useless skills already.
---
Indeed and they took positive steps towards rectifying that. Nerfed fighter application, nerfed anom respawn timers, nerfed excavators. It was gradual and constructive.
---
Ok, what, specifically, is a Myrm supposed to do when a couple T3s decloak next to it?
---
And when making your proposal, keep in mind the Myrm pilot has spent the last two hours doing the most mind-numbing activity in the game.  So if your proposal includes hyper-vigilance, it's not remotely practical.
---

I suppose I should've added the caveat of "from new" to drive the point home, but that's pretty fair enough. There's definitely some content to be had in the low-middle skill bracket, especially if you're interested in FW, all the farm bot issues aside.
---
So your saying EVE players are just downright adorable?
---
Christ you just posted something that i 100% agree
---
&gt;Me.
---
I found a unicorn!
---
They didn't make everything wormholes. The lack of local in wormholes is offset by the fact that they don't have multiple static gates into every system. What we got in null is the worst part of wormholes without the benefits. And people call us cowards because we didn't like it.
---
I like how you toss out meaningless platitudes failing to describe the reality of Eve, and then demand people take your nonexistent proposal seriously.  And then talk about how someone else is politician-like.
---
Only one citadel in a system can have full power mechanics
---
All other fueled citadels have timer mechanics equivalent to current low powered structures, but can still be gunned

Current low power citadels lose a timer and have no DPS cap

/end thoughts from a bittervet
---
&gt; he said to counter a cloaky you just warp off when you don´t want to just kill it because you suck at PvP 
---
Tell me again how you warp off when the guy decloack and instantly scram you. I'm waiting.
---
&gt; when you don´t just want to warp off that would be highly advisable. 
---
Again, it's not a matter of "wanting to warp off".
---
&gt; Imagine my surprise when i found out that PvP fit ships can shoot rats as well. Maybe at a slightly slower rate than a min/maxed to shit PvE boat, but hey. 
---
Imagine my surprise when your average pvp pve-able fit would still be farmed to oblivion in 5 sec by a smallgang of 2 or 3 people with no counterplay because no local and cloak.
---
I could have bet 500 bil on this and won. I'm so sad I didnt. Bring back Somer Blink so we can bet on when chat will break.
---
And here I was using 18 factories per planet and thinking it's way too low. 
---
Guess my setup ain't so bad.
---
Is there a dataset anywhere that shows the growth of capital and super capital pilots over time? 
---
I think 20-years is a bit of a stretch. Maybe 5-7 without injectors. 
---
Even from when I was fighting (read: dying) the DRF during the fall of the Northern Coalition to Asakai and B-R. The growth of supers and capitals in general had grown at an exponential rate. 
---
Wrecking Ball fleeets, "Omega Fleet". All comps that were full fleets of capitals, 2 full years before injectors.
---
&gt; It's the person/alliance with the most RL money spent in game that will win.
---
If we are talking about caps here, then I agree but that's a problem with caps, not multiboxing. Caps bring very much power to the grid and as such are too easy to multibox.
---
&gt; I've seen a multi-boxer completely faceroll a small WH gang. That's 1 player against 5-6 and they won because they warped in a 10-20 ship fleet on top of the gang.
---
And I don't see a problem with this. Again I say, it's not a competitive game with rankings. I understand if a group feels bad losing to a single multiboxer but in game mechanics it makes no difference whether they lost to 20 players or 1 multiboxer. And as you said, it's no small feat to beat 6 skilled players by multiboxing alone. Perhaps the group didn't prepare properly that they couldn't disengage a single multiboxer (how can he even hold tackle on the whole group).
---
&gt; I'd rather shoot at players rather than toons (some of which will be afk).
---
If by this you mean multiboxing ratters/miners, then it's not much of a difference whether they were afk at all. 
---
I don't play other MMO's so I can't answer the last one.
---
Yes it does, thanks
---
I have been informed by a reliable source that you all have 47 alts. So you each can shitpost well above your weight class.
---
There sure seems to be a lack of vision and the issue of not properly designed features, either because long-term effects on the game are not considered and/or because the devs seem to ignore any impact on other aspects of the game. EVE is so complex - and I'm sure everyone is aware of that, including the devs - yet I get the feeling they sometimes don't fully understand how certain changes might play out overall.
---
With that in mind, I think test phases are either too short or non-existant. What sounds great on paper may not work properly in-game for whatever reasons. Being transparent about future changes is important but trying to communicate the findings and discuss them with the community is also necessary imho. I understand this happens in a certain capacity and I'm also aware that the entire community can not be part of the development process.
---
Maybe a better feedback system needs to be implemented when new things are out for testing that allows players to provide better feedback.  
---
At the same time, this community is just too fucking immature and while CPP might not want to admit that, I'm pretty sure they are aware of it. I've yet to see a proper mature discussions on reddit or the forums where grown people (the majority of the playerbase) can have a constructive conversation about any issue instead of shitposting and whining 24/7 about the "injustice" they have experienced due to some changes.  
---
While half assed content is problematic, it wouldn't be such an issue if the community wasn't such a bunch of crybabies trying to sabotage any attempt to improve the game and instead try to approach changes with a more objective perspective and be helpful by providing solid feedback instead of the pile of verbal diarrhea  that has been dominating all these discussions for almost a decade (if not longer). One would expect people have grown up but it seems nothing has changed.  
---
I'm honestly more tired of this community than CCP with their failed attempts to fix things long-term. That one day when people stop pushing their own agenda (aka specific playstyle) and start thinking about the rest of the playerbase and their gameplay experience, that's when progress will happen. Until then, it will be shitshow after shitshow.
---
Of course you own the POCOs. Why else would you mine on a planet?

---
Here we have a prime example of a nullbear pretending to know what wormholes are like and crying that he can no longer rat/mine in perfect safety.
---
Seeing as using t2 drones puts it right in the range of a max boost hulk (less actually) it becomes an ultra tank barge. Which I'm fine with. More safety and time in field in return for not moving ore every 80 seconds.
---
CCP HAS PROVEN ONCE AGAIN THAT THEY ARE ENTIRELY INCAPABLE OF INCREMENT ON ANY SORT OF BALANCE/FEATURE CHANGE IN THEIR GAME AND EITHER ABANDONS OR CANCELS EVERY ENHANCEMENT THEY MAKE TO THE GAME BEFORE MOVING ONTO THEIR NEXT HALFBAKED IDEA
---
While super umbrellas have and had a great effect, the biggest one really is Rorquals. Injectors, alongside the rework of the Rorq to not be shit have really created the mega-empires. Imagine how different the null landscape would be if the Hulk was still the best mining ship. Hulk not only mine less, they are also much less tanky and don't have PANIC to save their ass. The minerals that allow mega-empires to thrive come from the Rorq and the ease in which you can inject them just created thousands of Rorq pilots out of thin air (especially since, before the rework, it really wasn't all that popular since it could only really do off-grid boosts).
---
You misspelled "remove the ship from the game entirely". Nobody would even build rorquals. And *you* would love that, but only because you don't understand the ramifications.
---
The game doesn't need a nerf to mining in any way, it needs to give us a reason to blow more shit up as a way to "spend" those minerals.
---
If you nerf Rorquals, and all mining by extension, all you're accomplishing is that nobody will ever catch up to Goons in terms of Cap power.
---
I mean they did release a monthly botting report that tells you exactly how much they did/caught/whatever but yeah
---
I recommend putting a lot of fridge magnet words into a bowl and then picking at random and throwing them against the fridge and going with whatever it comes out.
---
What a piss-poor blog. Even though I was directly and negatively affected by Blackout, I'm pretty pissed that it just ended abruptly with no iteration. Now we're back to square one.
---
CCP should be embarrassed. Their complete lack of vision and the painfully obvious disconnect from the realities of the game are just fucking shameful. The unwillingness/inability to ***actually develop features/gameplay instead of blindly flipping switches*** is absolutely disgusting. CCP, I've always been with you, but you are making a fucking fool of yourselves. Get your shit together, or just spare us all the bullshit and shut down the servers.
---
Why? I'd much rather they remove Excavators but double the boost bonuses you get from the industrial core. That way you would see more barges on the field.
---
I mean, the laziest route could just be to look at the most used and least used hull every 3 months and modulate those and repeat.
---
The game can absolutely grow, as evident in other MMO's. The game just needs fucking content, CCP needs to add shit to make players fight over and the players themselves need to invest in this content. It's a double edge sword and one cannot blame one party alone when both are involved.
---
&gt; Tell me again how you warp off when the guy decloack and instantly scram you. I'm waiting.
---
you´re aligned and press the warp button since the cloaky needs at least 4-5 ticks to actually scram you. when you´re actually too lazy to do that go rat gnosis or some shit. 
---
&gt; Imagine my surprise when your average pvp pve-able fit would still be farmed to oblivion in 5 sec by a smallgang of 2 or 3 people with no counterplay because no local and cloak.
---
nobody forces you to be average or to fly average fits.

"It had a gun mounted in its single turret slot."

*That was a t1 salvager.*
---
"Looked like a gun to me and besides, it were coming right at me.  I shot him in self defense. #TEXASLAW"
---
&gt;one main kind of "rich" that's relevant for groups. Capital pilots.
---
Too true.  It wouldn't have been as much of a problem had capitals been designed like the rest of Eve ships, with multiple levels of rock-paper-scissors.  But whereas battleships have almost no role, capitals fulfilled too many, and without suffering a downside.  (For Dreads, even getting killed isn't much of a downside.)
---
But the limitation on Caps was SP and materials......  hmmmmmm.
---
Eve needs to move it's main development out of Iceland. Their access to the mainstream tech/developer talent base is cut off by their geographic location and isolation, which encourages groupthink and institutional inbreeding within their organization. Move an office to Austin, Bay Area, Montreal, Paris, whatever to tap into the talent stream. The Shanghai office should probably also help with EVE rather than just working on gunjack.
---
username checks out
---
I said this in another thread and I think it's relevant here:
---
Eve needs more enjoyable PVE. It brings players to the game, puts more targets in space, and drives the economy. 
---
PVE in Eve is stupidly boring. The blackout failed because of how boring PVE is. There's no reason to risk the reward when the reward is to spend time watching netflix. 
---
The blackout is a good example of incomplete game design you brought up. Had it been accompanied by new and exciting PVE opportunities it may have been a resounding success.
---
It's not (only) a problem of players being too risk adverse. What is the incentive to undock and do PVE when it's boring? The blackout may have made PVE more exciting, but the nature of this game is that ships meant for PVE are not great for PVP. The opposite is also true.
---
So undocking your PVE ship in the hope of some PVP excitement means that you're gimping your ability to do either well. It would be different if PVE and PVP ships had similar fits.
---
Eve needs better PVE content to keep people in the game. It needs PVE content that drives conflict. Every nullsec and jspace (of the same class) system is effectively identical (weather effects aside). If there aren't enough people to populate the systems there's no reason to attack others for better isk making opportunities. 
---
The game needs more variance in systems as well as more interesting and less netflix and afk PVE to drive more PVP content.
---
Or... and hear me out on this, Hilmar gone
---
From the very beginning, there were people saying they only did this because they fucked local chat up and dont know how to fix it
---
Here we have a prime example of a Reddit Warrior pretending to be an Internet Tough Guy.

---
3...2...1...
---
Not at all, but it's going to require a more complex solution and basically everyone on r/eve is currently just pointing at it like it's "there's the problem, just remove that and all issues in eve go away!"
---
its a caracal
---
Well the traditional disadvantages of big groups are being slow and having a lower average skill level. If 90% of your pilots are not very good at PVP they need to wait for an FC to log in and tell them what to do, for example. So you turn into a content feeding ground for smaller, more focused alliances. 
---
Supercap umbrellas removed those disadvantages completely. I would say that definitely is a root problem, because you wouldn't get anywhere near the same effectiveness if people had to fly subcaps over to every problem. 
---
But it might be too late to do anything about it. After 3 years of this the idea that recruiting as many new players and bears as possible might open you up to getting flogged regularly by PVP focused groups is offending people.

I don't mean in the sense that they'll beat a response fleet. I mean that they severely reduce the time a defender has to form one. All the more reason to club everything with super capital spam and we don't want that do we.
---
I would love this, and allow anyone to shoot low power structures in hisec
---
"As an ex eve player my take on ________________" is pretty much this sub in a nutshell...
---
Yes, the Rorq accelerated the issue. However the issues were already building back then.

---
This was a big fight a week before B-R. At this point in the game, Capitals were already as common as battleships. Hundreds of them slinged into the meat grinder (Obviously, that wasn't the plan of the goons at the time, but lol TD). 
---
If you took the industrial might of the biggest alliances today, and put them back into the meta from 2012-2014. Rorquals or not, they would still be out producing what the alliances in the game back then were doing, with the same tools. 
---
Rolling back injectors, or rorquals, or citadels will only ever be a bandaid at the point.
---
Actually there is.       
---
Same for titan pilots.            
---
Every capital pilot needs a carrier skill book, each dreadnought pilot need appropriate book.       
---
Same for titans.
---
&gt; EVe needs Seagull and Unifex back
---
de fuck WAT? Seagull signs responsible for the most catastrophic patches with the highest player and (real)subscription losses ever ... Citadel and Lifeblood ... Farms&amp;Fields was her thing
---
Proteus is a meme inside of whs too, it used to be popular when it was great before the T3 rebalance. The only real use I ever found for them was running FW missions.
---
That is the most childish thing I've ever seen on this internet discussion board for internet space ships.
---
&gt; five easy changes
---
Just because something is conceptually simple doesn't make it easy to do.
---
For se reason CCP doesn't listen when it comes to citadels. Reduce timers badly and make 100% drops in NS/WH and like 50% in low when a cita dies. (and 20 in high....)
---
and unfinished projects but at lrast somehow on track. now we get Hilmars morning coffee ideas - lights went out? BLACKOUT
---
They rack honor!
---
They rack diciprin!
---
They rack the wirr of the warrior!
---
It was just a few days more than two full months. It could very well have been part of a preplanned duration to be followed up with Observatories in late October. My thought process here is that the duration was not set in stone, but based on certain metrics it would terminate at some point up to or before release of the last citadels.
---
hes in Vindi, chink pet
---
I agree with all of your examples. But the activity doesn't need to be dull/dumb to still allow multiboxing. For example subcap pvp multiboxing: tackle, dps and support. All of those roles take skill by themselves, but it can be a really fun challenge to do all of them by yourself. And there's massive amount of theorycrafting you can do for multiboxable fleet comps. For me as a not so social player, it brings immense value to the game.
---
But yeah dreads and titans being as simple as they are, could be improved on.
---
So, when is blackout part 2 going to start? No sure if i resub now or wait to see whats the next turd they are brainstorming
---
Almost upvoted an Olmeca post, but then he came to the wrong conclusions, once again.
---
I look forward to PCU posts
---
No tether on low power is a good idea that I have seen in other posts as well.
---
&gt; I feel this is pure genius and honestly cant stop wondering why nobody thought it before lol.
---
I wish people would stop using that sentence, because it is so easily to prove them wrong. In your case: Groups would split structures over multiple corps/alliances and continue timezone tanking.
---
About asset safety: Getting stuff out of asset safety sucks more than reddit wants you to believe. Keep in mind that you usually did not get any stuff out of outposts or POS, because outposts got flipped (and people used RF or friends to get their stuff out or firesaled) while POS did not really have many assets (except the occasional super).
---
On structure spam, IMO the average Athanor does not need docking, tether, compression, cloning, etc. if you got a structure in space that already provides those features, so maybe that would be an opportunity for a "small" structure like the Gate, Jammer or Beacon. Maybe a couple weapons to help miners in belts, but not visible on the overview or in space when not on grid.
---
If they had kept it to a point where as much as 1/3 or 1/2 of a region couldn't support more than a single citadel or even none- there would have been a lot of burnable land.
---
Citadels doesnt need to be completely reversed, but mechanics need to be reworked. Tethering on M structures, unlimited asset safety, those things didnt exists before on POSes (which we are being told are somewhat comparable to). L structures are way too cheap compared to stations. Tethering allowed on offline citadels is just way way way too much. 
---
Skill injectors should still be removed. Damage has been done, but better late then never.
---
&gt; Oh somone thinks anyone would believe he knew about solar spectral classifications without looking it up?
---
That´s the point. 
---
&gt; Feel free to keep dancing for me monkey!
---
It just looks that way because you´re constantly jumping up and down while flailing your arms around.
---
I know for certain that Init has lost some. Anyone with half a brain simply doesn't undock anything anymore.
---
But still, I do not want that lead Dev back in whos time EVE was massacred to a FarmVille in space.
---
hahaha ... /me cringes
---
Which is the foundation that all of his posts have been based on, dipshit.
---
&gt;SP growth was a hard limit on how many of them you can have. No longer.
---
That's actually not true at all, though. Trading character existed long before injectors were ever put in and allowed anyone with sufficient ISK to simply buy as many capital pilots (cap sitting alts at the time) as they wished.
---
well yes, but its still a playstyle. I love mining, incursions, pvp, sites, whatever. And i liked idea of buildin own jumpgates. now we really get nothing. Eve doesnt need chaos, it needs destruction and balancing equal for big n small.
---
i do believe two aforementioed wouldve bring it better than current ones
---
They are a bit similar but:
---
A Lynx is bigger, tends to have longer, thicker and fluffier fur. Lives in mountains, forests, cold areas.
---
The Caracal is smaller and has those pointed ears which grow even more disproportionate. Caracals won't generally end up having lots of fur as they live in warm areas.
---
Caracals usually have this coloring, lynxes will have more "mountain-themed" colors.
---
A google image search will show you very quickly what I mean.
---
Why would you play around like this, pls delete before  they see.
---
Great post.
---
What would that complex solution involve?
---
gr gons
---
avoiding teamups in that situation is as easy as randomising access. i.e. you can't plan to go in with a friend because you might not end up in the same instance
---
You mean that Eve is not supposed to be on fire?  
---
I thought that was a feature of the game.  
---
Go figure....
---
All the capital changes in 2016 are a problem. If it were 20 hulks instead of rorqs people would just park a FAX alt or two in the belt with them. 
---
Capitals basically condense several accounts worth of DPS/EHP/rep power/mining/whatever into just one, in an age where injectors make alts easier than ever. Totally ass backwards design.
---
&gt; /me cringes
---
Indeed. I keep forgetting the average age on r/eve is around 12.
---
Oof. Google dictionary serving you well. You don't have to take me seriously, I mean your mother doesn't even take you seriously so why should you be fucked to do so? But don't pretend to speak for anyone, including you. If I wanted your opinion I'd give it to you, halfwit.
---
Thankfully, by watching Reddit, you can watch all the mismanagement and neglect without having to deal with it.
---
I don't think rolling them back is a solution either. Honestly, it would probably kill the game. CCP are not in a great situation right now, I'm not sure any change they could try could easily solve the situation. I think years of easy krabbing has made people too risk-averse and nothing's really going to change that.
---
You can't reason with someone that doesn't have the intelligence to reason.
---
Supercap umbrellas could have always existed. The only reason that they didn't is that alliances that had super fleets didn't have massive amounts of expensive, tanky ships in space 23/7. Also were harder to replace. 
---
If you go back to 2014 numbers and put the same number ratting supers and capitals into the anoms, and you will see the same type of defense start to form. 
---
The biggest differences being that ratting and mining would only take place within range of Outposts and the defense fleets being slowcats instead of supers.
---
I have been resisting to sign up for ages but the amount of stupid just tipped the cup.
---
Let me get this right, you've been playing Eve across 11 years running your own corp and claiming to be successful on what you do. Yet still you yolo a structure bashing fleet without doing your homework, hacking the structure to see it's reinforcement timer and scan it for fits. Now it's somehow CCPs fault that your noobs needs to wait for week and half to go back to that bash.  
---
Perhaps your members should look their leadership and you to the mirror pointing out you fecked up, rather than cry in Reddit how "this is hard, we just deserve free B isk killmails because we run noob corp in HS".
---
Just do your homework, set the expectations right and "git gud". I hope the owners are still playing and bring handful of Vexors to defend that poor lil Athanor. You don't deserve your kill, even after the wait.
---
Wow this is the second kind post I've seen this morning. I even helped a krab on here this morning that was sad he still can't rat without a cyno. I offered him some ideas of mine, and he was nice back to me. 
---
Something is very very wrong here. I can only expect the worst
---
I agree but would also add fozzie anoms as the big reason why people cna just ball up.  Hilmar has implied lately that he wants it to change to the opposite, so more farming = fewer resources in an area... and I think it is a really good idea.  But until then, we're still living in an age of absolutely nonsensical farming mechanics.  Like, from an immersion perspective alone, why would more and more pirates queue up to die just because a bunch have died there already... isn't the reason CONCORD gives us standings because we're supposedly making space safe?  Likewise how the literal asteroid belts in a system are only used as warpouts now.  The ideas are dumb but the damage they have done is immense
---
Well...it was real good at driving people away from Eve...so...it was good for something I guess.
---
Seagull is why we are in this mess in the first place!
---
That's a great suggestion. It'll give me something to play with when I get home tonight.
---
What information is ESI giving out that is "way too much?"
---
How would you determine the "entity" that owns the structures, under your proposal a new corp would be needed for every 8 or so structures, a bit annoying but a feesable goal (see how some corps have reacted to war Dec mechanics).
---
Asset safety is interesting, in wormholes the current system works but in null it could easily lead to the strongest factions getting stronger and this would provide a reason for larger alliances to hit smaller ones for loot.
---
What I'd like to see:
---
Offline, no timers or damage cap. Dead in one sitting, just like a POS
---
Online: Medium has two 24 hour timers. Large has two 48 hour timers. XL has two 72 hour timers. XL will still take almost a week to kill with power on but it's still a shorter wait time and the M/L strux are much more doable. Maybe allow setting a four four window for it coming out but no more making it come out on a specific day.
---
It was objectively a bad change. Sometimes changes are mixed and unclear on their impact. This was not one of those cases.
---
CCP is a business. Eve is their main source of income. Any change which grows their business, adds players, or helps retain players is objectively a good change. Any change which drives more players away than it gains or keeps is objectively a bad change. The impact of blackout on the player base was dramatic and indisputable. Whether this disagrees with anyone's "vision" of the game or preferred playstyle is mostly irrelevant.
---
That some people(myself included) had a lot of fun being the hunters in this scenario is not terribly important when so many people were driven away.
---
muh guns
---
Keep Yourself Safe.
---
Thanks for taking the time,have an upvote.
---
Many points you raise are said since the 1st introduction of Citadels, like No Fuel --&gt; No Tether
---
It's just a bad design to have mining yield, boost, storage and compression built into one ship. Teamwork would benefit more with the old exhumer + hauler etc. approach.
---
Please be right. This is the big huge elephant in the room that every one of us can agree is an absolute broken and retarded mechanic as it stands now.
---
CCP, For the love of all our sanity make citadel spam and timers be the next chaos, and don't fuck asset safety at the same time because if you do, we will have the third exodus since summer exodus 1 and 2... eve can't handle it. 
---
Please try doing a good change that everybody wants, without throwing in horseshit that will make people hate it
---
I think you give Ye Olde players too much credit. Supercap dicks were swung around back then because the groups that did it knew they were dominant, just the same as the groups today that do it. 
---
Many groups had them back then and didn't use them for that reason. It wasn't until some of the dickswingers got swung on that we saw everyone tuck their titans between their legs for years out of fear of losing them.
---
people would troll the shit out of that, instancing it is the only way to provide proper structure
---
CCP are going to be shocked when this doesn't bring people back who quit.
---
This is a bit different than the OP talking about offline spam strux. If you attack an online and gunned astra, you should expect to have a fight. A well fitted deathstar POS would nuke the unprepared and it would do it without a gunner. With gunners, they were awesome at self defense.
---
The future is still open.
---
&gt;The SCC has cautioned that the restoration of full communications bandwidth is "contingent on strategic requirements as directed by the CONCORD Inner Circle and therefore service levels are subject to change, at short notice, according to circumstances."
---
He actually has a point. Even during what I consider EVE's "golden years" of 2008-2012, the vast majority of logged in player never left high sec. 
---
I honestly don't know where things went wrong. But for me EVE was at its peak when people regularly slammed BC/BS fleets into each other over shitty moons in low sec.
---
CCP solution: delete anchoring skill, free citadel to every player as compensation.
---
PLEX price will feel alive again too .... inb4 Goonies and Testies again starting threads "muh PLEX sub too expansive, CCPlease do some!!!"
---
Ironically it works similar in practice since TiDi takes over and instead of taking 10 dreads 20 minutes to kill something it takes 100 dreads two hours to kill the same thing.
---
ESI was probably the wrong thing to call it, i mean third party intel tools. Zkill doltan etc.
---
If it were simple to find out it wouldn't be complex and you'd already see it in the game right now.
---
Remove injectors and literally nothing about the current situation changes and any new players can't get to the point old veterans are without waiting for years. Nothign changes, no problem is solved. That's the simple solution and it wouldn't be enough, so clearly something more complex (involving more game mechanics/systems to tackle the overall problem) is needed. Cyno's would have been one thing to point at since they allow for the capital proliferation to crack down on everything, and i guess that's already part of the complex solution now. Personally i have no real clue / informed opinion what the rest of the complex solution might be.
---
Think about a large alliance against another large alliance, though.  A Goons, Legacy, Winterco would form a t1 BS doctrine that everyone could fly, with, say, 200 people.  A Snuff, skillu, ncpl would form 60 ahacs and wreck them.  Why didn't the big blob fly ahacs?  Because not everyone could get into them.  Now, any group with enough farms (read: buff to nullblocs) can supply their members with skillpoints.  60 ahacs can beat 200 maelstroms but 60 ahacs cannot beat 200 ahacs... and so we see more and more aggressive recruiting, lowering of standards, and a move towards nullsec homogeneity in which there is no niche for small, selective alliances in the sov warfare game.
---
Also, damage caps hurt the little guy, because instead of dropping 10 dreads and RFing the big blob's structure before they can form, you have to sit and shoot it with 10 oracles for much longer.  Conversely, it taking a big blob another 15 minutes to kill a citadel is not going to change things for a group that could never fight them anyway.  But that's another of the myriad shitty little changes they have made
---
Just a personal oppinon: Blackout wasn't a bad idea itself, if it led to something. If the resultof blackout was next patch Null sec alliances had to work/fuel a communication array if they wanted local in their sov, that would have made blackout have purpose.
---
Sad thing is, it might have. CCP Falcon and co might of had a grand plan leading to an epic story that would change eve to the better... but the share holders money/loss of players meant a snap reaction to end these plans. 
---
Regarding Citadels, i think CCP's fears with this one is: How do we compensate players/alliances who invested a large amount of game time into producing these structures. I think they have the same fear with Titans, its hard to tell the player who spent 9 month farming that his toy is now a unusable trophy... would be awesome if they froze all super caps/citadels... not allowing new ones.
---
There are many technological problems, sorry.
---
If you could have 2000+ players in space without tidi X years earlier, or if you could run Aether Wars in a W-space system without a single hiccup, you can bet that more players would come flocking to it.
---
If we had real-time server response instead of 1 sec ticks we wouldn't see rounding up in so many aspects of the game's mechanics.
---
Chat has been discussed before, it's a software issue (not talking about blackout but various problems with local, and foreseen problems with constellation or region chat).
---
There's also the building of systems that don't have great tech support (various elements related to physics - or the lack thereof). EVE wants to let you do anything and everything but the game world doesn't always live up to that vision.
---
And not to mention legacy code that is now getting in the way of improving Citadels, managing fits and storage and bookmarks and what have you. And what about D-SCAN which they mentioned they won't look at/work on because it's an enormous server strain already.
---
I could probably go on.
---
I'm not bashing CCP at all with this comment, these are stupidly complex problems to solve and I loved reading their various dev blogs about how TQ works and how they managed to solve various technical issues. But it doesn't take away from the fact that more technical expertise or development would make implementing systems to solve various problems faster.
---
There's no silver bullet, things need to change both on the social and technology fronts.
---
Fuck the people who quit over the blackout, I hope they stay quit.
---
The eve we have today is a result of years of goon majority CSMs. Most content creators have already left or have been forced out by goon brigades see: GigX. 
---
What we have left is the highsec level 4 mission runners thinking they belong in null and that it should be safer than anything else.
---
Sure there a lot of people left because of blackout. But where were the daily threads of SkillU disbanding. Or lumpy folding? Feign Disorder? How about The Culture?
---
These were the real little guys. Not what goons pretended to care about over the last 2 months.
---
SHOUTOUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO BREAK UP GATE CAMPS CUZ THEY WANT TO.
---
OR CUZ THEY HAVE ONE K-SPACE CONNECTION AND NEED TO GET A FUEL TRUCK INTO THEIR WORMHOLE
---
Link them all together in a system. Reinforce or kill a fort and all the smaller structures in system get shields reinforced for free.
---
Need to make it harder to plant citadels in hostile sov first, but that's a change that's needed anyway.
---
When citadels auto-repair, only restore 20%. Require the rest to be repaired by players.
---
Make the ridiculous once a week reinforce timer only apply to keepstars.
---
In the "golden age" people didnt leave high sec because of the gameplay it provided.  Low/Null  sec was legitimately scary and intimidating for new players, but it was also very alluring aswell.  Hearing tales of big wars/fights in low/null pushed those people to join corps/alliances that partook in things such as slamming BC/BS fleets
---
So while sure a lot of people were in highsec, that doesnt mean highsec was/should be the area the game is balanced around.
---
Yeah not getting scammed so thanks :)
---
Fair point honestly. There are still more plays around a FAX, a lot of electronic warfare you can do to rend it useless while you munch on the Hulks. A couple Hulk kills is better than the 0 kills you get for attacking a mining fleet inside an umbrella right now.
---
Until there is an incentive to fight that is more rewarding than the incentive to cooperate, nothing will change.
---
It's just like the real world, where as countries develop, cooperation becomes more profitable than conflict.
---
So eve should just roll over to the baby boomer generation thats too smooth brained to hit a dscan button every so often?
---
So... who left?
---
&gt; Groups would split structures over multiple corps/alliances and continue timezone tanking. 
---
ok this is good feedback, I didn't think about it but it would make sense to. However, iterating on my idea, you could solve that by basing the queueing on access lists: you have docking rights (other than public/ freeport), your corp counts as part of the coalition. How about that?
---
&gt; IMO the average Athanor does not need docking, tether, compression, cloning, etc. if you got a structure in space that already provides those features 
---
agree.
---
You think the current eve economy is sustainable?
---
So you're telling people to work more instead of playing the game? Duly noted.
---
I mean, even the Blackout didn't fix the shit chat issues.  Nearly every day at some point chats either broke or random people started showing up in locals.  BUT ITS KAY GUYS NEW CHAT IS FIXED SO WE NOT ROLL BACK
---
CCP SPENT A FULL MINUTE TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT BLACKOUT WAS AND FIVE SECONDS SAYING ITS GONE NOW
---
THEY DONT THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG AND HAD TO UNFUCK IT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY LOST MONEY
---
THEY DONT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN GAME AND ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY FIXING IT
---
Blackout 2.0
---
I suspect the majority of people who quit had 6 or more accounts.
---
I don't think blackout lost that many real people. It just lost a lot of accounts.
---
Simple Farmers anchored these citadels also as an explicit statement on what they think about low power mechanics ... namely that they are utter bullshit. They themselves think that it should not be possible to troll a 30k blob with just 20 active members, and the catch pipe is a showcase for how broken citadels are ...
---
That's fair, but even with the dick swinging, a lot more used to happen on the local level. You had a lot of groups living in NPC null, hunting nullseccers. Nullseccers wouldn't just dock up and wait until you pass (most of the casual pvers were still in highsec), they would bring the fight to you. Local fights happened more often and there just wasn't as many supers to swing around. They hadn't yet reached critical mass. Maybe if it would've happened more slowly, CCP could have reacted in time.
---
Old Eve is dead, and I don't think it's coming back. I think I'll have to do like JesterTrek, hang my cap and forget about eve until the inevitable server shutdowns once TQ goes the way of Serenity.
---
you do realise Falcon is not a dev and does not take part in whats heppens in game?
---
CCP doesn't have the nuance to balance anything well. They learned that their players prefer safety and a completely unsustainable economy, over a dangerous space game. Within a couple months cynos will be in everything non-capital or nullified again.
---
This is interesting! Never have I held anyone in such low regard I can't even be bothered to come up with a decent retort!
---
I mean I've held a lot of people in low regard, but for some reason, I hold you the lowest I've ever noticed! I mean there's almost certainly people I've held in lower regard,just without noticing, but this is still amazing that I can't even be bothered to insult you!
---
Congratz on being unworthy of my steel. That's not an insult by the way...just a realization.
---
The current problem we have in EVE is not risk vs reward, it is assets vs upkeep.
---
Most items in EVE can be built by players and will only leave the game once they are destroyed by a player. The only thing that needs maintenance are structures.
---
You can store your entire fleet in a single NPC station for 15 years without anything happening to them for no cost. The dirt and rust on your hulls is only visual. Even if crew on your ships does not cost any ISK because non-capsuleer money is not worth anything, there are billions of them on your ships and Keepstars, at some point that amounts to at least a single ISK.
---
You can’t force fights against most ships and capable pilots. That’s not tied to fitting a cloak, cyno or flying T3Cs at all. The notion of the OP that cloaks on T3Cs are overly strong is simply wrong.
---
Additionally only a few groups use them to whale, other fleet comps like bombers are use more widely.
---
No. His conclusion is just very short-sighted. "People stopped playing because they could no longer farm". Maybe there was more to it, like the game was shit for them - getting farmed by cloaky/evasive gangs - and no longer fun.
---
&gt; POSes (which we are being told are somewhat comparable to)
---
They're also somewhat comparable to the old outposts; they're both in one and are supposed to fulfill both roles.
---
&gt;Tethering allowed on offline citadels is just way way way too much. 
---
I've seen people complain about this, but is increasing the cost to a few hundred mill per month really going to have any drastic changes overall? It means maybe an hour of ratting on one account, if that. Even if the tethering didn't work, how is that going to greatly affect the state of null?
---
&gt;Skill injectors should still be removed. Damage has been done, but better late then never.
---
So players who make use of something for personal benefit should be given all those benefits and everyone going forward should just be put in an unfair (by design) competition? It's too late to fully remove them anymore. What i would like to see are changes that hamper/stop the SP farms so that skills aren't devalued as much as they are. People injecting into a rorq should be a net negative short-medium term, not something that pays for itself in short order.
---
I wish more people in eve would follow in your foot steps. Take the road less traveled and develop something new. Something that is challenging. Something that tugs on your heart when you lose and makes scream when you win.
---
I have a lot of respect for you setting out on your own.
---
&gt; 2014 was when jump-fatigue was introduced you sad brain
---
You are lieing or just do not know, it was 2013  lol
---
Lol, your tears amuse me.
---
hat gons
---
Thanks for the copypasta.
---
Sounds like the chat problems might be player caused and not ccp caused. Something similar happened just after a large number of bots got banned.
---
Oh the irony lmao
---
Battleships and battlecruisers were infinitely better because they required both an attacker and a defender to COMMIT to the damn grid. 
---
Both sides lost ships, and everyone had fun. Logi, caps, and \*bombers\* are cancer and all three need to be nerfed into the ground. 
---
The game has become way too focused on hard-counters that require no risk or commitment. This is exactly what happens when you let the numbers on speed, range, and tank get out of control.
---
PM me and I’ll see about bringing the wrath the blob. Finding a hole from delve will be on you tho.
---
&gt; So what I would like to see, as a PVP player, is an environment where running PVE content is valuable, a little more scarce and a lot more risky. As such, it requires players to be a team to be safe and sound.
---
I don't think that will work without some changes.  Ratting in a group sounds a lot more fun, but half of the reason why I rat is because I don't need a fleet, because if I decide to run a site and need to leave halfway through it only hurts me and I don't fuck up the site for a bunch of corpmates.  If I've got an hour to play and need to spend most of that organizing a ratting fleet, I'm ultimately not going to undock because I don't have time to actually play after I put the fleet together.  It'd be really cool to have more group PvE content, and even better if PvE content included stuff that could be done effectively in PvP fits, but if you want people to undock you can't unilaterally force them to spend more time docked up putting groups together.
---
You need to be similarly careful with site scarcity.  There's probably an overabundance now but about half of the time when I decide to rat it's because it's the only activity that I can really do at the time.  If I can't devote enough time/attention to group content and can't find any worthwhile solo content, I'm not going to switch activities I'm going to log off.  And again, that's not because I don't want to look for sites, but because I can't commit to that extra length of time.  We can say "people should only log on if they can commit X hours to the game," but that only ends up reducing how many people log on.
---
&gt; We do not hate bots because they are bots.
---
You probably should hate bots.  People abusing bots are frequently the motivation for changes that end up hurting legitimate players, often substantially more than it hurts the bots.
---
Imagine that.
---
Removing a change to the game that many people didn't like is bringing many people back to play the way that they do like.
---
Fuckin crazy tbh
---
He also read a book once about an age of chaos.
---
Our software company also releases implemented input exactly the day we get it. No time for implementation needed ...
---
Perhaps being able to afford to pay someone to defend it is the means by which he can afford to anchor it??
---
Just delete local
---
&gt; For example subcap pvp multiboxing: tackle, dps and support. All of those roles take skill by themselves, but it can be a really fun challenge to do all of them by yourself.
---
This is not true, strictly speaking. Tackle is challenging only when there're multiple ships on grid which are aware of your tackle and are going for it (e.g. you orbit ishtar, but there're few cruisers 20-30k away from him which have you locked and might scram you if you step into scram range). But it doesn't happen often, 95% of time it's orbit go afk (I know that because I am flying tackle frigates myself quite often). And that's the reason why people often multibox them - they still do their job in majority of cases and do not die, and even if they die they are cheap.
---
Same goes for roles like logi (no idea what you meant by "support", i assume that). Sit at somewhat safe distance in cap stable fit outside of major threats, rep, completely AFKable.
---
By my standards, if you can control 2+ windows, it's not that you're so good, it's game which is quite easy to handle. You cannot play 2 CS/dota/starcraft accounts at the same time and still be competitive, because even 1 account needs alot of control and attention; same cannot be said about EVE.
---
The entity thing is a valid point, and it has already been raised. Iterating on my original post, I think the way to go would be to base it out of access lists, specifically docking rights, but I can see loopholes in that too. I'm not super familiar with access lists tbh so I may be catastrophically wrong, but I would look into that.
---
I'm trying to think if that compromise already exists in the game via the form of a type of space where local is already delayed and has existed for a very long time...
---
Can a WHer help me out?
---
Ah, it's not that you think he's wrong, you just dislike the way in which he described it..
---
Fact is that the shiptypes used in umbrella space before and after blackout are pretty much the exact same. Like it or not, CCPs design choices have meant that supercaps are so effective against subcaps that the only fleet concept that stands a chance in umbrella space are cloakies.
---
Everyone says battleships are fun until you have to gate 20+ jumps
---
You have to limit ratting in some way, like lowering the spawn of anomalies the more npcs you kill. And then increse the rewards for killing any ship based on its value. So when someone is doing a roam in your territory people would actually try to catch it for the reward. Make the wreck drop some kind of tag you have to give to an specific faction or the home station of your alliance. Maybe make it so every alliance have a different payout for those tags. Those are just cold ideas. What's important is to have in mind people will abuse it some way.
---
This is a good post
---
&gt; TLDR Just down vote 
---
You don't tell me what to do!
---
Take your upvote!
---
I'm going to miss blackout. The "age of chaos" stuff is the reason I resubbed. Blackout was one of the most exciting changes for me.
---
Capitals were increasingly common before skillpoints, too. It was already a case where the big groups were going to win by blob, because in reality there's no "ONLY battleship" fleet requirement and a fleet with subcaps and caps mixed would still win against a fleet that was signifcantly smaller, which it always would be in the case of large alliance vs smaller group.
---
Veterans that already had caps didn't need injectors, they were already the dominant force able to wipe out anything that wasn't a large alliance when injectors first saw the light of day. The numbers vastly increased since, obviously, people that weren't quite as bittervet "caught up" in power but the state of null has remained the same as injectors weren't the root cause.
---
Pretty typical CCP.
---
Agreed Citadels suck. Make them easy to kill in low power, and return some of the content to this game.
---
It was good at costing CCP 20% of it's customer base.   Op success.
---
It could be a solution looking at access lists but I can't think of a simple way of doing this which doesn't have an obvious loophole
---
Wow people really hate PIRAT yet know nothing about them. Nice dunk though.
---
It may be a more believable claim if the new chat system wasn't broken garbage for the entire 2 years its been implemented.  Or maybe they think they're getting DDOS'd every day after downtime, when people log back in...
---
are you mad? you sound mad ..
---
Not that I matter any more than any other Spod brain commenter on r/eve, most of this post seemed alright except the semi-dismissal of the small guy. And I say semi, because in order to make it hard(er) for the blocs to spam citadels, you have to make it that only blocs can place citadels. Which solves the null sec problem, kinda, but also forces a new player to choose joint a null bloc to feel like they can compete, grinding out income solo and hoping to meet 100-200 other like minded new people that are more stubborn than an Amarr with his church and skin thicker than a minmatars head, or winning eve. I wish I had some suggestions to close that gap but I don’t. I happen to live in a country where the wealth disparity is basically the same as it is in Eve. There is literally no win-win fix for it.
---
Exactly. CCP lacks management and EVE lacks visionary creative leadership. If I was PA, I'd close their office today and move development back to Korea (or anywhere tbh) - even as an interim measure, it would be the best way to safeguard the broader project.
---
Didn't the krabs tell us that was the case before blackout started? I mean a lot of people explicitly said they will unsub and or not log in until blackout was over. 
---
So as someone who will miss my multiple fun generating blackout cancer tactics I came up with and was actually enjoying, I'm sad that some of my traps will not be possible with local because the gankers will choose the risk averse option of not stepping into my traps.
---
I won't be salty about it, I'll simply go back to te things I did before blackout, like spying for super kills now that they should be undocking and ratting again.
---
Thank you CCP!
---
\&gt;&gt; re-subs accounts for another year.
---
I think u are forgetting the part where super blobs and cloaked boson titans on gates made cloaky doctrines the only real way to operate under an umbrella
---
Not disagreeing, but the game was healthiest when people were filtering through high sec then to other "careers". The barrier to entry to pvp was really low too. Most FW fleets were kitchen sink BC/BS fleets. And they were viable. 
---
I think Supers have proven to complete and utter content deniers. Even back in 2012 when NC. was killling off the last iteration of -A-, they would drop titans if they were losing to DD command ships and logi off the field. In low sec barely anyone had supers during this time period, and those that did used them sparingly against great odds (Snuff Box mainly). Without supers the most dangerous capitals dropped were Triage Archons. 
---
I don't know. I haven't played EVE regularly since 2014. And I probably never will again. But for me EVE will always been living in Amamake and undocking to content 23/7. Spending 90% of my time in T1 ships getting fights in the belts or on gates all day. People just throwing Drakes, Canes and BS at each other.
---
Do you REALLY want them to rebuild the game?  This current crop of LOLDEVS?  The talent left, as much as they like to blame legacy code, it's the NEW code that seems to have the most trouble.  Stuff that hasn't been touched in 15 years actually works.
---
&gt;Completly risk averse, completly unable to adapt to situations, "herd mentality".
---
I agree.   Without the safety of the blackout we have all seen the fallacy of the "hard pvper."
---
People like me.
---
I grind structures in HS a lot. I have a list of &gt;100 structures (some of which are gone now) that I'd love to attack but cannot due to the time they are set to exit.
---
Additionally the wardec price change means unfit raits/athanors are a loss no matter what so they will survive.
---
Spelling also not your forte.  I'll chalk it up to your addiction to rageahol.  Come at me bro.
---
This is a good idea.
---
&gt;a lot of electronic warfare you can do to rend it useless 
---
Not really, they get ECM immunity and a big resistance bonus to sensor dampening. Why? Because they're capital ships vOv
---
I disagree with the loot. Asset safety is good imo. But making it less cancerous to grind low power structures would be nice
---
At least Seagull had a vision.  It may have had its issues (though it sounds like a lot of it was due to CCP execs not actually letting her do anything) but it beats the current tards that have literally NO vision.
---
I would bet it won't be back in the iteration it was. It almost killed the game
---
CCP doesn't give a shit
---
Best part is when you have an important fleet for something and then corp/alliance/fleet chats all decide to go on vacation.  YAY CCP
---
EVE is dying again ?
---
It's not that bad mechanically, hack it says Thursdat at 18:00 which means it must be put into structure by Wednesday at 6:00 for the timer to be less than 1 week if in HS.
---
You and I know that, but reddit insisted that because this time it was "on purpose" the end result would change. Amazingly despite all these high IQ folks insistence, same shit happened.
---
The problem with interpreting data has existed for a long time. If you have an agenda you can ignore or omit anything that doesn't fit your narrative as anomalies.
---
Yea my theory was that the blackout is CCP trying to unfuck the chat servers and just gave a half assed lore reason why they were offline
---
Such high hopes
---
Or ya'know don't bother people who only pve, they are hunted. Never heard of any predator wishing there were less prey.
---
Even with local people still get caught. The cyno changes were just a QOL change in the wrong way that will affect how many people try to move on their own.
---
After all the blackout stuff, this all comes down to ccp making our cynos more expensive.
---
&gt;Low power to me means that a. you don't use it, b. you don't use it and c. you don't use it. So it can be shot and so should die. It's clutter in high sec and so killing it will be a lot easier I tell my members because the structure hit point are well a lot less than the tower we just hit a day ago.
---
I mean ,that's on you for making assumptions based on your own opinions and telling new people that don't know any better whatever you decide is the truth.
---
"you don't use it" doesn't generally matter in eve. If you attack a ship that's AFK it doesn't magically drop all of its innate resistances just so you can get an easier kill.
---
Not that structures are perfect by any means, but lying to newbies and having them be disappointed is on the person teaching and leading them. Had you done your research, you could have posted clearing structures as a more long term semi-passive thing to do, since it takes very little to bash a medium sized structure and the loot isn't nothing (could be very worthwhile for newbies).
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
CCP solution:  Throw shit and the wall and turn features off and on without touching any real issues and call it a day(year?)!
---
Like not a single post of you is objective and not narrative driven and koolaid dripping. So you both have your niche ....
---
One affects the economy, and thus the entire game.  The other affects nothing.  I'll let you sort out which is which.
---
Theres a few things going on here.
---
My ideal is that groups defend themselves with people and in ships, that you can shoot and interact with. Wormhole fights are often won or lost on the hole due to how hole control works, where no one has the huge advantage of a fully operational death star. Thats cool, I like that concept of needing ships and people as opposed to one dude in a structure that costs less than a dread but does so much more. I understand its convenient for a very small corp to have fleet level firepower, but I don't really care or agree its good.
---
So if you drastically reduced the offensive power of structures, or maybe you only limited it to damage rather than also having tons of disruptions and literal "that ship will never lock" modules. If you did this you may end up in a situation where the structure is a slight advantage, but not the equivalent of an extra fleet with tons of power attached to it. It does mean a smaller corporation would usually lose to a larger one in a war, but I guess thats sorta the whole point. Secondly, as the more powerful corp, it actually fucking sucks to be better, but for an enemy corp to literally need 1 dude per timer to seriously threaten your ability to deal with that structure.
---
Furthermore having powerful astras isn't actually an actual solution for smaller groups defending themselves in general. Today an astra operates as a gatekeeping mechanic, saying "you need x people to start thinking about dealing with this", you still get blobbed and die, so it just makes the situation awkward for groups that are close to those numbers, but still very clearly more powerful than a 1-2 man operation running an astra.
---
Mind you this isn't about being happy, this is about trying to find what is most reasonable and fair. 
---
&gt;Here is the main issue I see with EVE balancing attempts throughout the past decade: certain players complain about something and demand a fix that would make them happy, even though it's messing up things on the other end. Now those people are unhappy and ask for changes that satisfy their expectations, which then impacts the gameplay experience of some other players as well, etc. 
---
I'll be honest, this is nice rhetoric but I dont think this is actually true. A lot of the bigger issues Eve has, including citadels, and usually against the players wish, are entirely CCP driven.
---
BLACKOUT GAVE SMALLER GROUPS AN EDGE WHEN PUNCHING ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT.  
---
BLACKOUT MADE GROUPS ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE AND WORK TOGETHER WHEN PLAYING IN NULL.
---
GF NEVER MEANS GOOD FIGHT, IT ALWAYS MEANS GET FUCKED.
---
Aren't you the same dude who said wishing other players would quit was "cancer" and yet continue to do just that?  Do I need to cut and paste your previous post for you, or do you want to apologize now?
---
I was a bit worried yesterday, I was about to undock a carrier to jump it to a different fort and I was notified that I was kicked from Test channels, can't see any corp members, and can't see any alliance members. I looked up the character and it was still listed as in Test. Ended up just logging off the chracter since I was getting conflicting information about if the character was in the alliance or not. Didn't want to undock and find that I have my dick out in the middle of 'enemy' space.
---
You can't bring anything that has any value because there's only one ship type that can move around under a super umbrella.
---
Could have made the OP much shorter by just typing:
---
Because CCP.
---
I'm middle-aged.  I won't live that long.
---
Most important moment is that trade citadels print mad money. Everybody ignore that.
---
Thanks for the tips. As for the money making scheme it’s just I see people have really nice ships like fleet carriers or destroyers I really would like to have one.
---
Stop making sense. That’s not welcome here. 
---
Plus balance would not push people to buy skill injectors for the newest “op” ships. Why do you think CCP has yet to nerf the KiKi.
---
It’s bringing them income. And until that stops happening it will remain in the date it is currently in. And once that happens, they will release something new and just as powerful, then nerf the Kiki to “balanced” levels. So everyone will now inject into that ship.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Yea, something really needs to be done about citadels, not just the spam.
---
Thanks please feel free to join and I'm still gonna honor that agreement the day we can plant that gate we will be there to defend it. #staingatedream
---
EVE has literally lived because of the community DESPITE CCP's attempts to kill it over the years.
---
Exactly, they should have had a new system / mechanic to roll out when the Blackout ended.
---
&gt;citadels as suspect in highsec.
---
And if you have a ship docked somewhere and you haven't sat in it for two weeks, it is ejected from the station/structure and station guns shoot it, leaving salvage for whoever wants to loot it.
---
How about not arbitrarily letting people's shit be destroyed just because you feel like it. If you want to make suggestions, they should be reasonable for everyone involved rather than your personal wet dream. It's not like structures in highsec are even an actual problem.
---
It's when ppl comeback to eve after a few years and ask dumb questions
---
Weeks? How bout years.
---
wasn't that accomplished prior to blackout?
---
edit: I upvoted you btw, just want you to know.
---
&gt; Ah, it's not that you think he's wrong,      
---
If I find his conclusion wrong, there isn't much left to claim that he's right.       
---
It's not black and white between the macroeconomy we have now and the sustainable macroeconomy he dreams about. We also don't have CCPs numbers to see what exactly happened during blackout. I'll claim that subcap PVE pilots and carrier pilots were negatively impacted the most, because they were easy targets. Those guys are not the problem for his envisioned balanced economy.
---
Contact Pathfinders SIG...
---
Its back to see what effect cyno changes will have without blackout changes effecting it.
---
Shhh don’t tell him.
---
Get to deal with it in my day job too :joy:
---
Where is the lore? It's like CCP forgot this part
---
Ah, that explains it. I thought the blackout had migrated to hisec. Didn't quite see the point in that, but I'd believe it.
---
Name checks out?
---
So, 40-50% decline over 4 years versus 15% decline over 8 weeks.  Ok bud, back to remedial math.
---
My money is on your money on PA's money
---
No fleet goes and hunts in null covop t3cs in groups. 
---
Goalposts
---
I'm going to get downvoted to shit. But there should be a limit on how many people can store shit in a citadel. And if that limit is breached your structure should function as a low power POS in regards to defending it. There should also be a hard limit on how many citadel's can be in one system and where they can be placed. Finally, asset safety needs to be removed or significantly reduced on structures with large access lists.
---
Many of the CCP personnel played EVE before joining CCP.     
---
I have nothing to back this up but I really don't think the problem is the *devs.*   I think the problem is in CCP management.
---
Well... how else are you supposed to prove you're not a bot?
---
You're debatable
---
correction; not everyone, only most people and only the people on this (primarily null-citizen) community. And even then most are horribly uninformed about their actual mechanics and only think about "i want to kill this NOW" without thinking about what the structures do/are used for. Especially in highsec... literally nobody is harmed or benefitted by a structure being in space or not. At most, ratters/mission runners can get free reps on drones and such conveniently.
---
Its also a testament to braves total lack of competence. Any real alliance of that size can deal with that.
---
iirc it was before and thru cause they kinda humblebragged about it.
---
appreciate the upvotes honeybunny :)
---
http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/1044004/Groen_-_Empires_of_Eve.html
---
That is a copy of Empires of Eve, its not supposed to be free, but it is. Anyway, it does a very good job summarizing the events of the first 5 years of Eve, and if you enjoy it please buy it legitimately. 
---
For more recent stuff beyond that, your best bet is just google, people write articles about stuff all the time, but its never really all in one place. The biggest events to track would be the Foutain War, the battle of Asakai/ Halloween War/ B-R5RB, World War Bee, Tribute War/Judgement Day, then the DRF war, which escalated into the still un-named war last summer (look up the battles of X-47 and UALX for more info), followed by the second Tribute War from a few months ago, and the Legacy invasion of WinterCo that is happening right now. 
---
Unfortunately, until Empires of Eve 2 is released, getting a thorough understanding of what happened between the fall of Bob and the present day is going to be very hard, but if you just spend time googling and reading articles, on Reddit and other eve news websites, you'll understand a lot of it. It is just hard to really summarize 16 and a half years of rising and falling alliances, so even the best histories will only focus on the groups that were really sucsessful, not the ones that tried and failed.
---
As for being a diplomat yourself, goonswarm and test probably have the biggest bureaucracy, but to actually be a high-level diplomat and set policy for a big alliance, you need to be very well known and trusted by the rest of its leaders, so honestly your best bet there would be joining a smaller group, npc null/sovnull/wh, doesn't really matter, and proving yourself reliable. Just, don't be too eager to get roles and stuff, or you'll look like a spy.
---
i always called bot hunting PvE :P
---
Sorry, I tend to forget about the hardships of PVE gankers. Maybe they'll grow some balls with the cyno changes now.
---
very nice Job.
---
listening to the retarded wormholers cost the game 1/3 of the pcu in just 8 short weeks. so...   Heart attack today or cancer in 4 years?
---
and they decided to go back to something that without a doubt is 100% killing the game.
---
just a bit more slowly.
---
Honestly if anything, You may get a few more kills than prior to blackout, Even with local back, Cynos have taken a change, And some people may be heavily gunning to go out ratting again they forget standard safety practices and walk into your traps.
---
Thats great idea for rogue drone FOB! Incentivizes removing abandoned cits
---
To be honest, that is why I "quit", I still log on sometimes, but the time between fights in EVE are very long, I would log in roam for 1 hour or something to even bump on someone, get dropped and repeat, in the end I realized that most of the time I Spend, was flying through empty system or doing nothing on undock.
---
what is there to "reason" about?
---
me and my mom arguing to get me membership on ajpw
---
&gt;The frogs
---
real classy ..
---
&gt;If it were simple to find out it wouldn't be complex and you'd already see it in the game right now.
---
That's not true. CCP is notoriously slow at making even the simplest of changes. For example, it took almost two years to fix the Svipul.
---
There is probably an argument to be made that shows players who have capitals will essentially maintain the "advantage" over new players given that more caps generate more isk. Maybe new players will catch-up if older players "stop", but there are going to be situations where older players keep going. At some point the difference may flatten out at the expense of a game that's absolutely flooded with caps and isk. New players at that point will face an even higher barrier to entry.
---
What's on the table right now must be how much injectors should be nerfed. Some obvious things would seem to be an upper limit on the amount of injectable SP and restrictions on cap skills. Loss of some fungibility would also be necessary.
---
Compare the combat capabilities of a falcon, rook, huginn and rapier to a tengu and a loki... See the difference? As a covops capable ship, you dont have to sacrifice tank or gank to get the cloak... So yes, they are overly strong compared to the rest.
---
Imagine if we could roll back to 2004/2005 when patch day broke the game for at least most of the day of not ALL day, when downtime was an hour long. I mean damn guys, I was in a huge 500 man brawl a few hours ago. Game worked pretty well (maybe some delay going on with broadcasts but meh) was good fun.
---
motherfucker the koolaid is my recipe bro, literally on the patent title "BBTB's Purple Drank"
---
Good post, have an upvote.
---
No, sorry, just asking.
---
I sincerely hope none of them ever come back.   Cancer is not something you invite back.
---
If they do come back, they'll just threaten to or unsub  again the next time they or their leaders get their knickers in a twist over some other change.  So, f'em.    
---
And since Eve is "dying" or "dead" please just unsub RIGHT NOW and get it over with!
---
Honestly the best they can do it's rollback to 2013 code with some good changes like abyssal space.
---
Or maybe there is a middle ground?
---
The reason PIRAT goes to war with someone is if they either get paid to or if they scout someone in the corp/alliance with something shiny. Unfortunately newer players in those corps are collateral damage.
---
&gt; Nullseccers wouldn't just dock up and wait until you pass
---
That always depended on the group. "LOCKDOWN" and blue donut memes are almost as old as nullsec itself. 
---
For example This is from and old Flash (yeah that old) animation: https://youtu.be/dnKk2ysyNrA?t=98
---
The biggest difference between the dickswingers of yore and today, is that even if the dick gets stomped on, replacing everything is a lot easier due to the Everyone-Is-Rich environment.
---
Can you cite a time CCP made a massive decision, then settled at a middle ground?
---
&gt;Also, while you’re at it, make it just 2 timers for high power structures: shield and armor + hull together (extra length means more time for the defender to save it). Keep damage cap for the fueled citadel tho. 
---
Hit a structure off the timezone and turn off all services for an extended period of time. Good idea, totally gonna weaponize it against anyone who is playing in a single timezone. Don't even have to follow up on the timer, just keep doing it over and over again.  
---
Also, extra timer length means very little. If you can defend it - you defend it. If you can't, well, sucks to be you. The only thing that extra time allows you to do is to cry in multiple discords trying to batphone as many people as you can, which is absolutely disgusting practice btw, but most of us did that at some point.   
---
At least currently if you failed to defend on the armor timer, the hull timer feels like punishment, but one timer (never get why people call it two timers - it's not a timer when you come to bash it for the first time, duh) is just so abusable from the attacker's side, especially if both defender and attacker have the similar timezone.
---
Good overall ideas. Third-partying is bad, though. Allowing for everybody and their mom to show up for an important timer is a different kind of cancer.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
FUCK YOU FUCKING PUSSY BITCHES WHINING ABOUT NOT HAVING YOUR FREE INTEL SO YOU CAN GET UP FROM YOUR CHEETOS AND NETFLIX (OR FUCKING CARTOON PORN YOU FUCKING PERVS) SO THAT YOU CAN WARP TO COMPLETE FUCKING SAFETY WHENEVER YOUR CAREBEAR HEART FEELS THREATENED.  GEEZUS FUCKING, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.  DO YOU JUST SIT IN A CUBICLE AND DO THE BARE FUCKING MINUMUM FROM 8-5?  THINK YOU ARE A HARDCORE ELITE NULLSEC PILOT BECAUSE OF DADDY'S SUPER UMBRELLA?  FUCK YOU, AND THE CANCER YOU BRING UPON THIS GAME.
---
AND FUCK YOU CCP....GROW A FUCKING SPINE?  DID YOU ALL SELL YOUR BACKBONE WHEN HILMAR CASHED OUT?  WHAT HAPPENED TO EVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DANGEROUS?  CITADELS NEED TO BE DELETED...THE ROSE COLORED GLASSES ARE NOT DOING YOU ANY JUSTICE WHILE SITTING IN THIS DUMPSTER FIRE OF A FAILING GAME BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE KOREAN OVERLORDS.
---
I GUESS THE MARCH TO HAVING TRAQ BE THE NEW SERENTITY IS IN FULL FORCE!  GREAT HOW THAT WORKED OUT ISN'T IT?  CCP YOU USED TO TRUST YOURSELVES AND NOT THE PLAYERS (SMART), AND THESE CAREBEAR FUCKTARDS ARE NOT DOING YOU ANY FAVORS ON THE CSM.  FUCK YOUR FARMS AND FIELDS.
---
LOCAL SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN A THING, EVER.  TOLD TOMB ABOUT THAT SHIT LIKE 15 YEARS AGO.  FUCK LOCAL AND FUCK WORMHOLE SPACE.  CITADELS ARE ABSOLUTE CANCER, JUST LIKE SKILL INJECTION, AND CAPITAL PROLIFERATION.  CCP COULDN'T GAME DESIGN OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG THESE DAYS.  THE BRAIN DRAIN IS FULLY ON DISPLAY...THE ONLY THING GETTING UPDATED IS THEIR RESUMES.
---
AND FUCK THIS SUB...BUNCH OF WHINEY ASS BITCHES....AND FUCK THE MODS TOO, BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING RETARDED TO LET GS DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING HERE FOR LIKE THE LAST 3 YEARS.
---
We just need to use our reading glasses
---
Part of me feels like the 50% of the small amount of people who did clap just did so out of politeness.
---
No but that isn't a problem with the change, that is a ccp problem. If both extremes are killing the game maybe try something different.
---
I like your write-up but I think it's a little too complicated. I'd prefer making the system easier, f.e:
---
 \- Medium citadels have one less reinforcement timer (same number as FLEX navigational structures)
---
 \- Low power medium citadels now have no reinforcement timers
---
 \- Low power citadels no longer have tether
---
 \- Defender can no longer set the day on which the final reinforcement timer comes out
---
 \- First reinforcement timer comes out in the next \~24h
---
 \- Final reinforcement timer comes out in the next \~72h after the initial one started
---
First, your text is much longer than it needs to be.  
---
Second, yes those mechanics aren't nice.  
---
Third, you made it much more painful for you and your guys than it needed to be. In your case my advise would be to do the first ref alone with alts or very few people. You don't really need a full form up for that one. Athanors are medium structures so they have 5000 HP/s damage cap. If you consider the flat 20% resists that means you hit damage cap if you deal 6250 DPS. To pause it you need to hit 10% of the damage cap so 625 DPS is enough. If you're at damage cap you need 4 minutes to kill the shields. (On low power you have to kill shields and armor but they also take more damage. I don't have the exact mechanics at hand right now.) A DPS fit Oracle reaches 843 DPS with T1 ammo and perfect skills. So a single Orcale can do the bash (in 30 min btw). Usually you will use some more. Drone boats are also nice for a first ref. You can then put a fleet in your corp's calendar for the final timer.
---
Again the new mechanics aren't super duper but most of the bitching is just because you do it as if it's a POS bash and oh what a surprise it's not a POS. At the end of the day, a single person can easily kill an Athanor if the owner doesn't show up. This should on paper encourage fights. In reality this doesn't work out so often though but this is another story and this comment already got a bit long.
---
Oof
---
I agree with you, actually. And I had thought some sort of middle ground for local (structures to grant local, gate cloak delay, ect) would eventually be settled on. But the complete reversal is pretty telling of CCP
---
The blackout wasn't a good thing necessarily. The cyno changes were wholly good period. Anything that nerfs caps in any capacity is a good thing.
---
&gt; while the rest of null sec was dead.
---
you serious?
---
Krabs and bots, rejoice!
---
None of this has anything to do with injectors. You yourself point out that caps generate more ISK and the only way newer players can catch up is if they stop. THAT is the problem right there. Removing injectors will create a disparity between veterans and newbies in how much power they're allowed to have (possibly leading to more "P2W, i can't ever compete so i'm out" and have no further effects. Existing behaviour doesn't change and null is already horribly flooded with caps.
---
Caps that are never used for PvP and thus never blow up are always infinite ISK. So are subcaps, but caps do it faster. Removing injectors isn't going to make the number of caps shrink and it's not going to make those caps actually blow up some day. The issue of injectors is a distraction from the actual problem, as much as some people actually point at it as the main cause for everything bad in EVE.
---
Should be fun
---
I thought the salt will end when CCP brings back safety to the krabs. What's wrong now?
---
So being prepared means jus being in standing fleet? That's not being prepared that is just thinkign ahead in terms of saving time later on with creating fleets.
---
Yep, you bashed folks and went collecting tears, ironically you are back here crying.
---
I don't even get it, most players who were opposed to the blackout didn't even campaign on a full reversal. We even know full local isn't the best plan, just that full blackout was definitely going to be worse.
---
This is pretty good. May I add something?
---
1.  Remove tether from medium structures completely and making shooting rats give you aggression so that ratting subcaps can't immediately dock once they land on said medium structure.
---
I see alpha bots self destructing rookieships and citadel undocks being cluttered with tens of thousands of wrecks so their supers gets the absolute max ticks.
---
Great idea! Makes loading any citadel grid minutes long action.
---
What is she is right?
---
The cyno changes were less than a week old when local came back. You don't know what you are talking about.
---
Sorry, those are tears? Lmao
---
While often not sharing your opinion, this I cannot deny. Slope started with Soundwave leaving for Riot, since then it went downhill ...
---
The good stuff starts on page 713.
---
Firm set of rules. Not chaos enough.
---
Personally, I think I would have rather they made it so that the cyno module took way more PG and CPU.  That way you couldn't have a cyno ceptor show up after 2 seconds and you actually had to use a larger, far less maneuverable and more expensive ship to actually get a cyno anywhere.
---
With that many characters you are better off sticking to P2 and doing 3 day cycles, producing a complete p2 per each planet. It saves you A LOT of hauling.
---
Because more often than not, the krabs are also pvpers
---
I see forum PvP is alive and well.
---
I look forward to the 'spike' of activity, that will totally not be padded by thousands of bots and rorqual alts.
---
Learn the mechanics will save you some hassle - i'm pretty sure it was said somewhere down below but just in case.   
---
hisec low power structures can be bashed in 5.5 days.
---
You have to haul stuff every day, and that adds up quickly as you add more and more characters.
---
Tut tut
---
&gt;Defender can no longer set the day on which the final reinforcement timer comes out
---
This right here is what I have been wanting for a while, I don't understand why we can't force a weekend fight, especially that it will still be in the defender's TZ.
---
Blackout was great fun...
---
Did they just change that in the 10th?
---
I'M SO GLAD THE BLACKOUT IS OVER SO THAT ALL THOSE SMALL NULL ENTITIES CAN GO BACK TO LIVING THE GOOD LIFE; THE BIG GUYS HAVE REALLY BEEN HAVING LIFE WAY TOO EASY FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS HAVEN'T THEY
---
IN CASE IT WASN'T OBVIOUS, IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE FUCKWITS WHO EVER SAID "BLACKOUT WILL ONLY HURT THE LITTLE GUYS" THEN YOU'RE A FUCKWIT AND A SHILL.
---
Carebears pop the champagne and undock the rorquals!
---
"You just played yourself."
---
Worth it though
---
That's what my wife tells me all the time.
---
&gt; Structure grinds take waaay too long
---
Amen. Structure grinding and entosis warfare are two of the most soul-crushing sov-related activities you have to do.  They are utter fucking cancer.
---
Yes the cap that's crabbing :P Other than that for ops it would have an effect but the point wasn't to stop big fights from happening.
---
And how'd you go about fixing that?
---
If you want to fix the game, honestly, just unsub. Vote with your wallet, that's the language ccp knows the best. If eve does soon, well at least we tried.
---
&gt; I need anchoring lvl 5 to deploy T2 bubbles
---
Don't forget propulsion jamming lvl 5 as well.
---
Yeah for sure. In my opinion though all services on a structure of this size should be run on depleting resources. Just "Having" guns all the time while you have to pay for small shenanigans like a clone bay seems non-sensical to me in the first place.  
---
However, that's true yeah. Given the current mechanic it is definately logical.
---
No. When I created the username I didn't know about salt in eve. It's rather boring but I'm stuck with it now. Not the worst name though. You can google it.
---
&gt; What we have left is the highsec level 4 mission runners thinking they belong in null
---
This hits the nail on the head.  "But Goons do sometimes lose some big ships.  And sometimes me and a few of my friends use some of our 10s of billions and go on a roam and welp some caracals."
---
I was a pretty risk averse player when I started.  But I learned losing ships was part of the game.  There would be no true safety, not even in HS.  Also I miss Feign.
---
Could you maybe make this post aware to your alliance please? 
---
Would help if people know them in or out of eve  and maybe get the word to them
---
preach bro
---
The rest of the world begs to differ.
---
Ah, the old DDOSeridoo.
---
If your game balance relies on "not many players will aquire OP entity X because it requires a large investment of time", it is not fit for a MMO that allows an infinite number of players in a single instance.
---
Only QOL edition I would make is allowing anyone to drop fuel into a citadel fuel bay.
---
That way you dont lose all your structures because 1 person forgot to do the fuel run
---
Fast cyno is only half of it. Caps using cynos can make for impossible to snuff out cynos.
---
Hey Eric. You mean shoot BACK at the wh people WHEN they show up right? And contrary to your OP, my understanding was that your guys had some of their best experiences skirmishing over my reinforcement timers in jspace? I get structure spam is a problem in kspace but it's not in wormholes. The difference? Asset safety. Now you know how to solve it :)
---
It’s not sad — it is human. Why do keep getting surprised that whatever mechanic we throw at players human nature wins? 
---
Not everyone can be leaders, not everyone can be loners, most are happy just doing something as mundane as trading and ore mining. Their play style isn’t wrong it’s what they like. 
---
If I kill them, I’m happy and they just reship and keep doing what they are happy about — and I’m perfectly fine with that. I don’t want them to unsubscribe and CCP lose revenue.
---
Excellent. Up Vote from me.
---
I know...I know. I had the same desire. But you need to train your skills first to fly those ships. And you should be aware that if you fly those ships they can die anytime and anywhere in space. And losing big costly ships is no fun.
---
The advice most players will give you: Buy 50 cheaps ships and go PvP. Lose 50 ships and learn. It sounds dumb but it's effective. 
---
See it as an investment. You invest x preferably low amount of ISK for x amount of experience.
---
Btw there is a rule in EVE: Bigger is not always better.
---
lol yea how about if you shoot the rats you can't move from teh spot for 15 minutes, would that make it easy enough for you slobs? :P   
---
Just anchor a damn bubble
---
How does injecting capital ships not have anything to do with injectors?
---
&gt;the only way newer players can catch up is if they stop. THAT is the problem right there.
---
As long as injectors are able to do this, it will not stop. How is it possible to acknowledge this problem but then not support removing this ability?
---
&gt;Existing behaviour doesn't change and null is already horribly flooded with caps.
---
So you advocate more caps because there are many caps?
---
What limitations are you willing to place on injectors?
---
If you're not keeping your citadels fueled for weeks at a time, it's reasonable that you shouldn't have it. Either you have too many, or you can't maintain the upkeep, so no citadel for you.
---
Eh?
---
yea so every no lifer in range can pop any structure in 3 days that's what you're getting at? This is wrong on so many levels, especially with the disappearance of outposts.
---
How about instead of ganking and easy kills, pvpers go join high sec war dec corps (or faction warfare) and have mutual wars? Or is it only fun to ruin someone’s day?
---
Hello TEST
---
The comparison of structure to dread is pretty good except the structure is anchored.  It's able to defend itself and a local support fleet only.
---
Ah, okay, I get what you mean now. Yeah, the amount of intel you can get from zkb alone is staggering. In GSF we fine corporations who divulge a director-level key to zkb, for instance.
---
The PvE is what ruined FW.
---
#RemoveMissions
---
I doubt black out was a front for tech issues. More likely a test. we've been screaming for no local in NS for a while this was the test. The drifters are just a lore reason. But tinfoiling aside.
---
The chat system is shit. But the game can't function on a large scale without it.. even something as simple as getting into fleet is tedious without direct invites.. NVM starting the fleet in the first place. Only time a character is visible outside of a chat window is on grid or in station. We can't play the game without a chat system.
---
You can turn off local but you can't shut it all down the game would grind to a hault.
---
The last two days I've been unable to join chats on my first login so I have some experience with no access to any chat system lol. I have to relog once or twice to get even Corp chat working.
---
If you can't be bothered to use your ships for weeks at a time, you shouldn't have them.
---
I never thought I'd say that I miss the old structure bash system, but it was better than the current one.
---
i do like this idea, how do you feel about
---
1- ajusting the base line cost of structures up in cost by x or xx percentage
---
2- i remember a few years ago the idea of modular pos and that player outposts had upgrade options how about using a mix of these two 
---
so you start with an Astrahus you want a Fortizar you upgrade it want a Keepstar you upgrade it each time you keep the 15 minute timers
---
want to build you add that module on lock it so a Sotiyo can only go on a Fortizar or Keepstar module upgrades to also get there own set of rigs 
---
I'm not sure if refinerys should be a stand alone with upgrade or modular addons
---
3- modular upgrades you should be able to disrupt be it via entosis  or weapon fire
---
4- like the pos move the weapons out side the structure and allow reinforcement/disable 
---
depending on the  implement current engineering complexes and refineries should be renamed like the faction Fortizars and left inplace
---
They probably spent the several weeks of Blackout not actually fixing anything and just watching the salt and drama on r/eve, calling it "player feedback research".
---
I'd be impressed if they actually used that time for anything productive.
---
The abrupt ending was very clearly a panic reaction to stop the hemorrhaging subscriptions.  Sadly it is also definitive proof that they have no long term plan, and are completely surprised by this reaction.  This is incredibly worrying.
---
Don't want to lose your stuff? Fuel your structure or move it to an npc station.
---
You do realise that if no one is logging in you will have nothing to shoot at, and eventually it will be just you in Jita talking to yourself saying “Just Harden The Fuck Up.”
---
a doze attack
---
But you get 3 characters per account!
---
Please don't waste money on this trash fire of a game.
---
if ccp inserted a "player" corp that was actually NPCs do you think anyone would notice?
---
I work harder for my high sec kills than nearly every kill I ever scored in nullsec.  Just sayin'.
---
So this individual has multiple accounts, given it was an venture and an industrial, implies that it is multiple alpha accounts.
---
An alternate way to doing this is joining a Corp of which has 'regular mining fleets'
---
&gt;Please don't waste money on this trash fire of a game.
---
I'm a F2P player and didn't plan on it. I still don't know why everyones 50/50 about everything lmao
---
Can I have yours..since ccp is back peddling and back tracking so fast on this bullshit that it's pretty fucking sane to not spend any money on a CCP Games development..EVER Again....CCP better change some shit if they ever want their numbers to be an inch closer to what it once was...fact is it will never be..too many fanbois and fuck boys have screwed this game. Your just a small circle jerk of dweebs still trying to debate on how to increase numbers...like damn you could have cured space cancer by now...oh how one misses true game design raw talent
---
To be honest it doesn’t matter if it’s six players with 1 account each or one player with 6 accounts, the money in is the same (or more with the 1 player due to them plexiglass and thus per month earns CCP more)
---
Really hate it when people say this.  Blackout was NEVER meant to be a cover for CCPs chat server issues.  You can tell this due to the fact that when the chat servers broke during blackout, local chat would reappear, meaning that CCP simply slapped some code ontop of the nullsec chat to make it operate like WH chat.  They didnt fix anything up/down stream to actually prevent people from showing up; merely hid the data until it was needed, and the chat server crashes removed that hiding functionality.
---
It didn't use to be this way, though.  2010-2014 content was constantly available.
---
M-Structures replaced POS, not Outposts, and POS were easy to remove if not actively defended (benefiting active gameplay).
---
L-/XL-Citadels still can have more timers, they are more expansive and usually not spammed just for lulz or having a no brain safe in every system. Thats also the reason why over 90% of all L/XL structures are fueled and not low power. So your doomsaying does not apply here ...
---
I think what we need is ways to incentive pvp without forcing people to join it.
---
I’m sure in two months Olmeca will do a data post for us confirming his belief that the cyno changes have destroyed millisecond umbrellas, doubled the EU birth rate and reduced global CO2 emissions by 2%. 
---
The data will be bullshit, but better than nothing.
---
1st don't. Anyone trying to sell you Eve is scamming you. you can try it out for free.
---
When you get in game, remember that 90% of the people are scamming you.
---
When you decide that it's still game you want to play and put your money in, the fastest way to make money in-game is swing your credit card, buy plex (CCP's micro transaction currency, only allowed way to do RMT in game) and sell it in market. Remember that the buyers are likely to try to scam you.
---
Skill training takes ages, buy more plex, use the in-game money to get skill injectors. Profit. Just as usual remember that the injector sellers are likely trying to scam you.
---
Don't bother to train into anything bigger than cruiser. Either they are not used, or they are already/in process to being nerfed useless. If you want to do PvP, train first yourself into bomber (Advanced frigate, each race has one and it doesn't need tons of injectors to get into), now you can get into public fleets and kill all the big things your experienced hunter can find without any major risk. If you still think you like it, Muninn is the next thing to train into. this point you can declare victory over Eve and keep grinding the same thing day after another or just suck your lost $s and get some other game you actually enjoy playing.
---
You do realize if your leaders literally didn't force you all to dock up the content would not have gone to 0. Also there was not way for them to maintain it longer than a week without starting to bleed. If ccp didn't back down when they did it was about to get interesting. 
---
Also btw it is still easy as fuck to bridge a recon to a beacon warp to the carebear and light a cyno for your 200 titans with fax to come in.
---
I missed the part where we should just delete spreadsheet timers and just copy past the stront timers from POS's into Cits.
---
NPC nullsec in every region.
---
I love you bro, but you’re giving them way too much credit for planning this shit out.
---
I hope the reversal is temporary till they sort out a real solution :(
---
The Loki and the Tengu would like to disagree.
---
The Legion doesnt really care either way.
---
The Proteus is crying in a corner somewhere.
---
And how did those capital pilots acquire the skill points that was sold on the bizarre?
---
If you’re going to take the character bazaar stand that you have to factor in one skill point is one skill point is one skill point it was all generated at the same rate (attributes and implants aside as well as learning skills way back when)
---
It's part of my new softer not shit post so much side.
---
Damn I would love to call you a doomsayer, sadly my 13 years of EVE taught me you are right ...
---
You did just prove OPs point better than he ever could.
---
EVE pilots being nice to each other. It’s nothing short than Armageddon coming.
---
Blackout ADDED functionality to the chat servers, it didnt reduce/cover up anything.  Every time the servers bugged out  local would reappear because it broke their hotfix to allow for hidden local.
---
Their chat servers are still complete shit regardless of blackout.
---
A solution to the problem already exists. The anchoring points for mining structures on moons. Expand the idea.
---
 - Medium Structures (And Large mining guy) have to be anchored to a moon (1 per moon)
---
 - Large Structures (And perhaps Sotiyos) Need to be anchored to a planet. 
---
 - Keepstars need to be anchored to a star. 
---
As for the grinding, POS timers or POCO timers are far less aids than the bullshit we have now. 
---
Low Power Mediums should be a one and done bash. Larges and XLs should get, at most, a single 24hr structure timer. 
---
Powered structures should start with a POCO style shield timer. The rest should be, at most, 24 hour timers. That way no matter when attacked, they'll come out during the chosen TZ next window and all the 24hr timers will also be in that same TZ.
---
Just let the manchild think change.org actually means anything pls
---
It seems you're dead set on injectors being the cause of everything. nullsec pve too safe, leading to constant ISK inflow? It's because of injectors. Lack of PVP causing caps to blow up? it's because of injectors. I literally pointed out that people constantly farming ISK, in caps or otherwise, is the main problem right now, which isn't stopped by removing injectors and was going on before injectors. You're right back to staring at only the fact people are injecting into capitals and it is the great sin that must be stopped.
---
&gt;So you advocate more caps because there are many caps?
---
If that is all you understand when you read what i wrote, then sure. It doesn't matter much what i write if you're warping everything to be about the one thing you care about.
---
We literally fucking told you this.
---
"TLDR2: well it’s hard to tldr all this but the main novelty is to make structure timers “queue” for the same entity. See point C below."
---
It's got a working economy: mega whales buy ships for thousands of real life dollars and Chris Roberts buys a mansion for 4.7 million dollars.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For the Roberts family the economy couldn't be working better.
---
Fekkin depression
---
&gt;I mean, boo that people defend stuff.
---
That's what you got from my post? Really?
---
My *whole point* is that people don't have many reasons to defend stuff anymore. Like, you really couldn't have misinterpreted what I said anymore. I'm almost impressed.
---
Compared to the previous system of bridges and outposts, the current system requires far less defense and is much safer:
---
- You can put an ansiblex on grid with your citadel, so someone going gate&gt;cit doesn't have to dscan ahead to look for bubbles.
---
- The gate can be placed well within the 300km assfuck radius of a citadel, meaning defenders don't even need to risk ships to force attackers off the gate.
---
- Unlike a jump bridge, you can jump through an ansiblex while scrammed.
---
I'm not saying it's impossible to disrupt movement and provoke a response, just much more difficult, and you need a large enough fleet to survive on grid with a citadel.
---
I understand that. And you're right.
---
Definitely want the best team they can afford regardless of nationality that focuses on what works on EVE and what doesn't.
---
No need to let the IP die the way SWG did with SWTOR the replacement which was far from a sandbox.
---
They got their money out of this client. Time for a new one. It's aged real bad in recent times and they don't even have the ability to correct it due to limitations.
---
Why would this game ever get a influx of new people who stay? Because of a friggen chat block out? Jesus Christ CCP.
---
this is how Eve dies
---
wilting under pressure from krabs and botters and their Korean overlords 
---
it's been fun guys
---
There's a marked difference between ships in a hangar and citadels, but if you're gonna be that obtuse about it, maybe you don't deserve your ships either.
---
I fail to see how being able to show up for a timer that's a few days away is different from showing up for a timer tomorrow. If anything it makes planning easier, being so far apart it caters to the casual more than the no lifer.   
---
I don't know what kind of poses did you remove but a passive deathstar could fuck up a medium sized fleet by its lonesome, more if manned - at least the citadels don't shoot you back and you can come by every few days with a fucking polarized bomber and mess them up (at least any medium citadel) so what's the story here?   
---
people living in hisec should be doing this shit daily tbh, I mean we did it in whs (and everyone else i think did it too) until we cleaned up the whole damn space, and that's with having to seed the target system. Imagine having them lined up for the picking, same day just a few safe jumps away.
---
How about you go play WoW instead of crying about pvp in a pvp sandbox game? It's not like there's even really any pvpers left to cry this hard about in the shitty farming simulator Eve has turned into.
---
No he comes to the wrong conclusion.  He’s by definition wrong.
---
Note how I said the chat can't integrate. As in I know it's on another server and we know it's never worked.
---
Thats a fucking good idea.
---
Same
---
Yes. And I thank you for them.
---
100%.
---
Seems like every other change to the game has been attempting to circumvent the real work of fixing structures. Everyone who plays the game generally agrees that they are the problem, whether you're pro-Chaos Era or not.
---
The only thing I'd add to this is that the number of structures allowed in a system should be tied to the number of moons there (like the old POS system). I'm ambivalent about whether or not you have to anchor them at moons, but the hard limit helped keep things under control and added to the diversity in system and regional value.
---
It was hilarious.
---
Explain how injecting capitals does not have anything to do with injectors.
---
&gt;nullsec pve too safe, leading to constant ISK inflow? It's because of injectors.
---
Partially. How does players injecting capitals to protect farming caps not have anything to do with injectors?
---
&gt;which isn't stopped by removing injectors and was going on before injectors. 
---
You have to turn off the influx of instantly injected caps. Why do you think this should not be done?
---
“Huh I thought that woulda fixed it...”
---
Ok they can be mindlessly simple, but there are playstyles where it can also be challenging. I'm not trying to pretend I'm superior in the game if I multibox, it just makes the game more enjoyable for me.
---
To expand on my multiboxing, tackle can be challenging if your goal is to decloak+scram+web+survive all on a single ship. If the target has neuts, you need constant focus to keep tackle, and if the target is dangerous to small ships, you need to find a way to disengage as soon as dps catches up. The dps ship I use also needs attention so the drones don't die and that reps/neuts are cycling correctly. And lastly the support I use is for remote sebos and hauling 3200 boosters if needed, but support could be anything from ewar/logi/links/longtackle/boosh.
---
None of your points really answer my initial question of why is multiboxing a problem.
---
Imagine being so buttblasted about blackout ending you ddos ccpz
---
Whoever was expecting chat servers and channels to function nominally after today's server restart, has not been playing EVE Online for the past year. Every single time CCP has even looked at chat, it has broken down.
---
PS: I'm beginning to wonder if I'm enough of a masochist, to keep paying for 2 subscriptions and spending all of my invaluable free time on a game that is drastically turning into a state of beta-testing. I guess I'll find out in a couple of months, when I'll have to dip in my pocket and reach for my credit card again...
---
Mining in high sec is the least profitable activity in EVE. Think of how long it takes you to mine 20 million isk worth of ore, you can make that by doing one Relic site in a wormhole for example. If you like mining then go for it. But if you're doing it to make isk then do literally anything else. 
---
To do what he's doing you need two omega accounts. The game won't let you log anything else in if you have an alpha account logged in, and circumventing that is against the rules.
---
I plowed those fields allready.
---
Game's pretty much dead. Only reason players keep it going is because you autistics keep trying to e-peen on each other.
---
If you fucking sociopaths would realize the salt Isn't worth the time and effort, then this game could properly die like Rift and Tribes:Ascend.
---
What is the difference exactly? Someone paid for it, someone fit it, it is their property and it existing is, at least in highsec, which is the topic of this thread, of zero consequence to anyone.
---
If you still want to have that destroyed and wish to haveno risk or effort to do so yourself, then you're literally just stating you want someone else's assets destroyed just because.
---
I think you're confused. Please find your nearest junior FC for help
---
Lol, I'm not the one who is in need of a hug.
---
&gt; Link them all together in a system. Reinforce or kill a fort and all the smaller structures in system get shields reinforced for free.
---
How would that work for structures that are not in the same alliance?
---
Tbh I think that would be even worse. All the back and forth bullshit will fatigue people more than it already has. Sunken cost is all that's keeping people in new eden, and that's not forever
---
Hug me daddy
---
I soloed a PL legion in a pvp fit ratting vni last night. 
---
:^ )
---
The "cHaOS eRa" seems to be an excuse to throw some dumpster ideas out there.
---
It literally fucks up once in awhile compared to how many accumulated hours it has worked.
---
I prefer no timer or damage cap for low power and 24/48/72 hour timers (with a desired but randomized time to exit RF).
---
The reason for this is it has a universal effect. Tying the assault to ADMs means this fix would have no impact in NPC NULL, highsec or lowsec. It's also simple which I would hope makes coding it a bit easier.
---
Who wants to sit around in a bomber watching other people rat?
---
My vni dumpstered a legion yesterday. Good guys won again.
---
I see this as an absolute win.
---
SHUT UP ITS A FEATURE! ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?!
---
I'm in v0lta btw.
---
This bait was expertly laid, I will admit. It's the perfect circumstances for it. Another massive change sent people reeling, the age of not being able to tell if people are sarcastic or mentally deficient, speaking as a caricature of a player, the values judgement implied, the simplicity of being two sentences. Bravo my friend, you will reap many downvotes for this from people who don't realize it's bait, but true shitposters recognize true shitposters. Well played, friend.
---
Unless you're serious then lmao
---
CCP solution:  Create a shiny exciting new ship, regardless of balance or effect on the meta, so that people forget about all the broken shit for a week.
---
That's the right way to go about 0.0. My comment is more directed at the no tank myrm or domi that complain about an actual pvp ship killing them. Like... that is how guns work man. Sacrifice the ticks, don't be full afk, kill them back. Then you get a loot bonus too
---
Absolutely. 
---
Neither has any confidence that CCP will actually make things better.  Awful messaging and communications is how you get awful reception.  
---
I still think that if both the PvP and PvE players had felt that their gameplay was valuable to CCP, and they had a voice in the process of change, and everyone had a chance to share in CCP’s grand vision (if they had one) it would have ended better.   
---
As it ended,  each side disliked each other even more, with the only thing anyone can agree on is that none are fans of CCP. 
---
They need to bring out Fozzy to play good cop to Falcon’s bad cop next time.  :-)
---
Scram one of them, full neuts on it, put drones, overheat reps. That is if you fail to be aligned or light a cyno or have the other 20 people in system warp to you.
---
What is your name in game
---
I had the chat showing local several times during the blackout heh
---
Citadels, unlike ships, exist in shared space and are meant to be an asset that can be targeted and destroyed, and also must be maintained. Ships in hangars don't exist as far as anyone else is concerned, and they don't cost resources to maintain, nor are they meant as content creators simply by virtue of existing.
---
Yea they did
---
Krabs and bots: *Log in all their alts*
---
CCP: *DDOS Attack!*
---
You know fuck all about anything related to pvp. Again you have a citadel in every system you can warp to to be safe with one button, ansiblex gates where you literally can't be caught, supercap umbrella, people in your own system. You have almost every advantage. And now you have local again.
---
&gt; Final reinforcement timer comes out in the next ~72h after the initial one started
---
Still cancer. Let the M strux have 24 hour RF and add a day for the L and then another for XL. Let the defender choose a time BUT NOT A DAY and have a random window 4-6 hours around it.
---
If EVEs lucky, it the incipient panic at CCP will lead to another Seagull situation where a lead dev with actual vision and ideas that work is brought in to clean house.
---
If not, then the death ride to sub-10k concurrent players will continue.
---
"a few unsubbed" lol
---
You're not a white mouse, you're more like pavlov's dog.
---
Shhh CODE are special. Don't make them think their head might pop from the effort.
---
LOL. because CCP knows how to FAIL!  it is almost criminal what they have done to the game and their roadmap has been fucked ever since seagull left... there i said it,  fuck it,  dont care no more, CCP games more commonly known as sold out games, proves yet again, their lack of vision, knowledge, fair gameplay and problem resolve management, GAME DESIGN (they dont know shit obviously since in constant state of FIX SHIT!), and FAIR TREATMENT OF ITS VERY OWN PAYING CUSTOMERS...this is more than rage, this is more than whine, this is fight with your motherfucking wallet,  asset safety extortion needs to be fixed next!.. fix a whole lot of shit before you even see your numbers rise if at all again. and you silly rabbits once laughed at my long ago prediction that you would one day be able to buy skill pts... hahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I like. I think I'd allow the defenders to set a time and then have a randomized window of two to three hours either direction from that time to set the exact time it comes out.
---
It reduces third partying since there are a lot more weekend timers you can pursue, otherwise it would be the same as current. 
---
I would also argue that right now with specified day on every single structure, you can third party easily since you can just have all your structures come out on Wedneday for example which means every other day is third party day. Alliances that currently third party would be more pre-occupied, since they would need to defend more structures over different days of the week, and would be able to pursue more content themselves by hitting rival structures over the week rather than on the one single day that their opponents use.
---
You're partly right.
---
&gt; The people who just want to PvE in peace and pile up isk while feeling safe
---
This is an overly simplistic view, one all too common on /r/eve. Very few of the nullsec PvE players are pure PvE and it's not about safety. The bulk of nullsec does both PvP and PvE. A better way to look at it would be that these players want to be able to defend themselves and not just be fodder served up on a platter in the name of content. This is what went wrong in blackout, people considered the perspective of the hunter, but dismissed the perspective of the hunted as invalid. Big surprise that when you signal to a huge block of customers that they don't matter they start leaving.
---
What has happened is that as the game has gotten older, so has the player base. The overall game has become much more casual than it once was. People want to be able to undock, do a thing, then just dock up and log out when they're done. The days of people tolerating hours of space chores around doing something are over. This is why the big null blocs are so successful, they use an economy of scale to minimize the chores and maximize the actual playing of the game. They still PvP, they still want to PvP, they're just less willing to spend hours of preparation for it.
---
It's also I think the main source of stagnation. As the player base has gotten older and more casual, there are fewer people in the FC and leadership roles who are willing to do the chores necessary to be successful at it. Wars are driven by a small number of people putting a tremendous amount of time and effort into the game. We have fewer of these people, and game mechanics that have increased the effort required to wage war. (e.g. Fatigue, Citadel timers/spam/timezone tanking.) We have the state of asset safety making it easy to lose a war, so why bother fighting?
---
&gt; they probably need to focus what they have on making the PvE experience better
---
This is what Eve has needed since the start, it has always been the weak point of the game. Better PvE does not mean less PvP, just the opposite. Good PvE is the path to putting the game back on a trajectory of growth. Good PvE means more targets in space. It means more for people to do when not PvPing.
---
The path to putting Eve back on a path of growth is to finally bite the bullet, do a proper PvE overhaul, and remove the bad PvE so pervasive in the game. Not another one-off isolated system, but a proper replacement for all of the bad PvE in the game. The problem here is that this isn't easy, and is probably well outside of CCP's capabilities at this point.
---
On the more immediate side and more practical to actually do, the game needs to have the barriers to wars reduced and the impact of wars increased. It's been hammered on plenty already but jump fatigue and jump ranges need to be readdressed for the current player counts. Citadel mechanics need to be tweaked to reduce the timer spam and timezone tanking. Asset safety in nullsec should be reduced(though probably not removed).
---
every ratter that goes unchecked devalues the currency for everyone
---
&gt; who are left want to have, clearly is one of being rich, powerful, and most of all, safe.
---
I don't want to feel safe.
---
The safety is the least interesting part of the game. It's nice when I'm having a lazy day, but not the reason I play the game.
---
I was gonna make a post about this, but never got around to it. The mechanism to automatically remove SP after a T3C loss is bugged. I lost a tengu in 2017 and had my loss reverted both ship and SP. ( It was my only ship reimbursement so they approved it automatically).
---
Since then, I have not lost SP from any T3C loss. I've lost 2 Tengu and 4 Loki without SP loss so far.
---
&gt; what happened with blackout.
---
What happened with blackout is exactly what CCP said would happen except for letting it run longer than originally announced.
---
a&gt; If they do decide to make further changes please please work with them not against them.
---
CCP has become a company completely cut off from its community. It began two years ago with the firing of the community team, the closing of Thunderdome, the (temporary?) cancelling of Fanfest, the (temporary?) cancelling of the AT, etc...
---
a&gt; Undock, get out, find some targets and start shooting. Larger alliances/coalitions, please do your part and destroy this blue donut. Make enemies again, bring back the wars and bring back the content this game needs to survive.
---
Quick reminder: there was a (superlame) war going on before the Drifters reffing the structures like headless chickuns, and CCP put a stop on this conflict. This pseudo lame-ass conflict wasn't interesting, one of the parties decided not to play along, but *something* was happening. The game's narrative didn't come to a full stop.
---
TLDR: you can't stop CCP shooting a bullet in their own head.
---
that train of thought would give insurance scamming a whole lot more of a reason to exist. no need to sell stuff anymore, just build it, insure it, then blow it up and get nearly the entire worth in ISK, no taxes, just the payout share for the killer, but thats what alts are for
---
I agree, to a certain extent. 
---
The 'PVErs" and the 'PVPers' have become the same group. How players think about their endgame and work together for it has changed dramatically over the years. 
---
I don't think CCP Hilmar is nostalgic at all, he never cared much personally until recently. I think Hilmar is surrounded by people who *are* nostalgic and have been around for so long that he assumes that their ideas are the correct or popular ones, without taking the broader changes to the players playstyles and mindsets over the years.
---
There was more than 1 Blackout?
---
&gt; yea so every no lifer in range can pop any structure in 3 days
---
Yes. Why is this a problem? If you can't put together enough defenders with three days notice, it should be able to pop. Personally I'd have it take 2 days to kill a M, 4 to kill a L and 6 to kill an XL. Your important strux get a little more time to prepare but not a ridiculous window of a week plus.
---
Doesn't fix proliferation and TZ tanking. There are systems with 100+ moons and/or 15+ planets.
---
Timezone tanking is the worst invention ever and should never have hit the live server.
---
Or just have the citadels in system match the TCU timers
---
Totally agree with that as hunter too, blackout was great, it made efficient botting pretty much impossible, removed perfect intel while still technically maintaining the ability to reasonably defend pveers.
---
One argument i often heard was that it made subcapital ratting obsolete, which is not true. The problem is that most major blocs didnt even attempt to defend subcaps. If you got an active defense fleet near that system, you should be able to save most of the subcap ratters which get attacked by solo hunters in t3cs/strats/recons and so on.
---
I agree that cyno changes however were too radical. The only real problem with cynos was invulnerable cynos in rorquals with panic in my opinion. They should have just removed the ability to panic and cyno at the same time.
---
Oh no, someone will be 1 day of spodbrainizing behind!
---
Not invalidating your point, but I think you never went into some space. We got a few dozens systems in our region hosting 10+ L sized structures, mostly fortizars.
---
But HOW do you do that?
---
It is pretty much just that these people that don't want to PVP can never be made to PVP.
---
Pretty solid ideas.
---
Some systems do, yeah. Not an abundance. Those systems would become a valuable resource to fight over. 
---
On the fence about TZ tanking, though. Yes it gets abused, but removing it completely cuts off entire countries worth of players from being able to have structures that they can defend themselves.
---
Point 2 translation: oh, no, we cannot drop our 10 titans via a bait maller on that nasty caracal roaming our space. Sad times.
---
The ticks get sexier when you start pulling blingy shield boosters out of Loki wrecks...
---
Not sure they must over communicate about the end of blackout.  
---
I guess most of player who left (or dont log atm) do it because they are tired of "months ccp shit" so blackout and cyno was just the *red line*  
---
that's my case &amp; at least 3 players i talked in the last days, i still follow the news but for now i won eve :)
---
1. You addressed zero points there though. Where is the lie?
---
2. You just asked me if I "ever scouted for a null fight." I answered that I did. Reading comprehension?
---
3. Literally never used "dirty krabs" but ok. Apparently pvp is the "dirty ugly side of eve." Why don't you play wow or something less pvp oriented rather than trying to shit up our game?
---
Sounds like they completely broke local.  Again.
---
Ah good, now I can go back to keeping entire systems docked up while I'm at work.
---
&gt;Explain how injecting capitals does not have anything to do with injectors.
---
Even when highlighting the actual issue, all you see is injectors. The state of null is only because of injectors, caps and their use is perfectly balanced if not for injectors. No changes are needed, just injectors removed. It's like you're on a religious crusade.
---
&gt;Partially. How does players injecting capitals to protect farming caps not have anything to do with injectors?
---
Obviously no capitals or capital pilots existed before injectors were introduced. And people have been unable to gain SP in the standard way since so nobody has trained into capitals over the past 3-4 years without injectors. Clearly, all the capitals ever were because of injectors.
---
As i stated before, caps and the umbrella they provided was an issue *before* injectors existed. It has gotten worse, in large part thanks to injectors, yes. But they weren't the only thing and removing them now isn't going to magically revert things and make the problems that were already there before go away.
---
&gt;You have to turn off the influx of instantly injected caps. Why do you think this should not be done?
---
Why do you "have to"? Injectors have been a tool in an existing problem. You don't fix problems by ignoring them and going after the tool. 
---
Turning it off now just makes the people who are printing ISK now continue printing isk, flip the bird to anyone else who didn't get in on it before and let all the problems fester rather than fix them.
---
The nice thing about worm hole life was the ability to see a sig pop-up to warn you to go scan or die.
---
It is a static warning that you don't get with a persistent gate with blackout. always a 50:50 chance someone just jumped in with a sig.
---
You would have to have a scout on each gate and deal with worm holes in null with blackout.
---
And you can still be dropped on.
---
Seems unbalanced to me.
---
Even the worm holes help to tell you if it is an in hole vs an out hole.
---
Missions are fairly important considering the current system upgrade scaling.
---
Other than that I mostly agree.
---
Both the upgrade scaling (how much you need ot donate to upgrade) and plex payouts may need to be adjusted if missions are removed, but it can give some time for it to balance out.
---
The lower LP amounts will increase their value, but it doesn't work if the items themselves aren't worth it. Like if ded gear or t2 abyssal gear is better and cheaper than faction stuff
---
But it could take a long time for the LP in peoples journals to go away. I have like 15m LP and I know I'm not even a major player.
---
So they are scammed into injecting rorqs?
---
&gt;The experience that most of the people who are left want to have, clearly is one of being rich, powerful, and most of all, safe.
---
This isn't necessarily because they're (total) cowards, though. Ratting supers and rorqs take like 50-100h to return a good profit, and you *need* the good profit if you're pursuing titans, which are the only ships that matter in sovwar. 
---
When you need to survive for a hundred hours in your krab ship, anything less than total safety is unacceptable - the math just doesn't add up. This is what we really need to address to deal with the nullbloc/hunter dynamic. 
---
Eve's PvE system has sucked in a lot of ways since 2003; it's repetitive, dull, bottable, skinner-box bullshit and every other MMO has a better system. But right now, we need to address it because it's fundamentally opposed to good content; you can either have good PvE or good PvP in a region, never both. CCP's next change should be a total PvE overhaul.
---
Damn, krabs will miss 10-20 ticks because of broken local for a few days. Horrible.
---
They're gonna have to start with a working _anything_
---
It's about emergence.
---
That you are playing the role of a pirate, seeking out and taking opportunities as they appear.
---
Mutual conflict can be fun, but can be less meaningful.
---
But FW already does a bit of this, with lots of mutual combat.
---
Aynone who replies to a thread like this is a) a scammer b) notifying you of scams going on in this thread or c) both
---
All I see is crying everywhere. You sound like a little kid who didn't get his way.
---
CCPs fear is probably that two organized groups will square off and farm each other for infinite richmoney.
---
And lets be honest, EVE players being what they are, this is exactly what would happen.
---
I really don't have an answer to how to do that, but people are already used to being safe, and forcing them do be in danger against their will, will just force then to start complaining or simple not playing anymore.
---
Did anyone else catch the porn audio in the background ? Or do I just have a dirty mind.
---
Are you telling me yours stopped after divorce?
---
Hey it’d be an upgrade from hamsters right?
---
The timing of this thread is hilarious give that local has just been rolled back to show people in NS.
---
So now that ratting ships can't fit cyno's you might have to take your thumb out of your arse and brain out of neutral or otherwise stop watching netflix.  Check local, heaven forbid check your D-Scan, here is a tip, pressing V is a key shortcut to refresh your D-scan.
---
No go forth and rat!
---
&gt;you have to factor in one skill point is one skill point is one skill point it was all generated at the same rate
---
This is true for regular training, but you have to understand this is true for injectors as well. The ratios are different, but all the SP's were generated by actual accounts. If injectors never came to be, you'd likely be having "cap pilot farms" the same way you have SP farms today. It would be a lot clunkier, but where there is a demand and gains to be had, people will jump on ways to meet that demand.
---
yeah and insulting players with a different oppinion makes your brain seem larger?
---
&gt; * Remove all Hull timers from structures in sov nullsec so they only have Shield and Armor timers, they would die if they reach 0% Armor.
---
* If you own the TCU in the system, you can select 1 structure, with a 24 hour spoolup, to be your 'capital' structure of the system, the capital structure gains the hull timer.
---
* Low Powered structures therefore would die in a single cycle if they aren't the capital.
---
I would be ok with this idea if the structure was still there, i.e. you have to shoot through it. So 1st timer is shield, 2nd is armor through structure. If it's low power, shield through armor through structure. (remove damage cap on low power structures).
---
Her vision brought us citadels. 'nuff said.
---
50% decline in 50 months vs 15% in 2 months. If you don't see which one of those are greatest then you should probably stop posting.
---
Also, the Imperium leadership has been doing all they can do to keep people playing.
---
When a content creator gets themselves banned, why even bring them up.
---
You do realise that you guys also only use cloaky doctrines when fighting under a hostile umbrella, right?
---
This is the real issue. Way back when CCP said they would decided by April of like 2017 or something whether or not to go back to the old system. The time came and they decided they could fix the new chat system, but never have been able to.
---
did they recently make it easier to give gold or something? seems like i see it everywhere now
---
Yep. Nailed it.
---
&gt; CSM14 (the current council) have a member or two that think things like the blackout are amazing and should stay forever.
---
I didn't know CCP Falcon was on the council.... /s
---
You need to break a few eggs.
---
I think it's not so much that we can't "force them" it's that we need to ease it slowly, so that some of them have time to maybe try it, as well as have a more danger focussed playerbase replace those that leave.
---
But also, I would agree the blackout alone without any other good changes for nullsec was pretty bad.
---
I think we need to encourage sprawl, and make capital umbrellas less effective (seriously, who the fuck thought HAW were good? Did they forget about how awful tracking titans were for the game?)
---
"Haha, They'll never scam me that way, I'm just here for the free trial." -less poor me in 2016
---
So for those of us at work....I take it no surprise and they don't actually work?
---
There are good and bad in your version, but it doesn't address the two main points :
---
\- Structure proliferation : Even with one less timer, or even 0 timer due to low power, it is still ultra cancerous having to  clear 25 raitaru/astrahus per system. 15 min bashes at dps cap is not fun. There should be a way to greatly discourage structure spam (preventing it completely will be gamed) .
---
\- Timezone tanking : POS system was better because you could try to force fights to not be in the actual defender timezone, with all the mindgame behind the stront count in the POS to change it.
---
You will bash the shield in off hours and have to actually alarm clock (AUTZ tanking is retarded enough) for every fucking strategic structures your opponent own (counting fortizars that's a lot). XL structures can keep the TZ because their upfront cost is sufficient to explain why you can choose, not the others.
---
With your change you will force timers on weekend and not be able to do a lot during the week, which isn't that motivating.
---
Eh, you're casting the blame too widely on suicide ganking. It wasn't "the blocs" who were responsible for it. It was us. Or, more specifically, Miniluv. Don't mean to try and take personal credit for it with "us."
---
Yes however the point I was making was more a time as a limiting factor you would get a certain amount of skill points per hour every hour and that was it. There was a hard cap you could get in a 24-hour period.
---
With injectors a 24 hour old character can be sitting in a titan and millions kill points if the person has the money. Prior to injectors this would’ve taken literally years to obtain. 
---
That’s the point I was making
---
John Lander, not seagull
---
Seagull had the vision but couldn't get the devs to buy in.  John Lander was the guy who took charge after Incarna blew up and reversed course on greed is good. He listened to players.
---
Neither of which we want right now. Listening to the reeeetard nullbots is going to kill Eve, but listening to only small gang fliers is also going to kill Eve 
---
looks like it'll just die. thanks korea
---
Your flying to close to the sun again.
---
well ok but there no meaning to war either with that system, that make war easier ok for what ? if you don't need space why fight ? remove asset safety &lt;3  
---
i don't understand how your system can solve the TZ tanking, it make easier for big alliance right but smaller one can't alarm clock even sunday for the hull/armor timer  
---
for that CCP should add a way to "grind" the armor/hull timer   
---
1 shield down nothing change
---
2 shield down reduce the armor timer by 1hour, the vulnerability by 3H (21h vulnerable then)  
---
3 shield down reduce the armor timer by 2 hour vulnerability by 5h (19h vulnerable)...  
---
(and the structure keep this timer for the hull)  
---
unless the defender defend the shield timer, this way anyone determined can destroy any TZ tanked structure even if that take 1week or more  
---
i'm against structure alert aswell, big alliance can place some structures anywhere in the galaxy forget them here and still get an alert when someone RF them' that's stupid, you can't sneak behind ennemy line aswell because everytime you RF something there a discord ping
---
EZ. 
---
- Make structures go BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM after being in low power state for, say, 3 days. Asset safety can stay because it's true it would be shitty for AFK players to lose their stuff.
---
- CCP should create their S sized structures. Quickly deployed, quickly destroyed. Cheap, and with a maximum lifetime. Useful for sieges and offensives, but not an irremovable stain in space.
---
Yup. That's why there's *no direct reward for killmails* (i.e. no facwar style lp gain for a km from the opposing facttion). There's, say, 1.5b worth of loot in the dungeon. Total. Whoever gets it, gets it. You can come to an agreement with another party to split it, but you're always getting less isk/hr and isk/site off the agreement than if you simply blew them up and took all the loot yourself. 
---
This allows competition without violence, if you want to avoid a fight; but you're always in a "pvp scenario" in that it's one player versus another player for the prize, even if your method of winning the prize is just to have a faster ship.
---
[deleted]
---
And no damage caps
---
&gt; People have become risk-averse and lazy, conditioned to achieve whatever they want with minimal effort. As soon as it gets difficult, they start crying. This isn't just an EVE thing, you can observe this in all other types of games, both multiplayer and singleplayer. 
---
People have been complaining like this since Aristotle.
---
&gt;Everything has to be dumbed down, everything has to be easy - make something difficult, complex and/or challenging or even slightly time consuming that requires some actual effort and/or brain work and people will create a shitstorm rather than try to use the few brain cells they have left.
---
Except now we have entire genres that market themselves on difficulty and mechanical depth. Dark Souls and its spinoffs have been exceptionally popular. Milsim and PVP Milsim-Lite shooters are more active than ever. Even singleplayer RPGs have started to release DLCs that do literally nothing but make the game harder.
---
What happened to EVE isn't that the playerbase lost its appetite for difficult gameplay, it's that the gameplay offered to people who lived in null was dogshit under blackout.
---
Yeah, that + have the thing be like 30 rooms in a bizarro maze with randomized connections (think a huge deadspace site where the acceleration gates don't work the same direction both ways). 
---
You'd still have the *potential* for teamups; for example, "all goons run this site in an Omen with the Purity of the Throne skin, so you'll know each other" but it'd seriously mitigate the impact of teaming unless goons were like 50% of the people running these.
---
what
---
OK, dipshit.
---
I'm not upset that Blackout is gone. I'll be back in my Rorq this evening. I'm upset that CCP is so inept when it comes to changing EVE for the better.
---
Why a nullbear will want a "juicy km " ? 
---
Maybe the loot ( blue stuff from the t3 ) , but the risk/reward is not positive .
---
FFS... Remove local, make local only accessible for folks in a fleet where at least one guy is out in space in a ship with a "broadcast-module" online and running. Minimal fitting reqs for that thing, but gives a combat-timer each cycle and makes cloaking impossibru aaand requires an Omega-Toon. And the local chat that thing provides is hosted on that players machine. BAM! CCP out of all the trouble, can always blame that players machine. F all.  
---
And hunters can at least still hunt the "radio-guys".
---
Isn't he suggesting the mechanics to change that way? I don't think he is opposing nerfing citadels.
---
Alternately stated, small groups believe they are better at pvp when it's a random chance for the following:  
---
* They could not get into a big group.  
---
* They aren't socially inclined to get into a big group, so they don't like said big group.  
---
* The small group is an echo chamber and convinces themselves they are all above average.  
---
* They are indeed above average.
---
&gt; You addressed zero points there though. Where is the lie? 
---
What ?
---
&gt; You just asked me if I "ever scouted for a null fight." I answered that I did. Reading comprehension? 
---
I said an actual alliance fight, not the standard "Let's shit on something" null fleet, one with heavy tool usage and actual danger. There's a big difference in the required manpower and recent changes are just trying to make these kind of fight never happen again.
---
&gt; Literally never used "dirty krabs" but ok. Apparently pvp is the "dirty ugly side of eve." Why don't you play wow or something less pvp oriented rather than trying to shit up our game? 
---
That's litterally how it sounds when you speak about krabs. Read yourself again.
---
There is no dirty side of Eve, except maybe CODE permits because why not, you're just living in your fantasy that every other person here doesn't want to do anything with PVP and are just ruining YOUR game. 
---
See ? Stop feeling entitled, this is not your game, not you and your friends game, it's the game of everyone, and not everyone wants to play it like you.
---
probably not, I bet it would get reported for warping out of sites before the hunter could reach them and get a lot of botting reports for butthurt hunters...
---
"History will decide whose right." ~ Jet Sam
---
Caps should have never been able to fit cynos in the first place. I hope CCP never backs down from that concept, slightly increases the number of subcaps who can light it (excluding ceptors) and remove the industrial cyno for JFs which is a really retarded idea
---
This is sorta-true, but my point still stands; an *ideal* krab region would have no PvP, or even the potential for PvP, so you could full-afk max-multibox your mining/ratting setup endlessly.
---
Alternately they could add 50 % build time to all ships, 100 % to capitals, double all ships material resources and nuke 33 % of bounties radically changing the economy but almost instantly reducing inflation to a major degree.
---
I'm not saying you are wrong but "there are three kinds of lies; lies, damned lies, and statistics."
---
hmm i quit about a year ago and still know about every update, so there goes your hypothesis.  
---
i think you are probably confused as to why people really quit this game.
---
And maybe, this might be crazy, have some objectives you can achieve in the same day, when attacking enemies' system, not just everything protected by timers, which means nothing has to be defended immediately.
---
Remember when you had 1 station per system in sov null? Good times.  
---
I honestly think there should have been a limit of 1 large/x-large structure per system in sov null. No idea how you'd go about switching to that now though.
---
They need a product owner. Devs need to stop making business decisions.
---
Yeah not sure why people are overthinking this. It was said that it may not be permanent, CCP rolled it back and people are freaking out like this is something new.
---
No. It hasn't reliability worked in years
---
Even for structures, the majority of them are low power. I would be that a full 20% of all upwell structure are low power unfit raitaru that are only used to provide tether and free repair.
---
It's not only that. You need to pay a full sub to man those weapons while fighting and generally a single citadel doesn't pose a lot of danger to a small gang with a little RR.
---
I'd much prefer a service module to handle citadel weapons. It eats up fuel and uses weapons and ECM according to several different AI scripts (could even let players customize scripts).
---
When it runs out of fuel, defenses turn off. It would also give the Citadel line something more significant to be bonused for.
---
Next would be to revert the cyno changes and remove the need for LO to light a cyno.
---
it doesen't, but then again WHAT does?
---
exactly...
---
N O T H I N G... you can't vote with you wallet, because there is a critical mass of morons ready to gobble up anything CCP spew out. At least it's an attempt...
---
If this is truly the case, I'd rather they shut off the servers and turn out the lights.
---
then you have not been on the internet long enough...
---
While in theory you are correct there were not that many capital ready chars for sale. And very often they were months, if not years from being perfect or even fully T2 ready. You could see it at the high time of c5/6 farming and sentry carriers in null. Prices were several times higher for the same SP chars without cap readiness.
---
And to get them really useable you still had to wait and skill for months. Getting 20+ Rorq pilots off the bazaar would have been a nightmare
---
Nah bots killed FW. Spent all day getting a system to 80% with my minmatar bros, brawling all day only to have it drop to 20% overnight by one stabby au tz bot. Mission runners impact on the WZ is minimal, its when they try to flip the other side to t5 that causes problems. If they would just remember large plexs exist next time they change stabs all would be well.
---
You're literally defending that other people's things, that don't affect you at all, should be free for anyone to destroy, breaking standard wardec/CONCORD mechanics in the process just because. Then you insult anyone who would be opposed to such a laughably broken suggestion.
---
Anyone with a brain could probably tell you it's pretty fucking stupid to make such suggestions, let alone defend them. Which is why i brought up the idea of ships not in use being destroyed; it is an equally stupid idea and of equal value as a "suggestion" for the game. 
---
Structures aren't perfect. Suggestions like this one do absolutely nothing to fix anything, they're just there for people to stroke their hateboner over and you seem quite happy to do so.
---
zKill needs to have the chat server added.
---
This is a non-tinfoil hat statement, so bear with me that it's not a shit post.  But here is my line of thought or question(s):   
---
*  Did their ability to detect bots radically increase from some new development?  
---
 * If so, was it tied into black out or not? 
---
 * If they did not recently improve their technical ability to detect bots and it was not tied to black out, then they should be able to continue with bot removal.  
---
 * If their technical ability to detect bots did not just radically improve, then how did they remove more bots in the last 2 months than the last 12 combined?  
---
Like, I want to know what they got out of this. Not because I want to prove a point, but because it would be genuinely nice to know if they are getting better at bot removal.
---
That's what Planetside 2 did for several years, and probably still is.  
---
They'd release this new gun in the game store that was absolutely broken, all the wallet warriors would buy it and the welfare warriors would whine and cry.
---
A month later, they'd release another broken gun and nerf the previous gun.
---
Shhh ccp broke local again..
---
Yeah I agree with you, the transition should be slow, and the barriers need to be removed slowly, any sudden drastic change will just spooky people out, but what I have been seeing recently is just people from one play style blaming people from the other and requesting immediate change. yes we all love our play style but the game must have a healthy balance of both. I'm all for a dangerous nullsec but right now as I said the transition should be slowly, people are so used to nullsec being safer than high sec that they just would not accept the change.
---
You said it negatively affected you and now it gone. The real issue is if you hang around people with a piss poor attitude then you'll probably have one too. If you believe they are so inept then why don't you start your own company... Oh wait you don't know what your talking about cause you clearly don't have the knowledge to make a game that has been alive as long as wow. 
---
Maybe we can use your salty tears to power a turbine for some energy then at least you can help out with the gobal warming crisis since you don't know how to make a game.
---
I'M NOT KITING, I'M BRAWLING AT RANGE
---
Yeah. I don’t see that management style going away. It works too well and there are a business after all.
---
anchor a bubble take what 1min? how long you think a prey warp off when neutral enter the system ?   
---
and of course you need to know where he gonna warp off   
---
stfu krab
---
What about no-power citadels can get taken by anyone?
---
Can't have an MMO without some in-house communications lol.
---
You do realize that Eve Onion is a joke website right?
---
It's a start. Active citadels still need tweaks, though.
---
As someone who liked the general idea of the blackout, this is a pretty reasonable view. The neglect aimed towards pve content has a lot of knock on effects that are often ignored.
---
Well, thought I made it clear. I have no issues with multiboxing per se. I have issue with dumb gameplay which leaves enough time to control 2nd+ windows.
---
That said, I can easily see newbies deciding against playing EVE once they realize that they will never be as competitive with their 1 account compared to someone with 10 accounts.
---
What you really said with just one word:
---
&gt; I came here to show I'm a dick with only one word.
---
That and allow everyone to see how much time is left with the current fuel, especially in ECs.
---
Here's an idea.
---
Add a local delay. While your gate cloak is active you do not appear in local. You break gate cloak you appear in local.
---
I didn't even kill a single rat by accident during that entire event... Smh
---
Sure, but when your goal is to kill a citadel per new wardec mechanics, does it really matter?
---
1. You addressed none of the issues raised. Specifically " Oh boohoo it's so hard to have a citadel in every system, a cyno for a super cap blob to come save you, multiple structures to make your space safe and now local again to tell you the moment any of those naughty pvpers show up. So tough." You just replied with " Ah yes, the carebear argument where the guy you're talking to is probably a manchild incapable to undock in space unless there is a confirmed 0 possible danger in a 20 system radius. Real genius, easy way to discredit the guy. Well too bad it works only with your friends."  
---
2. Yes I've scouted in an "actual alliance fight."
---
3. How it sounds like to you isn't what I said. You would do better to read the words written rather than what you imagine. You said right now there is no "dirty side of Eve" and yet your last post literally stated " I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should." How can I have a conversation with someone that's now thrice forgotten what they themselves said only one post ago?
---
In short - game is very stagnant. Large power blocks are in perpetual positional war. Ni advancement is possible into any of the 2 major blocks' core territory. Roaming one of those big entities space is deadly.
---
CCP are try to save the game with sporadic, sudden changes that shake up the status quo a little bit.
---
Biggest problem is the citadels and sovereignty system, that are killing the game. Hopefully CCP are looking into that now.
---
Join a small PvP group that takes random, casual fights. If you join one of the 2 major blocks, you will be tied up in hours long grind fests under TiDi.
---
maybe they need more isk sinks on a corp and alliance level
---
It's always amusing when someone who has apparently spent no more than 30 minutes ratting decides to lecture on the proper way to do it.
---
&gt;Scram one of them, full neuts on it, put drones, overheat reps.
---
You forgot the part where you die before the drones reach the T3s, and your reps do jack shit.
---
&gt;That is if you fail to be aligned or light a cyno or have the other 20 people in system warp to you.
---
So, you apparently didn't hear about the cyno changes, and also don't can't understand just how mind-numbing ratting for hours is.
---
Also, those "20 other people" haven't quite figured out how to make warping to a random anom nearly instant, meaning they 1) arrive too late and 2) trickle in, feeding more and more kills to those T3s.
---
Yeah but your point is wrong on two fronts.
---
1. To inject skill pounts, they have to be extracted somewhere. They also are an so drain when you inject over a certain so level.
---
2. You could get a titan character instantly with the bazaar. I personally bought two of my 3 "main" characters off the bazaar before injectors because I was making money faster than my so was going up.
---
Asset safety is such a contentious issue. On the one hand, there's little incentive to knock over people's sand castles because the content sucks, you get nothing out of it, and there's no incentive to defend. On the other hand, there has to be some insurance that all of your stuff isn't going to disappear when you're not logged in, otherwise everyone will just stage out of NPC stations. 
---
The only solution I've heard that I kind of like is instead of paying the asset safety fee to NPCs, a defender would have to pay the fee to the players who pop the structure, like a retroactive bounty. No idea how to divvy up the money - based on damage percentage dealt would be my guess - but at least it gives some incentive to shoot structures, and a bit more incentive to defend when you know that your asset safety fees are directly funding your enemies war effort.
---
I asset safety should also be limited to the same system. That way you can't just asset safety all of your stuff 20 jumps out of the warzone, and it still offers a way for an attacker to effectively deadzone a defender's assets. If they want their stuff back they're going to have to online another citadel in the middle of a war zone, which generates another fight for both sides.
---
My 2 cents at least.
---
He's kinda right, they were announced a few weeks ago.
---
It's not only the cyno change by itself, or blackout by itself, it's a random bad decision by CCP taken right after another bad decision that got people leaving.
---
You do know that Hilmar actually has next to no say in the big change sin eve of right?  As CEO hes not in charge of that, he approves new projects, budgets and other things, issues dealing with eve is not actually his call, nor doe she fix them.  He does approve things like time lines and ideas form the EP.  
---
All the calls for Hilmar to be fired are quite stupid.  But meh.
---
I can't believe anyone is still giving CCP money. They are the ultimate scam artists.
---
There's an additional issue which comes into play:      EVE has, hands down, one of the best, most complex crafting systems of any MMO today.    This means that it is an excellent PVE platform for folks who are into that sort of thing.
---
&gt; I think CCP Hilmar and others are just nostalgic for what Eve was like  circa 2006, and they mistakenly think that they have the same kind of  player in Eve that they had then.  They are mistaken. 
---
Bingo!   CCP needs to come to terms with the reality that if they want EVE to survive they need PVEers more than they need PVPers.    PVEers are the beating heart of EVE.  PVPers are the symbiotic parasites.
---
Love it
---
R/atetheonion
---
If you need the whole system to be designed so you have your target in a plate when you warp so you can do "leet PVP" killing miners then you are playing EVE wrong
---
I dont think it's mainly about feeling safe. I for one dont care as much for pvp because to me there is no reason to do it, aside from helping my corp/alliance. There is nothing for me to take away from it, no isk, no rewards, nothing aside from a killmail and useless boasting rights on a site that really does nothing for EvE. 
---
CCP needs to give a reason to pvp, lock certain content behind it, as in certain ships/items can only be bought after a certain amount of kills (just a example, yeah people will farm alt's blah blah blah). As it stands a PVE player has absolutely no reason to PvP.
---
She had an affair with my now-ex best friend and ran off with him. Haven’t spoken to either of them since, washed my hands of the whole thing. I doubt she has stopped, but now she’s his problem, lol.
---
I still think that the counter to all that cap proliferation is a dedicated anti-cap subcap. Attack BC sized and tank, 3 high slot, 1 for a cap weapon, 1 for "siege-like" module, and a utility high, 3 each mids and lows (4/2 for caldari maybe?).
---
The siege-like module in t2 form would give the gun 40% of a t2 siege dread (asuming dread 4 and bc 5) and also act like a 2 minute infinite point scram on the ship operating it, it would be fueled with stront. Module cannot operate in high sec. Module would not apply the additional HAW bonus that siege module has.
---
Basically a suicide glass cannon with 3000-4000 dps (assuming 2 damage mods, faction ammo, t1 guns, and a t2 RoF rig) for a fit cost of around 250m.
---
Russian rmt paid mortgages matter!!!
---
These photos are a mix of mine and a friend. Idk his reddit acct, otherwise I would credit him
---
&gt;Not EVERY change can be catered to making the lives of krabs and miners easier.
---
I have to ask. When was the last patch that made krabs and miners lives easier?
---
Cyno, Blackout, VNI nerf, Fighter application nerf, NSA nerf, previous VNI nerf, reduction in anom spawn rate, excav size increase, mobile cyno inhib, I could keep going.
---
I think the only 2 in the last while has been the jump timer change and Citadels. (And while citadels are very powerful its a double edged as the benefits work both ways.)
---
Pretty
---
Do you understand how difficult it is to keep a permanent moving defense fleet up and running ? Umbrellas exists not only because capitals are overly good at it, it's also because it's way more convenient to use.
---
Standing cap fleet just has to jump to cyno, kill the red and jump back home. Standing subcapital either has to go to the system or get bridged there, and then come back.
---
Also using capitals doesn't require as much people actively defending, but it still require organization, FC rotations to prevent things going south because Snuffed or INIT dropped 200 dreads at you and actual setup.
---
And you can hardly use your umbrella to save a VNI, excepted if you're goon.
---
You cannot say you wish people were actually forced to play 24/7 actively to defend their space because sometimes a random gang shows up to kill subcap ratters.
---
You need two omega accounts, logging to accounts in at the same time is allowed in this game as long as they are both omega.
---
He jettisons the ore from the venture, then picks the can of ore up in the industrial. You can also do a similarly thing with the orca and porpoise, only no need to jet can as they have a fleet hanger. Orca or porpoise is much superior as it also gives boosts.
---
Why should it be profitable to rat in the most end game ship in the game?
---
&gt;No need to let the IP die the way SWG did with SWTOR the replacement which was far from a sandbox.
---
By the time SWTOR came out, SWG wasn't a sandbox anymore.  CU started killing that, and NGE finished the job.
---
We still need a hard cyno for capital and supercapital warfare, though. Either a special cyno ship or on faxes.
---
The blobs of gigantic coalitions. Not the random dude cloaky camping you I an Astero. Man up. 🙄
---
The problem is that CCP has stacked is ranks with players like Rise, Falcon, Fozzie etc who have been trying to force their small gang PVP playstyle down our throats for 7 years now and convinced Hilmar and the rest of the management that their playstyle is what everyone in the game really wants, even if the players themselves "don't realize it yet."
---
Everything from jump fatigue to the interceptor buff to foziesov shows this. Hell, when was the last time battleships - you know, the ships that were the ship-of-the-line across the  board for a decade- got any dev love?
---
No leader in Eve forced anyone to dock. Stop with the tinfoil hat bullshit or start providing actual proof of what you're saying.
---
Never not C. All the way down the Scantron
---
I used to think I needed a fresh reinstallation of Windows every year or so, but then I learned about the free version of Revo Uninstaller, all of my PC problems that I had previous solved with a nuke and pave could also be solved with a mini nuke and pave just for that application.
---
That is true, I quit nearly two years ago and still check up on /r/eve
---
But the effect is really hard on big fights. Not competent FC will ever try to drop a capital or supercapital wing on a paper bag cyno ship on a contested field.
---
One issue I don't like with your timer idea is wormholes would be utterly fucked by it.  
---
We already do not have asset safety. So now we can get evicted and lose all assets in a single 24 hour span.  It would drive more people out of w-space.
---
People love to cry and shit on high sec gankers, but I dare them to try and FC a gank fleet. One of the most difficult things to do in the game.
---
Cyno still needs to be changed back, k thx.
---
I can get behind that, forgetting to fuel shit happens.
---
So who's left are the timid and weak ? Yeah that's accurate
---
Just like any others.  If you want to plant your open keepstar and reinforce it to get around a hostile fort shield timer... go nuts.
---
Or a client that is unhappy with the product you changed with little notice and would like it changed back for the transactions to continue.
---
Whatever happened to him? Did he get fired? Did he decide to move on once he had righted the course? Or did CCPs supposedly oppressive-to-non-icelanders office environment drive him away?
---
CCP needs to turn the server off. It'll be fine
---
We'll just have to wait for October's Security Report.
---
Upboat because spud
---
Hi
---
I am from hard knocks.I will help you please contact my ingame account wacky willie to dicuss the defending of your wormhole .
---
I don't think it's actually all that contentious. A lot of people are asking for too much loss of safety, for example full wormhole style removal is probably not going to work. That said, we already have the old outposts as a model for a level of risk people will accept but which is also makes loss meaningful.
---
I would start by removing asset safety(and timers) from low power structures. If I abandon the structure, let it become a pinata.
---
For everything in nullsec I would just remove teleporting of assets. You can recover your assets by placing them in a new citadel in that system. I would also allow it to be recovered into a hostile citadel to allow for firesale. The outpost era trick of an attacking alliance dead-zoning assets could make a comeback by declaring the system as no citadels allowed for as long as they can enforce it.
---
This would place the risk of losing the citadel/system roughly in-line with outpost mechanics. The assets aren't really gone, but you can be locked out from them. The asset safety fees would create just enough extra pain to make abandoning citadels a bad idea. It's a level of risk which is meaningful and which we know is acceptable to the bulk of the player base. It leaves people fairly safe against someone coming in and bowling over their citadels, but doesn't protect against a losing a serious invasion.
---
And what were the bots doing... PvE. The PvE is what ruined FW because it meant PvP was worthless vs PvE. Or are you going to tell me that there would have still been the same bot problem if there was ZERO LP from FW PvE and only LP from FW PvP?
---
Walking in stations in a spaceship game is dumb. That is all
---
So entitled. God forbid for CCP to make a change that could nerf or affect my gameplay.
---
It's sad because the macroeconomy is unsustainable. People get blobbier, and the stuff they farm toward are such anti-content assets. You don't take a super out for a solo roam, to a random region, inside a wormhole, etc. In large fleets people are super averse of whelping them. It becomes helldunk or blueballs gameplay. The hunters get bored due to density and prolfieration. The farmers get bored due to the zombie anom farming pipeline ending up with ships that they never use. Everyone gets bored. The game stagnates. People leave. Eve dies.
---
You mean people would rather not go out in their myrms and domis and get trounced by bomber fleets at the slightest increase of index in their system for a pathetic 30-50m an hour? Imagine my shock.
---
To defend against the type of aggressor i mentioned, solo hunters attacking subcapital ratters, a handful of people are enough. And surely an coalition of tens of thousands of players should be able to organize that. Ansiblexes and titan bridges also vastly increase the reaction time of said response fleet. 
---
To defend capitals you can still use your umbrella, even with blackout. You just have to be more on point and there might be some risk involved if the attacker got something to counterdrop.
---
After all, no activity in an area of space called nullsec should be almost risk free.
---
I mean, the damage isn't even visible yet. They had subscription incentives recently and some players who cancelled their sub will be subscribed for months before their cancellation happens.
---
How do you die instantly in a 3 rep myrm? Yes if you have an absolute shit myrm fit that min maxes for greedy space shekels you are gonna have a problem. If you fit for combat you can win. But how the hell is a 70 mil battle cruiser expecting to trade with two Tech 3 cruisers that are worth about 1 bil each? You don't see your line of logic as a bit entitled?
---
"You don't know about the cyno changes!"
---
I do. It means we have to move slow ass recons through all your space (which you'll see now thanks to local) while you can simply undock one or have one cloaked up near you at all times.
---
Just face it. You're shit at anything other than pve. You cry if anything shoots your boat. Any change that makes the game risky is bad for you.
---
&gt; How it sounds like to you isn't what I said. You would do better to read the words written rather than what you imagine.

---
You're sure you don't have a comprehension issue ? Let me walk you through it :
---
&gt; **I'm not the one blaming the "dirty krabs" for everything, making a post on a topic we already have 45 other posts about in the last 24 hours, to show how much I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should.** 
---
Ok, read again now. You got it ? I was caricaturing you. Is it that difficult ?
---
&gt; You addressed none of the issues raised. Specifically " Oh boohoo it's so hard to have a citadel in every system, a cyno for a super cap blob to come save you, multiple structures to make your space safe and now local again to tell you the moment any of those naughty pvpers show up.

You just replied with " Ah yes, the carebear argument where the guy you're talking to is probably a manchild incapable to undock in space unless there is a confirmed 0 possible danger in a 20 system radius. Real genius, easy way to discredit the guy. Well too bad it works only with your friends." 
---
I just can't be bothered to even try to make arguments in response to sentence so badly written and made to make fun of people.
---
If you need arguments that go on your side of the debate, you can also check my posting history, I never said nullsec was not too safe, never said structure profileration is good.
---
I did say that I don't see any issue in having a supercapitalresponse to small gangs that try to kill people at range of an alliance staging. You roam on someone's turf, you don't get to choose what the response will be.
---
Cyno on rorquals in PANIC is retarded, though.
---
&gt; Yes I've scouted in an "actual alliance fight." 
---
Nice, so how many people were actually scouting with you for that fight ?
---
Hoping this is not the case but if it is that guy has some brass balls... he could have just flown the industrial out there ejected. Docked. Flew the venture out and just jetcaned and switch between ships to pick it up and move it out. If they are cheap (and a T1 indu and venture are) there is really not a ton of risk of some one coming along and jumping in the industrial and flying away.
---
"SHOULD BE FUN."
---
You're not wrong, but believing wormholers brigade reddit posts is absurd.
---
all right nullblocs, you win, how do I get 10 rorquals
---
Everybody knows the Bluetooth sucks your battery down.
---
Was cyno changes bad? Yes. But Dinos saw reduced numbers well before they were even announced.
---
fuck that, unsub
---
Korean piece of shit game can go die, imagine supporting botters over content creators
---
Hello sir
---
That wh stuff was fun man. Wish we could have done more of it.
---
Didn't really mean to imply that. Mostly meant to imply that any small group can easily manipulate a subreddit this small. Even 2-3 people with VPNs and alts is more than enough.
---
I really like the idea of no asset safety for low power structures.
---
I'm just going to assume that you've been pitching these changes to CCP since they announced citadels and they've just basically ignored the CSM. Either way, keep up the good work.
---
I have no problem with citadel spam, its a sandbox.  Take away damage cap and fix the timers.
---
omg... LOOK YOU RETARD

"I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should."
---
Your OWN quote. You referred to parts of eve as "dirty." I never did.
---
You literally aren't capable of having a conversation.
---
Exactly - the type of PVP that blackout gave an advantage too is inherently not fun. The first days was great - lots of brawls and fun fights. It quickly turned into just a bunch of cloaked crap waiting.
---
Change reinforcement to an active module, kind of like the assault cruiser damage controls. Also instead of making the structure completely invul make the reinforcement buff resists to maybe 95% or something. Module would be fueled by stront from a fuel bay.
---
This would mean two things. a) Someone that can control the citadel would have to be present to activate the reinforcement and b) if the attackers wanted to keep bashing the structure for however long it would take to kill it with the high resists, they could.
---
The CSM was against most of the changes you dislike.  For example, those evil Goon CSMs told CCP just how exploitable Rorqs and Citadels are.  CCP charged ahead, and Goons did what they warned CCP they'd do.
---
And we reached a point where those little guys couldn't compete....just like those evil Goon CSMs warned CCP.
---
It's odd to blame the CSM for CCP's blindness.
---
Six players with one account each is more valuable than one player with six accounts.
---
It lowers the barrier to entry, and it's much more interactive.
---
One player with six accounts drives off other players.  Six players with one account each draws in other players.
---
&gt;Even when highlighting the actual issue, all you see is injectors. The state of null is only because of injectors, caps and their use is perfectly balanced if not for injectors. No changes are needed, just injectors removed. It's like you're on a religious crusade.
---
Massive misrepresentation. If people are injecting capitals, they are injecting capitals. This is causing a lot of capitals.
---
&gt;Obviously no capitals or capital pilots existed before injectors were introduced. And people have been unable to gain SP in the standard way since so nobody has trained into capitals over the past 3-4 years without injectors. Clearly, all the capitals ever were because of injectors.
---
Are you saying that, pre-injectors, it was possible to instantly create a new toon capable of flying a capital?
---
&gt;As i stated before, caps and the umbrella they provided was an issue before injectors existed. It has gotten worse, in large part thanks to injectors, yes. But they weren't the only thing and removing them now isn't going to magically revert things and make the problems that were already there before go away.
---
Should the instant influx not be stopped?
---
&gt;Why do you "have to"? Injectors have been a tool in an existing problem. You don't fix problems by ignoring them and going after the tool. 
---
Because they are making the cap problem worse. If things were prefect, other issues independent of injectors would also be addressed, but in this case, the "tool" is basically the root cause. 
---
&gt;Turning it off now just makes the people who are printing ISK now continue printing isk, flip the bird to anyone else who didn't get in on it before and let all the problems fester rather than fix them.
---
It would not be turned off. It would be less fungible. Frigate 5 could not translate into, for example, Marauders 5 becuse they would be different "tiers". Caps and their support skills would not be injectable, and there would be a cap on the amount of injectable SP (say 25m). The true intention was to help new players catch up, not help them reach parity. The reason the latter is not true is because progression is a primary mechanic in eve.
---
Agreed completely. 
---
Just not sure I can offer any idea on how to bring the battleship back to ship of the line status without making entire classes of ships worthless. 
---
Then again, they've super-neutered capitals in the past too. Though, with the number of capital pilots out there compared to then, that would probably be a bad move.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'm a regular lurker in BSB already :)

Missioners add NOTHING in FW. Most of the missions are being farmed. In Amarr/Min space, there's 1 dude (Ping/Aping/Payping) that has been farming both sides 8-12h a day, near 7 days a week with 3 bombers and 3 pullers for years. Every. Single. Day.
---

---
If that dude is not RMT'ing, he's the single most autistic fuck the game has ever known. He's not botting either just triple boxing for 60+ hour a week.
---
I'm aware of \*many\* non bots that farmed 100m + amarr LPs, a few are above 200m.
---
It's basically perpetually broken now. Glamourex made it fucking ridiculous.
---
i agree that we need some well thought out solutions, especially in regard to black out and its desire/undesired effects. your statement however is just angry ignorance and has little value. might want to include some hint of fact or tangible conversation. what a piss poor comment, you should be embarrassed xD

Our group Intergalactic Space Hobos may be able to offer you assistance. Please contact MasterGlorfy or Drake Arson in game to discuss.
---
Since we're homeless we offer unbeatable bottom of the burn barrel prices to throw your enemies straight into the dumpster. We can even offer daily patrols to protect your gentrification efforts and ensure the ruffians stay out of your hole.
---
I look forward to your business.

---
&gt;To defend capitals you can still use your umbrella, even with blackout. You just have to be more on point and there might be some risk involved if the attacker got something to counterdrop.
---
It already is, blackout or not.
---
&gt; To defend against the type of aggressor i mentioned, solo hunters attacking subcapital ratters, a handful of people are enough. And surely an coalition of tens of thousands of players should be able to organize that. Ansiblexes and titan bridges also vastly increase the reaction time of said response fleet. 
---
A subcapital will not live long enough to have people come and help if the people are more than 1 or 2 jumps away, even less.
---
&gt; After all, no activity in an area of space called nullsec should be almost risk free. 
---
On that we agree. Nullsec empire just have things in place to prevent some of this risk, and local is another. Local doesn't prevent wormholer to gank you, login traps, awox and others.
---
Is local too powerful a tool again roamers ? Probably so. But it is mostly because of the forewarning intel channels, which is something alliances implemented.
---
Local chat in system in not enough to save you most of the time unless you're perfectly 100% aware and fly a ship that can warp off before the inty lands.
---
&gt;There is no reason to engage in massive wars across the galaxy except for constructed reasons.
---
There are reasons.  Those reasons are not stronger than the terrible mechanics created by the combination of Citadels, Flex structures and Sov.
---
Can we get rid of tether on anything that's smaller than a fort and/or low powered?
---
Fortunately I'm spoiled enough from extracting my old, nullsec characters that I don't ever plan to do my own logistics again. I've got like 4-5b in hulls and mods (when I started I just bought every module I could ever imagine being on a frigate, though it turns out I have a lot of useless shit now, lol) sitting in each Rakapas and Egmar.
---
The only people who don't mind TZ tanked 2 week timer 500m raitarus are those who exclusively krab.
---
So, I'm asking for clarity here rather than make a snarky comment. Are you insinuating that every single play style in null that isn't cloaky blops hunters are ALL botters?
---
Have a fiddle in the launcher preferences. Had the same happening y'day on my client. Switched the WINE client to the CCP build and a few tries later it worked fine again.
---
Lol, your salt amuses me, especially since you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
---
I own a titan, 2 supers and more carriers and dreads than I care to count, and I'm all for neuting them, or at least implementing more hard counters.
---
This is very well put together and i think the point you make about PvE being the path is awesome. If PvE improved and more people went out there for the fun of doing it then thare are just more targets for those people that like to hunt. The instanced PvE that came with the triglavian stuff seems to be really bad for the game if you think about it from this angle as those people are not targets that hunters can really catch.
---
Do you think a lot did?
---
The damage was done with that extended run, I am sure a lot won't get the itch to come back until something meaningful happens
---
You guys taking on members?
---
WH life best life.
---
wifi too
---
You have no idea what you're taking about. Level 4 Faction warfare missions look them up
---
This. I don't care about "chaotic" changes...what I care about is that they only seem chaotic to us, but that CCP has meticulously planned out the changes and done their research to determine viability. It's blatantly obvious they haven't.
---
Instead of looking into statistics and figuring out what impact their changes will have, they just mess around to throw things into chaos. That's purely stupid and lazy development, and it deserves to be punished. People need to stop praising them for their ability to make hard decisions...they aren't hard if you have literally **no idea** what outcomes exist. A hard decision is something you do knowing what the outcome will be, but deciding that it'll be worth it in the end. In this case CCP has no concept of how their changes will affect the game, their platform, or the subscriptions. They just want to throw darts at the board and hope for the best.
---
Eh. Just sort by best and stop reading any comment below 1. I find that positive comments get upvoted more than negative comments.
---
This take is right only if you compartmentalize every player into one single group that also doesn't do anything else.
---
Each one of the types of people you mentioned is either connected to or part of multiple different groups. The warlords, anarchists, and marauders all need someone to carebear their ships into existence. The warlords, anarchists, and marauders all need a way to make isk to purchase the aformentioned carebeared into existence ships. PvP hasn't declined, it's just not as easy to find in the same way you found it before.
---
Everyone always wants everyone else to adapt to their adaptation, and since they're not doing it the way that they want them to, they cry to CCP to force them.
---
Only instead of the players being forced to change their own ways, they just quit. Change fucking sucks. Especially when each change amounts to nothing more than goalpost moving. No one likes to have played a single way, a way that they enjoy, a way that they have worked for years to attain, only to have it completely uprooted because they've figured out a way to minimize losses and people don't like it.
---
I don't understand why everyone is shocked that this is what the game has grown into. It makes me wonder who really has that nostalgic view of EVE. Is it Hilmar and crew, or is it the players?
---
EVE exists as a game that somehow still finds that fine balance between hardcore and casual, between being a game and being a job. Unfortunately though, shifts in either direction disrupt that balance and cause a mass exodus of people who are always searching for a reason to quit anyways, they just need a little help.
---
&gt; content creators
---
It never ceases to amuse me how wrong Eve players can be about who is creating the content, who is the content, and who is just leeching content.
---
i want to be swarmed by fleet of warping ships.
---
When you traded them your account, you'll have had to enter the name of the account you wanted to transfer the character to, the same account name they use to log in.
---
If all else fails, you could always try a reset password attempt on their account.  They'll get an email straight to their inbox about it, which might prompt them to log in and check nothing is missing.  At which point they'll coincidentally stumble upon a completely unrelated in-game mail from yourself asking to buy the character back.
---
I have a super and 4 cap alts and feel the same way. The issue is, if players that feel the same way are the majority or not. 
---
Even if we are the majority, if the minority that feels the opposite is large enough and/or loud enough, making the change can still hurt CCP. Which means we're probably more likely to see changes that are a gradual decline in capital power( either through nerfing caps or buffing subs), if we see that at all.
---
&gt;generally a single citadel doesn't pose a lot of danger to a small gang with a little RR.
---
Because the equivelent of 4 gridwide heavy neuts, massively overbonused paints, the ability to permajam up to 4 logi ships (on a small structure) isn't strong?
---
I don't care about either side of this bickering argument, but I'm of the firm belief if you use improper grammar and incorrect wording in your arguments that your arguments shouldn't be taken seriously.
---
Why should anyone believe if you don't know the difference between "your" and "you're" that you'd be able to determine complex business logic?
---
I don't really like the idea of removing functionality akin to forward staging poses when their removal should be (soon) and the promised-or-at-least-mentioned-as-desired upwell equivalent are nowhere to be seen.
---
Star Citizen
---
theres no real proof of anything you just stated
---
Yes they do. FACTION WARFARE
---
One sure fire way of never, ever, getting your idea implemented, post it in public. Companies have issues with rights of ownership etc
---
Aren't the myrmidons and mobile tractor units you hunt the real content creators though?
---
What's the name of your high sec static? Asking for my Merc friend.
---
For sure. I played SWG on and off till the server was shut off. SOE had absolutely no idea how to market or manage that game and they drove it straight into the ground. Mostly to cater to casuals who weren't planning on sticking around in the 1st place.
---
I keep seeing this, and I won’t contest that a single loss is a tragic loss of time spent. It sounds to me like reducing the loss but increasing the isk sink would be a more moderate solution. Where insurance on your ratting ships is higher, but insurance costs a substantial amount more. I’ve been thinking for a while now that maybe a revamped insurance system would be a solution to a lot of the averse behavior.
---
&gt;  imagine supporting botters over content creators
---
In w-space.  With a Statios.  Decloaked.
---
You, sir, have balls.
---
I wish they removed tether from every single structure once they put out the new staging POS (which presumably has tether). Then you have a replacement to park jump bridge titans/blops on that matches old bridging POS, and camping/fighting on structures becomes more relevant.
---
Well, it's hardly my fault that you don't properly qualify what you're saying. I can only work with what you give me.
---
&gt;But a 15 to 30 second delay would be balanced and the happy medium between no local and perfect local.
---
That would only really be an option if they started with this.
---
By jumping all the way to none, they'd still upset the hunter side by backtracking to 15s delay, and "it doesn't suck as much" is not all that good at bringing the pve side back.
---
Which is why I've been saying all through this ChAoS eRa crap that CCP needs a plan, not "throw things at the wall and see what happens".  
---
A plan (and actually listening to the CSM) that resulted in a "delay while gatecloaked" or similar would have probably not pissed off PVE much, while making PVP happier.
---
Eve isnt made for people that need artificial rewards to be bothered to attempt PvP.
---
Eve is a PvP game, thats really the only thing that makes it stand out.
---
Take the PvP out of Eve and the game is just a shitty waste of time.
---
If the current player base isnt interested in PvP anymore, the game will just die.
---
Structure spam is still an issue in wormholes. Have you not seen those wormholes with 50+ raitarus anchored with timers spanning all timezones of every day in a week. That costs about the same as a rigged fort - it's not expensive whatsoever yet forces the enemy to play 24/7 for a week.
---
Did you seriously reply twice to say the same thing in slightly different shades of nerd rage?
---
I can't upvote this enough!
---
So what happens if it turns out 90% of the current playerbase dont want to PvP and want to be save?
---
After all, CCP spend years making Eve harmless and cuddly, devoid of any danger.
---
Imagine being so salty that the blackout didn't do what pvpers claimed it did (in fact it did the opposite) and then in addition to salty reddit posts, you DDOS the game servers?
---
Yeah, tether moved to its own dedicated structure seems cool+good to me.
---
If it still has open access to everyone else the easiest option is to have someone else dock there and contract it to them from your Assets window. If you cannot do that you can flag your stuff for asset safety and it will be moved to that NPC station for a small fee. See the official eve article about asset safety below
---
[https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289365-Asset-Safety](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289365-Asset-Safety)
---
If whatever is left of PvP in Eve boils down to glorified duels, the game is done.
---
It has nothing to do with unsustainable macro-economics...it has to do with drastically altering how the game was played without offering a benefit to it. Let's be clear: I barely care about the blackout changes, but I **do** care that CCP seems to have no concept of what to do with this Chaos era. They didn't do research to determine viability or statistics, they didn't look at the playerbase to see what people were doing/expected, and they didn't dive deep enough to understand the **reasons** for why things are the way they are...they're implementing knee-jerk reactions and hoping to get statistics from it after-the-fact.
---
That's horrible development style, and horrible business style. In any system that people operate within, if you immensely increase risk without touching reward, people will be unhappy. You seem to be making the argument "Well they should just find other stuff to do in the game", but that's a short-sighted argument. There are tens of thousands of video games on the market...people aren't going to just "look for other things to do in **this** game", they're going to go find another game that gives them the thing they want to do.
---
EVE is an old game, and one that has pretty heavily defined itself, by now. If you push players into doing X, Y, or Z they're just going to find another game that does those things better. Any change that negatively affects a player experience but doesn't offer them **incentive** to keep playing, at this point, will fail.
---
Agree with the older playerbase with limited time. Many of us look at a fleet going out, and you know it will take at least 2hrs or more. That does not even take into account timezones or our own work/bedtime schedules. Fleets going out late or ones that you knew were going to drag on for hours for many are only doable on the weekends. Not many of us older players can do alarm clock ops, when our real alarm clock is going off a few hours after the op will end to call us to get ready for work. 
---
PVE vs PVP and income, even if you have plenty of isk from PVE, at some point you reach your goals, get mostly trained and buy whatever ships you wanted. And then what ? If they are just going to sit (i.e. titans / pvp supers), whats the point in having it ? If you hit that point where you won the game, and there is little to do anymore, people end up moving on. There's just a host of issues that all compound into the problems we have today. And really it is up to CCP to fix them, and not try to throw a cheap bandaid on it and call it good.
---
what faction BSes are weaker then their t1 counterparts?  Rattlesnakes are some of the most impressive ships in the game statwise.  The Nightmare, Bargehest, and Mach are comparable in throughput to their T1 counterparts while having bonuses that make them much more convenient ships that can fly.  The Vindicator is kind of a gimmick, as brawling tends to favor efficiency more then raw dps, but it can put out really impressive dps and doesn't have to worry about application as much.
---
people are toxic becuase ccp are killing something special to them.  Regardless of your opinions on blackout/cyno changes, the constant flip-flopping is going to do far more damage long AND short term than picking a vision and sticking with it.
---
I thought that was a second reply
---
they are lowsec missions you just assumed they are not fw so its your bad understanding
---
Chat? Or Windows? ¿Por que no los dos?
---
You can have all citadels or workarounds you want, zero intel reduce your chances to survive, and asking players to DDOS CCP servers by dscanning all the time isn't good for both the servers and player retention. We are not bots. Being aligned is an absolute minimum anyway, I wonder who don't do that. I hope no one in my corp at least.
---
As I said, the problem was the bad implementation. If CCP did the Blackout on BOTH sides, I think it would have been more accepted. Because people aren't stupid, they only realize that it was all for PVPers who still got their free intel tools, so they left instead of getting punished for no reasons. You can't ask a part of the people to HTFU and accept to be bullied like that.
---
The Citadel Proliferation is a problem mostly because they are tedious to destroy while easy to replace, it don't motivate to wage wars. Setting a limitation per system or making them easier to destroy is necessary.
---
But still, if they weren't citadels, it wouldn't make us unable to warp out. Being aligned to a safe is still possible and after arriving at said safe, log off. Next thing you will ask is to banish bookmarks ?
---
Rorquals, well... CCP released them, we told them they were too powerful from day one... It is not our fault, we use what we have been given. But I think that the main problem is that moons are too generous since Citadels than with the previous old POSes system, between 1.5x to 2x the old values according to my observations.
---
And the supercap umbrella is only a consequence of the Capital Profliferation which was made possible by... CCP since 2011. Nerfing the skill pre-requirement of capitals while still maintaining them at a small build price wasn't intelligent.
---
CCP need to act, but not without taking care of the feedback that they didn't care since 10 years.
---
iirc you would need API access for that individual or their corp. So i think the answer is no.
---
You clearly just want to be right, so go ahead and be right. You have my blessing.
---
This is a bad argument. The problem isn't Rorquals, it's just proliferation. Without Rorquals mining would be the only segment that doesn't have a "capital" ship, which doesn't make any level of sense.
---
And let's be clear: The problem is mostly relegated to Delve, when you look at the MER. That one segment mines more than pretty much the entire rest of the game combined. Create reasons for them to go other places or reasons to prevent having 15 in a single anom.
---
Nothing should be taken seriously it's a game. Plus I am only here to start fires. It doesn't really bother me what happens to the game. I just play with the cards I am dealt. Glad you have a superior complex regarding grammar. You somehow managed to become the biggest douche out of everyone. Cheers!
---
Something something fluid routers something something danger zone.
---
I really think they should exclude the market service from low/high sec.  There are ample NPC markets to use in both those areas.
---
You mean like stations used to have?
---
Why would you save subcap ratters? their ships are worth nothing, it's less hassle to just let them die and reimburse their lost ship.
---
Welp, time to unsub from this sub again. Only came back for the tears and to see if it would stick. Adios!
---
Its kinda hard to satisfy all, i am the last one to defend ccp - or whatever left of it - but from what i can see, if they keep shit as it is, people are bitching, if they try something new, people are bitchin and leaving eventually and as soon as they revert it back as it was before, people are bitchin calling them pussies.
---
The last thing i would want to, honestly, is working at CCP. This fact however is by no means justification for doin nothing at all for many years.
---
You can anchor citadels, have normal cyno range, and rewards are no bigger in npc null. Npc null is nothing like what he's described.
---
No sry, that's Star Citizen.
---
You can't DDOS servers by d-scanning.  
---
If you want CCP to do something with the code to delay zkill and dotlan that's fine by me. It's mostly irrelevant. Actually removing z kill helps hunters.
---
Never said it wasn't strong, I said it doesn't pose a lot of danger by itself. 
---
Running 4 ECM you have no point and thus won't kill anything. The point is furthermore on a cooldown which you need to align with your missiles' flight time.
---
And I don't know about your fit but 3 or 4 ECMs permarunning is a lot of capacitor..
---
You're assuming there is a plan.
---
Back in ye olde ancient MMO days, SOE panicked when they couldn't figure out how to get SWG's numbers to compete with WoW.  LucasArts and Sony were saying "You've got the Star Wars franchise, you should be doing closer to what they do!  Fix it!!!!"
---
The thing is, WoW's success was mostly random.  It's not like they had a particular magic in their gameplay.  It just happened to be the game everyone else was playing, and in a social environment like MMOs, that accounts for a ton.
---
So SOE stopped planning and started just changing things.  It culminated in the NGE, where they turned their sandbox game into a theme park game, 'cause WoW was a theme park and people would totally switch if SWG became one too!....and subscription numbers cratered.
---
It looks like CCP is doing the same thing.  They don't know how to get subscription numbers up, but are facing heavy pressure from above to get subscription numbers up.  So they stopped planning and started trying random shit.
---
It's not going to go better for CCP than it did for SOE.
---
Blackout didn't remove the ability for people to defend their space with standing fleets and gatecamps. The players simply dismiss this and insist on keeping local because it's easier. 
---
The same way that the cyno changes don't remove the ability to gate caps around your space, players just dismiss the idea of doing this because 'lol who gates caps'.
---
Bots are people too. Deserve a better life.
---
I mean, the actual devs apparently didn't expect it, so what does that say about THEIR game design skills?
---
I hope so!!
---
Have it be trig systems that we use repurposed tech to keep open, the "pirates" would be trig in nature and the unstable nature of trig space would disallow cyno's/structures/whatever. Hell you could even disallow caps in general, this would bring back the subcap only meta so many people desire and maybe, with a buff or two, create the battleship pvp meta ive seen people desiring.
---
I'd be willing to bet whichever Pearl Abyss clown proposed the CCP acquisition is on suicide watch at this point.  If he still has a job.
---
I was just about to type that when I looked down and saw what you wrote. Get out of my head please 😄.
---
People love to look at the past with rose colored glasses. Players havent changed, it's not like there were great "not at all risk averse" space warriors in the past and now suddenly everyone is krab shaped. 
---
Everyone was krab shaped from the get go (2003), the only things that have changed is ccp has stupidly added all kinds of more effective ways to make wealth, because they got stuck on the idea that they could "incentivise" people to be active.
---
Originally, ccp just handed us tools and said "have at it" and we figured it out for ourselves. The history of their game should have taught them that this was enough for greatness. Now they have developed themselves into a corner and dont know how to get out.
---
Don't forget the ingame map. Dotlan give more or less the same informations, just in a more practical way.
---
Sounds like a loss to me. Drones drop nothing and the only loot would be whatever the Astra holds.
---
Citadels do affect other players by virtue of existing. I get that you just want to be able to play sim city and spam citadels with no maintenance or defense required, but acting like we're the bad guys for thinking you should have to keep up with the fuel costs to prevent players from blowing up your structures is just straight up stupid.
---
Unfortunately your gonna end up quitting in about a month or so.
---
Read any of the top posts from the subreddit recently for the state of the game. CCP is clueless on what the playerbase wants and certain groups/bots unsubbing in droves. 
---
Probably more casual than when you played. especially regarding PvP.
---
This has been a problem for at least 5 years, probably longer but all of the malted hops and bong resin in my brain make it hard for me to remember that far back.
---
Funny part is they'd rather take the easy way out and flip a switch even if anyone with a brain can see the result will take MUCH more work to fix than just doing proper work in the first place.
---
Oh dear, oh dear, how dear. Your reading level must be under -9000.
---
The actual quote is :
---
Let's split that into part so you can understand it. 
---
Starting from some definition help cause I think you need it :
---
What's a comma, dear ? Here's Wikipedia definition :
---
&gt; **The comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly to separate parts of a** [**sentence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)) **such as** [**clauses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause)**, and items in list** 
---
The part after the second comma is : 
---
&gt; **to show how much I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should.** 
---
But what is coming before that part of the sentence, I wonder ?
---
&gt; **I'm not the one blaming the "dirty krabs" for everything**
---
That's the start of the sentence, before the first comma.
---
Now we take the rest ofthe actual quote :
---
&gt;**making a post on a topic we already have 45 other posts about in the last 24 hours**
---
Now if you actually had reading comprehension, you would read these sentences like this :
---
&gt;**I'm not the one blaming the "dirty krabs" for everything**  
---
&gt;**I'm not the one making a post on a topic we already have 45 other posts about in the last 24 hours,  to show how much I'm sad CCP cattered to this dirty, ugly side of Eve I don't want to ever get close and nobody should.** 
---
If after that much you still don't get it, I'm lost.
---
\&gt; dual-prop Nergals
---
it's *upvoting time*
---
I hate myself for even having the thought, but if they should bring anyone back, bring back CCP Greyscale.
---
Hey, it usually works when you messed up a driver install. Or when you bork your boot record.
---
&gt;who is just leeching content.  
---
The irony is astounding. Maybe stop raising these kind of people in the hundreds just to have mindless drones for your megablob.
---
They still frequently attack each others space but they have a no-structure agreement. A lot of the bomber fleets in delve are test and goons roam test space as frequent as anywhere else. They have also worked together strategically like for some of the keepstar timers in the North V South war in 2018 and in defense of the perimeter keepstar.
---
Imo nobody ever really wanted "total loss" as a common result of trying to undock and make some isk. Even hardcore PvPers usually don't risk "total loss" unless they only have 1 ship and all their isk went into it. 
---
Being able to take managed risks is an important part of the game, so there's nothing wrong with letting people manage their day-to-day risktaking. 
---
Eventually these same people use their isk to build 3 titans and jump them into a sovwar battle, and *that's* where the "risk of total loss" comes into play. But they shouldn't have to take that risk every single day just to play.
---
There's two big problems:
---
* PVE fits are garbage for PVP and vice versa
---
* PVE is tedious as fuck
---
Sadly that would require way more redevelopment than we're going to get from a 16 year old game
---
This is the thing a lot of people are missing. People make it seem like "Well if the guy has 10 Rorqs he's making billions a day!"...sure, but it still cost 80b+ to buy those Rorqs, and considering there's a good chance he's losing Excavs every once in awhile it's just going to add more. Even so, 10 Rorqs makes \~1.25b an hour, with perfect skills, which still means 64 hours of mining with all 10 to break even.
---
This thought that there shouldn't be some level of relative safety when you're out using a ship that will take you 40-80 hours to pay for is insane. If I play 10 hours a week it still takes me almost 7 weeks of playing to get back the money I spent on the thing.
---
Yes, he is
---
Maybe when CCP will proove that it won't be a decision taken between two beers, and so that they did include everything related to reduce the pressure of both sides (preys and hunters).
---
For exemple, if we remove the intel for the preys (Local), then remove it for the hunters too. Ingame map &amp; external tools still gave intel of where NPC are farmed or where it is populated etc. and so where hunters should go to kill some targets.
---
Also, they wanted to maybe raise the rewards in nullsec to compensate, if I have heard correctly ? Well, maybe do it AT THE SAME TIME, not TWO MONTHS AFTER...
---
In short, when they want to do that again, they will &gt; have to &lt; give us a complete presentation of their plan, and not release it before we give them a go.
---
Highwayyyyy to the Danger Zoneeeeeee
---
&gt; Eve isnt made for people that need artificial rewards to be bothered to attempt PvP.
---
If you are trying to get people into pvp they need a insentive to do it. Saying "it's a pvp game" isn't doing jack shit to convince people. There are other pvp focused mmos around.
---
&gt; Eve is a PvP game, thats really the only thing that makes it stand out.
---
As stated, there are other pvp games, Archeage being one of them and my all time favorite open world pvp game. The difference though is that AA gave you a reason to pvp. I worked towards my fucking kickass pvp mount. You also gained faction points to boast about. Not to mention you would pvp to make a map turn into war mode for trade reasons. Not to mention Wow and its grind, but once again it gave you a reason to pvp. 
---
Why would a pve player jump to pvp, with their point of view its just a wast less time to lose a ship and gain nothing. 
---
&gt; ake the PvP out of Eve and the game is just a shitty waste of time.
---
Take pvp out and you have a pve game. People will leave but there would also be a influx of players. Currently the most successful mmos out now mainly focus on pve and hardly on pvp. Not saying eve should do this but eve will not die lmao.
---
So once again, I'm going to circle back and echo ccp needs to give players a reason to pvp. Saying eve is a pvp game is not good enough.
---
Really, I remember when eve players were king of the nerds .... Has it really been broken that bad?
---
EXPECTING PEOPLE TO MINDLESSLY WELP INTO OVERWHELMING NUMBERS IS THE HEIGHT OF ENTITLED SPODBRAIN
---
thanks for clearing out that you are indeed wrong
---
I Rorq mined in Provi during blackout. No Excavators but didnt lose it.
---
&gt; Except now we have entire genres that market themselves on difficulty and mechanical depth.
---
It's still a niche and if you bother to check out those communities, you get plenty of bitching, even though the games were already advertized as such. 
---
I've been supporting kickstarter projects and early access games for a long time now. There have been a lot of games that started out complex and difficult and were later "tuned down" to a level that is more appealing to the mainstream casual gamer who wants to jump through a few slightly challenging virtual hoops that are easy and don't require much other than couch time.
---
Yes, there are game studios that want to provide a hardcore experience or a complex virtual world for a specific audience, but from my perspective, that's not the norm nor is it something the majority of players are seeking out.
---
Just take a look at various "discussions" (aka complaints) of any popular game. People bitching about "shitty balancing" or "op shit" or "needs nerf" or "needs buff" are always pushing for changes that allow *their* particular playstyle to become more enjoyable. The love a specific strategy, specific content or specific mechanics and they are constantly trying to get the upper hand because they feel their specific way of playing a game is the only legit one and thus they have the right to get what they demand - even if that destroys the gameplay experience for others. And sadly, in most cases devs cave because such people are always pretty vocal.
---
From where I'm standing, it's just like this in EVE and has been for quite some time now. You will have a hard time finding an "elite PvP player" who will ask for changes that aren't just beneficial for that specific playstyle or taking into account the impact such changes would have on the rest for the game.
---
It's not just that people want it easy, they want it more difficult for others. The argument is always balancing, but they always support imbalance so they can have the upper hand.
---
If you ask them how they think their suggestions would impact other EVE players, the tl;dr is pretty much "fuck those guys there is only one correct way to play the game" - which translates to "I want to dominate others with minimal effort while they should have a hard time defending themselves against me".
---
I'm sure there is more nuance to this - maybe I'm also wrong about all this. But after more than 25 years of gaming on different platforms and observing various communities I've been part of, this is the impression I get from the majority of players and their mostly self-centered attitude.
---
You can plug your ears and pretend that bot farms and afk myrm/domi farms are good for the game but when eve servers shut down all you can blame is yourself.

The rest of the info will be located in the above channels MOTD.
---
It already does this randomization a bit. Id rather give the attacker the ability to exactly set the timer +-1 hr from when the structure went into reinforcement. Also just fucking delete the primetime day. Set it to 1 day later for shield, 7 days for armor. 
---
Same with fucking ihub/tcu timers. Curently the capture nodes start to spawn at a completely random time during the next vulnerability time. Let the attacker set the time, within the defender's window
---
Then also have vulnerability times for structures scale with sov/adm index, and inversely if in hostile space. 
---
Then finally, go back to limiting to one structure per celestial. But still allow anchoring on the sun, because sun bases are dope. And get fucking citadels off of gate grids, holy shit.
---
FLAIR CHECKS OUT
---
Init f1 crab asks a predictable question
---
You can’t throw the 60 year olds out without an influx of young families to the sport. Nobody thinks it’s sustainable to cater to aging players, and nobody says a gradual transition is easy. Generation pass things on between each other all the time without major disruption. CCP has to find a way to make it possible, and I’m afraid the player base is not the right place to ask for help.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAjuEGoWCWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAjuEGoWCWk) except with robot voice.
---
I wouldnt do it. If a person finds your spot for running they can scout it out and engage you on exiting.
---
Anyone mentioned EA yet ?
---
5B PLEX IN ONE YEAR, CALLING IT NOW
---
Yes, that's also one I've suggested before. It should be nice and small, like tags rather than OPEs, I think. But it means if you wuss out and dock up as soon as someone hits local, at least they can loot your MTUs.
---
Given how easy logistics is, though, it would have a very limited effect on ISK generation. Groups would simply run a buyback (at 90%? so more ISK to the central group) and JF the loot out to LS to sell it, which is still almost risk free.
---
I would still give defenders a 7 day timer for armor. If its high power, active, and used, the defender deserves a week to mobilize a defense of thier staging citadel.
---
Just to give you some argument on the other side. I have a industrial character that has a citadel for invention and Manufacturing. I got the warning 48 low fuel yesterday and I did not refuel that until this morning. Everything was offline for 9 hours last night until I added fuel to online the structure.
---
In this case my structure was offline and I was using it just not for the nine hours or so that it was offline. It would suck to be sleeping and come to find out someone destroy that all in one day.
---
Citadels are the answer to POS code that's being removed, POS's did not have asset safety.
---
I have a ton of shit out there in citadels, if I'm inactive and I lose that shit because I was inactive then that is my own fault.
---
Whenever CCP announced citadels and asset safety was mentioned, something died within me.
---
I mean, CCP took away a major battle/content driver catalyst -&gt; Locking people away from their assets.
---
Where did we see this happen again? BR-5RB.
---
What a low IQ cope. "mUh CoMmA mEaNs yOu ArE WrOnG."
---
Learn how to make a functioning sentence if you're going to backtrack your claim.
---
&gt; The unwillingness/inability to actually develop features/gameplay instead of blindly flipping switches is absolutely disgusting. CCP, I've always been with you, but you are making a fucking fool of yourselves.
---
Nah honestly they spent years developing features and most of them sucked. Taking a while to focus on balance is what they should have done years ago.
---
The current playerbase and their favored behaviors did not emerge in a vacuum. It emerged as a result of a series of decisions made by CCP. The problem is Farmville mode Eve is unsustainable, and it's not the most profitable way to design this game over the long term. If that's true, then another set of decisions can make another set of behavior emerge. Doesn't happen overnight, but can happen over the years.
---
For those crying about this, why don't you ask your CSM candidates what the fuck is going on? We voted them in, let's get something back for once.
---
Cranberry Sauce?
---
My first one. I will take it
---
1 month till hilmar is paid and gone
---
They offered excellent advice which I hope you decide to follow.
---
Funny as hell!
---
CCP: Eve is supposed to be dark and brutal ... unless you own a citadel.
---
Exactly that is something i heard a lot of complaints about. Subcaps dieing more often and getting obsolete due to blackout.
---
You should have at least a week to muster a final defense of a key staging citadel, regardless of the size of your structure or alliance.
---
And even that requires someone else to be willing to watch the bar fill up.
---
What a low IQ response. Learn how to read a sentence before claiming people said something they didn't.
---
And to be honest, if I was thinking exactly what you described, I wouldn't say it on /r/eve, best way to get helldunked to oblivion and et people insulting you 24/7.
---
But if you're not convinced by correct spelling and grammar because you're have the reading skills of a racoon, look at my posting history and see for yourself.
---
In the meantime I think you should stop embarassing yourself.
---
While taking a journey with some totally tubular mushrooms.
---
This is a very elaborate way to achieve a pretty simple goal. 
---
First thing that kind of rubs me the wrong way is:  removing the structure timer is kind of nonsensical, when you think about it. Do citadels no longer have hulls? (And how does a thing even exist without a hull?) Or if it does, then what kind of engineering screwup causes the hull to explode when the armor is gone? - Somebody at Upwell would need a good spanking for that one.
---
Second thing that bugs me is that I can't think of a worse way to *fix* citadels than throwing fozzie-sov into the mix. If killing a structure suddenly also required toasting, CCP might have to start supplying amphetamines with game time to counter the near lethal dozes of tedium required to complete a structure kill.
---
And it seems like there would be a far simpler solution: remove armor timers entirely (much like with gates and jammers) and force all structure timers to come out on weekends. That would essentially result in the same change you are asking for, with FAR less elaborate mechanical changes.
---
Truth hurts and is best delivered cold. Not my fault it’s insulting to you. HTFU buttercup or see your way out of this game.
---
&gt;the gobal warming crisis
---
Oh. You're trolling.
---
&gt; Take pvp out and you have a pve game.
---
Thats the dumbest thing I have read today.
---
No you cant take the PvP out of Eve to get a PvE game, thats like saying you can take the PvE out of WoW to get a PvP game.
---
You take the PvP out of Eve, you end up with a shitty game. This should be blatantly obvious to anybody as the game has lost a ton of players at the same time that it got increasingly save and stale.
---
People like you are the reason Eve isnt doing well. Pretending Eve can survive as a cuddly carebear game goes against any real world data from the last several years.
---
But keep pretending and you might just see Eve die for real.
---
you should probably learn the basics of how carrier ratting and rorqual mining work before you make this decision
---
The only way you're going to be multiboxing 3 carriers is if you're botting.
---
So, I'd say: 2 rorq, 1 fax, leave the other for your rescue cyno.
---
I feel like the root cause of 90% of citadels issues are that they're trying to cover too many things with the system. An Astrahus means something very different for a SovNull group compared to a very casual HS player and yet they're the same. 
---
I'd like to see CCP duplicate the citadels and lock them to regions of space (So you have a HS, LS, NS, WH variant of an Astrahus for example) before any kind of tweaking of values goes on. It'd give CCP the freedom to drastically mess with a citadel of a region without worrying about it completely breaking another region.
---
Your commentary, while lacking in originality or quality does bring you into the spot light. So, what about it? If they aren't hunting, are they a bot in your opinion?
---
&gt; However if you remove PvE the game collapses that very instant
---
Nobody's trying to remove PVE. What we're trying to remove is *risk free, lucrative* PVE - and surely it is better to make it risky but lucrative, rather than let it stay risk free and make it poorly paying?
---
&gt; PvP has never as long as Ive played this game been organic in any fashion. You engage a PvE ship which is ill equipped to PvP with superiour numbers and you somehow feel this is fair?
---
'Organic' doesn't mean 'fair'. It means unscripted, not organised in advance, and not predictable.
---
&gt; Very few I have come across actually want a fight, they just wanna kill your shit and then leave
---
Yes, but knowing that, you can bait them into a fight that they can lose. Although actually, a lot of small gang groups do actually want a fun fight - ever heard "always take the bait"?
---
&gt; If fairness had anything to do with the new NS roaming meta wouldnt be all cloaky ships right?
---
Hunters use cloakies or nano ships because otherwise you get blobbed in a gate camp. If sov holders brought a good fight to other types of doctrine then maybe that wouldn't be the case.
---
&gt; local has never been the issue
---
Local has always been an issue, although you are right that it is exacerbated by citadels (giving a safe warpout in every system). It's also got worse with social attitudes in the big blocs.
---
&gt; And not to mention that it renders capitals kinda useless
---
Are subcaps all useless because they can't instantly teleport 10 systems away? No, they are not. Cyno nerfs are necessary, and although I wouldn't have picked the ones CCP did, we're back to people having a sense of entitlement to do something which would be clearly an OP bad suggestion if it wasn't in the game and someone came up with it.
---
&gt; But how about we begin by changing the biggest issues that impact the most people first?
---
Cynos are a big issue for anyone trying to PVP in null, because you can never tell whether one ship will suddenly become 10 capitals. Local is a big issue for anyone trying to PVP in null, because any targets will be docked up before you can find them (unless they're actually AFK in which case you aren't going to get a fun fight, just a cheap gank).
---
Unless you own 27 citadels per square AU, you mean ?
---
Nah, being able to only anchor one structure per celestial, and only on the celestial grid is important. It means you cant just clump them all together, and it means you cant do the dumb offensive citadel shit on the same grid as the enemy.
---
The only benefit i have seen is putting a huge industrial complex together in a line so you can easily haul minerals and shit with the undocks all aligned together.
---
Oh right well... Seemed like a good idea
---
They are now king of reeeee.
---
Yeah I agree!
---
Higher sec then high sec, yea i wish i had a fuck you fleet that would wipe out anyone that touched you (CONDCORD). higher sec then high sec huh....so people dont sleep always reliable cool. oh shit whats that? a dread bomb? a 100man kiki/bomber/fuck you fleet?  lmao higher sec. so where do you live high low or wh?
---
A couple things:
---
Be careful on your move to null. Announcing it makes you a prime candidate for scamming. Any requests for deposits or funds to move your stuff/process your application is 100% a scam. Real null groups want more players and aren't going to make you pay any money to join. What they will do is thoroughly look at all of your transaction/contract history to make sure you aren't a spy.
---
Generally speaking isk income wise 1-2 Rorq &lt; carrier ratting &lt; 3-4 rorqs &lt; supercarrier ratting &lt; 4+ rorqs. Rorquals have the added benefit of needing less inputs/adjustments made over time, also with recent changes to the way cynos work you wouldn't want all of your accounts tied up (if you're going 4 accounts you would want 3 rorqs and a force recon cyno). 
---
Downside of using rorquals is that it doesn't really translate well into pvp content as well as carrier ratting. 
---
Eventually i would recommend going into both, ratting all day sucks and rorqual mining all day sucks. Swapping when you get bored sucks less.
---
Someone else was trying to make this argument before, but it doesn't make sense.
---
Let's imagine I'm a botter and I have the capacity to run a 100 account bot farm. So I set up 100 accounts farming null to maximise my income. When null is changed so that isn't possible, and I have to move to high sec, why would I suddenly have the capacity to run 200 accounts? And if I have the capacity to run 200 why wasn't I doing so before?
---
This is a ludicrous argument which ends up in a logical conclusion that you shouldn't even try to reduce botters' income because "they'll just make more hurr".
---
In an interview CCP falcon said the following on the moment CCP Developers re-enabled Local Chat in null security space.
---
&gt; We knew Eve would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-legged form and says, “Now, I am become Krab, the destroyer of Eve.” I suppose we all thought that one way or another.
---
Age of Chaos -  CCP HQ
---
Age of Inconvenience - Players
---
It's not a ludicrous argument. This stuff is RMT - it's all designed for RMT. If they need 200 accounts to make a profit, they'll invest in the resources to do it. It's infinitely scalable.
---
The problem is how many people view PvP. I keep seeing the argument made that PvP is useless because there is no monetary gain and it just disrupts other people’s play style. That’s because you’re looking at the issue with blinders on. What you attribute to being “PvP” is either killing bots, or killing ratters, or F1 monkeying. I personally don’t consider this PvP, and I’m sure most ACTUAL “PvPers” do not either. Killing those targets is bland and boring as hell, exactly like you say, with no reward besides a silly killmail.
---
ACTUAL PvP which is rewarding is putting yourself and a handful up to 20-30 of your teammates against a handful up to 20-30 other dudes in somewhat similarly classed ships, and trying to beat them. There’s not usually a monetary reward, but the feeling when you triumph over another group ESPECIALLY when they outnumber or have more bling ships/comps than you is awesome. 
---
The organization and communication is crazy cool when both sides have a couple ewar, a very strong logi wing, and neither side can F1 the enemy. It becomes less a F1 race and more of a team slog as you try to break the enemy. You get this cool rush of adrenaline, especially in T2 and T3 fights with 5-10 bil in cruisers on the field. There is a very real sense of risk, and you don’t typically just “lose” your ship because the enemy FC saw your name first. It’s usually a loss because (**)you fucked up somehow(**).
---
Reddit, keep being you! Continue to foster that crying gets your way. What great times we live in. Praying for meteors.

Why are you uncloaked though?

Carrier ratting does not scale.

Nah on our forums people are somewhat pro delete local/ or delay it , meanwhile the cyno changes were pretty much unanimously reproved.

Rorqual easier to micromanage and a cyno alt or 2.

Fuck all the krab faggots. Delete the fucking Rorqual from the damn game.

The Rorquals were a mining ship for a long time before they were reworked into asteroid munchers on steroids. They were a mining boosting ship, that could boost more than the Orca. It was mostly meh, underpowered for the price since it took so long before you recouped the costs. Once CCP removed off-grids boosts and reworked them to on-grid boosts, that's when they reworked the Rorq to its current incarnation. In a world where they weren't reworked (or kept to their boosting abilities, which needed a buff), it would make the Hulk the main mining ship and you'd have your capital ship for mining -&gt; the Rorq, which only boosts. Eve would be in a much better shape if that was the case. You could have as many hulk pilots as you do rorqs (heck, through Rorq boosts, it would probably be good even if you get 80% of the current Rorq's mining capacity), but you'd actually be able to kill them.

I got friends who ratted under the blue umbrella, spinning rocks in overprop'd VNIs and gathering low-ish ticks with regularity while intel out of game tools like Near2 made sure they never reallly had to pay attention. I can't really stand it but I can sort of see the attraction for some.
---
And now we're gonna go back to a variation of that era. Perfect intel, out of game tools that may or may not be fed from rather dubiously EULA compliant sources and rorq fleet under the cap umbrella (this time with redundant recons.)
---
&gt; Very few of the nullsec PvE players are pure PvE and it's not about safety
---
I mean they literally stopped playing because the game stopped providing perfect safety, so I'm not sure about that.
---
I mean, first point if you don't use a bounce then you are an idiot anyway for that. So i guess now it is a bit harder to catch idiots, but probably not because they still lemming.   
---
Must admit i thought they had to be placed at 500km or so, didn't realise minimum distance was 200km. Not that a citadel is going to just be able to insta nuke stuff that is there, not hard to ping around grid to avoid it either (i know from gunning a fort once that the lock time was insanely frustrating, couldn't stop the small gang that was trying to gank a cyno from actually just all warping out without issue.   
---
I mean, ansiblexes are more akin to normal gates.   
---
TBH most of the rage with null is that CCP gave players what players wanted, namely ways to make their own empires. Now players complain about people doing what they have been crying out for, for a decade or more. IMO biggest problem game has had is injectors and how fast people can scale up things like rorqs. Beyond that supercap umbrellas just feel like a natural progression of people wanting to defend their own area. Does seem that there is a lot of noise from hunters who want easier kills on non PVP ships and anger that the response to them killing PVE ships is often over the top.
---
Personally I think blackout might’ve been a bit brutal for people, BUT fair. If you have the manpower regularly boasted about and want total intel everywhere, go put an alt scout on all the doors/pipelines you want intel on. Seems simple to me. 
---
It seems even more silly to want total safety in the most profitable region of space that is also supposed to be the most dangerous.
---
I think Bo Hunt wants you to know that carrier ratting does not scale.
---
I think a powered, manned citadel should be strong enough to discourage bullshit.  It should need support only when an organized fleet is brought against it.  Offline? Treat them like pos, max 1 day ref at hull.
---
"Prevent" never works, the reason so many are in delve is that you can kill a capital ship (Rorqual) with a fleet that cost less then 2 of its mining drones unless you have a massive umbrella. 
---
The risk/reward is totally screwed there, you "have" to have an umbrella or you are probably better off doing other things
---
If you want to come burn someone's space sandcastles, I think CCP should give you that chance without forcing you to ensure a week-long slog, even if nobody shows up to defend them. If you succeed, you should get something for it and the defenders should lose something they will miss. I don't think this is controversial.
---
Calm down, honey
---
I guess only CCP knows the truth. But it's what they said, anything else is heresay...
---
Wait it out. Things are likely about to be nerfed into oblivion. The rorqual may just turn back into what it used to be.
---
WHEN 500 PLEX = 3BIL ISK =&gt; CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION
---
BECAUSE INFLATION!
---
It's about the clutter. Ships functionally exist in a nether realm when they're docked up, not bothering anybody. But the briefest of jaunts though HS (the Amarr-Jita trade route, for example) will have tons and tons and tons of citadels cluttering up your overlay, overview, and D-scan. That's what Jarmen4u was talking about with "shared space". If a corp doesn't have the funds or the activity to drop a handful of fuel blocks into an Astra for over two weeks, then that Astra is basically space junk. It should either be unanchored for later use, or allowed to be destroyed by roaming cleanup crews.
---
I think a powered, manned citadel should be strong enough to discourage bullshit.  It should need support only when an organized fleet is brought against it.  Offline? Treat them like pos, max 1 day ref once.
---
go Dreads and drop on ratting dudes, loot them and be rich
---
&gt; Hell, when was the last time battleships - you know, the ships that were the ship-of-the-line across the board for a decade- got any dev love?
---
Probably before they completely invalidated them with capital ships that can jump around the cluster and are far more combat effective. Battleships aren't used because capitals are OP.
---
What you saying is that because you could at any point put nearly 3 moths worth of fuel into the structure but chose not to you can't be held responsible for that? I mean its your structure. You need to fuel it?
---
It was great fun. Thanks everybody!
---
&gt;Thats the dumbest thing I have read today.  
---
&gt;No you cant take the PvP out of Eve to get a PvE game, thats like saying you can take the PvE out of WoW to get a PvP game.
---
IT'S CALLED HISEC. When I joined EvE in 2007 I played in highsec for almost a year and had absolutely no problem with it. I also had absolutely no reason to do pvp because it achieved nothing in my eyes. I joined because I like space and the concept of spaceships. I did not care if EvE was marketed as a pvp game, I just wanted to fly ships.
---
&gt;People like you are the reason Eve isnt doing well. Pretending Eve can survive as a cuddly carebear game goes against any real world data from the last several years.  
---
&gt;But keep pretending and you might just see Eve die for real.
---
No it's fucking bitter vets like you who are trying to relive the past and preventing CCP from doing anything with your dam bickering. You guys only want updates in order to bring the past to present.
---
I am someone who is trying to return after 10 years. I can view the game from a different set of eye's unlike you. CCP needs to give a reason to PvP because currently there is none. For fuck sakes you have alliances complaining there is no reason to shoot each other.
---
Not to mention EvE needs those carebears because guess what, your not earning shit in pvp.
---
I still had APES-G local chat when I logged in the morning after SM3LL's birthday bash. I was in QLPX-J...
---
This ^^^
---
Add more stuff, gear inflation is needed in a game this old
---
I would be OK with this
---
Someone wasn't paying any attention last week to pings that super and titan ratting was forbidden for a full week following cyno changes. Every major alliance pinged that.
---
Are there ever Omega discounts (other than first time subscribing)?
---
You're asking for a dread. Use a dread. Dreads work.
---
1 timer for citadels and no timers for low power citadels
---
I strongly disagree with you, sir. This is exactly what they should've done, and more importantly, this is an indicator for a smarter, healthier CCP. 
---
&gt; **instead of blindly flipping switches**
---
They were not blindly flipping switches. Stop panicking, this was an experiment. The gaming industry has changed (note past-tense) and CCP is working hard to catch up. GAAS (Games As A Service ~ glorified subscription+micro-transaction model) are much more financially viable for developers and on typically healthier for the game (... and players. yes. ~ bring on your arguments, let's go). But they hinge entirely on experimenting and adapting the gameplay to keep things fresh which takes a lot of data-driven design choices. Other games guise these experiments as "Live-Ops", "Limited Time Modes", "Special Events", etc. They all have some cool thing but ultimately they are a cover for a deeper set of experiments. The recent best example of this is Fortnite with its Limited Time Modes. They were just glorified ways of safely experimenting with different mechanics (what happens when we give more higher quality loot ~ All Legendary Drops, or what could we do with mobility ~ Jet Pack Weekend, etc.).
---
These experiment need to be done in a Live setting because the data gained from betas and PTRs is firstly very small in sample size, but more importantly the people who participate in betas/PTRs does not translate to the general game populace, which for Eve, basically means that those who try things on Sisi are very not the same type of players on Tranq.
---
&gt; but you are making a fucking fool of yourselves.
---
This is good for CCP and for Eve. And for you too, sir. CCP started dabbling with this with their older limited time events that granted skins and cerebral boosters. Took a more serious stab at it with Resource Wars, and finally a real swing with the Trig Invasion (which is happening in waves, btw, so they can iterate and adapt and experiment more). This Blackout experiment is a really good sign from CCP. It means they are willing to start experimenting with some core gameplay mechanics that were previously thought to be sacred to an aging and stagnant player set.
---
&gt; I'm pretty pissed that it just ended abruptly with no iteration. Now we're back to square one.
---
It takes time to 're-anchor' your stats base. It typically takes a month for the player base to normalize after a significant change, and then you can get a month of good data to compare to pre-change. 66 days seems super reasonable for this. It was not a knee-jerk panic reaction to 'dropping sub counts'. Expect a new structure that does local chat functionality for the controlling nullsec block, etc.
---
Well if you gotta ask... Lol.
---
1 timer for citadels and no timers for low power citadels.
---
My prediction is different.  There will be only a slow decline in concurrent "players" but the decline in unique human beings behind a keyboard will be far more rapid.
---
The true decline will come the moment the response to "I got my titan!" becomes a yawn and a tired and sarcastic "isn't that cute?  Hurray for you."
---
WORD
---
Not true and proven every day. If you dont want to risk it then sure
---
It's contentious for the same reason blackout was. Those that are pro asset safety think it needs to be reduced some how but not removed out right. Those who want it removed bang the drum of only full removal and tell anyone who disagrees to go back to highsec. Amusingly anyone telling them to go back to wormholes is also met with scorn that they can't even take their own bile.
---
You finally see pro blackout people coming around to a middle ground that pve players kept championing the entire time of blackout, but that's only once their fun has been taken away.
---
So yes asset safety is extremely contentious because large numbers of players who would not be negatively affected want the maximum removal.
---
Not a great deal we can say, unfortunately. Any insight into CCP's motivation (other than anything obvious) is from NDAed discussion
---
The pretty vast majority of null players are crabs that will never freely join fleets without being forced or they know it will be a hell dunk where they can get easy kill and then go bak to crabbing fast.

If you just play solo or semi-solo, none of this would be an issue. If I ever join a corp, it's going to be one where we have no urgent need to help anyone. Just a way to pool resources, avoid the NPC corp tax, and occasionally group up.
---
r/eve is a bad representation of the state of the game like most things you only hear about the very good and very bad (mostly the very bad). I have been playing for a few years now and i'm having a lot of fun.
---
As a pvp focused person the biggest thing that has changed is the proliferation of capital ships. There are tons of titans and supercarriers now, owning one isn't that special anymore. Solo pvp and small gang pvp still exists but to a much smaller degree.
---
It seems like this puts us on the slippery slope to interesting AI for NPC pirates.

&gt; Ratting supers and rorqs take like 50-100h to return a good profit

What happened to "never undock something you can't afford to lose"?
---
Somehow I don't remember test saying the same thing when trying to evict simple farmers
---
Tristan Nerf kept them competitive while reducing their dominance
---
Why is there nothing here to reduce citadel spam in NPC null?
---
&gt; Citadels and other upwell structures should go into a "no power" mode. When this happens, the structure becomes capturable by players in the way other structures are captured
---
Not to come across as negative but this part of the idea isn't new even if you did think of it independently. I remember reading this suggested in almost exactly the way you suggest (taken over by NPCs after some period) almost 4 years ago before citadels were even released.

I'm just hoping that something by someone competent comes to take its place.
---
I remember when I first started playing eve that earth and beyond game sprung up shortly afterwards and what a total mess it was, I think it lasted maybe 6 months.
---
How do you go about this?  Do you declare war and then grind them down?  Only aim for low power structures?  From my reading your own corp needs structures as well, have their been any issues where the people you were attacking tried to counter bash?
---
It's something I have been interested in but couldnt figure out where to start.
---
You need to remember:  in wormholes there are no entosis games or any of that shit.  
---
You have a vulnerability window with some random + or - drift.  
---
Once through shield, you go to armor 24 hours later from the moment that last shield % is knocked off.  Then repeat for the final timer.  
---
There is also no asset safety. 
---
An unfueled station has a single reinforce. You go through shield and armor in one go, then 24 hours later final timer.
---
No one gate camps because they are just dodged with nullified and then bridged past.
---
do you have some recordings? i don't have sound ingame and refuse to turn it on:P. Can you really hear the voices?
---
don't bother unless you are looking for bot development practice because that's all that's left
---
What are you talking about Blackout was easy mode, I could explore nullsec cloaked with no one to bother me. It was quite lucrative.
---
If you’re looking for an unbiased answer of how the game is doing, Reddit is not the place to look. Everyone here is a cynical and just likes to reeee about the game. I would just say go play as an alpha and see for yourself.
---
I still had APES-G local chat when I logged in the morning after the SM3LL birthday bash. I was in QLPX-J...
---
...I said ejecting doesn't lose you SP, which is the case as of a little over a week ago.
---
The reply to me.saod that changed.
---
So you are saying it didn't change and my initial comment was true?
---
Look, I have documentary proof I was right that one time.  It was a fluke, a complete accident where the world momentarily intersected with my distorted vision of reality, but it happened.  Other than that, this video seems completely legit.
---
don't bother unless you want practice making and running botting software
---
Missions are still the main source of LP for upgrading systems.
---
Do you think systems would get upgraded off Plex income alone?
---
They can go to highsec.
---
Where safety is the name of the game.
---
That space exists.
---
only come back if you want to test botting software tbh everything else is gone
---
How does this work when the most outspoken CSM member was pro-blackout? Is this a "No true CSM" argument?
---
Ditto
---
Oh look. Adms are rising!
---
No err, this is not what I'm proposing. In the current system when you ref a structure it becomes low power, in my system the distinction would be between fueled structures (initial ref + second timer, no offlining anything) and unfueled ones (single timer and offline modules). Rereading what i wrote this point isn't very clear tbh,mb.

More posts about roleplaying pvp
---
There's a wallet warrior or farmer behind any kill of merit in this game. I don't see either as being particularly above the other.
---
People seem to like to write narratives, the weakest people identify with sides, looking for shelter. The players didn't change, the game was worse with blackout. Whole lot of role players pretending they're on a higher path of elite gameplay. 
---

Astriania you are a muckily user-centric Al Gore!

So all the people who cried when goons drop titans on them should also leave?
---
It really doesn't tho. Not unless the dude's a botter.
---
You're clearly missing the point. 
---
Local is a system provided by the game that straight up tells you answers about who is in your system. It takes no skill, no awareness, and no strategy. 
---
If I'm running a 30 man fleet, we can literally blind jump until we see someone in local. That's not hunting or looking for fights. That's just hamster clicking jump until you are TOLD someone is there. 
---
Without local, you have to actually FIND people. Things like cloaks and Force Recons become things you know you have to worry about. 
---
It's like in Wormhole space. Always assume someone is there. Hunt accordingly. 
---
Are you implying that people in Wormhole space don't PVP?
---
You're a risk adverse krab and instead of addressing issues you're discussing semantics and sophistry. Take your purple prose garbage out of here. My thread was overwhelmingly positive in terms of interaction. You're dumb and quite frankly I have no idea why you are still talking. Do you have any matter you wish to address or are you just patting yourself over hurt feelings? Answer for yourself not me. I don't care.

+1 pro blackout roleplay. -1 fucks to give
---
It's not how we get to where we want to be
---
That's odd, considering they pre announced local going away.
---
Set a long skill!  Patch day words to live by.
---
We are? Cyno changes, VNI changes, and Wormhole connection increase says otherwise.
---
my dude, you're an idiot. 
---
Why not give up timers altogether, i mean. If you can't muster a defense on the spot, just fuck right back off to the NPC structures, you pleb
---
I'm already stuck with a 1 year sub #NeverAgain
---
You guys are really overcomplicating things. Just go to the wormhole system:  
---
For fueled structures:  
---
Timer is set by owner, with a random drift of + or - a couple of hours.  
---
If reinforced during that timer 24 hours later it comes out into armor. 24 hours again after that timer is the hull timer.  
---
If you miss a timer, a week later you can try again.  
---
For unfueled structures:  
---
Same as above, but you only get the hull timer.  
---
What this means is in wormholes, as stands now, sieges only take a single weekend to chew through.  We don't have the week long slapfights that you see in null.   
---
I do agree with no tethering on unfurled citadel though.
---

" Tribute 2019 flared out of existence before it even began, the 2018 small war between PL/NC/SkillU/Frat vs. Legacy/CFC pretty much ended at UALX because of the realization of forces present. The last surprising campaign/world-shattering event was SkillU's destruction of the DRF in spring 2018, and before that it was the CO2 coup/backstab and Tri's retreat from Insmother. "  
---
hahaha, there was nothing world shattering about Skill U defeating drone lands.  Trust me most people barely noticed.
---
Too bad CCP doesn't have enough devs focused on “endgame” gameplay to implement it.
---
lol

---
They only want free kills. It is why they cry when people drop capitals on them.
---
Give isk rewards for PVP. Maybe apply a bounty payout system in Null/LS for each kill, the more lucrative for the larger ships destroyed. That way you can fund your PVP by PVPing. Make the payouts higher than ratting payouts.

just because you're a lazy pleb, doesn't mean everyone is the same, punk. Read up a bit and then come back and spew your blatant incompetence. Some, although that number is declining, actually play this game, unlike you glue sniffing bunch.
---

---
Slightly unethical evelife tip but I like it haha
---
I don't know about that, I see plenty of muninn fleets that don't mind fighting at close range.  The difference between being able to activate your ADC in 5 seconds and not being able to activate for over a minute is probably like 20+ muninn losses, pretty substantial for a fight.
---
I like the idea but this is way too complicated  honestly.
---
Just make low power structures have no timer everywhere. That’s all we need. No need to make a huge new mechanic for this. CCP loves to waste dev time on overcomplicating things but for real just delete timers for low power structures.
---
Yeah really good advice :)
---
or after going into no power mode the structure HP could just decay by something like 10% every 24 hours and eventually the structure goes poof on its own... lore wise, some containment feld is no longer being fed power so parts just drift away or some shit... no shields... micro meteorites etc...
---
I dont really think they "said" they will be loosing money as fuck ... I think, what actually happened is that some financial guy finaly realized how much money they lost over this period and said, ok guys stop being dumb and get those people back till it's not late.
---
Lack of communication from their side about ending blackout is one of the proofs
---
And I honestly don't think that those people which did not renew their subs will do it as soon as CCP thinks. I'm not planning to do so at least till the end of this year, then we'll see
---
Agreed. I do have to say the new low power mechanics to kill citadels aren't as cancerous as I thought they would be. But I imagine it's worse in null than WHs
---
Sounds like he ejected from his industrial ship and then mined with venture.

When you select a ship, a board ship icon appears in selected item window, if the ship has no pilot in it. Anyone can board that ship tho.

It nerfed caps but it didn't nerf the ability for blops to teleport an effectively infinite number of bombers on you. If the goal was to nerf caps it would have made sense to add a separate "capital cyno" that can only be fitted to those ships to allow caps to jump into. 
---
If you want subcap on subcap combat, you can't cripple the ability of one group of subcaps to get on field.
---
EDIT: Sorry for the multiposting, reddit’s having a fuckin brain aneurysm
---
Right??? 😂
---
I do have a serious case of hoof-n-mouth disease.
---
that's probably despair... people no longer see any future for the game and desperately try to save whatever is left of it...
---
If you have to ask on reddit why are you training a cap? Lol
---
So basically CCP created a lore reason for when they accidentally fuck up local
---
It's in the newbro section of Goon forums, shouldn't be an issue.
---
&gt; You mean like stations used to have?
---
It's roleplayers and those with a flair for the dramatic. Weak people eager to identify with a side and highroad. They'll scream bloody murder as they slap victim stickers on themselves and pray for saving.
---
Almost like it’s a game
---
Think you might be missing the point made.
---
Fucking what? Some odd projecting m8
---
They didn't have to announce it. If you waited long enough it would go away in a system you were in eventually because it never worked since the changes to the backend. That's why lots of tin foil hats, myself included, saw them shutting off local in null as a means of dealing with the broken chat system. It didn't work, subs went down, so might as well flip it back on and let it be broken everywhere.
---
Ohhhh that’s a good one
---
Ohhhh that’s a good one!
---
Oh I like this one
---
"pvpers"
---
I'll wager its because blackout was something planned months in advance, run through multiple times and weighted and measured.
---
The decision to end it was a snap decision when player numbers were viewed and there was palpable panic.
---
I swear to god im fucking done
---
Hell no. If you can't muster a defense in a few days, you won't have one in ten.
---
The toasting is only something you might want to do to make it faster to take down the designated capital structure. Everything else is significantly faster to die. 
---
What you call the timers (shield/armor/hull/magical fairy dust/etc) is a complete irrelevance to the mechanics of the situation, so is a funny thing to devote a paragraph to.
---
The proposal seems to attempt to retain the best of both worlds - structures are easier to kill, with non-capital low power structures having no timer, and fueled designed capital structures having 3 as current. Your simplified version loses that nuance entirely.
---
Nah, SWG was about as successful as every big name MMO before it and almost all of them after it.
---
WoW was an enormous outlier, but that was an unusual thing for WoW, not SWG being sub-standard.  WoW was just "good enough" and everyone you knew was playing it, and that latter part was a big deal in a social environment like MMOs.
---
who do you think buys the shit people "craft" you clown?
---
I thought blackout was a good idea... Not in it's current iteration, but a decent idea to mix things up. Maybe delayed local or being able to use a device to avoid local would be better ideas. People obviously got salty af about it and it split the players. Understandable. 
---
Now this... This is just stupid. 
---
It's obvious now that there was no point to blackout and this is simply a response to the player reaction. On one hand, it's great, they listened to you guys! On the other hand, they made zero progress and probably took a few steps back.

You're screeching hyperbole, not making an argument. "Oh, if I only get six days instead of twelve, well fuck it we're packing up and taking out balls back yo lowsec" isn't much of a rebuttal. Not sure if you're in a position to call anyone an idiot.

pve or pvp, what i mean is plexing or level 4s. Bots (id imagine its mostly active players due to the nature of the missions) can run level 4s all day and it doesnt impact the PVP. The problem is bots in plexs. Plexs are for PVP (in my honest opinion) and you get a little lp on the side. The problem as i see it is that botters can flip the warzone easier to cash in on lp gained from lv4s. CCP nerfed stabbs and ventures out the novice smalls and mediums, if they ever fixed the large plexs to discourage botting you would see active players having the advantage for control over the warzone. Or that is my dream for the future at least.
---
It gave people the opportunity to do a lot more but it just didnt happen for the most part.
---
The point imho is that until now every nerf and change tried to affect the supply of goods, and all have failed.
---
We had a disease and we tried to cure it reducing the symptoms, not the cause.
---
Let's work on the cause, on the demand of caps and supers.
---
Look at the titans and supers in past, there were many people who can afford them but they don't want them because they were a pain in the ass to manage and they were basically useless (except for taxi subcap fleets with bridge), and you were forced to block an extremely expensive toon into them.
---
Rorqual are extremely popular for the demand of caps and because they are easy to manage and build (another idea could be make them a T2 capital ship like JF).
---
YOU ALL HAVE MOBILE PHONES so you can chat in our new shit app RIGHT?
---
You’re not CSM anymore so you can’t make logical recommendations anymore!
---
It gave people the tools to do more but most people didnt make the most of it sadly.
---
Not true, some people can only play on specific days so removing the ability for a defender to choose the day hurts the 'little guy' big blocs seem so worried about.
---
Hopefully, local back means I need to resub another 10 accounts D=
---
Give it some time. It's not even weekend yet.
---
It's been less than a day calm down holy shit.
---
Its been less than 12 hours. Calm your tits.
---
Of course, you are forgetting wormholes and the ability of people to roll them until they get they answer they like. Given that, the idea of gate camping chokes as a legitimate tactic to defend your space has been dead a long time. Then there are bridges where people can just bypass your gate camp anyway as long as a single person has an alt capable of dropping a cyno/covert cyno behind the gate camp. 
---
Back in the day, say 2007 or 2008, when there were only a couple Titans, and neither BLOPS nor Wormholes were yet in the game, you would have had a valid point; however, welcome to EVE 2019.
---
Didn't take longer than that for REEEE PCU to start
---
&gt; done their research to determine viability. It's blatantly obvious they haven't.
---
Or that their expectation was wrong.
---
Maybe they expected some players leaving but that this was far more than they expected far quicker.
---
It doesn't take having zero plan and zero research to be wrong.
---
nor should it.
---
Moving more of the value from the ship to the modules fit to it is a more organic way of addressing this perhaps.
---
Pretty much all of this.
---
But it's mostly just different parties.
---
This sub is only the bitching party, whomever that may be at any time.
---
The people change, but the bitching remains.
---
CCP has no idea wtf they're doing atm. They're throwing massive changes around, and reversing them, with no actual plan. Probably best to see if it shakes out or how many people are still playing Sunken Cost Online in a while.
---
I like the idea of getting rid of prime time days but 6-10 days is way too long. There's no reason a defender needs that sort of time before having to defend.
---
As for asset safety, I get downvoted to hell whenever I suggest nerfs. People in safe sov null  can't bear the idea of losing stuff they have stored in destructible structures. It's like someone is taking away their bottle or crackpipe.
---
FYI, you posted like 20 times.

It actually means more chances of data/relic sites since you will have more wandering holes connecting to more systems with more data/relic sites.

I know I got really pissed after training into an avatar and spending months (about 10 months in my case) building it and ratting for isk to MOD it only to have it nerfed shortly after. It was a huge time and money sink for me. The frustration was severe.
---
Has it really been 3 months? Holy piss bucket it did not feel like that long.
---
Now this is a high quality shitpost.
---
CCP likes to advertise EVE as a sandbox - but it doesn't allow players to play the game they want to play. PvP gameplay is very different to PvE gameplay, and those that focus mainly on one or the other, have never particularly been compatible. So we shouldn't be surprised when the PvE player decides to quit after being ganked every day for a few weeks. Nor should we be surprised when the PvP player decides to leave after station-spinning for a few weeks. People want to be entertained and challenged, not made to feel like a failure for having the nerve to try and mine in an asteroid belt whilst watching Netflix. If your local restaurant spat in your food every night, you wouldn't keep going there would you?
---
I do think there's room for both styles of play to cohabit a game, however EVE might be proof that having those two games running alongside each other doesn't particularly work very well - after all, you don't find many chess players having a boxing match in their spare time.
---
_Nah, they just needed to fix the load problem of the chat servers XD
---
RIP the EVE Economy. It was fun while it lasted.
---
Someone in my corp told me this recently:
---
&gt;I took a break from EVE because I had a shitton of work to do. So in the evenings I only had time for like 1-1.5 hours of relaxing/gaming  
---
and I realized I had more fun in other games than EVE. 
---
Any time you see a big dip in player numbers due to a change, just reverting that change won't be good enough to bring all the players back. Because players will, in many cases, realize that the game just isn't that fun (when they take some time away from it).
---
Probably because it's been more like 2

The game never provided perfect safety. That's a strawman and you know it. Even in Delve *lots* of people died under the umbrella all the time pre-blackout. All the blackout + cyno changes did is stack the deck in the favor of the so called 'hunters' under the current cloaky meta that it because 1000x more difficult for sov holders to mitigate risk in their space. I.e. build and defend their sandcastles. So much so that the only people who could even try were the large blocs, and *even then.* 
---
You all act as if the *entire fucking idea* behind sov space and the alliance system wasn't to allow people to mitigate risk such that risk existed in proportion to the time and effort a sov holder put into defending their members and their space. Oh no, for you guys you had some sort of myth about null sec where any rando nano or cloaky gang should be able to waltz into a region controlled by 20k people, kill whatever they find, and get out safely 90% of the time.
---
It's easier to lose a customer than gain a customer.

As a pilot without a Corp. I've tried anchoring 3 structures in wormhole space and all 3 have been killed. 30b later I'm a broke man with no structure to call home. I don't think they're too cheap when they die before theyre even fit constantly and it takes me months to afford one... I can't wait to move my ships out of the POS but I can't until I get a fort anchored...
---
That being said I think your ideas are well thought out and reasonable for large corps in K-space. I really like your take on asset safety.
---
EVE players are great.

Reddit and EVE forum posters are horrid.

Just play the game and stay off the boards.

Plot twist; they never intended to remove local. It's been Brian'd the whole time.

Addendum:  to avoid turning on the citadel for a few hours then letting it run out and getting a week’s worth of immunity, the structure must be fueled and fully online for at least one week before a “low power” mode is active.  Without one week of being online, it goes straight to “no power”.
---
I agree. Wonder why they see fit to burn off as many as possible lol
---
Classic WoW is still going strong.  Give it another couple months.
---
Nah, absolutely fuck anything that puts a all-hands-on-dick armor timer for a big structure in the middle of the week, when the attacker got to hit it over the weekend. 
---
If you wanna hit a structure over two nights in the middle of the week to try and force that mid-week final timer, fine, but forcing a defender to stay up late on a weeknight while you just troll on weekends is not cool
---
\-CCP: "Youre right, anchoring Citadels is too hard."
---
\*Removes anchoring requirement from the structure.\*
---
\-Players: "Wait what?"
---
What are some of the top Eve discord chat channels? I’m a returning player looking to get back in the game.
---
Will donate 100 eve points.
---
Again, straw man. Do I really need to link goon losses from zkill in delve prior to the blackout to make you look dumb?
---
Citadels in 0.0 Need Offense and Defense tied to the IHUB. 
---
One thing that people hate right now is that taking any space means clearing out 200 citadels, low power or not - it takes a long time. 
---
I propose that Citadels as they are right now are fine as long as the corporation that owns it is in the alliance that also owns the ihub.       So if you own the IHUB, nothing changes.  If the IHUB dies.  Then it becomes Easier for enemies to put Citadels in that system, no more 7+ day timer.    
---
But if the invading force puts an ihub down and it lasts for the 7 days,  All citadels not in the alliance owning the IHUB get a debuff. This debuff increases with ADM of the system. 
---
i would also like the military index to be effected not only by ratting, but by killing of players.  If the Attackers have the IHUB and they kill the Defenders, they increase military index, If the defenders kill the Attackers it decreases the Military index.     Same with Ratting/mining. If attackers own the ihub and rat mine, it increases, if defenders rat/mine it decreases.  
---
Now before everyone freaks out i'm not married to these numbers at all, this is just a rough outline of my idea that citadels should be pretty useless in space you don't own the ihub in. 
---
level 1 adm, makes the DPS Cap 10% higher, it also nerfs resists, HP and RF timer by that amount as well.   Fuel Consumption increased by 25%
---
level 2 adm is 15% more for a total of 25% debuff   (fuel useage +25% for a total of 50% more)
---
Level 3 Adm, increases by 25% for a total of 50% debuff and it also nerfs raw damage and application of all weapon systems, including fighters and ewar systems.  (+100% fuel useage)
---
level 4 Increases another 25% for a total of 75% debuff,  Shield Reinforce is disabled.  (150% Fuel useage)
---
Level 5  Increases another 25% for 100% debuff, armor reinforce is disabled (+225% fuel usage) 
---
Level 6  Increase by 150% for a total of 250% debuff, All services, offensive and defensive fittings are offlined and fighters cannot be deployed.
---
shield has NO DAMAGE cap  
---
add strontium bay into structure   
---
if low power and no strontium -&gt; armor @ hull timer not apply and you can shoot down structure without damage cap  
---
if low power and strontium -&gt; 24h reinforce armor timer apply , after that you can shoot down structure without damage cap  
---
if full power and no strontium -&gt;  24h reinforce armor timer apply without damage cap and after next 24h structure timer without damage cap  
---
if full power and strontium -&gt;  24h reinforce armor timer apply with damage cap,  after 24h structure timer with damage cap    
---
.    
---
maybe each tether request can consume one strontium
---
How can something so wrong feel so right?
---
r/eve
---
I enjoy a small gang nano brawl much more than anything else in game.  If I can't have that, I enjoy a straight up gank where I melt the bad guy.  If I can't have that, then I enjoy an hour long armor slugfest in a wormhole.  And if I can't have that, I'll settle for null blob TiDi bullshit.  But the "they only want free kills" is tired and played out.  Most real PvPers want good fights where skill matters.
---
Dotlan light theme... Rip your eyeballs
---
Better idea do that for all citadels 
---
Also make it so u can shoot citadels in high sec with no war dec and no criminal timmer
---
Tips fedora
---
It does not work with the way the eve economy and gamebalance are right now. Why should you play very suboptimally if there is a way superiour playstyle where your ship is more survivable and makes more money per hour? While you can "metagame" the risk away (aka under the super umbrella eigher in bumfuck nowhere or in the blob). 
---
You also have to take plex prices into account, shiplosses and that humans aren´t 100% rational. 
---
Also you doubleposted
---
Make low power structures flimsy.
---
Join a Corp instead of asking questions on Reddit
---
This would go significantly better if you folks would bother trying to find out about the people you've decided to denigrate constantly.  Hint: It's about math and ROI, not "I must be safe!!!!"
---
'Cause you're completely wrong here, but understanding wouldn't give you the same feeling of superiority.
---
&gt;I understand that capital umbrellas were oppressive...
---
You can stop there. Capital umbrellas being oppressive was worse for this game compared to both local going away and cyno changes being implemented. 
---
Capital umbrellas begot mega rorqual mining which started a massive positive feedback loop. 
---
You want more content in your area? Stop dropping capitals on anything that moved and counter with a response fleet of subcaps. 
---
If you give good fights, more good fights will come your way.
---
&gt; did CCP just sacrifice 10000+ players on a failed experiment.
---
I hope not. But they let it run too long.
---
It takes about two months to build a habit, and blackout has convinced a lot of people to log out for three months. Some number of these people are just gone, the damage is done and will be permanent. I am confident that most of the players who left will return but they are out of the game now, not sitting waiting for the day blackout goes away. Players won't just instantly come back when the game, it will take time.
---
On top of blackout, we also have the cyno changes. The impact of these on player numbers is still an unknown.
---
The lesson for CCP here should be that chaos might make a good soundbite but when you drive players out with reckless changes, even when you roll the change back there is permanent damage left behind.
---
Your salt sustains me... Moar
---
Now it doesn't matter who liked blackout or hated it. The whole thing was stupid and pointless.
---
All this makes me think Eve just might be legitimately reaching the end of its product cycle.
---
&gt;CCP would have to redesign PVE in a way that isn't anti-content. 
---
What does that mean?     Not trolling; I don't understand how PVE can be anti-content when it IS content.
---
cyno changes were announced during blackout which will also cause some to not come back or wait to see what happens. If people arent enjoying the game they subscribed to, they will stop paying till its seems attractive again.
---
Upvoted &amp; looking forward to more from you.
---
Welcome to eve!
---
&gt; The irony is astounding. Maybe stop raising these kind of people in the hundreds just to have mindless drones for your megablob.
---
Case in point.
---
Except i mentioned you should be able to set the time it comes out, so it ought to happen in your primetime or thereabouts. It's not trolling if they show for a timer.
---
Stuctures take too damned long to kill. For me, it's really that simple.
---
Absolutely.
---
But people will always bring more toys if they can, no matter the fight, and the weakest folds. It is happening to everyone.
---
Well apparently CCP didn't agree with that viewpoint as they rolled back the blackout and players didnt agree with it as we had a massive dip in active numbers.  So is this were us pro-local people start sperging AdApT Or dIE back at you let pvpers?
---
This is the right answer.
---
&gt;Upvoted &amp; looking forward to more from you.  
---
&gt;Welcome to eve!
---
Thanks, it's my first week. I want to release an article every week like this. Hope you enjoyed it.
---
Well, first of all, null today is stale because there isn't enough change. Like every system it moves towards a state of equilibrium. And that state is rather boring. So null needs change if it wants to stay attractive, there is no way around it. This wasn't such a problem before, because Eve had two expansions per year that kept things somewhat fresh. But CCP moved to a more agile software development model, including its release schedule. Agile software development helps with managing risk, but it doesn't do such a good job in creating user excitement (an in most business cases you don't even want that, really). So, moving back to two expansions per year that change the meta might be an option. Or rather, just introduce change twice a year in null or in general. (I would actually be in favor of making Eve non-persistent and having server resets. Based on blackout feedback, that is obviously not such a great idea. It's probably 15 years too late for _that_ change.) Like, randomly(!) redistribute resources in null on a regional basis. Make the changes scoutable close to the date on which they will occur, so alliances can prepare for the shift. Delve may have good space for 6 month, but then it will be shit tier for the next 6 (or maybe not). The key here is, that those changes do not occur based on player behaviour (like, based on ratting/mining indices as others have suggested). Because if they do, they can be gamed. Random changes can not and can probably create a modes level of excitement and content (you probably want to keep red survey teams out of your space etc.). Ship balance can also be changed on a regular basis and on a similar time frame. Make some other boat FOTM. Nerf capitals for half a year. Then buff them again. But always communicate that those changes are only valid for a set time frame that is set in stone and that they _will_ change again soonish.
---
I'm not sure your point came across.
---
Try post it a few more times.
---
safest place to be :D
---
I think we can all agree that Bloodraider events rock! Wish we had them 2-3 times a year.
---
While Nullkids like to pretend nothing ever happens in HS except for mission runners and afk orca farmers, there are definitely HS organizations that fight each other and or pay mercs to fight for them. 
---
People go on and on about their precious nullsec spod, but you can get spod and mercx and other goodies from 0.5 moons too. Sometimes corps dont want to share.  Sometimes they want to burn down their neighbors barn and build their own in its place.
---
Trust is gone too. Why come back when CCP has proven they will change shit on a whim with no regard for the consequences?
---
If there was no missions and had all the LP come from PvP then there would be no reason to run the bots for making ISK in FW. With no over inflated LP making from missions that would mean that the PvP LP value would increase a lot as PvE LP is no longer pushing it down. My dream for FW is removal of PvE LP, removal of every system having plex and only having systems that are next to an enemy system having plexs spawn (if the system is next to enemy high sec then it can always be plexed too). That way you create a front line in the conflict, which also brings more PvPers together as it is a smaller area. Have a big payout for capturing a system so that people want to capture more, which leads to more PvP.   
---
The pipe dream would be that if you captured, as Gallente Militia, Tama system then that would trigger an FW incursion in Nourv. The Faction police/navy are removed from Nourv (concord still there though) and Gallente could then plex in Nourv to try and cap that. If they did then the next connected high sec systems would trigger FW incursions and so on. If Caldari managed to take Tama back before Nourv was taken then the FW incursion would end. If Caldari only managed to take Tama back AFTER Nourv was taken then Nourv (and any others connected systems already captured) would stay Gallente but could be captured back by Caldari, but no new high sec systems could be captured by Gallente until they had an unbroken "supply line" back to FW low sec that they controlled.
---
Roaming through test space seemed pretty empty to me.
---
The point I'm trying to make is that citadels are so cancerous, they're used as gate pings
---
horray i can run my gila bots in Omist again!
---
Ok, then "vastly less than they should have done". How's that?
---
Yes Eve 2019 the safe space for goon krabs who have convinced themselves they are elite pvp lovers.
---
negative on the salt, just pushing reality into ignorant minds :P
---
&gt;Eve is a PvP game, thats really the only thing that makes it stand out. Take the PvP out of Eve and the game is just a shitty waste of time.
---
Take the PVP out of EVE and you still have a viable game.    Take the PVE out of EVE and you have ... World of Tanked Spaceships.
---
EVE is not really a PVP game.   I don't care what the narrative has been; the objective fact of the matter is the vast majority of EVE players are PVE players (or fleet PVPers... which is essentially PVE.)   CCP has spent far more over the years on the PVE experience than on the PVP experience.
---
Sorry, bud, while you weren't looking CCP made EVE a PVE game.   And now that's what the player base wants.
---
wtf
---
&gt;The data will be bullshit, but better than nothing.
---
So kinda like flipping through the channels bored, finding a Steven Seagal movie on TBS or some shit and thinking, "eh I guess an unintentional comedy is okay..."?
---
Maybe if he wasn't specifically looking for suggestions that can be solo, then sure, but he is, so it's not. Plenty of people enjoying playing solo and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Championship best ship!
---
🏅
---
&gt;You take the PvP out of Eve, you end up with a shitty game. 
---
You really can't distinguish between personal opinion and objective fact?   Seriously?
---
Mine WH gas.
---
Which of those did local stop from happening? Why that once local was removed the most common thing became bombing excavators? Or the most popular ship was dscan immune recons? Speak what you like but the actions of the masses show pvpers are risk averse and want easy kills.
---
If they want to scream go some where else for not wanting your style of pvp then those players also need to leave when they get upset goons dropped 10 titans on them. Maybe goons want giant super fights.
---
&gt;That said, we already have the old outposts as a model for a level of risk people will accept but which is also makes loss meaningful.  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;For everything in nullsec I would just remove teleporting of assets
---
I don't think you quite understand what "asset safety" was really like back in the outpost days.
---
It was 100% safe.  And you got your stuff out by waiting a week or two, and then firesaling at a 10-20% loss or a public courier contract picked up by the new ower's logistics corps.
---
"Your stuff was locked away forever!!" is a persistent myth on r/Eve.  It was never true.  Aiming to "restore" this myth is not a good plan.
---
Indeed. Happy cake day!
---
Pve that is not easily bottable is a good solution, if that can ever be done. 
---
Endless anomalies is a problem. People on this sub reddit complain that wormhole farming is too much of a faucet, but it's pve that you have to pay attention to at least. You also have the potential for someone to roll into you and quickly have you tackled. And you're pmuch dead before you knew what happened. 
---
We need more content that is stimulating, high reward, high risk, but required attention.
---
Just because you're buying more Plex with isk does not mean there are more people buying Plex with real money to sell as isk. This is why there has been rampant inflation in the Plex market for so long: because demand was going up while supply either didn't change or was going down. It didn't strick you as odd that Plex prices took a dive during blackout? This is economics 101.
---
Player count before blackout: Very slow decline.
---
Player count during blackout: Ski slope.
---
Player count after blackout: ???
---
It is though... For krabs, nullsec is higher security than highsec. No miner ganking, no freighter bumping, no wardec faggots. Everyone in your space was friend. Any foe was hunted down.
---
In highsec, you never know which neural in system will come gank you next.
---
Which corp should i join if i dont really know what type of activity i like most cuz i didnt try yet most of the content in this game. Plus as i said in post i prefer solo gameplay even in such party-based game and i want to know is it possible to make decent isk/h solo
---
Whatever it was it was too short.
---
The first one means damn some people are richer than me, and I am rich as fuck.  The second one, vast majority of people are thank fully smart to not rat isk negative, that gives me hope that maybe eve does have smart people afterall. The third one is dangerous slope hopefully will stabilize. We don't need market stagnation
---
KITEY BULLSHIT NEEDS A LOT MORE SKILL THAN BRAWLING
---
If you limit it one per celestial and make sov scale the vulnerability timer, its easy to clean out structures later. 
---
Making armor timers that short means its easier to spam timers on a staging citadel and force fatigue on the defender to super form every 4 days to keep thier structure. 
---
Waiting a week to helicopter dick citadel spam isnt that big of a deal if they can be hit during your own primetime and if they die immediately from low power
---
Ehh, that issue is solved by proper IT infrastructure. 
---
The real issue is how AIDS it is to fuel structures. I have to dock, take control, and move fuel into the fuel bay and then release and undock to move to the next.
---
Citadels were meant to replace POS. Then CCP got ambitious and wanted to make them replace Outposts and even Stations.
---
Championship best killmail
---
Not sure what you mean by structures being capturable but I can't wait to see a rogue drone keepstar!
---
CCP is too lazy to actually do any real changes, that was the real force behind the chaos era. Switch off local, add fitting restrictions to cynos, neither of those required a significant amount of dev time. Initially they didn't even want to add the industrial cyno, and were just going to let JFs jump straight to a blops cyno.
---
My personal favorite is the start system names like “old man star” which unsurprisingly are EVE star systems
---
Run T4 abyss in a nice big 1.0 system until you want to gouge your own eyes out.
---
Olmeca, you will never 'fix' eve by turning off the thing it is famous for--emergent player built institutions--ability to mitigate risk for their line members. Why? Because then those emergent player built institutions become completely meaningless. 
---
You might be able to alter their ability to mitigate risk slightly, if you also *simultaneously* increase the rewards available to people slightly; however, even you should have realized that if CCP turned off the ability of alliances to collect intel (and don't give me that bullshit about 'go collect intell then,' because you know it is not that simple) AND made super umbrellas extremely difficult--so much so that sov holders suddenly were disadvantaged in their own space to any gang with cloaks--people were going to stop undocking. 
---
Then you should have also realized that once they stop undocking, they stop getting logging in, and then they stop getting on comms, then other people's friends go away so THEY stop logging in, etc, etc, etc. 
---
I think I have been over this with before too, but in addition that this, EVE has one of the oldest player bases of any MMO on market. If CCP purposefully increases the tedium in the game, most of the people who are make up the majority of the players--28 to 44 year olds--no longer have the time or the patience, and they will leave. Just take me as an example. When I started playing in 2006 I had all the time in the world to do tedious shit in this game, but now I have children and a job. 
---
Do you think I am going to keep paying for my jump freighter pilot with these new cyno mechanics? Not fucking likely.   Do you think I am going to pay for an alt army, log them all in, then check every system in within two jumps of my main before I start anomaly ratting? Not fucking likely. Do you think I am going to buy injectors and inject all of my cyno pilots into recons? Not fucking likely. 
---
It turns out, these days I have far better uses of my time and money. So you and CCP can change away and try and recapture EVE 2006 if you want. Great. I am just letting you know that I, and many other people, will not be along for the ride. The fallacy of sunk costs only buys CCP so much time.
---
We are coming up to halloween... probs then?
---
Thank you, perhaps you meant to link [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYO1nZFw6c) :D
---
That explains strange spike on old "Mirror" video.
---
It's not that PVEers want complete safety. We can accept a certain amount of risk comes with what we do. We face our attackers, do what we can to survive, and accept our losses, usually with a gf in local even though the fight was completely one sided.
---
What we couldn't accept was null being turned into a slaughterhouse. If you are inclined to attack PVEers, the blackout must have been like shooting fish in a barrel. You wouldn't sit for it, and we shouldn't be expected to either.
---
It even works in the lore of the upwell structures.
---
They are nano-grown objects and when in no power their hull degrades and the nano-matrix mcguffin becomes unstable or whatever.
---
It won't. 
---
A bigger amount of people who left because of the blackout will not come back. Fun was over for them.
---
A bigger amount of people who remained because of the blackout will stop playing. Fun is over for them.
---
For CCP the blackout was a lose-lose situation. They have lost faith and trust from both side of players.
---
You can expect less people and more bots, slow falling economy, and a more boring gameplay.
---
They took your advice..  they stopped undocking...  
---
There are risks and there are risks..   and people decided blackout without cynos was too much risk.
---
DED sites, ninja wh gas mining, exploration. If you are based out of lowsec low class wormhole ratting is also an option but i wouldn't rat in any holes connected to hisec.
---
Someone already pointed out it probably wasn’t blackout alone that drove the player numbers down, myself I got restless with all the changes this year, was willing to give blackout a go though.
---
It was the cyno changes that made me call it a day though, I’m fine with my caps not being able to light a cyno, but I was really looking forward to being able to jump my JF to covert cynos, unlike the wanna JF pilots that kicked up a stink around here my 3 cyno alts had cyno V
---
Unsubbed my 4 accounts, gave wow a try and loved it
---
The math doesn't change much on smaller ships.  The losses are smaller, but the isk/hr is also smaller.  Resulting in a similar \[many hours\] to make back the cost of the ship.
---
I got and easier fix.
---
DELETE.
---
Dinos just mad their supers keep getting waterboarded on cyno beacons while rorqs die.
---
&gt;go put an alt scout on all the doors/pipelines you want intel on.
---
What 4 hour shift would you like to sign up for?
---
And keep in mind you can't do anything else during these 4 hours.  You must only sit there watching a gate, 'cause you only have a very small window to see the cloaky between gatecloak and covops cloak.
---
It seems simple to you because the sentence is very simple to write.  Not because the technique is actually simple.
---
Just the two of us today as we deep dive with a masterclass on Drones, then discuss a basic overview of ship flying styles!

I think you didn't read my post completely, my proposed mechanics explicitly include being able to do what you just described specifically because that is how it worked under outposts. It's the difference between the loss being painful and the loss being catastrophic as a full removal of asset safety would entail.
---
&gt; It was never true.
---
There have been a number of times where outposts were successfully dead-zoned for significant periods. This is something that we have lost in the citadel era.
---
Isn’t that what the ceo is doing here?
---
Lol!!!  
---
Just about any even tone inclusive person would be nice about now.  
---
Troop out CCP Quant to talk about the numbers on why we need to do things.  
---
Bring out Seagull to make us all feel that we are on the right track on the Roadmap(tm) and she has the plan in hand. 
---
Fozzy to tell us how it is, but actually kind of understand that people may disagree even if these were the choices they came out with. Trust us...you will love it with time.

Almost anything other than the current HTFU and enjoy the ride.

KYS
---
&gt;it's very difficult to bait them out into actually fighting and losing ships
---
looks pretty easy tbh, that's what this post is actually about
---
Confirming that asset safety as a recently returning nullsec player sucks donkey balls compared to just fireselling your shit to the new owners of the stations that may have flipped. 
---
Asset safety being a necessity because "Muh players taking a break" argument is bollocks. So all your shit is in an Outpost? Great! There wasn't one in every system, and each were specialized, so it was likely they were all at least somewhat frequently used by whoever owned them before. 
---
Meaning making contracts to sell your shit at a x% off jita price was simple. Because no matter how much stuff you had, it was in someones safe space, and there is always market sharks looking for contracts to flip. 
---
Now, All my shit is spread across a dozen lowsec stations, had to pay ~15 billion isk to get it all back, and 75% of my shit that I just don't have the time to move is sitting on firesale contracts that no one wants to pick up because it's in fucking lowsec BFE.
---
Just join a corp, any corp. Stay with them for a while and if you don't like what they're doing, leave and find another corp. Corps will provide you support (information, isk, ships), memes and good times. Some people enjoy playing solo, but most people burn out of the game if they stay solo for too long.
---
If you remove ganking from EVE there is almost no PVP.
---
But they dont want to go to highsec, they want the game to be turned into highsec. Not literally, but they want it to be as save and cuddly.
---
Do you think people join the various donut blocks for the action?
---
Why should larger structures have more timers? They are meant to be deployed by larger entities and therefore have more people to actively defend them. Why would we reward a larger group anchoring a powerful structure with more power in the form of timers on top of the additional power of the larger structure?
---
More powerful stuff should require more maintainence and player skill to use not less. If anything small and mediums should get 1 timer and large/keepstars should have 0. I'd settle for everything having 1 24hr timer IF powered though. Unpowered should have 0 timers and twice the damage cap.
---
Nah it was broke before downtime this morning I sent in a bug report.

&gt; People on this sub reddit complain that wormhole farming is too much of a faucet, but it's pve that you have to pay attention to at least.

Let's not pretend this is the case now that the probe scanner issue is widely known. Wormholers don't just get an alarm that someone jumped in, they get an alarm when someone enters warp to the wormhole that leads to them.

---
Nobody wants to live their lives in chaos. They come to play a game to enjoy themselves after work and unwind for the most part. Creating chaos in their video game retreat is a terrible idea. Taking away the things that draw them in, taking away the tools they use to do what they find fun, for the most part it ends one way.
---
CCP should consider these things before dropping on a nuke on the next group of players in their crosshairs if they want eve to stay above the threshold of activity where we still see a purpose in logging in, whatever that threshold may be.
---
Hey nice, looking forward to more!
---
fuck off seraph
---
&gt;Yes if you have an absolute shit myrm fit that min maxes for greedy space shekels you are gonna have a problem. If you fit for combat you can win
---
The part you don't understand is if you shitfit your Myrm like you want people to do, it will take them \~100 hours to make back the cost of that Myrm.  And during those 100 hours, they *will* lose it to something.  Sometime there will be 10 T3s instead of 2.

&gt;I do. It means we have to move slow ass recons through all your space
---
Oh good, you bothered to look them up instead of saying the Myrm should light a cyno.
---
&gt;Just face it. You're shit at anything other than pve. You cry if anything shoots your boat. 
---
Nope, I gave up on grinding for ISK a long time ago.  I'm just capable of doing math and understand concepts like "ROI".  You might want to try that sometime.  You'd actually learn a lot more about the game.
---
Because Citadels and Supercaps killed Nullsec pvp.
---
Well that and hardcore farming/botting in complete safety.
---
I remember when Tengu fleets were considered impossible because there arent enough Tengus and losing a single fleet would kill the market and make the entire doctrine impossible to maintain.
---
And while in "low power" make it hackable so people can steal things from it.
---
Wow this place is cancer :/ great way to greet someone
---
They said they were getting rid of blackout, they didn't say they were bringing back local
---
&gt;Hey nice, looking forward to more!
---
Thanks man! haha see you around!
---
The problem is they offloaded chat to cloud technology and didn't hire anyone to implement it correctly. Saves a whole lot of money though at the expense of the players.
---
&gt;There have been a number of times where outposts were successfully dead-zoned for significant periods. 
---
And that was very, very rare.  Which is why it became noteworthy.
---
If you want to "bring back the outpost days", you need to have deadzoning take the level of effort it took back then.  Not tie it to something as easy-to-find as a citadel.
---
And on top of that the hunters take almost no risk, usually less for their entire fleet then the drones of a single Rorq.
---
They lost x players over 3 months, but you expect all of them will come back the minute they roll back? Repost int 3 months...
---
Hasnt even been 12 hrs yet lmao. Did u type this lastnight and wait
---
BuT NuLl Is tOo SaFe
---
&gt;But HOW do you do that?  
---
&gt;It is pretty much just that these people that don't want to PVP can never be made to PVP.
---
Step 1) Actually understand the people you're talking about.  Because that makes it way, way easier to design a system they'll like.
---
However this does require much more effort than negative stereotyping.
---
Ice in wh space? Can't say I've ever seen that in my travels
---
I have seen the vast field, can confirm it exists
---
You always played a finance game, you just chose not to understand it. If you want a PVP game why not playing Valkyrie?
---
23367 as of right now
---
Your reply is nonsensical and doesn't address what I said.  But to attempt to respond, I'll say this - local, when combined with intel networks/programs and the instant-cyno on every ship, prevented the small gang nano-fight.  It also prevented a good number of straight ganks.  A small gang cannot survive long and get a fair fight out of a null bloc in those circumstances.  Removing local and instant intel allowed a small group to get into the krab lands of nullblocs and start a fight.  Of course most krabs just quit the game rather than face the risk of becoming the bait for a fight...
---
Chat shit the bed....again
---
This is fairly correct in the PvE players typically want the complex crafting and player supplied economy, yet they don't want the drain that is required to keep that system in place. Star Wars Galaxy had the same issue in that it had a highly complex, player run economy and SOE could also never figure out how to get the economy balanced correctly without trying to force PvP.
---
Eve's problems are:
---
* How to make PvP less boring? How do players get in and out of PvP skirmishes quickly without breaking immersion in the game and allowing them to do so for as long as they want? Right now, PvP is long, drawn out engagements or hours of flying around for a fairly quick fight before starting the process over again.
---
* How to give PvPers $$$ without forcing them to play PvE or have some other profession?
---
* How to get PvEers to destroy resources without putting more resources back into the game than they lost? As Eve has no "bind on equip" stuff and no degradation, once a ship/module/etc. is in the game, its in the game until it is destroyed. PvEers aren't going to continually throw resources at something that they can get in a different fashion or loose lots of money on.
---
The effort of deadzone an outpost was zero. You stick it into an alt corp and turn off docking.
---
Idk what that means, but I thank you. I turned off the ‘64 bit’ launcher, I’m good now
---
tl;dr clicky click the jumpy jumpy instead of the bridgy bridgy

That would depend on the item for sale, wouldn't it, you drooling lackwit.   By the way, you double posted.
---
Oh and low-power / no power Citadels reduce bounties / mission rewards....
---
People that were not interested the options of "get gud or quit", move all of your activities far away from your friends and alliance or just being bait waiting for 200 bombers for two months may have... found something else to fill their time with an equal output of fun factor. Regaining their attention, let alone interest and even further... trust (consumer dollars) is not a sure thing.
---
\&gt;Goon posting
---
&gt;, i would have expected the numbers to go back up? 
---
Spent how many months to ruin it and its not fixed in 3 hrs? Are you an adult?
---
The damage could be permanent, maybe in several months or a couple years it will be fixed. Wait and see. In the meantime, make fun of the emotional types who identify as 'pvpers' and roleplay that blackout was good development.
---
You only lose isk if you dont adjust your profit margin calculations.
---
No EVE is a Sandbox empire building game. PVP is a part of it.
---
Rather than a numeric cap on the things per constellation, how about make base citadel EHP/resists a lot weaker but asymptotically raise it the more alliance members are in the system over a one week period (divided perhaps by the total anchored citadels in the system). For Sov Null maybe link it to ADM somehow. Alliances that are highly populous and active *should* be the king of the hill in their own space. Small guys shouldn't be barred from putting them up, but when people are anchoring these things far in excess of their intent to defend them, they should go down proportionally easily.
---
There’s a reason those who loved chaos only flew cloaked ships like bombers.
---
they’re cheap, stable, efficient, do what you want with no unexpected costs.
---
“chaos” was just a buzzword, nothing more. Null was always dangerous, but solo roam era didn’t “feel” dangerous, so they called it “too safe”.  These changes were, at the cost of EVERYONE ELSE, just made to make those risk averse hunters to feel “dangerous”
---
&gt; - Structure proliferation : Even with one less timer, or even 0 timer due to low power, it is still ultra cancerous having to clear 25 raitaru/astrahus per system. 15 min bashes at dps cap is not fun. There should be a way to greatly discourage structure spam (preventing it completely will be gamed) .
---
Crazy idea: The DPS cap scales with the number of Upwell structures in the system. So if you have 1 raitaru in your system the cap will be the same (or maybe lower?) as now, but if you go full delve and jam 50 structures into your system they're going to be easy to RF with a large fleet.

---
&gt;ok this is good feedback, I didn't think about it but it would make sense to. However, iterating on my idea, you could solve that by basing the queueing on access lists: you have docking rights (other than public/ freeport), your corp counts as part of the coalition. How about that?
---
So what you are saying, as the invading party, I just spam add the defending party to my access lists and shoot my own dummy citadels to strip their timezone tanking.
---
&gt; "just use a bomber to cyno in a recon off a blops then light your cyno" but that's tedious af
---
It's not that tedious for any group capable of a dreadbomb. And the target capital being unable to cyno is well worth the trade off.
---
1. Yes your minmax krab Myrm worth 70 mil is not going to defeat two T3 cruisers worth billions. Somehow this is unfair to you.
---
2. If I have to spell it out for you I can but I was giving you the credit of inferring what was meant. I'll get paper and crayons for you next time.
---
3. From the guy who thinks shirt fit myrms should hold off T3 cruisers.
---
I still can't understand, what is the problem with injectors? Every new player with ton of $$$ can fly any ship next day after joining. So what? He will be just a f1 pusher or feeder. 
---
How does this hurt a regular player? It will be just more stupid rorquals to kill.
---
Someone please explain. Thanks!
---
You have to take into consideration people's lives as well as the game itself, plus the potential spectacle that a large fight could draw.
---
0 timers are boring, you get to fight whoever is around the area and if they see they can't contest, then you just get to bash a thing. Yay Content.
---
1 Timer can bring medium scale fights, Medium structures (And these days even larges to an extent) are pretty meaningless, but a 24 hour warning of knowing where and when a fleet is going to show up is a great way to get some fleet action. This was the best part of the old POS mechanics. Medium scale fights, with a day or so set up to let people know to show up. 
---
2 timers with at least 48 hours from first RF to last vulnerability is when you get the big fights. These are fights where you don't want just whoever is normally online on a Thursday night. These are fights you want everyone to clear their schedule for because you know the attackers are going to come in force. These assets are expensive, they are strategically important. They are the fights that are supposed to bring the kinds of engagements that people outside of EVE will hear of. 
---
Having half a trillion isk structure have zero timers and just die because they should have had "the skill" to defend their big alliance's structure is the dumbest possible game design choice.
---
Where the hell do you live that your krab supers get 100% SRP and where can I sign up
---
Something along these lines are needed. Personally, I think the issue of OP citadel spam might have to wait a little longer to fix, because there are a lot of great ideas (like these) put forward that still have rough edges. It's complex. In the meantime, and especially from small-group-oriented people like you, I really want to see ideas about ways to encourage fights that aren't just via citadel bashes.
---
For instance, Ansiblex gates honestly generate more fights than perhaps they have a right to because they're in a sweet spot in terms of how they're viewed by attackers and defenders alike. These structures are easy to hit (when compared to the drudgery that is citadel bashing), they're worth defending (because saving travel time in friendly space is nice), but they aren't critical if you lose one (it's not like assets or slaves clones are tied up in Ansiblii).
---
CCP has (understandably) shown reluctance in undermining the "core" necessities for life in nullsec, like asset safety, by making them more easily assaulted. Yet krabs and pvpers will still happily hop in a defense fleet for friendly assets that give \*bonuses\* (like Ansiblex gates give shortcuts), and making these bonus-providing assets more vulnerable isn't as risky a potentially taking away training clones or asset safety.
---
So what other sorts of structures, system upgrades, etc., could we hope for CCP to implement in the near future to allow more "forced" engagements like this, where the attackers are excited to potentially deny some bonus, the defenders are excited to try and hold the bonus, but neither side is dreading the consequences of losing this one fight? Is this a reasonable way to encourage fights that aren't necessarily supermassive brawls?
---
There should be no asset safety for citadels without fuel ( the fact asset safety exists at all is different question)
---
Is it harder to,
---
1. Move in a bomber
---
2. tackle and cov ops cyno with bomber
---
3. have blops with recon ready
---
4. jump recon and light dread bomb cyno  
---
Or,  
---
1. Warp defensive cyno recon to you
---
People dont want to feel complete safety, people just dont want to feel hopeless about their situation,
---
K
---
AYE, MAKES SENSE
---
I just trained one super and three Rorqs.  Now to head to NS.  No idea whether it will pay off yet...
---
Yes. But well worth the trade off.
---
So you're saying they're useless because they can't solo frag a fleet? You can still force shit off, make life hell for attackers and with even an exponentially smaller defense fleet you can just ruin an attackers attempt at bashing.
---
They can also use sirens, so they can tackle ships.
---
HOW DO I KITE IN A RORQ???
---
Hundreds of people enjoying the game... bad
---
A guy blowing up afk pve ships solo and hiding when fought back... “content creator”
---
That’s some next level mental gymnastics
---
Fucking PREACH dude.
---
Based on what though? Ratting carriers will just have recons in the same system for the defensive cyno...which they'll be prepared for because now they'll see you moving slowly via local.  
---
Listen I like the cyno changes...but now with local back it's an issue.
---
What you do know in highsec is that w/e shoots at you will die whether you survive or not, alot of freighters afk in high sec so some of that is on them and they did just did that 3min bump warp out for them. Bro what do you mean no miner ganking, bombers bar, drifter holes, regular wh's, 100man kiki roams, dread bombs. What do you mean no war decs, players literally push other players out of there own system entirely eventually removing all there structures which can also be popped if you have something in in high sec. People dont roam in huge fleets into high sec to get kills. in highsec if someone attacks a 1bill orca , concord 100% comes and saves or avenges you. in null you better hope your friends are online to help you save your rorq. you can literally chill, in high sec. even make billions an hour doing lv5 trig sites. People roam in to null, use wh's to hunt in null, the guy next to you in high sec might try and suicide gank you and you may die in the process but the plus 1 followed the plus 100 in null WILL try and wreck you. No concord to help you and hopefully competent allies are around to help you out.

THAT WHIMPER IS HAPPENING NOW, M8
---
Damn, did my little demonstration about your lack of social skill make you snap ?
---
No more argumentation over anything except "My thread was overwhelmingly positive in terms of interaction", as if Reddit was some kind of social validation.
---
You were the one starting with stupid reactions over someone response and who said :
---
&gt;Here's an idea. How about when you log into the game, if you are in your system, it asks you if you want to do any pvp. And if you don't, nobody can attack you. There. You can be safe. 
---
Sure, real grown up response right there. How about you stop bellitling people when you're answering to them and start being a real adult with some social skills ?
---
All answers I made for you were argumented ones when you were only taking one specific point and regurgitating your profound hate for "krabs" in this game, please read yourself again.
---
You were the one playing (wrongly, sadly) with semantics. Please take your hatred for other people right of this subreddit.
---
Oh, and lastly :
---
&gt; Do you have any matter you wish to address or are you just patting yourself over hurt feelings?
---
&gt; people who remained because of the blackout
---
What two players in the world only played eve because blackout existed?  Not any meaningful amount CCP or the playerbase would be concerned with.
---
Blackout was truly poor game development
---
This could actually be *really* fun, especially if you randomize it or have the anom be consistent with the pirates of the region you're in.
---
Guristas infest your stuff. Serpentis start selling drugs out of it, etc.
---
Kendar will kill whoever is attacking then finish whoring on the kill for his loot pinata.
---
Doesn't work like that sadly. Too many people, everyone will ignore it.
---
Send them a mail in game
---
Amen, and praise Bob
---
close to that in GSF
---
TLDR when people can no longer make isk to buy ships and feel they are just cannon fodder, they stop enjoying the game.
---
Once again you have missed the point.
---
No, a CEO has different responsibilities.
---
Nothing missed, really. Eve is frozen game.
---
&gt; Ratting carriers will just have recons in the same system for the defensive cyno.
---
If they do, fleets get to kill recons. If they don't, fleets get a better chance to kill capitals. I'm fine with killing one recon for each tackled capital.
---
 Citation please
---
&gt;EVE has, hands down, one of the best, most complex crafting systems of any MMO today
---
It's the closest we've ever come to getting SWG's crafting system back.
---
Not that it particularly helps in this "all you krabs suck"-based discussion, but remembering this would help some of the folks who can't grasp that people might pay EvE for reasons utterly foreign to them.
---
Once again you confuse criticism of game changes with "hate for people." How can you ask others to be adults when you whine so much and confuse the issues?
---
I got the exact same kind of idea here : [How to fix citadels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d4ihko/hearing_the_feedback_from_people_at_eve_berlin_is/f0fp1y7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
We need a system to prevent spamming, whatever the system as long as it's not a retarded one.
---
I don't think people want to drop dreads to kill a recon. And that recon will have his supercap buddies in system before dreads will be able to lock and shoot it.
---
Can always hit up Silent Coalition, and learn the game from there. We support solo play, group play, mining fleets, low sec pvp, and null sec pvp with plenty of people around to debate the merits of various play styles until your eyes bleed.

Works from anywhere in the game.  Docking not required.  And how we actually got stuff out of conquerable stations and outposts after we lost them.
---
Unless you're gonna claim the new owners just never docked anything there, at which point you cut your firesale to 30% off and someone from the new owners bought it on the assumption they'd be able to dock someday.
---
Falcon and his ilk "elites" (veto, LOL!!!) got to run the asylum for a month. Pearl Abyss saw what any rational thinking adult warned of when Blackout was announced. $$$$ gone.
---
They didn't allow for a transition time. Paid accounts (8 of mine just last week, with Blackout as the reason) dropping faster and faster they most likely saw the money leaving and demanded an immediate reversal... like any rational thinking adult would have done when their little kids are out of control.
---
Updating that CV Falcon? Would be prudent.
---
Hard counters are not a good idea, unless the hard counter cost as much time and effort as my super and has a hard counter to itself.
---
Yep Null is as dangerous as going by plane. Millions of passengers use planes and VERY few actually are being killed in a crash.
---
Don´t kid yourself, Null is extremely safe if you are part of an alliance.
---
Capitals not being able to light cynoes benefits more people than just people who do dreadbombs. It benefits anyone wanting to hunt capitals. It benefits anyone who want to avoid getting capital blobbed. Etc.
---
And coming from one of the groups who conducts dreadbombs very frequently, i can testify we too find the trade off well worth.
---
Shazbot.
---
So you didn't go looking for a fight, you went looking for krabs to kill and in some mental gymnastics this is going to lead to the fight you want. And then when that didn't give you the fight you wanted, off you went back to CCP to nerf cynos because people keep dropping capitals and you wanted a nano fight.
---
No one is obligated to give you the fight you want. People dropping capitals on your nano ships is the same as you bring a nano fleet to kill krabs. Both have disparity in force brought against the other.
---
I can feel the warp overtaking me! EET EES A GOOOOOD PAIN!!!!

They spawn in shattered systems

I think with Chaos going as Chaos has gone they're putting things under revision
---
Maybe for bombers. I'm still 50/50 on it. I just think local now will make things even easier for defenders but we'll see. I suppose in theory it'll be easier if the defenders make proper preparations. In reality they just might not and it'll work in the attacker's favor.

Afford to lose isn’t always the same as willing to lose  and besides - It’s never really been true for certain people. We have all sat on comms and listed to people having meltdowns over loses they blame other fleet members for.
---
Why do you think that?  Explain what makes it sFe and think about why that’s called “safe” and not “well coordinated”
---
And then ask yourself away from your bias and lazy emotional state
---
What would coordination do on the opposite end of that battle
---
I have eight accounts. Most my my time is spent suicide ganking on one account now.

Well, it was ONE idea, and it will be the final bullet in the back of the head for a dying game.
---
Just a tip- don't refer to the character as a "toon" if you're able to get in touch with the current owner.
---
You seriously ask reddit to sum up 10 years of development for you?
---
Boot.ini
---
Yeah but they didn’t even release an overarching plan or dev blog right? It was just hilmar talking points.
---
Something like the game still has it core elements and dynamic or now we all fly space ponies and shoot rainbows out of assholes you know something on those lines, failing that or everything has changed nothing has changed everything has gone Pete tong Eve is not the game you left there's a million different ways you can kind of sum up my question....
---
Yep. On top of that some of the pvp players that came back/were playing the game feel cheated on due to ccp first baiting them with the "age of chaos" and then doing a 180° turn, those players will probably leave/take a break too.
---
Effectively ccp managed to lose trust from both PVE and PVP players at once.
---
That’s exactly my point. You want perfect intel, you put in the work to make it happen.
---
No one knows, not even CCP
---
What's the new Plex system apparently I need 500 of them when I left 1 plex was 30-day playtime just logged into it and it seems like it's just another cash grab free-to-play game again
---
wat now
---
They should have released upwell structures that would provide local to the sov holders that install them. And provide the first target for any invading force.
---
Seconded (and also a dino). Loved the blackout, dislike the cyno changes.
---
Local *does* provide perfect safety. Yes, people died with local - because either they felt so safe they were actually AFK and not paying attention, so they forget to press the 'save me' button, or because they were baiting.
---
&gt; You all act as if the entire fucking idea behind sov space and the alliance system wasn't to allow people to mitigate risk such that risk existed in proportion to the time and effort a sov holder put into defending their members and their space
---
What does that have to do with local? Local mitigates - to almost nothing - the risk of being hunted *without the sov holder having to make any effort whatsoever*.
---
&gt; Oh no, for you guys you had some sort of myth about null sec where any rando nano or cloaky gang should be able to waltz into a region controlled by 20k people, kill whatever they find, and get out safely 99% of the time.
---
What was that you said about straw men?
---
Without local, the sov holder still has the advantage of (i) scouts (ii) intel channels (iii) the ability to anchor structures (iv) the ability to bubble gates (v) an umbrella and defensive fleet to drop in response to an attack or to intercept the nano gang on a gate.
---
I'm still playing but this chaos stuff made me change my plans. I unsubbed my alt account and gave up on capitals. I used to do some carrier ratting and was going to work towards a super, but not knowing what changes CCP might have in mind for the future made me rethink that. If they want to turn off asset safety or make it so supers or titans can't rat that's fine, but I don't want to have a 20bil ship if asset safety goes away.
---
Never was a fan of the 'hard counter' way of balancing. Ruins the creativity of strategy and fleet composition that brings out the most fun and interesting fleets/fights.
---
That is true. I need to find a wh to move into.
---
Again, what 4 hour shift would you like to sign up for?  It's so easy, clearly you can do it, right?
---
&gt; The only real problem with cynos 
---
Cynos are the most overpowered feature in EVE, they needed to be addressed - simply needs iteration. Blackout on the other hand was so far from redemption. CCP tried to cheat instead of develop their way to where they wanted to be. The theme appears to be there are no shortcuts to proper development.
---
Plex and Aurum kinda got combined, as AUR is no longer a thing and you can use these new "mini" Plex to buy things. It's actually a much better system than the old one, as it adds granularity. But yes 500 Plex is equivalent to one old Plex. The math is correct, almost 2b for 30 days game time. Eve has mined/ratted away the value of Isk
---
If nullsecers are going to cry until they get local back then they have absolutely no leg to stand on complaining about that, tbh. And even then, if you're ratting in your static, you can't warp straight to tether. Plus you don't know what is in the hole before you go in there.
---
Wormhole sigs spawn often enough that if you cancel your op for every one you'll make a big dent in your efficiency, particularly after CCP buffed the spawn rate.
---
Not that I would oppose something to add to the risk, maybe a 30s-1 min delay in the sig appearing. But there needs to be a realistic risk in nullsec, whereas there are already risks in J space.
---
You can't "live" in a shattered system in any meaningful way.  No structures can be anchored there.  I believe the only place that even comes close to this is Thera but we all know that it isn't a wormhole, really.
---
Thanks for the tip :)
---
Wormholers already scout their holes, normally with an alt, it's not a big imposition.
---
Sure, that'll work for the first system. 
---
Then you break gate cloak, get reported in Near2, and watch helplessly as everyone else in a 10 jump radius warps to tether.
---
Actually if you made it 1 timer and there was some loot we would do it.
---
One way I think they are helping is the triglavian content, though, at it's core the rat gameplay loop is pretty stale.  I don't disagree with you in any case.  
---
They did an ok job with the new player experience and seeing the staged fleet battles and the epic arcs... sorta, but they've taken a step back from adding interactive events in missions and instead put them into the open world.  
---
One thing to note, Eve's storytelling is it's weakest element.  I've played this game for 13 years and I couldn't tell you the lore from any mission or event if you tortured me.
---
&gt;Tribes:Ascend

Fucking pour some out
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINMENT?
---
DANCE MY PUPPETS!!!
---
ahem... sorry.
---
Even just thinking about dreadbombers, you're not fully thinking about possibilities.
---
Even if there is a recon present, the cyno must be lit on time. This typically means the home fleet getting undocked, ready, ready to jump. That typically takes more than one minute. Which means you can anchor an inhib and bubble it. Now it takes time/skill for the recon to warp to a good spot 100 off the inhib to not get dragged into the bubble. Even if he lights the cyno, the rep range will be a problem. Meanwhile, if the offending group is any good, the recon will die soon. And the home fleet needs another cyno. It might just be the case that the defense fleet on grid is small enough that the offending side can actually escalate. 
---
There are just tons of emerging possibilities here. It's defo better than the previous status quo.
---
I would not worry about dreadbombers if I were you.
---
If it was "pretty easy" then it would happen more often than it does. This is the biggest single welp they've had all year. Beyond this they never lose more than 3 ships in a fight, even losing 3 ships in one fight barely happens once a week at best, and their monthly ISK kill/loss efficiency hasn't fallen below 94% since January 2017.
---
Although if you believe it to be an easy task, I recommend you take it on yourself, and generate your own battle report to follow this up with.
---
&gt; For fuck sakes you have alliances complaining there is no reason to shoot each other.
---
Because they all blue up with one another and then complain?
---
Not really sure how CCP is supposed to fix the fact that the two largest coalitions in the game are "functionally" blue to one another. In a giant nullbloc and want more content? Perhaps try joining a corp with a smaller "friends list"?
---
was very wtf about this post until i saw the posters name. top troll. A+ 10 stars.
---
I have it on good authority from a subject matter expert that bad data is better than no data. 
---
So, yeah. Basically.
---
&gt; Explain what makes it sFe
---
You literally get told a potential threat entered your system before that player even loads the system. It's impossible to be safer than that without having an 'auto warp to citadel' feature.
---
&gt; Olmeca, you will never 'fix' eve by turning off the thing it is famous for--emergent player built institutions--
---
L M A O
---
All they did was put it back how it was before the blackout.
---
Too true
---
It's not a ludicrous argument. You simply don't understand the mindset of these people. 
---
You are not dealing with players just trying to make more isk. These are RMTers who make a living on this stuff. If they need more hardware to make the same money to keep up their income steam, they will get more hardware.  They push the envelope of what they can get away with without getting caught, not any technical limitations.
---
Some krabs will have found better things to do with their lives having broken the habit and won't come back, or not with so many alts.
---
CCP did ban a lot of bots and hopefully learnt a lot about their patterns so they won't come back.
---
And anyone who was clinging on in the hope that CCP might finally do something about nullblob safety, and thought that Chaos Era was that, has now been shown that CCP is completely in thrall to the krablords and will lose hope and quit.
---
I'm not informed enough about the structure mechanics these days, but I like the idea of making structures behave in a way similar to a PI setup for a planet.  
---
One command center (capital) that powers everything else.  Capital dies and the rest go into final timer.  
---
Only one capital per system.  Only alliances at war with the current capital can drop another citadel in system to stop people from gaming the system.
---
I'm sure there's a point you're trying to make.    Why don't you just make it?
---
I'm sorry, I don't speak "Englishman who needs a sandwich."
---
Wow dude you have some crappy internet connection there
---
&gt; They push the envelope of what they can get away with without getting caught, not any technical limitations.
---
So why, in my example above, wasn't he running the 200 accounts before?
---
I'm pretty sure we havn't gotten a roadmap for 5 years
---
Exploration in a soe ship.
---
I could, and I do regularly in W-Space with my alt.
---
Literally what you just quoted.
---
It really makes me wonder why the hell ccp ia not doing anything about them. Everyone complains about citadel mechanics for a long time now but nothing happends. I think CCP's method of dealing with broken mechanics is also a huge leak in player activity.
---
Can't a covops go there first, light a covops cyno and then a blops bridges the recon in after?
---
&gt; you can literally chill, in high sec. even make billions an hour doing lv5 trig sites
---
Just choosing one example to point out your flaw, but get back to me when a socket disconnect means an INSTANT/GUARENTEED loss of your 3-5B ratting ship.
---
Yes, the new owners never docked there. That was the whole point of putting it an alt corp and turning off docking. The alt corp usually only had one member, which was an alt of the alliance executor. 
---
Deadzoning a station also carried a high cost, since the conquerors could never use it. Which is why it was so rarely done.
---
Being massively outnumbered, same as goons excuse during WWB.
---
i did
---
  the game itself will punish you with changes to mechanics if you do it successfully.... 
---
That right there is the point I've been trying to  make regarding the habitually nerfs and the also the bitching bitches bitching for nerfs if you find a way to successfully do something or  a successful ship design or what have you!
---
Well said!
---
Rare non-shitpost:
---
Blackout in combination with cyno changes make things significantly too difficult for the rewards given for PvE. As soon as I heard about cyno changes I figured that's when they would roll back some of the blackout. But I had thought it would be to some middle ground between what we've always had and what wormholes have, not a full revert. To me it signaled CCP acknowledging they have to balance the game around their bottom line, not health of the game. The problem with that is they are totally incapable of finding a sweet spot in terms of balance. I expect with enough bitching, cynos will be back on all shits except capitals and nullified ships.
---
All they've really managed to do is piss everyone off and show they still can't iterate as opposed to swing sledgehammers.
---
The lack of static entrances means the only traffic is hostile, which makes scouting way, way easier.  You can do it just by listening for the wub-wub.
---
Fixed gates in null mean lots of traffic, not all hostile.  Which means you have to watch constantly.
---
Bingo. I feel like the reasons for tether now have all been replaced by other functions.
---
&gt; "People stopped playing because they could no longer farm". Maybe there was more to it, like the game was shit for them - getting farmed by cloaky/evasive gangs - and no longer fun
---
How is what you said not just a different phrasing of "they could no longer farm"?
---
No, you listen for a wub-wub with your alt because the only traffic is going to be hostile.
---
In null, there's lots more traffic passing through the gates.  You actually have to watch the gate to differentiate between the hostiles and the friendlies.
---
There is no roadmap. CCP is flying by the seat of their pants.
---
Maybe PA forced them to stop blackout earlier than planned. That being said there's still no excuse to not have something 3 months after blackout begun.
---
I read "So firstly I have lived in..." and I just couldnt read on.
---
I scanned through and saw now secondly and thirdly, was very disappoint.
---
Ok let's resume your "criticism of game changes" in this comment chain + some of my favorite comments from you recently (oh and I read the chain for them, no need to get the "out of context excuse"):
---
This comment chain :
---
&gt; "Good luck scouting in blackout." **That's exactly the lazy entitled attitude that fills nullsec right now**. I was excited for black out because suddenly your scouts matter a whole lot more. F1 mashing is boring for me. **But for nullkrabs even this is too difficult to do**. Most people just seem to want to follow FC warp, anchor on FC, press F1 on target. Like I wrote in the OP, our player demographic has shifted from combat focused pvp types to **entitled krabs** that see pvp as a nuisance. 
---
So nullsec resident are a lazy, incapable bunch that feel entitled to security and are pvp-averse, according to you ?
---
This entire sentence speaks for itself.
---
&gt; **Why don't you play wow or something less pvp oriented rather than trying to shit up our game ?** 
---
Apparently wow players must be on the same level of inferiority as nullsec krabs, as much as anyone not agreeing with you fully ?
---
&gt; **You're a risk adverse krab**  
---
According to you, there are no other krabs. Also I'm not sure "adverse" means what you think it means.
---
Other topics the last 24 hours:
---
&gt; People unsubbed...**.the 15 man krab accounts unsubbed** because those are the people CCP attracted to the game. 
---
&gt; 2 months of black out and it must mean nobody liked it because **15 krab account rorqual guy** rage unsubbed because he can't krab in absolute safety 
---
So the people that stopped playing the game due to these changes are only krabs ? Take a lof of care answering this one.
---
&gt; Hi. I've made 99.9 percent of my ISK through media, theft (against enemies), drug trade and flipping firesale capitals. 
---
You were actually answering me. Does that mean that you have absolutely no first hand knowledge of anything you're talking about ? Because if you made 99.9% of your isk like that, you never mined in NS, you never chained anomalies in NS, so you cannot understand these people you call krabs, right ?
---
&gt; 30% which were bots and multiboxing krab accounts. 
---
Throwing random numbers must be fun.
---
&gt; **Fuck off krab** 
---
:')
---
Even further down the road :
---
&gt; **Shut the fuck up Krab** 
---
and the lazy variation:
---
&gt; **shut the fuck up krab** 
---
&gt;  **I hate risk adverse farmsville krabs** **whose very presence have pussified the game** into it's current form.
---
We're getting to it. Your own words.
---
&gt;**List non-krab reasons to hate on blackout (pro-tip: You can't)** 
---
Your own topic.
---
&gt; And you miss the point. Hunters/pvpers will fight each other just as fast as krabs. If krabs aren't there anymore, pvp gangs will just run into each other and fight. Win/win. 
---
Your own words. Why are you crying then ?
---
Hey, do yourself a favor and ignore the "join any corp" as well as the plug for 'Silent Coalition'. Seriously, don't. 
---
Take your time finding your niche play style, try joining public fleets, whether it's pvp or pve. Try solo wormhole activities, hacking data/relic sites, work your way up to be able to do combat sites if you can't already. 
---
Carefully consider before joining any of the mega corps because once you do, you're pretty much blacklisted from the others, as well as many neutral corps who question your presence and/or reason for leaving, or applying to join their corp.
---
&gt; I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
---
Make your 2nd and 3rd character slots for this
---
The joke
---
Lol.  Literally nothing has changed for 10 years.
---
So wait are you upset PLEX cost might go up.
---
Boo fucking hoo.
---
So you're saying that they will 'push the envelope' after the nerf to nullsec, but not before? Still makes no sense I'm afraid.
---
Its so easy and safe
---
This is great.
---
Have an upboat
---
Eve problem today are citadels, simple as that. at least you could hinter ppl from fueling poses in old days, citas on other hand take days to remove and have damn boring mechanism.
---
That's absolutely not the case which I can tell you from the constant experience of 'splash on C3!' ... 'oh, that's me' in comms. You get plenty of blue splashes in J space too.
---
And the other side isn't true either, there isn't 'lots of traffic' in null apart from in a few pipes.
---
Low powered citadels honestly just need to lose all of their usefulness. I'm not sure what reasoning CCP gave for allowing a citadel to be used if it has no fuel. It makes no sense in game or real life. No fuel should make a citadel just a metal junk in space. No tether, no clone bay, no weapons, nothing but docking allowed so you can refuel it.
---
Pretty sure I'm not the only one to say it, but it needs to be said over and over again until CCP gets it.
---
Ask away and filter by salt replys
---
Hope so, else it will be on the playerbase to organize something.
---
You're about 9 hours late to the party. All chat was broken after downtime, requiring an emergency additional downtime, hence this post.
---
You're going to far, he will overheat.
---
If you find it, be sure to inform CCP, they seemed to have lost theirs.
---
Gs up
---
Hoes down
---
Continue with the Gila, just strip the fit down to t2, have a blue pill, you should be fine in most instances.
---
Honestly, I still would like the sites to scram so the bullshit mjd battleship meta moves away regardless of local, along with whole locked down farm hole, like force people to have there static to somewhere, it forces somewhat more eye's in space, and leads to more local farming leading to more escalation into fights.
---
I miss when EVE was like this for me. Keep it up, and have fun!
---
Great stuff! Keep it coming, we all love starry eyed newbros here. (Dont mind any negative nancies, comes with the ~15 year old community)
---
thats it? your internet problems? losing a ship that ccp will give back to you if genuinely in such a manner? thats it? mind you, how often could that even happen to you lmao. lets say it happens once a week, while you rat 5 days out of the week. oh god how will you recover with just 20bil in your pocket. oh and btw 3 to 5 bill ratting ship? dude there are 2bill fits that can do the same job buddy.
---
how's the playerbase going to arrange AT ship rewards?
---
You'll definitely want to join a corporation (aka guild) relatively soon. There's a few new player oriented ones, Brave Newbies (my favourite!) as well as Pandemic Horde, Eve Uni and I think Dreddit is recruiting too. There's loads more, those are just the ones i know of. The in game social menu has the coporation tool, there you can filter by type, location and active time zones. Ask lots of questions in the new player channels too, GMs will have highlighted names/text (it's not possible for a normal player to change the colour of their name/text).
---
Use the agency window to find missions near you and then, if you join a Corp, get on to their voice chat ASAP, it's much faster to learn that way.
---
Despite the way we shit talk each other. Almost everyone in eve is friendly to new players and most of the shit talking stops at the Corp boundary. We're actually a friendly bunch
---
Well, yes. All traffic is assumed to be hostile unless a friendly says they’re jumping X hole. 
---
What this means for you is that having 100 people jump back and forth makes you have to watch the screen for Red Vs Blue pretty much all the time.
---
Well at the end of the day no bottom line means no eve so yeah it’s a balancing tool as well. 
---
The combination of the two as you said made it no worth it although there were plenty that left before that due to blackout.  
---
As for cynos it’s a bit restrictive and easy way for CCP to open it up is to say make it on all T2 ships from destroyers up but not T3’s
---
Stops nullified ceptor cynos and stops cynos on capitals while allowing dictors, hictors, command ships etc to have them again for capital hunting and harder cynos for the big cap battles.
---
Feels like this is one of those things that has transcended the player base and has everyone universally shouting the same thing to CCP for years now. An unmaintained citadel should be a piece of space debris requiring no more than a quick 10 minute clean up job to eradicate.
---
More of a general desire. I left Goons to join move into a wh but got caught up in local politics in my old lowsec home. PH was moving in and i wanted to help. Now I'm kind of there and haven't left.
---
Blackout just was the final nail in the coffin for my 12 accounts, they will stay burried 6 foot deep in the never play EVE again cemetery. The other countless nails have names like WIS, citadels, injectors/extractors, alpha, f2p etc.
---
10 years are more than enough ...
---
&gt;That's absolutely not the case which I can tell you from the constant experience of 'splash on C3!' ... 'oh, that's me' in comms.   
---
&gt;And the other side isn't true either, there isn't 'lots of traffic' in null apart from in a few pipes.
---
Come on down to D-P or 1DQ.  You'll find there's lots and lots of traffic.
---
I don't think I've ever passed through a gate in the D-P constellation when there was not at least one other ship there also passing through the same gates.
---

Krabs gonna down vote this
---
PI in wormholes. I'm producing 2 types of P3 and with one account I make 3b to 4b per month, updating once or twice per day.
---
But like, not checking when a final timer is, and shooting it blindly is literally just stupid. They can definitely improve the mechanics, sure.
---
But if your baseline experience that is cause for your complaint doesn't even have any effort out in on your part, what's even your point? It should just mirror something with no effort because you don't want to learn something new?
---
The people change cause they get tired of having to bitch.  The newer players don't understand until they've dealt with the same broken shit for years.  Discussions and suggestions are meaningless.  
---
Watching the average new bro turn into a bitter vet is like watching the 5 stages of grief.  Denial of a problem (this game is awesome, I love it!)  Then later, anger, this is a problem we must fix it!  Then bargaining, where they try to explain the problem and this is where most of the constructive ideas, that they spent hours on are published.  Bitching is stage 4, depression, not as constructive but still valid.  Stage 5 is unsubbing, acceptance.
---
Having a stroke?
---
&gt;What this means for you is that having 100 people jump back and forth makes you have to watch the screen for Red Vs Blue pretty much all the time.
---
When there's 100 people jumping back and forth, you aren't krabbing.
---
We call it "Tuesday".
---
I used to play this game fairly hardcore back in 2010 for a few months. Came back for a brief moment in 2014 due to the 'Brave Newbie' fad before the meta-masters squashed it flat.
---
The people who want this game to keep going are the old vets that have probably sunk thousands of dollars in the game due to time+alts. It's a wicked case of 'sunk cost fallacy' and 'Stockholm Syndrome', kinda like when someone is at a table of blackjack or poker and they spent money they shouldn't have and 'need to win it back' somehow. Logically, that money is gone, but the emotional and psychological pull is still there, to make the investment 'worth it', so to speak.
---
The game is boring. The concept behind EVE Online is fantastic, but CCP's implementation is absolute **garbage**. The UI is dated as fuck, the pacing is slower than paint drying, and the community is so jaded and toxic, that you can't find an honest commentary about the state of the game without getting some player alliances' propagating narrative.
---
If you like the premise of the game, give 'Avorion' or 'Space Engineers' a go instead. I don't know when 'Starbase' is expected to launch, but it looks fantastic so far.
---
Risk adverse carebears wanna play in perfect safty of their own homes they should go outside and get mugged or something.
---
Lol if you time it right you can kill a low power citi in a wormhole in 12 hours.... Did no one read the blog post when this was released?....
---
Every action has an opposite salty overreaction
---
What's with the blank space
---
We can't, but I believe having to design AT ships wasn't the reason they stopped and there would be some input from CCP on that in this worst case scenario.
---
But is the AT only about the rewards, though ?
---
Just light a covert cyno and jump in a blops to light a real cyno to dreadbomb like ccp intended, it makes perfect sense, hello?
---
Pretty much, the Abyssmal shit is an atrocity that I feel hurts the game long term more than a lot of people realize.  Moving PVE into solo instanced pockets is the complete opposite way PVE should go, as it hurts people actually in space.  The fact that CCP shit so many resources into it while ignoring most of the 15 year old PVE already in game makes me weep for the future.
---
I support that view.
---
I have a character in game since January 2005. And I am still here. I do not do pvp and I am not interested in doing that (just in defense if needed) and all I do is PVE.  So I do not care about citadels, blackouts, POSes etc and changes made. The PVE part of the game suffice for me to keep me playing this game. And after changes to Alpha/Omega - I have all needed skills maxed - I can do that easily in Alpha state.
---
My char was podkilled just once in 14 years.
---
Of you're burning out, try something entirely new or go back to something that you find nostalgic like this. 
---
I occasionally run level 4 missions (not burners) for this reason. High sec combat anomalies as well (please a-type frigate mods)
---
Mmm that's some grade a salt right there. Also isnt that the reason for any game? Epeen over epeen in a big epeen party? Ya pretty sure
---
PVE ships can still have hefty tanks, you know that not just the hulk exists right? there are a wealth of mining barges that trade mining amount for tank, and its easily possible for some of them to tank for a minute against a solo dude, long enough for your friend to come and dunk him (because cloaky ships are sacrificing some pvp potential to fit that cloak). Instead miners expect to use maximal mining output setups in dangerous situations, thats called being dumb in any other arena, but in nullsec, its meant to be acceptable? 
---
Second of all, nullsec is about building empires, which cannot be done without friends, why are you expecting to be able to do risky stuff solo in dangerous space? Wouldn't it make more sense that if you have a group of 10 miners out, you have at least 1 player dedicated to protecting them? that way a solo ganker cant really do anything, and if a gang comes along its much easier to notice and you can form defence fleets, infact forcing gankers to group up inorder to kill miners is generating shit loads of content, because its not really worth it for your corps pvpers to undock for 1 loki, but 5? thats a small gang fleet fight on your doorstep. 
---
You are just proving my point more and more though, you are literally saying that you expect solo mining in defenseless ships to be viable in nullsec. Essentially treating nullsec as being as safe as highsec. Yes this is the way it has been for a long time because of intel networks, no it isnt good, and never was. Ever wonder why goons have 600 titans and a fort in every system? because miners had essentially 0 risk unless they were mentally handicapped or afk.
---
seeing as how the last (at least two) attempts by the players to organize something that utilized thunderdome had to get canceled because lolccp it'll have to be entirely without ccp involvement at any level
---
1. The change has been advertised for less than a day. There's been zero notice
---
2. People lost aren't going to be easily regained. Those that left will have replaced the eve addiction with something else
---
3. Bot farms have inertia. Gonna take them a bit to get goin again
---
One time i found a low power citadel that was 2 hours past the time we could kill it like you suggest. Which meant we had to wait a week for the next chance.
---
'If you time it right' is kinda meaningless.
---
We need more of this sort of stuff in this day and age. More wonder, more excitement, more pure joy of the game. Not just wall to wall text of people bitching that CCP is not following their idea of how to make the game better.
---
The way he describes it, it sounds like people just gave up because their favorite activity was no longer feasible.        
---
It wasn't just the lack of their pve activity, it was that they got farmed by pvp guys at the same time. During blackout it was: Try to do anything in a subcap or carrier and you'll find yourself soon tackled by something that decloaked and kills you, before help can arrive.
---
Just posting a reply to the OP since replying to each retarded comment individually isn't feasible.
---
First off, when I need isk, I rat in a super and I take proper precautions so that you "elite pvp" clowns aren't a threat to me. I'm not trying to make my own ratting activities safer; they don't need to be safer and I don't even do it often enough that I really care. Yes, I avoid risks during that small amount of time when I'm ratting - any "risks" that show up while you're sitting there decloaked shooting rats are virtually guaranteed to consist of overwhelming numbers that you have no chance of fighting back against (read as: blops drop). There's a big difference between MANAGING risk and outright refusing to accept any risk - the former is smart, the latter is cowardice.
---
With that said, what I \*do\* want is the opportunity to kill you entitled, arrogant little kids when you show up for your free Myrmidon/Ishtar/VNI/etc kills on my alliance members. Yet, there currently exists no feasible way to force you into a fight, and you refuse to take fights of your own volition - you happily run around claiming your free kills on the carebears while loudly proclaiming the virtues of risk and danger, but you outright refuse to accept any significant risks to yourselves.
---
So, either man the f\*\*k up or shut the f\*\*k up. If you aren't willing to take any risks to yourself, then STFU about how everyone else should be in constant danger and all that. If, by some miracle, you DO actually manage to grow a pair, then make yourself useful and help me find ways to facilitate actual PVP instead of this pansy low-risk killmail farming you currently pretend is PVP.  If you're as "elite" as you like to believe, you should have no problem showing off those "skills" in actual fights before being able to claim your miner/ratter killmails.
---
(No offense or exclusion was intended towards any female players or redditors by the phrases "man the f\*\*k up" or "grow a pair.")

&gt; Intuition by Jewel
---
I was thinking something like the [Space Pirates theme from Metroid Prime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HThpnZIRc).
---
CCP doesn't know the roadmap for Eve Online and that's the real tragedy here.
---
Seagull hasn't been at CCP for 2 years. She wasn't fired, she left. Same thing for Quant, he left. A slow decline over a number of years for a game this old isn't exactly surprising. What is an issue is something like blackout dropping 12k players off the DCU on a weekend. If you're going to try and spin the bitter narrative you need to get your facts right.
---
U mad bra
---
You've never been to Horde space, have you?
---
Fuck the AT
---
Oh nice! Now I know how to get child porn finally. Thanks!
---
Looking at his Twitch channel right now. Is it the most recent EvE stream you were talking about? The one with the Minmatar cruiser fleet?
---
Litterally the whole point. Instead of adapting like everyone else they decided to die. 
---
I couldnt care less, give me 5 more good months and shut down the servers.
---
No... it was older than that one.  Perhaps last week sometime.
---
That's why we have a moral responsibility to upvotes this crappy meme.
---
Obviously, everyone is free to stop playing for whatever reason they want. If you're not pleased with a game, stop paying for it. That's what people did with the blackout/cyno changes and that's what some will do no now. 
---
if you honestly feel the game is no longer worth your money, I applaud you for taking a stand and doing something else you find more fun in your life. Godspeed.
---
Yes but again this seems clunky and hardly intuitive.
---
Really hope you are right. But if the defender wants to be prepared for this, with a recon already on grid cloaked 100 + off, they can do it. I know if I was krabbing that's what I'd do.
---
I agree, but my point was that the ceo was making the business decisions, not the devs.
---
Unfortunately Blackout also turned off my ability to telepathically receive notifications from CCP in real-time. 
---
Of course they didn’t return instantly.
---
And I stand by every word. What was your point copy pasting me? That I told krabs to fuck off? I have no problem doing it. Here i'll do it again. Fuck off krab.
---
Recently came back to the game, had citadel mechanics explained to me, and my reaction was fairly similar. "That's *fucked up...*"
---
Nice!  Would you happen to have the model files for this?  (And any others?)  I'd love to paint some in classic tan + gold.
---
The "pvpers" you're thinking of are pvpers in the same way that Lussy Lou running a DED site in a Vargur is a krab.
---
Not cloaked, not a true wormholer yet... On a serious note, I took the plunge from NS into WH space like 3 months ago and I honestly never thought I would love it as much as I do.
---
Yes, but if no can dock to take assets out, no one bought the firesaled goods.
---
It’s also day 1.  A little early to jump to conclusions.
---
And yet shit still dies easily and often.
---
If you can concurrently rat on more than two carriers you are a bot. Also you make no mention of a fax or rescue cyno, so for sure do some research before you fly out 30b isk and lose it in 20 minutes.
---
&gt;As long as you undock a ship, you should expect to loose it at some point.
---
Sure, except that doesn't apply to the self-proclaimed "hunter" crowd that flies around in cloaky + nullified T3Cs and only engages helpless targets.
---
&gt;People go on roam to kill, if it's easy and in numbers of course people  will go for it and when a solo player comes, does the local respond with  one ship to a go for a fair fight if they undock something ? No they  will go in more/bigger ship to blob the hunter. 
---
I have TRIED responding with one ship - it doesn't work. They still run.
---
Also, I'm not talking about people who go on roams looking for fights, I'm talking about the self-proclaimed "hunters" who use bombers/T3C to avoid fights and only go after miners and ratters. If you're roaming around looking for and taking fights, you are a "legitimate pvper" in my book, and you are doing it right. If you happen to catch some miners and ratters while looking for fights; great! There's nothing wrong with killing carebears, the problem is with people who are only interested in farming those low-risk kills while avoiding any danger to themselves.
---
i'm not judging multiboxers or botters, why are you so tilted
---
&gt;hey kind of wanted it. And I don't see how anybody with a calculator couldn't figure out that there'd be more than a dozen through the simple method of n+1 because a titan is pretty much entirely made out of infinitely farmable resources. We all act like we didn't know the solution to this but we did. How many Revenants do we have in the game? Moloks? Vendettas? Aren't these perfect examples of exactly what CCP had envisioned for super capitals?
---
Well the counterpoint to that is why should only an elite band of a few have the rare ships in the game and just go afk, taking them out of the pool? How could we repossess them for active players so that way only a select cadre of people have them for the fractional time that they are subbed to the game?
---
But this goes even beyond that. Titans since their creation have been an enormous beneficial tool to the people who have them. In fact, I remember reading articles were those who were interested in industry beyond highsec basically needed a titan to bridge freighters of materials around, or from a logistical standpoint for an alliance. It was a huge barrier to entry for a lot of groups who wanted to be contenders in space, and that's just the nature of how they were designed.
---
&gt;You were the one who didn't read it because it offended you.
---
no i just didn't want to be bombarded by stupidity, which didn't work out as you're still talking.
---
needs robotic legs and eyes tbh
---
Dude.
---
1.) You used 'snowflake' unironically. 
---
2.) MMO's are designed to be addictive. This one in particular encourages multi-boxing and long periods of play. Gotta keep those timers ticking or I'll be left behind. 
---
3.) My corp was also "IRL comes first, we're all 40 yo here", but that does not translate to the subtle pressures of "Can you stay on longer?" There are many corps where you have to remain extremely active to stay "with your friends." That's a lot of peer pressure. I was encouraged and praised for sacrificing time with my partner and my family and it felt GOOD. "These are my brothers! They need me!" 
---
I liked Eve because the community is somewhat more mature than other MMOs and I liked the feeling of being needed and the thrill of beating another person at space fun. But I went on raids for hours at a time with the same people, who have kids and jobs. Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic. Every alcoholic drinks. 
---
I'm just saying: it's hard to play solo and in a short time frame. You cannot play Eve for only an hour or even every few days. I'm just a cautionary tale and you're just triggered because I hit a soft spot. Sorry about that, honey.
---
Did they ever fill the executive producer role yet? Is that why Hilmar and the art director has been going around to all the world tour events?
---
Hmmm. Thats an interesting design space. Have it be almost like (dont be scared) PI, in that you need structures linked together, a Keepstar provides a system wide powergrid/CPU that the fitting and structures of everything else in system take up. Can balance it out to have squishy industry focused systems, and hardened military focused systems for chokepoints, staging etc. 
---
Make it so you dont need to grind down every athanor/whatever, just the primary keepstar and everything else powers off, 1 or no timer for those smaller structures. 
---
Only issue is high sec, no way can you expect everyone to throw up Keep's in their systems. Perhaps tie it into Sov in someway, so structures work as detailed above in Sov null, but high and low have some other, simpler system in place? Im just spitballing at this point.
---
this pver versus pvper meme needs to die, most pvers pvp and most pvpers pve
---
I think it’s the combination. You have a super good mining ship that also tanks well that also has panic. Look at the barges. The tankiest one has less yield. The yield one has no tank. Rorq kinda flies in the face of both of it
---
Depends on how cheap you priced it.  Someone would take the risk that they'd be able to dock someday.
---
Again, this was extremely rare.  You should plan a system around this being the normal way things were done.
---
Eh, I'm actually pretty excited about blackout ending. Not really burnt out. I will not miss having to behave as if there's a cloaked bomber fleet watching me every time I undock. There's no replacing that "new MMO" smell the first time you get sucked into a game like EVE or WoW, though, is more what I was getting at.
---
Actually, Rorqs DO indirectly inject isk into the game, and it's not an insignificant amount. Much of the ore they mine eventually turns into ships, and those ships generate insurance payouts when they die.
---
Granted, Rorqs also devalue minerals which reduce insurance payouts across the board, but on the whole they DO add isk to the economy.
---
I don't think anyone who doesn't own 20 Rorq accounts thinks multiboxing Rorqs isn't a problem at this point...
---
I think you're over-selling the magnitude of this. 
---
Yes, it does help the defender, but not by a massive amount.
---
Twice in a row now you misquote me, never said anything about them being useless either.
---
There's no need to explain how it helps even a small fleet either, because it's beside the point. I was talking about solo citadels.
---
I think it’s to the point of denial for most tbh.
---
   There’s such a stigma attached to PvE activities that people just claim to be only a PvPer.
---
You're right, it's about who's left.  
---
My apoligizes in advance for a quite bad english, i'll do my best to be as clear as possible.
---
It's the first time i'm posting here despite i'm an Eve Online player for 12 years now. 
---
As reference I can say I was CEO of a little high sec indy corp, got around 3000 kills in low sec anti pirate gameplay around kubinen, before the corp I was in (Parabellum-Project) joined Vendetta Mercenary Group (yet another risk averse alliance specialized in high sec wardecs), then went into nullsec to create and be CEO of a renter corp in Triumvirate, then Fraternity space, that corp was N A OS.
---
Since two years now, at each patch, I wonder "what the fuck do ccp want to achieve with all those changes", each time, my only answer was "they want to promote pvp and large scale", because pvp generates destruction, and they need to balance destruction over production.
---
Examples : structure timers aimed at being a rendez-vous for big fights, Sov mechanics as well. Very easy covert cyno gameplays allowing any little cyno lighter to bring thousands of F1 specialized risk averse "pilots" to show up and almost one shoot even the biggest ships.  
---
Maybe my point of view can be biased by the renter gameplay i've been enjoying the last 3 years but still, I was always listening carefully to my guys, and particularily their reactions over very simple facts. What is clear is that even if no one hate at all pvp, anyone will prefer pvp when it's coherent, when it deserve a real purpose, when finally it's part of a goal, and, and when it's consensual !  
---
it's very easy to recite that very simple phrase : "when you undock, you consent to pvp". Say that to a covetor pilot wanting to access very little income in a 0.6, say that to a VNI pilot who wants to earn a little 10M isk per tick for a few hours. No one is begging for full safety, but you should never forget that Eve is firstly a video game, we play a game to have fun, not for stressing each time we click the undock button... I already expect some "learn to dscan, learn to play, adapt or die" guys ready to put as an answer what they think it's the final, absolute, almost divine answer, calm down dudes, YOUR reality isn't everyone's reality.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating any hunter, or "adapt or die" troll but there's something that reveals very well  the gap between pvp specialized guys and the other guys. why that , i'm not sure of the answer but it can't rely fully in their mentalities, things can be done to make pvp become more attractive and seduce more people.
---
This blackout had in my opinion two effects : bringing fog of war way too close to some people who got extremely stressed by the situation, and giving some pseudo-pvp to some risk averse cloaky hyper frustrated pseudo-hunters. Pseudo-PVP ? Yes, it can't be pvp when your targets are PvE ships, it can be called PVP ship against PVE ship, but not PVP at fucking all. Pseudo-Hunter ? Yes. How can those be called hunter when the majority are just sitting cloaked in a system, or click their cloak module when there is any risk of backup ?  
---
Very good ideas have been recently exposed , especially around structure spamming , sovs, and such, but in my humble opinion there are cancers that must be adressed ASAP.  
---
\- Free cloaking, Free covert cyno by warp cloak ships : those mechanics should not be possible at all, this has been discussed since years now but still not fixed by ccp. I understand cyno alts, cloaky alts, must be omega, it brings $$$ blah blah. Covert cyno brings risk averse F1 specialized retards, without any counterparts of any sorts (unless you 100% of the time have a fleet ready to backup, any time, everywhere in your territory with dozens of cyno capable ships everywhere, absolutely rididulous). 24/7 cloaky morons, ready to hit anytime their chose to hit, brings .. well ... risk averse F1 specialized retards as well. Those two things needs a complete overhaul and be nerfed hardly, with the counterparts of a more dynamic , enjoying, active, pvp hunting gameplay. Wormholes routes are a very good solution for hunting new target and have a more enjoying content , but wh+cloak+covert cyno ? nah. this is just fucking imbalance showing PvE players as the passive cows they're not. Pushing PvP to only two mechanics that are : cloaky or ultrablob surprise actions isn't the way to go, CCP has to find new mechanics that make pvp more enjoyable in smal/micro gangs, but as well allow target to be able to react well more often  
---
\- High / Low / Null (I wont talk about J-Space which have its own mechanics) : like players have a very progressive evolution in the game, why are those three "universes" that different in the fact, despite ou only have to get through simple gates to go from one to another ? imho it's a problem that needs to be fixed as well, with the apparition of a new "high rewarding, but extremely hard to keep even for goons or any ultra big bloc, deep nullsec" and a "perfectly safe" zone where absolutely no one can shoot anyone except for good reasons like a war. that safe zone would not necessarily be really big, say 10 to 50 systems around all regions, but as it was say in another thread : newcomers need to feel safer than they are nowaday. And mechanics transitions between all those lands become more progressive than they are currently.  
---
\- big blocs, small entities : It's very clear that many of the recent changes are very good for helping the biggest ones, thus killing the smaller ones, is it what CCP wants ? just 5/6 hyper big alliances with no chances for any small things to evolve and make their way ? Mechanics must be found to encourage and help little corps/alliance, while discouraging big blocs to get even bigger
---
The idea that the majority of players "only" pve and "only" pvp is  just silly. Most people use pve to fund pvp.
---
My hypothesis on the whole situation:
---
We saw a "resurgence" of activity from players who knew it was too risky to pve so they'd pvp more. After realizing they can't keep up with funding their pvp, let alone their future long term projects, they feel fiscally repressed and slow down. Because they don't want to welp ships and feel it's not worth the risk to krab downtime, the best option is just to sit in station and wait for a krabbing opportunities or strat ops. That eventually leads into stagnation and people playing other games *cough* classic wow *cough* than bothering logging in.
---
I wonder how much of a population will actually come back to the game after being acclimated with not playing it for a while.
---
I agree. But caps shouldn’t be able to fly with impunity without support in what is supposed to be the most dangerous parts of the Eve universe and people shouldn’t bitch and moan about not being able to fly them without support. It’s a game that relies heavily on playing in groups of people other than your own alts.
---
yes they usually have discounts and bundles (like buy 3 months of omega and get all this other stuff) Plex sales are more frequent though.
---
I couldn't disagree more.  Imagining "PVP" players that can't roll with something as simple as no local don't actually fit the description of "PVP players."  But if you are right, then the EVE we have today is a tragic husk of what it was.  All of my isk has come from Anomalies and Wh's, and at no point did it seem "too hard" or "too risky." I've died doing both, but my wallet is still very green.   Local going away does nothing to hurt either of those.  If some players became to feel entitled to max ticks/max mining cycles, that's on them.
---
But if what you're saying is that EVE has changed from having players willing to struggle to make ground, then fine.  That is the death sentence for EVE as far as I'm concerned.  It could "live" for 10 more years off the subs of people excited to rat and mine but that's not a world that holds any interest for me.
---
Super umbrellas weren't a good solution, they were just the only solution we had. Nerfing them could actually turn out to be a GOOD change if CCP also gives us an alternative that makes it feasible to respond to threats in our space with reasonable force.
---
Ganks on our miners and ratters would be a GOOD thing if we had a way to get a small subcap gang to their defense in time. In that situation, someone getting ganked would be content instead of a nuisance and a guaranteed lossmail.
---
What proportion of people succeed at getting safe, and what proportion fail and die?
---
Just saying that deaths are not completely eliminated doesn't actually work as a rebuttal.
---
Most people just use their corp/alliance discord, there are a few public ones though like Talking in Stations  [https://www.talkinginstations.com/](https://www.talkinginstations.com/)
---
if a person is pursuing a personal titan, then perhaps it should take that long? these ships are meant to be alliance level assets - they should be acquired by whole corps collaborating etc. one guy, alone, grinding a titan for himself should take hours and hours..
---
&gt; no i just didn't want to be bombarded by stupidity, which didn't work out as you're still talking.
---
You can stop replying at any time.
---
&gt;holy shit you're delusional
---
&gt;go snort some asbestos
---
This is not a refutation of my position it's just you throwing a temper tantrum because i won't just agree with you or leave at your request.
---
A few unsubbed? Try like 1/3 of the game unsubbed to the tune of roughly 10k players.
---
That's not the aids that prevents small groups from easily taking space though. Nobody's out here complaining they can't invade key NC. super jump points or industry systems. The problem comes when even taking an unused constellation requires alarm-clocking 10 times over the course of a month on weekdays just to clear out the random shit in there and spending a month reinforcing TCUs and IHUBS over and over praying for a timer that you can be awake for.
---
&gt;I miss when EVE was like this for me. Keep it up, and have fun!
---
I keep getting requests to join corporations and get forced into PvP, or Mining, or doing whatever I can to help those ahead of me. Instead I chose the way I wanted to play and kept to myself, and this is where I can explore my mind :)
---
This is how I feel about it.
---
The only positive takeaway from it is that CCP actually iterated on something.
---
Covops was originally an offensive subsystem and fitting it instead of a better offensive sub resulted in nearly that level of damage loss.
---
Then, for some stupid reason, CCP decided to make it a DEFENSIVE subsystem, which turned T3Cs into the risk-averse killmail-printing machines they are today.
---
Oh oh oh, and also a retirement saving account that pays out interest by staying omega!
---
So out of interest sake... Where do YOU live? Because you seem to have a hard time differentiating between absolute security and realistic security...
---
your username in the launcher does not matter, it is only visible to you and is only used to sign into your account. No one in game will ever see it nor should they as it is one half of your key to get into the game
---
Bots 4 ever!!!!!
---
They announced the Blackout wasnt permanent a long time ago, and now they lifted it people are convinced it's for some financial reason. I think that despite claims to the contrary, CCP are not fools, and if they are that concerned about what they see as stagnation they are more than willing to let some subs go.
---
Ok second ultimate scam artists
---
Here's an idea for you.
---
Blackout was the single stupidest decision could have made especially since the chat server has always been fucked.
---
WHEN WILL CCP LEARN TO COMMUNICATE LIKE A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY WITH ITS CUSTOMERS ?
---
WHEN WILL CCP LEARN TO ACTUALLY CREATE SOMETHING NOT AXE SHIT CAUSE THEY CANT CODE?
---
WHEN WILL CCP STOP WASTING EFFORT ON PIPE DREAM GAMES THAT NEVER WORK?
---
WHEN WILL CCP DELIVER ON WHAT THEY PROMISED SO LONG AGO?
---
Simple farmers don't have a "central staging". If it was a matter of knocking out a fortizar, they could do it. The issue is SF have dozens and dozens of astras and raitarus that all come out in every time and day under the sun, meaning you would have to spend basically 12-13 days shooting structures with full 24/7 TZ coverage to evict them. A capital structure taking a while to reinforce would be the least of TEST's worries under the proposed system because they could clear everything else out in a few days on a weekend, and just have to worry about clearing one last staging cit.
---
good print!!! please add layzors!!!!!!!
---
&gt; every action has an equal and opposite reeee-action
---
I fix this
---
It left with CCP Seagull last year.
---
having loads of people packed into a couple regions should has its upsides, but should it not also have its downsides?
---
&gt; i won't just agree
---
what wont you agree with again, exactly?
---
If they can't manage to get local back without blowing up the servers, Imagine what will happen if they try to bring back the AT...

BLACKOUT GOT RID OF THE DEAD WEIGHT IN THE GAME.
---
statements like this are generic, don't say anything, and are pointless.
---
Hey guys. I'm trying to make some friends. Anyone out there? I like board games, hopefully you do, too.
---
the newest koolaid I brewed has a kick
---
Wise words.
---
I will reiterate my position again for you then. That there needs to be a balance between creation and destruction for the game to be healthy. I can say it more concisely but that requires using language that you find offensive and turns off your higher brain functions when you read it apparently.
---
we could tell without the 5 other versions of that message you posted.
---
Krabs were just bad and boring before, now that the prevailing unwisdom is that krabs are directly nd knowingly responsible for the death of Eve, no one will ever admit they do anything but swipe a credit card to make isk.
---
So does living in a WH, and reddit posting.
---
cool statement, i never disagreed with it, so i'm confused at why you continued replying.
---
And CCP universally ignoring a common sense solution.
---
With a minmatar like colour scheme. A former slave using former masters weapon.
---
That's the direction that I want CCP to go towards, but I really don't want them to try and accomplish that in a single patch.
---
Thanks :)
---
You did disagree with it when i put it like "null doesn't need risk when the production and destruction are balanced."
---

---
Null blocks are to big to fail. Bail them out!
---
I think they have more pressing things to worry about than giving players a means for better cybersexual encounters.
---
Join as an alpha (free) and see if you like it.  As mentioned below, the sub isn't happy right now and voicing it loudly so don't let it sway you yet
---
because
---
&gt;null doesn't need risk when the production and destruction are balanced.
---
is a totally different statement
---
saying "no risk is okay" is wrong in any context in a game predicated on risk vs reward.
---
to be fair, theres only certain parts of null that were turned into slaughterhouses - the places where people tend to like to roam because a) they are target rich environments: null is very unequally populated, theres a few regions that are bursting at the seams, and others that are almost empty. grouping up is a double edged sword: theres safety in numbers, but your enemies also always know where to find lots of you. which brings me to b) there is often animosity towards the targeted groups, both cultivated and embraced by the leadership, but also inherited by virtue of certain groups dominant positions in the game.
---
we can dream
---
Maybe, maybe not. I've already gotten more hours out of EVE than I did out of ED. And it feels more satisfying to boot. TBH, if a space game has trading, mining, and combat, I'm down for at least 50 hours of it no question.
---
For what the pirate groups would have as theme music, I don't know of anything out there that would really fit the game and faction perfectly, *or* who you'd get to do the music. Maybe [Antti Martikainen](https://anttimartikainen.com/)?
---
* Blood Raiders would definitely use Gregorian-inspired music that sounds both beautiful and evil in equal measure. Any creepiness should be measured so people aren't actually driven away from fighting them.
---
* Guristas should be some kind of techno pirate music because hell, they're pirates to the core and *they love their job*.
---
* Serpentis should also be techno music, but more of a corporate/cyberpunk style mixed with something like [the Turanic Raiders' music from Homeworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWr0Ei1ePN0).
---
* Angel Cartel...I'm thinking a sort of pseudo-tribal techno theme to go with their Minmatar origins?
---
* Sansha's Nation is - along with the Blood Raiders - the closest thing to pure evil the setting has, so maybe something like the music from [DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKHvbxzTO8g) to make sure you know just how unambiguously righteous it is to kick their ass?
---
* Rogue Drones should definitely be a techno theme, probably something like a darker version of [Modern Design from Universe at War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rh3L-6CRok) or [the music from the Geth Dreadnought in ME3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeQpuXhqh2I).

This is scarily accurate and I can relate as I seem to go through these every time I come back. This time around I've been at #4 since the announced end of the AT. Everytime CCP does something (anything) I go back to stage #3 only for them to fail to iterate and I end right back at #4 until something else changes.
---
Beautiful, exactly what I was thinking of.  This needs to be a CCPls request ^_^
---
Scouts are useless against covert bombers amid a blackout though.
---
&gt;I will say it one last time.  It isn’t fun any more.
---
That's a really important consideration.  It's why CCP needs to get away from massive nerfs/changes and move towards iterative balancing.  Not only will that move us towards a balanced and fun game, but it will stop destroying entire playstyles in a single patch.

Seeing upvotes under "wipe your PC when Windows farts" is very painful for a tech.
---
PC support has become a very predictable thing: Dipshit thinks he can maintain his own machine because he knows how to use it. Dipshit never bothers to learn anything they don't absolutely need to know to use their computer.
---
Dipshit breaks something. Dipshit follows 17 different, outdated tutorials for fixing vaguely relevant problems on Windows XP. Dipshit has now broken many things.
---
Dipshit finally approaches a subreddit or IRC with their new multitude of problems, but the techs are mysteriously incapable of diagnosing a problem that stems from some dipshit pushing every button and praying.
---
Dipshit concludes that their error eludes even the professionals, and decides that trying to fix their computer is a fool's errand. Dipshit begins telling others just to nuke Windows and start over.
---
Dipshit gets upvotes.
---
They were designed to be more powerful than they are now. A single titan was suppose to single handedly turn the tables. The counter strategy to that is you just don't. There's no way to balance a game to have smaller entities compete in the same ring as a larger entity. This isn't Skywalker versus the Death Star. We don't get to be the protagonist in our own movies. Smaller entities need to be able to exist and grow in their own time, sure. Which I suppose means they need to be able to grow without null sec and beyond the oppressive reach of null sec alliances. Null sec needs to be balanced. Then high sec, low sec and Jspace all need to be worked to make them equally engaging as a style of play as one another. So that eventually they can step into that ring when they feel that they are ready to.
---
Krabs will just complain and the nerfs will be revert within 1 week
---
&gt;  and drives the economy.
---
i am pretty sure thats also what argentina said when they just started printing more money.
---
people do that already... there was a video just here of a dude hunting DED tengus, where over 3 days he killed a few and got &gt;bil each time. iirc, he made like 6-7 b from those 3 kills. i suspect that theres very few activities that allow you to make anywhere near as much as a solo player not multiboxing.
---
So how do you decide who to cater to when other have different goals that conflict?
---
Huh?
---
You can see the Proteus just behind the rock on the left.
---
I did eve uni when I first started and it was perfect. Shows the ropes of the game and exposes you to a bunch different playstyles so you can decide on which one you like the most
---
The way I see it. When I'm looking for fleet engagements. I keep an eye on Discord. When I'm looking for a fair fight. I log off and play a different game.
---
No, it's just that when you are enjoying it you aren't bitching on Reddit.
---
So Reddit will always be bitching.
---
Yea, I could see that being the case.
---
&gt; The combination of the two as you said made it no worth it although there were plenty that left before that due to blackout.
---
I still think that most of the rage quits over the blackout would have eventually returned if the meta had been given time to stabilize, but this whole idea of a "chaos era" and rapid fire changes before we had time to adjust to the last big shake up really sealed the deal.
---
I haven't been on the right side of this the whole way through, I cheered for the Drifters and I cheered for an age of chaos, but if I'd known all the changes coming I probably wouldn't have.
---
As one of the developers who worked on removing CQ, the best discussion of the reasons for it were in the [dev blog where we announced it.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/preparing-for-the-future-retirement-of-captains-quarters-twitch-integration)
---
Removing CQ helped enable, among other things, work on the 64-bit client which is now default for everyone and has made the game a lot more stable in large fights.
---
We had some very animated discussions about whether there was a case for bringing CQ up to modern standards, but in the end we couldn't make that case.
---
I really need to set my flair to AMARR VICTOR.

i can't reply to every retard like you on this subreddit, it'd take well over 24 hours a day
---
&gt;It takes about two months to build a habit
---
so the people who stayed were just starting to get used to it
---
So then why’d you bother replying to me? Must’ve really hurt your krabbing ass.
---
Probably, using the reason "If players lose their stuff while not playing they're less likely to return!!!!" which is what CCP thinks as well. Shame they care more about trying to lure players back than stopping them from quitting.
---
I agree. Many take it way too seriously, and I'm left to wonder if the big null blocs have a bit more vested in it than just the game. There's no question there are entities in game profiting their IRL wallets. We wouldn't have bot farms if people weren't buying and selling isk, but that's a whole other topic to worry about. 
---
The good thing is we have a lot of alliances in this game, big and small. Find one that works for you. The one I'm in is very understanding that personal life comes first and whether you agreed with the blackout or not, we stayed together and adapted. Many knew it was just a matter of time CCP would figure out a better solution, most didn't expect a full rollback though to the original local. 
---
My game went from 90% pve / 10% PvP before the blackout... to a 50/50 game after the blackout, and now the ironic thing is it'll probably stay 50/50 now that local is back. I just wish others took that time to adapt to the extended risk in null. 
---
Stay alpha for a while. Doesn't hurt to take a step back.
---
Ah thanks for the reply just was curious since I seen the id in my corp logs
---
&gt;People that were not interested the options of "get gud or quit"
---
just adapt
---
&gt;move all of your activities far away from your friends and alliance
---
lol get gud and get some friends, bring more of your own caps
---
Sound familiar? You guys are godawful fucking hypocrites. The only difference is that pvp nerds actually did adapt; krabs refused, and decided to throw their toys out of the pram.
---
What do we do for people like myself who are afk and burned out for a bit and taking a long break or just straight up unable to play. I.e. deployed with the military or in the hospital etc...
---
If I lose all my stuff because I logged off docked in a safe place that's not going to make me want to come back.
---
Maybe we restrict asset safety to a certain size or type of structure but there needs to be protection for those who aren't here now but might be coming back or they won't ever come back.
---
Not even the devs know the roadmap.  Right now they are just flinging shit against a wall to see what sticks.
---
Every system has a free sanctuary in it where people can hide to avoid fighting you, and they see you coming 10 jumps away.
---
the game isn't predicated on that. players present the only risk. If there were no other players there would be no risk anywhere in the game for a single person in the game world.
---
This is the same thing that has given rise to the blue donut as it is known. And why unless something is done to discourage that playstyle it will encompass the entirety of player controlled space. Because there is nothing inherent in the game systems to get players to fight. Only npcs fight players unconditionally and force them into battle. 
---
the problem caused by low risk environments cranking out products however can be mitigated by consuming those products at a rate equal or faster than the production level. This is where the problem arises from said blue bonut. They no longer fight. And because they no longer fight their products aren't being consumed. So they created a double dip on the balance problem, they increased production and decreased consumption. It's no wonder that there's a problem.
---
However your solution of cutting off the ability to produce has the knock on effect of making people unable to play. And what happens when people are unable to play? That's right they stop playing. This is a bad end and without solving the other side of the equation aka consumption you just end up with a shrunken game, that's already shrunk from where it was. 
---
This is also how we got into this mess. Nerfing the playstyles of solo/small groups has had this as a consequence for a long time building up to this point. And what did they do? They stopped playing. They aren't going to come back because you killed off the group of people who were their targets. How does that even make sense honestly? You aren't going to grow the player base by eliminated niches. You won't make room for new growth by killing off and salting the earth of what grew there before. At best the same thing will regrow and at worst nothing will regrow.
---
Oh, so the fact that the announcement post in their old forums hit the post limit (10k) and was actually flagged for moderation for awhile was not informative to them. Overwhelmingly negative posts on their forums and here about it wasn't a good indication. 
---
They just had no way of knowing, I guess.
---
Drop 50 raitarus in Perimeter, don't fuel them, wait a week, profit.
---
I think what I'm kind of bummed about is - ok, chaos can be fun.  But at least have some lore logic to it.
---
Drifter attacks?  Could have been better.  
---
Blackout because of the drifter attacks?  Ok, makes sense (even though the drifters stopped attacking).
---
Cyno changes?  because fuck you, that's why.
---
Abyssal sites can be run in a gila. Start with low tiers. I'm not sure you're quiet ready for tier 4 even if you get the right fit, but you should definitely be able to run tier 3s with a good inexpensive gila fit.
---
and sov too.
---
I liked the blackout because it was a big buff to the way i play. I am not however so vain as to believe that what's best for me is the best thing for the game as a whole. Which is why i am not mourning the loss of the blackout and just waving it goodbye. 
---
And if you are big on ratting and mining you should consider that the next time some change comes a long that affects you in the future.
---
The file that was used was this: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:117708](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:117708)

And it was printed at 250%.
---
Joining a Corp is t bad. Find one that does what you want or doesn’t care what you do. It’s nice to have people to chat with at least.
---
&gt; Keepstars need to be anchored to a star.
---
This sounds like a good idea to me, but I think it would be better if they were also limited in how many Keepstars could be placed per region.
---
I also had an idea that Ansiblex jump gates could only be anchored on a star, and no other Upwell complexes or citadels could be on the same grid as them.
---
Sounds like they need to upgrade their 15 year old chat system
---
seriously i urge you to downlaod Second Galaxy and invest into that game its a brand new mobile and PC game. A LOT like eve. even has a system call Old Man Star. it will at least give you your fix while CCP tries to save themselves or if Eve Echos is tits. o7
---
a core part of EVE is the player driven market, and the market is mostly driven by loss. pve (in highsec particularly) drives sales to a certain extent, the issue however is that those ships very rarely get destroyed and need to be replaced.
---
PVE (industry) and PVP (war) depend on each other.
---
This is exactly what will happen
---
Is this not the nature of humanity though?  I mean look back through human history, and it's all been about increasing safety, increasing and optimizing supply (whether it was food at first, and later industrial), and improving quality of life overall.
---
No real surprise that the same progression would take place in a sandbox game.
---
yikes that flair bait tho
---
So, you aren't whining right now?
---
Sure looks like that from the outside.
---
Think you could help me find it? I'm going through his Twitch channel right now.
---
CCP has introduced a few things that are stupid. Citadel spam being one of the most ridiculous, rorqs, etc but nothing quite as dumb as the blackout. Catering to one side has had a massive consequence for CCP and now both sides of the coin don’t trust them.
---
do you play in high or nullsec? genuinely asking.
---
PvP is the most profitable enterprise for new players. Make friends, be in ewar frigates, and loot everything.
---
Oh, none of this fiasco was Korea.
---
It was all Iceland.
---
Right. Yea it's a bit annoying but makes life so much easier. Would u know how to deal with webbing sites? Like does kiting work there? At what ranges?
---
If only it were possible to have an alt with a force recon parked near your krabbing ships, ready to batphone for help...
---
"Content" usually means player-versus-player interaction. Currently, with extremely few exceptions, PVE fits stand little to no chance against a PVP fit of even a "weaker" enemy ship. Also, a significant portion of PVE encounters favor solo play for optimal results.
---
I guess this is in preparation to reintroduce suspect timers on t4 and t5.
---
I wouldn't say that. I only recently started EVE and immediately I was drawn to wormholes. I currently live in one and the best part is you never know who could be lurking waiting to swoop in while you're doing a combat site or mining. Keeps you on edge and makes you prepared to fight at anytime.
---
I hope things will change? You still have faith in CCP?
---
lol there's no way, abyssal runners buy plex
---
That's insanely stupid if intentional. 
---
Surely that's some kind of oversight on CCP's part?
---
Are you saying that EVE players never overreact or are immature?
---
Alpha accounts, as many divisions as you want.
---
Thanks I’ll change it when I get home.
---
Age of safety.
---
I do like this bit though:
---
&gt; If you own the TCU in the system, you can select 1 structure, with a 24 hour spoolup, to be your 'capital' structure of the system, the capital structure gains the hull timer.
---
Basically it means one structure per system is tanky and any others are less so. It's a soft limit to multiple structures in a single system.
---
Wow if someone catches on to that they can steal his ship becasue an empty ship can be boarded by anyone.
---
This is a joke, right?
---
Left to work for Bethesda, a much more competent company.
---
Like everything else in Eve that I once had hope for.  Is gone.
---
It's the same with what happened with CCP banning brisc and init FCs after getting meta gamed . Ever since CCP seagull left ... CCP management has been piss poor . A lot of good people left this year
---
A couple thoughts in response to a few of yours:
---
1.  CCP can't even get regular local/no local to work right, and you want them to try to tie it to something like a decloak timer?  That's hilarious.
---
2 &amp; 3:  My suggestion for asset safety is to make it like ship insurance:  you pay it ahead of time.  It lasts from the time you pay it until the time you log back on, and it cannot be initiated on items in a citadel that has been reinforced.  Think about that one - if you're playing pretty much every day (or even just several days per week) you know when your stuff is about to get attacked - so take the risks of moving it out then.  Work with your corp/alliance to combat move fleets (if you're not going to stand and fight, that is).  If, on the other hand, you're going on vacation/school/business travel etc. and will be gone for a bit - it would be worth it to pay it.
---
Pretty much unfortunately.
---
Which is what entosis link first envisioned, but broken by citadels
---
Today I learned Seraph really is still the dumbest of the grr gons
---
They actually don't reimburse you on socket disconnects, just fyi. They'll say something like "the logs look fine on our end" and you won't get shit. But sure bud, Abyssal T5s are -totally- as farmable as null anoms are.
---
huh broken clocks
---
I found my lost shaker of salt
---
people can afford to lose them, but it just doesn't make sense to use them outside of extremely safe scenarios
---
Jump bridges fit that category to a degree as reffing them has an immediate impact. But of course the final timer is still up to 24hrs away.
---
Yeah it isn't in any patch notes afaik so i'm guessing it is an oversight. Regardless they added frigate abyssals in this state which makes me think it was intentional.
---
Wow 300-350million when I was playing
---
Only on all-bomber ops, and bombers have a very hard time killing a proper fit rorq unless you're bringing like 80+ dudes (and most hunting groups are much smaller teams, unless they're state actors backed up by a sovnull alliance). Dropping dreads/carriers is a legit risk, and even if you get the kill you often lose all your dreads in the process.
---
Yeah that sounds great in 2008, but we're past that point now. Titans are the only ship that matters in sovwar, and will remain that way until fax &amp; boson removal. If you're in a sovnull alliance, and you want to matter, you get a titan or you get out.
---
This is awesome! Brings way more to the Eve story. Please keep it up!
---
Proper IT infrastructure should not be required for Eve online. The game itself should have a reasonable user interface.
---
Any third party application or tool that is in fairly widespread use is a clarion call announcing an area in which the game is deficient.
---
Was a fuckin fun fight man.
---
Man yall are dense, clearly was a joke lmfao
---
Asset safety takes so much fun out of the game.  What's the reward for going to war?  You can't take their stuff or make them firesale it to you.  Maybe if your nerds are more autistic than their nerds you can keep them going longer, and then at the end of the day, you get to spend up to 24 real hours (over the course of a week) doing nothing in anticipation of a 10 second animation.
---
I really hate to be like this but we've been at this for years now.  I had more fun on the receiving end of fighter-assisted tengus and crazy-ass sov mechanics and POS code than grinding citadels.
---
&gt;TLDR Just down vote
---
Upvoted.  You can't tell me what to do.
---
Seriously though, your post is spot on.  There were a handful of good things about POS mechanics, and the 1-day event nature of it was definitely one of them.  11 days... is just weirdly and dumbly long.
---
Could you give some context?
---
This post is 1 hour old and no one has made the obligatory "can i have your stuff" response. Herracy!
---
I generally agree with you.  I was about ready to quit when Incursions came out, but they were fun because in addition to being an ISK faucet there was also competition even in highsec; you could compete for a site by trying to do more damage and get all of the reward as a result.  That still got boring after awhile and nothing else really enticed me to stay.  People were getting more risk averse and inflation made it take more and more time to replace anything you lost and to also just pick up plex for your accounts.  It's just not fun to roam for a few hours and find nothing but large fleets or cynobait, then perhaps be bored enough you end up engaging in a fight you shouldn't have and there's a few more hours you'll need to waste at some point in the future to recover ISK.
---
100% agree and I’m done with it.
---
The building blocks are there with Abyssal and to a lesser extent, burners. I would like to see burner style encounters replace all mission content. Each pocket could have a single encounter against a random ship of the faction in question, similar in size to yours. Sometimes they get reinforcements or have logi (or they come on a timer). Many optional bonus pockets to test out your might against stronger ships. Quick and serious ISK rewards.
---
Provide tutoring and helpful information during lower level missions. Higher levels start having web/scram in later pockets or bonus pockets.
---
Level 5s are in low sec and award additional LP and ISK if you score kills within x time of completing the objective. Offer incentives to the hunters (they also get a free mission site if they kill the player so part of the loot should be tied to a tag).
---
Depending on how it works, I believe it could be scaled to groups eventually.
---
Yes, it requires some work on AI, numbers and "rules" (acceleration gates are needed, hate all you want. I wouldn't be surprised if they got a cooldown or access limit either)
---
You get more 1v1 and small gang fights, which will leave players looking for more and provide a decent intro to PVP and hunting. Those are the players you are trying to reel in, the rest would have started in a large corp/alliance already.
---
Having written this, I can't help but wonder if part of the problem isn't the players' need for power projection in low sec. If we got rid of the concept that low sec should be just as deadly as null, more artificial limits could be implemented to have low sec as the place for pvp without the fear of getting blobbed. It's a concept beyond wanting safety, though. It's about rewriting some core rules. You farm it up in high or null depending on your preferred play styles and community, then everyone can go meet and fight in subcaps in low sec, in fights of marginally selectable sizes. Then you go back to your people and do whatever it is you do there, burning out on L4s and belts or anoms or sov war etc. It sounds so much simpler and what are you really losing out on?
---
Blackout occurs at the same time as the wow classic launch.
---
Coincidence?
---
That is why the outpost era system was reasonable. It's more meaningful than the current citadel system, but without the catastrophic loss of everything dropping.
---
Hiding you pve on alts is the pussy move.
---
Well you're complaining that they're a waste of an omega character to use, but they're way stronger than any other ship you could have ongrid while costing only a billion or two.
---
What kind of printer?
---
Be sure to go fuck yourself.
---
Violates Rule #5
---
Yea that's like back in 2012.  They haven't been that cheap since, well 2012
---
#&lt;3
---
They touched some POS code again and broke this. Be glad the client doesn’t suddenly start a thermonuclear war after every patch.
---
the punishing with changes to mechanics for doing well... it really hurts, and it really hurts players who are trying to catch up.
---
Everyone has XYZ, so you try to get a XYZ... and it gets nerfed just as you manage to afford it/skill into it.  Seems to be the continuous course of things.
---
This is a really interesting idea.  But I'm not sure how much I like it in the context that none of these mechanics could be ported over to lowsec/npc null.  Structure spam is a problem in all parts of space, and taking on a solution that is highly specialized towards one area might make future balancing for other regions of space challenging.
---
The sandpit gates safer. I take it at this point CCP has just bent over and is getting rammed by the krabs.
---
Better BR: https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001556&amp;b=8786640&amp;e=1710&amp;t=rbaaab
---
I'm not complaining at all tho.. 
---
See the post I was replying to
---
&gt;And to follow up on that, why can a station in LOW POWER that has 0 Fuel use its weapons? Kind of nonsensical if you ask me. Why even offline any of the services if it can still defend itself, even without fuel?
---
I was pointing out that it doesn't just cost fuel to defend a citadel. You need to keep a character there.
---
Agreed why force people to fight in the trolls timezone?
---
Until ccp remove nullification from t3c those will still be a problem
---
yea bro i cant make a bil an hour outside of trig space idk, and fyi yea ccp is picky with there tickets but they do at times help you out. right and hows your concord umbrella, pretty spot on at all times?
---
its almost like a umbrella, at all times, that always wins, while you make billions :D. gg bro you got me you guys sure got it rough up there.
---
you already do get isk rewards for pvp in the form of drops. hunting the right kind of players can provide insane payouts, ex. DED site runners, wh ships tend to be quite blingy too.
---
More accurate BR

Was a super awesome fight
---
Theyre going to keep making EVE easier, i guarantee it. They need new players to stay viable. Early 20 somethins dont have the patience to learn like we all did back in the day. Its unfortunate but true. I mean look at all the recent changes, making UI more newbro friendly, more safety features, etc. And the "chaos era" is aimed more at vets because they know for the most part we can adapt.
---
The Anycubic i3 Mega.

I asked where though... Since you don't bother with a flair...
---
For those of us who saw this coming and could have saved CCP thousands of accounts and a lot of $$$... do we get free SP? 
---
Asking for a friend.
---
tldr
---
I fucking loved blackout !!
---
that doesnt change the original point - that getting a titan solo should be hard and time consuming - if you want to be a big dick player in an alliance of 30k people, you have to put the work in. or titans get nerfed sufficiently that line members can be relevant again aside from their industrial output.
---
The new ambient sounds of wormholes is really quite eerie. The splash sound is also more subtle now so you might miss someone coming through if you're not paying attention.
---
Your reply tells us all we need to know about you. Bravo.
---
now why would i broadcast my own intel &gt;.&gt; comon bro
---
Devs need to play if they’re going to understand what we as players go through.  From my personal perspective these changes didn’t make any sense.
---
You're full of shit, thats why
---
Awesome, well done the abbadon is one of my favorites. I have been wanting to get into 3d printing as a hobby sny recomendations for a newbie?

when the salt streams start flowin hmm. good talk bud.
---
From my limited encounters with them they can spawn rarely at the end of the more difficult null-sec sites (Haven and Sanctum) as well as in asteroid belts (extremely rare). There's also the dreads that the NPC Sotiyo's spawn, but I don't know how many ships (and what size) it takes to spawn those.
---
As someone who run T5 abyssal for my main source of income I hope this is a bug. If not this is probably one of the biggest fuck you CCP could give to the sov NS community 😂
---
&lt;3
---
"sir the low player numbers are just due to everyone wanting to play classic, not due to anything else whatsoever"
---
I am just happy that I can start making use of my tools in an efficient way
---
So it's too hard for you to make a recon alt? Alright then bye lmao
---
The hard part for ccp now is how to re-engage those lapsed players an get them back. Trust is a tricky beast once its gone its very hard to get back an ccp has gathered a reputation for less than well thought put changes to their one an only product line.
---
It will just be like my real life savings account, constantly withdrawing so i never get the premium interest.
---
I unsubbed 3 accounts and started playing other games during the blackout. I found that I don't really find EVE enjoyable. Now I give another gaming company my money and I quite enjoy what I play.
---
Annnnd, now I want a resin printer.
---
i know, i was joking
---
decrease belt spawn rate to once every week.  decrease minerals from moons.  increase combat site spawn to 30 minutes between sites.  
---
for citadels, maintenance costs. Low power was a start, but just make the citadels become unusable in low power (e.g. no tether, no docking etc.) and only have one timer. that and increase the fuel costs.
---
done.
---
Nope. Either commit and use your real voice for voice overs or don't make videos that require voice over. That stupid ass robot voice is helping nobody
---
&gt; their bottom line, not health of the game
---
These are the same thing.
---
I know the game has a ton of issues to sort out right now but down the line will you consider bringing it back? It seemed meaningless on the surface but I think it had a very positive impact on the NPE. I started shortly before CQ, quit because I didn't "get it", and came back after CQ was implemented. It really did A LOT for grounding me to the universe, connecting me with my character, and ultimately carrying me through that rough patch to end up addicted to EVE forever. I always had CQ set as my default view when docking and have missed it ever since. 
---
And it's not just me as I got 2 other friends into the game back then and they feel the same way now.
---
Also, your player cosmetic items are completely pointless without it.
---
I’ve been playing for a month and a half now and applied to Brave Newbies after the first week. Took them a month to get back to me only to put me on hold because I made a friend and ‘had some interactions with them’ while playing. Whatever that means.  Would not recommend unless you like getting jerked around.
---
This is the part you don't get - I AM looking for a fight.  I don't want to kill an AFK Myrm or VNI.  I want to fight the fleet that responds when I tackle that krab.  I'll take the gank if that's all that comes, but it's not unheard of to tackle the ratting ship and hold it for the response fleet to form.  
---
You and your risk averse brethren don't understand that, I know, but the ratting ship is bait to me.  It's a means to an end - hopefully a good brawl with a response fleet.  
---
I'd explain more, but I'm sure the spod is too dense in your skull for you to follow.  I'll just sit back and await your quiet "reee space shouldn't be dangerous" counter argument.
---
They certainly aren't. Short term vs long term health may be a simpler concept for you to grasp though.
---
I'd pretty much come to the decision to unsubscribe 5 out of 8 accounts just before the blackout was lifted and have been actively looking around for a another new MMO that fit my gaming style. We've lost a few in our alliance to WoW classic
---
It's not so much the blackout itself, but the poor way it's been implemented and what I feel is a game that is now coasting and actively being developed, grown.
---
After playing Eve since 2008, it's no longer the vibrant game and challenge it used to be...
---
That requires work
---
lets not get greedy :)
---
with no damage caps, you could almost alpha the things off the field.
---
That truely is a simple and wonderful idea...
---
Carriers do exist. Drone regions have carriers/motherships instead of dreads/titans
---
Go to delve
---
Well that’s a depressing read
---
The Ender3 is very popular for it's high value (quality/cost). and is also one of the cheapest to get into the hobby (~$200 USD). Has a pretty large and helpful community too (/r/ender3). But there are many other makes/models. /r/3Dprinting is a good place to get an idea of what people use.
---
They certainly are. Losing a huge chunk of players who you will not get back to make a small number of people happy is not a healthier game. It is a small number of people being made happy at the expense of both the bottom line and the health of the game, both long term and short term.
---
Or are you still in the "there is massive organic growth coming" camp?
---
Fuck off, goon.
---
I AM FREE FROM THE SHACKLES OF THIS GARBAGE PILE FOR NOW
---
The outstanding issues in the game have now been a part of it for so long that fixing any of them is going to hurt like hell. It's probably too late. You can't un-spam citadels. You can't take injector alts back. Asset safety changes, cap changes, resource availability changes, all of these would hurt someone badly, and might drive them away. PvE needs to be completely replaced, but the effort might not even be worth the reward anymore. Combine this with an aging playerbase that just doesn't have the time to spend hours trying to make content happen like we did as kids, who are steadily dropping off for unrelated reasons...
---
If there are glory days for Eve again, it better come quickly.
---
tldr: if you balance the equation by making it so that people fight with each other the risk problem will solve itself along with the blue donut problem.
---
&gt;All this makes me think Eve just might be legitimately reaching the end of its product cycle.
---
I chuckled. Funny how you have to phrase things to avoid the meme. But it's a legit concern.
---
Eh, I'm gonna win at eve again.  I've also disabled renewal on all my accounts.  I will be attempting to learn how to play CIG's game while it's still in alpha, maybe try out elite dangerous again and might even play the dumbed down eve knockoff that's out there for a while, since it's basically eve with warp to 0 autopilot, and an auto-combat pilot....     
---
CCP is not the same company it once was, the idea that you can suicide bomb someone in highsec and ruin a carebears day is antithetical to the new eve, and really that flexibility is why it was so terrifying:  
---
You could die anywhere at any moment... but if you use your wits, you might be able to avoid it.   
---
That's wonder/terror is gone for me, and now I'm just bored with all the baby gates they keep putting up.  I'll go do something else with my free time.  Thanks for all the fish.
---
The game was stagnant for a lot of players before the chaos era.  The chaos era then just made the game un-fun for many players (not all but many).  From these changes and the state of the game before and after has left many players feeling they have no faith in CCP to actually finish any features they start or release fixes in a timely manner.  None of the core problems are currently being worked on that we know of.
---
what else are you going to counter with in a n+1 environment? yes, fucking rock, paper, scissors is the only way to balance in such an environment. ultimately the game can only be balanced around spending a lot of ISK to gain tiny advantages. and that´s the only way it can be balanced. capitals never submitted to this basic principle and that´s why they were always broken.
---
I dont think the previous iteration of blackout in combination with cyno mechanics is healthy either, which I thought I had clearly stated. Nor do I think there is a massive influx of players coming to a two decade old MMO. Which is why I think it's important to have a good balance for the players you do have. How much longer do the null blocs keep playing pretend wars, farming to their hearts content, and bothering with anything before they get bored because there is nothing of consequence to do? People are fighting wars that don't matter over sov they don't want on fleets that aren't fun.
---
It walked out of the airlock.
---
Blackout wouldn't have been bad if ccp had actually implemented it better, I.E depleteable resources that have to be mined and can then be used to restore blackouted local to specific systems.
---
 if no one rebuilt the transceivers in that system then it stays permanently blacked out, add bonuses to systems that are permanently blacked out.
---
 I.E increased officer spawns or forward operating bases. The resources would be a conflict driver and allow some regions to be black holes with increased rewards but increased pvp likelyhood.
---
Fuck cyno changes though.
---
Indeed this BR is the more accurate one.
---
Good fight- flew with ehfkae. Respect the fact they go for it. 
---
‘Frag fighters’ 😏
---
I do the same thing. But on an alt....in dead end hisec.
---
No words can describe this ignorance.
---
BAIT
---
Lol. No vibrations, but it was only. 4 second loop, so it played three times before I could get to silent. His voice cracked at the end of it, and if loud enough it was kind of ear piercing.
---
nah sorry but if you're willing to lose a few confessors you may be able to work out a solution
---
also check out vulfpeck.space, it's the same thing you do but in groups, maybe less isk than if you do it yourself, but faster, safer and overall less effort for you
---
You were wrong. Eve has recovered some but the blackout did permanent damage to the game and would have required years of sustained growth to get back to server numbers prevlackout.
---
It was very reminiscent of the lobby for DUST as well.
---
HTFU
---
It's actually been this way for over three weeks. I assumed it was a bug and submitted it since I never saw it noted in any patch (after triple checking it was not some sort of filter on my scanners).
---
Bethesda, competent? It just works!
---
Oh yeah it could have been that long ago, I only noticed a couple days ago when I tried to do some hunting
---
This is a pretty bad bug, it makes the instanced PVE completely safe from any potential of PVP, c'mon CCP.
---
You are welcome
---
Or he could be a serious dumbass.
---
Yeah it would be a nice addition. You can easily simulate it with an alt corp though.
---
Now lets see how many this shitshow of a reversal will cost them.
---
I am betting it will be more
---
They do exist. The bountys are about 60mill for a normal dreadnought and 100 mill for a normal titan. The faction cap spawns multiply that by some variable.
---
Bullshit of attacking people in fucking 0.5.
---
Anyone that is looking for a fun fight will definitely help you out, ask horde ask goons or test or PL
---
I mean..are you talking about one bomber, or twenty?
---
&gt; you are forgetting wormholes and the ability of people to roll them until they get they answer they like
---
To roll into a particular constellation is incredibly unlikely. Most people entering your ratting pockets are still going to have to do so by the gate.
---
The imperium was fine, everyone else was dying, that's not good for the game.
---
I only noticed because I have alts that d-scan the systems I run them in, including just outside of the filament. Just like the OP, I noticed it wasn't showing up on my scan anymore. Initially, thought I messed up my filters so turned them all off. Tried again with combat probes, nothing.
---
Which is noanime ?
---
How many people rat in 1DQ though?
---
He's an F2 button pusher who doesn't undock except for ratting and for pings from Dear Leader.
---
NPC carrier is present in level 5 missions.
---
Yes, it can be doomsday'd.
---
Not a goon thanks
---
He's got an orca in a shattered system. That's a bigballs move.
---
Okay fair point, I guess part of me want's elite content that is hard to maintain for players who don't have a large time commitment to eve and immense player skill. But I can see why locking big stuff behind game commitments that could only be achieved by people who are able to play EVE as a full time job would be a negative for the majority of the community. I guess there are plenty of ways to scale skill and time within the game. I just have to wrap my head around the idea that titans and keepstars aren't just reserved for this elite and that those players will have to seek out more nuanced displays of superiority.
---
Except that isn't at all how they get used.
---
Don't forget that the "PvPers" are mostly krabs too.
---
I'll take your stuff
---
Basically what I said in my unsub comments box was this: “fix your broken ass game and then set the rules of engagement and I’ll determine if it’s fun and worth my time.”  Bringing back local is a good step in that direction but I’m having fun again in WoW and I’m not convinced ccp is done fucking with shit so... why hurry?
---
&gt; The only real problem with cynos was invulnerable cynos in rorquals with panic in my opinion
---
No, the ability to drop capitals instantly anywhere under the umbrella is a huge problem. Cynos definitely needed a nerf.
---
I wouldn't have picked the one they went for, I would have given them a spool up time and made inhibitors take down an existing cyno when they come online. But something had to happen.
---
So we are doing exactly the same thing.
---
Yikes. Maybe the blackout made then realize their biggest user base is risk-averse krabs.
---
only null space? thanks..
---
This is a great suggestion.
---
Then why are you looking for a fight in a place where they will always drop titans on you? That is the part I don't understand from you people. You bitch about goons always dropping capitals on you but then you always go back there and kill ratters hoping to get a fight? Then after enough times of goons dropping capitals on you, you don't come to the conclusion "hey I wont get a fight here" the conclusion you reach is "we need to ccp to stop goons from dropping titans on us." You are the one who wants safer space because you don't want them to bring overwhelming force against you. And as I keep pointing you want it, and think you deserve it, but no one is obligated to provide you with the fight you want.
---
Or we can continue down your logic of thinking you get the fights you want, goons are dropping titans because they want a titan fight. Maybe you should escalate against them? We can both agree that is retarded, but you alone don't get to determine the fight.
---
So ya resort to insults, the clear sign that you aren't getting the argument you want either.
---
thx
---
are you saying someone doomsdayed carrier in lvl5 mission? acceleration gate allow that?
---
Yeah, there is a lot of gameplay that is locked behind the fleet wall, when it comes to PVP that can affect entities in a meaningful way.
---
That is like my favourite comment ever.
---
Nullsec. Most occurrences are in sites. Sometimes you'll see one in a belt. 
---
Never seen (or heard of one) in lowsec. 
---
Bring your own capital to kill it.
---
Both sides are not upset. Both sides want a viable, balanced solution that encourages both parties to get out and do things. 
---
Not completely swing the pendulum in favor of one group or the other.
---
Blackout is over sir. many pilots are ready to help you find a new corporation. Whisper me.
---
Thanks!  Although, these have less detail than OP's.  I like that it's complete!
---
5 days ago huh? 
---
God help is if they hire a woman though. Unless it gets us cat ears on ships... then maybe it's okay.
---
[Looks like someone may have modified the date.](https://i.imgur.com/GEIrkgV.png)
---
He's right.. so you only have to grind 34 Fortizars per system (system/planet dependent) .. no it's not in game.
---
CCP seagull is sorely missed tho . She brought a lot of stability to this company .
---
lv5 missions don't have gates iirc
---
I one up that with asset safety. It will saves me
---
Hopefully the Drifters; if they could ever get the AI right..
---
Salvagers should damage low powered citadels and give the parts the citadel is made of as a reward.
---
Bye.
---
btw, can i have your stuff ?
---
The problem with counting those that unsub;
---
For example, I pay for my account a year at a time.   If I suddenly “unsub” my actual unsub doesn’t happen until the sub runs out.   That could be 11 months or more from now depending if I also bought some other deals along the way....
---
I came back for blackout
---
Charge fines for space littering.. concord nukes the structure and sends you the bill for the ammo and towing the scrap out of space
---
Both sides are upset. You only have to read the forums and Reddit to see that so I’m not sure why you think otherwise.
---
Whole corp was joking about it this weekend, zero of us are surprised it actually happened.
---
Oh geezus fucking Christ:
---
1. Remove all industrial Citadels and transfer their functions to the S,M,L.  There only needs to be 3 sizes
---
2. Limit each system to ONE FUCKING CITADEL EACH GEEZUS CHRIST.  Highsec and Lowsec get a bidding system.  The corp that wins the top bid gets 48 hours of protected build time to place a citadel.  **This is a huge isk sink.**
---
3. Only 1 KEEPSTAR per region regardless of security status.
---
4. Only 1 Fortizar per Constellation, regardless of security status.
---
5. Only 1 Astrahaus per systems, regardless of security status.\\
---
6. Only 1 Citadel per wormhole space, choose wisely!
---
7. Nullsec you have to place TCU (non protected) in order to build your one fucking shiney stupid citedel.  - No bidding for Nullsec.
---
8. If the above system is implemented, you can keep most of the current timer system and time zone tanking bullshit.  One structure per system is sufficient to grind for the F1 monkey brigades.
---
9. Fuck moon goo.  Either rework it, or have a dis-ruptable transportation system to the ONE FUCKING CITADEL that can be raided by outside forces.
---
10. Carriers and Dreads can only be built in KEEPSTARS in Low and Null Security.
---
11. Supers can only be built in KEEPSTARS in Null Security.
---
While we are at it:
---
1. No local chat fucking anywhere.  Its so damn stupid.  Create an imperfect intel system where players know sorta what's around them and rewards skill of use.
---
2. Skill injection should be removed.  Period.  Fuck your stupid arguments.  Its all kinds of broken.
---
3. Capitals only effective against structures or other capitals.  Carrier Fighters should have 90% damage reduction on Cruiser to Battleship Hulls.  Carrier Fighter Bombers should have 90% damage reduction to Battleship hulls and below.  Carriers should have both FB and Fighters.
---
4. This prevents capital ratting.  Are we fucking serious?
---
5. Cyno should be to any celestial in jump range (sun, planet, moon)...or 50% more fuel cost to a bookmark including corp and alliance BMs.  That way you can get a interceptor on grid and set up your BM accordingly, or leisurely get your fleet in away from grid.  No more cyno alts.  JFs can just jump to a BM near station.  Easy fucking peasy.
---
You guys can downvote this to oblivion since its so damn cancerous around here...including the crap that gets posted here on the DAILY about trying to fix Eve.  Everything about this game is fucking sad right now....from the carebear krab community to CCP selling their fucking soul just to keep food on the table.
---
It's not even that it's so boring.. even when you win you lose, not including player burnout. Massicure a keepstar.. you get? alot of loss mails.. maybe isk positive on the killboard.. maaaybe? Too easy to put down, impossible to keep down, no incentive to do so on high end game play. Increase upkeep requirements, delete asset safety, make everything drop in loot cans. (atleast in non hs) then disallow anchoring in highsec of structures
---
Hey maybe you should try not being a goon?
---
well said !
---
And CCP fails again!
---
And people may not like the ideas, but sometimes I think its better to pitch something than to complain about current state of affairs. 
---
Like the reply, its polite yet beliefs are stated
---
There are very few things in this game that I'm incredibly passionate about, but Captain Quarters was one of them. While the first implementation was a bit superfluous, it's still provided some sort of scale that we very rarely see in Eve. That is the scale of the pilot within the ship. To me it felt like a breath of fresh air when flying around in fleets, and mining all day. Being able to step outside of your ship and genuinely feel like you were in a space station provided a depth of immersion that I sometimes miss. And while I understand a good bit of it is simply nostalgia, I honestly think the artwork and effort put into it was amazing. In a far future perhaps you might be able to consider social meeting places inside of citadel's. Something like a Captain's Quarters, with access to all the same buttons and whistles that it had before hand, but for the whole station population to instance in. Maybe even including some kind of gambling or mini games to make people want to socialize there as opposed to on Discord or mumble. Hell, I know I would play a game or two of space poker to pass the time.
---
Good stuff. I always enjoy listening to this podcast during my long drives every weekend.
---
What I am hearing is that ccp should not have reverted the blackout. The people that liked it stayed the people that did not left. Now they have managed to piss of the people that liked it and the fragile people that left won't come back. Good fucking job ccp.
---
I think one thing we can all agree on is ccp hasn't given a fuck about balancing for years and instead of adjusting numbers and capabilities to bring back rock paper sicsorss they did things that required 0 dev time and minimal thought. I really fear for the company in the long run. For a game as large as eve it is unbelieveable such little thought is given to balance and how the changes they make affect the larger picture.
---
I miss my battle barge =(
---
CCP Burger is Creative Director - slightly different title, but basically the same role.
---
Think the issue is the sieges are too frequent and completely meaningless more than some 'statement' for the larger ones. When I was up north and imperium carpet bombed the whole area, they had like 200+ raitaru's to drop .. just spam drop. You have 2 options, kill all of them or they have a tether / forward staging point, giving the attacker spamming structures targets of opportunity all over the place. And burn the defenders out.. 
---
Come week like 9 when you are bashing 5-15 structures with timers per week, you eventually have to give up or you'll lose your nerds to game burn out. And if you 'win' and blow up the cheap structures.. they just drop another one. When you reach that level of game play the 'loss' isn't much of a loss.. but the effort required to remove it .. even in friendly space is disproportionate
---
I don't see why it can't be both people on both sides upset and wanting balanced solutions. But you're probably right.
---
That's right. You nailed it. Exactly. I keep saying this. Breaking customer's toys, regardless of whether it's pixelspaceships or IRL sports cars or smartphone or whatever NEVER leads to happy customers and unhappy customers sooner or later are GONE customers.
---
I agree they both want balanced solutions - but I was disagreeing with the first comment that both sides aren’t upset. They are!
---
[My blackops loss.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/51601216/)
---
Hey dumb retard, once again nobody gives a fuck about what you have to say and Blackout was a really retarded decision for CCP to make after listing to brainlets like you.
---
So anyways to reiterate, nobody gives a fuck about your dumb essays. Lmfao blackout is gone, you're fucking shit at the game and should just biomass, and once again nobody gives a fuck.
---
I'm not here to debate shit lmfao, I'm here to laugh at dumb faggots like you that were convinced they could fix the game but instead ended up shoving it a little further into it's grave.
---
So, as I said before, lmfao black out is gone stay sad about it and biomass.
---
A piece of hate mail that my corp lead got stated with the phrase "You may suckith my testicles!". I posted the whole thing on r/copypasta actually.
---
Ahh ok. Thank you.
---
&gt; *You only have to read the forums and Reddit* 
---
found your problem
---
Just another "returning player" thing
---
Not in the context of this thread.. Sorry, but this game isn't an instant content type of game. If you find a lower power citadel you scan it then come and for the timer. Leave a seed and come back. You don't bash it blind then bitch if the timer is long.. It was literally mentioned that they bathed it then found out they had to wait, and they objectively incorrectly stated it could take 11 days in a wormhole which is false, it can only be 7days for full power even rofl.
---
Not sure what your point is, you've refuted nothing I said other than saying "sometimes you don't get it for free tho". No shit.
---
&gt; a few unsubbed 
---
heh :)
---
how?
---
ill try that in providence space by stirring asteroid belts. maybe this will summon one,will i get sansha........revenant spawn?
---
I like eve university a lot and did a couple lectures for them but I hesitate to recommend them to new players because they have a bureaucratic structure that can chase certain types of people away. I tried to join on an alt as an experienced player and was like, fuck these people by the end of their application process. 
---
Maybe they've improved their application process since then, but yeah, that's my thoughts on it.
---
Bullshit. 7,000 accounts were banned for botting in the same time period -- which, iirc, is the biggest amount ever -- and there was an instant and perceptible impact on VNI/Myrmidon botters who stopped operating the day after the blackout started. The botters I was hunting in Detorid and Wicked Creek disappeared over night. You'd be a fool to suggest those thousands of accounts don't impact the PCU drop.
---
I too am enjoying WoW Classic!
---
&gt;  when I talked to people nobody was happy to just play the game
---
Were you just talking to goons or PvE players cos I can assure you a lot of people were happy with the changes.
---
[This.](https://youtu.be/FcmWaz_UTBQ)
---
It sort of does change the point, though. You need to have options for having fun in the game that don't rely on ratting for 400 hours. (Especially if we're talking about nerfing high-end ratting solutions; people need to be able to get along without the big payouts.) 
---
For people who define their "fun" as "being part of an alliance and contributing materially to its success" we need a way for that to work where you can contribute meaningfully in a battleship/dread, or we need to just accept that titans are the way to go &amp; we should reduce their skill/mineral requirements so everyone can get one. At least that way everyone could join the "people who matter" club without needing to do vast amounts of soul-sucking grind. 
---
There's also no point saying "just go pvp in lowsec don't even touch null" - even though it might actually be the right answer: if you wanna avoid the hardcore grind, just stay out of sov. But at this point sov alliances hold most of the real players in the game. So we can't just say "don't do the sov game if you don't wanna grind 100b." We need to balance sov so it's possible to play as a good line member in a sovnull alliance without needing to 5box rorqmine 2h/day for months on end. Once that's done, we can address making it harder to 5box rorqmine for hours a day, by, say, switching to delayed constellation local.
---
I need the door open!
---
It was no big deal to me because I was wormhole experienced.
---
Ever try and explain IT to a technically disinclined person? Sometimes it just easier to say yep, reinstall, it'll fix your problem ^(or at least your computer wont work so you cant talk to me anymore.)
---
They lost trust, its gonna take some time to get players back. Look, this one is top -&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/czspb8/never\_not\_meme\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/czspb8/never_not_meme_this/)

Ahh, Thanks.

Lol

Found the mobile user
---
He needs to not worry about it. All of the hunters have quit because of a lack of targets. Krabs are all good.
---
Quick question since you seem knowledgeable. The Orca is a very expensive vessel and being unable to fit any mining equipment itself seems to not provide a whole lot of mining performance. Why would I pick that ship for semi-afk mining? I have 2 chars and I typically run combat missions on one and find something less involved for my alt. Been using mining barges, mainly my 65k EHP Procurer, just checking every now and then to dump at a local station and swat the rats away.
---
A good analogy.
---
Gottem! 
---
Oh wait you got me, got me good.
---
also please make it possible to change divisions (from a dropdown menu or something) AFTER you have clicked to place an order. it’s not a great design to cancel the order, open your wallet, then change divisions before going back to create the order again.
---
No its not. Inflation is tied to prices man. Im not trying to be a douche towards you but the CPI says we have not had any substantial inflation. In fact, when explained, we have had deflation imo. The theory is more isk means more inflation but the reality of Eve is telling us otherwise. Thats because people dont really understand how complicated the statement of more isk equals higher inflation really is. Its a long chain of events that have to be filled step by step, some of which cannot happen in this game.
---
&gt; This is an overly simplistic view
---
Wow.  You got my attention with that. as I'm in that group.
---
&gt; Very few of the nullsec PvE players are pure PvE and it's not about safety. The bulk of nullsec does both PvP and PvE.  A better way to look at it would be that these players want to be able to defend themselves and not just be fodder served up on a platter in the name of content.
---
Holy sh**!  This guy gets it!
---
However PvE improvements alone are not a 'magic-bullet', however, it could be a good start.
---
Now, it may seem strange, but I don't entirely disagree with Olmeca_Gold either.
---
&gt; The current playerbase and their favored behaviors did not emerge in a vacuum. It emerged as a result of a series of decisions made by CCP. The problem is Farmville mode Eve is unsustainable, and it's not the most profitable way to design this game over the long term. If that's true, then another set of decisions can make another set of behavior emerge. Doesn't happen overnight, but can happen over the years.
---
CAN WE MAKE IT LIKE SC2 STRUCTURES WHERE THEY GAIN HP AS THEY ONLINE?
---
This is bait.
---
RNGesus take the wheel.
---
Show me where I complained about Goons dropping Titans?  I think you're confusing me with someone else.  Probably those "you people" you are referring to.  I just want gud fites.  
---
Also the word "retarded" isn't exactly kind.  You're clearly an idiot though, so I'll let it slide.  Ask Mittani what you should say next, Goon Linemember 2157234, since we both know you can't think on your own.
---
Or you know, I am genuinely looking for people to mine with...
---
GO REALLY FAST THEN SIEGE
---
Lol, this. ^
---
I did indeed, but glad I could bring some attention to another one of your videos in any case!
---
Love watching what you do man, keep it up
---
Thank you.
---
Yep...
---
&gt; If nullsecers are going to cry until they get local back
---
We're not one faceless bloc who all share the same opinion. Much of nullsec understands there are issues with the game and there needs to be some kind of fix. Some of nullsec disagreed with CCPs fix in this case. 
---
Some people were crying sure, but not a unanimous bloc of all nullsec players.
---
It's easier to hide botting in high sec.
---
They won't be getting me back. I loved the idea of the Rorqual, and after all the time, effort and isk I sunk into buying one, ccp ruined it for me. I don't give a shit what others think, that was going to be my future playstyle, industrial, building ships etc. I'm quite enjoying watching ccps ship sink now, payback ia a bitch.
---
YOU FUCKIN RIGHT BROTHER.  
---
BLACKOUT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO HAPPEN TO THIS GAME IN A LONG TIME.  FUCK BOTS. AND FUCK CCP FOR BEING LITTLE BITCHES ABOUT IT.
---
That's now how k162s work and you should talk to exo about it if you think that's how it works.
---
You're not totally wrong though. Add scrams to the sites to remove mjding out and you fix the problem. Wormholers are literally asking for this nerf to our pve
---
You know you are enjoying a video game when you refuse to turn on the sound...
---
This is exactly what I have thought and tried to say a few times. 
---
Unfortunately every time I tried to say this, I got told to go back to highsec. 
---
I am not quitting, but I understand why some people have.
---
Having said all that, I really enjoyed the blackout, our corp did lots of fun PVP and we baited hunters who came looking for content.
---
What is the problem aside from the concerns over it being too safe?
---
Low power = No Reinforcment
---
I docked, then my client undocked somehow while I was afk. Not sure if I clicked too many times or hit the mouse on my way out or what but it was on the undock.
---
Im not against that. But the blackout was madness. You need people to actually do the thing you want them to do right? You can up the rewards massively but if people still wont do it in enough numbers then it really doesnt matter.
---
And Im saying that isnt organic. Being able to kill PvE ships is by no means not predictable. We all know how it works. Which is why I personally find it boring as fuck to do.
---
Baiting cloaky and nano ships? Have you ever tried doing that? 
---
Hasnt the biggest complaint regarding the BO been exactly the opposite? That people in NS dont gatecamp? That they dont have a subcap defense?
---
POSs existed before citadels. Safe places are not new. 
---
Subcaps never had that ability which means it doesnt affect them one bit. Caps have been heavily nerfed this year alone. To the point that the anti-subcap cap, carriers, honestly cant break a single logis rep anymore. They had one upside which was the same upside theyve had forever, fast travel. And this is yet again a question of something having to not break completely if you wanna fix it. Imo saving shit just became rather impossible and Im telling you do from experience. The current mechanics dont work. It will backfire. You can say whatever you want but if something doesnt work, it just doesnt work.
---
Nobody is forcing you to PvP in null. You get that this is the entitlement part right? We are not coming to you saying we want easier PvP. You are coming to us. Im sorry but I find it hard to somehow accept that you should be allowed to get the PvP you want in our area. We fought and fight for it. We put in hours on end doing fleets we dont really want to do. We put up with all the rules and the boredom of SOV null. We risk our ships (SRP doesnt cover all the costs except for goons) to save our people. And we do it for several reasons, one being the ability to farm the land we are fighting for.
---
What do small gangs do for NS (or the game quite honestly)? Its always "we want fights" but what do you bring to the table? Why should we even consider what you guys want? Do you see my issue? You gain the benefits of our work and you somehow want more of it. Thats entitlement no matter how you spin it. 
---
And like I keep saying, I want more players in the game so Im willing to compromise. But it has to work. Cause I see big gangs being able to hit NS with impunity just so small gangs dont risk having caps dropped on them. Things arent this fairy land you think it is.
---
&gt;Week  long sieges on every single structure mean that offences are incredibly  painful, it's hard to deal any kind of meaninful damage to alliances  outside of full scale invasions. Because of this I feel like there is a  huge dysphoria into the type of fights that can exist. You essentially  have roaming/whaling Rorqual hunting (As roaming daily content) or full  scale deployments with little else inbetween, short lived campaigns have  died.  
---
&gt;Week  long sieges also mean that every group has plenty of time to move for,  and to call for help from the rest of the universe, so there are far  fewer fights between local entitys, and more third partying from big  coalitions. Also with most defence/offense operations planned a week in  advance it's hard to surprise or change an alliances schedule. It feels  like we have gone back to post Phoebe dominion with more problems.
---
This is so true that it's painful. One of the main reasons i quit the game back in 2006 before recently coming back (but staying away from sov null because the gist of this still hasn't changed) was the lack of meaningful sov-related objectives for the smaller ship classes. It was obviously going in a direction of "you want to have any kind of effect on the sov side of things, you have to use the biggest stuff available" and that's not everyone's idea of fun.
---
So we ended up with exactly the situation you described, we either get fun but meaningless roams, or important but laggy, slow (and for some people even boring) capital-heavy escalations and slugfests.
---
So we get a "medieval siege in space" effect in how most space capturing campaigns play out. What do most people do nowadays when they invade? Drop a staging citadel, then playing "castles in space", with players assembling inside the "walls" (tether) before charging the enemy "castle" (another citadel).
---
This shouldn't be necessary and besides feeling very anachronistic for a space sci-fi game, it's also very limited in the amount of viable options it gives players to pursue. Which makes for predictable and somewhat boring gameplay in the process.
---
I've been hoping for sov-related objectives (or simply the ability to disrupt the everyday workings of the defenders' life and force some fights) that can be done with smaller, more mobile fleet compositions for ages. This would give us a reason to fight over multiple systems and spread the fights out in an organic way (and not just hunting nodes that spawn randomly through an artificial mechanic), instead of just having a single slugfest with a few hundred or even thousand players on the same grid at massive TiDi and lag.
---
I've been hoping we'd see more combined arms tactics being feasible and a move away from the "medieval siege" style and towards a "blitzkrieg in space" style:
---
* Send your small-gangers and roamers in first, to scout out the place, find vulnerabilities and soften them up a little bit (or just run a nice little diversion and pull them away from your real target).
---
* Start hitting them with medium-sized ships (from cruisers to battleships) and have them disrupt basic facilities. We had something like this with disabling station services but it felt too artificial (entosis and so on). Why can't we just roll in with 20-30 HACs, lock and shoot a station module/subsustem and just have the corresponding service be disabled/unusable in a reasonable amount of once it reaches hull, without timers? Let the defenders be able to repair it with logi (puts a fleet on the field to engage), by adding some minerals into the structure hold (material sink), both of the above (fastest option), or do nothing (the slowest option) and let it repair itself over time.
---
* Once the place is adequately disrupted, you will be making things hard for their ratters/miners and making it difficult to live and function there by keeping critical station services disabled. They want to bypass you and clonejump to where their ship stash is? Too bad, your advance party has disabled their cloning right before you jumped the main fleet in system.

Stuff like that will add a few more layers of tactical options and a more diverse set of roles for a variety of ship classes that go largely unused or used only in a few very predictable ways in the current meta. So, instead of the usual

"just escalate more caps than them until they die, and hope they don't hard-counter us with booshing bombers in the process"
---
that we currently have, we could have a case of
---
"you guys run a diversion there, you guys flank around there, once they pull forces away from the target system you guys jump in and disable this and that service..once all of it is done, then we bring in the big guns to run clean up".
---
I don't know, i think it would be more engaging and interesting than the current system. More variety is good.

Of course in the course of this, there will be a ton of fights, as the defenders have to form up and chase the attackers away. And the best thing is that they have a choice between dropping the hammer and securing their main system, or being forced to use smaller stuff to chase and catch them across multiple systems, otherwise the attackers will just GTFO and disable another of the many anchored structures 5 jumps away. So as a side effect, this might also help with structure spam and the tendency to drop caps on anything that moves (which predictably leads people to only use cloakies as a counter to caps).
---
It will also encourage people to "build tall" and turtle even more, instead of "building wide'. So just slap a hard limit of 1 structure per moon/sun/planet, adjust the anomaly spawn rate and we might be on to something.
---
People will have an incentive to spread out more (since building tall will have a lower limit in the amount of people and structures it can support), but they won't be able to consistently maintain presence everywhere they go by spamming undefended citadels along the way, since an enemy alliance will come in and render them useless every day by sending 5 roaming kitchen sink subcap fleets to disable services.
---
This provides a need to expand more, but also an inability to easily hold space outside the core systems. More back and forth, more contested space, more opportunities for fights, more variety in viable fleet compositions, more fun.
