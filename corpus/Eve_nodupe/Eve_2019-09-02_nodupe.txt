I don't know. I don't have much experience that would qualify me to FC this sort of thing. But wouldn't it be a good idea to respond to a bomber fleet with something other than big ships that get fully applied by bombers? Surely a large Null entity is capable of sending a Muninn or Eagle fleet.

I thought Evernus got canked

Was referring to this part that was said.

“I almost feel bad for the guy. This is what happens when a nullseccer gets infected with spodbrain. They rush into carriers and supers and have no idea what some basic concepts of EVE are... I suppose he won't be around long though since apparently our antics have pushed him away from EVE Online.

You're going to like this game.
---
Cool concept but it would kill the economy. There is already a surplus of ships all around eve (especially supers) which is making nothing special about them. By putting a larger emphasis on salvaging it would just make these ships even more worthless
---
As a wormholer it is much better to have it as one of your mouse buttons instead of the spacebar
---
They are going away though? I sold the few I had left when I came back after along break. Think the ones I’d left anchored ran out of fuel and got blown up years ago and I had no interest in setting up any more seeing as player stations offered plenty of research slots

it was my favourite fight in a looooooooooong time

of all the stations in new eden i once chose arton to dump my blue loot, like just set dest to the closest buy order, it's not like there exists an alliance whose logo is literally arton in capital letters amirite

How do the command burst modules (like on battle cruisers) work? What’s the best tactics/charges for solo or small 2-3 fleet?

i can do special daily report for blackout, maybe i will do it afterwards. For now im just wanna to show you full spectrum of eve history vs changes and wars :P

Please stop making fun of him.  Due to one of the worst backstab in the history of the game, he lost his cool, and got banned.  Since then he's decided to move on with his life, get active, and be his best self.  I've heard he's eating better, putting less time into video games, and excersising more, he even joined a handball league.

What’s the deal with jump clones? (How do they work these days?) 
---
Stations w clone facilities seem pretty uncommon, any particular NPCs corps to look for?
---
What is a burst projector?
---
Poor shadoo is rolling in his grave
---
Depends, but usually trial by fire is good. However not bad to use a great resource like E-Uni Wiki to learn about some concepts before you go try them
---
give it fighters and pos weapons
---
You're only truly safe inside a station. Anywhere else you can get shot. That's the beauty of this game. 
---
As a new player, you should look into joining a new player friendly corporation or alliance. There are plenty of those, either check EVE forums or check out r/evejobs.
---
The people in those will help you on your way, maybe even give you money and ships.
---
I would prefer something like Harpy or Jackdaw but I am not good in this game.
---
Eve uniwiki is good place to read on things, but imo trying things out yourself and experiencing them is the best way to learn. And of course flying with more experienced people also helps.
---
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
---
Thanks was looking for ship handouts was just wondering if I was doing something wrong or just nature of the game.  Seems like fun but man you spend a couple of hours earning enough to buy a ship and outfit and lucky if you get to fly it longer than you spent outfitting it. Seems a little rough on the newbies.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to replace.
---
When I started back in 2010, it was pretty rough. But just keeping at it because the game is fun, and joining a corporation that explained me how to play better helped me to get hooked.

Sir Molle is lookin good!

Who hurt you?

If you're in Hi-Sec and flying not so valuable ships, most people will leave you alone. if the System Security rating is 0.5 and above, its hi-sec. This means if a player attacks you, an NPC force will respond and kill them, but the lower the security (I.E. 0.5 is lower than 1.0) the longer it will take to get there. 0.1-0.4 is Lowsec, and I'd advise staying away from there for now.
---
1. There is no EVE game manual
---
2. Any EVE game manual would be obsolete after the next update
---
3. Nobody knows everything about EVE, not even the designers
---
4. Not everything there is to know about EVE is contained in the feature set
---
5. Important parts of EVE are part of the meta game, the part of EVE that plays outside of the client and cannot be defined, not even by the developers, as a ‘feature’ of EVE although it can be a key component
---
6. Inside the client there will be, it’s a given, ways to use and combine features that yield a new, never before seen result. We just haven’t found it yet. Or it may only be possible after the next update
---
7. If you wanted to acquire the entire spectrum of the skill set required to do -everything- possible in EVE, you would become: a military leader, a business leader, a supply chain manager, an economist, a psychologist, an artist, a network administrator, a database administrator, a historian, a physicist, an astronomer, a mathematician, a graphics designer, a movie director, a writer, a painter,, a web master and a musician. You don’t need to be any of these to play EVE but it certainly helps. EVE Online is a bit of an involved experience
---
If I’m full of shit no doubt somebody will chew me a new asshole for it.

Where do I see sec level?  Sorry was kidding when I said new player.  I am flying an Imicus is that considered an expensive ship. I read it was good for exploring.

Yeah. That would be great too. I was just thinking that the standard subcap massed ships would be better than what they brought.
---
you really think im one of your RvB cronies and give a single flying fuck about a wreck of mine you stole or some shit?  no buddy, im just some random person who, yes, is almost brought to tears over the effort some people put into this game over basically what amounts to pennies

My guess would be because you're basically farming newb miners, which is lower on the leet pvp totem pole then even can flipping.

Something you seem to believe the whole.fleet can do on an instant.
---
All good, props on you guys for undocking and going out to look for the good fight. 
---
Just a tip that would have won you guys the fight: When you are trying to apply the most dps possible in a turret ship, you should either use the 'approach' or 'keep at range' @ your optimal range to apply properly. What happened there is your comet pilots were orbiting at top speed and missing all their shots which allowed the Nergal to survive.
---
Naw fuck that fw shit. There's nothing on the line really. Maybe a few hundred isk but that's meaningless. I know that sounds terrible to all the supposed vets that played a long time ago when hundreds of isk was a lot, but these aren't those times. I like the idea of it and do it from time to time on my hisec alt but honestly, going out in a small roam with my corp is substantially more fun.
---
And me personally, I defend the space I play in and join small roams. Anyone who says Catch is where Brave drops big stuff is so fucking retarded, they should be slapped for speaking up. 
---
All that aside, if the politics side is so important, why are the other entities so nad at it and then complain when 1 and 2 work together? I understand Hypocrisy V is a required trained skill for redditors, but from the way people talk you would think Legacy and Imperium constitued more than half of the nullsec players. If that's the case then excuse my ignorance, but from what I've seen it's not. The problem I'm seeing is that every middle management dickhead wants to lead a gang of 20 people in a small system of no importance, while also competing with a coalition of thousands. If the Imperium and Legacy are so bad, eat some humble pie, group up, elect a few fcs and get to fucking work. Or stay fucking docked and kill a miner from time to time while calling this the best pvp game ever.

I think the problem isn't the N+1 equation there it was the lack of time to respond. If they had a week+ between winterfam I'm sure they could bring similar numbers.
---
The main problem is that nobody has really adapted to the current state of the game better than goons/legacy. They've become massive industrial powerhouses and can replace things faster than they're destroyed - and really rorquals/citadels are to blame for that proliferation.
---
Hi, I don't play eve but I did read about the casino war. I heard the Imperium was crippled by it. What events followed that allowed them to regain superiority? If you don't mind sharing, I would love to know. Thanks!

That almost looks like punching a brick wall.

Ships in Eve need to be treated almost the same as ammunition. You don't work to earn ammo and collect it because you like having it, do you? Of course not. You work to buy some ammo so that you can use it doing something fun!
---
Ships are just more expensive ammo. You work to earn them, then you fly them and need to keep in mind that it's only a matter of time before the ship is used up and you need to "reload."

Brief overview of the fight between Legacy and fraternity  
---
First lets look at numbers including renters for all sides  
---
Winterco:18k  
---
Legacy: 43k   
---
Fire: 8k
---
At first it was Legacy and Fire VS FRT ( 51k vs 18k)  
---
Frt were winning timers, so Test brought in Imperium (51k)
---
that makes it 102k vs 18k
---
Fratenity then brought in pamfam (28k)
---
so now the total numbers are 102k vs 46k
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 let me show you via this map the sides:  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cuZ2JKo.png](https://i.imgur.com/cuZ2JKo.png)

Red: Taperium
---
Blue:Panfrat

---
Lxq is 100% no caps unless you start hitting our infrastructure or your a strategic enemy like goons.

Our fcs have been told to never head shot and to down ship till you have a fighting chance vs us.

Had the same problem recently. I found an older article about issues with the launcher and multiple displays. It stated the launcher has issues when it doesn't recognize the current window position as matching the previous window position.
---
My issue was that when my PC goes to sleep it reorders the windows on the monitors. It's a common issue with Windows due to how Windows reorganizes program windows when it detects the loss of a display. I've never had an issue with the launcher before. Nothing I tried (uninstalling,reinstalling, etc.) worked. I finally let the monitors sleep and when it came back up the windows had reorganized and the launcher was displayed again. I was able to duplicate this.
---
I'm still looking in to figuring out how to stop from my windows reorganizing themselves on sleep, but it's pretty low priority because they often revert to the appropriate screen when manipulated with the window control buttons.
---
Agreed, Kiki is definitely broken. Although my point was mainly that the Nergal is objectively bad, not just when compared to the Kiki.
---
If it were the same price as other assault frigates it might have a niche as a fleet composition with Deacons/Thalias as a sort of big ship hunter (where the spool could be useful), but as it currently stands, its turbo-garbage.

EVE is in a good place and getting better every day. r/eve is in a bad place and full of trolls and edgelords that hurt the health of the game every day

First do the tutorials. Then do the career agents. I’d do them all. They’re fairly quick and give you good starter ships and some nice tips. 
---
After that you should be able to find a level 2 agent or start your exploration. Stay in high sec for now and train your skills up.

Ya, but if you do that before you've been in EVE for awhile none of those concepts would make sense.

I really am not a fan of the current bomber meta where group 1,2&amp;3 blue up for an op to hit group 4 stuff and then the next day its group 1,3&amp;4 hitting group 2. MJDing around so much is hilariously broken and needs to be addressed by CCP. Hopefully this upcoming CSM summit shakes up the stagnant HAC + Ab Bomber meta.

Rooks and Kings made some of the best Eve Videos. The perfect blend between cinematics, fight analysis and music/commentary. It's a shame most Eve videos now are just 4 minute videos with a shitty Dance music track over it, comms spliced in at random times too if the uploader is good. Jin'taan is the only person doing decent fight analysis videos it's just a shame they are of shitty T1 cruiser/battlecruiser fights.

Join RvB. Most folks loiter in cheap ships at station for anyone to lead. Even if you were to follow, join the fleet and record to see what were good to bad calls and how you would do it differently...
---
That’s what they call kikimoras right?
---
...and if we're lucky, we might manage to retain somewhere close to four percent of them for longer than a month! Probably not, though; the blackout is pretty harsh for newbros, so retention has most likely dropped even lower than pre-blackout rates.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, people showing an interest in EVE is AWESOME and I hope they all give it a try, but it's depressing knowing that CCP is going to drive 96%+ of them away within a month, mostly for the sake of padding so-called "hunters'" killboard stats. 
---
4% (or more like 2% now, I'd wager) retention means you have room to increase your playerbase's growth rate by 2400% (4900%?) just by improving the new player experience. Not that 100% retention is actually feasible, but even retaining 8% would represent a doubling of the growth rate, and as hostile as EVE is to new players, it's very easy to find ways to improve that number.
---
&gt;Naw fuck that fw shit. There's nothing on the line really. Maybe a few hundred isk but that's meaningless.
---
Well, that's the point. If you want people to fight you even when they have a low chance of winning, you have to fight them in an area where it doesn't hurt them to lose. You can't complain about getting blueballed after dropping a keepstar and then having the majority of the supercapitals in existence ready to defend it.
---
If you play to defend your space and go on small roams, then why exactly are you complaining about getting blueballed anyway? Why did you even show up to the keepstar timer in Deteroid if you just care about playing in Catch. And yes, Brave drops plenty of big stuff in catch, I've been there like twice looking for pvp, once I found a Machariel, Cynabal, and a few t2 frigs/destroyers chasing down my osprey navy, and the other time I was with a stabber fleet and we got carriers dropped on us (https://zkillboard.com/kill/76313321/). You can like brave as much as you want, but what you're saying just isn't true. Brave either overblobs you if you're in a really small group, or hotdrops you if you're in a decent fleet, unless you convo an fc and set up a fight or something.
---
As for your last paragraph, you just don't seem to understand how things work, or the history of the game beyond the past month.
---
&gt;If the Imperium and Legacy are so bad, eat some humble pie, group up, elect a few fcs and get to fucking work.
---
That already happened. Everyone in the game who wasn't Imperium or one of its pets teamed up, and half of them fought to defend the north while the other half invaded Test in the south. Guess how it worked out for them. It failed, 6 keepstars died, hundreds of billions were lost, and for nothing. Goons and their pets lost almost no space, while the north lost quite a bit, and then everythign settled down for 6 months before restarting, first with Test vs Horde in Geminate, then with Frat vs Test in Deteroid, and later with Panfam vs Goons in Tribute. With the exception of Horde vs Test, Goons and their pets won all of those handily. The only reason test lost in Geminate is they didn't have goons with them, and by themselves they aren't actually that competent. But Goons are actually pretty good at the game, you're taking their own old memes too seriously. You just need a few good FCs in order for an alliance to be good, f1 monkeys just need to be having fun and they'll be 99% effective as the best person in the game.
---
&gt;All that aside, if the politics side is so important, why are the other entities so bad at it and then complain when 1 and 2 work together? 
---
Its not, not really. Its annoying, because it stifles content, but whatever. You're just complaining about the obvious reactions to the largest entities in the game forming and unstoppable mega-coalition with more vigor than I've ever seen someone complain about test blue'ing imperium. You literally joined the largest coalition in the game (imperium + pets), and are now acting surprised when no one wants to fight you. To go back to your analogy about a fighting game, imagine there was an option to select an extremely overpowered but boring to play character. If there was no penalty for quitting a match, wouldn't it make sense to just play a normal character, and then quit to lobby whenever you found yourself in a match against the overpowered one? Because that is the equivalent of what's happening here. It isn't fun to fight the overwhelming blob of all the goon pets, so people try to just avoid it and do other stuff. When they have to fight, they make the fights as boring as possible in order to try to discourage them from happening again.
---
A good burst to use is either more resistances (shield / armor) or skirmish links to make yourself go faster or increase your tackle range.
---
It works by giving an aoe burst that affects yourself and anyone in your fleet. It also gives you a weapons timer, so you can't dock or jump gate for a minute.
---

HACs and bombers online.

Nope. We have actually attempted spider tanking with limited success. So with MWD, that is 3 modules and paying attention to which targets are DPS and which are reps.

Though the correct and most sick burn answer was "Because mining lasers don't stack", which would also be correct.

More like unsupported capitals dying to their hard counter. Literally 10 Corms could change the tides. Or any respectable amount of long range subcaps.

Yeah, I mean, how the fuck is someone flying caps but doesn't "get" remote repping?
---
They aren't.
---
cause at the time PL was alive. and had more caps and super caps than Test,  before you looked at the other allies PL had.
---
You are definitely not wrong

I own the Eve manual that came with the game

They regularly batphone goons

Oh, so like who left/quit PL?

Sorry, was just replying to this bit because I couldn't get it out of my head that anyone would think that
---
Can it detect application running and press Alt+Shift+Q ?
---
no specific corps. but they went inactive for a time (at least in terms of us seeing them do stuff in EVE news) and they've never really been seen as as powerful as they were there.
---
That was an absolutely nutty last fight
---
Crucifier navys with faction neuts are monsters if you can afford them
---
Maybe because it’s at the bottom of the industrial food chain and the devs sought to give it the smallest chance of survival while maintaining its usefulness to new and old players alike?
---
Because no one in Legacy besides TEST has or had a significant super fleet and their enemies did.
---
if they only never let Imp get a foothold in delve following WWB. Then again it probably would have just happend somewhere else. VoV
---
true, who knows how it would have been.
---
honestly, i'm not sure if we got the result here we wanted.  its fun to speculate.  but it is sad thats the last event the news sites really took notice of....its been to quiet
---
because those groups had almost 2 times the number of titans compared to us.

Taking them a while to do said conquering.
---
They put the buy orders up themselves
---
The Little Astra That Could claims another titan
---
So after 500 stealth bombers wasted the better part of 3+ hrs to make a lil dent in TEST's capfleet, TEST comes back later in the day and dunks the shit out of a FRT titan, and fully redeems themselves.
---
This really is an entertaining game. I wonder what Elo's morale pings will look like.
---
Reported for cheating; this guy clearly has some sort of illegal keyboard with three F1 keys.
---
Remove logistics ships/FAX from the game. ~chaos era~
---
Hahahah
---
I was told wardec immunity was going to solve player retention, now you're telling me the blackout undid all that hard work?
---
Ill take that trade any day.
---
Thanks for your input, Tiredofcowards.
---
One thing to consider is that some of us are so new that we don’t know what pre-blackout null was like. Ignorance is bliss and I’m really enjoying the game three months after starting.
---
Carrier was vanguard and fax was venerable
---
Strongly/cap charges
---
Do you know if it was streamed or recorded?
---
Idk what's worse the fact frat keep welping titans to nonsense or the fact test hasn't been able to take detorid fighting said silliness
---
You need the boosters to run the fit, it’s why big groups run quad boost apostles and penta boost ninazus...
---
Es and Whizz is now Lethal Injection.
---
NV has used Barghest comps out of home before, including fighting against a Loggerhead (Hawks Logger in this case)...
---
\&gt;dunks
---
more like another idiot accepted fleet invite, and apparently i hear jumped to a cyno in this random fleet invite. not sure on that part though.
---
Makes me think that frat's titan pilots are all just spies who feed shit to bump test morale lmao.
---
Ping went out right as I was heading off to bed.  First time dropping my dread(s) for real.  7 years and the firsts keep coming.  
---
I lost my first ever carrier just the other day (you were too beautiful for this world).
---
10/10, would accidentally siege again again.
---
Timezones are hard and jammers suck.
---
Top Kek
---
If we took Detorid who would feed capitals to our astra?
---
Pew pew pew
---
(Cloak up)
---
Used to play with a G13 game pad....it was like having 4 full rows of F1 keys. 
---
Was really awesome, until I realized it left me hopelessly lost when I went back to a normal keyboard layout.
---
Add angular velocity to your overview. #1 down.
---
That's great to hear!
---
So, what is your experience in EVE like? What kind of things do you do, and what kind of problems (if any) do you have? What do you like about EVE?
---
...I sound like a survey, heh. Seriously though, it would be helpful to see how things look from the perspective of one of our few newbros who actually enjoy EVE's particular flavor of craziness.
---
You need sov and an ihub upgrade for that, and the POS ones don't work anymore.
---
Doubtful you would bring as many barghs through a hole, doesnt make abusing mass any better. I guess they got humbled with that vehement dunk months ago but you'd figure NV would learn to be a bit more considerate or atleast produce a logger of their own living in a pulsar and all.

---
Newbros aren't worried about null, they are running level 1-2 missions.
---
Good. Null blackout means nothing to a new player. For a newbie the experience is better now than it's ever been, just join a small Corp. There's enough to do to keep you busy for a long long time before ever going into nullsec.   
---
And forgive the people crying about no local in null they got really used to a signal that said "go dock"in a blinking window.
---
Fair point
---
This isn't a war you rush, this is a war you savor.
---
Stronger than any force you could ever hope to muster.
---
Looks like he got owned by a fleet invite/warp and a baitadel. FRT can't even clear said baitadel. This is shades of #delve2012 when PL was taking hot shits on 319 staging undock by owning -a- and nulli with drivebys on the daily.
---
I realize it's a meme that no one on this sub actually plays EVE, but I never realized until now how true it actually was...
---
You're describing how the game worked a decade ago; these days many (most?) newbros join one of the nullsec coalitions and make their isk in mining or ratting anomalies.
---
A lot of fun is happening in the game lately. More drunken ganking than we've had for years!
---
whoa we got a bad a**
---
If they helicopter dick detorid, then FRT turtle retreats and stops feeding. Need that big feed energy to continue.
---
&gt;Makes me think that frat's titan pilots are all just spies who feed shit to bump test morale lmao.
---
I'm starting to think FRAT are a special type of NPC to provide the Blue donuts a sprinkle or two so they think the game is still going.
---
the majority of your kills are mobile tractor units.
---
No supers died on that battle report despite being outnumbered 3 to 1, the fact that people would feel safe dropping supers on top of a fleet that massively outnumbers them and really only eat a couple of faxes/dreads/carrier loses for it seems to be the exact core of the issue.
---
The Little Astra That Could has destroyed 2 major strategic assets, a few supers and probably impacted enemy moral.
---
Not to mention all the smaller ships that have died in the last few months, slowly grinding at their isk and asset supplies.
---
Looking back, I wish I had quit investing time in EVE when they added skill injectors. After 6 1/2 years of continuously having at least one account subbed, my last three accounts go dark on the 16th, 18th, and 19th.
---
blackout made the game interesting, all they gotta do is fix the 5 other things and they're set
---
Why would blackout be harsh for newbros?
---
Why would people in their first month be going to nullsec like that?
---
If someone exists to tank t1 miners, meh. When I think hunter, I think people hunting supers, rorqs, etc. I guess they're still krab ships, but eh.
---
It’s been a positive experience so far. One of my buddies who played a few years back got myself and  3 others friends to all start up the same time. Of those 5 total, I’m the only one who is still active. The rest are playing vanilla WoW now (sigh). 
---
I began by following Eve Uni’s “start here” path with all of the tutorial and career agent missions, then actually joined Eve Uni as my first Corp and ran in some fleets with them while running Level 1-2 missions and mining gas on the side. I started to get a little bored with Eve Uni, they’re very doctrinal. It serves a purpose in teaching new players and I appreciate that but I was ready to move on after two months. I joined a much smaller Corp two weeks ago and now live with those guys out in null sec. 
---
My biggest gripe is honestly minor - travel time. I’d rather not spend 30 min jumping between places to even start my gaming session.
---
So cool, do you know if it was recorded ? YouTube?
---
Back when this war started my corp had a meeting and I said in order not to burn everyone out completely and taking tz into the equation a slow war would take a year. It's looking like I'll be close to correct by the time it is over.
---
And they're having fun doing it! How dare they!
---
Probably not the standard no stupid questions but....
---
Something I became involved in recently gave me the EVE bug again and I'm thinking of returning.
---
What has changed since early last year that I should be aware of? (I think I quit just after the Triglavians and Abyssal Deadspace was added)
---
It's not like capitals and supers are meant to be force multipliers or anything.
---
actually they didn't ualx was an even fight and test bat phoned goons.
---
Doesn't hitting space activate the chat window? That will actually increase your chance of accidentally typing in local. Unless that function gets unbound when you rebind space.
---
Are people really not aware of how aggressively the big nullsec coalitions recruit? Pretty much everyone has a new player corp/alliance, and some of them (\*cough\* horde \*cough\*) will take anything with a pulse.
---
Goons even recruit people before they start playing EVE (or at least they did as of last time I checked); they recruit SA forum members into the game and their alliance at the same time.
---
It's very common for new players to get their start in EVE by joining a nullsec entity, deathcloning out to their new staging system, and hopping in a ~~VNI~~ Myrmidon to run havens. 
---
It's a mutually beneficial arrangement - the coalition gets warm bodies and the new players get free ships, lucrative nullsec anomalies to rat in, large numbers of other players to play and chat with, fleets to participate in, the protection of their coalition's standing fleet, and plenty of learning opportunities from both individual players and actual newbro training programs.
---
It's a much more appealing deal for new players than flying around aimlessly in hisec waiting for Code to suicide gank them.
---
You can’t just spend all your time chasing around goons and hell camping them. If that tactic worked goons would have died several times already.
---
The solution is simple. 
---
Recon Supers and Titans! They can warp cloaked and be as dangerous as those pesky Cloaky frigates!
---
If they're cloaked in Null and are AFK, if a decloak timer is implemented people would just logoff and log back in and cloak. They don't appear in local anyway, there is no need to Actually be AFK and cloaked in null anymore.
---
Good deal; sounds like you pulled yourself up by the bootstraps and properly educated yourself in the ways of EVE. If you're smart enough to do that, you're probably going to enjoy EVE for a very long time - once you get past the steep beginnings of the learning curve (which you seem to have done already), it's a rather fun and rewarding game for veterans (don't get me wrong, it's still 'boring' most of the time, but the fun parts more than make up for that).
---
Travel time CAN be annoying, yeah, but I'm pretty sure you are already figuring out the ways of minimizing it. In the unlikely event that you need help in that area...look into travel ceptors, jump clones, death cloning, nanos, and hyperspatial rigs/implants/low slots.
---
&gt;not flying 5 rep 1 cap guards/basis
---
And 2 minutes before that... [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78750670/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78750670/)
---
Balls gotta drop before capitals do, we just have created a game of  coward coalitions is all.
---
Last I heard at least two were destroyed, one during anchoring and one when online. There were probably others before those.
---
It'll be the usual scenario: Wait till the numbers and right then flash blap it repeatedly until TEST's batphone call goes unanswered.
---
The age of capitals is the new frig.
---
I am just happy to know that stuff is dying
---
That's what the bombs are for
---
Congratulations to you and your corp. You're doing Bob's work.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78745444/
---
Why hide your name n shit when kill is gonna be on zkill? You're one of the two ashimmus.
---
Yes, and that really isn't the intended state of the game.
---
I don't think so unfortunately. I didn't see any A/V equipment in the room.
---
Not true. Test was outnumbered by about 30 titans until the first goons showed.
---
Jammers are pretty broken right now.
---
Is it ranges? On grid? Or anywhere?
---
Ranges from your shio
---
Before you go, can I have your stuff?
---
Scythe / scimitar desperately needs one mabye burst and definitely a pass on all ships that haven't gotten the new FX and animations also titans
---
I can only guess thats also a matter of logistics: how many muninns/jackdaws do you need to bring to counter 300 bombers and how fast can you organize such a amount of pilots. Another question is, what are the expected losses from such a fight if you use supers, munnins or jackdaws.
---
[Thank me later.](https://i.imgur.com/JHmzBUk.jpg)
---
Batphones PH, cries when Legacy batphones Imperium.
---
Damn goons are ruining the game; they won't let us out-blob Legacy.
---
arton creodron has npc buy orders for blue loot unless those tryhards found a way to put up year long buy orders which wouldn't surprise me tbh
---
Forming the required subcap numbers out of standing fleet isn't particularly viable so you have to upship to make up the inherent numbers disadvantage of Properly pinged and pre-formed fleet vs standing fleet
---
Ahhh the hell camp that only existed in the minds of legacy
---
That is true. I guess I might be a little jaded myself after years of negativity in this sub. I guess I'm a bitterbittervet now? Though I do think you are right that for the past couple of months there has been a pretty Stark tonal shift in the sub. Especially in the past 2-3 weeks.
---
The TDs should have optimal scripts loaded.  
---
And take any of the popular ranged cruiser up doctrines (eagles, feroxes) and they will force of the kikis easy. Depending on your numbers you'd probably want to call free fire in that match up.
---
My concern is after winterco is defeated which they will be (i mean they are outnumbered/out isked) what's left? Test wont fight imperium panfam is way back there are they going to farm little guys?
---
Just goes to show how fucking cancerAIDs Hilmtard's current sov mechanics are.  If it's that hard to take a region from literal retards, imagine trying to wage an offensive war against competent people.  And anyone wonders why all of null is blue.

while i find streams about eve dull as shit.

his books about eve are better than the actual game.

If you want i can sell you a whiptail for 300m :)
---
that's funny... isn't that exactly what goons do to all their now dead enemies?
---
What's your in game name?
---
well done test. i'm no fanboy, but I hope you continue to dunk those guys hard. this wasn't another sneaky fleet invite was it?
---
Jumping on the next flight home! Fuck beer and sunshine am gonna play eve , gj bae ;*
---
&gt; blackout made the game interesting
---
but did it make it more fun?
---
Lazy McLazington
---
Is 260 dps a personality ?
---
Good on you! I'm doing even smaller scale stuff, but loving the hunt and gatecamp fear even more. Blackout is a great start imo, or at least a great experiment.
---
Legacy is still a ways behind those guys yet, but I reckon they could have done pretty well...or jut employed snuff rather than goons, that would have been more interesting. Calling goons is basically saying you don't want to fight.
---
Bud, somehow you look younger than you did 10 years ago.
---
astronomer - hunting stars minigame
---
musician - little bees, im in a rokh, sitting in a bubble with you, i stole from a goon (and i liked it) etc.
---
painter - art that supports your side wins capsuleer hearts
---
Yes, it gets unbound. Each shorcut can only be bound to one action.
---
What now dead enemies? Because I can’t think of any of them that really died completely, even Bob came back as NC., and Bob was never really camped into npc null or lowsec for a significant period of time. .
---
Yes. Definitely.
---
at first I was like "oh no, not just comet killing", then I was like "OH". Very nice work, my dude! Care to share your fit?
---
People joining groups like goons, test, and panfam are far more likely to stay. You are dense as fuck if you think random alliance #46673369 is going to help someone figure out 0.0 in the age of supercaps. If anything they need a decent tutorial, quickly scooped up by training corps, showered in isk... and shown a few big fights.
---
Widow pairs perfectly with whiskey...
---
So are we just ignoring the 3 rorq losses those supers were trying to save so you look like you have a point to make?
---
wait, someone found razor?
---
Joined a fake standing fleet and jumped to a cyno blind.
---
If your not a f1 monkey yes.
---
This is amazing.  In the span of three comments we've gone from not killing Frat fast enough to killing them too fast.
---
Fun stuff!!
---
A tiny blops group sounds exactly like my cup of tea, but my timezone/play hours are all over the place :(
---
Studies have shown that typically, when a parent abuses a child, that child will grow up and is likely to abuse their children in the same way.
---
TEST is a child of goons but raised by PL. So, what do you think is going to happen when frat gets evicted, to all those little groups hanging out near there?
---
And if you are an f1 monkey, it actually didn't change all that much.
---
A LOT of people are interested in EVE.  Until they play it.
---
Kinda, but not really? Most of these big feeds are happening in their staging by idiots who accept fleet invites. No amount of turtling and retreating can stop that level of stupid.
---
This a thousand times over. The level of alarm clock necessary to dig frat out is just stupid.
---
Triglavians now invaded k-space and there are systems that are "invaded" hence the name Triglavian invasion. It's something like incursions. Plus there are now a triglavian assault frigate, command destroyer, heavy assault cruiser, logistics cruiser and a battlecruiser
---
Holy shit ))
---
Hey BRO, you think this is a joke? You just assailed a memeber of Test! You may be laughing right now but you're screwed BUD, so screwed you don't even know it. It doesn't matter where you run, we'll have hundreds of shield titans up your ass by the end of the day. And they'll be led by the most hardened fcs in the game, so don't even get any funny ideas about fighting back with whatever feeble fleet you can muster. Enjoy EVE while you still can, NERD.
---
bro 😎💪
---
That is such a privileged whinge.
---
Cap is more important than resists in fights like this. The fit is designed to sync the cap booster cycles with the rep cycles. This allows the pilot to be able to run local and remote reps while completely cap dry (10 bhaals neuting you). It's the only way faxes can be used in wormhole space otherwise they'd simply neut the fax so it can't rep and then shoot the fleet now that it has zero logi.
---
Except it was legacy who first batphoned goons.......  
---
which made it a group of 102k players, vs a single coallion of  12k
---
Frt then brought in pamfam who are 28k,
---
So let that sink in... they were nearly 8:1 outnumbered before bringing in pamfam, and combined we are still nearly 3:1 outnumbered
---
Really makes you Think aye
---
Our hours are too lol
---
LeGAYcy amirite
---
Real answer: tapi leaderships likes bluing everything for easy wins. time has proven this
---
I don't think anyone is missing this. The point is you light the cyno offgrid, bridge in, they warp to fight. You need to get staged before yeeting into a fight. 
---
Or you suicide your recon at 0 to enemies to be right there. Either way, intent of change is to knock projection of heavier force down a peg.
---
The only winning move.. is not to play\~\~
---
Going to be honest Frat. Need to pull their heads out of their arses. O3 is just camped happily by Test constantly and no attempt or fleet is up stopping them.  It's not even a big hostile fleet either.  Drag bubbles are left etc etc..  I've never seen anything like it.
---
I heard that there were 2 fleets, so with the initial tackle the defenders didn't see the whole picture? That's the beauty of the blackout though.
---
Can he interact with the cutouts?
---
If yes: report him
---
If no: fair game
---
what force are the capitals multiplying? 
---
Like it's 90% capitals on the defending side, it seems to me like they're not so much multiplying an existing force as providing that force themselves.
---
The drone regions become a game preserve like catch was years ago.
---
Their are multiple definitions of force multipliers. In some cases 1 ship equals 10 or 15 and in others 1 ships allows a smaller force to need less logi or some shit like that.
---
They could also invade what's left of GOtG.

Id rather they not. The amount of fun i had in 03 the last weeks is unlike any other in eve up until now. Its literally press undock and content. Sometimes just small gang/ganking, sometimes small fleet skirmishes and to make the ball perfect blops drops on the unsuspecting (non)capital ratter.
---
At this point it's any mans game. TEST now has super projection in Detorid. That's something that Winterfam had before and was tilting things in their favour. Right now between TEST alone and Winterfam, based on the experience of their FC's and pilots, I think the dino has a small advantage.
---
Time will tell though - this is military speculation. Winterfam can muster up similar numbers to TAPI-swarm but they for the most part have a less experienced super fleet compared with the exception of NC. and PL core groups.
---
"Chat window"
---
That was quite literal.
---
That's the reality of Hilmtard's sov vision.  Even against crayon eaters, it takes forever to make any progress.
---
Why wasn’t your Corp/alliance banned for using Near2 or intel bots?
---
so 2 full fleet's of bombers, set up to deal with supers on-grid get jumped into by literally what their setup to counter and they get away killing what there planning to kill with 3 to 1 numerical advantage like that seems the bare minimal of what a counter should achieve, there is also the absolutely stupid numbers issue there how many people can really field like 500 bombers ? like what 10 groups?
---
Killing frigates that have little speed (afterburning) and little range is pretty easy (think RLML). The whole bomber/kikimora format is based around nulltards thinking "moar caps" is the solution to any problem, and thus we are bringing ships that are hard to hit by HAW dread and fighters.
---
my corp?
---
Rorquals would have a button that makes them completely invincible when under attack.
---
I have no ifea what the whos line out of a hat means, but since we're on suggestions...
---
I don't get, why there's still no neural remap for 50 plex...
---
to sum up your comment, "people who prepared for what they knew they were getting into were able to do what they planned to do", and this is somehow unfair your mind....
---
zinggg

I've been saying this for years. a year between maps is pretty dumb.

[Scenes from a hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqrwSLCsaA)

"I don't think anyone is missing this. The point is you light the cyno offgrid, bridge in, then warp to fight"
---
the amount of time it takes for you to get into system and into warp give the people you are warping into a day and a half to put up a drag bubble.
---
"  If you fly through frat space and tackle *anything* they throw up a cyno and a titan / supers come pouring through. "
---
This is a discussion about POST cyno change, you are talking about PRE cyno nerf...
---
Sorry to short circuit your REEE
---
Totally get it!
---
Dont wanna be that guy but the kikis would eat any small subcap hull alive and anything bigger than a cruiser would get mwlted by that amount of torp bombers. Also the time needed to form enough numbers to beat THAT amount of bombers and move them would mean all rorqs would be long dead before any help could arrive.
---
The response fleet wasn't small, had those people bridged in a good ship and not jumped in a bad cap, the result could have been different...
---
Weird, it's like you read what I said, then explained it back to me again.
---
Goons and thinking lol
---
Force multiplier as the name implies would be ships you're fielding to increase the effectiveness of an existing force, the moment you have ships you can field that are just 10/15 times as effective as other ships in the game well why field anything else?
---
I don't know if this is true - but based on OPs original statement it sounds like the alts are using a memory reader to D-scan on gate fire to get additional intel. If these accounts are reading memory to get any information or trigger an action its against the TOS
---
This subreddit has a ton of people interested in Eve, many of which don't play the game.
---
Yeah Krojew has completely disconnected himself from the Evernus, and it's actually few days back the original api tokens for Evernus have (probably?) been revoked, because of site expiry. 
---
Importantly it's open source so as long as there is someone who really wants the app running it will run. 
---
http://evernus.anver.ee/
---
For linux bois I got link to his sources for compilation.
---
About time we got some new incursion like content :)
---
Just assumed you were with SkillU based on flare... you know ... the Corp that once held the north and a renting empire and used intel bots to feed intel about every ship entering / exiting the region.
---
23rd stupidest question later its time to find a new corp to start over and somewhat repair your ego amd pretend it never happened.
---
Don’t ever assume my Corp/alliance again
---
Its like you read the half of my post you wanted to talk about and ignored the part that pointed out you were wrong.
---
I know there's a lot of hate for Near2, and other such apps, among certain sub-groups of EVE players. However those apps only work because CCP themselves programmed the client to feed them data. It would make no sense for them to ban people for using that data. If they wanted those apps to stop working, they could very easily make that happen, without having to ban a single person.
---
Yeah, initially it was Bomber's Bar and V0LTA hitting the three rorquals. Then at around the time they jumped in their four faxes, just about everyone besides goons started showing up for the feeding frenzy. There was like, five seperate fleets in the end, I think?
---
Best part was Mar5hy telling people to hold dps, some nerds complaining about "but kills", only for Mar5hy to later go "see, this is why I told you to keep a few of them alive" as a shitton of Test titans and supers get jumped in XD
---
Its has been around for a long time, people just streaming for intel. And the EULA is a bit meh, pretty much everything gives an unfair advantage if used properly.
---
Not saying its good or bad, just sayings its always been in the game in some form or other.
---
Lol, are you mentally ok?
---
The real question is - how many capitals have to die before Fraternity stop falling for all those fleet invite, squad warp etc tricks?
---
I mean streaming a single client with its overview displaying the gate grid/entire client is cool. I don’t care about those streams and there’s many of them.
---
Clipping and condensing down 5 clients to strictly display gates and overviews of incoming traffic is pretty shitty
---
Because a solar system is big and 3 ships worth a total of 250m can hold a force worth trillions in place. A ship can only be on one grid..
---
Make newb ships just a little more relevant.  Make newb ship 1v1 and 2v2 arenas in highsec border systems.  Give a mentoring system some small perks for low skill players to help out people who are brand new to the game.  New players need some sort of game to play so they can start to figure out how the game works.
---
You don't need dscan to show player names and shiptypes. They always show up on the overview for at least a couple of seconds, even if they are cloaky. So assuming he's got the audio settings tweaked to make gate activations loud, people watching the stream would just have to listen for that, and then wait for the newcomer to move and they'll see what they are in.
---
Thinking braves numbers mean anything when they haven't kicked anyone since 2014. That's 10k minus.
---
Who the fuck trusts Snuff?
---
In my opinion, leadership and the trust that those who remained had in them to lead us out. Plus we did not lose our super capitals or titans so our combat power was not completely demolished. Our enemies lost the will to follow us around and consolidated their win and allowed us to rebuild bigger and better. 
---
Mittani during the Casino War began to have weekly meetings with his whole alliance to let everyone know what is going on and the direction the alliance is taking. He has continued these to this day, says a lot about the type of Alliance leader he is. Probably the best in the game at it.
---
Imagine getting angry at someone taking your flair bait instead of laughing.
---
This is what happens when you let the enemy have a keep in your region. Supers tits and hell dreads  can fuck anything in range all those cyno jammers are doing is delaying the inevitable.
---
Yea, I was kinda wondering 'Is this in arghpee where we laugh at how bad it is, or is this guy 100% nutsbug crazy?'
---
As long as you stick to high sec hacking/data sites you shouldn't die, as players can't kill you there without committing suicide and they don't have rats.  Profit is pretty bad because its so safe though, but its good to learn.
---
For exploration you really wanna go to dangerous space as soon as you feel comfortable with the basics; there are youtube guides that can give you an overview on how to be as safe as possible.  In Explo, you WILL lose ships.  However, the starter frigs (imicus in your case) are fine for ninja explo, and they're cheap.  It may seem expensive now, but one good relic site in Null can yield you 50+M.  That's a lot of replaced Imicusesii, and eventually you'll get good enough at it to not lose many ships.  
---
Once confident and skilled enough (and omega), you should move on to covert ops or an astero.  Being able to warp cloaked makes it MUCH harder to die once you know what you're doing.  This kind of exploration is one of the best money makers for solo players with low capital.
---
A lot of people do the same thing, even if it's not as neatly set up as that dude has it.
---
You can easily get the same effect by just having the clients in small windowed modes, and positioning them creatively. No other software required. There's not much practical difference between that and what this stream shows. All it is is... neater. It doesn't show any additional info, or show the info it has in any more advantageous way.
---
I suppose CCP could try to ban streaming things like that, but I don't think they'd have a lot of luck enforcing it.
---
PL,  Winterco, plus Skillu vs Legacy. Who earphones who first again?
---
He is not using anything to cutout the clients though, he is just using OBS to display parts of his monitor. In theory, that layout could also be archieved by window placement and just streaming the full monitor. OBS/twitch is outside CCPs jurisdiction.
---
Everyone seems to forget it wasnt Legacy vs PL. It was Legacy vs PL/Winterco and Skillu. They were outnumbered.
---
Yeah. 3 months seems like it would be better for enforcing the commitment but also actually having the thing used by more than the min-maxers that can commit to a whole year!
---
Like, I might use a remap for just a month of faster training if I knew I'd only be "punished" for 2 months afterwards.
---
&gt; If CCP did a Whose Line is it Anyways "Scenes from a hat" with game changes 
---
If?
---
yes.
---
First, I clearly stated that I was talking about large coalitions, not "random alliance #46673369".
---
Second, any alliance that actually recruits a new player is likely to help them learn the ropes; the fact that random idiots like you cry about the existence of supercapitals has no effect on the fact that it is in virtually any EVE entity's best interests to help and educate their newer members. 
---
Finally, one of us is, indeed, "dense as fuck". Last I checked, though, I was still scoring well within the genius range on my IQ tests, so you might want to reconsider a few of the details of your "dense as fuck" statement.
---
Logistics ships are given back their mining and cargo bonuses.
---
both ashimmus looks like one, multiboxing guy
---
Anything that gives lifelong safety while afk undocked in null shouldn’t exist
---
That would have made it even more interesting )
---
,the same way you deal with supercapitals thinking is hard
---
Yet people are so quick to bitch about that one aren’t they
---
My first sentence covers that..
---
Because in more clear terms, CCP has limited this to using programs that allow clickthrough and input broadcasting as being the issues.
---
So long as each input is 1 action, and you have to properly switch to a client to give it an input, then it's fair game.
---
Using just the EULA you linked, they use that wording to justify claims against any kind of app, that doesn't mean it is enforced like that. As it says, they MAY enforce their rights.
---
This is mainly because what is considered an "unfair advantage"? Is using a corp discord to coordinate out of game an unfair advantage? Probably, but banning that would be crazy.
---
Muninns btw
---
Yeah, my flair doesn't match my corp, but, even with the REGULAR comments people give about it, I don't get mad at them.
---
Honestly grats.  More things need to die in eve
---
That will only happen with more fights, which there are becoming less and less of with the changes...
---
Keep it up and good luck
---
is that the narrative  that Taperium is telling their line members now??
---
that this war with legacy vs frat started when PL hit catch 3-4 years ago?  (and that was just to get better range in provi)
---
and by big fight you mean PL+Skill+Frt vs Legacy which were even numbers, who brought in goons
---
Surprised that this didn't included the forever war that mitanni say's goons are on, or the constant invasion that Test go on about
---
Particularly if you can bait them into a fight (attacking an mtu or mobdep) and having back up to escalate.
---
Soz, quite late on this reply.
---
If you uh, look into his post history he was quite quick to join sides in the while Brisc fiasco. Probably a bit drunk if you ask me.
---
It came out that Brisc was innocent and I have not seen, though it may just be me, a retraction or apology on Olmeca's part.
---
I don't see anyone beyond redemption, I would just like to see him fix that mistake on his part. Would be pretty cool I think.
---
Or I missed it somehow and I am being really dumb.
---
Okay, now run them as a cutout that is 3 inches by 3 inches. How is that relevant if you don't have a memory reader that logs the info?
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Is he actually there? Only thing twitch dont like is afk streams and ccp only cares about botters or input broadcasters. With that many accounts, he just makes ccp happy cuz it means money
---
I don't think they're trying to take anything. I just think they want GFS
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
There is no need to d-scan at all. He's got the overview in plain view on those cutouts. The player name and ship type will be clearly visible for however long they stay uncloaked and/or on the gate.
---
Always willing to arrange some preplanned stuff with you guys.
---
Where exactly did you "hunt"? Ever heard of a region called Kalevala
---
It's camped by TEST during US prime time, not CN prime time. Which means at any given time when it's camped Legacy has 2 times the numbers that FRAT has.
---
Only recons and black ops can light cynos
---
&gt; (most?) newbros
---
hahahaha
---
no
---
I have it has M3
---
If you are just AFK in a safe you can get scanned down. People who do exploration can call in combat probers if they find an enemy ship on scan and just kill the AFK.
---
You forget the part where we also slaughtered partizans and he pinged them they are not good enough
---
Guess what if you see someone and want to talk to him you can still use local. I don't see why you need to see someone in local to talk to him. Who even talks to random people in local who are docked and out of dscan?
---
And remember to name your ship "Ged Sinak's Punisher" or "LSC is Recruiting."
---
Lone neackbeard like you.
---
we've come a long way from dropping blops on afk cyno ships in outer ring
---
how the times have changed
---
okay, the mining bonus pff. but to give a cargo bonus makes them a bit more legit for small gang stuff if they can hold more cap boosters. i know the flavor is linked, but the effect COULD be there
---
Its camped by Test ALL the time. Test are not just US TZ.  I know I've seen it.  It's certainly camped EU time too.  You have to remember Frat/Winter is no longer just chinese either.
---
Also these gangs camping are like 10/20 people it's not hundreds.
---
https://youtu.be/ufQ4OqI30e8?t=128
---
What?
---
Where did the bombers touch you?
---
This isnt CCPs fault its down the players how politics  go.  Players cant shout sandbox one minute and then get the pitchforks out for CCP the next not on this matter anyway.
---
However..Yes sov mechanics is a pain I mean what this is the 3rd major iteration of fixing Sov apparently with players and CSM input and it's still not right.
---
All these timers are just ridiculous to take a system, and even worse than the old POS sov mechanics especially with citadel spam.  At least before you just had the stations you could take.
---
Citadels are way way way too cheap by 10x but yet CCP refuse to anything.  They must make a serious change.  Citadels are massive space stations and cost the same as a decent fit tengu.  That's utter madness.  An astra for example should be like 20b not the stupid 1b they are now.  Old stations with less capability was like 50b.
---
It's now ridiculous that a super is 10b in Delve.  Holy jesus
---
Hint: Nothing you can use in space requires even a single PLEX to produce.
---
Unless your only way to get items is to buy them in Jita, there are a lot of options to move forward.
---
Until morale improves...
---
Allow any and all star systems to change sovereignty and sec status.
---
[idea]
---
Swipe left on skill to apply skillpoints.
---
A look at your corp's killboard shows that majority of that 1T isk killed is from long before the blackout.
---
No, your fingers should be hovering on shift + ctrl to deselect the assholes who broadcast their t1 frigates in a mach v mach slugfest
---
TAPI had a stash of 600 dreads so...
---
Boris Johnson looking casual
---
&gt; That would have been a Great War to see unfold. If Legacy is so strong, why did they batphone goons?
---
I think that you already answered your question.  And the answer is, of course, Legacy didn't want a great war to unfold.
---
Dam, so I joined in the wrong era of EVE where the elite pvpers come to Reddit to talk shit but don't actually back it up. 
---
Welp, there goes my hopes for joining one of those legendary fights you read about.
---
Watch the stream dude, its D-Scan... "nothing found"
---
Exactly.  Using a battlcecruiser or hac to push of what is considered a t1 destroyer.
---
It's not a healthy ship for the game.
---
What a fantastic group of autists
---
Lowsec IS the joke
---
And what happens when you drop dreads on a titan/super ball?
---
Test also found this is how you lose a shitload of dreads.
---
I thought CCP selling EVE to the Koreans was supposed to save EVE
---
Wrong
---
I jumped 2 dreads into UALX.. First time I jumped I had max red max blue for one jump.. My dread spawned in 1/4 structure
---
I don't think any response fleet would have survived 600 frigates, unless in caps ofc.
---
I appreciate that. Maybe it doesn’t cover all of the features that were since added?
---
&gt; You're full of shit.
---
You guys never disappoint :-)
---
To better understand and appreciate EVE’s expression.
---
Any post that has 'this is why EVE is dying' and doesn't include 'hilmar' is fake news
---
Who said I was mad?
---
Used to do pvp around factional warfare moved up to otosela 2 jumps out of horde space it’s easy to get to with PvP on demand if you can get through the initial bubble in molested and it’s only  8 or 9 jumps or so from amma so no need to move all your stuff
---
Do exploration and make rigs from the exploration loot you gather.
---
Especially T2 rigs are really profitable to make from the explo loot from nullsec/wormholes
---
Can't even tell what's the most broken: ECM or Nergal.
---
Asking for a fit, is the same as asking to sniff his underware
---
Learn the game mechanics, dude. The overview says "Nothing Found" when it's empty. Dscan says "No Scan Results"
---
Please explain.
---
UNBAN GARMON 2020!!
---
AB, mid range frigs are no danger to LR MWD HACs with a competent FC. The issue here is not lack of doctrine that work, it's the lack of competency if the average F1 pusher to execute them...
---
Can i ask if you kill them who are you going to fight?
---
Risk averse gameplay will find a way. Who would have thought.
---
The Rorquals died before the supers hit the field
---
EVE desperately needs a manual 
---
I was trying to explain a more experienced player the other day, that relying on practice , bad youtube tutorials, a knowitall corp members can only take you so far. 
---
Old "good ?" days complex games like EVE were coming with hundrends pages manuals , nowdays companies have become too lazy. 
---
To top that, EVE has hands down the worst tutorial I ever found in a game, teaching you close to nothing. 
---
Unfortunately there is not an up to date manual, the closer you can find is 
---
[http://www.isktheguide.com/](http://www.isktheguide.com/)
---
Even though its vastly outdated , I highly recommend it because its not only the fact is a manual that takes you by the hand and teaches you EVE step by step and make the game 10 times easier. It's the fact that is so well written. Of course the fact that is no longer maintained maybe shows I am in the minority of people that does not like learning from practice , tutors and youtube tutorials. For me nothing comes close to how fast I can learn from a good old fashioned manual. 
---
Yesterday after a full year playing EVE I learned something I should have learned day 1 from the in game tutorial, youtube tutorial, practice or corp member. EVE has tons of youtube tutorials, a massive wiki, tons of people willing to help newbies but it shows how a manual is simply irreplaceable. 
---
EVE is a struggle to learn because how badly is designed, being overcomplicated mess for no reason and sub standard documentation. 
---
If I have not found the ISK Guide manual , I would have quit like 99% of people who try the game, the first month. The ISK Guide however gave me a very good idea about the overall style of the game and even though vastly outdated it was super easy to read because I could always go to the wiki to find the latest info. 
---
The manual is free and touches all areas of EVE, not just making isk as the title implies.
---
I did not ready everything because I prefer to fill the gaps learning from practice. So I dont use is as a bible but as a starting guide.
---
If the big blocks want to help eve then give up.cloud ring,curse,Vale of the Silent
---
Im sory but who is xix
---
When it comes to relic sites, dont bother with high sec. Go null sec or wormhole space, there a typical relic site will land 50 mil isk worth of loot. Yesterday one gave me 88 mil loot. 
---
Be prepared to lose ships though, however when you make 100 mil per hour , losing a couple of 5 mil ships wont matter much. 
---
Also bare in mind that this game is very skill orienated, game skill and player skill. So make sure your scanning skills are as high as possible and also you ask a lot of questions to understand the inner mechanics. 
---
Overall nothing beats good old relic hunting, you can do it in a dirty cheap so its ideal for beginners and people super low on isk and makes a ton of isk.
---
Of course that means also that it attracts a lot of PVPers which may not care about your ship, but they do care about the loot and the satisfaction of harvesting your tears. 
---
You shield is constant DScan, Zkillboard and overall playing it smart. Dont get greedy even if you are in a system full with relic sites secure your existing loot to a station and then go after them, or you will be providing tons of tears to your predators.
---
If you follow this simple advice you will soon be bathing in isk. As always practice is everything.
---
so the supers were meaningless... sounds more and more like they are not so over powered after all, and the current cynos were unable to save the.
---
Spammed login, jumped into mumble to hear "siege red good work"
---
  :(
---
  5 min sooner I would have helped
---
&gt;heck that hellcamp can arguably be called the thing that "killed" PL  
---
  
---
Both B-R where it became clear that they aren't unbeatable anymore aswell as the introduction of Fatigue which killed a massive part of their playstyle qualify as "PL-killers". Your imaginary hellcamp which they broke out from on the first attempt does not.
---
You just said we're not winning fast enough...
---
If CCP really wants chaos then why not lift all bans (maybe over a year old). If they break the rules again then they get banned again. But their accounts would be known and watched.
---
Lol
---
They really are.
---
Glorious bastards
---
Wormholes no longer need to be scanned down and Thera has local visible.
---
They do seem to be getting more popular now.  They're pretty much the only way to operate subcaps in a 0.0 infested with supercarriers, so there's that.
---
Simple and this is what i've heard from people in winterco. O3 is not the chinese home area so they don't care. Part of the reason west detorid is geting hammered but east is fine is because the chinese don't live in the west it doesn't affect them so they don't care.
---
Awesome! I’m omw
---
I said it's taking a while i never said hurry up. If its truly prolonged for content then it makes sense. I know that now i didn't before.

also they whored on a keepstar and a bunch of capitals in december 2017
---
Don't listen to this bullshit. EVE players like to pretend EVE is a "ruthless space survival where you can be attacked at any time" because that makes them feel like badasses in comparison.
---
The truth of the matter is that unless you do something stupid, you will never - literally NEVER - be attacked by another player.
---
It would be best if you linked your killmails but the most common reasons for a new player to lose a ship in EVE are:
---
 - You joined a corporation that is at war with another corporation, and that other corporation's members can shoot at you freely
---
 - You joined your empire's militia, and the opposing empire's militia members can shoot at you freely
---
 - You wandered into wormhole/lowsec/nullsec(a pop-up window will warn you about this)
---
 - You did something to flag yourself as a suspect/criminal(default crimewatch settings should prevent you from this ever happening)
---
Now the one for player kills please
---
I just remapped all of my module hotkeys to the numbers rather than function keys because some dickweasel at HP thought it would be a good idea to hardwire their laptop so you have to hit the FN key to do what your F-keys should do. I couldn't alt-F4 even if I wanted to because Windows doesn't recognize the command since the FN key is also depressed.
---
Fair enough but who would benefit from that? Not the small guy, goons test and ph who destroy everyone around them.
---
Can we have a key...?
---
man those hisec guys having a field day, just like everyone wanted
---
Gila drone health bonus was nerfed.  I think Gila drone damage bonus stayed the same though.  They reduced drone bandwidth on the VNI to 75mb/s so you cannot use a full flight of heavys.  The is currently a comms blackout in nullsec so local chat would like WH space, ie the player list does not update unless someone talks in local.
---
Yes there is two, they reduce manufacturing time by 2 and 4%.
---
What in the ever living Christ is this? Have you heard of our Lord and Savior, print screen?
---
People love ^^^^(to ^^^read ^^^about) Eve
---
3 hour fight with plenty of kills and fun. total waste indeed.....
---
Yeah I need to add a key and an adjustable scale like on the region specific stats so you can change the brightness a bit easier.. just something I whipped together last night
---
Question. Why are you DDing a fleet member?
---
You running this on an Apple IIC?
---
[https://imgur.com/zj3DPXZ](https://imgur.com/zj3DPXZ)
---
its pretty quiet atm.. pod kills are similar
---
Data is easily manipulated, as data alone unfortunately can't tell a complete story.
---
But... every other r/Eve post assures me there's non-stop epic pew pew happening all over null-sec since the blackout. Surely people aren't exaggerating to make it look like blackout was more successful than it really was? Right?!
---
And your point is? How do you get eveisdying from the fact that the new app, which is functionally a massive improvement over the old app, allows people to buy plex and skins? It also allows people to see info on their chars and manage their skill queues. Also, if you lol left eve why do you care?
---
They're strong when they don't have to take mids. That wasn't the case here.
---
You should do both. You can't get everything from reading and you'll most likely miss something by not reading. Experiencing the thing is invaluable tho.
---
This is me with every game. Researching a game is as fun as actually playing it imo.
---
Its also Monday morning..

If you are an Alpha clone or stay in HiSec(&gt;=0.5) you can drop the cloak.    
---
The ship costs about 5M. That's about 5 HiSec sites you have to run to break even. In LowSec a site nets you about 20M and in Wormhole Space and Null you can get even more.
---
To improve your scanning speed you can use Sisters Core Probes and/or a Sisters Launcher. Both are more expensive as the basic stuff, but at least the probes are worth it even as a beginner.
---
[Here](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site) is a list with sites you can warp to safely. Also consider visiting the "EvE-Scout" ingame channel for help with exploration.
---
Russian folk who live in Insmother.
---
some renters i think
---
Well done
---
Even that had a print screen function
---
Like others have said there is no manual. Eve is a game that in order to excel you have to put in some time and research. From the moment you start the game look up every term that you cant recognize. Finish the tutorial and sit out in space to understand your ship and mods as well as its movement. 
---
Fly FRIGATES!! Use the starter ship to look at things and try to understand the difference an afterburner makes etc... see what looks good as an upgrade that will help ensure your financial stability and overall goal in the game. Once you have aimed at a career path look at your isk making and understand what it will take to keep it running. Dont ever risk your iskmaker in pvp unless you can easily replace it.  
---
FLY FRIGATES!! If you are aiming for pvp after ensuring your financial abilities stay with frigates. Buy a fit and keep it cheap so you can continuously lose and replace them. Go out and lose 100 of them if you have to. As long as you choose to look back and understand what you could do better every loss has value to you. Once you get good enough with them you will be able to replace higher end versions of them as you wont lose so many of them trying to learn how to use them. 
---
Any alliance  / pvp corp would love a fast tackle pilot that knows his shit and how to use it. That person can change the flow of almost any pvp engagement. They will also be able to think and respond and survive. Pilits like that are nearly priceless imo..
---
I have it on good authority that razor doesn't even show up on the overview. That guy propably still wonders how he these angel rats did so much damage.
---
It's also the weekend after wow Classic came out.
---
Sisi shenanigans
---
My thoughts are with Frat during this trying time.
---
Too true.. I'm gonna look at extending to include some longer term data
---
It doesn't matter if you can interact with the cutouts or not, it was common for chinamen/krabs to use an overlay that only displayed local chat player list (before blackout) so they could fully tab out and dedicate a few inches of screen to that, giving them complete safety even if Near2/discord intel pings fucks up.
---
They may not have made the changes based on data but they kept the changes based on data.
---
If that is your issue you can also use longbow corms, arty wolfs, moas or caracals.  
---
I mean people have been using bigger ships for ages to counter other ship classes, it is actually one of the main balance philosophies that a ship class gets hard countered by ships one up in size.  
---
Also i was using common nullsec fleet comps of today because ease of access is a big factor in if a comp is viable or not.
---
Think about what you would do in his shoes. You just banked \~$34,000,000 and are doing something you love. Do you:  
---
a) Sell out to try to squeeze a bit more money
---
b) Carry on doing what you love doing in the full knownledge that you might have to retire on your $34million fortune next year if things don't go your way.  
---
I'd so take b over a.

Well, that explains why I couldn't find anyone to talk to about moving assets out of null. Thanks.

To understand scaling laws and mathematical models. Important skills to understand a wide range of things including in eve.

thats correct.

I just didn't realise it held more regular probes.

Oh damn yeah definitely don't do that.

Or maybe discussions like this shouldn't be conducted during a live stream where the hosts have moved on and are talking about something completely different.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
This is the sad truth
---
And you don't kill them because they melt. Interdictors and obliterate tackle.
---
There's not fight unless they decide to suicide into you. Or you happily throw stuff at them to die and hope you pick one or two off.
---
Was going well until the r/iamverysmart ending there buddy.
---
either you will enjoy the feeling your having now, (the feeling of puzzles and struggling and learning) or you wont, the game doesnt change, im 5 years in and still learning
---
Now you won\`t destroy that nag until you repair its armor back to 0%.
---
What Data? They've fucked up any data by all these login events right after they started to make changes.
---
LOL hellcamp? I had a lot of fun killing  tapi during that.
---
Kind of the point I was trying to make. Removing Asset Safety will only harm everyone else.
---
I was so confused! How in the world can that ship live through 10 frigs if they'd properly apply?
---
Because they weren't that strong. I can't speak for now but at the time they were an embarrassment. God that keepstar attack was awful. Well I mean I had fun.
---
I'll never forget hearing PGL bitch and moan on comms "We're never coming to insmother again!"

I’m surprised it didn’t underflow, was probably a UI bug because the guy said armor was at 0

Question: Why shouldn't you?

Not sure why this is getting downvoted, we formed 2 corps for another timer, it was a no show, so we looked around to see if anything else was happening and decided to drop on hobos for shit and giggles.

rebuff drakes 2020

Great cast! Thanks for bringing this to the attention of the wider community.

if you think that you can keep feeding on cheap kills like that you're delusional. People will adapt and things will return to old stagnant after a while.

Damn wrong TZ, otherwise would have loved to send application for you! My Widow has been standing by too long already.
---
What does that have to do with the issue of capitals being too strong? It doesn't matter WHY the capitals are on grid.
---
What matters is that we had to field 495 people from three big groups to kill 13 caps worth 60b. If you don't see why that is a problem than idk what to tell you
---
if your going to tell me if test had this level if shit going inside thier ranks that TEST sueprs wouldnt be getting fleet warped around, your lying to yourself :D.
---
dont try and bullshit all TEST titan pilots revoke fleet warp (actually remember to do it)
---
Now this looks like all of eve vs test
---
Not really consider I have a corp of a few old vets like me and a ton of newbros having fun learning the game. We've had several alphas go Omega just in the last 2 weeks (good news for Eve!).       
---
I think a lot that just join a huge group right off rip probably quit, just like new players who stay in an npc Corp. You really need to join a small group at first to learn the game and make friends who don't mind teaching you stuff.
---
This tool is getting better and better!
---
&gt;What matters is that we had to field 495 people from three big groups to kill 13 caps worth 60b.
---
So you're saying Eve is hard... I thought that was Hilmar's current goal?
---
And afterwards they are still interested ... to read about it.
---
That guy was a loss for EVEs sandbox, a step further to it containing only standard sand grains all the same while throwing out the edgy, sharp little stones. It is fun how Goon Metagaming again and again manages to make CCP hurt themselves ...
---
I tried to do fastest to 1b isk then someone gave me 100m i started killing ventures for god knows why and now i’m stuck in lowsec and can’t do invasions
---
Wtf are you on about ...
---
So as a more extreme example. If CCP were to add a new ship which is unkillable and can kill everything on grid with a new special module. That would just make the game hard so all is fine and Hilmar's current goal is successful hurdur
---
I seriously hope you are just trolling at this point
---
It really has basically zero effect on new players. If you are new join a small high sec corp looking to branch out into low, null, and wormholes. You can learn the game together and move out from high as a major contributor to your group, and not just new member #1050 in a giant group that already owns a few regions.     
---
As a new player you might find you have a talent for fleet command, or logistics, or like manipulating markets, or really enjoy running major mining ops. You can't really shine in a massive entrenched group. You might be the CEO of a Corp/alliance that controls portions of Eve down the road, or the most infamous pirate, that's kinda the point of a sandbox game!     
---
The most fun to be had in Eve right now is in small groups. Small groups can adapt and have fun, and a lot of changes are coming. You newbros right now might be doing massive things you wouldn't believe right now in the future. And every major alliance controlling several regions started out as a group of newbros.

3. But *somebody* knows *something*, and should help the crowd-source effort of keeping  [The Real Eve Manual](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) up to date.

4. We can comfortably define the requirements of a manual to be to describe and explain the game mechanics and assets, what players do with it does not have to be in there.
---
5. that's molded by the players, not the game-mechanics specifically and does not have to be in the manual.

6. That's part of creativity, and is based on knowing the game mechanics and assets, so if those things are explained, anyone has the tools to try and test something new.

I‘m proud to be part of these autists. You‘re missing funtimes.

You still need to be present and paying attention for it to work. I don't see a difference between this and having a player cloak up and sit on the gate during a mining operation. I think OP is just salty because people are not handing him kills on a silver platter.

I hope someone in CCP headquarter is following what's going on in the south during last months. And whenever "The little Astra that could" dies, they replace it with a monument. This medium citadel, and the people who "live" in that system, are providing a hard to believe amount of content for lots of people in Null-Sec.

Cloaked cowardice is an r/eve endorsed risk averse playstyle.

You aren't allowed to say bad things about it

Wait so shitting on playstyles like krabbing is allowed, but shitting on a playstyle such as MTU killing is not?
---
i know very little about low sec - where does that acceleration gate go? Seems very popular.
---
Nope but thanks for playing.
---
You managed to force an entire alliance to disband due to a disagreement with one of its members over a small amount of isk never once thinking about the effect on all the others. Some of us however have found a similar alliance with the same goals but without the fat.
---
Can you link your loss from zkillboard.com?
---
There’s a dude in Jita with 11000 kills, 99% being Tornado blaps of war targets on undock

We've actually said many times that some of our own members are stupid enough to fall for this. We just don't see that Test wouldn't have killed the astra by now to stop it happening.
---
LOL.  Biggest killer for activity in PL was the Provi Faction tower campaign.  The only guys to enjoy that were the Higher Than Everest guys doing all the small gang stuff they could find.  Everybody else went afk after the first week or so.

In 7, I’m not overcomplicating things. I’m actually quite serious. Outside of my professional experience where I worked with scientists every day, EVE Fanfest is where I have the most interactions with scientists in various fields. These are serious people doing serious research on various aspects of EVE’s many different aspects.
---
I’ve talked to many EVE pilots, among which are a rocket scientist, an astrophysicist, a psychologist, a professor of computer science, doctors, lawyers, economists, graphics artists, engineers, software developers [a lot of those]. You name it. You don’t have to be any of these things to play EVE but it doesn’t hurt the experience.
---
I was in the room when the president of Iceland gave a speech at Fanfest [I took pictures and they all turned out to be shit :-(]. 
---
I’m not trying to overcomplicate it. “What is EVE Online” people ask me. I answer: a space-themed game. Which is the very top layer of the answer, because it is so much more than that.
---
I just had that bowel movement, there’s decidedly less shit in me than there was a few minutes ago, thanks :-)

It's more useful than watching him multibox a bunch of mining ships and it isn't breaking any rules. People have been doing gate cams on twitch for years.

---
EVE changes so fast that any manual would be obsolete within a couple of months.  
---
Yes, some aspects of the game have not changed in years, but the rest of the game moves quickly.  
---
Many parts of the game cannot be learned by reading, you have to actually do them (or watch lots of videos) to understand them fully.  
---
As well as the above points, many aspects of EVE have no definitive way of being done. It mostly comes down to personal preference, play style corp/alliance doctrine/culture, what skills you have, what you can afford, how risk adverse you are etc etc etc.  
---
It's a very complex, highly subjective game.  
---
Best way to learn is to hang out in the official help chat channels and ask lots of questions. Even if you don't ask many questions, you'll learn a lot just by reading what's posted in those chats.  
---
Joining a player corp is also a good way of accessing guidance, depending on how good that corp may or may not be.
---
They are still more vulnerable then before the changes, because back then you would have to kill a POS and most of the time the stront timer was a bit longer than 7 minutes.
---
Maybe it is time to split the Rorqual into two ships, a boost ship that has a 2-3 minute panic to protect the miners, compression while in siege, but no (or a small) ore bay/fleet hangar  and a drone mining ship with siege for the excavators without a panic button.
---
EVE has a plenty of ridiculously rich players . That one of the reason Abyssal pvp is not popular anymore

 * Blackout =&gt; lets force already known mechanic from area where majority of players don't want to play to whole nullsec              
---
 * Cyno Changes =&gt; no one asked for it so it will be total shocker for players that they will need to use only recons or BO as cyno ships for capitals ships and coverts for JF ... yes lets give covert cyno ability to JF!. Lets totally don't give a fuck about player base gameplay , how fucked up current mechanics are or traditions like memorial cyno **because who cares about those players**             
---
* Bumping changes =&gt; People stuck in models raising tickets? Well why we need to spend time on solving those tickets or fixing the initial issue why this is happening , 3minutes and you warp off ... players are using it **didn't you get earlier ? no one cares**             
---
* Asset safety? Lets make stuff burn =&gt; no asset safety, people will have fun burning all small groups home for like 3-4 months. Players on deployments or in hospitals mostly affected **so what** ?         
---
* Wormhole changes =&gt; no more rolling holes, you live with what you have and wait. This is bad? **make more alts and live in multiple WH, duh**
---
I mean, you don't equip an Expanded launcher unless you want to use Combat probes (or you're in a T3C/T3D), but yeah no using the Expanded doesn't stop you from using Cores. Would be really really rough if it did lol.
---
U sux.
---
Most of the players who complain about blackout are the injected toons who jumped straight to nullsec as it was safe to do so. Older players and new new players have adapted as always.

It is happening all over. If you aren’t blue to half of eve there are fights everywhere.
---
It's the battlecruiser that kills supercarriers. It's what happens when you gaze into the Abyss, and the Abyss gazes back with an entropic disintegrator. They're expensive by battlecruiser standards, but they're the highest damage, nearly highest armor, lowest mass T1 battlecruiser platform out there, which makes them extremely favored by wormhole groups where ship mass is a major concern.
---
It also has hilarious amounts of flexibility in utility highs and role bonuses. Most people use a smartbomb and neuts or noses, but as is shown here you can entirely viably run remote armor reps and pack your fleet DPS and Logi into one ship.
---
What data?
---
Yeah, why not.
---
Lonetrek that popular?
---
That's how a lot of the Triglavian ships feel because they *all* have that set of role bonuses. That said though, the Entropic Disintegrator uses a ludicrous amount of Powergrid, meaning you usually need to either downgrade some of your other modules, Ancillary Current Router rigs, or get lucky on Abyssal rolls.

It's basically just a very progressive tax. I know EVE is just a game, but even here, I don't think socialism and is the solution: you're only destroying a game instead of destroying people's lives, but a mistake is a mistake.
---
Glorious achievement.
---
Give carriers the jump bridge titans get. Give supers a turbo jump bridge with crazy range or something.
---
I'm Provi-Bloc, mate. We're blue to nobody :P
---
&gt;It is happening all over. 
---
The activity maps don't really support that claim tho. - And I don't just mean OP's map. I've been keeping an eye on the dotlan activity maps for the duration of the blackout, and this alleged activity has at least not been making a mark on those stats. A big spike in the first week, as expected, but once people's initial hardon faded it took a drastic nosedive.
---
So here's how it'll play out.  Goons will deploy to the richest region with 750 Titans, 500 Supers, 1,000 faxes and 250 Rorquals.  They will setup a Keep and umbrella there and mine the region down to average.  Then they will go home again to Delve.  
---
It's called "Locust Fleet" and they already do it to Fountain, Period Basis and Querious for moon fracks (though with fewer numbers).
---
You can just buy cheap HID controller that can be scripted it or pull some old keyboard, check what is responsible on pressing V ^(or any key on it) and under like 2$ build up simple circuit that will "press" the key every N seconds.

If he is using DXNothing settings from ISBoxer then it is illegal under the EULA but from the screen clips, this looks like cut down OBS Sources which is totally allowed.

This is a sloppy job from the studio who made this app, nothing else; but, yeah I am a fool for expecting better.

Frankly, this app is a POS.
---
Create  a module that a ship can use to allow a group to teleport it's entire super capital fleet to it if it's under attack
---
Oh wait...
---
Test and legacy and fire coalition and goons you mean lmao
---
At first blush, this has some merit and is definitely different than what we've seen recently.  
---
I would personally, lower the % of change and make a few more changes to produce conflict drivers:  
---
\- Reduce JF &amp; Rorq jump ranges by 20-25%. This would make controlling regional chokepoints important again and not just pop over them.  
---
\- Increase the time of respawn rates of all mining by 75+% to slow the ore/mineral glut.  
---
\- Adjust moon composition regionally to force trade or conflict to get needed resources.  
---
Just some additional thoughts.
---
Bravo.
---
Yeah I have tried to think how the major blocks would respond and this is it. 
---
But I still think they will have the following issues:
---
- logistics of moving so many people will convince some to try other methods.
---
- it still won’t be as safe as how it is now because not everyone will move. 
---
- And because of the ranking System they might not be able to move enough to get to the very valuable systems, if they just use the regions around them those will also be high up on the ranking and worthless 
---
- even if they overcome all these difficulties it makes the largest group in the game nomadic. Which I like mich better than current situation.
---
great shot
---
Yeah this is by no means end all fix all there are plenty of other mechanics that need to be worked on (adms, sov Grind and structure spam come to mind for me)
---
But this would be a badass start
---
#This is dumb .......               
---
Because people love Goons i will use them as example:          
---
* January we are mining ratting only in DELVE           
---
* Feb ... we move to Querious              
---
* March is period basis               
---
So your idea is negated by owning just 2 regions (btw) also imagine ADM that directly is linked to your activity.
---
It's not so much about not flagging exempt from fleet warp as about blindly accepting fleet invites from random characters on the undock of your staging where so much shit already died.
---
I remember hearing/reading that the reason for cheap Astras was to accommodate little guys. You used to be able to setup a pos and run a corp with a few guys out of a WH or some such. They didn't want to ruin that with citadels. Hence: citadel spam.
---
You can't just simply go to one of the richest regions, because those will be NPC regions with no IHUB upgrades.
---
Sure you can deploy your locust fleet there, but that doesn't make anoms appear.
---
He is not modifying clients just using other app to display only part of a screen.         
---
For example when local was working i was leaving eve in backgroud showing just part of the OV and local while doing other stuff in net.      
---
Now well .... but it is totally different issue.
---
Maybe 2
---
Hmmmm good question, lemme think. 
---
Was it because PL made a lot of enemies in the past by constantly helicopter dicking them with supers?
---
Or maybe was it because the attackers had a lot more titans and supers than the defender?
---
One could argue it was because a mega coalition was formed with the intent of evicting TAPI, so a defensive mega coalition had to be formed...
---
Yeah, no, let's just go with grrr gons: it definitely was because goons are blobbers and they want to kill Eve.
---
So basically, punish people who build up infrastructure and invest in their space? Wasn't that the point of having Sov in null? What is the incentive to build infrastructure when doing so will immediately devalue your space and investments?
---
Sorry, this just seems to be another fuckgoons post in disguise and won't fix shit.
---
You pretty much have the fit on the screen
---
Eh?  No.  If the region is the richest region *now*.  You would deploy your locust fleet there until it is no longer the richest region *now* and there's a new richest region, at which point you'd redeploy someplace else.  
---
The only problem I see with this is cap FC burnout, as moving a Goon-sized locust fleet is hard and there's a huge amount of work that goes on to organise it behind the scenes.
---
Yea I was just interested if there were any fancy mods, my screen size is a bit small to make out the names.
---
Kinda like the idea but here is the real gurr goons answer and not they'll just move everything to mine somewhere else out of their space for a month.
---
Month 1 
---
mine and rat as normal in delve.
---
Total ban on mining and ratting next door in fountain.
---
Month 2 
---
Total ban on mining and ratting in delve.
---
Mine and rat in fountain which is now +80% from being the least used for a month.
---
Month 3
---
Repeat month 1
---
Etc 
---
So I'm fact the larger the empire the better they are as they'll have space to waste for a month to get sweet sweet +80% the month after
---
It's amazing how much bling can make up for poor piloting decisions in 1v1s.
---
Of course it's full bling.
---
just now d/l this to have a look.  
---
Really well done, my thanks.
---
The problem is currently investing in infrastructure will grant you infinite resources.
---
&gt;2
---
Where can I get that EVE client that is updated so much in an update that a manual is obsolete after one of our monthly updates?
---
Listen to Hilmar.
---
Yea at least some, was wondering if abyssal or not.
---
You also don't know what to look for cause you know nothing about the game.
---
It wasn't just their enemies letting them rebuild, lets not forget 2 patches that massively buffed exactly what goons did - turtle up and win the game by sheer multibox-pve-autism. Citadel &amp; Lifeblood are the names ...
---
Yes
---
On the plus size: Isotope prices going up.
---
I thought MTUs belong to players
---
I’m a returning player, I’ve logged on to find my monocle is now worth quite a bit of isk...however it’s currently in a deep null sec station.
---
Monocle I’m discussing: [Looking Glass Monocle Interface (right/gold)](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=4009) 
---
My question is: If I get blown up trying to get this back to high sec will I lose it?? I was wondering since it’s a fashion item bought from the EvE store it might be treated different upon being blown up?
---
good bro ... erm bot
---
You'll hardly see from a shared fit, how good roll it was, or what was the base used.
---
I’m aware of that..but your input has been greatly appreciated 🤣
---
No one is having fun in black out. Just look at that MER. That's the only indication that anyone is succeeding in this game.
---
Lol, I always thought you only was one person in the ship :p
---
If there was a crew, wouldn't there be a marked for it? Eg a better soldier to get better reload time or a better cook to make the crew work better?
---
It's also more fun to keep stomping on FRT than it is to actually run and win the entosis operations required to properly evict them...
---
Maybe increase the amount of time and make it quarterly. Might encourage wars. Only a month and people would just wait it out.
---
It still reduces the amount of protection they have. Or make the rankings from the last month have an effect on the next (for example can’t drop more than 1 tier each month)  they would need to then own at lest 5 regions. Good luck on them keeping people keen on keeping all the adms up and moving every month. 
---
it could easily be made to work
---
Do you roam out of provi? I’m not looking at stats I’m out roaming all regions and I am finding a lot of fights. Not ganks, fights.
---
Supercarrier ewar module
---
This does incentive people to build infrastructure. Just not on of the largest in the game where everything is already set up an safe. 
---
It is an actual incentive to go out with your 100-200 man alliance and take sov, defend it, and have awesome rewards for doing so. 
---
It does de-incentive super large groups, but that’s the point!!
---
That Astra need show off some killmarks
---
Yeah this could be possible with the largest groups at the moment. I replied to a comment above with the idea of linking the previous months MER to the current. So they cannot drop more than 1 tier per month. It means they would have to hold 5 regions just to not have negative buffs.
---
So do cans jetcans full of veldspar. 
---
But killing those isn't exactly worthy of praise either
---
Well if PL is so strong, why did they phone Frat/skillu/tri/others
---
Fuck that. 4-6 hours of explo I'd rather stab myself repeatedly in the face.
---
Source?
---
Pos not equal to space station  tho.  Old station equals Astra which was 50b to drop ish (talking old school eggs)
---
I think shorter times would be better, it means the larger groups can’t move where it is good and completely set up as easily. (Yes they still can, but if it is every month people might try and stay smaller and stay in their space.) I think a lot of people wouldn’t just “wait it out” they would want the good rewards 
---
And I don’t think sov should be taken into account. It’s not about punishing people who want to hold space. It is about incentives for smaller groups.
---
Goons does hold more than one region, and going by the last MER all of them would be in the top 2 tiers for debufs.
---
C6 and Null... Safer than C1 and HS+LS...
---
Whoot?
---
t2 gun , impnavy neut , atype ab , truesansha scram , t2 capbooster, 2x atype rep , 2x atype plating , nanobot accel , nanopump
---
I have not seen an EVE manual, I can’t tell you. Aside from the work EVE UNI is doing I don’t know where a body of work resides that explains the EVE client’s functioning.
---
Also, and it bears repeating, because it is a sandbox, explaining what button to click to perform an action, does not explain the game itself.
---
Titans can doomsday planets/moons into dust, but have a insta-death weakness that only the best trenchrunning interceptors can exploit.
---
Because who  cares  about  space  honor
---
Awesome, thanks bud!
---
Perhaps a weighted avwrage of the past few months instead of monthly grading with monthly resets. This way it would not be possible to simply rotate around 2 or 3 regions. But it is an interesting idea.
---
Man 13 bil is only 26 excavators
---
If it's in ship cargo and your ship is destroyed, you will lose it like any other item.
---
You could always wear it instead, then remove it when you get to where you want to go.
---
Yeah I have added that to some comments. Seems the only way around a rotation system for the larger groups. Or they can’t drop or increase more than a tier a month. Means holding at least 5 regions to stay neutral
---
Going out of Provi would be redundant. It's where people tend to end up coming anyway, so going out to find them isn't necessary. That's kind of how Provi has always been.
---
Do FW zone kills vs tier/system control.
---
It's a decent idea.
---
They have 4. So little people are affected but if you can control multiple regions you are fine
---
You can adjust the in game map to highlight systems that have cloning facilities, if you hover over the systems highlighted it will list the stations.
---
Thanks Dt, how do I actually wear it/take it off?
---
My only options when I right click are: https://ibb.co/WnB7SdN
---
Sell a consumable that for the next 30 seconds all active tier 4 mission sites in this system are replaced by a  Tyrannos ship fleet.
---
Yes let's buff supers
---
November 23rd!

If you get caught unprepared you get burned. That should apply everywhere
---
How would the last update to eve make a manual obsolete rather than needing one area to be updated? (I don't even think there would be an update needed)
---
Is there a video of it somewhere? I can't find any :(
---
Does it include one for an undock button for NC. ?
---
Even with 5 regions they would only ever break even on the tier list if you implemented the idea if they can’t drop more than 1 tier per month. They would have to PERMANENTLY control 10 regions and effectively enforce a “no mining/ratting” rule in 9 of them to continually mine in the best region.  
---
Little people are only affected positively, if you are a small group that defends your space and isn’t in the top 50 percent of regions, you are getting rewarded. 
---
Why you so negative stain guy? Just cause a post doesn’t have a gate mentioned in it?
---
What's the source of the blueprints tho?
---
Thanks for build and list.  I will use both.
---
Depending on the features added/removed a manual could be obsolete.
---
For instance: at some point CCP removed the Captain’s Quarters. That makes a lot of functionality obsolete.
---
New features added to the game would not be discussed in the user guide making it obsolete.
---
So you think large groups have no place in the game and should therefore suffer for their efforts? Also, if you are a small group and suddenly your region is the best MER-wise, you do what? Forbid your members to PvE? Rip everything down and go somewhere else? What is the plan here?
---
You are arguing null sec is dead but you don’t leave provi. Provi has life but the standing fleet on weekends deters small gang stuff. I suggest in the nicest possible way you try roaming instead of waiting for content to come to you
---
Fully agree, found multiple fights a week. And can't be bothered with provi. Provi is pretty shit for actually fights as they either wont undock or undock 50. 
---
I would say things have slowed down in the last week or two compared to what it was immediately after blackout. But even in my Corp that's due to WoW classic.
---
Additionally... we have a lot of people waiting for cyno changes. Good by supers on everything
---
I'm all about good memes, but Test?  Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, yucky.  I need to go shower now :p
---
I am not going to assume I was in "LC" space?  Still trying to figure out it all out.  Tried scanning and exploring found a couple of wormholes and jumped through them I was two wormholes away from where I started not really sure how to describe where seemed like fairly empty region didn't see any bases or other ships.  Found a data site so did the hacking mini-game failed miserably by the way then this ship just came flying in and I was dust before I could even react.
---
Only option is to biomass and try again on a new toon... I hear dreddit is recruiting
---
So like in Highsec? Just that you don't need to invest in infrastructure and a supercap-umbrella there, first?
---
&gt; cause at the time PL was alive
---
it wasn't any more dead or alive than it is now tbh
---
&gt; and had more caps and super caps than Test, before you looked at the other allies PL had
---
no it didn't 
---
&gt; heck that hellcamp can arguably be called the thing that "killed" PL
---
the 'hellcamp' was unironically a joke that after getting trapped probably lifted morale more than anything. non-stop legacy feeding followed by a series of breakouts in which I don't remember a single super or titan dying.
---
legacy were already winning the fight before the imperium came, and as it turned out the goonie goons arguably saved the meteor super fleet by blobbing the server so hard they crashed it.
---
yeah UALX was probably the last hurrah for PL as an independent superpower, but nothing else you said is true or accurate.
---
anyway as we ALL KNOW, UALX was a victory for the meteor coalition:
---
ISKWAR: WON ☒
---
OBJECTIVE: WON ☒
---
KEEPSTAR: DESTROYED ☒
---
TRAPPED: ☐ This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
plus bonus points for the meme video of the year, Bustin'
---
I was in wormhole space.
---
Naaa, dont think so, still hidden :I
---
I figured it'd be someone like you who did that.
---
As an alpha who has only the most basic idea about the keybinds, what the significance of F1 here?
---
If his corp doesn't react by shoving money down his wallet and/or tell him he should FC ASAP, it was the wrong corp anyway.
---
It doesn't really stop people consolidating, though. What will happen is everyone becomes nomadic, the largest, strongest will take the highest % uncontested (because why risk everything when you can take 2nd or 3rd best?). Smaller groups without a trusted logistics dedicated group or their own personal caps won't be able to keep up, nor afford being able to put down citadels.
---
Infact this would theoretically do the exact opposite of what you expect and force people to join bigger organizations due to their greater organisational abilities. If you can organize 1000 turkeys to walk in the same direction - what's 100 more? Whereas a group of 30 might rely on 1-2 individuals to move things or pull more weight than others. Also this encourages bots to simply move to hisec, where they won't be penalized and is arguably harder to deal with because of Concord.
---
Tied with other changes; it's possible this might work. But on its own? It'll be aggrivating to most people to move every month. Might as well do incursions if you don't mind moving everything you own.
---
Shoot the reds ;)
---
Well propably the last year of bomber meta. To strong and to much used, soon incomming nerf ahead.
---
Except the peak active player count in the past 7 days is lower than any period in the past 5 years...
---
Then simply limit the number of raitaru/astra to the number of moons in system. There are systems in null with over 200 structures.
---
So I joined the zkillboard site.  Hope these are public links but this is what it showed me.  Is there anyway for me to see what type of space I was in when I was killed?  Just trying to learn so I know what to do and not do in the future.  I know 2 mil isn't much for most but pretty much most of what I had.

---
Deep safes, nothing new, neeeeeeext....
---
&gt; Each month the ranks are re-evaluated and reset. 
---
Should have flushed this idea while you had the chance, it won't fix shit.
---
Well itll effect them when they have to leave it.
---
Now if CCP can just turn interest into engaging game play....
---
Hey don't we make mining, so that resources, including moons can be repeated for a period longer than the next downtime. 
---
Mined a moon until it is repeated?
---
That fucker will never come back. Why? BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE FINITE
---
There is a certain amount, and THATS IT.
---
What legendary fights? B-R, X47, and UALX?
---
Because those are the only 3 battles where two mega coalitions actually committed all their assets to a single fight. I guess you could consider goons vs KenZoku in Delve after they killed Bob, but that was pretty one-sided, and even that wasn’t a single major battle, goons just won all the small ones because of numbers and KenZoku never had a chance to really stop them. 
---
Still, that’s 4 battles, over more than 16 years, where two coalitions risked everything. In each of those, both sides either thought they would win, or one had already lost everything(goons vs KenZoku falls in this category). Since right now, Frat still has quite a bit of resources, space, and allies, it’s not going to make a last stand like KenZoku, and it’s obvious who would win if goons + test fought Pandafam, so there is no reason to expect pandafam to fight here. 
---
In 2016, when the majority of the game was against goons, they ran to lowsec after putting up token resistance. In 2013, in the fountain war, test fought to defend their space with subcaps, but never mounted a serious defense with supers. Back when the CFC and N3PL (old Goons and old Panfam) were the dominant powers, they first allied each other. When they eventually fought, there was one big battle (B-R) and then it was over. And before that, when it was ASCN vs Bob, ASCN had its leader rage quit and then fell apart to infighting, and didn’t even try to mount a serious defense of Feythabolis. And even before that, during the first Great Northern War, both sides just got bored and stopped fighting. 
---
Basically, you seem like you have no knowledge of the actual history of the game, and are basing what you think you know on the nostalgia of bittervets
---
i usually dont read long posts, but this one was a lovely read
---
Lol. Weenie space is a free for all of PVP.
---
I fixed this same problem on the work laptop - check if yours has a FN lock - mine triggers by using FN + left shift. It will make the default keypress be the Function key.
---
 I hope you like them \^\^
---
Fly safe!
---
So then I think we found our problem eh? That's the main reason Eve is dying, player retention. So how can we boost retention rates?
---
Nah, the north would do better to have a clear out at the top and rebuild, until that happens nothing will change for them.
---
F
---
Let's not pretend the NC. and GOTG superfleets weren't on their way to help the PL side. The latter decided to turn back and the former didn't make it before Goons arrived. Imagine if they got their reinforcements before Legacy did.
---
They want me to let you know they're sorry you have no friends. :(
---
LOL.
---
PR- in Delve, 2009z
---
6VDT in .... I forget what year that was.
---
Yeah, the those links are public. You can use the site to find all kinds of information on logged kills in Eve Online. You should check it out more!
---
As for the kills - ok, the first one, its a wormhole, its a pvp area with no limitations. I'm a bit more curious about the second loss - its a high security space - what happened? Was that a data site that was different from others and everything blew up after a minute or so?
---
iPhone Day.
---
Bob rescued its cap fleet pretty quickly, though, and it’s primary staging was never camped. And again, it didn’t completely die. 
---
As for 6VDT, are you talking about the Fountain War? Because Test is pretty obviously not anywhere close to dead
---
Thank you kindly for taking the time to read my story. Here's hoping I can share more adventures from across New Eden with the internet at large.
---
im looking forward to it, its written very well
---
Waking up in Jita, most dangerous place on new Eden! xD
---
While signatures and anomalies will always spawn within a relatively short radius from a known celestial, Incursion sites are not bound by this rule and can spawn at extreme ranges from anything in the system. You can then bookmark the locations of these sites. These are often called 'deep safes' and slapping down a citadel on one kinda ruins it because while it is deep, it is no longer safe.
---
Thanks, but I read all that. My point is, the 1T isk is completely arbitrary. Has nothing to do with the other part of the post. Misleading.
---
Incursions don't spawn in wormholes
---
So Incursions now spawn in WHs, eh?
---
If anything I would say the 2nd loss which was actually my 1st loss timescale wise.  Is really what promoted the post for the first one I kind of assumed wormholes might be more dangerous but first one I was in what I call regular space.  Successfully used the scanners to locate my first relic failed at the hack it did explode and was on my way to another relic that was nearby to hack it when I blew up.
---
Woops, I missed that bit. I assume this is the abyss trick, then.
---
You always have to be looking around while in wormholes cus there are ships that can go invisible. But except for stealth bombers they have a cooldown time before they can lock you up and shoot at you after they decloak.
---
Yeah most likely. I can't think of any other way in a wormhole to get a bookmark so far out.
---
Oh yeah, my bad. I forgot about all those non-stop respawning anomalies without a gate we have in highsec.
---
I wonder why someone would go to nullsec at all, since highsec ISK/h is obviously so much better
---
Some of those mining cruisers aren't logi right now though.
---
Arbi and Vexor used to be ones for their respective races, whereas Auguror and Execuror used to be just bad versions of Omen/Thorax.
---
So, how do you create one in a WH system?
---
My bad :(
---
To avoid issues with combat scanning through wrecks:
---
Extend the wrecks life time to 8 hours. After 2 hours the wrecks become automatically abandoned. Once abandoned, they become scannable.
---
This way, you can make wreck hunting a profession, without enabling ship hunting through wrecks.
---
I'm pretty sure player retention was outed as a problem like 6 years ago, if not before that.
---
AFK interceptor running MWD out for a couple days will get you that.
---
The drop is in WH-space, not null.
---
No. I’m talking about when we camped BoB 2.0 into 6VDT for weeks. This was years before TEST existed.
---
These days you don't. But you used to be able to. So if you still have the bookmarks, you can use them.
---
It used to be possible to make deep bookmarks with abyssal sites at downtime. Not sure if that is still possible.
---
\+1 upvote for the data analyst gentleman.
---
....isn’t the keep out of super range of o3-?
---
I excited for the new changes. I am buying two Hugginn's for the new cynosureal changes.
---
Exeq was the mining cruiser.
---
Vexor just also got a mining drone bonus.
---
Source: mined in an exequror before mining in a rokh.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Do you really think that I care about what you write? No sir.
---
&gt; Do you really think that I care about what you write? No sir.
---
Because sharex is amazing.
---
The thing is, Bob rescued their fleet after a couple weeks. And it still didn't help them to accomplish anything, they were going to lose delve either way. It certainly sped things up a little, but that's all.
---
Do you want to my pvp ship? I want to shoot you.
---
Stunning prose and penmanship.
---
🤣
---
Whats up with lonetreck?
---
You can't be this stupid. How can you read "Don't ever assumy my corp/alliance again,kid" and take it seriously? It's like if I said "did you just assume my alliance?" or "don't talk to me or my kestrel ever again." they're fucking old-as-shit cliché internet one-liners. For fuck's sake.
---
Theres also a ton of people that *used* to play Eve but are trapped in Eve purgatory (r/eve).
---
Even in UALX, they had more than us. If you looked at the totals, ignoring timezones, they had almost 2 times as many titans as legacy.
---
T h I like the panic module more than their absolutely outlandish local tank.  Defenders have time to respond, but even if they don’t it can keep tanking? Nah, scrap the tank, defenders should have until panic module times out to show up.
---
you could just afk fly out, if you’re fast enough nothing can catch you anyway.
---
It actually is! Or close enough. I got bounced 27 AU from closest celestial
---
Shhh...can't kill what you can't find...
---
Start an. Abyssal.site right before DT. U'll end up 20 AU+ away from the sun ina. Random direction
---
&gt; Wormhole changes =&gt; no more rolling holes, you live with what you have and wait. This is bad? make more alts and live in multiple WH, duh
---
This has really been blown out of hand.  I watched the clip, someone asked about chaos era coning to lowsec/WHs.  Hilmar mentioned that rolling holes is too easy.  CCP isn’t going to remove hold rolling.
---
wormholer btw
---
Yup abyssals work I've.made several safes
---
F, didn't want those subs any way
---
you web/scram supers?
---
about that
---
I don't know for certain but if they don't have the ability to access richer data than simple logins they're doing it wrong considering they have all the data they'd need to mine to come up with half sensible conclusions already.
---
Nooo, old one looked like a tapir O.o
---
You know they run the servers, right? So whatever data they want to use. They can use literally any metrics they want to.
---
it looks like pocket of Kamokor, Ruvas, Umokka are big rat pockets... that and the highsec regions have way more systems in them than nullsec
---
Never seen a dual tanked titan melt so fast.
---
i wasn't disputing that they have all sorts of data that they can use to justify anything, but you made a specific claim that they kept the changes made recently because of the data, i asked you which data would they have used to justify keeping these changes.
---
Because it sure as hell can't be player logins, since they pretty much made any data about player logins completely useless by giving SP rewards for people to login, quite generous  rewards too, so that data, if it gave them a positive reaction from the changes is not really useful to judge the impact of the changes.
---
The only data that i can think of that would have been used to justify keeping would have been ratting income and mining being down, which would be good for the economy, but what does it matter if its good for the economy if the player base continues to shrink anyway?
---
Have fun with 2.        
---
I have invented over 200 recon runs ... got materials for bigger batch, but i am at point where i contemplate if i just give 3 titan hulls sitting in my hangar to corp or wait till handout to PA in October to see what they will revert.
---
If you use discord, I worth a discord bot that can help with understanding the market. You may be especially interested in the price, predict, and mpvp commands. I posted about it recently at https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cuh5sp/introducing_matcalc_a_discord_bot_for_industry/
---
i see a lot of problems with an investment of 5bil taking out an investment of 50+bil with no skill involved. Granted bombing may not be as simple as pressing F1, but it's nowhere near as difficult as flying a carrier, and there isn't really any way to keep a cheap little disposable fleet from dealing damage a smaller corporation might take months to recover from in seconds
---
Just wo you do welp, the palla gate is almost guaranteed to be bubble fucked. Go round or be nullified.
---
Have fun dude.
---
Mind elaborating how you do it?
---
Exeq was the tits before freighters and before everyone had enough isk to justify having an entirely separate hauler ship
---
Start abyssal site before DT when u login u'll be in a random spot 20+ au from the sun
---
I do not understand the meaning of your words. You have Syntax mistakes sir. Do you have a highschool diploma?
---
Wat?
---
Level 4 mission hubs.
---
You just DD'd my eyeballs

I'd be salty if i was forced to protect botting chinese too :/
---
No! It's the goons who are wrong!

The lightest explorer is the Astero with a mass of 975 000 kg the heaviest is the Cheetah with 1 430 000 kg. It's unlikely that any explorer is fitted with a plate. The Astero fitted with 400mm Steel Plates II has still less mass than a Cheetah. A frigate prop mod adds 500 000 kg mass. Realistic values for the mass of exploration frigates are between 975 000 kg and 1 930 000 kg.
---
===============================
---
Yes and no.
---
First the battlereport tells very little about the story if you only look at the "ships" tab. I suggest you look at the timeline. We killed 3 Rorquals, 4 Minokawas, and 2 Lifs before the QRF jumped in. (Just to explain the we: I was part of the INIT stuka fleet in that fight.) Those add up to approximately 34b if you add their pods. At that moment we could have disengaged with zero losses.
---
Legacy (or essentially TEST) decided to jump in when there were still one or two FAXs alive. It’s unlikely that they really wanted to save them but it was rather about the fight. Same on our side we stayed around for the fight. This fight of three frigate fleets with nearly 500 players combined faced 22 titans, 35 super carrier, 26 dreadnoughts, 31 carriers, and some FAXs and very few subcaps. Those are 114 persons + the FAXs &amp; subcaps. The proper fight was approximately 10b vs 26b in losses because as we saw above 34b died before. (If TEST would have formed quicker they might actually saved the rorquals.) The losses were mostly in 6 revelation (about 3b each), a niddy (about 1.6b), and an Archon (about 2.4b). 
---
Losing in a ratio 10:26 if your numbers are in a ratio 500:125 or so isn’t really that bad. With TEST holding the grid in the end as far as I saw.
---
Now let’s consider possible subcap alternatives and how they would perform at similar numbers:
---
Corms would be cheap throw away snipers which could kill the command dessies. At TEST’s numbers they could volley command dessies. At the numbers present they would just die too quickly though and one bomb run would wipe the corms out. Similar Jackdaws and Harpies. Not enough killspeed one error and you get bombed to death. Spreading out only helps a bit against 3 fleets.
---
Muninns work well in general but are also at risk to be bombed before they spread out. Also much more expensive if an error happens. Muninns cost 300 to 400m fitted. If wiped by a bomb run you lose 30-40b in an instant without killing a lot of stuff. I think eagles have even more trouble.
---
The best way to go would be to have the same capital BLOB together with a good subcap fleet like corms, jackdaws, or muninns. But, get the numbers for that in the necassary timeframe.
---
I'm at a safe, warp when you're ready.
---
Got a delivery of **sweet leaves** for you my man
---
Gotcha.. I’ll roll in hoping for a 1v1 using my decently fit 300mil PvP ship, but I’ll most certainly bump into mr faction module guy in his 3b ship
---
I love how you make out your such a victim Yummi being part of Legacy. Maybe take the dick out of your mouth and leave? Or keep whining like the faggot u are
---
gigx seems like a left hand guy
---
Explo is ace. Yesterday I lost a 400m Stratios with about 400m in the cargo by lazily assuming the active Corp in the system I was exploring was too busy krabbing to notice me. I lost like 4 hours work. It took them ages to break my Armour too. Talk about excitement!!
---
Anyway I came back in an Astero and made all me dosh back. That was less exciting.
---
That's a lot more than 50b isk involved. But if you bring the wrong tool, you don't get to complain about not being effective.
---
But if it I
---
Umokka has a lot of L4 agents right on top of each other.
---
sounds like a durex ad

The keep in qlpx can hit all of deteroid with supers

Instead they're taking space for botting russians.

It's always cool to see stuff like this.

if you want to try your luck ,  check zkill for [abyssal pvp kills\\loses](https://zkillboard.com/kills/abyssalpvp/)  for fits. So far , arena is dominated by ikitursa\\curse\\munin. everything is fitted with Abyssal rolled faction mods, and at least mid grades implants
---
Thanks I think I am going to go back and do all the career agents.  I thought you could only do one don't know why I just assumed it was this mmo's way of choosing a class.  Now that I know you can do them all I will go back and give them a try.
---
\+1 for a good post but he's a troll.. I mean a goon.
---
I'm at work so can't provide screenshots unfortunately.
---
Iirc there should be a clothing icon in the station services panel (market, insurance, bounties etc). Click on that and it should take you to the character creation screen. You apparel should be available in there.
---
I \*think\* that's how it's done but it has been a very long time since I've done it.
---
Thanks. Always looking for advice from more experienced players when joining a new game. Especially one which seems as complex as this one.
---
Go into character customization while you are in the station with the monocle in your item hangar. There will be an option to equip it. Do so, and then pod yourself to hisec, fly to Jita, and then un-equip it from character customization and it will appear in your item hangar there.
---
why are you so mad. need to get out of that midlife crisis my guy, getting cringey now
---
Smallgang pvp : 3v1 ....
---
Like an orca and barges that compress in a station or in a pos?

Actually 80...thats why i have 500+ probes in the hole...i keep forgetti g to remove them out of my launcher when buying a new fit and it auto loads it with 80 sister probes...

Wouldn't get you far. At 20 km/s you only travel 4 AU per year!

Ahhh you're making this sub a better place with your positivity. The bitter assholes here won't let you.

Is gila still the best for T5 abyssal runs? I was popping some fits from here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3r6LzRsuKxlV77mnquc-khxu63_P9L1wtMhTlOqteI/edit#gid=32588320
---
into pyfa, and Gila fits max out around 680 DPS while HAM Cerberus fits get up to around 800, 900 with rage.
---
I get that application is a problem, but with TP + web + MGE + Polybolos BCS + Implants, I feel like a lot of that should be mitigated. Is it just the tank, or is there something else I'm missing that makes Gila better?
---
As you can see, it doesn't make them undetectable as some people think. I'm not sure where that myth came from and why people still try to do that
---
Caps had to mid, so I assume the sub caps was on its way just didn't arrive in time?
---
There are systems in null with hundreds of moons.
---
POS spam was worse than citadel spam. POSes just didn't show up on your overview so people didn't realize it.
---
Though POSes couldn't stage an attack nearly as well, and ran out of fuel pretty quickly, so you didn't have to   
---
destroy them all to maintain control of the system during an invasion.  You could clean them up later.
---
Imagine getting your angsty bitch to come defend you on an eve forum lmao
---
meh
---
This was a surprisingly good read.
---
I don't know any of you but I think it's time I unsubbed from this subreddit when people are getting so incredibly dense they don't even recognise the most common of internet memes.
---
I find the difference between the # of ships lost in wars vs the value of ships lost in wars to be one of the big stories told in these graphs.
---
We went from the most ships destroyed during wars to the least ships destroyed during wars.  But the values lost are still huge in comparison to normal losses.
---
I am not counting value.  In fact, value might be the problem here.  Between the inflation in material value and in capital alts, people now have ships that seem to have become too expensive to lose.  So do we seem to be losing fewer ships because they are worth too much?  
---
If each ship is worth less, are we more prone to undock and have fun?
---
If wars have gone from conflict drivers to conflict killers then Eve has certainly changed in that time.
---
I prefer Pie Charts!
---
It was a 5 vs. 2 fight.
---
10 corms, or even 100 corms, would just get booshed on top of, fail to track anything well enough to alpha it, and then get slaughtered by all the kikimoras.
---
I laughed. 10 corms would have indeed changed the tides :)
---
you and havok can go cry together mate, it'll be ok
---
It’s honestly booshers that are the problem. Bombers won’t be invincible without their automatic pull range button. 
---
I’d say just make it so if a booster is booshed, it gets a MJD cooldown equal to the cooldown as if it had booshed itself. You can keep extra booshers at pings if you need to move a fleet, but at least there will be something to counter them. 
---
It’ll also solve a bunch of other booshing doctrines that are equally broken but not used as frequently
---
When you die in the game, you die in real life.
---
The highsec one is interesting.
---
Those get absolutely murdered by Kikimoras. A year ago you would have been absolutely correct, but with how common kikis are in Stuka fleets, bringing small, long range ships is no longer a viable option. 
---
You could probably do something like RLML HACs, except good luck staying in range long enough to kill anything, because the Stukas also have a bunch of booshers with them.

Returned two weeks ago myself. Having a blast in wormholes now, the blackout changes are wonderful for pvp in null. I've found a new love for the game. Last time I played i quit because it seemed so dead, everyone was just ratting in null. This was 2.5 yrs ago. Now it feels a lot more alive, even if the player count is a bit down.

Thank you for adding the markers.
---
I find it interesting that Burn Jita has a huge impact in ship destroyed in highsec but not so much in ISK. The ships obviously counts the ganking catalysts too while in regard of isk destroyed the haulers probably mostly stop to move which explains that the isk destroyed doesn't change much.
---
The uptick in destroyed ships in lowsec after the Retribution expansion is interesting especially since FW was introduced in Inferno. Was there a change to FW in Retribution? I'm not long enough around to understand this.
---
The isk destroyed peak in Rage makes me smile.
---
Regarding blackout it seems to me like its effect is lost in the noise if there is an overall effect.
---
use thera, like the "elite" volta kids
---
LP stores are rehashed and now sell blueprint copys of items, not items themselves, including implants BPCs, so everything is fabricated by players.
---
It is nice content.

It was PL and INIT. at first. Then followed BB, VOLTA and Horde in that order I believe. All 5 groups were more or less coordinating. INIT. was told to hold stop DPS too on the last Rorq. The entire goal of the attack was to force an escalation in order to feed on Faxes, dreads and carriers.
---
That Proteus is an absolute shitfit. Why did he engage neuting cruisers and a bhaalgorn when he's active tanked and relies heavily on cap?
---
No cap mods is just dumb af, kinda like this post..
---
Imicus needs a complete makeover, Celestis needs an adjustment not totally redesign it...
---
Im not quite fond of the talos shape...is nice, but seems to have diverged quite a bit from the gallente design line.
---
Not sure why they are revisiting the atron, i like it the way it is now.
---
I am happy about this positive news article that new players are joining us at eve online.
---
Thank sir for for your well written words. I appreciate the gesture, sir. I was lucky to capture the Proteus. It was skill.
---
Lol no. It can hit west detorid but not east
---
Nah, PL and Init arrived after BB and Volta. I know because each time another neutral grey fleetball landed on grid I had to fuck around with corp standings to set them to +5 to keep my overview bearable. There was definitely coordination going on though, looking at the response times and compositions.
---
People mentioned abyssals. There were some former methods which created bookmarks even farther out. Those bookmarks got nerfed and moved in as far as I know. Anyways you could have a bookmark at that distance with the help of such old bookmarks. I never fully understood how the old method worked but I also never cared too much to find out as it doesn't work anymore anyways.
---
Just noticed the drag bubble and MTU to decloak him. Kinda dirty. I wouldn't call it 'pvp' more you caught him in a drag bubble and ganked him.
---
Twitch has a policy against AFK streamers. They have to actively be streaming content. They can't just go AFK and leave something up streaming on their page. I doubt any Eve intel streams could hold up to scrutiny under that policy.
---
Dude, is there a fork of this tool they made updated to esi? Or do the market pulls still work?
---
That fight near the end was a nail biter, but *then a wild carrier appears*!
---
Also, fuck that Griffin. ECM is cancer.
---
You and Blights Wretch are adorable bros in chat.
---
didn't want that w anyway
---
titan owner btw
---
You used to be able to double click in a random directoin and just go into warp.  
---
You used to be able to fit dual MWD's so would go very very fast.
---
they won't, and we won't either. fuck sort, they were only ever allies of convenience
---
that said, it won't happen because of time zones, same reason tapi are struggling to make any progress against frat
---
INIT. and PL landed at the same time. I thought they were first. And  yeah, highly coordinated.
---
Thanks for providing visualized facts. They confirm a lot of what I subjectively felt since 2016. Ship-kill-activity dramatically plummeted with Citadel patch, got lifted up back shortly by Alpha Clones (exactly for the timespan an Alpha needs to reach SP cap), just to fall back to the same low level after that.
---
Meanwhile after Lifeblood ISK destroyed started to rise, despite less destroyed ships in total, that points towards capital proliferation and the devaluation of ISK through Citadel/Lifeblood-Meta (displayed by the PLEX-prices also).
---
~major strategic assets~
---
Correct sir. It was a drag bubble.
---
A group of 100 titans can now channel their collective power to fire fleet wiping AOE smartbomb style doomsday, killing anything under capital class instantly on grid. It can be fired once every 5 mins, but you need skill injectors as ammo to fire it.
---
I have to deal with enemies of such caliber. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78200934/ a very strong nightmare.
---
So, null politics are the major driver of ships destroyed/content.
---
When you're 7-1 up you may aswell have a bit of fun before its all over.
---
I agree. Though I have a bit of hope for the future. CCP has acknowledged that the NPE has a lot of problems and there are a lot of barriers preventing players from getting into the game.
---
100 dudes in 50mil bombers shouldn’t be able to counter a 1.5b isk CaPiTaL sHiP! -some spodbrain
---
&gt; POS spam was worse than citadel spam.
---
No it wasn't, you had an upper limit in every system in new eden, citadels have no upper limit.
---
After &gt;10years ingame :shocker: ?
---
didn't want those titans anyway
---
Why should a capital be able to kill a frigate burning around at speed with low sig. Get back to that rock.   
---
Bring 300mill munins and do some work
---
if you can project to them, you can kill them, rapid lights say hi. They're not very tanky and have destroyer sig so yeah. Sure they melt tackle and all but if they wish to bounce so can you. Kikis are broken, definetly, but they aren't even close to being "practically unkillable unless they make a major fuck up". Unless the major fuck up is staying on grid against those
---
"please bring a fleet we can bomb"
---
Its almost like Muninns can track them pretty decently, or Beamfessors can wreck them. If only they were capitals
---
if you want lessons in how to not get bombed im sure pando will gladly give you some advice
---
This is like an Olmeca Gold grrr-goons post, but without any actual data or compelling message. Plz keep your sperg to yourself

---
When super safe rorq multiboxing became the only viable playstyle, it simply killed the other content/fun.
---
You need a PhD to understand angular velocity? hoo boy
---
Fantastic!
---
Surprising on how well low-sec (and even high-sec) is doing vs. null-sec, considering there are 817 low-sec systems, 1090 high-sec systems and 3294 null-sec systems.
---
you must have a very odd view of what can be called beauty in ship design.
---
dial the damage back on Stealth Bombers by 5-10% is the answer.
---
The market import is probably still slow from what I've read it can't be really solved by the app, it's something about the way the API is designed. 
---
Trying to import all items is impossible but if you have the intuition abou what items could have good margins then you can get them imported in less then 15 mins. That's just my experience with around 1500 import requests.
---
Navitas and Exequror were redesigned and the result is quite good.
---
its already being redesigned....less "dildo" look
---
But nonetheless, that job’s getting done too. Slowly.
---
lmao partizens is a shitshow
---
Just came back after a few years off. Lots of QOL improvements since I last played. Enjoying my return to the game very much.
---
~~~ Test vs rest of Eve ~~~ lol
---
There should be a Key to Order Vegan Food for Wormholers
---
Thank you everyone for the great advice.  I am going back doing the other career agent missions now and trying to learn more.  I am more aware now of the space I am in.  Also it appears a few of you sent me isk thank you though you didn't have to do that.  Wasn't looking for donations but more for advice on how this world works.  But still thank you so much I will try and spend it wisely.  I have only been playing a day but am really impressed by the community (minus the two punks who blew me up).  :)
---
Awesome graphs. Would love to see isk pool vs isk destroyed.
---
Analysis and visualizations are sexy. Yusss!
---
More krab, blibber and botter tears to be shed, bois!
---
I think that's already been done....
---
My problem with bombers is that they can’t easily be countered.
---
As soon as your counter gets on field, cloak and leave. 
---
You might kill one or two and save the target, but that’s about it. Bombers cloak and continue on.
---
Caldari Navy mission hubs, conveniently close to Jita?
---
So basically no one will be logged in then
---
nice flex bro
---
That's cause in Burn Jita, for every freighter destroyed, there's 50-100 destroyers + rookie ships concorded, which still count in stats.
---
Stukas usually dont cloak, often even have it offline
---
FW was introduced in the Empyrean Age expansion in 2008.  Inferno had a big FW overhaul, but that wouldn't necessarily cause numbers of ships lost to change all that much.
---
LOL same thing Exterminatus Illexis said above. Its really what prompted me to post.  I was curious if I did something wrong.
---
amazing and i get downvoted for saying it's just a fucking deepsafe. 
---
you guys are fucking morons...
---
Because you can't play Eve without cheaply droping your caps where evere you want ? Well you're probably not a big loss anyway.
---
Botting is allowed in the game as long as it is not forbidden.
---
It is forbidden as soon as it modifies any resource you own in game or any interaction with players or increases the rate at which you acquire a resource. So you are typically not allowed to move your ship, trade, talk with persons, using bots. However it is used to display some windows, set your ui, and know data in the game.
---
Example, I have a program that on a button changes my route to dock in the nearest predefined station and come back afterward. Another button to add a list of waypoint to my route.
---
Another program that compares the volume of sale of items, the price to build that volume, make an estimation of the value I should sell those items at, and tell me what I need to do in order to create and sell those items ; making a shoplist that can be imported ingame to quickly buy all the item I need.
---
So automation is allowed as long as it is not forbidden (basically, as long as it does not interact with the universe in the game instead of you)
---
you don't... eve does not have player retention, period. never had, never will...
---
First of all this looked like a good fun fight.
---
As an outsiders point of view, u guys killed just over 1.2 billion in ships more than the other party.
---
The way i look at it is that you guys lost the isk war as the group still standing goes home with all the loot / salvage of the wreckages offsetting the extra losses. A rough guestimate 3billion+ in salvage+ loot that got left behind, or is that just me thinking in a weird way?
---
and nothing of value was lost
---
One would think the numbers would go up with all the SP they've been spraying around like a water hose trying to get people to log in.
---
i think someone mentioned around here that Hillmar did pre-spent a lot of his own money on some VR stuff, so yeah he does need it because not that much of the nest egg might be still there.
---
same with the EA Chief creative officer guy who told gamers to not buy BF V if they dont like women in it. well that guy left EA with 75mil payout of his last 2 years to be CEO of a new gaming company financed half by some japanese megacorp but other half he had to put down. so now this guy might also be out of majority of his money when that "mobile" game venture fails
---
most people dont understand that yes success is most often a one trick pony and you cant replicate it so just accept it or you will eventually lose it all. 
---
now steve jobs was a real cat, who fell on his 4 all the time. made apple, got fired. bought lucasarts cgi company turned it into dreamworks and sold to disney for so much that his widow is largest individual disney shareholder. and then he went to apple and brought them to another level
---
but these guys are like one out of million
---
psycho
---
I wouldn't be that sure... The correct version would be "many people express interest in EvE very vocally online, yet never really play the game..." hence all those fucking r/Eve posts "is this game worth a try", "should i start playing eve", "is it too late to start now" etc...
---
Imagine how low the numbers would have been without those promotions!
---
I’m a recruitment director for lowsec corps. I havent been busier with new players rejoining wanting to restart the game in lowsec before they probably go to null in the not too distant future.
---
The tide has turned, bots reduced, economy balance and old hands coming back because of the changes.
---
*laughs in chemo legions*
---
This thread makes you look like a Wormholer OP
---
You uncloak cloakies to stop ganks?
---
What's with the self importance of people needing to announce to world that they're leaving something or that they're joining something?
---
Then don’t use it
---
It will be intresting to see how the numbers settle after hilmar fucks off back to his ice cave  for another years hibernation, and there isnt the SP events and login rewards coming out to fuck with the numbers.
---
So in about  12 weeks we should be done with all this.. close this sub and the servers and call it quits.. FINALLY
---
That's 10 F1 Monkeys. They'll die pathetically in anything else. 150 rails track frigs at 5000m, ab frigs at 10k. Get more corms and you can alpha bombers and kikis before the reps ever get a chance to land.
---
Sure. I wonder why they brought up data for how many people login and kill things in the TIS interview when at the time I was logging into eve on 20+ characters (mostly alphas that I might use in the future) and killing 1, 5 or 10 rats each day (15 of which I only login to for queuing up new skills).
---
All CCP is doing it seems is to talk about how splendid everything is going and how their data says everything is great. Why should we trust this when they say they're doing everything to make it better for new players and then they go and make changes that fuck it up for new players.
---
3 minutes till the bigbilltheboss fan club starts posting
---
I think you are missing the point here.         
---
It is way more than ~-6k players.      
---
People are logging in and out constantly so number is much greater.       
---
Data also shows that even if people login those sessions are very short.
---
If you lack imagination to counter these stuka fleets then it's your fault. Don't start crying nerf...
---
catalysts offset freighters.
---
It's normal for people that realize Eve is no longer carebear paradise to leave.  I expect that we will see higher peak numbers in the future because Eve will be a better game.  It is moving in the right direction, even if there is a dip short term.
---
For what its worth, I do not see the decline in my own corp and we are fairly large.  In fact, there has been more meaningful activity after Blackout than before.
---
WoW classic also just launched which will probably pull away the mega carebear crowd and I am okay with that.
---
Correlations doesn't equal causation.
---
M-muh reddit points :'(
---
The economy is far from "balanced", the overall bot numbers have not been reduced, and according to the numbers, which were posted for you here, even if "old hands" are coming back, there is a net decrease in players.  I'm a recruitment officer for the largest group in the game that does ESI checks.  Numbers are down.  Period.  Get your head out of the sand!
---
Chaos era, good time to return... if you're not a nullbear that is. Won't have much fun nullbearing I recon.
---
It's even more exciting being the one attacking the explorer.
---
Could be. I'm graphing what I can prove, and what I can prove are how many players are logged in during "peak-of-peak" time.
---
Nullsec PvP CEO here, absolutely the same story here.
---
Just log in and have feel around?
---
That one actually was very hard to spot - I only accidentally saw it because I scrolled all the way out by mistake.
---
Yikes, blackout is causing the number of ships per month destroyed to go down. This can't be good.
---
haha goon trying to get local back.   
---
Cyno changes are coming boys.
---
I guess this goes with the other guy's thread/data that says the number of ships killed per month is going down.
---
Changing to a star citizen ship purchasing model.
---
there have been promotions all year so its pretty even
---
Flair checks out
---
Probe two wormholes at opposite ends of the solar system, bookmark them, warp between them, and place a bookmark in the middle. Once the wormholes disappear the chance of them both spawning there again is almost 0, so your citadel will be in the middle of nowhere.
---
Have fun starting all over once you want to return. Deleted is deleted, no return.
---
Deleting a fleet with a boosh and a bomb seems Op but on the otherhand thats what you get for anchoring up in 1000000 feroxs for every single fight
---
If by 'fun' you mean blobbing a solo guy and practically perma-ECMing him, then sure.
---
Definitely not wrong about the welp part though.
---
So:
---
1. Eve is dying;
---
2. no local in nullsec at this moment;
---
3. some changes to cynos.
---
So, you need to try yourself.
---
bet you can't afford 200 huginns tho
---
No, of course it happens to test too. The difference is we dont let a hostile astra live directly on our stagings undock. We have definitely lost big ships to this though.
---
Obligatory "Can I has all your stuff?"
---
Bots not logging in ....
---
WoW Classic releases ....
---
There are your number drops. Overall the health of the game is going up.
---
Eve does slump around this time of year though, do you have data of previous year slumps compared to this years?
---
Not going to lie, I didn't expect w-space to look so good on these graphs.
---
Personally I haven’t logged in for more than 15 minutes in the past week and that was to redo some market orders and move a super. 
---
I’m going through the stage of bittervet syndrome where I want to play Eve and think of things to get content. I get home and then I don’t feel like sitting around my computer for 2 hours when there’s a good chance I’ll get 0 content after sitting there for hours. So, I unsubbed my 7 accounts for the first time and will let them lapse within this next month. For the record it’s not all because of the BO, I am in a position currently where the money for 7 accounts could be used elsewhere at this time.
---
Great to see a resurgence correct? Im ex null and think the game is changing for the better.
---
Have fun playing with your self.
---
Yeah stukas dont cloak. This is exactly why people should not have an argument if they know nothing about the doctrine they want nerfed...
---
And if you bring that many they’ll just get bombed and 90% will die, and then the kikis will clean up the rest while the surviving corms split dps because the FC died
---
I am a wormholer yes. If thera is a wormhole haha.
---
What has this got to do with goons ?
---
So taking stuff out of the economy is bad now? This guy gets it.
---
That just links to Eve Berlin....
---
Misinformation on r/eve!? *Gasps* Preposterous!
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-rolling18months.png
---
They show up on the sensor overlay so you really need to just look for blue tics on it to see where they are in space
---
Maybe. You could have done something to flag yourself as suspect, like opening a yellow wreck or can, but it also should have warned you.
---
Bombers are ok. It’s just command DDs are too op.
---
Sure It’s very fun mechanic but it needs nerf seriously.
---
I immediately thought inflation as well but I don't think that's the only factor. I think a big difference is that battles no longer generally result in a full wipe of one entire side. Especially in sub caps, when one side starts to lose they are able to MJD out or had been MJD'ing around so they can leave with fewer losses. Combine that with the nerfs to bombers and the addition of defender missiles and it's become pretty rare for a whole fleet to die. FCs know when they are no longer competitive and correctly try to extract their fleet at that point, hence less stuff dies than say, that bubbled in drake fleet or abaddon gang before MJDs.
---
As a kind of solution for that and a couple of other dumb problems created by MJDs: micro jumping should cause a global cooldown not a module cooldown with the same approximate times they have now. That way it can't simply be spammed.
---
I wrote about it in my open letter to this subreddit:
---

26,620 On Sunday 1st September 2019
---
That's -7344 Players / -21.62% versus the same weekend last year.
---
Well, it's making you badpost on reddit more, that's for sure.
---
We never would have killed 1trill isk if it weren't for the blackout because we all would have been unsubbed still
---
just the dead meat rotting away because CCP turned off the freezer.
---
ccp needs to stop being so fucking lazy and give us an anti bomber capital already ffs i cant even play this bullshit game anymore wait till cyno nerf happens see u in hell ccp because ur gaem is dead in a week
---
good guys win again
---
dialing back your posting 100% is the answer
---
Filter out highsec. Ganking is a majority of the average kills.
---
&gt;Nobody wants to join Goons now that we can't make it a carebear paradise for them
---

Nergal is seriously ok. It’s just not good at every situation.

Not that I particularly care, but people downvote for no fucking reason at all, what the fuck else do u want that response to have? a fucking $5 donation to some child cancer charity or some shit?
---
it has a clear response to why there is a fucking citadel 30AU off, what the fuck else do people need?
---
Actually. Last 2 years didn't have the highly anticipated re-release of a cult classic game called world of Warcraft. I know I have been playing classic this weekend. 
---
And I know I'll log back I to eve when I am done with it I. A few weeks.
---
nice to meet you, i'm chel0007
---
data doesn't care about your feelings.
---
many players do not logging you scrub  
---
many players do not undock, they unsub their alts, they do not create content for roamers, whole game is going more dead
---
Same here, I have recruited more new members in the last couple of weeks then I have in the previous year and a half. WOW classic was a bigger drain on members than anything blackout or CCP caused. Once the WOW hype train is over things will be back to normal if not better than ever.
---
The bots literally moved to high sec lmao
---
lol just another hate against carebear, just another hate against someone other different gameplay, so sad
---
Til the raznaborgs turned up and melted them
---
keep dreamin bb
---
preach on brother!
---
The problem for a lot of people is that there is no ultra hard counter, as in: rofl stomp without taking losses to fight a stuka fleet off. It's almost like people are angry they will lose ships.
---
MaU and DaU Are ThE hIgHesT iT's eVeR beEn iN tHe PaSt 5 YeArS.
---
I think the solution for MJFG is a global timer instead of a module timer. Then it can still be useful but can't be chained constantly.
---
I hope you are right, because otherwise Eve is dead.
---
Also: Wow classic is reported to have login queues going in thousands. If eve players were playing wowc, would it be reasonable assumption they would play eve while waiting for the wowc queue?
---
**Basic business principle**
---
*Acquiring a new customer can cost five times more than retaining an existing customer. Increasing customer retention by 5% can increase profits from 25-95%. The success rate of selling to a customer you already have is 60-70%, while the success rate of selling to a new customer is 5-20%*
---
So it makes sense that CCP would try to keep the existing player base happy over trying to attract new players.
---
Generates plenty of r/Eve lurkers but not always Eve players...
---
Yes, having large fleets is something you should never do in eve, its just stupid and doesnt do anything anyways /s
---
22k acounts are logged in not players
---
Maybe more players play with only one account currently
---
&gt; small group that defends your space
---
means getting rewarded
---
&gt; large group that defends your space

means getting punished.

There's your entire position. Stop pretending otherwise

Not only does Thera have Local, but it's now a HS system with CONCORD-esque SOE police.

Seriously. WoW has this effect on other games when it releases a new expansion, let alone classic which is going to be a different level of hype (whether it lasts is another discussion, although my money is on "yes").
---
You're not wrong but some of those leet pvpers are just as entitled
---
Better than ever
---
Nah it just goes with every other "EVE is dying coz CCP nerfed me" thread ever.
---
I've generated a new found appreciation for station interiors over the past few weeks.
---
Playerbase is down nearly 40% in just a few months of changes... so more room for opportunity 
---
If you were null, you’ll make far more safer and more isk in hisec or wormholes now.  
---
Wormholers/hisec “pvpers” who come to null to hunt out number farmers in most places now... significantly
---
So it just depends on your playstyle
---
First, there have been a lot more bot bans.
---
Second, this is labor day weekend in the US. 
---
Third, need YTY comparisons.
---
The answer is removing their explosion velocity bonus. The missile damage formula is much more forgiving to oversize guns hitting undersized targets, and with their explosion velocity bonus, torps coming out of bombers have better explosion velocity than heavy missiles.
---
Activity is wayyy down , there are some changes to game. Depending how invested you are in terms of characters, it's made life real easy for me. I can log on now and finally hunt with zero effort, total casually. Its really good. They're about to nerf cynos soon so you'll be able to kill pretty much everything you catch with certainty if you have friends 
---
It's a good time to casually kill shit with very low effort. Give it a try you may enjoy the changes
---
Last time you were saying it was bots, not you are saying its players. Who is really quiting?
---
Alone no, but it is a strong indicator in many situations, including this one.
---
Hardly.
---
There is plenty of content.
---
wasnt there a major war going on in the summer of last year? still alot less then 2017/16
---
Promotions don't really show on graphs like this, if you are logged in for 5 seconds that changes nothing unless 10000 other people decide to claim their free SP at the exact same moment....
---
for a grand total of 3 days, just like null drifters.
---
Logged in numbers have been heavily declining since May this year, way before the blackout. One could even argue the numbers have gone downhill steadily since November 2018.
---
Usually the numbers go up after the summer, correct. But they barely did last year. 
---
So unless you have a way to factor the steady decline from the game being stale and boring in you cannot make any analytics from this set of data.
---
I looked at https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Expansion#2012 and it listed FW at Inferno that made me think it was added back then.
---
Looking at the patch notes for Retribution, there were a lot of changes. Skimming through it, it seems the current FW complex system was introduced in Retribution. Besides that ship hulls like the algos and so on which are nice in FW and also in general :)
---
Was the increase in activity noted back then and how was it explained? It would be nice to have the lowsec numbers high again.
---
CCP be like: We didn't want those players anyway, already replaced, adapt or die.
---

---
IDK man. Having flown in Pandos stuka fleets quite a bit in recent times it goes the same way every time: You find the target and it lights a Cyno. 100 (Super-)caps jump in. At this point you cant reasonable kill anything anymore besides maybe some dreads or fax that bumped and were dumb enough to siege. 
---
Yes the bombers don't rly die to the Supercaps but thats not because they can fight it but because they MJD out defang and try to be quicker to the next target than the fighters which in most cases is not entirely possible and some CMDDs die in the process thus limiting the time you can "dance".
---
It's removed.
---
Economy balanced? Ok! Lol
---
carriers or supercarriers with 2/3 drone navs and light fighters are one of the best counters to Stuka fleets. You launch fighters and tell them to attack a boosher then approach it with MWD on whenever the fleet is within 100km. They will boosh off and you recall fighters and wait for them to come back in. Killing booshers is the most effective way to deal with these fleets.
---
Siding with PL gave me aids, but a fun fight nonetheless.
---
risk free? really? looks how ships are designed. hulk and mackinaw has zero tank and defend capability, so only reason why undock them is in safe place and safe time.  -&gt; same logic you can see with all other ships and it is as well reason why big null sec entities have Keepstar highways or so...
---
replace fu.. mack or hulk with mining is like 20hours of unboosted mining. same with expensive ore mining things and mining implants. all is risk vs reward, when reward is shit and risk hi, we just see huge players decline
---
You got downvoted for being a pretentious douchebag. 
---
Nexxxxxttt!
---
Your goal is 100 people?....... Really?!?
---
All I see is 591 dudes who can't 10 box rorqs anymore so they quit... ;)
---
what we need is that koreans kick Hilmar off job  :-P
---
So...
---
The same reason people have been mad that the counter to supers is costly...?
---
Oh look, someone interjecting their opinion instead of countering the verifiable facts that I presented, all in the name of getting one over on Goons.  How....original.
---
A lot of fun right now.
---
CCP is throwing a lot of kinks in the works for the 'super umbrella, max pve' gameplay. Remains to be seen if that will effect how the large null sec groups work / new meta will develop.
---
Regardless, my recommendation is finding a small to medium roaming alliance and giving it a go. I personally am having some of the best times of my EvE career right now. A lot of my old friends returned as well.
---
85% of statistics are made up on the spot
---
true i think inflation have some part here, but players are getting richer too(espec in null)
---
You missed the sarcasm.
---
We've gone from 2 to 30 in about 4 weeks, half of those in a very selective Corp. If you play Eve for PvP or non-bot non-Fat PvE, the game is undoubtedly heading in a better direction.
---
That’s the same issue people have with tracking titans and supers that apply to drugs.  “there’s no counter besides not fighting them or catching them in a mistake”
---
It’s cancer on both sides, but both sides defend their preferred playstyle... unfortunately marshy and olmecca are LOUD , as are most of the “small gang” crowd.
---
/s? I hope?
---
CCP cannot be happy about the game's situation if they are still looking at long term health of the game. TQ almost looks like the last phase on the chinese server. At the same time it is unimportant how many chars are logged as as long as subscriptions remain about the same - if that one guy with 12 PLEXed alts keeps loggin in or not or just one account that he might directly pay and another \~ 10 players stick around because the PLEX prices are high enough to get enough content from a "netflix-alike-PLEX" fee. 
---
They have marketing problems with no other content than PvE but also a lot of PvE players do not have many choices where to go to and whom to join.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you are arguing against here. - What I said was that the activity map doesn't support the "fights everywhere!" thing, not that *I* was having problem getting fights. I personally get more fights than I have time for, most days. Making going out to find fights very much pointless.
---
This is why satire is dead. People are so dumb that every moron response is more than likely serious.
---
I mean, a titan can do the same thing so?
---
The best way to play eve doesn't involve logging in. Get with the meta noob
---
Sorry, I figured it was, but I've seen very similar posts recently that were basically the same.
---
I'm sorry this game is so hard for you :(
---
It's sad, isnt it?
---
It’s a good thing eve is a game where people don’t log in and just go afk after finding a reason to log in
---
Or you’d really have a point here
---
Always.  Even then, it affect's the job's numbers partially, but fully to where it should be.
---
I thought they were mad because it's cheap? Make your mind up!
---
Oh wow, one doctrine doesn’t use a cloak. That makes a difference?
---
I'm not talking about Hulks, lol.  They were vulnerable before and they still are.  Ever try killing a Rorqual in Delve or Eso?  Ever trying killing a super in a super umbrella?
---
&gt; when reward is shit and risk hi
---
The great thing about the Eve economy is that it adjusts.  If the new normal is much lower profits across the board, everything will readjust.  You can't compare incomes post Blackout to pre-Blackout.  Pre-Blackout was a massive bubble just like the housing bubble was in the real world.  
---
It got to the point where I was 5 boxing Rorquals while playing other games...  I lost 2-3 excavs total and one was to NPCs...
---
Its was coming to a close IIRC, But yeah, There was a war which seemingly was propping it somewhat.
---
Data really offends you, doesn’t it?
---
to pretend that 2 bridging titans were strategic assets and to imply that their loss will be felt is legit as retarded as "didn't want those titans anyway" and I know you know that, don't be obtuse to protect some retard boonie on reddit you're better than that
---
Yup. For Salt Miners, I have never been richer either 🤣
---
Do I really need to respond to this? Fine I will...
---
No it's not 100 people, the website picks intermittent goals and when one of them is achieved the goal increases incrementally. Feel stupid yet? oh right, now u will post some witty comment that "you are just at X votes lol u dumb", prove me right!
---
As once said by my uncle Tyrone the III, "Bitches naught shit, but hoes and jests"
---
Some people feel like the game should stop bc they did, despite being a lil drop in the big eve ocean.
---
thats why we need some more mechanics that will drive players into wars, into invade other regions. (for ex. depletion of resources in region/const/sys?) I think there are a lot of ways.
---
We're not shitting om Krabbing.
---
We're shitting on the whitney fucks that complain that everything that can force them into PvP is "overpower", or "broken", or "stupid ganker bullshit".
---
What fit bomber is 50mill
---
100% of your posts are pants-on-head retarded.
---
&gt; but some of those leet pvpers are just as entitled
---
I agree with you there, but in their defense, they had to deal with Eve getting safer and safer for years and they played on.  When CCP finally starts going in the other direction, people start threatening to unsub 15 accounts.  You can see how they would just laugh in that person's face and remind them that WoW classic just launched.
---
k, then I will apply the same judgement to you... i did not start this, remember that...
---
This
---
\+1 will try to get data from MERs
---
If you're getting hit by bombs in moomins and beamfessors maybe you're not as amazing as your name suggests. ;)
---
Magikarp used *3 paid year long subs signing out.*!
---
But nothing happened!
---
Accounts consume PLEX. People do not.
---
stuka are not op, they're just meta in world where the only response they get is capitals that apply poorly to them. it pains me to agree with marshy, but the problem is not in the stuka but in the brain of those dropping caps against them.
---
Imagine losing ships in a game where the core loop is losing ships.
---
Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Goons are normally the ones to cry to CCP to get things nerfed that counter or don't benefit their organisation.
---
Damn mod bias
---
Number of characters logged in going down: definitely yes. Players declining: we don't know. We have to wait and see CCP's financial numbers later this year to actually see that.
---
The game is very alive, we are getting lots of fun skirmishes every day, way more than we used to.
---
Ssh, their narrative...
---
Do I look like the kind of person that knows what [Change.Org](https://Change.Org) is?  I'm curious as to how you're so familiar with it. I mean, given the focus on Women's Rights, Human Rights, Economic Injustice, and saving the whales,  I'm surprised you have time to play Eve at all
---
there we go right on the nail! k let me rephrase what you just said, you will still retort with some retarded ass shit but hey, it's only fun for me...
---
Do I look like the kind of person that knows what EvE online is? I'm curious as to how you're so familiar with it. I mean, given the focus on Spaceships, Game economy, Mining, ingame Politics, I'm surprised you have time to play live an actual life
---
That's just a normal safe spot created by warping from A to B and dropping a bm in the middle. Wouldn't get you a deep safe...
---
there are plenty rorq, super, even faction titans killed under umbrella, it is more about good prepare, execute bait, have good FC, surprise moment.  
---
there was no income buble, just blue donut and everyone crabbing like as well now outside east. VNI nerf and blackout hit just small entities, roamers and there is no fu target in space for them. bounty decreased, but mining as only reliable income now is same as before, because rorq can be saved, but carrier or any subcap has 0 time to be saved. all is about that ppl do not log in, donot have ships in space, even hunters are much less now...
---
Honestly, have no position on the matter. Dunno if this is because of the blackout but it was bound to happen. But as long as other tools are available for info I dont reckon it would be fair to just ban this. But dunno.
---
As some one who actually hunts, Null is more target rich in ththe past few months, than in years.
---
Imagine thinking that because one of the two titans had a bridge fit neither are strategic assets that wont be missed on the next max cta.
---
Next level big brain.
---
Or they go somewhere else and you sit there in your capital with jump timer and wonder what you are doing with your life.
---
Well you see them coming and if you stay still or gang warp at them at 30km you deserve to be bombed
---
School has started up again. That might have an impact.
---
Literally the doctrine being discussed? yes lol
---
Is that the best you've got? They all forgot/couldn't be bothered to log out? 
---
It's a good thing that's the lamest excuse ever...
---
Or you'd really have a point here. ;)
---
TQ is almost like Serenity now. The shape of nullsec basically has been changed by injectors, citadels and capital changes right when WWB ended. Now there are only two options if you want some security in null: either join Goons or TAPI. The other entitities, especially NCPL, have not guessed the power of the game changes and maybe only a few even in Goons predicted the outcome. Goons have won null and the other entities (except TAPI) couldn't keep up and will not be able to even equal Goons development in the last two years unless CCP finds a way to break the game up. 
---
At this point though anything they could do to break up the blue donut would hurt the little guy even more than the big guy. Hilmar (now playing the game again apparently) doesn't seem to be happy about the game and the few good devs are probably scratching their head what to do. Bold moves need to be done and already some have been done. The next two years will be bloody but hopefully EVE will turn out to be more healthy again.
---
Its not why people complain your just so wrong its funny lol.
---
It can't run in my phone
---
Or the one to rule them all; Crayola Magic
---
I’ve seen far fewer bots since the first few days of the blackout.
---
No, but "EVE is dying" threads do. If it's dead just leave, I won't miss you.
---
It’s not a pain to clear PI information. Any modern company has a procedure for it.
---
&gt; I hope you are right, because otherwise Eve is dead.
---
I hope hes wrong so I can stop seeing these stupid fucking "Eve is Dying/Eve isnt dieing" posts on r/eve.
---
My anecdotal observations are:
---
\- There are less people playing in my null alliance
---
\- There are less people showing up for any fleets
---
\- There are less people in null sec period, most space is just empty
---
\- There are less people to hunt in null and it takes lots of time to find anyone even using Dotlan / Map data
---
This is not a good thing.  I want more targets or the potential for larger numbers of targets.  I guess this is somewhat good for solo players but it still takes 20-30 jumps even using WH's to find something to shoot.
---
Yeah, I agree 100%. 
---
Turns out most bombers don’t use that doctrine...
---
Welcome to r/eve? It's been like that for years.
---
lol and you just did not noticed now is space empty...  
---
13b killed in August, 2b killed in July and all kills are just t1 shit as it is usual after blackout. well good game
---
I get this resentment towards blocs but whats the alternative? And how do we get there?
---
Cause I dont see any reasons to fight but I do see reasons to be blued up. And as CCP has shown us, they can change whatever they like without any care for player input, meaning that in the end they set the rules for the sandbox.
---
You know the Eagles almost every null block uses are extremely adept at murdering booshers from anywhere from 0m to 250km right?
---
You're not missing much.
---
Same
---
If you can form supers and mid them you can form a subcap fleet.
---
bomber are shit. Fly one solo in NS and you will what kind of target you will kill :D
---
But in a group, it has a good dps against cap!
---
And Yeah Pando stukka &lt;3
---
Lmao alright buddy
---
Its ok for the things it can do but i miss something to check skill requirements for ships/mods (like the info window ingame). 
---
But i'm happy that i dont have to log to change my skills.
---
Last time I checked titans can't chain boosh.
---
nice to meet you psycho, i'm chel0007
---
Same applies for every use of bombers, you see a hound and you HAVE to react or you will eat shit.
---
lol that is just your wish... and Iam sure you count into it that worth time flying around empty systems
---
So what I'm reading is, a fleet that is skill based and requires a significant amount of effort and coordination but can be crippled, beats the one that doesnt? Weird mechanics I tell ya...
---
What?  You can change skills?
---
Meh I missed the first sentence where it said ‘Stuka’ 
---
I know nothing about them except they don’t cloak apparently. If only that was the meta that the other 99% of bombers used, maybe we wouldn’t have a problem.
---
My biggest issue with bombers in general is that they’re almost impossible to catch when fitted how they’re bonused unless they fuck up.
---
Never even seen a stuka bomber fleet, but if they don’t cloak then we could actually defend against them instead of just scaring them off
---
Personally I think Stukas are absolutely fine against caps, and could perhaps be even stronger against them.
---
However, I think they are a bit too strong against the average sub fleet, even soft counters can just get outright deleted by bomb spam if you make even a single mistake.
---
Still seems were pretty close to 2015,16, and to a lesser extent 2017.
---
Congrats on 1T! The game needs more small blops teams, always makes me happy to see them do well. 
---
Except when they drop on me, fuck those guys lol
---
Now stop being a whiney bitch
---
because the game is a shell of what it was an a fraction of that shell of what it could've been.
---
the game used to be amazing, but it was run into the ground from around 2012-2018 by incompetent, lazy, greedy, or stupid developers
---
First ten entries = 32263 +/- 1993
---
Second ten entries = 30232 +/- 1686
---
Hypothesis that these are different: P = 0.22
---
Please try again when you have data of any statistical significance.
---
I see mar5hy is keeping up the whaler btw~ posts now Olmeca is at the CSM summit.
---
I got it. Basically, the pvp in the game is all hype. 
---
At least in fighting games if you talk shit, you better show up and put some dollars on the line or you're going to get clowned on till you stop showing up. You put your rep and money on the line and it sticks with you forever. No alts, no blueballing, no credit card warrioring, no batphoning. 
---
Thanks for enlightening me. I wasted a fucking year and a half on this sorry ass casual spreadsheet bullshit with people who have high social awkwardness issues. Fml
---
Risk averse Players that never undock to fight and only crab might be viewed by CCP that way.
---
If only there were tools to avoid getting bombed
---
Get out of here with your fact supported opposition to blackout, reddit doesn't take kindly to their narrative being disrupted.
---
Can you elaborate, that’s kinda vague.
---
Do you mean be in the site when DT starts?
---
yes, without a doubt
---
Its really not. 
---
Before I'd spend three hours flying around checking towers and seeing, yup, another bot, ratting 24/7 that isntawapred. Again. For the 93rd time tonight. 
---
Now I find something I can kill inside of an hour. Period.
---
I dunno if that would work tho. A huge part of why people are blued up are because they need to ensure Rorqs survive. If pushed people might just have more reasons to blue up. And if the game joins together in fk NS chants then its also more likely that NS bands together vs the rest of the game.
---
But it could also work, think it has to be massively drastic though. Like erasing (and refunding) all capitals in the game whilst opening up a pure NPC region with the materials needed for capital building. Or something like it but no matter what the Rorqs scaleability needs to vanish. If there is no more reason to be blue then people will most likely not be blue.
---
It uses a 12hr clock. What the fuck.
---
Nice C3 u got there
---
That statement is as intelligent as the no local = no bots thing ;)
---
&gt; risk free? really?
---
yes
---
And look what happens to people who do find us.
---
Laughs in long range Jackdaw
---
Facts don't support this post.
---
Yes, you can add/remove/change order of skills
---
Yea classic wow is pretty big atm so that for sure has an effect. Personally i like the changes for the most part. I agree caps didn't need cynos but limiting them to a while 10 ships kinda blows.
---
You are also forgetting the fact that it has never been easier to actually acquire new titans. We have also never seen as many active supers/titans as now.
---
I am so excited for the first time we drop bombers on the nerds who keep telling us how happy they are for the cyno changes :)
---
Thoughts to all the hunters thinking "ohhh yeah lots of juicy kills!" The people you want to hunt will likely simply stop ratting that way and switch to cheaper/slow tick/easy replaceable ships. Carriers are not exactly great now, this will IMO mostly kill off their use for ratting. Supers may continue but would likely all be pre-prepped with a recon ready to bring the pain. Result is that those krabbers you DO find will only be the prepared ones.
---
Did you ever get so angry at your girlfriend that you broke up with her, but you didn't really mean it, and now don't know what to do when she moves on and starts dating younger guys?
---
These guys have.
---
The problem isn't as much blued bull blocks as it is a combination of injectors, cap proliferation, rorqs and enough resources that huge numbers can fit under on umbrella 
---
I dont know if there is more conflict if you need multiple umbrellas, ir I'd multiple umbrellas mean a bloc would fracture, but it seems there is at least a greater chance than there is if resources are unlimited and can all fit under one umbrella.
---
Are we talking about the same app?
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.ccp.tech.mobile
---
That’s the idea behind them, but I was in Init for a while, and we’d routinely go up against boosh eagles from Panfam  with stukas and win. So, obviously they don’t actually work that well in practice
---
AAR : snuff tackled 2 Hels in anomaly. system was jammed when dreads gate from previous system. when dreads waiting to warp. they offline the jammer and back online jammer. dreads warp in to grid shooting hel, GOTG jumped supers fleet to grid. snuff respond 43 dreads.

snuff losing all caps. RR losing 2 Titans

You're looking at the old one. Click the developer name to see the new one. [EVE Portal 2019](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccpgames.eveportal2android)
---
You will still see it, even if its sarcastically or a directed comment.
---
I have seen many people from my corp liquidate their heavy assets in null (rorquals, supercaps) and take all that isk to hisec to run t5 abyssals, incursions, or market trading instead of utilizing nullsec. I would argue that from my point of view it seems to be the rather opposite, a migration of players from null -&gt; hisec. I also personally know 4 people that quit the nullsec game and decided to go back to hisec because null wasn't appealing anymore, because of the constant nerfs, and losing trust in CCP, not knowing how much farther null/capitals are going to be nerfed. 2 of them decided to take a sabbatical from eve and play other games indefinitely because it just wasn't fun anymore because of the constant nerfs from capital ships, to cynos, to blackout.
---
The botting argument is also absurd as they literally packed their shit and moved to hisec.
---
&gt;even Bob came back as NC.
---
errr what
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccpgames.eveportal2android
---
Well, no? While bombers are incredibly slippery, I don’t think they’re overpowered dps/tank wise.
---
If one bomber tries to take on my ratting ship, then he’s the one gonna eat shit. If 10 show up, then yeah I’ll go down but not before taking one or two with me. 
---
Regardless, because of the cloak I’m gonna run anyway because no point taking some chance there’s not more behind him. 
---
Give me stukas every time so I can know whether or not to engage.
---
turns out thats literally the most used bomber doctrine right now...
---
These things are freaking everywhere. I'm wondering if/when CCP plans to add more monuments to the game to give us some variety...
---
*CCP wont do it for you..* are you sure about that?
---
Booshing is a bit OP no matter how you paint it. 
---
The other side of the argument is that you cant realistically get enough people in fleet to counter these fleets. And if you do they can just disengage meaning you just spent a ton of manhours for nothing. The attackers have no reason to stay longer than they want, the defenders are forced to do it.
---
So really, the blame goes all around and hate towards capitals is a bit meh. 
---
Example, the other day we were fighting 4 different fleets with this setup at once with about 600 in total. No timers, no warnings (direct warnings atleast), just 600 people to fight at a moments notice. Can you imagine the work it would take to counter these with subs? And if you manage to get enough together to actually fight them, do you think they would stay on grid or just moonwalk out of there? You know the answer.
---
May I know of which entries you are talking? Which statistical test are you using? Just throwing words like hypothesis and P and significannce around doesn't mean anything.
---
I understand what you saying , but he will not. It's hard to look at the world around you when you head is up your ass.
---
wait how the hell did you know it was a c3
---
Lmao at goons going to hisec for not having enough ratting income. Then you truly must be lazy.
---
question isnt why they are bitter but why are they still posting here
---
Source on that? I’m not saying they’re not, but I’ve yet to see a single bomber fleet without a cloak. Because if they don’t then they’re not getting out alive unless they cynoed in and bring their blops in with them. Which is fine with me, give us the chance to whelp your blops while you try and bridge out.
---
There's a thing that destroyers can fit to kill incoming bombs with impunity, you know. And how bad do you have to be to get bombed in corms??
---
400 plus bombers, Kikis, AFs supported by 40 booshers led by competent FCs will murder stuff. The issue here is neither a lack of doctrine nor the lack of competency of the average F1 pusher, it's just numbers. If three fleets amass to such a force you just have to accept your fait as the one being caught.
---
Not every entity is capable of flashforming a subcap fleet that can hold the ground against even the initial bomber fleet, hence upshipping with the pilots available is in most cases still a good option.
---
they want the game to get better, just like everyone else
---
Very exact same story actually. You made my miserable life clearer.
---
Seethe red tinge on the skybox.
---
The propaganda game covers the last two.
---
holy shit lmao never knew that
---
Write it in a blog. /r/eve isn't the only place in the internet.
---
Fuck snuff
---
Right, and what new argument are you going to make next week when the numbers keep dropping?
---
Because we can. We carried this game since 2003 and you should be grateful we gave CCP alot of money to keep it afloat so YOU could have an Eve to play today. So as a retirement gift. We will shitpoast this thread until the sun burns out.
---
Truth, but the trend is pretty clearly seen before WoW.  
---
Denial....it’s not just another river in Egypt. :-)
---
If for what ever reason people do not want to believe the premise that the current changes to the game are talking a negative toll on player logon (sadly the only metric we will ever have), and that the trend over the last several months seems to at least be continuing, they will not believe.  
---
It really really is not that hard to look at a graph to see a problem.  Eve has actually been pretty stable over the last several years till Blackout and the recent public shift by CCP to shake things up.   You can easily see months of downward shift players that really does not look to be slowing up soon.  
---
Oh well...like most trends like this, I will become more obvious as time goes by, darn darn guys, it’s pretty fricking obvious now.
---
yeah but why if you have no stake in the game and claimed to quit? should literally dust your hands off and move on with your life
---
Ok, that one.  Yea, it doesn't have industry, wallet stuff....
---
oh capri backed it up on [his blog](https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc) apparently
---
Honestly, trying to convince certain people that we are experiencing issues due to a way unbalanced change is like trying to convince some that the world isnt flat. No amount of data is gonna convince them because they can see the horizon with their own eyes.
---
Every super is bad when you have 2-3 FAX in fleet against dreadbomb...
---
For the game to be healthy there needs to be a good mix of a lot of different play styles. It's fun to say fuck carebears etc, but those are the same guys building all the ships and modules everyone uses.
---
Why do people who get divorced still bitch about their ex wife?
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
Theres too many moons in some systems like above 15.  Perhaps make it planet based instead
---
every wh has its own "glow" spend time in wh long enough you reckognise them just by sight. eveuniwiki has some nice screenshots off every wh visual
---
The more you fit to your ship, the more you lose.
---
So fitting nothing is the ultimate play.
---
to clarify the "spend time in wh long enough"part, i meant scan in wh long enough, cause we all know who the content finder and content leechers are...yes im talking about you krabbing lazy ass bitches that make billions while we do the work to find you content :)
---
Stukas arent glass cannons, they use a tanky fit and logi and utilize command dessis with micro jump field generators. in addition they often have Kikis running together with them. lately pretty much all larger blocs have adopted them. INIT invented them and Test/legacy uses a similar doctrine which they named differently (forgot the name they use but its essentially the same doctrine). by now panfam, winterco and Bombers bar have adopted them too, PL and Therabois use something similar but they only use kikis. waffles use armor kikis i think. its noteworthy that groups that use them often work together and give eachother intel on wormhole connections as these fleets move via wormholes, not via blops.
---
It takes more than a single mistake to get bombed by bombers that don't have cloaks while you're in frigates or destroyers.
---
Ahh i'm talking about this one
---
I just came back to Eve this summer (originally started in 2006, 70m sp intermittently accumulated from 2006 to 2014). Eve has improved much. It's still basically the same game, but there is a ton more content. It is definitely more fun. One of the biggest changes it that high-sec is dangerous. While I agree that it shouldn't be perfectly safe, CCP seems convinced that all players must be 100% attuned to what's happening around them and having had taken every possible precaution to avoid harm at all times. CCP really makes it easy, profitable, and (importantly) *sustainable* to be a suicide ganker. Thus, the game in all aptitudes demands a great deal more attention now. I think this probably a mixed-bag for the game, as now there aren't really many ways to play the game semi-AFK while attending to other things, like work, children, and family members (which a lot of players have now because we've aged along with the game). I'm guessing this probably causes a lot of people to stop playing.  
---
I'll also mention that there aren't really any other major trade hubs besides Jita anymore (which is an absolute shithole with the station constantly surrounded my ships whose primary design function is ganking). I'm sure the game design choices that resulted in the atrophy of Amarr, Dodixie, Rens, and Hek are complex. The emergence of primary cities in the real world is multifaceted and complex. I'm guessing transport infrastructure has played a major role in this (e.g. *possibly* the prevalence of jump bridges, jump freighters, and so forth, negates the need for more local trade hubs.) Minor trade hubs like Orvolle are just dead. This may have resulted from game design choices that had other intentions, but this has had a big impact on the game. It's kind of sad though because this has negatively impacted opportunities for trade and transport industries. There are no more "trade routes" really. 
---
Eve is amazing. My only wish is that it wouldn't be so punishing to new players. I also lament that they abandoned ambulation. Yes, I know you used to be able to walk around in a room alone, but that was dumb. You know, maybe if you could actually interact and socialize with other players that would have caught on?)
---
Still, despite all this I'm very happy to be back in game. Mostly it has improved. I have to go to work now, but what I really want to do is play more Eve, talk about Eve, think about Eve...
---
Hold on, lemme pull one more outta my bag o' bullshit
---
'Classic WoW'
---
god damn it
---
Can you Art.17 GDPR your reddit account as well... thanks.
---
Bots do affect me because the ISK they dump into the economy devalues the ISK that I make through legitimate gameplay.
---
never knew that
---
thanks :o
---
True, but I have a feeling that If that proposed change went though, we'd see locustfleet also have a focus on ice mining in addition to ore, so the only real people who'd be impacted are those outside the stockpiles of the big groups.
---
We lost a lot of boys to classic wow last week
---
Are there any communities for getting help with Epic Arcs? This Showtime mission is just impossible for me right now and I could do with a hand from someone who knows what they're doing
---
Clean wipe the servers and reset to 2003
---
but then I'll have to have another ship in my doctrine!!!!
---
\&gt;So now its time to put them caps away and bring something \[Else\] to counter
---
I don't think you quite realise how important it is for capitals to be the final word in every battle. 0.0 is and must be designed around capital warfare, and everything else that happens needs to be subordinated to that primary design goal.
---
1 hour on the naughty step while you think about what you just did and why it's bad, mister.
---
Now.
---
Don't make me count to 3
---
I am totally confident that CCP will do it for them.
---
frat needs more morale pings
---
O NO MY MIDTERMS. TEST IS DOOMED IN 3 MONTHS JUST HOLD TILL THEN
---
&gt;However, I think they are a bit too strong against the average sub fleet,
---
The average sub fleet that doesn't get ultramurdered by capitals, this would be?
---
Link isn't working... I just see it saying loading...
---
I've noticed the same both with my own alliance and bigger ones that are around. I've heard similar stories from so many people...
---
My alliance is a smaller one. We were a fairly new startup and we were finally getting some real momentum going with good numbers of people active every day and *bam* blackout hit and the group basically died because most of them would rather play other games or go to highsec than deal with adapting. And, honestly, I can't blame them. It's not like they're obligated to play.
---
Admittedly, yes, most were nullbears. Contrary to popular belief, though, I can't see where driving the nullbears out of the game is good for it. Less targets to shoot, less activity in general.
---
Don't leave us :(
---
&gt;Booshing is a bit OP no matter how you paint it.
---
SuperCarriers that can point, web, paint, DPS, superDPS, ECM burst and bubble project mean that booshers aren't OP; everything that isn't boosh is grossly underpowered.
---
Good to know, but still this is a counterable doctrine. 
---
While they seem strong, they can still be engaged with a proper fleet comp.
---
So long as we stay on top of our local wormhole connections and use scouts, as we have been even before blackout.
---
Just look at the battle report from that Stuka Fleet vs TEST fight the other day. If even half of their carriers/dreads/supers had been in Muninns, it's basically an easy clean-up for TEST. At minimum they keep the bombers at bay long enough to successfully defend the Rorqs. 
---
Instead the "easiest" solution is to ping, undock caps, and jump them to a cyno. The result is the Rorqs dying and numerous other caps going down while titans desperately try lancing bombers before they can boosh.
---
The real strenght of stuka/goku fleets is the combination of afterburners and booshers, which allows the fleet to sig/speed tank long-range guns/fighters and to boosh away if needed to outmaneuver mwd doctrines. Bombers aren't OP, neither are chain booshes but they are definetly very strong. I believe I heard a CCP employee saying that they're looking at chain booshes though.
---
&gt;Sure It’s very fun mechanic but it needs nerf seriously.
---
What non-boosh subcap doctrine would you use to operate on grid with massed supercarriers?
---
Assume that your goal isn't being roflstomped within a couple of minutes.
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah what a dumbass. There are absolutely tools to avoid getting bombed, and he's a stupid nub for now knowing about them.
---
Like what other reasonable interpretation is there? Genuinely curious.
---
We use our pedals for push to talk, real goons know F1 has to be mashed with face.
---
So much pointless propaganda on both sides
---
just remove chunks of space. start with delve.
---
How dare you sir!
---
Poor Frat, I feel really sorry for them. They just want to make some honest isk and dino smoothbrains keep fucking it up.
---
exactly, they can be countered. people just rarely do it properly but complain about grr bombers anyway. hence this post lol.
---
quality players that input broadcast to set up their 100 man afk cloaking setup lmao
---
I suppose that is one way of never flying what you cannot afford to lose.
---
yeah lol, it's not like OP's request will make an EVE dev's working day a living hell be having to wrench open the server, and prying out a tiny little component out of a live server to remove his 'data'. It's usually just a press of a button to run a few scripts and voila!
---
Lmao imagine still thinking caps are OP and subcaps (specifically bombers) aren't
---
test v frt right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAnxpv-XuPE
---
Mixed fleets?  That's heresy.
---
Cormorants are cheaper and would work fine :)
---
&gt; 2019-09-02 15:03:36 Reticuli Zeta I thought i hated TEST before. Now so even more. The tactics they employ now are just low. 15 of them swoop onto one of our corms. 20 of them warp in to destroy a cheap Ibis cyno ship. Like scavengers. Sometimes it seems, especially at night time in the CN timezone, they have free reign of O3-4MN and can just do as they please. Coming up to our structures to try and taunt us. We must CRUSH them! 
---
This warms my little black heart.
---
Thank you very much, I hope there shall be more good reads for you in the future.
---
Ok, I'll bite. This is not a "EvE is dying" thread, there is no declaration of "im quitting cos everyone else is". Its a data driven observation, a concern that this game we play is getting less and less activity. 
---
  We WANT the player count to increase to make this game more fun.
---
Blur missed a few things.
---
This is all theory. You know it doesnt happen all that often in reality.
---
nobody mentioning the real victims: t1 battleships
---
Oh no, you posted shit again!
---
If a bomb radius intersects with a cyno, there should be a bonus chain effect.
---
is he mad we killed a cyno ibis?
---
&gt; Can you imagine the work it would take to counter these with subs?
---
no. that´s just bottom level PvP readiness for everyone but F1 pushing doctrine monkeys.
---
and hisec
---
It's just the MVP
---
So instead of CCP fixing core gameplay issues and balancing existing issues, you want them to invest heavily into unrelated content?
---
People have discussed splitting the roles of the bomber into two groups. A bomber type bomber for bombing and another bomber for torping. While we are at it we need a bomber with dank skins and cruse missiles for cruising around town.  Strait up nerfs to stats are not the answer.
---
Maybe it's rose-tinted glasses, but I feel like my alliance's line members were classier and smarter back in the day. We were probably worse at Eve back then, but still, we recruited some damn good people off the back of not being shitheads. 
---
Then again, that could just be the PoV of a doe-eyed bean, new to the world and innocent to null politics.
---
Its not **just** pointless propaganda, we're also hiding supers in it
---
When I did trading a couple years ago I used [evetrademaster.com](https://evetrademaster.com) but that seems to be down. Is there an alternative web site that allows me to track profits on a handful of items?
---
Tbh we're just culling the weak from the herd.
---
captials shouldnt be an "iwin" button, all other ships in Eve (BS, BC, Cruiser) have tracking issues against small stuff why should capitals be any different? You think titans should be able to track frigates/dessies? Fucking stupid
---
Wow... ACTUAL statistical data to point to. Much better than touchy feely shitposts.
---
That's what they want you to think....really it just says "waaaah blackout".
---
Tbh EVE's appeal is it's niche. Video games that try to appeal to everyone are the most boring ones.
---
frt salt is up there.
---
your post has a mass appeal problem
---
plus a few more
---
People are litterally retarded.
---
Noooooo Seddowwwwwww
---
I had to add an /s to end of my comment because even the OP fell for it :-(
---
Still not as bad as the WoW classic sub. I made one comment and got banned from there already 😂
---
What was the last big change ccp implemented? Upwell in 2016? When are these core changes coming? They have had over 3 years and still the population is falling. What about another 3 years? 6? 8?
---
Drains my battery. No delimeters in figures. No wallet/order/contract data. No notifications. Literally useless for me. Deleted today.
---
Niche is great, unless you like games with a sustainable player base.
---
And correlation isn't causation. The data shows that login numbers are down. It doesn't show that EVE is dying *because* of the blackout, no matter how much you feel like it should.
---
I respect your perspective dude, but you have to accept that due to the innovation of the guys at the top of nullsec they made it too easy for poorly trained, skilled and experienced guys to do well in the game without much effort on their own part.
---
The new changes correct that, they focus on pushing to put it bluntly shit players out of null and back into highsec where they belong.
---
Those that move to hisec and then drop into lowsec quickly, move out of fear or lack of protection from their nullsec masters.
---
Lowsec is the new nullsec. Those valuable moons in lowsec are being mined and protected like golden nuggets and the MER in 12 months time will show that.
---
Those experienced and skilled players who can survive in nullsec will do well when the next update pushes a buff their way.
---
im okay with that
---
Guns are grouped, most ppl have them mapped to f1(default)
---
Delve is the most active region in the game.
---
Yes imagine if we were smart and had a whole team of Strat FC's ready to step in instead of only have one able person. If only we had that... Wait... hang on... We do!
---
Imagine you can guess the flair of the poster by reading the post.
---
And sometimes i think posters with spodswarm flair are not flair baiting.
---
I challenge you to find any group that can counter 600 people for a defense fleet with subs. At a moments notice. Find me anyone.
---
orly?
---
Because everyone still 'wants' to play eve.  It's a unique game, that still (despite all the shit CCP has done) holds a lot of promise with years more of possible content.  And everyone wants it to be fun again.
---
Stfu 🙄
---
No, no you don’t get it. There are LESS people in NS that means that EVE is dying!!!!
---
&gt;I'm a returning player. What has changed since [year]?
---
is probably the most common question in this thread and on this subreddit
---
Yeah, all these people thinking it's dumb to bring caps against stukas aren't realizing another thing that's going on here, which is that stuka fleets can be up to like 400-600 people showing up in your home region with zero warning whatsoever. 
---
Organizing a subcap response on that scale will take far longer than, say, a rorq's panic, so your other option is dropping like 1/4th the stuka fleet in caps. That doesn't go *amazingly* because the stuka fleet still outnumbers you 4:1, but it's a response you can assemble in time to contest the field rather than feed on it.
---
lmao if I wasn’t sure OP was right before I sure am now
---
Poor krabs :(
---
this just in, line members of major nullbloc say dumb things
---
They think they’re somehow important to the game or relevant, even after quitting. Spoiler alert: they’re not
---
CCP should know by now that when they nerf a certain playstyle, they have to improve it in another way. Nullseccers' life is now a lot harder/riskier, and even if that's not what r/Eve think, we know that it's good for the health of EVE.
---
But we've yet to see improvements to nullsec life, like to cynojammers/citadels/timezone tanking/etc, even if they would be good for the health of the game as well.
---
Because people see CCP doing nothing but nerfs to their playstyles, they quit. I hope the CSM summit is going to change the way CCP is doing things, because right now they're just trying to kill a fly with a hammer.
---
don´t make yourself easy targets by sitting in a single region of space. problem solved. or git gud at PvP and organising things. that´s what you do best, right? god bless.
---
The krabs are downvoting you
---
Well that's the exact problem.  CCP just doesn't work on this game like they should.  It's less about big core changes, and more about iterative balancing to get us to a playable game to me, but I think the point stands either way.
---
I think we agree on the problem, but I disagree with your solution of just tacking on a whole new set of features instead of fixing the ones we have.
---
Seddows?  The FC who ended up standing down his fleet every time skill urself formed?  He's some sort of TAPI hero now?  O tempora o mores.
---
Yeah, but that's psychologically healthy and shit.
---
I would dare to say that by adding a very simple mechanics, eve might have mass appeal:
---
Sanctioned combat - 1vs1 duels and team duels.
---
Everyone will say, its not eve, dumbing it down and providing easy pvp so no one will do Sov Holding, etc etc etc...but allow me to elaborate:
---
If eve is a pvp centric game, it is very strange that fights require a substantial investment of time in seeking the engagement than actual fighting. For a newbie that seeks the thrills of PvP, it surely puts EvE in bad light.
---
Also fighting experience is hard to acquire if the allocated time and effort to find targets and engange them effectively is high with little to no time to react once engaged.
---
An arena system of some kind that allows people to engage on-demand and do it over and over and over would resolve part of the learning curve. It would also provide easy to acquire PvP content, as long as there are other interested duelists/teams.
---
But in order to keep such Arena system aligned with the EvE philosphy, it needs to fullfill certain requirements:
---
* There needs to be simple rulesets that can be selected by the players (ie: limit to frigs or cruisers, or limit it to t2 and below equipment) so the fighters can engage in the level of content they wish to do.
---
* Losses are real - you get your ship destroyed and the enemy team can loot it.
---
* There needs to be a small isk sign-in fee for the Arena
---
* 3rd parties could bet on the outcome
---
* For the winners a non-isk prize could be awarded - for example LP for a specific NPC corp you signed to "represent" in the arena.
---
If such mechanics were added, i could imagine a great deal of new players could engage in PvP and eventually set their goals in grand epic Sov Fleet fights....but you need to crawl before you learn to walk.
---
Lmao walking in stations please no.  Just fix the issues and balance the game out and people will return. We don't need a gimmick
---
Fwiw those punks, or other punks, could turn out to be your best in-game friends some day. Don't treat non-consentual PvP as some sort of affront, treat it as part of the game. The goal of the game, tbh. 
---
Best thing you can do after you get blown up is to open a convo window with whoever blew you up and ask them how they found you. Ask for some advice. 9/10 times they'll be helpful as hell. They might even invite you to join their corp or toss a few iskies your way.  
---
Of course, the other 1/10 times they'll probably tell you to "get rekt n00b". That's always fun.  :)
---
Looks like the blackout gave you the exact edge you needed to defeat those pesky MTU's.
---
Damn I wish I got this excited about nothing to post retarded shit on Reddit
---
Remove local from null
---
The people who like eve have their own little communities they talk to, be it their alliance or corp or whatever. the people who post here don't have such communities because they're new or they don't play. 
---
The bittervets need you to know why they think the game is bad now and will never stop
---
Hey man skillu was good and deserved the respect they got. Scary to fight if not prepared.
---
Get out of your super mindset. You're using nukes to beat annoying bees. T3Ds are the simplest solution for stuka/Goku fleets, munnins can easily hold the field against them... Caracals can probably counter them and trade decently in a pinch. Not everything can be countered by dropping caps.
---
&gt; People are litterally retarded.
---
Literally*
---
Balancing features retains old players that already have a sunken cost fallacy so they dont leave the game as fast as new players. The new player retention time in eve is 15 minutes. 15 MINUTES from loging in to playing to never playing agian. That is a massive problem for the longevity of this game.
---
Adding new features keeps new players around long enough to fall in love with the game.
---
No, they moved to hisec because there was *physically more money to be made there doing what they enjoy then in nullsec*. Some of them completely changed professions. I've seem multiboxer miners/ratters turn into abyssal runners because there is less risk and relatively the same money to be made in hisec abyssals. I've seen the same people liquidate tens of billions of isk in null like rorquals and take it to hisec because they could be making more money market trading with all their liquid isk then keep mining in nullsec, when the ever-increasing risk factors are included. It's not a matter of laziness, it is just people adapting and making hard choices and changes to keep their income levels up. There is a strong case that it's the exact opposite.
---
People get order and probably half of us still play due to sunk cost fallacy.
---
I love EVE but I have over 15k hours "played" (Steam counts you playing if you have launcher open, even if you forget to close it) and I badly want to just win EVE. At least for a bit, few months?
---
Agreed
---
show up with a counter and they cloak, thats the problem.
---
Read above posts
---
Hi, havent played for a while - are suspect status for L4 and L5 abyss again active, or still disabled?
---
We're now waiting for Treenewbie to welp his third Vanquisher.
---
welcome to literally all of r/eve
---
It's a fucking gift, I'll tell ya
---
any semi competent group will wreck you if you show up “unprepared”
---
Very much rose tinted glasses. Back and forth smacktalk has been a thing since the first players loaded up haulers on their alts full of supplies and 'moved' into nullsec to carve out a little bit of territory for themselves in 2003.
---
Always had to prep more for skillu. Cause it would be boosh eagles or something.
---
It's not about quantity, it's about quality, there's already to many PVP averse players in this PVP centric game, we need people of the right mentality, not a mass of normies.
---
I bet if you made posts that weren't garbage you wouldn't have to deal with the "downvote brigade"
---
Your scenario plays out in a touchy feely world where emotions govern thoughts and reactions. Some of us ( lets call us adults ) are far more controlled to let emotional social constructs like "safe" play a role in decision making.
---
Profit and Loss  
---
Risk and Reward  
---
Stability and Instability
---
So lets talk rationally a second. Lets start with a baseline, 138 deaths per recent year per 100K citizens makes Tijuana Mexico one of many high risk places in the world to reside. That is 2620 homicides in a 2M population (12 deaths a month per 100k). Compare it first to a low risk system in eve like Cistuvaert with 5 kills in the last 24 hours. Eve would be a far more dangerous place to live than the worst in the real world. Now lets compare that to Brave's staging system where 329 ships have died in the last 24 hours. Null and "Safe" are incompatible. If someone feels entitled to safe then the problem is the entitled person. If someone says it's hard to get kills, they are the problem. These are cold hard truths that have not changed with or without Blackout.
---
So the ratter asks himself a simple question. Is it worth it? They look at losses vs gains and see if they are positive its not worth the time. They move on to something else. Childish mocking will have no effect on a calculated decision. Same scenario with the miner. If the decision is done emotionally and they are unhappy? Too bad.
---
The aggressor? Obviously the decision was that is WAS worth the time or they would have been gone. If their decision was emotional and not rational and they are unhappy? Too bad.
---
If someone assumes all decisions are made emotionally? They are childish and can't conceive of rational thought.
---
As someone who watched an exceptionally fun small-time game *actually* get run into the ground, trust me. It could be orders of magnitude worse than whatever you think Eve has become.
---
The degree to which you people glorify stupidity is horrifying.
---
Are you really so insecure that a casual mention of the fact that someone is more intelligent than you, in a conversation where that person's intelligence was called into question, necessitates mockery in response? 
---
Intelligence isn't some mystical quality that only a few people posses and which remains forever out of reach of the masses; it's essentially a measurement of the degree to which you use the higher functions of your brain, analogous to the relationship between physical strength and workout. Reacting with hostility to someone simply for possessing more intelligence than you is similar to a fat person raging at a fit person simply because the latter's existence makes the former feel bad about him- or herself.
---
If you feel threatened by the knowledge that other people may be more intelligent than you, you have a very simple solution: exercise your own mind, expand your own intelligence, and leave less room for others to 'outsmart' you.  
---
Alternately, you could recognize the fact that intelligence is simply a quality analogous to physical strength: while it can be very important in situations where it is relevant, it by no means defines a person's worth, and the fact that someone might have more of it than you shouldn't threaten you. If I had made a reference to having above-average physical strength, would you have reacted similarly?
---
I guess it's easier to just find a group of your intellectual peers, circle the wagons, and shoot at anyone who might threaten your self-confidence.
---
We need people that play the damn game. People that mine the resources that build ships. People that haul the ships people that contribute to the game in other ways. This game doesnt work if everyone is just pvping and nothing else
---
wait what happened i missed it
---
All hail gentlemen of statistics!
---
cause its impossible to leave eve.
---
oh sure, you think you left it...but did you really?  it still has its hold on you, and theres no way to break it.
---
Wow, people must suck at EVE if they required local. Scrubs getting scrubbed out.
---
It must be your first day on the interweb.
---
In other news, reading this i laughed so hard i peed a little. now i have to change my pants. Thanks a fucking lot seddow.
---
Do you mean that in 3 month PGL will lead the campaign again ?
---
Was this part of the short story contest? It's a great read, thanks for sharing!
---
PAX West is also this weekend
---
That 15 minute player retention problem has a lot more to do with a garbage NPE, and less to do with new features to the game.
---
You make this suggestion as if a) they hadn't tried this before and failed and b) it would be cheap and straight forward to accomplish.
---
This could just as easily be read as “what effect is the last month of summer and the start of university classes having on people logging in to play Eve Online.” It’s the biggest, busiest time of the year for players to be away etc. It’s literally labor day weekend rn.
---
Be careful with correlational data. Correlation =/= causation.
---
&gt;I thought i hated TEST before. Now so even more. The tactics they employ now are just low. 15 of them swoop onto one of our corms. 20 of them warp in to destroy a cheap Ibis cyno ship.
---
Lmao sieku, saber and crew doing god work.
---
If they are in your space disrupting this Empire building nonsense we have to do, it best to use the Nuclear option.   
---
T3D's near constantly get bombed to death quite often and caracals are a laughable bad option I'm surprised it was mentioned. If you absolutely have to pick a subcap doctrine to counter them with then use Harpies. Slay booshers and ewar then eat the bombers if they don't leave.
---
EVE is like a fire triangle. Lose one gameplay style, or even one becomes too strong and before you know it the whole construct comes crashing down, usually in the form of an economy. Everything that happens in eve truly does have impacts, whether social or economic. I don't claim to be an "3L17E pee vee peer", but as someone that goes out occassionally to see if there is someone to kill, i would be *rejoicing* for more krabs. I want more targets to go after. Shunning krabs from the elite pvp crowd, or somehow making a pipedream of a universe of smallgang pirate wormholer (insert pvp buzzword here) a reality would not be fun as it would be harder to get kills. Just like in nature, there is the predator and prey. I wouldn't want to live in an eve where there is little to no prey, or I (and many others) would starve.

I'd imagine they'll be finished with citadel implementation in 2020. Altough, feels like a long time since anything majorly new was introduced, we've had Abyssal Deadspace. New shipline which is very well fleshed out. Abyssal Invasion, new citadel stuff nearly every year. GM Weeks in two years now. Combatting botting has been upgraded a lot, blackout etc.
---
Not quite sure what CCP could do still. Besides ship balancing, fleshing out ship lines, maybe moving some story along more than once a year.
---
Sniper jackdaws can hit out to 110 for 1400 volley and go 1600ms, like 20 daws would be enough to volley stuka fleets.
---
Idk why people are so slow to adapt.
---
Similar situation,  although leaving 3 accounts active for now
---
Yeah I don’t care about this doctrine. Seems annoying to fight, but still fightable. As compared to a fleet of roaming cloaky bombers which the counter to is docking
---
So it turns out when you dramatically reduce the rewards for being in space (excavator nerfs, fighter nerfs, anom respawn nerfs) and then dramatically increase the risk of being in space (bomber/Kiki meta, inhib buffs, blackout, cyno changes) there will be less people in space doing things. Who knew? It's like people aren't that stupid after all.
---
If null is going to be super risky to be in, then there needs to be a reason to be there in the first place.
---
I know someone who has his right leg absolutely jacked around the shin area
---
Goon being jealous at CCP for destroying the game, next!
---
So, the three rorquals, a nyx, and 2 naglfars we just dunked were paid by TEST to feed themselves to us? That's pretty cool. Keep em coming. Tastes like chicken.
---
This, this is what your TV licence fee gets you.
---
I know PvPers have a hard time believing this, but someone has to build your shit and someone has to buy the plex you are purchasing to pay for your combat ships.
---
Many PvPers also do a lot of PvE, and moreso back in the day too, when people tend to say the game was 'better'.
---
Discounting the krabs is not constructive. They are not the problem and never have been. The roots are more insidious - long-term disdain of krabs combined with those krabs shifting to PvE capitals (this one is CCP's fault) and consolidating into blocs have led to many of today's problems. Blocs can advertise that they're safer since smaller groups are either overfarmed or outright crushed out of existence, and blocs are responsible for most of today's problems like citadel abuse and supercap umbrellas.
---
Maybe stop treating krabs like subhumans and they'll log in more. Maybe stop forcing krabs to consolidate and they won't be able to team up with a hundred other krabs to camp gates in boson titans.
---
CCP isn't solely responsible for this. Capitals should never have been able to do PvE like they can, but the playerbase is responsible for plenty of the rest of today's problems.
---
While goons were doing their tribute run, we ran around Delve with Gokus. They brought harpies. They did not enjoy the outcomes.
---
I dunno, I logged back in after ~2yrs of being away.  I kinda like the no Local.  I prefer ratting in a PVP fit, small gang stuff.  I can't see local but niether can any possible targets.  Its less stressful and more fun in my opinion without the local.  Just let shit happen if its going to.
---
It's deffinalty, quotes in my neck of the woods, but I'm getting in some great ratting.
---
&gt; We need people that play the damn game.
---
we got that with CCP pushing for dumb carebear centric changes in the past 5 years. constant decline. eve just isn´t a good game when it comes to mechanics, balancing and gameflow. its only redeeming quality was the cutthroat fuck you approach.
---
This is the issue with null alliances, they’ve become so big they think they are the game. I’d put 50 snuffed out from lowsec against any 50 goons or 50 TESTbro’s and snuffed out would give you a back hand and have you crawling back to your momma to suckle on her teets.
---
The game is bigger than nullsec mate, to quote a meme you guys like to use, “Adapt or die”
---
Seems its you who are dieing because you arent adapting.
---
There are times when you want to do something else and its normal. I know some just need to face their addiction and regain control of their time. 
---
Eve is the only game i play and its appeal is much greater now that i regulate my playing time and play for what i really want.
---
Getting rid of Serenity was a mistake.
---
~~lmao yes pretty please keep using harpies.~~
---
*ofc i meant omg no please no harpies, they're super scary and dangerous
---
Who builds your ships? Why do you think krabs grind isk? Krabs grind isk for warships. So in your parlance "fuck you your wrong"
---
The war last year began in early July and ended in mid-September.
---
Apparently you are not very good at picking up sarcasm. Also put Snuffed against DKS and we can give them some nice spanking ;)
---
I've stopped playing but I'm coming back soon
---
&gt;Result is that those krabbers you DO find will only be the prepared ones.
---
Good.
---
i build them myself. what do you think indy alts are for?
---
Hey everyone look at this idiot that didn't read the post and is blissfully unaware at how stupid his comment is to everyone who DID read the post.
---
just because people aren't capable of using the tools available to them doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
If you are talking about the 1 'war' on the graph that isn't a peak and using it as the foundation of your argument, I don't really know what to say other than call you bad.
---
&gt; 2019-09-02 12:59:46 Charles Dunois its "oh one of the alliances that has likely stronger botting ties cause boo hoo they eat noodles and are better at maths" 
---
For the record, I know my times tables from 1 to 12.
---
Good writeup
---
I seen the TAPI next to your name and assumed you were another chunk of salt to mine. Sorry pal.
---
He's mad that unless it's their strongest timezone, they can't use gates in their main staging.
---
Because they can't find a better game.
---
So your a carebear? Why isnt that alt out pvping? Where are you getting the resources and blue prints for the ships? I'm sure you just reprocess loot from dead player ships and only use blueprints from the cargo of those ships?
---
In this case it was test
---
I love PVP and I really like the blackout as it gives me an old Silent Hunter series feel, except with spaceships. There is however no reason for me to still *live* in null. I can do the little explo or PVE I do from time to time in, and from, a lot of other places. 
---
Places that do not give me the feeling I am just another sitting duck for some Thera dudes with 60 alts that cover my entire region.
---
&gt;litterally retarded
---
Ironic. He could save others from their fate, but not himself.
---
&gt; Why isnt that alt out pvping?
---
because that´s what mains are for. 
---
&gt; Where are you getting the resources and blue prints for the ships?
---
from that dude whose alts mine or research
---
#stop saying mean things!
---
But yeah, sooner or later, people are going to have to accept that it's not "all just bots leaving".
---
You sound just like Marsha and Olmecha. Papa government needs to take care of me. Where are my welfare kills?
---
OK seriously, the game had dominant groups before and will have others. These groups have made civilizations in null. Want to beat them? Build a better civilization.
---
I know, that takes real effort and organization. So much easier to ask Papa Hilmar to try. Lets do it the dumbest way possible because it's easier for you.
---
This time, the problem has nothing to do with players' ability or willingness to adapt - CCP is taking away the tools that ALLOWED adaptation.
---
With no local and no cynos, there is no (?) feasible way to reliably avoid dying when someone wants to kill you and is willing to put in a fraction of the effort that goes into avoiding their gank (most people would not consider having multiple force recon alts spread out on grid \~100km apart feasible). No matter how vigilant you are, no matter how smart you are about it, being in space uncloaked and untethered means you could be tackled and killed at any moment, with no warning and no chance of defending yourself (unless the attackers made a serious miscalculation).
---
If you don't think about it very hard and just quote the "hurr, EVE is supposed to be dangerous" catchphrase, that might sound GREAT to you. However, after a bit of critical thinking, or a lot more time and shrinkage of the playerbase, it becomes obvious that there's a big difference between danger that is unavoidable and danger that tests your skills, vigilance, and/or intelligence.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcHR3HizRTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcHR3HizRTA)
---
Then you should only be using blueprints and resources that you get from directly pvping to build your ships, otherwise you are just a hypocrite
---
You mean that one war everybody had wanted to see? Goons vs NCPL? WWB2? The one that fizzled and showed that if any wars involved one side showing up with 1200 titans, the other side would merely pack up their toys and go somewhere else?  That one war?
---
Do you have data to back that up?
---
lol pointing out the guy complaining of bias is equally biased makes me mad?
---
Pretty even outcome. Not bad not bad.
---
how so?
---
You know what's not cheap? Bankruptcy
---
They're just attention seekers. Just like the people who obsessively post about how "EVE is dying" in every thread.
---
&gt;Yesterday's peak-of-peak player count was 26,620 which was down 2,322 players from last Sunday, but don't worry everyone, its just more bots leaving right? Right guys?
---
Classes also started in USTZ (50% of playerbase) and WoW Classic dropped.
---
/tinfoilthread
---
Not sure how I'm trolling, Hilmar flat out stated he wants the game to be so hard and stressful people feel they need medication to cope with it. If there's a narrative being discussed its the one pushed by hilmar.
---
Says the guy with dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon dozens of alts so he can cover ~~Esoteria~~ an entire region.
---
Supers also do less applied DPS to a munin than an AF does to a munin.
---
I'm sure you have the capacity for basic reading retention. I have already explained it.
---
Man, its not like WOW classic coming back for its first weekend or anything might explain that over 10k gap in numbers....
---
You are entitled to your opinion even if it is just "waaahhhh waaaaah waaaah"  
---
   Hope you have a better day tomorrow.
---
&gt; I guess this is somewhat good for solo players but it still takes 20-30 jumps even using WH's to find something to shoot.
---
how is this different than pre-blackout?
---
As showed by CCP, 90% of new players quit within a month. 
---
The first reason is pretty obvious, the game is very complex and the NPE/tutorials are utter trash. Basically read guides on the internet (gl if you dont speak english) or quit. But I believe CCP is currently working on it, so let's hope for the ~~best~~ least worst.
---
Assuming a new player managed to get into a not so boring activity (like abyssals), his next issue will be the lack of goal: make isk in abyssals, but to what end ? There is no clear goal because it's a sandbox. 
---
So to help new players stick to the game: add detailed **in-game** tutorials about basic things, and give them clearer goals to work towards.
---
It's pretty darn good at checking and messing with your skills. That's all I've really used it for. 
---
I was hoping for a fitting tool a la an improved Eve Droid, but no dice.
---
Yep. Virtual non entities that did nothing of note or consequence.
---
When they released skill injectors, I knew I'd never come back to the game.
---
you said someone comitting to a PvP heavy playstyle while buying stuff from some other PvPers alt makes them both carebears. i dunno   that sounds like a pretty dumb thing to say tbh.
---
Shhhhhhhh you're upsetting the narrative.
---
If you’re only in null to farm it’s probably a good thing that you quit TBH.
---
I suppose the target is supposed to just roll over and die because you formed a fleet and found him ya?
---
A bunch of dead weight isn't healthy. Sometimes you have to prune the tree.
---
Only thing I know is that TAPI is losing the war.
---
Most of decade really.
---
Dreads bad, Frigates good.  Eve 2019
---
Exactly. Lots of old blood returning as the tumors that were EVE rotting are being bled dry.
---
It’s always darkest before the dawn.
---
Dude, like wtf. Are you trying to break a record in saying stupid shit or what?
---
People have been ratting off comms and out of fleets for a fifteen years. What the hell makes you think that THIS is when they'll stop ratting unprepared?
---
This, combined with the lock-retaining ability, it is the pinnacle of maneuverability, and defeats the entire balance of AB, MWD, Scram, Web, and makes the only relevant module a Scram.
---
Pretty sure if you log into your character, then you count as a ‘logon’ on that API.  It does not matter how long you are actually on.  
---
If you stay on the log in screen, but select no one, then you do not register as a ‘log on’.
---
You're right. Those null bears that cant adapt or refuse to adapt to making safe space less safe are really just bots leaving.
---
More news at 10.
---
What a shocker, you cant give me an answer instead you start to rant about other things.
---
It doesn't because that pvp alt is carebearing and not out pvping
---
They're part of the imperium, aren't they?
---
Symptom of Risk Averse Hunters.
---
What sub-cap doctrine should be able to hold a grid against massed supers?
---
If you are going to say in 2019 everyone should hold grids with fucking frigates, you need to re-examine your ideas there bud.
---
Not true.  
---
I live in LS, but my HS friends can no longer mine AFK in hulks cause those diamond rats zap em...
---
Ye totally. I mean stuka fleets still kills a shitton more than they lose and NS isnt really crying about it in that sense. But trying to get an even bigger advantage is so childish.
---
TLDR plz?
---
That's not a wall of text its a wall of cancer.
---
are T3Ds too dummy thicc to be chainbooshed as well or am I missing something?
---
Specifically designed fleet may need specifically designed response, but what do I know I dont have that much spod in my brain
---
Imagine living in a world where you link the number of ships being destroyed each month with the quality of the "game state."
---
No U
---
Some will content that in the past null sec received buff, upon buff, upon unbalanced buff.
---
It pulls back a little and all the null bears that were never hard enough to play in null in the first place quit?
---
Come on dude...
---
PCU means *concurrent* users
---
Why would i dedicate my whole attention to an activity that can be partially or completely done while afk?
---
&gt;Still seems were pretty close to 2015,16
---
Which is pretty bad, considering that was pre-alphas
---
Ballsy move by snuff, grats
---
what corp? this should be visible in dotlan.
---
Pretty much.
---
Evanova seems better.
---
Living in NPC null might be a good idea, I just need to get a medical clone there.
---
Because the only metric that should be used to determine how healthy the game is, is the number of ships destroyed each month.
---
/s
---
**Correlation does not imply causation.**
---
I'll look at N-6 :) thanks
---
grrrr Goons
---
^^ This.
---
Null sec was far too easy for far too long.  Now all the null bears that did not belong there in the first place get shaken out.
---
Honestly, I think capitals can work for taking out Stuka fleets.  That is well coordinated HAW Dreads and/or Supercarriers.  You just have to take the correct capitals and don't expect to be ISK efficient at the end of it.  Titans are all menacing looking and such, but what do they really do to Stuka fleets?  Carriers are squishy and just melt.  And, as long as opponents are jumping in squishy targets, the Stuka fleets will find a way to work around whatever else is on grid and pick off said squishier targets one at a time.  [Like this guy.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78745497/)  What was he doing?  Boosh in, blap, boosh out.
---
But I believe well coordinated HAW Dreads could quickly fuck up a Stuka fleet, while Supercarriers, with their fighters applying good damage en mass and high EHP making them tough targets to crack, could easily counter a Stuka fleet in sufficient numbers.
---
Using a few examples from two of the fights yesterday...
---
**Fight 1** - https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/B3ajZBEW2PFqeqJLY
---
*Note that I've split the Goon fleet off into a third team, simply because they came in with a classic bomber gang, rather than a Stuka gang*
---
A Rorqual (or two?) was tackled in a belt.  It PANIC'd almost immediately.  And then came the mass of capitals; HAW dreads, carriers, and a few FAX.  Two died pretty quickly, but then things slowed down and we had to leave grid after killing only four.  Their dreads were able to volley off most of our CDs and a few of our bombers and it just was not sustainable to stay on grid.
---
Had Goons not been around to take the brunt of the losses, we'd have probably lost a lot more.  And, had the dreads actually coordinated their fire better, they probably could have reduced our numbers to the point where we couldn't take out the Nyx and two Nids on the Keepstar grid later.  I was being targeted by one Revelation, who was able to drop my Kiki down to 25% shield on the first shot, 96% hull on the second, before the Kirin reps started.  If two dreads had shot me, I'd probably have died there and then.
---
With 21 HAW dreads on the field, split into seven teams of 3, each team focusing on independent targets, they would probably have been able to split our reps such that they would be able to consistently volley 5+ ships off the field every 4 seconds.  That would have been the end of our fleet.  Again, thank god for Goons being there to take the brunt of the losses.
---
As it turned out, Pando got us out before we were truly fucked.  And then caught a Nyx and two Nids in a bubble off a Keepstar, which we were able to melt.  [That was my first super kill, by the way!](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78740609/)  And I was the top damaging Kiki in fleet, beating the next best Kiki by 6.5k!!!  I'd like to think that makes up in some part for the [Rorqual](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78738764/) I had lost earlier that day.
---
**Fight 2** - Like in this fight: https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/xQYc5ZHKG3PiA6RBB
---
*We were fine until the Muninns came in.*
---
They forced us off with a mass of supers, not because they were killing us, but because there's not much we could do against them.  We were able to take out three(?) of their FAXes, but only two while on grid with the super fleet (one it crashed and we killed it after it ewarped), but there wasn't much we could do on grid after that.  The capitals on grid started to align out to a station while we were off grid at a safe.  As they warped, we were able to bubble a Mino, pair of Apostles, and Nyx.  Or maybe they stayed behind intentionally to keep us around for what came next ...
---
We killed the three FAXes, and then the Nyx just sat there, eating damage, as all their FAX and supers sat tethered, and then jumped out.  When it reached about 10% armour, FAXes started to trickle in through the cyno the Nyx had lit, until we couldn't break their reps.  And then they jumped in the Muninns.
---
They jumped in on the Nyx, which we were maybe 20km off, so a boosh out and then a boosh back in was enough to line up a few bomb runs and take quite a few of them out.  But, while that was happening they were able to volley all of our Kikis, and then all but one of our Kirins.  We ended up getting the fuck out after that.
---
After the fight was over, I think Pando was hoping to keep the fleet going after dead had reshipped.  I mentioned to him that all our Kikis were dead, to which he said 'when did that happen' :')
---
I'm 90% sure the Nyx was just bait to keep us on grid long enough for them to come in with the Muninns.  And, if they'd come in at range, and focused the CDs instead of the Kikis and Kirins, they'd have probably done less damage as we'd have noped out sooner, but they'd have also lost a lot less.
---
----
---
I'm not saying subcaps aren't the answer, but capitals can work too, though it'd be a lot harder to maintain ISK efficiency with HAW Dreads than a subcap fleet.  And you still have the issue of target selection.  Kill too many logi, and they'll warp out.  Kill too many CDs, and they'll warp out.  Focus the Kikis and, as Fight 2 shows, nobody will notice and you'll bump up your efficiency, but Kikis (and Retris) are for defang, not killing caps, so you'll still lose caps.  And focusing the bombers will be a pain due to application vs. frig hulls.
---
If you're saving a mining fleet or a super, I guess it'd make sense to drop in capitals.  Otherwise, let them die because you'll bleed more than mean you save.  Unless you're in it for the gfs.
---
Just my 2¢.
---
because it is the big funny.
---
Good stuff ! There is PvP content in Horde space ?
---
If you think this Is beautiful (it is) you should try Elite Dangerous
---
That could be a reworked version of FW and that'd be very cool. I am against instanced PvP but I guess it would be ok in FW sites, since you'd still be in 'real space' and need to find sites.
---
To lead new/casual players into this, CCP could add HS FW zones, with obviously no PvP and just PvE, with ok rewards but way lower than what you would get in lowsec. 
---
With some guidance after the tutorials, everyone would try it in their first hours of the game (like mining right now) and could get the hang of it, meet veteran players in militia corps at the same time and learn FW without having to directly dive in lowsec and get raped.
---
And where exactly did I say that? I did quite the opposite btw. If you have a little bit of your brain left in your skull you might have noticed that my comment more or less says "why bring a subcap fleet if the supercaps work" instead of "give me kills for free".
---
He literally streams tutorials but hey v0v
---
can you not use dotlan historic data for each day?
---
Can you please show me these buffs. Cause the past years have been more or less nerfs. These past 6 months have been straight nerfs atleast.
---
So your entire shtick about "pulls back a little" is just BS.
---
Not to mention this entire "ugh hardcore ye boi" attitude. Get real dude.
---
Dreddit, we are always recruiting mate.
---
Uhhh
---
Yes it does?
---
Unless by "not that often" you mean "literally every time Pando takes malcy along on a Stuka fleet to TEST/Horde/Frat space"?
---
i gave you an answer. if you don´t want to deal with 600 meanies and 4 independent groups pissing all over the only sandcastle left in the game venture out and build your own. or don´t and git better. there is this one catchphrase which escapes me atm.
---
how does one *F* in [murloc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMPpnCvCZvw)
---
Because you are not out pvping with that alt. You are the most risk adverse person in eve by just staying docked and care bearing
---
I suppose CCP is supposed to just roll over and nerf any doctrine that can last 2 minutes on the same grid as a bunch of supercaps?
---
There’s no sick really complaining about being blobbed? Coming from a wormholrr, that’s rich as fuck.
---
Oh no we can’t instantly respond to a 300 man bomber fleet, we might be taking some losses here due to the enemy is being prepared and catching us off guard. Why won’t CCP think of us!
---
This one is pretty rich.
---
EVE doesn't need mass appeal.
---
The real tricks were Deep Space Probes or Project Poseidon.
---
I have a few friends who say they love to read about eve, but can't stand to play it. So yea, a lot of interest for the game and what people are up to while playing, but not really interested in picking it up :I
---
Long live the whalers
---
Oh look it's today's goonpost about how blackout is bad and they want their free VNI isk back.
---
Fewer concurrent logins is not bad for the game if those logins were bots or multiboxers who would dock those characters up when anyone got within 4 jumps of playing with them.
---
So you mean to tell me that youre fleets get wiped all the time because of the above? Or that they in any real way counter your fleets?
---
Cause I have dropped against those fleets and have flown the same types myself and I know it doesnt happen. Present to me the last time a stuka fleet got wiped.
---
Yeah from my own experience when I returned to the game to checkout the changes, I quickly realised how long it took to actually suit up again, get a ship/fit that works with alpha skills, research where is potentially active again, fly out there and try and find people etc. Before ya know it an hour has passed and I haven't actually "done" anything. (died without killing anything btw in the end, mostly intentionally suicided out of bordoem)
---
Tried lowsec for a bit after that but honestly it wasn't too much different, easier to find people but they were all blinged out in those new triglavian ships or whatever. Anyways got quickly bored and havn't logged in since really.
---
Very true.  CCP has been working hard to sort out how much ‘free’ SPs they need to feed people to log in.  Not something they are able to keep up forever.  
---
I am actually interested to see what things start looking like after the cyno changes.  
---
Right now it’s pretty easy to eyeball the slope of the line of maximum logins and how that is different from the couple years before.  It’s pretty obvious.  The response really should not surprise people at all. 
---
I think the telling trend now will be how things change over the next 2-3 months after the cyno changed.   My guess is we will again get a small recovery as people get excited, and then an accelerated decline as PvE people respond.  Two big hits, in a very short time, at almost exactly the same players and region.  That’s just my guess, but nothing in the current data set makes me think it will be different.  
---
Time will tell I expect.
---
Who says im not PvPing while PvEing? Who the fuck runs in space PvE content in ships that aren´t able to PvP? You know this is a PvP game right?
---
No but really, what did you mean
---
The war where one side didn't show.
---
There's ways to make deep safes without exploits, just need speedfit ship and leaving PC on for several nights
---
And that from a guy that basically says "yeah all those things theoretically exist but in reality our dudes are too dumb to use them"
---
Youre just talking shit dude. You still havent given me an answer to how to counter 600 people outside of a rant. No real application, just some "meta" stuff about how you are better than me. Your response is a typical moronic response, nothing more. Youre not being clever here, you are just proving that you have no real input outside of shittalking.
---
It doesnt need to be "instanced", but it needs to be ubiquitous, if its a rework or extension of FW then it might be spatially localized to some places only. It won't work that way. So make it a sort of deadspace area for any system, or just a simple mechanic that flags players to each other in some way.
---
For Arenas to match eve lore, you should just be a "champion" for a certain NPC corp, the most likely to fit this model would be entertainment corps that will "podcast" the match, and fight on their behalf....no standing gain or loss, just LP payout.
---
Weaponized autism is a *very* powerful force
---
How long have you been playing?
---
I quit over a year ago, null was empty as fuck then too, and finding no one within 20 jumps was pretty common.
---
What corp? Lets see if your corp member history matches your post shall we?
---
Wow, you’re one salty sailor
---
Off the top of my head the biggest buffs for nullbears have been the changes made to carriers and rorqs a couple years ago and the reduction in frequency of wormholes to nullsec. The rorq buff in particular was a massive buff
---
Because they have not ‘quit EVE’.
---
Nobody ‘quits EVE’.
---
Once you’re bitten the poison lingers, there’s no getting away from it.
---
There is no other place like it. You *hate* loving EVE. Even though she’s a cold, callous bitch that will kill you just to watch you die, you can’t get away from her. She’s under your skin. It’s an abusive relationship in which you crave more, in which you want more, in which you’ll cry more, and hurt more, and beg more. Only to be denied.
---
EVE nerds, not your run-of-the-mill nerd, no sir.
---
Pre-blackout there were more targets in space - sure there was still some empty space but right now it's just dead.   I think the hunted had a chance to get away in the past, but now it's very difficult and most players don't want to be farmed if they're undocking and krabbing.
---
Because your alt is docking building stuff and not pvping
---
In wormhole space, there is no Local chat to tell you whether someone else is in the system. If you plan on daytripping in there (which is lovely, if you can do the sites, because one site can easily cover several entry-level explorer ship losses) you'll need to use the Directional Scan a lot. Here's a very cautious way to explore in J-Space:
---
If you don't have buddies scouting the holes for you or something, typically you'll warp around the system to watch for any other ships or probes showing up on D-Scan, see if you can find any citadels or something around the planets that aren't near you. If there are any citadels, check to see if anyone is home (it will show a number in the same line as the citadel name when you click on it in space). If nobody's home, go for the site.
---
Once at the site, approach a can and align to an off-grid safe spot, like a point in space you bookmarked somewhere else. Slow your speed way down so your ship is still pre-aimed to warp out, but not leaving hacking range of the can, and start the hacking minigame (let me know if you need a guide on that part). KEEP MASHING YOUR D-SCAN BUTTON. If you see probes or other ships pop up on D-Scan, consider getting to your safe. If you see a ship, but no probes, and you're willing to risk your safety on the assumption haven't *already* scanned down the system, maybe you can stay on the site a while longer. If anything pops up in the overview on grid with you, bug out of there!
---
The safest way to play is always to get out when you spot someone else on D-Scan. Sometimes hunters will be cloaked, and will already have scanned the system before you, so they'll be able to wait. But if you're quick on the warp, you will still evade them, since they have a short delay after decloaking before they can even begin locking onto you. The only ships that don't have such a delay are stealth bombers, and these usually won't be going after you unless they are purpose-built to kill defenseless explorers -- that's not what they're typically used for.
---
Another handy tip. Cloaky ships will still appear on D-Scan for a moment if they just jumped through a wormhole into your system within range of your scan. When they begin to move, they will lose the automatic cloak momentarily before activating their own. So if you see something like a Tengu, Loki, Stratios, Astero, Pilgrim appear for just a moment and then disappear, it means they cloaked up. If you see probes out but no ship on scan (if you can d-scan the whole system), it's something cloaky.
---
I like to hunt explorers. If you're on the ball and attentive, unless I have a stealth bomber I have virtually no chance of catching you. Every kill is ultimately a result of someone not noticing me until it was too late. 
---
Keep at it. If you can pull a single relic site's worth of value, that can be anywhere from 1-4 explorer fits covered right there.
---
Playing eve
---
Thats what I said? Your interpretation is that? In theory we could all die in a nuclear fire in an hour but in reality we probably wont is the same as saying "people are too dumb to nuke eachother"? Its not that things can always happen in theory but in reality tons of other prereqs have to be filled which most likely never does.
---
Yes in theory people can use all these things. In reality stuka fleets boosh around outside of range of most things and can always dictate disengagement which means shit doesnt really work. Do I have to spell shit out or what?
---
And we already have fking data on it. Shit doesnt happen in reality, why are you arguing against something that easily can be proven?
---
It got us 60k on the server at one time in 2010 to 2013
---
Whenever a Goon posts stuff like, it reminds me of this [Wired article about them from 2008](https://www.wired.com/2008/01/mf-goons/).
---
*"The way that you win in EVE is you basically make life so miserable for someone else that they actually quit the game and don't come back."*
---
You cannot convince me that these constant concern-trolling "data" posts are not an ill-conceived psy-ops attempt that they think is clever, but is in fact them shitting all over a game they can't decide if they love or hate.
---
Which was 3 years ago. Do you want me to present the nerfs this 6 months alone?
---
&gt;unless you do something stupid
---
Like mining in highsec? Or going/appearing AFK on a gate there? "Literally never" is a bit strong seeing as how this is still very much a thing.
---
Ah, yea.  This is the standard 'Production vs Destruction thing eve has had a problem with for a long time.  
---
It predates the current issues by a decade, but it was in other forms back then.  If you heard the term 'mining with guns', this was from back then.  
---
I have proposed that almost all items have their production materials increased as a way of countering both this problem and the excess 'faucet:sink' issues (increasing production materials also increases costs of all parts of the chain, from Tax to Liquid Ozone and Ice use).
---
You sure you've played? The slapfights IS the game. EVE Online the executable file is a boring piece of shit.
---
Thats because he is in TAPI,   DKS is one of our high end SIGs, and they would do just fine against your uber lowsec leetness
---
Delve is outperforming the rest of null by the factor of 3 every month for 2 years now. Take your own math. There is no way to catch up. In hindsight letting Goons retreat to Delve was a huge mistake on all the large entities and basically their leaderships back in the days can be blamed for that.
---
The only way to beat Goons now is to let them ride, retreat to WH, have some small campaign into pockets and keep on repeating until you are bored.
---
He didn't miss it. This is Mar5hy SCREAMING for CCP not to nerf his playstyle. He knows the nerfbat is coming and protests too much - already.
---
Apparently we have only 2 fcs
---
&gt; So you mean to tell me that youre fleets get wiped all the time because of the above?
---
Did I say that?
---
I keep forwarding emails to the original sender accidentally
---
That's why he's here protesting his ass off.
---
600 people, four groups. get 30 of your own dudes in fucking 10 mil corms with boosher support (you can find 3 people out of 30 who can fly command dessies, right? it´s one of those ships that isn´t able to PvE well so maybe not). give each of those groups a competent small/mid scale FC (you have plenty of competent small/mid scale FCs right? i mean you are recruiting newbros all the time, it´s not like these guys are just exploited for tax monies and buyback programs, right? you actually teach them how to play the game, right?) throw in some fucking vigils or some shit for application or some other kitchen sink ewar garbage. boom you´re done. 120 people fighting off 600 bomber meanies in subcaps. jesus fucking christ, how hard can it be?
---
Yeah, its an old problem that was made quite a bit worse with the changes to Rorquals and the addition of Skill injectors.
---
If your salty logic was true, ccp would nerf supers because they stay vs supers, but your reddit shit posting skills are way to low.
---
I mean if you are at the point where you have to claim that all your big losses are spies in disguise you are in a rather sticky spot, ay? Would explain tho why you kick pilots after they lose big stuff. (Vanq pilot was supposed to be "asked to leave" but hes still there with supposedly a 3 vanq and a hel who chased some frigs and got dreadbombed in there staging who got kicked/left corp right after dying)
---
I believe this will just leave small groups with eve fewer options. Small and mobile? Not really, you can still move in with huge numbers (e. g. ph moved their entire market basically overnight to their new hq in r1o) . The end result will just be every big alliance trying to take at least a few systems with r64s I  every region in order to keep their constant need for materials satisfied and the moment someone shows up to dispute, they drop a big fleet. This may even lead to some regions being deserted for several months after a  major alliance mining op. 
---
Imo holding more sov than you need should be significantly harder(especially for big alliances) and uninhabited systems should be so easy to take over that big alliances won't even bother to try and take unimportant systems back. This will lead to many more small alliances moving in and null sec starting to actually not be a 'who's gonna break the meta harder' thing but rather 'which coalition can stick together better'.
---
Care to explain what one has to do with the other?
---
You act like if people brought a 200 man anti-support fleet you would stick around fight them.  
---
That is the bullshit I was pointing out.
---
Doubt that you actually found more people as perfect intel 3rd party tools helped anyone to get out of their anoms before you arrive except that one dumb guy that did not have that set up (yet). Sure you saw 10 guys in local, 3 were scouts, 6 were in citadels and one was warping around once you hit the gate.
---
In the second link, someone killed you in an Astero in high-sec. There are a couple things that could have happened -- either they ganked you very quickly and their own ship got blown up by police (sometimes people forget they're in high-sec), or you had done something possibly naughty previously that flagged you as a suspect and allowed anyone to freely shoot at you.
---
Okay, So yeah, It'd still be adding to that stat
---
To be fair the risk/reward balance for bridging bombers onto something is arguably not right either.
---
You're reading a lot more salt into this than there actually is.
---
You just had almost 4 years of only carebearing being the **only** play style. Still, plenty of money to be made krabbing after a step in the right direction.
---
Because they get to bitch about mechanics they dont use and then gloat when CCP listen them and not their active playerbase.
---
OMG, those poor mutiboxing ratters and miners can't make easy ISK in null and moved to HighSec you say? Oh the horror
---
Krabbers leaving null sec? working as intended.
---
Hi, small gang c2 pilot here. I was against the implementation of blackout when it first rolled around, and a lot of my predictions of decreasing activity are coming true. We will see what happens with the cyno nerfs next week, but overall the health of the nullsec ecosystem is degrading well past the point of no return (not that it wasn't before blackout either, but that's neither here nor there). 
---
There are less people in space, there are fewer people in standing fleets, nobody is running anomalies in entire regions, there are fewer people logging in at all, and there are very few interesting small scale fights. 
---
That said, I like the concept of blackout, but on the risk vs reward equation, the risk needs to be balanced. If CCP had removed both interceptor nullification and cloaky camping (by adding nonzero sig to cloaked ships that blooms over time spent cloaked) during the initial implementation, there would be counterplay and strategic viability for smaller groups to owning a pocket, camping the bottleneck, and running the sites. Pockets of activity have always been what makes the nullsec game go round, and all good fights are generated by players in space, which incentivizing gatecamps as the primary pocket defense mechanism facilitates. As it stands, the blops/cloaky camper and roaming uncatchable scout interceptor threats are too large to justify the reward from running anomalies without an umbrella. This was predictable, and we are paying for it.
---
How obvious does sarcasm need to be before theres no need for a /s?
---
Tbh if he's a newbie and isn't fitting a cloak because he hasn't skilled it yet, a good null/WH relic site will be more like 20 ships.
---
building stuff takes chars to be docked now? when did they change that?
---
Leadership is too arrogant and boring to do proper psyops and refuses to believe that the only way to win an internet war is to break the will of your enemies.
---
The statistics show real world events in form of numbers. 2,2000 less pilots log in.
---
The end of battle was swift.
---
Bankrupcy is technically one of the cheaper options when it comes to debt obligations.
---
But they;re owned by a parent company, so they;re more likely to have their assets sold off or simply shut down than file for bankrupcy.
---
Regardless - I'm not sure what you're point is here. Do you think it's a straight choice between you're suggestion and financial ruin? Do you not think perhaps that there are a plethora of options and avenues open to them that could make the game bigger, or survive for longer than trying to re-implement WiS and a seamless FPS component?
---
Sept 2018 we had a war raging on right? Numbers without context mean shit.
---
&gt; Why not bring back walking in stations how it was originally envisioned
---
Because it's a huge amount of effort to do so with a very limited probability that it would actually help. And if you have people logged in but sitting in station then there's no more interaction in space - if you make WiS too fun and people play blackjack instead of taking ships out, you've actually reduced content.
---
Prepare for downvotes.
---
I would argue it was made more visible (via the MER).  I would need to see some data that no one really has other than CCP to decide it was 'more or less bad'.  
---
However that is sort of a moot point, its like arguing over who's shit stinks more XD
---
I haven't played EVE in a while, am I'm totally out of the loop.
---
Can someone explain to me what Stuka and Goku fleets are? Aren't Goku fleets stealth bombers with afterburners and no cloaks?
---
I will be honest here, im 2009 player, i used to login every single day since 2009. I no longer log in because of last changes. But I only pay for 1 char, i never had any alts, and i dont buy skins or inject, so i think im not interesting for ccp anymore. But im glad you guyz are having fun and i am incredible happy you are having best time in eve. Sadly im not.
---
I mean.. real eve players dont even wear pants...
---
Its almost like we could use some fast anti-bomber frigates. We could call them Interceptors like the naval term.
---
There are 6 stages of loss before acceptance.
---
People aren't leaving cloaky alts logged in any more whilst going afk for 8hours. There's no longer a need. I'd love to know the average number of online cloaked ships each day, before and after blackout.
---
Won't make up the gap you're talking about, but I think it could be a decent number
---
I'm simply trying to refute people saying that the game would be better off without all the people that don't just wanna go out and pvp. It just wouldn't, and its a type of condescension that has been around forever. It's just stupid and revolves around people needing to feel superior over someone because they want to play the game differently.
---
60 bill worth of bombers can melt a 60 bill Titan. 16 bill of bombers can melt a 16 bill super carrier. 1.5 billion of bombers can melt a 1.5 bill rattlesnake. 60 million worth of cormorants or talwars can melt a bomber.
---
By that same logic, WH numbers are falling blackout too? lol
---
Most of the people crying are the ones in 80% of the null blue donut.
---
It's not really your decision to make whether something is dead weight or isn't. Sorry.
---
You're right. CCP already did.
---
Groundbreaking, truly
---
When you have that many supers together you can just gate them.
---
In other words the sky is fucking blue, and water is wet. What do you think should be the solution to the idea of people being blued up with each other?
---
Some kinda of space Bushido of "I solemnly Swear not to be friends with anyone but my corpmates"?
---
Yes this is where logic leads us
---
I can agree with this. I just disagree with the notion that a giant chunk of the community would be better off not playing the game at all because of the activities they choose to participate in.
---
A whale is someone who pays far more money to the game than the average user. If your calling a guy with 6 accounts (I am not one) a whale, then what are marsha and oldmecha with 100+ accounts?
---
&gt;Online petition
---
My fucking sides ahahahaha
---
More krabs is good. More krabs who get to their citadel before you're even in system is not. The complete nonsense of perfect intel channels active in every region plus the data available immediately from zkill means that the barrier to entry for attacking soft targets was ridiculously high. Maybe you could argue that the barrier to entry is now too low but the zkill and local info went both ways before. It would be very easy to bait a casual pvp'er into a bad situation now that they have no idea who is cloaked next to that lone procurer. The fact that this isn't happening that often is a testament to the failure mindset that PVE'ers shouldn't have to deal with those silly combat pilots.
---
null sec was empty for like 2 years now,either just vni domi gila bots
---
Even though dread insurance got nerfed, it's still a lot less even when you account for how much less insurance one side got. But: Ttitans used to be harder to replace and are not as difficult any more, and looks like RR probably looted the field, too.
---
sound like goon damage control...SHOW ME ON THE DOLL WHERE CCP FALCON TOUCHED YOU
---
&gt; 2019-09-02 13:42:33 Charles Dunois more i think about test
---
&gt; 2019-09-02 13:42:47 Charles Dunois i am reminded how questionable the general IQ of their ppl
---
well, he has a point
---
Thank you, sorted it!
---
Thanks man!
---
PvP venture fleets are the bomb
---
Peak....I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
So, you’re unaware of just how many 100+ moon systems there are.
---
Again, there were way more POSes than citadels.  You just couldn’t see them from off-grid.
---
It ONCE did, yes. But it's not like that was an average or a normal occurrence.
---
It also got us incarnage.
---
Your numbers mean shit without context, if we go by your logic, 04/21/2019 had a black out too.
---
The numbers show a steady long-term decline, the spike you see on  05/05/2019 is abyssal.
---
80% of null grasping on straws desperately. 
---
 [https://i.redd.it/dyhvfy5gl6k31.png](https://i.redd.it/dyhvfy5gl6k31.png)  What we see hear is steady decline of numbers as the donut gets bigger. We also see wars drive numbers if numbers are some what even, but today we have 80% of null blued up and so even the last recent conflict of Tribute glassing, where the 20% of the opposition couldn't be arsed to feed kills.
---
Unfortunately I joined the cartel well after the short story contest.It was merely something I decided to write after watching two pilots fumble around a wormhole chain. 
---
I hope there will be many more such little inspirations for my writing, I am glad you you enjoyed. Keep an eye out for more! :)
---
Yeah I get that you want a matchmaking of some sort but nobody would bother roaming if it was implemented this way. EvE wouldn't be the same after that.
---
Your idea actually look more like abyssal PvP, which could use some love too, so why not.
---
&gt;even if they overcome all these difficulties it makes the largest group in the game nomadic. Which I like mich better than current situation.
---
We would not be nomadic, we would just do crop rotation. One month we base in delve, the next we base in querious, the next we base in period basis, the next we base in fountain. Then we base in delve again and repeat the cycle. 
---
We're so organized that we literally already do this. We travel to querious/fountain/period basis and mine it, and then go back to delve, all within about 4 hours. In those 4 hours we effectively take about half the good moons in the entire region. Imagine if we stayed for a month at a time. 
---
Groups that can't rotate crops would be nerfed to the ground by comparison.
---
friend, i have been in fleets that were hit by burst projectors before. especially the neut burst is fucking scary. a few well aimed bursts and stukas are easy targets. so learn how to fly your fucking ships and stop crying, "we are too bad for this" is not a valid argument in a balance discussion.
---
Because they are not fully out yet.
---
A lot of bitter vets were part of alliances (or are still part of alliances) that are currently still active in the game, they still have that connection to those alliances, friends that play the game, they still talk to those friends about the game, and as such they are still aware of what is going on.
---
Also i'm sure that most of the bitter vets that are currently winning at eve but are still posting here, probably didn't biomassed their characters or gave away their assets, so they are still connected to the game directly, they are just not logging in.
---
The moment you quit the game by clearing out your assets, and biomassing your account, that's when its a lot easier to just completely ignore the game just like you ignore any game that stops giving you enjoyment.
---
I've won eve several times, and kinda am at the moment, though my accounts are still active, I've been losing interest to login, but until i completely quit the game by just selling all my stuff or giving it away, or putting everything onto a ship and going out in a ball of fire, i'm still in the game, just bitter and inactive.
---
I have no waahhhs for you, I'm having a great time. ;) I'd like to say that you are also entitled to your opinion except that you don't have one...all you have is your narrative and your downvote brigade lol. Can't wait for more chaos changes and more salt to farm...keep em coming. XD
---
You can just ask people in local for help. Usually you don't have to wait long until someone comes to help you out. I sometimes sit in the system of the last epic arc mission to help out newbros deal with Dagan.
---
Bringing back walking in station is a bad idea to attract more players
---
Did you know.. wearing pants while playing eve is optional!
---
same - i have barely logged in in the last 2 months. not because of black out, because of shifting irl priorities.
---
however the black out has made it a lot easier for me to kick eve down the priority list so i don't even remotely feel guilty about doing other things instead of logging in.
---
i think when my current subscription expires i think i might just let it lapse for the first time since creating this particular account back in '11.
---
Not really, they just changed the rules of the game a little. I don't have so much of a problem with them making things more challenging as I do with the cavalier way people seem to wanna just throw away huge populations of the games community.
---
This right here...
---
nobody afk mined in hulks anyway, you blink and the ore bay is full.
---
Lmao, still in the denial stage? No bigs, reality will hit eventually.
---
Scram mwd nerf. Injectors. Roqs. Anoms. Cynos. Standings icons. 
---
Whole playstyles have been bent to make 0.0 as safe as it is today since a few years into the game till today.
---
you guys literally whined for years that people should leave high and go to null.
---
then they did, and you whined they're shit and should fuck off back to high sec.
---
make up your minds, please.
---
I can understand your lack of motivation. If the Mittani is better at organization than you.
---
While building this into to
---
he game mechanics would be convenient, thete is no reason why we can't set this up ourselves.
---
My corp ( v o i d - g a t e ) which is still in it's conceptualization phase is a pvp corp with a focus on high sec semi-structured pvp. Friendly fire is enabled and we own no structures so we can fight internally in HS as we please with low risk of disruption. Thus could be expanded to low, null and, WH's with enough leadership and member numbers. For now, lets focus on creating the NPE we want to see! 
---
To start we have a single format T1M0 frigs, but we'll expand to more formats as the corp grows.
---
I need more leaders to contibute to the growth of this concept. Recruitment, advertising, organization, managing bets, etc. If you'd like to be a part of this movement please contact me in game: Noxi Void
---
Ice mining is already the best mining income per hour outside high end moon goo.
---
I can't imagine being such a colossal retard that I could at the sharply declining player counts and think to myself, "Yep! This is more activity! More recruits and players than ever!"
---
A good Chemo therapy does the trick on stukas.
---
Sure but we also have less jumps and less online players. It's not just one but many stats showing mess activity.
---
Also this one specifically flies in the face of so many people on reddit saying they haven't had so much pvp in ages.
---
Let me speed that up for you...
---
u/Dave-stark 
---
u/ericader
---
u/Lorenzo_maulerant
---
u/SharnhorstDW 
---
Come on in boys!
---
This is a fucking retarded post fuckoff Dino brain 
---
Congrats you have a spy in a mega coalition, good job
---
All the major blocks have 4-5 regions to mine, you'd just hurt the ones that aren't in the major blocks. 
---
The reason goons mine the most is because goons facilitate that behavior the most. No one who don't want to mine, are out mining, but those who consider mining a relaxing effortless way to reach their goals, are encouraged to mine with free SRP for faxes that save the rorqs and t2 rigged refineries and so forth. 
---
Meanwhile in groups like horde, you have to be part of the elite to even be allowed to mine, and in Ncdot you have to rent a system as far as I'm aware (they don't want your dead drones on their killboard). So the entry for mining is much greater, and people do less mining as a result. So in NCdot not only do you have to shill out for the rorquals and the SP to fly rorquals, but you have to shill out for the isk to rent the system and anchor structures in it. Meanwhile in goons you can begin mining as soon as you can get into the rorqual hull, before the blackout stuff people began rorqual mining before they could afford to buy excavator drones (because the rorqual would survive thanks to free fax SRP, so you'd make the isk for drones quicker than if you VNI ratted).
---
Imagine this being the only stay, we also saw jumps and online players down.
---
:DDD
---
I mean it could stand to reason. Less wormholers active because there is less for them to kill when they hunt.
---
Nobody is vote brigading you lmao, people are just starting to pick up on you being a sperging retard in every BO thread, so they're tired of the bullshit you spew.
---
Look at the numbers you fucking retard, biomass yourself in game and add to the slope
---
What's worse for the game? Unchecked near unlimited isk printing in null sec with non intended safety using Intel channels for bots?
---
Or unsafe nullsec where you have less population and have to travel to find kills?
---
Take em to GotG space.
---
when something isn't worth doing, it's difficult is an irrelevance.
---
What makes you the ultimate judge of what nullsec wants?
---
Cyno changes coming to somewhat tackle that issue.
---
Well I quit playing about a year ago so go ahead cuz I don't know shit since then.
---
Regardless rorquals went unchecked for 1.5-2 years so idk if saying how long it's been really helps ya buddy
---
This stat alone doesn't imply it just suggests. Combined with lower online numbers and less gate usage we can see that there are actually less things happening in game.
---
Because from their point of view Fuck CCP, and since they can't post that on the forums they post it here.
---
yeah bots and krabs leaving, praise yourselves because tax revenue went to shit.
---
Well if I was to ask the ghost of totalbicuit he would whisper a few things he said fairly often.
---
A game needs to be fun or compelling.
---
Hard should mean challenging but not tedious.
---
If a game is only fun with your friends, the game is bad, your friends are the fun. You could all be playing something fun.
---
If 100 players land on grid against one player, after spending considerable time finding that play, yes, they should die.
---
people didn't require local to play.
---
a lot of activities required local to be worth doing.
---
there's a big difference there.
---
Populations that didn't interact with the rest of the playerbase (if at all) unless they were forced to. No thanks, they won't be missed.
---
Even better, you force the system in your favor.  Lets use the goon example.  
---
Delve Home Region  
---
Querrios Farm Region 1  
---
Period Basis Farm Region 2  
---
Fountain Farm Region 3  
---
Delve is a baseline and you cycle farm regions.  
---
Month 1: Farm Delve, it hits the top in month 2, farm regions drop.  
---
Month 2: Farm 1, it hits the top in month 3, Delve drops to normalish (stragglers, home region, etc), other farm regions still bottom.  
---
Month 3: Farm 2, it hits the top, delve still avg, region 1 drops, region 3 still bottom.  
---
Month 4: Farm 3, it his the top, delve avg, region 1 hits bottom, region 2 is avg and dropping.  
---
Goons already own sov there.  They have keepstars there.  They have refineries and fracs and jump bridges.  
---
This is called the Crop Rotation, and has been talked about many times over the years.
---
because an init fc literally invented stukas maybe? vOv
---
It was bound to generate more PvP activity as a short term trend. With more pvpers returning to the game, if only for a short time.
---
My guess is, a number of bots/bears failed to log in and an indeterminate number of additional pvpers logged in.
---
None of this is a reason to make nullsec "safe" again.
---
Just cus Pando invented a doctrine doesn’t mean that Goon cock sucking Init want super umbrellas nerfed
---
To play the game with some skin the fight.
---
Killed by Big Black Cruisers.
---
But that is the danger, that we reached a state where in each war one side decides they have already lost or it isn't worth it to fight.  That once some minimum level of competence is reached the win goes to the side with the highest numbers.
---
Sun Tzu, Clauswitz, Napoleon and Frederick the Great wouldn't approve.
---
Local was only ever used to see who was in system, and spread spam that caused more time dilation and lag.
---
Really it was a good idea to get rid of it. It is normal for the EVE community to get mad about something it later recognized uses as a great thing, and then blame CCP for not continuing it.
---
Walking in stations come to mind. Peolle protested it hard, and now cry that it never happened.
---
man, you're one salty boi
---
In other news, clueless players are blaming other players for pointing out they have the right to an opinion.
---
We will update as this story develops, or kill a small kitten in the process.
---
for a second i was like "remote rep titans? who does that?"
---
But this shows it didn't actually generate more pvp activity even in the short term.
---
Nullsec wasn't safe when local existed, pvp players just cried because they couldn't get easy kills. Ships were dying more than they do without local now.
---
Frat could have actually been decent, but they went downhill so fast.
---
And look where blackout got us? 12k online Saturday nights
---
Resource depletion, but not vanilla resource depletion along with diminishing return to growth beyond a certain point.
---
Link resource regeneration to ADM and SOV levels with hard limit on ratting and mining per Region (2t?), ah but 80%null will say 'but we got Locust fleets', alright. First, there is content to be had with locust fleets, you'll find plenty of idiots dying when the umbrella is not there. Secondly, once the big groups are done scorching 2 core regions and 2 outer regions from home space (low ADMs, low resources farmed) and once these regions haven't sufficiently regenerated (make it like 6 months to regenerate etc?), then they'll need to go-to war and actually occupy a region to make it worth it. Occupying far away regions is kinda PITA as then you're home regions get harassed, that's when you go war with your neighbours.
---
At the same time, increase upkeep costs of Citadels and parking costs for Titans.
---
Too much growth needs to have diminishing returns.
---
People have been asking for a way to change skills remotely for years, CCP finally came through. All good imo
---
l m a o
---
Incorrect, it's about profitability. Without that, your niche game gets shut down. If you want to overpay to keep the lights on with Multi-boxers, Bots, and Pariahs your welcome to it.  
---
BTW: Is there a bathroom in your basement? That would be kinda cool.
---
Can confirm
---
Rofl no u
---
or people are hunting more in null vs WH.
---
It's not just an opinion, your being judgemental grouping all players that pve in nullsec into one group and trying to claim you know what they group wants.
---
&gt;But this shows it didn't actually generate more pvp activity even in the short term.
---
Notice that's not what I said. I said potentially more pvpers logged in, not that more PvP was happening.
---
&gt;Nullsec wasn't safe when local existed
---
If you believe this nonsense, there is no point continuing this conversation. 
---
&gt;Ships were dying more than they do without local now.
---
Ships were dying more as there was more population, because nullsec was safer to operate in and be "safe." Jesus, these aren't hard concepts to grasp man.
---
How would you know how long manufacturing jobs take? That's stuff carebears do. You have also not explained how you got the blueprints and minerals to build your totally real ships
---
I will bring back Windrunner Tornados, just in time for CCP to turn off the warp scrambling effect all structures have.  
---
:prayshardforWRT2019dreams:
---
Oh Jesus, grow up.
---
I'd agree except for the fact that I consistently get fights from Null sec entities actively defending their ratters. Stop whining, adapt or die.
---
https://media1.giphy.com/media/8G44PoelzaXXa/source.gif
---
So your a "carebear""krab", hypocritical moron.
---
According to you that is just an opinion I am allowed to have. How about you stop trying to speak for a group you aren't a part of and who you want to be able to kill easier.
---
This will be the final nail in the coffin for 99% of the carrier ratters out there. The blackout pushed a massive part of that crowd into domis and myrms. Now the rest are either going to move to those ships or upgrade to a super with a recon on standby. The people out carrier ratting are doing it for the money, the second you make it not worth their while to keep risking that ship they will stop. &lt; long time carrier ratter who will be switching down to a myrm when the changes hit.
---
yeah, why? You know the guy? :)
---
Because it says on the thingy when i start them. I buy them from other chad PvPers with alts that mine or do research. I only buy goods from people who have at least 500 solo kills.
---
GotG has really fallen off the cliff after the blackout. I'm not seeing all those insta-reaction ishtars and vnis in every system, perhaps they're forming up to do pvp with BBC and Horde sigs lol.
---
don't eagles with mjd literally destroy stukas
---
why'd you tell him? I wanted to see the cry thread when he bought the wrong ones
---
So post blackout we have less people playing and less PVP going on and you are of the opinion that is good for the game? And we have people screaming that "oh we have had so much more pvp than we used to" but when the numbers show that isn't actually happening they claim the facts are bullshit.
---
Also you said it was bound to generate more PVP activity, not get more PVP players to login, to which I replied "it did not generate more PVP activity." How is that not what you said and has nothing to do with what you said?
---
The problem is at some point we look forward to see what we are working towards. We want to see a balanced game and stable development. Neither are present when I look toward a future with this game.
---
Unless you are just referencing bots, than you are just flat out wrong with that statement. On more than one level.
---
I’d been winning Eve for a couple of years - back into it for the last week. Stuff happening is good.
---
That is also possible, but if that was the case things are even worse than first seen. This firstly means wormholes are now safer(ironically) than nullsec and secondly that the numbers would be even lower if wormholes hadn't stopped fighting in wspace and started fighting null space.
---
Nope did not say that either. All I did say was that bombers do not dance around caps as well as Marshy is saying they do.
---
Also tbf I wouldnt let anyone fight them that war :p
---
I'm waiting for the cry threads when the blops groups start getting counter dropped with T3c fleets and they realize that there is something worse than having supers and titans you can easily out run dropped on top of you.
---
The smell brought me here. I thought it was the Great Salt Lake, but it led me here instead.
---
There isnt inflation, buying power of isk has increased in terms of ships, not decreased. There is powercreep however, which is more an mmo phenomenon
---
See my other comment. I think there may be a misunderstanding among some people here what inflation means
---
This is a wonderful sub, why would anyone ever stop posting here!?
---
I wasn’t trying to support any view XD
---
I know for me I can’t play because of school.
---
I’m not saying eve isn’t dying or that it is.
---
I’m just saying what I thought might help impact the falling numbers, or maybe summer being over might increase the players.
---
I never said school starting might cause numbers to drop, or increase.
---
All I said was that school starting up might impact the number of people playing.
---
I’m sorry that made a bunch of you angry.
---
Here: “Reeeeee eve is dying! Bad CCP! See what you’ve done!? Reeeeeee”
---
Happy now?
---
I’ve let subs lapse over the years but never my main toon. This will be the first time it lapses
---
Is this a troll?
---
Can I have your stuff -&gt; 'No Dope' in game pls
---
Sharex can be setup to grab just one monitor, which is useful for me since I run a 4 monitor setup. It also auto uploads to a host of your choice (imgur) and copies the link to your clipboard. Pretty useful stuff.
---
Exactly this is the biggest thing, make eve as hardcore as you want if it makes the game more profitable. But it doesnt work like that. You are going to be the king of the most hardcore dead game.
---
I was tempted to do that but the old saying of trust in EVE rolls in my head and I need the cargo to complete the mission. Am I just being overly paranoid?
---
Ah, thank you for that. Looks like mine will be a bit more of a pain in the ass, gotta load the BIOS settings on startup to toggle. But it'll make gaming a bit easier for sure.
---
Pretty large exceptions you're including there.
---
I don't know how you can possibly feel that a tool like NEAR2 is acceptable for nullsec. If you are no longer logging in because you are no longer perfectly safe then, well, goodbye.
---
Huh. Did that role last until tiericide of 2013 (I think it was 2013?) or was it removed earlier? Somehow I don't remember anyone having 2 racial mining cruisers.
---
Except the post literally has a /s...
---
Are you able to look at npc kills in null/low/high and correlate that with login numbers?
---
shifting your rl priorities to dumbposting on reddit?
---
I think the solution is to rename every ship class "capital". Might get people to use different ships
---
Frankly, I'm just glad Valk changed up his posting habits. This is easily far more interesting then him madposting about the blackout.
---
It has nothing to do with capitals. The problem is cloaky bombers can attack whatever they want, wherever and whenever they want to. There's no counter to stop that. No ability to scan them, no ability to stop them without dozens of Defenders. Bombers are absolutely OP right now because there's nothing that can "stop" them, only avenge whatever they did.
---
&gt; T3D's near constantly get bombed to death quite often
---
Not gonna lie if your T3D fleet dies to bombers you need a better fit or a better FC.
---
I would sincerely love to see you attempt to provide a more detailed description of "you guys" as it applies to this post.
---
Well yes but they are not goons, goon pets would be more accurate
---
And there is the problem, ccp pushing carebare centric changes! Now if ccp pushed those changes with reasonable and equal opportunity for pvpers to dunk on said carebares game would be in a much better place! You know something called "balance"
---
I have been logging in and more active in the last two weeks in a measurable way (zkill) than at any time since 2015. After the fleet I had last night, I will likely increase my activity even more as I had a fucking blast.
---
Well, in that case you couldn't even trust the people in a community aimed to help new players with the epic arc. Paranoia is a good thing to have in eve, but it has to have a limit because if you can't trust anyone even for a small thing like that then you'll be playing eve solo, which will be hard mode to say the least
---
T1 battleships die to every doctrine though. They're slow, track hilariously badly, and have a gigantic sig.
---
&gt; Booshing is a bit OP no matter how you paint it. 
---
Then why don't the people getting owned by stukas use booshers?
---
I think what you're trying to say is that equality feels like oppression when you've been on top for so long.
---
Do you think the way the game is going is leading to a shutdown or to profitably? The biggest issue is ccp is saying the current state of the game is what they want. They dont see a problem with player counts creeping to the 10k mark.
---
That’s one way to interpret it. The other way to interpret it is that krabs, skill Farms, alts, etc are leaving the game because they can’t farm isk 24/7 anymore or it’s not self sufficient to have a handful of alts to farm 24-7 and plex for your guys. 
---
This sharp decline of old players could be met with a new wave of people joining the game just at a less numbers. Or a handful of other reasons that wouldn’t necessarily be shown in a PCU graph. 
---
I’m not saying that’s what’s happening exactly, but there are a handful of scenarios where lower count lead to a healthier game long term. That coupled with the only metric we have being “X players online”, makes it kinda weird. If we could see unique players as well, it would be kinda telling one way or the other.
---
Because when you shit post this hard (slamming myself, no one else) on any respectable subreddit, the community boots you.
---
If they cant adapt they can fuck off right back to eso
---
So you buy minerals from people who mine? Who are you going to buy it from when people dont mine anymore?
---
&gt; Why would you think someone with an init tag wants capitals to be properly balanced?
---
Can't help but chuckle at the fact that you're saying this while flairbaiting.
---
sounds super healthy tbh
---
I agree bombers itself are not the problem, but coming from a playstyle that has been catered to so much by CCP, he looks funny when he yells from a high horse because people are looking for a [mint](https://youtu.be/GxRnenQYG7I?t=300) .
---
That was PL's own fault. They sealed that fate when PL evicted Test/CO2 from the north. PL then postures after smacking Provi around then Test did what everyone knew what happened when PL came: Ask GSF to come.
---
The salt from PL and friends was enough to bathe in. Worth every moment and watched the rest just give up and head back was funny.
---
Ok, so something about TEST?
---
EVE grew for over 10 years. When WoW lost half its subs EVE was in its height.
---
Reminds me of VOLT as they faded into failure
---
5 years old player living in null here. Also a dad. 
---
I had 3 rorqs before the blackout that I would get in space whenever I was able. Kids are small so paying attention to my screens or sitting with headphones was impossible for more than a couple of minutes, but it was a risk that i was willing to take. I lost  20 bil of excavators to dread spawns or bomber runs while I was at bathroom changing diapers or at the kitchen filling bottles of milk. This was before the blackout.
---
So I adapted. I've let my vni/rorqs accounts unpayed. I stopped creating alpha accounts. I was planning to use my market toon that's on the same account with the main to get isk. 50-200 mil per day it's good money, I can afford a svipul  for the nights when I wanna roam, right? Then the market got fucked so instead of making profit, now i'm 5-7 bil poorer and with around 10 bil in stuff that will probably never sell at the price that I bought.
---
Given that the only thing that I can do now for isk is the pain of setting up some PI, instead I will just leave my main go alpha and maybe comeback to this game after my kids are old enough so I can dedicate a hour or two of uninterrupted eve.
---
Given the demographics of the people playing this i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who had to adapt this way. :/
---
They are viewed by Hilmar that way yes.
---
I love how EVE is getting back to it’s roots!!
---
CCP has for the past 3 years introduced mechanics and changes that favored bloc playstyle.
---
also rememered eve wiki might have a page... it does: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Jump\_clones](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Jump_clones)
---
He’s right tho. Sorry but your post is garbage.
---
Did RR have more Minos than the single one on the br?
---
65% have 1 account, 20% have 2.
---
&gt;If each ship is worth less, are we more prone to undock and have fun?
---
Guess it depends who you ask.  
---
That big spike in low sec kills in 2014 did not have a corresponding spike in isk value.  That was the Gallente taking the war zone.  Most low sec spikes were Gallente-Caldari system conflicts that drew tertiary PvP from all over.
---
And that was the most fun I ever had in Eve.  Losing 1-8 million isk ships by the dozens all day for days.  Faction Warfare was amazing. 
---
 I tried the big stuff.  Large expensive fleets stuck in tidi for hours and I hated it.  I admit, I tried it only because of how stagnation, elitism and capital proliferation ruined low sec.  It seemed like a progression, but it wasn't.  Then I won Eve.
---
So my answer is yes.  Resoundingly.  The fun part is the pvp, and cheaper ships make it more fun not less.
---
So, my thoughts on this is raw concurrent player count doesn’t necessarily mean much on its own as a metric. There are a couple of scenarios that could take us from lower player count to more successful that wouldn’t be super well reflected on the data we have access to. 
---
As an example, consider the following scenario - due to blackout / cyno changes, etc. it’s going to disproportionately affect players with large # of accounts, and those that want to farm 24/7. So maybe we see some of those people leave or accounts unsub. Only so many people of these exist, and would happen rather quickly (sharp drop offs, as opposed to a slow decline). At the same time - new players start joining in HS / LS, with increased retention. 
---
I’m not necessarily saying that’s happening, or even implying it, but just that there are metrics we don’t have access to (unique player count, as an example) that could really show the full story about what’s happening.
---
😋 🧂
---
Why would the nerfbat come? Bombers have always been meant to be an effective way to punch up? If anything it's the boosh that's gonna gets a change.
---
holy shit you fucking killed em man!
---
Same!
---
...and then SkillU disbanded due to lack of content and an intense hatred of sov and structure grinds. Is that a case of Fabian strategy unironically working in Eve?
---
And now it's not and wow is growing
---
I know in Null Sec you used to be able to start the New Player tutorial missions and it would make a random spawn in space and you could keep canceling and retrying the mission until you got a good spawn at a way deep safe. I assume the same was true for WHs. CCP fixed this about 6 months ago though when they patched it so that the Newbro missions can only be started in high sec.
---
I live in a wh Corp and having fun, players are not leaving my Corp and I don't find less things to shoot.
---
It was a joke..
---
&gt;I am actually interested to see what things start looking like after the cyno changes.
---
Oh, that's already happening.
---
Yes, Stuka and Goku refer to the same thing, no idea where the name comes from but it's speed and sig tanking bombers with command destroyers to chain jump them across grid.
---
Feel good quotes :)
---
Nah dude blackout is why it's empty it every system was plentiful with players before.
---
If you only take away one thing from this, let it be the firm understanding that things change over time.
---
EVE is gonna come out of this a better game.
---
Yeah look how you helped him become a dominant force. Too bad your alliance shut the doors.
---
 So you cant kill him.
---
So much cringe. It's just a game.
---
Are we playing the same game? In less then 20 jumps I got 3 fights last night and I frequently find them within 20 jumps. I can't grasp how people are hunting and not finding anything when I find it pretty consistently.
---
Because they are trash people
---
I'm with ya there as far as the cal/gal system conflicts. I dont think I've had as much fun doing anything else in eve as I did just smashing derplins and derptrons into each other for hours each day. 
---
Today's super risk averse nature isnt very much fun from a gameplay standpoint IMO.
---
"No one"?!?  I found TONS of VNIs all over the place...  Then they would all warp instantly to a safe/upwell/POS.
---
But not to work. Learned that one the hard way.
---
Counterpoint: You can play WOW while you play EVE.
---
WOW Classic is a bullshit scapegoat as well - everyone knows you can play WOW while playing EVE, it should not have this much effect for those who are riding that excuse horse.
---
People moving from nullsec mining in one of three blob coalitions to do other things in different parts of the game is a *good* thing.
---
Are you involved in the Eve Uni Wiki? Do you have any idea where the  tool at http://eve.ciambotti.com/shipfitting_parser.php went? Because some of the fittings are hella out of date and nobody can fix them as long as that tool is gone...
---
I'll take your stuff.
---
hes already use to that, you would think he would seek something different
---
Fighting SkillU was like fighting NC/PL before their subcap skills atrophied into oblivion. They had seemingly perfect line-pilot discipline, truly airtight opsec, spies everywhere, and continually innovated on tactics and compositions to gain edges over their foes. 
---
They would go as far as to do things like have literally zero of their faxes whore in fights, so you couldn't get the slightest idea from the BR how many faxes they could field. Nobody else did stuff like that, but SkillU made that kind of thing routine.
---
denial
---
Crazy how people have such fast reaction times right?
---
Cloaks affect me because when they’re done being afk and untouchable they can shoot anything at any time with no delay or cost to them not being there to fight my legitimate gameplay
---
I got downvoted so clearly others aren’t
---
What space?
---
more prep = call in more blues to blob more?
---
You must go to work hole space! Scan and scan and scan worm holes. Eventually you will find a C17. But... Before then you will have gotten bored and found you have lost a month of your life. Or you might find it on your first try :)
---
Only one way to find out! Let's set it up!
---
\*I am putting my ISK on Snuff though\*
---
It's the usual problem with rogues in MMOs: It doesn't matter how strong or weak they are. As long as they can freely choose when to engage and when not to, they will have a close to 100% win rate.
---
Yeah you can bring like a dozen confessors against 100 bombers and kick their asses. But in reality as soon as your confessors show up on d-scan the FC will call a retreat and you maybe catch a single guy that was unlucky enough to get pointed by a rorqual.
---
The pearl clutching is strong with this one
---
Unless you're colorblind, in which case you're wondering why there's a greyscale filter on the picture -_-
---
&gt; we can dock up so many rorquals dude get on our level  
---
anyway this is on me for not including the july data to demonstrate the whole coming back aspect but at this point i'm going deep into shill territory
---
I disagree, I thought focusing on the main game and not walking around stations/shooting on planets was the right decision right from the beginning. There are hundreds of fps. There is literally only one Eve.    
---
When they first announced the station walking/CQ and fps thing, I was just like, why why why. It has nothing to do with being a capsuleer. Who would someone who mentally floats among the stars, your ship is basically your body, want a captains quarters haha. Or to get shot in the face on a planet when you have 10 thousand torpedo's in your hold.
---
Is a Muninn a module for my titan?
---
Fair point! Thanks for the advice, I'll give it a go later. I guess worst comes to worst and someone steals the mission-item I can wait til maintenance &amp; reset
---
It's hard but honestly your semi-afk playstyle is something that should never have been profitable in null.
---
Personally I don't care about blackout, but since it started half of my friends are not playing anymore. 
---
It was exciting when it started, but now it just sucks. Can not see neither friend nor foe, boring.
---
Tenal/Deklein/pureblind/fade 
---
Like I don't get the issue people are having finding content. There have been rare moments where we don't find anything in 20 jumps but that's pretty rare. We just go where the map says is activity really. Those are the regions we ended up in last night.
---
Your definitely right, I wish there was a way to guide new players to player corps. At least an introduction to a few different types of player corps and a long to the recruiter channel and the looking for Corp window at least.
---
Ore will be worth more. Modules will sell for more. They never fired a shot or were f1 troglodytes. Would never be found in space on their own if anything remotely resembling risk was within a 10 jump radius. How is it a loss? The game will be healthier by the absence of these non entities.
---
Because there is still salt to collect and some bitter vets are addicted to it like squirrels on crack.
---
Wormholes are becoming the new "null". Can make a lot of isk there but it sounds like CCP might be soon shafting that too.
---
Eve is going to come out of this with 900 active players
---
I'm sorry mate but this attempted analogy is just bad. A cloaked ship, particularly if it's AFK, isn't doing anything. A bot is printing ISK the entire day.
---
A cloaked ship is also not untouchable, they can be decloaked.
---
And it's funny that you're talking about 'lifelong safety' while presumably lobbying to have local - i.e. instant safety - given back so you can rat safely.
---
Because you like less opportunity to kill shit? Do you hear yourself?
---
They don't have many decent FCs on their own. Without Origin they would have even less people capable of managing all this.
---
&gt; I expect that we will see higher peak numbers in the future because Eve will be a better game. It is moving in the right direction, even if there is a dip short term.
---
HODL
---
I don't have a horse in this race, but I just want to point out that people in this very thread are seeing the exact same data and drawing wildly different conclusions, all based on their feelings. If login counts went up after the blackout, some people would still claim it's only because of SP weekends or some other reason, and if the blackout really is the sole cause of the login decline, others who like it will still blame it all on bots and coincidental new game releases. There's people here who have given other reasons for why they stopped playing as much that has nothing to do with the blackout. We know for a fact they exist. But what percentage of the decline is due to those reasons? Who the fuck knows? Login numbers alone certainly aren't enough to figure that out.  
---
At the end of the day, everyone will see what they want to see, even when the numbers are saying no such thing. Their feelings doesn't care about your data.
---
you are disturbed too much by a random post which essentially says "we are having fun in post blackout eve thanks ccp"
---
"no one should ever express support for no local" is how your reply comes off
---
i'll just quote one last sentence from the title  
---
&gt; hits mostly meaningless 1T ISK killed
---
Are they wormholes or classes of wormhole systems? Class 17?
---
We operate around Provi which historically has a lower USTZ presence and now, even lower with the BO it appears. 
---
It’s not always about roaming for content. I like small fleet engagements and with citadels it’s harder to prompt an engagement. You can’t take on a moon POS to try to time it to come out in your TZ. It’s just a different environment now and it’s something I’ve noticed these past years. I noticed the decreasing blops targets, the options to harass a larger group have been decreased to troll entosising or anchoring citadels to come out of a time hopefully beneficial to you to spur a fight. Maybe it’s just me but I see a change and the content I used to partake in has gone to the wayside and what’s left has very little interest to me. For those who may say “adapt or die” or whatever meme is current, that’s fine, you can enjoy it as it is now but I don’t have too.
---
I think that's mainly because the early game is so insanely brutal. Especially with SP and ISK generation.
---
Yea Origin could have saved them, but they’re pretty unreliable. Most systems in WC/Detorid I roam I see ihubs and tcus on fire )
---
i quit two years ago.
---
r/eve is how i keep up with the changes in the game i WILL NEVER PLAY AGAIN.
---
I didn't even say they were bots.  They might not have been.  But perfect intel isn't the way this game was originally meant to be played.  
---
I started out as a hisec miner (first couple of months of my Eve career) so I sympathize with those mourning the loss of local.  But at least I used my eyes looking for CODE.  Now intel could be automated and that makes my forays in hisec look downright dangerous by comparison what NS became, but will much lower isk/hr.
---
Supporting his wife while she plays I imagine.
---
These are not cloaky

[https://i.imgur.com/SOperJE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SOperJE.jpg)
---
Are we going to talk about this?
---
How much for? I don't really have a need for it
---
How dare they bring a doctrine I have to form subcaps against.
---
&gt; That's the only indication that anyone is succeeding in this game.
---
Imagine equating krabbing with succeeding in a video game. Yikes.
---
Don't disagree with the proposals, but don't see how that stops people from getting blued up. Obviously it does discourage an actual blue doughnut, but we don't have an actual blue doughnut today anyway.
---
In fact if adopted i see the consequence of such proposals that it would make nullsec go back to the renter model, and by looking at the pie chart from ccp peligro, we really don't want more renter alliances in this game if at all possible.
---
The most interesting thing about the Blackout aftermath, to me, has been the realization how many people playing this game are pants-shittingly furious that they are no longer able to "play" Eve Online completely and utterly AFK for hours long stretches at a time, with zero implied risk and in absolute safety.
---
I can see at least 5-6 faxes in the video on the left side. So the two titans on the right were probably too far for the reps. Or somebody realised now would be a good time to Boson the dreads from 3-4 angles at the same time.
---
so amarr one will be curse?
---
If you're constantly making them disengage, then they're wasting manhours too. You standing there as sentry against them means they have to stand there and wait for you to leave. 
---
Yes, it sucks for you, but at least make it suck for them.
---
Foxcats or the like can deal with most, but die horribly to caps, and are too slow to formup to save rorqs. 
---
They can tank like 60+ bombs and track out to 100km with scorch. Just cant move for fucj
---
lmao nice one.
---
That's what I was trying to figure out does the link show what my status was at the time?  Like if I was flagged as suspect can't think of anything I did to flag myself.
---
Eve has been a huge part of my life. I started at 14 and quit at 29. 15 years? 
---
The people I have met have informed my life, shaped who I have become. I am a more generous, thoughtful, cynical, trusting and brave person than I was at 14. The path of who I am has changed totally; I was a weirdo loner, and through a few very important corporations, friendships and business partnerships I have come to understand the real, immutable value of building lasting relationships with people.  
---
Some of those people quit Eve without leaving a contact method, some of them have died. Life has changed so much that the relationships that made it what it was for me aren't there anymore, and the gameplay has changed such that I can't easily pick it up anymore. 
---
Coming here reminds me viscerally of what Eve has and will always be to me. 
---
But I don't usually post here so I guess I'm not your demographic. But I read here still.
---
Mkay.
---
you mean logging into r/eve, right?
---
And buy new ones
---
I'd like to see an item database. But being able to buy core skills and change training is great.
---
not saying you are wrong
---
But youre statistics are too narrow to draw a conclusion, esp the one you are trying to show. Your clear bias makes all of this hard to trust.
---
You operate around provi but I'd recommend Vale/Tribute a lot of the timers there are US TZ if you rf them to force content.  Blops has died for so many reasons I wouldn't say died still content if you put in the effort but tons of changes have hurt it form citadels,fighter changes and so on.
---
I don't think it's gone to the wayside atleast the smaller fleet fights are not in provi.
---
wont you have to have a constant standing fleet that is more organized than "ok there are enough caps undocked, jump to cyno"?
---
Hello sir, I am sorry to read that you are leaving the game and hope that your journey is good and peaceful. It bereaves me to see that an old player has once more left their accounts to rust, and so as an upstanding gentleman and stranger-friend, could I be so rude as to lay claim to your remaining assets?
---
Cause it’s Hotel Eve, where you can check out but you can never leave. I’ve won Eve a couple times. But eventually, we all come back
---
This is now a salty goon posting thread.
---
From just a logical perspective, the krab has no motivation to undock if he's almost guranteed to loose his ratting ship and not make any money.
---
Because 200 V 1 ganks are so entertaining
---
So it was you
---
People simply aren't that rational. 
---
Why do people get so emotionally invested in their favourite sports team if they don't play for that team?
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
It's the same reason a ton of bittervets keep up with any of the games they used to play.  They're upset that the game has turned in to something they don't like.  Instead of attempting to adapt and enjoy a new style of gameplay, they'd rather just complain about it while jumping on some other game.  Doesn't matter if they've been playing for fifteen days or fifteen years, they all act like children.
---
They're upset that they're getting left behind because they don't want to put in the effort to keep up, so they'd rather try to convince everybody the game is garbage instead.  Maybe if they can convince everybody else that the game is garbage, then it won't make them a bittervet anymore.
---
What do Stuka fleets and player base have in common? They both keep diving down.
---
&gt; because back then
---
back then rorquals weren't dismantling the game's economy
---
I was in the exact same spot a year ago. Mentally that is. 
---
I came back a week ago and rejoined my corp. Never believed I'd be having as much fun as I am!
---
I was pretty active once upon a time, but on this run I am playing Eve on a casual basis. Some nano shit out of our nullsec static, some novelty fits I want to try out and that's just about it. 
---
The changes are good. Are they good enough to either convince someone who feels like you do to stay, or even return? No idea. All I can say is that having access to content by being able to roll, is the single most important thing that makes EVE enjoyable for me. 
---
That and the fam of course
---
ps: take your long needed break. A man at your state needs one. But know friend, that when you're ready to come back, it won't be just because of change A or B. It'll be because you'll once again will have it in you to bother with this game :3 Fly safe irl and hope to shoot you again some day :3
---
It's good that you're making this so permanent.
---
The funny thing is that this must be a relatively new(ish?) bug, because at some point during my 2010-2012 stint of binging EVE I remember quietly spending *hours* testing things with the log viewer to see if there was anything "useful" that could be scraped from it. 
---
The reason I started playing around with the log viewer to begin with was because (after discovering its existence) I thought it might give away info regarding stuff like cloaked ships, what ship type just jumped into you, etc. Never found anything particularly useful, and it certainly wasn't as obvious as what is demonstrated in your video and screenshots.
---
Just like the black out, its working as intended you will just have to get used to it.
---
Curse is a fucking NPC region, nobody can ever evict you if you want to go live there. Cloud Ring pretty much the same, nobody has given a single fuck over that region besided being a handy highway passing through point. 
---
Last time I checked nobody wants to hold Vale because you are in range of everything and everybody. Catch is a massive region and a central connection to half a dozen regions, You really expect anybody sane to open that flank to their empire? I suggest you go to Outer Ring. Nobody ever comes there and it is a massive NPC region.
---
You wont need to put ISK on Snuffed. CCP already has them covered.
---
Yeah I've been playing for a while now and I did the same thing when I first learned about the log viewer (and the log server).
---
Like I wrote in the post, I didn't actually expect to find anything there. Imagine my surprise when it was right there, clear as day.
---
Really? Are we seriously going to meme on this dumb shit? You do realise that Snuff welps dreads like they are T1 battleships and somehow are magically replaced already? There are more sources of good income besides rorq mining you know. Or wait, you put rorq mining alts into powerbloc x and give no fucks.
---
Once frat falls the front line moves north by 2 regions and we start again.
---
Lol. Dks a high end sig...
---
Stukas don't have cloak online.
---
Why don't we just pay seddow rmt isk and hook him on cocaine?
---
I’ve noticed the opposite, but every region will be different. I’m fairly new so it could be that I just know where to find people now
---
No, it’s the people who are not assholes that are downvoting.

Not all of them are t1. We drop on what is out. As someone who hunts in every single one of our fleets, I can tell you that hunting is more enjoyable than ever. There’s less ships in space, sure. No bots... more risk. 
---
Before blackout, you jump in system with 15 vni’s on dscan and before you can even land in a site with one. They have pulled drones and warped to a citadel. Sifting through all of the noncatchable bots took more time than I would like to admit. The fact is, hunting is less time consuming because whatever I find is catchable. It may be bait, but I can catch it.
---
Link me your killboard
---
maybe this log messages were generated because you are testing using 2 clients at the same machine???
---
Link your killboard
---
Just tested with a friend, still works
---
We're worried about overfishing there tbh. Gotta let the stocks rebuild
---
COSMOS. That is where CCP fucked the dog. That project should never have been aborted.
---
If you think that EVE wormholes have anything at all to do with astronomy, uh... I don't know what to tell you other than "pls delete your reddit account"
---
My main has lapsed now, but that's mostly because they are getting as much SP as normal unsubbed anyway, and the projects I'm using them for at the moment don't require frequent logins or Omega skills.
---
As someone who stopped winning a month or so ago, but *was* continually shitting up this subreddit, I feel personally attacked.
---
lol. No I don't.
---
Eve has been a big part of my life. More than 25% of it. It was a large part of why I got my current job. Being AUTZ in a USTZ corp means a lot of fucking around on comms at weird hours (in business speak that translates to being able to work with people together effectively in different timezones via teleconference). Being good with spreadsheets is also appealing if you're developing logistics and accounting software. 
---
Even though I still don't like the direction Eve is heading, I am still incredibly thankful for what Eve has been and the work CCP has put in. I've made a shitload of friends through Eve. I still have a shitload of good memories to reminisce on. I very likely do deserve to be called a Bitter Vet, but I have absolutely no regrets about sinking eight years of my life into Eve.
---
Why not?
---
Completely agree. It used to be sparse before, but every region is now like the botlands. Very unfortunate.
---
Or, the krab could make himself a bit more dangerous so not every asshole with a scram gets a free kill?
---
no one cares kid.
---
Such a nonsense comment. How can they be safe and afk at the same time? It doesn’t add up. Think before you write next time.
---
There isn’t a local, no shit.
---
*carebears had the counter all along*
---
Really though, this is pretty shit. Hopefully gets some attention quickly.
---
Possible, but very unlikely. 
---
I've also observed the network traffic. I didn't try to reverse engineer anything, but there is very little network activity when you're sitting on an empty grid. Going by the timing alone I'm 90% sure that there are network packets that tell the client about the warp being initiated and triggering whatever generates those messages. So the information does come from the server and not somehow from anything on my machine.
---
As someone who has tried to bring many hardcore gamers in to eve, the reason most stopped playing wasn't the npe, the overview, or lack of direction. It was skill training time, with no way to accelerate it 
---
Ive said this before, but since Alpha and skill injectors, the people I have introduced to the game have stayed playing.
---
login as alpha first
---
Sadly, many players are experiencing the opposite, resulting in less possible targets for you to find. Who would have thought that Eve requires all kinds of players to work, eh?
---
Make sure this shit gets upvoted. Krabs love to downvote shit like this.
---
Eve...
---
"You can check-out any time you like,
---
But you can never leave! "
---
Yes, it really feels like CCP should put this beauty to rest. It's been a good run. But all these current half measures are grotesque.
---
NC. Made it to the fight. The node crashed before they were able to jump.
---
Yes, everyone is just downvoting me.... with all -12 downvotes I have atm..... Looks more like a Goonie downvote squad to me.
---
One can already start seeing the price volatility as a result of the nullsec industrial machinery slowing down.
---
To its roots?!? Eve has roots with players that were risk averse! They have always been here, it’s just now they are used as a reason to push an agenda giving people the perception that they are even more elite that they thought they were. Sadly, these people don’t look beyond their nose and don’t realise that they are hurting themselves by pushing this.
---
If you need a tutorial on zkill, I can offer you a lesson for a fee. Just lmk ;)
---
The attack that killed your staging keepstar?
---
You know someone has to pay for their accounts, right? PLEXes are bought with real world money. If players/chars are declining, then revenue is definitely declining.
---
You keep saying this but it’s bullshit.
---
Thank you for not letting us forget why this is a difficult discussion to have, where imaginary grievances trump hard facts.
---
Reap what you sow, brotha'!
---
The other option is your posts were worth the time of only 12 people to interact with. Sad, either way.
---
Who's going to hold that space when it's taken?
---
CCPlease
---
"Lot's," huh? Do tell.
---
What makes you think that?
---
a certain group already does that with supers and titans, this would be easier because it is less skill intensive.
---
*it's not a bug, it's a feature*
---
Just wanted to do some honest botting.
---
I first played the game back in 2004-2006, the player count usually peaked at around 10-15 thousand for about half that time span. The game was much harder and challenging, people were having fun playing, we had stuff available to shoot all day long whenever we wanted to and everything was fine. I remember before my corp at the time even moved to null, we'd often just set course for PF-346 and try to get in some trouble, and there would always be a camp there to try and fight (same for HED-GP in the south, M-OEE8 in the northeast and pretty much every other entry point to nullsec).
---
People were actually out in space, doing space stuff and blowing each other up, instead of spending all their energy trying to poke holes in the game for not hand-holding them the entire way and wiping their precious little tears whenever they made a boo-boo.
---
Now contrast this with the current status quo. A few months ago (i think it was December, so it's way before the blackout) i was in an NPSI fleet. We roamed for 3-4 hours and everything was so totally empty. All you could find was a couple AFK VNIs every 5-10 systems or so, with the exception of the occasional capital drop where people would cyno 15 caps on your gang of frigates and dessies after about 40 minutes of you roaming their space, and then complain that you don't fight them when they bring something that guarantees there will be no fight. They could just get into some tech1 cruisers and try to have some fun but noooo, we can't let some fun pew-pew get in the way of dank ticks.
---
I'm sorry if it doesn't fit the narrative, but low PCU numbers didn't kill the game at all and they didn't kill CCP either. On the contrary, those numbers were enough to pay their salaries, fund the development of all the cool stuff we've seen over the years and pave the way for the 30k PCU figures down the line.
---
So, to TL;DR  the whole point and because i'm too bored to make an entire essay explaining stuff that is blatantly obvious for anyone who has 2 neurons to rub together, PCU is not the only measure of the game's health and it might even be a pretty superficial, easily manipulated one at that. Case in point, every single ping-warrior AFK in some citadel is pretty much equivalent to a player who's not logged in, in terms of actually interacting with the game world, but he's counted in the PCU statistics.
---
It's quite skewed because PCU only counts people logged in, but it certainly doesn't tell you how active those people are. I have a trading alt that just sits in Jita 4-4 and her job is to make me 200-400 mil every few hours whenever i watch netflix, so that i can whelp a few ships on my pvp character every now and then. So, by the definition of people who uphold PCU as some sort of holy grail, that hangar queen is a content creator because she's online for far more hours than my pvp toon, despite the fact that her playstyle is totally low-effort and i don't interact with anybody when i log her in, update a few orders, alt-tab back to a movie and repeat that every 30 minutes or so.
---
In all seriousness though, get out there, play the game and stop being crybabies. Or just stop playing if it's not fun anymore, take a break and come back later, etc, that's also a valid choice.  I was winning eve for more than a decade, came back a  couple of years ago and i just play casually, a few months here and there every year. Whenever i burn out, i take a break.
---
Just don't try to warp something that should honestly read "i don't like my low-effort playstyle getting nerfed/other people's low-effort playstyle getting buffed" into some kind of masterful narrative that tries to convince us nerfing said playstyle is bad for the game (especially when it's pretty obvious that it's actually responsible for much of the game's current problems).
---
I seriously don't know wtf happened to the average nullsec dweller during the years i was away, but it seems they've gone from "i'm proud to live in a place where life is hard, we kill and die all the time and this is how it's supposed to be", to "please, let me endlessly farm shit in space in relative peace and quiet, unless it's a time of my own choosing where i do some light-consequence pvp on my own terms". 
---
Grumpy old man/bitterver rant, i know, but seriously guys. It looks as if nullsec today is just a playground full of carebears. There are week-old newbros in tech1 haulers running the gauntlet daily through places like Uedama and Niarja that have bigger balls than the average coalition/bloc line member.
---
You did this on Sisi, right? The logs generated could be different between the two servers. That seems like a massive oversight to have in a production environment but a very necessary thing in a test environment.
---
Right.
---
Guaranteed lost ship + don't make money = no prey.  
---
Safe ship + make money = no predator.  
---
Guaranteed lost ship + make money = predator AND prey are happy.
---
In a way, that’s accurate.
---
Before blackout, we weren’t dropping on anything. After blackout we drop on stuff then I’m like “hey anybody wanna shoot some mtu’s while we sit our fatigue out?”
---
Great observation!!
---
&gt;  what the fuck else do u want that response to have?
---
An actual and meaningful answer without a condescending tone? Is it *that* hard to figure out?
---
I tried it on **TQ** with my alt, and absolutely nothing appeared in Activity Logs. Tried warping in, warping out, cloaked, uncloaked, and I got fuck all in my logs.
---
Is it? They might as well have been NPCs.
---
Probably the Russians. They like holding lots of unnecessary space.
---
[Perhaps this could help accelerate the process?](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)
---
I agree, it's sad, but probably not for the same reasons as you
---
Yeah the attack that lost hundreds of billions before it barely succeeded with 40second left on the clock, totalling a net loss for the attackers, not even counting the side campaign which fed over 2trillion in losses for the aggressors, that saw offensive Titans being hodropped on keepstars with nigh impunity, offensive fleets smartbombed by day old spy characters such as "N*gger McN*gger face", which after the keepstars was killed nothing actually happened as aggressors couldn't kill the other structures without 4x numbers, which saw cap fleets feed to anticap fit astrahuts because the aggressors were retarded, oh man I could go on and on.
---
I had a blast in that war killed way more than I lost, and I got to hear PGL bitch and moan when he got curb stomped multiple times.
---
Betting he will quit/get laid off after the October deal is finished...
---
&gt;How can a station be that far out? 
---
Deepsafe... is that not an answer?
---
Thus is balance. Needs to be keeled in game
---
I'm sorry, did you mistake my comment for actual concern? 
---
All that's changed is Goonie carebears went from multiboxing Rorqs and AFK VNIs to multiboxing Reddit accounts to try to control the narrative seeing as how they think that Reddit influences CCP. I guess since they can't brigade the CSM they're going to try to brigade Reddit.
---
Ship alert 3'rd party software will be made in 3,2,1..  
---
Really good for rattes, botters, explorers, etc.
---
Good point, I did it on sisi because I was playing around with tools that are technically against the EULA. I think as the "last"/"highest" testing environment I think it's set up to be pretty much identical to TQ though.
---
I'm about to go to bed, so I'm not going to do anything else today, but feel free to test it on TQ. It's easy enough to replicate.
---
If you find that it doesn't work like that in TQ I'll contract you a fedo or something.
---
Oh come on, stop being a numpty.
---
Yes.  From the top down.  Vily was irate whenever someone fed, and our strategy was to refuse to take engagements if a feed might happen.  
---
Not saying feeds didn't happen, but it informed every aspect of our decision making.
---
Maybe it's because both clients run on the same physical PC.  
---
For clean experiment, try it with two separate PCs.
---
Provide an argument that they are more than just a body occupying space.
---
Remote Repairs are an unspoken part of the problem. 
---
If you can't break through the opponent's logi, but they can break through yours, your FC *will* extract.
---
we're talking about a doctrine that doesn't cloak, your comparison doesn't fly tbh.
---
Less people logging in.  That's what's worse for the game...
---
There really is no need because you are being utterly ridiculous. There is little wonder why people are taking the piss out of your responses.
---
Bcs it is known abd it is what they do. They'd sell their mom in order to preserve their advantage in-game.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
Omg CCP plz.
---
Evidently people want to play Farmville.
---
Did it generate anything in the log with a cloaked ship landing on grid? or just initiating warp.
---
&gt; The decline has been happening steadily since Fozzie Sov
---
FIFY
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cyvq7y/big_bug_eve_client_receives_information_about/eyuhvre/
---
What advantage? You think players that are ratting will pull out the evelogs programme to watch for cloaked ships? Jesus. Maybe a tiny minority but most wont.
---
Again: Those numbers on Eve-Offline do not account for the to a of botter alts that stopped logging when Blackout started.
---
Stop being a retarded carebear, pretenting you know it all.
---
https://i.imgur.com/K7F1SZj.png
---
&gt; scatter, cap up, online cloaks.
---
Wow that was hard.
---
Its an illogical solution. A PVE fit ship will always loose to a PVP hunter. Even  more, the PVE is motivated to be solo, so a hunter gang will always win.
---
The PVE must remain undocked and vulnerable, and the hunter can choose to engage or not. 
---
The PVE farmer either never sees combat, and is guranteed dead if he does.
---
This is why rorquals have panic. And also make for great content.
---
Not with that attitude.
---
how exactly did CCP cater to stukas specifically?
---
I mean i know a guy who can get us the goods...
---
Monitoring this is trivially written into a bot, and there are certainly no bots in eve....
---
They'll use a program their alliance provides for it. People have been champing at the bit for a near2 replacement.
---
You are the cancer that needs to be driven out if Eve.
---
Are you asking why being able to AFK-farm a PVE action is a bad thing?
---
Just tested it with some others on TQ. It doesn't show the info in the log viewer to what we could see.
---
HOWEVER: Looking at Network, Packets and Memory, They light up like a Christmas tree and paint a pretty good picture of exactly what it going on.
---
yeah, especially the logi, the command dessis and the kikis aswell as the odd electronic attack frig will do that just fine, right?
---
The answer is that boosh, HAW dread, and supercarriers all need nerfs.
---
Chain booshing completely destroys subcap mobility balance, because your mobility is outsourced to another ship.
---
HAW dreads are bullshit and oppressive. I'd make HAW guns give resist penalties or fitting hogs so you can't HAW fit and have a good tank at the same time.
---
Supercarriers also bullshit and oppressive. Remove support and light fighters from them. Give them "heavy support fighters" that only work on caps due to sig radius or something.
---
I didn't say hold a grid
---
I said operate on grid
---
Seriously, "oh 4 people can't defend our sov from 600".
---
No. Shit.
---
Oh no no, Ill be logged in to dissuade the idiots who want to run through delve.
---
You said semi afk, not full afk, read your words.
---
How about :
---
&gt;Guaranteed fight +  winner makes money = predator AND prey are happy and there is an ecosystem.
---
This is probably the ideal case. Kind of like the ESS, or rorqual panic. Killing farmers should make a profit, if you can win against a pvp defender. Krabs should have big profits and good ability to defend from loss.
---
Krabs have fun because PVP comes to them. Good hunters can get kills and maybe snag some loot. Lots of content.
---
Problem is it takes delicate balance. Right now ratters have a very hard time  defending carriers etc. Rorquals are still ok i think.
---
This entire thread is designed to shit on the blackout, so I'm not entirely surprised that I'm getting these kinds of responses. I don't feel like I have less targets. If anything, I feel like I have more. Maybe it's a combination of being in a different environment, but there were a lot of times when I would roll the null static in my former wormhole and find only bots. I got a full zkill page yesterday from three different fights. This game needs multiple types of people to work, sure, and you acting like I said anything different is false. However, I've been here for 15 years. This is not the first, second, or fourteenth time I've seen a change that caused a bunch of people to stop playing temporarily, or to whine incessently on COAD/FHC/Reddit about it. This community is a shitty echo chamber, and the anti-blackout crowd is being consistently spearheaded by people who have a vested interest in perfect intel and security. Why do you think a majority of these threads are started by GSF/TEST/Phorde members? They're not looking for actual information, they're looking for confirmation bias.
---
That is how I won Eve. I never could think of a good enough reason to come back.
---
Nah not really, your radicalised hate monger bullshit needs to leave however.
---
Near2 is bullshit and CCP should have banned it. Why people blame players and not CCP is beyond me.
---
Yes I am going to meme on "this dumb shit" because its reddit. And i like to see your salt tears.
---
Chain booshing AB confessors are very fun. One of my favorite fleets.
---
Doesn’t look beautiful on my potato settings.
---
But that’s botting and is bannable, believe it or not, the majority of Eve players don’t bot.
---
Maybe we need nerf long range fighter’s application more or bring back pre-nerf T3’s signature radius?
---
Ye Sure HAW guns and supers being able to kill almost every subs doctrine without subcap support is dumb
---
but I think everyone can’t deny current boosh fleet is also dumb; simply they have too small risk.
---
EVE is real... full of bugs.
---
 this is very serious ... how long will it take CCP to resolve the bug / exploit ... ? fuc:(
---
I unsubbed my 10+ accounts nearly a year ago. The 5-6 hours of doing nothing for the hope of doing something kinda just burned me out. In 10+ years of eve I just had no reason to log in anymore.
---
Indeed, that dunning Kruger effect is a bitch isn’t it.
---
lmao
---
Didn't we go about having the mods remove all the posts about how Eve tells our clients EVERYTHING and it would be super easy to exploit?
---
Like, there were people posting about how they made bots and how even RuneScape has done a better job at not giving the client all the power in the world. I hope team security has been fixing this?
---
Or if not that power explorer Astero with hacking implants and a Zeugma already picked the good cans.
---
You believe they do?
---
See. That brigade response was surely a quick one. keep on downvoting, krabs!
---
Do you really think the majority of players bot??
---
Muninn tracking? Harpies with booshers? Sentry Domis? Gosh Stukas are so powerfull
---
Ahhh. Trapper keeper table?
---
No, I'm quite sure that the majority of accounts are not bots. That doesn't mean that there aren't a significant number of bots to the point there's an impact on the economy. This would also be pretty easy to write an app to look for this happening and create an audio notification to people who aren't botters.
---
Is it though?
---
Im not convinced having less people playing the game is worse than lots of bots, a runaway economy and titans being used like frigates.
---
You are not even making any sense. You are just being another retarded mouthbreather. I have no interest in either Snuff or Test. So I am sure as fuck am not going to be "shedding salty tears" over any of them. Also the "mining salt" comment was popular in like 2017. You managed to be behind on the memetrain by a whole 2 years. That is like 2 adult lifes IRL btw.  You are probably thinking you are some 200 IQ meme dank poster. Sorry son, you are not even passing the goon standards on this. Let alone SA.
---
You would know.
---
Oh look another day another goon thread about black out.
---
The instant apocs hit the field frigates can just leave since you aren't getting dictors/recons near that blob.
---
CCP really undervalues mobility as part of a ships power, both strategic mobility via jump drives and tactical mobility via fast/fast aligning ships.
---
&gt;If you only take away one thing from this, let it be the firm understanding that things change over time.
---
&gt;EVE is gonna come out of this a better game.
---
That's mighty optimistic.
---
Less players playing. Less player ships being destroyed in null than before the blackout. These aren't signs of improvement.
---
You can go on about how it'll be a better game etc, but if the trend continues, we'll bleed players till there'll only be a handful left to see it.
---
Just tested it on TQ, it absolutely does show the info in the log viewer as advertised
---
People have been complaining about supers for years and they’re still OP.
---
You much prefer CCP try using a band aid to fix a compound fracture? Blackout is not going to fix a thing, quite the opposite. 
---
Bots have been a massive issue for years, CCP needed to double down on dealing with them but took a pretty light touch towards them. Now you have a massively toxic situation, more toxic than I have ever seen since starting eve in 2003. The game used to be pretty comfortable with the fact that all types of player were required, now you have elite circle jerks over forcing certain plate styles from the game. It’s disgusting to see. 
---
Suffice to say time will tell, and it won’t be pretty unless CCP invariably fix the core issues with the game, not half ass a mechanic to cater towards a vocal minority and then piss out skill points to inflate player levels, which clearly hasn’t worked.
---
Thousand of bots. Stop. To log in.  
---
Nope.  
---
Thousand. Of bots stop to. Log in.

Thousand of bots stop. To log. In.

I think the poster is trying to call someone retarded. But it’s hard to tell over the creative grammar choices.
---
Nothing w/ cloaky landing on grid, only warping off grid
---
Maybe, there's nothing wrong in it.
---
People shit post 24/7 about content or about Eve being a pvp game.
---
Well it's not... and also setting your own objectives and archive them is content, and I don't care if it's collecting killmarks or building a JF, being a sandbox is the real nature of Eve.
---
Null always been the natural place for the sandbox essence of Eve, because it's the only place really player driven, and this chaos bullshit is destroying this nature, that's why people is not logging anymore, and why a lot of them are not renewing subs.
---
Thanks, I would, since those dealing with the dunning kruger effects typically don’t.
---
I noticed this happening when I would land on grid with someone while I was cloaked too
---
Because he devoted thousands or tens of thousands of hours to her, and then she broke his heart by changing too much. Maybe he changed a bit too. And for all her flaws he can't find anybody better, so he's waiting around for her to die already so he can have a bit of closure. He knows she's going to do the same thing to you, but you're too stubbornly naive to believe it.
---
Then CCP should fix it, rather than people hate-fucking their keyboards to increase the already massively toxic bullshit that is on this sub with regards to certain playstyles.
---
Nah. My characters are 
---
#aesthetic.
---
What brigade? There’s a 96% upvote you crank.
---
I'd log in for this. Do it.
---
I'm confused, I'm aware there's more than one corp in Villore Accords, my corp is one of those that makes up the alliance 😋
---
Taken from TQ on 2 different clients:
---
23:02:27    svc::space    info    Space::OnSpecialFX -  effects.JumpOut
---
Also:
---
23:16:17	svc::space	info	Space::OnSpecialFX -  effects.JumpOutWormhole
---
So you basically go and have a pod on a gate/nearby citadel waiting for either of these events and you instantly know if someone on that grid has taken the gate/wormhole.
---
Dear CCP, this is game breaking.
---
And warped uphill both ways while listening to Korn and didn't have autopilot!
---
Who?
---
Unlike some, I have a CV backing up my opinions.
---
You do? Mind if I see it?
---
Given the language diversity in he EVE player base, I'd bet that English isn't the OP's first language.
---
I have reproduced this on live with both an alt and other players, submitted another bug report, EBR-181744.
---
Are you pretending or are you genuinely as obtuse as your comments would suggest?
---
On behalf of Northern Coalition, we fully support and endorse the Blackout. It's fantastic. People have to actually play together. Phenomenal concept.
---
!vily
---
&gt; You much prefer CCP try using a band aid to fix a compound fracture? Blackout is not going to fix a thing, quite the opposite.
---
So, your incredibly obvious bias aside, I also think this is incorrect. You claim there is a compound fracture, but apparently want the game to go back to that instead of them attempting to fix it. But, again, time will tell. People act like blackout is just gonna stop here and there won't be more proposed changes. Who knows what they'll decide to do next.
---
You are so obviously retarded lol.
---
The afk ratting withdrawal must be really though on you.
---
carebears i would guess from the title. What idiotic way he's interpreting the data I have no idea.
---
This is very true. I don't log in often any more because after five years it had just got dull no matter where I went or how I played. But the community is both amazing and a dumpster fire that I can't quit.
---
if successfully dropping a KS in the middle of hostile space is losing, then what is winning?
---
&gt; Hunters don’t want to get welped my by dozen supercarriers/titans, thus they are risk averse baddies.
---
Yup, We realised we had the Data sorted wrong and corrected it, Its showing.
---
ALSO: We have also noticed that its showing a data dump for characters when they log in, And upon digging into the string, Also shows the location / structure they log in at
---
well, CCPlease, I guess...
---
But that isn't normally hidden from the player. Any human player that's on grid sees if the gate activates. Ever since the update where they pointed the stargates towards the stars you now also see if the activation is incoming our outgoing.
---
Lots of content and lots of fighting/ganking. Little groups can now sneak into alliance space and gank really expensive stuff, making for good Reddit stories (outfoxed lol).    
---
Fun time and more changes coming, if you like chaotic play. Hopefully the end of safety in null sec and umbrellas.
---
Oh so that’s what people who use 4chan memes are like.
---
 Do you know what would really solve all these EVE problems? Restore beta version of the game ... No Titans, no warp to zero, automatic scan probe probe, no fozie sov etc etc .... problems solved ...
---
What makes you think I’m biased? 
---
Also I never said you, specifically, were toxic, but the community has become such.
---
&gt; Any human player that's on grid sees if the gate activates
---
Correct, but any bot scout sitting cloaked on a gate can be constantly scraping the logs to keep count of ships entering/exiting through a gate. They aren't just looking at overview to see if something appears, they are scraping the logs to know exactly what ships and entering and when they leave.
---
Careful what you wish for, remember how angry and scared everyone was when PA bought CCP?
---
Did we play on a tribes team back in the day? ign Symtex
---
google translate is not being your friend.
---
youre funny
---
They're already using this..
---
Does warping to a ping on the same grid also cause it?
---
I see you can't read.
---
Horde fleets and is crying about shit pilots lol .. half the fleet is made up of the same guys they fighting lol
---
&gt; CCP really undervalues mobility as part of a ships power
---
This has been obvious for a long time. Just look at how long it took for the Orthrus to get nerfed and how many of the faction ships are just crazy with their mobility.
---
You are forgetting the exploration bots who might still be a thing and daily cleared out entire regions in the north before Blackout.
---
Do people still cloaky camp relics for hours and wait for a potential explorer to land there? This would be so 2010.
---
Faucets/Sinks are more in balance, Rise talked about it on Talking in Stations, and you can see it in the negative isk delta on the last MER.
---
good riddance lol
---
&gt; (by adding nonzero sig to cloaked ships that blooms over time spent cloaked)
---
Can you explain this thought a little? Not like "why" but what do you mean by sig bloom on a cloaked ship?
---
/u/CCP_Falcon Exploit declaration asap?
---
What these numbers means is just that less people logs in. Doesn't mean that less people are in space.
---
I could have 10 accounts logged in all day and do nothing and it would increase the number.
---
Absolutely. Although I do think booshing and fall off mechanics are a somewhat underappreciated solution.
---
Excuse me /u/AneuAng, I am not the OP you originally responded to and was wanting some clarification. 
---
However, I am glad you let me know you are a complete arse. Have a fine day.
---
Yes it does
---
&gt; What makes you think I’m biased?
---
You appear to be blaming the blackout for creating problems and fixing none. Intel in this game was ludicrous, and still is to a certain degree. The systems CCP had in place were super easy to take advantage of to an extent that it was prohibitive to a lot of players. I'm not even talking about just roaming/ganking/Blops. There were many, many times where you could have an alt cloaked in someones staging and an FC would immediately know whether or not they wanted to take a fight. That's still possible, though it requires someone to actively be on staging citadel(s) and quite a few groups have learned to adapt to that, spreading amongst multiple citadels, or hiding ships in another system. Last night, for example, we had a great Loki brawl in Tribute, and I believe it wouldn't have happened if local would have been a thing. I understand people want to farm and make ISK. I personally enjoy moon mining, sitting on comms and shaming the weebs, but I realize that the game was in an entirely unhealthy place. You have a industrial capital ship that can go invincible for a pretty long amount of time, light a cyno and summon tons of shit to kill anything that isn't a n+1 escalation. You could see those guys coming to kill you 10 jumps away. This lead to an insane amount of minerals being dumped on the market to the point where Titans were 1/3rd of the price they were before the Rorqual change. Typically I would be OK with this, because owning something doesn't mean you're good with it, but Cynos still oppressed the shit out of everything. Get tackled while doing something foolish with your Titan/Super? Light a cyno and summon 40 FAX to save you. All around, it was a terrible system that killed the desire for many, many people to play the game. Defending that system has to have a vested interest, because it's definitely not improving the health of the game. Are the changes right now by themselves going to fix the game? Absolutely not. But I'm optimistic, a dangerous thing to be with CCP, that these will bring in further changes. Do I think people who want to rat/mine should constantly be in threat of getting murdered with no recourse? Nope. That's shitty too. The reality is, when CCP creates a middleground (and you would have to be very thick indeed to believe they won't) it will likely be exploited to make things very safe again. However, my hope is that they will make just enough changes before then that more fleet fights will happen, the economy will continute to unfuck itself, and the measure of an alliance won't be how many F1 pushers you can get into Titans.
---
... in the snow.
---
Every constellations had dozens of people waiting for a fight RIGHT before the blackout!
---
No cringe. EVE is real.
---
I claimed sov with my alt alliance for lulz. I haven logged on in 3.5 months and somehow I still own sov. Wtf is going on?
---
If you legitimately think that the reason EVE Online is losing active players is old school WOW, I don't even know what to tell you.
---
First off "always" is incorrect, plenty of ships set up to do PVE but with some tackle have killed ships expecting easy kills. And second off, the pve ship can have friends cloaked on grid with him which the hunters will now be completely unaware of. You don't have to or get to win every fight but if more of you fuckers would at least TRY you'd find that many times you're more dangerous than you think.
---
I quit about 2 years ago but I still want to play eve. It's just that these days I can't convince myself that I'll be around for more than a few days if I resub. I went through that process twice which each stay getting shorter. There isn't anything exciting anymore and I don't think I have the time I used to be able to dedicate.
---
Oddly enough eve was the most fun when I didn't have a RL job
---
Never played wow. Way before my time.
---
Everyone in EVE gets these pings. This post isn't special and neither are you.
---
Can confirm.
---
You still lost the argument
---
Sure! As a way to prevent afk cloaky camping, you could make cloaked ships show a very (unprobe-able) tiny signature when combat probed which could slowly bloom to become probe-able based on time spent cloaked or time without keyboard input (this example is more easily countered with a script). If combined with something like recloak delay increasing proportionally relative to time spent cloaked it would create defensive couterplay to a gameplay style which is extremely oppressive, passive, and risk-averse.
---
I apologise, I am on a phone with a cracked screen which makes following threads somewhat difficult.
---
... naked.
---
How many titans do FRAT have? Well over a hundred I would say. I imagine most individual titan losses will be replaced. I was not saying they were strategic assets in terms of being generally useful, or very rare and powerful. I was talking about any possible titan/super fight. 2 less titans is actually important in such a fight, although not as important when both sides have over 100 titans.
---
I would count a doctrine muninn as a strategic asset. If you need to replace that muninn because you got warped to the little astra that could, you're having a small effect on the war effort.
---
You proved his point.
---
aaah, fair enough
---
But nobody is logging in?
---
People are people too
---
You have a CV backing up your opinions, where is said CV?
---
Visualizing the data like the MER on an actual map is great, thank you.
---
this just in:  PVE in eve is often quite boring.  so boring in fact, you want to semi-afk and chill when doing so.
---
&gt; We have also noticed that its showing a data dump for characters when they log in
---
Like... Anywhere in system?
---
Yup, It shows logins and citadel dockings from anywhere else in system.
---
If you want to write a bot to watch for gate flash, would you try create one that can identify a gate flash, or one that just scrapes logs?
---
Stop reading Reddit bro
---
what you were doing is cancer to this game
---
tl;dr because they didn't want to quit, they wanted the game to be fun again
---
Then they are not countered are they? Losing a couple of ships whilst killing tons others means something is wrong. That the counters are theoretical and not practical. Which means listing them is as useful as saying a counter to stuka fleets is server crash. Sure, but it doesnt happen enough to call it a counter.
---
maybe true, but it looks like he cares much less about eve after PA bough it...
---
Is this a failed or successful drop?
---
I think we're dealing with a false dichotomy here. You hear people saying carebears are bad. And you think carebears are the ones that keep the economy supplied. So you rightly point out that we need carebears.
---
But when they say carebears, they're talking about the people who live by an anti-EVE philosophy which embodies a career of solo grinding and a sense of entitlement to be left alone. These carebears have no loyalty to the game and the bolder one even run bots. 
---
You don't need to be a carebear to do industry. And EVE definitely needs industrialists!
---
Repeat after me: Eve is bigger than the Goons. 
---
Changes is afoot that are bringing incredible changes to the game. And there is concern all around that much of the change is bad. 
---
Could you please take the pants off of your head and try to see this.
---
I voted with my wallet.  Up to CCP if they want to go all-in on change.
---
as I ... what?
---
Waiting with bated breath.
---
I agree with all of your points. I want more fights, I simply don’t see blackout creating them and that is backed up with facts in the top thread on this sub right now with regards to stats on ships lost. 
---
CCP has a lot to fix to unfuck this game, blackout will make those fixes harder, as will the cyno changes that stop cap escalations. 
---
I guess we will see.
---
Found the botter
---
I work from home... No pants ever!
---
Shit you got me!
---
I'd be down!
---
Lol what a suggestion. Dude youre drunk. I have fking been in those fleets where weve wiped out entire subcap response fleets, everyone of those FCs were retards according to you. Youre fking funny dude.
---
&gt; This all happened very quickly, from the time he appeared on my overview, less than 3 seconds later I was killed
---
It took longer than that. Either the Loki wasn't cloaked and he was on your overview for several seconds landing from warp, then had to spend 2+ seconds targeting you before he could blap... or he was cloaked until he was out of warp and had a 5-ish second delay after decloaking before he could target and blap.
---
Or lag I guess. But yeah, shit can happen really fast.
---
Easy come easy go though. You made half what you lost in a couple hours, lost your bil through some mistakes on your end. You can earn it back and do better avoiding the mistakes next time.
---
shit happens. friend lost like  400mil   to enyo that got his astero in covert site,they both died.
---
i live long enough to see querns and marinatedfoodwhatever not be in the top 4 koolaid dispensers
---
Is there any data shown on logoff aswell?
---
&gt; CCP has a lot to fix to unfuck this game, blackout will make those fixes harder, as will the cyno changes that stop cap escalations.
---
How will that stop cap escalations though? Anyone that needs to use capitals in a fight will have a recon for it, and the other side should likely have one as well. If anything, this fix prevents random roaming gangs from encountering titans/supers every time they undock, but shouldn't affect the actual fleetwarfare at all. While I think the decision was pretty strange to include Black Ops hulls, and feel like a different hull or alternate fix could have been implemented, I think it's at least a step in a better direction.
---
This guy oh my gosh I'm so glad he ended up in a frat renter alliance. We kicked him from our alliance, he tries to go to darkness, who then kick him also. apparently ends up in frat and thankfully featuring prominently in this post. We kicked him because he was creepy, darkness kicked him because he was admitting to RMT'ing + creepy. Frat, of course cares about neither of these things. he still tries to stalk me to this day... lol
---
Ye I was one a fleet one time an this thing happened. Scary stuff dude, you suck fyi. Thats your entire response.
---
This is the bitch moves that PvPers like to pull. You bitch and nag but when something is broken on your part its always the same response. Which is why nobody outside of your group and CCP likes you. And why no balance issues should ever be dictated by you.
---
How detailed is the location? Could you use it to find somebody's safe?
---
We get it, you vape
---
Well I can defend myself here by saying I did everything perfectly. Although It was 2AM and I had 5 hours of sleep last night and I had been exploring for 2 hours prior to that - I saw him appear on overview as he did and immediately I pressed warped out, Yes 5ish seconds is correct but that's just insane, I didn't know he would delete me so quickly. I meant 3 seconds from when he came close to me.
---
tfw you recruit like goons, but you don't have the critical mass where numbers&gt;retard factor
---
In the past month or so, I've had my corpmates tell me on two occasions they could see my ship's velocity and distance in AU from them on their overview, despite using a Cov Ops Cloak.  It's definitely an active bug.
---
only when your mum has been busy.
---
the vocal whining shitlords native to this shithole.
---
Lol, well good on you guys for continuing to have fun and enjoying the game instead of complaining.
---
That sucks but mine is more retarded since when I created my clones today I named this one TRAINING CLONE so I wouldn't take it out by mistake. Fast forward a few hours and boom - 1.06 bill gone. Considering I have 1 Bil in wallet and another 1 in loot that was literally 30% of my wealth + now I have to travel to D-P again to get new implants and a new astero with new fitting and just the thought of how much time I spent and how I just could've gone to sleep a few hours ago gets me SUPER anxious.
---
I agree with caps dropping on everything, however, the problem with the changes is that the first side to get caps on grid effectively wins because the other side will not want to risk a partial drop, leaving their caps split. Recons simply don’t have the staying power to be able to last more than a few seconds before being alpha’d off the grid. Multiple recons will make it just as tricky since the caps need to cycle hit jump resulting in session change issues and once again a risk of a partial escalation meaning escalation is an even bigger risk than they already were. It’s a terrible change.
