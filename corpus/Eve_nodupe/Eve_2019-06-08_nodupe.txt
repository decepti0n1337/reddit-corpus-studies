Thank you Code for not shooting my Venture in Gallente space.  My Venture was empty anyways. lol  People in this game are nicer than people in other games.  I've been in some PvE games that had rude people in local chat.  I'm glad I found Eve online.  Later

I didn't want that Tengu anyway...

The game just ate my scan probes and my astero was warping backwards to a citadel. Brain fell out of the box.

this is normal, just play like normal u pussies smh

Connection Timeout - The server failed to acknowledge the client's response to the server's challenge within a reasonable amount of time

Same for me and my corpmates, nothing working lol,

I am in no block, I live and PvP out of a c4 wh. My corp and I are independent.

confirming chat worked flawlessly as i perma warped with cyno activated
---
Yes
---
Sisi still up though
---
Servers been down 5 mins, you expect someone to know that already, it’ll be at least half an hour before CCP employees get a discord ping and can drag themselves away from harvesting Narwal blubber, or tear themselves away from clubbing a baby seal, wash the blood off, and figure out the hamster situation.

This is such a garbage post I hope the 5 people voting for you change their mind
---
Your summary of yourself makes you look like another worthless lowsec/troll candidate, do you have any valuable experience or opinions? I know that understanding the game isn't a requirement on the csm but jeez
---
&gt;Has overall good recognition from the WH community and outside from it (=&gt; most likely WH candidate to be elected, #1 Praise Bob gallot vote)
---
A large of the wh community dislikes him. In order to get votes on praise bob, he wound up having to bring his own corp in to vote for him. 
---
The *real* praise bob ballet was going to be Loroseco and Mort, however loro dropped out as ccp is incompetent, and Mort get fucked with technical issues and ccp told him to pound sand.
---
Exooki, even after bringing his corp into the server to vote for him (and then never do anything again), did not get as many votes as loro got, even months later.
---
His corp is also known to be very bear-ish - and his ideas for wspace are never good. Like his encouragement of static farming, and then the mad push for bear holes a year after everyone else. Or higgs yachts, and how he believed they were balanced and cried when someone used higgs yachts to annoy him. 
---
Outside the wh community, again, many people don't like him. :shrug:
---
Was just freaking out... Glad this post will always be here when in doubt.
---
Somebody forgot the feed the hamsters. Don't worry, CCP will get somebody out of bed to resuscitate them.

Thank you so much for the constructive comment, sir. I think my idea for structures will work for timezone tanking since if the structure is low power it can just die immediately regardless of the timezone. Another option that would give people the ability to defend even low power structures would be to allow low power structures' hull timer to come out precisely 24 hours after it is initially reinforced. This gives the attacker the ability to dictate when the next timer is.
---
In addition, another cool change would be to give whoever controls the TCU of a system the ability to set a blanket timer for all the structures in the system. This gives importance to a sovereignty mechanic that otherwise is largely ignored.
---
I guess the Triglavians won.
---
The devs i spoke to at Eve Down Under beg to differ
---
Pretty sure Snuff has a Keepstar somewhere................... Shadow Cartel all overagain

Again, that's the thing. What draw is there for anyone who's not a 10 year old veteran or expert? I've been playing on and off for 4 years now, and I like neither large corp PvP nor PVE. Yet I'm not a noob who wants to do L2 missions for life, nor do I have the skills, knowledge, time to invest, or SP to do what your last point suggests.

I'm glad that it's not quite dead. But it's near there it seems.

I did the small alliance thing which was fun but i made no isk. Then I joined goons. You can take the big boy ships out and make a ton of money with the super cap umbrella watching over you. At the moment we are north at work is isk making in our own region isnt really a thing (unless you are thick). so if you want loads of pvp join us now. if you arent ready for that chill and wait a couple of months and join us when we decide to go home!. My best choice in eve was to join goons!

If you are a role player, you probably know which race to pick.

Laughter.  I knew how the angry incels would respond, and the amount of salt I've collected already could turn the great lakes into the dead sea.  Well adjusted people with normal lives dont get angry over people calling a shitty event shitty.  Having more fun here than in eve.

may you please build a titan for me if I pay you 10 isk?

Can i be a mod of this sub now that the game is dead?
---
So not true. CCP must have made it so that EVE would keep growing forever (or at least for a looooooooong time), and they knew that 5000 titans was not the world's largest number; we would reach it in not that long.
---
and its back
---
Dicky Needles to you too you fine sir.

if it takes you 5 minutes to use Lightshot, nevermind, there's no fucking hope for you

They really do that? Really impressive guys!

thanks for the wonderful insight.  changed my entire perspective
---
Im in the same boat :D, been playing since 2010 and I only just got my first titan last month!
---
probably why it was named that way
---
The day "Tranquility" ends and chaos floods the world

Wow I get it's not good but like life dont like then shut up and move on no one wants to hear yall cry about it fix it yourself

how thr fuck

And nothing of value was lost.
---
TC KL is still open :)
---
damnit, take my upvote you animal
---
this is the CCP equivalent to Leg Meta
---
Yes servers just died!
---
There's a new one of these threads every couple days, the answer is yes, it will always be yes. EVE is a game like no other. But most importantly find a community of players to enjoy with, it is a very social video game.
---
Seeing how well CCP does implementation, we are probably still going to be doing so. Mostly so our clients dont crash from the horrifyingly crappy render of the rat ship and the nonresizeable window that it will be brought up in. 
---
Probably going to be the window we have to target too so good luck having more then one target at a time.
---
do we count that as a titan kill? can we conditionally claim snuffed out as imperium pets?
---
Ok mr smartypants.  What the fuck does confidence have to do with daily log in rewards?  You telling me it takes confidence to login to a character select screen.  Damn you must be pathetic.    
---
Uhh, my ONE ACCOUNT can fly both....  not sure what you're so proud of.  Makes friends and fly with them.  Stop masturbating in space.   
---
Or better yet, log off and go fuck something.  Or if you cant get laid, just go fuck yourself.
---
The UI draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature...
---
Literally like the only thing to do was missions it was really dull. It’s better now everyone is just older and it’s not magical anymore
---
Just missed out. Really a photo finish.
---
That never happened. Everybody assembled for fun and family friendly activities then went home safe. Trust the Chinese government.
---
But most vets are missing the big picture that the game needs to change to get the next generation of capsules into space. A new player does not care about fax reps or battleship damage. And yes the newbie things were not important when everyone playing was a newbie but they are now that the game is full of people that have been playing for 10 years
---
Oh you've seen the actual numbers have you?  Why dont you share them with the rest of the class.   
---
Oh wait, you cant, because you're talking out of your ass.    
---
I never said it was only 5%.  Just that 5% was enough to be statistically significant.   What's it like to be so confident and yet so stupid?
---

A small quality of life improvement, Nice
---
Turns out the server was down, as can be see on the @eve_status twitter account. Back up now. So all’s well!
---
Yeah you can add in a fake citadel (It wont take into account assets/jobs if you do). Just manually add one into the Structure Database and give it a random number for its ID.
---
Like: 1 - (System Name - Test Citadel) - Raitaru - Null Sec - Rig 1 Name - Rig 1 ID - Rig 2 Name - Rig 2 ID - Rig 3 Name - (Rig 3 ID/"No Rig") - Station Tax (You don't really need the rig names there just the IDs)
---
Out of keepstars. Give us a couple year.
---
There is an pinned message on the discord on how to set it up.
---
Here it is anyway
---
1. Auth all characters you want to use with GESI.
---
2. Go to the page "Character/Assest Settings" and click the giant ass tick (This will build all the GESI Functions needed for all your Authed Characters)
---
3. While also on that page set which characters Assets and Jobs you want to use (With a 'y') and set Corp Pull Character (If using Corp stuff). Also setting which group you want to use Assets/Jobs from Characters, Corp, Both(For Both Character and Corp), and Neither (You can set it to this at any point if you want to just see the overall total of the builds).
---
4. The long fun part. Go to the page "Structure Database" and start adding in all the structures you use for Indy Stuff. When the Checker cell turns Green you can click the top tick to add that structure to the Database.
---
Note: NOTHING on this sheet will work if there are no structures added here.
---
5. Once all structures are added head to "Built Components" and assign all the component groups to the structure you will build said components in.
---
6. Finally you can go to the "Build List Frontend" and start adding Indy Jobs
---
6.5 - If you plan to do all the reactions for T2 builds then go to "Reactions Frontend" and set the 'Do your Own Reactions?' to 'yes'
---
WE ARE FREE!!!!
---
She’s dead Jack...
---
&gt; Wanting to start Eve. Is it too late?
---
Yes.
---
Yes. The servers are dead!
---
Just kidding. With Alpha clones, injectors and skill learning at the fastest it's ever been, it's easier than ever to get flying something you like. Try it, pvp someone, enjoy!
---
that's true, but sometimes you need that extra DPS. I was gonna explore cruises soon
---
Moarrr!
---
I started a little over a year ago and am loving it. The game is 16 years old now, so it’s not like much has changed as far as the new player experience goes except for a bunch of quality of life improvements
---
Absolutely not. You can get started pretty easy and it's absolutely possible to have fun even with low skills. I would strongly suggest joining a corp to get started and learn about the game. If you're settled in and learned what you wanna do there are Skill Injectors that help catch up with skillpoints. Do not rush on Injecting though. The experience and knowledge about what you're flying and doing is a big part of eve that takes time to learn.
---
RIP 300 millons
---
Man I want to come back to EvE I resubbed with some PLEX and I got back into Horde and moved to the new spot and was gonna do some shit but sitting on comms for hours waiting for shit to happen?  That's what's killing EvE. I dunno. I just can't get out there in that Astero anymore.
---
Yea they really should just make a master reasons to join eve thread and sticky it somewhere. Save everyone the time lol.
---
whilst it's sad that it's making the game easier, it's also making it a lot less obnoxious. This is a win IMO since now you don't have to find some data scraper
---
so it turns out when the SQL engine decides to read 200 million rows for every single instance of a proc that runs hundreds of times per second, things can go bad quickly!
---
Yes REEE
---
Don't miss playing Eve Online.  It's like not going to a concert because the band is old, you'll regret it when it's dead.
---
Just like poor little Bobby Tables.
---
61, huh. Just one off. =\]
---
If I ever wanted to be in the Horde, I'd resub to WoW.
---
You need to repair then repackage modules before you can sell them.
---
Launcher says 12,000 in game.
---
It's nice knowing theres others like me. I started in 2005 at the age of 14. I just recently bought myself an erebus and sitting at 260million skillpoints. Feel like I finally won eve
---
Great got it thanks. And is it the same for ships?
---
Sea of thieves is pretty fun gais
---
&gt;Remember, an atron costs less than 5M
---
Blasters are the most expensive T1 thing that you use besides rigs. Rigs are roughly half of that, three turrets are the rest.
---
When you right click the module, there's an option to repackage it. You need to do that first and only then you'll be able to sell it.
---
When you eventually end up selling your cormorant, you'll need to do the same. 
---
Only assembled ships and modules can be used and only packaged modules and ships can be sold on the market. Assembled ships and modules cannot be stacked, while packaged ones can.
---
The nerf was to their tank. You won’t be saved as easily anymore even under an umbrella
---
Pardon my ignorance, but what do you mean the servers “just died”?
---
How does the "Immediate" option work when putting it up for sale? Every time I try to sell imitate it turns red and says I can't. Also should I discount them if I want them to sell ASAP? I put mine up for 30% under market av. Is there even demand for noob items like this? I put 8 up for sale at that price.
---
Ah sorry about that. I scrolled around but could find one. Appreciate the answer.
---
Well, r/eve seems to be working fine... we'll survive, most people play the game here anyway.
---
You can only sell something immediately if another person has placed a buy order for it within range of where you are, and then only for the price that buy order is offering.
---
The servers went offline for a bit, unplanned. Probably a crash. The game definitely is still otherwise alive and well, and a server outage like this is rare
---
One does not simply avoid Uedama. 
---
Instead, become one with Uedama and move like the gankers do.
---
Easiest way to tell if a kill matters is look at the rigs. If the rigs are large, it's a super from when supers actually mattered. Every capital rigged titan might as well be a battleship, and every capital rigged super is effectively a cruiser in today's eve. Helps keep things simple.  
---
  
---
Respects to the lost Large rigged nyx; another remnant of Eve when it mattered, gone. :(
---
Join a different corp. Joining those large blobby groups is boring as fuck (my opinion of course). Much prefer something small with a group.
---
I started in a large alliance. We grew fed up of space dictators, annoying rules, high taxes, etc. We made our own corp, and I've been flying in small gang since then. That was over 8 years ago. I've tried the large groups in the past (mostly Black Legion) and each time I was bored again within a week.
---
LLOOOLLLL eve while DRUNK bro its so EPIC hahahahahaha
---
The immediate option only works if there's someone offering to buy that item. It's unlikely that there is such a person in Akiainavas, but if you went to Jita instead, plenty of people will buy it from you immediately. Do note that the sale price is always lower if you sell immediately than what you could get if you would list it on the market for a longer time.
---
I already read the rest of your comments so this one is entirely unnecessary. You don’t need to respond to every post laughing about being such a big brain intellectual who outsmarted all Le dumb people.I baited you into raging about everyone being an incel and collecting dank salt. You have provided me laughter.Having more fun then in eve.
---
Starbound here I come... again

No leg strat &gt; leg strat.
---
thank you to everyone at ccp for making this game possible, you guys over there have created this enormous community possible. thank you.
---
Wait there’s a game behind the subreddit?  I thought you we were all role playing?
---
Sniffed Out spais need to be better ;-)

Please tell me an unintended but irreversible side effect was the deletion of all sov nullsec space....

Iirc the devs lent a hand there
---
It is never too late to get started in EVE. Even though veteran players may have a lot more ability and knowledge, with the right training, you can compete with them in some areas. they will have a head start on you, sure, but there are still dozens of newbies each day.
---
How many times had EvE died now?
---
Snuff needs better spais :-)
---
My corp discord is trying to make mention of either game a bannable offense. Half our guys get angry about Factorio, the other half get angry about Minecraft; except that our logi lead plays Factorio and our lead FC plays Minecraft and our CEO plays both
---
Yet another few reasons why I'm applying to WiNGSPAN when I get enough SP.
---
I know its impossible to know for sure but what is the likelihood of my 150mm rail guns that I put up for well under market being sold in the next few days? In general, if you list things less than market price, even if they are noob level items, do they sell? Also what is in Jita that makes it different? Any specific station?
---
He is not running this go around.
---
haha, perfect storm!

We're gonna need  bigger ships.

EVE 2 Hype when?
---
Wait what? I was just getting into eve... or is this a whoosh
---
It was literally not the only thing lol. The only missions I’ve ever done have been some burners right before I burned out on the game.
---
He needs to prove it with ESI that all accounts were drained of SP and assets
---
Right click, view market details.  Sort sell orders by lowest first and buy orders by highest first.
---
The closer you are to the buy price, the faster it will sell, but the more likely it is you're being ripped off.
---
Jita is the main trade hub - so everything sells faster there.  Planet 4 Moon 4 Caldari Navy station.
---
Awesome thank you. you have been super helpful!
---
Exactly

I'll be honest, sounds good to join but I've no idea how I'll know if I'm ready
---
Look up "EVE L4 Burner Blitzing" on google.
---
As for regular L4s, Machariel or Barghest.
---
Tbh you're ready now. The sooner you make the jump the better. However getting your primary skills to V first is a solid idea.

As a cloaky camper you can look at someones zkillboard for their fitting, identify their weapons visually if you are on grid with them, you can d-scan to see who is around you, you can check for activity in nearby systems via the map and do it all from the safety of being cloaked and if you are unsure about the fight you are about to get in then you can choose to not decloak.
---
Again, unless you are dumb and cant pick your fights the only real risk you are taking as a cloaky camper is being shot by someone you didnt see coming such as a defence fleet.
---
Congrats! That’s a lot of skill points! Enjoy the Erebus and fly safe
---
People are gonna tell you 'it's never too late', 'no better time than now' and similar. The truth is, it depends on your expectations and accepting that EVE is past its prime. If you are expecting to play at a similar level to older players within a reasonable time then chances are, you will be highly disappointed. If that's not a problem for you, then you should give it a try.
---
Tldr: Game has seen better days but is still plenty playable.

For a start ignore anyone who tells you it is too late, thats a load of horseshit.
---
You can get into game today and start having fun. Eve is very much what you make of it. Get into game, find some people to fly with and start having fun.
---
Oof
---
You can learn to do plenty of shit in the meantime. Swing me your Eve name and I'll send a msg to you and my CEO.

I \*also\* never said it was only 5%. Irony is being rude about someone else's reading comprehension while not reading the post you're mocking properly.

Man i wish. Eve 2 when

We’ll be waiting :D

what about the shit posting "conditions"
---
Whoosh
---
&gt;mindless drone
---
Drone, as in male bee? Actually, that sounds like a pretty good description of most people in one alliance in particular.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Most missile boats are kinetic locked, and other weapon systems that aren't projectiles don't do explosive damage. The main source of explosive damage is gated behind a line of piss poor projectile weapons.
---
There are few good options for straight up explosive damage.
---
Confidence is very important, visualize, and carry through.
---
Also, if someone made a Thorax dildo in silicone I would totally go fuck myself with it.
---
I can't say I've ever struggled to find information on eve mechanics etc. As has been pointed out many times... googling shit isn't hard.
---
You don't consider Venture to be a PVP ship?
---
Golem is really only gank bait if you use a stupid fit.  Normal T2 fit gets ignored and works fine.
---
No worries, I hope to see you in space among us and causing some explosions! :)
---
What is this? A Gurrenn Lagan reference?
---
Ok bud
---
I started around two months ago now. Sure, it'll take time to train up to tech II and III ships, but you'll get far enough that you can adequately fly a tech I cruiser pretty quickly. And often, that's what is required. And if your skill plan isn't going to allow you to fly a tackle frigate adequately within a reasonable amount of time, your skill plan has gone horribly wrong.
---
so how does this work?
---
You might want to use this site: https://evemarketer.com
---
It can tell you if it's worth hiring a hauler to bring things to Jita (in the Forge region).
---
You can be ganked in any sec status.  In 0.5 or above, Concord will destroy the person who ganked you.
---
Best part about that was it was sold to a goon which actually just funneled it out of goons into other alliances for a slight markup.
---

---
Cool thanks, I will check it out. Another unrelated question: I am running the Career agent missions for the Military agent and whenever I'm targeting a ship in a mission it says it has a bounty on it (4,000ISK for example). Are these bounties what becomes the mission payout or are they something I have to cash in separately?
---
Cmon ima goon and I wouldnt say that
---
What I love here the Corp got the boot but the guy was so stupid it just screamed bait and no one took it lol

What's nice is that unlike a FW beacon you can both warp to range and bookmarks.

It's the only reason i can imagine there being interbus pocos anywhere in hisec at this point. And i saw one i think 2 weeks ago.

Yeah, ever since I learned how a friend got caught by Pornmaker, I've been doing that and never really needed it until today.
---
I always keep my cyno at the last mid logged on precisely for an escape. Better to tread ground again than lose the entire thing.
---
undervalued understatement
---
Look into Thera and EvEScout, this way you can have easy access to various wormholes, Null-sec, and Low-sec connections that change on at least a daily basis. I would suggest an Astero if you just want to do Pirate Data and Relic sites. Covert Ops ships work as well, the increased warp speed is nice, but if you get caught, you are mostly defenseless. If you want to do combat exploration, you can also do a decent few sites with an Astero, but I like doing them in a Jackdaw myself. If you want to go bigger, things start to get a lot slower and a lot more tedious if you ask me.
---
I did search before posting, but most of the info I found was from 2016 or older. No significant changes since then?
---
Hm of these ships are close to entry lvl in skills?
---
I am a known hater of JF gankers that don't contribute to alliance at all. Nice try though.
---
Was that before or after Elo quit again?
---
He didn't drop, he was kicked for losing the super n dread
---
Nope. Burners have more or less stayed the same, too.
---
Let the battle of the tin foil hats commence.
---
Astero is the most entry level of the good exploration ships, the covert ops ships you need at least "Race Frigate" V to fly any of them, as well as some levels in Covert Ops and something else to get good effect.
---
So I would say looking into an Astero.
---
Now, it's not the biggest, or the most scary, but if you're just looking for style points here's a contender: https://eve-files.com/media/corp/iSnowman/rainbow.jpg
---
All industry functions of POSes have been removed, at this point. Sorry.
---
They also increased the size of the Excavator drones, so 5 of them no longer fit in a Wetu mobile depot (stuffing your drones into a Wetu is a standard tactic to keep from losing them if you get jumped).
---
All on top of multiple nerfs to yield since the Excavators were first introduced.
---
IMO, "high volume mining" is more cost effective these days with a bunch of Hulks and an Orca, even after accounting for ganking losses and the cost of multiple Omega accounts.
---
Nope. If you want someone to guide you through the tutorial and to answer any question you might have don't hesitate to ask. I like helping more than actually playing the game nowadays, so let me know if you want a buddy to fly with for a few hours.
---
We have to take care of the newbros if we want the game to keep going after all.
---
I cannot speak to the Kindle version (though it appears to contain the artwork, as well), but the coffee table book hardcover version is one of the best things I’ve ever blown $60 on.
---
The stories are excellent, despite their simplified nature. And the accompanying art work just made me love the game even more.
---
That boi dies so fast lmao
---
friendship ended with :krab: :ccp: :condi:, now Pepega is my friend

Well, drone boats aren't damage locked, and the missile ships that aren't kin locked can use Nova missiles perfectly fine... of course, this leaves a lot of ships out, but it's not like there isn't any (and drones and missiles are a favourite for PVE).
---
Yes that's the triglavina's alt. :)

If you're just starting, use your racial exploration frig until you get the hang of things.

*Insert whatever mid slot increases scan strength

Nanofiber Structure

That's pretty basic fit. I wouldnt jump into an Astero, or T2 exploration frig until you feel comfortable scanning sites down in a WH while spamming dscan, but that's the advice I give all new people to exploration.
---
Before, it was K3JR in Venal probably around 2012ish.
---
but where do i go to find it? all i can find are empty plexes...
---
dude reporting in.
---
what's for dinner ?
---
It's just a resist profile man. You really think, from a *play*er perspective, the most fun, engaging way to find out rat resist profiles is to shoot different types of missiles into their shields, armor, and then structure, then check your combat log to compare the damage of each to your raw damage with skills and ship bonuses and finally do some quick maths to figure out the profile?
---
Before that people used external resources like u/Plebius-Maximus said.
---
&gt;invasions
---
&gt;using drones
---
you do know that drones get damage and ehp nerfs, right?
---
Yup. Sansha's Nation's attacks haven't actually ICly been fully revealed. Currently it's just increased pirate activity under the code name Case Green Magic. CONCORD formed AEGIS originally to increase ship security, provide sensor nets and fast response for ships under attack. But AEGIS has been getting a bit of mission creep. Likely to account for the slight and subtle shifts in Nova's background development.
---
Last time they talked about Nova weapons they showed a bunch of art assets talking about possible Upwell weapon designs. This news article ties in to that perfectly, even months later, showing they are still on track with what they said before they just are being quiet about it to not ramp up the hype train.
---
you really think the game is more engaging when you remove problem solving from it?
---
i don't.
---
You can log out. You can turn off your PC. You can even walk away. But you will never be free!
---
It's not making the game easier. People that run missions in shit fit ships that don't know what resist profiles are don't look them up already. If the profiles are available on a show info tab, those same people are still going to run shit fits and shoot the wrong damage type.
---
Data scrapers? You just google 'eve online [rat faction] resists'. Or put it in Pyfa. No new player is 'discovering' resist holes. You could be taught the mechanic that a rat's damage type matches is resist profile (Shoots EM/Therm, strong tank against EM/Therm, so shoot Exp/Kin) and get by fine without knowing the specific percentage resists. But (effectively) no one is combing through their combat logs to figure this shit out.
---
Rats are always rats and their resist are always the same. Even against players, with enough experience you can reasonably guess what resist hole you should shoot into based on the hull they're flying. If you have selectable damage, select the right ammo, or if you don't have selectable damage decide not to engage if you've got something like lasers and shoot into a strong EM/Therm T2 profile. (I'm not good at this at all.)
---
What I'm trying to say is, don't even be a little bit sad about it.
---
I went to Albion, and the community seems saltier, like in Eve logi is great but in Albion if someone dies the healer gets complaints like crazy
---
Which ones seem to work best? I've seen the fake gambling one but what else?
---
I read that as procurer and was jealous of that cycle/delivery time!
---
I'm going to go undock some pew pew when I get home instead of mine...
---
I can’t even log in sober.
---
Yeah, I think solving the problem (that's already been solved) of figuring out rat resist profiles on your own with the tools available (missiles and combat logs and math) is fucking terrible. It's not fun or engaging.
---
It's also like the most minor thing. Problem solving isn't being removed from the game. Shit that's easily google-able is being put in the show info tab.
---
If you want it to be *engaging* from a *gameplay* perspective, provide better tools. Like some kind of ship scanner to determine resists. Maybe you have to disable but not destroy the rat or some shit. But that's not fun either.
---
So, no. Removing problem solving doesn't make the game more engaging. That's not what this is, tho.
---
&gt; figuring out rat resist profiles on your own with the tools available (missiles and combat logs and math) is fucking terrible.
---
then don't be dumb about it? literally every rat is weak to the exact same type of damage it deals. 
---
&gt;Removing problem solving doesn't make the game more engaging.
---
nor does wasting dev time adding something that you can google in literally 2 seconds, as we've all been doing for over a decade and a half.
---
Somehow I think there are more than 5k titans
---
Shocking to think that that show came out over a decade ago now.
---
&gt; literally every rat is weak to the exact same type of damage it deals.
---
How would a new player know that without being told or figuring it out by trial and error?
---
&gt;wasting dev time

What else would Karkur be doing other than the thing that she does? Did you whine about info cards being added? It's a simple quality of life improvement. Just let your life be improved, man.

Please do not use these ships as someone just starting exploration. They are very expensive for a new player and unless you can use a covert ops cloak they don’t offer any significant bonus. Use a racial exploration frig e.g an imicus with a regular prototype cloak until you can use covops cloaks. This will allow you to explode as you learn with only a minor ISK loss
---
Those drifter seeker drones were doing similar things, like, 4 years ago? And what had CCP done afterwards? They introduced entosis link and fozzie sov
---
So one thing is for sure, they aren't going to be what you think they could be

Back in the day there was no ingame web brower. We went the full circle.

Ya back then it was all so new I think lots of players started and just got board of doing hauling missions cause it was kid of hard to find anything to do. I remover I played for a month and thought the only thing to do was belt rat and mine
---
&gt; What else would Karkur be doing other than the thing that she does?
---
are you seriously telling me there are no other QoL improvements you'd like to see rather than this?
---
Are your 13 and a half now?
---
Just fit the cheep exploration frig and do high sec till you get enough isk for a fit astero then never look back
---
You are going to get him killed lol
---
Not true the hack strength is worth it.
---
&gt; are you seriously telling me...
---
Nope. Not saying that. Never said that. But I'm comfortable saying this change wasn't developed at the expense of something else.
---
Yep the astero seems spendy at first but it allows you to be better at the mini game so it pays for itself fast
---
I love the magnet
---
Just start with the thought that this game is a long term investment and even when your not playing you are getting better. When you get board log out or do something else in game. Find a way to make isk and take it easy and do t feel like you need the next biggest ship.
---
I brought that up at some point. However given that they're already decided that I've lost my mind, they don't want to get too close to it.
---
Although as long as we're on the topic, there's also  [https://github.com/Rahjital/XenoIndustry](https://github.com/Rahjital/XenoIndustry), which adds the further crossover between Factorio and Kerbal Space Program
---
As a new player the price of the asteroid hull isn’t cheap. Then you need skills for it too, to get your money’s worth out of an astero you need good frog skills in 2 factions frigs. In a racial frigate you can get excellent scanning bonuses by training a single racial frig skill. So the only bonus is really a +5 to your relic and data virus strength compared to a racial frig. 
---
Someone learning explo is likely to lose a few ships before they learn to avoid camps and keep an eye on D-scan. For a negligible increase in virus strength it’s really not worth the extreme increase in ISK required to start explo in an astero as a new player. Racial frogs exist for a good reason, they are cheap and effective at their role
---
FC, what is opportunity cost?
---
Yeah I just started playing after avoiding it for years and years and I just saw the game play Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 which looks amazing but I was a little disappointed that there's only one system it seems. Thanks Eve..
---
Imagine kicking someone from Horde for losing something lmao
---
He said he had a decent amount of isk, so to me that sounds like he can afford one, but I guess decent is a very subjective term.
---
Are these changes on TQ yet?  I swear i just camped some guy doing a tier 5 and he didn't come out suspect.
---
Victory for Sylvannas.
---
Naw if he gets into a regular expo frig and starts the training and does data sites in high sec he will be into an Astero in a week and can continue to do high sec until he is ready to head to a hole. If you use safe spots and know how to hit Dscan it’s pretty safe.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/3019585/ his killboard is probably better than yours!
---
EM is weaker than thermal
---
Selama ashal'anore.
---
Nah, you're not alone.  There's a coupla dozen lolplayers in Eve.
---
lmao titans are gay
---
Yes but now you’ve already agreed he should start in a regular racial frig until he is ready, which is pretty much exactly what I said. Use the racial frigate until you have the skills to fly and use a covops cloak. Also highsec data sites? He may as well uninstall now. Highsec sites will give him no experience in avoiding null-sec gate camps or people scanning him for pvp. Taking the same racial frigate you’ve just admitted he should start in and going to null-sec gives him the chance to actually learn how to survive while scanning
---
lmao. imagine not agreeing to a 1vs1 at top belt with a dictor. noballs
---
i'm in 2 minds.
---
it was useless and a waste of time. however, it might actually be nice for new players. when you play an MMO you kinda expect to have a 'character' and walk around and do stuff. it must be kinda jarring for new players coming from games where you're spending 90% of the time looking at the back of your character's head, to never seeing a character at all.
---
Looking for trouble in SoT is a pretty damn good evening.
---
Well he has to start someplace isk don’t grow on trees. In my exp you lose to many cans as a new pilot learning how to hack so the astero really helps with that. Hi sec data site pay good to save for the astero. That is all and it’s a safe way to learn the basics
---
You re shit. astero is best.
---
Oh well you’re going way way back. The game definitely improved for a long while. Then around the start of skill injectors has taken some steps backwards as well.
---
You advocated for starting in an astero a few comments ago and now claim that ISK doesn’t grow in trees.... anyway I think we won’t see eye-to-eye on this. Ultimately both options are viable, I just don’t see the increased cost of the astero being a good idea for someone starting out, but I’m sure you have your reasons for disagreeing. Let’s agree to disagree here.
---
Yup. Just put in 3 locators, first one hit in a few hours. Very stealthy and quick :)
---
can confirm. this stuff will start anything, including your bbq.
---
I like the astero and fly it. Nothing against it at all, it’s a beautiful ship. Just don’t think the price is a good idea for a new player.
---
No I did not I just said if you have the money the hack strength of the astero is worth while for a newbie it will help I know cause I have trained multiple newbs on exact same path.
---
I just said that the hack strength is worth getting the astero for. It’s up to him to learn how to be safe in it
---
Please kill this game already. Thank you.
---
I was going to no fuck no bringing it back. But you have a valid point. Eve is the only mmo I have ever played though, so I dunno.
---
If you have to ask this question then Eve is probably not the game you should be playing.
---
Also, contact me in-game.
---
I have seen that as well, it is somewhat impressive.
---
It was a pretty nice addition that helped spruce up the game. I loved being able to look at my ship from a human scale, gave it a sense of perspective. I'd love to see it be brought back with maybe a VR option just for that area so you can really appreciate the scale of EVE.
---
Oh my god if they just add entosising to player structures without changing anything else it's going to be frustrating as all hell.
---
I think eve is the only MMO or RPG i've played where i'm not controlling a character, i think.
---
I can't think of any others that I've played that don't have you playing from a 1st or 3rd person perspective of an actual 'person'. i'm sure there are some, but they definitely aren't the norm.
---
+1 dis^
---
You will get the money directly in your wallet every \~20 minutes
---
Great. Thanks again.
---
I am impressed with your achievement of your EVE dream of flying a Titan. I personally just subscribed a week ago, and I'm looking to stick it out for the long haul. Although becoming a Titan pilot is not **my** endgame, I'm sure it is for others.
---
260m SP certainly shows the age of your character. I'm sure you've seen or participated in many events in the history of Eve.
---
ggwp i guess
---
i can haz lazer?
---
Only if they complete the WIS or let other people come into your quarters or you to go theirs. The big thing for me is we get all these cool clothing items and the only way to ever see them is if you view a character otherwise whats the point of that stuff.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I disagree with the second part though. We see posts about making this game more accessible for new players, but then remove basic game mechanics. Any experienced player knows to Google resist holes, but why put a player through days of frustration just to risk losing another customer.
---
For me, it was an annoyance and felt very unpolished as the real sandbox experience comes from player interaction, not popping NPC's for starter isk.
---
You can play in Alpha state for free, so there's no risk to trying it out. If you want, I can send you a link that will let you start ahead of the curve.
---
\&gt;J4G posting about his corp's super/titan fleet
---
Jesus christ you people are pathetic
---
Heron, then Helios. Astero is a cake. ~~And cake is a lie.~~
---
Heron can align in 3 seconds (given correct fit, nano and inertia stuffs) while also fitting a burst ECM that effectively break lock on small ship that is able to lock you fast. Just remember to overheat the ECM whenever you jump to a new system. Other racial ones are not bad but magnate suck for the fact that it cannot even fit a cargo scanner (unless you're gonna fit those stupidly expensive integrated analyzer). 
---
Helios, just epic slot distribution, a straight upgrade of Heron (despite it's not even same race).
---
Astero is more like a ship to gank standard exploring ships instead of doing exploring itself tbh. If you're not really into PvP just use racial cheap ones.
---
(Oh another downside of Astero is the calibration, offering only 375 to stop you from rigging both relic and data virus coherence.)
---
That shit would never fly today
---
It’s not that it’s so special that it was unique to their abilities. It’s that they took the trouble of actually doing the work that made it possible. Which nobody else did.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why you're trying to emphasize your point by saying the value was stored as 32 bits
---
Because they had to assume that CCP would have it stored as a 32-bit variable because that value, in expected usage, would never have to be accommodated by more than a 32-bit integer. If they went by the narrative [and: this is not me making that up, that is them telling the story] that they could just run through the process and run up the number such that it exceeded the 32-bit integer limit, but it was in fact a 32-bit integer, they would cause that value to crash. 
---
A crash in a variable that CCP would not expect to crash, because the number would never even closely approach let alone exceed the 32-bit integer limit, would draw the attention of CCP devs who would be at a loss to determine what the fuck ’they did this time’ to make a variable crash, thereby revealing something untoward was going on.
---
I can’t speak to your experience in online gaming, but 5 people coming together to discover how a change in a game mechanic offered an opportunity to greatly increase the profit potential, where the natural feature of Excel to run through ‘what if’ scenarios was combined with an astute manipulation of the player-driven market, allowing for a cycle that yielded a higher return than what was put into the system AND being careful enough to surmise that a critical variable was likely stored as a 32-bit integer that they did not want to crash, I think that’s pretty fucking sophisticated.
---
Please tell me which other gaming environment that you are aware of where this is even vaguely possible.
---
I'd love it to come back with the ability to interact in station with other pilots. 
---
Sadly, the stats show I'm in the minority and CCP have already said it's too difficult for them to maintain. :(
---
You need to find wormhole with good pi and bash POCOs inside it. Other solution is to became renter. 
---
I believe that no bigger group will allow you to use their planets for free / place own POCOs for free as you are "new" to them. There is always some tax. Sometimes 1%, 10% or even 50%. Sometimes you can buy POCO in x system for y isk.
---
Also after reading your post, I have a feeling (I talked with many people interested in doing own stuff and not interested in helping others and your type of post looks like one of these conversations, sorry if I'm wrong) that you look for getting stuff for free and not giving anything back.
---
But they shouldn't.
---
Look let’s just calm down here
---
no caps in querious either
---
As of 0700 UTC Saturday the lag is still palpable.
---
Fashow. I'm probably in the minority, but I'm good with the PVP content I generate for myself. Added free shit is just a bonus to me I guess
---
My take is that they should have increased the mineral requirement by 10x to 50x, such that it would actually be an alliance level effort to build one.
---
git gud
---
ye crazy old bastard.
---
So my blood raider get up will work great awesome
---
Minecraft with Immersive Engineering is bascically Factorio.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Tactical_Supremacy
---
&gt; So that brings me back to the question what is it like in the different power blocks? 
---
Fully automated luxury gay space communism.
---
&gt; If I can only make one or two ops a month is there a group that will not care? 
---
My own Corp requires 5 Strategic participations per month. Some of the others (Karma fleet, maybe Ascendance) require fewer.
---
&gt; Do I have to fold and make a hauler alt?
---
No. I have several hauler Alts, but they only do 1DQ1-A to my industry system (or, currently, LowSec to KQK war staging). Actual long distance freight is something that I pay PushX or ITL to handle for me.
---
&gt; Are you allowed to do your own thing?
---
Positively encouraged to do so, within certain limits. Play your own game, let others play theirs. Just make sure you build up a war chest, because you will be expected to take part in a war and krabbing is limited while war is ongoing.
---
&gt; I know this is probably wildly different depending on the alliance.
---
Im still waiting on all that gold a Nigirian Prince was gonna send me! Then i can finally afford that game.
---
I decided to buy the kindle version and it's amazing, love it. No images but that's ok, I'll probably buy volume 1 and 2 when I can. 
---
On a side note, I wonder what happened to the original BoB corps and to SirMolle. This dude was a true leader.
---
Triglavians lit a covert cyno in the database and hotdropped that shit.
---
I guess WA is +8? I've always looked at AUTZ as UTC+10.
---
Null Sec - Tactical Supremecy (Legacy), Kenshin, Anzac Alliance (Darkness)
---
Goons, Horde and Test always have activity in most time zones due to their size. I think there is a corp in Initiative.
---
IMO, just get your foot in the door with a decent sized group who are active and you will bump into smaller corps as you play.
---
wish i had a can. ended up rebuilding the carb on my lawn mower :D
---
If you were rich you'd be poor shortly thereafter
---
Hit up the icarus expedition quite a large autz 
---
Do do a bit of everything and yes we are proper autz with Aussies lol
---
It's going to depend on what each individuals 'harmless joke' is. Some people's harmless joke can be racist, homophobic or the like and a lot of people are going to be unhappy with that. depending on the group some will be hostile to that.
---
Damn radioactive, this is pure spice.
---
If keen here's our discord https://discord.gg/X2tFWX
---
We have Aussies from all
---
This deserves ALL teh upvotes
---
Evewho might not be up to date. If one of you is in game you can check for characters using the mail function.
---
The trig?
---
Totally get that. But at the same time, was never interested in any sort of games besides eve. Hard to wrap my head around.
---
Join eve down under discord: https://discord.gg/4VZ4Ex
---
You'll be able to find a variety of aussies and kiwis there.
---
I'll bet there is........
---
I miss it for sure. Used to love being able to walk around and look at your ship.
---
You killed em?
---
He'll give you lots of isk, but needs 50 million to secure the deposit, you see!
---
Excellent
---
how DARE you
---
&gt; Your summary of yourself makes you look like another worthless lowsec/troll candidate, do you have any valuable experience or opinions? I know that understanding the game isn't a requirement on the csm but jeez

Titan Doomsday weapons. You'll be training for quite a long while before you can use one though.

For once R/eve ain’t being a meme so so sad
---
r/eve 
---
^(love from r/foundthemobileuser)
---
You got me there.  
---
Also fuck you =D
---
This post just made me like you. Stop it
---
Exit Strategy. Part of the aforementioned tikle alliance.
---
L3 and above highsec missions are an easy way to fund your fw. Also fw lp store is cheaper, allowing you to get “free” faction ships and modules and sell them for profits
---
Low.class WH with a HS static.
---
Wait what? I was just getting into Eve...
---
I miss it, it was a nice immersion generator. It was super cozy to "lounge" in the quarters after a while of sweaty tryharding in ship spin mode. I wish it was fleshed out more, giving us something to "explore" as we travel - different stations, different interiors etc. 
---
What if the blood raiders had amarr stations with lots of ceremonial tools? Serpentis had free "sample drugs" in their "hotels", could even improve with standings.. i e you get a nice "bottle of champagne" if you have +5 standings.... 
---
In general, it'd be cool if higher standings = nicer room, and opposite for low standings. Just small touches to make the universe feel more alive and vibrant rather than just a stats game. 
---
I miss CQ.
---
They should get Captain Quarters back, imagine NC. joy !
---
Thanks man. Greatly appreciate that.
---
Exit strategy are the wh corp who was so scared of everyone they considered unanchoring their fort for fear of eviction and lack of cap pilots and quit to null. Probably not a good bet. 
---
Tikle in its main corp is OK, darkness is terrible bar nothing, idk. Yet to find an Autz corp worth a damn.
---
Thanks. I’ll definitely start the free version first. Can’t hurt.
---
In most cases Dodixie is more than enough. And there is no probs to get a jump clone there. Proximity of starting location to jita is as irrelevant as it could get.
---
Only if there was only just 5000titans :| the game has way too many supers. Probably closer to 10k
---
Fight being anchor, f1, hope you don't get blueballed again for the third time and lose two hours on an important blueball op
---
Went 2 days back with a 20 people cheap fit cruiser fleet to get a brawling fight in geminate and we roamed all the way from bwf-zz to o-w and beyond and we got only one pvp procurer and some small ships. Was empty AF
---
Test objectively has the highest amount of blues. And sadly, the rest of legacy has to suffer that blue list
---
Personally i say no
---
\- Eve is a space ship game to me, i personally want to fly spaceships not run around a station or sit in a chair in a room.
---
\- When CCP 1st introduced the captain's quarters and walking in stations a lot of people experienced excessive load time and extra heat in gfx cards and other parts of their pc.  Yes even within this short time frame technology has moved on from then but it's still a factor.
---
\- Developer time could be better spent improving and fixing existing parts of the game over reintroducing WiS or captain's quarters.
---
\- If it did ever return as it was it would encourage more players to stay inside stations and not be out creating or taking part in spaceship content.  It would have to come with a fully complete overhaul of what it was with real tangible things to do or affect game play somehow; not just a cosmetic after-thought.  For this reason alone would require many dev hours for something that may not turn out to be any good for the game or the players.
---
Catch isn't the space for gfs. Hasn't been for a long time. You docked up and pinged twice for five boys in cruisers, then undocked like 60 talwars. Good job..
---
If only that wasn't a first tho
---
There are groups that believe rl over Eve, like literally all of them, even the allegedly elite ones. They just don't tolerate being as bad usually
---
Battleship. I tried in a gila similar fit for abyss site (t3) and i almost got blapped. Not at conduits tho, but near an azbel. As soon as you shoot the renewing ships a new fleet warps in and they are fast AF.  I reckon a praxis would do it cheap but i haven't tried. I saw people in rattlesnakes. Maybe a hac would do it better but that is not cheap.
---
Not sure why I got down voted. Goons will take you even if you can only manage one fleet per month.
---
Doesn't take a lot of time, really. Buy ships or haul them on, scan if you want, log in for pings or do whatever otherwise. Not much different, just smaller scaled than null
---
The only thing killing Eve online is /r/eve
---
Low quality bait.
---
Mostly boring
---
Because that would make things safer, Eve isn’t about being safe
---
Considering you guys regularly come to Geminate for content, yes it must be. This also ties into your other comment about us being homeless soon. Imagine killing your only source of content and bragging about it. Do you people have a collective IQ of 80, or do you just ignore that Serenity exists? What happend there was a warning, not an instruction
---
Fit a sleipnir with 425mm autocannons, 2 tracking enhancers, and 3 gyros. Double web your target. Eat a Drop booster. Use a T2 gun rig for damage. You'll be applying 700 dps to frigates.
---
This one does not spark joy
---
Depends on what you want to do.
---
The best days of eve are behind us but there is still some fun to be had. Just dont become an F1 monkey.
---
Obviously never flown in exit then lol
---
2/10 for bait attempt, may I suggest a simpler game for you moving forward - runescape you can teleport to capitals! Have fun cya
---
If you're looking to check if PvP corps are active in AUTZ, look on their killboards for the time of their kills.
---
Also, if you're headed to Null, the bloc as a whole will be active in AUTZ even if your specific corp isn't.
---
NC isn't a tutor on this game? Lol also he actually wants to take part in content not station spin somewhere else
---
This its all dead
---
They may, but they're not going to.
---
I hope to god that this is extremely low-quality bait because if it isn't then you are genuinely the dumbest motherfucker on the planet.
---
We all know the farmers/bots don't bash or donate to hubs. So yes, the amarr ~~"~~militia~~"~~ did hit T5.
---
Yeah it’s not a tumor as in obsessed with the biggest blue donut imaginable and turning nullsec into serenity 2.0... it’s still kindof shit but not a cancer on the game
---
Just go to incursion area and in incursion chat just ask people to invite you to "incursion public". In its MOTD will be a list of all incursion groups that are currently active and their composition. Good luck o7
---
fucking underrated comment.
---
What about Terraria or Dragon Quest Builders?
---
Your quick to forget when NC. And the rest of the game teamed up on that 1 cancer as you put it and did have the blue donut you so fear.. But that doesn't fit your narrative does it if you cant grrr goons what do you have?
---
If half or 3/4 of the map isn't blue then everyone is "against" them
---

---
obviously need to spin more ships?
---
Im all for it allow my jump freighter to jump to Jita!  Yay ::sarcasm::
---
It was a well round shitpost till the last paragraph. Star Shitizen lol. It will not be even close to Eve at it's worst.
---
And I am pretty sure even 10000 titans were made long time ago. There must be at least2 spare ones for every Goon and their rivals have around 2 titans per titan toon om average, so do the maths.
---
Well the awoxing he was doing didn't help.
---
I base it off the what I've heard from that corp that merged into exit and left in disgust 
---
Or should I take about exit strats lack of balls, and how in spite of having the biggest autz, all they did was evictions?
---
&gt;stealth structures
---
Oh lawd no
---
Everything else indicates that they'll start bashing/taking over(?) structures soon. Maybe they'll even kill PI colonies?
---
Yeah on a temporary basis, this current situation is completely different
---
Shit loads of money to gain vs 1 loss
---
A picture without context.. Thanks
---
You’re literally blue to 3/4 of the map, or effectively blue. The hypocrisy is stunning.
---
So where is my sp?!
---
The only times where I used it was when I misclicked the undock button. If actually served *any* kind of purpose, maybe
---
We’re all in tribute now, as you should know if you’re not flairbaiting.
---
Im not Sure how it is 'completely different ' all the entities that got fucked over by Panfam are jumping in for their revenge it's exactly the same like when all entity's jumped in for their revenge against goons. It is literally the exact same scenario with the exact same outcomes
---
EvE is like life ... Were you born too early? ... Join in, have fun, leave ... (and possibly rinse and repeat in the case of EvE)
---
Scan rangefinding array :)
---
Oh yes! lets meet before the space auction house with our characters and jumprunning toward the spacemailbox and sit around the space campfire  and ccp can provide us with cute space pets for our character as well ....you want that? 
---
eve is more "throw a handgranade into a group of characters and press F"
---
context is in the response.   
---
Graph is the isk killed in the AUTZ by corp. Cant generate that with ship spinning :)
---
Temporary blues for a single war vs permanent blues/bluetrals for the past few years, that’s how it’s different
---
If only your idea worked in RL and I could skip all the traffic to the Bottleshop.
---
You mean the Corp that merged into the alliance then left a few months later with 90% of the said Corp staging and joining exit
---
Except we fight with tapi on a regular basis we just don't engage with sov warfare infact right now there are several test cloaky chars in delve hunting as there are PH/pl
---
Ok lol believe what you will, fucking retarded goon shill
---
I know but i was hoping some guys stayed home.
---
I think the believe what you will is on you also i font hide my char name or my allegance im very much goon for life and will happily blow up test pilots but if I had to rate who I hate more and had to pick enemy's they are much further down the list than panfam
---
UPDATE:
---
Day 1: Currently 4:30am, I sleep after 3 more ore hauls.
---
^This
---
Windows10?
---
I can't comment on any other group, but Horde is pretty hands off. The only requirement for staying is logging in once every few weeks. We are quite big, so it shouldn't really be hard to find someone to do stuff with. And if you ever want to learn about something, we can teach you. We have ops spread relatively evenly across the day, so you can probably always hop on one that fits your schedule. And no, you don't have to get a hauler alt. We have hauling services, but it's usually better to liquidate as much of your assets as possible. If you have anything really shiny like caps you might want to ask about how to move it tho.
---
The Ditanian Fleet
---
This post made my brain not work so good no more
---
there are only 5000 titans in eve? honestly i thought there were twice as many but maybe br5rb and asakai had a longer lasting toll than i thought.
---
i tried that game but it didnt have local so just like wormhole space i left like a bitch
---
(rt the lack of a map made that game too hard for me)
---
Tell you what, convince mittens to call off the invasion and we’ll go back to geminate to provide you with all the content you want
---
Sorry not a poor, don’t need your nullsec shit
---
I'll pass on that stick with home roaming gangs haha
---
Bait!
---
Lances fit that description. Unfortunately they are titan weapons, so pretty much endgame content.
---
I recently joined VDD, and just for transparency, it's actually two little tumors - one attached to the tip, and one attached to the date.
---
It's done just to keep you honest.
---
Fair warning.
---
True. I do hear that D’n’G have been quietly bashing one out here and there.
---
clearly bait, but at least learn the mechanics for next time.
---
you can blops bridge out of highsec. so just get three accounts, 2 cyno/blops bridgers, 1 blockade runner and then you can restock your probes all day long.
---
Yeah you’re very happy being risk averse and choosing the easy path in eve, got it
---
Mate! VDD isn't something you just "get" like the lump on your Man-titties caused from smoking way too many  of  the Goon cheap'n'nasty brand of cock.
---
VDD needs to be sort out and "Caught!" Kinda like the Gay AIDS was back when they used to be cool!
---
Good comment right here
---
man you had me excited for a sec
---
As a brand new player who wants to get into pvp and pve, which skills should I be training right now and in which order?
---
Here have my upeeeeeeee
---
&gt;oil worker
---
&gt;blames western society
---
these go hand in hand lmao oil workers are such cool dudes i wish they werent so disconnected so i could have more cool friends
---
There's Armor-1 a Russian group but i think they're doing more lowsec stuff now. You could always check them out though  
---
Edit: I've just checked there channel and there in highsec. Join channel Armor-1 ingame.
---
Your idea's and concerns are the same as a lot of us running this year.   
---
Shhh, don't tell but, that would be dudette; may have 0 chance of election as far as you are concerned, but that's not going to stop me from trying to shed light on the  concerns now or into the future. So vote, long and hard and encourage others to vote as well.
---
The rats have much more armor buffer and they also RR armor.
---
i heard it went like this:
---
* got in trouble for sending gore pics to other members via discord pm  
---
* awoxed  
---
* fed his titan, super, and dread  
---
* kicked
---
is that correct?
---
How did your friend get cough?
---
Didn't know about the discord stuff, but the rest is what I understand happened.
---
Thank you CCCP for killing my 350 mil. Ishtar right after getting a 400 mil skill book drop....   F for implants too - I'll need the 10 pounds back for my sub too,  you nastards!
---
i wonder if ccp ever thought that random newbies would routinely be buying and NPCing in titans
---
5000 seems way to low seeing as though they're obtainable by the average 0.0 line member
---
You don't have to Imagine ... Karmafleet is recruiting :-)
---
What am I looking at?
---
Again ?
---
Hi sin
---
if you struggle with map awareness, just watch Tarkov youtubers. They often roam the more dangerous areas of the maps and eventually you will have a 'mental map' of all the areas.
---
Or Magneticraft. Magneticraft doesn't even beat about the bush, it just has Inserters.
---
"Any day now... aaaany day now..."
---
An “F1 Monkey”?
---
The easy path in eve? The path that's full of content, im not on here qqing the games dead being goon there is always content 24/7 even if it is chilling on comes blowing up NC structures it's more than I can say for a lot of others
---
If you ask a question on the internet that is "am I the only one..." the answer is always no. You aren't the only one.
---
lmao keep spinning, must be fun to actually believe this
---
It is fun to actually have content and not believe the spergs on this sub reddit yes...
---
I sometimes forget how much supidity is in average playerbase
---
arranged fights against bluetrals isn't content
---
Yet here you are demonstrating it
---
No
---
Yus cheap slicers for everyone :)
---
A fight is a fight infact as least tapi show up to fights more than. Can be said for panfam so enjoy that spin yourself
---
Well, you'll still have to figure out their raw hull, armor and shield hitpoints.
---
It's not late at all!
---
Last night I was in fleet with 2 new bros that have been only playing for days.
---
Pm me here if you decide to sign up and on our next fleet you can tag along, see what its all about.
---
You are the first person I have ever heard who said proximity to jita is unimportant for beginners
---
Not for career agents, sadly...
---
One thing I can bet everything on is that Star Citizen is going to be in beta as long as EVE has
---
Great book especially if you go into it not knowing anything.
---
I think they could bring back the Captain Quarters and expand on it and make it into apartments and such make it into another part of the game like a virtual world look at Second Life you do something like that with inside of Eve I think they could hook the TV up to like YouTube or something like that and make it pretty damn cool also they could take some notes from  Tony Gonzalez Templar one was it really good read so far I would love to see the Gantry crane and your pod like that coming out of the ship that would be cool as hell they could do so much with it but they got a one too and they don't want to right now
---
lol literally every new player once he learns how to use navigation can set a route to jita and get there in less than 10 minutes or something and move home station there or setup a jump clone.
---
For new player Jita is irrelevant because everything he needs he can buy in his faction trading hub. And sell there as well. Also, other trading hubs are safer in terms of possible suicide ganks.
---
The best faction to start a character is the one you like the most. Just check how the ships look and overall faction lore.
---
Looks like someone needs their cheeks divided
---
Weird, eve is dying again?
---
Says the pre-injector veteran who still can't grasp (or accept) the concept. I know cause I agreed with you, left the post and realized we are both wrong and came back to make fun of you too.
---
Argh, just let it go...
---
*Loud screaming Raider noises*
---
Nah, i like the way it is now
---
Inviting randoms is the best when you already have 4 people
---
Writing sexual fanfiction for isk.
---
Can we have an example?
---
That's just wormhole dementia. When you haven't been to k space in weeks and it's just and endless d scan sound on repeat even when you're in station. You start hearing ships landing out of warp next to you on a hole so your head snaps up, but there's nothing there. 
---
This is the final stage. The "writing crazy shit on the wall" stage you see in movies.
---
You've never heard of the ***meat locker***?
---
Payment first please.
---
Yeah Western Australia is UTC+8 but the majority of Australians are UTC+10 so there or near enough is more than fine.
---
Yeah, all those clones can be quite entertaining.
---
He doesn’t do it for free, can’t you read?
---
No clones. Only meat
---
"waiting for shit to happen" is your entire problem.
---
"PvP and PvE" is about as broad as it gets, but I'll assume that by "PvE" you mean specifically ratting (shooting NPCs for money), as opposed to exploration, mining or industry. 
---
I'd say pick a ship or a faction that you like, your skills will depend on your choice. For PvP, train up a racial frigate skill to IV, and work on training the corresponding weapon skills to IV/V so you can fit T2 guns at some point. For example, if you choose a Slasher, you would train something like Minmatar Frigate IV, gunnery support skills (ones that increase range, damage, accuracy etc. for turret weapons), and Small Projectile Turret V. Also try to get engineering and navigation skills to IV - you can never go wrong training those. 
---
For PvE, depends where you live, but the Vexor Navy Issue is a popular choice, so you would do Gallente Cruiser IV, Drones V, Heavy Drones IV and other drone support skills. 
---
Also take a look at [the magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)
---
It'd probably be like maplestory 2: Nicer looking, better controls, less grindy, but ultimately boring, and lacking key features that made teh first one so good, like monsters actually being themed to the zone you're in. Whoever at Nexon decided to just throw the lego monsters and rats and ghosts together in random areas is a complete idiot.
---
how do you even become this dumb
---
yes please.
---
I wonder the same about the 10 of you tin foiled hat idiots on here sperging grr goons 17hrs a day 7 days a week but I guess if you any win anywhere else this is all you got
---
already a thing in delve and eso, except everyone has their own personal titan bridge.
---
I’d recommend joining Horde. Can literally do whatever you want. 
---
Horde inc doesn’t require anything of you, but if you want to put in more effort you can and there are avenues to make the most of your effort.
---
I always thought ANZAC where like the only decent AUS tz Corp.
---
How good is the salvage? Better than regular rat salvage?
---
lmao i'm here 24/7 retard
---
all alliances have titans in strategic systems to be able to bridge to places
---
I guess you saw my adverts in discord last night then :poggers:
---
bro even with the proliferation, still to this day, not all do.
---
All alliances that aren't retarded pubbies*
---
Idiot
---
We call it "The Ring" (It's a shit tonne of Raitarus, send help, we have a problem)
---
The Ring will bring us salvation, it is the ultimate shrine to BOB
---
No.
---
It is illegal to post it here.
---
How long was eve in beta?
---
A friend told me you can make good isk doing erp in rens.
---
I stand corrected
---
I'd actually love a complete reset. 
---
delete the DB and make fresh start.
---
Already a thing, moving on
---
You can not jump a capital into jita, it has to be gated in. Things like probes should be standard on and local market place, your corp needs to do a bulk buy of essential items for it's market place. 
---
And by your corp I mean get off your arse and do it you will even make isk doing it by added a fee to every item you seed to your corps local market.
---
if krabber losses dont count in Delve then these JF ganker losses dont count either.
---
Oops sorry
---
Until your the one being vacated 😂
---
Technically we are controlling a single character; your ship.
---
There’s plenty of MMOs that put you in the driving seat of a vehicle instead of an individual character. EVE even espouses the same third person behind the character viewpoint used in most MMOs.
---
we don't say his name, especially 3 times while looking into a mirror
---
I know the server crashed so that probably explains what happened, but it just seems weird that the only excavators lost were all in TEST (with just 1 INIT renter one dying in the same period). Seems odd that TEST would be the group to lose them.
---
Goons killing their own sig?
---
Please, keep eve deleted. Also delete your reddit.

thanks TH, appreciate it!

Ihhhh. Caps (other than freighter and jump freighters) cant go into high sec at all?
---
I was not aware of that. I could not imagine being the first one to come up with the idea.
---
On the off-chance that I would be...
---
Kind of weird not to include career agents...
---
If you wanted to know rorq systems...
---
If you want to supply a l4 mission hub with ammo. Just sell it in the station with the l4 agent. It will take literal decades to repay the coast of an azbel.
---
Or even better: Ships.
---
When you want to be an active pvp player then it is the most boring thing. When you are jsut a carebear like 98% of nullsec then it is the perfect thing for you.
---
Yep. Can not remember the ship that can, but most can not.

Yeah ofc its easy to find content when youre part of the biggest blob in the game, the point is you take no risk and no initiative yourself. Youre literally bragging about blowing up structures with your superfleet thats bigger than the next two biggest powers combined.

The margins on that stuff is incredibly slim already talking under a  few percent the sheer numbers you'd need to produce to break even would take a very long time let alone profits
---
And yet you still join them, like the pussy you are. Too afraid to take any risk.
---
Yeah people seed smaller niche markets like this all the time, just make sure you actually sell it in the right station cus selling it out of an azbel is somewhat against the point.
---
Also 10% is probably too low a margin for ammo, I’d aim for a bit higher since your volume will not be very high.
---
Oh mercy me. Thanks.
---
I feel like there’s more important stuff to spend dev time on
---
Also you can aim at fw Conflict systems.
---
Goons and PanFam aren't doing much rorq mining right now.
---
Also you can feed faction warfare conflict systems
---
Thanks! \^_^
---
I don't know if I agree with that. I think the "word of mouth" is important in the sandbox (as you said - player interaction) rather than just "show info" - to me it seems more organic and less polished if there is some actual "intel" i need to research regarding this. 
---
Maybe it's because I'm an advanced player, but recently I needed to get a lot of intel regarding NPCs and missions - i had to ACTUALLY research this, crossreference etc etc to be able to predict and optimize my fits. 
---
Even more recently with invasions, I'm trying to gauge what kind of fit i'd need to solo/snipe the officers, and all this mystery and enterprise went out the window when I realized there was a data scraping site that had all the stats. It just removes a lot of mystery.
---
But you are right, and this is why CCP did this - it makes the game easier, a.k.a the late stage krabbification of EVE. I suppose a necessary sacrifice to make sure we get more players.
---
And which side are you on because if your in any big block then fucking LOL calling someone else a pussy when from what I can tell you're just a shitty hordie or NC player in exactly the same scenario
---
&gt;Data scrapers? You just google 'eve online [rat faction] resists'. Or put it in Pyfa.  
---
and where did they get this data from? ...
---
&gt; Even against players, with **enough experience** 
---
that's the point, and that should be the point with NPCs too. Glad we're agreeing!
---
For me as a PVE player this is great! It makes EVE easier.
---
For EVE this is terrible! It makes EVE easier.

As much as I'd love some gtav level apartment I can invite friends into, tbh if it was me only and furniture was expensive I'd spend ridiculous isk on decorations. Go play no man's sky let me build my own quarters just like the space on the freighter.

Ironic that NC and Horde still have more risk to them than your alliance as well.
---
Some 15 years and going?

About 7 months.

It would probably be better just to buy the stuff in a hub and ship it to the mission system in bulk. Hulls are the only thing that have any real volume and would cause you a problem to DST in.

I actually kinda like this.
---
They should be added though not replacing the current ones.
---
The best PVP won't be spoon fed, LS is great for PVP but also hop into Wormholes, or go on a small roam in NS (you'll notice some regions are more active than others) and just generally go hunt down some content.
---
If I go by your zkill your a pubbie nobody who has no ball in the court and should go back to paying code their 10mil but I suspect your an alt
---
i defnitely think the rng should be more lenient the beginning and harsher the end. its still random but the randomness tends towards harder spawns in the end and vice versa.
---
 its kind of anticlimatic to have a massive drifter spawn in the beginning and a few rogue drones in the end.
---
find sorionuk1 from IIC they are an armour incursion group, he is the oldest FC playing eve these days, over 80 years old. been playing since 2003.

Wormholes are the best place to find relics and data. Hop into a wormhole and just scan scan scan. Follow the wormhole chains. Pirate relics(the undefended sites) spawn in class 1 to 3 wormholes.
---
This is better than going through nullsec where you have a lot of competition and not enough sites.
---
Sometimes relic sites will accumulate in a low class wormhole and you can get 5 relic sites all at once. Its kinda a jackpot.

I made a decent living hunting clone tags for a while, the ones in 0.2 systems are like 25-30m each depending on where you sell them.

The one thing your sure to find in EvE, is that no matter what the dev's do your going to find some bitter player who thinks the small change is the end of the world, even tho this exact information is probably the most common bit of text found in highsec players bio's.

Bringing captains quarters back would be a waste of time. If they're going the first person route again they should focus on gameplay first and gimmicky station houses last.
---
Take the puzzle exploration concept they talked about a few years ago and have people explore sleeper ruins in their meat sack and expand content from there. Would open eve up to much larger playerbase that'll make their way into space as well.

in terms of a learning experience, once you actually 'get' EVE and then a bit more, there is nothing more to find in that respect. 
---
&gt; Can the game still be fun for someone with such limited time to play? I’d want to join a corp, but who would want a part time player like me.
---
Others may disagree, but I personally find EVE only interesting if I pour a reasonable amount of time and energy in it. Playing it too casually doesnt really work, it least not for me. There are other games out there that are way more suitable in providing you fun action in like 30 - 60 minutes of playtime.
---

If CCP had infinite resources and could work on it without slowing anything down, I'd say yes, go for it. Unfortunately, working on the Captain's Quarters would mean shifting resources from fixes and new features that actually have an impact on gameplay, which should always take priority.

---
For what it’s worth, I only actually play about 2 hours a night.  Weekends I’ll get on for longer, however, I don’t have kids and know that can be a struggle. I wouldn’t be undocking a 25bil ship if I never knew when I’d have to hop off to go handle something with the kids. 
---
But, there’s more to eve than flying supers. You could have a lot of fun flying exploration ships and doing data/relic sites or scanning for abandoned drones/fighters/ships.  And, that’s the kind of activity you could just safe up, cloak and go afk whenever you need.
---
Astero is the premier exploration ship because of the cloak. If you're cloaked up in a safe, you can scan down the system without worrying about anyone attacking you. If you're constantly dscanning, you can even spot threats without them knowing you are there. If you get attacked by an Astero, you've got a good chance of survival and either fit a good tank or multiple warp core stabs to either fight back against another Astero, or escape and cloak up.
---
Goddamn these are really good, A+

This smells like bait
---
Killing highsec T2 NPC miners and salvaging their T2 salvage. Each group of NPC Skiffs produces the same income as a null relic site. (Also kill the hauler for the skin/named mining mod)
---
I can't believe there's people bitching about this change. Truly, EVE is dying. ^^^/s
---
Players come and go in EVE, and often industrialists will level out of certain markets, especially something as low margin as ammo and drones. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy making some ISK at it and provide a bit of a public service as you do it. If you see a hole in your local market, go ahead and fill it. As long as you sell at a profit, you're doing it right. Most of the best ISK I've made in EVE was selling low margin, high volume items at a fair price in areas where stuff was a little hard to obtain. Buying and shipping from Jita might be cheaper, but I think most players would rather just buy it locally and call it a day. If I can manufacture it just as cheaply and eliminate shipping costs, then that just increases my profit margins against Jita prices. For stuff like ammo and drones, if you have a mining alt, it might even pay to mine the ore yourself. Depending on your time this could create more margin.
---
Personally, I would not invest in your own structure for this type of industry. The margins won't be great enough to justify the cost, and the biggest bonuses to player owned stations is time, which again, isn't that big of a deal in ammo and drone manufacturing. Besides, since you're running L4s, you probably have high standings with the NPC station, so you'll get a discount on your broker fees and make it extra convenient for your buyers by selling it in station. If you're going to manufacture the stuff instead of buy it and ship/haul it in, you'll need to choose the best available station near to you. This might be someone else's structure or a nearby NPC station with manufacturing. If you're planning on seeding multiple markets, you might want to find a place that's central to all of them.
---
No. Because Eaglemoss im guessing sells thousands of models. 
---
I really doubt the Eve Models would sell anywhere near enough to justtify the cost.
---
I've had this as a recurring bug since last patch too
---
&gt; For what it’s worth, I only actually play about 2 hours a night.
---
That is not casual playing imo, especially if you have a job. You are essentially devoting a significant portion of your free time to a video game
---
If goons weren't at war, everyone would be laughing at goons.  Of course, that doesn't stop them from laughing at goons now.
---
I thought i heard somewhere that ccp had already put plans in motion to release ship models
---
From what I can see, about 200,000 active capsuleers? It wouldn’t be a huge income generator for CCP right off the bat, but if it’s more than zero then it may be a worthwhile investment for them?
---
Astero is a great explo ship. However, do not undock it until you can fit a covert ops cloak or you will be ganked
---
That does sounds like something I would find enjoyable actually.
---
I didn’t realise there was money to made in just exploring.
---
Where did you hear this?? It’s long overdue for sure, as long as it’s profitable for all parties involved. I’m wondering if complications in the past with Eve physical merchandise have prevented them from expanding their collectibles. You know how rocky the EVE Store has been over the last 8+ years.
---
Its not a bug. You have to go into your people and places menu, into the locations tab, and click on the eye icons next to your bookmark folders. Thats how you make them appear in space.

i appreciate that there is a chat channel dedicated to helping rookies out with the basics. three days in and a gm pm'ed me to see if i was getting along okay, told me to feel free to ask any questions if i needed help, and gave me a spare venture and race skin to boot.
---
i haven't been playing for long at all, but i certainly felt more at home here than any other mmo game i've tried, despite all the things i've heard over the years about eve and the people who play it. i'm sure sooner or later i'll run into some nasty people, but i think the fact that no matter how strong a player gets in the game they can still lose their most prized assets to someone stronger or more skilled helps to keep things polite and civil in a way that few other games have managed to capture.
---
and most of all, i finally appreciate why, when i was showing an xbox friend the ropes in elite; dangerous, he always had to compare the mechanics with those in eve, and always wanted to team up to fly. he spent years here, where everything from basic survival to getting into the most powerful ships and equipment requires teamwork and connecting with other pilots, and i spent years there, where at its core all you have is yourself and your wits getting by in an endless, cold galaxy. grit and grandeur, and i appreciate that eve has been around long enough that i could experience both in my absolute favorite genre of fiction.

now i need to decide which i would appreciate more; sleep and rest, or another round of hauling goods and blasting the everliving shit out of some space rocks.

Yup. Would also do the trick. I'd also say add elite battle ships and make the ration of elite battle ships increase by sec status. 1.0 no elite rats. 0.0 50 % elite -1.0 100 % elite rats.

About the what? When? Wtf are you even talking about?

If only we could join them
---
You obviously know it doesn't. Do math to figure out what a DC II and a rig or hardener for the biggest one or two holes are. Or look at Pyfa. Or hear it from your PvP god buddy. You have a starting point though with the ship hull raw resists. They should have been in game for rats from the start. This isn't the end of EVE. It doesn't contribute to the krabbification of EVE. It isn't terrible. EVE is dying (because of this).
---
Yes, ty.
---
:)
---
Or they'll end up with a warehouse full of models.
---
Models like those are incredibly expensive to do runs of and generally you need to do thousands of runs per model.
---
So while they might sell in the thousands total, each model wont sell in the thousands.
---
Assuming 2000 people actually want a model, do they all want a Rifter model? Or do they want Apoc, Nyx etc etc models. 
---
Which is why now, they are looking into 3D printing, because they can easily do shorter runs at a FAR cheaper cost.
---
ummm... wtf are you on about
---

FC what are industry indexes.
---
So their concern was that the LP value was stored as a 32 bit unsigned integer. My comment was in reference to a 32 bit real(or single precision float), which is what I would think ISK would be stored in. 
---
A 32 bit unsigned integer has a maximum value of a little over 4 billion, while a signed integer is a little over 2 billion. The difference in value comes from the fact that a signed integer uses the MSB to store whether the value is positive or negative. Their concern was that they would have an integer overflow if they ended up going too high with the value, possibly causing the sign bit to go high(assuming it was signed, but I doubt it was given the usage) causing the value to appear negative. This was demonstrated somewhat with the infinite gun exploit in Clarion Call 3. 
---
Any game involving numerical values where you could possibly exceed the value range could have this issue(money exploit, etc.).
---
Still works occasionally. Made 400m×2 on autopiloting a providence between Amarr and Jita while I was at work for 1 week

It would seem so. That’s why there’s hope in the prospect of teaming up with another company that is good at manufacturing and selling physical models.

Maybe it would provoke the Dotlan guy to finally fix the Strat Index code on Dotlan to no longer be tied to the TCU since it was changed in 2014 to the I-Hub.
---
Actually Grath I die to other stuff just fine. Don't recall ever having my Frigate blapped by a trig ship. Though from what I hear it could certainly happen if they put in the right ammo.  
---
However, point still stands: What is the purpose of Triglavian ships, other than to do what every other subcapital does on steriods?  
---
Why do we need a race of ships that overshadows every other ship, and be a tool for the rich elite to rickroll every other fleet? Please go back and read the original post and try to answer without deflecting.  
---
Oh wait.. you're GrathTelkin. It's what you do.

Offer something they are not getting from other corps, don't know what that would be.

The biggest problem is gonna be that noone knows about you or your corp. at least in the beginning.
---
hmm, nice flair, who's am I stealing then :D
---
Offer something like what example?
---
Nice attempt to make cost of Trig ships seem like a huge downside. It's actually a reason I dislike them. They don't allow new players to be more relevant.   
---
In fact their power factor and abilities appeals to the small elite groups that own enough supers to destroy any capitals a small alliance fields. Now with Triglavian ships the elite groups can dominate on the sub-capital side too.   
---
Effectively it's nullified the fighting options of small-scrappy alliances that are trying to not rely on powerbloc supers/titan bridge fleets.
---
Honstly you should not be able to have a ihub with out a tcu but i do not want have to remove and place both to take sov.
---
The whole system needs to be simplified, one system control unit. Maybe have it use a timer so if you want to just kill jump bridges in system you can bath it but no nit need to entose it.
---
Or move some of the benefits of IHUBS to TCUs
---
Yeah thats the thing you need to find. I have no clue what ppl are looking for in a corp.
---
Me either tbh but I’m still trying to figure that out I was thinking of going on the highly organized side of things with a military foundation
---
Agreed, also you won't get hunted, bubbled and shot at in hi sec so won't learn how to survive in dangerous situations.  What I did was start with t1 exploration frig looking for wormholes in hi sec that lead to j space and start scanning c1-c3 holes for pirate relic sites.  When you comfortable with that make routes though low sec doing the same.    Eventually when you dont really die to stupid things, move into an astero or covert ops ship with cloak.  Or you could go easy mode and just join a null block and explore friendly space which is way safer than wormholes and will make you the most isk.
---
so you gonna removed the ability  to sb off a fleet form a gate to  or is that ok ?.
---
lol &lt;3 you too

I was in an abyssal pocket when eve was kill so I thought “so long my gila “ but upon relogging I found myself in kspace unharmed. Good rollback 👍
---
Not only did it need to be restarted, for about 20 minutes before it went down it was completely unresponsive for most people. You couldn't dock/undock, you couldn't pull in drones, you couldn't even moved assets in your hanger.
---
That's my point exactly.
---
Is that obscure? You could seriously make millions off that.
---
Carry a mobile depot, fit for scan strength while searching and once you have your site scanned refit to hacking modules. You don’t need to be fit to do everything if you’re only doing one thing at a time. If you’re in hostile space drop all your valuables into the depot (including your sisters probe launcher!) before entering the site.
---
Part-time players are the backbone of EVE. People who spend 100% of their time in the game get super burned out. You're way better off just playing for a few hours a day, going to whatever ops  you can, and then taking a break. It's what I do and it makes it fun to log into the game every night or other night to play.

---
When have I ever shit post?
---
&gt;  It seems with the combat build the only thing I can take on are other explorers in small frigates
---
That's the point. With the combat build, you're mostly banking on finding and blowing up other explorers while you're out and taking their loot. You still aren't going to fight hunters in larger ships - it *might* be possible to take on a sabre in a few cases, depending on skills and fits, but it's still not going to be the sort of target you want. (You mostly likely *could* murder a bomber, though, they're fragile and generally have a hard time applying enough damage to something as potentially tanky as a well-fit astero.) However, a combat fit astero is just as deadly to explorers in covops or t1 explo frigs as those larger ships are to you.
---
Ah thank you!
---
They absolutely don't overshadow every other ship, you're fabricating a fact like kellyanne conway right now and expecting everybody to believe you.
---
There are ships that shoot farther, there are even comparable ships in a size category that can outdps some (frig, dessie and cruiser) there are ships that are faster, there are ships that tank harder, there are ships that are better with drones, warp faster, can MJD more often.
---
You are a gigantic pussy and your question of "why are they even hear" drips with your inability to deal with a loss.

Thank you again! this is really helpful!

Let me offer a different perspective my friend - EVE is and has always been what you make of it. There are people who literally don't log in and still play the game. Granted, that's not the experience most people are looking for, but I would suggest that no matter how much or how little time you have, no matter what your interest is or how you like to fly there is always something for you in EVE if you like internet spaceships. I myself have three kids and still find that even if I only have a few hours a week EVE can still be exciting and rewarding. The trick is finding the right place to experience EVE how you want. I'd consider joining my corporation Dreddit. It's a large corp so there's not going to be people harassing you about not being somewhere doing something you don't want to do, or don't have time to do. Lots of people just sit in space and pop rocks or pew pew rats in combat sites and contribute in their own way when they can. On the other hand, if you want lots of content and classic EVE experiences like roaming, large fleets, capital ship combat etc we have ton of that as well. Hit me up if you're interested, I've really loved my experience in Dreddit and we've always got room for people who enjoy internet spaceships™.

This is honestly a pretty good idea. Given how unified all utilities are in the iHub and the lack of real practical need for TCU, then it makes no sense to have it anymore. Just reducing the grind and make sov warfare just a little less PITA.

An astero can easily kill another exlporer, any bomber, and many other frigs. It has a chance against any frig and bigger stuff too. Fitting it for evasion or combat are both valid, just don’t get somewhere in the middle or you’ll die. A half combat astero won’t beat much and a half evasion astero won’t outrun much.
---
Reddit automatically removes quickmeme.com. This is good because your post is terrible.
---
I remember that video, was a long time ago maybe over a year ago I saw it
---
This is all true. Bombers are paper tank and apply like shit to frigates. 
---
Asteros are one of the best explorer hunters out there. I fly a full combat astero and only swap to hacking gear if I find a very quiet cluster of sites. If you carry swaps, keep combat equipped by default or you’ll have to drop a depot at the worst time.
---
time for drones, zerkers ftw
---
these cells should be fixed now.

There really is a lot of copy pasting in this sheet, so thanks for the help.

Just remove the TCU from fozzie sov, make it a shootable structure with no damage cap. move whatever real benefits remain (pos fuel bonus i think still?) to the ihub or remove the bonus.

BOSON gatecamps can only be done in nullsec systems, as doomsday devices that are the core of this camping method can only be activated in nullsec. You will never see a Titan in highsec, so anywhere around Rens is safe, so long that it’s not a lowsec system.
---
In lowsec, you can still meet Titans, but they cannot fire their doomsdays.
---
I hope this is the last day of your posting too. Your parents were too drunk to put a kill condition on you, so here we are.
---
There are definitely no highly organized pvp groups in this game; that sounds like a great niche
---
I submitted a ticket on this. The GM suggested creating a new “test” profile in which to open the game. I did, and then just clicked back to my old profile and it’s working perfectly now.
---
Do you need a tissue?
---
Once upon a time, when the titan DD was a gigantic AE weapon, you could even launch the DD through a titan bridge - all titans were nano/cap fit and every frig warping into your fleet had the potential to unleash an unstoppable hell that would boil off anything but a heavily tanked BS from a ship 14 jumps away hugging pos shields.

Btw profiles are found by clicking the cogwheel next to your account on the launcher.

You run 18 omega accounts?  I think EVE going down may be doing you a favor

---
The way you swap gear is by carrying a mobile depot and you just refit?
---
&gt;I fly a full combat astero and only swap to hacking gear if I find a very quiet cluster of sites.
---
So, then you don't' really do exploration; more hunting of explorers? So you only occasionally do sites ONLY if you find cluster's with good sites and no players?
---
So you run around with combat scanner probes hunting for ships? And what? Find them, warp to within 0 meters cloaked, and then light them up?
---
I am just trying to understand the thought process :D
---
Hey, nice cake man

yea well grow the fuck up cupcake. This is eve.

Character transfer is fine. Its account transfer they will ban you over.
---
Omega is the paid subscription for the game, and it allowance faster skill training, and unlimited ship and module usage assuming you have the skills. Without it, you’re limited to t1 battleships and t2 cruiser weapons. Alphas (non omegas) can do a lot, but eventually they will become cramped by their skillpoint cap and limits of what they can use.
---
you can buy and sell characters (not accounts) so if he transfers them to you the legitimate way and pays the fee to transfer them, then it won't get flagged as a violation of the eula.
---
Evasion should be dual prop with ecm burst and 4 warp core stabs

they still hit, and they still do damage, unlike medium ac's

Do you think they could make a floating nyx? Maybe take pre-orders to have enough initial funding.

Omg. I forgot about that.

I remember setting my alarm clock to go off at 2am on work days to make sure I loaded up the next skill level in cruisers.

Assuming the ships are fitted for scanning &amp; hacking, the “foodchain” of what dies to what in a theoretical 1v1 situation is the following:
---
T2 Scanning (Covert Ops) Frigates &amp; Intercetpors fitted for Scanning/Hacking  
---
will die to:  
---
T1 Scanning Frigates  
---
Bombers (assumed to be always fitted for pvp, not for exploration)  
---
Astero  
---
Other Asteros fitted purely for combat (e.g. with an Energy Neutralizer instead of a Probe Launcher, no hacking but E-War modules) and everything bigger than a frigate that manages to lock you up before you can warp.
---
Your decision depends on your philosophy: If you want to be able to chase other explorers out of the site or even kill them, go for a combat fitting. If you don't want to be able to fight other explorers, go for the  faster fitting.
---
My Astero has quite a few killmarks from explorers who did not pay attention to dscan while hacking. 
---
It is close to the "Drone / Damage" one you have posted but has a Frostline-Hacking module freeing up a mid-slot that I use for a capacitor booster - means I can run my Armor Repairer longer than your fitting would be able to. I also use a MWD instead of a AB. If you would scram me back and burn away from me with your AB on, you could escape my Scrambler and warp off.
---
Who would win such a fight depends a lot on who keeps his cool (and does not assign his drones to a hacking can for example)  who makes less piloting errors or reacts faster and what the people involved have actually fitted.
---
When you get engaged in a site by a cloaky ship, the one flying this ship is usually convinced that he has good chances killing you. So if you fit for combat, you don't want to \*be engaged\* while hacking, but you want to have the option \*to engage\* yourself if you find a target that you are confident you can kill.
---
The warehouse is what happened last time (maybe not a full warehouse. But enough that they gave them to everyone at an eve Vegas one time)
---
&gt;Why should your ship be able to accurately scout the resists of a hostile just because it's an NPC? It doesn't make sense thematically.
---
it does not scout anything. It \*\*literally\*\* uses a database. The one that's installed with your game. That anybody can use.
---
You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and lie about their flair to get a rise out of someone?
---
it already did before.
---
I am not telling.
---
server crash
---
some epic rats have very spread damage types. eg the  "showtime" BS deal EM, kinetic, and explosive damage. you just spread out the resists.
---
not when the rats move faster than your drones.
---
elite rats give much more worthy salvage, and have access to commander loot table which includes nice items, like pithum a-type invul (1B worth) , core x-type 500mn, gist xype XLSB.
---
That would make the value of those item crash down very fast.
---
One is a PVE ship and the other is a PVP ship. The PVP ship is designed to kill things that are smaller than you, not defend yourself from things that are bigger than you. The best defense to the latter is staying cloaked and otherwise flying smart and undetected. The question you need to ask yourself is if you want to actually do exploration, or just kill and loot those who are doing exploration.
---
Praise bob.

It’s a lot of great data. You did a great job; I’ve already used it.

I've heard that allegedly the Mordu's Legion ships that spawn at Besieged Covert Research Facilities will actually do this; unfortunately I can't confirm the behavior.

Do you know any besides TDF?
---
huh?
---
thank you!
---
thanks
---
hopefully more armor fleets spring up :)
---
*shrug* you have slow low dps drones, they are what they are.
---
Thank you for the succinct explanation.
---
The question is always about opportunity cost. So what am I losing out on with one fit vs the other?
---
Will outfitting for purely exploration (no warp scrambler, no armor repairers) net me more ISK compared to a combat / exploration fit? From reading your explanation it doesn't seem so.
---
I guess the question is how much faster am I able to explore if I fit speed/scanning modules on the low/mid slots vs combat ones? I don't know the answer to that.
---
Example: Enemies Abound Level 4, the minmatar section. The advanced NPC's are vulnerable to explosive, as the standard list would suggest, but most of the other ships should actually have their shields killed by EM damage. Earlier in that chain, the gallente navy ships are inconsistent about whether kinetic or thermal works better- for part 3, the first pocket is kinetic, the second therm, because the different ship types in the pockets have different holes, and some of those ships have the shield hole as EM as well.
---
Less specifically, rogue drones are generally inconsistent about what they're weak to.
---
Those are just the ones that have come up for me this week, I'm sure there are others.
---
I sold mine a while back, C4 with C4 and C3 statics, had an athanor and two POSes, and a carrier inside, and most of the customs offices replaced. I think my buyer got a good deal at 5b, but I just wasn't playing enough and wanted a quick sale.
---
Feels like you were really rough on Matthew, /u/Jintaan.
---
Can you fit a combat astero with a data/relic hacker or is that going half way? Like can't you outfit it for mostly combat but still good enough to do exploration?
---
does it work for non pirate factions?
---
One more question ... if you are using scanner probes you will scan down the sites but never know if there are people there? So you are doing more location hunting and then if you happen upon someone you kill them vs combat scan probes which lose out on scanning site strength, but you use primarily for hunting? am i wording that properly?
---
Those still exist and have ok drops?
---
We really home sites for Corp.  All sabres were built in home to optimize savings.  People who had farm holes occasionally (optionally) donated a site to the SRP fund.
---
The TCU timer should also be set the the timer when the system is most used.

Number of jumps, people docked in space and also indexes.

Explorer-hunter bombers fit blasters and rockets, not torpedoes. 
---
Yes they're not bonused for it but the instant lock after decloak still makes it strong against covops and t1 explos. Astero would still shred a bomber tho if it's fit properly.

Yes! Cloaky dread with drone and scanning bonuses!

---
Iron Armada and Siege Green were not third party to this fight.
---
Siege green also planned to bring NMs to join with the panic+SF NM fleet but were camped on their WH by the DHSJ Drek's so had to reship to corms in order to get through and make it to the fight in at least something.
---
Edited per your comment
---
rogue drones are weak to EM, T2 to explo (like minmatar armor).
---
true, I've almost never played against empire ships so I had no idea the devs used real ships resistances for those missions.
---
For pure explo where you run away at the first sign of trouble it doesn't help. Covert ops frigates (Like the Buzzard, Probe and Helios but not the Anathema its terrible) end up being better because they are faster (8au/s warp speed vs asteros 5 meaning you can with a single hyperspatial rig be faster than hyperspatial dictors, your only real threat if you are paying attention) but because they are half the cost of an astero. 
---
Unless you are alpha (and can't cloak and use covert ops ships) then the Astero isn't a good choice either because the biggest upgrade it gives over T1 explo frigates is the covert ops cloak.
---
However a well fit astero can pretty easily do combat sites in hisec and lowsec. Run expeditions and DED 4/10 and occasionally 5/10 sites. You can make a fair amount of isk doing this and its easier to slip in and out of lowsec as an astero because of the very low time available to decloak you on a gatecamp.
---
Yes there is a lot to do in different levels. I

When CCP added low power mode to citadels, farming them in WH space was super profitable
---
Your sides are just completely wrong. It was snuff wangs and init against everyone, except maybe dhsj who might've shot some other people when they couldn't shoot snuff wangs init.
---
Definitely not. Old players will have more assets than you, which means there's more loot for you to take from them and as for their skill points you won't be fighting against a ship with 120+ million skill points behind it, as all skills don't affect on all ships.
---
What you'll be fighting against is player knowledge about ship setups, making money, using probes together with the dscanner to get a one hit probe scan, etc. And all of this can be learned by yourself, skill points merely makes these activities easier.
---
Find some friends. I'd recommend EVE University because they're unbiased other than other big starter groups that belong to one of the big 0.0 blocks, so you'll gain knowledge without having to take a stand against one group or the other. Or don't, it's a game, do whatever you want.

---
You can use that faction module that allows you to hack both relic and data sites with a single module, that's what a lot of combat explorers do, its expensive though and you trade a bit of hacking strenght.
---
what I used to do however was to simply have a mobile depot with me that would allow me to refit in case i was planning on going against another explorer, (for example if i saw an explorer in the area that i was in, i'd fit for combat and would and catch them) the mobile depot strategy also gives you the ability of giving you a safe place to hide your loot for combat, so that if you die, you won't lose everything you looted up until that point, and you can just come back afterwards in an interceptor and get your loot back.

SPACESHIP

Michael is a good man
---
The astero is nimble enough that fully fitted for combat with an active repair fit it's still capable of evading most attempts to kill it. While the pure exploration approach will make the exploration easier / quicker, you'll often be faced with the dilemma of another astero popping up momentarily on dscan, and being forced off sites.
---
The primary trade-off becomes slightly quicker all-round exploration vs forcing away other explorers. Personally I find there's more fun to be had with a combat fit, you lose few options but gain many (I even combat fit my imicus').
---
If you go the combat route, you'll find your most common enemy to be other asteros. Most other targets can be evaded. So your ideal combat fit is designed to kill other asteros. What's the best way to do this?
---
**The honourable astero vs astero 1v1**
---
The astero can fit a strong active or passive armor tank for a frigate, or be used as a passable shield+MWD kiter. However even with DDA's it's dps is quite poor, unlikely to be above 110-120 without severely compromising tank. This lack of dps is the weakness the astero has in astero-vs-astero combat.
---
Passive tank sucks because it impairs your mobility as well as your damage, while relying on getting through the likely active tank of the opponent. Avoid.
---
[Single rep](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54416567/) is most common, and a good all rounder, but even so you'll have at most 1 DDA, so your damage is still quite limited.
---
A good dual rep fit can feasibly tank a single rep astero for as long as it has cap boosters, making it another very solid approach.
---
Your lows should be a DDA + small rep or 2 small reps, at least T2 but with deadspace reps this approach really starts to shine, an EANM and a damage control. [A T2 + a SAAR](https://zkillboard.com/kill/65124601/) is another alternative with a bulky active tank for a cheap price, but needs more careful management of the SAAR to maximise the limited lifespan it's repping power.
---
The mids a warp scram and a web, again quality can pay dividends, allowing you to outrange the EWAR of cheaper fits. A cap booster and charges is preferable to passive cap modules, who don't really give enough for this application. MWD or AB to taste, an AB will help in these rep astero vs rep astero fights where you're both webbing and scramming, preventing one from escaping. MWD has more utility for escaping gatecamps and can safe your life against the rare shield kite astero (more later).
---
A standard covops cloak and probes in the highs.
---
Drones should mostly be faction to combine with the Drone HP ship bonus and get extra tracking since you'll 
---
likely have them targeted by other drones giving them longer time out before needing to recall.
---
**Shield Astero**
---
[This baby](https://zkillboard.com/kill/48507330/) can fuck you up if well piloted. It's a fit that sacrifices a lot more combat strength with a can analyser fitted but counters AB armor asteros hard. If you've got an MWD, slingshotting in and try to get a solid scram off or out to escape are your main options against one of these. It's a fit that needs more bling than armor and a lot more piloting skill to work, so not good for starting out.
---
**Other things to note**
---
Generally if you can create a situation where you've got a small neut instead of probes it massively swings the balance in your favour regardless of fits, so beware leaving someone time to re-fit after scanning down the site.
---
If you've got big balls (and/or wallet) fly a stratios and propely align out for every can. No other explorer is going to mess with you.
---
There are people who can talk you into donating all of your corp assets. This is a very dark and obscure art.
---
Contract it to WTB Killmarks for 195
---
How can we be sure this isn’t the doppelgänger?
---
Indeed, that is how I understood it.
---
I also think they did have a point because, if my information is correct, they each netted in the environs of 1 trillion ISK [an insane amount of money], which would definitely have triggered a crash.
---
Which, in my opinion, makes their effort quite sophisticated in that they kept that consideration into account while perpetrating the heist. I loved the artistry behind it. This is what makes EVE the insanely wonderful place it is.
---
For EVE to have its reputation it is required that somebody somewhere somehow pulls some kind of shenanigans. The fact that they planned for a year to steal a titan, that they saw alts coming for a returning titan pilot so that they could destroy his titan the moment he landed on grid, that they pull a stunt like FW heist, and countless more,  all those things need to happen because it’s EVE.
---
I was a fan of Erotica 1 because he managed to get a guy to hand over -all- his assets. I wasn’t taken with the out-of-client stuff which I think took it too far, but convincing a guy to hand over all his assets. That’s fucking brilliant. It’s bad but it’s fucking brilliant.
---
The time-honoured Goonswarm 500 million ISK scam, where people came mewling in the forums over: brilliant.
---
Helicity Boson’s Hulkageddon, fantastic!
---
All that stuff needs to happen by way of indication that you’re not dealing with your average asshole, you’re getting the cream of the crop.
---
I came in because I’d read about the caper with the titan. Someone steals an asset that is *insanely* expensive and when the complain about it the GMs say: didn’t abuse the EULA, didn’t abuse the client, only used game mechanics... they get to keep it. **WHAT!?!?!** I had to get me some of that. 11 years and counting.

When we updated the explosion a couple of years ago we made it so that which explosion you get is random from a selection of 3-4, some of which are more rare than others, the camera did it's special animation away from the exploding structure to your ship because you were "looking at" it at the time of the explosion starting and had "Dynamic Camera Movement" enabled.

To kill an orca, you need around 40 T2 gank catalysts. They can be harder to kill than a freighter. That's also assuming the guy doesn't just warp off when he sees 40 CODE people enter system. In a 0.7 system, you need around 70 catalysts and nearly 100 in 1.0. You're going to have a hard time mobilizing that many people to gank a single orca.

For future reference, you can back up your 2FA key by copying the account and key text it shows on the page below the QR image. There are desktop 2FA apps, so you don't even need a phone to generate the one-time code.

Yep, in my Astero, I usually fly combat fit, with a mobile depot with refit for combat probes (and power grid modules to fit it) and explo fit. If I scan down a system and find that it has a couple of relic/data sites, I refit into exploration, do the sites and refit back into combat.
---
You'd usually not use the combat probes to hunt explorers , you can use the dscan to figure out which site they are doing, warp to them cloaked, uncloak and blap them. I usually use the combat probes because I have friends down the chain that can help me kill something if I find something bigger than an explorer. I also have found a gecko that was completely abandoned, so I scanned it down with my combat probe.
---
The problem with the few vs the many was when skill injectors became a thing.  They boosted everyone up with the cash to the same level of sp  if the ‘elite’ alliances meaning any advantage they had with lesser numbers vanished,  such as when people would hire Mercs they  could turn up with like a 50 man t3 fleet which could back then make a difference now it’s a couple billion isk per member to have one and you used to see 250 man fleets of them,   Same applies to supers and titans PL/Nc used to have the advantage due to their highest SP which naturally meant more players able to use supers now you have every goon and his brother in one making he smaller groups which had the skill point advantage worse off in that regard.

Some emergent gameplay can still be see boosh fleets etc but the few vs the many is long gone we are currently in the age of titans

---
Don't try to explore with a hunting fit. At a minimum you're going to have one mid slot taken away from a good combat fit, which is where your web should go for range control.
---
My exploration fits are all MWD, cloak and alignment mods, the idea is if someone jumps me I can cloak up and burn away quickly, and then warp off.
---
What you can do is carry a depot and switch between them.

Why did SF take Nightmares in to fight Arty Machs? And why at range? You need about 70-80 NMs to volley slaves machs with standard / multifreq. You didn't have the adequate numbers or proper crystals loaded for this happen.
---
Furthermore, why are you flying single LSE NM's with target painters? 1400s can hit further than tachyons and you were still getting volleyed at range.
---
You MIGHT have a chance to kill some or all of snuff's web lokis if you cam figure-8 outside of their webs about 50km off and web/paint their lokis down. If their anchor is good, they will still manage to snap count and track you as your transversal decreases.

What system was the orca in? There might be 100 people in code chat, but at least half of them are AFK or doing something else. If the Orca is not in a 0.5 system, or a 0.6 system, you do not have enough people to do the gank.

However, the perpetrators of the heist can’t know that and they can’t run the risk that CCP, for whatever reason they do the things they do, were not using a 32-bit integer that has the classic limited version. Even Microsoft has run into issues with that and they’re supposed to know their own system [well, in theory].
---
It would have been ballsy as all get out for them to call a dev out, in whatever fashion they reach out to them and ask “This particular value, what kind of integer are you using for that?” Even CCP devs are not that stupid that they wouldn’t ask: what in the world do you need to know that for?

No. Character progression in terms of skill points used to be entirely time based, so that vets who'd always been training would always have more points than newbies. Since they introduced skill injectors you can buy PLEX using your credit card and sell the PLEX for ingame currency, which you can then use to buy skill injectors. You can still enjoy the game training normally, but basically nowadays your character progression is only limited by the amount of RL money you're willing to spend.

I loved it so much I sent them a hundred mil, and it's been in my bio ever since. Also note that is was pre-citadel back when mining wasn't done in rorqs.

Matthew Dust, Cornak, Insideous Sainthood, Blazing Bunny and myself are all candidates that represent lowsec. There are a couple others like Doris Andedarie and Crystalline Entity, but i haven't really heard much from them.
---
Bigger doesn’t not mean better in eve online. And don’t use something more expensive when something less expensive will get the job done just as well.
---
Hey remember when you fed gilas and your 3b tengu to us attempting to kite, I do.
---
What was the reason for that? oh right, you drove into our Dreks.
---
Sorry you got scammed, dude. BTW this is a fairly common scam on Steam. It involves the websites to which you've given access to your steam inventory. Like you've said, it automatically cancels the trade and recreates it with an account with an identical name. When you click to confirm,  you'll see that you're no longer getting anything in return. 
---
Did someone ask you to 'value' your items by logging into a site or similar? Either way, you need to reset your Steam API key and it'll sort it.
---
LOL!

Cruiser Solo PvP will hard to get engagements with. Good options would be the Rupture or STabber for Minmatar. Other good options are the Caracal, Moa, Vexor, Thorax and Omen (This is basicly any possibile T1 Combat Cruiser). They all have their strengths and can be good choices for different kinds of gameplay.
---
I wanted to sell a skin on a trusted site that I used with no problems, so not their fault or anything. But the trade was gonna be empty anyway.
---
The thing that bugs me is, that 2FA is supposed to guard users against exactly these kinds of attacks. I was told, that they hijack a session of yours and use that authenticated session to create the API key. They do not have full access to the account, as then my whole inventory would be missing. How this is possible is beyond me, also that I did not get notified that such a key was created is kinda weird as well. The attackers deleted their key though as there was none I didn't create myself. The fact that you can seemingly delete your old names from this dropdown menu kills the whole purpose of that function...
---
Remember that anything you fly is part investment and part consumable. It will probably get blown up at some point. 
---
If you can't afford to replace the ship you just lost, it's kind of a bummer. YMMV. Maybe a taste of the high life will give you something to work for afterward and actually make things more fun.
---
Other options for that windfall are:
---
- Start your trading career
---
- Use better modules/drones/ammo/whatever
---
- Have a backup (or two) of a less expensive ship so you don't have to hike back to Jita when you lose it
---
- Get a ton of cheap frigates and go nuts with PvP
---
- Space hookers
---
But in terms of power potential which one would be better, or which would be better for multiple rolls as im thinking of light PvP and protecting miners in low sec
---
LEGO does not want to be associated with space nerds :(  
---
I remember supporting that Rifter and being disappointed we didn't made it, even with 10k supporters. (Also holy, that was 2012, where did all those years go)
---
If you are wanting to stay in minmatar ships then it depends on how you were flying the trasher. If you were playing the kitey game then the next step is the stabber. If you were the brawling type then the rupture. If you are wanting ideas for these then YouTube is a great place to start. Just make sure you are familiar with what kind of ships you can fight against, based on what play style you have. Good luck and fly dangerously.
---
Thanks for the advice, based on your description I'll probably go for the rupture

A specific video that could help would be Zarvox's rupture video. YouTube it and it will come up

It depends. Both, the cruiser or a battlecruiser will get destroyed if the hostiles bring a lot of ships. You alone in a cruiser or a battlecruiser doesn't make a difference. Ask what your corpmates are flying and fly the same thing with them to defend your mining op.

There have been years and years of scandals involving steam scams, especially with csgo skins. Valve is not known for their positive customer support, so I'm not gonna try and argue otherwise, but there have been concrete reasons why they don't budge much on scams that happen on their platform for several years now.

Doesn't make it less true that ccp is "better" about that, but remember if you think about the idea of scamming on a platform... Is it really ccp you want to compare valve to on that? Seems kind of weird.

It is possible to create changes that can benefit all players. You can have changes targeted at different demographics and nobody is denying that player introduction and retention (keeping newbies) is very important.
---
My point still stands, vets understand how to make changes better than CCP at this point. Whether those changes are aimed at new or old just depends on specifying the target demographic.

it's incredible how you managed to not understand every point that didn't involve hisec

Draw a sansha titan :P

I’d draw it...

Yep, those are the only ones. We don’t mine anywhere else so don’t even bother checking the rest of Eso.
---
You're the reason it works. people simply don't understand killrights.
---
The breakdown is I perform a criminal action against my own character and that gives me a killright against my own alt which I can then make available publicly. then if anyone buys the killright I get the isk and they get to kill an empty hauler.
---
I've had a lot of people get themselves concorded because they think my orange icon and low sec status means they can kill me without paying. Then I can sell their killright too :)

ALWAYS ask the FC first though.

these do need looking at, the barrier for them being impossible to keep alive against someone who is capable of walking and breathing at the same time should be above a ratting carrier. Moving 90% of their EHP into shields and armor with decent resists would be a great change.

Of course we sent rlml caracal fleet with hyneas but they just got kited

They did a great job locking my old account for 4 months thinking that it was stolen and then refused to give it back at the 6 month mark, and telling me that I have to stop asking them after i asked twice in 2 months. Not to mention all of my tickets took 2 weeks to even get a response

Have you tried to fit an Expanded Probe Launcher to your Astero? (You can launch Core and Combat Probes from the Expanded Probe Launcher but the Core Probe Launcher can not launch Combat Probes)
---
You will see why it's very impractical to do on ships with no role bonus for it (like T3 Destoyers and Cruisers have it) or ships that are dedicated just for this single task. I can be done on an Astero, but you will need a lot of fitting ressources just to get the ability to use Combat Probes, that your ship won't be very good for any other task aymore. 
---
So how do you know there might be someone in the site you scan down with a regular Core Probe Launcher?
---
You learn how to use your directional scanner. Have a filter for it showing ships, core scanner and combat probes. If you haven't looked into that yet, I strongly recommend to do it rather sooner than later. If you do exploration outside of highsec, it will safe your ship. I have doubts you have realized that yet, when I look at your killboard. But don't worry, death is part of the learning curve in Eve. But I also want to stress it again: Learn how to use and read your dscan, and you will lose less ships.
---
P.S.: Always cloak when you can. Not to be seen is the big advantage of every covert ops ship.
---
It's because of stations in the system that never got removed and influence the system with last known ADM at time of removal until today.

And yes. One low nano and speed tanking Kiki's to reduce sig is pretty much a huge part of the nano concept fit.

And as I said, response defense fleet. Fc formed in a rush. Not expert Command destro for good booshs.

FW, second fastest would be sisters of Eve epic arc.  Third would be level 4 missions (only storyline missions will give you faction standing increase).

You cant rep the 10k shield/armor when a super vollies it off in 1 shot and bleeds structure. Have you even used an inhib?
---
Weve had cases with 3-4 logi on an inhib and a super vollies through it.
---
Also, anyone whos not afk will cyno before the inhib goes online. Once the cyno is up, it doesnt matter if the inhib is online, things can still jump through. Which means the inhib isnt doing what its name suggests. It should turn off the cyno once online, just like a scram turns off an mwd immediately.

I never said it was, I have no problem with cloaky ships being able to gather intel on their targets. I have a problem with cloaky camping being risk free.
---
&gt;Your issue isn't the discrepancy of the hunter risk or Intel. You want the privilege to effortlessly know there is no active player who can pose you a threat in the solar system you are krabbing. Local already almost gives you that if it was not for afk campers. And that's why you have grown entitled to that privilege.
---
My issue is that you are claiming to want to implement risk free gameplay while proposing nerfs to defence that means that whalers such as yourself are able to whale risk free. I never said anything about local either, I fully agree that local shouldnt be an intel tool and I never said anything to contrary.

&gt; The thing that bugs me is, that 2FA is supposed to guard users against exactly these kinds of attacks. I was told, that they hijack a session of yours and use that authenticated session to create the API key. They do not have full access to the account, as then my whole inventory would be missing(Nvm I thought about it and now I get it, I would have to confirm that trade, that's why). How this is possible is beyond me, also that I 
---
Yeah. They don't have access to your inventory, but they do have control over your trades (except for the manual confirmation/2FA). They're banking on you not noticing that the trade you're 'confirming' is actually a new trade, to a BOT account with the same name as the intended recipient. 
---
By the way, this may still be happening as it affects ALL trades while the attacker has access to your API. To test it, try to trade a 0.03c skin to a friend of yours on Steam - when you go to confirm it, double check the account it's going to. Is it the right account?
---
Again, the only way to fix it is to reset your Steam API and be VERY careful with the sites you provide access. Hope this helps in some way!
---
Used to wage a one-man war against these kinds of scammers and phishers, and learned a lot about how they operate. From what you've written it doesn't sound like they hacked your account, it sounds more like they either imitated a bot from the site you use, or hacked one of their bots. If they hacked you, you would be notified; the exception to this being they found a way to bypass Steam's security features, like tricking you into disclosing your username, password, and Steam Guard code. A VPN can be used to fake access from your location to trick Steam into thinking you're the one logging in if they have all three.

It has been a long time since I've needed to use the Steam API for anything, but unless they've changed it in the past few years you require the ability to log in normally before you can access the ability to bypass 2fa. If they somehow gained this power over your account, they would be able to create and accept trades without needing you to confirm on your phone. Given the fact your account both still has some items and Isn't currently outside your possession, I doubt that your account was hijacked. Most methods of hijacking turn off your Steam Guard as well, and rely on you not responding for however long they need, which is usually 15 days due to trade holds unless they've really planned in advance. (Hold times decrease to 1 day if you've been friends with the recipient for a year.)

From my own experience with hijacking, Valve responds very quickly, and access has always been regained within 48 hours.

The proposal came from the FW discord. The proposals you quoted are more so to stop plex bots. I haven't updated that part of my site since I put it on there and I'm open to any proposals that accomplish the same thing but without stifling content.

If you’re a fan of PvP I’d hit up Sin Alarma or Sephie, biggest baddest MFers in that entire time zone
