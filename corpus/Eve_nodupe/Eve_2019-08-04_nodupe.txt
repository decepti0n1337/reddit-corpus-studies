Yes the crime system has no incentive to make bounty hunting worth while. Also it's very difficult. They stay docked till they have a target that's on grid and usually staying in one spot. So the time where you can hunt them is between them undocking and warping to 0 with their scout. Funnily enough it's more risk averse than the miners cause they aren't risking anything of value to accomplish their goal
---
Ah, but depending on subsystems, the ship may *look* like a potato
---
&gt; in wormholes the number of ships you can bring is a matter of some concern.
---

---
Except this was used for home defense...
---
I don't think you can carry isk in your cargo.
---
To clarify for anyone reading this, you can get a *shield* bhaalgorn to be cap stable with 7 neuts and hg talismans.
---
Great description, thank you.

My use case is that I have a small sp farm (a little over 60 characters), so I'm buying plex from buy orders and selling injectors to sell orders.  So I'm hit by both of the "order" sides of things.  So it looks like when I'm selling injectors I'll pay tax and broker fee, but when I'm buying plex I'll only be paying broker fee.  I'll need to calculate out what my actual tax/broker fees are, since I'm &gt;+9 to Caldari and &gt;+9 to Caldari Navy and have perfect trading skills.  Then I'll figure out what I'll be paying at TTT, and make a decision based on how bad the delta is.
---
Thanks for the great explanation Zifrian.
---
So I’ve made a couple eve song parodies in my free time, and was thinking of the saying “if you like something, don’t do it for free”. Would there be any sorta market or audience that would be willing to pay for a decently made song about them? What do y’all think a fair price would be?
---
Probably not. But if you make a decent video and plug your character for donations you might get some.
---
Yeah, I see that I did not make myself entirely clear on multiple occasions here.
---
Yes, ratting is generating isk in it's purest form, since you get a direct layout into your wallet.
---
But I do see mining as something that is generating isk, too. It's in the form of the minerals you get from mining, since they do have an actual in-game value and can be sold on the market.
---
I say that it is generating isk, because you can sell minerals that just respawn in a belt after the next downtime. 
---
There is no finite amount of minerals that can possibly be mined (because belts and anomalies respawn). If that were the case, the isk would always be in the system, and you would just change it's form. But since the minerals respawn and can be mined over and over and over again in the same belt, can mining is generating isk (in my opinion)
---
Best option is 1 extractor, max heads, 8-9 production, 1 storage, 1 launchpad. Move P1 to another planet to make into other shit. Set cycle to however much time you want to pay attention to it.
---
Very nice video and solid piloting. I notice that you did favour the beam slicer over pulse even though you did use it.
---
I’ve recently been using a faction gun pulse slicer which is really solid. Faction guns consume less cap and have more range, you can hit to almost 28k optimal with synth frentix while having excellent cap compared to a beam slicer. Something you might want to consider.
---
Do starting tutorial. Go to https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents and do career missions. From there focus on what you want to focus on. Disregard joining corp for a few weeks at least, otherwise you'll get sucked into what they want, not what you want.
---
It doesn't really matter, outside of limited RP that very few do. Any pilot can fly any ship into any territory.
---
Most are yes. But some are not. And this video so happens to not show most of the gatecamps. And only the some that are abled to be engaged.
---
Do people fall for this scam?
---
Why TF would you even suggest something like that??? They cannot even fix the chat system. It still fucked up, why you think they can inplement a thing like this without breaking more?
---
Pick what background lore or character look you like the most. Beyond that it's meaningless unless you WANT for it to have meaning.
---
ahahahaaqa
---
Yes, this would be the best option 8 production from raw to P1 from 4 different planets. Take P1 to a fifth planet to make 2 kinds of P2 and all that into P3.
---
caldari are the enemy
---
Lol no
---
He was single cycling out our bhaals, so it definitely wasn't doing jack shit.
---
All of the empires are fucked up in their own ways, there's a good thread on the eve-online forums started by /u/jintaan that has responses from various players about why each empire is bad.   
---
If you're interested in roleplaying/fiction in eve-online, you can join the [RP discord server](https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf) and I'm sure someone will be very quick to tell you why Caldari/Gallente are scum :P
---
It doesn't matter, it's grimdark. Just pick the one you like, they're each the most moral from a certain perspective.
---
Out of curiosity, why do you care about the fictional moral perspective of the fictional character you play?
---
dodging lances are always the most thrilling thing about subcap fleets v cap/super blobs
---
even cool to watch it from the super pov
---
It doesn’t matter at all really. But gallente ships are great for ratting usually, and gallente industrials are something you’ll eventually train anyway. So why not start out with a head start and go gallente.
---
Alternatively Caldari if you want to start out life near Jita.
---
Caldari morality is guided by meritocracy and the "for the need of the many" mentality. Gallente morality...is basically "anything goes" as long as it's not a crime or slavery.
---
With a fax and fighters on grid? What good will bombers do? Lmao
---
Other sinks are buying insurance, buying npc orders and biomassing toons which is more common than you might think, at least till recently before the blackout. I know a few highly invested people who biomassed quite large sums.
---
You could try (gasp) adapting.
---
A ratting fit designed to escape or to survive long enough for backup to arrive instead of a paper tanked dps isk printing machine and/or insured t1 hulls, nonfaction drones to reduce loss in case of unfortunate pewpew.
---
Or you could just make an explo alt and earn like 150m an hour actively instead of ratting for 2 hours.
---
Eve should have season ladders. Each season a new task. Season 1 mine the most mercoxit. Season 2 build the most Lifs. Season 3, collect the most Wallymarts corpses.
---
LMAO
---
Here is a step by step guide I recommend:
---
1. Start out salvaging level 4 missions in the major mission hubs. You can ask in local and people will fleet invite you. Very easy to make a few hundred mill within a few hours.
---
2. From there, start to invest in the market by trading anything but t2 items.
---
3. As you build your investments, you can run incursions and make a few hundred mill an hour. All money flows back into the market.
---
4. Within 6 months, you learn how to properly trade, you'll be able to plex your account indefinitely.
---
Source: Myself
---
Not only highsec planets are generally very poor,  
---
  
---
but also there is also a high concentration of players too lazy to move away from trade hub.
---
add the blue loot from NPC.
---
thank you. yea, the beam one does better vs dictors and t3ds although it does have issues tracking non ramming AFs and ceptors. never really thought about using faction guns since it's a cheap, disposable fit but i'm pyfa-ing it right now. pretty sure i'll try it sometime since the guns are affordable, thanks for the tip
---
I only see 3 and they all point in the same direction...?
---
That's why I'm asking, because I want to adapt and from what I've seen ratting fits don't stand a chance regardless of how tanked they are. This would especially be the case if you don't want to reduce your applicable DPS to rats to the point where ratting isn't worth the ISK/hr. I haven't dove back into the game and don't really want to put a ton of time into trial and error.
---
Thanks for the input, though!
---
For some odd reason I think he's trying to imply that you didn't 'dodge' the lance because of the fact that 8 bombers were hit.
---
Excuse you I requested sweet and sour sauce for mine.
---
That's pretty interesting, actually. Last time I had tested it, the capital neut barely touched the battleship I was targeting, even with some target painters. Maybe I'll have to reinvestigate some of the stats.
---
For the sake of science, was he using 1 neut per ship or stacking them?
---
Not sure, the bhaals were nos fit so they weren't having a huge problem with it. Remember pulsar gives a big sig increase as well.
---
Stop. Don’t give CCP any ideas.
---
He plays ark.
---
no, losing.
---
adaptive nano platings take only 1 pg dunno what the other guy is on about lol
---
maybe check their resistances again, if its not resistances i just cant see how faction can be better otherwise- no long skill train required for t2 anp either, and even then there is the meta anp which is the same as t2 anp
---
ELITE
---
This is a feature, new chaos era.
---
Embrace the mistakes...i mean chaos
---
I can remember ccp showing something about insurance and it showed that it's a faucet because it pays out more isk in general then is being paid for it. Even when lots of insurance contracts expire.
---
Both of your first statements are clearly not true. A response fleet that ignores an identified proven threat 24/7 until they destroy something, then ignores them again is hardly a response fleet. it doesn't respond to an attacker, it merely slaps them on the wrist after they've been allowed to do their thing. Piloted subcaps die to blaster gankers all the time, clearly showing they are a big threat and concord does nothing to stop it. The only reason it doesn't happen as often as it could (eg mission ships getting ganked) is because freighters are a far more easy target and have predictable locations to find them.
---
You're also suggesting someone should dualbox an alpha clone noobship, as if this is normal (and not against eve's EULA) and apparently expect them to keep said alt on grid at all times.
---
THe metric of risk i generally go by is the level of actions needed to know about/avoid dying to a threat and how much you can stop an approaching threat from killing you. Wormholes are by far the least safe in this regard, as you constantly need to be doing a lot to try and get some level of safety (and then still have no assurance there's already something inside, watching and waiting). Highsec bars you form being able to do anything to stop an approaching threat and said threat can freely gather intel on you with alts, you being unable to know or do anything about it. 30-37 seconds of being allowed to bash a target with an unlimited number of ships (typically alts) means anyone could be ganked at any time and the mechanics won't allow it to be avoided.
---
Then there's null as it was before, where a player in a big bloc could simply have NEAR on and be in intel channels and all they had to do was dock if they got the automated warning. Should they be in a capital, even if they fail to get to safety they can use a cyno and have the defense fleet still save them. Unless the player went AFK, ignored the warning or was unlucky to have attackers appear in system via a wormhole and found them before they managed to dock, null in big blocs had almost automated safety.
---
Alphas are almost just as potent as omegas in pure PvP below battleship hulls/weapons. Their main restrictions are T2 hulls and industry/mining/etc.
---
Warm bodies are always welcome in a corp, especially if they're fun and friendly.
---
There is currently a nullsec local blackout, local works like wormholes right now. Other stuff you can catch up on as you go.
---
We dont need no stinking server permits
---
True it probably is a net faucet I don't doubt it. But buying it is one of the very limited number of sinks.
---
I look forward to seeing these on/after 31 August
---
&gt; which empire would you guys say is the most "moral" one?
---
Gallente are the only democracy.  There's your answer.
---
You could try setting up in lowsec, but it is a pain in the butt. You have to find planets with low tax pocos, and the only way to do that is check the pocos manually, the upside is that there is no NPC tax.
---
The setup I would use for single character is 4x p1 planets feeding into a p1--&gt;p3 factory planet. The p3 will be much lower volume to transport to a trade hub. As for transporting it to the tradehub, I would move the p3 out of lowsec myself then contract a hauler, I got sniped by a tornado once holding about 400m in PI materials bound for Jita which was quite a lot for me at the time.
---
That's sickening.
---
Say that to the guy who lost 128 large injectors in a .6 system.
---
Belt ratting should be done in destroyers. They have the best speed and dps while being able to sig tank fairly effectively.
---
Level 3s are generally done in battlecruisers. The Stabber is actually closer to a heavy frigate than a cruiser. Gnosis is slow on grid but has great agility so it enters warps quickly. Since the Gnosis is such a flexible hull, I'd need to know what weapons you'd want or what kind of tank etc. You could also just use your racial battlecruiser which I assume is minmatar, which would be the Hurricane.
---
Yep. It seems like the combination of the massive neut/nos bonus and the sig radius increase gets it up there. Wormholes are wack

Back in the burning crusade days in wow there was this "virus" going around that changed the realmlist file to a different adres. So you would type in your account name and PW. And then the authenticator code and it was all send to the other side where they would log into the account at the same time.

Wack is best :)

Skill book are a very big isk sink.

All empires have shades of grey, even Gallente

Google search “Karmafleet”. You will thank me later.

If you find a ok tax rate you can buy p2/p3 and process it to P4 and sell for a profit.
---
Don't worry.  When I joined the recruiter added a note: "suspicious".   My life in a nutshell.
---
Lose the shield extender and go for a large shield booster and boost amp II. Invuln and em ward field. Hams all day. The strength of the tengu for ratting is the crazy shield boost. I don't have access to pyfa atm it I would share a ful build. Get large shield booster + amp that is cap stable and you can rock a c3 with some careful management with T2 mods. If you want real survivability, you have to bling. X-type large shield booster, c-type invuln and em ward. With perfect skills you can hit 23k ehp, solid tank, and 800 dps
---
Your access chance is too low compared to the wreck's access difficulty. Improve your chance to salvage wrecks by using a ship with salvage *chance* bonus or improving through skills, rigs, and/or t2 modules.
---
Kill the fighters, Kill the Fax, Kill the dreads.. so on... at least thats what we do idk
---
Bizarre question here.  Can 5 accounts in leshaks kill a sotiyo? Assuming there is no resistance from enemy fleets or the structure itself.
---
After the boosh, behind and above us, a titan fires off in a random direction
---
You can still ratt and mine in peace in null sec space.
---
Right at the end as they boosh one starts spooling his up the wrong way
---
An MJD or single warp core stabilizer allows you to escape warp disruptor hunter fits. Defensive neuts in high slots and/or webs can force off brawlers or make it harder for them to keep up. An active fit can temporarily overheat to improve their defense. ECM drones can be a last-ditch dice roll.
---
Because people have become so reliant on local and intel to bug out, there's not as much established practice in terms of fits. I could build you one but I'm not at my computer rn.
---
You need to update your java runtime environment.
---
Orca first, so you can earn isk for the Raitaru; the other way around it'll take longer.
---
I think high sec griefing is supposed to be a part of the game, but I think it's just balanced to be much to in favor of the attackers. If you want to blast the good people of high sec, ok fine, but you should have to use a T2 big boy ship and not a catalyst. Want to ninja? OK, but at least stay on grid for a minute so the other guy at least has a chance to shoot a little.
---
I don't have any racial battlecruiser skills so far. Atm I'm training into gallente cruiser 4 and probably if I must, will get gallente battlecruiser as my drones skills are 100% fully maxed (for an alpha).
---
I was hunting around yesterday and many say the vexor can lvl 3/belt rat fine. 
---
I've built myself a 100mn ab vexor fit with about 60km drone range, 60km lock, 1000m/s, 16k ehp, 300 dps (using 2 heavy, 2 med, 1 light drone), it's also cap stable with the ab running and an auto targeting unit. (it's also running med remote armor rep and a shield booster) 
---
I don't have the fit Rn on me but I'll post it up soon.
---
As for the gnosis. My fit has been med rails, with about 500dps and 50k ehp.
---
It's very slow and speed tanking is impossible in it. And so much time is wasted through moving around the battlefield to objectives as well as in warp (as I'm chaining several fw lvl 3 missions).
---
So basically I'm trying to find a faster solution that is reasonably fast and can speed tank lvl 3 and belts.
---
if overheat damage was temporary that would be one thing, but you are talking about something that can disable modules completely in a fight and cant be fixed without docking up or swapping out the modules. this would be ridiculously broken.
---
Naw this is the best mmo out there with hands down the most passionate community
---
“Hunters” aka players that kill boneheaded pve players
---
You can sell your orca to a hauler for some good isk in Jita.
---
Culture.
---
I have drones skills fully maxed for an alpha (T2 lights, faction Meds, faction heavies).
---
The vexor fit has about 16k ehp and 1000m/s with ab. Has about 300 dps when running 2 heavies, 2 Meds, 1 light. 
---
It's capstable with auto targeting system and ab running.
---
It also has a med remote rep and a shield booster and is shield tanked.
---
I've got all of the 14 except shield operations (at 2), hull upgrades (at 4) and mechanics (at 4).
---
&gt;Big blocs can happen in NPC Null and Lowsec, but generally do not probably due to lack of resources to support such a base, especially with no i-hubs. 
---
Technically true but nobody has had any reason to. Neither offer the high reward of sov null. In lowsec, there's stations that offer unlimited, uncounterable staging to all of eve. Can't bubble the undock, instawarp bookmarks allow players to undock and move out from the station, jump freighters + interceptors/medical clones allow entry from outside players to ships and fittings. Any big bloc could be locked down from an area with no easy counter other than camping the station and waiting. As a result, a big "bloc" as exists in null, in lowsec, would have glaring holes in any defense they could possibly form, which can be exploited by anyone. It can't really happen because of that.
---
&gt;What do you think of Providence?
---
Providence is interesting. It's not a huge power like the big blocs and allows any non-enemy to enter their space. Their space, even before blackout, was hardly something you could consider safe so the risk/reward in providence seems like it was far more towards how things should be than, say, delve. You'd have to be actively looking at local, checking people's KOS status (manually, on CVA's site) if they showed up and the many that weren't in the list would be personal decision. They could be fresh alts, scouts for an enemy. They could be new to the area. They could be just out for some easy kills and not been in providence before.
---
&gt;Way before my time, but seem like at this time 4 mega coalitions became 3 then became two.
---
When you read up on large wars in the past, you can't forget that that's not *everything* that happened. During those big wars of the past, smaller groups were usually still doing their thing, fighting amongst each other or poking into space controlled by bigger entities. In the times of the very old wars, there was no such thing as "just cyno up and drop a super on it". If a player was caught in their bloc's space, unless there were defenders ready to strike back at the attackers, they couldn't do a lot about them. They'd have to form a fleet, travel there and fight subcap vs subcap.
---
In today's null though, there's really not that much outside of the largest coalitions. They have easily 80% or more of the total null players and anyone stepping on their lawn can be taken out easily; many subcaps countered with a single super. If one of the rare wars happens now, not much else can really happen in null, nobody can take advantage of the attackers being "away from home" and having lowered defenses because they still hold overwhelming power over any smaller entity, able to project it at any moment with basically no cost or risk. Players in those blocs have, as i described, high safety because of this presence, by no action of their own.
---
Of course, currently there's blackout. It remains to be seen if this will shake things up from the above description in the long term. For a good idea of why i stated there would only be one group in all of null working together; look at the perimeter trade structures. They're co-owned by goons, pandemic horde, test. The reason? Well, there's isk to be had and they got tired of fighting over it since that costs isk. That kind of absurdity has never happened before in eve; different groups, enemies, just deciding not to fight for the sake of easy income. This is just a sign of what will continue happening if the null blocs stay on the course they're on. Wanting minimum risk and maximum income means no PvP (outside of dogpiling in an assured victory) and stopping PvP near your sources of income.
---
I think it's totally fsir to make changes I steps, though.
---
I've felt like that title goes to INIT. Fought several groups but INIT's boosh-using comps feel the best executed. Great boosh accuracy and discipline and they really get value out of booshes generally.
---
You really don’t know lol
---
The answer is always amarr.
---
If I had to (as I kind of recently did)
---
I'd do fw missions.
---
I reactived one character and had enough for a tengu.
---
Ran a few missions, plexed another tengu pilot. Ran more missions and plexed a market character, ran a few more missions, plexed another tengu.
---
Ran a few more missions, lost a loaded 9b blockade runner, lost 4 Tengus and a Loki, bought an orca and Providence, and now have 18 bil isk in the bank.
---
This was in about 6 weeks without playing every day.
---
Double faction scrams, web, rocket bomber.
---
Nano basically never increase align time over the istab
---
Dang, that sounds good then. Lately I've been working 6 days a week and I'm a UPSer, so it's only going to get worse the closer to Christmas we get, haha
---
Does this mean just warping to every asteroid belt and hoping a "rare spawn" is there instead of the usual single crappy frigate?
---
&gt; with ships that require 5M SP and cost 60M isk
---
its pretty funny how the people who know absolutely nothing about roaming are the ones who tend to speak the louder about what it is. a mid grade pod costs more than you carrier buddy, and they're pretty much mandatory))
---
This is pretty accurate; Supers around here are typically just used for ganks or goofing around since the space simply isn't valuable enough to warrant large amounts of pve players that need saving.  Provi itself could use a defensive umbrella but inevitably someone would just bait it out and kill it.
---
I'm not entirely certain but i'd be willing to bet that at minimum 75% of income for our membership comes from piracy rather than any sort of pve.
---
Yeah the guns aren’t really expensive, you add maybe 10mil or so to the fit. My recent losses of the fit were 30 mil which is hardly breaking the bank for such an awesome upgrade. You do lose a little bit of dps

Farmholes, the meta that the rest of wormhole space figured out long ago.
---
Buy cheap upgraded bpcs on contract in jita. It will save you time and isk.
---
It really does give those vibes, eh?
---
New players can upgrade to Omega for 50% off within the first couple days after account creation.
---
The weird thing is that they seem to come in bursts. You'd expect maybe every couple hours or so, but I won't get any for a few hours and then *BAM* a dozen or so back to back to back. Due to the duration of the offer though I only have to deal with it for a couple days (or cave and upgrade to Omega).
---
&gt;minmattar are terrorists
---
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
---
That's awesome. Thanks!
---
Not sure why you want gankers to use t2 ships, like that they only way to get that done is by nerfing the damage on all the t1 hulls something that will negatively impact the whole game to solve a niche problem. ( t2 ships tend to not have more flat damage ). 
---
Honestly when on my ninja toon nothing makes me happier then you shooting me it means I get to kill your mission ship in a t3c.
---
This makes sense
---
This is nice. There is a delayed aspect, but i don't have to wait to check out my kills on zkill.
---
Nice!
---
What is this heresy. This is absolutely ridiculous . I protest this with all the might of the things on the internet. This must not stand..... /s
---
Why no fits posted in this topic are attainable because either CPU or Powergrid (regardless of skills or implants)? One above fits with an EG-603 implant...
---
One Here
---
this reduces how easy it is to find content you know? will be impossible to third party  fights from zkill
---
&gt;mid grade pod
---
Fucking poors and their cheap mid-grade pods.
---
Man that first fight against the garmur was hard to watch. A lot of wasted time because you chose to click+approach the garmur, causing you to miss a lot of shots. With dual web + scram + AB you have perfect range control, try and get a bit of range so you can just volley through stuff.
---
Adapt or... be bored?
---
We just had nidhoggur escape our initial tackle because he was stabbed and I felt sick
---
Or find another kb :p
---
A hack like that is totally different than getting your email or account hacked. Its getting your machine pwnd.
---
This is great, well done man!
---
Please.....he won't shutup about the lack of competition on Tweetfleet. I beg of you.
---
just gonna adapt by sitting in station instead of third partying fights because i don't know there happening
---
#YES PLEASE SOMEBODY ELSE MAKE ANOTHER KILLBOARD!
---
I'm serious, maybe I'm doing this shit to piss off someone enough to actually make another killboard, did that ever occur to you?
---
Search the in game map for fights, there used to be a filter to show ships destroyed in the last 30-60 minutes right?
---
No, it didn't. Why do you want that?
---
Unless you're looking into mass production, BPOs are not advised. Make sure you have access to ore compression, it's easier to move and will net you more money. Prioritize the structure if you don't have easy access to a citadel that allows this, otherwise get yer orca
---
Anything goes unless you want freedom for your state.
---
Then the Federation is gonna sack your Homeworld.
---
Exactly lol
---
KILL ALL THE MINERS
---
it was not even close to the level of citadels
---
PVP players don't understand what doing work is. More at 11
---
Should be CCP doing this and reducing the free intel spat out by esi's.
---
Nothing is forcing him to keep zkill up. If he wanted to stop he could just stop. You're kind of retarded.
---
Because EveKill and Battleclinic both shutting down sucked. And there hasn't been any competition since 2014. Back in 2014 I opened up my API so _anyone_ can get _all_ the killmails that zkill has, hoping to promote competition.
---
Competition is good. I'd like to see other killboards out there. *And*, I'm willing to help those potential sites with any questions they have and provide my experience. Some have started, but no one has finished yet.
---
Everyone assumes (wrongly) that I want to be the only killboard. I've been doing killboards for 10 years now, one day I might want to retire and me shutting down will screw everyone over if there's no one else.
---
#So, someone else make another killboard. Please?
---
ah yes the map which updates every 30 mins and shows high kills only once a lot of ships are dead aka the fights already over
---
I am Caligulas and I approve this message. 
---

If I had any plans. 
---
I don't think I do.
---
Okay but why is competition good when there's one product that already works great? I mean, do you want motivation to improve zkill or do you just want to teach people?
---
That is exactly how competition works. It promotes innovation.
---
Yes, Sherlock. That is why I asked the question.
---
You wouldn't see the note. Nice flex attempt though!
---
Awesome Squizz !

with one account you can generate 3.5B in PI with a correct setup in null 15 min a day 1h every week,  3 months of training for the PI across all three char and 2 hours of training for the PI skills (from someone who knows how to do it). consistency to log in every day is all you need 99% risk free and 500M startup cost .   
---
pay for the first 4 months and you will never have to pay again unless you want to . 
---
downside is logging in is like going to a job , upside is you can afford toys and you get to pew pew.  
---
i mined ice in highsec for 5 years before i found null so i have wells of patience that many dont.
---
Maybe he is sick of being the primary killboard resource for this whiny ass community.
---
Yes, competition is great for innovation, as well as having someone around in case I get hit by a bus.
---
The software for zkill is open source, anyone can start it up. However, I won't be handing the keys over to anyone. People have trusted me with them, and me giving them away would violate that trust. Plus, probably against some TOS too.
---
Agreed.
---
Whole 4 years before you then. What took you so long to join your favorite goons then? Or you alt is your reddit handle, same as for most of us? And for the first few years you just ignored all the bad rep goons acquured in spades?
---
And I did name those instances numerous times. You know perfectly well what happens. People start quoting rewritten history back at ne. Sometimes about myself, not realising it. I can, sure.  And the  you will do the same thing every other goon does. Either start repeating made up lies back at me, or just claim "you know nothing".
---
For example that time goons supposedly "punished" IRC for "attacking" their allies RA by stealing a lot of assets. Oh wait, the theft had nothing to do with goons? Too late,  mitts claimed it. And we won't even go into who and why started the whole war, framing both sides and eventually killing off RA and then IRC and clearing dronelands for good old mitts' friend uaXDeath...
---
Or that time goons pretended to defend PL against IT, sending token t1 fleets to help out while PL lost titans trying to hold off the tide. But as soon as the outer regions fell, run away without a fight. Run under the old NC wing, receiving an entire new region to settle in, promising mutual help in an invasion. Oh, invasion is by old goons friends XDeath? Ok, we'll send a few token t1 fleets while NC loses titans trying to hold off the tide, and then make piece with the winning side judt as NC is looking for somewhere to retreat to. And, I quote "finish off those idiots" okd NC down south. Not leaving any witnesses I guess? A year later the winning side is no longer allied with XDeath? Time to take all their stuff.
---
Whatever happened when former goons allies Test began trouble down south. I missed that, so, no clue how open and honest that was.
---
The entire c02 issue, goons rewriting history and blaming the victims only to make themselves look better.  Making up and then repeating again and again incredibly far fethched theories just to prove the newly made up history. To the point that even those who know the truth start thinking "thousand goons seem know more than I do about what I did a few years back, where is the truth?". And then almost every ally they had either collapsing or leaving, because "fuck goons".
---
Renaming an entire conflict to press in the "official position" of goons not being the bad guys. Not a betrayal at all, I'll be first to admit, just a shady thing to do in general, whe  one is to check why that was done in the first place.
---
And the small issue of Goons welcoming every traitor there is. (On one occasion even welcoming back someone stealing from goons, because damn he was charismatic). Wanna be big in goons? Steal lost of money from peple calling you friends and goons enemies and you are a director.
---
Goons of today have one strong ally. Two may be three pets (sub-alliances that are in no way independent or capable of doing anything on their own). And some renters (no one ever counts the renters). And you are trying to call the only strong and independent alliance who is still willing to stick by your side bad words... ignoring the fact that they are only with you because they want to, despite everything. 
---
And you wonder why goons are hated by almost every former ally. PL, NC, c02 (rip). Test also should,  imo, but I was assured that they don't.  At the moment at least, as long as their propaganda department wishes so...
---

I´ll tell you how to improve your product. Make an optinal version that actually displays more than 3 relevant data points on a 4k monitor. A version where each and every element of the UI is not like 400x400 pixels in size without scaling it down until the font becomes unreadable. God bless.

You do lose ~800 hull HP with a DCUII, but I think for how I use the Astero going nano seems to be a good idea.

I mean i have this spare hull sitting right here.....

OK, I don't have a 4k monitor and have never used one. So I can't really visualize what you're suggesting.

17.9k EHP, and the cap lasts just shy of 2 minutes. Can't theorycraft this right now but I wonder 
---
1. How much good that cap battery is doing
---
2. Whether you can/should change the tank to LSBII + shield boost amp
---
3. What kind of rats you're going to be shooting. You've got no added resists besides the DC, which would be pretty bad if they're shooting EM at you. What if you swap shield mods as suggested in 2. and swap the cap battery for a shield resist?
---
Very interested to see how this plays out
---
LS is currently not in a state where it can hold many of the small to mid-sized gangs, like it's either hot droppers or it's 4 frigs, like there isn't much middle ground this means if you have a normal mid-sized gang of like 10/15 dudes your either blobbing the shit out of LS no fun for anybody or getting the shit blobbed out of you in NS. 
---
plus the current state of LS highly encourages frig fights and discourages anything bigger, both because of plex mechanics and because of aligning time on gates. 
---
LS corps also have a massive income problem, like on a corp level that is almost nothing that makes money this means you have almost no attractive programs for new players this leads to LS being populated by frig pvpers and vets that can replace there own supers. 
---
Why this happened, the moons before the moon changes you have a grid you could fight on that wasn't too oppressive that allowed your alliance a source of income in LS, given the majority of moons are currently not being mined in both LS and NS they become vitally worthless.

---
Thanks for sharing the tears.
---
You need to do around 9375 DPS to pause a Sotiyo counting for base resists. I don't fly a leshak but I believe over 2k DPS is not crazy high for a Leshak, so you should be able to take it down Solo. It will take a long time though, just be aware, it's like 3-4 hours for the final timer.

It was a trade. The Goon staging Keepstar in the north was a TEST keepstar because we had one ready, and the second one we dropped in UALX was a Goons one because you guys had one ready.

Better, maybe he can send you a 4k monitor 🙃
---
I'm pretty sure that's a quote from the joker. Trying to make money from all the things you like sounds like a recipe for disaster and disappointment.
---
Wow, you came through
---
I feel like I should hug you now
---
I´m obviously half serious here. But a compact or lite version would be fucking swell. You´re doing gods work.
---
Then you should bitch at CCP not a 3rd party service.
---
&gt;As a solo miner it would make more sense to make the station first wouldn't it?
---
To be honest, if you're just starting out you're better off selling the minerals and/or finished products and buying a Raitaru. There will be people with perfect skills and 10/20 BPOs who can build it far cheaper than you can. If you're dead-set on building your own Raitaru, maybe going for the Ultimate Industrialist Challenge, there's nothing wrong with that, but you'll get far better bang for your buck if you buy a Raitaru from someone who makes a living off building them.
---
There's also the question of why you're building a Raitaru. I assume you're operating out of highsec, and if you are there's plenty of freeport Raitarus with reasonable fees. At the stage you seem to be at the minimal industry fees aren't really going to be a problem, and it'll be better for you if you can work out of a structure someone else has already built rather than trying to build (and defend) your own infrastructure. It sounds like you want a Raitaru just for the sake of owning one, which isn't really that good of a reason to go to the time and effort and expense of building, erecting, and defending one yourself.
---
&gt;The main reason I want the Orca is the increased hold so I don't have to return to station as often.
---
Well, it depends. If "solo miner" includes alt accounts (that aren't Alphas) then an Orca can be a very good investment in highsec. In low/null, use a Porp instead. If by "solo miner" you mean "one account at a time", then just put your ISK and SP towards a Hulk instead. Harder and more expensive to build on your own but an all-around better income source. If you need a lot of cargo capacity, I'd suggest at the very least spinning up an alpha, getting them Gallente Industrial IV, and putting them in a Miasmos. Even if you don't have a second computer (or the power for a VirtualBox instance), you can jetcan your mine, log out your main and log in your alt, pick up the can and ship it to station, then log out your alt and log in your main.
---
TL;DR: You're probably better off selling minerals/finished products and then buying a Raitaru but to be honest you shouldn't put up a Raitaru in the first place unless you're in an area where there aren't any accessible public industry structures (and you can't move to an area where there are). Also, if you don't have Omegaed alts you're better off investing in a Hulk than an Orca.

---
I think two hours is a bad idea.
---
It's long enough to annoy people who want to wave their epeen but too short to deny a lot of intel.
---
Now, 12 hours...
---
Make it 12? Please?
---
Doing the lord's work.
---
That's going to be hard since according to the login I have exactly 5k
---
Sorry what does LSBII stand for?
---
Are u saying to go passive tank, basing the tank off regeneration?
---
Right u make very correct points i just didnt think of.
---
Im guessing armor tank  will be the way to build it since im primarily against sansha and amar empire.
---
Give me a few min to tinker around on Pyfa and ill post whatever i come up with
---
haha squizz works for ccp now wow haha lol
---
Originally i was going to do armor tank, but armor modules mainly come from the low slots and i felt losing dps (as DDAs are low slot too) wouldnt be worth it. What do u think?
---
It's dumb that you think zkill was always intended as an intel tool, and not just a statistics aggregator, as squizz has repeatedly said in the past.
---
It's also dumb that you think it's merely HIS agenda. There's quite a lot of people that agree that ESI should not provide better intel than you can get in-game. I know a lot of 3rd party devs - the makers of those tools like zkill that use ESI - are advocating for the same change. 
---
If squizz wants to try it as an experiment for just a few days, then let him. We'll see how well it works, and CCP can even learn from it and decide if it's nice or not.
---
And if it means someone else has to come up with a replacement, then let them - they still won't have what zkill has: the permissions from the majority of the Eve Playerbase to actually use their info and download their kills.
---
a good player would use all available tools, in or out of game. why artificially handicap urself cuz some dipship on reddit will put a label on you
---
weird I saw that same sticker for the first time today on a jeep now I'm seeing it here
---
If a hunter’s ability to hunt is completely crippled by the absence of a specific 3rd party service, thats a problem
---
dotlan gets the kills info from zkill so... yeah, we pretty much have only zkill
---
IDK about this. Blackout is nice but people still need info on where other people are in the game. Too many empty systems.
---
I google it and that make me not posting it when it happend. All my pilot are minmatar. so seeing this was like priceless.
---
So you're a shit player, got it.
---
Maybe try reading the post.
---
Holy fuck some top tier comments
---
That or Oasis anyone that don't shoot back? Idk - seems weird to make a video about all the kills you got out of pure luck of finding an idiot, eh? Then calling it OP. Who's proud of that?
---
You could delay zkill by 2 days and still see trends of when folks are active in what areas. 2 hours is just enough to stop it from providing real time Intel coming out of automatic esi whatever.
---
Thank you for all the work you do in spite of this whiny ass community and the entitled fucks that think you work for them or something. This change is definitely for the positive.
---
Bold to assume 99% of folks know how to manually add a killmail.
---
"It's long enough to..."
---
It's as long as they want until they post it. If they get their rocks off on their KB, they know how to manually add. Comment doesn't make ant sense
---
&gt;It's dumb that you think zkill was always intended as an intel tool
---
putting an arbitrary time delay on your statistics tool is also dumb in the exact same way, it's irrelevant what he wants to do with it, he's intentionally using it to push his agenda either way.
---
Its HIS site he can do whatever he wants.  He doesnt for you to use zkill. He provides it FREE OF CHARGE.  You have zero right to question anything.
---
If you dont like it dont use it.  Simple.
---
And Squizz good call but we should encourage CCP to force a delay from ESI end.  All this instant Intel is ridiculous.
---
This is a good idea. I like that you had it.

---

Its got a little more CPU so probably something could be fitted there...
---
What do u suggest i should change to fix it?
---
*two days later*... Pandas: 'ah, fuck'
---
This will be an interesting change. While I see it overall beneficial. I think freighter pilots will have to resort to having an alt scouting routes ahead.
---
&gt; small
---
&gt; 60+ characters
---
T1 hulls are too cheap and disposable. I suggest locking safeties to green on t1 hulls in high sec. If you suicide gank, you should be taking a meaningful loss. 30mil in catalysts to gank a freighter is too cheap imo.
---
High sec is not safe at all. More ships are lost there than in the rest of eve combined.

The Cap battery makes it stable for me to run the AB and Auto tracking highslot.

Pyfa doesnt take into account reddit's double return line break. Put 4 spaces beforr each line to fix the formatting.
---
When you simulate tank on pyfa, right click the 4 percentages underneath your resistances to change simulated incoming damage. Pick the NPCs you are fighting and it will give you a more accurate EHP.
---
Fit looks good. You could play around with getting a large compact battery or enduring 100mn if it'll fit. Perhaps by removing the remote armor rep you can get better cap. Take that out for a spin and see how it works for you.
---
The Black Hand knows all. The Black Hand sees all. Beware all ye who apply.
---
ya we will have a legacy killboard obviously as soon as humanely possible
---
the real answer is to join a c5 corp, make an alt alpha tinker snake pilot and hop in someones bearhole
---
Ccp should remove kill stats all together
---
Of the three big new player corps, karma fleet is the most annoying to get into, the recruiters do their best to keep spies out which makes it annoying for anyone legit trying to join, but does keep low effort spies down a little. 
---
Brave is next. they will get your ESI but don’t do much besides a cursory inspection to keep extremely low effort spies out. 
---
Then Pandemic Horde, which does nothing at all to keep spies out, which also means that you can apply and be accepted within 12 hours.

POS code has been around forever too. The broken parts of the chat are new but CCP decided to stick with the new system. Chat is the new POS code.

It wouldn't be hard for a large group to automate the posting process would it?

You didn't stop did you?

If you have an Astero align time is unimportant. Just sit 2.25 km off a can, if anything decloaks hit cloak and warp. That will save you from everything but stealth bombers. For those just fit scram, dual prop and a bit of tank, and then they will be the ones dying. If it’s a bomber with friends, there was nothing you could have done anyway, just hope you weren’t carrying too much loot

---
I meant freeing up fitting space to use an enduring afterburner or large cap battery instead of medium.
---
Regarding armor resists, just play around in pyfa to find the best values. Simulate incoming sansha damage and figure out which two resist modules are best.
---
Man, people really don't remember the days where home defense fleets had subcaps &amp; people camping gates :joy:
---
How about make your own and stop acting like an entitled pos?
---
i'm not sure why people need to dodge lances in assfrig fleets? those lances would at best damage 10% shield of a harpy lol
---
Just Checked some values with EHP. Omni tank is better so ur right about the adaptive membrane.
---
Just fit on an enduring and its gives me 50% cap stable. But i have to remove my Med Remote Rep.
---
The remote rep is for the drones, do u think a small remote rep would work fine as well? Its mainly for drone maintenance on long trips so I dont have to keep restocking, during battle I probably wont use it as I'll just move my drones in and out of my bay. 
---
Do u think a small rep would work? Or is it kind of useless
---
Is 15% a good tax rate? I luckily found a virgin planet just next to Didoxie, but how would the 40% max resource concentration  affect my income?

You can jack off to "lore" all you want but going by what's actually presented in the game and assuming you're not a leftist nutjob(i.e. I've heard people say that Gallente are "bad" because they have a state secret police... lmao):
---
 - Gallente are very obviously the good guys, it's almost sickening how the game pedestalizes them tbh
---
 - Minmatar are the underdogs and rebels, so also obviously the good guys, I mean their greatest "crime" in the game is that they're not a democracy(the horror)
---
 - Caldari are supposed to be hardcore meritocracy-based capitalists, but run any mission for them and it's all just nepotism and shady deals
---
 - Amarr are pretty much incorrigible, the game says they're capable of "great good and evil all in the name of their god" except you literally never see the good part, not even once

-you
---
try not to be retarded ok
---
just had a look at the numbers with a large cap battery.
---
JUst putting it on straight away gives about 20% over on PG which is gonna be a pain in the ass to fix.
---
Ill poke at it for a little bit.
---
But on the bright side it does make running the Armor Rep, AB, Auto targeting and Tracking link all at once stable which seems crazy good.
---
Theres a chance some skill upgrades could pull it off i havent really skilled anything for capacitor modules in terms of skills. Ill see what i can make.
---
PS Thank u so much for all the help/suggestions. I hope u dont mind me contining to ask these questions and theorycraft with you? :D
---
Everyones allowed to do whatever they want whenever they want to whomever they want with whoever they want to.
---
Interesting Change. Could someone explain what they think the effects will be? Im quite new to pvp so im curious about other people's opinions
---
It is safer where people are organized.
---
Amarr, clearly.
---
Wont work. System wide taxes were alreadybaupposed to do this.
---
[removed]
---
They can just look at ships killed in the last hour. A spike of 60 or more in a high traffic area indicates a camp at the gate.
---
Dont think theres any way i can get Both Enduring and Large Cap battery even with maxed capacitor skills for an alpha.
---
I can get up to 16m but thats with 20% PG over and no free slots...
---
Idk what else i can do other than implants which probably arent worth cause they are so expensive and Ive only got like 50mil on me XD
---

People put a LOT of work into their spreadsheets. They are often sold for a lot of isk. If you are looking for market tools you can pull trade API from eve knife.
---
interesting, so he was just tethered on the structures because he was selling them? to be able to buy the structures off init you would have to have a relationship with them in the first place, right? if he was just flipping the structures for profit, why, when i messaged your ceo about it, did she say this?
---

sure doesnt sound like just flipping structures to me, why say something like that but then not kick the person?
---
or, you know, we could just talk about this instead :) https://i.imgur.com/Zw84Pzq.png

Next 3D Printing task, an actual monitor

can you remove a structure from your selling window, so that you sell only to orders from either npc and other citadels? thank you

&gt;For coming up on 20 years capsuleers have been allowed to play the game the way they see fit. Those wishing to be pirates have been allowed to do so. Those wishing to build something greater than the sum of its parts have been allowed to do so. Those wishing to engage in as much risk as they see fit have been allowed to do so. All that changed when the Nul space blackout occurred. 
---
It didn't change. None of that changed. It's still eminently possible to do all that, it's just marginally harder to get set up and marginally easier for people to contest you. Hell, piracy has only become more lucrative!
---
&gt;With the blackout fear has gripped the smaller organizations. Fear to mine, to rat, and to haul.
---
Whenever I deploy my Rorqual, I do so fearing the day when someone is going to come in and destroy it. Hours and hours of hard work lost to the void, a monument to one man's hubris turned to ash by another man's whims. And you know what? That's *exactly why* I deploy it. That thrill, the risk, knowing I'm putting billions of ISK (still a decent sum to me) on the line with only the capricious whims of my corpmates able to back me up, with no guarantee of success. Knowing that not just will I have an income but that I will have to fight for that income, that I will be challenged and that I will have to prevail. *That* is what makes EVE great. Without that risk, without that threat, it's all hollow and meaningless. I just keep earning income without any challenge, and it grows dull.
---
&gt;Those wishing to engage in hit and run attacks have been aided while those wishing to build a utopia have been denied due to the aforementioned raiders.
---
Have you ever been in a large null bloc? It's not a utopia, it's a bureaucratic nightmare, an endless labyrinth of byzantine rules and restrictions. Shoot these guys but not those guys. Mine here but not  there. Keep your killboard green, don't take fights if you can't win them, on and on. The "empire building" playstyle sucked the life and soul out of null and low, turning a verdant wild west of content into a sea of grey-brown drudgery.
---
&gt;But with this stagnation comes a certain level of peace. 
---
Only inasmuch as death brings peace. And what you seek, stability above all, will lead to naught but gradual lingering death. Maybe the Blackout will kill the game, of this I am still not certain. But at least that death will come as a result of *change*. At least CCP will be remembered for having done *something*, *anything* to halt the death of this beautiful game, successful or not, rather than resign it to its fate.
---
&gt;Thus the blackout. The founders removed the ability to determine friends and foes in the local area. They induced the fear they sought from the beginning. They removed the ability to play the game we wanted to play (complacency and all) amd forced us to play it their way, with risk.
---
None of this is a bad thing.
---
Watch these. Total of 6 and he is informative af. Learned so much thanks to him.

---
How much are you willing to pay (in ISK or PLEX)?
---
There's probably some general-purpose sheets you'll find online, but these are probably going to be outdated and generally useless.
---
Do u have a good one?
---
Use d-scan. Take the risk for the isk. After all... you're in the null. Seems reasonable to me.
---
Only things you can count on is war and taxes.
---
I don't do station trading, but I do a lot of industry. I can whip one up that'll auto-update from the API for a few hundred mill to a bill or so, depending on the scope you're looking for.
---
Like what all will it be able to do?
---
RIP https://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/
---
ok, you'll have to explain that to the 8 bombers that died, who didn't catch the boosh :p
---
If I had my way CCP would give a 48 hour delay.
---
CODE is pathetic
---
Ideally, take in arbitrary item inputs and return basic figures, volume, price, etc. and analyse it, display margin data, market cap, etc. It's not going to have big green arrows saying "TRADE THIS", but it will at the very least make the data easier to interpret.
---
I honestly wanted to see that work.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyz94PHAtO4APP4Ye6KXafLL4RLactXQ5x9j4fzbgRg/edit?usp=sharing
---
A sheet I made awhile back, The only thing that doesn't work is the trading info which just shows volume sold though I don't trade so I'm too lazy to fix it.
---
How many Plex did he pay for it?
---
&gt;You have zero right to question anything
---
Wait what? I think you're getting a bit carried away there...
---
Except if you're minmatar?
---
I run 4 planets extracting and processing 1 item with 5 basic processors.
---
I then take those 4 processed materials to a 5th planet and drop 2 in one launch pad and 2 in another lunchpad. Each of those has 4 processors running and outputting to another 4 processors for my final product.
---
Make sense?
---
Make 4 alphas. Train 2 of them in gallente battleship, basic scanning. 1 trains into rattlesnake, no missiles. Last one trains scanning and hacking, then rattlesnake.
---
Do wormhole and null relic/data explo until you earn enough for plex. Plex it, keep scanning. Plex accounts as you go.
---
When you can fly 1 rattle, day trip into C3 holes. Stay aligned to a safe with cloak ready.
---
Train more characters on the rattle accounts into 2 more gallente battleship.
---
When the second rattle is ready, day trip or squat/bear C5 holes. Use the 4 characters in megathrons to roll connections, log off, log in tinker rattlesnakes. Extra slots are for extra scanner alts, hauler alts. 
---
Extract any extra skillpoints to reduce the upkeep cost of the extra accounts.
---
Scale up. Buy 2 rattle characters. Move into a C5-C5 hole with a powered structure and roll the static for sites. Maybe plex another few accounts and use them for extra eyes, haulers, salvagers...
---
...
---
People are harassing your home. Time to downsize. Save up for a naglfar pilot preferably with no jump skills so it's cheaper. Sell your hole, sell your rattle pilots. Rat with the nag, going from C5 to C5 scouting as you go. Buy a second naglfar pilot. Buy a third nag pilot. Each site takes 3 cycles in total, so 3 nags 1 cycle a site in 5 minutes.
---
Do whatever you want.
---
There are so many pods there George Clooney wants to advertise for them.
---
you can see this easier in-game and real time
---
Is there any viable way to solo mining with cloak expedition ships? Will it be more profitable than afk-huffing at ordinary sig?
---
I had the expirience flying prospect, but want to try smth new, maybe roaming ns through wormholes to mine some rocks.
---
I agree that local blackout has led the change/adaptation but I don't think it has changed the essence of EVE where risk is reasonably proportional to reward.  Eve has HighSec (with local - kinda- and Concord), LS, NS and WH space.  The game remains risk-&gt;reward focused.
---
The local blackout has changed a lot of operations in NS for small and big corps/alliances.  Everyone (not just small corps) is adapting... but anyone is still welcome to live in HS whether or not in an NPC corp.
---
The main thing I like about the local blackout is that it wasn't an overt playstyle direction by the designers - here is a set of quests, go do that, etc.  Instead, some slight world conditions were changed and the playerbase researched/studied/prepared to exploit all the aspects.
---
Meanwhile, a lack of botting is seeing prices rise markedly.  For example, rigs are now hilariously expensive but this is the cost of playing with less bots.  We all asked for less bots so now we should be adapting and making bank, PvPing differently, etc.
---
I think the essence of EVE remains intact.
---
Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.  They brightened up my weekend.
---
huh its that bad hey? even though we can basically get regular freighters through with some ease with our relevant networks of jump gates/keepstar highways to bridge freighters up?
---
Yes.
---
Do you have a point here?
---
i really hate r/eve sometimes. anyone with an intelligent opinion is inherently wrong apparently.
---
The time to plex an account is not worth the measly $15 a month. Play the game and have fun.
---
You are now depending on it. So it seems like you are depending on it.
---
&gt;Sometimes you have to sacrifice convenience for security. Welcome to being an adult.
---
Not quite what you would expect from someone requiring a babysitter.
---
You can also learn not to reuse passwords and/or not run untrusted programs.
---
Yeah but this is available on a third party website.
---
nope.  [killboard.winterco.org/](https://killboard.winterco.org/) use zkill api
---
I didn't delete anything lol. Why would I? You're a brainlet who thinks questions are trolling and only come here to reddit for praise from your fanboys, and deserve to be spoken to as such.
---
Nah no problem lol I'm bored out of my skull. If I had a computer it might have gone a bit smoother.
---
Experiment with replacing rigs with ancillary current routers. I think compact AB and large cap battery is better than the other way around.
---
I hear there's from free real estate in Detorid.
---
gas huffing in wormholes is the best mining you will get. And the prospect mines the same m3/hr as a venture
---
*Then we will fight with a cyno*
---
Ftfy
---
Very much. This will be an excellent example for future reference if I move everything to null. Thanks a lot.
---
Yo I'd be so down to be able to hack an ansiplex gate. Hacking needs some expansion.
---
ew....
---
mixing buffer and active?
---
drop the LSE, and replace the MSB with an LSB (or an x-type MSB), replace the second invuln with an EM ward field, replace the MWD with a 10mn AB, change the prop sub to the agility one that'll give you another lowslot for another BCS.
---
But also, get your skills up.
---
Says the simple farmers guy :P
---
eh, i was just saying you can see real time info of miners out in space. dotlan's nice and all but it's historical data.
---
[Wait, that's not right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_(constellation))
---
just like porn
---
yeah but they can just add their own corp apis there and have no delay
---
It's not about using untrusted programs or using the same password.
---
You do realize millions of user credentials get compromised all the time, right? Not just EVE. Everything. I've had email accounts that lay dorment for ages get compromised, despite me never signing it up for anything for several years. But guess what, 2FA still kicked in and I saved those emails, even though they were burner accounts with 0 personally identifiable information. 
---
The only thing I'm seeing right now is that you're simply too lazy and inept to perform a simple task that you could teach a child to do before lunch.
---
It's a fire-and-forget contingency plan. You set it up once, *literally fucking one time,* and forget about it until you or someone else tries to access your account on a new or unknown device, because it will literally tell you that *somebody* is attempting to login with your credentials, and all you have to do is either click "Yes, that's me" or type in a handful of digits.
---
**You're just fucking lazy, that's all.**
---
Being the only product out there does not make one a monopoly. Having a monopoly means that nobody else CAN start something. Or it is pointless for them to. Like electrical companies or internet services providers. LITERALLY ANYBODY can start their own killboard. There is no monopoly in this arena. Any if somebody has a monopoly they generally would want to keep it and hold on to it, yet /u/Squizz has been begging for others to start another killboard for as long as I have known him which is about 2 ish years. So please, shutup and if you don't like the changes, then start your own damn killboard.
---
Nope he is right.
---
Baited by air LULW
---
&gt;Being the only product out there does not make one a monopoly. 
---
stop being a semantic retard, everyone knows what i mean
---
Mute everyone but FC ezpz
---
So they killed a fortizar .. everything dropped and now someone tries to be cool for killing unpiloted ships ?congratz
---
If ever there truly was a Karma fleet, that was it. Very nice job HK. I notice Beens have already started anchoring a replacement. Would be a shame if someone dunked it!
---
karmafleet is airport security, brave is disney land security, horde is nascar security
---
in fairness, 60 chars is 20 accounts, which is a small SP farm :)
---
Those with their own kb can only see kills they get.
---
Then use the ingame map functions.   The Game itself has a delay system though.   I think its 30min-1hr, haven't used it lately.
---
I have been in the same Corp for 3 years. I've taken a few sizable breaks over that duration. My Corp is small enough that everytime I come back and get on comms, I get "whoa hey, tehnoodles is back! What's up!" But big enough that there are new names that i get to meet.
---
We are a multi focus Corp. We have a chunk of hyper krabs that do the regular stratop, the solo and small gang dudes, the indy builders, the super pilots... everything.
---
We build Corp level programs that compete with alliance level such as buyback, cap hull building, 'free newbro ships', etc.
---
We do multiple daily Corp roams all the way from kitchen sink dessie down, to let's go dread roaming.
---
Very inviting group
---
Which is where they need to focus imo. If you start by income then people will start finding their way there and with that organisation will grow. With a healthy LS there wont be as much of a need to find content in NS.
---
I agree completely.
---
While I agree with the idea, I really don't want to have to wait 2 hours to see the result of my fleet fights.
---
No something that isnt overpowered isnt overpowered. When you can solo a cap, which you presently can, you cant just sit there and say "Its OP". It really really isnt.
---
But caps do help when fighting caps, just the way it is. Its like using cruisers against cruisers. And you yourself have stated that everybody has caps. So why dont you and your group counterdrop?
---
There are ways to handle the situation. But it wont get fixed by just sitting there and saying no cynos are broken when its your inability to handle the situation that is the problem.
---
Nice
---
If they are big enough a group this does not matter. The result is, that locals get instant notifications, where hunters/roamers are in the dark. I perfectly know why people like it, because it makes their space a bit safer in times of blackout.
---
?
---
"only my enemies will be affected by this change"
---
finally, a use for those capital exploration rigs
---
I would, but it would violate the EVE University communications policy.
---
many people watch zkill to see if gangs are roaming their space/towards them
---
"it's just not cool" -someone who can dish it but can't take it
---
Which bit don't you understand? The fact that Beans are hugely disliked in wh space? or the fact people want beans to continue because they spend huge amounts of isk buying ships they can't fly, no strategy, no tactics, no decent fc's, and unsurprisingly keep losing them to just about anyone they bump into.
---
yes
---
First the chemosh, now this.
---
Been using live streams over few key systems ver watching zkill for whole region.
---
No dipshit ? To the replacement fort -_- but nice to know my existence makes you this salty
---
Yes, its somewhat normal to do in other games too, but I think that methodology should be reviewed depending on the type of change.
---
But the soon to come economic report will probably give us some info regarding the real impact of the changes. All the login offers might invalidate some of the data, but there should still be some general pointers regarding effects ingame.
---
Eh. when you're doing those sites you can settle into an orbit and just orbit for like half an hour. You're constantly moving at max speed perpendicular to the rats.
---
He has resists set up in his rigs and relies on the passive shield regen and range to beat everything up. And, well, it's clickbait.
---
When I used to recommend VNI null ratting fits to new players for sansha/blood raider, I'd use a small armor repper running constantly instead of 2 large shield extenders because it was easier to get cap stable (notice he has no cap mods) and had a smaller signature which meant you'd get hit less.
---
To be honest, overprop is a pretty specific cheese fit. When I recommend newbie fits for missioning, I almost always recommend a 10mn and a more solid tank.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A)
---
Did they not even put up a fight for the Fort?
---
Honestly now, Ganking is the only PvP you can't dodge in High Sec now.
---
login offers shouldn't really invalidate economic data, though.
---
Caldari is far more a corporate oligarchy than pure meritocracy. There's shitloads of monopolies in Caldari society and the top corps control all governance of the state, so I'd hardly call that a meritocracy. 
---
The Gallente are a republic nation with democratic elections and very progressive values. 
---
Amarr are slaver, monarchist, xenophobic theocrats. 
---
Minmatar are tribal clans with all that entails.
---
I can't imagine living in any of them but Gallente would be much fun...
---
Honestly as a hauler who flies a solo dst, this doesn't change that much for me. I've gotten used to dealing with groups that avoid uploading their kills, which stops gatecheck from working.
---
Generally if I see kills in a system I want to pass through on the map that aren't showing up in gatecheck, *especially* when there are a lot of them? Naaah, not going that way today.
---
In my opinion honestly - a freighter without scouts and a webber is gonna have a bad time anyway.
---
Except the amarr have nice shiny gold and white ships so they must be good...
---
I mean, I've killed BCs with a Nereus before thanks to ECM. Any mechanic that can just stop you from being able to fight back with no real effective counter is absolute garbage.
---
They're probably just resetting the server. They do it periodically. Try again in 3-5 days.
---
There is no counter. This is established. A counter is not more of the same.
---
&gt;you cant just sit there and say "Its OP". It really really isnt.
---
That's what you do.
---
I tried to have a real discussion about the reasonability, but you essentially ignored it. Regardless of your position, the reality that you can teleport the largest ships somwhere in less time than the fastest ships can get there is simply a fact.
---
&gt;Its like using cruisers against cruisers. 
---
No. Caps kill everything.
---
&gt;And you yourself have stated that everybody has caps. So why dont you and your group counterdrop?
---
Because they teleport in more caps which means the fight is over before it started, so it doesnt start.
---
&gt;But it wont get fixed by just sitting there and saying no cynos are broken when its your inability to handle the situation that is the problem.
---
There is no way to handle the situation. I think this happened with slowcats, ishtars, feroxes and many others.
---
Wow, you sound self-assured for someone who didn't contest for the last three hours straight in their prime time.
---
You don't broadcast because it has zero use lol. Logi can't rep the entire fleet and if it's a lot of bombs you die anyway
---
The number of different corps on that list was...illuminating.
---
And they have hoods. So they have style or something.
---
I'm on vacation boss, I didn't do anything for the last three hours. That also doesn't make your comment any less pants-on-head stupid
---
I don't care one way or another, it's his killboard.
---
One unintended consequence may be a kind of disconnect for some though. I know that I sometimes watch a live feed from my corp and alliance to see what is going on in game when I'm not on. It's one of those nice little things that lets me feel like I'm keeping current with my guys even when in working.  Now that will be delayed , at least until my coalition makes its own board.
---
Meh, no big deal.
---
Personally, I think killboards and killmails are just scape goat's. People don't get the kills the want and need something to blame, so it's "too much Intel from killboards", mainly because in null they can't blame local anymore...
---
My cloak says otherwise.
---
It's already a dumpster fire, might as well dump some gasoline on it to burn some titans quicker
---
When did you stop being a bean? and why?
---
I have both sets of pings.... Over 50 from test today.
---
"the exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service."
---
He doesn't control all killboards. Just one.
---
&gt; but you can still make money exactly like you could before. 
---
Except at about 1/6th the rate. Which brings it down below almost all other ISK making method, even low-level mission running in high-sec. 
---
Seriously. I've done tests. I did a whole day each: ice mining in a Procurer, ratting in reasonably slippery ships (higgs/pre-aligned BCs), running level 3 missions in high-sec, and doing Tier 2 Abyssals. The results were, in order of most valuable to least: Abyssal, lvl3 missions, ice mining, ratting. And the difference between the Abyssals and all the other options were so huge it was almost laughable.
---
So sure, we can make *some* ISK in null-sec, outside of an umbrella. But not enough to make it worth the time, effort or the annoyance of getting nuked by blops droppers every hour or two. I'm not feeding you guys ships for trivial amounts of ISK.
---
When will you learn to stop asking questions?
---
\&gt;anyone that doesnt agree with me is an entitled fuck reee!!!1111
---
I am mind blown. I can’t wait to try this baby out later. Thanks!
---
I mean that's what half this sub said about the blackout in the first place.
---
Did they... evict you?
---
Sansha nation have WH generators. This is how Nation forces are moving across new eden. Person responsible for this is Citizen Bob.     
---
You are not generating WH from point A to B .... well you actually do but this involves a lot of triangulation and stabilization from generators placed in various C5 and C6 systems, generally down the chain.         
---
This requires of a lot of data to fly around so system is generating wormholes for this ... and those capsulleers use every day.
---
You do it
---
Why do you think people use them? The only things going for the ferox is high volley damage at decent range and low price, remove either of those and it will stop being meta
---
&gt;I need help to find people who shouldn't be able to see me coming
---
nobody's arguing that he owns all the killboards, how does that sentence even make sense? they mean monopoly over the api keys/killmails since for years its been the most popular kb
---
you're missing the point to argue for a retard who is also missing the point about what is being discussed
---
think about that
---
&gt;I can't hunt anyone without having a ton of extra intel. Even though I cried about the people being hunted having any intel. 
---
Be better
---
That looks pretty awesome, I must say.
---
Post them manually then.
---
That sounds correct based on a rough memory. It all worked out great.
---
The result? You were in the fight you should know the result.
---
Right. Well the Fits Fixed.
---
Now how about u gimme some good fits ;) ?
---
Tbh i like the big AB cause it makes me go fast (flying a gnosis in combat is so fking slow its makes me contemplate my life goals).
---
U know perhaps at that time isk was worth more and u could actually get omega with that...
---
So u ran a small armour rep? Cause that fit was running a medium one, with a small one it should be super easy to make a cap stable reasonably tanked and good dps fit...
---
Ive tried putting his fit onto pyfa and couldnt get it cap stable at all not matter what i did without having to change 2 or more of the modules...
---
Also why 100mn considered cheese? The idea of the fit is exactly what was done in the video right? orbit like 40-50km, press F to pay respects, or just go eat lunch that also should also work.
---
Indeed, which is why I highlighted "some" data, but should be enough points to get a feel for the effects. Metashow where discussing the effects, but no Aryth, so indepth industry/logistics review wasnt really part of the show. They/Vily did note that Frat was hurting due to the impact of failing botnetwork, which is an obvious BIG postitive, which they agreed on.
---
Might need another week for actual impact overall.
---
Oh also, do u remember the VNI stats before the changes? Do the ratting fits used on them still work or nah
---
Please send me some ratting fits if u got any good ones (with only drones cause i wanna sleep while making isk)
---
Impressive. I'm struggling to decide though if it is in a good or bad way....
---
Wormholes are the best kind of holes.
---
session change timers
---
Wait, what happened? I've been in null-sec for too long; high-sec mechanics don't make sense to me anymore.
---
Also, whoever cut the video just as he was about to explain it needs to be spanked!
---
Lmbo, looks like they have his orca figured out and knew his tactic. Scrub tier baby shit. Ganking has counterplay.
---
It's not stupid. Elo feeds the same line-members sometimes four or five times in a single fight with T1 fittings. Now he just hides until he'll be evicted from Detorid and life in WC will be hell. That's the essence of a banzai, which TEST mostly doesn't have to worry about.
---
To be fair it’s a bit difficult to deliver to wormholes if they don’t have statics
---
...Isn't that the case for all t1 ships?
---
You're right I was too worried about him getting away should have just kept at range 4000.
---
With a praxis you want to be refitting a lot based on incoming dps so there isn’t one fit.
---
The highs are pretty obviously a bunch of t2 rapid heavies. 
---
Mids are a meta 4 XL shield booster, meta 4 shield boost amplifier (there is no cpu left to make these t2). Carry a second boost amplifier in cargo to refit to if needed. Then two t2 adaptive invulnerability fields, a cap battery, a cap recharger, and a compact target painter. Replace the target painter with the second shield boost amplifier as needed.
---
Lows are a t2 cpu upgrade, 4 BCUs (if you can use t2 sentries, or faction ones with decent skills, maybe swap one of these for a DDA. But I have terrible sentry skills so I don’t), and two flux coils. Carry two more flux coils in cargo to refit to as needed. Additionally carry another BCU to refit to if there isn’t much dps left in the wave (you’ll have to offline your shield boost amplifier to make this work). Also when replacing the target painter with your second shield boost amplifier you need to have replaced a BCU with a flux coil or you won’t have enough cpu. 
---
It’s really not as complicated as it sounds, if you are having trouble with capacitor or tank you just rip off dps and add in more cap/tank, and if you are tanking fine do the opposite
---
I'd love to get paid to hop into someone's hole.
---
Imagine thinking that the “Empire building playstyle” has sucked the life and soul out of nullsec.
---
Yikes.
---
Can you point me towards the Karmafleet recruiter that does the cavity searches? Asking for a friend.
---
If you're cloaked you arent running your own personal mining fleet with 6 hulks orca and freighter
---
or running your own incursion fleet.
---
At least the fittings are uninsurable
---
Yikes
---
This is a bad idea. Any changes to km feeds should be implemented by CCP and not you.   
---
I remember you explaining why you wouldn't implement a change to stop people being able to block their km's from showing for isk. You said that if you did that then someone would create a KB that did not have this functionality and zkill would stop being relevant. This is exactly the territory you are flirting with now.
---
Better yet: Join a corp with a refining service and use that for your minerals. I'm in a corp like that (official and unofficial refining services), but I don't really do industry. If I did industry, it would be with that sort of thing.
---
No alliance worth joining will care if you miss a few days of playing for irl reasons. 
---
The big nullsec alliances are even more relaxed. Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies will assume you have quit and kick you after about 3 months of inactivity. If you come back just apply again and you’ll be accepted. 
---
The other one, karma fleet, is a bit more annoying to get into and has an activity requirement, but that requirement is an average of one fleet per month over three months. If you play at all meeting that requirement should happen on its own.
---
Ganking bad! Stream sniping good!
---
This is fine but I'd much rather see CCP do it - this takes away the quick intel from the average Joe, but not from big groups that have their own board (the easy part) and enough APIs listed in it that it provides good coverage.
---
Letting loose
---
Demonstrably if you're whining about a free service that this dude spends tons of man-hours and money on to benefit the community at large over a well-needed change, then yes, you are in fact an entitled fuck. No amount of trying to meme your way through it is going to change that particular fact. But you do you.
---
That dude most likely got his account hacked
---
Someone who can afford 112 LSI probably knows to fit that kind of ship better than that
---
I don't really know much about solo PVP in ships larger than frigates, but Comet and Slicer are the ships that I'd recommend in a novice plex. Hookbill and Firetail are good too.
---
Beyond that, I'd start with a skirmish-type cruiser like the Caracal or ONI.
---
Yeey :D
---
Yea. Contact Big Hands McSausage Fingers
---
Neither, considering I'm still there.
---
&gt; cloaky campers
---
&gt; dscan
---
Also because CCP has stated that they have never worked, and don’t know how to get them working!
---
I found It due to the link further up....
---
But I legit thought that was a smudge on my monitor
---
Ok, 1 sec I'm deleting the video
---
they actually died on the gate to bosons
---
Would they believe you if you hypothetically found it after being kicked out for theft?
---
Wouldn't it be pretty hard to find something in a corp hangar after being booted for theft....?
---
I strongly disagree....
---
I do station trading.
---
Startet in November with the Last 270mil I has before quitting for good as a newbie
---
First bil in profit after 4 days
---
First plex in January
---
Second plex ending may
---
Broke 1.5b profit per day in early July
---
I invest about 1h to 1 and a half a day into my trader
---
That’s a pretty good turn over XP
---
hahha fucking EPIC upvoted!!!!!!!11!!!
---
11!!
---
How do I view the fit of the winning ship/s on zKillboard? I can only seem to view the fit of the losing ship.
---
+1
---
Or hire me, I'm obviously the best scout ever and will scout for you.
---
You know zkillboard isn't run by ccp, right?
---
Eve Prism is good. Just API, no bullshit.
---
Hunters rejoice! Dotlan Npc delta next? Scouting as a profession in EVE becomes viable more and more and I love it!
---
Legacy has already announced that they're gonna make a coalition killboard. Also same, going to to be interestering to see if a third party killboard that offers full functionality pops up as alternative.
---
I do station trading, and I think it’s one of the best ways to make a consistent amount of isk with a relatively low risk, and it has a plus that many other activities don’t have.
---
I can do it on a shitty netbook when I travel or go home from Uni, being away fro my main rig for a few weeks (I would be able to go ratting or exploring for example, the notebook is waaaayyy to slow to handle that)
---
To give an example
---
I startet station trading in November 2018 with the last 271mil I had before quitting the game (I bought plex and sold it, lost the Gia I bought with that in Hordes deep null before even arriving in the system I choose for ratting and was pissed as fuck with no real way to earn isk)
---
I had my first billion isk profit within 4 days
---
I plexed my main account at some point in late January
---
I broke the 600mil daily profit in March
---
I created and plexed my second account (needed because I was working with more than 300 market orders) in early June
---
I broke 1.5bil daily profit in July
---
Paying to diminish intel against you (a paid advantage) versus blanket diminishing intel for everyone is not even close to the same line. I have no idea what kind of fucked-up logic it takes to draw that parallel.
---
Someone's getting a donation to remove ads from skill now 😂
---
No I'm not. Not when you start being derogatory and question the mans morals.  Dont like it dont use it no one forces you to.  If it was me I'd shut down zkill and fuck you all together in with your whiny lives  unappreciative  fuckers.  Tbh I'd close all external sites and then see where you get...maybe you lot should start to appreciate the time and effort third parties people do at their own expense. They dont answer to you..
---
I have never trusted local
---
Basically the streamer was gonna pull off the following gank.
---
1. Streamer pretends to be Orca mining
---
2. Orca has fitted gank catalysts in the ship bay
---
3. Ganking characters Pods warp to the Orca and hop into the fitted ships
---
4. The Catalysts kill the barges the orca was sitting next to pretending to mine
---
However just as the pods warped to the Orca an instalock Loki decloaked and killed the pods I assume by activating killrights on them or because of those characters having low security status.
---
Imagine unironically enjoying being told who you're allowed and not allowed to shoot in a PvP-centric video game.       
---
Can I use the "keep at range" command on all enemies in my vicinity, or will it only work on the most recent enemy I've used the command on?
---
The outcome is the same, people stop using zkill, that's the parallel
---
https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard
---
Are renters even human?
---
r/eve is gon r/eve you know.
---
So we're going back to everyone having their own killboard again, regression seems to be the theme of the second millennium.
---
Just pay 2 subs to jump in null 4HEad
---
Well then I guess we should salute those brave adventurers who fly unescorted freighters there.
---
Have:
---
* A friend
---
* Scout yourself through in a Ceptor 1 jump prior
---
* Fly a T2 Hauler with a Cloak
---
All 1 Account options
---
Yep I guess I trust the bulkheads too much :) I normally don't start the repper unless I'm taking significant chunks of damage so as to not over-rep but you're right that a lot of those fights were needlessly close.
---
It must be very comforting to think you're that important. You're not. Most origin dudes I know don't give a fuck about WC or Detorid, we just like blowing shit up and this is the place to do it.
---
You guys are the ones who need a narrative to survive, not us. Don't get it twisted. We're playing a video game. You're roleplaying serving in a feudal army talking about how fly your lord is.
---
Thanks. I might re-post with the part where she flicks the Autopilot switch.
---
Dude asking the real questions here.
---
Except no, he can't.
---
The 'value' zkill has isn't in the code (which he's made freely available at https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard so you could put up your own killboard with a fraction of the effort), or in the kills he knowns about (again, freely available.)
---
It's in the api keys people have sent to it. And _those_ are locked to the application he's created with CCP's developer site, which is locked to his account (not a character)
---
And accounts are not transferable (in a legitimate fashion).
---
Yeah, I guess when Elo was telling people to miss work in a country with dystopian social credit you were "Playing a game." See you on the battlefield
---
People aren't going to stop using zkill. A vocal minority will whine about it for a small period of time because that's what people that play this game do apparently. The boards that coalitions/alliances make will be used strictly for defense, seeing as people outside their coalition won't have their ESI tokens in there so 95% of Zkills functionality won't be available. Zkill will still be the main aggregation of global pilots.
---
I don't know what Elo is doing. I'm playing a game. Elo actually cares a lot about WC, Detorid, and Frat. But you weren't just talking about Elo. You were talking about Origin - and most of us don't give a shit. We just like playing a video game. 
---
As for the feeding, in Origin we're pretty shockingly isk positive. Maybe you're lumping Origin-only fights together with Origin+Frat fights - but we don't. 
---
Again - *you* guys need the narrative. We don't. Stop trying to get other people to play this bullshit "what is Vily saying on Discord" game. We don't give a shit, and it's kind of pathetic that you do.
---
Great clip, our autopilot is pretty competent though so its more appropriate for the autopillock on X games.
---
Exactly. Have fun in the Dronelands Origin. It's fair enough to say Elo doesn't represent you, but at one time he was a bigger try hard than NC in dreaming about getting us evicted.
---
If youre being shot but not shooting can you refit using a mobile depot assuming of course they dont ref it
---
...you know we still control most of Venal, right? Honestly dude I don't know if you're brain addled or just severely incapable of independent thought, but Origin. is gonna be just fine. I wonder how fun the game is going to be for TEST when you finally finish blueing the rest of Eve? Actually, scratch that - I don't give a shit.
---
Typically cant lose a pod in ls/hs........🤣 not in our region. You kill something you finish the pod
---
All it takes is 1 person willing to do it, most people are irrelevant. If there is a ground swell towards that new board then it's gn zkill.   
---
The community eventually gets a replacement and swizz loses his place in this game.  
---
My point is that any arbitrary change by swizz is bad for zkill. Any change HAS to be implemented by CCP.
---
mmkay, Venal is NPC space.
---
Well if the pod wants to get away it's gonna get away. It's another thing if pod express is the more sensible option :D
---
Armil is not recruiting.
---
Omega 2-3 accounts, put three characters on each and train all PI skills at least IV plus Gallente Industrial I. Train reaction, research, and industry skills to at least IV across the board. Designate one character as a "main" per account and train those in your ISK-making activity of choice, be it incursions, mining, or ratting. Run PI on each of your 6-9 characters, plus research, plus reactions, plus industry, all for passive income. Dual/triplebox your mains for active income. Inject your alt characters to V across the board for passive ISK making. Buy MCTs and start up skill farms. All this, in 6-9 months, assuming you don't inject early on.
---
You can cover the cost of keeping up Omega with the skill farms alone. Your passive income should be a few billion a month, as a conservative estimate. Your active income is dependent upon however much time you want to put in, but can relatively easily pass eleven figures a month. All this ISK can support a PvP character, injecting to whatever you want to do and buying a limitless number of ships to lose. All at the cost of an hour or so a day in upkeep at the most.
---
All this requires that you be absolutely stark raving mad, and/or lack a disposable income. To be honest, unless you're absolutely dedicated to this game and/or your SO plays as well, you're probably better off just PLEXing with overtime money and using that to fund your PvP addiction.
---
Highsec pvp at its finest. For the next time get the miners to gank the Loki for the full circle. :)
---
go to wormhole space if you dont like ppl dropping
---
Use evernus, there are a few older videos explaining it.
---
And YES it has been picked it dropped 2 updates in the last 2 weeks, one doing .... things..... and one adjusting for the new tax changes
---
The help pages in the software don't work, they still redirect to the old web page
---
Look at
---
evernus.anveer.com
---
Ganking counterplay has counterplay??!?!!!
---
Gallente society is built upon massive amounts of unemployment, driven largely by the prevalence of advanced automation, and the Federation's budget is crippled by an unwieldy welfare state. The average citizen is anesthetized with cheap entertainment to distract them from the crippling poverty and unemployment around them. The intelligence services ruthlessly cover up anything that would tarnish the Federation's image as an absolutely moral beacon of pure good.
---
Being in Gallente society is a lot like living in a gilded slum. Sure, it's pretty and distracting, but no amount of money is going to distract from the fact that your life is ultimately miserable.
---
Its call in game map
---
Freedom fighters also generally don't set up concentration camps. The Minmatar, on the other hand, absolutely do.
---
&gt;even Gallente
---
In their case it's quite a lot of shades of grey, fifty to be exact...
---
Stain is NPC space, too. Go try to drop a structure there, tell me how it goes.
---
You can't. You'll have to wait until the other person loses that ship.
---
The moment anyone in the coalition does everyone can see it and bots can notify them of people hunting. It’s still a very powerful Intel tool.
---
Did you utterly misinterpret what I said? I'm not saying they shouldn't change the game at all. Wtf.
---
Wow. Just, wow.
---
Yes, you can even use it if you are shooting.
---
Filthy instalocks, pods dont stand a chance.
---
He told me later on.  I didn't see it myself of course.
---
Pods lit. don't have align time so if you spam warp while dying nothing should be able to lock you :/
---
as long as it's not a player so you don't get a aggression timer.
---
Only on the one you most recently used that command on
---
Hey /u/squizz
---
Thanks for everything you've done with Zkill, it's unparalleled in use and utility. I am not sure how this will play out in the longer term - good or bad. Though one concern I have as a mid tier solo pvper is the utility in finding gatecamps, or oppressive fleets, before crashing into them solo &amp; dying on the burn back to gate.
---
I think larger groups are fine, as it's possible to build their own ESI reader to glean Intel &amp; make it internal only. Smaller and individual players won't have access to this resource. 
---
In combination with blackout (which I really enjoy!) this is a secondary buff to gatecamps and I don't think that's a great thing, so soon after. I think it is something you'll closely monitor, but I'm still concerned it'll hurt the little guys, more so than larger blocs.
---
:/
---
Don't like.
---
It is christmas every day for miners in new eden.
---
... and? 
---
It's on the individual to derive meaning from their own life. If they are bored or directionless with that much time on their hands it is their own fault and it frankly ridiculous. 
---
There will always be poverty, no matter the form of governance. Better to be poor and free than being forced to believe and act a certain way.
---
Ye maybe
---
and you’re hauling stuff in and out of jita yourself?
---
That’s only true the more so you have. I have 160m+ sp and I would only get 100k from injecting. Low sp chars will get close if not all the sp injected upto 50m I think if memory serves?
---
if im not entirely mistaken most of the source of zkill is open and you can host a version yourself
---
The Gallente still aren't the "good guys", no-one is. It's all a facade, enforced through censorship and subtle control.
---
I just have one further question. If Fraternity command hadn't been forced to sign a NIP seven months ago, afterwards, during his glorious invasion of four regions would he of just used you like the isk positive casuals that you, yourself, are calling yourselves? He's the leader of your coalition, maybe he doesn't tell you what to do, but he tells plenty where to be and when. Don't even try to tell me you're just looking for fun away from the hellish warp times in Venal. You side with them because they're Chinese. So apparently, it does mean something to you.
---
yeah, and at that point you can have all the passwords you want for as many accounts as you want it won't matter at all, so my question still stands...
---
Never said good. But easily the most morally sound.
---
Of course there is only one eve. Because it is terrible. If it was actually any good, we would see some copies of it. 30k toons online at most? Fuckin dead lmao. When WoW classic comes out, it will wipe thr floor with eve all over again.
---
Funny, WoW will make one full lap and pass eve again. What a garbage game, after 16 years all they can do is add more skins and models. Then they go say things like "we can't remove pos because we have no idea about programming and do not understand the code". 
---
"Hurr durr it is a sandbox". Sandbox is an excuse to half assing a video game. "We give you tools, you do whatever you want". And then they wonder after 16 years, why people leave after doing the terrible tutorial because players have no idea what to do next.
---
On the surface, at a first glance, if you don't look deeply, sure.
---
Combat porpoises are actually extremely powerful. Everyone underestimates them too, so you can get a lot of kills
---
Unless this is coming from CCP it's a bad idea. People will just start using other killlboards like one of the many ZKB clones.
---
But if you are tired of running the most popular killboard for EVE, this is a great strategy.
---
&gt; r/eve
---
&gt; intelligent opinion
---
iirc there was a drama some years (?) back that involved mass BB Discord kicks...
---
He goes at douglas throat for pointing out an mistake he made. He started talking about definitions, getting them wrong. 
---
that's all
---
You don't know what you're talking about and lash out because you are called out. 
---
I fucking TOLD you guys I wasn't the only one
---
The fits still work, its just since they nerfed the drone bay you can't run 5 heavies and they nerfed the hull's drone bonuses. You're better off using a myrmidon.
---
As for vexor fit, 10mn, large cap battery, tracking link, drone nav, 2 DDA, em/therm armor hardeners, medium armor rep, anti em/therm rigs, nanobot accelerator rig.
---
You have half the top speed but you're much more maneuverable.
---
Went well, the locals are pretty scarce.
---
They wouldn't exist if we weren't meant to use them
---
&gt; You side with them because they're Chinese
---
Citation needed. I see TEST is continuing with this East vs. West narrative. Must be strange to need to stoke nationalism and xenophobia to play a game, but hey - you do you. 
---
&gt; If Fraternity command hadn't been forced to sign a NIP seven months ago, afterwards, during his glorious invasion of four regions would he of just used you like the isk positive casuals that you, yourself, are calling yourselves?
---
Is there a question in there? Seems more like a statement with a question mark at the end. If by "used me," you mean "gotten me some really fun fights," yes. Somehow, you're trying to connect Origin. with a love of Chinese players, and that means we are all just...Elo's playthings? I guess? I dunno, it's kind of hard to follow your ramblings. Maybe you should wait for Vily to wake up so he can tell you what The Narrative is supposed to be today. 
---
But let's just back up for a sec to examine how we got here. You made a comment that many people seemed to find legitimately stupid about how Pandas (LOL GET IT GUYS THEY'RE CHINESE) would be upset about a change that impacts literally every entity in the game (save those who take direct steps to mitigate it). Then you tried to defend your stupid comment by saying that Elo feeds T1-fit ships...and I lost ya there. Honest to god, I did. Because at that point you fully jumped the shark, my man. You went from stupid to incoherent. I think you should read this comment chain again and try to figure out exactly what the fuck you're trying to say, because I sincerely doubt that anyone else can.
---
guess its time to reboot the goon killboard with member esi already implented XD
---
Thanks
---
Jumped the shark? Elo Knight is your current or former CEO, Doombunny is also executive you malignant uninformed twat
---
Yes.   The end of the real villains:  corporations and alliances.  Make everyone fight everyone.
---
Make it at least 24h.
---
ESI shouldnt provide killmails at all. If people want them, they can post manually.
---
Yeah? What's up?
---
The hogs of war
---
I'm saying there is absolutely no fucking connection between "zkill is delayed and for some reason Frat will be especially upset about that" and "Elo feeds T1 fit ships." Did you forget your own argument?
---
how dare people disagree about a change a dev made in the thread he made himself for discussion, the absolute audacity
---
my issue with zkill and other's like it is that you show the fit, the pilot name and the system their killed in, I think these are the key bits of intel that you could potentially hide.
---
To brag about a kill all we really need to see is "Hay PlayerX from AllianceY Lost a 7bill Rorqual in RegionZ and here is who was on the killmail"
---
no need to show the fit, the pilots name, or the system he was in, all the people involved still get to brag about the cool kill but no one else gets to leech intel like accurate location, the fitting, or the player name.
---
&gt;People don't get the kills the want and need something to blame, so it's "too much Intel from killboards", mainly because in null they can't blame local anymore...
---
So what would "too much intel" look like if not like zkb? How much more free intel can you extract out of killmails?
---
Are you rping as "sterotypical f1 money #4561"
---
As a side, since people do goto your site for fits, you could add a side page that lets you search a hull and then return the top 5 most commonly used fits in your database for that hull, minus cargo, just looking at the fitted modules to limit the variation, would be interesting information I think and wouldnt be giving intel on any specific group or player, while still giving people fit idea's.
---
WhyYouMadYo
---
Yeah no reason to start new unless you have bad reputation attached to your original character. Even if you want to skill in a different direction, any core skills you trained will still be useful. You will have some amount of isk or assets already to help you in whatever direction you want to take. Only reason I could see to start a new char (other than reputation) is if you want an alt.
---
And don't do the skill extractors you're just wasting isk for a reduced return, and you'll still have 5mil sp wasted. Unless you want to spend endless real money, or have insane income, skill points imo are the most valuable thing in the game, because the only reasonable way to pay for them is with time.
---
And you can still buy the $99 pack, or $5 booster pack, or whatever else on your original character.
---
This is my opinion. Do what you want though
---
You're also saying you know nothing about Elo. So I Guess That Was Fucking Bravado
---
Sorry my dear but renters opinion matter much, much more to CCP than your alliance.
---
You know, money and stuff ? Oh and the fact that they are as much allowed to play than you and they are more than you ?
---
Stop kidding yourself.
---
Yeah, the real problem is CCP making stuff available.
---
I really don't get why having a discussion about Eve lore would generate downvotes. The Gallente are the least extremist and most tolerant of all of the empires. Sure they might do immoral shit to perpetuate their views on an egalitarian society, but it's far less insidious than religious nutjobbery or being loyal to a corporation because you were born into it.
---
Imagine being in an alliance for benefits but not wanting to obey some rules.
---
Also the Empire building playstyle didn't suck the life out of nullsec. CCP sucked the life out of both null and lowsec.
---
In a more realistic vein, at pilot creation choosing triglav spawns you in abyssal space. Systems are dynamic with gates, resources and structures all being rerolled every 90 days. Your only contact with new eden proper is pvp space in filament runs. No contracts, no trading no moving assets anywhere else but the pilot that acquired them.
---
Leader boards for basically any stat worth noting, top x pilots retain sp everyone else resets but keeps name.
---
Triglav are not capsuleers. Losing your pod means you are dead until next season where you can roll a new pilot.
---
Can't wait until CCP removes or delays killmails completely now that the community shows it accepts less intel.
---
"the community" Just because one guy wants it that way doesn't mean everyone wants it like that.
---
That is funny.  You want to play a space game in a fictional universe that has shittier communications technology that Earth does today.
---
Morality is a society perspective, these are each a different society and hence have differing ones.  Especially since they are also going to differ from the various ones we currently have. 
---
What is 'acceptable' in each society differs, it does here on earth.  There's overlaps in each and there always will be.
---
Dual leshak handles the frigates quite badly imo
---
&gt;Any changes to km feeds should be implemented by CCP and not you.
---
But he can test the waters for CCP.
---
Wow this sounds like a really fun way to play Eve, I wish I too could sit for hours and hours F1ing all these structures with the megablob fleets :(
---
How much for the one with big green arrows?
---
I would pay daily to concord to be able to have multiple clones in the same station.
---
"we shouldnt try to get rid of bots because botters will just adapt".
---
My favorite part of your comment is that you didn't even _attempt_ to explain your argument - you just moved directly onto the attack. That's probably because you're just now realizing that you've been rambling for like 15 comments and no one has any idea what the fuck you're talking about. 
---
I didn't say that I know nothing about the coalition goal. I said it doesn't interest me or most of the people in Origin. I did say that I don't know much about Elo's personal motivations - other than that he actually cares about WC and Detorid. Not that I expect you to care or understand.
---
Have you seen the ads on the page... Not entirely without compensation now, is it?
---
nice
---
This has been the prevailing opinion since they removed recons from dscan.
---
Why are they disliked? Can't say I've hadany run ins with them but if they're willing to fight what's wrong with them? Tbh if they still keep taking more fights even if they lose a lot that makes me like the sound of them that's the right attitude to have
---
Not seeing a lot of outrage and most people seem supportive.
---
Holy rewritten history indeed. I do know wjat caused WWB. CFC being bad, pissing off everyone, obtaining numerous enemies everywhere, thinking themselves untouchables by anyone and everyone, including those with money. After all, CFC had money too. Well, turns out money isn't everything. So CFC is dead, killed off by their own arrogance. And their descendants Imperium hadn't learned a thing, because they don't blame themselves for losing everything, no, they came up with a scapegoat. Well done. Nice propaganda.
---
And INIT is the only ally you got who can do anything on their own. INIT were created from Pure. alliance, before you even started playing. They had won and lost numerous wars before deciding to stick with the bad guys on the condition of being independent from them. And when you entire coalition burned and collapsed, due to goons own incompetence, INIT stayed by your side. Through losses and retreats and failcascade - you had one ally. But hey. Not like goons hadn't turned on their only friends in the past. So, you are doing great portraying the old bad goons just the way they always were. I honestly hope that what you write isn't just some nobody in goons talking, but actual goons way of thinking, so INIT can finally go free and join us in the neutral to everybody club =]
---
and loses.
---
Yes but you can't get everyone's ESI tokens so it won't be anywhere near as useful as zkill is today.
---
How do you make that much...
---
I was originally aiming for the Myridon. 
---
But after testing some dps values, as an alpha we cant use sentry drones.
---
and It seems most the fits use it (sleeper murdering fits run then)
---
and u lose SO much damage it made my heart short circuit XD.
---
BUT is there any chance u have a fit for it? Ive got Gallente Cruiser to 3 so i can easily train up 
---
Gallente Battlecruiser.
---
Ive seen myri with missiles do u think thats necessary? Or will having a 
---
pure drone fit be fine as well?
---
A pure drone fit would allow me to train up the skills much quicker so that would be nice.

Myri is designed to tank ur rats right? Im going to guess its stupidly slow but tanky and cant speedtank at all.

For example this fit from Eve UNi:

Ive got basically all the skills except for the sentry drones, would it still be able to solo sleepers with heavy drones? or are sentries a must

Also would u know how to use the depot? Ive read that people refit on the go in order to get max regen/damage.

So do they just drop the depot and sit next to it throughout the fight without moving at all?
---
My argument is simple. Frat is getting whooped on, without giving a singular fuck about how much back work their line-members do, and if it's just a casual game to you, that's fine. But your argument was that TEST would suffer equally. And that's just stupid, as we've won nearly every engagement we've been in, sometimes hazing as many as three fleets over a single timer, because Fraternity is under-equipping and over-working their alliance mates. My kill-board hasn't been this green since M-B.
---
Wow, talk about a saddo.
---
You dont have to log in. If game is shit you can pick another from the gaming industry.
---
I can krab with you in space engineers its a nice time killer.
---
Origin. is the central corp in Black Legion. We're merged into Origin. for the war with TEST. 
---
I'm gonna level with you - it feels like you haven't played the game for all that long (in eve years), and that time has been spent in TEST. That's fine, if that's what you like. But I've played this game for 15 years, and I've tried (with more or less success...often less) to play in about every way you can. Branch out. This us-vs.-them bullshit benefits no one but the leadership of your alliance. Hating the guy flying the other ships because your leaders told you they are The Bad Guys doesn't make the game more fun. Buying into the political bullshit doesn't give you more stuff to do when you log in. There's about 20 people in this game who _really_ matter (insofar as nullsec politics are concerned) and not a single solitary one of them gives a fuck about you, how much you enjoy the game, or what you do on a day-to-day basis. They want you to form up when called for and do what you're told so they can move little markers on a map. Don't be a pawn, just go play the game.
---
Need one.
---
It might be because most EVE players aren't as whiny as everybody think and try to test things out a bit before they complain. 
---
Doesn't mean that everybody like every change.

Wow... Fucking amazing skill... Your mothers must be so proud....
---
Oh wait.... Those were empty ships that you're trying to get kudos for... HK must be so 'leet
---
Well, you're sounding much more reasonable now, but I assure you there are plenty of high level alliance who head shot all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons. In my particular case it was first the Russians in the south who made an example of a bomb dread, and then Pan Fam, who *Literally Vily* learned that they had made my Titan primary with a spy before the FAXES were notified. There was literally one Levi which had made a bad warp, one Imperium Levi, and me. Those were the only primaries of the entire massacre.
---
That seems really artificial and you might as well remove ganking then because people will then complain about stealth bombers ( how are already being used in ganking ) etc etc.
---
Also 25 seconds 30 mil in catalysts won't kill a freighter: 
---
About 200 dps for a 3 million isk fit.
---
145000 - (((30/3) * 200) * 25) = 95000
---
A good chunk of Eve players (especially vets) are 30-something with a lot of real life obligations (kids, work, etc). You can be sure that nobody will berate you for not being active.
---
I never said I dumpstered a keepstar. No one gives a shit who Black Legion are. Origin is a Fraternity corporation. Try again.
---
Did I mention it's 2 jumps from Jita?
---
Wtf i thought what are those litte lights in the dark - fu**in rorqual swarms
---
Will manual posts have zero delay, or the previous delay for LS, NS and WH space?  
---
What will you do if (when?) someone makes a zkill clone using your API to get full feature parity with zero delay from their own ESI?
---
An isk sink is something that takes isk out of the game. The loot fairy does this everyday all day ...
---
Not, its not. But having everyone randomly changing channels ever 2 seconds is hilarious.
---
I work with 2 accounts at the same time
---
One hast around 300 buy orders and is therefore capped out, the other one has around 70 sell orders.
---
BUT it takes time to get there. Doing high reward low volume items (a lot if implants and expensive faction stuff) I still have a high chance to get an order fulfilled, because although the chance for a single one to go through is low, there still are 300 off them. My overall margin is estimated to be 30% (calculated by eve mogul). I also move a lot of stuff per day... something between 10 and 12 billion each day (buy and sell combined)
---
My total buy value is around 52billion with something around 14bil in escrow and around 30-34b in sell orders.
---
I also have to say, that the 1.5b is a pre tax change number, I am currently at my parents due to Uni vacation and can't do my full routine every day.
---
I estimate that I'm going to loose 25-30% profit.
---
Still so much is missing before reaching 420
---
Imagine the tax
---
https://evewho.com/corp/Origin. what is this all about? I mean, by all means don't commit to the game more than you want or real life allows, but these guys have really been cracking the whip.
---
Wow that is really impressive...im starting to do invention/manufacturing/station trading but ill probably never get that market understanding that you have
---
Hey, pretty sure you and me the only 2 left on this thread, but that's all good.
---
You make some good points. I think if I was to consider it from the point of view of a Market indexing scale that functions in the same way that Industry indexing works we do see the diffusion of activity for that flat bonus. It seems one of the key points here - that we aren't agreeing on - is whether it would affect behaviour.
---
Regarding Jita, I think what I did see through my own eyes is that between 2011 and late 2016 Jita went from the "main trade hub" to the defacto mega hub. Rens shrunk from 400 population to 100 population (and the other hubs had simlar contraction). So in this respect I reasonably say that Jita didn't happen over night.
---
Why are they not logging in?
---
I never haul out of Jita, all my sales are dine there, reason beeing - people are lazy as fuck
---
I trade in expensive module's with a high margins and a low trade volume. There are a lot of implants and a bunch of expensive faction stuff. Dealing with those items, people are willing to pay an extra 10-15% just for the sake of not having to jump into Perimeter. (Something may be 500mil in perimeter, I can easily sell it for 550-600 in Jita 4/4)
---
I occasionally have to haul stuff into Jita, but that's only a handful of items each week, mainly beeing implants that I carry in a shuttle - very few people actually risk getting concorded by smartbombing a shuttle off a gate XP
---
My buying range is 5 jumps and ONLY high sec
---
Was in a cap on grid... Survived the first wave then got sniped in the second... Got some pretty nice cap kills... Dread is insured so meh. Was fun.
---
By your metrics, dwarf fortress is a shitty game because fifa sells easy more copies than people dl df for free. It's a niche fucking game, I don't care if it only attracts 30k people. Who said we need everyone in the world to play this particular game? Anyway if you hate it so much, why do you play?
---
And yes, in a sandbox mmo most updates come in the form of minor qol upgrades and shit like skins, idk why you don't understand that. If you want a hand holding theme park, there's plenty of them. Trying to pre-empt the obviously true response to your bitching with "MUH" is not a convincing argument. 
---
Anyway, for all your criticism ccp is more profitable in recent years than ever, though I'll concede from types of revenue that are inferior than what they could get if they expanded the player base (primarily through regaining lost customers, if I had my druthers) Eve players tend to be loyal and hardcore, it's only in the recent years when ccp tried to appeal to the Minecraft/wow/fartnut demographic like you're advocating that numbers took a nosedive.
---
It comes really fast.
---
For me it's very simple
---
I use the evernus margin tool, because that factors in the taxes and fees you have to pay and then shows a coloured margin (green, yellow, red according to values that you can set)
---
The I buy everything with a profit higher than 10mil, a margin higher than 20% and a volume of more than 1 per day.
---
That leaves out most of the small stuff that needs a lot of attention. 
---
Once my profit gets higher, I drop the margin (for example, I might buy an item with a 120mil profit, even though the margin is 12-13% - surprisingly, there are quite a few of those).
---
Zkill gives everyone too much intel, not just the hunters. People trying to hide from hunters. People hunting hunters. People seeing how many guys usually in the wormhole gang of that bomber or malediction scout that just went by. What is their fleet comp? What kind of fits? When are they most active? So much free intel for everybody on every side. Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have enough information to pick the perfect fleet comp or solo ship to hard counter every time just based off a name you put into a website?
---
having exclusivity doesn't mean no one can compete, it means that no one does you braindead retard
---
Now we have nullified ships and people blow right through them.  You see so few because they are only formed when someone is around that they could actually be stopped. Normally whats the point?
---
TLDR: 20-30 man gatecamp can't stop 1 nullified ship. Why bother. Just boson the gate, it's more effective.
---
Squizz, I just whitelisted my adblocker to your site because of your good work. I would donate isk, but I'm space poor. This is the best I got. Love ya man. :P
---
They have probably normalized the numbers somehow to account for this
---

---

---

---
Lol I once solo’d an Intie in a jackdaw, hate to break it to you but most people wouldn’t count that as a legitimate solo kill
---
They might have to... you know, go out roaming for the enemy now!
---
Shock! Playing the game instead of playing the tools and logging in for the pings.
---
Well then I guess you shouldn't mine yet, until you can afford the permit fee.
---
The people watching zkill for enemies are usually trying _not_ to fight them.
---
So you saying it is a cool game is the metric here? You fuckin dimwit. Of course Dwarf fortress is a shitty game compared to Fifa. There is only one metric here, number of people that plays the game. And Eve is doing terrible there. 
---
What you don't understand is mediocre programmers and developers failing to fix a broken game for more than a decade and calling it "sandbox" as an excuse to cover their failure. It is like calling a bug a feature. 
---
"CCP is more profitable in recent years than ever" what a fuckin joke. After CCP has been sold to PA and laid off so many people. They used to employ 5 economists just to keep the inflation of in game market. And now we have PLEX costing more than 3.5m a piece. Fuckin RIP.
---
Looks like you have been living in your own fantasy world there mate. Eve's golden age was back in 2011. It was only downhill from that point. I know it is hard for you to accept that your precious little game that you invested so much money and so many hours into is dying, but there is nothing you or CCP can do to prevent it at this point. The train is already derailed and it is just a matter of time before it crashes. Watching it is fun though.

Possibly not?

The bad news is that CCP's data shows damage caps are a massive success resulting in longer, more meaningful, engagements.
---
Coming soon each anom or belt is going to have a harvesting cap to allow your miners to also benefit from this innovative mechanic.

CCP would like to thank all of its customers for enabling its emergent data analysis techniques.

There are other killboards, so wtf are *you* talking about?
---
I think this answer is akin to someone saying they're not happy with a restaurant's food, and being told to start their own.  I'm not proficient in programming, hosting my own application, or general webdev. It's pretty dismissive. I can give feedback. 
---
My comment re 'larger groups' was as n+1 is a constant in EVE, you're likely to find front-end webdev, in a corp or alliance, who have some time to grab and host their own zkill. We have some great devs in our corp/alliance, but I'm not going to push on them to use their free time to do more work. But it may become more necessary if it becomes an advantage.
---
please biomass (in game)
---
how about you fucking undock and do some of the scouting work yourself. or better yet, actually create content instead of just trying to blob somebody else's
---
I do lmao 
---
this just reduces how much content my corp gets
---
I'm not in init, but seddow's goku fleets regularly sit on grid with hostile Titan/super/dread/fax fleets and still get lots of capital kills. Kikimoras/harpies/bombers with logi just light up fighters, booshers get us out of the way of anything dangerous and help pull out fighters, and bombs can sometimes wipe subcaps that make the mistake of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

---
Solid choice.
---
... and no arrogant, 'If you send me a help request I will call you an idiot' message from the administrator.
---
 The best is Caldari but not by much, only cuz when you set your deathclone to your school it’s near Jita (the main trade hub)
---
which isn’t that big of a deal but it’s the only thing that practically differentiates the races in Eve.
---
I've got some ideas.
---
I spend 3-4 hours a night on my hobbies if not longer. Not sure why you would say 4-8 hours over a week isn't fairly casual, seems like it is to me.
---
The reason why I have sympathy is because streamers and anyone who creates YouTube or otherwise EVE content helps raise the public profile of the game.
---
Other than that yeah ofc if you're doing something sensitive and you're streaming it and you get killed because you're streaming if all you care about is pulling the trick, you wuld have been better off not streaming :)
---
tldr
---
Sure but you could stream on a delay, you could record the footage instead of streaming, you could do stuff that's better for streaming, etc. We still get content.
---
nah I’m brain dead
---
blackout bad REEEEEEE
---
When every coalition in the game has an ESI fed discord channel giving out the intel of what structure is being attacked and by who it’s a problem.
---
Ah i see well i hope i get to make some ISK out of trade some time as well. Thanks for your time to give me a little insight into your work! O7
---
You are mostly correct. I want to note, however, that I’m talking about Caldari morality and their value system, which obviously will not be reflected in EVE’s reality at a larger scale. It’s a dystopian setting, after all. I’m mostly going by the average citizen’s perspective as detailed in *EVE: Source*.

Just started playing and joined a highsec corp stationed out in BFE. Am new (almost 2 weeks gameplay), and wanting to look into hauling/ industry. Is there a free-use google sheet or anything with updating prices, or any guides on how to build one that anyone can recommend? Just looking to be able to track my costs and profits, and as I've heard this referd to as spreadsheets in space, trying to get a grasp on how to go about that before i get to far into it and wish i had a record.
---
I agree that what missions are available to level one agents needs looking into. I am stuck on a mission that the various sites say is a level 3 mission. Yet I got it at one.
---
CCP plays at caring about new players but let this buggy ass mission system get ignored.
---
Not "chaos era" but a shake up of the trade meta: Market Tax Indexing like System Industry Indexing. (I swear reddit has an echo)
---
That's honestly beautiful. Mesmerising almost.
---
Create your accounts through a link such as this and you will get 1million skill points (20 days worth of training) instantly, to be applied to whatever skills you want.

---
I know you said you would be playing as omega but I would then recommend making *one-off* purchases of the following just to further boost your starting skills.
---
- The special deal where you get your first month omega for half price ($5)
---
- The starter set for an additional instant 1million skill points ($5 dollars again)
---
So for using the referral link and a one off purchase (not a subscription, just as if you were buying any other game) you now have 3 months worth of skills upfront.
---
Now what to do with them to make Isk?
---
Join a high sec incursions group (Group Co-op PvE) such as 'Warp to Me'.
---
A noob friendly starter fit such as their WTM standard Maelstrom fit costs 200mil isk and will earn you around 100 - 120 mil isk per hour. For context the VexorNavyIssue which was just nerfed for being too efficient used to get 90-100 mil per hour and someone doing pve in a carrier (costing about 2 *Billion* isk fully fit) will get about 120 mil too. So this is basically the best isk you can get as an alpha, and is even almost on par with the endgame farmers.
---
Make 100mil per hour within your first month of eve.  Spend 1-2 hours doing that and you can afford to welp frigates and destroyers for the rest of the week without worrying about money.
---
I mean... It is Kotaku after all...
---
To be honest, this is elite mining. I actually wanted to come back when they introduced the excavator drones, but meh.
---
CODE playstyles might not be my playstyles, but they keep hisec dangerous, as it should be.
---
I respect CODE more than I respect the nullblocs.
---
CSM is full of bias null-blockers who's best interest is to retain asset safety and remove blackout. 
---
Just look at Dunk's blogs. Look at all the posts by Goonswarm on Reddit. Etc.
---
I honestly hope CCP has the balls to continue the "Chaos Era", and not listen to the bias CSM.
---
I'm thinking 700 dps on a T2 fit but I guess those are closer to 10mil. In any case, it's going to take no where near 1B worth of just the empty hull, even for a max tank fit.
---
Send an ingame mail to Shani Amaris if you wanna know more.
---
No guarantee for an immediate answer, but one will come at some point XP
---
Gross, nullbloc fleets? Boring.
---
my porsche does not stream.
---
no but you can pick of one here and there with each boosh, the logi, there long points/webs, and the CMDs, or even better the FC
---
wait for boosh light up, put long scram on the AF at the front.
---
its not easy i will give you that. And i think maybe normal warp disrupter could be able to stop you jumping?  
---
but i like that you can jump bubbles and through them.
---
&gt; 4) introduce changes to the game only after a thorough discussion with the entire community of players .
---
This is good, how do you ensure the entire community is spoken with?  Would there be an NDA involved so CCP are free to spitball without players assuming it is coming next week?
---
Can you point me to the posts by goon leadership (as you invoked Brave leadership) saying that they hate the blackout. Feel free to include a timestamp from a broadcast as an alternative.

thanks

Scavengers watch zkill to 3rd party events they didn't start. With zkill there is a live stream feature which loads kill as they happen, within minutes. The longer a fight happens, the more time it gives someone crawling zkill to get the intel and show up themselves.

Boy, you sure are pissy. Try to talk like a big boy, though, it's not my problem you're having a bad day. Most of my posts are about how the game has gone down hill, so I don't exactly know where you get the idea that I have my head in the sand. My only point is that any idiot that has ever even read about eve knows it is and always has been a niche game, such things exist. I wouldn't support turning dwarf fortress into something it's not just so it can be like fifa, because there's already fifa. We can't all be number one, no matter how many participation trophies you may have gotten in your life that state the contrary. Clearly there are many metrics that make games appealing, which is why there is more than one of them in any given genre. 
---
If you're of the opinion that the only things of value in this world are the absolute most popular in their class, we have to agree to disagree. I don't need all of my music to sound like the current billboard top ten pop (not that I really have a problem with pop, but I like variety), I don't need to exclusively eat hamburgers because McDonald's is the most successful "restaurant" on the planet, I don't need all of my games to be samey, lowest common denominator crap that appeal to the maximum number of people possible at the expense of any unique experience you may be able to achieve. 
---
It's a 16 year old game anyway, it's not going to magically become the next LoL out of nowhere anyway, whatever they do. I only care about ccp/pa's bottom line to the extent that it keeps the servers online, to be honest, and I'm certainly not so obsessed with people I don't know making money to the point that I want them to totally change a game I enjoy into the next "wow killer" (none of those games succeed anyway, if you've noticed. There's wow, and then there are games with smaller niches, the rest fail).
---
I like eve, but that doesn't mean everyone has to. I really don't understand a person like you being obsessed with a game you hate, wishing it was a different game *that already exists*. Seems like a strange hobby to me. And like I said, dumbing things down, making things safer, and spending years trying to perfect the "npe" are exactly the things they've been doing in the time player count has taken a massive dump. Eve is too inherently complex to successfully make compromises that cater to the casuals, we can see the results of those efforts in the player stats, so I don't really know what you want them to *do*. Eve's steepest decline was in the period that it's been the safest.
---
You want to completely throw out the sandbox? Instanced everything? Opt-in pvp flags? What exactly? I've not heard a single idea, just frankly rabid, rambling nonsense without much of a point. A company only has to be profitable to be worth operating, microbreweries etc don't just decide to shut down because they're not as popular as bud light, lmao. If eve is to have any hope to survive, 16 year old persistent universe spaghetti code mess that it is, it needs to appeal to the players and types of players that have always been the core audience. What you're asking for is a new game entirely (I guess, you haven't really made any concrete suggestions, so I have to infer what sort of logic if any you're using).
---
Nobody is suggesting the Eve equivalent of the Taliban being able to invade the mainland US, but I am suggesting the equivalent of 9/11 should be possible through ingame mechanics.

Is evernus still downloadable? Cant find working links...
---
I've definitely downloaded EVE before 2016, so I guess it just was never deleted.
---
I thought it is still usable since (1) it wasn't removed, (2) info about it wasn't removed and (3) one can still freely download it.

So I guess instead of repair.exe I should use Verify cache nowadays, am I right?

I get it but the ability to have intel channels let’s lots more players give intel then being on a voice program would.
---
Discord has written channels as well.
---
Awesome!
---
10 disappeared before you stopped? You were the kid who used to keep putting quarters in the machine after it ate the first few weren’t you?
---
Yep but it would be much more difficult to get people to do intel in third party program
---
So we get a new killboard that doesnt have a delay?
---
Fuck you krab
---
Yeah I will definitively still do that. I really liked it as a solo activity. We’ll probably try it as a duo.
---
Is pvp so hard to do nowdays?
---
i like the blackout, and i like the non existance of out of game api, would make the game more.... in the game... lol
---
Never not make the same post 4 times
---
You could build it today if you wanted to. I think that's /u/squizz's point
---
Well when I was contracting it went a little like this:
---
1. Oh look, there are only 15 of those left on contracts. I best put up ten more so I'm hitting the target amount.
---
2. Then I hit copy contract and followed it through 10 times.
---
3. Now I go to check my other contracts and I'm surprised to see that the new ones are there and the old ones are not.
---
4. Now I try it with one more and I'm like "huh, that's weird..." so then I note down exactly what I do with screenshots and send it to CCP.
---
So you see, sometimes people aren't as dumb as you might think. Give people the benefit of the doubt in the future instead of being an internet smart arse.
---
Delete the other three posts plz
---
Yeah I checked both corp and personal and not there :( just double checked again to make sure.
---
Cheers though

Looking at the Perun Video it almost looks like it's one of those NPC super ships

You will never ever speed-tank a HAW dread in a battleship. Just as an example, this is a HAW Revelation with no application mods shooting a 500MN battleship going 2,000m/s (so like a nano machariel with links or snakes): https://imgur.com/tLhv3Ui
---
The Rev in this case is using Scorch which gives it a 63km optimal range and 1433 DPS on paper. As you can see, it applies almost all of its damage at optimal range, and decently even outside optimal, otherwise it can just switch ammo. You get very slightly better results on a 100MN fit, but it still applies over half its damage. 
---
As for bosons, it's not a question of speed, it's a question of not getting caught in boson range. If you do, and it's aimed well, your only recourse is probably an MJD.
---
Hey thanks for all the advices!
---
I already have 2 accounts with three characters each. My main has 3.6 millions SP and with all my characters I have a combined wealth of 500 mil ISK. So not that great but not worth starting from scratch. Next steps will be to combine and convert all my assets to my main.
---
After that I’ll probably look into joining a corp. Last time I was in Signal Cartel for the exploration. Might do that with my main and have one alt join a big pve or pvp Corp.
---
Should go the whole hog and take letters and numbers out of the game tbh.
---
Thanks for the recommendations, I’ll look into those!
---
Did you reply to the wrong post?
---
I’m off to a super strong start, clearly.
---
this is all information available from the API, if I'm going to show the killmail and include the link to the API verified killmail, then I might as well show everything
---
I was told that was already done, why hasn't it already been done? Get going would you
---
It's his feed to do with what he wants.
---
You made zero counter arguments to what I said in my previous post. Who said anything about turning eve into wow or any other game? Eve is not a popular game not because it is a niche game, but because it sucks to deliver what it even promises. It uses sandbox argument to cover it's lack of QOL features, It is still to this day full of bugs, new players leave after first 2 hours because fuck having a proper tutorial since players have tools to explain their game better than the developers themselves(eve-uni wiki), and it is a credit-card warrior game since you can buy anything in the game with real money, even skill points.   
---
Back to the orginal argument, high sec ganking is a stupid "sandbox" "feature" that is here since the beginning. But that does not mean it should stay like that. It only serves as a tool for mentally unstable people to have their enjoyment through annoying other people. So basically, few people having their fun while ruining many mores first time experience, hence the low player retention rates.

With your play schedule the stability of a nullbock might be what you need.

Because no effort goes into keeping a nullblock afloat. Fucking ez mode scrubs the lot of them.

Exactly
---
Just tank it like a man. The DPS is not that catastrophic - about two regular battleships' worth. Just get a battleship comp that features enough logi to sustain that. Guardians work well, as HAWs won't apply to them at all.
---
That’s my point
---
What a retard dropping a rag on your exeq when he already had Nyx on grid

Imagine enjoying playing with other people. God damn.

Societies have rules.

For possible fits check out eve-uniwiki but they mostly outdated.

Or u check www.zkillboard.com for fitts

Keep up the good work btw love the direction things have been heading in since blackout 👍
---
Im more ok with that. My freakin aquarium sends me a text message if it gets too hot, and its 2019. That my small city gives me a call when someone shoots lasers at it seems ok. 
---
That i hear about something on the other side of the world instantly and in perfect detail, without checking myself, less so.
---
1 for each additional character
---
No problem, just make sure your friend uses  a referral code when he joins for the free kickstart.
---
Also that starter bundle I was talking about isn't actually limited to new accounts. I just used it on my 6year old account for 1mil skill points. Still useful for heading down a different training route.
---
As for making isk I still standby HS Incursions. I have an alpha toon just for incursions, and it's worth the initial $10 set up.
---
The blackout will be great for pvp
---
My alliance just uses a intel channel you just drag the system and name of pulpit into the channel can’t do that in discord
---
I also disagree with the change. I feel like making this change will make people switch to other killboards, since people don’t want to wait 2 hours to see kills.
---
Remove ESI completely. Kill ALL external ESI based services completely.
---
I know, I know, to the crucifiction, along this floor, second door to the right, only one cross.
---
We get that "Intel" from people linking their deaths in alliance or fleet chat. Zkill is just used to view someones history (oh I see this guys lost a lot of covert cyno ships, probable hotdropper).
---
Nothing much will change with this delay. He'll, you dont even need people to link killmails, our Intel about what fleet comp to use mainly comes from scouts.
---
My prediction is when the zkill delay fails to change anything, people will just move on the the next scape goat.  Probably how dscan is too powerful lol.
---
There is an account MCT for 19.99 on the eve website as well which allows you to train all 3 chars IIRC
---
Someone's homework has been copied!
---
a T3 has 5 years align nullified, easy to decloak with a ceptor. A ceptor is useless in a jammed system
---
Probably bad but I blame CCP for allowing it to happen
---
They (CCP) are winding up towards a feature where people can submit fits in game, have them rated, and the best fits will appear in game for others to see. Because they realize there are no centralized sources of fits otherwise. You either ask around and hope for good replies. Or you poke around the killboards and hopefully figure out what was good about the fits, and what got them killed.
---
It's the same as the in-game item; +1 training slot. You're better off buying plex, then buying the in-game item. (500PLEX is the same price as 1 MCT on the website, while the in- game MCT is 485 PLEX iirc)
---
Serenity is back but this time, is in tranquility...
---
Imma pull a Falcon , if it was up to me I would totally get rid of zkill , now all your kills and dead’s becomes hear say lol 😝 
---
And get rid of stab cores and get rid of safety net and get rid of stargates and get rid of capitals and get rid of fleets and get rid of local and finally get rid of Eve .... yes !
---
DiamondGeezer63 is for sure still on Waterfall. :joy:
---
So is the nullsec black out Actually happening? Was it temporary? 
---
Also. Was local just gone if people didn't talk in it? Or was it a timer before you showed up?  
---
I keep finding conflicting reports and I can't get online for a few more days.
---
No, killboard can be distributed according to it's license, and killboards code is on github
---
Like any given alliance, a mega coalition, anything specific?
---
Probably the best compliment you are going to get

Have you Checked delivery Hangar and Corp delivery Hangar

Blops would be the ideal for me, bombing runs, etc. I like ambush-style combat. Bombers Bar would be perfect except they’re never active when I can play :-/
---
I didnt have my micro activated. I landed and died
---
...so it's copied then.
---
Well, the best I can hope for from reddit.
---
I should add : vaporize a 188 fleetmen horde ferox in instant :)
---
No it doesnt. Slap a TP or a web on one of the leshaks and you're good to go.
---
it don't work this way
---
The actual analogy would be "a random bot maker shutting down doesn't solve the bot problem. CCP needs to fix it."
---
And after accepting their accept you need to accept your accept and then let them accept it.
---
convince me your posting is needed in this sub
---
The biggest draw (audience wise) for streaming is in the interaction with the streamer. That goes away on delay or recording only. Not to say that your argument isn't valid, but it kinda ruins the whole point of the stream.

---
Hey man  I just wanted to say thanks. Bought myself a Drake and fitted it out as best I can. Appreciate the time you took to come up with the fit. I understand it's weak in PVP but I knew that already.
---
it takes about 150ish for max tank skill if your using catalysts, also means 47 toons with max skills, I also not account for gate guns there so you're likely more around 200 mil and 50 toons.
---
Like toon limitations are a bigger problem here then DPS, keep in mind for a gank to be profitable it needs to have double the cargo value then the ships used ( as the drop rate is about 50/50 ). 
---
It also removes the smaller fleet setup ganks are a lot of those depend on taloses oracles and tornado's etc ( slightly worse dps to isk ratio but higher toon to dps ratio ), as managing 50 toons on grid is a pain the ass.
---
It's pretty much the same as your own corps "TEST Intel tool"
---
This is a good change, delays info while also letting you check characters history to get an idea of what hes flying.
---
Huh oh ok:
---
 * randomly deactivate gates for 3-6 hours
---
 * change pve spawn tables so npcs that are stronger than usual can spawn + web scram of course
---
 * miscalculate routes so that people fly through lowsec by "accident"
---
 * make npc corps *demand* you do missions for them in 1-3 hours or you lose standing, repeat until the faction shoots you
---
 * ...
---
I mean... there are so many systems in eve that could be messed with.
---
Where do I start. First of all, good luck getting most of New Eden to use a killboard labelled "winterco." There's going to be a good chunk of people that won't just for that reason. Secondly, a 1:1 copy of zkill isn't going to buy you any good faith, is you're trying to take a share of the market at least put some effort in besides hosting someone else's work.
---
Does he mean "faction" or does he only want a piece of a module?
---
You can not program out human nature to succeed.
---
Look at my username
---
awesome, i loved the killboard blackout! this will be a good medium.
---
Hey thanks for the advice w/ regards to a Drake and PVE vs  PVP content
---
It's just your post is complaining about a change being made to something outside of eve, saying that something inside of eve needs to change.
---
They're basically all the same now
---
This would have more consequences to anything than you realize, this would just completely remove any sense of a ingame community at all as some, or a big part of the game cant have a third party chat system. This will also just kill off people that are mute, deaf, no mic, etc. Dont say "Oh juST uSe dIscoRd" because they wont. Its difficult for people to switch back and forth between eve and discord every 2 seconds. Especially if you only have one monitor. So if you want to kill off a shitload of things and whole communities even in favor of no more intel channels, there you go.
---
Many thanks, friend.
---
&gt;Winterco. 
---
Stop exploding you cowards.
---
https://i.imgur.com/OUH0uWq.gifv
---
I wasn't around back then, but I never see them used so I assume not. Looking at a fit I just threw up in pyfa, they just get out-performed by a guardian in most respects. I'd only use them for a covert doctrine.
---
who knows, maybe we will have 420 before the end of the year :)
---
They can still copy and paste a name, and physically write the system name in discord. It would be no difference aside from idiots
---
Fractured modules are all the hype nowadays.
---
I know a corp that might be a good fit for you. Capital Fusion (CAPF)
---
RNG
---
Mostly it's ammo in those special spawns, sometimes you're lucky and something cool and/or expensive drops.
---
How long did this take to write with all the sobbing?
---
This is all Hilmar is actually trying to do. He wants the game to be on the news and stuff again.
---
You'd think that, but as soon as people want their instant intel they will absolutely pull that URL instead of waiting 2 hours.
---
Looks like input broadcasting to me. 😑
---
It's his work, he can do what he wants with it. Piss off with the self entitled attitude.
---
At least you’re prepared for it
---
The best start is learning mechanics, becoming skilled in actual strategy and tactics. Skill points are a secondary consideration. I know CCP tries to cram those microtransactions for sp at us but all that did was make.evweyone think they need to immediately skill into capitals. This shitting up this once great game.
---
Wars should be included theyre apart of the ebb and flow of eve.  Seems like measuring rainfall, but excluding hurricanes.
---
Wait, if it’s $20 to train an additional character per month, why would I not just create new accounts and upgrade them to omega instead??
---
&gt;marroc
---
7o
---
yup ISK faucet. 26m - 45.8m added to the game.
---
Well then that's stupid... my fault. I could have sworn it unlocked the entire account
---
I agree on the learning game mechanics and not just skill injecting into capitals, but my experience when I first joined was to buy omega, set up my skill queue and go play dota for 3 months until I could actually do something in EVE. 
---
I found a way to skip this first 3 months of being useless after making my own alts recently and though I should share the method.
---
Or create their own non-politicized version that everyone will use. Or iterate on it and being added value besides being an exact replica with no delay
---
Be brave! Always undock! Always take bait! Do all the things! Join all the fleets! Go on all the roams!

Eh, someone here doesn't earn money on it - no ads, so didn't want to pay for .com domain, and I guess made it an ad for winterco auth website xD. If you have a problem please host your own neutral killboard, I'll auth myself on it too. Besides zkb isn't neutral.
---
It's not the most profit/min but with 2 guys it can be ultra safe
---
I dont mind at all personally. But getting any major non-winterco entities to use it is laughable when they can copy paste and rehost their own versions just as easily.
---
I see you went to the same economic classes Himar did.
---
Imagine believing this

---
That's always been the way I do it for the same reason. Just refer yourself through recruit a friend when you make a second account. That way you'll get some rewards and actually be able to log into both at once if you want to.
---
generally because we trusted you as the guy running it to not make changes that affect the game
---
it was turn off when you turned zkill back up X)
---
You need to tell what kind of abyss you're doing. Also, you're using passive defenses, you need active ones. Use shield boosters instead of extenders. Avoid extenders since they add up to your signature, and that's what you're tanking with.
---
His site, his rules.  Don't like it then build your own site to parse out the info that CCP gives out.
---
Your character on the additional training queue stays omega if your main is also omega, so if you want to create an alt that you use very little and never at the same time as your main (PI, hauling, etc.), it's a worthwhile use of the slot.
---
Just in case you aren't trolling. Wingspan have the running joke of sending evemails out to people they kill that they have successfuly delivered whatever ammunition they used to kill you with.
---
I posted this to a similar question above:
---
.
---
I wrote this as a reply to someone in the weekly FAQ thread, but I thought it would be good for others thinking of starting playing, and it's also IMO currently the best way of kickstarting the skillpoints of new alts which you plan to use as an alpha after initial training.
---
________________________________________________________________________________________________
---
**obviously if you're making an alt rather than being a new player you would use your own referral code**
---
I would then recommend making *one-off* purchases of the following just to further boost your starting skills. 
---
I.e. *not a subscription, just one time purchases as if you were buying any other normal game*
---
- The special deal where you get your first month omega for half price ($5) *you will get an in game notification in game with this after completing the tutorial.*
---
- The starter set for an additional instant 1million skill points ($5 dollars again) *Check DLC section of the EVE website*
---
So for using the referral link and a one off purchase (not a subscription, just as if you were buying any other game) you now have 3 months worth of skills upfront. 
---
_____________________________________________
---
&gt;Now what to do with those skill points  to make Isk?
---
A noob friendly starter fit such as their WTM standard Maelstrom fit costs 200mil isk and will earn you around 100 - 120 mil isk per hour.
---
For context the VexorNavyIssue which was just nerfed for being too efficient used to get 90-100 mil per hour and someone doing pve in a carrier (costing about 2 *Billion* isk fully fit - yes billion with a B) will get about 120 mil too. So this is basically the best isk you can get as an alpha, and is even almost on par with the endgame farmers (on a per account basis, at least). 
---
Make 100mil per hour within your first month of eve!
---
**Spend an hour doing that and you can afford to welp frigates and destroyers in PvP letting you actually play the game doing what you want for the rest of the week without worrying about farming money to fuel it.**
---
Wow
---
Remove esi alltogether.   
---
Make cynos behave like polarized weapons (no resists to anyone that fits them).   
---
Drifters attack you depending on how much infastructure you hold and now they can entosis
---
True, but the alternative (new account) also has those same benefits for $15/month, only difference being convenience if you don't want multiple accounts I suppose.
---
Trump
---
Sure, but doesn't mean it's not bad for the game.
---
Seems like an odd choice by CCP, especially since multiple accounts are not forbidden.
---
Not as easy as copy+paste url into web browser...
---
Pretty sure that referral mustn't be used for an alt account.
---
It's somewhere in the T&amp;C.
---
Im not exactly sure what consequence breaking the NDA has for the CSM members, but the resulting drama and fallout if CCP boots a CSM member for less than valid reasons  would cause a lot of headache and issues for CCP.
---
Damn that's really good! Gonna use that thanks :D
---
If you want the new account to be training all the time, a subscription is cheaper. I've given the alt slots on my main accounts a few MCT's, and now they've always got Omega things available without any extra cost. (Cloaky haulers, mining barges, PI, more build/research slots etc)
---
Or any group that relies on opsec really.
---
You guys are so elite killing targets that can't fight back and bragging about it.
---
Just about everyone making new alts uses the referral. If it's not in accordance with the TOS then this rule is not enforced.
---
TEST be like that
---
I like the random gate deactivation thing. Maybe leaving some systems isolated for days?
---
Same thing can be done with an alt, correct? Subscribe to omega for the months necessary for the skills you want that are omega exclusive, then unsubscribe.
---
Yes, technicaly it's a copy, but having a licence to do so makes the copy a legal activity. It's not like copying homework, since that homework have an implied licence that makes it private to the owner, even if that person allows you to copy it since the authority is the school, not the student.
---
Remove insurance. Helps fix inflation too.
---
So you need opsec is nobody has it?
---
Because rules are for suckers, right? :D
---
It's viable, particular lot during blackout, but it's infinity better if you can find even just one person to go with you as you can then bombing run excavators.
---
I don't know of this is frowned upon, but maybe jump into bombers bar chat when they *arnt* running a fleet and see if anyone fancies an unofficial roam?
---
Did you have a stroke? Are you ok?
---
This would be cool. I play with a band of mates, we've all passed billions between each other, lent titans, supers, AT ships and all sorts. I trust we'd be okay.
---
All you alliance line member 63,158 types would be fucked!
---
Cant wait, hope they implement.
---
If it is done people will come up with other ideas for instant intel mate. Just requires a bit more work.
---
dark abyss
---
Thanks for at least taking the time to explain why you consider me wrong. No one else could be fucked to. It's not me that your feeding to, I just came back and need cash myself to get my stuff out of asset safety, so I've been ratting myself in a subcap. though admittedly in much less heavily farmed space than provi (Cache). Your alliance needs to be able to secure the space that you live in or you just own too much space.
---
Bait ops may be enough to clear HTP blops off of you guys. Whether that would be a sacrificial HAW dread to gank 2 or 3 blops battleships before going down to the escalation (isk positive!), or bombers cloaked off of a miner or ratter for the same purpose. Eventually HTP would fuck off if they lose the isk war every drop, their killboard is too valuable. 
---
Then it comes down to having a small QRF fleet (seriously, 3 hacs, T3s or battle cruisers and one tackle is enough) on standy in each main ratting system at all times for killing those lokis and stratioses. May be decent loot money in defending space actually, if you consistently win fights.
---
Or you can make money in highsec and over farm abysals and bitch about the time before CCP "made bull worthless". Fine with me, my ratting sites will become more valuable then over time as the buying power of my ISK increases, my ore will be worth more (already seeing effects), and I'll be able to enjoy the gameplay of the more spooky, more dangerous null that we have now, defending my friends. 
---
I actually lost my myrm (and all 4 of my mtus) last night to a stratios, a hound and a curse, but it had made twice what it was worth and I killed the bomber in the processes (dumbass just sat there and took it, but hey, first solo kill since returning). And then I joined the defense fleet with my proc and helped to bait in an assfrig/t3d gang into a trap. I really like this gameplay, sorry that you don't.
---
Just to clarify are you implying that Blackout is bad and only ESI delay should be implemented? That wouldn't help with chaos that would only help krabs. Only if you have both blackout and delay it results in chaos.
---
"Unknown" is probably the rat on your killmail.
---
I've done that kind of gatecamps all on my own, and no, it's doesn't have to be input broadcast, slide fingers F1-F8, click next button on numpad to switch window.
---
You do realize that this is a game? Rules and how you play it can change.
---
Was possibly his alt and he dropped it to kill possible future cyno inhib
---
Perhaps we should just point them in the direction of every fireside chat recording since the blackout
---
My doorbell texts me a picture of every person who steps foot on my porch. Shouldn't i be able to program a jump gate to do the same thing? (Following the aquarium logic...)
---
Nope... You can't really have total chaos if one side has a major advantage...
---
Personally I think it's worth having a highsec incursion alt.
---
See below for what I've been writing to other people about this:
---
Create your alt account through a link such as this and you will get 1million skill points (20 days worth of training) instantly, to be applied to whatever skills you want. 
---
**The goal is to make Isk, so you will be leaving this as F2P/Alpha after initial training.**
---
 
---
**Spend an afternoon doing it and you have farmed whatever non super hull you want**
---
If you understand and can manipulate the technology, sure. If you built it / own it, you should be able to do that. If you can hack it, you should be able to do that.   
---
But you shouldn't get it for free by virtue of also playing the game. Does your neighbor also get a message when someone rings your doorbell?
---
Or, and i think this is a much better idea, you can stop being a little bitch baby because CCP doesn't kowtow to your will.
---
He's referring to the fact that your sentence made no sense. You typed something wrong.
---
Basically what they have done with no local
---
Absolutely not. This rule, however, is likely just a safeguard for CCP to have some recourse for when people find a way to badly abuse the referral programme.
---
People whose sole purpose in life is to ruin the fun of others exist. And we'd like to not have to play with them.
---
ok fair enough I agree then
---
Jurius doctor has the best channel with detailed newbie tutorials imo.
---
Using your own referrals is something that's common knowledge among people that have played long enough to have multiple alts. I wasn't aware it was technically against ToS.
---
If it is in there then I assume it's for use at CCPs discretion for people just rinsing the referall rewards without genuinely wanting the alt? For example 1 irl rich person flooding the market with the limited edition ships or marketeering in some other similar way.
---
Low drop chance on faction modules and for the most part completely random what module you actually get.
---
Christ you're unclear on the concept of "3rd-party tool" aren't you.
---
OP's *only* responsibility is to make OP happy.
---
Also, ITT: so many shitwits.
---
Was there a bee sticker in your daughters backpack?
---
Telling a bunch of players happily going about in their system to not play the game they like because "chaos".
---
Lol. Terrific idea.
---
CCP has done a huge nerf of faction and officer drops been a few years now tho
---
Well said.
---
You copy-paste this to any chat window you have. Or even to window with notes (I remember EvE client having notes editor?). Then you copy-paste the string to any external program.
---
Sure. Though again, the VNI isnt a very good pure droneboat anymore.
---
That fit is significantly more expensive for not much extra benefit. Might as well just go Myrm.
---
How do spaceships oxidize?
---
The pre-play screen looks like a stellar converter from moo2.
---
Not at all, people can chat in all the other channels that aren't giving free intel out.
---
It's technically an option.
---
I'm not suggesting it though. I was being sarcastic.
---
Personally, I think all of the free intel should be eliminated. Dotlan, Zkill, and even the in-game maps. Turn it all off - make blackout really mean blackout and let's see what happens.
---
Why not just light the cyno when you see an inhib start to go up, you have an entire minute lol
---
thank you very much ;)
---
Sometimes you’re in a different standing fleet or it’s full or whatever and you need time to change I guess.
---
I like that, you can still nyx rat but need a cloaky cyno, even ccp should like it because the nyx rat/bot is worse than anything else to plex market and their bottom line, requires zero alts subbed.
---
Lol wat.   
---
I was pointing out to the op the he himself explained why what he's doing is a bad idea. Turns out his attitude to zkill has changed since then as per the response from him I linked in another comment.
---
You can't play if gates are deactivated? TIL
---
catching someone who doesnt want to be caught has its own merit
---
It was our corp event.
---
It was our Corp event.
---
Sure, but you aren't elite for using gimmicky game mechanics to ensure that your targets can't shoot you back. 100% chance they tuck tail and dock up when anything that isn't a solo destroyer down is scouted warping to them.
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/osmium/ships/
---
Drone velocity is a big deal considering the distances involvedand you can't use sentries. It's essentially a free drone nav computer in the mid slots.
---
You can use a mobile depot and mtu more smoothly. It's less unwieldy and finicky.
---
You just drop the mobile depot on top of yourself. Refit as the site progresses to add more drone speed/tracking/damage in place of tank if you're overtanking. I think a dualrep myrm might be a little better than the pure passive but I'd have to really start running numbers.
---
Though if you're trying to do C3 sites, you really want to upgrade to a rattlesnake, dominix, or gila.
---
Came here to say this. 
---
Also how many warp cores are those BS running? Cowards
---
DEATH TO CODE!
---
Sure,sure. Can you fill the class in on the magic gate camp comp that will do both? Then count the number of pilots needed to counter the single ship? How likely it is to decloak in time? All the factors that make it so unlikely that the T3 is interdicted it's as well as null. Let's see the gatecamps deaths of T3's this week. I can't find one.
---
But then stream-sniping is an interaction too. One has to choose....
---
Oh sorry. I forgot mindless crabs just sit in their rorqs everyday whether gates are working or not.
---
Poor memeing because the two 'bad' corporate drone ideas on here are actually good ideas.
---
That’s literally not what high sec means.
---
No, because most channels are based on social groupings, not on being in the same system. Local is terrible for community chat because to carry on with a conversation you have to stay in the same place.
---
Damn, that looks sharp!
---
But.. but why? Why not just warp in the catalysts?
---
I find it incredible how negative people are. They always search for ways in which ideas can fail, rather than to look for ways things can succeed.
---
In the case of deactivating gates, you could set it up so that only links in a chain are interrupted and you have to go the long way or a more dangerous way.
---
&gt; Whoops. Something went wrong. This clip is no longer available.
---
heh
---
Ah that makes sense!  Cheers
---
An alpha can't utilize omega skills. For a PI account, a cloaky hauler, a jita alt, or a cyno toon, those omega skills are essential.
---
None, was in NULL sec.
---
Well, we are pirates and this game is not designed for solo gameplay. Gimmicky sure. It's legal and allowed. It's your fault if you die to that, not ours. :)
---
Ah, okay, I see the difference now. So if someone wanted to train additional characters indefinitely, alts are the cheapest, but if they’re only training for a specific role then MTC is better.
---
Dscan will show probes. Dscan will show his friends showing up. Dscan will save you. If you’re afraid of a 1v1 then you shouldn’t be in null sec and you shouldn’t be taking the risk.
---
Dumbass.
---
Cyno now needs a dedicated ship to light it \[with faction variants of course\] with a single high slot so no cloaky cyno, so that anyone can potentially see who will drop caps?
---
Was awhile ago. Just found the gif from it. Here is the zkill from one kill.

Destructible stargates from both sides so you can isolate systems turning them into pseudo wormhole systems.
---
Still waiting on my app too, I'll be a bittervet by the time it goes through :D

1. Gold sink.
---
2. Encourage people to use Citadels for trading. I guess so that null blocs can make up for the lost income due to no local.
---
Hey it's not the prey's fault they got caught and chewed up, the predator decided to pounce.
---
That said, complaining about the law of the jungle won't help them.
---
I think i know your app. But still, link it pls.
---
Pay for one account then plex until you can extract the other. You can run DED sites which are comple trash isk per hour but are super fun to do. It probably amounts to a vni ratting income, 40 mil an hour.
---
Pandemic Horde be smugging right now.
---
No she doesn't. There's literally same isk left in game before and after any kill. Actually, there's even more isk, because insurance.
---
What's your alpha? I'm curious, cause I use a very tanky ceptor to move stuff from hisec every so often
---
You think it makes sense to be able to see all the recent kills in every system or wormhole at any time, and somehow think that your mocking makes *more* sense?
---
I'm not even sure how to answer that except to say you're a fucking moron.
---
Shhhhh don't ask questions

---
https://auth.pleaseignore.com/hr/application/59146/

so your interpretation of "rules change" is CCP should make it impossible for you to filter the spies out when they apply to your corp?
---
Less warning for the miners, can't see catalysts on dscan/landing from warp? That's about all I've got.
---
Spy.
---
&gt;requires zero alts subbed.
---
other than the nyx pilot itself which you have to sub unlike the current vni/myrm/domi bots that you can fly as an alpha
---
what if that gate is the one you came through into a pocket system? Are you gonna just do laps around the system to entertain yourself with this new "emergent" game play till it turns back on? The average player is going to say fuck it and log off.
---
Do* if*
---
It was autocorrect I'd suspect.

You missed my point completely. Go ahead and do it all day if you want. But you are here bragging about how it makes you elite. It doesn't, you are a coward. Own that.
---
Pre nerf my own vni got 30mil ticks, which is 90 per hour.
---
Can you explain how antimatter does damage? Tungsten or iridium have mass which generates energy but antimatter is massless.

it only helps you against ecm, also makes you harder to combat probe down as a side effect

AAR: we spotted a Hel and a Nyx running anomalys in the same system and managed to tackle the nyx with our legions. The Hel decided to be a hero and warp to his friend in need and another nyx cyno'd in a bit later.
---
Because checking ranges on dotlan is hard our dreads came in after the Hel already exploded and gotg/dedco/sortsarmyofautists then dropped caps on our shit. With too many enemy dreads on grid our initial group peaced out leaving our legions to defang fighters while tau called putin to bring his allies from china. 
---
We managed to hold grid against the carriers and keep their capitals tackled but the supers managed to escape. Then our backup arrived and capitals got deleted.

Next step should be to strip concord comms at random timing in random high sec systems for a finite period... jel drops concord response for 48 hours... or jita... or hek.. or all 3... effectively changing them to null for the predetermined period of time.

Let's ensure highsec has an opportunity to partake in the chaos as well! 🤘🏼

Looking to getting back into EVE fully. What is the current meta? I used to do mining and exploration with some ratting and running the missions (still low rank IIRC). What would be my best bet here?

It's a bit far fetched but you might check the "dynamic camera movement" option in the graphics settings.

dont do the whole edgy "IM EBUL CAPSULEUHR VILLAIN" trope either, let your character have its own weaknesses and strengths. your starting empire doesn't matter much to that end, each one is its own shade of grey.
---
eve is a game with depth, if you're going to rp don't have your character lack depth is what im saying you know
---
Voted fits idea has been done before by 3rd party tools and honestly it tends to lead to failures more than successes, mostly because the people voting on fits are the people that need others to make fits for them, they tend to be the least qualified in well judging good from the bad fits.
---
Well if you are smartbombing goonie goons 👍
---
Maybe he deleted it.
---
This won’t affect your play style, but it will affect many others. EVE players fall in to the trap of thinking everyone plays the game the same way as them.
---
I’m fully in support of this as one of the people it impacts (small gang blops). All of that aside, changing the meta game helps keep it fresh.
---
Fuck Yonis
---
Yeah i LOLed too.
---
Also, TIL that jump clones, deathcloning and wormholes aren't a thing, and you can't totally leave a system without using a gate, let alone doing any of the myriad things you can do in any system.
---
Sure, 1 Maulus Navy as all camps should have, 2 meme SB alts on the outgate. Now add DPS, as many and as weird as you like. Throw in a logi why not. Throw in a meme alt to resebo the Maulus. Done
---
I belive they want people to quit the game.
---
Maybe not fully destructable but hackable, hack to turn off and turn on.
---
It's not a problem for me because I can afford jump clones. And wormholes are a thing. And deathcloning.
---
2400 per ship most likely
---
And I’m not. It’s easier than ever for larger coalitions to defend their space with instant intel projected from Corp ESIs and jump bridges. The game needs mechanisms that allow people to attack mega coalitions that over extended, not just gimmicks like deleting local . Underneath all this hype about the local blackout eve is still very much broken in these regards.

---
It sorta makes sense. Higher subscription numbers and higher chance that you'll keep both accounts subscribing/plexing once you've incorporated the other account(s) into your playstyle (for example while mining or running solo fleet abyssals).

Rarely do I need more than one account training at the same time. And once it done, I'm not out any use.

Valerie, the scourge of O3-, tricked it into a bait fleet and warped onto our siege astra. Predditors rage formed dictors but it bumped hard and we had a moment of panic before we managed to secure it with enough bubbles to hold it until the dread bomb arrived. Now it's a brawl, still ongoing.

Maybe eve needs a fresh set of players to avoid further stagnation.

THere are copy cats of you squizz that will not be delaying the kill mails though :( .  Unless CCP implements this other copycats of you will just have the killmails posted on non delayed sites.

You really, *really* want that oversized AB? You realize that's a battleship AB? This fit seems to be trying a shield version of the late lamented null anom VNI,

but the problem is that the Vexor does not have *nearly* enough power grid. Note the use of the *large* cap battery on the VNI: cap batteries are typically found on PVE fits, and typically oversized. You use them to do things like fit BS ABs on glass cannons.
---
So, you can't really do what you're trying to do here, which is to get the DPS and speed tank of a faction cruiser (that was so OP that it got nerfed) on a normal T1 cruiser. However, if you are bold and insist upon this approach, you could try
---
The cap lasts 3:45 (v. cap stable on the old VNI), the EHP is 13.6k (about like your shield attempt) and the DPS is 184 which might not be enough to break the tank of the rats.
---
Or, you could use a BC. Because that's what people do for L3s.

Yup. Neither have the items 😩

What I always thought was a fun idea is if highsec could become lowsec for a bit - Due to large drifter/sansha invluence concord has directed its forces to deal with the threat as of now "insert highsec system name here" is temperly  considered a lowsec system until the threat has been dealt with. Thought this would be fun to shake things up

What if you’re in a ship you don’t want to lose, that has no probes, and there are no friendly structures in system?

How I would do it is make it security dependant: 
---
* Hisec; a few region gates would go down. 
---
* Lowsec; a few region gates would go down, but also a few constellation gates within each region.
---
* Nullsec; a few region gates, a few constellation gates in each region, and a few system gates in each constellation.
---
This kind of thing can be more hurtful in Hisec due to the higher quantity of new players, and the difficulty in moving around using cynos. Keeping it to a minimum there is the best option.
---
It must be terrible for frat to have this happen in their own staging system. Thoughts and prayers

Please have a bit more relaxed attitude (everyone).

Id remove the option to thumbs down, and just give the ability to thumbs up, then if you die you either give a GF in local / thumbs up or you just go on about your day.

If you give eve players a metric and way to neg each other their gona do it every single time even if they had fun, just look how peple on reddit talk to each other when someone posts something they dont agree with.
---
:thinking:
---
Isolated no, but create detours for awhile yes.
---
Or we could go full Clear Skies 3 and do have the Trigs isolate a staging system as part of their incursions with the only way to get there via wormholes.
---
How about an extra sensor debuff from cynos as well?
---
They whored on the kill (and so did their ally Elo), so it's a wash XD

No, there has never been such a site. There are sites, but for the reason mentioned by /u/deathzor42 they have always sucked.

For solo PVP

1. Look at zkill for somebody who has lots of solo wins in the ship you want to fit.

2. Look at that guy's losses in the ship you want to fit.

For fleet PVP? Your corp does not have fits? Find one that does?

For PVE? Eve Uni web site, the article on the ship you want to fit should have *something*, good at least for a basis.

Nobody is locked in one system for long as long as wormholes keep popping up. And jump clones are a thing.

Try undocking and docking up again to force a session change and check to see if the contracts went up

But I think the most important question about this hypothetical situation, is why would you log off in space if you're not already equipped for stealthy J/Nulldiving? Presumably these gate malfunctions would happen on daily down-time, so unless you somehow missed all the warnings in the hour leading up to it you would be prepared to ride it out in a friendly station.
---
Snuffed Out makes the most stimulating pvp video. Thank you for the thread.
---
&gt;A noob friendly starter fit such as their WTM standard Maelstrom fit costs 200mil isk and will earn you around 100 - 120 mil isk per hour.
---
The starter Rokh is 150Mn.
---
Because I have not always been a wormholer, and unlike some of us I don’t have a superiority complex.
---
Amazing
---
BombersBar is always fun. Join them.
---
Not that I know of. All the big alliances require x paps per month.  The alliances have requirements of the corps themselves otherwise they can get kicked, and is why the corps require whatever paps they require. It is participation that makes the game go round...
---
Arr there some corps that can be bought for isk...probably.  I wouldnt want to be in any of those
---
send hundreds of tickets until those fucks finally fix their shit
---
Nice shit!
---
It would not make it meaningless, if it's only counted when both parties agree it was a good fight, so if the killer says GF, and then the loser says GF, or in this example if they both hit a thumb up then count it, if only one of them selects GF/thumb up then don't count it.
---
And how are you going to deal with people who would abuse this reputation thing?
---
what a fuuuuucking idiots
---
look at that guy, can't even control his mouth.. probably on drugs lmao
---
It would, of course, be the Chinese that copy Zkill and make it their own.
---
yeah it seems totally realistic to have lines of comms which are THAT effective when we already monitor tons of shit in real time...in 2019.
---
I will echo the sentiment above that CCP should be the entity making a meta for this, especially when it seems like an obvious mode for more content creation. Like why not make comms ships/skilling a thing in-game? Comms jammers? There are really quite a lot of directions you can go with this  concept and CCP did none of them.
---
in factory
---
Pressure leaks, heavy use of aerobraking maneuvers over oxygen-rich worlds, or getting too close to icy asteroids while mining. But I read that the rust color Minmatar ships sport is actually caused by a certain material composition common to the metals in their territory, rather than actual rust.
---
In _general_, breaking the NDA would get you booted from the CSM, and perma-banned. It's a breach of contract, so CCP could possibly take it further than that, though the costs involved would curtail that to the worst of offences. 
---
A code of conduct breach can also get you booted.
---
You're absolutely right about the NDA. Players are very very bad at hearing "we're thinking about X" and understanding that to mean "X is coming soon." (CCP have also historically been bad at expectation management.) The NDA helps there.
---
Props on recording, it's real cleanly done. Good hunting!
---
At least it died in battle.... This died in a dumpster
---
at some training time X it is cheaper to;  
---
- train X months on a new alt and then pay for a character transfer to you main account to keep it omega permanently.  
---
- than it is to use MCT for X months on you main account.
---
They are, and i don't have the patience for setting up traps myself.
---
I get the argument you're making. Historically, no empire has never been more than about a year across - however much ground a message could cross and still have any impact. The people at the fringes didn't care what the capitol had to say. Maybe the lower the ADMs the longer it takes for the call to go out?
---
&gt;obey some rules
---
Imagine voluntarily allowing someone else to tell you how you're allowed to play a video game. What a fucking downer, dude.
---
That doesn't exist.
---
The Sabre would like to know your location
---
It almost never is a 1v1. His friends show up after they've been covert cyno'd in. Plus, you can only really talk about probes when you're talking about DED's. Some probers have the scan time down so far that you can scan, remove your probes, scan, etc. Other DED's just have bookmark locations sold to pirates, negating the need for probes, if you're buying DED's. 
---
Sure, if you can't handle a 1v1, something's wrong.
---
Can you handle a blopser squad?
---
Amarr.
---
Thank you for the the video, especially for the commentary and explanations. They are helpful for the novice pilots (e.g. me).
---
It's a *video game*, dude. If you're going to roll over and let other people tell you how you're allowed to play it then you're a complete fucking weakling.
---
Yeah that's basically what I said. You initially only said to remove thumbs down, now to make thumbs up do nothing unless mutual.
---
Even better, thanks.
---
I just went straight for maelstrom because minmatar is the one race my main never used
---
Gates randomly start working similar to wormholes and they enter a cool down state after x mass has been pushed through them. The mass and cool down can be affected by insert system active here ______.
---
        The opacity of all interactions with the CCP - the NDA agreement reliably binds languages ​​and hands to the whole ccm for several years.
---
 Yep. But it also means that CCP are willing to talk to us about things in advance, before anyone goes crazy about them. Doesn't always happen, but generally it does
---
        Annual election which is fully controlled by the CCP. I do not say that CCP cheats during the count, but they have such an opportunity.
---
Nice, accusing them of manipulating the vote, while giving yourself a "but I didn't!" escape.
---
        A direct lever of influence - the representative of the CSM can be thrown out at any time under the pretext of violating NDA, without evidence or explanation.
---
You know that CCP can boot people for no reason at all, right? Or just stop talking to us? 
---
        There is no reverse effect of CSM on the CCP - neither the veto nor other ways to impose the will of players, only advice for ccp, which can be ignored.
---
This will _never_ change. Thinking that is will or could, is somewhat naive. They're a business. We're just customers.
---
        The lack of the right to recall by the players 'their' representative at any time and re-election.
---
And how do you determine who someone's representative is, and who they have the right to recall? 
---
        the accelerated development and life time in eve relative to real life will not allow the use of representative democracy tools even when solving the above problems - this is the same as parliament would be elected for 20 years and would meet two weeks a year.
---
The CSM talks regularly with CCP. Not just the summits.
---
Still gunna get dread bombed mate

The fact that this sort of dishonorable behavior is allowed / encouraged blows my mind...

Fun Addendum:

The titan pilot warped back on grid in a muninn to get revenge and [got caught by the same guy again](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78225600/). Bob bless Fraternity, the memes must flow.
---
For the 2nd time this week.
---
Okay, I stand corrected. Carry on.
---
Frat is now holding a Vigil in remembrance of their mistake.
---
Goons went to delve, opened their doors to literally anyone and worked out that CCP changes allowed near-infinite characters to pve in a single region. The safety of doing this attracted a lot of pve players and any alts that people wanted to be safe. People have largely responded to this by avoiding goons and having fun without them.
---
NCPL withered, particularly PL. Horde expanded and is now pulling the reigns.
---
Various elitepvp groups became swole in their place (volta, Hard Knocks, skillu, snuff). Various nulleec incursions by these groups including skillu and pals driving russians out of the east.
---
They, along with Tri, PL, NC, BL, fraternity (more on them later), and various others tried to move on test, who by now were established in the south. It culminated in a big supercap fight during which test and friends matched their foes, and then with the help of goon camped their supers for a week with a manner keepstar.
---
Fraternity are largely the result of the influx of Chinese players from serenity (which was coincidental with a huge increase in botting) and they are currently skirmishing with test in the southeast.
---
Can't think of anyone else relevant.

Eaglefleet is out taking the SY- TCU and covering XiX to finish them saving all of their WC ihub timers. Valerie comes in and says he has a vanquisher tackled on the o3-4 astra. Tell everyone to start freeburning o3-4 (7 Jumps) immediately. Rageping dreads login, take jump bridge and cyno directly onto vanquisher. My alt in a hic is logged off there so its like a 1 minute turnaround. 2 Minutes later first dreads are cyno'ing in, we end up dropping about 100 total. Drag bubbles are being put up and a muninn fleet is maneuvering around them and coming in to clear dictors as the first 30-40 dreads are in. They cant clear dictors well on an astra when they can be tethered, bubble and dock. More dreads, more dreads. 1 apostle warps in. Titan dies. 
---
Now have 100 dreads on an instawarp off enemy keepstar. Enemy turns on cynojammer. My small eaglefleet comes in. We warp up and start buying time for the dreads to clear bubbles and jump out. 1 dread dies before we get there. We start brawling, Elo has limited logi so we clear that first and then start in on muninns, we have FAX reps so its less useful for them and they work on eagles. Being their staging system they just reship as they die. Down to final 50 eagles we perch out for a few minutes while reinforcements arrive. Enemy shoots our Minokawa's but cant break them. Reinforcements arrive, we warp back in. Trading favorably, someone gets a good boosh off, trading favorably. Enemy warps off, then warps down to the gate where our reinforcements are coming in from, we fight again, trade even more favorably now. 
---
Enemy muninn fleet docks, we warp down and clear all wrecks, all caps and subs extract.

Actually antimatter has the same mass as normal matter, the difference between them is the opposite electrical charge of the particles (electron-positron, proton-antiproton).

Calm down son

&gt;see if he can deliver you some probes and a mobile depot, and hope you get lucky in J-Space. Or a friend who can light a cyno for you, or a friend who can bridge you back out with him.
---
All these things involve that friend being able to get into the system after you are already stuck, I don't like the chances of magically finding a wh to the place you got stuck and unless you are hunting for a fleet why would you have a cyno?
---
Blow up their jump gates, jump gates themselves don't seem to be that expensive. Also wormholes.
---
I wouldn't take bets on the chances you find a WH in the pocket you stuck in AND that you decided to bring along a probes and a launcher.
---
good, every faction titan that dies makes the game a little less retarded. Hopefully they'll buy something useful next time.

Frat has actually been spamming CCP with tickets to try and get it to stop. That is their solution.

if you can't switch fleets in 10 minutes the problem is a bit deeper

Doesn't change that you have to include an explanation for the effects that said wars have on your data set in your analysis.

Well, you don’t have 10 minutes. You have 1, because you can’t light a cyno and switch fleets and have them jump to you.

Very cool. Ty for this.

Kinda forgot, pings to kill a super do that to ya.... No cars were hurt in the making of this comment
---
All alliance fleet doctrines should be SRPed. At least every alliance I’ve been in. Sometimes logi get over 100% SRP even
---
I'd recommend only scooping the bioadaptive cache as it has the most loot. But if you really want to scoop all the cans you can use a mobile tractor unit. You just drop it in the middle of the site, shoot all the cans, wait a bit and then scoop the mtu with all the loot.
---
Well did u kill the super?

...and to rub salt in they were buying our scam contracts when they were reshipping.

My entire kb would be a giant sadface

Sadly no, #UmbrellasKillContent

We forgot the cyno inhib
---
It's just like in Wormhole space: You won't appear in local until you write something.
---
a joke my racist uncle would make.
---
OK, we can keep that data, but what about the system monitoring stuff? what about universally available killboards? you don't need to go the point of entirely deleting ESI, just getting rid of free intel.
---
I can handle everything null sec has to offer. That’s why I’m there. Listen... everyone in null is putting in risk, the fact that you think you should be super safe and risk free is absurd. Blops are rare. 1v1 is a lot more common. Try baiting. Try working with your corp mates. Do something rather than complaining. 
---
Dscan or don’t. I don’t give a shit. We all know it helps. But if you prefer to fly blind than you’ll learn real damn quick this game isn’t for you.
---
Miner, stay calm.
---
You're in a NullBloc and they don't SRP doctrine ships?
---
Yeah I thought that but that can be dangerous if a  hostile cyno goes up right as the inhib onlines
---
Well shit, looks like I'm going to start delaying loading ads by two hours as well.

'I just commented to show people that I too am a part of the Eve is dying movement'
---
Can we go back to no warping to 0? Maybe buff the tank of the non-cloaky haulers a little bit to give them a chance against suicide ganks, but the change to enable warp to 0 was probably the single largest eliminator of content in the game.
---
Perhaps PH is just a shit alliance to be part of?
---
may i ask why?
---
It's Bob's will
---
Yes. I've heard as much.
---
Dunno about the other guys but Brave has SRP for all ship classes.
---
To answer your question directly
---
* It's impossible to overstate the value of knowledge and experience in a large alliance to new players in a game this dense with information. The majority of members in the very first high sec corp I joined didn't know what sig radius did or what it was. 
---
* Generally superior isk/hr opportunities although the blackout is altering this. Even now most of these alliances have public moons with R16s or better on them. Even if you just mine in a venture, do you want to do that without boosts or compression on Omber in high sec? Going back to my first point, the required level of info to know what to mine and how to mine it best isn't as widely available as most veterans assume it is.
---
* Quality, low risk experience. If you've never been in a mid or large sized fleet, things like anchoring, flagging exempt, etc... are alien concepts to you. What about booshing? What about broadcasting for reps, primaries, and overheating? All of this is stuff you can pick up in one or two null subcap fleets from knowledgable FCs and fellow pilots.
---
This is to say nothing of active markets, expansive infrastructure, IT services, and a host of other things 99% of new players don't know exist or the value of. Perhaps most useful of all, being part of a large community helps you integrate into and understand the game's culture in a way that reading about it just doesn't. Even if you have a rotten experience in a major null alliance you can walk away thinking "I liked this, this, and this, but I hated this and this. I know what I'm looking for now." Brave, horde, karma, etc... aren't for everyone but they give you a chance to get on your feet, get some knowledge and resources, and give you a head start into other ways to play the game.
---
you can't? you can switch fleets without any issue with a cyno lit... unless its a jump drive limitation, but that's the first time i've heard of it
---
the intel stuff works through chat logs which get saved locallly on your computer not esi. zkill does work through esi.
---
Horde is the exception for not fully reimbursing doctrine ships.
---
Goonswarm generally reimburses at higher than market prices for Stratops so if you lose a ship on alliance fleets you make money.
---
Ex. You lose a ferox on Alliance fleet, you get your insurance payout of net 21 million, and alliance pays you 100 million isk. If you bought the ferox and fit for less than 121 million, you made money on dying for the alliance.
---
There is no snuff video without the rusboi calling you fucking retard :D
---
Yeah all near2 like tools are cancer, obviously if they updated the Eula it wouldn’t be specifically targeting near2, it would be worded to ban that type of program
---
there's no way a super wouldn't kill the inhib before it onlines with half decent skills, but yeah there's really no reason not to light the cyno if an inhib was dropped and you were tackled
---
Then you are doing it wrong i do PI with all my three chars and two of them make 25 million of P3 a day each. The third one does P2, about the same amount so that comes to 75 mil a day and 2.25 bil a month.
---
Apply to them and wait few weeks for them to accept you. While you wait in their broken queue.
---
what the actual fuck
---
... how exactly is that going to help the situation?
---
I fly a cheapo Heron with dual sebos. Like blow me up fam, I don't care. I have a better time exploring without the paranoia. When I don't have a good time is when I fuck up the hack when I'm just a few clicks away from unlocking it and blow it up.
---
Yeah assuming it’s dropped at 0, but having to boat fighters over possibly 100km and maybe you’re a retarded krab in goons who only notices after 30s. 
---
Krabs die when they think for themselves 😉
---
The Merlin would like to know the Sabres location.
---
Nah, fighters just cant track anything cruiser down very well at all despite all the crying about it you fucmung retards do lmao
---
who's asian?
---
he ain't mad, he's right
---
I've *only* got 10k each days. No 25k, no 50k.
---
It sucks.
---
So it works like this:
---
In fleet A, light cyno. 
---
Fleet A can jump to you 
---
Leave fleet A
---
Join fleet B
---
Fleet B can’t jump to you
---
Try to rejoin fleet A
---
Fleet A can’t jump to you either
---
Thanks I just use Shadowplay which is a feature of most modern nvidia cards so it loops 10 mins constantly and i just hit a hotkey to save the last 10 minutes.
---
I don't understand how so many morons think changing rorqs to fighter UI fixes anything. You literally press F1 instead of F and your drones now mine... WHAT IS THE CHANGE? Literally nothing. So many brain dead people. Fighter mechanics are incredibly simple and easy, carrier ratting only requires high apm because targets die fast and you have to constantly switch.  
---
If you genuinely want to fix rorqs, remove panic, change excavs to "capital mining lasers"

they are now carriers that can be killed under umbrellas.

You're welcome.

Horde...  The srp is just one of the many reasons they are a joke.
---
For the time I've spend on my awox alts I've noticed that horde has to be bad for retaining actual new players.  So many fresh faces I've seen that joined because 'join horde' and then just get frustrated and quit from the bullshit and lack of support.
---
I didn't down vote I like the basic premise
---
In goons you get a shitton of sp
---
oh sweet summer child, this shit has been going on for years now, they are not planning to fix it. ever...
---
Did not know character transfers are a  thing.
---
Why is there ANY PVE?  Eliminate all PVE and you eliminate the bots.  All nul sec would have to actually BUY IRL to play the game.
---
There in no alliance that compares to goons when it comes to giving stuff to people. At least any alliance I've been in.
---
"yo our guys are fucking retarded can you please fix ccpls"
---
What type of alliance is dsml
---
And what do yall need
---
It's immoral to fly in ships that are this ugly.
---
No shit sherlock
---
Current null block economic backbones are around taxes in trade hubs and ratting taxes.  The more things that die is a benefit to the organization as a whole since they reap the benefit of the taxes on everything sold locally.  You are simply meat in the grinder that feeds the machine.  Various null blocks create a spin or narrative that gets people to fight or makes them look better than another block or simply to hide something from outside view.  While more expensive doctrines may hinder new players from joining with said doctrine it is actually of benefit to the alliance as a whole to simply lose more expensive ships to in turn feed the market and generate new revenue from taxes.  In a case where no SRP is available that is just a win win for the host organization who not only benefits from your fleet participation, forces you to rat or other activities they may benefit from, and when you replace it benefits from the taxes when sold.  When you look at the MER in some cases entire fleet loses are not even noticeable in the larger picture due to ratting and trade taxes levied.  Hate to be the guy pulling the wool from over your eyes here, but this is reality, just most people refuse to see it.  Stop helping someone build wealth and get out there and build your own, and hopefully make some friends along the way.

Wormholer btw

I feel like this is some roundabout way of bergmann announcing they do invasions.

wait, are you trying to tell me that \*squints\*  [BGJHKK Sasen](https://zkillboard.com/character/2115510754/) is not a real human player?
---
pretty fucked up, tbh
---
That is legit dumb as fuck and so is your reasoning
---
If the person in question is using a script to automatically send fleet invites. Then yes this is not acceptable!
---
NS gives you plenty of easy isk making opportunities, lots of group activities and plenty of guides, information and knowledge for new players.
---
The downsides (from my pov) are that you'll be LineMember#637184, you won't know why you are doing all those StratOps 95% of the time and that you usually have some kind of participation requeriments.
---
I've always enjoyed closer and smaller groups.
---
[And here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/clyzz8/frat_vanquisher_down_in_o3/), not even a week later a guy in an expensive ship, getting shit from every direction, this is the exact reason people are reluctant to fly those in PvP... and why they "jerk themselves over their pile of money the'll never use"
---
Your spouting shit mate. New bro ships are free, just ask for a new one. All other strat-op ships are SRPed! 
---
Other fleets are on a FC basis, join a 100% fleet all logi and dics and command dessis are srped by choosh.
---
If it is a structure bash it is almost definitely all srped. No one is in ph for that though, it is a necessary evil. I am in ph because we have constant fleets and content, because pvp comes to us, because i enjoye teaching newbros, because when I use big toys I know if I do my job right i will be saved, and if i can't i will be treated right.
---
If all you are doing is joining fleets and hitting f1 with out socialising or taking any responsibility then your going to get pretty bored. Take some responsibility, give your self a reason to fight. Make sure your talking to your peers!! Being social makes eve what it is.

Is there a way to help the developer of that website, or help pay the server fees?
---
PH reimburses ships on strat ops. They just don't do it for non-strat op stuff like defense fleets, since most defense fleets are like corms or something and not 100% necessary to even have.
---
How dare you accuse Fraternity of botting! Sort is going to ban SPVG from ever joining GOTG and label you a RACIST!

They are just very dedicated ratters, OKAY!?

correct it would be entirely unacceptable. hint: he isnt using a script. also: i think that would be super hard to make (someone undocks offer them fleet invite?)

How was skill used for political reasons? I haven’t heard that before and you got my interest.

Karmafleet specifically has alliance SRP then a separate Corp one so even most logi ships are break even

---
Some dork named Maded Fish took over and it went to hell. All of the old FCs left, he created a new channel and new discord and blah blah blah pubbie fleet drama.

If you can get over all that, they still run fleets from "SF Spectre Fleet" in game.
---
They got ghosted

That's not what I'm saying at all. Discussion is good. I'm pointing the finger at people that are saying stupid shit like "I'm GONNA GO TO ANOTHER KILLBOARD, ZKILL IS DEAD TO ME BECAUSE OF THIS" If you're not smart enough to realize there is a difference between discussion of an issue and entitlement towards an issue, then this is a very pointless conversation.
---
I've seen actual players with names just as stupid.
---
I like the clean cut simplicity of it. Very nice!

Insider information: We can't even fuel our jump gates properly
---
Side note, what ever happened to the Valhalla project as well? They where the biggest incursion community and where running 24/7. Now their channel is a ghost town...
---
In other news Kibinai are fucking amazing.
---
This was years ago, but when I interviewed Squizz back in 2014/2015 about the tech behind zkill for my gaming news site he was barely making a dent with ad income if I recall correctly.
---
&gt; All other strat-op ships are SRPed! 
---
Perhaps the info on [the website](https://www.pandemic-horde.org/srp/explained) is just outdated then? The list of hulls is definitely far from complete as far as current doctrines go. As far as I remember the fleet-specific info on SRP was usually only logi (you could be right on dics and command dessis tho).
---
&gt; give your self a reason to fight. 
---
When costs are reasonable and the fights are good it can be fun to fight, sometimes; outside of that it seems that a good reason to fight would be that you actually benefit from the alliance doing well. I can't really see how that's the case so that's why I am asking.
---
If they post their kills it bypasses the 2 hours, no?
---
It is mostly a few people doing the fleet invites. Frat keeps reporting them for spam and harassment, neither of which is the case. I guess Frat thinks if they can get the invite folks banned they can make the deaths stop?
---
It does, but not everyone is going to post their kills manually.
---
lol let it go. he was an idiot that accepted an enemy fleet invite and let himself get warped off. He earned that Darwin award
---
They tried to invade Provi and were defeated by a couple of stern Reddit posts.
---
Who?
---
well, thats just wrong.
---
What is input broadcasting?  (Asking for a friend)
---
Ah, so umm not to sound ungrateful, because I am. But that's going to take me at least a month to save up for that fit, for a fleet I maybe can get into for some of the time I can play.  Sounds like great money for short periods. I'm not sure it's a way to go right now. Definitely good for an alt when the price of the fit doesn't represent   so much for a maybe.
---
&gt;I don't trade at TTT

I think you might be the last person in the world that has any right to get indignant or pissy about trust given recent taxation events.
---
This is completely wrong and you know it
---
spi
---
It kind of stands to reason that if you're too lazy to go to zkill to post your kill manually, you're probably too lazy to go look at the BR within the first two hours of it being live anyway?

Oh no, what about the remaining 3rd party developers that put a lot of their free time in developing these tools. All 5 of them! :((((((

Russia and China disagree.

I know... OP saying how awesome HK is, killing all that shit.... Empty ships... Not very 'leet

Poor Elo's doing so badly he needs to whore on his own dying caps to feel better.

This is not a surprise, we've known for a while that NPC miners only try one warp if it fails they give up and go idle.

Ever met the infamous MisterBlister TheSisterFister?

Oh pretty sure OP got evicted by beans lol
---
The Valhalla Program is a program that was around briefly 3 years ago to try and encourage more people to step up and FC. It didn't work.
---
All Logi, mainline dps ships, and others are SRP'd for fleet ops. Newbean ships are free from the NBI.
---
Spectre Fleet remains very popular.  This weekend saw a bunch of fleets go out with lots of green.
---
The declaration of war on Provi... the mentioned posts seemed to stop promptly.  Injecting politics into NPSI was obv going to break the NPSI concept.  Not sure why it settled so quickly but glad that it did.
---
like /u/phoenix_iv said, antimatter isn't massless. But on top of that, when antimatter comes into contact with regular matter both particles annihilate which is destructive, producing energy which can also be destructive.

---
Hi, I am one of the three people in Spectre's high command. We're still active every day, running the same old #randomgarbage kind of fleets on a daily basis. Generally speaking we have 1-3 fleets going out a day, depending on the day.
---
We had a few hurdles to overcome. Jayne quit EVE and didn't really cooperate with us, so we had to restructure with a new discord and ingame channel (SF Spectre Fleet).
---
'We' also decided to start a sort of yolo-campaign against provi to have some new/different content going on. Since I personally didn't have the time to run said war, some rando dude that had no experience with SF was pulled in to lead said campaign, and after 1-2 gank/mistakes, said person dropped the ball, and progress halted.
---
EVE's changed, and SF along with it, but we're still running a lot of the similar same old bs with a lot of new and old faces still around. Just not a lot of news-worthy things going on for SF.
---
loled, ngl
---
The new channels/discord had to happen. Jayne quit EVE out of the blue and didn't hand over ownership of anything, which was a bit of a gay move.
---
Its never 1v1 unless its a VNI or Covetor. Its always 1v10+ and the less counterplay for the 1... the better... just super rat from now on only allowed form of PVE.
---
i logged in to find that chat would get populated by a few people per seconds and every .5-7 seconds it would reset. after jumping a few jumps local kept changing between the first and second system i was in.
---
TLDR: Someone decided to start said war, and since I didn't have the time to run it myself, said person brought a complete stranger on board to run said war, who turned out to be a tool, so the whole effort got decapitated pretty quickly.
---
I'm going to meme out some fights in provi over fun timers and the like, but the full-on-war concept was dumb from the start. Ah well.
---
&gt;Are there perhaps big advantages that line members of these organizations get that I don't know about, perhaps inherent to being able to live in nullsec with logistics and citadels taken care of?
---
Pretty much, yeah. Your average line member cares as much about the alliance as the alliance cares about them: They don't. Large alliances provide the infrastructure to earn ISK and occasional gudfites and they're a good place for people that haven't yet learned how to find content on their own.
---
&gt;Or is this a place where new players go until they smarten up and go to an alliance with more complete SRP coverage for example such that you actually have a good reason to defend the sources of income of your alliance?
---
People (the ones who don't just quit EVE or become complete app champs) usually leave large alliances either for small or mid-size alliances where people actually give a shit, or they make a few friends who come up with the idea to make their own corp over a few beers and leave to try to do that.
---
&gt;Or do people just enjoy structure bashing so much they happily lose their shit over it, which (for a new player) may take many hours to earn back?
---
Meh, some people want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, even if their "leadership" considers them completely disposable.
---
I don't want to sound like joining a big alliance isn't something new players should do, they can offer a lot of good infrastructure and education for newbros to help get them through the brick wall that is the first six to nine months of EVE. But I wouldn't say large alliances are something you should feel the need to commit to and "be a part of", largely because unless you're truly exceptional the people who make the actual decisions don't know and don't care who you are. They're neat places to start out and gain a foothold, but they aren't the be-all-end-all of EVE.
---
I'd forgotten MTUs existed. Thanks!
---
I also didn't know that the bioadaptive cache was consistently the most valuable can
---
Lol I love how people say noobs should go rat in null cause they will make so much isk the only thing that happens to a noob in null is they lose lots of spendy ships
---
Just quit while your ahead... shit game...
---
It's a video game, my dude.
---
The name really just says it all, doesn't it?
---
Make Concord/faction police killable. Players clear highsec system of police and it becomes a lowsec system. The farther back you push police forces the stronger they become. They can also take lowsec systems and turn it into high. Make it work like invasions. Fuck let's throw null into the mix and allow lowsec systems to be turned into npc null under the same system. The low/bull systems nobody lives in will get purged. And the areas players live in will push for more low/null space.
---
We used to have this, it was called "traffic delay"...

---
I think you misunderstood what I meant. What I was saying was people probably aren’t willing to wait 2 hours to see **others** kills. Obviously, if they want to post their own they can do that.
---
So you want to change to a democracy
---
Where people vote with plex
---
When the average eve player has a few bil tops but the top top have tens of trillions....
---
You have some decent ideas but this is an awful solution with no forethought (which ironically fits most of the “ideas” ccp listens to)... but without one side of a coin you don’t even have half a cent
---
Loss of wealth is not the same as an isk sink.
---
You could probably make a screenreader that autoclicked on cap+ brackets, but wow would that be obvious to anticheat
---
Hey, I run a lot of dark frig abyssals, and hookbills are a great way to go! However, your fit needs a bit of tweaking. First of all, frigates in darks are conventionally speed tanked, so I'd swap that ab for a 5mn mwd, and swap 1 or 2 of your rigs to an aux thruster rig. Next, since you are speed tanking, take out the hardeners and swap it for one shield repper that you can use for healing any odd damage you take. Then, I'd use the remaining slots for cap modules so you can stay cap stable with your mwd running. That's about it, and feel free to tweak it a little bit if you want to. Also, remember to check your missile skills and see if you want to improve them at all. I'd reccomend around 200 total dps for a t2, and about 250~300 for a t3. o7
---
You really should do this dude, make some content
---
It balances out Reddit and the vocal minority here.  Null has more players than the rest of eve now.  Good or bad, that’s now it is.
---
That’s because there’s high security ONLY until you realize you can’t truly counter gankers... so you become one, never undock to station trade, or join null
---
Wormholes don’t have the resources to support large groups, and that’s why they have so much less... which is scary because making null into that will be detrimental to growth.  You can’t take a fish from the ocean and place it in a goldfish bowl expecting it to grow into anything massive, after all
---
Expanding on this. 
---
Remove supers and rorqs from low, and remove orcas from high. Make lowsec a true middle ground again cuz not everyone wants to pvp in fw or null.
---
My bad then. Saw 0 and your comment very soon after mine, so figured it was from you.
---
You use software so that you can press one button and have that command input on every EVE client you have open. Makes it much easier to control a large number of accounts and is not allowed in EVE.
---
Counterplay: Using DScan and bouncing instead of warping to zero.
---
Your acting like there isn't any counter at all to this. There is.
---
How dare you fuckers have an adult conversation a d be reasonable! What kind of platform do you think you're on! This is reddit, I demand bickering!

Not really, just an idiot with a big irl wallet feeding everyone content.

I doubt he’s costing the alliance much of anything

Not down playing your ability to FC, you're pretty fucking amazing. But where has PGL been? Seems like you have alot to do by yourself.

Two hours with someone who knows what they are doing and you would be fine , it takes a little bit of time to train but you need to be done with those 3 months of training first, command center upgrades to 5 interplanetary consolidation to 5   It is a lot of training but it is like the relic thing , worth it In the end.

You mean my dead end ratting system could be completely closed off? I think I hear money being printed...
---
Shh don't tell him.
---
No problem, I've been told in another place I recommended this that the starter rohk fit is only 150 mil so 25% less.
---
Still you are right, that initial isk to buy the fit is the hardest.
---
Id recommend exploration for that bit.
---
As for waiting to get in, maybe it's just the timeslot I play but I never have to wait long to get in.
---
This probably is best as an alt char's sole purpose though in the end.
---
Yeah Jaguars are faceroll against any ship that doesnt have a range bonus to webs/neuts. Halfway good jag fits/pilots can easily tank a full Rapid light clip and just ram into the ship to hold it down until the blob arrives.
---
Just not cool man. 😢
---
Do they see the contents of the mails and chat windows or just who you were in them with?
---
tf happened to jayne
---
It's harder to gank, but more valuable to do so. In highsec you can fairly easily trigger CONCORD to a grid just by shooting an alt in a corvette, and they'll hang around for two hours and almost instantly vaporise anyone who tries to shoot you.
---
they do it to everyone not just caps and since people that get warped all die its pretty obvious that there are people at the screens to do the killing
---
&gt; How do we get there from newbro to isk capitalist in a way that is fun...
---
I mean I too have station traded in the past. I didn't find it terribly fun.
---
I like how you had to mention your "awoxing alts" like it's an achievement or something
---
Some thoughts based on my experience the past few weeks with Blackout:
---
**Cynos/Cyno Inhibs**
---
- Cyno inhibs are largely useless. Any target will light their cyno before the inhib goes online. If inhib onlines without target cyno'ing, they will warp in a cyno ship at range to bring in the umbrella.
---
- Allowing capitals to have cynos fit is a massive contributor to the strength of umbrellas. When you're lighting the cyno with a million EHP ship, you're far too safe. It allows your defense fleet to have an absurd amount of time to respond to you getting caught. Many Rorquals we've caught haven't had their cap support jump in for 3-4 minutes, which ensures that they can coordinate jumping in 10-40 caps at once, instead of frantically jumping in whatever they can.
---
----
---
My thoughts on citadels are largely based on my old playstyle of hunting for POSes in 2010-2014:
---
**Citadels**
---
* Essentially put an end to the constant churn of abandoned assets in space that could be recovered by explorers. Zkill data shows the drastic drop in SMA/CHA kills over the past few years. People that leave their shit abandoned in citadels never lose it, except in wormholes. Even then, the timers on these abandoned structures make them a pain in the ass.
---
* Timers on low-power structures shouldn't exist, and they should eject assets no matter what region of space. Give players a notification when they own assets in a structure that is low-power.
---
* Consider adding more tools to allow small groups or individual players to take advantage of abandoned/unmaintained structures. Possibly bring back the siphon as a tool for quietly sapping fuel out of structures to take them to low-power. Would need to be implemented to not appear on d-scan, so that they'd eventually drain truly neglected structures, but be less likely detected on accident (like the old POS siphons were).
---
Yeah I was surprised how much isk can be made in HS compared null.
---
Although ratters in null getting tackled provides 90% of non-alliance-stratops, so it would be a much quieter new Eden if people stopped krabbing
---
I honestly am wondering if we are playing the same game. 
---
Bombers already kill everything
---
Cynos are only as strong as what comes through them
---
Navigation structures can already be harrassed every day and shutdown until auto-repair
---
Citadel placement and force projection are a bigger issue than letting bashers have easier free kills
---
There's no reason to do anything small scale
---
Your entire spreadsheet looks like a one sided argument of "My pvp fun is important: buff it" yet does nothing to address how easy it is to escape a fight for the hunter. It does nothing to help the small group exist
---
If you really want balance in eve, then there needs to be a reason to do something solo, something in a small group, something in a large group, and all those somethings in highsec, low, null and WH. Pandering to only pvp players will continue to cause your content to dry up, unless you like fighting fortified null blocks.
---
Never played after the first MW... what does it mean? x)
---
since ccp hasnt changed the esi endpoints you havent taken away the information from the people using it to stagnate the game, you just made it more difficult for smaller entities to compete.  im sure the data you can collect will be interesting though.  ccplease change the end points.
---
what
---
I just lost braincells
---
No. He is implying that nothing should be done to fix this problem unless CCP fixes it. The reason being that other killboards will adapt and re-offer this functionality to effectively leave the status quo unchanged.
---
It is the logic they use to justify not having auto-detection of bots because they believe the result is "cat and mouse".

Exploration is still fine, though data sites might be in a worse state than before due to the devaluation of ancillary armor repairer blueprints and POS blueprints. Mining is a lot worse, since the majority of mining these days is performed by massive mining fleets in nullsec. Ratting and mission running are still fairly good. 
---
Recently, instanced pve in the form of Abyssal Deadspace was introduced, which focuses on single cruiser PvE or Frigate trios. It can be a lot more profitable than mission running, but it's also fairly dangerous and engaging. 
---
The ship meta is focused a lot more on Heavy Assault Cruisers and Assault Frigs due to a rebalance that improved their performance. Other ships are still fine for the most part. Capitals are very common and still a dominant force, though a nerf to carrier fighters has made them less oppressive.
---
I've been watching a lot of Frasier on Netflix lately...

---
Yes, you can refit off a mobile depot as long as you don't have an aggression timer. You do not get an aggression timer by being shot at, only by shooting another player or player structure.
---
It's really pretty much 1 Corp. We live in a wormhole and we need stuff like bombers, guardians, drones ammo lesheks. We're pretty varied with what we fly. But we bring in alot of mats and have facilitys to process them. And with 20+ guys we have enough people to where people are always on but your always you. Not just a number
---
HA
---
Learning implants should go the way of learning skills tbh. Accelerators are a superior mechanic in almost every way. Like you said, all that learning implants do is punish new players for being active in dangerous space.
---
Protip: Produce a gate to stain and he stops posting
---
Not enough koolaid
---
&gt;they should eject assets no matter what region of space
---
why, tho? in kspace historically assets were stored either in npc stations (lowsec, npc null) or outposts which couldnt be destroyed, do you have a good reason to change that?
---
Get this man some koolaid
---
So at least 5 players to counter a single module/effect. Not broken at all.
---
Here's a better idea... Let's get rid of Attributes entirely.
---
They're a bad idea from the start. Our "characters" are not even the main characters of the game. Our meatsuits have no bearing on the game whatsoever. They're just a vessel to store Skills in. We are literally brains in a jar, only they forgot to scoop out the brains so they put the whole body in a jar instead. There is no reason why our Perception or Charisma should have any effect on how quickly you accumulate Skill Points.
---
Furthermore, since the advent of Skill Injectors, they've shown that Skill Points are just brain juice you can suck out of anything and squirt into anything. There is no effect for draining your Mining skills and dumping the SP into your Gunnery. No gain or loss for spending SP on a skill that your Attributes may or may not be mapped for. The only thing Mapping affects is passive SP gain, any only by a small amount. SP Farmers just make sure to Map and Implant for the fastest gains in whatever skill(s) they're farming. And most players I know tend to fit a full set of Implants, and balance out their Mapping, so they can train whatever they want.
---
So... let's get rid of Attributes. And let's get rid of Learning Implants. We can keep all the other Implants around, obviously. But there won't be any more +1 or +5 when you fit Low Grade or High Grade. It'll just be 1% to Armor, or 5% to Shields. Since that's what most people care about for Implants anyway.
---
SP will accrue at a constant rate for Alphas, and twice as fast for Omegas. No variables, just 2 rates of steady SP.
---
Because historically the production of goods in EVE has **far** out-paced their destruction
---
Cant believe anyone who read this and found it helpful didn't say thank you. This is incredibly useful, thank you.
---
Wow thanks so much for the fits. Yea I use pyfa, probably spend more time in that than playing the game lol.
---
I've gotten myself a reasonably looking active armor 100mn ab fit that I think will do fine. It's got reasonable tank and about 270 dps so I think it's fine. 
---
Do I have any fits for battlecruisers? In this case the myridon? I've looked online and there basically isn't any fits for alphas...
---
“Random dude”.... you’re referring to Redline?
---
Hahhaha
---
You idiots didn’t listen to us when he left and we tried to warn you.
---
corrected in the summary.
---
Thanks. I popped in a little for the addition of the Triglavians but never understood it. I’ll have to give it a full look over.
---
Right. I guess I'll just stick to the fit we built together earlier that won't break my bank.
---
BTW u got any fits for gallente drone BC and BS?
---
You can try exploration. I've been playing for ~5-6 weeks, and I've made a few bill overall without doing any ratting, just from exploration, PI, and stuff like that.
---
Heart you
---
I think it is because they see that at least to some extent, limiting free intel is necessary. The removal of local woke them up.
---
Id be okay if titans could only track slow moving targets, if their damage was increased. I have a 60b isk ship that does less damage than a 2b isk battleship.
---
To be clear the vanq pilot joined the fake standing fleet of his own accord, no fleet invites were sent. When he undocked Val was ready with the squad warp.
---
Honestly this, the real rewards should come with greater risk.
---
What about removing attributes, removing learning implants, and introducing more accelerators to replace the massive ISK/LP sink you'd lose by removing that stuff. 
---
I'm sure we could get pretty creative with a new variety of temporary accelerators.
---
Weird I don't remember that
---
Yup, but it's easy to roll a new alt.
---
Yeah, but the Neutron Blasters should be very, very, very similar, but smaller than the Ion one
---
That's a lot of effort when you can just say delete capital ships.
---
My main concern with your balance is that, taken in from a wider lens, your ideas add up to Subs warp in and caps explode.
---
All of your "balance" is on the side of "Small ships should be able to swarm and destroy caps and moonwalk away from a response fleet". That's not balance; it's bias.
---
I don't deny there are aspects of caps (and especially Rorqs) that make them cancer to the game but what about BLOPS? If your goal is to make subs viable for both sides of the fight, then the ability to cloak and run needs to be nerfed as well. Make it so cloaks get a ten minute aggression cooldown when using an offensive mod or after jumping through a cyno. Now you gotta decide if you warp around until you can safe log, take the fight, or try to crash the gates. In any of those cases, you've committed to risking your fleet.
---
Now, I do agree with you about citadels being stupid to kill and asset safety. Personally, I'd make a low power citadel the same as an unfueled POS. If it's got no power, it goes boom in one setting. I'd also change full power strux to die within three days of the first RF. Maybe 5 days for L and 7 days for XL.
---
I also think you're being too light on stabs. At a minimum, they should disable all offensive output of your stabbed ship. No turrets or launchers able to fire, no combat/ewar drones launched, no ewar, etc. At that point, they'd only be viable on indy ships, where they belong. You could fit them for use in travel, but you'd have no defenses whatsoever when caught.
---
Asset safety should never ever be something you can just trigger when you want to. It should only be triggered when a structure is destroyed or unanchored. If unanchored, safety works as it does today. If it's destroyed, your assets should be given a 15% chance to drop into the loot pile and then face the already used RNG to determine if it is destroyed or dropped. (I get a lot more hate for this than I expected given it averages to the same monetary risk).
---
And if we're talking about balance as game mechanics and not just cap ships, there's no excuse for not hauling in injectors.. I know CCP needs the income from SP trading but they can sell items to boost training speeds from one to five times normal which will allow for catching up fairly quickly but not permit an instant capital pilot. SP trading is the biggest cancer in the game and quite frankly it's the reason so many more people are tooling around in caps, especially PVE caps.
---
Gila huh. That's a cruiser that can solo c3s? Do u have a fit for the c3 gilas?
---
   
---
can an example fit?
---
I've been replying the same to a lot of people asking this so I ended up making a post about it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/clxalw/how_to_get_the_best_start_in_eve_for_new_players
---
TL;DR - Incursions, and to be optimal you should run an alt dedicated to it. That sounds like a lot of hassle to set up but a very quick way to get it is thoroughly detailed in that post.
---
Well if it’s more than 1v1 you have to be an idiot to not notice them coming. Sorry you can’t rat for 5 hours with one eye on local and just dock up when anything shows up. That’s the version we had and it bred afk ratters and botters. You people are never happy.  You want all the rewards with no risk. Yet you’re the first ones to complain against high sec players who never leave. Hypocrisy at its finest.

At least make it an ISK sink x)

Thanks. Already have a combat char trained up and ready to go. I just need to figure what to do with my mining char.
---
Small gang/solo dude here
---
Quick points and things id like to see or discussed:
---
-citadels should need to siege to attack. Instead of someone risking nothing warping a gunner or logging in a gunner to push someone away from your undock. If you siege, it should then disable certain services such as the market on the astras/fort/keeps and mining laser/industry on refineries/EC. Also, while seiged increase fuel consumption by 50-100%. Sieging has a 1-3 hr duration.

-cynos should be countered by scrams. Easy to apply, no new modules needed. Then rework warp core stabs to provide cyno field strength. So one scram provides 1 inhibition, meaning you need one cyno strength to counter. This means max hull/armor ships lose tank and shield ships lose targeting speed/range. HICs become the defacto counter due to infinite strength. Maybe give things like the monitor a highslot that can only fit cynos with a high base strength for fleets.
---
-ADCU needs its duration halved and HACs given a role bonus to duration to keep them the same. Then nerf jag speed and increase its sig radius.
---
That link doesn't work, but if you're talking about the newscaster prank after the plane crash at SFO., then yes, that was also a dumb racist joke.
---
im making sure to use both ad block and my vpns adbloc as well

To be honest, Astra farming would be slightly more balanced if DRBs actually bashed structures. Make them only warp to structure grids when the structure is vulnerable/low power and have them attempt to actively bash the structure. Make them more intelligent in their movements, actively moving around instead of just orbiting one spot, and warping off when they're heavily damaged. This would add risk to the reward of triggering DRBs, making them dangerous to your structures if you don't deal with them immediately. It would also mean that people trying to fight them with Astras would have to get other ships to scram them, due to the limited nature of Astra scrams/points.
---
Nope. We aren't playing the same game. Empire linemembers kept at 4 years of ultra-safe farming mega empire null. In recent months, they lost ridiculously small amounts like 2.5% of all their farm to hunters. That's literally way safer than hisec, and data backs it up. And they got entitled to these conditions. The argument was "effort", but the cited effort belonged to blobs of 50k, 30k, 20k accounts. The linemember HIMSELF pretty much did nothing to deserve an environment safer than hisec. Meanwhile, just because you happen to have 1000-man titan blob as a mega empire, that doesn't entitle you to conditions safer than hisec either.
---
The linemember (and you) thought the rest of Eve is doing fine. With no checks and balances on free farming craze, they pumped the game with ISK, minerals, SP, broke the economy, inflated the flex, devalued capital ships whose balance hinged on their rarity, and gave us your kind of bullshit on mediums of balance discussion.
---
We already began to see changes with blackout. You'll notice them in MER. We already have more stuff being killed. Similar changes will be needed. So you can GTFO with your entitled linemember logic.
---
And you can't be concerned about the "small guy" and "small fleets" while defending your ultra safe conditions. The "small fleet" has nowhere else to go than umbrella regions now. Umbrellas sucked up all other regions dry. Vast majority of null activity happens in them.

Meta the guns (and drones as necessary), switch ammo, drones, and resists according to the mission rat damage profile. General advice for BC fits is "have a T2 tank" so don't meta the shield mods.
---
This is the classic mostly-passive shield buffer fit for missions: as you get more comfortable you can swap one or more shield power relays and/or rigs for damage enhancement.
---
Hi, glad to see that jump gates are on there, my corporation [P3AK] has a history of being a small aggressive group in 0.0, attacking people using entosis mechanics in particular.
---
Our experiences with the jump gates are that they are very overpowered and prevent aggression. We defended drones with SKILLU jumpgating from insmother to MT02 several times whilst fighting in detorid, the mobility they give is insanely OP, turning 33 Jumps into ~8 etc. You can see this power projection in every large bloc at the moment; goons with access upto tribute from delve in ~15 minutes etc. We also saw that it was pointless for us to attack into FiRe co. space, despite their geographically poor staging location the jumpgates meant they could get back and forth with no consequences to prevent our harrassment campaign. Overall they are a huge crutch for larger groups and prevent smaller entities from nibbling at the edges of empire unless said empires decide to abandon space, like what is happening in Tribute/ Vale atm.
---
The other thing i'll call out is the ability to switch sov TZ vulns around so frequently; a couple of times this has happened to us when we start making progress, the guy losing just changes the TZ and kills our campaign completely then changes it back when we leave. Changing TZs on sov should be a serious commitment, not a get out of jail free card that respawns instantly.
---
Good lord how do you know you’re beaten when you can’t even reship into good equipment
---
is synda defecting again

When (if) I have a rorq, I'll probably switch over to covs. For now, though I like the procs ability to clear rats and stay on grid.
---
T2 Logi Gila that has HUGE bonuses to logi drones but not much for conventional reps, please.
---
Why do people accept enemy fleet invites, accept enemy fleet warps, and lose 350B ships?
---
CCP has enough trouble to properly balmce shit as it is. We actually arguably already have too many ships
---
Going through Niarja and Uedama without a web/scout alt in a freighter is oftentimes akin to gating a freighter in null-sec, Zkill isn't very reliable as there are almost always bumpers and scanners on the gates. Relying on luck or the tryhards in Anti-ganking will make you pretty quickly quit hauling
---
First off, nice multiboxing. 
---
Second, I almost died laughing when you guys warped back your dreads you got our earlier to delete their carriers. Holy smokes. 
---
Any reason why their muninn fleet extracted before their caps got safe? From the looks they failed to alpha legions (gasp) but they were putting out enough pressure to keep you on your toes. I am guessing they could have kept the legions at arms length long enough to get the capitals out.
---
Hahahahahahahahahah
---
Ahhhh hahahahahaja
---
Theres something supremely ironic about a guy who lives in an NPC nullsec station whining about asset safety
---
We in TEST are degenerated enough to actually send out invites manually every day for months.

#BUT WHAT ABOUT HONOR REEEE
---
Obviously, but the website is open-source and Squizz has said in the past he isn't going to stop anyone from using it, so inevitably large alliances will just upload this source code and add the alliance API onto it which is 9 times out of 10 good enough for their PvE needs.
---
I'm hoping that Squizz is aware of this and is trying to push CCP to make the change themselves.
---
Aight cool I was just making sure, better to ask than be the idiot that feeds because he wasn’t sure lol
---
I mean, yeah but to trade illegal goods into a system
---
What the fuck are you going to be smuggling supers out of goon space?
---
Oh yeah?
---
..Everything was - at the time. We didn't have domains, we didn't have ownership of channels, we didn't have anything. It was bound to fuck us over at some point.
---
That, and you're talking out your ass - it was never even a vote.
---
Theres nothing illegal that is worth trading
---
Time for someone else start new KB
---
He quit to start doing overwatch commentary/run his own team? Iunno, he cut communications down so fucking fast that I don't really know exactly what.
---
Yeaaah, wasn't my decision. Rip.
---
Have a question regarding this invite + warp that "bait" the Vanquisher. How this works ? The guy cannot cancel the  warp before its initiate ? Or he dont even realise he was in the wrong fleet ? The latter seems to dumb to be true but i dont understand if its really this or there is a mecanic im not aware of.
---
Website, discord, and ingame channels (all of them, even xup channels). We had to move, or likely end up being forced to move at a later date.
---
&gt;That, and you're talking out your ass - it was never even a vote
---
Wtf yes it was, until Maded was like "eh gonna do it anyways".
---
Ingame channel yeah, i remember when not having admin on it fucked up when it switched to xmpp or whatever. That was a good call.
---
In any case, nuSpectre is dumb and not at all what original spectre was all about, with this whole personal army/war on provi shit.
---
o/ guy who gave me 50mil after killing me
---
I still don’t understand why supercaps sit tethered on keepstars when they can dock and prevent this from happening.
---
o/ guy who tackled my nano domi in his executioner like a boss 😂
---
a really fun lowsec brawl, and the best part: no snuff supers
---
Smuggling isn't a thing in EVE, sadly.
---
He fell to a fake standing fleet. Essentially someone opened a fleet and called it standing fleet (whatever frat calls theres) and undocked. At that point the owner initiated the fleet warp to our astrahus on there keepstar grid in there staging( Note: That thing is there since months). He has a few seconds to react. He did not. And then it was game over.
---
The same recourse a frigate has against a rapid light cruiser, not much
---
Standing fleets have awoxers too
---
At this point I would like to point out that PH opsec is non-existent to make us more newbeans friendly, but we still haven't been destroyed.
---
last week Brave left free-move on in their standing fleet so our spy invited us all to fleet and then our FC linked fucking desto in fleet and we got caught before getting any kills
---
waffles is a training corp btw
---
Cali proper
---
Guristas 
---
Mordus legion.
---
eh, like 90% of fleets used to go to provi anyway
---
Might want to take a second look at that.
---
If someone held a random vote, it was dumb from the get-go. Regardless of any vote we'd switch - it's basically waiting a timebomb to go off until your website, mumble, discord or ingame channels get fucked over.
---
Provi war, not my decision. Getting a useless guy to run said war, also not my decision. I don't agree with a lot of things, but hey, it's not my party alone. We do what the people and fc's want to do.
---
Others should be at risk, not me.
---
Only if by "people" you are referring to accounts that use bots to Plex themselves.

Dude...
---
Try scanning in null.
---
It is pretty much what are you looking for, but with different cover. Transporting and gathering valuable stuff in dangerous space with everyone around you trying to kill you evwn in highsec.
---
The bonus for those ships seems to be the hardest part and it should be something that's new.  
---
Warp speed is covered by Angel Cartel already.  
---
Weapons I would chose either Rails or Projectiles, since there are already two pirate shiplines with missile bonus (Mordus/Guristas).  
---
Maybe a target painter bonus, both Minmatar and Caldari have ships that use them.
---
What I'm hearing is "Gurista BC/Command Ship with mad bonuses to RR drones, and InfoLinks for ewar strength."
---
I would rather not have someone who unironically uses a pimp fit Widow tell CCP how to help make elite pvp good again. This kinda ruins your credibility:

What omg no it’s just what people call them because they are bad.
---
Wew lad
---
My sec status went to -5.0 FC what do?
---
the reason you have very little discussion happening is b/c all your ideas and suggestions are terrible and the only people who actually care are people terribly bad at EVE
---
Subcaps excluding t3’s and perhaps the widow are in a really nice place. I remember when it was hurricanes online then drakes. I think more pirate ships would be cool
---
how am i sposed to brag about how 1337 i am if i have to sit for 2 houres ?
---
Or balance the stuff that is already in game first
---
Heavy bombers are a bad idea. Law of Malcanis in action. I can use it to kill caps, but heaven help us when Goons put 1000 of them on field.
---
In regards to your WH changes:
---
&gt; FOF ranges fixed.
---
&gt; Add scramming towers to C5/C6 anomalies. They stop scramming once the site is completed.
---
Not knowledgeable enough to comment on either.
---
&gt; They either despawn. Or they don't warp to grids with structures. Or they kill bubbles and warp off from grids with structures.
---
Really any fix will work.
---
&gt;Take back the Z142 nerf years ago.
---
Content is King again!
---
&gt;Standard 3.3b (cap capable) nullsec statics for all C6 wormholes.
---
C6 space is for krabs. They don't have any interest in Nullsec, and Nullsec has no interest in hunting WH ratters. 
---
Right now all the real PvP groups live in C5-&gt;C5 space because it allows for Farm and PvP. So a C6 nullsec static won't make where a majority of the content happens any better. The challenge is a nullsec static on all C5s is bad and might push some of these groups away. Maybe a nullsec static on some C5s?
---
A good way to make things interesting would be creating a distinction between H296 (C5&gt;C5), V793 (C5-&gt;C6), and W237 (C6-&gt;C6) because all are 3 Bil total mass holes. Maybe bump the -&gt;C6 holes to 5 bil mass?
---
Also, adding C5 statics to C6 space. May bring more content to C6 space.
---
Crazy idea, but adding a nullsec, C5, and C6 static to some C6 systems would be awesome. You can find PvP in nullsec and the C5. You can kill krabs in the C6. You can farm across all the statics. Maybe the PvP groups would move to C6 space as it generates MAX content. That would become crazy if the nullsec and C6 static had more that 3 bil total mass.
---
&gt;New shattered C7s. Massive (20 b - roll with 3 higgs carriers) 
---
nullsec statics. No farm inside.
---
I have no idea what this is supposed to improve. No one is going to live in C7 shattered space. A large mass hole won't benefit anyone who isn't living there. How do you imagine this being used?
---
dont smartbomb your own fleet? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Agreed to an extent. But we need weird bonuses, cause faction. It has to be strange. Target painters are covered, and there are also tons of turret bonused faction ships, tons. 
---
Keeping in line with the Interbus theme, Matari speed, and Caldari tech, QRF has to be the focus or it all falls apart. 
---
Mass reduction for align time per Minmatar level? Reload time bonus for role?
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA that screen kills me.
---
Now it's Muninns vs Eagles.
---
You mouthbreather its MisterFrisker
---
I imagine the Sisters of Eve Capital class ship would be something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-3s8AhMbK4) that can jump bridge up to 3 systems (chained by wormholes) away, nothing else. Though might be a bit OP (MORE RINGS! MORE!!! -SoE, probably)
---
Killboard says it all
---
Subcap pve , if it’s deemed too safe considering the majority of people i personally fly with won’t bother any more except newbros...
---
You can’t nerf it any more unless you get rid of t3 immunity or covops.
---
There’s a reason he left GSF. 
---
In Goonswarm we have a defined system in which anyone can FC but you’re limited to certain cheap doctrines. Once you prove you’re not an idiot you get promoted to Ops where you’re give keys to more expensive doctrines. You eventually can do caps if you want (not everyone wants to) and eventually supers. 
---
Redline never made it past Skirmish FC (the lowest level) and he began to realize we were never going to give him keys to take out anything bigger.....so he left to form a “PvP Alliance” of his own, allowing his own delusions of grandeur to think that a mass exodus of Goons would follow him out the door.
---
No one did.
---
After 2-3 weeks of leading his new alliance of which he was the only member, he joined NCdock. We laughed about it and warned folks on Reddit. 
---
And then ?????? happened and suddenly he was   “Sky Marshal” of Spectre’s Provi campaign.
---
i dont know if it makes me hard or cringe at how much intell it has it knew more about me than i do  nice work
---
As opposed to Ferox or Muninn/Eagle online?
---
cool, [Mordus too](https://imgur.com/8Rb2mub)
---
Their logi died so munins we’re getting deleted fast.... would’ve been smart of them to jump in a shield triage or two
---
Randos have been declaring war on us for over a decade. Our response is and has always been "uh, okay?" It means absolutely nothing to us and we expend zero effort on trying to make them stop. Hell, we view it as a carrot to get our guys out in 0.0 where they belong, instead of languishing uselessly in worthless hisec.
---
I don't know if it's worth but there is this site CCP advertise about a while ago https://www.eveworkbench.com/
---
I'm the happy owner of a Domi, been doing L4 since a while with it. Like the sniper style with it. Place yourself wisely, drop out sentry drones and then enjoy.
---
I remember when I used to do this to TEST in their early days, with a blaster falcon of all things, ahhh good times.
---
you're just playing it a different way, but we all look at it as just a video game. you appear to be getting buttblasted over the fact that other people enjoy a different playstyle than you. 
---
you're wasting your energy.
---
Sounds like a bunch scrubs who will most likely just camp around Jita.

How is this any different than PIRAT and the rest of them that wardec but never leave high sec?

This is what i do. Nothing can catch my astero. But i only use it for data/relic sites. As long as im watching my shit i wont ever lose that ship!
---
&gt;we all look at it as just a video game.
---
Do you, though?
---
This made me laugh harder than it should've
---
I don't judge you, as long as someone falls for it why not repeat it over and over again?! :)
---
Tht'd be the first good looking titan in the game. 
---
Yes, even the Avatar is ugly as fuck.
---
The nullsec blocs don’t represent the whole of eve! I come across loads of different ship types outside of the 1000 man fleets
---
do they not teach you how to post in eve uni
---
Mining too much spod

I guess it's multiboxing with keyboard inputs broadcast over all game clients
---
The bots aren't as bad for the as all the market scammers, I know a few people that quite Eve and will not come back to the game after losing all their isk.

Most beautiful metaphorically because renters suck and also most beiautiful literally, becaus lookt at that almost perfect line.

Thanks m8 I try
---
I don't entirely either
---
But I do enjoy aspects of it, for example the research I have to do, and getting into it.
---
The updating of orders is a bit ...... repetitive.....
---
But it enables me to take my first ever dread, put a 4b fit on it with two 600m bhaalgorns in the fleet hangar and welp it against Snuff defending the eve radio station (sadly I fucked up the recording)
---
THAT was fun
---
they don't use sentries, they use heavy drones and then orbit the area at 50km w/ AB on
---
Unfortunately, this decrease in slope probably directly corresponds to an increase in another renters slope.
---
Theres plenty of salt in space.
---
Gone sexual
---
You can't do it without fear of losing them, especially not since the nullsec local blackout.  It's always a risk to be afk and undocked, but you can still do tricks like sitting a character on the gate (in a dead end) and listening for the gate sound.
---
But more importantly, it's too easy to get locked into the isk/hr &gt; fun/hr mindset.  I don't know what you enjoy most about eve, but for most people, optimizing themselves out of the game completely via afk playstyles is not fulfilling.  Maybe try something like abyssals?  Or look into nullsec NPC mission running, or wormholes, for more combat-focused PVE that won't make you realize one day you've been paying 15$ a month to succeed at not playing a game.
---
I as a hunter lost about 15% of all my income. That's the amount of risk I am taking, to the extent that my kb is 66% snuggly.
---
Your Delve carebears lost about 3% of theirs. That's the amount of risk they are taking.
---
When we are equal, you can talk to me about my lack of risk vs. theirs. Until then, GTFO.
---
It's even easier to right click &gt; block, or even just form a fleet of one/join standing fleet
---
These are fat af capitals too, plenty of time to leave and ctrl-space.
---
I honestly am just struggling to understand how in the world this works on *anyone* much less a faction capital pilot.
---
Oh I see.
---
This doesn't make any sense
---
Ummm.. block? Doesn’t the block option also blocks them from sending invite to fleet or even be allowed to see the fleets?
---
I’m technically in a wormhole Corp now. But I’m not a fan of management what class wormhole are you in and do you currently have any industrial guys? Or are you just shipping stuff in?
---
That's what I thought, that they just didn't really care to lose it or where way more better in combat than me. 
---
Well you said it, I'm just enjoying to check what I'm gonna be facing and get into the fight. And now indeed I will probably go for these others PVE activities you mentioned. Ty.
---
Could return local but instead scramble the inputs so they could be in Jita but still show up in wicked creek local.
---
IIRC yes, and if your smart you are already in standing before you even undock so it isn't an issue. The people who are smart enough to block the fake invites or avoid them are not the same people who are accepting fleet warps in their faction titan onto a hostile citadel.
---
Frat is trying to protect its bad players by abusing the ticketing system instead of educating its members on how to not die like morons, or maybe they failed to educate? Idunno.
---
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. CCP should focus on rebalancing the classes first (notably caps), only then adding new ships
---
c2 wormhole, we do both ATM but we are trying to ramp up to where we just make everything ourselves. we do have Indy people but they are juggling multiple other corps as well
---
Nice metagame mate. If you keep the "Olmeca doesn't know the game" angle you'll get 3500 of my votes to vote someone else by next year. Gogo! :)

thanks! :D
---
Every time CCP makes a new playable ship, they have to come up with stats that are not only balanced for the class, but different enough from every other ship in the game to justify its existence.  When you get to a certain number of ships that's just absurdly harder to do than it sounds, aside from being pointless.
---
I sent you a private convo
---
Thanks! Yeah both TZ tanking and Ansiblex are addressed in the document.
---
I agree that blackout is a good start but doesn't solve everything.
---
"increase isk/h in null sec" i agree with that before the blackout i've never farmed in anom it's boring and you make more isk with exploration or FW unless you have 5+account "afk farm" but with the blackout it's not even an option at least for smaller entity   
---
i'm glad with the blackout it bring mooar explosion but i think they should add other change if they want to make it permanent (and it would be great)   
---
\-a way to punish the farm under an umbrella (HIC blackops, instant cyno jam, ressource depletion...love your idea about a shutdown cyno module btw maybe make them prevent a cyno too)   
---
\-buff isk/h rewarding as a wormhole (if they make null sec more dangerous than WH, no more asset safety blops-land...) the more dangerous null is the more rewarding it should be, and you can't be drop in WH  
---
i really think the "isk sink" should be explosion not taxes or something, taxe don't bring any content explosions does, soo here some questions/idea :  
---
\-greatly delay/remove the "free intel" when someone attack a structure/entos a Ihub,TCU structure should give you the information when they are in structure and only 1-2h before the timer, Ihub don't give any information at all (force spread)  
---
\-Ihub should be cheaper and entos faster

\-keepstar should have a "maximum supercap capacity" and give supercap the possibility to "dock" outside a fortizar (always tether, can't be bump) BUT a supercap can't safety log off for more than XXhour, if the keepstar/fortizar die you can kill every supercap docked (a WWB2 can happen but goon or any other big bloc just gonna turtle and nothing will change actually, not with this change) (or just remove asset safety &lt;3)  
---
for TZ-tanking what you think about a way to "grind" the timer ? like : defender define a timer let's say 20h ET but they need to choose a -8 or a +8timer aswell, attacker can "farm" the shield timer if they do that everyday they grind 1hour everytime they down the shield until they hit the -8 / +8timer or kill the structure, if defender defend the shield timer then attacker need to start from the begining  
---
\+ for factionnal just delete PvE missions and the standing, remove the insigna (and increase the LP cost of faction modules) only pvper should gain LP (and i make my money with FW L4 run) farm while you pvp, the dream

Outside of the account set up this is a pretty shit guide for anyone new. But hey i guess you were able to sneak in your referral code. Telling new players to rat in null sec is by far the dumbest thing anyone can do, and they are not going to be able to afford anything over the several million mark.

probably frat because they have links to the best bots

So your argument is that you lost 15% of your income in a region that is hostile to you, but we only lost 3% of our income in a region that is... friendly to us?  
---
We don't take fleets to Delve... we take them to other regions...  
---
.........................................  
---
ok.
---
there isn't
---
when you undock, your cap is already at speed, so if you get warped to a point directly in line of the undock it's pretty much instawarp
---
Absolutely love the video. Couldn’t agree more.  Hecate is fast enough to roam, able to operate solo and ALWAYS take the bait. 
---
I’ve taken to flying a faction scram and a cap battery but it really isn’t needed. 
---
A buddy of mine flys a rep and reactive armor hardener.  He tanks things he shouldn’t naturally be able to.
---
&gt; "Small ships should be able to swarm and destroy caps and moonwalk away from a response fleet"
---
Suppose this is true. 
---
Capitals are now as common as T3Cs now, or more. They should be treated as such. That's all I argue in the document.
---
i lost 15% of my brain cells reading his post hth

Minmitar: 7.5% reduction to signature radius per level
---
Caldari: 10% bonus to hybrid weapon tracking and rate of fire per level 
---
Role: 50% bonus to ship shield hitpoints
---
Something like a shield ANI that can fit a brick tank while counteracting the sig bloom with reasonable tracking and projection and a fast cycle time for chewing through same or smaller size targets.
---
&gt; the Rorqual is not overpowered by itself. If anything the solo Rorqual is underpowered.
---
I agree with this. They become problems when multiboxed under supercap umbrellas. I would have seen them harder to multibox (like supers), and spread out.

I mean.. if they are stupid and/or lazy enough to not take common sense steps to protect themselves then they deserve the losses lol...
---
I mean I agree with the people saying CCP have a lot to balance already, but I definitely wouldn't complain about getting more Sansha and SoE ships - although I'd prefer subcaps. I don't think we need more capitals (well - except those Angel ones because they look so good).

It's an insta warp when undocking. So if you accept you are insta warped to the citadel

I disagree. There is a section of this on the linked document.

&gt; *Last  year, I as a whaler lost about 15% of all my Delve whaling income  during Delve whaling. That's the amount of risk I am taking, to the  extent that my kb is 66% snuggly.*

&gt;*Your  Delve carebears lost about 3% of their Delve carebearing income during  Delve carebearing. That's the amount of risk they are taking.*  
---
&gt;*When we are equal, you can talk to me about my lack of risk vs. theirs. Until then, GTFO.*
---
Quoted in case you try to backtrack on this beautiful example of how dumb you actually are.
---
No one deploys to hostile regions anticipating some dank income or dependable revenue stream, that's just retarded. Most (*like 99.99%, seems you missed the news flash*) people have a revenue stream that supports their pvp recreational activities. This is your disconnect with reality - if you go out looking for a fight you should have a 100% expectation you will lose your ship, but you don't, it's the opposite - for some reason you have the 100% expectation the opposition should lose their ship.
---
It's becoming fairly obvious that you are a PVEr trying to PVE with real people and it's not going as expected now since CCP removed the easy mode of nabbing excavators.
---
All the dudes you like to think you are super cool with have alts that are mining r64s and r32s in low sec / null sec systems far away from Delve.
---
Metagame? Caring about killboard? lmao you're trying to hard.
---
I'm simply just referencing evidence to support my statement.
---
Overhauling the attribute system would be amazing but realistically its probably a lot of work since it was originally done so long ago, which is sad. I do like your idea of of just 2 constant rates of SP: one for alphas and one for omegas
---
Are there any decent market hubs in minmatar fw space? Somewhere i could reliably refit/reship with basic frig/destroyer hulls?  or do people just use 3rd parties like redfrog or whatever people use these days?
---
Thanks now I can find where the fights are going on in my region again.
---
that vanq is thiccer than a bowl of oatmeal
---
Plus everything else The Little Astra That Could has helped kill. We're way more isk positive because of that amazing astra!
---
I make my money while whaling. A far greater ratio of that money converts to lossmails compared to your carebears. Thats literally the only way to objectively measure risk taken.
---
Now how op or ridiculous you think my moneymaking is irrelevant to how much risk I am taking vs your carebears.
---
Which means your group doesn't rely on opsec then does it?
---
&gt; Remove esi alltogether.
---
No.
---
Ah they learned fast, didn't work for long. I think ya need a nice combination of a warzone going on and the added chaos of moving into a new home for it to really shine.
---
I’d like a Pacifier style ship that has a bonus for having minus sec status.
---
please tell me more about what i think
---
Probably because Muninns and Eagles are real bad until you have the alpha capabilities which you won't really find in any group other than blobs.
---
you realize these "grr crabs" have alts set up in regions away from Delve for war zone and deployment use right? Or does the whole use alt B to support other alt A idea completely fly over that slow brain of yours?
---
Waiting for the triglavian blops here

&gt; Last year, I as a whaler lost about 15% of all my Delve whaling income during Delve whaling. That's the amount of risk I am taking, to the extent that my kb is 66% snuggly.
---
Let me see if I can interpret this convulted mess correctly.
---
Of every 100 Million Isk you pulled in from your 'whaling' activities, you netted only 85 Million Isk profit.  15 Million isk was charged off to various costs of doing business.  So you have an 85% profit margin operating in delve in a PVP 'preying' activity.  You prey on PvE players, choosing targets carefully for safety versus effect, and attempt to maximize your profit and minimize costs.
---
&gt;Your Delve carebears lost about 3% of their Delve carebearing income during Delve carebearing. That's the amount of risk they are taking.
---
Delve residents, who pay approximately 15% tax to fund their infrastructure, numerous structures, and other various programs, lose a further 3% (according to your figures) - so have a profit margin of 82%.  They make less than you do, and constantly have to account for harassment attacks and other PvP players impinging upon their chosen play style.
---
&gt;When we are equal, you can talk to me about my lack of risk vs. theirs. Until then, GTFO.
---
You are right, it is unequal - you pull 85% profit, and a typical Delve resident pulls in ~82%.
---
The thing is that most people afk ratting or mining don't enjoy PVE at all, any part of it. So they just look for the easiest/fastest way to make isk so they can PVP.
---
I'm one of those people, I'm usually roaming ony main while my alt orbits an anom.
---
I didn't say there wasn't counterplay.
---
Not everyone has unlimited escalation potential.
---
Well, the point is that you will have to press it again, and again, and again. But youre right, doesnt require fighter ui but rather the need for repetative input.
---
A region of space isn't hostiile or friendly to someone by default. Just because you have citadels and titans in it, it doesn't entitle you to 97% safety.
---
Well then, I guess you get to twiddle your dick for a day if none of the non-stargate options meet your standards in this hypothetical situation.
---
I mean who wouldn't whore on that
---
I pay my taxes too mate.
---
And delve taxes mostly go to delve ships and structures (if not shadowy rmt, as idk what some does with a couple hundred trillions). I pay for ships and structures when I decide to have them too mate.

That kill cost you 50bil... Frat lost about the same... plus the titan.
---
Not true. We sometimes roam with 2 or 3 muninns. With the right support they can still alpha things
---
Hmmm we sometimes roam with one or two muninns in fleet. With the right support they can do some serious damage
