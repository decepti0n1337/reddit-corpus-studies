Yeah, I'm not sure about the level 5 thing, but I'd guess it's just sitting at range and shooting with aurora. Although with a set of asklepians and drugs you might be able to rep a T4 site at close range. I'm also really unsure about how agro-switching works in abyssal space, but by using the assault damage control effect you could take turns being the "tank" of the group.

shit i'm runing it at 4k and i feel like there's still not enough room
---
Well I don’t deem you right so -4 votes from me
---
He’s not running tard
---
Then why the fuck do you think you have time for the fucking CSM lol
---
Well Goons started getting heat for this originally when The Mittani told Goons to not report other Goons for botting. It didn't start when the PB rental arrangements came down.
---
Samsung has a 32:9 super-ultrawide monitor that MIGHT be able to fit the overview
---
I actually had  a 32" ultrawide at an old job about 2 years ago - EVE on that thing was a fucking religious experience
---
Halp I need a medic I've been shot!

I call it like it is also..... retard.

---
Put the tin foil away, it's not a good color on you.
---
&gt; but make Eve significantly harder for newbros.
---
newbros don't anchor/manage citadels and don't have assets worth using. they can use the ability to hunt without local to stay interested in the game and generate content for themselv3es
---
We should have a "story event" where some event happens that causes the distraction of jita 4-4.    Juuuuust to shake up the market.
---
Well at 5'2" you should be able to fit into a UPS box or a large suitcase.

Fucking lol at doing ccps job for them for free. No Thanks. They want botters gone that's there job. I bet you live in hi sec and mine. Since you clearly don't know how to value your time properly.

There's your problem, dude. I'm surprised your chip still functions at all. When did you last dust your computer?
---
To go with the analogy helping a person in the street a little bit until paramedics arrive is usually what you do.   If you do to bots what everyone expects of alliances then you basically don't need paramedics anymore.
---
I mean if you report people who is to know unless you flap your mouth about it?
---
You can't boosh in highsec unfortunately.

sorry looking for a non toxic community
---
Yes -- but EANM was built to sync settings between accounts on the same system. It is a step in the right direction but not the goal I have in mind.
---
You can copy settings between clients. It's annoying to do but you only have to set up one client..
---
Until you want different settings for each client anyways

Where does the 800x600 requirement come from?

Are there any websites/programs that can track eve networth. I'm looking for something like Mint(breaks down income and expenses).

I have worked extensively to develop frigate fits for abyssal space, namely dark filaments. I will link a hookbill fit that 3 of will run T1 and T2 dark filaments with ease. Its also an AB setup, so its very forgiving if you accidental de-anchor or anything. Only take the blue pill drug if you absolutely have to as the capacitor penalty can be bad. You can absolutely use meta missile launchers in these fits if they need to.

you know what, if they raid bot space the NPCs don't show up in local or dscan and they could be programmed to tackle carriers. have that for a week and we might just stop inflation for that week.

Wow downvotes. Well you have a lot of choices depending on your style. Atron, Incursus, Tristan, Tormentor, Executioner, Kestrel, Merlin, Breacher, Rifter works, ... what do you have in mind?

Anything from local potato to imported Lamborghini

Nah. The 2k is just for what is inside the tower. External stuff ill worry about later

Also keep in mind you’ll need 2 GPUs for 6 monitors
---
Helios has friend.

Wow! Luckyyyyy, youve got friends?

Yeah. Im more trying to debate what GPUs. I know eve doesnt really push them, but I need them to hold up for newer games for the next 4 ish years till my 3rd rebuild

Triglavian wrecks mean triglavian rigs?
---
The moment I tab out of the game to look at Reddit or fiddle with Pathfinder or change the music I listen to is the moment someone is going to DM me or need something answered or pop up in public chat. Or the guy who hasn't spoken in DMs for ten minutes is going to say something.
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
I'm the same way as that guy and it certainly was enjoyable enough to keep coming back every now and then.
---
Do you need a loan?
---
No joke, my first pc didnt have shader model 3.0 so eve wouldnt actually run. When I decided it needed to be uograded I went all out and my current computer (not includind the ssds I put in later) was born. 1 22 inch moniter and a crappy keyboard
---
Yeah, i've seen people do the lvl.5s in solo retributions, but there is probably a good amount of luck involved, but it seems like people mostly do them solo as a challenge, rather than actually to make money.
---
Except that everyone is a member of the club called "eve" and CCP run this club, paint it in any light you want, but the job falls to the people who run the game to make sure all the people playing it obey the rules, can corps police it? Yes. Would it be neat if they did? Yes. Are they obligated to? Not even a little bit.
---
u/scopehone Buy my shit in delve

It's why I already don't use the neocom. Keyboard shortcuts for me. Now if they delete my shortcuts I'll be pissed.
---
There was somebody in the system of Jita advertising a method to multiple any isk donated to him. However, upon doing so, I received no isk in return. Such scams are the result of a dishonest media that allows such scammers to perpetuate!

Ali was great to work with throughout the process of the LZHX logo creation.  Must have been at least 7 major vastly different versions of it with numerous minor tweaks of each one all while being critiqued by 20+ people.

Can't upvote Ali enough.

The fan/heatsync is completely clean, either the fan is not spinning up as fast as it can go, or there is a problem at the CPU/heatsink junction. 
---
It’s a laptop BTW, I want to take it apart and redo the thermal compound, but it goes to normal temps under regular workloads, I’d rather not risk it. It will only be used occasionally after I get the PC built.
---
On that note, I really can’t find anything concrete about how a Ryzen 2400 iGPU will handle two clients on high settings, it runs a lot of newer games ok, but no where can I find someone who plays Eve with it. If I throw a RX 580 in it later that will do it right?

I changed her voice to the Japanese one which sounds so much better.
---
Fly cheap frigates a lot. Fly a *lot* of them. You will lose a lot of them. 
---
Buy 3-5 of the same fit. Fly them all, lose them all. Which each death, make a note of what you think your most glaring failure was; This could be not enough range, not enough cap, not enough HP, not enough damage, etc. 
---
Find the breaking point that feels most significant to you, and make a new fit that attempts to correct that issue *only*. Buy 3-5 of this new fit, fly them, lose them.
---
Repeat this process.
---
I like this system, because it's fun, isn't too monotonous, and lets you learn piloting skills and fitting skills.
---
(As an aside, note that most fights are determined before the combatants engage. Learning what your ship is good or bad against is very important. You will learn these things as you follow my formula.)
---

Thank you!

Why the fuck would you put adaptive plating on? Your tank is not being shot
---
Enyo Brian is terminal
---
What is this?
---
Wow. That seems like a lot of luck. I'm not sure how many sleeper battleships can spawn at once in a T5, but if you can get four of them it's going to take a really long time to grind through the repping.
---
Tbf the only way to do that is nuke it from high orbit and remove them.
---
In other games, there are bots too.
---
A sophisticated-enough bot is very difficult to tell from a regular player via automated tools.  So in those other games, they ask the players to report bots too.
---
TFW Even before the allegations were cleared against Brisc Rubal, he still seems like a more trustworthy guy than anveri.
---
Why do CCP make shitty changes like this? Liike who are they talking to who thinks removing the wallet icon from the Necom is a good idea?
---
water is not wet. wet is a property of solids that have liquids on them. liquid cannot make itself 'wet'
---
Hhaha a few plot twists in there
---
Next up the slaves are gonna start getting all uppity and wanting "freedom"
---
are you that much of an idiot that you don't acknowledge use cases besides the idiotic one you posted here?
---
The problem is if CCP makes available the ways to easily catch bots, the botters will just become more sophisticated.
---
For example, the easiest way to catch a bot is the account is active 23.5/7.
---
If CCP makes it easy for corps to catch that (or makes it obvious that this is one the criteria CCP looks for to find bots), then the botters just double the number of accounts, and run each one 12/7.
---
Since that's doable by a human player, you lose that easy filter for finding and banning/killing bots.
---
CCP probably is running those reports.
---
CCP will never make it clear that they are running these reports, because it's trivial for botters to avoid - double the accounts, run each one 12/7 instead of 24/7.
---
God almighty, even government service websites don’t fully support IE anymore. W10 barely does.
---
There is no activity in any video game that can't be botted.
---
Nah they were rails. I got kind of aggressive and ended up coming within like 9 km, and think maybe if I tried it again more conservatively I could do it, but the amount of warning I got seemed too low. Like, I scooted in to try to apply the web and my armor was just...gone. One cycle of repper, and the second volley popped me.
---
Good thing this idiot retard Alex jones is banned from Facebook and Instagram
---
Rule #1, always take bait.
---
Bringing all the corpses your corp has gathered recently into a drifter hole and sacrificing them for gudfites and good luck
---
https://youtu.be/g9eJm0lNoFY?t=83 mute it right away. but its there.
---
Username doesn't quite check out, since I'm assuming your name, unlike your communication, isn't Jibrish.
---
Feels like NPE needs like a bunch old bitter vets from all over place gathered to figure out how to fix this.
---
Rolled under that is: Actually useful Overview.
---
Shoulda upgraded to Piece of Shit 2009 already.
---
The truth
---
Local is broken. *Especially* when it's working.
---
Have 3 of them...Eve Vegas 3rd year CCP literally gave them away.
---
Lol, just got banned from the Praise Bob Discord for trying to be a candidate. Those guys are so insecure lol
---
I suspect this mechanic will be highly metagamed to ban the person you don't like if it is to be implemented. Join enemy corp with alts, bot, get caught, voila.
---
Honestly I’m quitting the game for a year if they rework the overview so I can wait for the inevitable hellstorm if bugs to be fixed before I return.
---
Ok so here's a question. Do you know what the CSM is and what it does?
---
:Popcorn:
---
who are you
---
Who cares, my left nut has more of a hope of getting on csm than you do, and I'm not running
---
and ship folders are handled by titans
---
Yeah I've been asked that more than a few times today. Please see my other comments. 
---
o7 to Test, NullBros through and through. Always good for a fight and don't run.
---
Nobody cares
---
Please let us know what it goes for. Given that CCP was outright giving some of these ships away a few years ago, I'm curious if there's any market for them now.
---
(FWIW, I wouldn't be surprised if you had to drop to $150 w/shipping, but best of luck all the same!)
---
[BRAIN IS EXPANDING](https://i.imgur.com/ne55XZg.png)
---
*A most curious game*
---
So like, imagine a balloon. As air goes in, it inflates. Imagine plex being the balloon.
---
The damage they deal and tank is pretty absurd compared to other ships in the game. Just how strong do they need to be?
---
I know what inflation is, just wondering why it happened
---
Something happened last Aug?
---
So, just to clarify:
---
You join this discord, act like an absolute idiot in general chat, ping Eddy endlessly for roles..
---
And now you're whining because he kicked you for being an idiot?
---
Ignorance is bliss.  Have you roamed through kwg space at all in the last few weeks? Most of them are docked and stay that way.
---
Maybe because you're a spazz who kept pinging for roles when you even started yourself that you couldnt go to any of the summits or participate in what it means to be a csm rep? https://imgur.com/a/GIxdZ6Z
---
You keep calling me an idiot. But what did I do that was idiotic? Please post screenshot?
---
I was just trying to engage the voters but they wouldn't let me. What's so wrong about asking to participate? CCP has accepted my application, ExookiZ even added me to the ballot in Praise Bob, worked with him for years. So salty, did I sleep with someone's sister by accident and that's why they won't let me in?
---
clicking rocks and slamming F1 isn't intellectual; does this nerd even know his attempted constituency
---
Even with a degree in economics it’d be difficult to ascertain the actual root cause as how markets evaluate the value of any given item is inherently fuzzy and driven by irrational behaviour as well as actual market forces.
---
I would postulate that it’s a mix of market manip, speculation increasing demand but not supply &amp; the continued impacts of the PPI/SPPI split caused by a massive drop in mineral prices diluting the worth of most ‘casual’ gameplay styles.
---
More opportunities to rob people, amirite
---
I read your comments in this thread before I posted that. I'm still not sure if you know what the CSM is about and therefore you should reconsider until you figure it out.
---

Other commenters may make of it what they will.
---
Yes. And no. Everyone including devs will shit in my face for this, but you cannot interpret the economy in this game. You can finger fuck yourself with analysis of a ton of shit, but economics needs politics to function.
---
Why would CCP very publicly shame and ban a player and have to walk it back a week later? I agree it makes no sense but neither does CCP on occasion.
---
I said plainly I'll remote in. And it can't possibly be more work than I already do on Facebook for Wormhole space. Try and keep up dear boy.

&gt;Real life demands a lot of me. Sick wife, plus working 60-70 hours a week. Plus playing in the AU tz, which is dead.  I've never said no to a single fight. Even agreed to a 1v6 with A Band Apart. Killed three before I died. Was fun 
---
And let's remember he wouldn't be able to go to the summits even if by some miracle he was elected.
---
The inflation occurred because of the le memetani liquidating dev-gifted T2 BPOs to buy up all the PLEX, then reselling it on ebay to buy more gigaRAMs for his multi dollar media empire website so he can get more players into goonswarm and mine spod

How long are these chatlogs from, Jesse? Considering you were trying to be Wicked Creek's rentlord for months until WinterCo. gave you the boot, you yourself are complicit in keeping this information to yourself rather than reporting it to CCP.

The downvote brigade is out in full swing, tonight.
---
Who will bring INIT to justice for their crimes?
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid
---
All economies for the most part, unless outside regulated, are inflationary. Eve is the same, this is because a ton of things can create value / isk, but next to nothing removes isk.
---
Pretty much the only thing I can think of that removes isk from the game is people quitting or being banned.
---
You might think what about ships blowing up, but that is a loss of minerals from the game, the isk you paid for that ship is still in the game, plus the new isk you’ll make to replace it. Same with buying things off the PLEX store like skins or game time. That PLEX was either purchased in rl money and therefore was never in the isk economy, or you bought the plex with isk and that isk is still there with whoever you bought it from. So there will always be inflation over time.
---
As to why the recent more pronounced inflation, my guess is the Christmasish skill injector event. This created not only a demand for skill injectors but also for billions and billions of isk to buy these injectors. I know in my Corp there were people ratting non-stop all night every night because they had to inject every 15 hours or whatever. My guess is people went into overdrive creating isk to buy injectors, and as explained above, all that isk is still in the game.
---
thanks for sharing, it gave me a good laugh :)

You put far too much effort into this takedown. You’re one of the good ones o7

Wtf no.

You’re probably just one of those salty INIT supporters.

You will gain new friends. The article was inspiring.
---
Dude, please just stop.
---
make it a medium rig and have some kind of penalty like slowing down targeting or remove resists (like polarized guns). 
---
i think maybe with the right numbers that could be balanced.
---
And yet you dont flair yourself, worried about getting called out i assume
---
I don’t have a flair because my corp, which is a wormhole corp by the way, isn’t big enough to warrant a custom flair on this subreddit.
---
Buy a single 32 inch (4k) ultrawide monitor for around 600 bucks.  You can run 2060s at 350 a pop. Leaves 1300 bucks for the rest of rig assuming you don't count the monitor cost.
---
Asus ROG monitors are very nice.  Have one, thinking of buying another and dumping my 27 Dell.
---
Is it a bigbrain c2 corp with a highsec static?
---
This might be my favorite comment of all time
---
What does it matter to you?
---
And no, it’s a C5 corporation, for your information!
---
From what I’ve seen, most wormholers are in agreement: INIT used dirty hacks to take down Rage. This man said that if he was elected, he would bring them to justice for that. Ezekiel should have no problem gathering enough votes to get elected, with a platform like that.
---
At that point, why not just go full BDSM mask.
---
how about this:

medium rig slot
---
you have to train a skill to increase the no-local timer 
---
45-60 second no-local timer at level 5, maybe it applies to both the user and others, or just others.

big scan radius penalty means **attentive** small and medium ships can warp off before you lock, large and XL ships have to dscan and even then might not align and warp before you land and lock + scram
---
can fit on any mendium ship, maybe not recons because they dont show on dscan. 
---
if the mod was small there would need to be a decision if dictors could fit it.
---
You don't want local immune ghost fleets even with 0 tank. You want 1 tackle ship. Whatever this ship is, it needs to have 0 dps
---
Are there recommended Youtubers or streamers that produce EVE content? I tried searching and it seems like the most recent post is about a year old and the people recommended don't make content anymore.
---
average number of new accounts per month from CCP is 10,000, 3 months worth of fighting bots results in 600 bans, chances are he is not keeping up.

When rolling holes, leave on a high note.

Also, thanks for that screenshot. I can really do some damage to his public image with that. Gonna put that in a special place. Xoxoxo
---
you join the /r/eve discord and your literal only post within the first minute is your campaign add
---
fuck off
---
botters will make more alphas and log into the new one.
---
This is so gross but so good at the same time
---
I have not played EVE in some time and have a follow-up question. Are you exploring AND ratting with your Vexor Navy Issue (I had to Google VNI)? Also, are you running exploration in Null, Low, High, or Wormhole space?
---
That's good advice. thankyou
---
How long until you make another thread about getting kicked from your corp
---
I know I'm banned but would still like that 1v1 someday man.
---
Also always happy to add a new 2A-bro to my circle.
---
Is part of that just the onset of summer?
---
Hell yeah, I pushing out a new sig and could use a dank logo. I don’t mind compensating for your time either in game or irl. I’ll send  a pm

---
Rock on buddy, keep up the good work
---
Hmm, this sounds really familiar. Where else have I heard this said today?
---
Maybe they're not, but *you* are.
---
This is classic artifacting, if you are experiencing this, you are experiencing early symptoms of hardware failure.
---
Nanos, Rigs, just accept your ship is a giant flying cement mixer that has all the agility and maneuverability of an oil tanker run aground.
---
in addition to what everyone has said, it is the sexiest looking covops
---
Of course. Wouldn't you consider it fake and pretentious if I didn't state what drew me there? I'm a man of the people. I don't deceive and manipulate.
---
Everyone likes me on Facebook. It's only a matter of time and persistence before they like me here too. Humans grow fonder of things by repetition and proximity, it's a cornerstone of socialization. So in lay terms, I'm here to stay buddy.
---
Don't think about the numbers, think about the type. 1, 10, 100mn etc are all **afterburners.** These:
---
* don't shut off when warp scrambled
---
* don't bloom your signature radius 
---
* are slower than microwarpdrives.
---
5, 50, 500mn are all **microwarpdrives.** These:
---
* DO get shut down when scrammed
---
*  DO bloom your sig radius (makes you easier to hit)
---
* take a lot more cap and fitting room 
---
* go WAY faster than ABs.
---
If you want to go even faster, look at Nanofiber Internal Structure II (and meta variants, but you should train the prereqs anyway) and Overdrive Injectors. Nanos increase speed AND help your inertia; overdrives only boost speed but add more than nanos (also make you more fat since you have greater speed but same maneuverability).
---
Are you going to provide metrics and reports to alliances that detail who you suspect to be botting, or do you expect your customer to do your job for you?
---
The increments are small, medium, and large for most equipment in the game (excluding capitals). Prop modules are the same. 1, 10, and 100mn for afterburners and 5, 50, and 500mn for microwarpdrives.
---
OH YEA WELL I DON'T LIKE YOU

You know why TRI accepted you in after P-Feed? Cus you were the only FC that would undock against us (and feed) for some reason retarded Tri leadership thought that was a good thing to have on their FC team too.
---
I remember you FCing carriers (when you weren’t supposed to be), saving a fort from 10 typhoons with a carrier fleet very brave. But you also gave the fleet 5 days of fatigue for no good reason as it was in our home region, I also remember on that fleet that you brought 2 buffer fax instead of a active which would’ve obviously been way better.
---
Then you thought you are super 1337 after the AT was won for you by an ex exodus guy and joined a bunch of 1337 alliances only to end up back in the dumpster with your PFED friends as TAPI/XIX pets once again.
---
You’re FCON trash now and forever don’t let getting carried in the AT make you think otherwise.

I could be wrong, and most likely am on this - it's hard to keep up with CCP staff turnover... but I thought there was an economist or two on staff at CCP who's job it was to regulate the in-game economy. Is this no longer a thing? Was it ever? Or am I just crazy? (I'm probably just crazy)
---
Step 1: be large wh alliance
---
Step 2: obtain sov

Step 3: rent sov out

Step 4: “Don’t hunt those guys or we’ll evict you.”

Step 5: ????

Step 6: Profit

Added bonus: bat phone could be 1, 5 or 30 jumps outs...nobody knows (except the wh’s who had that shit mapped out 2 minutes after the last static crashed)
---
&gt;Unironically playing the wormholer btw card
---
It's part legacy naming from _years_ ago. Back then, all prop mods were 1, 10, or 100MN. Even microwarp drives.
---
Then CCP renamed the MWDs to help make the difference between them more clear.
---
If you look at the stats (and don't count skills, or ship mass), the increase to your top speed is approximately;
---
 * 100% for Afterburners,
---
 * 500% for MWDs.
---
No, you rat anomalies, the sites you don't need to scan in your VNI. you explore in a frigate usually, unless you are looking for DED sites. Some scanable sites can be run in a VNI, but most of them aren't as you want either a smaller ship that can enter lower class ones, or a bigger ship that can run the highest level ones safely and efficiently. VNI ratting is something you do as a member of a NS corporation, and is generally the introductory method to ratting in NS.  
---
 Exploration is best done in either NS or WHs as they have the most profitable relic sties by far. In null you will get sites form only one faction per region so you have greater control of what you get, but the best regions, such as Stain,  tend to be camped. WHs spawn sites from every faction as well as sleeper sites. The sleeper sites are secretly combat sites though so as an explorer you ignore them. Both areas have their unique dangers but you can explore safely in both areas, they just require slightly different skill sets.
---

you dont need 2 gpus for that. in fact 2 display ports are enough

SAD!
---
If all they are doing is accepting contracts and passing them on to your hauler then they don't actually need any skills. It you want them to also be useful for your freighter then training them into a hyena to use as a webbing alt is a good idea. They would preferably be in the same corp as your freighter with friendly fire turned on so you don't need to worry about duel requests though, and that kinda defeats the point of a separate character to accept contracts. A cyno alt is also necessary if you want to run a JF, and more alts means less time re-positioning cynos. To that end training into an interceptor is also a good idea, both for a nullified cyno as well as giving you a way to get to contract quicker to accept them in the first place. The skills you are thinking of are mostly for a station trading alt and not a contract alt.

No. It is not summer yet and this onset starts around June usually.
---
Scrub. Real miners used a domi
---
The more it gets brought up the more likely it's going to get looked at this decade
---
xenuria is already running this year, we dont need another one
---
Buzzard man myself, but we can certainly agree on the Helios being really uncomfortable to look at.  The top-heavy peg leg design needs a reboot.
---
Hopefully not the "feature" of it spying on you and reporting what you say to an endless string of advertisers and three-letter agencies.
---
You have to maintain range, lock, etc for 1.5 minutes to match damage to the battlecruiser, the ship has no tank bonus aside from the T2 profile which is less than almost every other HAC, and without the pg bonuses will barely be able to make use of its utility highs. You can seriously kite it out with a Caracal because its so slow. It also has an ass capacitor strength compared to every other HAC as it only has a cap pool bonus instead of a recharge time bonus, meaning batteries do very little to make it tick. The improvements it needs are soft improvements, such as changing its raw damage bonus to a rate of fire bonus to reduce the time needed to spool up, and a about a 10-15% speed increase so it can actually make use of its range bonus.
---
As far as "compared to other ships in the game", the plan is for the HAC to cost somewhere around 600 mil. It takes something like 100 seconds to match the damage of a talos, and 130 seconds to match the total damage output across that time. And if you ever stop cycling for any reason, that counter is reset and now you have the damage output of a thorax again. With its current stats, it ain't worth more than a leshak.

Looking at the killmarks on your ship. Seems to be a death sentence for me.

Vote for Steve Ronuken in the Council of Stellar Management election because he's actually a very good and well thought out man, and he's always been honest and has put his trust in the community and the community trusts him
---
You' re not crazy. There once was an economist on their team. But not anymore.
---
Yes, we have a lot of bots here in Doomheim indeed.
---
I just like watching them get dirty. It's a neat little effect and it adds character to my ships.
---
That doesn't make you wormholers. It makes you the EVE equivalent of pigeons.
---
When i fit a brand new ship, i either loose it under 3 hours or it live for more than a month!

Every time i loose a ship, if i keep playing, i will loose 2 more.

If I kill a hauler solo it will be empty, if I dont join the fleet going out they will kill carriers, marauders and possibly a super.
---
toxic
---
/u/dumbdwarf reprimand him please
---
Ok, I'm sure it can still be botted, but there should be a possibility of getting caught and dying, and it should be scaled so that is not so easily done with an alpha clone in a cheap ship. There are things that can be done to make it more difficult and risky.
---
Because gallente are the most popular faction that newbies will train into.
---
Rapid heavies or go home.
---
RHML Phoon is an absolute monster and can spew out 1,100 dps with heat. No cruiser can survive it but the tankiest ones.
---
You mean just the PLEX? What else is inflating?
---
1) PLEX supply is either static or decreasing. PLEX demand is ever-increasing with people getting into more alts.
---
2) People have lots of ISK to buy PLEX low and sell high. They manipulate the market.
---
3) ISK is being pumped in the game, and not removed.
---
IDK if this is the specific case, but heres at least [one example](https://blog.codinghorror.com/of-spaces-underscores-and-dashes/)
---
INIT technically didn't do anything "wrong" it was just a bullshit game mechanic that needs to change that they took advantage of. Mass tanking the Doomsday. Shitadels are nowhere near as dangerous as they should be. All it takes is for the community to recognize this, and say together that "This is kinda bullshit and needs to change". That way such nonsense tricks can't be used in the future.

The part of my campaign platform I am most proud of is my suggestion for a new ground up Bounty Hunting system, which I partially describe here: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ezekiel-amann-for-csm-14-wormhole-space/157829

Would be nice to have Bounty Hunting to be a full time career you could engage in any Timezone 24/7. And be able to make a living at it as well as gain new skins, ships, powers , influence. Etc.
---
The best thing here is that he lost this AT ship because "no AT this year". He steal TRI AT reward and instead of share it with team members just waste AT ship.
---
I wasn't in AT team, but later I tried to ask Anveri where is AT reward because team members except few said they got only skins. Initially he said that AT ships are not selling those days, but when we asked how many AT ships left and where and may be just share them between members Anveri didn't reply at all.

 **Piloting a minmatar spaceship is like**  
---
walking a tightrope. For instance, when you take part in a training exercise like a jump training exercise, the jump is always a tricky maneuver. You can't be certain how you will go off route in your jump. Sometimes you are just going to die, because there is no way to predict your jump.  
---
This is a challenge for pilots who are in the field during most of the morning, when they have to navigate through a big amount of smoke and dust. They sometimes have to go at an extremely slow speed to avoid all the debris from exploding as they fly. Another challenge is that you often are out of the system as soon as you land, as soon as you land at a station you cannot see, the way you can on a flight simulator.
---
My main ones are it's bad luck to rename and Bob always enjoys a sacrifice in some form or another....it usually being the most recent person to join corp
---
.....but the sacrifice cannot be pre planned. It must be spontaneous and in the moment as all things are in bobs domain
---
Glad to see I'm not alone.  I know its a long shot since you basically have to design essentially an in game ESI all over again
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Wormholes. The content is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the PVP will go over a typical nullbear's head. There's also a wormholer's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from eve university literature, for instance. The wormholers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this content, to realise that they're not just amazing- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Wormholes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the content in a wormholer's existential catchphrase "Praise bob," which itself is a cryptic reference to Wormholeing. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a wormholer's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a N770 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Wormholerbtw

Both my minokawa and chimera were insured two or three times, 2 and a half years ago. I've just accepted they will never die.

Yeh works a treat could have just been my luck for the week but find I get more fights in other faction frigates i.e firetail and vigil fleet althought mabye thats cause people think they are weaker.

Do u know any koreans botting in eve?

As a korean, im confident to say we have strong anti botting or hack culture in any games. 
---
But i wish to know if u actual know some koreab or some korean alliance botting in eve.
---
Im not involved in any korean society so im not taking side here, just curious.
---
Cruise has a bit more dps when factoring reload time. And you get the range. I can agree that it is hardly worth it for the range and slightly more consistent raw dps, i just like to switch it up a bit and using resebo alt makes me able to shoot at 120km+ if i wanted. I prefer Typhoon fleet or barghest for rapid heavies, since the t1 typhoon lacks a bit in the clip damage pool having only the rate of fire bonus.
---
tbh given the weight of the ships most of them are unbelievably maneuverable as is, the stresses parts of the ship must experience during rotation are unbelievable
---
Could have been a nice kill! Had to try.   
---
if you mean the drekavac, the drekavac had t2 tank rigs+ faction eanms and 2 deadspace reppers :v
---
When the corp I was in at the time moved out of LowSec I decided to burn some of my ships. One was a Keres.    
---
I warped around a bit until I found a Thrasher in a small plex. Most likely a arty fit, but I should survive one volley. So I jump in. He sits at zero, autocannons =( I overheat MWD and luckily get out of scram range. Point, damp and he can't do anything anymore.    
---
Now that thing had about 40 dps. Around the time he was in low shield he ejected his pod and warped of. The kill took ages but was one of the most fun I had in FW.
---
Considering it also serves as a quick way to access info on who is buying out your shit on market... its not just about the ISK.
---
Or the inverse, watching your wallet for buy order activity so if any high priority orders get fulfilled you move on it in a timely manner.
---
And for the scammer crowd, quick access to the name of the one who just got hosed.
---
More like /r/ComedyCrematorium

I recently returned to the game thanks to Evesterdam being to much fun (screw you people). This new default Neocom legit pissed me off and I couldn't find jack shit at first cuz I was so used to the old one.
---
I'm a nullbear and spend time fighting wh people, when their wh pops in our region
---
MWD also reduce your max capacitor making it even harder to get them cap stable.
---
What we need is the option to have coloured neocom icons rather than the monochrome shite we have now. Remember when you could quickly glance at the neocom and click the green thing for fitting? I'm constantly clicking on the wrong thing now or spending a second or two trying to find the button I want
---
No one has suggested CCP start requiring that and absolutely no one was asking for an argumentum ad absurdum like the CEO and Directors being banned. /u/cornak mentioned this, as far as I understand, mostly as an additional peer-pressured way to act. If we, the players, start doing this in a way that at least tries to keep our own backyards clear we can at least say we are doing everything we can and let CCP focus on the stuff we can't solve.
---
My solo roam ships used to always be named like the opposite of what they are fitted like, so my incurses would always be named, kiting etc.

I've felt bad the past little bit for what I said about Stryker and I'd like to apologise. I kind of feel like an asshole, it was a moment of reactionary anger. It was wrong to say even those true things. It's still a touchy subject with me because of how pathologically dedicated I was to Stryker's success, I mean I was literally looking for a tattoo artist at one point to give my a Stryker emblem on my shoulder, and only put it off because funds were tight at the time. I tried so many times to bring my thoughts forward and get people moving in a productive direction but it was like herding cats. It took a long while for me to realize my ideas just weren't wanted, and upon that realization I actually sunk into a depression and began medicating. The final blow to my resolve came when Amarrahh left, he and I went way back to Domus Meridian in 2009 and he originally recruited me to Stryker. I poured all my waking energy into recruitment for 2 years for Stryker, and you guys have every right to be pissed off at me for leaving. 
---
So I apologize, even if this means another -23 Karma over all. And yes, tell Nobu I miss you guys. Sinner's gave me a place to sink into a F1 Monkey role and recharge for a while. Lee is also a damn good boss and knows his shit. I've learned a lot flying with him, especially that fight were I got my ass stomped by Chessur.

I just want to see quality candidates come forward for wormhole space, and apply pressure with my small following to make them even higher quality. I don't expect to win, but not all fights need to be won to have the desired effect.

You click on a cog next to an account in the launcher. Click manage profile, in there you can do all sorts of things, including selecting a single profile for all, duplicating profiles etc.
---
I have 3 computers using Mouse Without Borders and depending on what I plan to do, I like certain accounts on certain (yet varying) computers with certain (yet varying) layouts as well. All can be done within launcher. Your escape menu options don't come across though, but that's not much effort to sort out.
---
Personally I never had much issue with any of the launchers but I'm struggling to get myself excited about the notion that I reliably open a computer game I pay £30/month for.
---
Spod is god.
---
Yes.
---
Mostly true. Mostly.
---
Most of the time cloak+mwd will let you get around in lowsec without getting caught.
---
... And then you'll get caught by a carrier, which can decloak you while you're aligning with its fighters, and paired with a scripted HIC, you can't escape unless you can get back to the gate.
---
I don't do many lowsec contracts anymore, I got lucky four or five times in different places then ran my luck out and died. I wasn't even hauling anything that time.
---
A long, long time ago [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIxkLHYteeU) was a thing. Now people are are too lazy to calculate how much it costs them to have someone else transport their stuff around.

use the restrained ones. or gist-x types. if you wanna not loose max cap
---
I found some pics of myself here -  [https://rbkgames.com/articles/eve-invasion-world-tour/](https://rbkgames.com/articles/eve-invasion-world-tour/)  an article is on Russian, but you can watch the gallery.
---
Not an argument. Your alliance leader literally encouraged members to break one of the few rules of EVE.
---
tldr:
---
* Things increasing PLEX demand: 
---
   * Rorq/VNI alts
---
   * Skill farming/injecting
---
   * New Eden Store
---
   * Speculation
---
   * Market manipulation
---
* Things decreasing PLEX supply: 
---
   * Less players buying plex from CCP for $
---
      * Easy to earn ISK in-game now
---
      * Players quitting / drawing down their savings rather than investing more $ (maybe)
---
   * Speculation (hoarding PLEX)
---
My original word vomit:
---
I (and many others) used to fund myself by buying PLEX from CCP and selling it on the market. This increased supply of PLEX in game, and filled buy orders, suppressing the price. Now I fund myself by skill farming, either accounts paid for with money or plexed/MCTed. This consumes PLEX. PLEX is also used to buy skill extractors. Skill farming consumes a huge amount of PLEX.
---
And not only that, it is vastly easier for normies to make money in this game now. They do not need to buy PLEX from CCP to supplement their income. While at the same time paying for their alts with PLEX. Reducing supply, increasing demand. 
---
Rorq alts/VNI alts - generate ISK, consume PLEX, consume skill injectors (which are made in part from plex).
---
The New Eden Store. Consumes PLEX. This was the same when Aurum was used, as it was a straight PLEX -&gt; Aurum conversion. However, there is now a huge amount more to buy in the NES.
---
PLEX has been such a great investment over the history of EVE. Now the ISK faucet is fully open, players need somewhere to park their money. Most consider PLEX the best way to do this.
---
If you have been there already, I'd suggest the /r/buildapc subreddit or the discord at https://www.discord.gg/buildapc they'll be able to help you there (If you want to tag me I can also give you a hand).

---
The Loki does everything as well or better compared to the other 3 Strat cruisers. 
---
The Proteus got hit the hardest in the T3 rebalance, it lost the ability to fit a massive brick tank while cloaked. A meta shift away from keep at 0 brawling also helped to remove it's relevance, although that happened prior to the rebalance.
---
Fresh wreck on the first gate into a lowsec exploration trip? Take a different route instead.

Most of my ships are uninsured too.

During the mythical time when NPC null wasn’t worthless :(

I have the full skills for a Loki... I guess I’ll take one
---
For the 5MN it's still -20% for the restrained (from 25) and the Gistii MWD range from 70 to 130M in Price.
---
If you get unlucky and jump through a K162 with an SB Prot on the other side they can save your sorry ass.
---
What about Skiffs?
---
if you can use OCS to get the mission title, you know what you are up against. You can then script a refit and a change in strategy.
---
However there is an Economics Council that has various Devs from different teams involved to discuss and monitor this stuff
---
I imagine that the *real work* CCP Security does is figuring out the worst botting offenders and banning *them*, and letting the distribution bots run for a little longer, collecting that sweet, sweet sub money for, like... 5mil isk/hr.
---
Alpha VNI bots can be banned with impunity, given that no money goes to CCP and they are actively damaging the game economy due to RMT.
---
Every time I rename a ship it dies in a dumb way.

Well on pure access logs you're right, but don't forget that via Javascript (or any other technology) you can get much more data (including Mac, screen resolution, virtually any data) and collect it with a simple http post.
---
That's why is crazy that CCP did not use that data to identify physical hosts which is used for botting.
---
Ok you can spoof you Mac address, but a combination of screen res, video card model, mobo model, bios version, storage devices with their firmware etc etc... gives you a very precise identification of a host, and for getting those data you only need superuser access, and you can ask the user to run the launcher with those grants.
---
That's why is false that CCP is doing anything to fight botting, the tools are available, they need the will to use them.
---
Guess I'm in support of adding local in W-Space now.
---
That's a nice portfolio to have. Good job! And in capturing the vibe of the game as well

You are damn right.

I'm against this. The Reason why is because it (together with other similar additions) would overcomplicate the Menues to extreme levels so it would be even harder for new players to get a grasp on eve.

I think you need high shaders for it to show. Then you have a clean ship button under SKINs (instant in space, needs session change when docked).

In some of the fights I do, in some I don´t.

Really depends of the fight.

I prefer to click them in situations where getting them up quickly doesn´t matter, such as brawling in noprop destroyers or whatever, but if I am trying to catch a Garmur or whatever then I will spam the crap out of the scram keybind like there´s no tomorrow.

If you try to bond a key already bound to something else you get a pop-up saying what it's currently bound to and asks you're sure you want to remap it

It’s annoying as fuck when you jump in and get a target on 5• but can’t warp to him (
---
My guess is that you are probably trying to get a ship to do something that it isnt meant to do. If you find that you are running into a problem with one ship ask around and you might find that there are other ships out there which would suit what you want better. If you linked the ship you are trying to fit and tell us reddit people what you are trying to do with it you will get a more specific answer. In the mean time I would look into any skills you could train which might aid you (specifically CPU and power grid related skills). Also look into implants. Those can be quiet handy as well

New Triglavian ship/station is how many times bigger then a titan?

Disagree, weird asymmetric designs are what makes eve's design really stand out.

Yeah symmetric ships look cool (new condor, basis, scorpion etc) but some asymmetry is important sometimes

Underrated comment, this

How can we know this won't break the in-game map and system info tab for instance, for months? Looks risky to me.

What I have seen it could be 50 times a titan..

I sincerely hope this does not happen. The last thing this game needs is another fucking tier of capital proliferation.

Bots + human players generating huge free isk faucets. It is very easy to generate isk out of thin air in Eve. On top of that rorquals begin OP made everything that is T1 to be super cheap to produce. This created huge supply of goods, driving prices and isk value down.

They can be cradled in the lap of a keepstar. So don't think 50 times is accurate.
---
&gt; What ammo do I load when I'm fighting x ship? I'm flying an x what kind of fights should I take?
---
I would suggest to breakdown the topic in a couple broad areas where learning just the basics for those areas will already be good. Keep it within frigates at first to make it simpler, and focus on the broad stuff, not the specifics first.
---
For example, i'd break it down that way: 
---
*how the different weapon categories work. You mainly got turrets vs. missiles vs. drones. Learn the fundamental differences between those, their advantages and drawbacks. Missiles always apply damage if they are in range, how is the damage impacted? Turrets have a chance to hit, what impacts that chance? Etc.
---
*The tank types. Passive vs. active, shield vs. armor, what's the big differences again.  Armor buffers slow you down, not shields, but shields make you easier to hit with an increased signature radius. What are the different native resistances for both types?
---
*Then maybe range. How range impacts fights, how you can control it, and why it's very important. Check the differences between Microwarpdrives and Afterburners, between Warp Disruptors and Warp Scramblers, what webifiers do?
---
I think it can help you understand this topic, help you find what fit you want to fly, what can your fit engage and what it should probably avoid. If you grasp the basics of these three types, then check the bonuses for a specific ship, you'll have a general idea of how it may be flown (since ships are pretty much always fitted to take advantage of their bonuses). This ship has bonuses to shield resistances? It probably has a shield tank. This one has projectile turrets optimal and rate of fire bonuses? Autocannons will be probable.
---
Then you can go and find some fights, e.g. in FW space. You'll more likely find 1v1, and if you go down don't hesitate to hit up your killer in a convo afterwards and ask for what went wrong in the fight. If you've already made your homework e.g. on the Eve Uni wiki, you'll have an easier time understanding a summary of the fight from the other perspective. The more you do this, the more you'll start to have a grasp of the interactions between all components of combat.

Nope, you have the right to dictate how your software should be used. Sure, if your freelance, maybe you have to "do what the client wants." My company, for example, sells an enterprise product, and clients agree to our conditions when purchasing and using our product. One of those is that our list of officially supported browsers, which does not include IE. A client may not submit a ticket asking we restructure our entire system to support IE - it would be rejected at tier 1.

---
Also consider the fact that there seems to be a mechanisms that severly impacts the extraction if you launch two successive extraction program on the same spot (i.e. without moving the extractor heads).
---
What works is to select the program, place your heads where you think they should be, then click start (but do *NOT* submit your change). When the program is primed (but the change not submitted yet), click again on the "Install Program" button, and you'll see the *updated* average extracted resources per hour. If it looks way worse than the estimate, stop the program and redesign it by moving your extractor heads elsewhere, rinse and repeat until you find a program that extracts enough.
---
They can't even handle - in the system search now, and you want to trust them with your isk coding that?
---
Years ago when i first ventured into a wh a buddy told me this. I found this to be a funny meme until a tengu decloaked 5km off me on my 3rd site. I assume there is a cloaky t3 lurking around in every wh eversince...
---
Thats why you have 37 accounts subbed. 30 of them are in some renter alliance or doing incursions.
---
Lol what. That’s not right at all. 
---
Hull tank is too slow. And not viable because sabres from a competent pilot will decloak you.
---
Shields aren’t viable because you’re getting rid of your scanning upgrades 🤦🏻‍♂️.
---
Your only options are nanos for speed and adaptives because a) the fit b) they don’t slow you down.
---
What happens when you need something around 200mn? You find a workaround, or get another ship. Modules and ships are balanced to offer distinct advantages and disadvantages and provide the player with impactful choices.

Do a CSM campaign poster for Itachi.

Remember when CCP discovered MWD cloaking was a bug by accidentally patching it away for a day or two? I wish they'd get back to fixing that.

they were in the game once but were removed
---
Spoken like a man who’s never used a cov ops offensively.
---
Don't think it was up to scale though, don't think the game engine then allowed something that ginormos
---
Yes, I know, but Iapetans aren't in the game anymore, buddy. CCP removed the, and for good reason. They haven't been mentioned in the lore since then. Safe to say that they have been retconned.

Yeah I agree, cruise phoon definitely has it’s place. 
---
It gets the dank application bonus and if you wedge a rigor on there it can hit quite nicely. Rapid heavies can be very frustrating against brick tanked ships like bcs or bs.
---
The fleet phoon is definitely more suitable for the rapid heavy setup and gets super dank double heavy neuts. Too bad the hull is 400mil. Can literally get 2 fully fitted phoons with a faction web for the price of the fleet phoon

In that case it's imperative that we get him on the CSM!

Based on reading this post all these comments from you so far. i cant tell if this is a troll, bait, if your sleep deprived or have some extreme spinoff of spodbrain. As You make no sense, you obviously dont play the game much or have wide understanding of it. You admited you dont have the time to go to summits, and dont seem to understand what the csm is for or dose. Your toxic to the community your trying to get elected to represent. If you keep acting like this theres 0 chance your going to get elected, you probaly have a better chance tweeting trump this thread and all your toxic logs and beg him for a political appointment in his administration.

Anything really, people who cover the current events going on, give tips and guides, do challenges, etc.
---
For instance, for Old School Runescape there's a few channels that will discuss their thoughts on the developer Q&amp;As every week. Some people will do challenge runs in the game where they see how long it takes them to get a subscription in game starting as f2p. They'll do challenges with "Ironman" accounts, etc. I'd love to see stuff like this for this game if it exists. Channels that cover the politics going on, or what they think the new updates are gonna bring. Do challenges to see how quickly they can make money with certain restrictions, stuff like that.

That's unfortunate. I assume you've tried reinstalling etc

You are right op,  and taking your missions to lvl 4 is something useful later on in the game. I d keep levelling standings until it gets boring then take a break and enlist is fw militia friendly with the empire you have standings for.

Last time i checked Delve had 2 boson titans on each gate.

Anytime i spend a lot on ship fittings to make a "pimp" fit, i make dumb mistakes and die in a fire. So i just fit everything cheap now.

I’m sure they have a team or something that looks at it. But all they can really do is manipulate the faucets. Offer plex sales, change anomaly spawn rates maybe. But no matter what they do they don’t have a way to remove isk from the game other than banning people. So the above is still true.

Inb4 goons troll him and drop a bunch of ratting Hels instead of titans.
---
80% of the fun in Eve is in solving this puzzle - what to fit, how to fit, how to workaround limitations/requirements. It’s a bit like building a Magic deck I guess.
---
First titan I saw was the one bridging us and someone in fleet said "which one is the titan"
---
I'll take "What's the region between Period Basis and Aridia" for $20 RMT'd money
---
That in itself is a complex situation; are you locked to a damage type or flexible.  Do you need to account for range and/or tracking.  Do you even have enough DPS with your chosen ammo to break the tank of what you're shooting.  Do you need to compensate for positioning or are you planning to manoeuvre into optimal range for that ammo type.  What about reload times.  When do you heat and when is it a waste of time. Oh and whats the best type to use for the hull you're shooting.
---
You're making some of these decisions as you find a target on your d-scan and may already be en-route, so think quick!  Good luck!
---
Some advice though, I don't really agree with the fit 100 rifters and go lose them approach unless you're the type that is going to be able to learn without getting disheartened.  I do think that positioning and range control teaches a lot more, because they give you both the time and space (duh) that lets you experiment with what works and doesn't, more so than fully committing to what could be a series of fruitless brawls that last 20 seconds will. 
---
tl;dr: Go fly tackle for a small gang focused group and learn to survive outnumbered and stay on-grid, then worry about how to melt face once you have that dialed in.
---
I definitely get something like this, I always make sure to close the launcher when I have started launching the clients. It quite often jumps up to use more cpu than 1-2 client for a while.
---
Pretty easy workaround, so it really doesn't matter to me.
---
that has nothing to do with what we're talking about tho, that's an url issue, and one that can be fixed quite easily really, its just not "fixed" in that situation because its not "wrong", just an unexpected standard.
---
also regexes are not programming languages and if they're relying on regexes that can't be tinkered with for some reason there's an even simpler solution of fiktering the input before sending to the regex.

"I recommend joining a group that just happens to be my group"

Come on man.

But is it easier to script than an 23/7 infinitly available Minigame with quite simple if-then trees, that needs no change in strategy ever ? That was the issue.
---
fun fact:
---
- The Mission title is the same for ALL Burners and Team Burners (Anomic Agent/Anomic Team) so it wont help you anything.
---
delve delve delve delve delve delve delve delve delve delve
---
there aren't really challenges like that in eve per se
---
there's new eden report that started recently and does a pretty good job covering current events
---
suitonia's channel eve is easy is probably the definitive "how to not suck at pvp" youtube channel

Acceleration vectors don't really work in EVE though as you don't have perpetual motion, or reverse thrusters to bring the ships to a halt, though.
---
I guess an element of fiction had to play into there somewhere!
---
Well hello Governor Northrom.
---
I have been frequently having this issue too. Annoying to deal with, but glad that there is an easy way to fix it.
---
Yes pi can easily make two bil per account per month (assuming your using all three chat slots, which you should always) if your multiboxing or dual subbed can squeeze out more profits but not really. STAY LIQUID, pi is a bitch to move in a hurry. 
---
I usually do 4 p0-p1 planets and a fifth doing p3. Easy to manage, low maintenance and runs 24/7 assuming I cycle and move stuff every two or three days. Good luck and dm me if u have further more elaborate questions or need explanation.
---
&gt;But is it easier to script than a 23/7 infinitly available Minigame with quite simple if-then trees, that needs no change in strategy ever ? That was the issue.
---
It would be easier to just script a minigame with then/if trees, as you said, but a L4 mission bot that includes burner support would be significantly lower-risk, would blend in with other (maybe legit) missioners, and also would be more consistent. Of course, that's not to say botting is OK (it isn't) but making one would certainly be a learning experience.
---
I miss the days I used to sit on the Lanngisi undock with a Catalyst swarm. AFK Marauders were tasty kills.
---
&gt;fun fact: - The Mission title is the same for ALL Burners and Team Burners (Anomic Agent/Anomic Base/Anomic Team) so it wont help you anything in deciding fitting and strategy.
---
Hmm, now that I think back to when I used to run them, you're right. Doesn't it say it in the description, though? you could just parse that through any potential bot.

First time I saw a titan was at Amarr Empire Family station :p
---
We don't mine often, belts are small and you are just easy prey, train Triglavians and T2, T3 Cruisers
---
I find it easier to move PI goods if you can integrate your PI chain into an industry chain. You can make some of the harder to buy items ""for free"", and then turn those into T2 items (etc) that would move faster.
---
Is the wreck of Steve in is original size when titans were even bigger?
---
This is the only good suggestion in this whole thread
---
It's really that hard to put an extra letter on the system search?
---
It's really that hard to unbind the key before rebinding it?
---
It's really that hard to look at the map for and not the route for jump bridges?
---
It's really that hard to overheat again after decycling heated modules?
---
The bar for qol changes is not if it's hard to do or not, it's about removing unnecessary menial work.
---
Any casio calculator wl be sufficient enough.
---
You should land within jump range and be able to leave before the proteus can burn over, because it can't sb at 0
---
Unless it's at a distance where it can hit you, but not the wh, in which case lmao that's unlucky. Never seen it happen tho, so not gonna stress about it.
---
Yes it's worth doing. I had pocos in w space for about 4 years and people don't attack them because they can't use caps. Clear any pre-existing pocos with semi-afk cheap Oracles and accept losing a few. (Or you can use them as bait to ambush people).
---
HS  static makes exporting the goo really safe.
---
Spoken like a man who doesn't fly virtues and spends more time in an enyo than in a pvp ship
---
Actually i dont think anyone is going to drop a titan on him in a frigate in delve, that said he should have a big enough chance finding one there just by a random gate.
---
Good, good.  
---
MOAR
---
&gt; but a L4 mission bot that includes burner support would be significantly lower-risk
---
I agree with you for Hisec L4 missions, but thats why I said in comment on top of chain that Bots use to reside in Hisec or Nullsec, not so much in Lowsec (except FW-Bots) and that Burners in Lowsec (the profitable ones with 19000+ LP per Mission) are much harder to script than a 5-clicks-per-site-VNI or a single task exploration bot. Also I brought up the issue that botting in Lowsec often is too risky, as we lowsec dwellers have enough autism to kill them. I am running Burners since their introduction now, and I have NEVER seen a bot do this. There are people that use multiboxes that MAYBE input broadcast them idk, but botting? No.
---
when a wh player goes to null the average IQ goes up for both
---
you mean, people still live in lowsec? it's a ghost town out there
---
by far the best path to take after those is another game, cause this one's pretty shit.
---
I couldn't do this if I tried but I do hope i'll get there from here somewhere which reminds me of:
---
**... the old joke about a foreign tourist stopping to ask a farmworker for directions in a small village in the middle of Ireland. “Where are you going?” asks the farmworker. The tourist tells him and the man scratches his head. “Oh, in that case I wouldn’t start from here if I were you…”**

I have a Nestor I bought a week after it was released... It hasn't been cleaned once. It's been jumped in pve 10+ times, I've done suicide logi with it, I've dropped it into pvp situations outnumbered 3:1...it is now basically grey black from dirt. It will never get cleaned.
---
yes you do. set destination to 1DQ and enjoy the ride :)
---
the thing that would be big enough to distract concord from Jita is the same thing that would fucking crash the economy
---
that's like causing an alien invasion so you can safely rob a bank... there's a lot more at stake than some people's pocket change lmao
---
I live in NPC-Nullsec and Lowsec since close to 10 years now (with a 1-yr-break to attend WWB). People thinking that only ghosts live in this regions netted us a lot of Titan/Super/Cap-Kills ;-) ...
---
annoying agency button that everyone removes &gt; wallet
---
I did not say they were, I am merely taking exception to the blanket statement by the OP that basically read "duh, bots could not have helped us build our super cap fleet so quickly because super caps used ore not isk!"
---
There is a significant hole in that logic, that hole being rorquals and barges are botted all the time.
---
If i undock with more than 100m in cargo, Tornados will spawn.
---
how do you make your isk?
---
You'd be wrong
---
Pi absolutely worth doing. Mining the moons, Not so much. Unless you guys are heavy into indy imho you may as well mine hs moons they are the same
---
Gods aren't real (and neither is the primary one worshiped on Iceland--the sky lord Jesus). Just saying. 
---
Also, you say this, but your thread title contains the statement "fuck all Nullbears." Tacitly implying how l337 WHers feel they are.
---
Titan on a gate? Common view in Hisec (Delve is Hisec)
---
I am pretty sure the wallet was on the Neocom when I signed up. Probably got removed by mistake.
---
Apparently they used to have colour as well.
---
No ship is too small for a good'ol titan drop. 
---
As most of them are only for ratting nowadays anyway.
---
Every killmark counts.
---
Krabland oh sorry delve, where elite titan pilots camp cloaked gates, even alone you should be able to trigger them ^^

My Raven was equipped with the following:
---
* Stacking penalties
---
I can \_HEAR\_ VCR noises and coil whine when I look at these.
---
Burners (with 1 DPS char and 3 add. pullers) give you ISK/hr like dualboxing 2 Supercarriers in Havens ... when pullers are on decline cooldown Clonesoldier Tags give you 20-30 Mio. ISK per unit, when going through a full 0.1 constellation you can find more than 10 in an hour plus the occasional Mordus spawn, chaining belts in an 0.1 10belts+ system gives close to VNI Ticks ... there is plenty of stuff ...
---
We always find fight when our CEO just went AFK, and he usualy come back literaly seconds after it's ended.  
---
Now, when we are waiting, cloacked, than someone bite in our bait, we ask sometime : "humm boss? don't you need to afk or something? "
---
Didnt they remove clone soldier tags with the post-dust514 update?
---
rakapas
---
Stacking penalties to damage mods were introduced in late 2004 iirc.
---
Speaking of ravens... Cavalry ravens with 2x mwds, that outran their own torps so the torps all balled up and landed on the target at the same time!
---
...I’ll be in my bunk
---
no, just sold some from 0.2 systems for 27 Mil ISK per piece last week
---
Nice.
---
Yeah any good exlpo hunter will ram you, good luck cloaking.
---
I think this guy is a cyno frig trying to bait, his meme is strong 💪
---
Delve would be my suggestion.
---
No one has ever owned an OG titan.
---
And the pilot is using a cheap garbo skin.
---
Drekavak, as "t1" battlecruisers go, is not balanced lol. I am not surprised you bounced, and I think the only reason people aren't more pissed about the Drek is that the Kiki is an order of magnitude worse.
---
Clearly you do not live in Delve, where 1 in 4 ships in space at any given time are Titans. 2 out of the other 3 are supers.
---
So we should ignore information about how to save ships from not good hunters?
---
You're also assuming the hunter doesn't mess up with it's bump.  And even if they don't, you still hit the cloak which delays their lock, giving you a little bit more time to try and get off before they can lock you.
---
Yeah, it's not perfect, but still better advice then letting explorers sit at 0 on a can.
---
&gt;ship/station is how many times bigger then a titan?
---
Oh yes, moar cap ships please. I so love 3 year long skill plans.
---
Can you make something cool based off this?  http://imgur.com/gallery/1OIBR4T
---
PI definitively worth it, if you have a good planet setup.  
---
and no one care about bashing your poco, unless you are already fully evicted and someone esle want to live in this hole.  
---
Bashing and remplacing the poco you already have is the dangeriest moment. better to try to buy them from the precedent ownner.
---
hmmm, I might give it a try then. With a pvp fit, of course ;)
---
Just in case no one mentioned it, Delve.
---
Lets make the RL job of having an Corporation/Alliance even more difficult. I like that idea
---
If you run a game you accept responsibility for what the players do then... right? :)
---
Best ship in the game? why whatever ship I'm currently flying of course. Modesty lvl 5 btw
---
I gave my recommendation of a small group and then gave the one I'm a part of as an example. If that makes you salty, that's your problem?
---
Maybe delve. Or fake querious
---
You are the kind of poor who can't afford fuel. Id drop my titan on a pod tbh
---
Fastest subwarp speed record was achieved in a Gold Magnate?  [http://i.imgur.com/O0G9vpj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O0G9vpj.jpg)   
---
Smallest sig is a pod.
---
You might want to be more spefic.. As frigs or cap will take up half those slots if your not specific.
---
Fastest is frigs.
---
Fastest warp would be the angel frig 
---
Dps dmg would be vindicator or titans? Again depends what your shooting at.. Leshack is there somewhere
---
Slot amount will be on a bs or higher. Same with fitting room. So cpu pg.
---
Shield/arm/hull is titans.. So again be spefic what class are you asking about?
---
Resists would probably be t3 cruisers or a t2 of some kind marauders come to mind
---
Cargo cap.. Uh industrial ships? Lol freighter? Lol if you mean combat ships then again caps and bs's
---
Drone bay/ore hold goes to rorqual 
---
Smallest sig is capsule lol or frigs if you count ships. Largest is caps duh.
---
Most locks is logistics and carriers with NSA 
---
Heat efh is t3 cruisers with max thermodynamics.
---
Largest lockrange is like 300km before carrier NSAs
---
I think that answers your questions altho I doubt I have to your satisfaction so again be specific.
---
Can you get into some big ass corp/alliance and be just a good ol rank and file player if you are a lazy ass like me and don´t wanna do the ol online striptease for spaceship strangers?
---
It helps to be aware that your actions make people salty.
---
Sure, just gotta have patience and find the right group. You may want to pursue alternate forms of joining groups, such as making friends first and then joining later.
---
or you can toggle your skin off and on after you press clean ship, that does it too
---
hehe guess im just lazy
---
Unintended consequence of citadels being anchorable near stars.
---
Not sure how up-to-date this is, but someone gathered all of the base stats for all the ships in the game into a giant table at some point, you can find it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fdTlaYr75YjZgqlPho3xxBM7GYDBMGw3HeyJ8U_BmkU/edit?usp=sharing
---
It also allows filtering for different ship classes, sizes etc.
---
pacifier is slightly the fastest warping ship in the game actually i think
---
&gt; if you are a lazy ass like me
---
sure
---
&gt; and don´t wanna do the ol online striptease for spaceship strangers
---
pass
---
Okay, I'm going in. Anyone want an update on what happens on my trip to 1DQ?
---
Good. I need more electrolytes.
---
&gt;'t work. PH (or any alliance really) could be destroyed within the month.... Put obvious botting alts in and run them 23/7. Get banned, rinse and repea
---
And so the EVE Online BOT Wars have begun. Within 6 months of this change, CCP discovered that there were no more null sec alliances left in the game, and 2/3rds of the players were once more in NPC corps.
---
Can give some fun, I once did Belts and Covert Research Facilities in Genesis with my Asklepian-Set-2k dps tank Deimos. Some guys spotted me, set up a camp with 2 legions + 1 Proteus + 1 Vindicator next system. I baittanked them on 1.5 reppers without drugs for a few minutes until a cyno was moved and we dropped them with the formup for a tower bash (4 Carriers). Gave some nice 3 Bil in Killmails and 1 Bil in Loot, definitely the best spawn on that trip XD
---
Can I run tier 5 abyssal sites in a T2 gila? Or do I need to fill it up with shiny deadspace/officer modules first? The price of some of the T5 gilas I've seen is fairly prohibitive for me. Also, are chaotic sites harder than raging sites? Since the range of effect intensity can go as low as 50%, I'm not sure if they have the potential to be easier (or harder) than tier 4 sites.
---
PI depends on your planets but its mostly worth it.
---
You should try delve
---
But isn’t the rush meant to be the fun of the game? So your playing because it’s fun? Pfffft!!!
---
Delve is SAFER than hisec.
---
There, FTFY.
---
resubbing all my 3 accounts for this
---
Delve.
---
Pls let this be a fakepost by snuff, making goons rain Titans on everyone-hoping for some dank kills in delve
---
That's the point, CCP developers are far removed from this game and continually ignore major community feedback about features that eventually get fixed cause they were broken like everyone said.
---
That is the new form of "insurance fraud" - getting frauded into not necessary insurance ...

I've laid down some prophecy cards in front of me. I can tell that you're going to get bosoned on a gate.

---
Damn that shit is happening so often ...
---
Why should you even be allowed to run for CSM after what you did?
---
You sir, are a genius. 
---
I have never noticed this similarity, but now when i see it, it is simply striking. :)
---
Great video! One thing I noticed vs the damavik that might be helpful for next time. It's no use trying to disrupt their tracking since it's insanely high, but their range is very sensitive since their ramp stops if you go out of range. 
---
So maybe you would've fared better if you could've gotten his gun to turn off due to being out of range? Not sure what the range is for him when tracking disrupted...
---
&gt; ill forget and fly a dictor.
---
Well if in Lowsec I can't see the problem ;-)
---
death to otws
---
I`m gay :(
---
My solution to this problem is not to do exploration if there's a neut in local, and not to do it at all in WH. :p.
---
Sure, but we all know you're going to die.
---
If your in-game handle is the same as on Reddit, you'll be bosoned by the first person who sees your name pop up on intel.
---
Dont ask if there is neutrals/gankers around or praise they are not there. Just casually ask how the "weather" is in the region...
---
Thanks for the recommendations! I'll be sure to check them out. Do you know of any people that focus on market stuff?
---
This should really, really be a thing.
---
Maybe this is the solution to populate Lowsec again ... someone should write a bot changing themes ... wait ... nvm ....
---
Why we cannot have ingame map looking like dotlan.        
---
For sure dotlan is not fancy and shiny ... but it is readable and usable.
---
No thanks. That's retarded
---
But where do i get my water filters from now?!
---
Oï !
---
You could technically run it with a T2 Gila, but you’ll need perfect skills, ship and module management to be honest. And you might lack the tank to survive every spawn, or the DPS to take out some others, which mean you’ll often die.
---
And of course, as the last tier, Chaotic filaments are WAY harder than Raging. You probably saw the percentage on the EVE University page, but I don’t think it’s accurate. And even if it is, the spawn you get in T5 are extremely hard, way more than the ones in Raging.
---
I was more replying individually to the poster above me, but I agree that asymmetry can work well (even when it's subtle, like on the Manticore).  I just don't like the Helios overall and symm/asymm won't fix it. Just needs a new design imo.
---
as I told you I'am gay
---
Now that dank
---
Yeah let's all feed the owners with data of where all our miners are and if their currently active! 
---
Do you plan on releasing the source so people can host this themselves?
---
Yes, PI can make good ISK in WH space. In fact, most C1s are nothing but PI farms since the anoms are nearly worthless.  
---
Make sure you get a set of decent planets.  A Lava or Plasma planet helps so that you can make Robotics / Mechanical parts and can make fuel blocks yourself.
---
Let me tell about the time i fit up an 800m loki (before t3 changes). Flew to lowsec, say a retriever on scan, went "time to ice this guy". Shoot him and then get concordded, since i was in a .5 and not the lowsec system i thought i was in.

---
\&gt;he thinks he can make 150m/week with highsec PI
---
*wheeze*
---
Yeah idk whats the problem, also its not like that every day dunno whats going on tbh
---
I hope they fix that. I already reported it as a bug, but that means nothing -_-
---
I’ve seen TEST Prepare for a capital op, never seen so many in my life, I’m happy to post the pic if asked
---
&gt; Friendly reminder that when you see someone getting injured on the street, you just ignore them and don't do anything to help at all or even bother calling 911, because that is literally the paramedics job and why you fucking pay taxes.
---
Yes. In today's society, i would be very much weigthing my options if i should even call someone. Better just turn and run before anyone notices me. About 50/50 that i would call someone form a safe distance.
---
You may want to have a look into low class wormholes: C1 holes for example can have an HS static and are uninhabited for the most part, but they're perfect for PI.
---
You can make 150m a week. You just have to go to low and need to use all three of your chars (assuming you have 1 account). If you want the highsec life (no shame), find a highsec system bordering a quiet lowsec system with a station. Put your alts in the station with some epithals and maybe a cloaky frig so you can check for camps on the lowsec side of the gate into your system. You'll be pretty save and you won't lose a lot when you do get caught. Refine to P2s and export them to highsec for transport. It won't be a ton of isk, but it's a living. It scales really well. You see epithals and blockade runners all over low doing this.
---
Best pr0n: http://f03n.smo83fhq.org/z1uh6hrk/
---
They discounted the cost of subbing with plex a few times recently from 500 to 485 plex i think?
---
This actually makes the problem worse not better because no one will buy more plex with real money; the price of plex will drift so that the new 485 plex costs the same as 500 before.
---
If you own your Poco on the factory planets I don't see why you couldn't buy mats and work them up for a profit, I think the scale of what you are thinking is something for a multiboxer
---
Wow.

Local is coming...
---
I dont :(
---
Go watch Goons prepare for one.
---
One unsuspecting combat site pops in The Forge and the army of gilas and jackdaws will immediately smell it. Poor little DED site.
---
Orbiting gives you a high chance of needing longer to align than sitting still and many sites have cans too close to some collidables to cloak.
---
&gt; rorquals and barges are botted all the time.
---
Honestly, Are they ?

Yeah, that’s what I did. I was in wormhole space from about June-September, then my school started back up and I didn’t have enough time to do anything, so I’m a casual in brave at the moment.
---
I sent a mail and a conversation request. My name is Iris Vae.
---
That or more like the komodo test lost in frat space. Bahahaha
---
That's fair.  There is also that spawn that puts two cans right beside each other. Or when they are all clustered together.  For those, I've noticed I'm usually not within range about 70-80% of the orbit and can cloak.  I should note, I always leave prop mod off during the hack.
---
If we are worried about align time, probably a keep at range of 2,250 meters would work as well, that way you are stationary. And that would protect you when you go to loot the can.
---
As a hunter, I generally try and tackle the explorer right after the can is hacked and they are moving in to loot it.  At this point, they are usually within 2 km of it and can't cloak and are also bumping off the can and have a horrible warp time.

The CSM shouldn't be represented by guy's who did good/bad things or are really popular in one community, a CSM Member for me should know how the game works and what the issues are, giving an community feedback of different stuffs like events or so and they should provide a important feedback with their game experience on new/actual game mechanics (like the fucking citadel mechanic and everyone know they fucked the game on a whole different level and dont get me started with the new JB).
---
This is very true, and I'm sad because of this. The old default neocom buttons had everything on there and I really loved them. CCPls
---
As long as you are careful when anchoring you structure and keep it fueled, no one will bother shooting it unless they really hate you.
---
P3 is good money and not to much of a hassle making or hauling, especially with a HS static. Just be aware that you HS static will attract the likes of me, who will want to use it to do some hauling and will gank anyone that may interfere with that.

This is the latest in a series of articles I've done about my time in Eve, starting back nearly three years ago. The series seemed to get a good receptions on its previous entries so I've put together this latest and potentially last one.
---
This one is quite a doozy, as most other entries were in increments of three months, and this one was closer to nine since the last.
---
I hope you guys enjoy!

First titan I saw was in a collection of rags, levis, and a Komodo or two during stratop on deployment. Tbh it was a little underwhelming. The first capital I ever saw (much cooler story) was a rev that was in a hole we rage rolled to. There was me, in an imicus plus two guys in scanning legions scanning out the hole, and I see a rev on dscan, so I track it down and see it’s on the exit hole. When I land it’s not there anymore, so I jumped through and it was reproaching the hole and combat rolled two ~3B t3cs out of our home. I actually thought it was a titan because of how big it was, until someone showed me the other capitals

Nayoke, it is always nice to seeing a Titan for the first time. The screenshot is beautiful.

Nope, There was once an event in which the Serpentis stole a Gallente Solteur and flew it back to serpentis prime.
---
The only thing with it was that it was only at the scale of a dread at the time.

It's not a bug tho, the whole UI is designed around it.

[Technically they were not Iaptian titan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4esi3a/should_ccp_bring_out_the_iapetan_titans_for_the/d22xero/)s, but normal sized titans[ that used the names of the Iaptians from the lore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4p5lya/back_in_the_day_an_event_was_held_where_the/d4ibz89/). Each race had multiple Titan hulls, and did [have models in the game](http://izlin.free.fr/eve/ships/soltueur.jpg), but the secondary ones were never available to the players.
---
And you didn't even fuckin' tackle it?  What's he gonna do against an Astero, *DoOmS DAy iT*?
---
On a serious note I've been playing **consistently** for only a few years (3 ish? 5 total), first Titan I saw was a bridging Titan when Brave moved a couple times before we got into Catch.  I can sit in a Titan now optimally, but I can't even afford one nor have I even been lucky enough to engage in combat with a Titan that isn't an NPC.  Feelsbadman

Hey, I've just drained into DST's, and have been toying with the idea of blockade running for fun. Do I just throw a ship together, take a contract, and get to it?
---
But gerrr goon bots
---
nemo_seagulls.gif
---
Hmmm isn't it funny how Tapi blued the Russians and started calling Frat botters. Don't get me wrong, pretty much everyone has egg on their faces, but this chart highlights a hell of a lot of hypocrites.
---
I'm sorry, I don't see Goonswarm on that list. What's the deal?
---
Funny, looks like Goonswarm Federation isn't on this list, nor is anyone with access to Delve for krab. PBLRD is, of course, but they don't have access to Delve. Neither does Initiative Associates. This puts to bed the idea that Delve is full of botters. Even if GSF has internal instructions not to report botters, it is one of the most trafficked areas of the game, as judging by the MER's destruction values. We can safely assume that any botters would have been reported, given everyone's lust for bot death.
---
Can we have a docker container to selfhost it? ^^
---
you could ask them in local. otherwise they most likely wont bother your pod.
---
I like either flying the rattlesnake or the raven. The raven cause it seems faster than the rattlesnake on warp and it just looks really cool. I shield tank mine and well missiles so I can kite out a bit. As far as the rattlesnake I feel it is good bait. I can haul tank the crap out of it. But have not been successful at tanking a 30 man fleet yet. However I love when I do get to bait tank able fights also set a sensor booster on it and you are good to go. Gate camp away.
---
Dude that sounds sweet as fuck. Gratz
---
Even though the Yulai incident bore its share of Goons?
---
I'd say that's a reasonable response except for (maybe) an Erebus. The others could easily look like structure rolled onto an unusual axis.
---
This is the last 600 bans, not all bans, for mouth breathers that don’t understand
---
Funniest thing I've seen since I resubbed in December involved a Titan. At an inpromptu gatecamp with some alliance mates - and already shaking my head in disbelief that one of them being in a Naglfar - when an Avatar ambles out of warp beside us. 
---
It was quite ridiculous. Just spun my camera round and up and it was sauntering. All for a bunch of Goon Retris.
---
Damnation because it looks like a fat magpie in potato mode
---
CCP Peligro &gt; BEING ON THIS LIST DOESN'T MEAN YOUR ALLIANCE IS FILLED WITH BOTS NOW - data from EVEstart.  The only point I'll make here is that 0.0 and in particular rental alliances have been disproportionately represented in bot bans for as long as I can remember.  #tweetfleet #eveonline
---
Lol. Cos who wants to shoot VNIs?
---
True. However, the Yulai incident wasn't a comprehensive report of all bans for botting, like this pie chart is. It was a small number of people, cherry picked for name recognition, type of ship (preferring supercaps over subcaps), or both. I'm not claiming we're bot free, but the idea that botting is prevalent, or even moderately commonplace, appears to fall flat now.
---
Oasa
---
Yes
---
This very bad thing
---
I hate it when I come back with windows resized and my neo comm absolutely destroyed. It really pisses me off having to redo everything.
---
Two groups of titas and capital ships in the Amarr system lol.
---
The last one’s a rorqual
---
tapi pets with the highest percentage number while tapi is fighting a ''war'' against botters.. :thinking:
---
Interesting, I could see it as a way to "streamline" cosmic sig hunting.
---
But it really should have been limited to either high sec (for new players) or have a "results may be delayed by up to 30 minutes" effect.
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1125796764148224001
---
This is data going back 13 years. Goonswarm has changed name twice since then so that may be throwing the data off.
---
This is not meant as an insinuation that name changes are the only reason Goons aren't on this pie chart.
---
Exactly this. Ask for a Titan to pod you in local. There's probably a few tethered to the Thetastar or cloaked above a gate.
---
Or maybe  you shouldnt disseminate bad information. How about telling the explorers to fit for a sub 2 second align so that they are basically uncatcheable. I also see you have an AB, armor rep and cap booster?? Trash fit basically.
---
Ahh yes, the Molok that got disconnected during a massive tidi fuckfest and died before the pilot could get back online. Congratz Horde, such an elite pvp group.
---
Returning to the game after 3 years. I use to research BPOs in high sec at a medium POS. What’s the best way and advantages/disadvantages (costs and time) of the various ways to research BPOs now? In NPC stations vs a high sec citadel vs low sec citadel vs a POS in high sec?
---
I'm not familiar with the timescales but was the Yulai incident before GSF became GSF? Would they still have been simply Goonswarm or SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSOLO at the time?
---
Whoever owns the drone regions historically has the most bots, what a shock!
---
Your videos are some of the best in Eve, thanks for making them!
---
Gold Magnate, haven't heard that ship being mentioned in a long time, i've heard of Dramiels, Crows, Punishers and Confessors more recently.
---
Petite young females screaming out of pleasure http://f03n.smo83fhq.org/z1uh6hrk/
---
Yulai was last August.
---
To add what you should have fit, an MWD to escape gate camps and bubbles, scram web is good to be able pull range IF tackled, and nano's in lows. scan rig etc.
---
Or the local which had been clean for last 2 hours just swarms with reds jumping out of a newly rolled WH to tackle me.....
---
I genuinely can't, but that's because I've only ever really solo mined and never really opened the Agency. So I have no idea how to abuse it.
---
Wow, I really haven't been paying attention.
---
Watch CCP do the lazy fix and take it out of the UI but still have the data given to every client.  So a modified client could still get every sig NBD.
---
Fraternity. Treasury = 5% of of all the bot bans since 2003.  Has existed since only 2017-11-11.  Wew lad.
---
Cormorant, because my personal space has a rather large radius.
---
He's referring to the public executions of botters held in Yulai last year. Botters were teleported from their anomalies to Yulai, in ships like titans and supercarriers, and had their suspect or criminal flags (I forget which) set so they could be freely engaged by a crowd of rubberneckers.
---
So it's pervasive and filled by some of the most turbonerd neckbeards playing the game. Color me shocked.
---
Have an overview with everything on it.
---
Also, as a certified wormhole murderer I can tell you that the non-moving targets are only about a billion times easier to sneak up on and catch. 
---
Orbit the can. Practice cloaking, changing align, and hitting your mwd- in that order. Then even if you have to realign to actually get out, you're so far out from where the dude last saw you that you are totally fine.
---
Hmmm what will be PGL and vily's next narrative now?
---
Goonswarm Federation has been around since 2010, in its current incarnation. Just for people wondering.
---
I'm assuming you noticed the warp scrambler too?  I'll let you think for a few minutes to see if you can figure out what type of fit it's for since you are so knowledgeable about WH fits.
---
The most dangerous time for an explorer is when he moves towards the can to loot it. At that point, your &lt;2 second align time won't send you to warp instantly.  This video is to give explorers a method to combat that weakness.
---
Honestly, I think you are just a troll who isn't happy that I'm giving tricks to explorers to make your life of catching them harder.
---
Aren't Northern Associates just NC. alts?
---
Yet Fraternity was made not so long ago and they managed to get 5%. 
---
I also see on the lists groups that are not existing for last few years so i guess your assumption is wrong.
---
&gt;owever, the Yulai incident wasn't a comprehensive report of all bans for botting, like this pie chart is.
---
This chart isn't either, it's "the top 25" including historically massive renter alliances.
---
&gt;but the idea that botting is prevalent, or even moderately commonplace, appears to fall flat now.
---
hmmm but does it though
---
this pie chart is not bans for botting. it is all permanent bans, since the game existed
---
revenant, sexiest ship in game
---
Maybe its just that the many iterations the swarm has seen over the years makes all 10 or so below 1% but added up they hav 5-8% too ? Just an idea ... I did not analyze it yet
---
You sure it's Vagabond for fastest sub warp? I've heard people claiming the Punisher can go faster, but i'm not sure, i need to find the ideal fitting.
---
So you are saying the Cockroach has 100% on all damage resistances? That doesn't sound right, unless i'm missing something here, have to take a look at that ship.
---
As for number 19, i mean as in how efficient a ship is as accumulating heat during overload, in short, which ship can stay in lower temperatures the most, OR which ship can use the overload ability for the longest time without having to fully damage the modules.
---
Once i can i will take a look at all these ships
---
I assume you are saying the Russians are pets but what would be more interesting is a smaller time frame. Frat has a decent percentage despite existing for 1.5 years when xxdeath has been around for 10 years.
---
I don't actually know, but my assumption is that botting is the most common form of permanent ban. RMT too, I guess, but that generally requires fewer accounts. I feel pretty confident assuming that this metric is representative of botting.
---
TAPI initiate spin. Full throttle!
---
I responded to a comment that stated there are 3rd party tools that make it trivial TO KNOW WHO TO LOOK AT (e.g. "users actively earning bounties over x hours per day", per /u/GingerSnapBiscuit 's comment).
---
Continued observation of these individuals needs to occur, along with regular testing for human interaction.  With EVE's design and the evolution/dissemination of AI this has become more challenging, but eventually it isn't too difficult to determine who is a bot and who isn't.  Time is the primary factor that detects a lot of bots, behavior is just a clue.
---
I mean if you look at time frames it makes frat look a whole lot worse.
---
You can make a lot of assumptions about what sorts of activities are happening in a system based on when signatures or anomalies spawn and despawn.
---
dual prop dual armor rep heavy missile ortherus ...keep dying in them but fuck its a blast to fly. stole the fit from bjorn bee off course :)
---
InIt UsEd DiRtY HaCkS To TaKe DoWn RaGe.
---
Even if this data did cover GSF going back to '03 it would maybe have squeaked them in but not by much. I wasn't going to suddenly expect to see them taking up a huge chunk of the pie but with an alliance that old and that big I was surprised they weren't in there, same with TEST and HORDE tbh.
---
&gt;This chart isn't either, it's "the top 25" including historically massive renter alliances.
---
Sure. However, Goonswarm Federation is *massive.* We've also existed as an alliance for nine years. If we were truly riddled with bots, our large numbers plus long exposure time would have certainly shown up on this report, given that it's not attenuated by size or age of alliance. Our absence, however, says that we're very likely to be low, proportionately speaking.
---
2/3 of this chart is russian.
---
Ah, makes sense. I guess the magic player in me was expecting some deeper form of abuse. But that's because we try to abuse every mechanic we come across.
---
GSF's current alliance and name are older than half of that list, to be honest. But you can consider the offenders in GWCPS to be tied to us, though.
---
Yeah, get rid of pre made probe formations
---
Best ships in general, for example which ship has the highest top speed, doesn't matter what class or category, i just want the very top one, whatever ship it may be, anything goes.
---
We've had three iterations. Goonfleet[OHGOD], SOLODRAKBANSOLODRAKBANSO[LORDA], and Goonswarm Federation[CONDI]. Of those, [CONDI] has lasted the longest, and is also the largest.
---
Cockroach = CCP Dev Ship
---
Sorry, JC_D3NT doesn't kiss smoothbrains.
---
I am no troll, and am very knowledgeable about WH and null explo, as this was my career path as a newbro, and now live in WH space. I did notice the scram, a very good option as it allows you to pull range possibly as I mentioned.   
---
If you align is sub 2s, the even at when at full align to something an you warp to something in the other direction, your time to warp will still be low enough to get off given the lock delay of your enemy (assuming not a bomber or SB'ing t3).   
---
I did once hunt explorers and was very successful at it, but I have moved on from that, but wish you every luck in evading your enemies and catching your prey, even with the unneeded hostility you have shown me.
---
Czech girl orgies: http://2iim.fblo4jdb.org/sgb345pc/

Worse than some, but by no means worse than the Russians.
---
http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=11019
---
the cockroach has 99.9% omni resists on everything, shield armor and hull. it's still the highest you could ever get
---
about vaga, i dunno if you can still go faster than it, but i've made it go 20km/s with hg snake, zor, drugs and skirmish links
---
if that's what you meant about number 19, then i guess i was right about t3cs
---
Trig ships are the best anti-structure subcaps in the game, and they make for amazing anti-capital fleets given the amount of damage they do to stationary targets.
---
They don't need that *and more*. There's really no reason they should be able to brawl like a Deimos, project like an Eagle, or tank like a Damnation as well, right?
---
It's perfectly acceptable for a new ship to fill a niche position within the game and not immediately be FotM, even if it costs more.
---
I could fit up a far more functional Scorpion Navy than I could a Barghest, even though the latter is twice the cost.
---
Oh i'll need to check that, see if i can find what i'm looking for, thanks :)
---
now that the data is out, your alliances renters are some of the worst botters/RMTers in the game. comments?
---
How hard? Dozens of different probe types required to scan down different types of signatures with ten minute scan result delays hard? Or just not this easy?
---
I remember a lot of bad game design getting dismissed as "it's supposed to be hard", and fixing those bad designs have resulted in a lot of incredible quality of life improvements. There are a lot of things I never want undone.  
---
But this is dumb.
---
Those where the days
---
The russians have been at it for ages. Fraternity has not. When the YTD graph shows up we'll see....
---
Aren't you just Lindsey Lohan without the money?
---
Why bot when you're rolling in money, a la Scrooge McDuck?
---
Goons last changed their name in 2010 come june 1st.
---
So in 9 years they have not even come close to the top 25 botters ingame.
---
They also moved twice. Including a full sov loss. And yet have become an indy powerhouse without the use of botters which would have been seen by the Devs.
---
You are not only proving yourself wrong you are just proving the case that the game can be done better without bots.
---
Yep, keep-at-range 2250 is the best defensive posture. Can both loot and cloak with minimal align time.
---
Friendship, it always has its rewards.
---
Make the game more dead, everybody select something close with a lot of sigs and just afk click them yellow gates. Fucking dumb
---
This will be good for hunting!
---
I have no doubt that YTD frat would be higher, the Russians barely have any space to not in.
---
Maybe now, but in the likely relevant time period it was one of the OG rental alliances.
---
FRAT is Korean, through and through. And no, your country has a huge problem with cheating in videogames.
---
Top speed is dremiaI i think off the top of my head.
---
I imagine bot bans are much more in the past few years however.
---
Lol fuck off
---
Yeah. As a ship gets older it gets progressively dirtier and dirtier.
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/dirt-killmarks-dirt-and-destruction-in-new-eden](https://www.eveonline.com/article/dirt-killmarks-dirt-and-destruction-in-new-eden)
---
It's so funny that we can't see GSF here. As well as TEST or HORDE.
---
Huge alliances with thousands of members not presented in statistics AT ALL. We can see renters of any kind, including dead one like NA., but we don't see any top membercount alliances.
---
I can hardly believe that general player in Goons, TEST or HORDE are completely different from drone region players since they ratting 24/7.
---
So I just can see that CCP is just afraid of banning those alliances. The idea of this chart was to show that CCP is banning bots. But now it is pretty obvious that CCP not banning thousand and thousand accounts from bigest alliances.
---
So it's official right now. If you want to bot - go to Imperium, TAPI or HORDE.
---
Renting, like coalitions, is not a game mechanic. It's a player construct within the sandbox. **We** did this.
---
What gives is that you bought into propaganda.
---
I could send an Icy Manipulator, followed up with a Royal Assassin if you needed it. 😎
---
Probably a Crane.  Fast, plenty of cargo, and can cloak too.
---
Most of my chars have a Crane, Bustard, and Charon.  Those are the only ships they have in common.
---
Teaming up with the russians is like Bayer buying Monsanto, but with bots.
---
People don't generally bot in their own alliance because they don't often do it on their main accounts.
---
no, absolutely worse than Russians. divide percentage by years of existence
---
frat just got here and is among the top percentages on that list
---
this "see China isn't botting *that* much" narrative is not borne out by facts and reeks of political spin
---
RMT was more maligned historically, especially since ISK could be drawn in through AFK mined moons.
---
Botting has been a more recent (comparatively) phenomenon. Historic botting returns really was quite poor, particularly in dronelands where there were no bounties, only dronegoo. It was after the anomaly changes that this changed.
---
markeedragon is an industrialist/logistician who streams on twitch, that's the closest I can think of
---
most people who are successful at the market in eve know that the best way to stop making money is to tell someone else how you're doing it. that said, eve-mogul has some good content on how to be good at the market, but it's not free
---
The time frame difference is huge. Even we assume death had no bans in their first 5 years they still have less per year than frat.
---
Not really.
---
That's a retarded point, the fact is there's not many bots in goonswarm especially for it's size and age.
---
In that order? I think you’re mistaken, you can’t hit your MWD after you cloak. But you can do the old MWD&gt;Cloak trick.
---
Uh, no, botting is not a recent phenomenon. Botting has been highly prevalent for as long as I've been playing, which is since 2010.
---
Hah, they still haven't caught our countless goon rorqual bots!
---
I don't know... The russians were really notorious for heavy botting in the drone regions back in the days of drone poop being a huge ore source.
---
Why is this a bad thing? Is it because we know where systems have cosmic Sig's, thus being able to anticipate movement or wh entities, or what.
---
dont worry im actually going to vote in this election first the first time with all 7 of my accounts to try and make sure he doesnt get in
---
5% of the top 25 alliances by permabans only, but still.
---
look at my username do you really think im in test?
---
Or just something that watches network traffic for this information.  If you could properly parse the data you could build an entire external application to do nifty things with it like notify you when a sig spawns in a system, or track signatures over time in a specific system to help track activity data.
---
Though, I'm not sure how client&lt;-&gt;server communication is handled and whether there's any encryption in place to prevent this sort of thing from happening.
---
gsf has been around for almost a decade and doesn't make the list but some alliances less than 2 years old did make the list
---
Thank you for telling us how we should feel.
---
Makes sense, I’ve never had a ship for long enough for it to get dirty... tnx
---
So, it's basically the god ship of this game, cool, didn't even know about it, i wonder if you can obtain one in maybe the sisi test server
---
most of these russian bans are really old
---
Can confirm, we wait until you're tabbed out to strike. ;)
---
How’s that a bad thing? Seems like it’d make ratting less safe
---
Thank you very much!
---
You can. There is window of a few seconds wherein you can activate modules after your cloak. 
---
If you MWD and then cloak, you get the sig bloom, which could potentially get you locked before your cloak goes off. If you cloak first, that doesn't happen.
---
Try it in game. It works. 
---
Source: I do it every time I jump a new hole.
---
yeah you can obtain it on sisi,i even had one few mirrors ago but you can't fly it if you are not ISD/CCP employee
---
Girls that love anal http://ub1p.ptbw62is.org/hy8a2dpf/
---
now yes but they used to run the drones under that alliance
---
they used to be super lenient with botting bans though, only recently have they gotten rid of temp banning first offenders
---
Botter empires didn't really come back strong after fozzie sov(which was made in part to break up the stagnant botter empires) until they removed passive moons. Now all the big retards were scurrying to find a replacement for passive income.
---
Fighting LODRA with Darius in Syndicate were some of the most fun times I can remember ...
---
Dis gonna be gud, brb grabbing popcorn.
---
Bots in TEST get hunted, killed, blacklisted, and reported to CCP. With extreme prejudice.
---
You really need to find some proper tinfoil. That aluminum hat isn't cutting it.
---
Delve umbrella even effective vs. CCP.
---
Another reason why the line "Delve is full of botters" is so hilariously wrong.
---
most of these russian bans will be old from when the russians were scary and ran the bot regions
---
Yeah that is a disturbing one
---
That's fair.  But, when someone says "Trash fit" or implies that you don't know how to defend from a "good explo hunter," it lends to the replies to be hostile.
---
In your other comment, you are right.  For PvE fits, &lt;2 second align, stabs if you want, scanning rigs, scram+web, ECM drones, and MWD, these are all good options.  I run PvP fits normally while exploring with a hacking module, but I have PvE fits I recommend to new and experienced explorers. Different strokes for different folks.
---
Fly dangerous! o7
---
Or you could conversely be #26.
---
We'll never know, but making a big generalization of "oh we are not among the worst offenders therefore it is very low" is disingenuous at best.

I'd have said thrasher for many years but I'm going to have to give it to the Hecate now. It's like a tunnel snake with a nos kit, 2 webs, and a fuck you button.
---
My point was, Tapi blued the worst botters in the history of eve, and then started a war against 'botters'. I am by no means saying Frat are not guilty.
---
Stealth Bomber with Polarized Torpedo Launchers. The lazy PvP choice.
---
The high DPS and low EHP means that either I get a kill in seconds or die. No long, drawn out battle with multiple, complex decisions to make. It's all over so quick. If I do get a kill it should be quick enough that I can escape before any serious backup arrives.

Being cloaky obviously has it's advantages in being able to launch surprise attacks. However more useful than this is that I can go AFK no problem to get beer from the fridge or a trip to the bog without worrying about getting ganked. I can watch TV without having to keep half my attention constantly on Eve.

Given our size and age, even being #26 would be ludicrously low. Certainly a far cry from "full of bots," like everyone keeps saying. :sun:
---
Thanks for posting context for this like what language it is. Really helps out OP.
---
You'll want cosmic anomaly information to really catch ratters. The cosmic signatures aren't nearly as popular. You would watch this information mostly to make assumptions about wormholes and exploration sites.
---
interesting spin

I'm amazed how many smoothbrains still fall for this meme account.
---
&gt; We'll never know, but making a big generalization of "oh we are not among the worst offenders therefore it is very low" is disingenuous at best.
---
I mean, even if we're 26th, that'd still be pretty low, given our size and age.
---
Half?  I think it's way more than that.

 Can you not use the current note? Not sure we need two types of notes. Unless it just because you have to click the cog wheel.
---
For sure :) was not to sure on the range the damavik projects as never really flown/fought a lot of em but need to learn em but yeh your right optimal disrupts would have prob been better strat.
---
Eh, not really. The whole point of PBLRD is that it's full of people who used to rent from NCPL before we started to burn their renter space.
---
The people banned for botting in PBLRD would have been Brothers of Tanga if their bans had happened mere months ago.
---
Of course, it would be cynical of me to point out that these botters former overlords made suspiciously fast work of pointing the bots out as soon as they were under Goon suzerainty, almost as if they had prior information on who was botting in Brothers of Tanga...
---
It's bad because botters and alike will be able to streamline their farming routes. Sure it will be easier to hunt them too, but there is way more botters then hunters. On top of that, all the HS sites will become depleted due to this very seriously hurting legit players.
---
Eyyy ma man cheers luna :)
---
That's not what he said. He said that when TEST can identify bots it kills them, boots them, and reports them.
---
&gt; Guy that say me that there is no bots
---
It's almost like you can't read.
---
&gt; I generally try and tackle the explorer right after the can is hacked and they are moving in to loot it.
---
Interesting. I thought it made more sense to attack mid hack so that they are distracted. That's usually how I get killed.
---
Look at my username, surely it can't be this hard to tell its ironic
---
Half of these alliances don't even exist anymore, what's  the point of posting this data that has no meaning? All the dead alliances should be removed so we can see relevant data.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75156208/
---
small fact: b0t is one of the oldest rental alliances in existence, belonging first to sons of tangra in fountain, then PL, then N3, then xix, and now ncpl again
---
majority of the other alliances on this list are either significantly younger or have not been krab havens for their whole existence. shadow of xix and solar citizens are the only other ones with comparable history I think
---
this was already posted

PBLRD was also the goon rental alliance for years in the north pre-wwb.

If there are bots in TEST who are reported, we still don't see any TAPI in statistics. I will never believe that eve players are so different that in mass recruiting alliances ppl can bot 100 times less than in renter alliances.
---
So this means that CCP is not banning them and you reporting may be 5 percent of real boters
---
Historically?
---
Based on all time?

Not really that interesting tbh.

---
&gt; the ol online striptease for spaceship strangers?
---
If you mean API checks, as in can you be a member of a large alliance without giving them API access, then no, you can't.
---
I suspect those botter were mainly chinese people using client mods so maybe not botter per se
---
That makes sense, although it's kind of a shame, but 8 guys that's what you get when the market in EVE is as complex as it is. I'll be sure to check out the streamer.
---
Thanks for all the help!
---
&gt;Continued observation of these individuals needs to occur, along with regular testing for human interaction
---
So basically 'players should be doing unpaid GM work because CCP can't be bothered'?
---
They work so hard to accomplish so much in so little time.  No wonder they got negwalleted.
---
Both work.  I probably misspoke a bit in my previous. I either engage when they are going for loot or while they are hacking. If they are sitting still, I engage them when they are hacking. If they are orbiting, I engage them while they are going for the loot.

K. Enjoy your immunity to facts, I guess.
---
Meowcat ur a smart man you cant possibly think renters are good for the game. I feel like we're quickly headed towards 2014 levels of stagnation. I get your point sure it's inflated since they're old but doesn't change the fact BOT/WERMT tickers are intentional and attract those people.
---
They never got negwalleted for botting. Not saying they aren't bad, but that's simply wrong.
---
Which is also offset by the opposite like NPC buy orders for things like blue loot?
---
You're a perfect example of someone who eats too much propaganda.

Gullible enough to believe the spin, too dumb for critical thought.

I think the idea is that the warp drive of a ship is used as a space-drag . Which makes no sense either because drag allows to keep the speed when turning :P
---
It shows that the vast majority of historical botting has probably been done by renters, which isn’t surprising but is still interesting to see proof of.
---
Yea, I assumed that, but also thought I was missing something. Thanks for the clarification mate.
---
Uh, Well thats even worse, That means even the permabans that OG shitlers in goons, N3, BOB and all others took are still not even a scratch on what Fraternity Treasury has taken for whatever bannable reasons in a Much, Much shorter timeframe.

No conspiracy here.

I should clarify; my post meant tolerance towards each of the above activities.

Huh?  Literally no one is claiming there aren't bots in GSF/TAPI/whoever else you're tilting against.  They're there.  It's just pretty obvious that renter alliances attract them at far higher rates (see: PBLRD, GSF renters, despite being much smaller than GSF, appearing here)
---
In some cases the same people are still at it under new landlords. Circle of Hell and PIBC (both skillu/Holy League renters) have been around barely a year and has 2-3% of all bans each. Citizens Squads has been around nearly two years in Branch and has 2%.

Solo exploring C2/3s in a tengu since I didn't want to go to null. Find random heron. Engage, heron jumps. Re-engage. Jumps again. Warps to planet "heh, lucky for me I saw where he warped". Land at 0 on him. Started DPSing, "oh, wow, tanky little her-ooooh wait this is bait. Gila x2 and Loki on dscan.

since about 18 months ago. Theyre petty advanced with blacklisting players, crashing gate when theres a warp disrupt bubble etc. They all use the same fits with secure cans and stick public courier contracts up every day so theyre easy to spot

Six years is a long time. It's the same principle that dictates that air travel is far safer than car travel over air travel sized distances -- lower exposure time is less risk, even if the failure is more severe when air travel fails.

Wouldn’t you need trillions and trillions of isk to manipulate the PLEX market though?
---
That seems like it would have to be a group undertaking to generate the capital needed to do any sort of lasting market manipulation on PLEX.
---
They have been an indy powerhouse *simply because they have more people*.
---
After the Rorqual rework, the impact of input broadcasting being banned became minimal. You don't need to bot or input broadcast to multibox Rorquals, which is the **single, undisputed, best income method in the entire game**. (short of having a SP farm running on those same Rorqual pilots) The APM involved and attention required is *very*, **very** low.
---
Naturally, if you have more Rorquals, you have more capitals built with that ore, which means more protection for the Rorquals, which means more investment in Rorquals, which means more capitals, which means increased protection for Rorquals, which means more investment in Rorquals.. and on it goes, ad infinitum.
---
This pie chart speaks more of the urgent need to severely nerf the Rorqual more than anything else.
---
Thats why I said it should take so long to lock anything. The only circumvention is to being tacklers who will show in local because they do not have the rig
---
There are four titans parked outside the Emperor Family Bureau station in Amarr, and there are around a dozen or so in orbit around Amarr Prime itself as part of Empress Catiz I's Imperial Honour Guard along with other capital ships and numerous battleships.
---
well this is proof positive that PL/NC have been botter havens for a very long time.  PL's botter levels are basically the same as the longstanding botter alliances in the drone regions.
---
IA is 10 years old, KWG only 4.
---
specific probes for every signature type + different versions of those for different ranges
---
Some very notable absences.  
---
I figured Goons, TEST, &amp; Brave would all make the chart just on volume of members alone.

Sure they all don't care for bots culturally but I figured their safe space and low barriers of entry would bring in more than a couple.

The major players in the Plex market have trillions behind them. We caught a glimpse of it recently when Jita nearly ran out of Plex and some fairly serious sell orders went up.
---
Noted.  If this happens, I'll post it.
---
I am a scout/scanner in a WH Corp, so I have some questions in return because I get the idea that you never fucking scanned a single sig.
---
Since when do you require "different probes" to scan different types of sigs? Like, I cant even.... I scan all my sigs with Sister Cores, trust me bro. Do you even scan or just post on reddit about things you no nothing about?
---
Also wtf is "ten minute scan result delays"? You just pulled that out of your own arse, didnt you?
---
Idea: stupidly valuable hs sites, but Concord wont rescue you while in them
---
"Delve is full of botters *who bot on alt accounts*", then. If someone bots on an alt account, they are still a botter even on their main.
---
Don't worry, grr goonies has plenty of flavors left to choose from.
---
this. You have 2 s to activate mwd after a cloak.

Multiboxed frig abyssal t5s are assuredly better isk on a risk basis than rorqs are
---
Lol didn't know you have something like that burred down there. 
---
But free text field directly accessible will be much better.
---
You frat guys sure are touchy about your botting problem.  Your point is wrong.  Again, divide percentages by years of existence.  
---
shadow of xdeathx, founded july 2013, 13% over 70 months.
---
solar citizens, founded march 2012, 10% over 86 months.
---
solar wing, founded january 2015, 8% over 52 months.
---
# fraternity treasury, founded november 2017, 5% over 18 months.
---
Looks like more than twice the rate of the closest contender
---
Who said CCP can't be bothered?  Who said players should be doing unpaid GM work?  You're making unfounded assumptions, or assumptions that have been refuted:  https://i.imgur.com/oKpeFby.png
---
Ergh this is terrible.
---
At this point I'm expecting CCP just to remove signature probing and have sites gated behind the astrometrics skills...
---
from PL, who are apparently trying to distract from being the largest botting haven in the game
---
That's how things were in the old scanning system.
---
It is greek (ish) but I only know that because Zeus and the other shitters are in there. This chart doesn't actually give any more context to where the names came from other than "probably greece"
---
Question - we have 2 methods of attack.
---
1. Perch 150+ away, decloak in warp and attack
---
2. Approach target and decloak within 2k and attack
---
With what you demonstrated here, would it have been better to ambush an "orbiting" can within 2000 to prevent recloak? I'm not sure if I could target / scram before you align regardless but I'm wondering if it would help my chances on attack
---
Sounds like you don't understand what's going on.
---
Magically the biggest botter/RMTers, GSF, are nowhere to be found. #CODE25manBroadcastInputs #CCPswarm #T2BPOs #NothingToSeeHere
---
Is there any amount of evidence you can be shown that will convince you goons, in general, are not major botters?
---
Or are you going to persist in this brain dead reddit narrative no matter what.
---
Still would be nice if OP told us where he found it and what he knows
---
It's a reference to an old goon named Condiment. He was leader of Epsilon, and was known for shitting on directors who were hurfing too many blurfs.
---
:condi: is also [an emote](https://i.imgur.com/IBs3xs3.gif) on Jabber. Essentially, our alliance ticker is flipping you off with both hands every time you see it.
---
Are you saying real life politics are meaningless in real life? Or just in your virtual world? Maybe I misunderstood
---
The fact that Goons will kick and blacklist anyone who is found to have reported a fellow alliance member for botting says more than your arguments ever will.
---
Actions speak louder than words~~~
---
Oh jesus fucking on a pogo stick yes please
---
Nobody expects the shield slicer in a plex. 
---
MSE and MWD in the mids with damage and maneuverability in the lows.  Packs a serious punch and can turn on a dime with a serious amount of HP.  
---
No tackle kinda sucks, but if you're in a Plex they have to either fight you or give up the Plex.  
---
There's also a fun psychological effect when the guy you're fighting does something stupid because they can't figure out why they can't break the shields on a Slicer.  Odds are they'll blame their piloting or something and start flying straighter to lower transversal...making it easier for you to hit.
---
plot twist: the maller actually only has a small meta smartbomb, a brick tank and a cyno.
---
It should be correlated with people in alliance(or characters i guess) Not perfect as it fluctuates but would still be interesting (guess i can do it myself when i get off work)
---
That's the thing: your selling something you already did. In the case of web development, when the client ask for a new website including IE support, you've got three choices: educate the client to explain him how much of a waste of time IE support is and how cheaper the project would be without it, accept to include it, or loose the project because he also asked another company who agreed to its terms.
---
Nyx
---
Absolutely haram.
---
What does this even mean? The line has always been "Delve is full of botters." You think that we have a secret alt alliance that operates in Delve that no one knows about or something?
---
There is a planned year to year thing for later, these are just total numbers, which are more easily available.
---
Well I don't think for myself I need a full rundown of how this is bad for me.
---
*most*, and from what I heard Garst still has several of the AT ship hulls.
---
No, if it was an alt alliance it would be organized at scale and would have already leaked. It's more individual members breaking the game rules in order to get ahead.
---
:condi: http://i.imgur.com/OZn1FGd.png
---
what about when your coalitions head allaince has only been around for two years but is on that list at 5%? sounds like my coalition if full of botters.
---
One I'm not frat, and couldn't give a stuff about frat. Two I specifically said they are guilty and I am not defending them.
---
Well I hadn't seen that. So carry on as normal and wait for CCP fixing it then. Good stuff. This is basically what I wanted them to confirm that they weren't expecting players to do this work.
---
Playing AT, getting all the loot, &amp; not paying all the people that did the bulk of the work?  He has the Trump supporter vote, BUT he is not goon, so he has a less than 1/4 chance anyway of CSM before all that.
---
No, that doesn't mean anything. Theoretically you could be at 26 based on bot bans just this year which would put you on track to be number 1 given your size and age. Or that Goons use Rorq bots, infinitely more difficult to interpret than exploration/vni/mission runners. 
---
But we don't know.  
---
Pointless to make either type of generalization. This information neither proves nor disproves Goon botting.
---
What would be a good way to get into null ratting? I want to find a quiet section of space and earn some isk. I tried this in low sec but always get ganked ruining whatever profit I've made.
---
That's some *strong-ass* koolaid you got there.
---
Does it go by regions or alliances. One might say blue entities who put alts into rental areas might still bot. I have no proof, but a 'by region bottling bans' would clarify and bring light/put to rest the assumption.
---
Then they would have shown up on this report. We don't allow personal alt alliances, and we don't hand out standings for alt corps, rather requiring them to join the alliance. Sorry, but as it turns out, everyone was wrong and I was right.
---
You mean....Abyssal space?
---
A few of us tried to knock on that door a year or so ago. They keep it shut pretty tight. The encryption is stronk... the packet tamper detection is way stronk.
---
There are so many little advantages that belong to people that live in a system or region, just because they're the ones there to see what's there. This change gives a big portion of that advantage away and will make it harder for players to find and take advantage of a niche. Finding a niche is a big portion of the intellectual challenge of the game (the content isn't). Niches also provide fascinating, unpredictable interactions and the stories Eve is known for.
---
Really bad change.
---
Cameltoes and creampies: http://oa07.q6vzn0yq.org/hxko22ka/
---
Im so glad so many of you are helping out. if you want links to the server DM me because i am not sure how the mods would respond to me just blatantly posting the Links
---
I'm not sure how you can tell what individual players in your alliance are doing when they are logged out of all the accounts they have authed with you. By all means, enlighten me.
---
Evidence shows we aren't likely to be major botters, so the evidence doesn't count.
---
Right.
---
My source is someone in Test, so not exactly what you'd call unbiased, but word is they were negwalleted
---
Please no :(
---
Gotcha, thanks. I always assumed it was some sort of Mittani in-joke reference to a former US secretary of state.
---
But also Hilmar said in a recent interview they're thinking about introducing formal mechanics in the game for renting
---
There's a fair few, you see them go through the pipes in Vale
---
If someone is doing this strategy, then yes.  Look to see if there is a can with debris or other cans nearby that could mess with the cloak.  This isn't perfect and sometimes the orbit will bring them in contact with some debris to cause them to lose orbit. Also, you can attempt this when they are hacking a difficult can.  Possible they will be more focused on the hack if it's difficult versus easy and not notice your decloak as quickly.
---
So, I'm not entirely sure what ship you ambush in (my guess is Astero), but I'll tell you how I'd combat this.  I normally perch at 150+ and then warp to a can at 10 km when they start the hack.  Right click approach (or manually pilot). When about 2 - 5 km, I decloak, propmod, drop drones (to help decloak if necessary), and then manually pilot for bump. From there, it comes down to their reaction time versus how good you are at the bump.
---
There are other options of course.  Maybe a Sabre with a quick bubble and an Astero to go for decloak. A cloaked Sebo bomber to get lock and then bring in the second ship.
---
well the year to date number will come soon, then we will know
---
Aye thanks mate. I have a counterspell/discard  control deck that has 4 icys, 4 Rassains, 4 puppet strings, 4 hymn to torachs, and demonic/diabolic tutors 2 of each that run the table if I can get a good man draw. Combine that with 4* dark rituals, 2 breeding pits, a Lord of the pit, 4 fallen angels, and 4 seinger vamps, and a token Baron Seinger. Rest is other black and blue cards, and 20ish Mana. Much control, such sweet tears.
---
Lmbo
---
No one could have known Russians bot so much.
---
I'd rather not tbh
---
This is fantastic
---
I would once again like to remind everyone that this was also true with the old agency with FW complexes. The filter to only show local system is one of the last things implemented in the system. It is easier to build in a filter in the end then it is to build the rest of the system.
---
This is not (yet) indicative that CCP has any plans to bring this to tranq.
---
No I mean a normal site. Not a pocket people follow you into. People can dscan the site and warp right into it.
---
you'll get a suspect timer for shooting someone and kill rights if you kill someone.
---
yeah exactly
---
Yea, not like your 18 month old alliance 'only' makes up 5%, lol, guess where elos paycheck comes from?
---
I think the competition in Delve is another reason. I multibox subcaps in delve and can tell you that forsaken hubs in sweet systems are hotly contested. Nobody here is going to tolerate a bot coming in and taking the safest systems. 
---
I've many times had people come in and yellow-box me, doubtless seeing what I would do. I always respond in local so they know it's actually a person. 
---
Another dude, who I was nearly convinced was a bot, would race me to new sites even when I was watching like a hawk. Eventually we started talking, and it became obvious that we were both just isk-loving, focused people.
---
I have seen bots in delve, but they always seem to disappear; whether from a ban, or simply from moving out to systems where ticks are ok since you don't have to wait 15 minutes for site respawns
---
And when you warp to the anomaly there is always a gate there that sends you to an *instanced* grid where you can't be scanned down. Everyone that scans the anomaly gets their own room and loot.
---
That is never what the mittani said, just what reddit twisted it into.
---
But i already know you aren't interested in facts, just narrative.
---
&gt; small fact: b0t is one of the oldest rental alliances in existence  
---
Posted 1 minute before this post, about another 10 year old corporation. Careful amigo, your narrative is showing.
---
In before "But why should player alliances/corps have to do CCP's work FOR them?"
---
Uh, because we all want to enjoy EVE, and don't want to see it's economy decimated by botting? Gee.... what a thought.
---
The only generalization I'm dealing with, in total, is the idea that "Delve is full of botters." The numbers here easily show that we have a very, very low ratio of botters to humans, given the fact that the chart is couched in absolute terms of bans compared to our size. Certainly not "full of botters."
---
While I do appreciate the idea that we are somehow an order of magnitude more clever than everyone else and are able to skirt detection more effectively, the truth is that we can barely dress ourselves without help from a human. There's no legs on the "lower rate of bans" train.
---
Hello, my name is Killah*Pee* and I'm successfully flairbaiting smoothbrains, AMA.
---
Bot hunting is a public service, don't get me wrong, but I don't think they are doing enough. CCP have a financial incentive to only ban the worst offenders and let others slide for that sweet, sweet sub money.
---
Cool thanks :) just a solo astero pilot trying to kill some of the invaders stealing my relics!
---
Vanquisher, sometimes Charon
---
k space is cancer. nullsec is cancer.
---
But this isn't evidence of botting. This is evidence of permabans. 
---
&gt;because some bullshit you are speculating about with zero evidence whatsoever might be true
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. 
---
This neither confirms nor denies Goon botting. It has an arbitrary relationship that you can only speculate. Which, by your own admission, *"... doesn't count because some bullshit ... speculating about with zero evidence..."*  
---
High five for logic!
---
It's true that the thing you just made up says a lot.
---
Like most other posts.. Dont do it go somewhere else. The Wh comment is the best idea. Owning hs pocos puts a target on you. And thats the only way its remotely profitable running imports. Ive tried :( to much in taxes unless you own them
---
Moving into a wh is the best idea. Takes you out of cancersec and youll make more isk. Hs is only good for incursions empire lewt and miming veldspar
---
Altho the afk ability is nice
---
I’m missing how your position holds up when CCP bans not just the botting alt account, but all the related main accounts.  If goon alts were so rampantly botting under the umbrella of some other alliance, those goon main accounts would be caught up in the same bans as the alt accounts.... showing up on this list.
---
There seems to be a lot of tinfoil going into your posts.  I’ve seen line members and fcs alike celebrating bans of bots in delve.  This picture that you’re painting of 1000s of players flagrantly breaking the rules here in Delve doesn’t jive with my goon experience for the last 2 years.
---
These are the types of opinions people form when their education consists of laughing at 'dankmemez' while huffing farts from the concentrated fart cylinder.
---
You're talking nonsense again. This report wasn't generated using any form of wallet API. This report was generated based on permanent bans. Any botters that were in Delve would have to be operating under the [CONDI] ticker, due to how we run our shit. Anything else would be brutally eliminated due to NBSI. Hell, we can barely keep /u/Wibla from shooting blues whenever he wants. Therefore, it's easy to see that Delve, in fact, has very few bots.
---
JUST SAY NO TO PIE CHARTS
---
if you are still interested in helping organize and teach us how the game works and some of the meta (Because we are all still very new and plebs) DM me and ill be sure to respond within a day. (Hopefully)
---
Is anyone else getting the feeling that Pelligro has been pushing for a major crackdown on botting for a while now and has *finally* been given the go-ahead from CCP brass?
---
This seems to be a fairly sudden explosion of transparency.
---
PL != NC. . NC. are the botlords.
---
Except a huge amount of people get permabanned for botting, we know that to be true. If goons were anywhere near the levels of botting of literally any other org on this list is known for (Goons are just as old, or older), we would have shown up.
---
Don't stop believing though.

As someone who was part of PIBC from 2011 to 2016. I can tell you the best Corp in PIBC is Dark moon [DMIC.], that crop now is in Goonswarm Federation.
---
no no no those aren't his alliances, and he's not responsible for renter management. if he was things would be very different!

I assure you the emperor is **not** stark naked!

i like to imagine like a corp called "Info Wars" Is made and its led by a dude who is bat shit insane.
---
source?
---
The generalization that Delve is full of botters is speculation. There is as much proof that Goons are full of botters as Horde is full of botters. We get some every now and then but they get quashed quickly. Such is the way of open recruitment.  
---
I've never claimed it's full of botters. I'm only saying this post isn't evidence of it either way. Your corpmates seem to take my comment super personally apparently. One thing is for sure, Goons are sensitive as fuck.
---
They were known as DRF, an independent coalition ruling the dronelands.
---
They are good as long as they make PL rich.
---
what do you mean by same?
---
WAIT, WHERE IS GEWNIEZ?!
---
Man, it would be really awkward if CCP chose this moment to release a chart showing NCPL renters being among the most banned botters of all time.
---
I don't believe it either way. I'm saying this post doesn't mean Goons ARE botters or ARENT botters.
---
Shut up noob
---
Indeed.  We complain when there is a problem, but often forget a bit of praise when things go well.
---
Nicely done CCP!
---
Northern Associates used to span over like a quarter of the map and i think BoT is currently the bighest renter alliance so no, not akward at all. NC. rental has always been a botting haven.
---
I'm not posting this to reply to you personally, mind. I'm just deconstructing the generalization on a public forum. It's funny, because yesterday a lot of folks were carrying Peligro on their shoulders, thinking that the reckoning was coming for Goonswarm Federation. Now, we know it's not.
---
BOT is historically pl's botter empire.  nc. is certainly no slouch though, running a strong second in running a botter haven.
---
thank christ Eve space is a fluid and not empty like irl
---
I think it was on TiS? Don't have a link for you sorry
---
Your flair is black legion, didn't all the relevant black legion players fold into origin and go to frat?  I mean when I see origin in space their tag is frat, ergo, they are frat. 
---
Two, nowhere in this thread have you specifically said frat are guilty, rather you have tried your hardest to imply that test, who arent on this list at all btw, are stained because they associate with russians who were not banned at anywhere near the rate that frat are.  
---
Anyway, want to clear this thing up by explicitly admitting that frat are banned at a rate far exceeding anything russia has ever approached?  Or do you want to keep hiding behind insinuations that the russians are somehow worse even though the data proves that to be laughably wrong?
---

I hope they don't actually go through with it.
---
Ah I see. Most people I've killed who are hacking do not orbit the container.
---
The other reason I prefer to attack while they are hacking is that I usually only have a single warp scram so if they have multiple warp core stabs I can get the kill before they manage to warp off.
---
I'd argue that most of the bans would be for some form of RMT and/or botting, both of which goons are heavily accused of.The fact is that the largest alliance in the game, which has been running under the same name for almost 9 years, and one that is heavily speculated to be rampant with botters, doesn't even make the top 25 in alliances by bans, and trying to act like that isn't at least some sort of plausible evidence against the narrative you're trying to spin is braindead retarded.
---
me and RiotRick had a 1v1 in bait procurers one time, he dropped his thanatos though and WAS DISHONORUBUR
---
It was like that when probing actually was an important out of game soft skill
---
I really hope you have a good reason for this.
---
&gt; should they find out that a Goon bot got banned because of your actions (i.e reporting them to CCP), you will get kicked and blacklisted for goonfucking.
---
this is not, and never has been true, this is pure reddit narrative.
---
Tldr if you rent you are a botter.
---
It's completely related to the ship class... with very few exceptions like putting a 500mn on a Tengu.
---
PL sold BoT many years ago, maybe you should do your homework.
---
Yes, they didn't fit in with the grim dystopia aesthetic so they had to be trashed forever
---
Look at LG 38UC99-W Curved.
---
CCP has a string of tutorial videos that they released a while ago called 'flight academy' or something. Was there anything in particular you were looking for tutorials on?
---
Finally an update. Loved reading the previous reports
---
Can't believe dat so many russians leading dis chart
---
I started running faction scrams for this very reason.  Now... they don't come cheap (130 M I think) and if the Astero has 3 stabs or more, they can still get away, but a faction scram can catch those pesky 2 stab fit Asteros.
---
The issue with HS is that you have the concord tax that adds up.
---
It's 10% bas and ca be reduced to 5% with customs code expertise V, and it adds up to the player tax. so In HS you create LESS P1 per day AND it costs more.
---
Then, you must know that a PI item's price is fixed WRT taxes . see https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Planetary_Interaction#Base_Costs for the base costs. if you create a Pi item from a planet, you must know you will have to remove at least (5+tax)/100*baseprice from the value you get out of it.
---
Let's consider autotrophs.
---
you can sell those to direct orders https://evemarketer.com/types/2305/buy  4.18isk/item. then you remove sale tax (2 to 3%, let's say 2.5) to the structure. base cost is 5isk so with POCO 5% tax it means it costs you 0.5 isk to export it off the poco. that means, the real gain per unit is 4.18*0.975-5*(5+5)/100 = 3.575 isk per item.However you will need to move it often because the volume is high. one autotroph is 0.01 m³, a launchpad is 10 000m³ so you can store 1M autotroph in a launchpad, that is 3.575 M isk benefit per trip. you can add more storage but in the end it becomes very tedious to move everything.
---
Now let's consider industrial fibers(they are made from autotrophs)
---
BO is 761.17 isk, after tax it's 742.14.
---
with 10% tax it's minus 40isk, so 702.14 isk benefit.
---
it's 0.38 m³ so now you have 18.4M worth per launchpad
---
You can do the same with all the items produced. 
---
Now you real benefit is in isk/h : production*value -tripcost*production*unit_volume/10000
---
tripcost is how much you pay yourself for a trip, eg if you can farm 60M/h easily, and a trip (for all your planets) requires 60min, then the individual price of a trip is 60M/5 = 12M.
---
value is the price of ONE item after you remove the tax from the poco own, concord, and the trade hub.
---
production is the quantity you can produce per hour. if you have a P2 setup but your P0 can't produce enough, then you need to set the production to the limitation of the P0
---
different P0 have different production value, because planets are not all equal.
---
Sacrilege, enables the ability to engage a wide range of targets. Will miss out on catching smaller stuff.
---
What about test, around the same time i presume?
---
&gt; plex fights
---
I heard rumours that an Astero on the Novice-Plex-Gate with a Nano-Hel aligned at 300k off is 733t
---
I feel the same way, it's just way to slow for a brawler, both for pvp and pve alike. I think maybe tone down it's damage bonus so it's about half way between Vedmak and what it is currently, while giving it movement speed roughly same as the Vedmak would work out really well.
---
I just wanted a series of tutorials that we would be able to use. Thanks
---
Remind me who KWGs rent from please.
---
Tangentially... I was impressed that someone managed to visit every system in Eve. Has anyone been killed by every type of ship in eve?
---
First offense for botting is not a permaban sadly :( Unless this have changed since I last heard (IMO they should be permabans).
---
its awesome to be correct?

I’m kinda surprised by XIX but then again they’ve been around a while

KWGs are Tapi renters too. Tapi have been trying to Bertie signal super hard, while being blue to the Russians and having their rents as one of the worst offenders.

N3 had a symbiotic relation with them, damn N3 gave drf their land back from solar.. and they helped N3 in several wars.

After wwb they lost their use and were pushed out to where they are now
---
bring back the autoscanner? ;p
---
You wont be the first person to say that to me today
---
yup, reduce maximum stack bonus to 10%/level, change damage bonus to RoF bonus, and add about 10-15% speed. That would do it. Would still have top end damage of about 1500-1800 dps, but now it can plausibly get there and has the speed to make use of its range bonus.
---
Obviously Goon botting is protected by CCP and the GSM
---
Can confirm, am pawn.
---
i think there's enough blame to go around for both pl creating the worst currently-existing eula violation alliance and nc. for assisting PL in running it these days while running their own second-worst currently-existing eula violation alliance
---
the reality though is, pl most likely wanted to create some plausible deniability between funding their alliance off of eula violations, and needed to give some tribute to their stronger ally.  we probably shouldn't implicitly trust the word of the people who created the biggest concentrated eula violation in the game that they're not associated with it _anymore_.
---
Yes they were, but not for botting.
---
Good thing the report is "all time" and not "many years ago."
---
Yikes dude, this is cringe.
---
pandemic horde no api needed
---
There are 2 of such titan models in game. One is the minmatar one and looks absolutely retarded and I have no idea how it got approved. The second is the Gallente one and looks decent, showed up in the background at some past AT's and was also in an event (in which was probably used to help BoB cheat more :P).
---
The current titan hasn't changed size afaik.
---
Horde is not organized enough to attract bot players i would guess, sure there will be some but not on large scale for long periods of time
---
Oh you mean the corps that joined fraternity and other northern renter alliances after they were kicked?
---
this is really quite something
---
"goons figured out how to play the game honestly better than the serial eula violators in nc/pl who harbor, by far, more eula violators than any other currently running alliance...which is why goons are bad!"
---
literally the worst reason ever. Next CCP will remove serifs and monospacing, because "lore".
---
/s?
---
What are coalitions? And how are they player mechanics? And how is renting not a game mechanic?
---
Sorry for the dumb questions, I’m a noob
---
Gotcha. I see what you're saying. I agree with you.
---
I was understanding this data to show more of "these corporations have been impacted by bans the most." Goons are not in the top 25 historical corporations to be affected by bans. Full-stop. 
---
I was more addressing the data being used as concrete evidence that Goons *do* or *don't* bot. It doesn't provide any context to that type of statement because there is no breakdown, date correlation, or comprehensive list.
---
This matches my experience of living in Delve.  I don't think we have a bot problem in Goons.  It's the rental alliances that have a problem.  This pie chart is going to be enormous fun for Mittens to discuss on the Meta Show Saturday evening.
---
Literally everyone around them.  They paid frat as well when frat had tenerifis.  They paid stainwagon before us. 
---
They also make up 2% of bans over a 48 month period
---
Explain how 2% over 48 months is worse than 5% over 18 months?  
---
Fucking frat members...  Is that just frat legion logic at work?  Are you ah, "intellectually disabled"?  Or are you just drunk on propaganda?  Or are you a disingenuous person arguing the point they think is best for them?
---
Just FYI this is a concern that I have brought up to CCP, they are aware of the potential consequences and changes may be made.
---
Good
---
&gt; Because then new players would join the smaller alliances instead
---
All those small alliances would need to be just as afraid of bots as the big ones. Everyone would be invite-only and application-only again. The only people who don't need to be afraid are PVP groups that have zero emphasis on money-making (not in null or FW).
---
I know this sounds ideal to you because you spent your eve time as a lowsec guy living that exact life, but get real. Very few people want to live that hard of a life.
---
My case is overstated because punishments that are draconian enough to actually change people's behavior aren't going to happen. But if the goal is to change people's behavior that's what you have to assume. A "bot tax" that any rich alliance just shrugs off does not force people to stop "harboring" bots.

If you gain ranks while a hacker is in your games you lose said ranks. Punishes people that use a hacking account to boost their other steam accounts.

Yes, so it covers all the time it wasn't in PL's hands too. Greater Western was in goon hands all the time as far as i'm aware so maybe stop here before you'll have to start backpaddeling.

BUT THE GOONS

Oh thats right, they got negwalleted when noraus got banned for buying RMT isk.

Before they fixed probing, parking Battleships on a 'perch' during a Gatecamp was a thing, 'cause you had to either burn to them in an inty (the old "I Was There" shows this), already have multiple BMs and hope you had one close enough, or pray to the Scanner Gods that you got a decent lock before Downtime.
---
Russians hardly have sov right now for botting
---
You sure are saying a lot in response to very little. And KWG are 100% Tapi renters no matter how to try to spin.
---
A coalition is a diplomatic agreement between player alliances.  
---
Renting is a business agreement between player alliances.
---
There are no mechanisms in the game to facilitates these agreements. They're the result of players talking to each other and agreeing to terms.
---
Why would the most expensive mercenaries you could buy for isk *need* renters to fund them while they were still in their primetime? You're not making any sense.
---
Having thousands of members and often a few hundred active crabs at any one time work as a good bot detector over jealousy and anomalies

is it broken or what? thank you

the only people who ever paid PL any serious isk were the former botlords of the drone regions, so that was just being one step further removed from supporting their alliance on the back of eula violations
---
Easy there Hitler

how about PIBC being at 3% and being here for a few months

The deal is you can't tell bots and spodbrains apart. You may resume to grr goons now

To be fair russian renter alliances had non-russian corps as well.

Everything from flying logi, tackling, EWAR, booshing, Industry, ratting, PI, Pyfa, Exploration, living and making ISK in null etc.

Maybe you shouldn't confuse timelines so much. N3 ceased to exist a good while before WWB and tze DRF was pushed out a while after, and not by NC. or groups that were affiliated with them at that time.
---
I don't know much about those skillu renters but yeah, basically confirming what we already knew.
---
They were frat renters as well though.
---
So you frat members are worse then kwg as an individual alliance, and also took kwg isk as well.

Meanwhile, test didn't even make top 25.

He just said that people who report them are piece of shit goon fuckers, you're right.
---
Do they need to?

 Iirc they mentioned that they screen for bots and if specific names are reported, they follow up with an investigation and blacklist/kick/etc those they believe are bots.
---
No, he didn't.
---
&gt;the only people who ever paid PL any serious isk were the former botlords of the drone regions  
---
Oh boy do i have a story for you. It involves Mittani, PGL and PGL's hopes and dreams.
---
That only works if you link/associate your accounts together, which is fairly easy to avoid, just saying.
---
You frat legion members sure are touchy that frat is shown to be far dirtier than any of the groups you rail against.
---
you're going to need a lot more excuses to get 2% anywhere close to 10%
---
How does renting space work in nullsec?
---
Would leave you susceptible to a bump tho.
---
I'm not spinning any narrative. I've never claimed Goons are full of botters. Quote me if I have. I'm reading what CCP Peligro posted alongside this data.   
---
1. This isn't comprehensive nor broken down by botting specifically.  
---
2. Rental alliances are disproportionately represented  
---
I'm not pulling some grrr goons bullshit here. 
---
Why are you so weirdly defensive about this?
---
You can get rewards after every maintenance, at 11:00 eve time. Even if a day passes for you, it might not pass in eve.
---
Why do you care?   Look at the outcome.  Density in Delve - which is Goon policy - ensures it isn't full of bots.  So who cares what the reporting policy is.  The policy is about coherence as an alliance.   Most of us aren't getting any younger.  Who wants to spend spare time dealing with ratting drama?  Again look at the outcome.  Goons is really well organised and really well run.  There's a reason it's the biggest alliance in game.  So whatever its policies are, perhaps you should consider adopting them yourself.   You know, copy a successful model.
---
Anyway what's kind-of fun is people started reporting Goon bots just after *those same bots* moved into Goon rental space, even though they'd been botting for years in other alliances and were presumably unreported.  Why?
---
It's pretty obvious what's going on here: you don't care about facts.  Instead you speculate that *completely contrary to the facts*, there are a large number of botters in Goonswarm.  There aren't.  Come and live in Delve and you'll easily see that, though I suspect you'll only see the Grrrrrr Goons that's painted onto the inside of your sunglasses.
---
That's a shame.

B0T did not belong to sons of tangra -- it wasn't established until 2013, years after sons of tangra ceased to exist. PL created it when they took over the dronelands and needed a rental alliance.
---
It was named that by PL because sons of tangra helped them lose fountain and for the pun name (because even 6 years ago everyone knew what was going on).
---
I don't know where you a looking. There are lots of tutorials for eve on YouTube. Most are focused on specific aspects of the game.

For beginners I would recommend searching for:

*Jurius Doctor
---
*Disowned Hero
---
*Eve University
---
The is also an new character walk through from Scott Manley, but that is out of date now. I only mentioning it because, that was that series that sold me on playing eve online in the first place.
---
yes 2% vs what, a full on 30% of that graph that were NC/PL tributaries for most of the history of the game?
---
ITS THE CSM I TELL YA, THEY HID THE BOTS IN BRISC NDA CONTRACT
---
By todays standards yes. Theres also a lot of older storys but i don't like to take guess shots at stuff i didn't get to witness unlike many others here. PL has been in that business for quite a while.
---
There has been another instance of very serious isk going to them btw, allthough it was way after they sold BoT. About 3 years ago, i'm sure you remember.
---
Go listen to the audio, I have, have you?
---
Thats not true at all
---
We've said for a long time that botting in Delve is dumb as shit considering how densely packed it is, everyone said we were dumb and they had all this proof.
---
NC. still != PL. But you Tapi guys obviously have problems to understand that.
---
Nice 👍
---
Sure, because your alliance receiving 5% of all bans ever in 18 months is totally not an unprecedented problem.
---
Its like saying "Your honor, I admit I robbed the stores till, but its totally ok because that guy over there emptied out the take a penny tray!"
---
Less than 1 year is not a good while tbhn And it was all consequences.
---
&gt;and not by NC. or groups that were affiliated with them at that time.
---
yea but they ceased to support them after wwb, with gotg and horde they were not needed anymore.
---
Joecuster is special, just ignore him. We only keep him around for laughs.
---
HRE (volta) have two 1 year old corps with 3% (GLD4U) and 2% (MKAD) of the bans. volta has been facilitating these guys for 1 year and have 5% of the bans from the last 13 years. volta and the rest of HRE seem to be the worst botting offenders right now
---
frat has 5% within about a year and a half, just barely better than volta but still one of the worse botting offenders and BL pretty much folded into them. origin. protecting botters? seems like it.
---
this makes it look like parts of panfam/russian/frat groups were built by botting while legacy and imperium have done a pretty good job of keeping the bots out
---
Bob Ross on standby.
---
Given the recent drama with a CSM member out of everyone us players should understand what Mittani meant by reporting another player within your alliance being "goonfucking".
---
It's not that Mittens condones bots, it's that mittens knows that CCP bans people with no evidence or whatsoever.
---
Don't believe in the ridiculous out of context pulled shit that everyone feeds you.
---
I’m talking more about the forensic investigation that will determine who exactly is benefitting from all that botting income.  Even if the accounts aren’t linked, there will be a transaction trail moving isk from the alts to a main at some point, CCP would find that link and take down the main accounts as well.
---
Sure, you can try to launder the isk by dead dropping plex in a safe spot can, or using elaborate contract “scams” or something to transfer the isk in less obvious ways.... IP addresses also can be considered to link accounts.
---
My point is that if the main ever benefits from the  alt botting activity, even under another alliance, CCP should be able to find it and take down the main account as well, and so it would show up here.
---
math says five times as many for NC/PL
---
I'm always dualboxing with a ceptor in nullsec, my Muninn has a [couple killmarks](https://i.imgur.com/ytQPgxA.png), a cloaky arty Loki or beam Legion is also amazing. Looking forward to the Ikit.
---
I'll start with the biggest sized.  My favorite solo titan to roam in is the Avatar.  Because it looks like a penis.
---
Do you configure your bogroll so the sheets are under or over the roll?
---
The chart does not tell about bots, but only bit’s that got banned. This may be a difference.
---
&gt;yea but they ceased to support them after wwb  
---
Wrong. Source: been deployed against DRF renters after WWB. NC. wasn't happy to say the least.
---
Saves players time by not warping for a hour to find something to do. More players doing things means more players getting blown up means more new stuff sold. We need faster ways to lose isk
---
I like this line of logic (it's happened a few others times ITT) because it implies that we're significantly more competent than everyone else.
---
I built it with my own hands and get a mirror finish on the bottom of a print that has 120 micron accuracy ...
---
I never said it was good, but I'm doing a hell of a lot better than you are.
---
😂😂😂 It's certainly better than yours.
---
That last sentence.  Nice.
---
fafer and lady scarlet sure, rest and the fcs didn't give a shit
---
Hell, the point that mittens made in his "infamous" rant about reporting botters in goons is that CCP doesnt historically have a great history in checking their work on reports of botting and the bans from them, or bans in general *cough* Brisc *cough* and that reporting it to management is the better way to do it, because they DO check before kicking/ blacklisting. 
---
Not that goons condoned botting.
---
I would love that
---
Many times :)
---
Do you have specific names of these renter bots?
---
And I was always arguing magnitude, not "yes or no."
---
I know this guy! He is great!
---
I see my mistake. Fly safe.
---
not to mention their allies in HRE make up for another 5% from GLD4U and MKAD, both of which are only 1 year old
---
seems like frat/volta are the worst offenders currently
---
Dinobrain alert
---
Your EHP (Effective Hit Points) or EHP/s (Effective Hit Points Per Second) are derived from two quantities: your base (raw) HP or incoming repair amount and the resist, or aggregate resists, under question.
---
EHP = RawHP x ResistMultiplier
---
EHP/s = IncomingRepAmount/s x ResistMultiplier
---
However the curve is not linear, and you gain a lot more value out of small increases in resist at high resist values compared to low resist values.
---
Cool idea but ruins a big part of the chill game that lots of people like about hisec
---
Join RvB. The eternal war.
---
We pew pew everyday. And there is not such things like f1 here. We roam in lowsec nullsec some hsec fights against each other.
---
No such things like mandatory fleets etc have fun. Learn PvP from expirienced solo pvpler small roam or other kind of flying
---
Care or not, they brought fleets there. It was Cobalt Edge btw, i think Malpais was the skillu deal but idk.
---
My fault. You're right on that.
---
[Keep this in mind please](https://i.imgur.com/SXvxgC4.png)
---
Should is such a unique word, though XD
---
Over ofc, only barbarians put them under the roll.
---
That's why it's a site, you don't want sexy loot then you don't go there. No different than ghost sites except it won't suck and be hidden.
---
NC. sure, PL owned BoT for like 1 year give or take.
---
one important thing this points out is how much frat and volta are botting
---
frat having 5% of the bans over the past 13 years with one corp thats 18 months old and volta having 5% with 2 alliances (GLD4U, MKAD) that are about a year old
---
if you're looking to hunt bots you might want to look towads frat space and/or volta/HRE space
---
Wow give more free intel to people.. CCP at its finest. Fuck...
---
But you usually don't learn fits for a ship until the first time you fit one up.  Sure you could spend an hour theory crafting in eft, but for a ship that you have no experience with, that won't be better than stealing a fit from someone who knows what they're talking about.  Once you've lost a few, building out your own makes sense.
---
Eve is not a chill game.
---
We founded TEST in May 2010 almost exactly 9 years ago today
---
This topic had me questioning my gila that I sometimes dip into an abyssal with. I try to make sure to change the ammo/drones/tank for each type, but I was curious if the higher "on paper" damage of kin/therm RLMLs would actually be better or worse against rats with different resist holes.
---
I took the data and [plotted it in a simple bar chart](https://i.imgur.com/cJCrbIW.png) because I hate pie charts. Really interesting data though! Far more Russian botters than I would have expected... although I wonder if this has changed since more Chinese groups have began coming to TQ?
---
I've seen botters around in Delve only twice and as you say, they were in densely populated krablands competing with actual players for sites/rocks who weren't tolerating them for 1 second. Both times they were agressively harassed into leaving while the locals reported them as bots with every alt they had.
---
[Laughs in Triple MASB]
---
At least you had faction ammo on me! I'm dumbfounded by the number of T3C's engage with Rage. I could tank them all day!
---
I get it but some nights when I am doing 10 different things I just want to worry about killing some rats and not having to dock up every 5 seconds due to some griefer that is frothing at the mouth to get a easy pve kill. They should just add low level anoms to null and low sec with better rewards then let the pvp happen there. Currently I am playing with a small group of new players these guy are not ready to pvp and would leave the game pretty quick if their safety was taken away from them.
---
exactly what the graph says: frat and volta are botting crazy right now, test isn't
---
Oh no, it's retarded. Look dude sla is way better. Anyway I use a hypercube evolution which is a 300x300mm bed. Also who gives a rats ass about the bottom of the print!? Wtf are you even smoking
---
Came here to recommend Jurius. He is former Eve University instructor and still does some stuff for them on top of making his own content.
---
Edit: Disclaimer he is in my corp.
---
Very good read!!!!!
---
V is getting pushed by nullsec krabbers when there is +1 in local.
---
You're not going to find someone willing to print for 300 pennies dude, it takes time and they break down sometimes, the dude is just trolling. It's probably like 50$ for a print for something like that.
---
/u/Olmeca_Gold on suicide watch
---
I guess it wasn't really suicide logi 🤔
---
Lol says the guy that hides in a umbrella..... I disagree one of the nice parts about eve is that it has content for lots of player types. There should be some low risk activities that don’t take hours of down time to participate in.
---
So because you're to lazy to look at a site name it's a bad idea? And people wonder why casuals are killing eve...
---
Uh, no.
---
Just go take some of the free EvE University online course!
---
&gt; That's why it's a site, you don't want sexy loot then you don't go there. No different than ghost sites except it won't suck and be hidden.
---
What do sire names have to do with players warping into other players for easy kills in high sec?
---
&gt;Mining the moons, Not so much.
---
Hmm.. I  have to respectfully disagree on this one, strongly depends on the moon.  We run a one month cycle on our athanors, when that spodumain (and others) moon goes off we all fly away with billions in compressed ore.
---
A big alliance conquers a region of space that they have no intention of living in. Then they rent it out to people who want to krab in high value space without having to fight to keep it. In some programs you can rent exclusive access to an entire system for several billion per month. In others you pay a lower fee for access to a shared space. Rental space is popular with highsec pubbie corps dipping their toe into null, and botters.
---
If warping around for an hour not finding anything your doing it wrong.
---
I walked in here with my tinfoil had already on and a bag of popcorn. I am halfway down the comments and barely and tinfoil. Am I in the wrong sub? Something something GSM

Can you read? The suggestion is an arena site w/ sexy rewards...

Come to 1DQ1-A, then cloak off the keepstar(the one in the center of the system), and you will see more titans than you ever knew existed.
---
Look, I already explained it in another post, I put the mat cost and shipping cost can be calculated based on the weight information I put down.  
---
Some of us aren't pieces of shit like you.
---
Lol, this is before I could use T2 HAMs, who knows what wouldve happened then!

Jurius is a guy very focused on lore and new player experiences. He make some great content to help people get into Eve and learn new skills. Very approachable and always down to listen and help.

Head to domain area around 8pm cst you can go 20 jumps before seeing a single anom

Uh, yes.

I think you would prefer a different game.

Please biomass.

I've seen that.

too late
---
You’re missing that in this idea the site is optional. if you don’t like the rules with in the site (non consensual pvp without concord interference) then don’t go to the site.
---
no effect on your play style.

I rarely even visit delve what a shit clap back.

How exactly does adding a new high risk activity REMOVE these other low risk ones you say there should be?
---
You can cloak gates now?

I enjoy cheap, kiting executioners way too much......

How does letting ccp role something new out that we don’t even know the intention of yet cause mad hysteria?

Time to bling fit my ships

Inb4 u get reported to CCP for selling IP. Enjoy your karma shithole.

Looking forward to the year-to-date graph.

Hi Booda
---
We've seen some crazy shit with Heron bait. We watched an astero spot me, go back home, grab a Loki and bomber and come back to gank me. Needless to say they lost a lot more than they could have. Be sure to check out all the Heron shenanigans [here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCACeTjDk0mUFtO4PMxJ53NA)
---
;)
---
The way I read it was “make high sec sites more valuable and make them all pvp “
---
So, does the renter join the alliance to get access to the system? Or the alliance just sets the standing as blue as long as the renter pays? The renter never ends up owning the sov?
---
Yep. And then they'll have an explo bot that warps to said system, scans down the sig and then resumes ratting if not a WH. The whole process will be automated.
---
Well you read it wrong
---
I think that would be a decent "solution" to this becoming an issue, it would also give high-sec systems that don't get much traffic more possible chances of getting some traffic if they are full of sigs for a long time.
---
D
---
Cool!!!
---
The way the op wrote it made it sound like all sites in high sec.
---
Every person in lowsec is sitting on the outgate with a smart bombing battleship.
---
Take the first wh you find. Problem solved.
---
Yeah we have like 100 bots in all our rental groups, that probably all just got banned. When we see bots we call diplos, they get awoxed and kicked. What more do you want?
---
Yeah, go fuck yourself. I built my first printer and I'm not dealing with resin. I have 8 spools of material I'd love to get rid of.
---
Which, by the way, I gave away an entire spool of print models and more. numerous shoe boxes full of 3D prints, and I just dump them in tip jars and shit.
---
Plus, I design my own models, I can make any and all faces mirror if I was interested. 
---
I'm okay with not making a profit, but it seems like you on the other hand are allergic to kindness, so ... fuck right off you troll.
---
Yeah, those groups of infamous botters and RMTers have racked up SIXTEEN YEARS of bans.
---
This. They're just rental botters. Apparently heavy on the botting.
---
Naw I am talking about combat anoms.
---
Who....what.....why?
---
.botcheck
---
Any time fly a dictor on a fleet, well end up going to lowsec.
---
2% gets you called out on twitter tho
---
&gt; I'm saying this isn't definitive proof that Goons don't bot by any stretch of the imagination.
---
I mean, this is some strawman-level stuff. We all know that any alliance past some size pretty certainly has some amount of botting.  GSF is pretty obviously well beyond that size, and has botters.  100%, full stop, they're gonna be there.  The question has always been whether botting is endemic in GSF, and this is pretty compelling evidence that no, it's not.  It's not "definitive proof", but I'm not sure anything CCP (or the alliance) could provide would be.
---
Neat. I think the same case can be made for the other races too, no?
---
MSE?
---
I'm the troll? Is that why your karma is tanking like  shit, cause I'm the troll? I guess everyone else here is just "a fucking troll" too huh? I seriously think you are wallymarts at this point.
---
This. Sov renting is aids, and while I appreciate my corp being part of Test for always getting a full gang, I do not agree with all of leadership's decisions.
---
That said, it's not a democracy, and I'm still happier being there than not right now. If that changes I'll probably go back to lowsec with no hard feelings from my corp. :)
---
Imagine being so retarded that you think botters want to live in regions roamed by gankers 24/7 while competing for resources with a ton of players who lose their shit when they realize that "asdfsdf Thiesant" isn't an actual human.  
---
Botters want peace &amp; quiet and low competition for sites or rocks - that's why renter groups are crawling with them.
---
Man, to believe I was once a part of the alliance with the largest % of bots in EvE, at least ones that were banned.
---
Drone russians being nothing but bots is nothing new, yeah
---
Who's making 100m/hr super ratting lmao
---
Medium Shield Extender.  Faction or Meta, T2 is tough to squeeze on.
---
Imagine believing that Skillu is independent nullsec entity.
---
Where is this report?
---
holy balls
---
Goonswarm has had a lot of rental alliances to launder botting, and over the last 16 years probably in TOTAL make up about as many bots as one of the Russian groups. No individual group made the top 25, and all of them put together would probably account for less than 10%.
---
Are there lots of botters in goons? Yeah, kinda, but not proportional to the number of botters in other groups.
---
Source: killed lots of bots in goon space over the years
---
How are fraternity dirtier than TEST who NIP their RMT botting alliance, allowing them to big bot in peace?
---
Me and a group of really new players did a few T1s in two tormentors and a tristian. Both new players died to going out of the zone on the last room.....
---
could provide list of bans counts, by alliance, for each month, for 13 years 
---
that sounds like a lot of work though
---
Haven't spent a lot of time in the most recent incarnation of goon space. You had lotsa bots in the north, but since then I haven't gotten a lot of opportunities to gank subcap ratters and see.
---
I suspect the umbrella protects bots fairly well, and I KNOW goon has always had a policy of kicking people who report bots (source: was there).
---
If you do have bots, they're underreported.
---
Still probably nowhere NEAR the amount of bots as frat or the russians.
---
Okay, now when are there going to be more videos of eve ships?
---
No, it wouldn’t. No matter how much unreadable bullshit you type, you still look like a dumb ass. I was just making a point that even if you could get even close to making one of these for cheaper, it would still be 3d printed junk, not to mention, copyright infringement. Now do us all a favour, and shut the fuck up, you basement-dwelling, neck-beard cunt.
---
Strong and independent, just like Mercenary coalition.
---
Ah the golden nano years... the glorious fits people came up with broke the game code as much as the nano nerfs broke my heart!
---
This is only banned users. 
---
We're not supposed to be reporting blue bots so makes sense that many of ours go undetected.
---
First titan I experienced was during BoB/NC wars when my game froze for 30 seconds and my pod appeared. First I saw, yea, titan bridge.
---
Keep drinking the Kool-aid
---
Imagine believing skillu is panfam after skillu literally extorted NC. to not hit their renters and skillu and PL leadership hating eachother (ok hating is a hyperbole but they're not friends)
---
This post is one of the many results from kids and parents asking "why is math and science important in school, I'm never gonna use that?"
---
BL great deployment right there.
---
Started with Elo anti boting CSM campaign.
---
Ended with joining and defending the worst botters in the last years of Eve.
---
KWG weren't blue last time I was in test, I'm not up on who all is renting from us but that would have to be fairly recent?
---
*inserts monocle*
---
Yes but does this affect the price of tritanium?
---
This is a bad feature, badly implemented, and that serves no purpose.
---
At the very least it should be limited to neighbouring systems, to a small range (Constellation?). This completely ruins the exploration experience, the "wondering" of the unknown, and will just be used by bots and intel channels to further make the game more dull and exploitable.
---
Your dismissal of concerns for this feature you display in this comment, by itself, is quite disheartening as well. Nobody asked for it, nobody has a need for this, but let's rule off the table ever considering listening to feedback before this goes "live", right?
---
Seems healthy game development right there.
---
Look at this https://imgur.com/a/AI6vYDJ
---
&gt;However the curve is not linear, and you gain a lot more value out of small increases in resist at high resist values compared to low resist values.
---
True, but at the same time, obtaining more resists gets (dis)proportionately harder the higher your existing resistance is. So going from 70 to 90% resistance is much better, but also much more expensive, than going from 40 to 60%. 
---
Specifically, the way resist modules work, you always gain the same EHP increase regardless of what your starting resist level is at (disregarding stacking penalties/diminishing returns). For example, let's say we have two ships - one has a 40% base EM resist, and another has 80%. And let's say there's a shield module that gives you 50% shield resist. Fitting it on the first ship would give you, in total, 
---
   [(1-0.4)*0.5]*100 = 30%
---
bringing your resist up to 70%, whereas fitting it on the other one would give you 
---
    [(1-0.8)*0.5]*100 = 10%
---
bringing you up to 90%. The module doesn't increase your resistance by 50%, it simply makes you take 50% less damage, meaning it doubles your EHP in this case, no matter your base resist. 
---
If this wasn't so, and if stacking penalties didn't exist, the game would be severely biased towards ships with more slots, all of which would just be chock-full of resist mods.
---
eve uni wiki and play the game and learn from playing
---
"hypocritical"
---
Do you mean Elo anti boting CSM campaign? 😂😂😂
---
WOW. Oh my god. I'm actually more and more interested in being IRL acquaintances with Daddy Zom Zom over here, because I see this stark contrast between this ZombieFoetus trolling me, and your actions ... Jesus, like ... wow. You tried to impress me with a printer, and then when I tell you I don't care, you berate me and report me. You've got brain problems my dude. You provide a much needed contrast to people just fucking with me and trolling me. I think it's obvious now that I was being trolled by someone else, and you being actually aggressive like rabies, has proven to me that I need to take steps in order to correctly categorize my interactions.
---
So far, you are one of the worst reddit interactions I have ever had in my life.
---
PS - I literally do not know what karma is.
---
What you mean Kids with Guns?  Newsflash, when Frat held Tenerifis they also took KWG isk in exchange for leaving Omist alone.  That group literally pays everyone who lives around them or attacks them.
---
So, in your eyes Test, who didn't make top 25 in bans, but took KWG isk, is dirtier than Frat who made top 25 in 18 months and also took KWG isk?
---
Shit, iirc h-bot hunter was even around then in public form haha.
---
Laundry alliances adding up together, and a reasonably low bot count probably add together. Over the years I'm fairly sure all of goons would add up to making the pie chart.
---
Delve's umbrella makes it hard to hit capital botters, subcap botters in Delve WHY WOULD YOU EVER, and the actions of a carrier bot under the umbrella and a carrier player are the same. Rat aligned, warp out, if you get tackled, light.
---
No way to really distinguish a bot from a player then lol, except internally.
---
Dunno how many bots you have. Hard to know. More than are reported.
---
I mean, that still wouldn't "prove" it by /u/p0rt 's standard.
---
That is:
---
&gt;Or that Goons use Rorq bots, infinitely more difficult to interpret than exploration/vni/mission/cap botters.
---
Simply stating bans isn't proof enough for some people, as they're willing to entertain the idea that the only reason we don't show up is because we bot in an inherently different way than everyone.  For some reason.
---
Nice self introduction.
---
That’s what a spy would say
---
You know your corp joined the most notorious boting alliance in last years of New Eden? After your leader started anti botting reddit CSM campaign? 😂
---
the reddit autism in this comment is too much
---
I don't know why anyone would try to impress a retard sjw, go back to your cop hating subreddit, they will probably give you a warm welcome.
---
Fuck off retard
---
This is eve online. There just can´t be a tutorial series. Your tutorial is 3 months ingame time, then you´re ready to learn about the game.
---
Get some vets onto your side who show you the game and help your corp learn all the necessary stuff.
---
Frat and Skillu*
---
V0lta got tired of that boting shit and got back to Thera.
---
Goon CSM”s and CCP collusion. We need the appointment of a special council to investigate this.
---
PBLRD and IA had/have plenty of bots. Doesn't have to be Goons proper
---
This graph makes little sense. It would work this way if there were additive resist bonuses. But almost none of these bonuses are additive, they are multiplicative and they manipulate resonances (resistance = 1 - resonance).
---
The only additive bonuses i know are:
---
\- armor bonus vs enemy faction primary damage type (strict +10% explo on all amarr, +10% EM on all minmatar)
---
\- bonuses on some "light" t2 classes: e.g. claw gets +10% additive EM (50% base + 10% vs enemy faction + 10% light t2 = 70% which is huge)
---
Last kill: December 2018
---
Are you really retarded or just bad at reading graphs?
---
You kick people who report bots. The fuck more you want. You probably don't have half as many bots as frat or the russians, and carrier bot ratters behave exactly like carrier player ratters anyway.
---
My experience is empty whatever you have loaded, either kin or thm, and at the end of the ammo, or 1 shot if you have autoreload on, load in w/e ammo the big enemy you are attacking has as a hole.  Reloading times are so long that just reloading at the top of a magazine will just waste time and dps, so load in specific ammo at the end of a mag. Also, if you are only running drone dmg lows, stick to thm or kin, don't bother with other ammo types. They will be lackluster in dps even in filaments where there is, say, an EM hole.
---
Goon CSM’s and CCP collusion.
---
Woo! Glad I could help.
---
Hope I get to shoot at you guys soon.
---
It's the vets joining your corp you have to worry about robbing you lol. The guys that are just advising you and trying to encourage pewpew are fine.
---
I have made a commitment to not rob your asses as much as I'm fairly sure you'd let me.
---
where's my money joe
---
yes, you're right, i changed it, thanks
---
i get mistaken, i always liked voltas name better than skillu, so it's what i called them, it's difficult now that they parted ways
---
The renter never ends up with their name on the flag. Sometimes a special alliance is created that corps can join. Sometimes you just get blue status. Depends on the group.
---
In lowsec:
---
* Scramkite atron
---
* Dual web armor kestrel / merlin
---
* Arty rifter
---
In nullsec:
---
* Dual prop taranis
---
* Hecate
---
* Slicer
---
* Blap eris

And yet they are blue to each other while helping Frat. 😂

Solo boson pvp.
---
Is there a good way to search for other blueprints that use only PI mats?
---
Like a reverse BP search, tell it what you have, and it tell you what BPs your can make with it?
---
Seems that BOT is appropriately named
---
And this is what´s keeping me from returning to the game tbh.
---
Savage
---
Apologize.
---
Oh i fully remember. I have been doing this dance since mid 2005.
---
brb, gotta go upgrade my clone. I'm almost at skill cap.
---
👀
---
I spent a little over a year in Goons.. never saw or heard about anyone botting in hundreds of hours ratting. A bunch of isk-aggressive, mostly-afk special people who multi-box like it was going out of style.. sure. But no bots.
---
Like someone else said, that is the "gons r bad" narrative which Goon enemies would like you to believe. But if you're actually in Goons, I'd wager the most you ever hear about it is when someone is actually caught botting and gets the Delve umbrella dropped on them before they are kicked.
---
Go find some cool people to go shoot nerds with. Learn by shooting nerds.
---
It's hard to say without knowing their specific resist profiles, and harder still to figure in reload times etc., but we can produce a rather simple formula to determine the answer to that, assuming we actually know their resistances. 
---
So let's say a target has "K" kinetic or thermal resistance (whichever missile you are using currently), and its lowest resistance is "L" (assume that's for explosive or EM). Your Gila deals M base missile damage, and with lvl V skills it deals 1.5*M kinetic/thermal damage. 
---
So with kinetic missiles, you will deal (1-K)*1.5*M damage, and against EM/Explosive, you will deal (1-L)*M damage. So the question is just which of those is greater. If we solve for L, we get
---
    L &lt; 1-(1-K)*1.5 = 1.5*K - 0.5
---
So in order to deal more damage with EM or explosive missiles, the target's EM or explosive resistance has to be less than `1.5*K - 0.5`, K being the lower of either thermal or kinetic resistance.
---
I literally just logged back on for the first time in 7 to 8 years. 64 mill sp and feel so lost on what i was progressing towards. So while i decide if i am going to liquidate everything and start my grind back up, i just fly in circles in Dodixie with my Malediction. That alone was worth redownloading too me. 
---
Side question, not to hijack the thread, is eft still around? And if so is there a mobile version as well?
---
Holy shit this would end up with a dead game.
---
wtf you dont know who i am?? u must be retarded
---
What other alliances? We've packed our shit into a single alliance for nearly a decade now. Even after 2016, our nadir was 16,000.
---
Where's the Greek god Megathron?
---
Bingo... Because i was pretty much describing World Of Warcraft post burning crusade and the "boo-hoo but that loot's *"mine"* mentality."
---
Nothing is yours when I take it from you and everything is mine until you take it from me. This is a tough concept for kids today. If it's not handed to you, it's not worth getting.
---
The graph makes complete sense.
---
I'm not making a statement about a ship or a fit or a module or a type of gameplay, just highlighting a fundamental part of how the game works: that an increase in resists is worth more the higher the resists are, regardless of how that increase is gained whether through module, link, ship bonus, hull or rig.
---
CPU is the most important bottleneck if you want to run a lot of alpha bot VMs. /s
---
I'm not trying to use 1 person botting as a standard but that's how it's coming off.  
---
I'm saying, we see a snapshot of the top 25 alliances affected over the history of EVE.  
---
Here's what we know.  
---
1. Goons are both big and have been around for a long time. This report looks good in that regard.  
---
2. Renter alliances are disproportionately represented. Why? Because you spin up an account, rent a system, and profit. Account gets banned? Make another. Players can't NPC Corp characters.  
---
3. The breakdown presented is a combination of all bans - including RMT, botting, harassment, as well as others. We know as presented by CCP that historically, RMT has been higher banning priority than botting. This trend has recently started to correct.  
---
Given the above assertions, we can with confidence say Goons have not had enough players banned throughout there history to make the top 25 of all corporations.  
---
We cannot, with confidence, state this data shows Goons do not have a large botting subcommunity.
---
We don't talk about her. And if you know what's good for you, you won't either. Do not provoke her wrath.
---
Well I dove in with no hope of surviving... But it did... So I'll keep trying

It's really that hard to open dotlan?
---
A fair amount of people in the alliance report blue bots if they see them, it's not like the directorate can check anyway.
---
&gt; impress a retard sjw
---
I tried to impress a retarded sjw, but the one named Dasro had severe problems that prevent normal brain function like being impressed or having decency. That sad husk of human shits his pants and drools on himself.
---
Bro I have a real life. I'm not sure karma really changes my ability to post or anything like that, so you're basically taking away something I did not know i had (if I even HAVE "Karm") and something that is completely useless to me. I have a real life, dude .. None of my waitresses care about internet points  😂😂😂
---
which also means that the resist multipliers, being essentially the same thing, are doubled 
---
but doubling 1.66 (first example) and doubling 5 (second) can be achieved with that same module, and are obviously not the same amount of increase 
---
basically this highlights how important base resists and non stacking penalized sources of resistance are. if I could choose between a ship with 100,000hp and no resists vs a ship with 20,000 hp and 80 percent resists, I know what I'd choose. I'd even take it with 10,000 hp.
---
Don't wory. They are coming, but eck is a busy guy so there may not be videos for a few weeks. Dispite popular belive he doesn't make all of his videos on the day they are released.

Get some Force of Wills in there for the clutch 0-mana counters.

For good reason. No one what's to rat in drone space there loots bad there sight are badand bountys. Firm what I've seen
---
You can just buy p2-p3 and make it into p4 on factory planets, you will have to do the math and fly around looking to buy the pi mats you need for cheep.
---
if all these derps who were talking about how they were on a crusade against bots don't start attacking frat/skillu i won't be surprised
---
elo used to do daily reddit posts of delve bots not being banned and now he's joined one of the current worst botting groups and fights for them
---
standings = coalition membership, got it
---
They were around before then, they just became more known because  their lucridity became known.
---
&gt; that an increase in resists is worth more the higher the resists are
---
Your graph shows additive increase of resists which is misleading at best.
---
Multiplicative bonuses work the same way no matter if you have 0% base or 90% base. Say, 20% resistance bonus (which is 0.8 resonance multiplication under the hood):
---
- 0% resistance case: 1 \* 0.8 = 0.8 (20% resistance)
---
- 90% resistance case: 0.1 \* 0.8 = 0.08 (92% resistance)
---
In both case you increased your EHP and received reps by 1 / 0.8 = 1.25 times.
---
I refer you to The.Ring https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/
---
You can always fly with npsi groups that take whoever shows up, no commitment necessary. But no established group that gives a shit about their members is gonna accept recruits without screening them. That’s begging for awox/theft/spying/bads. Tbh I don’t know why you’d care about your space privacy but you’re certainly entitled to it.
---
and frat is blue to both as well when they're being helped, does that make frat panfam too mr dinobrain?
---
Nice narrative, your russian allies are the biggest and most hardcore boters in this game and it somehow makes your ennemies worse.
---
If a name is such an obvious troll then you should kinda get the hint.
---
Wait so, your argument has now changed to "Goons are botting in other peoples alliances, that is why they aren't on this report"?
---
Holy shit this is some next level mental gymnastics. Never go full olmeca gold buddy.
---
Is the cost inverse?
---
Welcome to delve
---
This isn't a bad idea but where would you get the data, from the system the bot was in when it got banned? Cause they ban in waves so the bots could have been anywhere when the actual ban came down.
---
another idiot pops up his head.  The PBLRD stats are mostly going to come from it's previous iteration in the North.  It has just been reconstituted and no way did they break into the 2% within the last month.  So lets go back to talking about their crusade against Imperium not PBLRD which has been barely going a month.
---
Did I say that it wasn't a problem? Go back and point out where I said it wasn't a problem.
---
No, that's kind of the job of TEST rental leads, now isn't it? Or are you gonna fly through KWG space and tell me that those are all real, honest-to-god hardworking 23/7 VNI pilots
---
&gt; unreadable bullshit you type
---
"My name is ZombieFoetus and I don't know how to read"
---
I would assume, when looking at isk for ticks, where the majority of ore/rats were killed. At least that would be a good start. Also will allow bot hunters to focus on concentrated bottling areas without spin and such.
---
This graph is very likely to be incredibly biased and not an accurate sample of the true % player base botting. It’s likely that many alliances here are under-represented. 
---
it could also be that delve has less bots compared to other non-rental alliances, although in my experience of hunting in delve, I doubt this is true. What is, and will continue to be a huge problem in delve, however, is input broadcasting.
---
Lemme get this straight. You seriously believe that despite the fact that your rental groups have no recruitment oversight (like everyone else's), that Vily straight up came out and said that your rental bots were both known and a cost of doing business, and that anyone with two eyeballs can fly through your rental space and see bots left, right and center, that somehow, magically, your renters are unlike *every other fuckin rental group in the game* and are bot-free?
---
Spare me. The problem is renters, period.
---
And then comes Caldari and steal Rhea for themselves.
---
wow it's almost like that was a meme and you all bit super hard on it, like you always do
---
That was a lot of typing just to reeeee about how you hate large blocks.  Also you write like you think you're a superhero or something hahahahahahahahaha
---
&gt;From what I’ve seen, most wormholers are in agreement: INIT used dirty hacks to take down Rage.
---
what
---
literally no one who was there said that afaik
---
Why would the umbrella protect bots at all?  You get the benefit of the umbrella if you light a cyno and speak up on coms.  Bots don't do that (give it time, they will one day I'm sure!).
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xiLObLFusaI
---
That’s the video that I made. It covers all 3 timers, so the initial ref the armor timer and the final one. It’s a super carrier/battleship POV.
---
Reporting a suspected bot is goonfucking, becuase of this none has been banned!!!1!11
---
Moons are better for literally everyone in the game.
---
This is kind of misleading.
---
Lets look at a 50% resistance mod.  
---
At 0% Resistance, it becomes 50% Resistance.  
---
At 50% Resistance, it becomes 75% Resistance.  
---
Going from 0-50% is 2x EHP.  Going from 50-75% is 2x EHP.
---
I'm not sure CCP could pull that data on historical bans. Do you think they have 7 year old ratting tick data? Also seems pretty intensive to figure out.
---
Some poor person is very upset. Don't worry, we'll readjust the narrative for you.
---
Should have played the lottery m8
---
Any person with a bit of education in statistics would take this with a pie chart with a grain of salt.
---
This subreddit has always complained about CCP doesn’t catch enough bots, but then when they release this chart we just assume that is representative of the number of bots in the game?
---
These are only the people dumb enough to be caught. And it makes sense that renter alliances are caught the most, because it is so fucking easy to “get in” to a renter alliance, just pay the fee.
---
If you’re botting in goons, test, or some other alliance where you have to have a bit more than a pulse to join, you probably aren’t putting your shit bots in said alliances, because if they are easily caught then you wasted time on the app process that could have been spent botting in a renter alliance.
---
Are there a ton of bots in delve? Probably not. The point above also would help reason for why you wouldn’t bot in delve: there are easier places to bot. Just saying we shouldn’t take this pie chart at anything more than it is, a graphical representation of the distribution of players whose bots suck enough for ccp to catch them.
---
No, but everyone is using it, so maybe it could be good to have something like this ingame.          
---
Dotlan is a third party tool it can be shut down at any point.
---
"probably", i.e. you have absolutely no evidence of this whatsoever.  " Yeah, kinda", again, pure speculation on your part.
---
Dude you have to realize where this is headed, just why? There are dozens of clips of Mittens telling people that reporting to ccp is goon fucking.
---
Are they, because it completely removes hole control from any k-space static.
---
If they cant go that far back I get it. I would say go as far back as rationally possible and work from there. It is more about progression rather then complaining about what you coulda/woulda/shoulda
---
Hyperspatial VNI. Cheap, high dps, damage type selectable, and you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing on dscan.
---
Let me preface this by admitting that I'm not very good at this game, and my ship selection reflects that.  
---
But my favorites are:
---
Typhoon: I stole my fit from Suitonia.  It's basically hyperspacials, one ancillary armor rep, and rapid lights.  It's great for just flying around blue space, acting dumb, and letting people tackle me.
---
Omen: I can't say I've ever had much success with these, but it's also one of the more skill intensive solo ships I fly.  Still a lot of food n, and cheap AF.
---
Legion: so this isn't as much fun, because you have to be more careful with it.  However, I've successfully hunted VNIs in one, and occasionally I can catch someone in something a bit better then a VNI being dumb.  I think I have more solo kills in a legion then anything else.
---
Dragoon/arbitrator:  I put these together because it's basically the same use case.  I'm turnt AF and just wanna fly around delve and shit up local or something.  I don't think I've ever killed anything in either of these, but I've also never brought one back once I've undocked.  I suppose if I caught a hauler or something, I could kill it, but that never happens.
---
Finally, I'm currently screwing around with a Harbinger.  Everything else I've listed here I fit kinda kitey. My harbinger fit it all brawly. I'm pretty sure it will die horribly without killing anything soon.
---
As an example, the 70-&gt;90% you show is really is +66% resistance, not +20%.
---
Of course they won't.  It was never about botting.  It's just about Grrrrr Grrrrrooooons.
---
We know the resist profiles, and the math is quite easy.  People even did it before but I forgot the 'rundown'.
---
Hymn is restricted in most formats in which it is legal iirc.
---
When you get podded does that mean you're floating in both pod goo and space goo?
---
No one really bots in brave, that’s why we lose so many ratting ships. Also this is just permanent bans but I suspect brave for all ban types is lower than most alliances.
---
Ah, so you are totally cool with being frat members to protect their botters, even though you personally feel that your alliances botting problem is a problem, got it.
---
Retard alert
---
The other answers you've been given are pretty accurate afaict. I want to add a note about *why* things are this way. Most PVP corporations don't want you to be a stranger. If you're going to be fighting alongside them, they're going to be trusting you with not only *your* ships, but also *their* ships. If it's a small group, even as a "rank and file player" you will be at times the critical difference between fleet success and fleet wipe. In a large group, you probably can keep yourself from being in any critical roles, but nobody's getting paid to watch you and make sure. Most corps place that barrier at the front door.
---
The other thing to note is that most corps have evolved to provide a number of shared resources for their members. I live in a wormhole and the corp provides shared rolling ships (among many other things). If they invite you into their corp, they're inviting you to live in their house and play with their toys. In the real world, we do sometimes get roommates without vetting them first, but it's much more common to have *someone*\--either a university, or a friend, or a coworker--vouch for them, or to run an informal background check asking around to make sure nobody you know thinks their a creep.
---
I make guides on mission running and some other things

---
Dozens?  He said it once I believe.  And so what?  Why aren't you in Delve reporting bots if you think it's full of them?  I've lived there for 2 years and \*know\* they aren't common at all.  Delve is too densely populated for that.  There \*may be\* Goons with bots in other alliances.   I don't know.  But that in itself would be an offence in Goons - if you were discovered to have alts elsewhere you'd be commissarred, no question.
---
Nope.
---
They're better for krabs, they are shit tier content.
---
I mean, you're not wrong, you're just applying a pretty silly stadard of what constitutes convincing evidence here, and have already demonstrated that even if they _did_ provide...
---
&gt;breakdown of reasons, dates, or regions
---
...it still wouldn't be enough "proof".  So, sure, it's not open-and-shut conclusive.  It's pretty damn suggestive though, and pokes a pretty big hole in the /r/eve truism that Delve is a hotbed of botting.  That is, while this chart itself may not be the be-all-end-all proof, anyone who was going around claiming that botting is endemic to GSF/Delve is now in the position of having to explain why, then, it doesn't show up in the chart, and why that reason applies to GSF but not to other alliances.
---
Impressive. You are fully qualified for long term unemployment.
---
If we had lots of bots in the north, it would still be showing here, bot heavy groups that have been dead for years are on this list.
---
Kk.
---
Bots can light and spam fleet chat, which usually works
---
It is why we are purging them.
---
i didnt think u were killah bee btw
---
At fanfest
---
 Take the first wh you find. Problem solved.
---
No, we have bots in our renter groups, for sure. We do kick and awox them on the regular tho, so the steady number is pretty low. Test is pretty obsessed with bot hunting right now.
---
Gotg ded?
---
Caldari. Fuck all that shit, you can keep it.... except this one, we like this one.
---
Yeah that has decent odds of being a bunch of bots. Can you send that to Test Diplo Office please?
---
Just fyi I was in INIT till I won eve. I'm not saying that goons are full of bots, but he has to realize where this thread goes. Also its been said way more than once just by mittens.
---
Right, but the north had piles of pet and renter alliances. Put em all together and they'd probably make top 25. Independently no; goons never had "record bots per capita" or anything.
---
Yeah I'll believe that when Logi get on Killmails
---
Hehe yea man I feel you, solidly baited. All you had to do though, was look at the Heron...

This was fantastic to read!

Sort booting slyce so he can have more botting renters in their space. Lol.
---
why would literally any NC. member meme ike that on one of their head FC's?
---
Respectfully.. No its no different than HS I own an athanor in a C2 and HS literally only R4 moons. I have all my moons scanned not a single one better than that. So no its not good. Its a good source of T1 ore yes but terrible for moon goo. And I would ONLY recommend it if you have a corp that will actually fight if something comes in and can clear the belt in a night. And probably build stuff with it as opposed to sell it.
---
Doing it as a solo corp or one or two guys you should just do hs drills. If I hadnt of taken it down the other night I would give you an image of potential yields.  They are the same. Around 1b per week in ore. Hell I can set some up on SISI if we want to argue about it lol 
---
Its a great sourse of T1 mats. THATS IT. They are the same as HS moons. I would LOVE to see proof otherwise.
---
Lol to be fair I had returned from a 3 year AFK, I didn't know what I was doing but I 100% had fun.
---
88% not 90%.
---
Math is hard.
---
Always hoped Slyce would leave sort, most of them are cool guys
---
You don't get kicked for reporting bots.  You get kicked for creating PvE drama directors have to deal with.
---
Arms wide
---
what you haven't seen the new bots that get on comms to ask for help and relay info?
---
I mean if your gonna automate it you might as well bridge in the rollers if it's a wormhole.
---
Since getting my 1st class honours degree in AI, I've been employed by the same company (about 18 years).  So you know, jog on.
---
Damn from this thread alone you look like a talker instead of a player, considering how useless CSM is you might be a good fit
---
Yeah that's basically been the logic since day 1, nobody could be bothered to fuck with it because the area is mostly worthless to non-bots.
---
He's a new dad IRL (so cute!) and also moved a few months ago. Fleets are not a good idea when you have a baby. He's still active on comms, discord, and the community at large. Not sure what a killboard has to do with it.

Someone made spreadsheet to report botters. It implied all botters were Chinese and that if they have any protests to take it to a character named after a massacre of protesters in China.  [https://i.imgur.com/liYHJrh.png](https://i.imgur.com/liYHJrh.png)

After some digging it was determined that the pilot belongs to Riorrick and he made the spreadsheet.

Open Wallet, go to the Corporate Wallet, then Master Wallet and show Bounty Prizes.  You can Ctrl-A/Ctrl-C to copy and paste it in to Google Sheets or Excel, go page-by-page and eventually you'll have enough data to do whatever you want with it, including running some basic statistics.
---
Jurius Doctor has been a great friend since I met him both in game and then later on in person, for both local EVE meetups, as well as a corp meetup once that he hosted.
---
He's friendly, funny, and sometimes wise-cracking, but he's also pretty smart and hard working. He puts a lot of thought and effort into his work, and it shows!
---
He actively works hard to improve the experience of new players through tutorial videos, and has a lot of great simple ideas for CCP to make a difference, without making the game "easier to play" but "easier to learn", at least the basics.
---
it's the only way to be sure
---
it's exactly this, if someone is botting they will inconvience a real player much faster and be discovered, killed or run out.
---
By flying around Deklein.
---
fit?  been wanting to give one a test run.
---
wow shit dragon picked GWU over SLYCE
---
I highly recommend the punisher and electrical combo. When they skill up you can get a better slightly more expensive (15ish mil if I remember correctly) fit that allows three people to run t3 electricals with a fairly high success rate. The fact that electricals remove a large amount of cap pressure and that punishers are little bricks makes them forgiving for new players while still being engaging/ chance to due if they mess up.
---
Lmao, this game

Damn who is even in Deadco now? SibSquad are only there because they can't get to DumpsterFireCo. without feeding, so Dorkness and R-R? When will the Mangos come and end sorts suffering?

SLYCE is active but it's hardly what it used to be. Being in short bus one of the leads in slyce currently we were trying to pick it up. But a dead horse is a dead horse and now that might be more evident as we go into the coming weeks

Really?  I've been playing Eve a very long time, on and off and systems have always been rented by players to each other.   It's maybe even less since the Fozzie changes as power projection is somewhat harder (though not much harder), so it's more difficult to control huge swathes of empty space.
---
RiotRick... come join the dark side.
---
Sorry to disappoint but most good (cool) people from slyce left when they saw what a 0 riotshit is.
---
The renters pay, but don't need to join on fleet-operations.

If it has nothing to do with renting I'd be happy to hear how you think saying the phrase Tienanmen Square is racist?

Well that's how other cloakers can decloak within 2000m and use prop mod to bump you. If you can get a stealth warpin in front of aligned cruisers, you can bump them off alignment long enough for your covert ops frigate to tackle it. I use this trick to tackle smug sniper tengus for my m8s and it works all the time. For site cans I like to orbit at loot range and keep the cloak button handy. If enemy drcloaks within 2k I'll use my preheated MWD and start burning in a straight line away. It's pretty hard to catch a dual nano covops if you have defensive scram.
---
Lmao
---
That’s not racist
---
It's not an issue. It's a great feature. Krabbing in NS is braindead risk-averse already, this is a great shakeup.
---
The name ”Tiananmen Square Victim" is in very poor taste. I fully agree with that. But is it racist? Probably not.
---
wOW?Really dude? you are more attention whore than killaBee.

I'm not in in Slyce or Dead Co or anything like that, but I used to be. But can we team up to get Sort out of this fucking game? Does anyone actually like this dude?

NC. responsible for harbouring 16% of banned botters and RMTers is also something people cannot deny any more.
---
This thread is great.
---
They're a botter coalition the fuck you want. It's racist against botters
---
The most cancerous strategy I've seen is a smartbombing blops pre-cloaked in the site o.o. Or the Sabre + Loki.
---
Now, did I actually say that, or did you just make it up? Because you seem to be fine being a TEST member protecting *your* botters, but somehow everyone else's botters are the *real* problem. Spare me your righteous indignation. Are you in a major nullsec alliance? Yes? Congratulations, you're at least partially fueled by botters.

Look at this retard

I notice you're not doing a lot of hunting in your own rental regions. Wonder why that is.
---
Like 6 months? They’re literally named ‘for sale-contact atlas konger’ LOL
---
Maybe rioshit got mad he lost half his space to the same bots he used to keep adms up? XD
---
I saw them in PvP ships 2 days ago. That could be the main reason

Poor taste for sure but, not really racist.
---
smdh stupid gwailo protesting the infinite power of the pla lose again
---
Yeah, SLYCE was pissed about being forced out of good space and Sort was waiting for a "good" reason to get rid of us.
---
Cynicism? In Eve? Oh, no! Say it isn't so!
---
But! I like pie!
---
That may be distasteful but not racist Sort. That ping is poor leadership though.
---
But isn’t that where lots of excavator and drone parts come from? Also isn’t the mining the same as the rest of nullsec?
---
Well Slyce was in a Dead Coalition, sooooo...
---
Never realized "Brothers of Tangra,s" initials were  "BoT".
---
try again, and use your eyes this time
---
Their most competent alliance leaving over renter (bot) drama. 
---
Sort is really a retard
---
wow i had no idea sort was a PC SJW that just makes me hate him even more
---
Its more of a criticism of Chinese government authoritarianism than anything else imo.
---
Reminder that resists are not additive. Going from 40% res (x0.6 dmg) to 60% res (x0.4 dmg) requires a module with 33% damage reduction.  Going drom 70% res (x0.3 dmg) to 90% res (x0.1 dmg) requires a module with 66% damage reduction.

STRUCTURES FOR SALE IN VFK!
---
Idk why you're suprised.
---
 STRUCTURES FOR SALE IN VFK!
---
I mean obviously you should sell them to darkness xD
---
It would be like a Chinese person putting "9/11 victim". Insensitive, but not racist
---
Search for tutorials, watch those that have high number of views and are from last 2-3 year period. Older vids might have old info. Finding good info about Eve has always been a problem. Best source are other players.
---
That spreadsheet is a dumpster fire
---
the ping doesnt get deleted from a relay if you delete it lol
---
Why is it cronus not Kronos? I thought Kronos was zeus’s Dad
---
You are almost bitter, cynical and paranoid enough to be appointed to the Goon recruiter team.
---
Glad they are finally free from the clutches of the tyrant sort anyway. Good luck, I hear snuff recruits racists (ie: adversity)
---
Ha, maybe.
---
And Adversity is in snuff
---
Yeah iirc the naglfar is a Norse boat that all the demons will ride to ragnarok on, also made out of toenails
---
Uninstall, then reinstall the launcher
---
If you want to have the launcher on a HDD drive and run from your computer (presuming it's a SSD), you could hook it up using an adapter and connect it to your computer's USB ports, then run from the HDD
---
This trick probably works with a USB too, but again the launcher itself isn't terribly large so you'd probably be better off just reinstalling
---
"Heavy hitters", if you can even call them that, are darkness, r-r and siberean squads. The rest look more like your average 2nd-3rd tier alliance, like most alliances in the game. Also from what I hear, the russians haven't really decided if they will join FiRe completely.  It's like just a "sig" deployed to detorid.
---
How would a comprehensive breakdown not be proof by my standard? I'm not holding an impossible standard. We're not seeing the big picture. We're seeing the top 25.
---
Goons are not in the top 25 of banned players. Nobody is arguing that.
---
But your whole point was addressed by peligro himself. Specifically, corporations showed here are not indicative of existing botters. Which is what people are trying to glean from this, ironically enough.
---
that spreadsheet went downhill fast.....
---
doxxxxxxxxx
---
Well yeah, they let the players get income instead of the alliance leaders.
---
We are that small group that snapped it up we’ve been having a blast with it so far even though we are a smaller wh group.
---
Thanks
---
It was free advertising for a few minutes there
---
I would guess that the ticker \[BoT\] was picked first, and then they searched for words that fit.
---
FWIW, NC.'s rental empire is Rate My Ticks \[WERMT\].
---
The russians are the real botters here.

---
Slyce joins the Imperium when?
---
apparently mentioning or acknowledging the existence of JUNE FOURTH 1989 TIANANMEN SQUARE is racist or something
---
It's a transliteration. So using Cronus or Kronos is based on choice.
---
The idea is that the site itself is a concord no go zone. Not highsec in general or the system it's in
---
There is a lot of empty space in Scalding and Drone Lands. Time to return. ;-)
---
Join horde then
---
This is definitely *not* satire.
---
I too create a new account to salt about someone's post cus I'm scared to do it on a real one. Or something hahahahahahaha
---
Thank you.
---
Pie charts also mess with my OCD, especially when the slices are seemingly randomly distributed.  I don't like having to repeatedly scan the chart to create a mental list that is ordered.
---
I bet Mittens already knew about that. Because, well, he is the fucking Mittani!
---
I Rickriot is a way better FC than any Darkness FC. 
---
Darkness is full of shit FC like Jacob Deen.
---
dead coalition living up to its name
---
Exactly , this is no different then me . Me making 9/11 jokes
---
is that the one minmatar frigate.
---
Does Slyce actually have any members left anyway? I just thought it was RiotRick and his alts.
---
Sort still trying to make GOTG relevant in 2019 and having to kick people to do it.
---
does anyone know a god way to find alliances to join?
---
&gt; Being on this list doesn't mean your alliance is filled with bots now
---
... well, not anymore at least.
---
Dude, I'm in faction warfare, in Lowsec, where 0.0 buggery has no bearing.
---
Since shields have better resistance than armor, this chart proves why shield slaves shouldn’t be a thing. You can already out tank an aeon/w HG slaves with a wyvern implantless. #NotoHGShieldSlaves
---
Quality image right there. 
---
And my HS moon spits out ark and geneise.. Geiesr .geniens...Fuxk it.  Lol 
---
Honestly I cant see that image.
---
&gt;Tangentially... I was impressed that someone managed to visit every system in Eve. Has anyone been killed by every type of ship in eve?
---
That'd be even more impressive, honestly. Logi ships, dev ships, AT ships...
---
&gt; How would a comprehensive breakdown not be proof by my standard?  I'm not holding an impossible standard.
---
CCP could provide a breakdown that was dated, specific to regions, and specific to botting, and you'd still have:
---
You've already set up a case to fall back on that is, effectively, impossible to prove.
---
The in-game industry tab (w/i the item's info screen) will tell you what the mats are used for.
---
lol what is up with those captions
---
This is exactly to protect your renter bots sort, come on now lol
---
What is poor taste about that?
---
sort falls further into the dumpster
---
It is, but those parts weren't common enough to make up for the fact that drones didn't used to have bounties for years and years and years.
---
And ultimately, that's a lot of lost value compared to other options.
---
it's not racist
---
you could argue that telling chinese people who want to appeal being put on a botting list to message a character called "tiananmen square victim" is a bit edgy and silly, though
---
edgy/silly stuff sometimes has a tendency to lead into chinese people being called slurs, which is pretty shitty (at least I've seen a fair bit of that)
---
that said, this seems to have been handled in a very stupid manner. gemini whale united is a bot-filled trash alliance. all sort had to do was sort things out internally.
---
I'm already sortof committed with my EVE allegiance, but I sent you a DM.  Would be happy to help y'all out.
---
Congratulations to the SLYCE dudes.
---
Heavy hitters lol, more like Heavy feeders i think even FCON held more gravitas before they disbanded than Darkness.
---
look at this sockpuppet
---
Alliances don't generally default to going on blue shooting roams.
---
RR was a good dude and actually provided content on his fleets. Does Sort even undock?
---
i don't think renters are good for the game. i do think the tickers are intentional, but i think it's tongue-in-cheek and/or slumlords finding a way to denigrate the people who give them money
---
i think the honest actual answer for how to fix the state of the game is to remove the drone regions and go back to the pre-revelations nullsec map. just hack a third of nullsec off and see if it doesn't shake shit up
---
it is rational to choose Ranger Regiment over Slyce. Slyce is shit compare to the rising power, lol
---
Given the claims against Riot Rick this qualifies as incitement. I hope Sort gets time for this.
---
I definitely for sure 100% believe that Sort cares about racism and social justice, and is not just aggrieved by people reporting his botter allies.
---
&gt; Brave
---
Salvage bots!  Salvage bots everywhere!
---
/sarcasm
---
One of the most endearing things about BRAVE, is their newbros salvaging every wreck on the field.  They are sort of the raccoons of Eve.
---
i make zero effort to conceal the fact that i think that aside from malcanis and occasionally shines, the rest of init's membership are a bunch of root vegetables, and i shit on you and your alliance's posting at every possible opportunity
---
oh my bad
---
i spent most of 09-14 living in lowsec not paying attention to null
---
Remember guys, goons are the botters, suck that narrative back.
---
a blob of botters blames another blob of botters by political insult. fantastic drama.
---
just wait for the YTD numbers
---
This. Moon warfare was a lot of lowsec content.

Sort Dragon will soon have nothing but an empire of dirt.
---
"Racist" - I do not think it means what he thinks it means.  Now "bend the knee" - we all know what means.
---
inflation is caused by the introduction of more currency into the market. this is why your grandmother will tell you you could buy a chicken dinner for a quarter. back in the day there was way less money in circulation and its the same as plex. This is also the same for resources, like if a town has a bicycle shop with only 12 bysicles so the make a profit the store has to sell them for $500 each, but then they end up getting a shipment of 50 bicycles so they can lower the price to $120 per bicycle. in short, the reason that plex has inflated is because more has entered the market that before.
---
XD
---
They don't have a choice, if they moved then their super fleet would be dead. People who've dealt with Hanzo in the past know he's a slimy fuck and want him and his alliance dead.
---
Oh no kidding? So when you said 
---
&gt;  We do kick and awox them on the regular tho
---
that was a lie?
---
You usually wind up joining corps that happen to be in a particular alliance. I’m sure you’ve already checked out the in-game corp advertisements.
---
Otherwise take a look at r/evejobs
---
It was a good time.
---
The tinfoil is on too tight bro

Frequently, they get in a conga line and scoot around.

There was shocking number of penises
---
&gt;Sort is really a retard  
---
next you gonna tell me you get wet when washing yourself. absurd.
---
\*affect
---
&gt;we are not in the top 25, therefore we have no,botting problem
---
oh
---
Does Sort even log in?
---
Not in carrier/super ratting you can't
---
LOL
---
Damned you Maroon Lemur, why did you betray my trust?
---
Hilmar says a lot of things, but it's still not a game mechanic until it is. I think that's a really stupid idea, though.
---
The first titan that i saw, was in 2013 i think.
---
I even took a pic of him.
---
That was amazing
---
just gate to delve, get bosoned instantly
---
Nawh poor lil retard can't make free isk
---
No? You really need that narrative bad don't ya.
---
You don't go out roaming and bot hunting in your own alliance, you rat, a bot warps into your site and drops drones and sits there doing nothing, you awox him, you ping diplo, he gets kicked.
---
Just like in, as far as I can tell, every other alliance that kicks bots, except our ratters seem to have a hardon for bot baiting lately.
---
*Don't read the Mueller re- I mean CCP Peligro's pie chart! We already know Tru- Goons are guilty!*
---
Bold of you to assume I wash
---
Not that I could ever tell. We were only "deployment" down in malia for over a month, never saw him once..maybe he was on a couple times but never seemed to be active in a major capacity in fleets.
---
i would
---
110% JSV sure
---
They're saying it's racist because it supposedly implied that all the botters were Chinese.  Seems stupid to put words in another person's mouth and subjectively assign rationale or motive. I'd say edgy humor at best.
---

SiSi moon seed is different to TQ, none of the wormholers I've talked to have seen anything other than R4 moon goo + normal ores.
---
That data represents the ALL-TIME top 25 alliances sorted by perma-banned members. Just because someone isn't listed in the the all-time top 25 doesn't mean they're innocent by any measure -- we'll get a current year one soon™.
---
Slyce will be in goons or legacy within a week. Not the kind of group that would ever take a harder path.
---
You misunderstand. I don't like bots. I'm happy to see them banned in any alliance. But you're up on a mighty high horse for someone in an alliance with just as many bots renting from them as any other alliance. The selective outrage is ridiculous. Botters don't have allegiances. They don't give a shit if they are renting from NC or frat or TEST or goons or gotg or skillu. Let's not start pretending our shit doesn't stink based on a narrative cooked up on our coalition discord, yeah?
---
Oh bother, I'm all out of popcorn.
---
Yeah I commented on another page about how all us old bitter vets used to say nearly ten years ago that if Chinese players came over to our server they would bring hordes of botters with them. I was then called racist by several people.  
---
It was a well known stereotype at the time. Based on the belief that Chinese "farmers" have ruined so many other game economies in the past due to botting and or RMT.
---
Slyce seemed to be a significant part of GOTG (1/3 of Deklein), so I imagine there is more to this than appears here.
---
Free plex? Sure I'll send him some for being a standup guy. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Yeah this is light edgelord at most
---
TL:DR Riotrick doing Riotrick things, SLYCE moves back to hi-sec
---
LOl remember when the USA enslaved all those people and tore apart their families, haha yeah good times good times
---
I guess we're not allowed to make fun of an authoritarian regime.
---
The justification was that it implied all the botters were Chinese or that all Chinese are botters. Either way, it's a massive overblown shitstorm from what I'm seeing. Assigning racist motives to what seems to be obviously edgy, if somewhat offensive bants, is asinine and will only lead to an environment in which a person can demand punishment for anything they subjectively see as offensive.
---
it is only now I realize I wasn't sarcastic enough, or you're dumb enough to think I actually thought Goons would be on the list and thought there was some kind of foul play at hand by CCP when they weren't there. You're powers, so eeeeeeeh.
---
If anything, the name raise the awareness and combat the censorship. What's wrong with that? Unless you're trying to protect the other side.
---
Peligros' prior tweet backed up our claims quite nicely.
---
My favorite tidbit is how NCPL have been profiting from the most prolific botting alliances for *years* while pointing the fingers at Goons and TEST. Projecting a bit?
---
Should have named that character TAIWAN NUMBA WUN!
---
Not like you sound like someone who would get it in, but then again i think they lowered their standards a lot so who knows.

This is a really great product. Do you know if anything else like this, maybe for other ship types, common fleet roles, occupation, etc? Thank you for posting this!
---
ordered bar chart with alliance names on the y axis would have been miles better
---
Probably because GWU is literally littered with bots. Despite SLYCE being bad most of the time, I haven't found a bot of theirs.
---
Hey Alan how have you been? A lot of my friends that gave the AT their all got nothing thanks to Anveri. Running off with the riches of the AT is messed up and shows the true character of Anveri.
---
They were quality tho.
---
Remember when the USA shuttered the internet and made it a crime to talk about the atrocities their government committed? Yeah, great times.
---
In order:
---
- Bots are programs that play the game automatically, to make money off killing NPCs which is then usually RMT'd (sold for real money)
---
- EVE's economy is nearly entirely player driven. These bots cause inflation by injecting too much isk into the economy. RMT also steals from CCP and players too when they do something unscrupulous with their credit card info. 
---
- See point 1
---
- See point 2
---
- There are many ways.
---
&gt; If their name is like "jrjeodpde ebeido", probably a bot. 
---
&gt;If their kill board is nothing but VNI or astero losses. 
---
&gt;If they always dock the instant a neut is in system and then all simultaneously undock when it leaves. 
---
&gt;If you're a blue and scram them and they don't respond (not the best indicator alone because some people do legitimately AFK rat or run multiple accounts simultaneously and just aren't paying attention to that specific window)
---
You have to truly be mad to complain about other ships having more high slots and completely disregard the fact that triglavian ships, unlike *any other ship in the game*, only use 1 high slot for weapons.
---
Yeah if anything it raises the awareness of their censorship.

What is there to trust in him, the dude is a retarded FC, was the face of the TRI AT while riding on the talent of his co-captain. The dude created endless drama within the AT team and to top it off decided to blame others for lack of prizes. He is worse than a spod brain.
---
What
---
The graph is either intentionally misleading or just not well informed.
---
Adding a 50% resist module will always double your EHP (before stacking penalties), no matter what your resist was beforehand.
---
What the world truly needs is less Centi members.
---
Wait for real or like a feature request? There are places in hs Concord won't go?
---
70% -&gt; 90% resists is not +20%. It's +66% in terms of EVE module stats.
---
I.E: If you have 70% EM resistance and want 89%~ resistance to EM, you need to put a +64% Pith X-type EM Ward Field to achieve it.
---
I'm not seeing any racism here.
---
What is delve
---
Wait where are the goons? /s
---
Running a Corp/Alliance is work, don't like it? Then don't do it.
---
CCP historically (at least since the csm was a thing) has had a bias towards the goons. Considering this and their policy of not reporting bots it kind of makes sense that gsf proper is not there.
---
Chinese government is perfectly fine, mentioning THE DAY THAT DID NOT HAPPEN is verboten.
---
I didn't think I'd have to state this but that example was to point out the absurdity in using this as proof. It's not indicative of my position on anything. 
---
Breakdown dated by regions and ban reasoning is enough for me.
---
"This data isn't good enough for you therefore all data isnt good enough for you." is a terrible argument.
---
Fairly sure Sort Cock's empire was already made of dirt

90%.

His math didn't include the eve's stacking penalties.

Help me understand what is racist here, I am confused.

Ok space friends
---
All over this thread you frat legion members are hiding behind the fig leaf of 'But Kwg!'  yea, you took kwg isk too, you still would be taking kwg isk if you hadn't lost tenerifis last summer.  
---
But I understand, thats the closest you can possibly get to something that covers your blatant and now exposed problem.  A problem that is unprecedented in size on this server.  So you'll keep screaming 'but kwg! but kwg! but kwg!' because its all you have.  And you'll keep screaming it while ignoring that you also took that money.
---
They should be better content generators. They get a bunch of miners into space, but the protective umbrella of the structure (and the ability to insta-warp while mining, but that's true of all ISK generation pretty much) means you can't really provoke a fight on them.
---
Either that, or the structure itself needs to be much more vulnerable so you can make a fight by shooting the structure (like with POS). There's not really a reason why ECs and particularly refineries should have two long timers.
---
It's still better than 'place POS, print ISK' though.

Who is fucking surprised..? Snort Dragoon is the epitome of everything that is shit in Eve.

Riot should of dumped Darkness +1 year ago. Sort did Slyce a favor imo
---
Huh?
---
Thanks for the advise, guys.
---
Seems like it has to be "go wh or go home".
---
But that won't happen any time soon.
---
So i keep being a poor beggar.
---
(And will never return to living 0.0, i hate it there.)
---
Maybe that's the difference, you live in a low class wormhole.. Our C4 with a dozen or so athanors/tatara's pull high class ores constantly.  
---
When I get home here in a couple hours, shoot you a screen shot of my personal mining ledger.  No shortage of Ark/Bistot/etc.  We've been doing this for over a year, odd that's it's doubted.
---
Wonder if the occupiers of Tibet have a gofundme for Sort?
---
Lemme clarify, wh moons only give you the lowest dirt moon goo. But that's irrelevant, wh moons always "jackpot" iirc sirs/ma'ams. So we talking a little bit more than normal or random ores deffo better than hisec moons only by 5 percent reprocessed minerals tho ofc :)
---
Time for another GoFundMe for Sort's EVE time
---
Dude same... Walmart run?
---
The best way to detect a bot is to try to kill it. Their name and killboard offer good circumstantial evidence but their behavior is the best. 
---
For example, bots will usually pull drones and warp out of their ratting anoms the second a hostile enters system, with very very minimal delay, and stay docked up until a preset time. Among other fairly suspicious automated behavior. 
---
So use dscan to find their anom and set up a logoff trap. Start with a 10min timer, then 15min if that doesn't work, then 35min. You can set up an anchorable bubble 100km from the citadel they hide in -- a real person will probably kill it, but a bot will ignore it and just go back to ratting. When you log back in you might be able to catch them in the site, but if you miss that you'll probably get them when they warp into your bubble following their automated path back to safety. Once you catch them they make minimal efforts to defend themselves, maybe using their heavies or ecm drones but sometimes not even responding at all.
---
Or they're just really dumb, but if they're a real person there's a good chance they'll say something in local at some point during the confrontation.
---
One would think the drones would have some respect for their brothers.
---
Yeah exactly, that's kinda the point, that 5-10% more is pretty trivial compared to the value of the higher value moon goo you find in null. So that within error, they're more or less the same. It alone certainly isn't worth setting up in an WH to achieve.
---
Yep, a lot easier to play when IRL doesn't suck ass. 
---
Also got my first solo PVP kill recently.
---
Don't worry I understand winnie the pooh is making you say that
---
That's what he's saying though, you don't have to dock up, just keep doing your normal highsec stuff, whatever the hell that is.
---
Can confirm, they were kicked from PL for being too racist.
---
Careful he might call you racist for using the term retard.
---
Lots of Russians and Chinese, big surprise
---
How dare you.  The wound had nearly healed.  Back into mourning I go.
---
Bet there's a gofundme set up for Sort a new comp all funded in Yuan's.
---
wtf
---
Definitely find a quite low sec system 1 jump in from HS. Look at the pocos and find one with low tax or contact the owner and explain you want to use it but the taxes are "too damn high", they may work with you because it is damn near free money for them. If you can get 1-3% tax, you can really make some money if you are OCD. 
---
I ran 4 manufacturing planets (p2-p3) in a lowsec system. That setup made around 150mil a day. The logistics and up front cost of that much material was a B though! I eventually crashed the market and the margins got very thin. Profits tumbled but not before I snagged a good chunk of isk. I had to switch all my planets to a different lower cost material making about 80mil a day. It took about a month for the original market to recover, by then I was so burnt out I just stopped all together as we redeployed and I wasn't setting all that crap back up even further from Jita. 
---
It is best on an alt so you can do all that traveling on a second screen without wasting all day in industrials.
---
You should just report Sort for doxxing and get that tumor removed from this game.
---
Historically? Maybe you and I remember the CSM a little different before they did their nullsec takeover. I remember them taking over the CSM as a bloc with CSM 6. I don't recall Goons being the powerhouse they are now like 10 years ago.
---
How does it feel, living under that rock of yours? r/eve is BUILT on mad hysteria.
---
Probably not as bad as that, no. But if anything, the current state is already too 'easy', with so many anomalies you don't even need to scan and an instant view of what sigs are in system. It certainly doesn't need to go any further in that direction.
---
This, i hope their corps don't widot into Darkness. they deserve better than that shitshow.
---
yeah, Blades, MOA, KOS all left, and now it's SLYCE's time..

You should also understand this world has xi, as well as trump and macron,etc. Back to reality ,dude

Don't have that sweet ozone to protect that ginger skin in outer space.... shoulda wore your sunscreen!

So is this Pro Rick or Anti Rick? The title leans Anti, but the picture shows him being the iconic Tank Man, so pro? I'm confused. I guess I'm just looking too deep and should be here for the 'dank memes'

This is a tremendously bad idea and thanks for keeping bringing it up.

Which of the alliances fall under which coalition?

Sorry, Chinese aren't allowed reality. Only allowed what their Dear Leader declares to be true.

Delve is a region in the south west of eve, currently owned by Goonswarm. It's an extremely valuable and highly defensible region, which has led to Goonswarm's immense wealth and large supercapital fleets developing even further since they moved there in 2015(16?).
---
Say what? It was actually bad enough to warrant legal action?
---
Doxxing goes woefully unpunished, I can't see that as being sufficient for serious action beyond an EVE ban.
---
Username checks out. i approve
---
Goons could use some more bot hunters.
---
&gt;Goons not on list
---
Lol remember when everybody and their mom said goons were harboring botters?

Join a null-block or renter corp. They will be able to get you setup easily enough.

The launcher has a built in function for this. 
---
* Open the launcher
---
* Click the 'E' button next to the minimize button.
---
* Click 'Shared Cache'
---
* Click 'Move'
---
Then just choose a location on your C drive and it'll move everything over.
---
this kind of unbiased journalism does not lean in any direction, just reporting facts
---
Delve is a region in Nul-sec that is held by Goonswarm and the Imperium Coalition.  Numerically the strongest player group in EVE.
---
I love the Blarpy and AC Wolf, they're a lot of fun to fly and they do good damage while usually living long enough to let you react a couple different times during a fight, learn a bit more from your mistakes and successes, etc. If you fit an mwd on them in lowsec you can also ruin a kiter's day or split a small gang, and then take that same fit into null.
---
i dont see goons on that list.
---
Credit to Sort for flying under the radar running the most efficient botting ring in the game at Branch.

hello I fly a lot of frigates and need many of these:

Medium F-S9 Regolith Shield [https://evepraisal.com/item/8517](https://evepraisal.com/item/8517) 
---
It's so expensive and I want to farm them for myself.  What's the most reliable way to farm these?  I'm pretty sure these drop off of "Medium" sized rats such as Cruisers/BC and I happen to live in Guristas space.
---
I'm wondering if I should just farm anomalies with MTU or grind belt rats.
---
Ty
---
lol. What an absolute pussy.
---
There are quite a few multi-trillionnaires.
---
nice name
---
Region lock the Russians and Chinese into their own server. Problem solved.
---
Depends what the bots where doing. The minerals from the droneregions is what kept the price of t1 hulls at the mineral floor in 2012. And the dronelands where russian at the time.
---
I have no idea tbh. If someone wants to play a game or two, I do not play with any restrictions other than a Millstone or something that is super OP.  Which can still be used,. For example, even if you have the og millstone you cant drop all 4 dark rituals and mill their deck to dust. You pay 2 and tap that shit, and move on to your turns next phase.
---
This thread isn't about you.
---
Does the same Goon victim shit have to be posted in every thread about botting?
---
you are too damn weak. Keep typing your keyboard to fight for your reality.
---
So first, you can't use POSs anymore. That has been removed. The way citadels work, the engineering complexes are bonused for time, and larger ones have a better bonus: Raitaru &lt; Azbel &lt; Sotiyo. They can also be rigged, and the rigs vary in effectiveness depending on the area of space: HS - 1x, LS - 1.9x, NS/WH - 2.1x. There are also both T2 and T1 rigs, T2 being more effective. A good place to start in HS is the soptiyo in Perimeter. It is probably the best research time you will get in HS. The best research though is in NS, and for optimal times you should look for joining a NS corp with a well established industry wing.
---
You obviously have forgotten about the Chinese race.

He's mainlining that shit too...
---
FLAIR BAITER REEEEEEEEE
---
It isn't eve without some good old dumpsters and sort dragons.
---
For all of you commenting that this is misleading, I don't quite think you've grasped the point of the post.
---
Yes, you're completely correct, an increase from 40% to 60% resist costs less than going from 70% to 90%. And a module that gives X% resist will give an increase in EHP of 1/(1-X)% regardless of base resist, providing no stacking penalties are in play. But at no point in this graph is a module providing resists mentioned whatsoever. I'd hoped the "+20% Resists" would be clear enough to highlight a 20% point change, but I guess essays must be included with informational graphs to appease this community. 
---
The graph simply shows what some may consider unintuitive, that a % point change in resist is meaningless without context of what the resist actually is. And also the value that is brought in terms of EHP and EHP/s from achieving those high resists.
---
E.g. If I have two competing fits, but one has an average resist of 70% and another an average of 73% it is meaningless to compare them as having "only" a 3% difference in resist without knowing the actual resists in question. A 3% difference in resist at around 60% resists is very small in comparison to a 3% difference in resist at around 80% resists.
---
As some have mentioned, this really highlights the value of high base resists (e.g. T1 vs T2) or resist bonuses on hulls as well as having resist modules with high % effects to gain maximum effectiveness from those before stacking penalties kicks in.

My client setup in a nutshell :D
---
Whatever will let you kill the most shield cruiser rats per hr basically. You are probably better off just grinding ISK another way and buying them though.

I change clients often so I keep the launcher open all times. A clunly workaround is to minimize the launcher agter using it. No spikes this way. 
---
For everyone who is sceptical of what I said: open eve launcher and task manager, watch the spikes coming after banner change.

I don‘t really want to bash on CCP for this, but a useless cosmetic feature eating up CPU should not be a thing. Submitted a bug report some weeks ago so I hope they fix this sometime..
---
1) Depends where the losec is... some are pretty safe
---
2) not sure this is still a thing
---
3) all depends on what rigs are on the citadel but even with none the tax rate is likely to be better than an NPC station
---
3-1) yes can view all indie from the structure menu
---
4-1) bonus is for rigs... not all have them so some are no different or hisec
---
Not directly no.

Explosions on both sides = a fine day.

Not my story, but a friend of mine was doing a low/null doctrine fleet roam, and over the course of the roam some random ships started helping them blow up enemies, so they let them tag along in the fleet. What started as a standard logi/cruiser roam ended up being a roam with our standard logi/cruiser along with a few dozen frigates, 3 dreads, a corvette, a venture battle fit, a smattering of destroyers, a fucking *nyx*, an industrial that had just dropped off a shipment, a few tac destroyers, black ops, interceptors, this one weirdo flying a hull tanked freighter for some reason, and a few other dudes I forgot what they were flying, and the one corvette in there was his friend who was really new to the game and thought he was hot stuff after blowing up a bunch of seekers. They ended up coming up on a *TITAN* being escorted through nullsec by a small smattering of caps and subcaps, around 5 caps and 20 ish subcaps and the morons charged. They ended up scaring off the titan, blowing up a few caps escorting it, a bunch of subcaps, and the surviving escorts fled with the titan. While they were salvaging wrecks, about 40 supercaps jump out of nowhere and the weird ass fleet hightailed it out of there. They ended up stealing around 600-900 million in loot and destroying a lot more. This was from a while ago, but my friend fondly recalls that clusterfuck.
---
Splitting hairs. We can debate "racist" vs "insensitive", but at the end of the day it looks like slyce leadership used out of game means to be a dick to a group of players based on their out of game identities. It's fun to bash SortDragon, but I'm pretty sure he took justified action here.
---
No it isn’t, this could be the biggest spin since Mittani discovered his favorite exercise at the gym.
---
Tbh, I amazed slyce stayed around that long, how many backstabs, U turns and throwings under various busses has sort notched up now?
---
First offense can be permaban, can also be just a warning. GMs have discretion and have been good about it in the past.
---
What about Charon?
---
tl;dr for deaf people?
---
Yeah maybe it was csm6. My bad on that
---
I hope CCP have spent this time to make a mechanic that is exceedingly difficult to minmax or 'perfect' like incursions have been. Death should be common, the risks extreme, and the rewards high!
---
That's pretty cool. That puts into perspective how much a bustard can tank with 2 shield relays, something like 10k dps/s
---
tbh bears don't eat potato
---
If you could spell the name of that mineral it would be *Gneiss...*
---
Slyce Pirates. Literally the same bots he used for adms and income before he lost half of his space to the same bots.
---
No this is good it's annoying to have to travel to so many places to find sigs
---
&gt; There are places in hs Concord won't go?
---
no, that's the idea
---
Same with PIBC i guess, Founded on the 16th April 2018... has 3% of banned botters in a year.
---
I've known SLYCE for awhile, GWU was new to me. I was only up near PB/Deklein for a couple of months. Most of the bots I encountered were from GWU - from my experience.
---
Can i interest you in a splinter twin
---
Hey man I have no idea who sort dragon is and don't really care. Alliance can kick out whomever they want if they aren't falling in line, provided they can deal with backlash. Just pointing out the flaw in the narrative.
---
So, not racist.
---
Dockness
---
there's legit still slyce sov in scalding pass
---
Is this what they mean by "rickrolling"?
---
I like that docking up when a neutral comes in, ignores trap bubbles and doesn't "fight back" in a PVE drone boat is "really dumb". You basically described how I rat so I guess I'm "really dumb" but I'm not sure what part of that I would change. I guess that's my dumbness.

Lots of people in this thread hung up on the word "racism". I'd like y'all to look past that for a second.
---
**Keep it in-game, folks.**

Despite what american "facts" say-guy in front of that tank survived.
---
Thats the point of my comment, Many of those who have had mass permabans throughout the last 16 years don't appear on there.
---
But then there are groups like FRT. Treasury who have beaten those older groups in number of people perma'd all within 18 months
---
yea nope, its one of those words that never comes out right unless im reallllyyy paying attention. always comes out Genesis lol
---
Delve is the home to Goons.
---
It is also a place that is full of people with biggest mining ships mining absolutely ridiculous amounts of ores, which drives their economy and makes them immensely rich and powerful. 
---
The goon motto is "too fat to fail" and now thats pretty much true.
---
I called it. When you call out botters the immediate cry is going to be "racist"!
---
really makes you think, huh
---
No, this action was entirely unjustified. Being a dick is not a crime, and Sort was just looking for an excuse to keep botters (and their ISK) in his coalition.

Thanks. If you research in a citadel did I read correctly even if the citadel is destroyed mid job you lose any materials but always get the bpo back? So there isn’t risk?
---
Will sort's csm shield deflect the consequences of the doxx?
---
He's just crying "racism" as an excuse to keep botters in the coalition.

If you think there are any leaders in any major alliances or coalitions that actually want botters out then I have a lowsec gate to Stain to sell you.

How do you possibly think malcanis isn't a potato lmao

Wtf I love riotrick now
---
I don't get the racist part either. Poor taste in attempt to be edgy while hunting cheaters sure. But mentioning an event that factually happened i don't know how that qualifies as racist
---
I think there's reason to call him an SJW, but I agree that that's not the reason he pulled this stunt.
---
The graph is misleading, cause it suggests it's same to add +20% resist to a 40% base resist and a 70% base resist.

 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve) 
---
It's currently controled and defended by the largest Alliance/Coalition in the game Goonswarm/Imperium. It has a very high density of players, and as such, LOADS of folks are mining/ratting in that area, to the point that the economic output vastly outstrips everything else in the game.
---
No, but I bet the ones responsible for the all but ethnic cleansing of the Uighurs might.
---
thats what im saying. it's literally ONLY ore no good moon goo. and if that's the point then why not Mine Hs in safety with the same equipment.. only bonus is Rorquals? and apparently they always pop jackpot which would be news to me.. but i only ran one or two cycles before i moved to Hs as its pointless for my purposes 
---
to be clear you only get good ore in Wh moon's no GOOD MOON GOO thats all in LS and NS. afaik its like this down the whole chain. if you wana post your moon's yield sure.. but im 90% sure it will be something like 2-3 NS ores and 1 moon ore thats likely a R4 moon goo

Please enlighten us then.
---
Joke's on you, I was only pretending to be retarded?
---
Interesting, given noone knows who he was or what happened to him.
---
Botting is far too inefficient for the goon war machine, and without a proper rental system is too risky to the organization as a whole. Reddit may not like it, but the truth is that Goons' success is mostly legitimate.

Don't need anymore afk morons on csm

Son you been drinking

ok exception being clearly C4-5-6 moons are better. thats actually very reassuring as my C2 has shit.. like literal shit..the exact same moons as HS
---
Ah I heard that Orcas could be used as Mobile depots, thats why I wanted one to change ships instead of mining.

I was a null guy for years. Recently moved back to HiSec and am looking for a WH group to join.

I'd like to add that theres more bots than just the ones killing npc's
---
As always, great job.
---
Ah, you're talking moon goo, i was talking mining. My bad.

Side note: Mining in HS is WAY more dangerous than mining in your home wormhole.

You have to share that fit bro!

July 2016

I do, one of the people who said that is Elo and he is running for CSM.
---
Stats note: If you ever consider putting a Prototype Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane into a fit, it's better to equip an Adaptive Nano Plating II in stead. The ANP2 gives better resists than the meta EANM (although obviously less than a T2 EANM). (Also, free CPU space.)
---
True and will probably not help Sort in re-election to CSM. I mean bots cast votes.. #BOTSVOTESMATTER
---
\&gt; **ShekelSquad** 
---
Obviously mature enough to be on the CSM.
---
No it wouldn't actually.  At all.  The Chinese Government murdered thousands of their own students in order to suppress a protest calling for a more Democratic way of governance.
---
9/11 was a terrorist attack.
---
Well yeah, there's market bots and such but since they never undock and you can't see who you're buying from until after you've bought it, it's a lot harder to notice those.
---
Sort, i think that if you are going to try and take the moral high ground you should maybe consider the type of language you are using when you make the accusations. good on  you however for identifying a cultural issue and having the balls to deal with the problem. Good luck to slyce on your new journey.

You don't so much have a platform as you have 5 bullet points that are kind of all over the map.

Hey, you guys remember when eve politics where not filled with childish bullshit, and false accusations?
---
I wasn't aware that 9/11 was the US government killing a thousand of its own citizens for protesting.  You're fucking awful at analogies.
---
First glance i thought this was a Metin 2 meme
---
Are you deliberately trying to spin something here? I am personally aware that this man survived (at the least not run over by a tank) and no one has said otherwise. But: 
---
&gt;Official Chinese government announcements shortly after the event put the number of dead at around 300. At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that "preliminary tallies" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with a number of people he described as "ruffians". Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police along with 2,000 civilians were wounded. On June 19, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded.Mayor Chen Xitong said on June 30 that the number of injured was around 6,000.
---
To get the best bonuses (without going into null/wh) you will want to research in an engineering complex (a type of citadel) in low sec. A Raitaru will probably be good for you. You can find a list of the possible rigs you can fit [here](https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/70592/1/EngineeringRigsv2.jpg). A Raitaru is a medium structure so look at those rigs.
---
So, doxxing a dude for "racism", huh? I'm curious as to what was racist enough for you to earn a permaban?
---
Absolutely not.
---
It's an independent variable, x-axis. 
---
For a change of +20% points  in the independent variable it measures a change in the dependant variable, changes which are hugely different depending on where on the curve you are.
---
And I bet all there names are l.ukh;hj;, ljhgliglg, kjyhfjktyfiu, lugliugliugl, kjhfiktyfiuyf and uytiuytiy.
---
&gt;I was only up near PB/Deklein for a couple of months.
---
I see. That was in 2018 - early 2019. when most good people saw what that rotted teeth joke of a "leader" was doing.
---
In case anyone cares for a tiny bit more info here, I am a mod on the PB discord, which if that means nothing to you is basically where all the wormholers hang out and make fun of eachother since exiting from #wormholes on slack. I only felt like writing something up real quick becuase I think the message that the WH community is blocking its members from trying to run could be problematic if people out of the loop read into this and leave with the wrong impression.  
---
There are a number of wormholers running for CSM this year ( there actually are every year, just few ever make any waves) and in an attempt to corral ourselves into supporting ones with a shot we have a primary of sorts going on on the server. To avoid any sense that we were purposefully excluding people, I added Eze to the ballot, and gave him roles so he could chat with people etc. As a candidate myself, I don't think it is my place to make any judgement of who can or cannot be there, leaving that for other mods/the community, so questions about " but Exo added him" are hopefully answered with this statement.  
---
Unfortunately, that went sideways quickly. and Eze kinda barged in and made it pretty clear pretty quick that he isnt terribly in the loop. He didn't even know what his corp already had a csm candidate ( Teddy) and his platform was basically " nullsec sucks, WH good". So he began getting ridiculed pretty quick, and it devolved from there. I went to bed around this point, but reviewing the chat logs everything got increasingly hostile and toxic(not just him, but many of the people interacting with him), and his constant demanding to be given roles and candidate status got him kicked by Cheese Burger Eddy ( one of the other Mods on the server).
---
Yea it's not racist to shit on a community who killed students protesting tyranny. It's called karma, and it's a bitch.
---
So government's are immune from attacking to cause terror? Klol.
---
Why join a corp with that name?
---
A soul for a robot* actually like a thousand robots
---
Hey nerd, 
---
Main platform is to try to provide the knowlage of wormhole pvp and pve + mechanics of living there. This will help ccp avoid impacting wormhole space negatively while boosting the positive changes that they may make. The bullet points are more written down thoughts if ccp were to ask my opinion on that subject.

Theres also exploration bots, hauling bots, intel bots, hell ive even seen moonmapping bots.

hey nerd,

I joined the corp because of the good friends in there not for the name.
---
I played with joecuster in-game for 6 years and he never said a word on comms. He is a bot.
---
I played before serenity and remember all the chinese bots tranquility had before they got their own server.  They were all over.
---
If gigx got permabanned then what will fort dragon get for doxxing another player and sharing the info with thousands of individuals?
---
"a soul for a seoul" would be better (although not accurate)
---
I just went in and edited the closed captioning. Hopefully it helps.
---
Yup. Gallente ships are named from ancient Greek mythology, Minmatar from Norse. Amarr is the trappings of the Catholic church. Caldari ships are named for animals and mythical creatures.
---
Haven't pinned down where they're getting the T2 Triglavian hull names from yet but the T1's are creatures and gods from Slavic folk lore.
---
If you're doxxed as a white supremist activist there's plenty of federal court precedent in the United States to consider it incitement.

The item goes into asset saftey and is locked away for 2 weeks, but you are correct. The only exceptions are WHs and jobs that have been completed but not delivered. All services are also paused and locked if the a bash goes past the armor timer.

They have toned that down a lot in the last year. Brave may not be powerful alone, but they have grown up quite a bit.

This is from infinity war, not end game .... cant even meme properly Christ.

It's funny tho, riotshit used those bots for the better part of a year to keep adms up and get income.
---
dota2? :S
---
ehhhh not really... only if you afk.. i haven't been mining ganked in literally years.. i mean if you mine in Caldari space it absolutely is.. but thats where i want to say a good 40% of HS players reside.. but if you get away from Cali maybe move into Gallent or Mintar space. because Hs can absolutely be just as if not more dangerous than Wh's but wh's take WAY MORE Work to maintain between scanning, making sure you have a good connection nvm crashing holes to stay safe..
---
im not bashing Wh space by Anymeans.. i actually love it.. but CCP could give us some love.. R4 moons being everywhere is kinda gay.. but i understand trying not to fuck with the markets to much.. if R64's spawned in low class Nullbears would get up every one they could and build all the Rorquals lol.
---
You can talk about it all you like but you really shouldn't hold the Chinese community responsible for it.
---
Most of those players were not even born during the event and some people they knew may be even involved. They feel intimidated by the government to not speak about it. The same way you don't (usually) say Russian players are responsible with the Great Purge or the German players with the Holocaust.
---
I don't watch superhero stuff, sorry, but Endgame is totally more appropriate for the current situation in DeadCo.

I believe he mistook the 10% for some sort of multiplier, and figured 10% od 80 is 8, bringing it up to 88%.

Lol, GOTG was the harder path.

It's surprising to see you here..
---
Why the insult mate? These seem pretty important questions to ask about someone who doesn't seem mature enough to be a serious CSM candidate, you're not really doing yourself any favours..
---
IMO every offence should be a permaban for botting :| MAYBE not for input broadcasting if it's not egregious but why play nice with them? Clearly they are willing to cheat, that's not the sort of person whose going to change their mind cause they got caught once.

I got interrupted while transcribing, so may have missed something, and not really interested in re-doing as I'm not in BRAVE.
---
Depends where but generally its a caution zone yes lol as long as your not hard afk tho you can generally save yourself IF in the event some Code loser tried something dumb.. or you can just fly Skiffs..
---
Already violating your terms with Mango huh
---
Yes, total slot counts aren't the be-all end-all in this case, but no, I'm still going to complain, because the damavik and nergal are still getting shafted in that area regardless of how you look at it.
---
The damavik not only has one less slot than normal t1 frigates, but *even if you ignore highslots* it still only has 6 total mid+lowslots where a normal T1 combat frigate has 7. The only exceptions are the tristan, which loses a slot for being a droneboat, and the kestrel, which simply swaps one of its mids+lows into another highslot *and launcher*, neither of which can explain the damavik's crippled slot layout. I'm not complaining about it's highslots, I'm complaining about its mids+lows.
---
The nergal, meanwhile, at least finally has an appropriate mid+lowslot count at 7. My complaint here is that the nergal comes from a race where utility highs are supposed to be their thing *and* is a ship being transitioned into a class that is also specifically noted for having more utility highs than their normal counterparts. As such, it makes no sense at all for it to have *less* utility highs than its t1 counterpart. I'm not comparing it to other AFs, because I am fully aware that it doesn't need as many total high slots with how disintegrators work - if I were, I'd be complaining that it doesn't have 4 or 5 highslots, which would be silly. I'm comparing the nergal *to the damavik* and complaining that it makes no earthly sense to nerf away a utility high in the transition to an AF. (And on further reflection, the drone bandwidth doesn't explain it either, because it's *being a droneboat* that removes a slot, not simply having a full drone flight - if it were just the BW, then the Thorax would lose a slot for having 50/50 and it doesn't.)

I enjoy your posts and I'm very happy that you are finding your way in eve without the aid of a major powerbloc. Your posts are what eve is all about.
---
well slyce
---
where to next
---
I was with NJED for a while, until I had to quit because of family and work. u/bluedagger is their CEO, one of the worst CEOs you can think of. I had a blast, I plan to reapply there once I can play again.
---
I’m down for an evac mission to get SLYCE to lowsec.
---
And they'd beg you in a private conversation to stop tackling their raven so they can eat tonight.
---
Up to kicking Slyce was somewhat acceptable (obviously depending on political views), though it's a shitty act standing with renters rather than allies. I wonder if RR is completely shit now btw?
---
The doxxing is absolutely not acceptable and Sort should be permabanned from this game for this.
---
Well you also arent allowed to goon fuck. So.
---
This graph displays total resistance, not additional resistance.
---
Can someone fill me in? Gosh I’m so bad at space politics
---
Thanks now it's stuck in my head
---
Agree
---
SLYCE was just kicked from dead coalition due to 'racism' there are a few other threads about it.
---
Dark and Slyce also havnt been on the friendliest of terms lately, then they insult RR who's consistently carried their weight more than Slyce has in recent times, yeah I'd kick them too.
---
Whoever at CCP decided to change the default Neocom layout in the first place needs a serious talking to.
---
Because it can be a slope for some people. Someone wrote a good personal anecdote about this a while ago in a simalar thread but basially the guy was just starting out and venture miking in highsec. He ended up making a autohotkey script that dragged ore from hold to can. It was noticed and GM showed up and explained situation to him, and let him off with warning.
---
Now that player is some leadership type helping many others and he isnt botting at all.
---
That is why GM need discretion. Because not all botting is as blatant as running a dozen alpha VNIs.
---
Why Appalachia?
---
&gt; SLYCE
---
&gt; Competent
---
Pick one
---
I have a hard time feeling any sympathy for slyce but this is absurd.
---
Well, seeing Got... ehm, "DC" losing/kicking alliances and ppl left and right I kinda bet you ll find em on your bluelist soon.
---
I hope I misunderstand. I hope you're not implying that reporting a botter in goons would be considered goonfucking.
---
Tangra outdone by Shadow?  Someone in the BOT sales department is going to get chewed on.
---
Nope, he picked Ranger Regiment over a alliance that has been a persistent pain in his ass.
---
Popcorn shortage worldwide!
---
So all those months of GRRRR goon bots and we combine for a measly 4% with only initiative mercs and GWCPS getting mentioned. But there sit NC. with a combined 16% between the in house and drone renter groups... and then the russians make them look like amateurs with 43% combined across their groups.

my apologies i meant no insult , i joined ShekelSquad when it was a 5-4 corp that was mainly about pvp and farming. The corp grew up so fast we never thought about changing the name of it.

You are trying too hard. This is about being aware of countries' sensitive issues which are results of their domestic politics. It probably wouldn't make sense in the US because the US is not an authoritarian regime, but it takes no more than 2 brain cells to understand that is different in other countries.

I don't give a fu** if I was born in China. I know that what happened there in that time, deserves all the respect to the victims. Of course, the chinese community isn't responsible of it. They deserve all my respect, as well as I claim respect for my thoughts, and for the memory of people of my country that died in the civil war and later due to dictatorship. And finally, I think that this was a mistake due to the ignorance or misunderstanding , not to being a bad man. Sry for my English, I hope it is understood as the way I wanted.
---
Blue ridge mountains
---
I've seen you somwhere...
---
80% of the remaining 60% resist hole is 48%. 48% + 40% is 88%.
---
Thanks for trying.
---
Except if either of those jokes had been made I can guarantee that this wouldn't have happened. Don't want to upset the bot farms or you might stop getting taxes
---
Spinning human rights concerns into racism is a masterstroke
---
I mean, lots of renters are on here, but it’s really the Russians who do the most botting, apparently
---
Well, my assumption is this has just been a welcome excuse to get rid of an alliance. I mean... There s gotta been some differences between alliance-leaderships in the recent past, cause why else d Darkness be on that "fun deployment for easy content" against PH alone?
---
We don't prevent our citizens from talking about Kent State, china does prevent its people from talking about JULY FOURTH 1989 TIANANMEN SQUARE lmao.  Even trying to equate Kent State to tiananmen is laughable.  You, also, are bad at analogies
---

---
I'm Jewish, you eating ham is racist towards me. Your alliance is being purged as we speak
---
But like corps and alliances and coalitions kick people because they are dicks all the time.
---
Not to condone what Sort did, especially not the doxxing, but this incident gives him a fairly good excuse to kick Slyce: Riot Rick is behaving like a dickhead so he got kicked sounds not that bad of an excuse.
---
Can you kick RHP too? :P
---
You've jinxed it noe. They will die the next time you undock.
---
Well thank you kind sir
---
Can you do like a quick cartoony drawing of my char portrait? John LaCroix

10% is added to 80%, bringing it up to 90% (it's not a multiplier). Another way to think of it is that, before the module, 80% of the HP is "protected" by the resist, and the remaining 20% is "unprotected". The module then covers 50% of the "unprotected" HP, which is 10% of the total HP, meaning there is only 10% in total left unprotected, and 90% is covered by resists. 
---
You can check this for yourself - for example, simulate a bare Wolf fit, whose shield resists are 75, 60, 40 and 50%, respectively. An Estamel invuln field grants exactly 50% additional resists, which fits in nicely with my example. So to increase its resistance by half, we need to protect 50% of the unprotected HP in each resist - meaning 12.5, 20, 30 and 25 respectively. And indeed, activating the invuln brings its resists up to 82.5, 80, 70 and 75% respectively - thus doubling its shield EHP, as it should. 
---
Before stacking penalties, each additional Estamel would double the EHP again. The stacking penalties exist to prevent abusing this exponential increase to HP.
---
NC/PL’s botting alliances have also been around for much longer than most alliances here. 
---
Meanwhile, Fraternity Treasury has been around for barely 2 years and is already 5%. 
---
Really, a chart of bots banned in the last year or two would be much more useful than this one
---
I just scrolled through 4 years of reddit posts looking for a post i made approx 2 years ago predicting this day. Got downvoted to oblivion and not sure if its neverending reddit not showing past a certain timeframe or what but Ive been waiting for this moment for a long time and to say this...
---
**HA HA! I told you so...**
---
Sort's asshole and mouth must be so tired at this point. He's let himself get dicked by goons, snuffed (snuffed == goons amirite?? xd), and now the chinese. Poor man makes riley reid look like a prude.
---
Who said anything about crimes? That'd be a legal standard, and it isn't exactly relevant to membership in a spaceships game group.

As for the second part, it looks like slyce leadership gave him a perfect "excuse". I hope slyce doesn't let that stop them from hunting.

Please show us where Brave touched you?

Off the top of my head at work. HAMs plus nos

Mid slots I swap based on the situation, but usually prop, sensor booster, 2x tackle
---
Low slots 1600 plate, armor ancillary, resist mods 
---
Also run with mid grade armor implant set. Very strong ehp a comparable set up on the legion is also very strong but if I recall correctly you dont have the utility of the 4th mid on optimal subs.

Have almost 100 killmarks with this set up plus countless assists. Have taken down several bs solo with it

I thought you were already permad here once for doxxing. You know, between you getting banned here before, the kenshin incident and you doing fucking nothing to the doxxers, and this I wonder why it is that your alliance and yourself keep repeatedly getting involved in doxxing. Its almost like at some point you cant hide behind being an inept retard anymore. Youve apparently "accidentally" doxxed three different times now and harbored well known doxxers. I fucking hate having you in the same community as myself.

kids with guns are less than half of FRAT at 2% and have been around twice as long taking them completely out of the same league as Frat's rate of bot bans given their time in game.

Asher - FYI I have upvoted you. There's always a first. I will take your questions, redditers. I will be delayed in some responses, I'm actually flying around the Asian region.
---
Base resists don't apply stacking penalties to the first resist module you fit though. So in your example, fitting that 50% resist mod would bring both ships up to 200k EHP. You would be correct in choosing resists over raw HP, but not for that reason - resist tanks just respond better to reps both internal and external since they bypass resists anyhow. So a logi ship healing 1,000 HP/s will heal the first ship by 1,000 EHP/s, but the second one by 5,000 EHP/s

fraternity treasury seems to be in a class of their own, but there's no question that when it comes to toleration of eula violation by major 0.0 alliances, nc/pl are by far the most egregious offenders when it comes to contributing to and protecting botting in eve

But I'm talking about a module that provides 50% resists, on top of an 80% base resist. What are you talking about?
---
Where do I send the refund form to get my 2 minutes back?

You literally have no clue what you're talking about. Must be a line member. Feel free to read my previous posts regarding the structure of the rental program as I don't have time to spend rehashing it for you.
---
Further, CCP is fully aware, I do love the pathetic blame shifting attempt you just made though. Yea, it's "my fault" Noraus does those things and I got tired of dealing with it XD keep up your ass kissing and bot apologizing. your overlord will appreciate it....briefly.

do you really need to pound in wedges to break up an alliance led by sort?

As I said it doesn't take more than two braincells to see why when the government prevents you from talking something, that issue becomes sensitive in that country. It's about respecting others' sensitivities and you clearly lack the capacity to do so.
---
Just because the American government doesn't censor Kent State, doesn't mean the events themselves differ in nature. They differ in scale and aftermath and a lot of other things, but in the end it's a government firing on its own people. But that's beyond the point. It's like when talking to a Trump supporter friend and you don't want to badmouth Trump, or like raise the issue of Trump's tax returns. 
---
And you are really trying this too hard --- why would me, a fucking goon who absolutely despise GotG for their lack of spine, be an apologist? If you see my comments as an apology, then you probably have no understanding of it.

Sort is a moron, has always been a moron and will always be a moron (with a giant ass wife.) He should be banned for this.
---
But it isn't illegal to disclose the name of an individual. It also isn't illegal to say something about an individual that may cause others to do something beyond your control. 
---
The only way he would "get time" for any of this would be if he said something like "this is blah blah, he hates Chinese people, you should find find him and hurt him."
---
If Slyce memed Germans or worse, Jewish people with Holocaust, they would have been kicked too and this subreddit would be more supportive of Sort.
---
It's kinda shitty for Sort to side with renters but like, it's not like Slyce didn't hand him the excuse. In any case saying that the Chinese community should be shit on because of this is pure bullshit.
---
&gt;Yea, it's "my fault" Noraus does those things and I got tired of dealing with it
---
So you admit it then, perfect, no need for a trial if you'll admit your guilt so readily.
---
&gt;You literally have no clue what you're talking about. Must be a line member.

I know you were trying to sell FAX to Fraternity/WinterCo. at under the mineral value by building your moon network and then taking the non-moon mats for free to offset the costs. Quite ingenious really, especially with the tax on top of the moon goo.

" for using slander while hunting bots! " mentioning a slaughtering of citizens by another countries government that is record as having happened is now slander? Does sort even know what the word racist means?
---
&gt;If you're doxxed as a white supremist activist there's plenty of federal court precedent in the United States to consider it incitement.

&gt;Especially when the claim is false.

Link just one decision where an individual's identity was released, where the person who released it simply disclosed that person's identity without a call to an illegal act.

I don't want "plenty." I want just one.

Also, US court decisions have no impact on Sort Dragon since he isn't American and doesn't live in the US. (But go ahead and link it either way.)

probably sort trying to avoid drama of other people pushing back on his stupid decision by accusing them of something he thinks will get people on his side of the argument. Its not racist at all.

---
The simple fit is 4x dual light beam IIs, small cap battery 2, t2 ab, 2x small  armor repair,small polycarbon engine housing, 2x small nano pumps, heat sink IIs, and a damage control.
---
There's really no low Sort won't stoop to to maintain his space importance, is there?
---
Acts of terror absolutely.  One perpetrated by a government on its own people and now being censored by that same government.  Any opportunity that arises to bring it up should be taken advantage of.  That isn’t racism, that is reminding Chinese nationals that play this game that this is what is happening to them.  
---
And that’s enough of me bringing work into my gaming forum.
---
WHOA WHOA whoa there bud... that narrative is against ANY and ALL current meta and you need to take that right back and shove it up the REAL stain-gate where most your shit comes from friendo!
---
u r so dumb ... for real :)
---
nothing left to waste
---
The racism/doxxing is obviously pretty fucked up.
---
But I dont think it's fair to shame Shartdrag0n for casting out people who report blue bots because almost every group with renters/botters in their own ranks have a similar "dont report blues for xyz" rule.
---
It shouldn't be. I got bored after I could only play warships with actual humans about an hour a day.
---
Also I apparently gravitate towards games with too many fucking bots.
---
This is the question that really matters, someone just got banned for nothing now sort goes and publicly doxes someone to a whole alliance when do we see a response on that?
---
I take pride in neither Horde nor Beanstalk being on that list.
---
Slep, drek, phantasm

Thanks man, didn't notice that

Your not allowed to report bots in goons though :bigthink:

Hopefully they move their supers and titan to lowsec to stand on their own, I hear BlackRise is a good place for content.
---
How is "mentioning Tiananemen Square" racist?
---
No shit.
---
You're a fucking moron, Sort. I'm ethnic Chinese born outside of China, and it's 100% *not* racist to mention Tiananmen. It's a crime against humanity to try to ignore that it happened, and I in fact want *more* people to bring it up. You don't get to speak for me on what is considered 'racist' to me.
---
Oh yep I still fly my blaster proteus, but it's just not as good as it used to be.
---
Yup! Technically neither spelling is "correct", since the ancient Greeks did not use the Latin alphabet. The correct spelling is "Κρόνος". How you translate that into the Latin alphabet is a matter of taste. K for kappa seems the obvious choice, but the Romans usually translated it as C (which they always pronounced like we pronounce K), and their preferred spellings are what most frequently get used in modern English.
---
Wow. So weird to see Riot in this Drama. I remember when he was just doing spectre fleets back in the day! Fun stuff.
---
There are about 5 people that if CCP banned would make Eve fun again. Sort Dragon (TAZERFACE!!!) is one of them.
---
Making an open stand against Botting always leads to bad things when Coalition Leaders are on the ISK teat.
---
Remember the Goon fireside chat where Mittens flatly told Goons to not report Botters?
---
Apparently, Rick didn't even ask permission -- he just went out and did it, with this the end result.
---
LEAVE BRAVENY ALONE!!
---
There arent many left anyways. Not many active ones at least.
---
Just an observation, but you seem to be the ones getting purged.
---
It's quite simple.  
---
Resistances are a percentage of 100 minus your current resist.  
---
So if you started with a base of 0% then fitted a module that gives 50%, you get to add 50% of (100-0). Which in this case is 50%.  
---
If you then added another 50% module of the same type (ignoring stacking penalty), the formula is now: add 50% of (100-50). Which adds 25% from this module, giving a new total of 75% resistance to that damage type.

---
Well he at least didn't threaten Riots hands so hes good probably.
---
You would ban someone and possibly lose a new player for using a small macro over something minor like that?
---
The warning did plenty well in keeping him on the right path. Excessive zero-tolerance policies like you are proposing are almost always ineffective because they are one size fits all, which means they fail for the majority of cases.
---
The GMs having discretion means they can ban the blantant botters with no warning and rehabilitate the players who can still be saved.
---
Remember when Eve was a no-fucks-given game?? You could put the most racist, hateful, Saw/Hostel content in local and everyone would just laugh.

So then anyone not white can shit on all Americans that are white because of slavery by dumb rednecks over 100+ years ago?

---
It's not right.

How is the human race supposed to learn from their mistakes they have made other than making sure history remains history.

And if it comes up in a internet spaceship game to callout cheaters what's the problem with that?

He explained his logic to me on this, that it is like Germans they get upset about Holocaust memorials. So we agreed to disagree. I refuse to apologize for having a memorial account open up before the vigils in the coming days.

---
Reminder that despite being a relatively new group of players, two chinese alliances make up 8% of all botting bans in the history of EVE.
---
Goy away.
---
It's still a well-known stereotype and I still get called racist for mentioning it. Some nerd was lecturing me the other day about how all alliances have bots and singling out the Chinese alliances for it is racist.

Yeah, I understand that TEST loves a narrative and since you've been getting your asses handed to you since you picked this fight, you've been lacking one - but this isn't it. I'll keep screaming "kwg" because it reveals what flagrant white-knight wannabe hypocrites you are, then you will surrender in this war (because your alliance is pathetic) and we'll go back north, and everything will be as it was.
---
You're really trusting a GM's discretion there in my experience the GMs in eve blow :P
---
And yeah, I rather have a zero tolerance against botting and living with the really rare cases where someone is botting and doesn't know it's against the rules, would change their ways if they got suspended instead of permabanned, and then quit if got permabanned.
---
That'll do it.

I guess this is where we get when dinos run out of arguments. Go back to Vily, he'll tell you what narrative to spin today.

---
Slyce, welcome to the Imperium. You know the drill, its BYOK, Bring your own keepstar!

Is it a new copypasta ?

The crybullies are trying to push the notion that racism towards that race doesn't count anyways.

yeah, it is the video I've also watched. 30 years pass by, but the fact is still ambiguous.
---
I'mma try this out. Is the second rep needed?
---
Yeah but the neuts still have optimal and falloff and they chase you at 30+ km from memory.
---
Wait, Germans get upset at that? Everything I've heard is the opposite if anything they are overly apologetic.
---
The south is also valuable in terms of npcs/salvage etc, but I don't know enough about moon distribution etc to actually be able to compare their values directly.
---
It isn't. It just lets you know who Sort is beholden to.
---
I don't think it's falling apart tbh. As long as the Chinese and Siberian Squads help protect the AU tz timers, it's a little harder to uproot them.
---
It took you 2 minutes to read that? You in remedial reading class still?
---
Please dont compare Germany to China, who totally deny Tiananmen. Or Turkeys Genocide on the Kurds. If one country is paying for his sins, then its germany. We are simply bored that every start into a conversation is "Nazi".

We accept our guilt, and we try to get over our sins. It's not like America, who still got many excuses for slavery and the genocide of the native americans.

---
No, but it is has a mole.
---
The only sensitivities are to the Chinese government. Which literally doesn't let its citizens know about Tiananmen. 
---
Naming a character or spreadsheet after Tiananmen is mocking the Chinese Government efforts to erase even mentions of the incident. 
---
If the U.S. blocked searches of 9/11 or Kent and then a guy in another country made a character named after that I'd assume it was about mocking the U.S. government censor, not the people or victims of the incident itself.

---
I hope they keep banning them. No mercy to botters, fuck em all.

Stay away from those systems in Delve that don't have gates. Secret systems put there by the devs back when BOB lived there.
---

---
Genocide on the Kurds ? Dafuk you on about
---
The difference is that people actually get in jail for these things. 
---
See, it's obvious these won't be as much as a problem **if** there aren't people still put in jail every year for talking about those things. Like in Francoist Spain, the horrors were kept hush hush for a generation **because people get in real trouble for it**. What you are saying is like people should just defy the government and talk about it regardless, while you sit in the comfort of your room knowing none of these will ever get to you.
---
Yes, history should never be erased, but you are blaming people for keeping to themselves and not willing to risk... A whole ton for a spaceship game. Like in Francoist Spain people don't forget that easily and you don't need to present yourself as the saviour of history. 
---
The politics aside, do you really think Rick is free of guilt? He picked this incident specifically because he knew it is offensive to a group he thinks are botters. In any case, to call a botter report account Tiananmen Victim is such low taste as it undermines the actual victims' struggles and is an utmost disrespect towards them. But he picked it not because he want to save history, to make a political point or something, but because he wanted to insult someone based on not their actions (Notting) but their nationality.

I tend to be expecting the disasters by nature :D But from what I ve seen in Deklein before my "be out here in 24hrs!"-sentence and what I heard so far from various contacts I still have... I doubt they ll make it for long as a coalition. I kinda expect em to fold into gewns, especially after that one day when Sorty came from some EVE-event and praised in alliance discord what a great person Mittens is...
---
Ban renting CCP.
---
&gt; He explained his logic to me on this, that it is like Germans they get upset about Holocaust memorials.
---
That is fucking retarded. Literally every German I know who has mentioned the Holocaust doesn't get *upset* about memorials. They're more interested in having reminders *not* to pull such stupid shit again.
---
You shouldn't have agreed to disagree with Sort. You should have crucified him and exterminated everyone who knows him (株连九族 aka execution of nine relations, aka living parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, siblings-in-law, uncles and aunts, cousins, spouse and spouse's parents) because that's what imperial China used to do, and it's obviously racist to disagree with just how barbaric that act was.

SLYCE was the most competent alliance in GOTG and was kind of being viewed as a likely successor to take the reins at some point.
---
This is dumber than anything GOTG has ever done, and will probably cost them more than anything else. Sort has cozied up to all the wrong people.
---
I hope SLYCE lands on their feet. RiotRick is an alright dude and deserves better than this. But where do they go now? Scalding Pass, I guess?

---
You are mostly right, but Rick made the account with this name not because he wanted to mock the Chinese government, but because he wanted to insult those players for their nationality not their actions (botting).
---
That and if the US government is going to put you on a trial because of your words/reading material, you will be defensive too. See: McCarthyism.
---
In any case I am just saying what Rick done is not impeccable and it does make him a bit of a dick for Sort to side with the botters. Doesn't make Sort's action less shitty though.
---
well government fked up and has been trying to cover it up. if anyone wants to speak about it, they simply put u in jail. so stop blaming this on us. I'd rather live silently and feed my kids instead of asking them to visit me in jail every fking week. im not sure they deserve to be kicked or not. but making fun with an account name is just stupid.

it's not the phrase, but using it in such a sheet in that way is surely implying that its a problem specific to chinese. The whole overreaction over it is quite sad but even sadder is people pretending to not understand basic implication (or they're just dumb who knows). If for some reason it's still hard to understand ask yourself why people sperged out over 1488 gas in cargo and called it racism too.
---
and no i'm not getting into the whole "oh racism but chinese isn't a race" cause if we're getting to use the term correctly it wouldn't be used in the first place anywhere.

&gt; Once you catch them they make minimal efforts to defend themselves, maybe using their heavies or ecm drones but sometimes not even responding at all.

To clarify my earlier statement: What I meant was Sort managing to avoid the focus of the community, which has been directed towards NC, Goons And TEST renters.
---
Look at the population of Branch, its ratting numbers are  like ~half of that of Delve.
---
Do we honestly know that is what Riot was going for? He was making a dumb joke. I flew under some of his fleets years and years ago long before this and he never came across as racist although it's not like I hung out with the guy out of fleets.

Then there was the time boat was chatting in a fleet about how Russia Jews burned better because of their natural vodka content....so yeah.

Keep in mind that very few Americans owned slaves. All slave owners were democrats. A large number of republicans died in the war to end slavery.  
---
Also keep in mind that there is no such thing as native Americans and the various tribes also killed each other to the point that some tribes ceased to exist .They killed their way to dominance and were removed in the same fashion, although not to extinction as was the fate to those they replaced.
---
 Slavery was never as much a part of America as it has always been, and continues to be in Islamic countries. How about we focus on ending that?

Does anyone actually have that rule? I've seen Test people ask for names of bots, I know horde specifically asks for people to report bots, I've seen Lady Scarlet ask people to report botting renters. Frat allegedly had a few people dedicated to taking reports of botting renters (although we see how well that turned out)… It seems like almost everyone in the game at least claims to welcome reports of blue bots.
---
There are only 1600 cards, so it is not a smart bot just one that knows all 1600 solutions.

Great suggestion. Also I use buy with Corp wallet and they all are delivered to Corp deliveries hangar.
---
Yep, WH PI is super good.

I'm too lazy to do it personally but corpmates are making billions/month just on PI

Am German no problem with any memorials about what happened back then whatsoever it is fine to remember. Only thing that is a problem is when people implicate I should feel responsible for what happned even if being born 50 years after it ended.
---
Yes! I miss the days when we had to drop probes manually across a system and scan. /s
---
Do agree though, as someone who played back in the day and sits from the stands this game seems to have been dumbed down a bit.
---
someone in slyce made a character named 'tiananmen square victim' to take complaints from people they thought were botting. dork thought this was racist and kicked them from gotg
---
I think 10 is the most I ever did in a day
---
I never said he was racist. It was a dumb or an insensitive joke, that's it. I am just saying the negativity against the Chinese community for an incident they can't possibly be responsible for is misguided. This was simply Sort kicking Rick because he harmed the botter income, just that Sort got the excuse handed to him by Rick. Doesn't make Sort's action less scummy.
---
le parties never change meme and whataboutism in the same post, impressive
---
Would be nice, but in the mean time, if you buy stuff with a corp it always ends up in corp deliveries, which is handy.
---
That is just wrong. There are some, but not many. You are aware that denying the Holocaust is a crime in germany? So please dont make it sound like something that happens all the time
---
But that's precisely why it does get talked about, outside of China.
---
It's important that the Chinese government's efforts to sweep the massacre under the rug is not forgotten. And as such, the social pressure applied in reference to Chinese players is an effort to further that goal.
---
To ensure that not only does nobody forget, but such that it is known to not be forgotten.
---
It's not about blame. It's about ensuring the memory lives on, and hopefully brings about change in the future.
---
Nah. These days its only legal in Legacy, Vintage and Commander because of it's age, and it's unrestricted in all of them. Only time it was ever restricted was standard, but that was 1996.

TBH, by the standards of modern spells, hymn is just strong, but far from a restrictable card (and TBH, WotC rarely restrict in Legacy or Vintage anymore because they don's support vintage at all, and only like 2 bit legacy events a year).

Ranger Regiment allegedly generates over 80x the Ratting Revenue that SLYCE does. From a pure taxation perspective, who would YOU rather have in your Coalition?
---
It's not technically untrue either though.
---
Most of those groups above were primarily renter groups where was there was/is no real oversight on what happens, whereas in a "normal" alliance regular members ratting and general activity dissuades botters.
---
The whole Nixon, or just his dick?
---
Docking up is fine, but it's pretty suspicious if you do it the instant a neut jumps in. The few seconds between a neut jumping in and you reacting (as you will most likely not watch local the entire time) is where most kills happen. 
---
Why would you ignore a trap bubble with no neuts in system? I usually keep a cheap frigate around in my ratting pocket for if there's ever any unwanted things set up.
---
Fighting back, in this case, would be putting drones on the hunter and calling standing. Alternatively, if the hunter is currently setting up a login trap or is probing your behavior you, as a human, notice that one neut jumping in and out of system unusually often or logging off and reappearing after 10 minutes or so. At the very least you wouldn't just sit there and take it without even moving.
---
And at last, just reacting in local is a very clear indicator that you are not a bot.
---
I don't remember hearing people say the Kiki would be garbage. I remember people being amazed at how much dps it did at range when discussing it on reddit. Personally, as soon as I saw its speed I knew it would be amazing.
---
You can't sell out of a container, so why should you be able to buy into a container? The main inventory is where your items are market accessible.

If you have too much clutter, get some Station Containers and organize your crap. Then you can buy and sell, and it won't disappear into the mountain of junk.

lol, actual whataboutism. nobody brought up political parties, he said americans. and anyway the democrats were the party of the south at the time, and lost the south over civil rights. the former slave states are today predominantly republican, and your retarded glossing over that fact shows just how disingenuous you are.
---
parties change over time.  They change over 20 years, let alone 150 years.  the democratic party of today has a far harsher stance against racism than the republican party does.  the south went from democrat to republican in a large part due to democratic presidents pushing through civil rights.

I think your group were playing millstone wrong. OG millstone was a mono artifact. It was a rule even in the early days that you had to tap a mono artifact when you used it (as opposed to poly artifacts, which didn't tap).

Bots are not blues, they are a cancer upon the game. SLYCE and Deadcoalition I know for sure have officially had a zero tolerance policy for bots--if you can prove it to diplo, they'll greenlight awoxes and purge. Some of the non-botter Chinese dudes I flew with in SLYCE actually were pretty zealously torching bots in some of the other renter groups.
---
&gt;So then anyone not white can shit on all Americans that are white because of slavery by dumb rednecks over 100+ years ago?

You say that like it isn't already the case. To some people, bias and bigotry are only problems in *some* circumstances.

The game could use more stories like this one. Thank you for sharing!

---
Eh, I'mma go with a "no" on that my dude.

Slavery sucked. Treatment of Native Americans sucked. We should acknowledge it sucked. There's nothing wrong with saying that a lot of things sucked.
---
It's important to know that everyone sucks. It's more important to know that "everyone" includes you too.
---
Saying the same thing over and over again doesn't make it true.
---
CCP could make slight variations in the names of the rats every week or so. Nothing that would bother a human. I assume that it would mess up a program that has to be exact spellings.
---
By that logic black people in the USA cannot comment on apartheid being racist, because they weren't born in Africa.  
---
I think you need to look up what the word "Racist" means.
---
"Please do not violence boat"
---
Doesnt suggest that at all dumbass.
---
CCP not taking action on this might imply some level of support for it, which would mean we'd be about to see a bunch of bans for "offensive speech" handed out to people who use the word "Tienanmen" in chat.

It is...

I'm not gonna pretend I know how botting works, only from what's been told to me. I think they mostly identify types of ships (cruiser, bs, dessies, etc) so names mean nothing. I could be wrong

&gt;But I dont think it's fair to shame Shartdrag0n for casting out people who report blue bots because almost every group with renters/botters in their own ranks have a similar "dont report blues for xyz" rule.

TL;DR: Don't call out shitty behaviour because "everyone else" engages in it too.

Nice logic. ;) As long as it's convenient for China, it's easy for the mainlanders to claim overseas Chinese are 'one of you'. We still don't forget how [Huang Huikang tried to pull](https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/one-mans-meat/2015/10/03/when-china-sneezes-malaysia-coughs-while-some-stress-on-noninterference-others-say-china-is-a-superp/) what Putin did to Georgia and Ukraine on "shared languages and cultures". 
---
I also don't forget how I went to college in Baltimore, and some mainlanders tried to get me to help them cheat on exams and papers. When I refused, the same mainlanders called me a 'race traitor' and 'traitor to China'. 
---
So am I *really* Chinese or not, or am I only when it's convenient for you? The overseas Chinese despise mainlanders for good reason.
---
&gt; The difference is that people actually get in jail for these things.
---
Bullshit. No one is going to jail because SLYCE made an out of game bot report spreadsheet named "Tiananemn Square Victim".   
---
And even if they did, the Chinese government would be to blame and definitely Not SLYCE.  
---
The same government that murdered those student. Maybe you should be mad at that, instead of SLYCE.
---
&gt;1488 gas in cargo
---
That's fucking hilarious. I'll have to fly that around sometime. ;)
---
Being someone who was in GOTG (Darkness and Slyce) i can say with confidence that Sort was just looking for any excuse to kick slyce from GOTG. And especially with the acquisition of Jhannis Glannath to Darkness, Slyce has nothing more to offer in GOTG. So all I take from this is Sort finally being able to get rid of dead weight aka Slyce.

"Going after botters leads to racism, therefore it's CCP's job and not ours to go after botters."
---
Nice slippery slope to force a point. Almost like yet another alliance leader who wants to benefit from botting taxes as long as it lasts.
---
They don't appear on the chart because they didn't make as much of impact to the number of banned botters on the chart. Goons clearly aren't botting that much and the don't appear to be facilitating it either..
---
My greatest achievement so far. Hope all is well, I miss scanning.

You are putting a scorpion in your pocket sorticus.and that scorpion will posion you in the future.

There is a difference between discussing the tiananmen topic and label chinese with that. I probably know much more details than 99% of the people  here since I care about what happened in my country and open to discuss that with any person. But I'm still feel offended when TEST spam tiananmen square in local. I consider that as retarded but many of my chinese friends consider this as raciest. We can always debate whether my Chinese friends have the wrong definition of raciest. But my point is, DavlosEve didn't grow up in Chinese culture and has no connection to China as a country. What he feels is very different from people live in China. He can very much represent whether foreign-born chinese feel this is raciest but cannot represent what majority Chinese feel about this.
---
I wanna step in here... The single dudes in GOTG/DC I ve played with have been pretty decent people. The leadership though... \*makes a vague gesture\*
---
Please point out exactly what is racist as some of us might not be aware of what some things may represent?
---

Your feelings don't matter. :) You only get to feel what Xi Dada tells you to feel.

I thought it was xi jinpooh
---
First, stop using up all the tin foil.
---
Second:
---
&gt;I can hardly believe that general player in Goons, TEST or HORDE are completely different from drone region players since they ratting 24/7.
---
There are players at the keyboard doing that.  If someone is botting, those players are going to run into them.   
---
 And nothing angers a krab like competition.  A bot is easy competition to eliminate, since leadership will happily help you kill and kick them.
---
Botters need quiet space to thrive.  That isn't Goon, TEST, or Horde space.  It's renter space.
---
Really makes you think, huh?
---
&gt; many of my chinese friends consider this as raciest
---
They may think it is racist, but it is not. Something isn't racist just because you're angry.    
---
What is racist however, is telling /u/DalvosEve that he is not not Chinese, because he's born outside of China. That's a cunty thing to do.
---
This is like saying "It's not your job to help a girl which is raped, let the police handle it after the rape is finished". WTF ? This guy is still running or he is CSM ?
---
I think the Momus would be funnier ship  name.
---
The point being is he removed an alliance because members of it kept a spreadsheet of botting renters that sort was basically profiting off of. So instead of just saying that he throws racist out to try and mislead!
---

Man... I'd love to come in and show them a 2019 legacy dredge deck. Dredge is usually described as being "as far from true magic as you can get while still playing magic". It's a dumb deck that can work as a hyper aggro combo deck that can kill on like T2, or a slow, grindy deck that literally runs no mana.
---
&gt; Almost like yet another alliance leader who wants to benefit from botting taxes as long as it lasts.
---
If you are talking about Mittens, you may have missed a memo
---
sorta like implying Americans should feel responsible for slavery, native American genocide, even world wars they were not personally involved with, nor even alive for?
---
He is running.
---
I think the real meme is you unironically trying to make the claim that "the parties switched places" because you can't handle the uncomfortable reality of history.
---
It is racist by implying that its only the Chinese that are being targeted by this spreadsheet and character name.
---
Implying that it's only the Chinese that are dirty botters. 
---
By comparing the spreadsheet to the actual event of Tianamen square and then telling the CHINESE players to contact a TIANAMEN SQUARE SURVIVOR to contest their innocence and subsequently "Surviving" the spreadsheet if found innocent.... 
---
This whole statement would imply SLYCE as the actual Perpetrator of the Tianamen square spreadsheet, and in effect saying SLYCE = Chinese government... 
---
Srry spelling.
---
So basically the real racist is Sort Dragon.
---
Sort Dragon. you hate chinese students.
---
&gt;Your feelings don't matter. :) You only get to feel what Xi Dada tells you to feel.
---
I do feel what you said is racist.

And I was just at Walmart...

how is that grounds for csm removal?
---
Na ill give mittens credit he generally has seem to be pretty against the botting thing. He has enough dudes without bots!

That’s definitely been my strategy. I usually go for it during a remains or ruins can, since those are likely to require the explorer to actually pay attention.

Selective ignoring is always the issue. why western rarely censure that Japan government deny the Nanjing Massacre and Korean Comfort women?  most of the time government's deny/commit is just political purpose, not humanity.
---
anyway, to talk about the political incident in the game is kind of shenanigan, who wanna create controversy and provoke strong reaction.
---
Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him!
---
As God as my witness, he is broken in half!
---
Not even just protesting. Army vehicles shot up entire neighbourhoods that were seen as supportive, or where they encountered resistance in the form of road blocks. 500-1000 is on the very low end of some estimates. 
---
In saying that, there are places where western forces have used the same level of brute force on citizens within recent history. I can't remember the exact number, but a UN force used close to 50,000 live bullets and killed hundreds during a coup in Haiti in the last 10-15 years. Both have faced the same level of censorship.
---
Facts don't care about your feelings.
---

It isn't. The reason he should be removed is for doxxing Riot Rick in the process
---
I wonder what day the renters realize that there isnt much left of the "landlord" and there wouldnt be happening much if they d say "screw you" instead of paying some entity that is way smaller than them combined...
---
I’ve started running faction + t2, just to ensure no meme 4 stab fits get away. 
---
I do use a nemesis though, so obviously I’m only targeting stabbed asteros in the first place, and will just ignore people with decent fit astero losses on their killboards.
---
While you and Occam may disagree, I feel like Sort's unassailable reputation as a forthright, selfless, and (above all) wise leader can only mean that the official story is undoubtedly the complete and unerring truth.
---
I still miss click market and map all the time. I've put them at the top and bottom, and it still happens occasionally.
---
It'd be pretty cool to also be able to sell from a container.
---
IMHO doxxing should result in an automatic ban from EVE Online, no matter who does it, and no matter what justifications are offered. Nothing else is as important to me in this story, and I think *many* people would agree.
---
Bring your dudes to Delve again.

As someone who's actually had a Stern talking to from you for a vaguely racist comment, this is only getting better

What is with the salt in the sheet name? Why the hate?
---
"[Going after botters leads to racism](https://i.redd.it/oah8duh0a8x21.png), therefore it's CCP's job and not ours to go after botters."
---
It's your job to be aware of what's happening in your space. It's not actually that hard to discern botting (particularly if you are the alliance management of the said botter). God forbid it actually requires you to undock and play the game a little.
---
everyone needs to chill the fuck down a little bit
---
this is a graph you can use to demonstrate why:  
---
* armor t2 minmatar ships are absolute bonkers against lasers and carebears farming blood/sansha  
---
* the overheat bonus on dsts is a big fuck you to gankers  
---
* you should not point blasters at a deimos  
---
* everyone should fit chelm's modified whatever cock hardeners to get 420% resists across the board and win eve  
---
* sub 50% resists is not always such a big deal
---
EVE players never cease to amaze me with how far they'll go to masquerade their shittyness as moral superiority.
---
I realize it's truly quite offensive to say that. Sorry about that. Tiananmen square topic is much more related to the country and less related to the race of the person though.
---
Correct. Basically delve.... but ccp

Wheres Test, NC., Dorkness, Solarfleet, Legion of xdeath or Init?

Congratulations. You just took a shit on literally the only person who was willing to extend an olive branch to you.
---
Ah!
---
What you're describing is cultural insensitivity, not racism. You can't say he's not Chinese because he doesn't live there. He is. But he doesn't share the same cultural as you. Learn the difference
---
Shh, in before alliance disband by CCP for bot harboring. Gigx may not be alone in account purgatory soon, eh? But that would suggest that CCP gets "enough" info from RiotRick to ToS people/alliances without taking it back. I mean, he has no reason to share any extra info/communications now, right? XD
---
I might just be missing the point here but I don’t think the joke is blaming the Chinese community for the incident but rather using the incident to highlight a specific gameplay style (illegal botting) that Chinese players tend to gravitate towards. Is the joke in poor taste? Perhaps, but it’s certainly not the worst thing that’s ever been put as a character name.

Delonewolf is probably one of the better tutors, at least I find myself returning to his videos when I am looking for information on something. I also watch Johnny Pew from time to time, I wouldn't necessarily consider him a tutor, but his open handed videos provide a lot of insight.

Eve Uni is also good, if you can sit through reading most of your wanted information.

CCP is much more hands off with CSM members.

I’m amazed Sort is still leading coalitions.  This isn’t his first time leading a coalition, and they’re always awful.

Well not being American it's hard to judge as what you are describing obv never happened to me but it sounds like it's basicaly the same thing. Being blamed for something you could not have possibly changed due to not even being alive during that time is just retarded.

Regardless of what you believe regarding this whole mess, what does it matter? The current term is basically over. Is he even running for CSM 14? I don't see a thread on eveo for him, though I suppose it's not a requirement to have one.

why is that?  
---
Is chinese a race now?

If he doesn't have a chinese passport, then he's not chinese sweetie.

CCP kinda hinted that something is coming to alliances that harbor bots, so... if RiotRick has good proof of communications.... wonder which alliance will be disbanded with leaders joining GIGx as an example?

The way I look at it, market and contracts and stuff, involves dock workers coming into your hangar and taking or dropping off items. But they aren't allowed to dig into a container full of stuff just to find the one item you wanted handled. So either you leave it somewhere accessible, or they can't move it for you.
---
OP's problem is that they haven't organized anything. They've got a single warehouse with crap scattered everywhere. And they can't tell where the shiny new thing they bought went, when it all looks the same. The solution isn't to automate organization. Too many requests out there end up being "CCPlease, make the game play itself for me." Lol

no doubt academic fraud is a severe problem for Chinese overseas students.

Those mainlanders' insult is just like "Lowlifes are licensed to practice their crafts; saints are doomed to perish in demise. ",
---
but the majority of the mainland students are good and honest. 
---
It is the same scenario in the game, isn't it?
---
There is no DR, or added gain, on resist by level on un-stacked resist types.
---
The tooltip a module says it gives, is what it gives if you add it last to your full fit, it says 25% and you already had 96% with a zero stacking penalty, you'll go to 97%. But you didn't gain just 1% resist, the incoming damage you take just got reduced by the 25% of the tooltip.
---
It's pretty simple once you wrap your head around it.
---
Technically you don't even need to be in alliance management to look for bots. All you need is the role to audit the wallets. Pretty sure that's view only as well.
---
So BriscGate part II soon?

I d wonder if that d happen. Can say bout Slyce whatever you want, but I dont expect them gelding themselves and let them be widoted into Darkness.

It is not so efficient, though. Has its own pros and cons as everything.
---
I mean, the CSM's behind Brisc getting axed just *assumed* he did something wrong and then CCP looked for anything that would support the accusation (instead of the other way around).    
---
Imagine what can happen if there is *actual proof* of this behavior?  
---
Spoiler: Nothing. Because that's what we've come to expect from situations like this.

It's a region. Which is Eves way of combining several Constellations, which is a cluster of systems. A system has a Star and several planets usually with asteroid belts. And specifically in Delve you'll find depression. Depression is feelings of severe despondency and dejection.

So DARKNESS., is the . supposed to be pronounced "doxx"?

We can hunt GOTG together
---
I too make outlandish retarded accusations because you can't prove a negative so technically I can't be proven wrong.

Forgive me if I'm ignorant, how do they allow alliances to easily spot bots?

Ok, let's play that out: Ranger Regiment sides with Slyce, NC. sits it out because they've got more fun things to do with less DRAYMA, Init shows up only on some weekend meme timers, PL keeps gatecamping some gate in Tribute like they always do, Goons show up max twice when its convenient. All the other locals who show up to things would break 60-40 on Slyce friends over Darkness friends. I'll take that bet and I still think Slyce wins that in the 2-3 month range as long as they don't get timezone tanked.

There goes that

It's almost like the account holders stay in their pocket and swap alliances as new ones move in

 Greetings Fellow Humans, I am the [Inanimate Carbon Rod](https://evewho.com/pilot/Inanimate+Carbon+Rod)!
---
I am cylindrical rod of carbon 12 inches long with a diameter of 1 inch. I am part of group 14 of the periodic table, have a half life of 5,730 years and am one of the few elements known since antiquity.
---
You may remember me as the 15th most abundant element in the earths crust and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass.
---
In real life I am an employee at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and have previously won the “Worker of the Week Award” in recognition of my “tireless efforts” without which the plant could not function. In my spare time I play Eve and take part in the NASA Space Shuttle program.
---
**Platform:**
---
* Give Carbon a larger role in New Eden in line with the respect it deserves.
---
* Introduce a new set of capitals which use Carbon for fuel.
---
* Engineering Complexes require Carbon for fuel (Fuel Boxes are so 2017).
---
* Rookie Ships to include 1 unit of Carbon in lieu of the 1 unit of Tritanium they currently are provided.
---
* Carbon to be given it’s own NPC region of space in the Drone Regions.
---
**Endorsements:**
---
* Silicon
---
* Germanium
---
* Tin
---
* Lead
---
* Flerovium
---
**Things to bear in mind:**  
---
In recorded history there are no instances of any Inanimate Carbon Rod breaching an NDA or being banned for a breach of the EULA.
---
Thank you for reading,

I am happy to address any questions in the comments.

Renters were everywhere during dominion sov. Northern Associates owned almost half of null sov at one point.
---
I think that it should save (and show) only the information your ship has *personally* come across.
---
So, say you travel through a system, and there's 7 sigs there -- it gets recorded. Travel 4 jumps away? Your ship still 'remembers' that those 7 sigs are there. Hop back? It sees there's 4 now. Scan one down? It remembers that one is a WH; scan the other down? remembers it's a hacking site. Leave, come back? it notices that the WH sig is gone, but the site sig is still there (and warpable).
---
That would make sense. I don't think that's what they are doing here. T.T

A rattle will run the sites cheaper and usually faster than a T3 anyway, so you might as well just buy one of those. T2 fit, most of the cost in the hull so you don't have to give a shit when it eventually dies other than getting laughed at (not as bad as losing a 2B tengu anyway)

Actually there's a lot of them. if you are interested, check Liu Xiaobo.

But honestly i dont think some sacrifice will change anything in current RPC. but i know this, whatever it needs to put forth a better future, it will take a long time.
---
It sounds like you're already pretty simple &lt;3
---
Agree.  I don't think it's about racist nor botter.  it's about how to face the dark side of the history and how to face the inner fear against the authority. 
---
That is a really ridiculous thing that people who live outside China can hardly understand nor accept.  It almost becomes an instinct to avoid involving anything or any words like this which is against government's interest in order to protect the weak and helpless themselves, especially at this very sensitive moment, 30th anniversary, though they wouldn't have been hurt here or in game.

I pay for my accounts but thanks
---
Yes, all the groups i mentioned have their renters on that list, same with goons. Now thanks for making the joke even less funny than it already was by making me explain it.
---
Correct, the renter doesn't own anything. He or his corp will usually join a holding alliance that was set up for the rental program. If he doesn't pay, or breaks the rules, he gets kicked and becomes neutral. There are also restrictions on what sort of structures may be anchored by renters, and the sov holder may also provide structures for the renters to use. As far as home defense, the owner will defend only the sov and structures and will do little about hunters.
---
So I (fleet's logi) asked as a joke for 2.6B for a skin - and ... well.  
---
Never let it be said that Goons can't be nice.
---
I'll leave doing bad memes to you, you're much more proficient in that.
---
Someone wrote a TON of names on their penis.
---
Never say Goons can't virtue signal.
---
Falcon cloaky alt at 200km
---
Pshh, if you send that to me I’ll get you two of whatever skin it is. Cheapass goons...
---
delet this

Inb4 RMT memes

Does your knee bend both ways?

Eve is dying because her parents have decided she's not worth killing. This doesn't bode well for those parents. So we learn about their relationship and that they only got to be close because they were her biological parents, which is kinda fucked up. She thinks that she's too weak to take care of herself; she wants to
---
Imagine being in darkness LOL 😂😂😂
---
I'd trade Sort for this guy tbh
---
at least it would die with dignity
---
Yep. Plus there is never reason to doxx people.
---
It's pretty good... I don't have to deal with imbociles like yourself.
---
*doxxness
---
May you cant. Unless they wanted something relating to DED sites to be tested, I doubt they would add it. CCP's view is Sisi is for testing the game, not testing fits.
---
This is some next level virtue signaling
---
Yeah RR has amped their botting up to meet Sorts standards. Therefore, he loves them and their botting money.
---
Go for a wander through Branch and have a good, hard look. That place is downtown Botsville, Bottington State in The People’s Republic of Botistan.
---
Haha yes LOL !! Just press open on you 腳本 and press pve no need to put up with anyone))
---
No but I bet yours does. When you're told that you will be removed for being racist... You don't even joke about it... Not even the smallest most mild joke...
---
Now you're just proving my point for me...
---
History has a fun little trait of being in the past. Republicans back then were very liberal, would you claim that Republicans today are liberal?
---
In those terms they can never be fully depleted. Just only the low value sites left.
---
What kind of reports did you get? Always funny to read them
---
Don’t tell me what to do. *reported*
---
For chinese renters, diplos will be available at Tiananmen Square by June 4 1989
---
I'm better than you HAHA
---
Keep thinking that buddy. No one cares.

Say hello to GS's newest Basi pilot - looking fresh.  [https://imgur.com/a/tss5Fto](https://imgur.com/a/tss5Fto)

It's only fitting we elect a bot to the CSM, they are a significant part of the player demographic and deserve to have their voices heard too.
---
now it becomes a word game: ethnic, race and nation. 
---
Chinese, or widely saying: Asians, might not have the same generalized concept and acknowledge for these three words as the westerners.
---
Please post them when the dust settles
---
Not even interesting ones. Someone literally mass-reported anything anti-Chinese/anti-sort.
---
It’s not an isolated incident, there were a few hundred posts/comments reported yesterday though I didn’t take the time to see if there was any correlation between the post content.
---
8.0 warp speed and expanded probe launcher is a great combination tho
---
The most fun I ever had was being max skilled for the OG 1600mm blaster Thorax. 
---
Absolute space superiority in even small gangs. So much fun.
---
I HAVE A MOLE!!?!?!?!?!
---
Because...well...they are disproportionately filled with bots.  A very good reason to be well represented in bot bans.
---
You care 😂😂
---
And incompetent jobs in dumpster folks coalize and end... Sorry, where we ve been going with that convo, I kinda lost track :D
---
time to start drinking
