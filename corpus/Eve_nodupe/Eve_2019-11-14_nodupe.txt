Make a dual-fit PVE/PVP Astero, explore and hack outside of high sec to make isk, and blap fellow explorers while doing it. You get the best of both worlds, and the Astero is a tanky beast.

Odd, my facts say that more and more people want to play.[Absolute proof I am right](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Ff%2Ff9%2FE12_values_graph.svg%2F1024px-E12_values_graph.svg.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1)

But your modules are on the right so it dose make sense. How about you let me chose the orientation then?

What system?

In watchlist it makes sense as the name is on the left, in the HUD it makes sense as the modules are on the right. Why not just let me chose it?

And where are these new players you speak of?

Play as alpha for a bit till you learn the game, the game on its own is pretty dull, but the community of ppl you play with on a daily basis in the Corp you end up in, is what makes it fun

What in the everloving shit is that Rorqual fit. Neuts, all cap mid, industrial core, cloak, and CARGO EXPANDERS?!
---
id like to suggest to you to use irfan view for image viewing and small changes like rotation
---
No no no that’s just not how it works.  You have to rag on test using bullshit “evidence” at any opportunity.
---
On a side note, no one in KarmaFleet gives a fuck how much SP you have.
---
The bigger question, is:
---
"Are you a dickhead, or not?"?
---
Unless you are in wormhole space, no, you are not making a mistake.
---
PANIC's problem is that the timer is too short. Someone brings 200 bombers, your choices are a cap response before the PANIC timer runs down, or watching the Rorq die. No one can, save Goons under favorable circumstances, can form enough subcaps quickly enough to save it. And now that 200-man bomber fleets are a thing, they'll always be a thing because Rorqs are the third-most valuable targets around. 
---
I do wonder, however, if a fueled PANIC might be the answer. Create uncertainty on both sides about how long the defense has to form. Someone cheaps out on their fuel load, they die before even the caps can jump in.
---
Literally hoping some people click the most expensive package without reading and not knowing/caring enough to dispute the charge.  I mean, entire companies exist by tricking people into staying subbed to a product they don't use, seems about time CCP gets on that train.  They've chased every other fad at this point.

Follow the tutorial and then join a newbro corp asap
---
30? Ohhhhh so close. We are only accepting apps from pilots that have 31.

Oh well.
---
Shitty PVE is arguably the reason EVE has survived all these years.. I wonder how much I have blown on PLEX over the years, juuuuust before deleting the game rather than PVE enough to stay afloat.
---
Do the words "vertical supremacy" unlock a possible joke in this post for you?
---
CCP paid CCP for that sweet CCP censorship.
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with your shitty bomber, that pilot has been dropping Rev's on everything for a year and a half now.  
---
And no it is not risk free, multiple attempts have been made on that Rev one of which was successful [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76212144/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76212144/)
---
Yea just don't know where to find them xD
---
How would I find a newbro corp?
---
^
---
Pyfa will tell you. But, pyfa won't tell you something important - a boosted hulk is gonna be a pain to mine with - I mean, yes, it *really* mines ice fast. Fast enough anyone boosting a fleet will probably need a freighter on standby to collect jetcans from the booster. I am not joking about this.
---
But there's another problem - a hulk is really stupid easy to gank - no matter the space you're in, it's very easy to lose and incredibly expensive.
---
If you're in high, you're probably better off with a skiff - in other space maybe a covetor, procurer or even endurance would be better unless you're absolutely sure you won't get your face bashed in.
---
Hulks just die... And losing a fleet of them is not fun.
---
wow this happened to me too. TEST is the BEST
---
you are 100 % right about the from where, and the cit spam, but alot of people tend to warp to theire „one home structure“ 
---
so true its a gamble, and never a solution or all systems, but some systems habe the main docking structure parked on a gate or so, and the big cluster of anoms so far away, that you at least cover alot of the anoms

Don't worry, that's pretty normal. Eve is a *super* hard game to get started, it's confusing and has an extremely punishing learning curve. When I started out I had to watch a bunch of YouTube videos to learn how to do basic actions, and to be honest I still have to watch a bunch of YouTube videos to figure out what the hell I'm doing 3 years later. That said, if you make it through the early weeks the game is super addictive and can be a lot of fun (and I say that as a bittervet). 
---
CCP (the company that runs Eve) recently rehabbed the new player experience a lot, so if you haven't tried it recently I'd suggest creating a new character and going through that. Those starter missions will teach you some of the core info you need to function, and then once you're done with those the Sisters of Eve "[Blood-Stained Stars](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Blood-Stained_Stars)" epic mission arc is a good next step. The NPE and Blood-Stained Stars are foundational and will keep you occupied for a week or two.
---
After that comes the biggest challenge you'll have: figuring out wtf to do in a sandbox game with thousands of options and little guidance. As I said to another new player a few days ago, my personal (subjective) advice is to leave the "high security space" you start off in and go join a new player friendly corporation like Eve University, Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde or Karmafleet. They're groups that are specifically designed to give new players a supportive environment to learn the game and explore different gameplay options. They have their pros and cons, just like everything else, but if you're not having fun you can always just go join a different group or try something new. You're not locked in to a particular character "class" or anything like that.
---
Good deconstructionism is achieved when a writer tears down a previously understood idea or concept and rebuilds it into a more complex narrative structure. So far in the show we do have deconstruction but I'm failing to see how Watchmen as an overall concept is expanded through the writers current direction. It is fully possible the show will eventually remedy this but I don't see that coming as of yet.

I mean you could expect it to become a meme and make the game more noticeable. I don't think CCP is that clever though.

I think that's where you optimize your cyno route to have the most possible mids while still getting you to your destination.

Autocannons are rather special weapons in that they have what appears to be unusably short Optimal range, but very very long Falloff range. This means that when you're using Autocannons as weapons, you're probably going to be spending most of your time shooting at targets that are about a third of the way between your displayed Optimal and Falloff ranges, and you're still going to hit most of the time (so long as the targets also aren't flying by you too fast and dodging your shots). So when you're talking about Autocannon ranges, assume your real working range is about halfway between the turret's displayed Optimal and Falloff, and try to stay closer than.
---
This is a bit of a unique philosophy for Minmatar weaponry, as with all other weapons systems you do usually treat your Optimal range as your effective maximum range.
---
Yes, it is working now. No reply to my ticket though.

---
Exactly, just like guilds. Ill PM you one that I used to be in a while back, good crew, helpful and nice people. But havent really kept in touch with them so I dont know if theyre still around.
---
Otherwise you should try out faction warfare. Piracy is something thats bigger (than in other places) in the area called low sec, LS, and there are areas within LS where factions fight over control. Sadly the system is old and broken but it still attracts a lot of players. The warzone you want is Amarr - Minmatar.
---
Within FW there are different corps and you can see who they are fighting for, you can pick whatever side you feel suits you lore wise but I would recommend going Amarr. There are certain game mechanics in place that will make it harder for you to travel in high sec, HS, when you engage in FW. Its dumb, shouldnt be around anymore but it is. If Im not mistaken engaging in FW against Amarr will result in standing hits with Caldari. 
---
Jita which is the main tradehub in the game is in Caldari space, Amarr (both system and faction is called the same) is the second biggest tradehub so you dont really wanna mess with those standings when you are completely new. Its not the end of the world if you do but I wouldnt recommend it for a newer player.
---
I dont have any corp names for you within that zone but if you check r/evejobs there will be corps advertising and you will quickly find something. These corps, since the mechanics of LS is something that makes piracy easier, will sometimes also deal in piracy (for instance gatecamps and such). 
---
Plus, its a lot of fun and you get help learning the game which can be much harder than expected. Many small things to learn but luckily most people are extremely helpful and generous towards newer players.
---
I dont live in any of those areas so cant personally help you but if you got questions or anything dont hesitate. As soon as you take the first leap it will be much easier tho.
---
It is, yes, but at the end the new member will enjoy it more I think, He just need to start using heron/asteros
---
I KNOW
---
Yes, you seem not to. I never wrote that a Frigsize tank is the way to go, just that it is out of all balance to give a mining ship bigger Tank-Bonus than a dedicated Tank-&amp;Logitics-Ship of the SAME hullsize.

ooh?   
---
CCP is the only one to blame in every game players search the most optimizing way to play in a game where "risk" exist then players become risk-adverse there no point of fighting in Eve you don't gain anything if you do (except some gank and WH) and that's CCP fault but there some point CCP can't do anything like big-bloc they exist only because there "risk" and loosing mean something   
---
and other thing CCP can do something but they don't, like lack of content, there no content because you don't gain anything attacking X worst war cost money soo there just "content war" like goon did and gonna do again in some month  
---
but the worst thing CCP did was to encourage this behavor, they made rorqual and didn't nerf/remove them for 1 year long just like they never made ressource-depletion a thing encouraging those bloc to turtle, they removed passive moon mining causing PvP focused alliance to dissapear forcing players to mine instead of fighting just like they killed the only thing bloc was fighting over, money, (even if goon and PL made an agreement, but just nerfing their tank AF would break this shit, they prefered to break their game instead) they made an annoying sov-war mechanic just like they released new structure no one want to bash, another annoying thing is the "grind-to-play" mechanic, if you can't fund your PvP activity with PvP (passive-moon / no asset safety...) then you don't encourage people to fight (you will never change the risk-adverse mentality but you can make the risk worth fighting)

But games trying to break into the Chinese market have to deal with their government, and although afaik there are no specific laws in China against displaying visible bones in art/media, their government can arbitrarily use it as a reason to shut it down.

What's to keep them in the Corp you are recruiting for? like what's to stop me from making tons of new alts and collecting bank and then deactivating or bio massing those alts once I transfer my isk to my main account??

Jump drive navigation window is literally never mentioned in anything you see and its unbound by default. Mine was always bound to number pad 5, and on opening it you can see all beacons and cynosure currently in range of you that you are eligible to use, including distance to jump and iirc fuel consumed in making said jump.
---
Most useful window for a cap pilot ever, it opens in high lag and you can right click jump from that window.  Find it, then bind it.

Nope. I just didn't understand you.

Yes. I'm not familiar with those in-game terms

If you're not liking the game as an alpha, then you won't like it with a sub either.

If you do like the game as an alpha, you will absolutely benefit by getting a monthly sub.

Sounds like Unholy Knights of Cthulhu (UKOC) might be a good fit for you.  We are a PvP focused member Corp of Test Alliance Please Ignore that has a smaller, tight knit community that focuses on pilot skill and tactical piloting.
---
We do Corp deployments for small gang content
---
We have sov for krabbing in between wars and deployment
---
We have (in my opinion) the best third party infrastructure, in the form of Mumble, Discord, Auth, our own forums, Radio service, TV streaming service ( for bonding on slow nights).
---
We have a Ship Replacement Program (SRP), corporation subsidies for capitals, and in house builders.
---
UKOC isn’t a big Corp where you become just another line member, our names get recognized for the work that we do.  If you’re interested, reply to my comment or shoot me a message. (You can always decide that it’s not for you, but it never hurts to check out your options.). I hope to hear from ya.

(USTZ Best TZ)
---
Waste of space.
---
Are you referring to the same PL group that have assisted in multiple timers on FE and Echo structures? 
---
Just making sure people have all the facts friend.
---
Faction warfare is my standard response to people that are super time limited. Especially if you don't want to much in the way of isk making, and refuse to Plex for cash. 
---
That being said, if you prefer nullsec, the smaller groups where you would matter as a pilot are concentrated in Tribute and Vale right now. Some of these groups are more newbie friendly than others, but most of them have highly knowledgeable pilots. The USTZ alliances there are Unspoken (yours truly), Rote Kapelle, Forsaken Empire, Reverberation Project, and Divinity.
---
I can't speak on exact policies for all of them but Unspoken and Rote are both pretty relaxed with RL first, and the number of ops that are all hands on deck are pretty rare. However, speaking for Unspoken I can say that we definitely have expectations that you will at minimum have some basic competency and the ability to learn from mistakes and get better. We rely very heavily on individual pilot skill to win fights, and having a clueless dude in a recon or broadcasting super late can lose us a fight.
---
Normallly, I'm all about the storyline of the game itself. That's what I know and that's what I like.

After testing with rogue drones, EVE AI seems to cheat a lot, at least regarding drones.
---
The AI make calculations about % of success and chooses the best target based of factors a player shouldn't know.
---
E.g.
---
BC ratting, focus on BC all the time, only small ships trying to pop heavy drones.
---
BS ratting, every 5s of drones in space, NPC focused fire on drones.
---
The AI realized my tanking was nearly unbreakable and decided to eliminate the only threat the (drones), tested from various ranges.
---
Then I let they shot me a lot and put drones out, AI calculated my ship couldn't recovered from the dmg input and did not changed target to drones, very opportunistic if you ask me.
---
Lost the BS on purpose to prove a point.
---
So the aggro theories, in my opinion, are all bull, at least regarding rogue drones. AI is just opportunistic, using data it shouldn't.
---
These guys are right you should try out providence. Don't let them push you around though, stake your claim and try your best.
---
Before you what?
---
Games might distract the peons from trading all of their life force for pennies.
---
I have an orca.
---
It's cloaked in a wormhole as a suitcase.
---
Started market trading a few weeks ago (started with 15M isk). For example : 
---
I had 10-15% hourly return with 100-800M. I could easily purchase cheap and mildly popular things  and sell them 3 time the price.
---
I had a 2-3% hourly return with 3-6 bil needing to trade items with a higher concurence and lower spread.
---
Almost certainly hawks.
---
Nope, Im going strong on winning
---
Fucking lol.
---
2 hours is excessive? Oops, I play at least 6 hours as a minimum during weekdays lol
---
dont worry op is the definition of spodbrain
---
The reason this matters and is interesting is because a single FACTORY Colony producing P3 can operate 20 or 21 AIFs.
---
So while producers need to spend \~73,000 colonies on making raw materials per hour, consumers of the P2 needs to spend only 3,650 colonies on controlling the actual supply of P3.
---
So the entire supply of P3 Robotics can be dominated by just 228 Omega accounts.  
---
Since controlling price doesn't mean producing EVERYTHING, but just enough, let's say controlling 1/5th the supply will determine the price.
---
That's just 40 Omega accounts who can entirely dominate the price of Robotics.
---
Yea . In many system in High Sec are Anoms that called Emergency conduits . After u finish the side it will spawn 1 min after the next side so you can chain such things
---
That new, I know of basic combat atoms and even ones you have to scan down
---
Somebody already suggested a 9900KYS with liquid nitrogen cooling
---
There's important reasons to understanding this.
---
The Factory system, especially for P4, is so skewed toward consumers of raw product, that the harvesters of P0-P2 have no power and the price of their production can be totally demolished.
---
  
---
Stockpiles of P2 can be completely consumed in a matter of days by a small cartel (40 or fewer).  
---
Creating artificial price distortions that would lead to the collapse of Primary (P0-P2) production.
---
I'm just being edgy for the meme
---
A cartel of relatively very few Omega accounts (40 or less) can devastate the EvE economy by leveraging this.  
---
And the data proves it :)
---
What is this normal daily life? Some normie thing?

Thanks I may consider the offer, I'm going to consolidate my assets across two characters and see what my next move is

Them k-spacers ain't right. 'nuff said.
---
You really are this pathetic
---
skilling spree will continue until you feed ships by playing suboptimally to feed 'elite pvpers' instead of just farming free SP on all your alts instead of doing other things since SP is more valuable than literally any other activity you can think of.
---
Is that like a personal attack or something
---
A group pvp rank ladder based on abyss-like pvp would not be bad, but probably not enough players spread around the tz to have a healthy bracket, and tz tanking on ladder will happen so it's a bad idea. that doesn't means that group 3v3 abyss pvp in t1 ships with fit restrictions no ladder involved would not work, that would drag attention from the players into fun competitive play making a future AT or AT-like event more interesting for newbies.

Yeah they said they thought it would be hilarious to fuck with all the tryhards that life on that server.

I’m a newbie myself, having only started playing a couple months ago. Personally I spent about 6-8 weeks in hi sec learning game mechanics.... ratting, mining, exploring. Also learning how to properly fit a ship is important and learning all the different modules takes time. I think this really helped me understand the basics of the game while flying around in relative safety(you’re never actually safe but I was fortunate enough to never experience a CODE gank). I was then referred by a personal friend and joined a large bloc null sec Corp. This jump was scary for me personally but after a couple months in null I would never go back to hi sec. The support from my Corp/alliance and the opportunity to join fleets has been an awesome experience that I simply didn’t get in hi sec. The isk per hour is so much higher it made the mining I did in hi sec feel like a waste of my time. I particularly enjoy exploring, in hi sec the rewards aren’t very good and it’s extremely competitive with other players... in null there is plenty of space with not many explorers and the rewards make the risk completely worth it. I have just begun to explore low sec for pvp and that has been a blast as well, but I’m not sure I would have been able to sustain living in low sec without making some isk before venturing there. There’s no wrong way to play this game but from my experience, getting out of hi sec is a good move to progress your experience and get into other very fun activities.

Best of luck

Undock you’re a tethered station. Which is just being docked but with no market/inventory.

It was more of an easy meme about the Northern war of 2011/2012 with the Northern Coalition vs. DRF+PL
---
it took seeing the first comment...
---
&gt;Does CCP said anything about sisi being in VIP mode ?
---
i'm sure that one remaining dude in the community team will come and tell the community what's going on.
---
Mind you, I logged in for 15 minutes a week ago for the first time in months. I’ve filled my quota for this economic quarter.

Enough time to gift 30 mil to a newbro on the express grounds he uses it to buy a trig jacket so he looks baller.
---
Tiericide started over four years ago, any plans to wrap it up inside a decade?
---
Go north haha
---
On r/eve anyone who does anything other than PvP is a bot.
---
I find fights every day in LS.
---
So since CCP has had some time to think about it since eve vegas, how is the progress on standup tractor beams for structures coming along?
---
Yup, that's pretty much how it is. Everyone is so risk averse, yet have their hangars propped to the brim with ships. :P
---
The sad part is, people are trash because they are not willing to risk their precious killboards, losing some ships and get better. So they just rather just take the 100% wins (and still manage to die, lol).
---
One learns absolutely nothing from anchoring on an FC, putting on the props/hardeners in a cap stable ship and pressing F1 to alpha broadcasts.
---
Not saying I'm remotely good at this game even. But at least I try to have fun. Guess that's widely subjective.
---
&gt; to report it
---
I like your optimism

An update on Project Nova

Pre-csm-suitonia was funnier and better for eve.

spass gam make job and partner go bye :(

spass gam only friend now

Is there a reason for downvotes that I'm missing? Interested in chatting with you guys.

Groen actually talks about it in a way that highlights the connections. It's all one contonuous narrative but very few people have actually played that long and were in positions to know why the article making wars happened. Fascinating stuff and, to me, more interesting than a game like WoW where the story is written by a, at best, novice fantasy writer who has a corporate agenda they have to follow.
---
well crap.
---
Why are your icons up so high?
---
Rookie numbers
---
Nah. Fire DD. go cook breakfast, get more coffee, run a load of laundry, go for a 4 mile jog, quick shower, wax the car, then fire next DD. I get more done during tidi than regular eve play.
---
Yeah I was just about to post the same thing. I don't think it's particularly healthy for me to sit in a cubicle for 8 hours, but here we are. And that is presumably the "normal" life that gaming can interfere with lol.
---
Its the cheapest hull for chemo fleets
---
Ask the maximiser of fun/h. I take some time to stack pvp ships in a lowsec system, set death station there. Then I can loggin, undock and start hunting in 5minutes
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Chemo fleets? As in.. Cancer fighting?
---
indeed
