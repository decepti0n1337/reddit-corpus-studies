:yawn:
---
You rang?
---
For instance, you can feed a bunch of cormorants onto the entosis gang in your space and then maxping Voltron to save you
---
Tell me who do I talk to?
---
That's a yikes from us dawg
---
Exactly. While the OP is still an idiot for making things so blatantly oversimplified, there is still criticism to be had of the time and effort it takes to reach a basic level of competence in EVE.
---

---
Sure, new players can train into a single fit that's competitive in under a month. But they're not going to do that. They're going to try mining, see that it takes a month of training to get anywhere and try ratting, see that it takes a month of training to get anywhere, try PvP, see that it takes three months of training to get anywhere, and quit.
---
You can't just expect a new player to be that dedicated to this game on day one. You need to get them invested into sinking time into this game. Otherwise they're just going to go to another game where they don't have to wait a week to get anywhere.
---
There's some okay advice here, but you should know that for most eve activities your efficiency suffers a lot whenever you try to all-in-one your fit. Rather than trying to find one ship that can harvest the gas and clear the rats you should make one ship to clear the rats and one ship to huff the gas.
---
When it comes to WH gas specifically ninja huffing is probably your best bet, but generally you're either going to have to pay more for the ship or accept much worse performance to do multiple jobs with the same ship.
---
&gt;If you can count to 5 (meta levels) you can figure out the modules.
---
Well, you also need to know what meta levels are and where to find them, since that's not part of the tutorial and not immediately evident to new players. Meta modules also don't always follow that simple of a progression, often having benefits and drawbacks that aren't immediately apparent. Figuring out how to fit shit properly takes some learning that only people who are properly invested into EVE are going to be willing to do.

---
&gt;almost zero safe zones  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;you cant go anywhere safely without risk your ships getting blown up
---
That's the main draw of the game, though. I'm the biggest proponent of making this game newbie-friendly you'll ever find, but never at the expense of its most basic mechanics.
---
Riiiiiight using them to carebear in wormholes is *different* so you're totally not krabbing in capitals. Fuck outta here

So painfully true.

---
Join Tactical Narcotics Team today!
---
On top of that. This guy is a twitch streamer who intentionally throws large ships away in LS, probably for views, every single day.
---
With bonuses equal to what the rorq currently has (or lower)
---
This seems to not have changed in the last ~8 years
---
Looks like you need NPSI.
---
My bad man, forgot my 150 man munin fleet. Looks like my little group is bads huh
---
If only smaller groups formed together to mutually defend eachother, what would they call such a thing?
---
Miner goes AFK and dies to rats. News at 11.
---
goons kill a capital ship that didn't spawn at the end of a haven
---
Timers are so dumb. Shields go down and there's an emergency shield. Fair enough. But the next one should just be straight into structure when the armor is gone.
---
balancing for small group play :joy:
---
Brisc’s face doesn’t change lmao. You can tell it’s been off the rails for awhile.
---
So basically the same as 2010 Eve, only with better space stations
---
Additional benefit: low sec fights aren't 2+hr tidi slogs where something interesting happens only ~50% of the time
---
eh?
---
Until you get tapi autist lands and get thr u210 camped by weaponized retards in boson titans for 8h
---
Hows the tapi rent coming along
---
is this confirmed?
---
Holy shit, an entire Hulk? RIP TNT, they'll never recover.
---
Doesn't matter what it costs.
---
It shouldn't be the best at every aspect of mining. No ship should be the best at every aspect of anything.
---
Lowsec isn't as fun as it use to be without all the diverse small gangs that used to live there
---
105 clients, that’s the real cancer here.   Every time I think about coming back to the game I see cancer like this and stay winning eve.

Isn’t wormhole space a way around this?
---
Hey guys I'm gonna go jump in a wormhole and use my dreads to kill rats the way Bob intended. Look at you newbs seeding them all over space to kill capitals with. I've seen the light and already reaching peak smug. Later bitches!
---
Does the server actually only send info on things that are on your overview? It could be that it sends you info on everything on grid, and any celestials in system, every second, but your client only shows you the stuff you have ticked.
---
As somebody who used to be part of small gang lowsec, left because of the non-stop caps.
---
Null isn't much better but at least its bigger.
---
C2/N for life.
---
Idk man. I’m getting a stroke thinking about it.
---
Ore value won’t change with rorqual nerds unless they’re essentially removed. Maybe not even then. Look at ore prices over the last six weeks.
---
Hey if stuff isnt balanced so a small corp can do something your literally forcing us to A not play or B play with the big blocks no questions asked. Which isnt exactly geared eves freedom
---
Gonna give a shout out to brave newbies, joined them when I started almost 5 years ago and haven't looked back
---
Or just play in low sec.
---
Haha yeah it be like that
---
Test using ancient tactics. 🤔 
---
Anyways. Two Nestor’s and an eos was better. Target paint the eos and it’ll take aggro.

I love this community.

It gets a bad rap but I think I can count the people who are douchebags in real life on one hand. Other than those people it's a really good group.
---
Right cuz thats an answer.. Cuz low second is alive right? Not bound to get hot dropped by 100 random carriers? 
---
Try again mate.. Even then this doesn't solve the structure problem in the first place. Even playing in low I cant put structures down because some random asshole and his bigger corp will smash them to shit.. At least the ref and dps cap means I have some time to form a response.
---
G O T T E M
---
Its still hard with 10 Engineering complexes, 30 moon mining stations 15 forts and 1-3 keepstars per system.
---
I can't defend my shit so make all structures completely retarded - idiot small group guy
---
im gonna post inside your mum tonight
---
Did I say all troll.. Bye.
---
We're the Tunnel Snakes!
---
That's right!
---
Ping fatigue. If you have a small gang of autustic badgers and entosisers, the game mechanics are such shit, that it's a valid tactic to make tons of timers so the enemy gets tired of forming and eventually stops defending some timers.
---
And CCP forbid a solo player would want to play the game on one account...
---
Not in Korean not believable.
---
As someone who bashes many low power wormhole structures as part of our Clean New Eden Project, I would love zero timers!
---
I fail to see the eve relevance bar the F key for drones.
---
That's a two handed setup, playing without mouse is nigh impossible.
---
My favorite part is how some cheap skill can no longer be fucked by the local market. People were listing some cruiser skill for like 10m in 1dq, so I just bought it remotely. A different skill had split the difference of remote-purchase and so I bought those instead of remote-purchasing. The system works!
---
Need to shuffle the gates to break things up.
---
Dmg cap gives us time to form something.. Anything.. Yes its probably meaningless in the end but some groups will hit a station just to get your attention.
---
Refs should be nerfed to two cycles on meds maybe even larges and xls.. But we need at least one for the real stations.. Not so much the jump bridges they should be  from destructible apon anchoring.
---
Altho I do agree with the more npc sov options.. I also think low should get a form of adm that spawns more stuff if your active something like this.
---
In now way am I having a tantrum lmao. The way you create delusions to help justify yourself and the self-belief that the other person is wrong astonishes me. This is another Olmeca projection on such large scale.
---
In case you didn’t know - projection is when someone suffers certain inadequacies then go on to claim others are guilty of said inadequacies, when really it’s the accuser the whole time.
---
&gt;You sound like a baby with tantrums
---
You literally have tantrums on a daily basis, either melting down on Reddit or in-game local. Projection #1
---
&gt;...big worded...
---
You go out of your way spending hours typing up tin foil crazy talk and running thesaurusDOTcom to try and make your bullshit seem credible, constantly, every post almost. You believe using big words makes it seem more true or better in argument, it doesn’t, everyone sees right through your shit. #Projection2
---
&gt;...inflated baseless ego...
---
Every post or excrement filled comment you keyboard face planted into the Reddit text editor is some weird form of Olmeca self grandeur. EVERY. POST. Why do you think everyone refers to you as “*Olmeca ‘Look At Me’ Gold*” ?? #Projection3

Sure lol ok guy. I’ll go with that, after all I did feed you that narrative and you are playing it out so I guess op success, can’t complain.
---
Spotted the shitposter right away too.
---
\*cough\* Karmafleet is recruiting, allegedly.
---
Wounder if his mouse clicks could be any louder.
---
ok fair enough for time to form. though it pisses me off that this makes stuff like siege dreads useless for the role they were originally added to the game for.
---
small citadels should have a reinforce system similar ot POS.  aka 36 hours max.  1 round of reinforce.  provided they fueled.
---
in most of null, you aren't getting that skill book till the next JF from jita arrives
---
That's an excellent idea. Change the absolute figure 0.02 to 2% however.
---
I post very large stacks of salvage way above market, people building Sotiyo or Keepstar rigs often need to buy from me because competitive priced orders aren't large enough. These orders almost always trigger that warning each time I 0.01 them (which I do to reset the duration).

You really bragging about Corm kills....?

Shuffle, re-organize, make new connections and delete old. Sure make the geography different.

Just don't make the play area larger. It's bigger than needed already.

Having weapons capable of nuking a capital on astrahaus is such a content killer. At leas with POS guns you could clear DPS and neuts to even a fight, and the damage/neuts were not so overpoweringly strong.
---
&gt; In now way am I having a tantrum lmao
---
This entire comment tree has been about me trying to make a point (afk camping is pretty helpful even in organized regions) against what you said, you taking it personal trying to advertise your achivements and seek approval. It even began with you claiming "I am the king of whalers!!1".

Tell me who's the insecure tantrum thrower.

If we had to rent it wouldnt be that well, considoring we dont really go ham krabbing

Being part of legacys a blast though, tons of content and learning
---
"Golf claps"
---
I can agree there I dont like that dreads are almost exclusive to bombs.. Im not sure how to fix that other than I change to their role... but what else should they do?.. Like maybe a good sub cap killer but thats the carriers job.  So.. Idk maybe they just need a buff to be on par with like 5-10 v titan.. Idk im no capital expert
---
But I absolutely see your point theres no point in dropping a dread when you can drop a few feroxes and do the same thing.
---
Define small are we talking asshouse small? Cuz I agree with you for stuff like jumpbridges but not with medium stations that fucks us in WH space pretty hard and were kinda fast to bash as is.. Like if you scan it and time it right I think its 48h or something.. Its really fast by comparison. Which im fine with just to point out its kinda like that already. Altho it should be more attacker  controlled than just waiting till the ref timer and hitting it just before. K space ref timers are an entire different beast tho.. So I see your point on that side. Like a week.. Wtf ccp..
---
Yeah dude. It’s bo_ the Karma fleet recruiter?
---
There’s only like 200 people who ever post on /r/eve and half are recruiters.
---
Are phrases like "critting wormholes" and "risk free wh krabbing" too hard to understand?
---
That's why the dear "Blood Gods" invented DVR...
---
Holy crap what is this? It's worse than local when TEST is in system.
---
small group is better than large group though? i dont get how people can even stand the gameplay that is largescale eve online. its so boring. shoot the thing your told to shoot in slow motion until you get unlucky and enemy group targets you. you have no say in what you kill, you have no say in if you survive. how is this even you playing the game? your someone elses gun..
---
So let me get this straight. You're in a thread shitting on people for blueballing... And you're in here shitting on people for actually fighting? Yikes.
---
For OP: If you're having fun, what the fuck are you doing on r/EVE? You're only allowed to complain here.

These warnings trigger all the time even when doing regular station trading on items with relatively wide margins. I update my orders about once per day and literally around half of the items trigger the warning when I update their prices. Having the warning show up so much cheapens the effect and makes you less likely to pay attention to them when you *actually* make a mistake.

Basically what's always been considered solo in Eve.
---
Streaming?
---
His blue shooty vid with the typhoon is great lol
---
I am going to start naming my ships GoT and Endgame spoilers, thank you OP for the idea.
---
LS good fights: people will only engage a t1 cruiser with a stratios or tech3, and a bc with a 5 man gang.
---
Why? That show is crap.
---
Jump gate, hold cloak, right click capacitor and hover over your 'Jump to' cyno or beacon, hit the plus on the num pad, then click jump. Enjoy.
---
Christ that would make lurking for kills easy. Just enter system, cloak and warp between anoms.
---
You'd kill botting,  I guess, but it would be alongside every casual ratter who isn't cheating and doesn't have the luxury of an enforcer guarding the system on a &lt;30s response time.
---
Logout. Login.
---
Yeah I don't see it much because I mostly trade high volume items with stable prices. I'm about 3-5% of the turnover of Adaptive Invulnerability Field II for example.
---
You are surprised eve players can find new lows of depravity to sink to?
---
"solo"
---
It shows up on the structure owners Corp zkill
---
I'm that solo myrmidon
---
I cummed pant
---
I looked and its not there.
---
Hello Jason. How are you doing?
---
Eve is odd sometimes I think when it comes to kills and credit. I got a couple of damage notifications on a guy shortly before he jumped gate and I didn't get in on the killmail when he died shortly on the other side.
---
I missed it can u elaborate pls ?
---
Excluding Module cloaks, right? Gate Cloaks Only?
---
I didn't know it was a thing until I stumbled across it. Thought it was a bug (figured it had to be connected to the market) so kept my mouth shut. I guess it's working as intended.
---
CCP has no issue getting people to try EVE. 10k people try the game each week, and they’ve stated they’re able to get even more with focused ad campaigns. The issue stems from retention, resulting in most of that 10k leaving by the end of the first month.
---
Make consequences great again
---
either its going to take a while for it to pick it up or maybe no one with director roles in the corp or the guy killed has their ESI linked with Zkill
---
I'm gonna fly my shuttles around with avengers spoilers! 😂😂😂
---
What about diminishing return on the damage cap. So the more structures in system the higher the cap or something along those lines? Would protect the "little guy" still but also give dreads their role back by dropping on higher damaged capped structures
---
I don't disagree with you for the most part, but knowing the levels go from 1 to 5 will be enough to get you going. I agree with you that the tutorial doesn't actually explain this. Perhaps there should be a step that has a new player go to the fitting simulation window to show there is a tool that they can use to see what modules do and how they affect your ship? Just a thought.
---
i read the books xd
---
looks like a great fight.
---
My wife absolutely hates Eve (mainly because my attention is divided between Eve and her lol). So, I put all my porn bookmarks in a folder called Eve Online cause I know she'll never look there :).
---
Did you reherse that to your members everytime you reinforced a calmil structure last year?
---
Hey man they're still pretty good for shooting POCOS!
---
So did I, and even that crap was better than the crap show.
---
IF you transfer a structure to an alliance, it announces the structure and name to the alliance its going into.
---
Raits are like 400m.
---
Just saying.
---
Hey it's not just a nidhoggur, they killed the capsule too.
---
A huge win. Huge.
---
should point out that alphas can't use cloaking devices.
---
Drop timers completely for weekends. Bashing a structure on Saturday evening is no ones idea of fun.
---
Yes exactly.
---
You can now (for a slight mark-up, 30% I think,) buy skills you don't have directly from the skill menu instead of buying a book off market.
---
That's about the polar opposite of the kinds of items I trade. How often do you update your orders? Also, assuming that you get these items from putting up buy orders (rather than manufacturing them), how do you deal with the situation where you put up a buy order for a bunch of them at price X, then some guy dumps a load of these items on the market, filling your buy order and a big chunk of the other buy orders, tanking the price of the item and causing the sell prices to go below what you bought them for?
---
With the kinds of items I trade (low volume, high margin), this almost never happens. But when I tried trading these high-volume low-margin items that seemed to happen all the time.
---
Is there any incentive to defend shield or armor timers? Like do citadels loose functionality in hull timer?
---
Damage caps stop 200 dudes from roaming in a ball and instantly reinforcing everything they see.
---
all services go offline if you lose the armour timer (this incidentally means that any clones stored there are stuck)

How's this different from POS or POCO warfare a decade ago?
---
I don't consider things I produce in my trading (I produce more capital modules in any case).
---
I monitor trends in the materials they are built from. If Hypersynaptic Fibers or Ferrogel go down I know to remove my buy orders on blasters.
---
Small trade losses happen. Big ones I find ways to pass on to others.
---
Buy a thrasher and wait for shuttles autopiloting through gates in highsec.
---
Provided that they have structure transfer enabled.
---
are you a legacy member
---
Yeah lol my bad i was thinking about ls at the time. E545 reeeee
---
It happens, not always, and if you keep getting caught in such a disadvantage you are doing something very wrong.
---
Yeah, I mean, it is verifiable in game.
---
How will they recover? ???
---
1 timers, no dmg cap, less oppresive structure (less impacting the grid), forcefield defenders had to play around,  a tower rf was 48h max instead of the 7 days ish here

---
Wait he steams this? We killed him the other day and were flabbergasted at the kb. That man has lost a respectable dread cache worth of dreads and a small armada of carriers. He's even lost a super of every race. Absolute unit cyno'd onto the 9uy keepstar and warped off a few weeks ago because they were too incompetent to hold tackle. Is this man real?

I got a warning for naming my corp a spoiler to a movie, and wardecced PL, NC, TEST and Brave.
---
The GM was very mad. the members of those groups were very mad.
---
You will get banned im sure by now
---
hm...thats an idea to look into.   
---
but, we have an issue of enemies dropping citadels.  or neuts. or people from other corps.
---
so how would that affect your citadels.  and how would it stop an alliance from just spreading citadels to other corps
---
I think injectors on there own isnt a big issue but nursing the roq to become a support ship deffntly will help this cap/super meta and maby also doubling the amount of components needed to build caps and super capitals well maby not double but increase.
---
It shouldnt be easy to get a titan like shit if I mine ore
---
Every day in my limited play time I think 6 weeks I'll have enough to build one what happend to the days one the 100b titans
---
small being 50 and under (LOL i cant believe i called 50 and under small.  ah....scale in EVE truely does put other games to absolute shame.  to think the clans of 100 people in World of Tanks used to be big....now thats just a small fleet in EVE)
---
I agree with you...hes grabbing an audience
---
aye.   plus with POS and old structures you could rep them.  which added some responsibility to the owning corp. rather than just time zone afk tanking.
---
with the introduction of FAXs. i'd love to see a fight over a POS where FAXs drop to rep it, causing an escalation as then you need capitals to kill the enemy faxes before u can deal with the POS.  and the enemy can do likewise.
---
having escalations where people actually drop caps...has been rather rare as of late (in relation to the number of caps in game).
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76178706/
---
not really.  they just go in subcaps. do the same.  
---
the only thing stopping them is the multiple reinforce timers. which means they have better things to do than show up.  and the artificial damage caps. which means its grind.
---
wit hthe number of citadels in EVE atm. we NEED people to "roam in a ball" and start clearing them out.    shouldnt be 4+ citadels in every system..........or 52 citadels in one system &lt;.&lt;
---
the days where you'd have 1 station in a system,  and then alot of systems with no stations. was better for creating content as people couldnt just dock.
---
EVE: Where no matter what you do, you're in the wrong.

Very nice, I wish you could see more about abyssal mods after the fact.
---
Same same, but different
---
Since when?
---
Lmao dude people blueballed poses fucking constantly. There's absolutely bluebells over up well, and there's good fights too. You have rosetinted glasses about POSes , though
---
Have an astra in your hole, trigger the drifter and leave site
---
&gt; Fair enough. I feel like the comparison to Abyssal space is a little apples to oranges, since it's generally more work intensive to catch abyssal runners (safe from pvp while in the pocket, gotta have probes to scan the trace, etc). In the Abyss the danger comes more from npcs, in anoms I would aim for the danger being more from pvp, but otherwise I get what you're saying and I think we're on similar mind tracks.
---
Well, what I was referring to is mainly the mechanics of it such as spawn variations etc. and the better AI with EWAR, not for the thing to be identical.

I meant with bookmarks.  There's definitely too many structures to show them all, but if bookmarks could be put on overview then structures could be removed, and bookmarks used in their place.
---
this would make wh structure timers near impossible:faxes tank hard and if you can just leave 5000 cap booster 3200s in the citadel and a tethered hauler to transfer them it's not going to be a fun time breaking that ninazu.
---
oh no, i know there were plenty of blueballs over POS.
---
but at least with POS, you risked losing something.
---
its been their plan since...what 2017?

https://forums.eveonline.com/t/august-release-phasing-out-of-starbase-industry-bonuses/10162
---
Here is a truth: Everyone loses when you blueball.
---
Risk aversion is just too endemic to the game nowadays. FCs are unwilling to lose lest they get chided for tanking the SRP wallet and making the alliance look bad. With so much concern for strategic and isk war objectives, people have forgotten that it can be fun to fight, and that fun is an objective too. Fun is great, and also what drives fleet participation. Nobody joins fleets to have a bad time.
---
Y'all ree so much about Rorquals oversupplying the economy but what about actually weaponizing that supply? How many groups have serious T1 welp doctrines anymore? When was the last time anyone said, fuck it, we're all gonna die either way, so it's Battle Venture O'Clock?
---
FCing when you have kids (especially toddlers makes it hard) is mad respect. Take my upvote

Actually it started with me pointing out scenarios which can counter cloaky camping and solutions I discovered to address said counters. You started the attacks, but keep back pedaling, it only further supports and gives fuel to my accusations that you are an extremely hypocritical sociopathic shitlord.

Also stop talking about my D, it's weird.

good point.....

That refers to Player Owned Starbases or POSes. A starbase is different from a Player Owned Customs Office, or POCO.

Eh, I think CCP left a zero off of the price of citadels by accident. One super carrier is worth 10 fully fit raitarus?

Interesting point.  I think people are so interested in being right that they'll simply spin anything to their benefit.  Being wrong is instructive and helps you grow as a person.  I don't know why people are so scared of it.

Lol tedious is generous description of factorio sometimes 😀

Still an mmorpg with an aspect of factories or manufacturing sounds interesting!

No, I think he's pointing out it wasn't 150 Muninns, and rightly so.  Honestly I don't see how the corms would have come out on top of that engagement, but it wasn't against 150 Muninns by any stretch of the imagination.

More tabs also.  I need like 10-12 for all the different things I do.
---
Nice one
---
That was true like 10 years ago too.
---
It's quite alright, I thought I missed a major patch note and subsequent reddit outrage somewhere
---
I mean please continue to feedup more Corms. Though I'd suppose you guys would actually want to do something as opposed to slamming full speed into the wall?
---
Corms would never come out on top, but perhaps if they formed some numbers in an actual ship comp instead of corms they could perhaps do something rather than needing Legacy to bail them out.
---
maybe you should try wormholes.....
---
wormholer btw :) :) :) :)
---
Biomass urself
---
honestly.  it woudlnt surprise me if they had some citadel planned to replace pocos.....
---
my current plan is the day before htye remove POS. to set one up. and keep fueling it till i can't any longer.  see how long i can keep it going (hope they dont disable fuel or set them offline instantly)
---
\*click click click click click\*
---
Well then that's just discrimination against blind people.
---
I'm not even in a major nullsec alliance, not sure why you're trying to shit talk me like I am.
---
But hey, if you're that desperate to prove you're better at EVE, who am I to stop you?
---
log off cloaky cyno in deadspace between celestials
---
log in, cloak up, find em, cyno up
---
no local would be crazy
---
Exactly.
---
the only ones i can get excited about now are wormhole bashes. at least you get a chance of some loot. asset safety was a mistake.
---
I think the point is restrict yourself to in game mechanics. I realize that's hard.
---
You do get a temp ban for it these days tho
---
maybe they will evolve to moas, eventually.
---
And more jump clones while they're at it
---
You're special.
---
Are you sorted with someone to help you out? If you are looking for a mainly PvE game Eve Uni is going to be your best place to start.
---
If on the other hand, you want the big arse fight you read about in PC Gamer the Null Sec alliances are where you want to go.
---
If you choose PH as your alliance you will be given your starting ships for free and most of the skill books you need for your first 90 days. You will be encouraged to join a caretaker fleet where your FC will answer every question you can throw at him, whilst earning the isk for a big shiny ship.
---
no, it just considered it solo by only those that do consider it solo , its not solo to everyone else. Some people can count
---
You'll need to go to the Corporation window, and look under the 'Kill Reports' section of the 'Wars' tab. The kill will be credited to the corporation alone, and if you want to see it on Zkillboard, you'll need to either have your corporation API verified with Zkill, or manually import the kill (export external link and then post it to Zkillboard).
---
WH space best space.
---
Small fights.
---
Don't se much of caps ever.
---
Decent farm if u have ships for it.
---
Best place to be
---
Wat do?
---
Well that's one way to share your fit.
---
Oversized propulsion fits have very specific strengths and weaknesses and are rather difficult to use for a newer player. I would recommend using a simpler fit to fly.
---
I took a look at your Tristan losses and you seemed to be flying a kiting Tristan fit, which, though fun, is also kind of a harder style of flying.
---
This vexor fit is probably closer to what you want to start with. It's a brawling fit, the goal is to get to 0 on the enemy and sit on them until they die:

Honestly to me if it’s one person it’s considered solo, I would honestly give props to those who would micro manage multiple characters without input broadcasting, as I don’t have the attention span for more than 2 characters and id probably do worse with more than 1 character pvping lol
---
Do what people in Bleak Lands do. Form a gang, sit 1 jump from your home (your rivals home) and tell them to form up.

Go for a roam while you wait.

Some people have a desperate desire to feel superior for any reason. EVE attracts a lot of those types of people. You can see one below replying to me under the incorrect assumption that I'm the one feeding him cormorants.
---
Wew lad
---
it's not. other than number of structures and length of bashing. fleet times are mostly forming, moving, and waiting. not actually shooting.
---
Amen.....
---
it could be that core skills that are basically required take WEEKS by themselves.
---
Don't be stupid, explain your fix for future people facing the same issue.
---
And 4 hours later I realized I transposed "Cerb" instead of "Cynabun", because obviously lots of people go solo roaming in a Cerberus.
---
But hey, 30 of you appreciated it anyway, haha
---
God damn kids. In MY day....

Ahh gotcha, I think I misread where you were going with that.

Here's a fun idea. 
---
Alliance/Corporation LP stores. Earn LP by going on fleets. Redeem LP + ISK for ship skins that feature your alliance/corp logo. Boom.
---
When ESS's cant be placed in a max spawned anomaly and actually be risky instead of having POSes and swarma of NPCs defend it for you lmao
---
I didn’t take part(one of my big regrets) but on my second day in Eve people were making a big response in what looked like hundreds of Rifters. I could be wrong but it seemed like they were being given out. That seemed so cool at the time.
---
I recognize the first song, but can't quite recall it. OP could I get an ID?

---
you mean rats dropping resources instead of bounties?
---
what a great idea!
---
i think 'alloys' would be a great name for the new resource type
---
I really don't understand empires these days. These huge alliances are sitting on stockpiles of wealth and ships but never do anything with them. What's the point of having billions of isk when all you do is watch it get incrementally bigger? Unless people are actively selling their isk, which is a breach of the ToS, there's no point in hoarding isk.
---
Lowsec: Avoiding worms and garmurs if you're in any t1 hulled dessie/Frig. Avoiding capitals if you're in a 10+ man gang. Meanwhile Venture bots sit on FW nodes.
---
I mean, hats off to the guy for constantly undocking caps
---
every time i see a ping with "max dudes" i automatically ignore it.
---
it's literally code for "i'm going to waste your evening" more often than not.
---
What?
---
He is saying with 200 dudes you'd just roll through a constellation and reinforce everything. Damage caps means you have to commit to a grid.
---
I've listed the full tracklist in the description
---
I mean you are attacking krabs.
---
It is generally known that if you want a good fight, don't harass a group's industry otherwise they'll defend their space in a way that ideally make you not want to come back.
---
&gt;  You started the attacks (mind you, I was providing legitimate conversation to the thread),
---
You were arguing cloaky camping is ineffective in organized space. I answered with many cases how it helped us kill stuff in your organized space. My language is pretty mild in the very first post.
---
You took it personally, got butthurt and started dick swinging. You never actually engaged with the point that cloaky camping did have great results in your space. Your only pseudo-counterpoint was ADM suppression, but that was merely a function of the attacking umbrella and the defending umbrella. If a bigger umbrella was behind the cloaky campers Delve, then your ADMs would have been suppressed. Other than that your first response to me is where the sperg begins. My post is pretty rational.
---
I did use demeaning language in my first post. That's because you are retarded.
---
Lmao imagine pissing off an entire region so much they form to kill a single nightmare
---
I think the point was supposed to be that not all combat is good. Since CalMil was brought up I think he was referring to the disaster that Faction Warfare became due to poor game design decisions mixed with the current game play environment.
---
Sadly true.
---
I'm pretty sure most people have progod muted, of course they didn't listen.
---
Tomorrow I shall fit and fly a solo cerb.
---
I don't know your range to the target, but the only thing i could think of for missing logs is your target being out/on the edge of effective missile range. For the damage, it might have been better not to use fury; you'll miss a chunk of your dps for too the small sig radius of your target
---
I'm looking forward to watching your video tomorrow night
---
To be fair he's not in a hg snaked t1 frigate so it's not solo by default
---
The number of structures in a system should have an effect on the integrity of all stations. Maybe also tie it to ADM, idk. It should effect the damage cap, maybe even remove a defense layer or remove the timer between shield and armor layer. Basically make it less attractive to spam structures.
---
KF is recruiting :getin:
---
After shield slaves, oh wait...
---
Go into provi or brave space and u get like 20+ people trying to kill u
---
Holy fuck no.
---
Ty, will take that into account
---
You know what, here's what you can do about it.
---
Join a newbro corp. There are so many in null that are just overflowing with free frigates for newbros. Join up and ask where the enemies live, and ask for a free ship and go welp some over there. If you kill something great, if not well, it's not like it costs you anything and you'll start learning things from it. I promise you these corps exist, and will literally throw frigates at you until you are drowning in them.
---
And get into taking out fleets too. Don't even wait until you're comfortable with it, or work your way up to some official big-shot "FC" tag. Just grab a couple other guys in whatever they want to bring and say hey, let's go here and shoot whatever the hell we find that isn't blue, I'm in charge, and we're all gonna die. As long as you have fun along the way, you're doing something right. EVE has a lot of unbelievable content, and it's up to you to decide you're going to grab it for yourself.
---
It literally doesn't matter if you "win" or not. You don't need to win some grand objective or even kill more than your weight. You can jump a gate and all die to some titan's bosonic shotgun. You can go 30 jumps and see nothing and just thunderdome each other until there's nobody left standing. It makes absolutely no difference as long as you have fun and get something out of it.
---
we had learning skills
---
I elaborated below that it would be easy to spot a neut, but difficult to read their name or ship type.
---
I thought the idea was gonna be to just unanchor them all at once when downtime ended....
---
what does hitting the + do?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Nothing will change in this game until 5 rando dudes playing 1-2 accounts each, in T1-T2 basic ships can hop out of HS on a daytrip out of HS to rip apart a juicy target and successfully make it back. Things will just continue to move in their current directions until something like this becomes possible.
---
Now you are tipping balance way too hard in the opposite direction. Few basic T1 ships shouldn't be able to wreck havoc with impunity. They would risk make 1-2B total, while their target risk much more by simply undocking. Specialized groups with adequate toys? Sure. Hunting big-game should require more effort than simply going on a casual yolo run with cheap ships.
---
You seem to underestimate moon mining....
---
Unless it's goons, then fuck the goons =D
---
Uh. No it's not.
---
If you want to kill free content that comes at your doorstep without travel time, sure you're entitled to that. But don't try to take the moral high ground like "ThEy DiSrUpTeD iNdUsTrY so they're FAIR GAME".
---
alts are cheating

You’re no longer associated if they manage to jump.
---
Please don't post similar post again. Carriers are relatively cheap now, easily replaceable, they are not unique in any measure. I would estimate that about a dozen dies everyday. A single cheap fit carrier kill is nothing interesting.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98443830/
---
Nobody would care about a linemember's opinion.
---
Yes, instead you should wait in the first system in their region until the enemy show up with an equally sized fleet to fight you.
---
Standard tech 2 fit 400 dps max skills
---
man, that's been EVE pvp since like 2012, that i know of personally. and a long time before that if i hear right.
---
if massive blue balls dont get you off, stop flying with big null fleets. your FC isnt gonna take a fight they dont think they can win, or at least have a shot of winning. managing an alliance after a blueball is a lot easier than managing it after a loss.
---
and mine them with rorqs
---
&gt;and what was the type of Abyss?
---
Thats true interesting thought. Would maybe make it too easy since you can then just use land on zero BMs.
---
nothing wrong with multiboxing, but it ain't 'solo'
---
I said to me it is, that’s my personal opinion.. I’m pretty sure we’re all entitled to have an opinion. Now if you don’t think so that’s fine. In my book if it’s a single person playing, it’s solo.
---
You were too close to the PDS towers that pew the shiny stuff around. Wish i knew how they are called. But those towers destroy missiles. Maybe you were also in a fire abyss where the enemies have higher armor. But yeah the tower will have destroyed your missiles
---
This is how my EVE life exists haha
---
Undock, kill things or be killed
---
Grab a pile of bros and go see how much we can kill before we die
---
I agree, EVE is just one big risk adversity party now, just gotta remember it's a game and it's all gonna be gone one day. So who cares if you lose it :)
---
Omg
---
Did you join the FW corp?
---
Hm, you actually enlisted for factional warfare, right? You joined the fw corp or made you corp enlist to fw? Beside that i dont know what could be wrong. You need to be pretty close to the structure too.
---
I did 2 days ago, someone told me I needed to wait 24 hours but it has been 28 already.
---
how is that a problem on subs tho?
---
Pyfa does both of those...
---
I was less than 2,000 KM not sure why the timer wasnt coming up
---

That's why i don't do much pvp.
---
Last saturday i joined Spectre Fleet. We really had to jump to Test homesystem GE to get a little fight. Took nearly 20 minutes before they had a fleet together with 80 man in system. After that we got like 5 minutes action and that was that. 2 hours warping and jumping to get like 5 minutes action...meh. 
---
After the fight i just jumped around in their space and was finally tackled by some inty's. Managed to do some damage, but nothing big, and got pod express. 
---
In those 2 hours i get more action and adrenaline scanning down sites than pure pvp.
---
Yeah a lot of people dont know that but missiles do have an HP value and can be destroyed by aoe damage. You could even do an anti missile screen with smartbombs but its a bit unpractical.
---
Firestorm. So mystery solved, I was too close to a tower and it was destroying my missiles hence why damage was missing missiles never made it
---
booshing ravens in wormholes are very hard to play against
---
I think its a typo but you have to be in 30km around the middle beacon. 
---
Otherwise really no idea

There are two markers in the middle of the plex, a beacon and the structure with the timer. If you don't have the later on your overview you won't see the timer.

if it is your own hole kill them with your citadel later. takes like 5 minutes and has zero risk.

if it's your static just run the next site or roll a new one when you're out of sites
---
I know it's not perfect, and I'm not a games mechanics expert. But tieing it into ihub mechanics (make them relavent again) with a claims system. 
---
So alliance A owns system, lots of citadels so v.high dps cap, alliance B makes a claim on the ihub, last for a set period of time, say 2 weeks, and has a cool down of 2 weeks if unsuccessful in capturing system, allows Alliance B and only alliance B that made the claim to drop citadels in that system with original dps cap - other alliances can drop citadels but the claims will only allow 1 claim at a time so the other alliance citadels will have the same dps as the defenders. Keepstars from attackers should be disallowed as they were never ment as, in my opinion, as an FOB.
---
Set peice battles, removal of dps cap, some small advantage for attackers.. 
---
As I said I'm not a games mechanics expert and know it would need fine tuning before it would work properly
---
&gt; Tell me who do I talk to? You sound like such a little baby with each of your big worded tantrums.
---
LoL! Pot-kettle.
---
still more possibilities to counterplay that than carriers doing the same tho ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
filthy then user
---
Use HAM, light missiles only have 1/3 of structure HP of HAM, they will easily got destroyed by those triglavian flak towers
---
but why u give a shit then? lets be realistic, a small group of 100 will never! be able to compete to 1000+ guys, no matter what ccp trys to balance. so they should at least stop fucking up the gameplay for the big groups that pay for the game btw instead of this "every retard should be able to hold his own null sec system" crap
---
No, not in the same amount of detail or options.
---
How much jam strength are we talking? A multi on a random ship or a falcon with a spec jam and implants?
---
once again: the majority of the players dont live in wh space and dont give a fuck about wh space. 
---
add some effects on the wormholes that make caps unable to lock structures due to cosmic energy or whatever. seriously, nullsec needs fixing and since the majority of paying costumers live there it is in our all interest to find a solution for that
---
but the pos blueball was like "ok, they didnt form so lets make a fast siege cycle and we go home" instead of 
---
"the whole 200 man gang needs to do the 20 jumps, hang around there for more than 30 minutes getting bored to death and then head home 20 jumps"
---
Can you explain this 6th drone?
---
like i said earlier, i think chain booshing friendlies is a problem in and of itself. Ideally id like there to be a boosh mechanic for subs and caps which excludes the possibility of chain booshing your own fleet
---

&gt;If you want to kill free content that comes at your doorstep without travel time, sure you're entitled to that.

Well yeah that is exactly the mentality a lot of groups have. For instance, horde has a rule about dropping caps on people that bring good fights to stagings, and headshotting /dropping caps on streamers.
---
What about solo pvp : i have 3 accounts, about time to form fleet and go solo pvp
---
&gt;1 timers, no dmg cap
---
meeeh, i would say Fortizars and bigger should have normal armor timer. Maybe limit those to 1 per System.
---
booshing disjoints missles, unlocks all targets and disjoints drones. Theres youre fix. Don't be disingenuous in your feedback

---
best part of abyssal mods - noone can know how expensive or cheap your lossmail was.
---
Yeah I dunno, I understand the sentiment. Multiboxing is real hard in PVP, but I can't in good faith agree that it's solo. If I had 50 stealth bombers and I just round robin'd decloak, lock and fire on a carrier, I suppose you could say I solo'd a carrier? 
---
 Calling it not solo is not saying 'this is dumb ur dumb', but is instead just pointing out that it's not the only ship/person doing something. It's a cool vid, I enjoy it, it's a lot of risk on the line that requires skill. I just don't agree with calling it solo if there's multiple ships/sources of help
---
That's very far from the truth. It was after downtime and I was logging in campers.

How do you find stuff to speculate in? Do you look for a cyclic pattern or just try to buy at the historical rock bottom price?
---
Argue might be a strong word, I'm trying to figure it out by giving my input. Do you think 50 sb's on a carrier would be solo?
---
I turned off everything but the campers last night and my smart meter was reading 650w. So just over 200w per PC.
---
Ah, yes - and I also have "carrier" in the title - apologies dude!
---
I understand and I told you what I think and what my opinion is. If he is controlling all the 50 characters, solo, all by himself, then yeah I would consider it solo because he is single handedly operating the characters and he’s just one player, one person. Like I said, I respect that you think otherwise but that’s how I look at it, you don’t have to agree with me either.
---
Up keep costs per region/const might do the trick. Imagine those things require isk to run and for every next structure you place HP goes lower for all structures in range.
---
lmao you don't have to keep saying it's okay we disagree. this ain't alcohol's anonymous

Colorcode the nearest Celestial Object (belt, moon, ...) in Overview and rightclick menues.
---
Make different Tabs in Overview to have separate sorting options (i.e. one tab is sorted by distance, another is sorted by name)
---
Give People an Option to bind Overviews to buttons (i.e. keep button pressed to change overview, go back to old overview when button is unpressed)
---
Give Overviews a Spacer to better differentiate things closer than choosable distance and further away. For example, sort by Name but show everything on Grid first, then comes a Spacer and after that Celestial Objects sorted by name.
---
Give the Option to automatically group up brackets into little boxes in overviews without having to mouseover first. Example would be the grouping of fighters in the Game "Star Wars: Empires at war".

as a pvp veteran, right encounters always would be very occasional . people tend to fight in groups , even flying "solo" they prefer multiboxing for safe kills.  So your best bet is to always expect unfair fights 1 vs many e.g. - kill initial tackle and bail when main team arrives, kill as many  as you can before you die, bail if it's obvious bait etc.

I genuinely think he must have been joking when he said how did they know where he was going. He is that experienced, or perhaps he had some software that he thought was hiding the system info etc?

The difference with pos's is that if you blueballed an offensive timer the defender still had to do work to repair or at least restront it.

Now, nothing. Working for the alliance we are in is shit. Some of us actually have lives and friends in the real world, and can come on only when we have that extra free time - we then don't expect to be berated by a 20 year old for hardly logging in. It's us that are paying the taxes that keep you on the dole and able to be on 24/7.
---
Is eve worth starting brand new at this point? I've seen enough posts that some say yes/no, but I'm curious if it's worth it from a PvE standpoint. I really don't care for PvP but I'll do it if I have to.
---
Probably. Specific to the alliance. You only gain LP for engaging in sov specific warfare (like entosis or some shit) to prevent people from making shell alliances and farming LP for themselves. Iono, this was a short sighted idea that I came up with after I saw the "LP Store" service button.
---
There's probably some really cool shit you could do with this though.
---
&gt; They would risk make 1-2B total
---
According to zkill ratting carriers fully fitted are down to 1.2-1.3 bil. Risking 2 bil to take one of these out is not just perfectly reasonable, but overkill. I understand your line of thought but you are behind the times. On top of that you also ignored the immense insurance difference even after the recent changes. They don't have to be able to take out supers or titans, but they ought to be able to take out at least these, or a dread, or deprive a Rorq of its excavs. None of these is currently the case.
---
Faction warfare products (like VNI blueprints, which are ~85% of the cost of a VNI) are an easy one. Stockpile Gallente FW stuff when GalMil is dominant, dump when it is in the doldrums. 
---
On other items I follow the price trends of most T2 precursor materials (e.g. "Tungsten Carbide Armor Plates" which are made from "Tungsten Carbide" and "Sylramic Fibres"). If TCAP shoot up in price, it's time to aggressively buy high turnover T2 armor plates (e.g. 1600mm Steel Plates II, 25000mm as well). 
---
Also I keep high price but plausible to move sell orders listed on items (e.g. I have ~60 VNIs listed at 89m). If those move, I research why and act accordingly.

Of *course* it's Grey Eagles making shit ideas.
---
How long since you opened your first ticket? Raising new tickets while your first one is still open makes zero difference, it just clogs up the support team and makes all tickets take longer.
---
&gt;dude, that's bullshit, there's no way someone is that bad at reading commas
---
&gt;no, legit, you just count the zeros in chunks of three and you can't make a mistake
---
And people wonder how it's possible for someone to fuck up a market shit by orders of magnitude, lmao
---
4 days since the first one, raised another two one/two days ago, some of my corp mates say this will get ccp's attention quicker or could like what u said clogs up the system, not sure what's the best approach tbh.
---
If it is one person doing it, it is solo, regardless of the number of characters.
---
i sent in a ticket asking a question a month ago- no response yet
---
Give CCP at least 1 week. Their support team is too small to process all tickets fast enough
---
My previous ticket get solved in like &lt;24hrs, so was wondering if it's a different system with account bans
---
It depends on the issue, normally different people handle different sections of the support tickets..
---
&gt;as for small groups. honestly i don't see how dmg caps and reinforce periods do anything to defend them from larger entities.
---
  
---
My small group was hit by another small - but stronger - group. Good thing we had all the timers to play with, and could feed ships to buy off time for structures to repair. We eventually won, and probably wouldn't have without it.  
---
100% in favor of nerfing low power structures further. These things need less fuel than POSes used to. Can't be bothered to fuel them? Your loss. Like a low power structure loses its STRUCTURE timer.  
---
Also maybe just make citadels costlier to maintain (up fuel consumption?)
---
The problem with EVE is that players are inevitably going to minmax the fuck out of everything, and only do those things, and that sucks all the fun out of the game, especially for the line members.
---

I too have dreams that have completly beyond reason but don't worry, we all have those.
---
The support staff most likely only processes most urgent tickets during weekend. 
---
So four days ago would be same as two days ago after taking the weekend out.
---

---
Here's an idea. 
---
Can you like, just never post again?
---
I would rather actually see 20 more threads about cloaky camping than look at your post.
---
Train “cynosural field theory” to I, then put 450 liquid ozone in your cargo hold, then undock and click activate the cyno module.
---
so... nothing would really change until the game is in the same state as it is now? even worse, it would start in the same state it is now...
---
how about just fix the game and give us reasons to invade each other and make eve dangerous again?
---
Surely there are less expensive ships to take to a cyno vigil?
---

Astero is also really good for solo roam.  If you want to try new things once you shelve the Thrasher.  On my end I’m not looking for pilots that want to pvp, but rather those trying to avoid it.  And think they’re cheeky enough to warp out before they are tackled.

You mention "alt you could remember password for" - if you had a main also back in 2008 file a support ticket with CCP and ask them to help you recover that. Think they can track it if you recall the e-mail address it would have been registered with, they may ask name, address maybe something related to payment method or card you were using to pay.

They should be able to locate it.

That's one of the cheap salvage bits I keep hundreds of thousands of units of. Should probably up that to millions of units now. 
---
Which bits of salvage are expensive changes over time. A two billion ISK bet on Contaminated Lorentz Fluid a few years back (before Citadel) would be worth a trillion or more now.
---
problem with that is supercapital proliferation. as well as the current state of the citadel release. How do you invade such supercoalitions without wasting 7 years of time grinding down structures?

I am sure you came to GE- to embrac the spirit of the vigil, to pay your respects in Local, share said laughs, and overall to make friends, and not just pounced on a kill because of "Killboard".

At the very least, don't shame the memory of what the Vigil is for, pretending your actions are driven by any other motivations than just a Vendetta kill ;)

It's simple to use and it allows access to the plethora of skillbooks. Some of them are too niche to be stocked everywhere.

No.

Because i have a lot of skill to learn, a lot of gameplay i want to explore, a lot of ship i want to fly.... so many more things to do.

And i'm working for it since few years. I invested time and money (a little compare to vets).
---
What is the point of an endless game if you schedule an End ?

The post implies a "everyone starts over". Me wiping my own accounts and starting over gives me a disadvantage to everyone else. Whereas a server wipe puts everyone on a equal field for a while.

Not really cuz fuckin billy forgot to recall his geckos.

---
I've been on both sides of oopsies.
---
Never again will I rage about the Warning window
---
This is very true. When I started I couldn't make an account because of a website glitch (so my ticket probably got the "I want to give you money but you won't take it, please take my money" level prio). First free responses were general service reps, obviously confirming not PEBKAC error, and were &lt;24 hours not including weekends; then it got passed to Billing/Accounts and it was ~1 week for each response from them. Different departments will have different SLAs (and different staff levels and ticket volume, etc.).
---
Plus, an account compromise and/or ban is a biiiiiig investigation. They need to do a lot more verification before they tell you anything to be sure they're not inadvertently revealing details about your account or their security systems to some ne'er-do-well impersonating you or trying to bypass their security. I'd expect a long-ass wait, and for ant additional tickets to be just closed as duplicates.
---
Trying to wipe what you are scared of...
---
wh ewar brawls are 100x more complicated cause both fleets tank each other usually, even with less ppl there are actually more roles, like Logi FC taking care of capchain stability under neuts, ewar management, jams are separate calls and finally primarys/anchor, additionally there is always a constant escalation with both sides bringing more accounts, the fights also last alot longer, if you do everything you'll be tired after the first 30min
---
you have to make the game insteresting so the players have ''fun''. not wiping it and leave it how it is. thats how you loose players instead of gaining them.

This guy knows where its at

Short AAR: Final third party Sotiyo timer. Shoot First formed a 60 pilot Leshak fleet which included 20 dreadnoughts and a force auxiliary. Snuffed Out formed a 40 pilot Machariel fleet with 10 dreadnoughts and 2 force auxiliary. Shoot First was first in system and started bashing the structure. Snuffed Out bridged on the grid then warped in, both sides fighting at close range.
---
The start of the fight was rough, both sides hardly breaking each other, though Snuffed Out was slowly breaking. At this point Snuffed Out lit a cyno and brought in 2 HAW dreadnoughts and an Apostle. With the HAW dreadnoughts, Shoot First's sub capitals broke, losing a few ships in the process. Shoot First retaliated by lighting its own cyno and bringing in its capital force. Snuffed Out decided to go all in and brought the remainder of its dreadnoughts. However as the capitals materialized on grid, Snuffed Out scouts reported an additional 10 more dreadnoughts undocking in Siege Green's staging, Shoot First's ally.
---
Already outnumbered, Snuffed Out gave orders to its dreadnoughts not to seige and warp out instead. Most managed but a few had already activated their siege cycles and were forced to duke it out. The Machariel fleet, soon to be deprived of its capital support, also warped out, leaving the Apostles and four dreadnoughts to be destroyed.
---
With the capital fight won, Shoot First concentrated on the Sotiyo, destroying it with Snuffed Out making only a brief appearance to whore on it before leaving as well.

Thanks for putting near the beginning of the post so i wouldn't have to waste my time reading like im sure what ever your suggesting is
---
Bring a fight? If that means getting bosoned, yea :-D
---
So this is a really stupid fucking idea..... I had thought about another that wouldn't be far off, probably still stupid.
---
I thought about making a jump gate that only accepts pods and leads into a new area of space that works sorta like wormholes but with gates (no player owned space), certain gates won't take battleships, cruisers frigs ect. Limit the mass that can jump through before the gate has to recharge. the gate dumps you off at a random location in the system, No local. Make it an expansion or some shit.
---
Side effect: excavators become too large to store in a depot
---
You already have it, they can be activated remotely
---
Interesting fight, i am curious as to whether fighting the leshaks with only machs as subcaps was a good overall strategy given their ability to ramp so heavily against massive buffer targets.
---
Let me guess: Brave let all of the dreads moonwalk home right?

Yea we should do this.  Or just start a whole new server
---
They shouldn't wipe the servers. However a colonization of a new galaxy in the future wouldn't be out of the question
---
What I don't understand is dreads with solid self reps can tank poses for an extended period, but get vaporized in a minute at best by citadels.
---
Can't they just lower the damage the missiles do so dreads with solid tank can survive? Something something feature parity?
---
Can you guide us through the thought process that led you to the conclusion that a vendetta was an appropriate ship against a Pete.

The Fort I was sitting on was Freeported for Bellicose Day. They did 1 Siege cycle then Tethered/Docked. Also no one else was really around to Point other Dreads.
---
That's why they were slowly breaking. Emphasis on slowly.
---
&gt; in most of null, you aren't getting that skill book till the next JF from jita arrives.
---
If you don't need to clone jump immediately after, and currently have no JC timer you can always do the following:
---
0) If not already, jump into a clean clone at the nearest citadel
---
1) Set medical clone to your school headquarters (i.e. NPC corp station in HS). This has no timer, and can be swapped back and forth at will
---
2) Self-destruct to HS
---
3) Buy and inject books
---
4) JC back to null
---
5) Set medical clone back to null home
---
This is easy way to get a skill injected without paying the premium price. I normally use +4 implants, and switch to an empty clone before undocking, and if I need a book I can do this after a day's ratting, and the JC timer will be done by the time I log in the next day.

Well I had the Titan trying to Alpha it with Arty's. Might as well try to get a lucky Siren on hims on him to try and keep in there (Though he might have been Stabbed)

You sat on a fortizar that was freeported IN GE, and played stupid games with your fighters and managed to get untethered?!?!
---
Then SimpleFarmers jump in kill your faction super on a freeported citadel AND DOCK UP?!

They must be pissing them self of laughter.

You're saying that currently, a rorq using T2 mining drones outputs what a T2 fitted hulk does?
---
Anyway, if rorqs are to be knocked down from its throne as king of miners, there should be a yield benefit to running a rorq + 9 hulks vs 10 rorqs, the 10 rorqs should have the benefit of convenience.
---
Hey dude it’s John Bellicose day. Let him be stupid with his toys if he wants to. We’re celebrating lives here, not trying to be conservative.

    I dont know John Bellicose and i dont care about John Bellicose and next time he can contract his stuff to me in the name of John Bellicose if it gives him a warm feeling.

Logi fc doesn't tell people what to do. If you have guardians, they know how to do cap chains already, and if they're being perma jammed they'll call out to be skipped. That's not a logi fc, judt individual guardian pilots

Most sides don't bring more accounts because either the hole is rolled by three caps, or you're already pinging everyone

In case you're a newbro and don't know what he's talking about \^\^ You can now purchase skillbooks directly without them having to be on the market near you and inject them and start training them immediately. The skillbooks are a bit more expensive, but the convenience is pure gold. Can't tell you the number of times I've been in nullsec and the nearest copy of a certain skillbook is 30+ jumps away from me, and in many cases not on the market at all. The extra isk to get into the ship I need last minute is worth it...WORTH IT!

Imagine being such a human trash to bring a Pete to a memorial cyno vigil and try to ruin it.
---
Message me on discord if you’re keen
---
Yea that is true that's why we need either a new server or a server wipe/reset
---
God, you are pathetic lol.
---
Lol ok. Look dude. No need to be salty over someone else’s loss in the pursuit of something other than PvE. He undocked and knew the risks same as anyone else he choose to risk his super in a vigil supporting those we’ve lost over the years to suicide.
---
i haven't ever injected on my main but extracted  
---
am i pure still
---
Golems*
---
That's one High Quality Gif!
---
I don't see this being abused at all, ever.
---
Carriers are the only thing I've injected.
---
&gt;Since I have been writing tickets to them everyday
---
  There's your problem- Every time you add a new ticket, you're hurled back to the end of the queue.
---
Thank you. Holy I just realized this only Armor can get this advantage.
---
Thank you so much for the replies and everyone.
---
&gt;"problem with that is supercapital proliferation"
---
what problem ?
---
Sometimes calling anyone is better than nothing. Generally if you sort by distance and blow away the nearest threats first then you are half way there. Avoid obvious bait tanks.
---
With no stream delay lol
---
Depends how quickly you can make isk. If you can earn an injector every hour or two, that can be worth it for 2 days of training.

i think it makes him look even worst
---
While I normally like simple farmers shit, I lose a lot of respect for them, dropping on a cyno vigil (assuming it was obviously that) , that's disgusting, they should biomass and never come back, trash shit dropping a memorial, nobody does that (well apparently these people do).....  
---
" The vigil will be held in GE-8JV in Catch, on the"BROADCAST4REPS" Fortizar in system. It will be a freeported structure set up with additional cyno ships available for anyone who needs them.
---
During the memorial, Brave will not fire upon neutrals in our space unless fired upon first, and will defend any cynos lit on these structures to the best of our abilities. Feel free to come looking for a fight, as we’re all here to have a good time, share some laughs, and remember those who are no longer with us."  
---
How can you be so low.
---
Tertiary effect : excavators gain bosson ability
---
Good chance it is wrong though.
---
So... ermm.... if you saw the sneaky Pete Tengu warp in and light a cyno, why didn't you jump to a different beacon within jump range instead of abandoning each fighter? 
---
Or... is it more of you didnt want that Vendetta anyway?
---
not even denying
---
Well, let break it down for you:
---
&gt;Everyone Starts out the same, base SP, ISK, market is wiped, etc.
---
Unless you use real life skill extractors to forcefully extract 15 years of EVE experience out of the heads, you will not be able to change much.
---
&gt;Algorithm Calculates worth of all Assets, SP, etc and credits PLEX to each character 1 week after the wipe.
---
Why would CCP ever do this?
---
&gt;Skill injectors/extractors are disabled for 1 month (Excluding progression events)
---
My opinion on them is that they should not exist on any TQ, pre or post wipe, so w/e. If you allow them, people will mass extract to get their main characters into key ships (everything strong right now, Rorquals, supers, Muninns, etc.)
---
&gt;Null Sec, C5,C6 WH Space Locked For 1 Month after Wipe.
---
So everyone is just stockpiling for one month, then goes to to null/c5/c6
---
&gt;Triple Material Cost for all Super Capital Ships also Un-Nerf Them.
---
Just because it takes 3x the time, it will not stop anyone from doing it. It did not work for titans on this iteration of TQ and you provided no suggestions to change it for the next one.
---
&gt;Double Material Cost for all Citadels, add a small citadel that act's like a POS for invasions, etc
---
See above
---
&gt;Structure Cap for Systems concerning Citadels,EC,Refineries.
---
Structure cap for constellations (e.g. 1 Keepstar/region, 1 Fortizar/constellation) have been mentioned before, I see why it would be good and create conflicts, but also is a topic that needs some more discussion, especially when looking at highsec.
---
&gt;Add more background systems to combat botting w/o so many false positives.
---
As long as there are low effort, low reward tasks there will be bots, because you can scale them better then players (see delivery missions, low tier anoms). 
---
&gt;Make marauders useful
---
They are solo ships, excell at PvE and I see enough PvP kills on them.
---
&gt;Enormous scale invasions that require fleets of atleast 100 players. Extreme risk for equal reward for each player.
---
Apart from me wishing for stuff that involves 5-30 players, since those are the numbers the new corps or player groups have, that you want to keep in the game, players usually will go for "OK rewards" with calculated risk.
---
EVE is real and my spreadsheet tells me I will make more ISK that way.
---
&gt;In-Game Casino
---
There is probably a lot of good reasons those are not in the game (probably some legal ones and they don't want to rely on CCP\_Random() because of CCP\_Round() )
---
&gt;In-game Ranked 1v1 5v5 PVP Weekly Rewards
---
Those would have to be so restricted in terms of skills/modules/implants etc., they might as well be a different game.
---
&gt;FW Rework
---
FW needs a rework, but not a wipe of TQ.
---
&gt;Alliance Tournament with REAL rewards again
---
What does this even mean?
---
&gt;Rework resource availability  
---
&gt;Require Super rare material to build Supers, Hard to find but not "too" hard
---
Unless you have depleting resources, you will run into the same state we got today, see what I wrote earlier about 3x the cost.
---
&gt;Faction Supers should have real advantages to price ratio. Make it worth the cost
---
You mean superior hitpoints and better fitting/slots are not superior enough?
---
Day 8 for me as well my dude. Got kick/banned after plexing and extracting a character I don't use. No response. Quality service. I haven't even played since it happened lol.
---
You will know what I mean when it happen.
---
When I first started to PvP i was hunting in Wormholes looking for explorers, so far I took a Helios and a heron, but that's too much time wasted for little rewards, simply because wormholes aren't much trafficated and it's hard to catch an experienced explorer, before pvping I was an explorer and I remember I've roasted many guys in local that wanted to catch me, so if one is focused enough it's quite uncatchable. Unless you're cloaked somewhere and you already probed all the signatures, but I gotta repeat, that's really time wasting
---
After that I started hunting explorers in lowsec, where I could've seen at least the traffic, still cool and got some kills, but then got bored because it's too much work for a simple kill
---
After that I said Fuck it and started engaging more stuff, at start I was super afraid they had an ally somewhere, this made me engage very few people, and I still kept dying, then I said fuck it again and started to engage everything. Situation improved when I joined FW because I could've get an idea of who's with who. But then again I also ignored that and now if I see 8 ships in dscan and I can fight most of them, I still engage. I only avoid fights in system where I see ships such as jaguars/garmurs/wolfs. Lately I started to engage Dramiels and daredevils and sooner or later I'm going to kill one of them
---
Tl:Dr pew pew if it moves
---
Yes, instead of shooting veldspar I shoot processed material
---
This is stupid from so many points of view that I'm truly amazed that you actually managed to type it down and post it without having a stroke.
---
Wanna go ratting?
---
say goodbye to jump freighter support for remote null if you have to rely on 5 separate dudes to get you cynos lit.
---
Thanks sir o7
---
I'm saying a rorqual can still mine a useful, but not oppressive, amount even without excavators
---
Mmm... Eve is kinda famous for being "that game where you lose everything when you die". I don't see why this should not be extended to Upwell structures, now that they have taken the role of starbases and outposts.
---
Yea, it sucks when you take an extended leave of absence from the game and you have stuff in an Upwell thing, but hey, that's the risk you take.
---
Yea i agree with you i just hope null Will explode and they all go fight each other. Because of these huge alliances the entire economy is just getting more expensive like Plex and injectors because they print out the isk like the chinese
---
Yoooo Duuuddeee i think you dont know how to use the term "salty" correctly.
---
200 +3% implants at 200k ish instead of 20m ish. Mistakes were made
---
nice thank
---
The Pete didn't light it. He was just shooting other Cynos. Purifier Came in an Lit the Cyno. And I didn't jump because I thought I had recalled all the Fighters to Orbit me (Instead of being 100km off) a bit before the Purifier landed. When the Cyno was up I had 0 Aggression and the NSA was off. Only thing keeping be untethered were the fighters being out (And since I thought they were just orbiting me) I could instantly recall them to Tubes and tether instantly.
---
But nope 4 dam flights of fighters didn't come back when I recalled earlier.
---
You need to git gud.
---
Yes, that's all very well but what am I supposed to do with the skill books I get from exploration sites now? 99.9% are worthless.
---
I've only ever used 3... with a zero behind it.
---
It used to. Once the rats picked a target, in the past they wouldn't switch. This led to the idea of a tank ship and a glass cannon. 
---
What could probably help is if you have standings. Kind of like how the npc diamond rats work. If you have positive or neutral standings with you, all rats in the space don't agress unless you agress. It would mean grinding standings with a pirate faction but it's something.
---
hah made me look
---
I thought this was an albion online video with someone solo ganking on a nightmare mount. a very expensive mount. interdesting
---
Cap boosters on capitals are the problem
---
2. Do the career agent missons
---
3. Buy plex and buy a supercarrier
---
4. Skill inject into said supercarrier
---
Good old mittans
---
God forbid someone has to engage their brain and figure out how to stop a tengu killing your cynos.
---
this get posted every week.. and no
---
that is eerily accurate
---
I don't understand how someone can't wait 2 days.  Maybe it's because I'm getting old.
---
Thanks, Dwarf. 
---
The mental energy and focus to create and invest in endless counters of fittings and fleet doctrines is what makes EVE truly unique.
---
IMHO, it's also the real reason folks call it a dad's game.
---
All right. Thank you for the explanation :)
---
Forget drugs - I'm injecting in eve online mum!
---
Darwin makes qfc alliances leave pretty often
---
Your quote literally says to come and try to get a fight though lol
---
I assume John bellicose enjoyed playing the game instead of lighting cynos all day.
---
Have you ever actually fc’d in a fight ?
---
did you know that poitot is the only named system in the syndicate region?
---
Not true solo, true solo is no links, no drugs, no implants and you need at least one empty slot on your ship.
---
Rich boy’s toys lol
---
You can see the exact moment where Brisc questions why he's putting himself through this.
---
Also that's a nice tie.
---
What have you done penif... what have you done
---
Stupid behavior generates content.
---
Huge respect Hyperion
---
Yes remove 10 years of work.  How about ! No!
---
In spod simulator 2019 super is the appropriate ship against everything
---
you realize we're making fun of you, right?
---
arrrgggggh ... flashback
---
Why would you wait 2 days when you have the choice of not having to wait at an hour's work?
---
If we wanted to "break up" the Cyno Vigil to be dicks, we'd be doing what the guy in the sniper tengu was doing.  We could have been there for hours with 10+ tengu snipers shooting shit, or tornados.
---
We've left it completely alone except for a 5 minute period.
---
He was not cynoing up when we dropped him, he was ***actively*** PVPing with it, and did so with extremely expensive ships (All up on field, he had around 330 billion isk) in our immediate range.  
---
There comes a point where being a part of a vigil doesn't give you immunity to doing silly things.
---
RMT tears best tears
---
:p
---
People wanted to improve combat so much that they invented peace.
---
Just seeing if everyone is jumping on the band wagon or paying attention  :)
---
Enter: Leshak, Drecavak and Kikimora
---
Leshak is perfectly capable of soloing a carrier. 2 remote reps Leshaks with tackle and links are able to destroy a ratting super. And regular carrier will melt in seconds vs a drecavac gang. I think that Triglavians are unbalanced when compared to other subcaps, but I kinda get it. They are specialized tool for people that can utilize them. But they are almost oppressive at these point. 
---
And for Rorqs. Well a handful of bombers, often multiboxed, is able to destroy excavs easily if Rorqs pilot is late with reaction. Plus they risk much, much less than drones worth.
---
I like the empty low slots !
---
if they ever do this they need to make a new server, and release it with a rewritten code, fixing all problems with todays tq. It would take a lot more employes than CCP have to re write the code, so no.
---
That's hilariously good!
---
&gt; Jump gate, hold cloak, right click capacitor and hover over your 'Jump to' cyno or beacon, hit the plus on the num pad, then click jump. Enjoy.
---
Keep in mind that when you use this trick you want to give yourself a small delay between hitting the acceleration button and left clicking on 'jump' on your capacitor menu.  If you chain the operations together too quickly, EVE will tell you to fuck off and wait, and now you're left scrambling to right click + jump again while fully exposed.  I try to give myself a 0.5-0.75 second grace period.
---
GF all. Still can't count though Sal. We only had 14 dreads. ;)
---
No
---
yea, thing like usually need to be escalated to a senior gm
---
You'd just use this to protect your caps instead.
---
I've used skill injectors on alts for the most part. Create new alt for specific use, give it 20/40 mil SP if needed, use it. But I'm a weirdo and an RPG player so for some reason I don't bond with these insta characters, I get bored and stop using them or take out their SP again. Too easy, too meaningless.
---
As I've made a complete and fresh start, cutting all ties with my old characters/alliances/EVE life I decided that I'd only give myself some starting skills and do the rest "natural grown" and do it all with just one account. It's refreshing actually.
---
Living in denial is bad in the long run.
---
That's a message for you more so than him, really.
---
You're right he doesn't.. Maybe google the whole "John Bellicose" thing before sounding even more of a twat.
---
It’s even as if you as the attacker are too dumb to anticipate contingency and plan for them.
---
Imagine if EVE had fuel
---
Good to know that CCP takes good care of the absolute cancer that is slowly killing the game for over a decade that is alts
---
Not solo but nice vid ;) it was a good nightmare. But why you switched so often between fighter and carrier
---
I laught when i see rating carriee without neut (it really save your life if you are dump enough to ge caught.
---
swing and a miss
---
Ok, thank you!
---
the dude explained in the thread posted above that he tried to toss as much in the citadel as he could when he got caught.
---
They have much more trouble applying to frigates though, you are probably better off with RLML. 
---
RLML have much higher range as well.
---
Dont forget the string of shitposts roasting the Myrm pilot's fitting/name/alliance and for not having 5 scout alts to see the gatecamps ahead of time.
---
In that case, why tether and cyno out? Stay for the fight
---
ah makes sense, lucky for him he was able to do that.
---
I've hit 80M old-fashioned way just a little while ago. 
---
Not much point in them now.
---
Completely ignore local in Jita.
---
That'd be hilarious if it ended with a killmail.
---
EVE has audio? :^)
---
Wow you have fallen from the path you need to speak with you Mission President. Brother.
---
CCP can't even get a chat or tournament system yo work correctly and you want them to rewrite nearly every system in eve.  Imagine all the bugs and delays.
---
Imagine how god awful the state of SoV warfare must be if people are fondly looking back on PoS bashing.
---
I guess time will tell... People shat on me and said I was cringy for supporting Brisc and claiming he was innocent. They lumped me and Stain Guy into the same group. Turns out all those people were wrong...
---
There you go again glorifying in the evils of the world Elder. We need to have a heart to heart when you return from Central Russia.

Maybe you should pull your hypocritical head out of your ass.

Just because he was a eve player doesnt make his suicide any special.

Since you left on your mission to Central Russia. Btw 0lease focus on the work.
---
That poor Algos.
---
No it is just different, but not the same. Please put your shoulder to the wheel and hold tight to the iron rod. Repent my brother.
---
pure filth
---
Not with these juicy precursor skillbooks that i have in a random astrahus in the middle of nowhere.
---
This. Plexing ops were a lot more fun than this, because plex timers didn't instantly fucking reset. You could regroup, take a fight, then go back to grinding out the system. Then, since there were no retarded structure mechanics, just drop caps on the ihub.
---
Please don't everything /u/cactusjack48 does has been tainted by his previous lies.
---
#LIES!!!
---
This. Fucking THIS.
---
No you should get the bonus for how much you are not paying attention to you eternal responsibility.
---
I suppose some people just don't value their spare time.
---
Well, the last group to leave had nothing to do with Darwinism and more to do with leader was a moron hehe.
---
Like fight the other tethered people? Or fight the t1 haulers with cynos up? :thonk:
---
No you need to focus on the work my brother.  Remember you are apart of a marvelous work and a wonder.
---
The point of ganking Krabs is to bait something small enough to be engagable to come after you
---
There's a difference between "can't wait" and "why wait if I have disposable isk"
---
Thera should not be your concern today Elder.
---
Just wow the level of insensitivity and apostasy.  What has happened to you in Central Russia my brother?
---
Please repent and return to the work brother.
---
Your ship also must have blasters and no prop mod and die to the first cyno.
---
You should read scripture to learn and then teach. Please do not fall into forbidden paths of corruption.
---
150m sp, clean and pure.
---
Why are you arguing the point with me?  I have "disposable isk" and don't spaff it on injectors.  There's no skill in Eve you really need right now that won't be just as useful to you when it completes in 14 days time.
---
The time is at hand and we all must repent. Forgiveness is one of the greatest blessings.  Elder it is time you partook.
---
Fixed.
---
I always imagined my chars doing the starcraft Marine stim pack sound: 'Ahhh that's the stuff!'
---
Tbh I think removing cap invulnerability to jams and/or removing ewar stacking penalties on caps would be better. As it is ewar is useless.
---
It's like a train wreck, you can't not watch.
---
the drifter is worth more than the site itself, so provided you can kill it quicker than an anomaly, it is very much worth your time. If it takes you longer than a site, than it probably isnt.  
---
Without knowing your fit/skills and clear times it can't be said definitively, but i would be surprised if you cant kill him quicker than a whole site with 3 snakes. Especially if you swap drones to shoot into his holes. ( don't use geckos).  
---
If you are looking to add more DPS, drifters prioritize larger ships, so if you already have BSs on grid, you could bring glass cannon oracles, talos, bombers etc with no threat to them, just make sure he aggress a snake first.
---
Or you could join worm hole space and get fights all the time.

Sir what am I saying.  Child you need to send you parents back thier electronic device because it is distracting you from your mission.

You have no idea how much we love hearing that.

Yeah, despite my love for tunnel snakes I feel the game has really gutted the AC Svipul, and arty kiting with small guns just isn't that great. T3Ds desperately need a buff to keep up with assault frigs. Now throw in the Kikimora and I feel like only the Hecate and Jackdaw really have any place.

I feel even worse for the Confessor now. I keep trying to make it work in any fucking way and keep getting "why am I not in a retri?"

Really because I submitted a ticket this weekend about how my super has to take 2 shots to kill a frigate now and they replied instantly saying they'll get right on it.

Wish I could get back all my rorq SP and putt it somewhere else

Yes perception is important.  That is why it disturbs me to find you spend so much time on Reddit brother

Please be humble Elder.

Clearly that was an issue of the greatest importance.

want to kill a keepstar? Just spam 50 Raitarus to weaken its damage cap!
---
Not enough neut representation
---
When I was in CVA, killed him sometimes, but after a while I quit going for him. No challenge, and pretty much felt I was somehow abbusing him.
---
Last time we meet in space, I found my self protecting him. Neuting a loki that had tackle on him after he jumped from High sec to 0.0 in a freighter. 
---
He got away but hours later he died to a CVA hot drop.
---
Ditch the hs indy corp, ho explore more in wh and ask to join the next guy yhat kills you.
---
We are branching out to do some WH exploring as a group so I'll stick with them for a while! Our base is right next to a whole bunch of low sec systems too.
---
The way that super was used it got what it deserved
---
how about:every time a capital red boxes a subcap it activates their self destruct and they're not allowed to turn it off until one second remaining
---
There's no OP you absolutely have to attend - with your already skilled doctrine change - that won't be pinged next month, next quarter or next year.
---
But it's your ISK, do whatever you want with it.
---
&gt; 20m SP pilot, ready for bash with his friends

Naturally, the degrading effect should only apply to structures of the same corp or alliance.
---
That's the whole point.
---
is he like, slow?
---
257mill SP here. No injectors, but could the free xp (although not officially injectors) be considered as such?

He's not in Discovery though. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159059/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t7
---
&gt; God forbid someone has to engage their brain and figure out how to stop a tengu killing your cynos.
---
It's pretty easy to stop the tengu from killing your cynos. Just distract it with a vendetta kill.
---
Except we had one that led into destruction of dozen enemy titans. So injectors well spent.
---
I guess that option would turn boosh eagles from the best subcap bash fleet available for a keepstar to basically useless once they had 2 fax and some LR gun dreads or titans on grid. I am not sure if that would be a good thing though: even in null a fax tanks really hard if you actually put enough cap boosters on it. throw 2b in fittings at an apostle and it can tank almost 80k dps til you run out of cap boosters.
---
Really.  You spent 1 bill on an injector to join a bash.  What an idiot.
---
Heck, forget that. Remember the cruise missile kestrels we would fly?
---
You will regret this
---
I read what you said, and realized that charisma is all about leading and feeding.
---
At least we got all of those learning skills back in SP. Not exactly a huge win, still something though
---
dont count on it
---
I've never used them. Of course its because I had all the skills I needed already by the time they released the damn things.
---
u/Multifrequency30 does not read reddit https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/binebp/another_story_of_how_i_lose_shit_on_citadels_not/
---
You're probably right haha I'll do it until I do regret it, then move on.
---
It's nice CCP is giving gifts away regardless of clone status.
---
You are very definitely going to regret it. The only reason that a lot of the high-sec corps exist is so that they can scam new players it seems.
---
herp derp, you missed the point.  
---
CCPls isn't worried about the $120/yr the average player pays.  They are interested in milking the retards who plex a titan on week 2.   P2W is where the real money is at: see every phone game ever. (thanks farmville)
---
If they suddenly made plex 1/3rd the cost, the whales would literally spend 1/3rd less, and i guarantee you they pay more than the average monthly subscription, combined.  
---
Literally anyone who grinds for plex is retarded, and i tell them that. Unless you are in the 1% the best way to get plex and isk is to work a part time job.
---
I think CCP has done away with Events completely and will only be giviing away stuff periodically now.
---
Making PVE accessible to PVP fits.
---
Are we just not getting deadspace events anymore? I want to actually play for my rewards not just pay and log in.
---
Fair, but they've been pretty open so far. They've been a corp for 4 years and I talked to them for a solid 3 hours last night. They gave me access to a significant amount of stuff, so if they are scamming me they left themselves pretty damn vulnerable haha.

---
The real hero
---
Only dreads and fax are immune to ECM, all the other caps are just very hard to jam. and technically you can use all the other ewar types on any of the caps it's just not very effective.
---
That is why i called them retards.  
---
Fools and their money are soon parted.  Eve players might be a special bunch, but those are not where "growth" lies.  It's is not uncommon in your average F2P phone game for a whale to drop $2000 bucks in a weekend, and have it all explode before night time.  I literally watched 2 people do it Saturday.  I'm betting $4000 is more than you've spent on eve in your entire career. I've been playing for 16 years and only just crossed the $10000 mark
---
Don't use learning implants or remaps either! You need to learn everything at your vintage racial attribute point distributions speed! /s
---
I use those.  They're free, you complete idiot.
---
No, free to play is a prerequisite for pay to win.
---
It depends, if that ping is from a strat fc and includes the words "safari pass" it's more like +60 in fleet.
---
Pay to win is a prerequisite for whales.
---
Yeah, what a dumbass. Who would play a video game to have fun?
---
Glad to see your enjoying yourself now. Join rookie chat or a newbro corp tho.. Hs corps are for casuals at best.  As others have mentioned be wary of who your working with a lot of CEO's are .. To be frank.. Fucking retarded.. 
---
Put it to you this way my single bad corp experience was with a renter corp in null *yea I know smart move right..* we were out doing a mining op I guess I was Fc or something cuz I was boosting not that it was a formal fleet or anything. But CEO comes out in his cute covetor and goes afk without saying anything.. Then dies.. And loses his shit.. Like freaking out on coms this goes on for two - three days before I got tired and left..  All because he lost a cov and thought he heard me say "well dont suck" over coms.. Simple misunderstanding and he lost me and my crew. Be wary. There are even worse stories out there. My is very small in comparison.
---
If you like whs then join a wh corp they are more tight nit than most HS corps or any Null corp. 
---
Dont worry touch about losing stuff but heed the golden rule of eve.. Do NOT fly anything you cannot afford to lose.. If you cant replace it dont use it.
---
Application won't be a problem at all as long as you bring a web, aside, those Damaviks have very large sig radius, almost as large as a cruiser
---
If you wanted to have fun, you probably wouldn't be playing Eve.
---
Who you fly with can make or break your eve experience. Don’t be afraid to try new things. Also, eve can be unforgiving, but most people will be glad to tell you what you did wrong or give you pointers. Having someone fly around solo getting killed without knowing why and then quitting the game is good for no one. More players = more targets :). Fly dangerous o7
---
That super or titan that dropped out of the pos hanger which no one in fleet can fly.
---
Protect diplo jobs, create drama today!
---
That would make sense for the hit or miss nature they've had with them recently and why we got 500mil free sp a few weeks ago
---
Just like the ore I mine.
---
Really, you injected Titan skills to do that?  People in this game are more retarded than I thought.
---
Damn, that's one hell of a story haha. The CEO has played for 8 years and started this corp for 4. He seems to know his stuff, and I'm okay with it being for casuals. I play a couple hours a night on a macbook pro, so I won't be doing some day long afk mining ops or anything.
---
I talked to him about my game plan of logging on a couple hours a day/every other day, doing some exploring/scanning/ratting, and just working my way up to fly some bigger ships to possibly do larger scale industry stuff. The other people in the corp are kinda the same way, very low key.
---
At the very least, this provides me with an accessible base and resources I can't easily earn on my own. At worst. I lose a heron, a venture, and merlin and maybe a mil in assets haha.
---
And yes the golden rule! He asked what I felt comfortable flying with and borrowing from the corp, I told him nothing worth more than 1 mil fully kitted until I'm much more experienced. So he gave me access to a bunch of ventures and scanning/exploration equipment. I'm terrified to fly anything more costly.
---
What about the free sp from CCP?
---
Haha yes! When I got killed by the one player I was angry but knew it was my fault. It was sooo cool to then receive 7 mil and to have him actually talk to me when I thanked him for the money haha. First person to do that so far :)
---
Speak for yourself. New bros arent the only people who play this game.
---
You can’t use the new remote skill purchasing as well, it’s far too convenient! /s
---
Old heads gonna love this.
---
Two completely different things with nothing in common?  It's quite convenient, I may use it in future.
---
I'm just pointing out that the point of it is specifically to be different, and to make somethings harder than others.    
---
It seems like your point is that everything should have equal value, which is easy to implement, remove all attributes and set the training speed.  But that wouldn't make for a very interesting mechanic.
---
&gt; I wonder why people don't like him
---
Wikipedia is asking for donations so they can get more storage for the page dedicated this.
---
So let me get this right. Injecting a skill to get loot titan which is fitted, that you can sell for min 50b firesale price is retarded?
---
You are an illiterate unfun moron.
---
Just as expensive
---
Hey new player,  here's your venture. 
---
Oh, by the way, those ships mining that that belt?  That's a dude with 5 accounts.   That hauler that went through?  6 accounts.   All those skill injectors on the market?  That's one dude with 300 accounts.  The guy that's watching you and waiting to gank you in 105 systems?  Yep, one guy.
---
Nothing is more detrimental to new and casual players than needing 5+ accounts to do anything in this game.
---
&gt;&gt; SoE hulls
---
hmm, existing or new ones?
---
This remind me so much about how I tried to move my carrier from the outpost in the ass-end of drone regions through the chain of 2 holes and to lowsec after a 4-year cryostasis with nothing but a HELIOS and blind luck. Except my problem was modules that were no longer valid on a carrier.
---
I still remember the screams of my friend, looking at the carrier for the first time, and right on top of him.
---
Always nice to see some solo tech 1.
---
j space best space. go explore learn to survive there and join some nice wh corp.
---
Send corrections to Chuggi, he maintains the list :)
---
Okay. I was doing a nomad krab sesh in a naglfar and made 2 bil in 2ish hours. It was my first time and I needed some support ships to go with me. So I took advantage of the lowsec wormhole in system that wasn’t gonna last more than 16hrs and I injected and flew  in a crane on an alt with 5 days left.
---
So there you have it. I needed skill injectors to fly my crane into an undisclosed enemy farm hole. Where I al squatty pottying until I get discovered hehe.
---
That's kind of a corner case you're proposing here which is extremely silly and quite unlikely to happen, though I'm sure it has in the past.  Please argue honestly, i.e. without autism, the general case, not this extremely unlikely event that doesn't cover 99.999% of use cases.
---
Your ship is your 6th drone in an Algos. It has a bonus to Hybrid tracking which makes it good for a rail fit for additional DPS. Setup a good kiting fit and hammer opponents with your ship and your drones.
---
My mistake .. Thought he played Dr Culber. They kinda look (and sound) alike me thinks.
---
https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hugh_Culber
---
I'd rather get my rewards for free than get have to mine to get them.
---
Maybe youre just getting old.
---
You injected a crane, from what?  Where you *almost* there?  Or from the ground-up?  How many injectors did it take?  You need V for the blockade runner... that's more than 1 injector.  Let's say it was 2.  You earned 2 bill and spent 2 bill on injectors to liberate the loot.
---
Clever!
---
The logic that F2P encourages P2W is the silly part. Dropping $2000 on a game in a weekend... and thinking a $20 in plex is a stop for that? No.  
---
F2P gets more eyeballs, period. It gets more whales, it gets more long term players, it gets more trials who never omega.   
---
P2W (outside a theme park MMO or single player game) is a death sentence for a game. Eve doesn't have it, and is incredibly hard to actually implement in an underhanded way just on mechanics.   
---
P.S. you'd be wrong, I cash sub 11 accounts and have for more than 5 years.... If CCP was just purely out for big figures per person, the Isboxer ban never would have been a thing and bombers would have just been nerfed. Watched more multibox miners quit than I've seen whales join.
---
We're all getting old.
---
Thank you for the useful news anotherinsider.
---
Shit is scary though hahaha. I'll eventually join a corp out there, but I wanna work my way up to it. I still have a LOT of basic mechanics to learn about
---
Fuck off will you dear, there's a good girl.
---
Side note:   There are plenty of wormhole industry corps.  Insane amounts of high end ore, can build a rorqual if mining is your thing, all the gases needed for t3 production, all the relics and data sites, station bonus's for industry.  All resources unlimited, all you have to do is roll a hole.    
---
Unless you're in a C3 high sec, then just biomass yourself, it's cancer.
---
LOL
---
So I guess you don't like profit?  In a situation like this, injecting to fly the titan is pure profit.
---
I spent one on my crane (literally 5 days) one on my scanner.
---
But it’s not really all about liberating the loot. That can be done in a low sp astero. It’s about refueling and re-arming. Now I have a transport for logistics and a full ass Dreadnought with a fair amount of anomalies left.
---
Whether in K space or J space, find the people you like to hang with that also shoot things every once in a while. Golden rule to enjoying this game long term. I lived in highsec for a while early on. It's safe and reliable. But it's the harbor while the rest of EVE is the ocean.
---
You know you can do this while in space remotely, at the time you need to and not before hand right? But you seem to have a little problem with talking to others without calling them a retard right away just because they are able to think for themselves and not agree with you right away, so I'll just ignore you from now on.
---
RIP Agency drugs, their prices will keep soaring and soaring because CCP is not allowing for other ways to get them.
---
&gt; rorqual
---
Just googled that. My God that's a big ship hahaha. I'll look into some of those corps!!
---
Racist
---
Gotcha. I like these guys so far, and it's nice to jump into a low key yet still well equipped corp. If things start to get boring or annoying, I'll head out :)
---
Go back to accounting you boring fuck.
---
One down.  3 to go.
---
Maybe go into wormholes so you can scoop the loot.
---
In 0.0 you cannot get people to bash them at all. But you can get small gang fleets.
---
In J- you can’t get a fleet together because everyone’s bumping over krab holes and taking all the loot.
---
I've never been an accountant.  The visceral nature of your replies tells me you're on a percentage though.  The real question I have is why are you buying skill injectors in Eve when you should be out in the real world looking for a job?
---
Apparently PIBCs long standing policy was join us, blue us, or be destroyed.  Serenety basically achieved stasis.
---
PIBC is coming to TQ because of that stasis.  Despite the fact that they are the ones who knowingly caused it.
---
And we all know exactly what mindset they will be bringing along with them.  We can already see it at work in Frat. and the various othere Serenety refugee groups that have found homes in other large coalitions.
---
Why didn't you train it before you started krabbing?  
---
Poor planning.
---
I think that particular day IS a memorial day for everyone who has committed suicide. Some things are bigger than the metagame and memes, like people suffering from depression and losing their lives. I used to joke about that kind of stuff, like you are now. As I've gotten older, I've come to learn that it's really insensitive and not funny at all.
---
OP shouldn't have lost the Vendetta though, that's on him
---
I inject with sp I train on alts to accelerate my training in order to facilitate the gameplay experience I want to enjoy. 
---
One thing that really gets on my nerves is when some super dork chimes in with commentary about how somethings too expensive.
---
This is a game, this is not real life. Stop trying to kill other people's fun because you personally think it's unwise. This is not estate planning, it is a game that people play in their spare time to have fun.
---
SOE triage titans!!!!
---
F2P is necessary so that the Whales have a ton of scrubs to smash repeatedly and feel good about themselves.
---
I'm technically on your side, but I feel like the average eve player isn't willing to accept the reality.
---
You don't think that ccpls wasn't jealous of farmville generating more in a quarter than eve did in a year?  With what was arguably 1% of the total dev time.
---
Finally the sale of CCP was 225m, plus a 200m performance deferred payment. If they don't hit their numbers they miss out on literally half the payday. I'm sure that most if not all focus is on hitting the number.
---
LOL.. 😁 
---
I'm black too tho so I get a pass. It in my wallet next to the one that gives me clearance to unironically use the word n\*\*\*a without quoting rap lyrics.
---
Your cheating and running the game because you don’t make it as hard for yourself as I do! /s
---
Ye everybody has to find his own way in Eve so good luck to you. Me I dropped into j space right away and never came back.
---
Should’ve lit the cyno with the vandetta.
---
Thanks man :) I totally understand, and I'm always happy to hear other peoples experiences!
---
they're trying so hard to give away SP recently to keep the sub numbers up, imagine what the pop would be like without them
---
I use to run a wh corp so I know how it goes as long as hes not asking for money or your stuff in tax or some shit like that. Helping corp is one thing but they should have a system inplace where they make money with you not off you. A small ore tax or ratting tax nothing that should cripple you.
---
Ive heard way worse than mine borderline labor camps in eve.. Its fucked up some ways players get exploited. Just be smart and advocate for yourself. 
---
And dont be scared to die its part of the game I understand your hesitation but dont hold yourself back because you dont want to lose a ship or w/e. Like the price of a mining barge probably looks crazy to you but its really pennies. Try and find a good scale for isk.. Like a bill looks like alot.. But its only because how little you make as a newbro in HS, be sure to look into DED sites if you plan on sticking around k space.
---
I recommend joining a npsi fleet for some more fun if you got some isk to whelp. check out spectre fleet or keep an eye on BjornBee's twitch channel. I'm pretty sure you can join as a newbro in a cheap tackle frigate. just go to the fleet chat and tell them that you are new and want to fly with them. it really shouldnt be a problem. it seriously is pretty cool when you align somewhere and fleetwarp in a nice purple ball for the first time. be aware that once the pew begins, you probably want more :)
---
Not gonna lie we were on a roam in like 8 jackdaws and wanted a fight but after realizing what the cyno were for we just o7 and left. Sorry to see you lost your Vendetta. Gave me a hard on seeing one undocked
---
ahh kids, makes sense &lt;3
---
You have clearly never been evicted.
---
Maybe they thought: Fuck it, if you guys are gonna bitch over every Event we make, we'll just give you the stuff and be done with it. Can't really blame them either.
---
One word: Eviction.
---
Yeah I think the corp page said like a 2% ore tax or so. Which is a pretty solid deal for what they gave me and gave me access too. Like they're mining a moon currently so I've got fuck tons of resources at a scale I have yet to see.
---
I'm cool with losing a billion if I've earned it, but I'll hang myself if I lose someone else ship worth that much hahaha
---
What are DED sites? I've never heard of them haha.
---
Hello, free industry alts...
---
The mining ones were a bit crap but the ones before it, where you could take a PVP capable ship and farm your rewards were amazing for content. It got so many people out in space that otherwise would never have been shootable. Now you just get a nice playercount spike for the weekend that CCP can show their shareholders.
---
Yay, so after the event I'll have 7mil unallocated SP on my main instead of 6mil... how thrilling.
---
Just googled the difference between a fleet and a corp. I've been thinking they're the same thing. I will absolutely look into joining a fleet. Solo PVP is too much for me, but I'd love to do it as a group every now and again. It reminds me of the game Planetside 2 when you could go out in a big ass group to take a fort. I loved that game haha
---
You got 500 million free sp? Is everything level 5 already or you still adding skills to queue to apply them? I imagine that would take a while and be very wristy. I cannot fathom how gigX would feel to learn this.
---
Just be aware that it's a thing and have fun.
---
Don't put too many eggs in a basket even around your corp.       
---
You may grow to trust each other, but if not at least you won't lose everything.
---
What you mean to say is I've clearly never lost an eviction fight.  Because if you fought an eviction battle and lost it, having injected to fly the doctrine, clearly injecting made no difference to the outcome and all you achieved was wasting your ISK.   Clever!
---
Just stay away from Penif.
---
Will do :) I have some of my stuff in a hangar close by that I haven't moved into their place yet, and I'll keep using it for anything I don't want to risk
---
I injected SP from all the learning skills I trained to V, does that count?
---
True, jamming carriers may/may not be helpful (don't know carrier mechanics).  Dread/fax are the big ones since they depend on locked targets.
---
ECM is the one EWAR type that isn't stacking penalized given its stochastic nature.  Others are capped at "ineffective" due to siege mod electronic hardening: range-damping a FAX reduces it by like 30% after 4 scripted, max skilled celestis damps.
---
Whereas, with no stacking penalties you could blob caps with EWAR subcaps and get results through their electronic hardening.
---
Have your "brother" make an eve account and play once a month for like 5 minutes, have him be the CEO of the corporation, and you just put whatever you don't want to lose as plex inside of a corp hangar.
---
that's what all the gankers do and CCP never touches it.
---
So there's a fleet of, say, 100, and most likely there was one guy who injected to use module X or fly ship Y, and he was the deciding factor in the eviction?  That seems most unlikely.
---
Stop making stuff up.
---
2% really is all right (Just double check it's true).      
---
selling raw ore (or even worse, refining it yourself with bad skills) makes you lose out on much more.
---
What does penif have to do with getting banned? Did I miss something?
---
I'll check! And yes, their refining process is a billion times more efficient than mine hahaha. Well worth the 2%.
---
But it doesn't work that way, and hasn't. P2W in PvP focused games gets you a rapidly declining user base , free or not. Story based it's a wash, there was an end point of play and it doesn't matter if the user does it in a week with zero challenge or years with grind. PvE works because people like watching number variable go up and creating something in their spare time. In PvP, it just leads to higher player churn. Eve has amazing lore, but almost zero story in game. It's PvE is 16+ years old and counting with no sign of improvement, and it's PvP is strategic to the point that P2W honestly doesn't actually work on a player basis. You can't buy a good enough ship or expensive enough modules to consistently win unless you're actually just good at PvP.   
---
Like it's cool to joke about devs being retarded, on any particular thing maybe they are... but in general they do what works in a boundedly rational way. Western MMOs have had no real success with the P2W model. Asian ones have only really had it with graphically insane MMOs (and one I can't remember the name of that is like the ugly stepchild that people still dump money into).   
---
Could PA be pushing CCP? Sure. But CCP is pretty much on the same course they were well before the buyout. Could the triglavian and null changes be be rapidly changing eve to a PvE focused game? Maybe... but it's pretty iffy imho. Would that be bad for the health of the eve player base as a whole? Not particularly.   
---
Yes CCP wants their payday, but they aren't retarded or unaware of literally every other MMO in the industry. It's not as if this is a new concept that isn't tried. Nuking the playerbase is a solid way to just as easily miss out on that payday as well.
---
It's not going to build capitals... please cease and desist
---
Holy smokes you are even dumber than I thought. If one is being evicted and their FC calls for a doctrine they cannot fly then they do noy have the luxury of asking their enemy to wait for them to finish training.
---
He was the one that "meta-gamed" CCP into banning the people from INIT.
---
He very well fucking could be if you dont have the dps to break the enemy logi without him. Do you even play Eve?
---
Read your own posts!
---
EVE is about player interaction, regardless of the type. The game itself is just the frame work and unless you break out of the "must grind pve solo" the game is going to suck. 
---
Shooting someone in the face, scamming them, helping them, teaming up, teaching people. Those are all forms of interaction and if you find something to do that you think is cool, interesting and forces you to go outside your comfort zone while it's a form of interaction with others, then **go** for it.
---
A lot of dead time in the vid, nothing gets locked for the full first minute of the vid.
---
That said, looks like you had fun, and props on the solo pvp.
---
&gt; Standup Capital Shipyard I
---
wat
---
As I said, it's most unlikely and a corner case, not a general one.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/X87ww3a.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/X87ww3a.jpg)
---
Totally agree. Just talking to other people was a million times better than solo. I'll never solo again hahaha
---
I think it's your gameplay style that is the edge case. Good day.
---
Really, so you've just arrived in this WH have you?  You can't fly any doctrine ships?  This example you're using is getting more and more specific.
---
Does this doctrine require plex in the cargohold?
---
The 10 learning skills back in the day.  I got them all out to five.  Ughhhh.
---
I dont live in a wormhole. Evictions happen in nullsec as well.
---
This is a *Premium Shitpost* ™ - not one of those crappy knockoffs...
---
personally i'm already erect, could use 3 injectors pretty badly
---
What did you manage to save? I see the zkill has two mids and two lows missing but you didn’t save the smartbomb or enams.
---
Can hic points prevent supers from docking at keepstars?
---
Thats pretty fair tax then under 5% is usually the goal 10% is base npc. Moon mining is  good source of T1 mats.. Like titanium n stuff in HS gets better out in null. And WHs paradoxically have Hs moons. If they run it weekly its around 1b in ore per cycle. 
---
Lol yea losing other peoples stuff is never fun. Altho sounds like hes got it set up for you to lose some of it. If hes anything like me hes got a stockpile of cheap mods and ships for his members to use with the intent for them to whelp or make isk trying lol. I use to run corp sponsored fleets when the corp pays for the whole fleet. But I was also a Wh ceo.. A bit more income to work with lol.
---
Deds are like dungeons or a boss zone in another game. They are found in space with probes and from escalating a combat anomaly. The boss drops overseer personal effects which can be sold to npcs for a fixed rate and if your lucky they also drop deadspace and faction mods so the green and blue tagged items in market. Stuff named corpi centii pithum.. The list goes on. The point here is they make dank isk and HS spawns up to 4/10
---
Ask google eve uni combat sites.
---
Should lead you to a eve university wiki page woth a bunch more info on all the combat sites deds are like halfway down. Best way to make isk in eve without having some already. 
---
Fly safe mate o7
---
X-47
---
aww, he thinks he's important enough for this to ever happen to him
---
it's adorable
---
The FC has called for a very specific doctrine that he's never called for before, because if he had you'd already have injected it because that's what you do when you can't fly something.  The FC is flying a new doctrine specifically for the eviction?
---
Am I understanding this correctly?
---
You, every day on our mumble channels you mean.
---
Got a source for that?
---
You can't. 
---
There's no protection from being banned, and other players will take any excuse they can get to have you banned. Once you are, CCP won't tell you anything specific about why you're banned or give you a fair chance to defend yourself. You simply wake up one day and can no longer play a game you've invested years (and a ton of money) into, no warning and no recourse. And all of your former friends assume you're guilty and refuse to stand up for you. 
---
Unless you're in CSM. They actually review those cases.
---
Welcome to Eve in 2019!
---
The 2 mids were officer Navs and Lows Officer DDAs + some other 4-5 Bill of faction/Officer that was already in the cargo
---
It is odd to see names I know in local haha.
---
Worst part of being in Horde is not being able to go to geminate for solo fun, does any one know a place that even some close? I have been to Brave and Darkness both odded up in titans being dropped on a 20 man group.
---
Check out the meta show from the weekend
---
Sounds like a fair tax then! And yeah that's about equal to the amount they said they get.
---
He's got a boatload of mods and ammo, gave me access to a couple ships, and let me see all the others he has and just said to ask what I need and he'll transfer them to me.
---
Thanks for the info, they sound super interesting. I'll read up on that Uni page :)
---
Thanks!
---
What did you inject for in X47 that would have made any difference whatsoever to the outcome?  There were literally thousands of people in system.  Don't tell me, ECM burst.
---
Just say you're a lobbyist for some bullshit made up group. Instant case review!
---
Redeeming and using unallocated skillpoints is 100% not skill injecting.
---
That's great, definitely stick with them for a while and learn all you can. You can still learn game mechanics in high-sec and everyone learns at their own speed. Do what makes *you* happy. Just know that there's a lot more out there.
---
For future reference: keep an eye on the recruitment forum every once in a while. It will give you an idea of what different corps have to offer and what experience might be best for you. From there, look at the different groups and try to gauge their maturity levels, activity, etc. You don't want to be in a well-equipped corp where you're the only one online, or the only non-sperglord on comms, etc.
---
In my opinion, PVP is the pinnacle of what this game has to offer experience-wise. So I'd recommend finding a group that has at least a moderate level of PVP activity. But to go with PVP, you need income (PVE) - so find a group that lets you do both. Even if you don't end up being a PVP god, it will still help you understand the game more completely and even help you understand why you make the things you make in industry, for example.
---
Wormholes provide both PVP and PVE, but the time commitment is deceptively large (scanning and hole control/system security will take up a lot of your time) and if you lack multiple accounts you will feel the pressure to expand sooner rather than later (zero regrets with my three, but just FYI).
---
Null has a lot of bloc politics and is much more obligatory with involvement, but the income is fairly safe and reliable and the the PVP opportunities are numerous. Lots of groups out there willing to take noobies and there is no greater learning in this game than by actually doing something.
---
Good luck!
---
All I saw was Mittens drowning in his own Kool-aid. Not that it couldn't necessarily be true, but damn that was peak cringe.
---
implying you need to be important for this to happen to you
---
see: the 70 people banned by CCP during the bonus room fiasco, the goon(s) banned for the monument fiasco for having the wrong forumsname.
---
these happen to nobodies all the time, nothing wrong in protecting yourself from demonstrated incompetence
---
That too.
---
got a link? I just saw that cringey mittani clip from it I didn't know something relevant happened
---
I recently lost one of these. Sad day.
---
Also, as far as skill training: the skills you train for exploration and combat sites/missions are directly transferable to PVP whereas your mining skills are not. Something to consider in your calculations.
---
Taking your Vendetta to a cyno vigil is like pulling up to a funeral wake in a bright yellow lambo.  Kinda douchey.
---
Hmmm good to know! I'm about to start following a skill training guide from online, I'll keep it in mind!
---
Yes, this can happen. Welcome to Eve. Good day.
---
lol if you think this
---
Thanks so much! I actually found this corp on that channel haha. I'll definitely be more open to PVP. I'll talk to some corp members and see if they'd go out with me and give me some support haha.
---
Thanks for the tips, I'll keep all these in mind as I continue to learn haha
---
Heh, I'll be in Japan for all but three of those days so no SP for me!
---
Someone claiming someone did something isn't a source.
---
Use to be some tool that let you do that. Don’t think it exist any more.
---
He needs to charge some home furnishings. His crib looks kinda sparse.
---
Rip plex prices.. like for real this time.. so many sp to extract :)
---
or, perhaps, there is a chance that people in the game don't know that anything special is happening and are around to farm what appears to be easy dumb person cyno kills ?
---
Ok nice, thank you. But won’t I have the same difficulty in getting close to them? I feel like I’ll just get kited by faster ships and die flying at them, whereas when I’m the one trying to maintain distance I at least have the chance to use stasis and such to slow them down. Especially since the Vexor isn’t particularly fast.
---
Where do you go to find fits? Also, what drones would I put on this?
---
Ganking isn't against the rules
---
I want to make an alpha about for my buddy to use. He's stubborn about the skill train being too big of a hurdle to him playing. Can I make an alpha account and just train skills for him until I can get him to pay? Someone told me you can't have an Omega and alpha logged in at the same time?
---
yeah, do it :) going on a fleet is definitely a thing I would recommend any new player to try. and a frigate is not that expensive if you loose it^^ but ships are ammo anyway. it's just great to fly with a bunch of people that just want to have some fun. as a fellow PS2 player just imagine loading up as few Galaxies with a bunch of Max's (dps ships), some Medics/Engineers (logi ships) and a few Infiltrators (tackle ships) and making your way into enemy territory ;) especially npsi (not purple, shoot it = public fleets that everyone can join) are a great way to get into pvp as you dont have to be part of any big corp or alliance to get into fun fights.
---
It appears the only way to get unbanned is to be in goonswarm.   They seem to be the only CCP sanctioned alliance.
---
What ships was he killing?
---
110million SP, all done the 'old fashioned' way.
---
Say no to drugs kids.
---
you'd think it'd take a special kind of social ineptitude to be less likeable and influential than goons, but apparently eve online's player base is charting new nadirs in sociology
---
God it's nice to see someone speaking in a language I understand haha Eve has such a diverse lexicon of terms I get so lost in conversations sometimes. You've definitely convinced me of getting on a fleet. I can't wait to do it after work. That thrill of going out with a group is what I loved about PS2
---
Never run into problems with the voting Core_Char thing, it'll have a few weird UI problems initially but they fix after a few minutes and it's smooth sailing from there.
---
If you dont need them i can have them. Newbie here getting frig bombers rn. 12+ days left
---
U should start solo else it be like playing a match without having ever touched the ball.
---
To add to this idea, if the IHUB goes down, the damage cap disappears. This would make ihub battles the primary engagement for system control, and the follow-up sterilization much easier.
---
Extend this to lowsec FW as well and it offsets using citadels to avoid station lock-out.
---
Disgusting is the only word to describe simple farmers really.
---
\-This is why good P2W games spawn new worlds or perform periodic resets. Introduce new modes and skins.
---
\-Could Paradox be pushing CCP? Its literally a $200 million carrot.
---
\-The CCP dev's aren't the retards, the P2W crowd is.  IMO winning is not more important than getting gud but thats my inner eve player talking.  
---
\-The top 3-5 mobile games are all p2w and generate billion(s) per year.  That's the goal, that's what caused skill extraction; all cosmetic items, and the breaking of plex into 500 units.    
---
\-you're right, the eve players have been quite vocal that they do not want the p2w bullshit that we see in the typical mobile game. Blizzard learned this lesson as well with the D3 auction house. 
---
But, wake up and realize, CCPs new masters don't specifically have much use for the classic eve player.     
---
The only redeeming thing for us, is that we've always secretly been whales, you yourself said you have 11 accounts; I think we all are willing to do the same; given that we can effectively use the accounts.  
---
We just demand that it doesn't come in the form of gold ammo and day 1 rorquals; and we refuse for it to overcome skill.
---
But I don't feel particularly hopeful; i'm sure CCP has already discussed the idea of Plex powered command modules, bosons and Keepstar fuel.  The trick is getting us to agree its a good idea, or attracting a new generation of eve player to replace us first, because they will say "whats the big deal" and never really understand.
---
gf bro! like the fights - cya in space! o7
---
So just so we’re clear, they’re giving away 2x as much SP for logging in as they did for chat being basically unusable for 8 months

this is the SpectreFleet discord. not only will you find all fleets by Spectre itself but also a bunch of other groups that run public fleets. definitely worth checking out. people there are also really friendly and will help you out if you have any questions. see you in fleet ;)
---
Hell Yeah!!!
---
a novelty that literally prevented them from docking, jumping or tethering
---
Yes, 1 billion seconds is the default shield recharge time on Upwell Structures
---
You cannot have both logged in at the same time iirc.  You also cannot queue up many queues on the Alpha account, thus forcing you to log in regularly.
---
That said, if you're happy to keep logging in and queuing stuff up, there's no reason you couldn't keep training up an Alpha clone for him.  
---
I've tried to get a few friends into EVE and I would say that, if he's not bought into it now, it's probably not going to get better quickly!  A maxed out Alpha is still painfully limited.
---
At least you were in the swaggiest Vendetta of the week.
---
Forward Operating Bases are meant as beach heads. In some cases this means groups will drop the structure behind enemy territory or in a soon to be sieged wormhole to build capital ships for the offenders to use
---
Well that's hilarious.
---
It didn't did it.  I mean the range is pretty limited even on the heavies, and that grid is pretty big.  Maybe it stopped one or two.  The battle had already turned by the time we dropped in any case.
---
I am willing to bet you are doing the wrong sites. The WH data and relic sites are really [combat sites with relic and data rewards](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_sites) at the end. If you want the easy payout, solo, no combat sites look for the ones that have a [pirate faction](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites) in the name. Those are K-space data and relic sites that spawn in c1-c3 WHs. Those are pretty good isk for a new/low Sp player who wants to do exploration. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.
---
Why would I change your mind when you are so obviously correct?
---
indeed it is
---
EVE is a game best played with others. It is the only game that can make my heart race and instil genuine fear.
---
There will be good times and there will definitely be bad times, but we play this game for the experience, the thrills we gain and the friends we make.
---
Holy fuck please stop posting forever.
---
Can we stop giving this garbage wallet warrior streamer attention and views?
---
So a Nestor won't be able to handle those combat sites alone?
---
This.
---
My character is less than a week old and I've been having a blast flying a Heron with T1 modules through w-space, getting all the pirate faction sites. You just have to avoid the actual sleeper sites.
---
The idea is to have structure to replace POSs as FOBs, the capital contstruction is something I've known of but not sure of the use for POSs in this use lately. I'm currently just trying to find something that fits the bill but still fleshing my ideas out
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75885170/  
---
I used this one to clean some gas site and (mainly) bait in C2. Sometime I bring back a fish too big for me ^^
---
imo, keep the warp scrambler if you can tank with it. if someone try to kill you, kill the sabre, die, win the isk war.
---
Try using a stratios. Cheaper than a Nestor and can fly around cloaked and can be pretty tanks with duel reps
---
Do you really want to be taking *any* battleship through un-scouted wormhole space solo?
---
You lost that to Simple Farmers......please biomass
---
stop picking on challenged people having fun, where the hell are your moral values
---
When you drop superhics to 0 on a titan ball, range isn't an issue. Few supers can hold down a titan, titans on grid are either 1. DD cycled or 2. Tethered and told to stay so. The bulk of titans dying that day, died while being held down by our supers, I alone got scrams on 7 titans and we were a lot more than just me.
---
I get two of them. I don't honestly need the sp, just found it funny it just happened to land on those days.
---
Just Biomass this post
---
I'm using steam to get into Eve. Do I need to make it separately?
---
It probably could. You are just going to spend 400+ mil isk on a ship that will get killed quickly in WH space solo. A t1/T2 fit pirate data/relic site ship will cost you ~30 mil isk max and will earn many times its cost.
---
If you want to do the combat sites there are many ships that can do them. I know C3 Tengus are popular. As are Gilas.  Just remember a C3 site pays ~40 mil isk. So you need to do lots of them without dying to pay back your ship.
---
\&gt; I'm sure that'll change again soon though.   
---
You entered r/Eve. It's guaranteed to change soon.
---
Mmmmmm if you come through GE with a reasonable sized fleet or small gang, you're not going to get titans dropped on you. If that happened, it was probably Airbornemike being bored. Catch standing fleet is always itching for a good fight.
---
That's clean &amp; pure. The SP at Jita is cut with all sorts of nasty stuff and the injectors are problably used and not cleaned either.
---
Yes, definitely.  There is so much to love about the game.  
---
PvE and PvP are somewhat redundant terms in the context of EVE imo - it's difficult to delineate between the two.  This is literally a huge parallel universe where everything is interconnected. So even if your spending time shooting AI or mining rocks that don't shoot back, your actions affect other players -- what you sell or buy on the market will affect prices and demand, will be bought by someone else and possibly used to create something else, which will also get blown up.
---
Conversely, the actions of others will affect you, even if you don't fight them. In that sense, EVE is about PVP at all levels.  
---
That said, you can avoid fighting with other players, but I would not recommend this.  Get out there and blow some stuff up, whether it's yours or someone else's.
---
You don't get banned right away usually you get warnings. Unless what you are doing it's clear broking the law.
---
Hmmm, I never thought about this. My main account had great trading skills, but then I made an alt and made that my trading char. I guess I can extract my useless trading skills from my main and put them to use elsewhere.
---
Time is worth more then anything in the world
---
Unless you're Nolak. #NOCOLLUSION
---
Kill marks mean nothing 😑
---
I thought most of the CCP staff that play the game were in PL or Snuff?
---
172M SP, never injected.
---
The percentage of cases where someone gets banned falsely is so small you're probably not one of those people. The brisc thing seems like it was a knee-jerk response to a report with only cursory investigation. Some GM got trigger happy.
---
I liked the "oh my god everyone I kill is full of quafe zero" event.
---
On a Caracal a web isnt a good option when you could just use RLML.
---
And fuck off, i've used hams they do not apply well to Damaviks or Drones. 
---
Do you ever do the abyss?
---
Aren't skill books that are only found while exploring not remotely injectable?
---
Because a show called the freaking Meta Show is clearly the leader in trustworthy Eve Online reporting.
---
monument fiasco?
---
//thread tbh
---
No, but one in ten thousand ganks doesn't spawn concord and CCP bans us whenever that happens despite us not intentionally causing it.
---
Hey that's how I got started, exploring in wormholes!
---
I haven't played in 2 years, but this is what I did, and it was great for a beginner. I joined Spectre Fleet which anyone could join for some pickup fleet battles, then I found a wormhole corp where I was making 1B isk every weekend. So I definitely recommend finding a WH corp if you can
---
It would be helpful to jam a carrier, the problem is that they have high sensor strength. You are usually better off jamming their fighters.  being able to jam fax and dreads would be interesting, I am not sure if it would be good though.
---
Good point.  I just had a couple of faxes there (saved a Vendetta and a Nyx).
---
What's the use when everyone has em? Lmao
---
No, it’s still kicking around (or one of them is anyways). [EANM](https://github.com/Bertral/EANM)
---
someone scratched out Xenuria's name on the CCP's EVE monument in iceland.
---
they then banned someone in game based off of their goonfleet username (spoiler alert, they banned the wrong guy simply because his in game character name happened to be that of the guy defacing the monument)
---
Definitely gonna join Spectre, I'll look into WH corps :)
---
I can't fathom the size of the balls on the Vendetta pilots on field that day
---
Oh my where's my free 500m sp, holy shit
---
No kidding right everyone knows this guy is a baby seal
---
They died again? Or this is the third+ thread about a single carrier dying?
---

---
Why should a 300mil structure build 3bil ships?  Why on earth would you build 3bil ships in a war zone?  Why for the love of Bob would you build caps in the weakest structure you possibly could?
---
Why should newbros be able to build caps in the first structure they ever get?  If they were meant to, why can't the Raitaru?
---
What about day trippers and null expeditions? Maybe they need to build caps on the spot?
---
Yea.  But I think if you're not going to fly it in a battle like that there's no point in owning it.  I mean you wouldn't buy it for slightly bigger ticks would you.
---
This is like almost 7 for my pilots! It'll be nice to shave off 2 weeks from the skill Q.
---
welcome to every game. 
---
Let's not pretend giving banned people recourse over their bans is a good idea, that's how you get every single banned player saying they didn't do nothing wrong and appealing non stop. 
---
What people should be clamoring for however is more care on the ban itself, if you're not ready to stand your ground and say the ban is correct and end of discussion these people shouldn't be banned in the first place. False positives will *always* exist, they're inevitable and thinking there's a way to keep them from happening is silly, they should be minimized however and that's the big thing.
---
Spectre was awesome. It gives you all the fun of big group battles for cheap and without any obligations whatsoever. If you already have some friends in game though, that's awesome cuz you can do whatever you want
---
Because that’s not easy to work around at all
---
Aye. Ships are safe at a dock, but that's not what ships are for.
---
Are you an fc or real life politician? Content creator of some sort? No? Good luck then.
---
yep, never injected my toons already 100 mill sp by the time injectors came out so nope
---
Sell me the toon
---
Astero, Astreo, Astreo, I can't say it enough, why put all that isk on the line? You can fit an Astreo out for 50-100mil depending what you want it to do and how blingy you want it.
---
It's even as if not everyone enjoyed spending a week batphoning everyone for a fight that might not even happen.
---
Theres a billion and one problems with this idea. But i’ll just state the main issue
---
&gt;invests money to buy plex
---
&gt;sells plex for isk
---
&gt;server wiped
---
&gt;all assets are deleted
---
If you made it alliance LP for sweet alliance based rewards that weren’t traceable so people couldn’t abuse it that would be super cool. Like you said skins with alliance logo that’s character locked or something so there’s no real way to abuse it.
---

Nah, I don't think EANM would parse those .dat files. It just saves your time from copying those files.
---
I think you mean die while lighting a cyno. Solo cyno, just for intimidation
---
Game experience, failure, and learning from your mistakes 
---
It'll take a while to learn to identify threats... Just takes time.
---
The capital escalation ones are upgraded avengers, they won’t roam in your system if you leave the site.
---
The arithmos tyrannos is the drifter that spawns after you attack the decloaked structure upon completing the site. This is the ship that will roam your system if you do not kill it.
---
What does this same guy losing the same carriers have to do with hurting everyone's feelings
---
So, you and your five buddies get stomped on when you roam into the wrong neighborhood, and you want the game to get nuked for everyone else so that you can compete for a few minutes?
---
I find it worth it. Problem is that you’re guaranteed to be stuck in the site until its dead because it has a 100km+ infinite point. 
---
But you can afk it real good. Just adjust the cap chain once and sit back until it’s dead.
---
haha i had a brave guy try to steal my loot and i hard tackled his ass and put him in  5% structure. “ my loot , or your ship” he gave back all the loot :)
---
v0v, well there should be a better solution but I just manually run versioned backups with Veeam and use ISBoxer to containerize every character in a specific folder. EANM lets me set up copied overviews/settings quickly when doing new char sets.
---
Use a Loki/Legion/Tengu. From what I recall, people sometimes fit beam lasers on stratioses (stratii?), if you have done that, you can quickly cross train into a Legion. If you primarily use missiles, you can do a HAM legion/tengu. The Loki is also pretty flexible and good.
---
Personally, I use the Legion because beams don't take up much space &amp; it looks very pretty.
---
I should probably speed up some parts next time
---
If you're talking t1/faction frigate, you have a case, most assault frigates will murder a firetail without popping adc.

---
Guessing this guy only has one monitor.
---
Do you put the buy orders in one of the low-tax citadels or in Jita itself? Surely for such low margin items, you have to go with citadels, I presume. But don't you end up with items all over the place? How do you deal with that?
---
Backing up sittings made me LOL.
---
No worries, just giving pointers for the next one, because I hope there will be a next one :) As I said, good job on the fights.
---
what did he say?  
---
no sound at work :(
---
Can confirm. Catch standing is usually about 20 or 30 people sitting around waiting for content to show up.
---
Given the effort that people invest into their virtual life in Eve, it's a very fair thing to be concerned about. At the same time, it's understandable that CCP can't really afford to fund a fast moving court of arbitration to deal with every disputed ban and still be a profitable company. 
---
So, here are what I would consider some sensible points:
---
1) People should always support the underlying anarchic, chaotic Eve seed that has defined the game since its beginning. If we start worrying about who is victimised or offended in a very vague way then there is endless scope for bans, disputes, subjective opinions, etc. Against the backdrop of a healthy, rumbling, bubbling Eve it's then easy to spot clear bannable activity such as doxxing, real life threats with context that places them out of game, etc. 
---
2) You can't actually be banned from Eve, it's just a question of money and resources. Aside from the fact that hardware ids can be spoofed, if you have a LAN of PCs, plenty of motherboards and different internet connections with different ISPs, along with a selection of good VPNs, it's impossible to track an Eve player. Eve presents many ways to pay in a non-identifiable format, the simplest of which would be the purchase of timecodes from third party vendors (assuming you don't use isk to plex in-game). 
---
Therefore, as long as your corporation is in the hands of safe, neutrally created identities and assets sensibly managed, an unfair ban need not compromise your operations. 
---
3) If you are wondering if something is a grey area or not, there's no harm in contacting a GM ahead of time and seeking clarification. They won't be able to explicitly exonerate your future actions (otherwise people could white-list an activity and then pretend to do it whilst actually doing something subtly different) but it would surely weigh in your favour in any future dispute regarding a sanction. 
---
4) Invest redundancy in accounts and assets. In my core Eve time I was often operating with no margin to account for loss of any individuals (which also meant needing measures in places in case their PCs failed) which I meant I was always concerned about the impact of a potential accidental ban for a member, even if overturned later. However, from the time I started in 2006, throughout the following decade of extreme activity and technically up to the present day, I've never had an account banned or sanctioned or known anyone in my immediate circle of players who has. So anecdotally, it's also worth keeping in mind that it doesn't happen quite as often as it seems, since people tend not to post on Reddit that they remain unbanned. 
---
I do remember that Princess did once get her account hacked (though not banned) after she clicked on the wrong email (...). I told her to contact CCP and that they might spend a few days investigating. [i]A few days?[/i] She phoned up CCP, demanded to speak to whoever was in charge and after enlisting the help of several overworked employees who surely deserved to spend their lunchtime somewhere better, had her account working again the same afternoon. Gender fluid world it may be but there's still power in being a Girl on the Internet (and a Princess is bonus). 
---
I think if Eve holds true to the vision that has served it so well for decades, then we can drain the Subjective Swamp of nonsense that wastes GM time. I don't think CCP does itself any favours by joining the likes of the Fair Play Alliance, with its slippery view of 'toxicity' and initiated by people who are (no longer) good at either making or (probably, ever) playing them. When the history of virtual words is written a quarter of a century from now, I doubt most of those projects will get a mention.

How are you making an injector every hour or two? Even supercarrier ratting, you earn less than 500 mil per hour, and when you're super ratting what are you still going to inject?
---
This I believe is the major difference between EvE yesteryear and EvE today...
---
I used to watch my friend play back in the late 2000s early 2010s and when u had 4 - 6 hour fleets, you had 2 - 4 hours of fighting.  Now when you have 4 - 6 hour fleets, you have 3 - 5 hours of posturing to get the jump on someone and then 1 hour of structure bash if ur the better posturing team.  If it not that team u sit 3 - 5 systems away hoping to grab no more than 5 stragglers and then head home for that last hour.

I unfortunately lost interest in deep wh space when Caps became op af And my corp dissolved.

Just remember you can change corp whenever, you might lose some stuff but stuff can be rebuilt / re-earned. Especially at the stakes you're playing for now. 10m ISKs will soon be pocket change for you.
---
Anything you base inside a worm hole is basically lost so make a nest egg outside (i.e.: keep isk in the wallet, don't plow everything back into the hole.) If you get evicted or the corps goes tits up, there's no asset safety in WH space.
---
I'll have to wail to the translation, can't tell if that's a cloud of particles or a asteroid.

Whats that structure? Looks like they got eyes in W or K space, can't wait for someone to ID the solar system, wherever that is is about to have a party.
---
Get ready for extirpation y'all, time to get down with the flow.
---
Does it count if I injected my alt into me?

Yeah, they even let RMTers run with out a b... wait they just banned biggest moneylender in GSF

How did you do that? filter by number of planets and then look at the maps?
---
&gt; False positives will always exist, they're inevitable and thinking there's a way to keep them from happening is silly, they should be minimized however and that's the big thing.
---
I agree, but I also think that we, as paying customers (often for years), deserve more than just a cold shoulder and minimal/no chance to defend ourselves if we're accused. It's got to be a balancing act -- it's not realistic to expect CCP to set up a full judiciary to handle ban appeals -- but right now we're on the polar opposite end of the spectrum. We can do better.

The map shows 5 connections, and at least one station which is a minmatar logistics support model orbiting a gas giant. I looked at dotlan region maps for minmatar space, showing station count as the info, for places with 5 connections and at least one station, and then checked it was the right sort of station/in game map. Took about 15 minutes to find the right one.

Well I like to keep my stuff tbh even if I have skill points i them I don't use...

Need to many too s in this game to make it work

Oof, an embarassing loss, but props to you for taking it better than Sasha Grey.

You're aiming to sound like an OOTW on a RN ship. You're getting shelled to fuck and your tone/speech remains neutral. That keeps the fleet from panicing. Excitement is good too. Terror, doubt or panic sucks.
---
TL/DR was playing with a shiney and cynos, got caught, scrambled hecticly to save what mods he could because no poors.
---
Don't be afraid to switch target if the primary is not breaking especially if reps are barely holding. It takes a decent crew to pull off but there's always that one guy on the other side that won't broadcast when everyone yellow boxes and that's in low armor by the time they broadcast. That's how DPS races are won...
---
I fucking peed a little laughing
---
What are the rewards exactly?

---
Erm.. I'm not quite sure I understand... Yes, brawlers lose to kiters if the kiter can keep their distance, but the kiter loses if they get caught. How were you trying to fly your 100mn vexor?
---
The fit I showed has twice the EHP as the fit you linked, deals more damage at 0 with blaster dps, and is faster &amp; more agile with prop mod on (agility is relevant for slingshot maneuvers).
---
To find fits, you could check zkillboard for the ship you want, and try to find a fit that seems to match the use case that you want. In this case, I'd probably go to Vexor -&gt; Solo Kills, find a kill, find the Vexor pilot, and see if I can find their Vexor loss. Otherwise you can just google it or make your own fits.
---
For drones, you have some options. If you're not sure, 2 heavy drones, 2 medium drones, and 6 fast light drones (warrior or acolyte, in case you're tackled by a frigate). Don't lose any drones because you don't really have backups. Otherwise you can bring a split of medium and light drones so you have backup drones.
---
I have only played since 2016, and this would piss me off. Does that make me a bittervet?
---
Out of curiosity do you enjoy hearing yourself ramble on (figuratively, obviously, as this is a text-based medium of communication)?
---
Does this factor in renters because if this is the case darkness, slyce e.t.c should be under imperium?
---
Be high profile IRL, intertwine your IRL persona with your ingame persona so you can potentially claim damages from an unjustified ban in court. Voila! Now CCP's evidence to ban you has to be court-proof, which almost never the case.
---
At no stage did I tell anyone how to play Eve or what to spend their ISK on.  I expressed a series of opinions based on the fact I'm extremely clever; much, much cleverer than you.  In fact I'm always the smartest guy in the room.  You need to accept this fact because there's nothing you can do about it and you're only going to get wrecked arguing with me.

nice video and editing.

here comes the noob question: why do you use a neut and not a NOS? My thoughts so far is that your fit is poorly on cap. Is the extra energy from a NOS not better?

I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don't have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here, so the doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.
---
It is but training a skill in Eve isn't an "activity".  It's completely passive.  If you can't fleet because you don't have the skill and it'll take 14 days to train, that's 14 days you have to do other things than play Eve.  Conceptually the design is quite brilliant.  
---
It used to be the case that you gained SP as you used things.  For example, I went from Afterburner II to Afterburner III by using my afterburner (back in beta).  That's a genuine timesink isn't it.
---
Getting banned is freedom. Embrace it.

---
That’s what I’ve been doing. Problem is I rarely have the skills for every single module, or the capacitor is overloaded because I don’t have management V like these pilots, so I have to make shit substitutes. For example that afterburner, I just substituted in one that sounded good. 
---
&gt; The fit I showed has twice the EHP as the fit you linked, deals more damage at 0 with blaster dps, and is faster &amp; more agile with prop mod on (agility is relevant for slingshot maneuvers).
---
Well thanks, I’ll give it a shot. EHP is definitely important for me, I at least need time to fight and not get 1-shotted. 
---
So what are viable targets? Can I take on Destroyers? Is assume Cruisers, but what about assault cruisers or navy issue Vexor? Battleships are out of the question right? 
---
Also, any tips for actually finding solo engagements? I feel like I only ever find gangs, particularly gate camping ones.

I think this alone might make it way easier for new players to get into the game, setting up layouts along the way has been kinda trial and error, an actual template that players can import would just make sense.

seeing as how this is something that would take less than a minute to do in pyfa, I'm pretty sure op didn't use it.

It is a simple graph to understand. If you need further help, i can ask Barney the Dinosaur to explain it to you.

If they can have a market, do they ever really have anything stocked?

---
CCP are cunts, will always be cunts and never not cunts.

If you get banned and you do not have a law degree, you might as well just sell all your isk now and quit while you are ahead :)

Eve runs decently enough over Chrome Remote Desktop for rewards claiming and skill queue editing.

Doesnt need construction facilities either and should have timers like flex structures.

I would look into joining  Signal Cartel, if you wanna be an explorer. They're a very friendly group of wormholers and explorers. 
---
Plus, the community pretty much is in agreement that they're awesome people, because they are.
---
Great AAR and example of having a good fight without bringing the whole house along!
---
Same (currently 230m sp).
---
I've also got a _lot_ of unused SP thanks to CCP.  Saving it for T3 losses.
---
I've only used injectors on one indy alt, and those injectors were made by me from a sacrificial char a friend transferred to me when he quit; still has over 30m SP on him.
---
I think I have 20 injectors, and 2~3 MCT in a hangar.  I tend to prefer MCT.
---
Literally nobody would like the idea of losing all their hard work and investment. Nobody. Not to mention the financial suicide CCP would be committing. Why would people reinvest after losing so much that they've been working for for so long? And what would stop them from doing it again in the potential future? So why even bother reinvesting all that? 
---
There are literally millions of better paths this game could take.
---
Any names come to mind ?
---
Perfectly described and the exact reason why I could give two shits anymore. For a game that has so much inflation, it just baffles the fuck out of me that people are such pussies and wont take the good fight anymore.

Interesting, how do you think it would “upgrade” the moons? Just trying to understand your idea

This is super helpful, thank you! I'm &lt;24hrs into this game and completely overloaded with info.

Unless it can heal me by shooting lasers at me, I'm not interested.
---
Nice try "pilot is a criminal".  :)
---
PM me your in game name
---
\*\*\*Whatever ship you use, just make sure to check what wormhole effects are being apply when you jump in (if any) as it will dictate what fit you can use.  
---
I.e. don't use an armour fit ship in a pulsar or a shield fit ship in a Wolf Rayet if you want to live.
---
No idea, but it could be something involving filaments and abyssal space, or maybe moon mining laser mods...
---
The Right Order is allied with Laughing buddh(wat?)/The cure as are BSOD, all are lossly aligned with FI.RE

Nope.  You are clean in my books.  👍

I mean it's nice to get a stack of free SP but this does seem rather desperate. Chasing player login stats with 'you must log in every day for this gift' is browser freemium game chicanery, not something you expect from a professional developer.

---
There is really nothing you can do.
---
After all my accounts were perm-banned, I tried to guess why.
---
When CCP finally answered my ticket, I had guessed wrong.
---
It was then a matter of waiting for CCP to complete their investigation, and come to whatever conclusion they were going to come to.
---
Luckily CCP decided to reverse the ban.
---
To retort. In wormholes sometimes you get the opportunity you want a little before you‘re ready for it.
---
As a great man once said. “A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect plan executed next week.”
---
So fuck your over analytical brain.

I get shit done. ;)

Oh you are a child, that makes sense why you think swearing = triggered.
---
He's talking about the alpha injectors that run 60ish million isk.
---
They fear they could lose their epic empire. As long as they have it they are space fame and when they lose it, well they are just them again.
---
Events need to be simple, rewarding, and encourage interaction both cooperative and competitive. The drone event a couple of years ago nailed it: boosters you didn't have to manufacture, ungated sites, and increased rewards in dangerous space. Lowsec was amazing, highsec sites were full of people competing for and sometimes stealing loot, and it was just generally fun for everyone.
---
Well, you said HAM is useless in running abyssal sites, basically telling many t5 running they are wrong and me included to eat shit
---
=X
---
Such confidence very regret
---
U keep coming back after all losses that is how u should play EvE just truck on no other way.
---
A "well fit Stratios" should be able to do combat sites in C1-C2 iirc
---
For C3, especially running one account, T3c is the way to go. I'm about to try it in a laser legion myself.
---
I mean that’s literally what you’ve been bitching about the entire thread. “It’s not worth it.” “Poor planning” “you don’t play eve to have fun” blah blah. But I get it. You are the supreme shit poster. Carry on.

It's literally their coalitions website, discord, TS address and logo. It's not a meme it's their name.

Iron Armada is definitely not part of the Imperium, although they are on friendly terms about their Fountain space.
---
Da Imbalance was helping skillu against DRF back then and has not been evicted / instead been given / allowed to take additional sov, i have them listed there for an eternity already and nobody ever complained. if you have other information, pls share them.
---
Stuff. Stuff that you might use (skins or skill points). And stuff that you will stuff in a container called "crap".
---
What do you mean by 'not solo'?
---
Best source.
---
thanks a lot.
---
The problem here is not reppable structures, it's the imbalance of capitals with cap booster charges.
---
For subcaps, the huge power of cap boosters and ancil shield boosters is balanced by the fact the charges are large and so you can only fit a limited number. Capital ships have such a huge hold and hangar space that you can fit a truly ridiculous amount of tank in cap booster charges.
---
&gt; but, we have an issue of enemies dropping citadels. or neuts. or people from other corps
---
... which you can shoot, creating content
---
You can't claim damages from an unjustified ban in court you nincompoop. You *can* claim damages from CCP publishing a press release saying you engaged in breaking legal non-disclosure agreements.
---
If they did the same to some random (I mean, why?) that person would have the same right to sue, but the potential losses for the ban are probably less than the cost of fighting it. That doesn't apply when you're a high profile figure in a job with enforced ethics requirements.
---
As other people have mentioned, the issues with EVE right now are *mechanical* and not due to the build-up of assets or skillpoints. As long as there are easy ways to bot, easy ways to buy ISK (plex), and highly organized groups, you will always have a situation where certain alliances/coalitions have a relatively dominant position in the universe. That is not an issue, in and of itself. 
---
It *does* become an issue when those entities are able to deploy dozens of nearly invulnerable structures, the ability to have superfleets dock anywhere a keep is anchored, asset safety and ansiblex gates that make their empires again - practically invulnerable. Power disparity is always going to be a thing in Eve because some groups will be better organized than others and the game rightfully rewards those  groups. The issue is that the sov mechanics and, more importantly, citadel mechanics allow for those groups to be at no risk from all but the largest fighting forces in the game.
---
Even I've injected. At one point I'm needing a skill - as in, *yesterday would have been nice!* - it's for a skill that I'm mapped away from, and is going to take more than 40d of training to do.
---
40d of training for something I need yesterday. I spent that isk, no regrets.
---
Abyssal Spodumain
---
Thanks, any idea on whether or not there is actually anything for sale? I was mostly interested in if there were any t1 exploration frigates and fittings for sale.
---
With an alt on grid.
---
Happens all the time to be honest
---
Showing a "fight" where the guy is clearly afk is a bit meh. I suggest showing a bit more fights that were abit more even - this was seal clubbing on repeat. Just my 2 cents
---
Download the EVE launcher and fire the game from there. My first accounts were on Steam, but I quickly stopped using it.
---
&gt;one in ten thousand ganks doesn't spawn concord and CCP bans us whenever that happens despite us not intentionally causing it
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the spawning mechanic is glitchy. I wish CCP would just replace CONCORD with a timed self destruct on the aggressor ship, with shorter timers for higher security space security levels. When Burn Jita occurs there are gigantic furballs of CONCORD vessels all over the place which lag even my high end computer and probably contribute to TiDi.

Which, since it's hostile space, have a long anchor timer which means the owners have plenty of time to arrange a form to shoot them.

That's still me. It's been basically impossible to fly cruisers and above without a ceptor alt for a while now due to gatecamps and near2, unless you like wasting your time
---
Suppose you are an IRL politician, you get banned for an IRL threat (happened to Gigx), but the account is actually in the name of someone else (it's said to have happened to Gigx on a separate occasion). You should get banned on your mains as well (happened to Gigx) but you can claim IRL damages and CCPs case won't hold in court.
---
They were coming back through thera, just as I was going home :D

That's a good gif, made me laugh.

Everyone rags on stain guy for... Having original ideas that aren't hive mind approved?

the $200m is on both player count and revenue. Killing your user base making widely known mistakes would be counter to getting the performance bonus. 
---
You can talk about mobile all you want, there hasn't been any translation from mobile to PC in terms of user spending. They are different markets. A very small number of mobile games make billions. Most that do are puzzle, card, or tie-in games. They all have relatively short lives at the top (when was the last time anyone talked about Angry Birds?).
---
CCP was and is only really valuable as cash flow. Their IP is locked in and very perrisable. It doesn't translate to new titles, it's a niche group, and it has some stigma. Their engineering isn't bad, and at times is actually pretty innovative, but it's entirely possible to just recruit the coders out from under CCP for much less money. Game design is... well it's not bad, especially relative to other game companies of similar size... but it's not $200-$450m good in any universe.
---
The value is the $20-30m in low cost very constant revenue CCP makes. The only thing valuable about CCP is the classic eve player. If they just wanted a spaceship loot box game it would have been much cheaper to make one and spend the money on advertising Clash of Clans style.

I wouldn’t advise trying to kill a VNI with an Asteroid.

Try a T3D, Assault Frigate, Astero or Stratios. Orbit at edge of point range, either pulse your MWD overheating to outrun drones or just kill them if you can’t.

I would like to trade those SP for a working chat...
---
Neut is used defensively, not offensively, I wasted a lot of capacitor using it on the capitals. It's more for ceptors orbiting you at 30 so you can neut them out and get out.
---
Just come fuck around with Test, b0rt loves small gang fights so we won't drop you.
---
Hopefully the memory management issue from the last test is fixed this time around. There was people stating in the last test that the client was eating up like 10GB+ of RAM.
---
Repeat after me:
---
Being banned from an online computer game cannot be challenged in court. The company running the game putting out a press statement accusing you of ethical violations most certainly can.
---
Extra link shitposting: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/station-trading-in-thera/112736 , this forum thread sums up what I would say. Thera is very pvp oriented and a lot of people who pvp there spend most of their time pvping in other places. Unfortunately, with the market tools I use I can’t find any Thera sell orders. I don’t have any proof that my tool includes Thera orders and I’ve personally only been to Thera once. Sorry
---
Yes, After the site has officially been finished (Not when every enemy has been destroyed) A decloaked transmission array will pop into existance. If you agress this in any way the Drifter will spawn which will target the most threatening player. It doesn't drop any particular good loot or anything.
---
I'll be honest, I don't understand why CCP does not have the EveUni Main Page sticked on the newbie help channel or something, I have liked it far too many times for it not to be a basic source of info for new players.
---
The below Stratios fit can run all C1/C2 combat data/relic sites. Web + small lasers is too help with the frigates, but are not required. It’s not a bad idea to travel around in a PVP fit strat (in case of trouble) with a mobile depot + PVE fit in your cargo. Just swap to your PVE fit when you’re ready to run sites. Remember: C1/C2 sleepers do not scram/disrupt! Until you get comfortable, be aligned out and warp if things get too heavy. Also, don’t forget your MTU.

Turn all your SP, assets and such into PLEX? What a novel way to make sure that everyone that does keep playing.. doesn't need to pay for their account for the next year or five. I mean, CCP doesn't need a revenue stream right?

Probably “Can I blap a t3c in an arty naglfar”
---
It uses Ogre II drones as ammunition.
---
Fuel for warp, not jump
---
Depends who you ask plenty of people will tell you they’re  stupid for flying a Nestor.
---
We get them every so often in FW, new kid shows up doing PLEX warfare. Blingy as fuck navy/pirate ship and then gets solo'd but a slasher because they had no idea what "tracking" was. Then they cry in chat a few times and leave leaving behind a trail of a few Bil in lossmails.
---
I was at like 153M before I stopped playing in February.
---
Yikes, bad luck of the year lol. I wasn't on that fleet, but I'll apologize anyway - as a barg fan, that hurts my soul.
---
"Please log in, if only just to redeem some bullshit, numbers are looking horrible."
---
Fuck you CCP, you used to be a cool company that gave presents as a celebration, not just as another excuse to "force" people to log in every single fucking day to get a decent reward... this is not a celebration, this is just another shitty log in event.
---
Now that July-August season period cannot be excuse anymore, which one is the next culprit? Not CCP's imaginary:  "Every week we have about 10,000 people that log into EVE Online for the first time" for sure.
---
The best ship is friendship! An annoying but accurate saying. Flying solo is tough, especially when you are new to the game.
---
Keep at it though, it does get better!
---
Really good job, take my upvote ! Next time could you also list each coalition/alliance members count?
---
Isn’t EVE a real cruel bitch for doing that to this harmless new player? Giving hope and a sense of purpose and pride.
---
I foresee the day where she will kill him just to watch him die, in his shiny new carrier with a shit ton of bling fitted to it and holds full of yummy valuables.
---
Sometimes I think it’s not fair what they do to newbies, but then my cold EVE heart approaches 0 Kelvin and I think “Good, GOOD! Reel him in. Get him close enough to stab his heart.”
---
I’m so sorry, newbro. There’s no hope for you. You’re one of us now :-)
---
The slow but unavoidable slide down the drain seems to be gaining momentum after a long series of CCP fuckups... somehow I'm not surprised.
---
Seriously dissapointed for sure, but that's entirely my fault.
---
I think a more interesting idea would be to start a second shard that is wiped on a schedule every 2 years or so.
---
I only trust Eve Onion.
---
There's a strategy I've seen people using involving a Huginn, Vindicator, and Hexa-2500mm Naglfars, in which the Huginn hits the target with 4x Target Painters to make the sig huge, then the Vindicator hits it with 2x 99% Abyssal Webs to make the velocity 0, and then the Naglfars almost literally can't miss
---
Now that you've said this, I wonder if that same idea works with Quad-35s. (Also on that point, were you testing with Abyssal Gyrostabilizers? Because those can add a nice chunk to the damage.)
---
Good example of how the "drop box" function is abused for loot-denial.
---
Yeh in T5s with a Sac or Cerb, not a fucking T3-T1 where you face more frigs and in a fucking Caracal. 
---
Jesus man, pay attention ffs. Fucking thick as shit.
---
I don’t see anything but a level 4 data signature, I can’t get something there that can scan it right now, someone should open a filament there for sure.
---
Are we still pretending Snuffd aren't imperium?
---
Da imbalance i know almost nothing about. That was just a genuine question
---
Would I tell you I faced 15+ damaviks in a t5?
---
Honestly when you hit 50mil sp it takes alot to what to inject
---
And CCP just announced a 16 day log in gift prize
---
This is gonna cut a huge amount of time off getting skilled into my Ishtar.
---
that's what a junkie would say
---
John Bellicose would roll over in his grave if he saw you using his day to discourage PvP in a PvP game.
---
My chars would be much better overall if they didn't have any capital skills.
---
Given the amount of time I've used capitals, also not worth the SP imvestment.
---
Just in time for a new expansion to spice things up
---
I mean, if you like your corp, there's no reason to leave, but if you get bored you can always leave for a week or two and then come back if you don't like the new corp as much. I've done that a few times.
---
&gt; Unless you're in a C3 high sec, then just biomass yourself, it's cancer.
---
As a new player exploring WH space, I am curious why. Please elaborate for the knoooowledge!
---
I think people are just too afraid of being laughed at for doing crazy shit when they go out on their own. I wish people were more like Bjorn who just goes out and shoots things without caring about killboards and whatnot. If you lose a ship but in the process get a lot of fun out of it then I say the loss is worth the entertainment regardless of what anyone says.
---
Takes a special kind of pathetic human being to post like this.
---
Didn't even rename his ship
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2114993746/
---
Unless you want your killboard to look like this guy's, stick to an astero, or stratios at most, until you figure out how more of the game
---
My god mate you really are fucking thick arent you.
---
What we could say except for "Git Gud"?
---
Why games even exist?
---
Why do human compete against each other?
---
Why we can't build up the utopian communism?
---
Why our greatest dream and ambition failed?
---
If you train logi first, then you can train everything else later ;)
---
You started the fight, why?
---
So ... its dying, right?!
---
Not really my experience, in generally you tend to form way to many dudes in doctrines that are nearly impossible for small gangs to engage.
---
like your often responsible for killing your own content if you want good fights, well you have to give the hostiles a way to walk away with the win.
---
but did you apply all those CCP issued SP points? i did ...
---
Injectors are for the impatient who nerd rage when they fuck up in a multi-billion ISK ship.....
---
Mine it for more than 30 min and your ship blows up!
---
System is nearby Angel Cartel space. 
---
Isn't Angel Cartel lore filled with their supposed Jovian tech they keep to themselves?
---
Could be interesting to at least see that part of their lore brought back into being relevant.
---
It's this damn climate change making summer happen sooner than expected. GRRRRR HAT CO2
---
Yea yall did. Simple Farmer knew what they were doing and were set up to be ready when Brave (Req in this situation.) did something stupid... which they did. 
---
Not like HTP are known for being "woke", no clue why yall didn't just own that you wanted content and got it.
---
You’re not wrong.
---
But it’s just eve online. I don’t mind taking shortcuts.
---
Step 1  Come out publicly with your IRL name and associate it with your in game name.
---
Step 2  Accuse CCP of slander because your in game name is now affiliated with your IRL name and you can't be banned because it will look bad. 
---
Step 3 Publicly claim you will seek all avenues of rectification. 
---
Step 4 ?
---
Step 5 profit

Local Man Discovers What Krabs Are
---
Im ahead. I upgraded after the first test to 64GB RAM.
---
Can't speak for all students but I quit for the spring semester and will be coming back for summer
---
It depends. It probably can the lower ones but isn’t recommended.
---
I Used a Confessor until you can field a ~1Bil isk laser legion. 
---
Best setup is a nomad T3C and the laser legion is best suited for longterm expeditions due to laser M3 being low.
---
You’ll want a cloaky scanner fit./ 
---
A pVE fit.
---
A PVP fit for when you catch unsuspecting Sigils left afk on a hole.
---
In C1-C2 you’re looking for pirate named data sites and ghost sites. (Combat anoms not worth it.
---
In C3’s your doing all the sites you can.
---
Half the fights you are showing are afk dudes ... not really interesting to watch.
---
alliance sized fleet??.........................then, no but about 3-15 ppl then yes. Why?

Posting in annual Eve is dying thread
---
I've only got 8GB (laptop). rip me.
---
Uff. Potato Mode ftw then.
---
Do you really think I give even close to a fuck about being seen as insane by a group of inbred, sister-fucking, nazi, Trump supporters? (or any of the other bottom-of-the-barrel shit stains that populate this sub?)
---
They all have semi-industrial esque cargo capabilities
---
So, to the first point of too many dudes. Yeah there's a lot of us in standing fleet and we get bored so blobs happen - I know it sucks, not terribly fun to do either, but a killmark is a killmark. 
---
To the second point, we very frequently form for good fights if an "enemy" FC pings one of our FCs and says "hey I'm bringing a fleet, let's brawl." We only have a few doctrines we use in Catch and 90% of the time, it's Caracals. If you want to bring a fun fight through, just let someone know in advance and arrange it. We're always down to brawl.
---
If you are banned for an irl threat and it is made to news outlets that can be challenged in court.
---
At least they don't force me to undock anymore.
---
I thought the 500k were for that one day when they onlined the new chat system.
---
The 8 month were ~250k iirc
---
I mean, I, personally, had no idea what was going on. I only vaguely know who John Bellicose was and I didn't know that "his" event was being held on Sunday.
---
HTP had a ping go out that a vendetta was doing something potentially stupid on a lit cyno in Brave staging but when we took a look there were lots of fax on it so we decided it wasn't killable at that time. There's one HTP on the killmail; this was a Simple Farmers drop that happened many hours after the ping I mentioned. I don't know how you go from that to "HTP isn't owning that they wanted content".
---
Already running semi-potato mode. :D
---
Replying to an annual Eve is dying thread comment
---
Even if my numbers are off I feel like you’re still proving my point lol
---
TBF HTP/Simple Farmer were being homogenized. It was primarily simple farmer.
---
When newbros never log in again after getting them all set up.
---
This is why I stopped playing
---
I think point he was making is you wouldn't be bored in standing fleet if you guys didn't overkill all the time, since more people would come for fights. As for arranged brawls that's shit is just lame.
---
I assume that to test the 64-bit Client you need the 64-Bit Client, right?  
---
Where does one get it?
---
Guys getting mia during the process in General
---
And still we are working rather quick on Apps
---
Nice vid asilthar. Ramming ceptors in a kestrel is my favorite pastime.
---
as a perpetual newbro for a decade, thanks for putting up with my scrubness.
---
Can you tell us why the FUCKING HELL that vendetta has hyper rigs???
---
People who say they do "Industry" but really just mean they want to join you for the mining. 
---
Then they throw a tantrum over how "THE WHOLE GAME LIVES AND DIES ON THE BACKS OF MINERS LIKE US! WITHOUT US, YOU CAN'T PVP! YOU SHOULD BE TREATING US LIKE GODS, YOU PATHETIC F1 MONKEY."
---
good times
---
28 simple farmers
---
1 htp
---
"primarily simple farmers"
---
Like I don't disagree that someone in SF knew what was going on and was watching for a target of opportunity to present itself. However, I can't say that there is anything linking the pete to SF. 
---
I don't see why SF should *not* drop on a vendetta and ragnarok which have broken tether to PVP (and pvp a slippypete at long range) at an event where brave specifically invited people to come pvp...?
---
[Unless you're suggesting that the NSH pete was actually a simple farmers spy all along...](https://i.imgur.com/o4prY1O.png)
---
Only if u like playing with them
---
Counterpoint - arranged brawls are fun. Additionally, people have differing opinions on things.
---
And we get tons of content coming through GE every day. People come to us because they know they'll get a fight. Don't come to a corp's staging system if you don't want to fight everyone in the corp. We're not going to delegate dispatches of small gangs to defend gates based on what jumps in. You're only going to get over killed if a) you come solo and don't specifically request good fights at the sun - we have a PH person that does this regularly, or b) You're Redline and you bring a solo dread to our home system. Most other times, you're probably going to get a Caracal fleet or the standing kitchen sink.
---
Everything is dying... even you!
---
On a serious note I recently came back after a few month break and have been greeted by nothing but content. More fights than I really can remember the last 5 or 6 years.
---
I guess numbers dont lie, but oddly I'm getting quite a bit more action than normal!!
---
that´s not summer. it´s just people quitting the game. summer goes on top of that.
---
Woof. They join you for the mining?
---
Let me guess. Former Highsec miners who expect you to act like concord?
---
Don't get wrong I have nothing against blobbing but Brave were way more fun back in the Querious days before they became tryhard.
---
Oh man. Yeah and then they get annoyed you kicked them after 4 months of no activity.
---
I think he's talking about the coalition map which has panfam as Northern Pandemic.
---
Incredible as people can complain about anything, even about free stuff.
---
If you don't like the game anymore gimme your stuff and quit xD
---
Omega status SP bonus: 500
---
Alpha status SP bonus: 50
---
😂 enjoy your free mids meal.
---
becuz casuls
---
You're not wrong. Although a lot of our tryhards (BO-LD) left very recently to join Test. The remaining Catch nublets are pretty chill these days.
---
Yup, it's exactly those type of individuals.
---
Just in general: there's a subset of people who are hoping against hope that they'll find a group that will magically keep them in the game, and engaged, but don't understand, or accept, that it requires a lot of effort on their part to make that happen. 
---
It's the catch-22 of the effort to drive new players into player-run corps: yes, it will tend over time to keep them in the game, but only if they're willing to do the work. EVE is not even remotely a passive game, and I'm not sure how well that's communicated to potential and new players.
---
In terms of real life sacrifice, I like the current setup, even for offensive play. It was super annoying trying to figure out stront levels and having to manage it as a CEO or as an attacking FC. Was no fun.
---
Taking over regions before citadel and fozzie sov was cancerous. It's hard to imagine an active FC or leader that knew Dominion sov would promote the past compared to the current setup.
---
Sure there maybe tweaks we can do, but its way better right now than before.
---
You can’t have an alpha logged in at the same time as your omega though. There’s really no way around it unless you have 2 PCs running side by side. Even then it’s still officially against the rules.
---
I think that was a corp that I joined when I first started, first time I was getting into Null-sec, it was pretty bad, but I did learn a lot from the experience and found a lot better corps afterward.
---
One whole eve online!
---
Oh no people get a cosmetic no ones going to look at - the end is nigh
---
No they're in NC., hate Goons and are actively T20ing all the time...
---
&lt;narrative&gt;
---
I demand my gold monocle
---
I think they're dropping only the "grey's".
---
When you get killed feel free to PM the guy who did it. Most times they will be happy to tell you what you did wrong and share fits that could be better suited for what you are doing. That won't refrain them/me to kill you again in the future tho.
---
Honestly, they need to either do seperate balance paths for WH and normal space (lol, CCreee can't even handle one) or make it so you can't drop structures in WH since they were never intended to be lived in in the first place.  Unfortunately there's no real way to balance for the two vastly different environments without boning one or the other without seperate changes.
---
Spring is better for being outdoors than summer, anyway.
---
That's actually exactly what happened! He gave me Isk and then we chatted for a little while :)
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
Yeah.
---
And to add a subset of players who get mad when they lose ships or a fight once.
---
Like bro. We just fucked up the last hundred fleets. You leave the one time we get outnumbered.
---
But will It be in a xtrasquishy video?
---
The overlap between bad posts and people that sign their post is amazing.
---
They used to be a part of The Imperium but left a few months ago.
---
That seems unlikely.
---
Try keeping at range instead of orbiting 500. You're using blasters and you aren't tracking very well by orbiting 500.
---
As many as you can get online and in fleet
---
1
---
if the target is a retard
---
imo it was when CCP gave us those boosters to be able to inject without SP loss. so far that's the only time I've injected one of my mains,  went up ~10mil SP each don't think I've applied any of it yet.
---
AFAIK using two PCs side-by-side to run alphas alongside other accounts isn't \*technically\* a EULA violation.
---
You’re a towel.
---
No one ever ran the numbers ?
---
&gt; EVE is not even remotely a passive game, and I'm not sure how well that's communicated to potential and new players.
---
i'm going to disagree.
---
i earn all my isk by clicking a few times a week to set up all my passive revenue streams (industry, reactions, pi, market orders, etc.) and then log out until a ping comes up for a fleet.
---
i don't really do anything active and i don't seem to be missing out on anything. i get 'content', i get isk, my account stays omega.
---
i can't see any way that i'd get more out of eve by putting any more effort in than the bare minimum.
---
a) Install Pyfa
---
b) Make fits for targets and bombers
---
c) ?????
---
d) Profit!
---
Oh I'm sure someone has, but that person is not me
---
Are you in nullsec or lowsec or is this actually solo in a wh somewhere without cynos
---
FLEEP need no man
---
They aint pets
---
I forget to deploy mine half the time... and when I do remember, I always warp off without them.
---
Really bad spies. For fucks sake, be entertaining at least.
---
Not like I’ve read the EULA so I can’t say for certain one way or the other, but that’s not what I heard from others. They said you could maybe pass it off as a friend/relative was operating the alpha if you got caught somehow but that it was technically against the rules. 
---
Either way, if it’s to the point you need a whole different PC you might as well just sub the second account is more my point lol
---
Don't forget afk mining
---
???
---
It's 1,000,000 SP for both Alpha and Omega clones.
---
No worries, that barg gave me some great memories, one time I managed to tackle and tank 3 capitals until backup arrived - I was 1v1ing a carrier that warped in a mino and phoenix, when he died he complained that it wasnt a fair 1v1.
---
Thanks, I've been flying a lot of bling stuff recently and have a few more clips laying around using a similar expensive bhaalgorn and vindicator
---
I don’t think so. 
---
&gt; Both Alpha and Omega pilots can claim rewards daily, although the Omega rewards are a bit more valuable. If you’re an Alpha pilot and you like the look of the rewards that Omegas have up for grabs, you can even upgrade after the celebrations start and you’ll receive all the omega rewards you missed retroactively.
---
And they say. “Largest sp give away for both alpha and omega with up to 1 Million sp. 
---
Omegas will get 1Million.
---
I highly doubt Alpacas will get 1 Million. It only says they’re getting more than ever before.
---
Hahahaha epic
---
Hello there! I am a bot raising awareness of Alpacas
---
 Here is an Alpaca Fact:
---
 Alpacas do not pull up plants by the roots as cattle do. This keeps the soil intact and decreases erosion.

dont worry mate, awesome video  
---
its the same discussion popping up basically everytime someone posts a solo video, it really hurts esp in Lucys videos cause hes so damn good that all those trolls crawl out of their holes and claim its not solo cause you have an hauler on an alt with cap boosters lel
---
This is correct, all you need is to have a higher dose then the passive tegen of the ship you are fighting. Given an afk enemy and a poor fit , 1 bomber is plenty enough.
---
Our US TZ Goon-titans hunting squad doesn't have to pretend. They even got one not that long ago.

When upset spergs reply to my Reddit comments because they're upset that a dino inappropriately touched them.
---
We're way cool and always recruiting cool people too
---
But it'll probably help with the injector pricing.
---
Higher plex price means higher injector prices ;) because 90% of the injectors are from sp farms so the price will also be higher
---
&gt; because you were banned for a damaging reason
---
This is why CCP doesn't publicly say shit about normal bans.
---
If your ban reason on the login screen is "racial abuse" your reputation can't be harmed unless you screenshot it and make it public yourself. In which case you have no leg to stand on because you are the one putting it out there.

I dnt have recruitment process. Just apply to Xup and kill or die.
---
You got reimbursed the SP and plus the net gain from having them too. It is those who only trained to 4 who regret not training to 5 years before the change. That is the real ugggghhhh.
---
Sounds like you're just bored/jaded with the game overall, which is cool; many of us have been there. 
---
But there's no reason to belittle people who are still hyped. I think skill injectors have been horrible for the game but I can admit there are definitely times when you want this new skill on this toon right now.
---
Yeah, I’m the kind of guy to log in maybe once a week to do some explo or standing fleet logi, and I still have fun. Though I am planning to sub over the summer and get into some more wormholing, but I just don’t have time right now.
---
i'm just asking if anyone already downed each of these targets, and how many bombers does it require... i don't really plan on doing this ! just general knowledge question ! :)
---
Arranged brawls can be fun, but are often a pain to setup plus now you have to set them up somewhere where you won't get 3rd partied by the rest of brave. 
---
The pressure of numbers alone isn't the issue your doctrine pool is deliberately designed to be impossible to engage by any nano cruiser doctrine, like the hostiles can't brawl because you have a massive numerical advantage (plus caps to back up a losing brawl) can't kite because you have a range advantage that leaves most doctrines well dead in the water.
---
What happened to people with 8gb machines?
---
It's not summer yet lmfao like 98% of schools aren't out yet
---
Having a ceptor alt make a huge difference. You know it.  Your video is great i dont say the opposite.

It s just not solo. Or me 2 i solo small gang with my 2 dread, super and fax. Hey it s still me with my four cap on grid ;)

I'm not going to spend any more time trying to convince you to come fight us. All I know is we have a blast getting our shit pushed in regularly by all kinds of stuff and in all the time I've been playing, we've only dropped caps a couple times, and it was either on other caps or on the Initiative guys that live in HY and only fly blinged out battleships. Come play if you want, otherwise, you do you.

Don't follow my instructions:

Me: "glad you're returning to the game after do many years. Go to this link to give me full ESI access. Login and just click accept."

Them, after 10 minutes of silence: "okay I've logged in to my account management to do the ESI thing. I heard it relaxed api..."
---
Me: "no, go to the site I linked you and login there over sso."
---
Them after 5 minutes: "I can't see where this esi thing is in my account management page..."

Dude are you listening to me? I understand that's this API used to work - I used to give it out myself... But the inability to follow some, written instructions doesn't bode well for your chance to join us...

&gt;  Imperium alone can take on "rest of eve" alone atm 
---
True but then again not. last time I saw they had titan parity with the rest of eve, but had a significantly lower number of supers. Thing is, they would have to fight on a lot of fronts in a lot of different TZs. Add to that their krabbing would be significantly disrupted as your umbrella has to exercise a lot of caution, as to not get baited and loose precious capitals. They would maybe hold their own for a limited defensive war, but they wouldn't be able to stem a WWB type scenario.

Check what this new bro at the above link posted recently. Both u and ur mate should read through that entire post.
---
That new bro has been doing pvp since 1 month in and is only 3 months old. Does not have a crazy amount of sp either. But he is having a blast and is currently one of the top pilots for kills in a thrasher. Skillpoints got nothing to do with enjoying this game at least not at the start.
---
Your mate is wrong in thinking that skills will hold him back. Even if you give him a 30m sp character he will not be able to know how to effectively use majority of those skillpoints. 
---
To be honest if he does not understand the above he probably does not have to right sort of desire to stick to the game long term anyway.
---
Time useful for training, for gaining resources, for learn how to play this game.
---
And after those 10 days? What have you learned?
---
There will always be some skill or some ship you'll want to use, inject for one of those is not a solution, you'll want to inject for the next one, and the next and so on...
---
The 1st thing I learned in this game when I started long time ago was that the most useful skill is not intelligence, willpower, memory, perception or charisma... it's patience and humbleness.
---
As new player you must be humble to accept that you know nothing about Eve and must ask, ask, and again ask, and in the end perhaps you will learn something, this require time and patience.
---
It was a natural process before injectors, and the game itself pushed the player to follow this wise path, now...
---
Remember forgetting what you learned if you forgot to upgrade your clone? Hahaha. I lost JDC 5,  2 times on one alt lol.
---
Fkn gottem
---
I'm assuming you can't just log in and log out 16 times?
---
Nestor is good for c5 ratting with your Corp.
---
Oh I just realized that also had TRI and you guys listed.  BS was just us, cones, weekend, and novac.
---
Let me guess, you also got killed by us. :)
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Spellcheck next time mongo
---
thing is though, "rest of eve" isn't a thing. there is no situation atm were Legacy and PANFAM and PANFAM would trust the other enough to put their supers on the same citadel
---
Goons is already big enough to cover multiple timezones, it doesn't really ahve anything to say though, it would be their timers to defend. They can set those to whatever they want
---
A wwb scenario isn't going to happen as long as test is licking goons asshole every day
---
&gt; big wars don't really do that 
---
Not if they aren#t super big at least. EVE tends to have an influx of new player (most of which don't stay tbh) after we make the news for a few days with "$x destroyed in largest internet battle in history"
---
True it's difficult to find fights these days. Either Afk dudes or people running away. But I'll try and get more interesting footage.
---
No, they are not.
---
Last summer was a huge exception thanks to Goon attack on the North. Thanks for the fights, btw!
---
This can easily be fact-checked in Eve-Offline stats
---
Hey dont knock PIRAT, they had a busy day yesterday killing unfitted Stilettos.  Thats some elite pvp there!

The other day the excuse was Easter holidays in the West.

What's the explanation this week? Orthodox Easter? What will be the next one then?
---

---
Imagine not being able to react to pings, having commissars in your alliance and on top having to share it with a disturbing amount of weebs and furries. Tapi needs a meteor.
---
Galmilistan is dead yep
---
If you're content with that, that's great; but there is a lot of content you are missing. Other than passive income and linemembering, there is a lot to do; you could be fighting with a small gang, honing your piloting skills, exploring, hotdropping, t1 bs memes, etc. There's way more to do than I even want to bother to name honestly.
---
Like, if you're cool with your current gameplay that's great, man. Congrats on finding your niche.
---
I know what /u/emmaline's talking about though, and it's people who arent comfortable in their niche but expect their group and the game to conform to their needs. Expecting content to magically materialize on your doorstep, and only when they're in a mood for it and not krabbing, etc.
---
Desperate times require desperate measures.
---
Well, thanks for the gifts CCP, but I'd rather pay my subs, get no gifts, but you fix this stagnant game of castles (aka shitadels).
---
And Fozzie's head (not IRL, ofc).
---
&gt; Problem is I rarely have the skills for every single module
---
Meta replacements are usually fine, otherwise you can ask in the English Help channel. As for the afterburner, it's the wrong size (cruisers use 10mn), but it's really just the least of the problems with that fit.
---
&gt; or the capacitor is overloaded because I don’t have management V
---
Are you trying to make your fits cap-stable? Because you don't need anything close to that.
---
&gt;So what are viable targets?
---
A really general question, to be honest. I'd just ram your face into almost anything that moves and analyze the fight afterward. What was their fit? What led to your victory/defeat? Starting conditions? Decisions made? Do be careful with Vexor Navy Issues though, they're just very strong. PvP battleships are likely to be fit to kill smaller targets, so I'd be a litle wary.
---
&gt; Also, any tips for actually finding solo engagements?
---
Faction warfare is the best for solo/small gang engagements. Proper usage of complexes can help you in finding 1v1 fights.
---
&gt; If you cant replace it dont use it.
---
if you can't afford to buy it twice you can't afford it
---
2 accounts and 5 chars completely skilled and specialized in their jobs  (PVP, PVE, industry and reprocessing and hauling, mining, trading and hauling) without injectors for almost 300M SP in total.
---
Now I reached some of my biggest objectives in this game, things I started years ago, I desired them, I planned for them, and now I feel so satisfied, better than any pvp battle or any kill.
---
That's why I'm so sad about players who cannot stay without injectors, they will never, never feed that satisfaction with injectors, only patience and perseverence and planning can give you those feelings.
---
From my point of view they are wasting time and opportunities, perhaps one day they will understand, but that day Eve will be lost forever...
---
I liked the buildup, most of the fight is all about the catch and setup vs blobs. Nice vid!
---
They’re probably spies
---
Listen guy if you want a broken puppy, go to a shelter.
---
toasting in bread
---
True true. Going to try and get some good fights for the next video hopefully some people will actually fight rather running away
---
can someone add a useless red circle? I'm not sure what I'm looking at here
---
Dunno why this got downvoted because it's absolutely the truth. Big fights are AIDS. Crashes, disconnects and non-functional mechanics *everywhere.* And while the average line member can probably just log off if they are fed up, no hard feelings towards them as you might be sitting there for literally hours just watching the caps go at it, think about FCs, recons and cap pilots. They probably took the day off and it's very likely that they will be there for the entire duration of the fight in one form or another. And I hold mad respect for them because of it. Sitting in front of a screen for ***upwards of 10 hours*** just to be told that your cap fleet lost, so you'll stand down is not fun in any capacity. Anyone who unironically says that they don't think it's that bad has never fought in one.
---
Thanks. Well, Rogue University just kicked me out for absolutely no reason and gave me no explanation other than "we don't want people like you" and "you were deemed a potential security threat." What the fuck? Is that kind of thing common? I don't want to keep investing time into joining corps only for them to pull.... whatever the fuck that bullcrap is. 
---
Anyway, I guess now that I'm not in a corp I can join a FW militia, and go to the North West FW area where the real action is. Amarr was boring anyway.
---
 several interpretations:
---
A- Winter is gone, now it's Spring?
---
B- Winterco is disbanding?
---
C- Someone called "Winter" is dead
---
D- If it's what I think , delete this now
---
These numbers are typical for late July, early August. Sundays (outside August) haven't been that low in years.
---
Move to London to get better ticks
---
What do you hunt titans in?
---
I'm here
---
I can’t upvote this enough. It’s like everyone missed the second part where we get 1,000,000 free SP.
---
CCP, you really know how to stroke my G-spot.
---
he means he's dumb as fuck and not worth wasting time on
---
The first one has just gone up... enjoy

Says you, we just had a blizzard
---
? I don't understand
---
I have mixed feelings about this idea. I’m more inclined against it, but not totally opposed for empire faction LP stores only. 
---
I don’t think making pirate LP shops easier to cash in at would be good for the game. That’s for sure. A lot of those goods are expensive, and the logistical hassle of shipping them back to empire space is one of them.
---
Doubted non of that. But goons fighting the rest of EVE is also a fictional scenario, so it's not a far way off of a scenario that seemed implausible and still happened. And I do think that TEST would join in on the rapetrain should it ever happen again.
---
Also, sure goons can *cover* several TZs, but they can't consistently outform TZs other than US when a lot of the other corps are more evenly split. And I wouldn't be sure they can even outform US after a few weeks. All out war in EVE is just literally playing in the most soul crushingly shitty way possible so your enemy just doesn't fight you anymore.
---
I'd assume that they went to swap.
---
Link to fit?
---
I said pet peeves. Not process.
---
You just hang out to tell everyone that even though you have not played in months?
---
Nah your people were trash and got embarrassed last time you engaged me.
---
What do you think about the Harpy?
---
Damage wasn't an issue with it alphaing for 70k. Just tracking and hitting at 120m/s when double webbed.
---
Titans.
---
How many dreads would you need to do it
---
Nice match, shows how much little changes can affect a game.
---
Big fan on the templis choice of a vigil over the talwar, application helps so much with a hml fit.
---
Thanks to everyone involved staying committed despite developers.

All the rorquals are named 'newbie shield regen VNI, rigs in cargo' :)

Krabbing
---
It doesn't anymore.
---
Highsec combat exploration, anoms for faction spawns and escalations, unrated for the same, ded sites for the loot.
---
Titans are hunted in covert-bombers, newbie-ships, pods, neutral alts, discords... once you get a potential target - you set up the drop with whatever you got.
---
I do not hunt titans. I do not hunt anything for that matter. I'm an f1 logi monkey, only log in for pings. SNUFF do, however, have quite a few hunters, and when they find stuff - I join in =]
---
Are the "Servant Sisters of EVE" different from the regular "Sisters of EVE"
---
Or is that the Servant part gets dropped off in common usage?
---
Corp ceo here,
---
With all the time it takes running a corp I just dont have the time anymore to load up my ratters.
---
In order to counter this, during peak activity times I raise corp taxes by around 30% and use the surplus to fuel my capsuleer needs, the rest just goes to the alliance for the general tax pool.
---
C3 High sec is probably the highest traffic wormhole in existence.  This is not good for an industry corp (if that's your thing).  It SOUNDS good at first glance because you have instant access to high sec, but you have higher class wormhole rolling into you looking for a high sec, you have day tripping explorers/site runners (which is kind of easy money).  Anyone that wants to evict you can do so without much effort at all.   More often than not, you'll find yourself camped out of your own static.  Total pain in the ass.
---
good luck breaking links if you can't break dps
---
sorry to ruin ccp's big twist or whatever, but the triangle people actually don't like us that much and we will be siding with sleepers to fight them instead. new playable faction will be sleepers
---
That does irritate me a little and I'm not sure why the hell it does. Hmmm...
---
Will probably never happen, though when citadels were first released people complained about being bumped and killed, CCP reimbursed some losses, then made a statement that you could be bumped while tethered, and they were working on making ships not bumpable while tethered.
---
Fuck me, I've had this argument with potential recruits more than I want to admit. 
---
And we're primarily an industry corp, everyone mines and pews.
---
And then they get pissed when I tell them no. You don't want to pull your weight? You want an exception to our simple "if you're online you're expected to participate in home defense rule"? No pap requirements, etc? Go fuck yourself. 
---
Just had this fight with a recruit yesterday. I'm triggered as shit right now.
---
I have ID'd the solar system if you want details
---
PLEXing. I can afford it IRL, I don't spend a whole lot of isk anyway, I have neither the time nor the will to grind isk.
---
Hey, don't be pulling the victim race card here. It might be what they were doing but there's no real proof and you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Don't take it so personally.
---
It could be any range of things. I, for one, was rejected from applying to Dreddit and Brand Newbros in TEST for an unspecified reason and indefinite period of time and I wasn't allowed to ask why, even though I was a part of Dreddit for my first month or so of play.
---
If you shoot Rogue University an EvEMail back, they might be able to help you. Or you can just join a new corp.
---
because I don't have access to the coalition map, please tell u/chuggi and u/Verite_Rendition to change it.

since when is that? to my information they still are. do you have any closer information?

Dropped.

Seconded
---
What Corp is this?
---
since this is not a map-help-list alone anymore, i think i'lla dd them next time, yes. why not. (although i will not keep the member count in the post updated afterwards, obviously as i have a life)
---
what do you mean with integrating list and map?
---
Maybe, but winter is coming.
---
You must inject. join us.
---
You can only use them as alpha and even then, they are more expensive and slower (one per day) than if you simply go omega, train normally and get access to all ships as a side effect.

1j in Perimeter.
---
~90% of items are sold to me in Jita 4-4.
---
~7% are sold to me in big piles in Perimeter keepstar. Those get collateralized courier contracts set up for them.
---
The others, I hold onto a while, then when I want to artificially lower the price I post them all at once halfway between 4-4 sell orders and 4-4 buy orders. It floods the entire screen, and sellers feel compelled to either buy them all out, or to undercut with their own stock (which is in Jita 4-4 usually). Win either way.
---
Wow, weird stuff. I guess since I’m new, I’m trying to figure out what happened because I don’t want to keep getting kicked from corps I join. But I know I didn’t do anything besides fly around in a frigate, get blown up by campers and follow their guides and stuff. So it probably isn’t personal, you’re right. Just hard to understand why but, some organizations are just a bunch of cunts. 
---
Dreddit struck me as a take-themselves-too-seriously, hardass group of tryhards by the way, not sure how accurate that is haha
---
I think you missed the point. Extorting isk out of your members, I was looking for a name so I can avoid you entirely.

How about the shitty recruiters that say they do everything but really don't do anything?

If you guys have any feedback, please let us know, as we're planning to record the second day of competition on the 11th where the winner will be decided - Anything you can think of that we can do to make the show better would be greatly appreciated!

Yep, got rid of my krabbing alts, and give myself a 2000 plex budget to welp a month. Much happier overall, and it's cheaper.
---
Glad you’re enjoying the game, my best tip for new players is: don’t mine. Low-level mining has probably made more people leave this game than anything else.
---
lol wooosh
---
There are some people who seed the market, but it is rather spacer with significant markups. You will find most exploration stuff seeded though.
---
Stick with this and when alphas and omegas both get over 1m sp you might be able to inject literacy V

Hire a cloaky camper, after a month they'll all drop corp.

I would really like to discuss this further with you, reddit is so funky to use.
---
Would you mind stopping by our ingame channel "Sub--Zero", I really  dont think its that bad, would love to talk about this further.
---
Nerrrrrd! ;)

is it just for me or is the spectator footage stuttering af?
---
One of the best aspects of Eve is continue skill training. Everytime I've gotten bored and taken a break it has been great coming back, mostly because ill have new skills to play with.
---
I do a little bit of everything to keep things interesting. Some ratting, some mining, some manufacturing, some PVP.  
---
And I buy Plex to stay afloat because I'm terrible with finances.
---
Shield nestors are a thing, but it is generally done as a solo nestor fit, as nestors are bonused for remote RR. That particular fit is more commonly seen with snakes as they can do the same thing but they have a hull bonus for shield resists. I don't know why he was using nestors instead of snakes, maybe he didn't have Caldari battleship trained on those characters?
---
Dont quite understand but blap dreads are perfectly. Need at least a dread (preferrably dropped 30-40k away) and a vindi with 2-3 webs alongside a huginn or loki with tps.
---
   
---
Always great fun turbodunking slow armor comps with blap dreads.
---
Yeah, that's an unfortunate consequence of having to record 2 client views simultaneously in order to get Fancy UI to display properly. Our cameraman's computer is not quite stronk enough to deal with all that GPU intensity.
---
Yes and now they can finally return to camping level 3 mission hubs and ruining live events.
---
Lol. Like when they get mad after I ask them for APIs.
---
I'll never understand how people manage to make this same post unironically ever year.
---
ignore step 1 and 2. If you are in a super you can solo kill every one!!
---
If anybody every tries to call Goons a blue doughnut, show them this.
---
sad man, ruins quite alot of the fun :/
---
Maybe they should start making the game more interesting instead of boring and tedious.
---
How much do you get per character?

"When I was in [xyz corp/alliance] we did it this way." Like yeah, it would be good advice if that group didn't fold. "I oftenly did that this way when I was with [xyz corp/alliance thats also dead]." Yeah, look buddy, it obviously didnt work out for them or else you'd still be with them. If it's something done by a group which is thriving, that's another story.)
---
What really rustled my jimmies once I was getting ready to organize a rolling/roaming sessions of our static. And then one guy who wasnt on comms, gets on comms and is like "dont roll it, im soloing out of the static." He left for another group on his own, but holy fuck he's never going to be welcome back if he changes his mind.
---
Once this guy started rapping on comms, while we were hunting (I did tell him to stfu). That was one of those moments where I thought long and hard; do I just drop corp now? 
---
I once had a head of an alliance approach me in the recruitment chat and they wanted to come live in our wormhole and mine for us and build shit for us. Like they willingly wanted to become our slaves, it was kind of weird.
---
Being an officer makes you question your life decisions at times, I've got so many more stories, but those are some that really stood out.
---
Go screw.  Simple farmers were invited along with the rest of Eve to BROADCAST FOR REPS. 
---
They chose to blow him up against the cease fire pact for GE- that day. 
---
SF ought to be ashamed but they probably are not. 
---
REMINDER if you or anybody else needs help in RL... BROADCAST FOR REPS.
---
Oy. You gota liocense to be baitin in ma subreddit?
---
Horde standing fleet is my life, always content coming through.
---
@work, but I can drop by a discord. 
---
Also a CEO is there to support the Corp and its members. Not the other way around
---
It depends on when you buy extractors/plex/mct and when you sell injectors
---
I bought tons when the galaxy sales were still a thing because prices dropped each time and try to sell whenever i need the isk. 
---
Right now you actually loose isk if you havent already bought stuff before. You get 3,4-3,6 injectors pr char. Of course you can do PI on them and make another 1b per account but extracting is already boring as fuck
---
Margins are super tight because most farmers have 200+ accounts and only buy stuff they need when prices are low and sell when they are high, you kinda need a huge ammount of capital to do this.
---
Also, china is coming so now is a good time to invest
---
There's a lot of people on this sub that don't play.
---
the brass on this dude
---
you still lose isk you idiot lol 
---
you are the sp farmer equivalent of the "minerals i mine are free"
---
caps are the new cruisers. Well.. To us in delve at least lol.. :)
---
Toon?
---
I hear we are all aSpecialPinecone's pets or he is ours not sure anymore.
---
3 or 4 a month?
---
Lived out there for most of the time i played eve. I miss how stable the internet is there :(
---
I knew a couple dudes that played out there
---
Is this being live-streamed anywhere or just VODs?
---
Why go to the point of fighting. If someone is acting like that why not just say sorry, try another corp, and then just ignore them?
---
*settings
---
Never intended not to
---
&gt;Remember forgetting what you learned if you forgot to upgrade your clone? Hahaha. I lost JDC 5,  2 times on one alt lol.
---
loosing JDC 5 made me cry the first time, and punch my computer the second time hahaha
---
The Right Order and Inferno are active on FI.RE ops and Legacy have even formed a full subcap fleet to defend non-frat aligned entities (blood covenant or unthinkables fort iirc) in this space against skillu though Legacy haven’t set any of the above blue (which is irrelevant when you form 150 eagles to defend them).
---
This particular “fight” included legacy bridging out of scalding pass on a “neutral” titan.
---
Also in amongst all this is my other laboratory is a distillery which has to be up there in best alliance names in the game.
---
How dare you ask for in game information about me!
---
Amen brother.
---
The only time i injected is when a friend quit the game and i said "can i have your stuff" and he said yes and extracted all of his skillpoints and gave them to me, as well as all his stuff.
---
Yeah, due to people like that, during interviews I'm really clear with people. "You're going to lose ships with us, don't care about killboard stats."
---
Some people are kind of intense about losing their ships.
---
I hiked my Corp ratting taxes to 21% and that took care of it real quick, lol. 
---
I had several people eve mail me like 10 hours later talking bullshit about how they want to find "the spark" in eve and that they wanted to "taste the open skies" etc.etc. and for those reasons they were leaving my Corp.
---
I called them out on their bullshit and warned the HR of the corps they wanted to leave for.
---
Yeap.. Gotta love these guys
---
It's not worth fighting, tell them they have a week to move their shit out, then bye bye.
---
Thank you!
---
I get annoyed when I take the time to talk them up to the point of joining and then they disappear or just never finish applying. Such a downer
---
Yeah landing a scram on a ceptor is always a great feeling
---
The hardest way possible... high sec mining
---
Was thinking wether to upload our fight or not but its techically not a solo fight :P
---
It was a good one though
---
He's baiting you hard my friend.
---
Krabbing is soul crushing, I feel you man.
---
I am talking about the coalition map
---
RIP. The man must be a master baiter
---
Just VODs, the matches have already been played, but due to issues relating to Thunderdome we were unable to live stream them as originally planned.
---
He’s not actually the CEO though
---
Annual?! 
---
Weekly, you mean?
---
Keep in mind that if your sub dropped for even just that single day you didn't get the sp for the borked chat.
---
Imagine you being so bad at pvp you could only do it in hissc
---
I remember when I checked at one point before i quit and they were worth a fully fit super if you sold to jita buy price.
---
My character hopefully still has it, the buddy i gave my char to said he's never removing the monocle
---
Aww that's unfortunate. Are there plans for future matches being streamed and where? Awesome content btw, just one suggestion would be to make the teams colors in the HUD display at the bottom more clear, like making the pink box their team color or something.
---
Those people that feel the need to randomly mail you ingame in order to introduce themselves and then fail to follow directions and they apply ingame.  
---
Those that see a recruitment team member or officer or director and IMMEDIATELY starts sucking up to them.  
---
Those that constantly want to ask questions in private. 99.9% of all recruit questions are better asked in public chat, that way everyone else can get that piece of information as well.
---
Those that think they are a special case.  You are not.  We are very welcoming, but your application is no more important that the next one on the list, or the previous one.
---
Not posting on your main.  "I want to join, but I don't want you to know who I am while here in chat.  I'm worried that my corp may kick me if they knew I was here."  Then I'm not going to talk to you.  Post on your main or GTFO.
---
Is this on the test server only?
---
Fair enough. So you need to be a CSM, the ban/removal of whose also needs a devblog entry.

---
Wow just write a python script #DumbingDownTheGame #AdaptOrDie #GitGud
---
Freeports suck. Gets people killed. That is all.
---
I don't care about kill marks or my kilboaed colours because I engage everyone even if Im going to lose
---
You can't have then both logged on at the same time on the same machine, but you can log on different machines at the same time,  i log on my omega account on my game PC, and the alpha account on my laptop, fleet up and do stuff sometimes.
---
3,8 extractors, 1.944m sp every 30days
---
Who's idea was it to call us NU pure blind?  And you're missing people for it btw.
---
tough ship to fight as it's an assault frigate
---
I kiss girls like your mom.
---
Or the applicants that say they will do this and that, but then only end up being pingwarrior krabs.
---
to add the beacon to your overview you right click it &gt; add to overview
---
Like literally just going AFK?
---
What is a commissar in test?
---
Anyone making serious isk on the industrial or market side of things isn't going to reply, and that's where you can leverage a fuckload of isk
---
It's a new one, for this event.
---
You know that, even before this, there are 4 different monocles, right? 
---
Grey and Gold, Left and Right.
---
(and the one from this event isn't one of those)
---
So cinematic and peaceful. Unlike those other videos with the angry sounding FC who has a gravelly voice.
---
I don't know why these multiboxing guise are so defensive about their trade. It's almost like they are ashamed of being able to control multiple characters at once. That shit can be hard! Why claim to be something it's not? I don't get it
---
thank you for your tax revenue
---
Don't you guys have standings with init and sov adjacent to their space?
---
Nice try ~~ccp~~ Pearl Abyss shill.
---
ikr? I would love to have those 2 tshirts.
---
C5 escalations in capitals. 
---
Easy money. Worst case scenario I’m someone else’s content. 🤷‍♂️
---
Ooo 1m skillpoints. Gotta finish those vni pilots you know. 😉
---
She must get a good deal. Cause You’re uglyy.
---
People are using stupidly overpriced ships/fittings for WH relic/data.
---
For those "fake" relic/data (real combat sites) you better just use T3C since their hacking minigame difficulty are generally super easy.
---
For those "real" relic/data (C1\~C3 pirate site) you would want covert-op for best hacking ability or just a heron for a hell lota mid slot to prevent ganking and maxing out exploring efficiency.
---
A fully fitted heron with a prototype cloak and tech 2 relic/data analyzer is no more than 5 mils cost and just doing one site pays for itself.
---
Side note: since capsuleers are so coward in 2019, a prototype cloak is insanely useful in mind game. I was sitting in a safe spot scanning down 20 sites in a system to see a tengu come and go, a stratios come and go, an astero come and go, all without scanning down all sites. Tengu did try combat probe and ofc epic fail and retreated. They just get deterred for seeing those core probe I flying in space while not able to identify the ship using them.
---
People who contact your corp promising "a great deal" or "an offer you can't refuse" when they just want industrial people to mine their shit.
---
Exaggerating a bit on it being a fight, just a guy asking over and over again why he was being denied entry to corp while screaming his virtues in chat of everything he could do for us. And how those things should exempt him from having to defend our space. He just couldn't accept that being unwilling to defend the space was a deal breaker. 
---
And I unfortunately didn't have rights to kick people from the pub channel (which has been fixed as of today :))
---
This is why your not welcome back in Volt!
---
Can we forget about market implications, user metrics, and other stupid shit for one day? Can we take one day to ground our autism and angst, regain some perspective, and remember that EVE is just a game? When all is said and done there is only one thing that matters and only one thing we keep: friendship.
---
So, like any other birthday, let us take a moment to romanticize our hobby: celebrate, reminisce, and enjoy the company of others.
---
Thanks CCP &amp; Happy Birthday New Eden!
---
Easy to think that if you're not one of those new players looking at a multiple year long skill queue to be able to fly all the same ships as your friends or corp.
---
Srsly? They're giving away the monocle? :(
---
Sounds fun tbh. Or they could just expand wormhole system indefinitaly, maybe even allow ansiblexes in some of them.  A deep wormhole empire or two could be fun.
---
Not in this case. He couldn't even ping properly and get the dreads tackled
---
The tax rate is imperfect, it only handles grumpy ratterbois. The true spodbrains proudly proclaim their ability to mine through CTA 100% tax periods, and they are perfectly quiet when it's time for HD. The best way to drive them away is to hire a cloaky camper (or put one of your out-of-corp alts in system, that works too).
---
There is this guy greifing me when I come to clean up missions. I drop an MTU to assist, and he will come to me and blow it up. Won't take anything though.
---
My question is, if I use a remote armor repairer on the MTU will it flag me for him to attack me?
---
Yeah i got into TnT and got kicked in the span of 2 days cause to them i was sketchy and was flagged as a spy. So. Yeah about corps having assholes, that is actually true. If i were you to really progress. Go join some big block newbro recruitment nullsec program. Go join horde for example. Cause the joy in eve is being a part of something greater. Want to be in big fights that you will tell your grand children in the future? Go join horde. Want to be in a big fight that might be featured in a game magazine or in a news channel or something. Join horde. Horde offers a variety of stuff like regular mining ops that can get you a value of 800m-1b isk in about 2 days. If you're playing 3-4 hours per day and in a mining barge. And also a good newbean/newbro onboarding program so you'll get the ins and outs of nullsec, iskwise and pvpwise. Join horde now. And avoid all those silly paranoid stuff people from other big block alliances have that give you stress when you first play the game. Just enjoy the game with us. 
---
Ps: i'd avoid the imperium if i were you. They hurt newbros with getting into corp pay 2b scams and esi checks harrassment. So best bet. JOIN HORDE NOW. Public channel: Join Horde.
---
New Abyssal site, can be entered by 1 frigate 2 barges.
---
Mining keeps the walls from closing in on you.
---
Every 15s that there is not an active laser on a node in a quadrant of the room, that boundary closes in by 1km. Enemy barges exist, and are helping to keep the walls at bay -- but they *also* steal the minerals *you* could have mined.
---
There's no explicit time limit, but if the walls close in on you you're dead. And there's a fixed amount of minerals in the arena.
---
Idk something about hearing ‘theorycrafting’ makes me want to switch off... forever.
---
Nicely done as always, appreciate y'alls work
---
bee man bad
---
I facilitate the acquisition of necessary ships and items for a modest fee.
---
PI and Ratting. Also some marketing stuff😁
---
Goons keep trying to recruit him, but he thinks it should be the recruiters that do all of the work for him. All he wants is a simple invite to corp. This guy can really rant some nonsense.
---
Yes, he's dealing with a few learning disabilities.   
---
Hopefully, it's not his disability checks that he's spending.
---
Because CCP wants to reward Goons for having complete and uncounterable control over the entire O.R.E LP system by holding Delve. It's absolutely absurd that Rorq's and Excavators have to be supplied by Goons.
---
Honestly, I plex. 
---
I've tried a bit of everything, and just... I wanna pew, not rat, not mission, not indy (though I have a ton of bpo's, and do occasionally fire up a super long indy job just because "profit" and "passive income")
