So what I'm hearing is that you think we should have brought the full coalition?

---
Was hoping to inflict enough damage to not care too much about extraction tbh :D
---
No, you use filaments to open them, you usually use a cruiser to run them, but you can also run them with 3 frigs (harder IMO), there are 5 different levels of difficulty, with respective names, there are 5 different types of filaments each of which has pros and cons, like a penalty to resists and a bonus to either HP in shields or armour, or tracking and damage. Inside you can accuaier: skillbooks, crafting materials, BPC's, caches, etc. that can only be accuaierd in said sites.

TRAPPED: ☐ This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
we lost 40b... we will get over it dont you worry :D
---
The hobgoblin 1 will work fine in highsec. Yes the mining drones mine and then return to the ship. So get close to the asteroids without getting tangled up in them if you want better yield from your drones because they have to travel less. Just right click and select mine repeatedly.

I do realize that it was more about people trying to usurp the word of our CEO that caused this but maybe it will calm it down. Or should I just stay silent through this whole thing?

i think they could probably give them a mild makeover like they did with the vexor hull, but the core design is really strong

Eve has sound?

Oh wow... nc. classy as always :D

Is your style not accomplishing anything then? At least test had some interesting fights over our staging forts and even managed to win a few of them regardless of enemy supercaps

If they fix spawn distances if they do that, id be pretty happy.

Content created for like 500 dudes on both sides, as an unaffected observer I'd say everyone wins.

Possibly more fun to be had if the 200 Panfam dudes/dudettes were all in another booshing fleet comp, and you zipped around grid after each other?

Dunno yet, but it's been a long work week and I felt a good old fashioned shitpost girding in my loins :)

Shit, thought I was reading about Delve a its super umbrella again. Then realised someone had time whilst docked to write this.
---
Leave the thrasher model alone. All it needs is new textures and a bit more detail; its design is perfectly fine otherwise.
---
You already told the whole of r/eve about it. How likely is it they don‘t read this subreddit.
---
Perhaps, but if we're having to respond to attempted ganks the clock is always against us from the moment the first krabber gets tackled to form a sufficiently opposing comp.
---
We're happy to take subcap fights whenever we can, but if it's a tactic designed to hurt our bottom line we tend to need to overreact to prove the point. You'll of course see the same tactic employed anywhere there is a sufficient umbrella regardless of the holding alliance.
---
I didn't know killmarks could write comments in response of posts, colour me surprised.
---
At least, maybe even that and then some! ;)
---
As I said on the other thread, 500 dudes got some stuff to shoot at, I'd call it a win for everyone.

Having some server/client programming experience, the strides CCP do make with their limitations always amaze me cause I have that basic understanding.

Make a convenient market hub in (or near) lowsec then set your own margins.

Whenever I fly something that doesn't have a cloak, I put guns on f2 so I don't accidentally shoot something warping off

Idk what idiots think that goons couldn’t do that to us. Goons just decided to push darkness space instead of ncpl space but it all would have ended the same. 
---
Main character client hotkey in EVE-O.

But did the rorqual pilot successfully leave corp before the rorqual's destruction stained the alliance's kill board?
---
Goon and crew really shouldn’t get salty over super blob.

Is the game dead yet?
---
Indeed the point I was making. You don’t gain anything by exploring in a stratios, if they catch you you’re dead. May as well go with a faster, cheaper ship. 
---
I would cut off my left asscheek to get the old chimera model back. 
---
As a member of a small scale PvP group: this is exactly what our people do. 
---
Individually we have our ISK-making methods and couldn‘t care less about rorqs or supers. Would add missioning in Null, hunting Officers or Indy to the list.

Thanks to all helping hands for correcting, i think its done now :-)

I kid, but actually - could you consider breaking the Triglavian/Drifter/Seeker NPC panels into seperate "blocks" to make them easier to differentiate? Maybe just separated by a small dark bar?
---
Take the minmatar regional gate, add some ship flair and a skin to it, et voila, Angel Titan.

Lame
---
More of a we’re bored and let’s move some subs to tinker under NC. And wash away some of our hubris from being able to do exactly what we expected. Good fun still and those pucker moments are hair raising lol
---
With this Procurer's tank, yes, you should be ok to be relatively afk with 1 hobgoblin (or regional damage type drone) and 4 mining drones out.
---
Did you fabricate any evidence or are your corpmates that naive?
---
Jump fatigue is a nonfactor now. It takes considerably less time to cross the map as it did last year. Going back to zero fatigue is, however, dumb.
---
Fabricated evidence.
---
Where was the guy from last week swearing up and down I was wrong that they are either going to undeploy or batphone GSF? Seems they did both in one day.
---
Then I stand by my edit.
---
I’m so not involved, but from an outside perspective... this is a two way street. On one hand, if I’m pretty sure my opponent is gonna throw the hammer at me regardless, you better bet I’m gonna bring something that’s designed to be a bitch to catch. But the inverse is true as well. “Gudfights” are only gonna happen if Botha sides are gonna sign up for it. Otherwise both are going to try to counter the others cancer doctrines.
---
Thats exactly what is being said. Whatever the narrative maybe - most of us just want to slug it out. 
---
There really isn’t much difference between those groups within imperium, aside from being called goons like 80% of the time.
---
I blame ewar frigs having a drone taped onto the outside instead of a bay, and the requirement of a max level skill to even dabble in them.

GOTG  were the only ones fighting in subcap when there was a fleet / gang coming to their home. They didn't drop their titans on all small shits that come in. 
---
Except when there was hostiles caps on grid, supercap fleet is called.
---
I tell that about 1 year ago when I was a Slyce member.
---
A corporation doesn't need to be a whole lot. It can be just some buddies doing stuff together. However, if you're planning to make this corporation grow and succeed beyond that:
---
1. You are an industry corporation. This is your all's goal, and the reason for your existence, and your common mission. Individual members may do other things but you all do indy. Establish this as a common goal.
---
2. Be around. Especially leadership when you have important services like ore buyback running, you need to be around and active. Not only so you all can get corp things done, but also so it doesn't die off socially.
---
3. Get a secondary corp. In highsec, you all should have a holding corp for structures if you ever plan to deploy something like that. This way, if your structures get wardec'd you don't drag down the corp with it--though you all can still send pilots (or assist the corporation wholesale as an ally) in its defense if you all choose. This can be a good space for your leader to practice and figure out corp mechanics too.
---
4. Tell your CEO to pull all the corporate shares. Otherwise, a hostile director can pull them off and start a CEO vote, and take over the corporation. This is honestly the first thing anyone should do when making a corporation.
---
5. Find neighbors. Make friends. Do stuff with each other. Be active.
---
6. Recruit. Recruit at a pace you feel comfortable. Do a basic API check so you know what you're getting, and a basic interview so you know who. Advertise your own benefits as a corporation, and live up to those standards.
---
that is a thicc gooner
---
Blueballs and boredom. Those pilots are still people. 
---
You have a hard-on for init, I can tell.
---
They bring a small raven fleet and you chest beat about bringing 5x their numbers but when it was init/goons bitch slapping your keepstars you cried foul? :Thinking:
---
Whilst the blow poster is right that these deadspace sites arnt scanned to do, the term Deadspace is a general one for a number of PVE sites as well
---
These are "Abbysal Deadspace"
---
Hellcamps have been around for the entire existance of Eve; they just used to be done to players inside npc stations 
---
I remember certain successful gankers in Stain getting camped inside the stations south of the catch entrance pipe for days on end in 2003 and onwards, with the Stain Alliance &amp; friends campers doing shifts and everything
---
To add a note: These numbers are with Biology V (2x duration). Lower biology skill levels means less boost time, so less SP, and the gap in value is even bigger.
---
\&gt;498 dudes
---
\&gt; small fleet
---
You're right dude, I have nothing to say that could sway you.
---
They actually explain this in the description of the SW drones, or at least used to, that they have to redirect power to some sort of stability field to allow them to slow down something significantly more massive (ship vs drone) than themselves.
---
Sort of like the old flavor text that used to accompany t2 ammo back when t2 ammo used to give severe penalties for use.
---
Also if you use a Drake, insurance is a thing. Take advantage of it and your losses will be pretty much free except for the fittings.
---
All T1 subcaps.
---
It’s almost like INIT is trying to get fun fights. I don’t think anyone’s deluded enough to think PanFam would hold if Goons + pets (like tapi) moved all their supers and titans to do a full eviction. 
---
But at the same time, the state of eve makes nullsec evictions pointless exercises that involve weeks of listless bashing. 
---
If they want "upper tier" missions, they should pay. Simple as that.
---
Just like if you want higher tier mining, or higher tier PvP ships, or capitals.
---
And yes, as was stated by others, found the botter.
---
*Liiiiiiiiiiiiiimittttttttttt*
---
Je ne parle pas fromagé. 😱
---
It's possible to start a new toon while still keeping your main. I get what you mean though. I sold my original toon because I thought I was done with Eve. Now I'm grinding Abyssal sites trying to earn enough to inject back to where I was (about 50m SP). About halfway there, sitting on about 25m SP.
---
Fitting maybe?
---
Almost broke my finger upvoting this so hard!
---
Through high sec and low sec the warp engines sound
---
It looks like a Magnetar effect beacon in a beige-skybox system.
---
I made 4 Alfas, each one is specialized in something while my main was like a test or a Jack jack of all trades, after seeing the pros and cons of the weapon systems and the tanking, I started training acordinly my main, combat mostly, but I enjoyed training my Alfas up until 5 mil, I still use them depending of the small gang we form up. I would say it's nice trying every aspect (except mining, I really hope I didn't trained all those mining skills) to get an overview and not f your main if you can't afford the extractors.
---
So...you drummed up some corp drama between you and an alt. How stagnant is your space?
---
Bad bot
---
About a 2 hour drive for me. Perhaps a future one
---
Wow congrats dude, you got a spai in init! 
---
Unless your using voice changing software this sounds like bullshit. If this is legit, tell them after you got the roles and stole as much shit as possible.
---
It's 2019, do you not have a spy in Panfam?
---
Best thing to come out of last year
---
There are a combination of factors that could contribute to this. But first we need to clarify something, the items cost less than the resources for YOU.  
---
now as for the factors that could result in other industrialists having lower costs than you have.  
---
\-starting with the obvious, blueprints, if they have better researched blueprints than you do, their costs will be lower.  
---
\-location, if they are building out of a t2 rigged raitaru in low-sec, and you are using something in high-sec, their costs are going to be lower. ditto if they are operating in a system with a lower strategic index than you have, or lower facility fees.  
---
\-Supply lines, if they have suppliers who are willing to sell them ore/minerals at below jita buy, then they are sourcing their materials for less, which means they can undercut you while maintaining a profit margin.
---
\-Stockpiles, many of the items on the market may have been produced months, or even years ago for far less than their current market rate, which means even selling under their current value is still a net profit on their production costs.  
---
None of this is to say you can't still turn a profit, or that the only way to do it is to join one of the big null-blocks (although that certainly can help) but by identifying what they are doing to give themselves an edge over you, you can start doing at least some of them to get an edge over other people who are in your current position. your margins may not be as high as some of the big indy moguls, and they might still be able to undercut you. but you will be in a much better position.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for some more general advice, diversify what you build, the markets can change quickly, and something thats profitable one week can loose its margin the next. the better your blueprint library, and the wider the range of things you can build is, the better you can adapt to those market changes. also, if the markets do swing and suddenly something you where building is selling at a loss, or lower margins than you are okay with. unless you are desperate for the isk, just sit on it, the market will swing back eventually (and thats how those stockpiles get built)  
---
create packages. Ships very often sell at a loss, because EVERYONE wants to build ships, and they are relatively easy to build. many ships will end up selling at a loss even if you have a strong industrial support behind you, but ship modules often have quite good margins on them, if you are selling everything you need to fit out a ship, you may loose a little isk on the hull itself, but make back considerably more when they also buy the guns, the tank and their ammo from you as well. (also ties back into that point about diversifying what you build.)
---
If you can find out the kinds of fits people in your area tend to fly (either by asking them, or by looking up names you see frequently on zkill and checking out their loss mails) you can put full fittings up on contract at a decent markup and have them sell. or you can find some of the more popular gank fits etc and put those up (does particularly well in ganking hotspots like niarja etc, although getting the ships/fits into system can be risky, I suggest using a courier contract)  
---

---
Yeah fuck off with that shit
---
This was a fool-proof plan 14 months in the making.
---
uh.  Pretty sure they didn't drop supers because they were concerned about the dreadbomb response it would get.  Early in the deployment, they 100% dropped supers.
---
Its puff puff pass...
---
Not puff puff puffff pufff puff pufffff puff.

which is kinda ironic considering that eyesight is one of our strongest senses. even compared to most of the animal kingdom, sure some can see further, or spot movement better, or see more colours, but ours are pretty damn solid across the board.

When did they start seeding J5a though?
---
imagine this for c1 space c2 space  and shattered wh's
---
right now c1 drop is  between 8m ad 13m in blue loot  sleeper data./relic are garbage 
---
i did  c2  for comparing to c1 its difference in few millions not more..  
---
big bucks starts in c3 wh where some anoms pay 40-50m per site and can be done  with two passive regen ships,i did try to use praxis and  passive drake/cyclone but results werent good.  actually praxis did win but top winner was prophecy and sigil along nereus. tese three ships in pulsar whs are kings.
---
if ccp want to add drifters to low-class they must make it managable and worth shooting, it must be harder than  low-class sleeper but not stronger than high class one and low-tier DD to atleast intimidate opponent, but i see the sense. low-class after buff will be gaining more attention so moe pve'rs and more pvp'ers. only worrying about blue loot price drop after this.
---
dont forget about sansha wormholes that  have no sleepers but  sansha nullsec anoms and  ded sites.  this how sansha nation invading empire,throught wormholes.

If you train a deep neural net with the data you get from all TEST posts this is the post it will make.

That sounds like worse cancer than fucking whaling with boosh ravens.

That’s some fucking magical thinking.

I know its been said, but i'm gonna beat the horse just a little bit more.  
---
Join a corp. seriously the game is so much better with other people.  
---
and since you reached out to reddit specifically, I feel I need to do the obligatory: Dreddit is recruiting.
---
lol yikes 
---
yea cuz totally no one else helped them 
---
my heart, it hurts... ffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccckkkkk
---
Shit, I thought whaling with ravens was dumb but you just reclassified everything.
---
Just like any other search engine, there's certain ways to search to get more accurate results.
---
Lol
---
I think it would be pretty simple, Add him to C2-C4. Copy paste the high class drifter and halve his EHP. Make his dps/neut the same as a hard C4 site and have him drop 100m in blue loot.
---
While I understand the fact that botting is an issue, I legitimately enjoy doing missions every once in a while. Personally, I prefer to be solo most of the time due to time constraints and/or being in a bad mood and not wanting to negatively affect Corp mates (when I'm in a Corp) this change makes me less likely to log in when I'm in a solo mood and not subscribed.
---
My point is that there are people who mission for fun. I don't do it for the isk. I do it to be able to enjoy ship explosions in a calm, relatively controlled environment. I'm sure others do as well.
---
Hard to work out what your point is.
---
Init + allies = 65% of the entire playerbase.

Iteron Mark VI: It's Actually Just 27 Typhoons Glued End to End Edition

---
Hi Az! 
---
I really don't understand where these types of comments are coming from. When was it ever said anyone was surprised this was happening? Of any of the big groups in this game the Imperium has been the one to most often fight under the enemy super umbrella.
---
Great thanks Potter! I just joined my first Nulsec corp and even though they are mostly russian and I only speak english lol, they seem helpful and il go try these sites! Thanks mate :)

---
I expect to see an announcement that a lowsec gate will be added to Eve on some future patch Tuesday.
---
Followed by an announcement of Tranquillity going offline permanently on Monday.
---
So basically you want ccp to force people who don't want to fight you, to fight you.
---
This is a sandbox game. If you want instanced pvp there are a lot of games out there for you.
---
I'm gonna do just that :P thx!

I'm just having trouble keeping up with the spin narratives about what we're doing.

Lol can't tell if baiting or actually stupid enough to think (pretend?) all of the north wasn't there to defend.

i think its already down, i get "page not found

the page you requested does not exist" when i go to its user page

Hmmm I made 30bil in the time it took to read this post. Guess the north is down to their last pennies, when this makes reddit news.
---
Hahahahaha what?
---
Haven't played in a while, what ship is that it looks badass. Love the game, but don't have the time or the computer for it.
---
Gotta consider the fact that they'll only work against a heavily webbed target, which either means you're in scram/web range and already locked or you're blobbing someone.

Nah, it's just too angled and chunky. Even if it were rusty it'd feel too thickset.

Exchange "Omega Status" for "sub" then, I don't care. I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume they are still running a business that pays dividends in something other than bubblegum and good will toward newbies. It's still in their best business interest to offer less to alphas and more incentive to upgrade whether you or anybody likes it or not. 
---
You count your shekels dude. I get paid by the word.

What app did you make this with?

I think that would kill you because this man's clearly already having a stroke

Tfw NC. shit talks someone for respecting their members by extracting and srping, instead of what they did when they had a full mach fleet on a move op caught in 9koe and forced their members to stay logged off for two days because of killboards.
---
You sure it's not just a Trex smashing it's head on a keyboard since it's tiny arms can't reach down to it?
---
To be fair to them, the response to tackled rorqual by everyone in the game, including everyone on 'our' side is an overwhelming super escalation.
---
you dont get  reimbursed for desync's
---
Ccp seems to want it that way. :(
---
Since nobody is being serious, iirc this was originally a project underaken by ex CCP Pointybits (who’s last project was the Osprey. They ended up shelving it after some informal polling because the Thrasher design is too iconic, and their testing models didn’t achieve the look they wanted. The redesign was scrapped afaik
---
Would you expect anything else from nc? These are the same dudes that force their members to dock for fear of looking bad on the killboard. No wonder their corps keep bailing to the south where they can use what they worked for.
---
This is really awesome!! Thank you! This will help out tons of people as a nice quick reference sheet! I’ve setup a sort of in game channel, “Abyssal Lurkers” to accumulate information/people/fits in one spot for anyone interested in fits, I’m going to drop a link to this in there because this is perfect.

I watched one die in Clear Skies 3. :(
---
I was wondering when I was going to see a fellow CVA
---
Oh now this takes me back to the days of having the mission running stuff pasted in your bio.
---
Yup, and this also means that these people that rely on supers/rorqs get hurt MORE when they lose shit now, since it takes more time to replace.
---
this is healthy for smaller groups
---
bless
---
So what skills are required to run this kind of content at a comfortable minimum?
---
This is what they took from us ;_;
---
If you ever wanna come back I'll be your flying buddy. That was beautiful.
---
Eve related how?
---
Your choices are either to fly FOTM, or hope you run into idiots dumb enough to hit approach on your scram web torp battleship. 
---
We've already been over this, Papa Bliss is generously selling us bombers from his bomber bpos at only 20% above jita in hakonen.
---
/r/starcitizen_refunds
---
lol how did you end up in a russian corp?
---
You take that back. I had nothing to do with....no wait you're right. Move along.
---
I'm not sure , I ended up a long way from home, 60 jumps or something and came home after a self destruct ( lost in wormhole because logged out and lost my probes  ) and somehow was invited to a russian corp, said yes and they keep sending me good ship fits so  Good times.haha
---
nothing is worse than that
---
That was a wyvern. 
---
5...4...3...2..and there it is
---
Well, surprisingly I was able to put a rather nice fit on Rattlesnake for 1bil total.  I was quite disappointed that Alpha clone can't use Large Micro Jump Drive, but I will just have to fly with Afterburner for now.  Left Jita without trouble, in heavily tanked travel fit.  At least now I can have a little fun for free every once in a while.
---
&gt;a small raven fleet and you chest beat about bringing 5x their numbers
---
obviously never seen a goon fleet. they don't undock for less than 8x
---
Make Lasers Great Again

oink oink

Fair enough.
---
The Cassandra Drifter Cruiser could work.
---
Keep dreaming mate
---
Just goes to show how much I know about capitals. :D
---
Oink oink
---
It's not really in the end and CCP knows it. You can't blame them for going slow about it though.
---
You obviously have no idea how f2p works.
---
Keep dreaming about this change doing anything to the botting problem in this game
---
Love these vids. You got so much logi that you can just fly right into a pack of heavy assault cruisers!
---
2 thing : Why are you mad people make good ad for your alliance to the LGBT community ? And yes the website is pretty well made and that lead to my second thing, I'm not sure a random salty lowsec troll made that much effort, isn't a random line member who decide to help your alliance without telling ? I don't know, the website look so well made..
---
&gt;You got so much logi that you can just fly right into a pack of heavy assault cruisers!
---
We had 1 logi loki)
---
Stupid question, but I guess if this was made then people are still doing them.. but are Abyssals worth doing? Any video I've ever seen had someone either getting nothing really worth great of value or having to book it out at the last second. Never seen anyone loot something and say "Fuck yea, there's something good."
---
Other PVE content is no different in that regard once you figure it out.The difference here though is that we're talking low effort/low risk PVE income for alphas. Not many alternatives for them who prefer this style of gameplay. 
---
We're honestly not mad, just concerned that whoever it is views being a member of the LBGT community as a bad thing.  We have plenty of members who are part of that community.  We honestly do hope it brings some people in, we just want them to know that it's not us behind this website and if they don't contact us, they might be talking to an imposter.  It is also a wordpress template tbh- so they just might be salty with taste? lol
---
THOT so 😍
---
It's low treshold/low risk/ low efford PVE income for alphas. Which is why taking this away from them is a risk.
---
If somebody is impersonation you in game just petition it. Its on the "Nope cant do that list" from CCP.
---
I used to keep in touch with a lot of the top-tier solo PvP'ers in Eve. Most of the guys I knew don't upload anymore, seeing their eve accounts they're as inactive as I am, over a year without a kill... I have randomly come back and forth to r/eve to see if anyones been publishing good solo/ small gang content, and all I can see is Loussy Lou still being a boss... But all the guys I grew up playing with have quit. And today I've learned my eve accounts are 10 years old.  
---
Other than just harassing and hunting for the thrill of it (And trust me, killing most stuff these days isn't as thrilling. My time in Triumvirate tought me how OP super ratting and rorq mining was. All subcap PvP is fucking chump change at this point.) you can't have meaningful small gang pvp anymore. Even with stations you could harass, sit in sniper tornado's and hellcamp a system. Now? Nah, they'll just sit under the safety net of the Astrahaus and talk shit. Most of my last solo roams involved people dropping carriers on vexors.  
---
Also in Triumvirate I noticed something rather significant. Capital and super proliferation has become as bad as all of us bittervets imagined it would. For supers, alliances used to be limited to how many alt characters they could afford to pay for, because titans and nyx's could not be docked. It was a rare fucking sight to see a super, let alone a fleet of carriers. Keepstars were invented and now... Boy have the prices dropped. Titans used to be 200b+ a piece just for the hull, now around 50-60b. I bought my hel fully fit for 18b, and I think just bs ratting after work for 2/3 hours a day I made 1b a day. Faction dread and titans would multiply that, i tended to get 1 a day, sometimes dropping blueprints for 5b mods. I honestly think I made my money back within a week.  
---
The capital balance brought a lot of things to the game. Capitals weren't very good before hand, but I think the balance was way to heavy handed. They are fucking monsters now, and when I ran in two full fleets of carriers, nothing subcap could even touch us.   
---
I suppose I need to close this rant soon... The gap between ship classes is too massive at this point. From frigate &gt; destroyer &gt; cruiser &gt; battlecruiser &gt; battleship, the ship classes only got better about 2/3x in EHP. A fleet fit battleship generally had about 300k EHP, as a fleet fit BC would have about 100k EHP. So a 3x different. A carrier on the other hand comes out with about 3m EHP fleet fit, which makes the gap between Battleship to carrier a 10x improvement.
---
or just pay Pandemic Horde to hold your structures safely for you.
---
Whatever you claim mate, I can't verify your expertise on then matter anyway
---
In the process of it- we saw the reddit posts and just wanted to make sure people knew who to contact officially if needed.  Thanks!
---
nah, GIVE ME BACK MY GOLDFISH
---
Can you leave jump clones in J space?
---
Also, just adding... DPS range of a battlecruiser was within the range of 500 - 700. A battleship was between 800 - 1100 (Disreguarding arty machs, which is the only fleet that was worth a fuck before I quit.) Carrier DPS is easily 3k in fleet. So as the others only showed 20% or 40% improvements, carriers showed a 300% improvement.
---
I noticed Darkness contributed nearly 1,000 subcaps to the anti-goon movement in Casino War / World War Bee / Whatever Sexual Identity You Want To Call It. From this I derived a hypothesis that if we burned down all the *potential* allies (i.e. GOTG) around NC / PL we would have a reasonable shot at coming out ahead further down the road were we to ever challenge that throne.
---
It's easy for people to forget what GOTG was prior to the most recent Northern Offensive, but then again I expect nothing less from anyone who doesn't play the game of chess at our levels.
---
Interesting answer, so I'll take my conspiracy troll hat off for a moment and post a serious response.
---
What are those factors, primarily ones that don't apply to your line members? What are the reasons people rent *space* (not moons, which plenty of Goons rent outside Delve) in EVE Online in year 2019? It's not hard to get into GSF, even with an alt. And to my eyes, PBLRD is currently nothing more than a refuge for ex-RA krabs.
---
Maybe it's my PvP oriented mentality, but I genuinely don't understand^† the appeal. Is it the independence? Not being told what to do? Running your own corp? Are they really that lazy that they can't commit to join a fleet with a Vigil 3 times a month? Is it being able to have your main elsewhere? I don't get it. I know Mittens hates the comparison of GSF to a feudal system, but aren't some of your corps (notably the non-english speaking ones) already behaving and being treated kinda like renters? 
---
I'm going to use my own corp as an example and you have to understand that this is my personal experience, I'm not sure how much of this is true for other people, other corps, and specifically other cultures. It's a non-English speaking corp in GSF. One that actively discourages its members from sticking their neck out and socialising outside the corporation, because most of them, including the directorship, don't speak enough English to understand the culture. You won't see them on Jabber. You won't hear them on Mumble, as they use their own voice chat, even during fleets (no, it's not a relay channel.) They tell people to stay out of Theta unless someone gets tackled and they can't handle it themselves. (If they don't speak any English at all, common thinking is "I should just die quietly," even though Theta regularly saves people who also don't.) And you won't see them on the forums. I tried posting on the forums, but I ended up being summoned on voice chat, to be told off by my director for making a gay bait-and-switch thread in helldump, because it "didn't reflect well on our corp" (he didn't care about it being a joke, only how MY shitty post reflected on his ego).
---
There was never any effort to integrate into the alliance. They were no different from renters, and some possibly even saw themselves as such. They didn't tolerate outsiders mining in their home system. Voice chat was filled with racist epithets aimed at other foreigners living in our system. We had our own standing fleet and if an outsider got attacked, while some people did help, you'd also hear things along the lines of "i'm staying near my rock. let him die, fuck that &lt;nationality/ethnic slur&gt; &lt;retard/leach/bot/cherrypicker/whatever&gt;." If another (often smaller) corp moved into our system, there would be no attempts to co-operate or communicate, instead there would be griefing and passive aggression. Anything they could get away with to get them to move out. Even other corps who spoke our language were openly hostile to both us, and each other.
---
I invited, almost begged them to come hang out with my Goon friends, whenever we were doing something cool, I shared killmails and videos, but they just weren't interested. Same thing with SIGs and squads. Not unless we could all huddle up in our private voice channel. And I'm not even talking about people who were only interested in mining.
---
It all led to a point where I just couldn't stand it anymore. I liked PvP and I liked being part of Goons. ([sorry, Kendarr](https://my.mixtape.moe/malaty.mp3) I didn't care about the corp anymore. So I stopped getting on their voice chat and I deployed all my characters with a SIG outside Delve, after that they only ever saw my name on top of zkill and monthly pap statistics. Still, I didn't want to be associated with them anymore, and the fact that they could get away with this, that this was tolerated, left a bitter taste in my mouth. So after a few months I went fuck goons, then quit the game altogether shortly after. My fault for joining a non-English corp, I guess.
---
My corp wasn't even that bad, 2-3 of the other corps who shared our language openly admitted to hating Goons and everything they stood for, mocking us for staying in the Imperium after the Casino War while they were off doing their own thing. Why would I put in my time and effort to create a safe space for people like that? If there is anyone who belongs in Period Basis, it's parasites like them^‡. I sometimes wish hunters would learn to target these people specifically, because they make such easy pickings. Fuck them.
---
This went wildly off-topic, but it's part of the reason why I don't get it. Why the fuck do people still rent? Why not just join GSF^¶?  I really do admire what you've done in Delve and respect the work put into it to keep it safe, but I consider region saturation comically broken. An alliance your size shouldn't be able to turtle up within the range of a single super jump. It's why Delve is the best place to krab. Period. Today's patch doesn't change that, but it's very clear, with the actual details of what they're doing being secret, that CCP is experimenting and collecting data from small changes to extrapolate and try to determine how they could rebalance anomaly spawns in a future patch^§. They even say something to that effect in their latest video. If buying Period Basis isn't insurance in case Delve ends up being nerfed, then what is it?
---
^(† Botting is the obvious one that stands out, but for the sake of the argument, let's ignore it.)
---
^(‡ If you don't know they exist, it's because they don't speak your language and don't hang out in your Jabber channels.)
---
^(§ I guess when they were talking about balance, they didn't mean "the flavour-of-the-week thing to complain about on Reddit". Shucks.)
---
^(¶ or Brave? or Test? or if you're really desperate, Horde? Actually, no. If Horde's your only option, you should be renting.)
---
^(✡ I considered PMing this, but a PM with footnotes looked too freaking silly.)
---
^(‖ This post is not me complaining about people who don't speak English being part of the alliance, that's fine. I speak 3 languages and enjoy learning about other people's cultures, especially internet cultures. Where it gets somewhat ridiculous, is when you can have multiple corps that all speak the same language, within the same alliance, making no attempts to co-operate/integrate, even with each other, and mocking those who do it. Maybe you should at least know where the word "Goon" came from. Most of my old corpmates didn't. In their defense, the culture is a lot less penetrable for people who are bad at English. When you haze somebody, make sure they actually get the hint to stop making themselves look like a doofus. Or maybe country/language-based corps are just cancer, I'm rambling too much and I should go to bed.)
---
Travelling is really not an issue, pathfinder helps a lot, the only problem would be if you have a lot of stuff to move, but Thera connections and WH jumps can make 60j like 10 or even less.
---
That’s about as much logi as my entire coalition gets when they ping for a fleet.
---
tbh from an outside person, that website look something legit, so for someone like me, a random person from the LGBT+ community, that's a pretty good ad to your alliance. I don't think you should have bring that to reddit as long as no harm would have been done, it's not like they use your name to scam people around right ? And yeah, if they are troll, they are very very dedicated and you pissed them pretty hard xD
---
GOTG is better about it, but FAR from perfect.
---
It still takes several hours and potentially days of planning, so no...
---
I am cool with this

Yeah- we’re super impressed at the level the website was made at. We just want people to know in case they do bring it to that level as well as they did put forth a lot of effort in this.
---
Yep, /u/knirgh has it right with the resource. CIG will be absolute knobs about the whole thing; the CS rep will get *very* passive-aggressive with you issuing a dire warning about never being able to sign up for their ~~investment scam~~ ~~tech demo~~ game ever again, and they'll try to get you to give up. Just be persistent and you'll be out free with your money back.
---
It's ded when it comes to making money.
---
Hey thanks for the advice, I'm up near Jita actually, the mining sounds appealing, I had my two accounts set up to mine and have an orca to store. Would like to get into PvP too at some point. Is Horde recruiting?
---
How many time you'll repeat that 1 year old fact?
---
Is EVE going to die or what is happening? Im completely out of touch with the situation. 
---
Provided that you have an active clonebay, then yes. But you wont be able to 'jump' to them per say, but you can swap into them within the same citadel to change out which implant set you have plugged in.
---
Congratulations on the longest Eve Reddit topic title ever
---
Wait, I've been out of the game for a while now, are there Eve "Dungeons" now?
---
I once saw about 35 of them in deklein some years ago, for about 15 seconds. 
---
Why won’t you be able to jump?
---
&gt;choose not to engage
---
Is that not what you're doing by commenting over and over in response to him?
---
Do citadel defenses fire automatically in lowsec/nullsec/wormholes? Or do they need to be manually used?
---
I want to poke around and try shooting some structures but don't know what to expect and don't want to be instantly blapped.
---
Pretty sure that was more of a grr CSM jerk since the implication was that leaks from CSM are tipping off alliances to make moves early
---
Lorewise? Because w-space is 'unreachable' so the clone company can't beam your consciousness to a location inside of it. (Although somehow your consciousness can be beamed out when you get podkilled.)
---
Practically? It's one of the mechanics that makes w-space unique. Being able to force pilots back to k-space leads to some very interesting gameplay to maintain "hole control" during big fights and evictions.
---
Unrelated: Are you building your own wiki or do you play EVE too?
---
400gbe is less than two years old and I'm not certain anyone is using it outside of backbone datacenter switches. Even 100gbe outside of backbone switches is *rare*. 40gbe is just as old as 100, and honestly CCP moves rather slowly when migrating tech. They're not notoriously profitable, and bleeding edge server hardware is fucking expensive, but maybe that's where they blew all the venture capital money.
---
Also, the tech upgrade they had slated to finish in 2016 lists 2x10gbe NICs as the interfaces on their compute nodes, with 16gbe switches; https://www.eveonline.com/article/tranquility-tech-3
---
I work in the software industry, and most of the recent big jumps in networking hardware are priced to target weird people with specific applications (Google, TelCos) or cloud providers so they can sell more compute time per unit physical space in their datacenters, I doubt CCP is the target customer for the fancy stuff.
---
A player needs to assume control for the defenses to be active.
---
They ran out of duct tape
---
25bil killed and your chest beating about it. Whatever floats the boat I suppose
---
They're a little addicting tbh.
---
While I loved the design its just not a thrasher!
---
 My own redesign fear is for CCP making the Atron symmetrical :(
---
Don't have the numbers where lowsec roaming makes sense, in the way that you will outnumber random dudes doing a plex and lose to the gate camps, as for groups that like good fights in their home that sounds like a unicorn hunt.

That's exactly right, "space bushido" doesn't exist but both sides like to the cry anytime the other side doesn't line up and die without complaint.

Yes, Abyssal Filaments, buy them from the market in jita.

They were getting pissed on when they were using their supers, that's why they stopped.

In the what mutaplasmid will drop depends on the filament type used section, I cant read the yellow type, might want to change that.

Teach us.   How do you fit your whiptails? 
---
If you think about it, all this started with their evaluation of war-decs on new player retention, the findings of which showed that very new players whose corps were war decced quit and never came back. Now that they've made these changes, they probably went through and automatically sent this email to the people who did quit shortly after being wardecced. Of course as always there's going to be a few false positives.   
---
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this, if anything it should help bring some players back who go turned off of the game too quickly by the old system, but might still be Eve material given time. 
---
This is some funny shit
---
Lol what do you expect from a bunch of fags who drop 20 carriers on a t1 frigate?! But yea report them and get their leaders perma banned
---
&gt;Year training for nano, nerfed
---
Yup totally. Ccp doesnt need to nerf nano because it's totally underpowered 
---
&gt;crabbing in them doesn't work out longterm
---
Using krabing leshaks(crab shacks) for c5s holes is insanely good 
---
On one hand, doesn't really look Minmatar... On the other, I'm pretty sure this would be the most detailed hull ever released, especially considering it's small size. 
---
Never smoke ranarrs are you end up posting like this 
---
Where you produce items before sale is probably more important than what you produce at times. For example: Manufacturing a sweet sweet Battlecruiser sounds awesome. You look at materials: All time low! Cool! You look at the blueprint: Excellent material efficiency on that. Sweet! Then you look at production cost: 3 million- because you are crafting in Jita. It's viable, but it absolutely mangles your profit potential and opportunities. Consider trading part time, crafting part time, and setting up buy orders for ore at a distant station and reprocessing it, crafting the items there, then paying some schmuck to risk his neck hauling it to Jita for you with 110% on the collateral of expected sales. If he gets blapped: Not your problem.
---
Yes because there are words.
---
I was trying to rat with the keepstars on diamond rats.
---
can I eject from my miner and fly back to station to get my hauler and have them both in space at the same time?
---
We're not with the north you idiot
---
well the rorqual died so who really lost
---
why no abyssal mods 
---
with the best mods possible usually, which would be abyssal ? 
---
OK lmao

2019
---
jamiewow not understanding the awesomeballs of generating 400 lossmails
---
Submit a support ticket and a GM will investigate this for you. From my understanding the corporate assets should be in impound at this point. There will be a solution.
---
Yes, but if anyone sees your empty miner they can just board it and steal your stuff. 
---
What you can do if you manage to get both of them to the same area safely is always keep the ship you aren’t in locked, because you cannot board a locked ship unless it’s yours. So you would be able to use your hauler to store all the ore while mining. 
---
However, I think a mobile depot would be a better option for you, if those have enough m3. I’m not on my computer to check.
---
Also, if you’re hisec mining, be aware that’s probably the lowest income occupation in the game. A good option for newer players is exploration, join the “Eve scout” channel in game, which is Signal Cartel’s public channel. If you join them they’ll set you up with some ships and advice.
---
nah my friend found ore in his mission so i'm going to mine plagioclase there. since it's a mission there is not much risk of stuff being stolen
---
Yeah right obviously everyone not blue to you is united against you ya cracked the code

The hero we need.

But caps are fine.

I fly more and have flown more than torp battleships. I flew arty canes (t1 and fleet) before BC buffs (and helped in giving the fleet cane a tracking bonus), drakes, harbs, kite pests and right now small gang arty pest, napoc, kite torp barg and zealot.
---
Ive flown nearly every subcap in pvp. Except a few t1 frigs, gila, RLML Orthrus (flew HAM), nomen and other FOTM ships.
---
Ive never experieced a nerf and i still kill plenty of people without alts and with more than torp battleships. That may be your only familiarity with me is my more popular torp videos, but ive been around nearly every weapon system and ship on the subcap side. Non-FOTM ships are still plenty viable if youre creative enough and a decent pilot.  
---
Got torpedo spec to V right before they were made useless by cruise missiles
---
Hi
---
On the drone battleships I get consistantly best results doing Em through shield then thermal through armor. Especially the T4 and T5 ones where it takes quite a while to get through their HP it shows really well and holds regardless of filament type.
---
 O i see, I don't do C5 combat sites, so would not know :( mostly stick to HS and LS for PvE, only PvE I do in WHs is when I go explo and have to deal with some rats popping or alike.
---
Jealous.
---
Just had to upvote.
---
So.... does this mean boosting ravens isn’t OP anymore? Asking for a friend.
---
apocalypse is fucking nigh!
---
I also have JDC V ^and i trained it off remap before injectors were a thing, i hate myself.
---
So that means that wormholers won't be able to use alts in known space for trading, incursions, etc?
---
I do play EVE, albeit not very well.
---
plot twist: ccp axes all their PR dudes, and outsources it to guard's new company.
---
the place i work just kinda did that - axed 2/3 of the people that worked in our building, their jobs were transferred to a third party that we are now purchasing the services of... so nothing has really changed except the guys with like 10+ years service now have 0 years service and are royally pissed off!
---
Wait a sec, working on it? That's a policy violation!

6 months is a long time. Wonder how many people know they will change jobs within this time frame? Can't say I have ever have.

No, Falcon will try and save it before it goes too far.

The nerf to rorquals and fighters is coming. :)
---
I know exactly how it works. It doesn't mean you make the whole game free. Every game out there that runs on a similar model has large parts of the upper tier gameplay behind a paywall.
---
He fuckin knew, they all knew since **abysmal** space was announced.
---
I know you think you know what you are talking about, but you sincerely don't. 
---
This is a Mitzvah and you are now a ‘Mensch’ for making this video.
---
Alts, as in other characters? Most wormholers do keep toons in Kspace perpetually for such things like market trading. 
---
If by other clones, wormholers do keep some in Kspace, they just have to find a way back in if they deathclone out of their wormhole.

Good ol' risk adverse snuff not understanding that killing 400 people is awesome regardless of isk.

Pirate faction EW Drones needed, Guristas Hornet EC-300's etc
---
Okay, so if I'm, say, exploring through non-highsec space and I find a Citadel with no gunners or people inside, I can warp in and throw a few rocks at it without my ship being blown up?  
---
If my goal is to try and get a small group of battleships together to harass structures, what's best at this? I've seen a lot of Leshaks for structure destruction, but what's a typical runner up?  
---
When you say cycle, do you mean reload? Is it a module that is warp disrupting me, or something systemic that happens just because I'm on grid with a citadel?  
---
Thank you so much for the help!

Reddit banned it. I had to manually let this one through.
---
bad bot
---
Pandemic horde can't even protect their own structures
---
yes
---
Well init cant operate without it.
---
What is the cheapest AT ship, or can someone rank them by desirability?
---
Need to train punctuation...
---
Hes leaving as he got another job offer.
---
Does the Multibody Tracking Pylon only apply to ships or does it buff drone tracking as well?
---
Want to buy your Postman.

Truth. I had to get a 3d printer to make my own.
---
I never wanted CCP Guard to leave. He is a fixture, he’s like the furniture of CCP. He’s the ‘always there’ guy.
---
His Holiness Max Singularity VI saw it coming then!

---
Damn. That's sad to hear. Hopefully he'll be able to bring a similar personality to wherever he goes. 
---
The amount of obvious shit they could be selling and making hand over fist cash on is beyond astounding, they have someone that is literally mentally impaired deciding what skins go out. Cant tell you how much plex i would have dropped on skins if half of the fucking skins released were for all ships or an entire races instead of random dumb bullshit.
---
Official merch and gear sales are not there cus they decide not to make them for some stupid fucking reason. CCP consistently does things or doesnt do things that just make a normal persons head hurt at the level of stupidity. THen they stay silent about it as if them not acknowledging it will make it not exist?
---
?????????????????????????
---
So if thats why your deployment was the shitshow it was, are you telling me that init. didnt know that horde was allied with ncpl and has a shitton of members?
---
I mean well that would only show some brain related issues to be honest.
---
The game is such that it's impossible to survive in sov null without being in a coalition. We tried, it doesn't work. When was the last successful attempt?
---
You just summed up GSF’s entire recruitment strategy
---
I can get you a vouch into Goons for 500m, although the app might need to go to space court because of your membership in an entity that doesn’t exist.
---
I'm not sure that's what "edgy" means but hey...
---
Take your facts and get out. Neither of you are wanted here.
---
Not sure if baiting or madman... o,O
---
I've had a *vexxing* week so I hope we'll get to see all you guys/gals/anthropomorphized garmurs there!
---
I'm mostly curious what Guard is moving on to. What could capture that kinetic dude's passion? 
---
don't worry those "big names" were replaced with cheap and productive chinese workers, they work 24/7 and don't ask for much...
---
No shit, we had a joking round about possible merch-stuff in corp lately. The possibilities are endless. From "Primary Anchor - The Aftershave", over all the possible Mugs and models, T-shirts and whatnots instead of that "very slim" collection of rando, half-assed stuff with that INSANE shipping-costs...
---
We have had some interesting fights too. I'm not sure even now exactly what legacy's deployment goals are, but they definitely weren't the same as ours.
---
We've done our share and more of surprise whaling across the map. It's been fun, but it gets kind of samey after a while. If all we wanted to do was that, we could have kept on doing it from J5A.
---
Use English you fuck
---
Honestly, I just want true SoE skins on everything. I dig the clean white look. 
---
The bright yellow is kind of cancer to read. also Exotic filaments drop tackle (with a lower case while all others are with upper case)
---
sweet 1900 eve time what time is that in usa
---
I've done this quite a few times. You don't get the rush of being a new player back. I personally found it more like playing Eve on hard mode but with all the knowledge I had it still wasn't that hard. Was more frustrating due to lack of SP.
---
They didn't have anything to web down their primaries. And as Farfalla_Catmobile said, they were using 100MN ABs which negated a lot of the damage because there were no webs. Had they brought 1 less cerb but a huginn or rapier instead, they may very well have gotten kills there. 
---
We did know, its actually why we chose to deploy against them. 
---
My only point was that of course battle reports are going to have losses when they can field so many more people than we can. i really dont know what you expect. 
---
I'm enjoying the content regardless. its a shame that its got some of you so wound up that youre frothing at the mouths on reddit.
---
Injectors have a part to play in it for sure however there are also a lot less skills to actually train to be semi decent in a carrier. You no longer need T2 Light, Medium, Sentry &amp; Heavy Drones or any remote repair skills. 
---
with the move to Korea expect new asian CCP members...
---
that yellow text tho....
---
I think the idea is that the impersonator is a major homophobe and thinks promoting them as LGBT supporters will hurt their recruitment.
---
You will still get ganked but that's up to yourself and self awareness! 
---
Wars different though will be better after the HQ patch just now it's a nightmare trying to find hidden structures.
---
Abysal &amp; anyhing but T2 drones tbh
---
they are obssesed with doing everything from iceland 
---
iceland has no industry
---
shipping/export fees are stupendous for the little that they do produce
---
If it's "not about the isk", what's wrong with doing it with Lvl 3 missions?
---
Nope, the gripe is with caps themselves. 
---
They make up like 10% of the flyable ships in the game but dominate the other 90% in almost any situation. They're practically immune to most of the tools and tactics that subcaps can use against each other, like booshing, kiting, ewar, bombs or counter-comps. You either bring more caps or you lose, so if you can't out-escalate someone there's no point in fielding anything. And lastly they operate so much differently than subcaps logistically that you can't replace roaming or casual PVP with capitals. 
---
If you're happy with capitals now then you probably don't PVP outside of deployments or CTAs, where the alliance takes care of everything for you. All you need to do is show up and press the buttons the FC says to press. In that case sure, capital PVP is just as fun as any other PVP. For everything else it's trash.
---
remove insurance for caps
---
remove haw/supercap application to subcaps
---
i don't really give a shit where they're from, if they can get the job done.
---
It's not the same. You already know what you're doing and it's a constant pain in the ass waiting for skills to train. 
---
Basically, instead of waiting for skills to train so you can try some jank fit BS with all 200mm armor plates in the lows, you're stuck waiting for skills to train to do what you already know how to do. 
---
There are some fun bits to it though. Just don't get rid of the main or god forbid extract their sp.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Thankfully newer players can now join a corp, interact (in a fun way) with others, and take their early steps of discovery and wonder in eve without being set up as victims to those "special" players who wish to get their jollies by driving them out of the game.

There's still risk, excitement, and adventure, Just an absurd newbie trap has gone, thank heavens.

it doesnt even need a theme, id drop plex for solid fucking colors, there are so much braindead fucking easy cut paste colors, blue green red orange black white. Fuck how about camo? If the division taught me anything its that there is a fuckload of different types and colors of camo and its all fucking soooo easy art department wise and id drop fucking billions on this.

For ratting one should not use Ancillary Armor Reps, as they are pretty much useless after 8 runs. Two T2 Medium armor repairs are usually good enough if you are able to sig tank a bit of the damage, though I see now why you were struggling. 
---
Problem is a carrier is cheaper than most decent fit subcapticals. 
---
any faction and ti ships below capitals, also no ore ships beyond the venture 
---
Damn right. I dont trust links from eve nerds...

its both

3 rorqs can pull 140 ish per hour each for maybe 400-420mil/hr (i think numbers are realistically less isk wise now anyway, more like 120?)   
---
20 rorqs can pull more like 2.4-2.8B/hr  
---
20 rorqs can add another rorq in 3-4 hours mining  
---
3 rorqs can add another rorq in 20 hours mining.

Mostly those who got to that point, can scale it more when CCP nerf it, but it hurts those who don't have many.

Yeah where is the Fit?
---
INIT can outform most alliances in supers and titans.
---
Sure, you might need friends in eve, but there is no need to be friends with the by far biggest group. 
---
You get awoxed every hour? Are you certain that you're not telling others to shoot you?
---
CCP said somewhere "there are people that take the in game models and make their own out there, but we can make far more accurate high quality models"
---
Is this an official model? It's cool and all but it looks way off the mark, or is that intended?
---
ya i wanna know what
---
you are blue to rmt and have corps in rmt, might not be a part of the north but you sure as hell are affiliated with them
---
It's an old, discontinued, official model. People would literally murder for CCP to give a model kit license to someone like Bandai, but noooooooooooooooooooo....

Not baiting. Sold my apoc and raven a year or so ago on eBay. Kept the other since it was more fragile.  Chucked it along with my trading cards. Still have my books that I’d give away if someone was local.

---
good proposal
---
I know, my tongue in cheek comment has clearly not gone down very well with the denizens of reddit. v0v
---
More personally, I’d say it’s pretty underwhelming when you attack an alliance of thousands as a gang of 30 (only realistic way of poking them is to tackle a rafting cap/rorq, no one cares about VNIs) and the response is still overwhelming super escalation, waste of opportunity for a good scrap. 
---
i think Init achieved there mission from the fight yesterday
---
U wot 
---
can you give an aprox. location?
---
Hands down. Best troll ever. TOS violation will deal with it though.
---
Central OK
---
Yeah this is my biggest hangup. I can make 20M in few hours selling ore. VS grinding that ore up and making components and HOPING they sell.
---
Not much else of worth to poke as a raider than a ratting or mining cap (also not much else to poke of any worth). I do love that the psychology of alliances has moved (across the course of a decade) from ‘lol our miners got caught out, should have paid more attention’ to ‘save our miners, they drive our industry’  :)
---
I’d say the option of a staggered escalation was still there, as it always is, it’s just more difficult to execute (we struggle with that too). Arguably it would have meant more overall entertainment time across both fleets.
---
To give Panfam credit (especially PH &lt;3) Geminate is one of the places we can reliably get something fun looking to fight when we roll in, though you guys sometimes have a bit of an issue with over-forming, which sucks for both sides in preventing the fight. 
---
Well, I don't.  I'm not dumb enough to join Horde.
---
Said with an initiative tag? Would have been more interesting than turbo blobbing with titans, that’s old and boring. Might even have been fun. Welcome to disagree, fun is subjective after all.

---
diamond rats give no bounties whatsoever. it's a bug I reported when they came out who's still open
---
init is the only ones that look like bringing content...even if i dont agree with them beeing goon pets
---
Both, but price is the far bigger issue here. The price/performance balance is way out of proportion with carriers and dreads. Just removing insurance for capitals would already help.
---
Is this SMA crying on reddit for help... again?
---
You mean forced tgeir members to dock in citadels and asset safety
---
There are also Membercorps in which you can just pay a flat fee to buy you out from any internal PVP participation requirements. They have their own renters, so to speak.
---
Everything else has a counter. Example: You get dropped by a battleship in a frigate: get under the guns, sig tank, use speed to escape, etc. Anything you can either kill with smarts or at least disengage from. Superior numbers notwithstanding, there is always a counter play.
---
However, there is no outplaying a cap drop. The range, application, DPS, and tank, just make them an I-WIN button (and no, killmails of an AFK pilot in a shitfit don't counter that).
---
Once you can fly a cap, there is no reason to fly anything else, save for a jaunt into high-sec. They make every other ship type obsolete. Meaning someone new to the game either has to inject, hide in high sec, or just accept that they're useless until they get through months of training pointless ships until they get into 'real' ships (too demoralising for many). Sure, you'll get some who dig their heels in and decide they want to force a subcap into the meta, and will convince themselves that the handful of times they avoided getting noticed makes them relevant, but it takes a special type of mental fortitude to persist when the game is no longer a sandbox, but a shitty long tutorial-mode until you reach the 'real' game with caps.
---
Give them crap subcap application, nerf damage, nerf tank, bottom out range...I don't know what would or could fix it. But having a tiny range of ships that can counter literally everything else is poor design, and exactly what will turn off players who are unable to afford to speed up the training into them to be relevant.
---
Curios, what is the going rate to have CCP save your keepstar shield timer? (GF anyways, despite the ccplease)
---
I was away from the game due to work for a year, when I came like a week ago I started looking for the perfect abyssal mwd. I was a bit to picky tbh so it never happened. There was no point in abyssal point as it's already basic at its lock range, but I was going to swap it anyway when I found the perfect mwd.
---
Woah you managed to get less than a 0.5 ratio with supers congratz.
---
rip dude
---
... Shit...
---
Ccplz, Stratios model 
---
Why would we beat a dead horse?
---
&gt;  Left Jita without trouble, in heavily tanked travel fit
---
See that's why newer people die, they not only don't travel tank it, often they even add cargo expanders to haul some more shit, you Sir know your stuff so that's good.
---
I think of it more as performance bonuses.
---
Question, running a HAM setup ship, while circling a adversaire, is it wiser to use the microwarp which gives me more speed but increases my ship radius, or cut the MW so being slower easier to hit me but having a ship radius size much slower making me more difficult to hit me. Now does that make sense? 
---
I think this is probably what happened. I just had an (intentional) hostile interaction, and I notice that the timers aren't super obvious. I was pretty tired during the bubble incident, so I probably just didn't notice it. 
---
You havent really beaten any horse lately. 
---
They don't have the same challenges. 
---
They need to sell ship models. It's a ridiculous business decision that they don't. The profit mark up would be huge and people would spend money hand over fist for them!
---
They would make more in selling ship models than subscriptions in a month!
---
If you had any critical thinking skills whatsoever you might think about that one and say "hm this tastes an awful lot like koolaid"
---
Abyssal mods weren't a thing when I made it and I had just got back to the game due to work, I was being to picky on finding the best mwd for it. The drone situation is a bit more meh. Started out with a ton of augmented but brave killed them every time I got in a fight and I got in a lot more fights than killmails as brave would bring a fleet of FU whiptail stuff. I was thinking about getting more but tbh t2's where doing the just fine so, I guess you are correct on your comment but it's not quite so black and white.
---
But can you follow up on the timer? :thonking:
---
But does it float?
---
How big is a capsule? Do capsuleers have enough space to have a kitchen and toilets? Or is there just enough space for the clone?
---
Well goons surely played it right, Dead Coaliton are no longer friends with Panfam
---
I was thinking maybe a caedes, but if she's already got killmarks on it then she's in good hands
---
&gt; You simply cannot expect for most of the players to give up everything in their first Eve week and Join Horde or Karmafleet straight away. That's simply not how player progression works.
---
Except that can be exactly how it works. Just because you are afraid to go to null doesn't make it a bad idea to go there as quickly as you can. 
---
Basically everything you do in null makes more isk than doing it in highsec. And you should be learning how to operate in null and wormhole space anyway. I wish i had, and not spent 2 years grinding up to L4s and ruining my Caldari standings because i'm dumb.
---
Thx, keep in mind some things are about to change.

On top of the PvP issues they also do a lot of damage to the entire game via economy. You can find ratting carriers that get popped once in a while on zkill for as low as 1.3 bil. Then you factor in the insurance and they become same price as a faction fit Gila, not even blinged, while the ticks they provide are so out of scale that they're basically disposable, like VNIs. You straight out factor the losses into your ratting, often don't even need to fight or counter at all.
---
As for the OP, it is both, however, I would like to point out that if caps and supers weren't so rediculous, then it would not have gotten to this point, or at least no where near because people would end up being more spread instead.
---
Depends what Tier you are about to run. My own experience so far Gamma 70m each Exotic 90m each Electrical 70m each and atm i run 50 Plasma to see an Average

As always, incredible! Keep it up

Alphas can't fly T2 ships and can't use cloaks or MJDs. Puts a huge dent on some stuff like explo, and some battlecruiser / battleship stuff.
---
Catch is our home! Stainwaggon, Volition, Test and Brave can burn our flags but we will never leave. 
---
I would have got one sooner but there was a amazing t2 one and I was like imagine if there was a pirate version with those stats... Anyway the fit didn't kill it poor judgement and a good gate camp did so it doesn't bother me to much
---
&lt;3
---
/u/CCP_Falcon Can we get an official response on something like this? There are tons of people who would spend tons of money on shit like this.
---
Can we have more of this.
---
Pick a different ship then 😉
---
I don't disagree with you. I love running missions in undersized ships for the challenge. I was just presenting the only argument i could see.
---
Honestly I don't think it's either of those two being the problem.
---
I believe the two main problems are:
---
1.) The effectiveness of a capital ship again something as small as a frigate. 
---
 Think about this in real life terms. A battleship (the boat) really doesn't have all that much to combat a Somalian pirate at a distance.  Yes up close you have small caliber guns but those don't hit very far out compared to the large caliber of guns.  So let's equate the small guns to smart bombs and large guns to any other capital weapon.  That pirate should be able to harass that boat for quite a while without just getting nuked by the large guns.  Yet in EvE, fighter bombers, dread guns, etc. all accompanied by heavy webs and shit can easily apply to a tiny little frigate.
---
2.) There a ton of capital ships in the game, but due to TiDi currently not nearly enough of them die on a regular occasion.
---
You would figure at this point if there is a group that can probably replace any of the largest ships in the game instantly (goons), that they would be going around and wreaking havoc on any group possible in order to keep their capital numbers higher than everyone else's.  Again politics come into play here, but even in the real world you have wars that destroy vessels to maintain superiority over other entities.  These types of wars haven't happened since the proliferation of capitals in EvE.  A war seemingly now consists of bashing a couple structures, maybe killing a keepstar or three, then heading back home and creating peace again.  This has made for people with capitals being super bored and just throwing them at anything because they are basically useless for the better part of 365 days a year.
---
But anyways, that I believe is why capitals are a problem.  I'm willing to bet others agree at least to a certain extent.
---
Jesus Christ lol
---
You can defang a carrier and getting in under the guns of a haw dread/titan is still possible
---
This is why I sit next to the window in the office.
---
&gt;I was always a solo player
---
&gt;I was primarily mining
---
&gt;I always enjoyed the game
---
boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
yeah sure it is, but to some degree that applies to pvp kills as well. guess in the same way as vegans don't need a veganpatch to let everyone know they're in fact super elite vegans. 
---
so yeah it isn't needed at all, but it wouldn't hurt anyone either &amp; since the system is allready in place it wouldn't take much to copy pasta it to the other side of the hull or sth
---
Or the ewar and remote sebo etc
---
Do i require a different account to use steam?
---
I'm not sure what you'd want in terms of an official response?
---
We're focused on making EVE right now, given the core issues that the community has raised, not on making merchandise or expending effort trying to source more partners to do so. It's a trade-off on whether we want more people on our business development side, or more people actually making the game.
---
We have a great partner based in the US who operates our store and provides store service for all our real world events, we're not looking to take it any further than that at this stage.
---
Did you mean Photoshop? ☺
---
This needs more effort to make it to the ranks of shit post
---
Understandable, especially with the current state of affairs and there is a ton of wonderful development work going on right now which is very appreciated, especially the work on the 64 bit client(WiS when? lol)
---
What about CCP choosing to take a turn towards microtransactions in the last couple of years as apposed to say producing/out-sourcing ship models for sale?
---
i dont think anyone is asking if ravens are OP, maybe if some other aspect of the fight was OP though...
---
I mean theres a three day wait so kind of on a par with hand guns
---
Down voted; TL;DR, U Mad.
---
Yea being a good carrier pilot before the changes was a more skill intensive both sp wise and player wise. New fighters are largely to blame for everyone’s complaints though. Being able to MWD, missile swarm and use turret attack’s whenever you want to is what makes them overpowered. 
---
Who even lives in fade nowadays 
---
 i like the fitting challenge, but yeah, remove the ISK/hr and a lot of these things get a lot more fun.
---
Two things kill EVE fun for me: ISK/hr and trying to be isk positive in a fight 😀
---
sounds like you need some more amarr focused skins
---
What about just buffing the counterplay to caps. You could make bombers more effective against them by increasing bomb damage, increasing cap sig radius and increasing the explosion radius of bombs to stop them being too good against subs.
---
Meanwhile you make caps unable to apply to frigates. Now you have a strong counterplay to caps unless they have subs or defender dessies on grid too. 
---
I don't agree with that. Flying shit fit T1 frigates because you have 0 isk is not fun period.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aycexi/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_march_07/

The most it could need is modern touch-ups and maybe some playing around with the head fins to make it look a lot more fierce.

As I know, you can add your existing account(s), because Steam launches default EVE Launcher.

For those not aware of what this is, for a while, CCP was selling ship models of four EVE battleships: Apoc, Tempest, Raven, Megathron. The models are made out of polystone and as such have a very nice weight and feel to them without being super-heavy.
---
    Polystone is a manufacturing medium used for cast sculptures, it is hard to find one that delivers a cleaner, more substantial representation of an original sculpture than a product manufactured in Polystone. Polystone has a significant weight, a porcelain like feel to the touch, and an incredible ability to capture the most minute detail, making it unsurpassed in collectible manufacturing materials.
---
    Polystone is a compound made up largely of polyurethane resin mixed with powdered stone additives that give it added weight and the porcelain or "stone-like" feel that resulted in the materials name itself. Polystone is durable and highly effective at maintaining a sharp paint finish. Unlike porcelain which is fired in an oven, Polystone is a cold-cast material in which no heat is used in the manufacturing process, resulting in much greater variations of paint finish.

The only issue was the price. For most of their run, you had to cough up nearly $150 U.S. for one of these babies, so the sell rate was pretty low. About five generations of the EVE store ago (I forget the exact year), CCP went through and did a house-cleaning of all of the at that time existing EVE merchandise, including these models and so the price of them was reduced to about $30. That cleared out most of the stock.
---
Still, there were a large number of Apocs left and a smaller number of Tempests left, so CCP brought them to one of the first EVE Vegas events and everyone who bought a ticket got one or the other for free. I don't know if it's true or not, but I was told by one of the devs in attendance that the boxes were filling an office at CCP HQ and the order went out to get rid of them so the office could be used. At the end of that EVE Vegas, there were still a few Apocs left, so anyone who happened to be walking by the registration booth was given a second one.
---
All of this was years ago, around 2011 or so. So, there's some number of these still floating around. In my experience, their rarity is Apoc (least rare) -&gt; Tempest -&gt; Raven -&gt; Mega (most rare).
---
And now you know (and knowing is half the battle).
---
Each to their own. Even more a reason for the option
---
Yup, im mad ccp is shit and run by short sighted idiots.
---
Just missing isboxer integration and more creative suites and i'd sign right up. 
---
Is it a stupid question? really, how can I know what systems are cyno jammed without wasting hours going in each one of them?
---
yes next time use photoshop :)
---
or speling
---
The problem with selling sci-fi ship models is the audience for them is pretty small so your product has to make a lot of compromises to keep cost down. The usual compromise choice is [big, good feel, hard to break, detailed], pick two. If you pick two, you can keep the cost to $30 or so. Picking three doubles this, and picking all four doubles it again. The Apoc model above chose all four (and so was super expensive). The Rifter USB hub included with the EVE Collector's edition chose big and detailed.
---
Even if you do just pick two (Eaglemoss, to use one example, picked detailed and hard to break), after that you have to consider the size of the audience for any given model. EVE ships vary between the iconic and the just-barely-not-despised. Eaglemoss's models (for Star Trek and such) have the same problem. So if you picked a dozen different EVE ships, say, you'd probably sell out of two of them and then be stuck with a shipping crate full of some less-loved ship that wouldn't sell.
---
So in the aggregate, you'd make almost no money and that wouldn't encourage you to repeat the experiment.
---
Sooner or later, 3D printing will solve this problem to an extent, but the current 3D printed models don't have a good feel, are easy to break, and most of them aren't very detailed, so you're really just picking one out of the four most times, and sometimes not even that.
---
NO, you CAN use T2 weapons up to the medium weapons. So T2 weapons up to battlecruisers. Though I don't know what T2 modules you can use. I am pretty sure you can use some, but not all
---
Yes, but you live there to remind highsec why being there is bad
---
Do you by any chance happen to sell Ravens to Init members?
---
Wow, so you know how much work it would take to do something?  You should totally apply for a job with CCP.  Because fuck taking development time away from things that actually need doing just to make PvE killmarks that I could max out in an afternoon.
---
Can we award this man the top comment of the year already?
---
There's no reason why CCP couldn't pick the most beloved ships. *They already know which ones those are.* 
---
If the anime merch industry has taught me anything, it's that a decent quality figure that's only a few inches tall will be bought for over a hundred dollars by fans. 
---
So... 
---
remove cap insurance
---
Increase price of capitals
---
remove fax/capital application to subcaps
---
What else would make caps more balanced?
---
dude like all things considered its a suicide gank of a rorq and a mino. like why would you not go for it, its 2019 and people have suicide dreads at this point, hello!?
---
Too late. The Rorqual aristocrats will want this as they have already made infinite isk!
---
It's mainly the caps. It wasn't a big problem, before basically everyone was able to fly them, only because you can always overcome them with lower mass. Now, it's never going to be a 10vs1 subvscap battle but rather a 3vs1. And caps in this situations are too strong.
---
Now, it's only natural that the players evolve and eventually are able to play with the "best" weapons, as long as the endgame is static. (wow just resets every expansion, but wot has this problem too) Injectors are NOT the cause of this, players would eventually progress to this stage anyways. Injectors help to reach this "endgame" meta faster. But in the end, the inherent problem is the missbalance of capitals vs subcapitals, all other "problems" are just a changing the time, when this missbalance becomes relevant and surpressive.
---
because eve community goes full autism about anything like that instead of actually testing the change
---
apart from the shitposts on both sides, we rly lile the content you bring, thats the mood on coms, discord and all. So thanks and gf dudes o7
---
Gods, I just heard CCP Fozzie in my head: "And tell me, what are the top ten ships flown in EVE?"
---
Point being that the most flown ships and the most beloved ships that people would actually want a model of are likely very different things. Even "beloved" and "would want a model of" are probably different things. I had on-going love affairs with both the Vagabond and Taranis for years, but I don't want a model of either one.
---
it's like 4m long

: / :shrug: it’s aight, d00d3r.
---
Your a pilot known for baiting for project mayhem and snuff, I dont see why the rag warping off was a bad idea? When a cyno went up.
---
They didn’t have to be so mean :( they even sarcastically acted like I have friends!
---
ok this one made me laugh!
---
Dead horses don't try to return the beating
---
The problem isn't the shiptype, its the player mentality adapting to the metagame, why would anyone that has played EVE for years and their playstyle revolves around a CTA and is part of a huge coalition block that inhabits 50% of the null sec be motivated to attack their former blue coalition mates when they can just login on ping, jump and crush a small gang of upstarts trying to harass and otherwise huddle around eachother for warmth in the cold void?  
---
Change structure mechanics around reinforce timer, add more interesting and exciting regions or wormholes, add roaming nebulas that act as a constellation wide temporary cyno inhibitor, improve the loot dropping on titans/structures blowing up and then maybe something exciting would happen.
---
Fly amarr and use purity of the throne skins. Looks gooood
---
Oh how the turns commented.
---
But...I like my big potato.
---
If they would put this much effort into actually growing themselfs maybe they could just fight you over the citadell next time.
---
I also like your big potato 
---
\-1/10

It *is* likable.
---
The only thing that triggers my nostalgic cringe reflex more than the old Eve graphics is the terrible mid-2000s nu metal
---
Very refreshing to read something that issnt filled with hate and bias. If more people had that attitude im sure we would have more people playing. I do understand that the hate and reddit sperge is mostly F1 drones (doesnt exclude us btw.) so its all fine :D
---
I don't get the refference 
---
I love no mods on eve
---
How much?
---
There a bit bigger than a person say 2m by 2.5 or so 
---
someone need to read the battlereport... if a rorqual die its fine if you cause alot of more dmg to the enemies :)
---
ccp guards departure is a huge loss for the game but i wish him a lot of success and a blast with what he is going to do now (◠‿◠✿)
---
apart from this, had a lot of fun with small scale and solo pvp this week already (ﾟヮﾟ)
---
Stuff much better than isboxer is available in linux ... it is linux 
---
He is shooting panfam, just fyi
---
like who cares, why are you upset that they lost a worthless battleship fleet? maybe they wanted to kill more caps and boosh around like faggots more until the hammer dropped?
---
i have good hope for the incoming balance post. really looking toward reading the csm minutes 
---
Battleships vs Super and Titan blob. Finally someone has the balls to fight these bullies.
---
oooooo, navy issue!!!  congrats!    
---
I was able to score 3 ships in my CCP career, but never faction editions :(
---
I have a Raven, Tempest and Apoc (and lots of dust and other various things jammed ontop of a book shelf)

Wait Cerbs couldn’t apply to 100MN Loki? But they have like 90km range with RLMLs. That should have been plenty of DPS/Application. 
---
Turn on the stove and find out!
---
200 IQ , playing yasuo vs riven music . Ur league of legends subhuman .
---
You have no idea how many players injected capital skills ....
---
For real!!
---
It's a *multiplayer* sandbox game, with an emphasis on PVP. I want reward to be balanced with risk of being hunted. If you want risk free farming you should get risk free rewards, like highsec anomalies.
---
And if you want a game with risk free farming, there are plenty of options for that too. Eve should be a balance, and at the moment the balance (in K space at least) is far too far towards safe farming.
---
Careful, you're dangerously close to ruining the narrative with your 'tactics' and 'reasonable ideas'
---
Something needs to be changed. There needs to be objectives a small fleet can do inside enemy space. Right now it's pretty much down to roaming around and watching everyone dock to try and form a bigger fleet, while you pick off nubs that never watch intel or local.  
---
CCP needs to figure out ways separate tasks between caps and sub-caps to get us flying again. Caps need more defined roles around sov and structures. They shouldn't be a sub-cap fleet killer. 
---
I mean... If you can get your faction battle ship to do 3k DPS and tank 5k of damage with 1 million ehp of buffer then yes maybe we would have the same problem even if caps were removed... Plz link fit tho
---
Your money alone won't pay for the production and shipping costs for a minimum run of 5000 items, or whatever is needed to bring the price down to a reasonable level. Could CCP sell enough ship models to pay for production? Probably not, even if 10% of Reddit nerds would buy the same ship.
---
leave my thrasher alone damnit!
---
Yep, but for me the number of capitals players can field is the issue. You can kill a carrier in a RR destroyers, and higher you go with ships you use the easier it gets. Single carrier is a 'soft' target... issue is in 10 others that jump in to save it. Years ago you had to spend more time to kill a carrier than now ... but it usually died as no one was coming to save it. 
---
True although if you've ever down an unsupported carrier against a gang of more than 6 guys, they're very vulnerable to deranging... Dreads however really can just YOLO into most subcap gangs with zero fear
---
If it’s such a slam dunk, build the business yourself and give ccp a cut. You’re rich, and everyone’s happy.
---
The voice of reason. Well said. 
---
Wow. You are thick. Whaling fleets aren’t about “having fun” first. This deployment wasn’t about “having fun” for either side. Yes, it’s a game so some level of fun is required but ultimately that’s a side effect.
---
Goons aren’t worried about the other side “having fun” in Delve.
---
It’s fucking disingenuous to pretend that suggesting we should be worried about *your* fun when the roles are reversed.
---
PS: I like my Initiative flair. Occasionally gets people to prove their biases. Don’t worry, it’s only temporary.
---
This is much older then 2010 eve, it was just rehosted in 2010 but classic video.
---
Plz, don't hurt my Orca! ToT
---
Leave muh Thrashers alone!
---
for once met some nice guys in the c2 next door. had a quick talk went shoot thing together. praise bob and kudos to eschelon
---
Eve 2010 was better game
---
You can bring mroe caps of course
---
well thats mostly because the meta evolved. first it was 5 DCU ratting carriers that had no cyno and very little tank. then it moved to geckos meaning you didnt have to fit DCUs to get the same ticks. this opened you up to fitting cyno, remote reps etc in the highslots and tank elsewhere.
---
*meanwhile in Planetside 2...*
---
I do t understand what you’re saying. Does it have any relevance to what I said?
---
Well duh, because capitals are flat out better and you can't compete in null without them. In terms of proliferation the damage is done, the only way to fix this is to nerf what capitals are capable of. Then it doesn't matter how many injected into them already.
---
Sure, that still doesn't change my point, they are making a hardware survey for their new tech demo for their gaming engine, and they don't include the 2nd biggest and only other gpu manufacturer in the market? It raises some questions is all i'm saying.
---
Initially i thought that maybe they had some kind of partnership with intel and nvidia and that's why they omitted AMD name, but i don't see either intel or nvidia logo on their site, so that can't be it.
---
Am newbro. Fly through galaxy. Fly into wormholes. Space is silent. Eve is good to me.

Great Post, Thanks Kilo!

Totally just wanted to PSA this as it is meant to Discredit our alliance.   
---
We don't care who or what you like as long as you like to jump in fleet and chill out on coms to make some ISK.  
---
Fly safe space friends!
---
Looks great, though my eyes had trouble with the yellow text. I'm getting old I guess.
---
Haha I think you nailed it, and I think I'm chasing the rush of being new again. It's a bummer that is just not the same. 
---
This is like 2007. 
---
that aged well...
---
Outsourcing and delagating is a thing Guard, get professionals to do this. Hell it was possible to do it 10 years ago it sure as hell didn't more expensive.
---
It isn't so much a range issue as it is a speed/signature issue. 
---
Although light missiles might apply (near) perfectly to cruisers standing still, this is not the case when 100MN comes into play. 
---
For example:
---
The signature size of the target(loki) is larger than the explosion radius of the light missile, thus it will deal 100% damage in that regard.
---
The speed of the target(loki) is larger than the explosion velocity of the light missile, thus it will deal diminished damage in that regard. And as their speed will likely be close to 1km/s higher than the explosion velocity, the amount of damage that gets reduced is massive.
---
This is very visible for example at 5:45 in the video. Where using Sheleziaka as a damage amount to trace. 
---
While he is speed matching the webbed down scimitar, he gets 375 damage per tick from Sheleziaka. As he picks up speed and goes above the explosion velocity it drops to 193 very quickly. So they can nearly half the damage they receive just by picking up speed. 
---
In this particular case, the same would have happened with a 50mn MWD I think, as signature radius isn't really a factor. But MWDs have more weaknesses than a 100mn AB for such a small gang that often fight fleets. 
---
❤️
---
Sometimes, the second a comment like that leaves your fingertips, or your lips, it makes you sit back and reevaluate your life.
---
Yes. In lowsec you'll also go suspect.  
---
Groups of Typhoon works pretty well for citadel bashing. If nobody's shooting back you can also use battlecruisers. Oracles are very nice since lasers mean no ammo and no reloading.  
---
Yes, the effect happens when you reload and start firing again. The warp disruption is a hardcoded effect that happens when you initiate aggression on a citadel.
---
They should team up with fantasy flight games and make an x-wing type EVE board game. 
---
Thanks. I'll look into that.
---
I don’t get the ghost sites I did one and it blew me up
---
What does it need another mid slot for?
---
Also do you cloak when you are doing the hack? 
---
Propaganda at 1 isk. We are still here, look the fight yesterday. Ok we lost the isk war but it was fun ;)

bombers and frigs in general are hilariously overpowered right now. so no.

Matte black for all ships would be very popular.

I'm pretty sure CCP has been tracking whos been stacking lvl 4 and 5 missions because its very easy. If your stacking agent missions your mission account should be  making more enough to sub omega to your account. It's just common sense to adjust it so omega is required to get the prize.
---
Honestly, it sounds like you just ended up in a bad corporation. You probably could have jumped ship to another membercorp, since you were actually making an effort to integrate, but it sounds like it's too late now so whatevs.
---
The main thing that you're hung up on is that you're considering a "renter" to be a status that you can acquire through a particular style of engagement (or non-engagement). Or, to put it more bluntly, you're using it as an epithet. I consider a renter someone who makes a willing decision to pay a fee for access to space, in full understanding of the transaction. By my definition, GSF has no renters in-alliance. We have plenty of worthless krabs, to be sure, and they definitely contribute to our bottom line via taxation, but they aren't explicitly paying money for access to space. If they choose not to krab, or choose non-taxable methods of krabbing such as exploration, they aren't denied access to Delve and our services. In the traditional renter model, renters have to pay or get their asses thrown out.
---
Another thing you're missing is our recruitment standards. Believe it or not, we do have *some* standards. We reject many corporation applications for not meeting our size or quality standards. For these people, renting may be their only option.
---
There's more nuance here, of course, but this is about as much as I am comfortable saying publicly. Some of this shit gets into high-level organizational tribal knowledge, and, well, that shit is our edge. If this ain't good enough to convince anyone, then I'll just have to take the conversational loss here for the sake of my org.
---
just stfu idiot
---
... which means I'll be able to go on TaoBao and buy it for $150. Sweet!

Also. Obligatory grr goons post.

A downvote and a report is the best i can do.
---
Affiliated in the sense that we shoot them more than anyone else? I guess so. Really feels like you're stretching pretty fucking hard to justify why your masters couldn't win in the north but what do I know, I'm just some panfam pet
---
Sig radius / explosion radius is in the velocity part of the equation too.
---
It’s a cool mechanic that you abuse here but it’s really not cool
---
It only took a moment, but I downvoted this and every comment of yours I could find. I hope we can all come together as a community and tell you to go fuck yourself.
---
Go shoot rmt then, prove your independance 
---
You have been flairbaited btw
---
They could go Vanta Black and just have ship shaped holes in space!
---
That's a lot of effort to go to to troll someone. Particularly as it makes your corp look quite attractive.
---
Imo do not sub until you have all the alpha state skills trained rather then spend the money on a sub buy alpha injectors. They sell well and you can use them daily to speed up that one skill you need to acually do something fun 
---
&gt; Imagine if caps were out the game totally, I wonder if we would still be having this conversation, but about Faction Battleships instead of caps
---
No because faction battleships
---
- have a reasonable cost after insurance
---
- can't apply to everything
---
- can't have a frigate level scan res with NSA
---
- can't point you at 500km
---
- can't jump in and out of fights with impunity
---
There is only one!
---
Jeveassets FTW!
---
And also mogul since i am cannot stop checking my income 
---
Sounds like a plan my dude. 
---
&gt; There needs to be objectives a small fleet can do inside enemy space.
---
And those objectives need to be reachable without getting caps dropped on you at a gate. It all comes back to caps being something that you can bring to any subcap engagement and win.
---
Korean game company owns CCP... Korean staff start being brought it... Mediocre think. 
---
I second jeveassets 
---
And mogul!
---
I expect nothing less as its probably against some rules. 
---
If you are running under the guns of something, you will probably be within under 10 km aka scram range, so there is a good chance you will not be able to run your MWD at all. Even if you can, a cruiser/battlecruiser wouldn't be able to keep up top speed at such a tight orbit. If you expect to run into this kind of engagement a lot, consider swapping out the MWD for an AB or going for a dual prop setup.
---
Running MWD at tight orbit can be a tactical decision in some situations with ships that get an MWD sig bloom reduction or frigates, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where MWD would bring any advantage over not running it.
---
Perfect for covops. 
---
You cant cloak when doing the hack
---
THATS THE OLD APOC

HNNNGGGG

Injectors and te removal of combat refitting were a mistake. People told CCP, nobody listened, and now we are here.
---
Monkey's paw wish: EVE is fixed into a turbo asian grindp2w fest
---
Ugg ya that does not seem worth it. Maybe when I have more disposable income 
---
I'm in slyce. Isn't that enough to say grr goons? 
---
Could fooled me, you sound like every other self righteous Init poster, too high from sniffing their own farts to be bothered with reality 
---
I'm sure if we spent more time shooting rmt then goons would have won. What a stupid and arbitrary fucking standard you're setting for who is allied to whom. 
---
&gt; You sound like a flat earther.
---
I love how you just threw that in there. 
---
Just for curiosities sake how much have you thrown into this game? You're free not to answer but I've yet to see someone this heavily devoted towards this game, I admit I stopped paying attention to the game years ago but I had figured that the majority accepted it was never going to happen and begun looking towards refund options.
---
Carrier ratting the probably one of more balanced ratting experiences in eve right now. Provides decent tics while not being multiboxable, and actually requires player input. More approachable than abyssal sites or WHs but also less profitable. 
---
So being blue is not being affiliated with someone. K 
---
Never said you were allies
---
some of the clips are even older than that Mbappe1811
---
Evidence?
---
&gt; shipping/export fees are stupendous for what does make it to exports
---
Except now they use a U.S. based distributor so they're no longer shipping out of Iceland. They just have no concept of giving their customers acceptable shipping rates.
---
Ideally the fix makes small numbers of carriers in the core of a sub fleet potent, without making it so that you achieve a better outcome replacing all of those subs with more carriers.
---
I got one from the silent auction at Vegas.
---
Maybe if you pay me back for that astrahus you supposed to defend I'll let you touch it. 
---
Only someone who fly's only caps would say that LOL. Frigs  even bombers are easily killed by dessies and cruisers but you would probably never know that because frigs are the only thing that can skirt around your supers/titans therefore OP. 
---
I managed to pick up the one at the latest EVE Vegas auction. Not a navy issue but still fuckin sweet. 
---
Thanks to Greygal for being generous enough to donate it to the auction, you rock.

That guy got greedy and DD'ed twice. Desync is amazing spin though keep it up.

Mining in geninate with an orca is very good income and lot of fun. I would consider that at least.
---
Hull pen would like a word with you.
---
I'm mostly a HISEC PVE player, so what is everyone's opinions on the Kronos for a mission ship?
---
But But But i thought we are fighting toooooo ?   
---
lol 
---
Do you dislike work places that give you only 2 weeks notice, too? Because that fuckes up people's lives.
---
And have a slightly more constrained bpc acquisition process.
---
&gt;What can I do to help us get this corp off the ground?
---
Maany things.
---
First let me repeat what was so accurately said below: Choose a niche and goddam stick to it. Define your culture and stick to it so long as it doesnt harm the group. At all times, your members should be able to tell, "oh yeah we are an indy corp, we do this, and that, and we have that long term project"
---
Now lets talk 'bout basic stuff: PVP. EVE is struggle. Thanks to the wardec system rework, youre temporarily safe. But all that is worth a dime in this game is gonna award you some competition to earn it. Just ask around for a cheap T1 Cruiser doctrine that has good scalability (vexor, ruptures or others) that you choose as a default corp setup. Roam at least once a month (lowsec is fine) in it so you get an idea of how it fares against real opponents.
---
Once your survival is thought about, lets talk bout isk making. You want your corp to unlock new isk options for your members. Its up to you how you do it, either with mining boosts, refineries to moon mine or more elaborate schemes like lowsec PI setups, but you gotta create VALUE for your members, or theyll just leave you for goons. Good value creation will probably mean youll piss off someone somewhere, be ready for it. 
---
And finally, fun. Its up to you, run lotteries, do some frigate roams around, roleplay a pilgrimage to the EVE gate, but you gotta do it.
---
Pay attention to the order i mentionned it: there are priorities. In the same way that you wont build the roof of a house first, you wont drop a citadel without being able to defend and replace it. 
---
Good luck with that, 
---
While I agree with you, these truths don’t scale well. A reasonable comparison might be as 10 frigates can’t defang 10 rattlesnakes in time before they die, so 10 rattlesnakes can’t defang 10 carriers in time before they die. 
---
This is reasonable on the face of it, but frigates can out-manoeuvre battleships on and off grid, leaving them far behind as they roam. The same cannot be said of battleships and carriers.
---
I don’t want to go on at length, but the basic issue is that a lot of the balancing factors that apply at scale between different sized subcaps do not apply comparing subs to caps, because their projection, application, EHP and repair values scale exponentially instead of logarithmically.
---
&gt; selling sci-fi ship models is the audience for them is pretty small
---
its probably a 1:1 mapping to eve online players though.
---
I kinda made that point tho right ? neither do you.
---
Unless CCP releases these numbers no one knows. id still be willing to be its not as bad as most people think, because when you think about it you realise most players in the game now have probably been playing for years so could probably fly them already.
---
cant be sure without numbers tho
---
ummmm. I'll let everyone else say stuff
---
Hope all is well gave you my best downvote and reported this post. May God have mercy on your soul
---
NICE ANOTHER BALANCE SUGGESTION POST CANT WAIT TO READ IT 
---
Imagine thinking people care about your sexuality in 2019.
---
As an aside, the posts on evejobs have been removed and the user banned.
---
I don't think you understand. I don't mind paying out the ass if it's directly tied to the product.
---
I'd buy a 1-foot painted plastic Maller for a few hundred. Literally just hire someone with a high DPI 3D printer and decent painting skills and sell it as limited runs. They'd make bank.
---
Fantastic
---
I suspect the definition of risk/reward that you believe to be reasonable is quite different. For example, my expectation was calibrated on risking a 500m HAC for 15m ticks roaming asteroid belts a decade ago, which is awful compared to carrier ratting now.
---
I would think that for the investment and Actual risk from NPCs, the reward should be somewhere around 50m/hr because you don’t face random spawns or absolute destruction on clear speed/tank failure, the isk loss after insurance is comparable, with the only real risk being undesired explosion-oriented player interaction.
---
I shot coffee out of my nose reading this. Thank you.

That's where cap nerfs come in. Just as some ships have specific roles they can and can't do. Capitals roles should not be a sub-cap fleet killer. Which means they need to have defined roles that benefit the capital ship and negative reasons against them when not being used in their specific role. No one would bring 20 battleships to scare away 50 cruisers. Caps should not have that power. Their power should be against other caps, revolving around sov and structures. At the very least they should have some effect on battleships, but anything lower should be significantly nerfed.  
---
thank you friend its nice to see positivity
---
Inaccurate. I actually TRIED to get an apoc for 150$ and the shipping alone to Canada was 130.
---
The shipping for these was just so stupid outrageous that even at 70% off you were still coughing up 120$ USD for one.
---
plus for all you know, they're being absolute assholes to any people who message them honestly. this may look fine on the outside, but who knows what vile shit theyre saying in private to members theyre "recruiting"
---
genuinely sorry about this. pretty pathetic theyre going to these lengths to try to discredit you instead of just fighting.

&gt; Ad hominem is the resort of the unintelligent or unimaginative, draw your own conclusion there...
---
Trite and *also* disingenuous. I made an observation using colorful language that you try and pass off as a character flaw of mine. What’s the real ad hominem?
---
&gt; Our whaling fleets are fun first v0v at least for our dudes,
---
I’m sure Pando is definitely pinging for whaling fleets without caring about strategic or tactical objectives. This is a very believable statement.
---
&gt; That you don’t view having fun in a game as a priority for even your own side is kinda mind boggling. I hope you aren’t in a leadership position thinking like that.
---
...I think you *dramatically* misunderstood what I said, or you are intentionally again being disingenuous with your phrasing.
---
&gt; I am fully aware goons (among many others) don’t prioritise their opponents fun, but my point was that it’s taken far enough by big blocs for the most part that it’s either no fun for their own members, or for vanishingly few of them.
---
... Hi, you *are* Goons, or at least close enough to benefit and detriment from the actions they take directly. Also, Nobody prioritizes their opponents fun in strategic fights like this. If you want someone who *does* try and avoid burning out content, you would look at Horde with its strict policies on not dropping in Geminate on content providers. I feel like your biases here are blinding you to the fact that it’s *your* side of the table that has by and large created the situation we are in currently that you seem to dislike.
---
&gt; Who do you think I even am to get that riled up? Me, I don’t really care who you fly with, it was the juxtaposition I was commenting on. Good to know you’re considerate enough to not wear your own colours to spew low value diatribe.
---
I’m not here to “rile” *you* up. Not here to rile *anyone* up. Most people here come pre-riled. As I said, flairbaiting is a fantastic way to figure out who’s actually reading and who’s arguing or agreeing based on flair. On both sides.
---
Also, you start by calling me out for attacking you, and end with an attack of your own. Maybe next time go for being more consistent in how you treat people regardless of their flair, and judge people based on what they actually write. We can all be better, together. Still human, still EVE players.
---
Wat?
---
Nice vid :)
---
The good ole whiteknuckle waro to the gate
---
We had both a Stuka fleet and a Raven fleet on grid. Raven doctrine was specifically designed to deal with supercaps. 
---
Yeah you cracked the case, we are blue with the alliances some of our members rent from. We're affiliated in that way. Now what the fuck does that have to do with anything, since the context of my original comment was that it's pants on head stupid to lump is in with northern alliances in wars? How does your point add to that discussion in any way? What is your point, while we're at it?
---
Right. Alphas in level 4s (and 5s, lol) is what will reinvigorate the pcu. How has no one else realized this but the OP?!
---
Ping!
---
Boring
---
Yeah, what'd they expect when they tackle another coalitions mining rorq? Just want to farm ships that arent able to fight back. Then try to run with their kitey bullshit when the bigboi's show up.
---
Its like walking into another man's home and punching his kid and then asking for a fistfight and being mad when the dad pulls a gun on you.
---

---
Ok, i think thats enough spodbrain themed comments for this thread. It was fun role playing a nullbear, but now i feel dirty.
---
Already posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ayp9fy/march_patch_notes_released/
---
How many dread fleets have we whelped? 
---
Ok.
---
Typically, if you join up with a good crew, about a month till you do OK and think you know what you're doing. Solo? Longer.
---
Thanks! I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
---
Lol. Next month the north will be reeeeeeing all over reddit how the imperium is destroying the game when they are stomping you again. But its ok shitpost while you can. Darkness and GOTG are saving you a spot in the trash of history.
---
Yeah that's a fair point. They should just not make any models for 5 years while they think about it.
---
One of the nice thing about eve (and one of the frustrating one) is that everything is a giant game of rock-paper-scissors.
---
So alpha with the right counter comes out on top. Now it will take a little while to get to the point where you can do that, you start with nothing and need to train up for a bit to be good at anything. The advantage of omega in the beginning is that they train faster.
---
Anyone have a link to any premium highsec Merc tears?
---
I enjoyed all 7 pixels of that
---
tfw you unironically badpost to reply to a shitpost lol you absolute lemon.
---
CCP has been awful at merchandising since Day 1.  They have this crazy high bar for how good they want everything to look, on the one hand this is good because High Quality = Good, on the other hand nobody wants to be spending $1800 on a fucking floating nyx toy that never actually materialises because your standards are SO high one of the largest major manufacturers of nerd pop culture toys says "nah, not profitable" and stops making it.
---
great job dealing with supercaps btw
---
I'm not the one who paid for a game that doesn't exist, that would be you. 
---
That's the drive I've been doing for most of the past six years.
---
You are retarded.

Mensch = human, i dont get it. Wasn't he a human before that as well? 
---
Im a complete orange
---
Mensch is a yiddish term. It is an honorific. It means he is an exemplary human.
---
I like the model, but for the love of god why re-design?  Why not touch up ships while retaining their distinctive designs that players have grown attached to?  The stiletto and gila are examples of re-designs gone bad.  I loved the "hornet" look of the slasher.  Now it's just a hecate with extra wings and a part that isn't wings.  The Gila was the ugliest ship in eve.  Now it's the most boring.  Is that really an improvement?
---
IIRC there's at least one CCP dev who's spent his free time maintaining Eve on linux for years
---
I’ve wanted a Gurista jacket, a mug, and a nice apoc model for a long long while. 
---
They store has SO MANY great products that they just....don’t sell, or never made much of. It’s practically a concept showroom of things you want but can’t buy. 
---
I’m almost certain it’s purposeful ignorance at how poorly the merch side of EVE is done. It’s like the person hired for it never wanted to. 
---
Or [them](https://twitter.com/KISAKI_Studio1)
---
Yeah still waiting for the Adobe suite. But I've been using figma for vector art these days. I like it a lot more and gets the job done! 
---
Yeah, ironically I couldn't get that to work at all, it worked in 18.04 but not this time around I guess. I decided to try Steam again and to my luck, it worked! 
---
When you're first playing eve, you do not need Omega status.  Play for awhile, and consider it once you start running into walls.
---
Look Ma Im on TV

I haven't even gotten an answer on my bug report yet. :(
---
(If you switch between orbit and tactical camera while deploying a structure the two are fucked up afterwards with the distance lines going into the orbit camera instead of tactical.)
---
change 1. HAHAHAHAH no.
---
change 2. and why dont we make hurricanes only use artillery. no auto cannons.   no.   dude it doesn't solve anything but make people have to buy extra hulls where currently they can just refit the current.   balance is done through ship bonuses.
---
change 3. "carriers can be used for long range disposal fo faxes and dreads"  except thats the role of dreads with long range guns.    carriers are anti subcap capitals.  
---
change 4. hahahahha.  oh i can see it now. a nyx tackled by a bunch of frigates it can't target. and so it has to sit there instead of fighting back.   why don't we also limit stealth bombers to only shooting battleships and up.  totally wouldnt ruin the ship.
---
change 5. again, your removign their ability to fight back at all.  no.
---
seirously these are some fo the worst proposed changes i've read. AND I'VE READ PLENTY OF CRAP IDEAS.
---
so take your golden poop award. fresh from EA.
---
This brought a tear to my eye.
---
Retards spamming stupid ideas like this is what gave us the situation we're in today.

From laughter.

So price the item appropriately and toss in plex as a loss leader
---
My frigate was killed by other ships that are bigger.
---
CCP nerf bigger ships please.
---
calling them faggots for using booshfleets is white knighting?
---
To be fair, speaking from experience, there is a lot of LGBT bashing from a lot of different groups in eve. Most people aren't aware of it, bc it doesn't affect them, or gets blown off as us being too thin-skinned if we try to talk about it, but it's out there.
---
Imagine your OS spied on you to deliver ads.
---
With the 3d printing technology they could do it all in house as well.
---
Atm best LP is Amarr. The zone is nice and pretty active: you got fights all the day solo and small gang from mil and neutrals roaming for some fun.

There is some tryhard with pimped t2/faction like did he say jump or the russians from smile&amp;wave but it's bearable.

Thanks for the discussion input!

Many thanks!

Encourage them to offer ship models! The fan base is hungry!!!
---
Linux becoming a viable alternative for gaming is something I would be glad about, just because you don't care doesn't mean you need to shit over other people's interests
---
Well I can assure you our group will have no part in that. 
---
On the other side of the coin I dont think using the LGBTQ comuity as a recruitment tool is a very classy thing to do. 
---
Don't take the bait Brisc.
---
Yes, it's ridiculous. If you're firing someone for reasons other than performance 2 weeks isn't nearly enough time. And if you've failed at managing the company to the point where you need surprise layoffs  then you should be getting the boot too.
---
Thank you for the kind words. 
---
It is a bit pathetic. But we are taking it in stride and just taking the opportunity to clear the story a bit :) 
---
Thank, can you give me some system name ?
---
Well it can be worth that 700mil + tools/wheels. But i do not recommend it without t2 hack modules.
---
I tried EVE on Ubuntu with Proton the same as you, it worked pretty much as well as it does on Windows but I had a lot of issues with flickering graphics (especially around the HUD), I tried turning off post-processing etc. but it still didn't work. Have you had any issues like that?
---
Other than that Proton helping Linux gaming look like less of a pipe dream is really quite cool; if my laptop had proper support for Linux drivers I would definitely make a move.
---
Talking about artificial numbers boost.
---
Ok, let's take this from the top, and you're right, some of what I said wasn't clear.
---
    Wow. You are thick.
---
This is ad hominem (lit. to the man)
---
    Good to know you’re considerate enough to not wear your own colours to spew low value diatribe.
---
This is a backhanded compliment, to insult an action 'low value diatribe'. The difference is that one is an attack at the person, and the other at the person's actions. I haven't made any comment about your character, only your actions. Though I accept it is common to interpret criticism of one's actions with that of one's character, they are distinct. I accept that the comment was trite, but being unimaginative doesn't detract from its validity. That said, I don't understand how it was disingenuous.
---
Let me make one thing explicit before I continue. I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of The Initiative, Goonswarm Federation, or in fact any large political block, barring a brief stint when R0NIN were invited to come play in the big war against Band of Brothers back in 2008 or so. I attempted to correct your assumption but was evidently unclear.
---
In that light, this comment is irrelevant, and unnecessarily insulting to Pandoralica, someone who I have never interacted with personally, but who I can respect for putting in the effort to take on a leadership role (as I would anyone in a similar position).
---
    I’m sure Pando is definitely pinging for whaling fleets without caring about strategic or tactical objectives. This is a very believable statement.
---
I'm going to quote you here:
---
    Whaling fleets aren’t about “having fun” first. This deployment wasn’t about “having fun” for either side. Yes, it’s a game so some level of fun is required but ultimately that’s a side effect.
---
How exactly is a reader supposed to interpret this other than that you view fun as playing second fiddle _in a game_ !?
---
    Hi, you are Goons...
---
Irrelevant, I'm not.
---
    If you want someone who does try and avoid burning out content, you would look at Horde with its strict policies on not dropping in Geminate on content providers.
---
Horde have acted on the knowledge that it takes two to tango, and it makes them thought fondly of by many groups who roam into their space. One of the few areas (my personal opinion now) left where it is possible to get something that is near the healthy middle between super/titan turbo-blob and unchallenging gank.
---
    I feel like your biases here are blinding you to the fact that it’s your side of the table that has by and large created the situation we are in currently that you seem to dislike.
---
Again, not my side, I'm not even at this metaphorical table. 
---
    I’m not here to “rile” you up. Not here to rile anyone up. Most people here come pre-riled. As I said, flairbaiting is a fantastic way to figure out who’s actually reading and who’s arguing or agreeing based on flair. On both sides.
---
I was unclear here, I meant that you seemed to be riled up: my first comment said 500 dudes getting to shoot at _something_ was a good thing, and wondered (tongue in cheek) if more fun for more dudes was available fielding a similar comp (t1 BS + Boosher). You lead with:
---
    That sounds like worse cancer than fucking whaling with boosh ravens.
---
Then followed up to a mild comment effectively 'to each their own' with:
---
    Wow. You are thick. 
---
Not unreasonable to think you were riled up about something with those two comments together.
---
    Maybe next time go for being more consistent in how you treat people regardless of their flair, and judge people based on what they actually write. We can all be better, together. Still human, still EVE players.
---
These are good words, but I would ask you to reflect on them yourself. I have no flair, no is there any good reason beyond your own biases to assume I belong to either of the sides involved.
---
Have a great weekend, filled with many or few explosions, as your predilection favours :)
---
Aset, Kamela, Kourmonen, Sifilar... Open world map and search for ships destroyed last hour, you'll have a nice overview of active systems/constellation!

i appreciate the guy that popped my thrasher as i was running a ded site. it was maybe the 5th or 6th fight ive had, and he was able to get stupid close, used a tracking disruptor and wore me down.

i went back in a rifter, cleared the site, looted a faction AB ran the 2nd that was in the system and still came out way ahead.

then took a hauler loaded with a mining barge and exploration frig to another system, and proceeded to loose the mining barge to a FOB blob at an asteroid belt and broke even for the night

Okay so here I either got downvoted for not joking (which means I also got downvoted for saying I loved the vids), or I got downvoted for joking (because he clearly has one logi).

 Three parent comments in 13 hours - r /eve is way more active than that. Seems to me Lucy is peddling downvotes on a discord server or something. I don't think you fit the role of a frail youtube ego mushina my brudda
---
Didn't notice anything wrong but adding in the max distance some of the more powerful ships can engage at and the optimal speed and range to get under BS guns would be a great addition. Otherwise awesome cheat sheet!
---
Try running low tier abyssal sites. It's fun and challenging if you run it as an alpha.
---
and dev's listening to them.
---
That actually would be awesome
---
I'm glad youre reaching out to clear things up. Hey, maybe youll get some genuine recruits out of this too! 
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
Guard was one of the stalwarts. 
---
not gonna lie this is some pretty quality trolling
---
It's more so how easy and fast you can deploy capitals straight onto the field and continually reinforce them with more capitals. Cynos need a change, they've been pretty much the same forever.
---
It would be a great partner had the shipping cost reasonable amounts. But when I need to pay the value of an item almost to get it shipped here in Western Europe, that is a bummer. 
---
What kind of DPS can abyssal sites put out? Mostly asking about T1-3
---
Stunt double for Peter Dinklage. 
---
^^^^jk ^^^^ilu ^^^^guard
---
Suppose we can spam PA about it. Maybe the Koreans knock sense into CCP
---
What graphics driver are you using and on what video card? 
---
I'm using a Nvidia card with the proprietary 390 drivers and at least in station everything was solid. I remember that happening for me in 18.04 and I ungraded my drives to 410. So see of there's some proprietary drivers for your video card instead of nouveau drivers.
---
Yup, that's the one! 
---
Level 4s might not be the best content out there but it's nevertheless used a lot, especially by alphas as it is basically the only low risk/low effort PVE income source for them.

---
This works for normal Ubuntu as well.  Step 4 needs to be changed soon.
---
This is accurate, I was Eve Vegas that year and my buddy and I walked home each with an Apoc and Tempest.  We got the Tempests with our tickets and on the final day as you said we’re able to go get the Apocs.
---
There were a FEW Megan’s given out that year too at Eve Vegas and I attempted to trade both mine for a guy that had a Mega, he wisely said no.  
---
But I still have them both sitting in either side of my gaming rig.
---
since it seems your unfamiliar with capitals. let me explain a bit.
---
HAW dreads use battleship sized guns, good for anti subcap(kinda..if they get webbed down. if a battleship can hit it, then a haw can)
---
and capital gun dreads use one of 2 types of guns.
---
clsoe range, high dps.  but sucks applying to anyhting that isn't a capital
---
long range, eh dps, usually high alpha 50% of the time,  good for capitals or battleships at ranges beyond 150km.
---
carriers have the same dmg as haw dreads, but apply better.  they are also alot less tanky, but can be repped due to no siege mode.
---
suepr carriers have carrier fighters, as well as heavy fighters,  heavy fighters suck applying to non capitals.   but give super carriers their dps.   they also got long range heavy fighters with less dps,  but good at applying to subcaps.
---
congratz, now all your ideas are shown to be worthless.
---
Just pretend it's one of those phishing bait emails your IT sends you every once and a while
---
It's not commone sense at all. Simply because the main goal of creating alpha accounts was not to be merely trial accounts. It's a wide misconception amongst Eve players.
---
Give arguments pls.
---
Well, I'm glad for the interest in the topic at least. What would be your proposal?
---
I used Nvidia drivers too, but I was using the 18.04 LTS so I guess that could have been why. 
---
My laptop is MSI and they aren't really known for their support of Linux. I use it for productivity as well as gaming and Nvidia's Optimus technology (which automatically switches to the low-powered Intel card) doesn't really work in Linux meaning it burns through laptop power in like 45 minutes. Maybe I'll try again when I can be bothered
---
&gt;hahahahha.  oh i can see it now. a nyx tackled by a bunch of frigates it can't target. and so it has to sit there instead of fighting back. 
---
Like a Battleship being tackled by frigs would be? But more so, because of how massive it is?
---
Ahhhh yeah mobile chips have always been a problem for me. Going to try 18.10 on my laptop and see of that helps. They're boasting a lot more laptop support in 18.10. 
---
You obviously have zero clue how player psychology works. You should really watch one of the Fanfest presentations about the New Player Experience. CCP research has found out again and again that the average new player simply does not join a nullsec alliance in his first week.
---
Natural player progression typically flows from solo PVE to coop to PVP. You simply can't force the average new player in a high risk PVP environment from the get go.
---
Hint check capital skillbook sales pre and after injector introduction
---
Probably only corps like wingspan or other nomadic wormholers can get away with not having structures
---
You're stuck in the past. Gaming has considerably changed in the last two decades but you're just too blind to see it. If CCP had stuck to their old trial model they would have been bankrupt by now.
---
Money
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about shipping. Shipping from the EVE store has never not been nightmare fuel.
---
battleship has drone bays, usually large bays. and so can send them out to kill the frig
---
they also have webs or grapples to slow the frig to hit it with main guns.
---
nyx....has no guns.  it has no drones.  it only has fighters.
---
and carriers usually dont have webs considering they long range.
---
im going to buy all kinds of junk food and gonna munch on it while solo pvp in lowsec tonite, and im excited about it
---
sad to hear guard leave but happy that he is finding new adventure
---
also got my friend to try eve and spent an hour just giving him advice, i hope he likes the game 
---
This the one you couldn't get working since 2015? :P
---
The problem is that CCP doesn't want to spend their time on this and nobody else is technically allowed to (for copyright reasons).
---
There's no reason why you can't ping someone who posts 3D ship printings on Reddit, though, and make a private arrangement.
---
Got that going a while ago this is another ;) 
---
Yep, I have a Tempest and an Apoc myself by the same arrangement. I didn't see any Megas there.
---
Thanks man, super appreciate it!
---
i have played eve with all sorts of players and never have i thought... this group of players need  a special corp and group and need to focus on promoting their identity instead of playing the game like everyone else.
---
I had to go buy a duffel bag to fly them both home!  
---
or smeling
---
I just don't see a point to it if they can still par take in incursions and abyss sites which make exorbitant amounts more than even marauder l4s ffs.. Like l4s are so bad they honestly should be removed and lp stores redesigned but I know thats never gunna happen.
---
The problem with Eve it that its anything but a proper F2P game. In a proper F2P game players simply don't feel handicapped for not paying and player progression is available to everybody.
---
For anybody that is used to F2P games getting into Eve is just a horrible F2P experience.
---
K
---
&gt;As part of the fight against botting and RMT, this release also places all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have an Omega state account. 
---
Oh well, I just realized I was a better. L4 distribution missions was the only thing I've been doing for a while, while I chat with my corp and have the game open at my work. 
---
The atron is the ship I learnt to PVP in and I think that, if you have gunnery skills trainer or just like turrets more than missiles, it is the best ship to fly as a beginner. Hull bonuses are for damage and falloff which means you hit hard for a tackler frigate and the falloff bonus gives you unmatched versatility. Your plan is to orbit laser, missile and rail/howitzer boats and scram kite blaster boats. And on top of that you are fast enough to do so. Another plus is that you have really high scan res so catching kiters punching into you is easier than in an incursus or Tristan. The downsides are that you are paper and you need capacitor to function. So it's not suprise that ships with really high dps, really hard tank or drones that don't care for your speed are your hardest fights. Tristans, breachers and tormentors are the t1 frigs I'd fight the least initially while you learn. Load null s always when punching into a plex and go welp some ships. 
---
What did CCP Guard contribute to EVE other than being a goofy character for videos? You guys are sheep. Who cares if he moves on?
---
Ofc
---
&gt;CHANGE 1 - Faxes can only target subcapital ships.
---
This is actually The Big One - much bigger than change 4 or 5. Supers/titans are already mainly used as a bulwark against other supers/titans. This is because they're invincible to any non-supercap fleet; no amount of dreads will beat 500 titans with proper fax backup. Consequentially, all null alliances are constantly hammering out new supers/titans in an arms race to keep ahead of their opponents. 
---
This would allow dreads to counter supers/titans, which is a profound shift in the current titan-or-gtfo meta. 
---
Changes 4 and 5 are still probably worth considering (since when supers/titans go up against subs it's usually in content-denial dunks that aren't great for the game), although I'd rather just strip titan haw guns and nerf heavy fighter application, instead of passing hard rules on what you are and are not "allowed" to shoot. 
---
Look for v2
---
There's two ways. Either find something high volume which can be made profitably, or find something low volume with a big margin that can make you profitable even if you only make a few.
---
my favorite t1 fit is the autocannon punisher, but you can do the same thing with a blaster punisher. 400mm armor plate, small repper, and a mwd with a scram. its a tanky little brawler that costs about 8m a pop
---
This dude does such good work. That light up abaddon is gorgeous. I wonder if he'll ever put rainbow LEDs in there...but at the same time, perfection shouldn't exist like that
---
All the above doesnt even mention the fact that you have to be a certified smoothbrain or incredibly unlucky to ever get caught in one.

I'll contact you for sure.
---
Whatever happened to Ev0ke anyway?

I know they collapsed at some point but where did all the Germans go?
---
Interestingly, I couldn't get the "Linux launcher" to work but it works great using just Wine. I might give the Steam method a try to see if performance improves with Proton.

Most people who play EVE and who have ever played EVE are high-sec, so it makes sense.

dual prop scram web maybe? 
---
My proposal would be for you to stop posting.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Ubuntu and windows are both guilty of that
---

---
I haven't used ubuntu in years, but most distros don't do anything like that.
---
yayyyyymy.....hail to ccp trump
---
I've flown them, I own them. 
---
Capitals should require support ships, they should not dominate everything themselves. 
---
Out of interest, what do you see as a proposal to the current issues?
---
Or are you happy having the only answer to supers and titans being a larger amount of supers and titans?
---
CCP should add a module that directly links your ships HP to your credit card so that whenever you take damage, instead of deducting it from your shields, it's deducted from your mom's credit card
---
current issues?  rorqs, industrial.
---
right now they to easy to make, maybe get some rarer materials than just ores.
---
outside of that, its mostly sov issues and citadels making it to easy to store them protect them, and then only deploy them in mass numbers.
---
removing HAW from titans is fine, but not making them unable to shoot small shit.
---
dreads could actually use a buff, cosnidering they are a joke for "siege ships" vs citadels.   maybe let fax rep them so they can survive a fight with titans that have fax of their own.
---
heck, titan siege mode is an option. not ideal.  but its there
---
Damn,  they actually are starting to fix Wardecs?  That required structure change is a great change.
---
there's a lot of bashing of everyone. that's equality

Actual Youtube Description:    
---
Storytime:  French comrade and I decided to move some spare Carriers up to North to just blap some VNI Botters or people that come across.  He had 2 Carriers, I had one Nid. We didnt really wanna win isk-war or shit like that. Just wrecking some bigger toys to get into solo/ duo pvp and have fun in first line. After the first carrier was already wrecked by RR Titans (good fight, guys, btw!), we had 2 more Carriers to get blown up in so we looked around all of Tenal, Branch, Venal etc.  The problem about the regions: They might be owned by NC. or PL but we didnt see a single target for hours. I wonder if they reacted to us if we took their sov -.-.  Whatever. After a lot of traveling and losing more and more fuel from jumping, we finally found a neat place for us. ... Was about damn time, because at this time, we had beend up in the North for over a week, hunting fuckers. GG to Syberian Squad for the WelpHelp. Next time, prepare your anus :)

Is CCP Chair still employed there?

Rebalance capital sig radius and capital gun tracking.  Delete HAW guns.
---
No idea, but if it looks really good, maybe CCP will give a pass?
---
Um, can you go into more detail as to who decides on skins? Where did you find that out? 
---
&gt;They might be owned by NC. or PL but we didnt see a single target for hours  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;hmmm did u look in delve /fountaine?might find something there
---
fun for INIT. though
---
It's the inability to counter-drop on them that makes them so stupid. Jump ranges and fatigue destroyed a huge amount of small game potential by allowing people to act with virtual impunity under their own capital umbrella. SP largely doesn't matter, because even without injectors people will train what it the most OP thing regardless.
---
while its good you took time to post your thoughts, these honestly are some really dumb suggestions (like worse than pgl bad) i told the csm how they can balance capitals to make them at least better until we get another capital rework (probably 3-4 years) but who knows. ccp is more focused on other areas of the game atm and they are doing a pretty good job (npe and wardecs)

When you submit the image you give CCP the rights for it, so it becomes their asset anyway.

lmao I remember resnar, he joined our wh corp, tried to dual box a nightmare and tengu for some pve and lost the tengu, then smartbombed his own blingy pod with the nightmare. Then promptly rage quit and joined goons 
---
Its injectors.....that leads to rorquals that leads to infinite caps.
---
To be honest, if the game sucked less there would be fights like this all the time and we would actually get tired of seeing them on the front page just like we got tired of seeing every botting nyx and 2x rorqual kill reports.

&gt; But they have like 90km range with RLMLs.

I'm sure if bounty hunting ever got revamped, CCP would ensure feature parity for you with a "Get Wrecked" notification option. They may even include a handy button to quick-send your choice of insult via evemail when you read the notification.
---
I lived, so op success. 
---
You got really salty after you rage quit. 
---
Wew nice blob. Make abaddons great again. 
---
oof
---
I think allowing sieged dreads to receive Fax reps could be a good option, and could make them a bit more viable than currently. 
---
But in my view the issue is that carriers, supers and titans all do much the same job currently; they all have increasingly more tank, they can all apply to pretty much any other ship in the game without issue. Example below:
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75062996/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75062996/)
---
My idea is to split them into subcap support/killing capitals, and hunter-killer capitals to kill these. It increases fight complexity, it changes the stale meta of "most titans wins". 
---
IF we bring back Kugu i am bringing back my triple tanked jihad scorpions.
---
Baiting small gang and dropping cap on them is fun as fuck, no need cta. Helping friends that are tackled too. Really more fun than 10% tidi and mass bug.
---
Offhand do you recall what a 5 gecko carrier tick was?
---
did i rage quit?
---
I don't believe I was implying anything with my comment? I merely stated that my interest in the game had been lost, specifically because I began to believe that the development process was plagued with bad management and a finished product was becoming increasingly unlikely with each passing day.

Sorry if you're troubled by what I said, it's clear you've invested a lot into this game and for your sake I hope you get a finished product.

It could. Not in all cases for every Wanted individual, naturally, but bounty payout can be increased far above current amounts.
---
Nice job you managed to blob horde
---
Meta gun Abaddons is such a dogshit comp lmao. Can someone let whoever was FCing horde that their comp is completely useless, but even more useless without triage?
---
I’ll upvote. That’s how I felt after reading the post. EVE has always worked great with wine, minus a few hiccups. So naturally, you should expect it to run on proton also. 
---
HS ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
---
Putting a fixed bounty on someone's head is kinda meaningless when the target is immortal. 
---
At this point it'd probably be a better system if they made it so you could place fixed bounties on individual structures to encourage people to try and destroy them for a decent payout.
---
as soon as bounty hunting gets viable, it will get abused.
---
so the only way to make bountys viable is by removing them completely
---
oh! great

The problem is that a straight person for example would typically not join an LGBT based community.
---
It is not that VO is against the LGBT community obviously, it is more so the effort of the individual that set this up and utilized the threat of shortining VOs recruiting demographics down to only LGBT people by creating a site that would discourage people who are not LGBT from joining.
---
I am trans and wouldn't want to be in an LGBT community. I would rather just be in a standard community.
---
So why wouldn't a straight person want to also be in just a standard community.
---
The goal is obviously just to exploit a community in order to destroy a recruiting demographic and hopefully harm the organization as a whole, which the goal is explicitly stated through sarcasm and direct statements in the mail that was linked.

I enjoy his sense of humor.

Make the bounty remove skill points from Target on pod death
---
You pay million isk per 1000 SP or whatever you need to balance it and when that person gets podded they lose that much SP
---
Ppl won't cheat and kill themselves for it, who wants to lose so :) and the person who paid it gets to know they annoyed the person 
---
Skill loss.   X skillpoints per 1 million isk bounty.  Bounty Hunter gets the isk, Bountee gets real loss/consequences, Bounty Placer gets good return on investment.  Put a cap on the amount of skillpoints that can be lost, a percentage of total skillpoints.  
---
Yeah, like the phishing emails your IT sends you every once and a while
---
Make sure you do haha
---
Smug posting a low tier BR on reddit........shock
---
See, I thought this at first too. But then bounties in real life weren't *only* paid for death. They're paid for things such as the capture *or* killing of the Wanted, which can more broadly be termed as majorly inconveniencing them. 
---
Eve can do the same, by allowing bounties, on claim, to cause inconvenience to the Wanted. For example, an inability to fly anything above a T1 frigate until the Wanted pays back the value (or more) of the bounty that was paid out on them. Such an inconvenience would set the pilot back more than just losing their ship, and ensures bounty isn't ISK positive for suicide (unless you burn the character in the process). If the bounty paid remains tied to the amount destroyed (eg the value of the ship) then the bounty system can't be used be the rich to permanently lock the poor out of content as the amount they'd have to pay back would be capped relative to how much they already are flying.
---
In before Guard gets into music
---
That sounds pretty great! Any idea what the timeline on either of those two things would be, friend?
---
Yeah but typing out the word 'homo' is easier. checkmate
---
Only when bounty payout can ever be isk-positive for suicide. It is possible to prevent this (with the exception of burner characters) by limiting the character's ability to act without first paying the bounty office back the amount of bounty paid out on them. Such limits could be restricting the character to only flying t1 frigates until paid off. 
---
make putting a bounty on someone disable their ability to launch fighters or excavators
---
boom viable
---
PGL is a master baiter
---
I wish people would just realize how complicated this problem actually is and how it's really above most random player's expertise. 
---
Barring Eve shutting down, we would hit this point eventually even without rorqs and injectors. Sure, injectors + rorqs made it come way faster, but the reality is that CCP should have been aware that in a true sandbox game, the natural progression is always getting more. To drive this point home, a little before injectors became a thing, so many people were opening up character farms in the bazaar selling ishtar, mining, and capital alts by the 10s and 20s.
---
With that said, there's nothing inherently wrong with that, the same way there's nothing wrong with someone having like 20 rorquals today. CCP should have just been ready for this at all times and just make exponential expansion less effective (somehow).
---
In the big picture, the game has come very far. 10-12 years ago, people would drool over the idea of super umbrellas that protect ratters and miners today, or how easy it actually is to get into a cap.
---
 (◕‿◕✿) 
---
I'm not sure a bounty should disable features of a character *before* it's claimed. This would just allow a fleet to place bounties on their enemies at the start of a fight, instantly defanging every carrier.
---
It looks that way at first, But it is a bit deeper than that and can really be used effectively as a smear campaign if not managed.   
---
But I mean the publicity is not bad. 
---
im more of a cap battery kinda guy, but your idea sounds better for FW.
---
but i hate not having dual prop. the GFTO ability is too good
---
if EVE had a system where you had old hulls still use the old model and just be redesignated "chimera mk.1" (or whatever ship really) id love that, it would make perfect sense aswell, since IRL your mk.1 plane/tank/meatbag wont be a mk.2 unless you replace it w/ one or retrofit it 
---
are you saying I can pay money to prevent people from flying spaceships? 
---
the amout of money id pay for classic eve... 
---
Didnt want that market anyways 
---
Wish I knew where to buy those. 
---
Not gonna lie, that website is dope and you should definitely steal the source.

Only time I get flickering like that using proton/steam is if I try to run the in-game fps counter. Other than that it is smooth as can be.
---
Yup, because ccp will own the logo for legal reasons, so you can use any of their art/assets in it as you please.
---
If they let themselves get blown up *and* don't pay their fine as a result, yes.

Did you really just post "these ideas are dumb because they aren't mine"?

Stead yo probably

---
The bounty payout should be the value of a ship minus insurance.
---
That sounds... awful
---
dunno bud you might be thinking of someone else
---
You will be lost
---
You will be ganked
---
But when you join a corp that suits you:
---
You will be home
---
You will gank others
---
Its a game which will throw you in the deep end, its free to play as an alpha so try it out, get your feet wet and always double check prices. And dont buy from jita local chat.
---
that's just not true at all lol
---
But only sell it once a year on Black Friday
---
It's currently less than that due to other payout factors, such as faction warfare LP.
---
Why?
---
Absolutely no idea. I would bet one or two week for the minutes, and a soli dmonth+ for a blog post or Sisi update for the first changes.
---
Am I missing something?  Nowhere in your supplied image mentions mining, a megathron, or losing a ship.  Maybe this person just doesn't like the game?  Is that allowed?
---
B R E A C H E R
---
Look up Solomon Phi breacher on youtube. Dual tanked lowsec breacher is sweet in novice plexes
---
so if im to understand this.. 
---
1. i get a bounty on me
---
2. i get blown up, person who blew me up get ISK
---
3. i am then restricted to flying a T1 frig untill i pay the bounty office what the guy who blew me up got paid for blowing me up.
---
was this correct? and if it is.. just no.. nonono.
---
Version 3 now contains some changes. Added Tangling Triglavian ship, removed some spelling errors and changed some other little things. Enjoy and let me know if you still want thing changed or added, i got many little ideas from other people and learned a lot about creating such cheat sheets!
---
**v3**  https://i.imgur.com/94CHsW2.jpg
---
waste of time. can't deal with abuse or perma-docked toons = DOA. 
---
That said, I'd add real shit. register for hunting a target for certain amount of time ala killright, tracking and notification system to allow hunter to find target across systems, temp docking and jump restriction when hunter and target are in same system, ability to scan down cloaked target, payout full bounty to killer(s), add significant rewards for a target killing hunters. 
---
Yes, and why not?
---
Note, the bounty payout in this case would still have to be tied, in some way, to the value of the ship lost to prevent stupidity like a 1b payout on a 2 week old player's catalyst. The fine paid by the Wanted party would ensure the bounty payout can actually be of real value, without means for suicide-profit, so the payout can be made as high or as low as is "fair". Fair as far as Eve is concerned, anyway.
---
The game is free, there's not really anything to lose by trying it.
---
You can fly solo and be successful, but entirely avoiding interaction with anyone else will be difficult and probably unfun.
---
Losing ships happens to everyone. The usual advice is to not fly something you can't afford to lose. 
---
It's an interesting thought. How would this avoid suicide-profit by those with a large bounty on their head? Would this killright allow for "legal" kills on players whose only failing was to get a bounty in the first place? 
---
Because more reasons to not undock is the exact opposite of what this game needs
---
Hehe yeee it is sooo good &gt;_&gt; dual prop has saved my ass too many times to deny
---
No AAR delete this post
---
It would also give more reasons *to* undock, through substantially higher reward for killing these bounty targets. 
---
Thank !
---
Try it for free... but man, it really sounds like this game is the opposite of what you want.
---
I get it though. I never liked joining clans/guilds/corps and never much cared for pvp in other games. I always wanted a good story line and didn't mind grinding on my own.  But I tried Eve and really got into it. It popped my cherry on joining a corp and playing as a team with (at first) mostly strangers. I can't imagine playing this game any other way.  So maybe you'll "grow" from getting into Eve? Or maybe its just not for you.  Either way it won't hurt to try.
---
You'll die once, find out it's not as bad as you were expecting, and learn to die well. Don't live in dread of it, but learn to adapt your playstyle to that reality ie) Don't Fly What You Can't Afford to Lose
---
my solo nullsec roams wouldnt work without them! they still dont, but they would better than they would without dual prop xD
---
Taking over for Alex Trebek obviously
---
Bounty assignment. I.e. You place the bounty on someone and assign it to (for example) a corporation.
---
The ISK gies into a pot. When they get the kill, they get the FULL value of the bounty. If they fail to get the kill within the allotted time, you get your ISK back.
---
This keep bounty hunting competitive, profitable for the hunters (since it brings back full-bounty payouts), and more or less completely prevents the current abuses of the system.
---
The design seems pretty obviously to me to be intended to be pushed into running multiples not running one or two but 3+ which means 3 mids would be enough if you all ran different ewars.
---
An interesting idea. I imagine the assigned corps would sign up to receive these bounties, and would likely be able to narrow down their regions of operation (eg don't give a bounty to a corp signed up for Black Rise when the character getting bountied is flying in Fountain). Does that sound right?
---
id like to note:
---
1) That azbel has 0 tax, meaning 0% profit. 
---
2) market orders keep getting changed, right now TTT is top again
---
im sorry, but if you cant see how bad a skill loss or a shiprestriction would be for eve. a game that already struggles with activity or content in general you either havent really played eve, dont really know how eve works or you are just plain stupid.
---
&gt; Natural player progression typically flows from solo PVE to coop to PVP.
---
the game's design flows this way, that doesn't make it the best way to go about things. 
---
&gt;You simply can't force the average new player in a high risk PVP environment from the get go.
---
It's safer to fly expensive pve ships in sovnull than in hisec.
---
Flying without you is more than i can bear.
---
&gt;I have some problems with games that rely mostly on emergent gameplay instead of having a story to follow; 
---
There are alot of "stories" in EvE, it's just that they are created by player interactions yet are still very personal.  Arguably this is why alot of players join the big null sec groups, it's easier to find a role in goons/TEST/Horde etc. 
---
Player driven Eve story arcs can take years to come round and you have no idea what the outcome will be. Take TEST/Brave vs PL as a stroy arc if you will, 
---
2013/14 - Test and brave get farmed by PL 
---
2015/16 - Test get evicted by PL and friends from vale
---
2018 - battle of UALX, test and brave defeat and hellcamp the entire PL super fleet for a week
---
For members of Brave and Test who were there for each of those moments thats a 4/5 year story arc.
---
What did we do?
---
It is pretty amazing i can't lie. 
---
it's free to log in, just play it or don't.
---
we're not that fussed either way.
---
I guess it's a structure bashing comp
---
Seems about right vOv
---
In reality, I expect if inplemented this would take the place of the old hisec wardec system. Groups like PIRAT and Marmite would probably accept them (or others would pop up). 
---
It also encourages mercs to leave Jita/Amarr for once 
---
This is the first big one.
---
He had me there. The first one is big one..and bad at that.. the rest are just..killing creative/fun ways to pvp
---
All propositions on the system should go through the question ´How do you avoid exploitation by the target?´
---
because that would still mean i have to pay double for losing my ship, first paying to replace it, and then pay to be able to fly it again.
---
since there are no restrctions in actually putting bounty, you can still do so much grief with this.
---
imagine im a "poor" HS miner, just chewing away on my rocks, someone place bounty on me, then they come suicide me, collecting the money they put on me, and making me pay double up to go back mining. this is not a good idea.
---
Trebek is contractually obligated to the show for another 3 years, so it can't be that. 
---
Yeah but it’s very “screamy” to stumble upon it on my feed.
---
Out of curiosity, how would this handle, say, putting a large bounty on a miner in high sec. Would you intend/expect this to lead to suicide ganking previous unprofitable ships, including ganking players who'd "done nothing wrong"?
---
Noice
---
I am fairly confident I can say without exaggeration that small gang was literally 500% more fun than it is today. 
---
How else to obtain easy karma on Reddit ???
---
Why take beam Abaddons vs Feroxes?
---
bounties for structures.  
---
that or specific ships, but honestly structures is just easier.  
---
What ? 
---
so the answer to a blob is to feed 8 billion isk?
---
looks like fun. imagine you could initiate fights like this on todays structures that replaced outposts
---
The story in EVE is what you make of it. It's a player driven sandbox.
---
You wanna be an explorer? Go exploring.
---
Want to be a pirate? Become a pirate.
---
PVP? Get out there and blow shit up.
---
You can do pretty much anything your heart desires that lies within the confines of the EVE universe and the game itself.
---
FFS it's a free game. If you're that scared of getting killed then don't bother. You'll do better in singleplayer games anyway.

Please read in full.
---
well you could be horde and team up with NC and PL to blob init with supers and titans and then post about that.
---
isnt this that weeb crap but in the style of eve online: the hit spaceship MMO of 2004?
---
ok cool just checking
---
Black Legion was literally part of their fleets Idgi
---
oh i liek this
---
From what has been said by TAPI keeping the market was never the point, denying horde their income was, and with an NPC station getting the majority of what was in that screenshot it seems to be working.
---
We we're? You'd think I'd remember that. You sure we weren't just third partying like we always do? We stayed the fuck out of that boring ass invasion
---
did the majority of the logi not make it onto the BR or did they really take buffer abaddons out with 1 guardian?
---
It's funny you call me a troll while defending one of the biggest scams ever perpetrated against the gaming community
---
What you've just posted is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever read. At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having read it.
---
yikes. if your looking for single player. EVE is the WORST game possible.  as EVE is majorly about connections.  
---
in eve, who you knows means everything.
---
who you know determines who will and wont try to gank you.
---
who will come save you
---
who will scout or provide intel fo ryou
---
and in terms of story, there IS NO story in EVE without others.  EVE's story is unique in gaming as its made by the players.
---
Empires of EVE documents the story of EVE's nullsec wars and powers. a great read. 
---
No you haven't, no you don't.
---
The only issue here is you're a poor who whelps to capitals all the time and you're salty about it. Move on. Nothing to see here.
---
I don't think interdiction nullification is entirely to blame, but it definitely is a major factor. I think consolidation of groups/alliance JF services and everyone and their dog having access to a Carrier (so moving ships by yourself is no big deal) also had a big impact.
---
New ship class attack battleships fits XL weapons (restricted from HAW's) 70/80k ehp 1.5ly jump range  7 (6 for caldari/min) highs 5 mids (4 for amarr) 5 lows (6 for amarr) mineral cost somewhere between a tier 2 and 3 bs

---
This is Eve Online, what did you expect to happen?
---
If we could do it without logging in again. 
---
Not sure Horde and Fear go together like that, those dudes literally exist to whelp themselves
---
At the very core, EVE is a multiplayer game.  Sure, you can experience some pretty cool parts solo but thats the tip of the iceberg.  The really awesome features rely on team play in some form or other.  
---
So, two choices:  a) walk away.  EVE may not be the game for you, just like Fortnite isn't for me.  b) sign up as alpha, go through the tutorials and goof around.  Be open to talk to people, be open to ask questions and listen to advice.  You'd be surprised just how nice and helpful people are in this game.  I came 9 years ago for industry and am staying because of people and PvP.  Just be open to change your mind.  
---
i am confident that you are thinking of someone else
---
i'm currently active, was in the fight, and have never rage quit eve or given stuff away when i took a break
---
but it could also be that you're stupid, so let's not rule anything out
---
Lol what
---
was that basic insurance? don't nids insure like 900M
---
this sub spends all day bitching about balance/meta problems but relentlessly hazes almost everyone who offers any kind of concrete solutions :/
---
It just depends. I'm not really interested in joining a group only bc they are lgbt friendly, that's only one part of who I am, afterall. I do like to know that people aren't going to be shitty to me if it comes up, and I'm not going to have to listen to a bunch of people bashing on comms. Probably the classiest way to lowkey say your people aren't going to be a bunch of biggoted fucksticks is to say something like you value diversity
---
as for losing ships. the first few hurt alot.
---
then you stop caring and accept it. you'll quickly realize ships come and go, but your skills remain
---
you should use your programming skills to make a robot help you catch up to all those mean veterans who have a 13 year head-start on you!
---
Its f2p man. There is zero downside in giving it a try. 
---
Minor spoiler: You will get addicted big time. Eve Online is the best PC - Game ever made. Period.
---
I keep looking over my shoulder, hoping to see you there.
---
I'd be 100% for it if Vulkan wasn't the usual Khronos shit.
---
You also don't need to run Win10 Home
---
 Play something else you won't regret passing up this game.
---
Who are you some hordeling who cares about kbstats? One dude hemorrhaged 12bil instead of a bunch of dudes losing like 50 mil after insurance 
---
&gt; as is snuff tradition the moment we start losing we're going to login 80 titans so be ready.
---
**** you
---
No and yes in that order
---
This would be nice to go through for the funsies but I don't want a refund :/
---
CIG has working chat
---
okay
---
Not without being exploited, where they just kill themselves with an alt.
---
So literally anything Bethesda?
---
You really think titans online is the best state for the game meta?
---
What best kills carriers or dreads? Titans
---
What best kills supers? Titans
---
What best kills a titan? More titans.
---
i think that we both agree that this market hub battle is the most uninteresting one for a long time
---
Plagiarizing an Ammar Propaganda song for Minmatar Propaganda, you will get shot by your own people.
---
oh no
---
it's retarded
---
Just kind of dissapointing really that the biggest forum community for Eve, and you can't get even a semblance of  discussion on the game.
---
Thank you for your excellent contribution.
---
Hi. I'm an original SC backer. I have precisely one fuck for when the game releases. I'm $35 in. I'm happier with SC's current status than certain "finished" Kickstarters that ultimately delivered trash.
---
You may find the downvote button to the left, thank you for reading.
---
Which ones kill creative ways to pvp?
---
What would you suggest for balance?
---
Thank you but I can promise you that my personal views towards the game the companies surrounding it were made based on my personal experiences with the company. You may still have hope that they can deliver a finished product but with an incredibly large budget, missing deadlines by an incredibly large margin with very little to show for it was more than enough for me to lose interest.
---
TL:DR Titans Online needs a reason to fly something other than a super or titan in large fights.
---
Suggestion - break capitals into subcap support capitals, and capital-killer capitals, stop the capital-killer capitals from being able to kill subcaps.
---
Oh shit, mining that involves actual gameplay and not just pressing F1? SC is doomed to fail I say
---
It was in Freelancer, an earlier game from the same guy.
---
I mean, give it a go, but if you don't want to play with other people and you will be scared to undock in case you get ganked, it's not sounding like the game for you.
---
Playing with others is fun though, you should try it.
---
Or just boost dread anti capital damage.... by a significant number
---
Recky runs a corp now? He used to work with my buddy, we actually helped him get into goons(bastion, I think) years ago. Neat.
---
How do people actually go about finding proper combat sites etc. in HiSec? I get that missions are a thing, where you can get proper combat and make some money, but I want to just fly around and do some random combat in sites, and I can almost only find sites with like 8 frigates and nothing else, even if I scan stuff down. Is that all there is, so I have do missions to find a bit better sites? 
---
I'm so confused, why didn't they just drop titans on that small gang getting in the way of their ratting?
---
Anything until FO76, natch
---
For sure it would :) I don't see it as a problem though, because those people are getting ganked already by CODE. for free.
---
lucky ! 
---
It's Falcon you replied to, not Guard. 
---
Not being fussed is not permitted on /r/Eve.
---
You didn't have problems with disconnects this time it seems.
---
&gt; The Rifter USB hub included with the EVE Collector's edition chose big and detailed.
---
Can confirm, kids have broken several antennas off. 
---
I really really really want one of each of the Amarr ship line, detailed, medium size. 
---
Dear god that Khanid Abaddon! I want!
---
pretty standard case of getting under guns tbh but exactly the kind of fun fight i look for when solo roaming in small T1 stuff. Battleship reinforcement made it extra fun to get away from alive. thanks for watching :)
---
Imagine blobbing someone that deploys to your backyard, i'm glad goons never drops supers when rorqs are tackled
---
what makes you think they're mutually exclusive?
---
Imagine when you're worse than a shit fc
---
I can't say for t1 or t2 but t3 put out in excess of 300. You can do the sites with less tank by kiting but it's dodgy. 
---
No
---
You're missing the point, what's the best way to go about in this game is irrelevant. It's about what players typically tend to do. 
---
I assume you're checking your anomalies window? Try to look in areas with lower security status, like a 0.5. Those tend to have better spawns. Also cross reference the site name with a resource like https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites to have a better idea of the relative site difficulty you're doing. 
---
&gt; getting in under the guns of a haw dread/titan is still possible
---
yes please keep closing into the haw dread yes :&gt;
---
Heh the funny thing was when I was chatting with Bliss about the upcoming deployment I was all stoked because it was a :Just Us: op. The reason being, I think that we, INIT. need a period of fighting what are inarguably stronger opponents. 
---
Inevitably, that means losing a lot of the fights we take on. From a materiel perspective, the losses we have incurred are trivial, and any sensible onlooker will recognise that, but there's a far greater danger to the (for want of a better term) moral fibre of a group when all you ever do is punch down. The last thing we want to do is become the Mk.II PL.
---
&gt; if you ran stuff that wasn't so frustrating to deal with, and if you did things other than tackle our rorquals, you might get a subcap fight. 
---
Noted. I flatly think you're talking bullshit, but noted.
---
Yeah we chose to deploy to Hakonen. Do you think that our FC team were unaware of the obvious response?
---
Incursions and abyssals should not be considered low risk/low effort. The game really need this kind PVE activity. Agreed though that missions need A LOT of improvement.
---
I'll take Copyright Protection for 500, Alex.
---
I think it might be interesting if NPC corporations could put a bounty on you if your standing with them gets too low. Not sure if that's actually a good idea.
---
&gt; (y'all were a bunch of cunts about it)
---
Come on, in hindsight you must admit it was pretty funny from our perspective that all Adversity ever tried were minor tweaks to your Mach+FAX doctrine
---
Contracts that can be fulfilled with killmails
---
That is because it was never designed to be F2P.  It should have never become F2P.  It should go back to the old model completely. 
---
You don't understand what a F2P model truly is.  When you figure it out, come back.  Until then, go back to Planetside lol.
---
How about making this a real career. The system would work like this 
---
Public info = full bounty for kill
---
Location in the past hour = half bounty for kill 
---
Current location = 10% of bounty for kill
---
Hunting: tracking on your own is incredibly rewarding, while paying for tips helps you get your man faster. Faction rep will get agents to "whisper" tips about your target. Some agents will take bribes like 2500 veldspar for target's ship fit. 
---
Style points: agents will provide missions for kills that reward style. "Kill x using an amarr cruiser" or maybe "use a warp scrambler on target x". 
---
Legal murder: bounty hunting is a concord sanctioned activity. You must have 2.0 sec status or higher to obtain/maintain your bounty hunting permit. Contracts are purchased from concord @ 15% total bounty and non-refundable. Contracts are exclusive to the purchaser for 1 week. Multiple contracts cannot be issued simultaneously for the same target. This creates a risk-reward for the hunter. 
---
Dead man's hand: catching up to a target hiding in a station allows the hunter to execute his target. Similar to being podded, the target will respawn at his medical clone.
---
Goonswarm can outform *every* alliance in Titans and supers, yet they still feel the need for a coalition. NCdot can outform every alliance that's not goonswarm and *they* still feel the need for a coalition.
---
When both goons and NCdot feel that the state of the game is such that they don't need a coalition any more, I'm prepared to listen to an argument that  INIT. dont either. Until then... 
---
Hey feyyd. Basic Insurance gives you 530m or something and cost me 55m. While everyone is screaming that dropping carriers on subcaps is dumb, the carrier only cost me 650m in Delve and the fit another 300m. So i "lost" only 470m. 
---
In terms of iskwar we actually won because we killed ships worth more than that since we were there. 
---
It's a MMO. Multiplayer. Not singleplayer.
---
Also, it's free, just try it, wuss.
---
Imagine loosing 600bil in dreads to a shit fc
---
He did not had enough money to buy the plat one, yes he suck.. like for example I had to do 20 jump twice to refuel him
---
Nc. And init have pretty similar numbers.
---
Imagine losing 600bill in dreads to a shit fc
---
Battleships can get over 1mill.
---
Who can?
---
Also, we generally keep an alt or two in the hole with a scanning ship incase we get locked out so that we dont lose access to our stuffs.
---
It looks like TEST ALLIANCE countered HORDE comp perfectly; https://zkillboard.com/kill/75593634/.
---
At least they got Valkorsia though, thanks PAN FAMILY for killing him.
---
I admit I haven't run the numbers anytime recently but I'm pretty sure they still have considerably more titans and supercapitals than we do.
---
At least Planetside 2 has a proper F2P model. Eve has not, but wouldn't know that as you are too ignorant to distinct trial from F2P.
---
Isk per LP might be best, but LP per site or kill is so much lower that you get more from the cheaper LP.
---
Wait, CCP Guard is gone?
---
It’s almost as if there are many other variants of Linux to choose from. Yes I know the post is about Ubuntu. But unlike Windows, you can choose and modify your system components freely, you can build the entire OS from scratch or use one of MANY premade variants, or some combination thereof. You can audit nearly every single part of your OS depending on the drivers you use. 
---
For those who truly care about privacy and security, Linux is the best option. If you care, but you aren’t skilled enough or need more industry support, you use MacOS. If you don’t care, or care less than you care about gaming, go windows. 
---
But don’t try to act as if Linux and Windows are on the same level privacy-wise because that’s blatantly false 
---
Going back to the old model would have been the end of Eve and CCP. In case you haven't noticed, the gaming market has changed considerably over the past decades. Subscription-only models are simply not sustainable anymore.
---
Capitals were introduced after 2011. I mean, that's the only logical conclusion I can come up with.
---
How do we buy these. I say that they had a Golem model.
---

No gods, no masters! Nothing more rebellious then turning oppressor propaganda back against them 😘
---
You didn’t read them. They said corps that were decd became inactive. They intentionally didn’t publish stats on quitting. Likely because last time they did that they found that getting ganked IMPROVED player retention. 
---
This great to hear.  If I could afford to resub,  I might actually come back and do my solo industry corp again.  
---
I’ll have to look more as the first one you mentioned.  I like mogul I think but it still doesn’t do exactly like the other thing I had did.
---

---
Whitesky is a RUS group. I think it's safe to say in the Russosphere 'gay' is a huge insult. 
---
Link that data please. Because they said that war decs decrease corp activity NOT hurt player retention. The last time they published something like that, they accidentally proved that getting ganked IMPROVED retention. Praise James! High sec is worth saving. 
---
ffufufufuffufufufufu xD
---
Lol XD
---
Actually, I can understand not liking that game. I started it and I really, really tried getting into it, but meh. Information overflow on the screen as a newbie. So I didn't touched my account for months.
---
Until a friend helped me a bit through the basics and explained me some things besides those tutorials. And he stills answers every stupid question I have. Having someone, who you can ask all the things, that are important but not really well explained in the tutorials, helps so much.
---
What 's the song that starts at 30 seconds? It sounds familiar, but I can't seem to place it.
---
After they lost Cloud Ring they tried some things in Syndicate and Low Sec, but this didn't worked out.
---
They did try to rebuild some point, but that didn't worked out and now they are all over the Eve... quite a lot joined Evictus. etc. 
---
It's a fucking boss at level 4 missions.
---
Blasters shoot null out to 60km but get on top of a group and you can do 1200dps.
---
Probably the 2nd best level 4 runner after the Vargur.
---
what do you know it is in Chinese.... who would have thought.... 
---
All I want is a bot that makes TL;DR's
---
I'd easily pay $25 for a small Hecate or Astero. 
---
Do you have a specific blaster fit I can take a look at?
---
In addition to /u/RotusMaximus's reply, your Legion had plate plus rep. The plate eats a huge amount of pg which means you can only fit stuff like rlml. Rlml isnt as good for ratting as ham because it has low sustained dps when you factor the reload in. Dual armor rep and ham is the way to go; if you're low on cap a cap battery can help.
---
Em/T is just your lowest resist. Sleepers hit for omni.
---
You might also want a neut to clear hostile tackle, and to reconsider your rigs.
---
flair checks out
---
&gt; i'm glad goons never drops supers when rorqs are tackled
---
They drop a dozen Titans instead.
---
The game should, but doesn't, push you into null. That is my point.
---
&gt;The last thing we want to do is become the Mk.II PL.

Andy Chee is botting, because he said he was botting.

Was it really fucking necessary for a dissertation on a bot?

Weird flex but ok

Put stupidly high bounties on known botters

dumb ass told our leaker literally EVERYTHING. when the leaker came to us the rest just wrote itself.

might have wanted to report this directly to security team, and at the very least maybe omit the way to laundry from reddit, just in case others  already doing the same now stop, and find another way?
---

he isnt a goon so why would he bot?
---
ha, made you use fuel on those jumps.
---
Imagine boasting on reddit about a 8b fight, in highsec, outblobbing newbeans, and being in tapi lmao
---
Dinoposter btw
---
Emailed the CCP security team before I posted it as always =)
---
Keep it up, my man
---
It is a trash way to launder and easily detected.  There are much better ways to go about it.  If anything him publicly showing it will let other retards use this way and get smacked for it later.  Don't doubt the CCP Security team that much where they can't notice some odd taxs transactions.
---
excellent, my point about the laundry still stands though.. wont help CCP much if everyone stops doing it you know ;)

I thought about it from both perspectives - I think that since CCP now knows about it they can ban anyone silly enough to do it that way (as /u/NotMyToonsName said. 
---
It could work in both directions. It's a gamble. 
---
Didn't mean to imply it was low risk low effort..just that its alpha friendly in the sense they can fly faction battleships n stuff I wouldn't be surprised if an alpha focused incursion community cropped up eventually if its not already under taken by one of the already established groups..

You dont really need the bling but the Hull is 1.4 billion so its worth blinging a bit. I'd reccomend using the Repper but the Magnetic field Stabs are unneeded. 
---
The damage control is really unneeded as well i just put that on at the start as a precaution. Swapped it out for a Tracking Enhancer.
---
I'm not convinced they've still perfected it.
---
fair enough.
---
Despite all the other comments I can tell you there are plenty of lone wolfs in the game, so you could totally play by yourself if you choose to. As far as having a goal to reach set one yourself. Do you wanna be an industry tycoon? A market trader perhaps? Maybe a solo pirate. Eve has many ventures you can get into and there's a place for everyone. 
---
This is already a well known method of laundering to CCP and easily noticeable at a glance when looking at transaction logs.  This is also fairly common method in HS trade hub laundering when you purchase ISK off of PlayerAuctions @Vulfstan ;)  
---
Is there a bug reporting place or a git repo to issue?
---
I'm not sure why your getting down votes, canonical has proven themselves to be a company that puts money before the users
---
Cyno green in Miro!!
---
i3
---
Surely this is what you've come to expect by now
---
1. The target needs to have destroyed something you, your corp or your alliance owns to be able to issue a bounty on him. No throwing bounties willynilly for no reason. You will have a window of 7 days on a loss-mail to create a bounty, and that will then have a set expiry as well.
---
2. It uses the contract system, but the bounty contracts can be issued to multiple people or corporations, so you can incite a first come first served mentality. You can also set the contract to be completely public, but the target would be able to shoot himself with an alt if the payout is worth it compared to ship required. I just think the option should be there cause why not.
---
3. New roles will be available for corps and alliances to issue bounty contracts.
---
3. The bounty works like a wardec just on a single person, except there is no 24 hour warning window. You will get a notification that someone activated a kill-right on you, and it's immediately game on. Anyone in a corp can browse the contracts given to it, and each person who wants to join in needs to individually accept it.
---
4. You can set a requirement on the contract to only pay out if the target flies a certain type of ship, or all of them including pod if you wish. You can also set how many kills you want the contract to be valid for, just to give people a reason to hound a target for a while.
---
5. When a bounty is created on you, you will know how much the payout is and who the issuer is, but not who the contract was given to. You only get to know your hunters when they accept the job. This means corps can be sneaky about their business to get you.
---
6. The payout will be split between everyone on the killmail, who also accepted the contract, depending on their damage done.
---
7. Question is, should the bounty target be able to create revenge contracts? :thinking:
---
Contracts for a corpse.
---
Then you weren't in BL at the time b/c I literally have BRs from us vs. BL as well as records showing BL was hired to protect so you're literally arguing a fake narrative at this point... but keep trying!
---
Would supercaps needing LP tokens from their respective faction ("license  to build"), combined with the blueprint work? Vanquishers already required faction-specific loot, why not all of them.
---
And for once I can say "I was there"
---
Amazing achievement, I'm glad to be with the SC
---
Excellent work.
---
LMAO WTF, 7bil flex?
---
While carrier ratting isn't done AFK, it is easily scripted / botted.
---
That's honestly incredible

pretty sure the gold magnate is worth more than 1 trillion without the mods.... since that was probably the only existing one

We will add a feedback button on the website in the next release for bug reports. For now you could send me a PM 😄
---
What we really need is to eliminate/change the mindless activity that is conventional ratting.
---
- As the latest reports show, the bounty faucet is out of control
---
- Ratting contributes nothing to the economy, unlike other isk making activities like manufacuring or trade. And at least mining, while also boring, is essential for the economic base.
---
- It's super easy for bots to do. 
---
- People rat for isk, but go ask the average line person whether they actively enjoy it.

Amazing job.

Your analogy of a modem day battleship against a Somalia pirate is.. lacking.  Like, not an insult.. just your awareness of their actual combat capabilities are wrong. The last decommissioned US battleship had dozens of 50 cal mounts and 5cm guns that could all track and destroy at lethal ranges of 500  to 5000 meters easily. They also mounted CWS, more than capable of destroying a local threat. Lastly, your Somalia pirate would have zero weapons capable of hurting the battleship.

Does this make the Tengu the best explorer?
---
And will she now visit all Abyss systems?
---
More like a mango.
---
True but considering there was only the single Loki for logi all they had to do was break its local tank. I believe there was something like 9 Cerbs in that fight. Even if they are only applying 150-200 DPS that still should have been way more than enough to break a locally ranked Loki. 
---
Simple, Have a vote where everyone gets to pick the 5-10 ships they want to see available and then the ones with most votes get made, simple.
---
This disrespect is why the minmatar are not one of the three powers in EVE and are only fit enough to serve the Amarrian Empire.
---
Pretty cool.
---
They were introduced in RMR in 2006. It used to be incredibly risky to drop caps on small groups without support, and they used to be rare. 
---
well  the wh we did find was worth  probably 2 or 3b because so much stacked  sites. c3 pulsar shattered.better than c2 shattered that had c3 anoms. 2 attles 10minutes,i double it and site ends within 5
---
Due to your complaining they reduced it to 400
---
why my post was deleted?  syndicate  null seems to be underrated. it need some love
---
I too can't read this within 2 minutes
---
Wow. Very very impressive. This is the kinda stuff that makes me want to come back... but then I remember that I have to pay if I want to use a clock lol
---
Were they heavy fit? Deserved then. Who the duck takes HMLs against a nano gang? 
---
well there was even iteron ganking whole megathron alive
---
I think you guys should just own it. Add it to your corp description, mention it in recruiting ads, etc. Turn it from a shitty smear campaign to another cool thing about Eve.
---
Incredible!
---
homos are gay doe
---
clip starts in the middle of the fight...
---
For every upvote on this thread, they'll reduce it by a further 50
---
Imagine complaining about bad posting on /r/eve
---
If you have that many characters you should really be running c4 or c5 sites
---
if the slashers would each fit a neut a web and a TD, the comet would eat dirt
---
CCP needs to send her a trophy for completing such an amazing feat.
---
Or you could join BRAVE. The OG newbro friendly corp. No Awoxing here...

$150+ isnt an unreasonable price to expect hard-core fans to pay for a model. $130 is a terrible price for shipping though. It doesnt really matter what the price point or quality is on your model when you have to pay that much for shipping.

https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/bots-are-threatening-eve-onlines-economy-and-players-are-fed-up/

Just a few of the bots I've caught.
---
you got to contact a diplo before you report a goon for boting so he is not a goon
---
Bump for CCP to fix bounty hunting... CCPlease
---
Gimmie! [https://i.redd.it/fr3p9ibg46l21.png](https://i.redd.it/fr3p9ibg46l21.png) \]: D
---
Easy fix for afk playstyle... make the rats aggro to highest threat and target the drones. 
---
Doesn't solve bots though.
---
They can then rescale the bounties down too. Hit the activity style where decisions are made... in the pocketbook.
---
 **Hallowed are the Ori.**
---
I am checking anomalies, yes. Maybe I'll just have to stay more consistently in 0.5 ish to get the better spawns. I am currently just travelling through some different systems in my Vexor, scanning down anomalies and doing the ones I can do (using the cross reference you mentioned), but is it possible it would for example be more efficient to get a proper scanning ship and scan down all sites faster in a handful systems, save all the locations, and then swap over to a combat ship to do the sites? 
---
o7
---
Meh 140 vs 30 who knew numbers win fights
---
What in the fuck are you on about?
---
Now for the monument. 
---
If you’re hunting DEDs, then it’s totally worth bringing a dedicated scanner ship, though DEDs might be a bit difficult for you and may require something besides a Vexor. 
---
You can sometimes just get site escalations out of running Anoms, but you’ll usually have to run a lot of them to find one. Don’t expect too much success by running 3 anoms and calling it a day. 
---
Risk/reward for carrier ratting aligns pretty well with VNI, incursions, and lvl 4 missions. The accessible and easy PvE options that have been popular for years.
---
Is that the light theme for discord? Gross
---
Hello Gamers,  
---
The spreadsheet linked is actually old and outdated, I run/ran the current one and I've come to open it up to you guys, I was not made aware of any botting going on, I was basically just making sure the corp was making money and stuff but you guys can look for yourself and get your own opinion based on the data.  
---

I've had to remove the ESI stuff so that it loads faster and so my API isn't out there for everyone to take lol.  
---
January and February data will also allow you to view a few months into the past of the data also
---
[https://evescoutrescue.com/home/](https://evescoutrescue.com/home/)
---
In before leaker also botter
---
&gt; more efficient to get a proper scanning ship and....  
---
That would be more efficient in areas with less traffic, such as nullsec, where you should go looking for sites as soon as you train into a Tengu, but in hisec competition is too high, chances are the site will be gone when you return.
---
Super impressive, well done!
---
Pretty sure you can go past that 500 limit by staging personal bookmarks into Corp locations.  But yes, I agree 500 is not enough.
---
&gt;since it seems your unfamiliar with capitals.
---
says the guy suggesting some of the most pants on head retarded changes yet.
---
We'll probably learn super quick once Guard actually starts there. I could imagine his job offer falling through or something like that if word got out too early though.
---
I am also curious as to industry, and I'm not sure I totally trust the "outside the video game industry" bit. We'll see though heh
---
Guard got poached
---
do you mean to tell me the thing with the biggest gun is the best at killing other things????
---
Hmm that's weird that's about the right range for what I mentioned isn't it?
---
So what you are saying is they have guns that hit out to 5km ( which in Eve is equivalent to let's say a smartbomb) and then they have their large caliber guns that can hit out to 40km?  
---
What I was saying is these large caliber guns can't and won't be used to hit an agile target such as a Somalian pirate ship.  So as long as the Somalian pirate wasn't within these short range small caliber guns ranges they are perfectly safe from this one battleship right?
---
Ok second off, yes you are correct there's not much a Somalian pirate would do to one of these battleships.  But again back to my analogy, one frigate, idc which one, by itself can't do anything to a battleship in EvE either.  So this analogy still holds true.
---
I'm sorry you are hurt that I didn't use perfect stats from the last decommissioned battleship.  But after looking it up, the analogy still holds.  
---
Thank you for your salt
---
Well that's a lot to take in at once...
---
The second last thing we want to do is provoke Snuff
---
Why is everyone upvoting a GIF of Hitler ?
---
That's some dedication, well done Katia!
---
Better the company give 2 weeks than meeting someone at the door to tell them they've been laid off.
---
That seems to happen a lot too.
---
Yes plz :) low-class needs new content drivers. Moon mining brought the safety if tethering to w-space, give us something new to get players out in the open for engagement
---
i'm trying to come up with some kind of charitable explanation why you'd be okay with feeding on the scale you are while killing a rorq here or there and i'm drawing a blank
---
that's the point i'm making
---
d e l e t e l o c a l
---
Targets should be players, corps, and alliances. The contract is fulfilled when a specified amount of damage is caused, the person/ corp that completes the assignment receives the award. Can also specify certain regions as well.
---
we also used talwars and muninns both of which did pretty well, and archons although that doesn't really fight snatch fleet as much as it does just nullify the premise
---
i had a concept in mind for a fleet doctrine called "literally what are you going to do about it-cats" where we anchored a spinmaster on your staging station, castle bubbled the undock and camped you in from tether with supers while bashing your poses with titans but lex didn't wanna try it :(
---
&gt;if 3 guys specifically counterfit 1 guy they win
---
whoa who wouldve thought
---
I know the difference between the two. A trial is for a limited time, and there are few restrictions. F2P locks the best content behind a paywall, but is of unlimited time.
---
Want to run more advanced dungeons in SWTOR? Pay up. Want to go beyond level 20 in WoW? Pay up. Want to run the most advanced missions in Eve Online? Pay up.
---
It is rather simple.
---
Player numbers mean nothing. Subscriptions and PLEX sales are what matter. F2P players are nothing but a drain on system resources.
---
oh? what ideas am i advocating for?
---
outside of removing haw from titans (which is experimental at best i admit)
---
and allowing fax on dreads (considering how much the meta of battleships and carriers seems to revolve around those, its a bit odd dreads the odd one out.   could balance it with longer siege times and less dmg. )
---
Quick someone mention a gate to somewhere
---
yes, that too
---
Once again congrats currently haveing a beer for you o7
---
That is some real effort dude. Impressive.
---
He used to bot, got banned, looks like hes at it again. Pics of botting software and chat logs. 
---
Holy shit awesome job
---
Vexor is just because I wanted to get back into trying some combat without investing too much money, for harder sites I'd a my Gila or perhaps get my Rattlesnake if that turned out to be worth it.
---
And thanks, I'll look into this! 
---
did you know the only named system in syndicate is poitot?
---
You made your first friend ever in eve-online
---
Your analogy was incorrect. The lethal range of every battleship during it's own era was far greater than any other opponent. From dreadnaughts to late 80s harpoon equipped. A modern battleship would and could lay waste to any vessel on the sea short of possibly a full missile barrage from a Kirov. What countered it was air craft and very long range heavy and accurate ship to ship missiles that could engage over the horizon. You are trying to relate real life things to a video game that specifically alters these things for balance and playability. Either you don't know how they performed or it doesn't fit your need. That however does not mean I am salty. It means I pointed out glaring errors and you apparently need to stay on narrative and you are doubling down because.. I don't know. Good luck with your bad analogy. GG
---
And if/when you do get to the point that you want to sign on with a corporation, Dreddit is recruiting!
---
http://dredditisrecruiting.com/
---
Give 90 percent of the ships value to whoever lands the killing blow on the ship.
---
Cut the newbro some slack homeslice
---
Link it then 
---
btw your corp name is cringey as hell
---
&gt; Cant tell you how much plex i would have dropped on skins if half of the fucking skins released were for all ships or an entire races instead of random dumb bullshit. 
---
This so much. Id use lots of plex on skins. But theyre so few and good ones are usually on certain ships. Like why cant we have Khanid for all amarr ships? is it so hard? Punisher khanid skins dont exist they should exist in the store. Tech 2 ships dont have them. And that was just one example.
---
VNI is 40m/hr roughly (somewhat abusing garbage AI, but that’s perhaps a subjective call), incursions are 100m/hr if you include LP, about half that otherwise (correct me if I’m way out here) and are group content with significantly more risk, never mind likely a more expensive ship+fit, and level 4s in highsec are 40m/hr ish too (not counting burners, they require expensive and difficult to fly frigates at stake/reward and require multiple accounts to properly farm)
---
Where is carrier ratting on this continuum? 10m/hr+? High end reward, low end for risk from the NPCs. I’d not call it well aligned as currently stands, and you haven’t really convinced me to reconsider. Thanks for keeping it cordial though :)
---
The Raven is the only one I didn't snag many years ago...at the time i was like meh Raven, but now I am kicking myself for it! lol
---
I had no idea INIT. controlled anything in Syndicate, thanks for the heads up 
---
wtb hs gate to hed-gp
---
We have to get her out on an AT team too, for a jovian space visit!
---
Good luck with the AT being cancelled
---
RIP AT
---
There's way too much ISK available to people now. I actually like the idea, but it's too easy to ruin someone's character.
---
10/10, amazing dedication to a goal.
---
&gt; The bounty works like a wardec just on a single person, except there is no 24 hour warning window. You will get a notification that someone activated a kill-right on you
---
Do you mean the bounty would make them a legal high sec target? I like the rest of what you've got otherwise.
---
&gt;  For example, an inability to fly anything above a T1 frigate until the Wanted pays back the value (or more) of the bounty that was paid out on them
---
What idiot fuck foofoo magic spacefuckery would be enforcing this?
---
upvoted for being a classic
---
Oh please, that'd just make the creator add a line of code that will make the bots shoot each other if the bounty is high enough.
---
Onto the next topic. Don’t smoke crack.
---
And in the meantime allow someone to put bounties on a bunch of fc's so that they can't fly anything but t1 frigates for some important fleet? Yeah that is probably the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
---
The same fuck foofoo magic that stops you lighting even a covert cyno in highsec, or self destructing a ship any faster/slower than 2 mins.
---
It's not that suggestions are bad, but we all know that CCP isn't going to address the issue with capital ships. It'd:
---
1. Piss off plenty of people that are happy with their capital ship and the niche they find themselves in
---
2. Introduce other balance issues
---
3. Be a **lot** of work (which is not something CCP does nowadays)
---
The eternal conundrum: have something but pay for it vs. Have nothing but not pay for it.
---
The FC would need to:
---
1. Fly an expensive ship while having a bounty they can't match on them
---
2. Die with the bounty on their head
---
2. Not find any way to get the funds to match the cost of the ship lost to pay the fine
---
That is, frankly, beyond unlikely.
---
I have no idea what his status is. A good question!
---
and give me more saved fittings pls thx
---
i make random bookmarks proxay, every day. I drop cans and rename them "CCX C3"
---
lmao fuck you australian
---
&gt; yikes. if your looking for single player. EVE is the WORST game possible. as EVE is majorly about connections.
---
&gt; 
---
This is basically the best advice in the thread, except that **Eve is great because of this** and if you can learn to embrace the multiplayer, it's the best game ever. You get a story - the one you tell yourself - and all the characters are real. It's way more intense than any handcrafted singleplayer RPG story where you know the author already wrote you in as the winner. 
---
That's crazy dedication, and not dying in the process is amazing
---
Hey u/Stainguy need you here bud, this post is too wholesome needs more shitpost.
---
But seriously awesome achievement, proud to have once been a member of Signal Cartel.
---
What scale, though? A few bombers and insurable ravens?
---
Good job, just like usual now that an issue has publicity this will eventually be taken care of by CCP in the next month or two. 
---
Get real bro. If he had a solid idea he could license the ip. If it were profitable ccp wouldn’t say no. 
---
That's racist
---
What is working out a mutually beneficial deal because it’s such a slam dunk business?
---
F

god bless william pierce for maintaining this spreadsheet:

---
also don't come at me with "they were insured lol"
---
me too, although after a week I'd be the only one still playing it haha
---
Plot twist, they have to be omegas
---
Thank you to everybody that showed up Etiennes send off.

Hopefully we got some great footage and pictures to make a montage to forward onto his parents. 
---
Thank you PL for bringing the fight.

https://zkillboard.com/related/30002540/201903092200/
---
Yeah cause fighters need to suck less than they already do
---
Exactly. Which is why CCP is not going after the null bot. They pay for an account. They only bust them when they do something stupid.
---
Look awesome. You should do the nyx next
---
Oh no not our bomber backbone :(
---
Come on man you know full well that amount of materiel is trivial at this level. The herpaderp titan feed in Fountain by whatsisname trying to rescue some idiot's rorq the week before the deployment cost more than that.
---
My issue with contact to others is that I always feel highly nervous or even anxious if the other is an actual player and not an NPC. That's because I've played solo for a long time.
---
A question for Katie Sae. Tru your amazing journey, did you found a lowsec or highsec gate to Stain??? Asking for a friend ofcourse
