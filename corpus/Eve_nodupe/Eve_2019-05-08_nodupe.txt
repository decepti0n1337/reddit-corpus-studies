As a line member, I have no say in the higher ups, just like a new casual employee in an Apple store has any say in how to do things to the CEO of Apple.

We have a problem, everyone has a problem. I hope this ban wave makes people in corp leadership positions act on their dodgy members and that they feed info up the chain for those that are dodgy outside of their corp.

Yes I'm a Goon, yes I fucking hate cheaters. I play this game to relax, enjoy myself, shit talk on comms, go on fleets and die in a wonderful fire. Cheaters ruin that either directly or indirectly for me, they do the same for yourself and everyone else in this post and reddit and even the game, for the most part. It shits me to tears that peopel get reported and nothing happens, can I do anything about it even after reporting to CCP for months and log in to see them STILL doing their botting today when they are in a different alliance? All I can do is blow them up and carry on at this point. For members inside the Imperium, if I want to stay in the Imperium (I do) I can't go off and blue shoot, I just have to report to CCP again, report to higher ups and hope it gets fixed. Most of the time they get booted, sometimes they don't, sometimes their corp directors are complicit and thenit gets messy. Your dealing with upper management, that makes it difficult as they are mainly looking up, not down

Okay good because I haven't played in years and was wondering what the fuck V did.  Alt+D for sure brings back memories, though I mostly lived in low and didn't do much WH beyond hanging out in some C3s for weeks on end just to see what sort of action I could get.  The single WH eviction I ever participated in was by far and away the most boring fucking thing I'd ever done in EVE, like even compared to hauling, market trading, and PI.  Having to actually keep a focus while the only thing keeping you going is bullshitting in fleet chat for a few days until the POS reinforcement ended still brings yawns to me when I think of it.
---
Is CCP planning to give Alliance leaders more tools to detect bots, and also pay them for doing your job for you?
---
Ya, that won't get exploited.
---
I tried to be a wormhole once......can confirm this is kinda  how the interview went.
---
For me I had the opportunity where I could have joined a buddy and his corp in a C5.  But at that point I felt like okay maybe I should bring a carrier, but how much do I want to actually move in because do I really trust them?  I know things have changed quite a bit since I quit, but POS living wasn't much of a guarantee when joining a new group of people.
---
If you don't think you are a bot, you are a really good bot.
---
Trinity, it was back in the Kali days... CCP hadn't had a chance to put in FW and fuck it up yet. Black Ops, HICs and Marauders , JFs and E-Frigs showed up.
---

---
There were two game modes, Potatoe and Commodore64 
---
Oh, and CCP deleted my boot.ini, Best patch ever
---
I've been grabbing footage for my solo PvP video in Amamake also, but I forgot to grab some for that :(
---
It'd give incentive to report your own bots... You can see how that's a bad thing
---
Give rorquals a boson.
---
"What is the fleet comp?"   
---
"Yes."
---
Every ratter in nullsec is in a VNI. They have tons of demand. Theyre also an alpha-bot favorite.
---
While we may not be able to get the same parity as the VNI in other faction cruisers since drones are inherently better at PVE, buffing other navy cruisers/battleships would help other factions gain more demand on their ships and be competitive instead everyone milking gallente LP. Or leaving the warzone to artificially inflate LP prices and VNI costs to rake in billions.
---
The issue isn't just the bots. Like I said elsewhere, that's an endless game of whack a mole. If you really want the issue dealt with, track the money back to where ever it ends up and ban the bot account, money laundering accounts, and main accounts.  Otherwise, you're doing no more than giving botters a speed bump.

How is it racist?

tons of demand but terrible LP value?

if you mean "they can buy and use them", yeah they can also sell their LP for 1K and buy two...

I regret that I have but one upvote to give this. AND the fact that it makes so much sense, since one should NEVER underestimate the power of Human Stupidity.....
---
Top-1 Russian alliance? Really?! Christ the bar must be pretty low.
---
Wipe account. Track ISK. Wipe transferred ISK from those accounts. Ban if not taxes. If transfers were taxes, wipe it back. If taxes are unavailable due to spending, take from Corp wallets. If corp wallet has been expended, sell assets to fix it. If assets unavailable to sell, dissolve the Corp.   
---
Do it. Create a hole in the New Eden power-structure. Anyone acting like they were unaware of botting happening within their group is a liar or too ignorant to be allowed use of the farmed money.  
---
Why are people scared of alliances dissolving? Let's see some war!
---
I've been gone for between two and three years. Looking to get back in, but need to start my isk generation. I've got a carrier pilot, a marauder pilot, and a few mining toons. Where's the isk at these days? Are incursions (pre-Invasion later this month) still a thing?
---
&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!
---
While we're all against bots, it just feels weird that TEST members taking moral high ground because their renters are not flagged this time.
---
Remember that last time (Jan 13th) that test renters got massacred when local was down? I still remember because I contributed to it: [https://imgur.com/a/kolWmdh](https://imgur.com/a/kolWmdh)

It you truly mean the alliance should take care of the renter botting issue,  don't just point at others, please also take action in your own renters (BTW, those KWG botters are now in IGC).

Lots of demand with lots of sellers which means lots of competition. Which means its harder to make large profits. However you will get consistent payout as there is demand.

https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_name_header=Vexor+Navy+Issue
---
Look at the jita quantity per day and then compare to other navy cruisers. VNI is over 18k units sold per day at least based off the current data.
---
The next highest cruiser is the Nosprey at 1500 units. Everything else struggles to break 500-1000. Yes the LP/isk value is low, because a gigantic amount of them are moving around and being sold per day which makes margins thin as youre competing with everyone else.
---
With those numbers youre almost guaranteed to sell your VNI fast as compared to other LP options. If 18k are being sold per day, people are obviously sinking LP into them.
---
You forgot to squeeze in "get real drunk"

When I was roaming last night I counted about 35 across 10 different systems. 
---
This morning, I only saw one or two characters in those same systems. Most of these were several months to a year old. I'm assuming those were the human bot handlers who were logging in to see where all their bits disappeared to, lol.
---
Get a few friends, get them into voice chat, strategize and plan out your fleet, gear up and lead them to glory!

Yeah. The Aura replacement voice is a weird mix of perky and impersonal.

Same ships can be fitted differently even for the same purpose depending on your skill or other conditions. Also, you can use ships for multiple purposes. There is rarely a cookie cutter fit for ships, even Asteros/explo frigates can be used for combat (and often are), even hauling ships can be used for a completely different purpose , etc.
---

---
Nullsec DEDs wouldn't really be worth running without those bpcs.  As it is they are heavily over farmed and battleship modules are quite cheap compared to cruiser mods.  Do you have a solution for this?
---
I like the idea of giving more people a reason to be in space in lowsec.  How do you feel about removing 6/10s from null and making them lowsec only content?  This would make the most sought-after and valuable headspace mods even more so, which would create powerful incentives to fight over those sites.
---
lol
---
That Succubus...wow.

And that doesn't change the fact that nobody is obliged to do those things, so most people do not as they have better things to do with their time.

Yeah at some point DBRB lost a fleet to PDS every other day.

Adding here that Anza are a great bunch, and their alliance (Darkness) and coalition (DeadCo) have a very strong Aussie timezone nullsec presence, probably second only to The Imperium.

If you want to make a real go of getting into eve, regardless of which alliance you end up in, get into a nullsec group ASAP.

Yeah, I can see this being the go-to defence of shitty behaviour just as it is in literally every other game.
---
Is this a really long post telling us to do ccp's job for them? Because the title implies it is.
---
Attacking Upwell Structures.  
---
I can activate an analyzer module to find out the reinforcement time, so the attack can be planned.  
---
But since I am a cheapskate, and want to prevent having to pay war fee multiple times - does the hacking cause you to be Concordokken'd in HiSec if you have not yet declared war?  
---
A.k.a. is it nothing, suspect level offense, or criminal offense?  
---
Would be neat if the hacking can be done beforehand. Anyone knows?
---
A ton of bots have already moved over to FW space where at least they can be hunted very inefficiently. Another thing they may force botting programs to be a little more complex is drone do not auto aggress; you have to lock each target and tell them to aggress like turrets and missiles. Adding more warp disrupting NPC to null site and fw complexes will help too... Spitballing like:
---
Novice- no effect; counts toward contest level 1/4 as large
---
Small-rat warp disrupts; counts toward contest level 1/2 as large
---
Medium- rat warp disrupts attacking rat give you no warp for 30 secs; counts toward contest level 3/4 as large
---
Large- 40km warp disruption bubble and 30km to run like now; rat warp disrupts attacking rat give you no warp for 30 secs.
---
Botters and afk peeps would be easier to catch. A person d-scanning and actually paying attention could still burn away and warp from a blob. 
---
Last night a guy, after I popped his tristan, just warpped his pod around his safes for about a 30 mins then reshipped and came back. I probed his safes and got him a second time, again he warped to safes aimlessly in his pod. Next system over in the same corp was a venture doing the same thing. I didn't even bother. I went to bed and logged back in about 12 hours later same guys are still deplexing the same system. Corp and names were random and made no sense.
---
It's killing the game slowly but surely; waters down all the isk making capabilities for the smaller corps.
---
There's a difference between doing CCP's job and doing absolutely nothing. It's fairly low effort to deal with the obvious bots in your alliance, I know it does not take me much time at all. For the long term benefit of the game, booting bots while CCP is still working on it is an important step in the process, because otherwise they continue to make money, creating further incentives.
---
&gt; Remember that last time (Jan 13th) that test renters got massacred when **local was down**?
---
And now you know what must be done to stop bots.
---
What if we made pve a group activity that used diamond rat ai
---
There's a middle ground between not doing anything at all and patrolling every system 24/7. There's a lot of low hanging bot fruit that's pretty easy to throw out, and that's the kind of thing that alliances should be dealing with instead of sticking their heads in their ears. The alliances are making rental and tax isk from the bots, why should they get to keep that when the bot gets banned? That just incentivizes people to accept more bots.
---
TIL there are a lot more people who are colour-blind (partial or fully) than I realized.   
---
I had no problem with figuring which damage applied to which ship and I know very little about triangle ships other than "don't try to solo a Kiki".
---
This is good.
---
It should be alliances' job to do everything they reasonably can to police their space against botters. It's not that hard. Else it becomes a race to the bottom. "Everyone does it so why shouldn't we" can only change if there is some kind of accountability.
---
The best solution would just be to make mining more active by reducing rock size, removing auto cycle, and/or by making it require excavators to use fighter mechanics.
---
The whole point of the game Screeps.
---
It's pretty neat it's a 24/7 RTS at MMO scale and MMO persistence.   Because of those mechanics it has the fairest open world PvP I've seen in an MMO.   And the individual gets to do what's normally guild level stuff like planning defenses and cities,  while Guild level stuff turns in World War level conflicts.
---
You answered your own question there. Not active, not very good i.e. not a good place to learn.
---
In before non stop linking of how to self destruct.
---
Where in his tweets does he mention Chinese bots? Or did you just see fraternity treasury and presume he said Chinese bots?
---
Bots can do active PVE. Nearly all bots in 2012 were either missile tengus or marauders of all stripes. I'm not sure why everyone focuses on drone mechanics.
---
Wanting to reduce the yield of rorquals is a perfectly fine position to hold, but it sure as hell isn't an impediment to botting.
---
What is it goons are known to do? Is it give roaming gangs a moderately entertaining fight? Wait no, it's not quite that, what was it... oh yes, boson titans on gates. The fact that you assume it was meant to have anything to do with OP rather than your own comment suggests you may be lightly retarded.
---
Yes, it can be done beforehand as long as the structure can be targeted.
---
i’m referring to the people who try to argue that there isn’t a culture of cheating in chinese gaming
---
Nah.  The balance in the plex market is always going to be people who have more time than money on one side, and people who have more money than time on the other. 
---
What it looks like to me is that over the last couple of years it's been a seller's market.  More people want/need to plex their accounts than there are people willing to spend over and above what they pay for subs.  The price of plex rises.
---
The proliferation of bots out there is owning to two factors beyond RMT, which has always been with us.  
---
People wanting/needing to plex their omega accounts are resorting to botting as it becomes harder / too time consuming to plex their accounts on top of paying rent while playing honestly.
---
You have just plain greed driven players for whom "winning" is how big their isk balance is, and they don't care if they have to cheat to "win".
---
Then there is a smaller group of players who need to fund their PvP on top of plexing their account(s) and either can't or don't want to pay money to do it.
---
no look it up yourself, faggot.
---
The "disease" in this case being Eve online's fundamental design: that players are the content. Not much that can be done there aside from CCP flipping the chessboard a la jump fatigue.
---
Thanks to science.
---
Yes this will make helping newbies a trillion times easier.
---
TY so hyped CCP will get a very angry player doing stuff they won't like if this isn't implemented asap.
---
Suggesting that alliances can "just use ESI to catch botters" is a very weak argument. 
---
If such measures are made a requirement, then the barrier of entry to running any organization is increased to "has a programmer who is talented enough to not only use ESI, but write sophisticated forensic software for a space-themed spreadsheet." It isn't just a barrier to entry for large organizations -- it's a barrier to *all organizations.* Given that player corporations are the single best retention mechanic for new players, it seems a poor choice to add such an onerous requirement.
---
Granted, CCP could release open source software that does the task. If this happens, then my question becomes "why isn't CCP running the software themselves, from their position of vastly superior available data?"
---
It is also technically possible for players to release open source forensic software for a space-themed spreadsheet. However, it's unlikely. Eve's a cutthroat competitive environment. If alliances are "required" to run forensic software for a space-themed spreadsheet or face censure/penalty, alliances would be highly motivated to develop the software and keep it closed source, and use it as a recruitment bennie. "Join Loonflock Confederacy -- we're compliant with the Peligro Conventions!" 
---
It's easy to think of software development as some sort of automatic, magic task. However, it's not. If it was, I wouldn't be makin' the big bucks IRL, at any rate.
---
I feel like you're missing three retarded ideas I've seen posted regularly:
---
1. Make ratting ships magically payout some special bounty to make bot hunting profitable
---
2. Make rats drop tags/lp instead of isk to somehow make something better (?)
---
3. Make all rats point/scram (but only the ratter)
---
I totally forgot that simply "trying it out with safety on green" works, duh. Silly me.  
---
Thanks for pointing it out, will undock right now and prep for my tiny space war!
---
Do you not play the game? The extent people go to in this game to fuck people over is incredible.
---
Might wanna clean your feythabolis and omist backyard before giving lessons to everybody.
---
That's something the world needs more of good for you.
---
Generally, most major alliances that have this kind of botting issue also tend to have a manner of checking ESIs. At minimum, they'll have SEAT, which has all the features necessary. I can't think of any large alliance, who would be the ones affected by this because they hold sov, that doesn't have that capability. Even Horde has API gated corps. If the alliance isn't able to check people's ESIs when they're joining, then I'm not sure how they're currently existing. GOTG has an auth system, Panfam has a few auth systems, Skill has an auth system, Winter has an auth system, Legacy has a few auth systems, Goons and friends have an auth system. The nature of null means that having that kind of infrastructure, even if it's just a bare minimum SEAT instance that's really easy to set up, is pretty much a requirement already. There's a lot of very obvious bots out there which basic CI capability like SEAT can pick up on. Not everyone is an elite ninja hackerman, most are just spamming bot chars.
---
Hit me up if you have intel on bots.
---
How about you do the job since you get the isk? Wasn’t that your point? Doesn’t seem that appealing anymore?
---
Megablocs could have programs where members run through space with both a blue and neutral toon to bot check. Pay members who do this a modest sum and you'll weed out botters stupidly fast.
---
Sure it's "doing CCP's job for them" as some naysayers might complain, but cheating can still happen in games with much stricter controls and something in a galaxy this large with this many accounts and the very small functional difference between botting and AFK ratting potentially difficult to detect...
---
Even aimbots/wallhacks take time to ban in FPS games and those are just as blatant, if not more so. Games do not always have auto-detect/auto-ban features. It's not realistic.
---
I hate megablocs, I hate renter schemes, and I hate bots. I will still vote for this, especially because I like your overall platform.
---
so the best solution to computer automating tedious clicking for hours on end is to add more tedious clicking?
---
how does this hurt bots?
---
seems like it only hurts players
---
I'm really confused. Is this like an inside meme or is there some subtext I'm missing? Can you quote where anyone is saying any of this stuff?
---
Complexity hurts a bot more than it hurts a player. Why do I have to explain this? Also what is your solution?
---
Not safe for lunch?
---
Bomb frigates and cruisers, then cycle torps and cloak for battleships, they won’t lock you in time. Bombing gives best results in red giants obviously.
---
I do that job already, if you have further intel, let me know, and they'll be dispatched as well. The crux of this is that everyone should generally be working towards less bots, not profiting from the existence of bots. Rather than get upset, it's a better solution to let me know where you've seen them, so that I can nuke em fast. In that scenario, everyone wins, because less bots. This isn't about alliance vs alliance, it's about humans vs robots. This is a pretty easy stance to unite over, we want less bots not more.
---
I'd rather like it to be a drug or a module
---
can you just become our renters?
---
Large nullsec alliances aren't the only people who earn money from taxes. Like I said earlier, requiring organizations to run forensic software under pain of censure or penalty becomes a liability for *any corporation that earns tax revenue from its members, from any source.* Even tiny highsec corporations recruiting from Jita local that have members that run missions face an increase in liability this way.
---
You're also suggesting that manual enforcement is acceptable. I'd like to see a show of hands of people who find forensic accounting for no material gain to be a worthwhile way to spend their time. Putting in a forensic accounting requirement for running any organization, no matter how large, is a suicide watch level operation.
---
Any ship being able to circumvent local is too invasive. You could move Titans etc without being seen.
---
True but idk if that's really a bad thing.. would spice things up for sure
---
Oh hey, look at this : http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Kids_With_Guns_Alliance . There is a lot of words in your post and if they don’t even mean getting rid of kids with guns I don’t know why you would even write so much.
---
You have an opportunity to look upon all the new stuff with fresh eyes. And yet you want to rub bitterness and salt into them first?
---
Would yield less kill mails overall imho
---
Man, I love those WDS trolls.
---
Yeah, it's two comments up. 
---
&gt;sometimes people's hate boner for me gets in the way of their ability to read or comprehend.
---
The lesson is that he's allowed to wildly mischaracterize what CCP Peligro said, but no one else is allowed to take the same liberties with what he said.  And if you disagree with him or point out this hypocrisy, you're a dude with a hate boner who can't read.
---
Wrap your head in tinfoil and you'll be OK.
---
If the taxes received were from botters then even if the alliance were completely innocent the money they received from botters in their corps is still invalid. Like recieving stolen property in real life. Just because you made the purchase in good faith and are completely innocent doesn't mean you get to keep the stolen property you purchased. Only the corps aren't even hurt that much, because, unlike a real life purchase of stolen property, those taxes cost the corps essentially nothing to receive. Easy come easy go.
---
Large nullsec alliances are the ones at issue here, because they're overwhelmingly the ones that have the issues. That's the whole point of Peligro's set of tweets today. PBLRD and Frat Treasury represent an overwhelming proportion of bot bans, far in excess of what their size would suggest. After today, roughly 1/3 of their membership combined would appear to have been banned. These aren't small little alliances, these are administrated by two of the largest alliances in TEST. The tiny highsec corps aren't the ones enabling bots to run ratting sites in null. You don't need to be in a tiny highsec corp to run missions in highsec. This is a situation unique to nullsec.
---
Considering the number of people who play EVE, and the amount of CI active in EVE, there seems to be a market for it. I know I represent a portion of that market. Most things tend to come to me via player reports or tools, which I then follow up on. Same way I would if they were reported as a spy. Hunting bots isn't significantly more effort, and is often less in fact, than hunting spies, and most big groups do that already.
---
A large small or a small large. We call that medium in this part of the world.
---
Thank you!
---
And hey, I get that. PvP is still my favorite thing in Eve.
---
Blue all us WH corps, we will take care of those nasty botters for ya.
---
CCP making room for the incoming bot farms?
---
it's great to see you guys surviving on your own. Staging out of a BOT fortizar protected by Horde
---
Yes, so let me know of any bots you see there, and the hammer comes down. This is a group effort by EVE as a whole to say 'no, we do not want bots.'
---
I still don't get how that means he can't be wrong. But ok eve politics are confusing and obviously that makes things very subjective for the reader.
---
The community is smaller now, but still just as helpful as ever ;)
---
Enjoy your downvote noob
---
MINERS RISE UP
---
Doom wants it to involve EVE politics.  It doesn't actually involve EVE politics.
---
or just use 2 RR domis ( newbro friendly)
---
this isn't added complexity, this is the same action repeated more often (in the case of size, cycle)
---
bots already have functions to target things and take actions, this would just call the same functions already in the bot more often
---
for fighter mechanic bots: are there not already bots that can handle fighter mechanics?
---
these aren't increases in complexity, they're the same already solved problems repeated over and over.
---
i didn't say i had a better solution, i don't work for ccp, i don't need a better solution, neither do you or any player. players aren't responsible for taking action against people who break the rules, that's ccp's job, players literally pay them for it
---
game mechanics don't solve botting and players don't know what information ccp has available to find bots, players don't have necessary information to even discuss the problem intelligently
---
No. People will just use alphas on vm’s running through VPN’s to bot in their enemies space
---
Have you ever heard of cover ops? When going after a certain group we put a "cover up front" to make it look like we are not targeting the group individually.... they have been after "Fraternity" bots for a while and that Goon ban was just to cover their specific target. maybe grow up and get some real world experience before calling others retards and actually see the facts in here. Why is the list not out yet? Anything can get tampered with by now....so I call it as it is...
---
I believe ccp does remove isk from alliances if they get it from bots.
---
(Unless its collected via 100% corp tax. Bot sure in that scenario)
---
First of all, we are not blue to GSF.
---
Secondly, FRT are blue to NCPL which is equal the largest alliance on TQ WHEN THEY BLUE THEM.
---
It is really unfortunately that PANFAM are not on top now.
---
"No see bots are an ongoing problem that requires an ongoing solution means that because you haven't already 100% eradicated all bots you aren't doing anything and in fact embrace bots with open arms and harbor them." -/r/eve logic

Sounds like you should just stop renting space to people. You will have much less stress.
---
This is the most confusing thread of all time...
---
Bots aren't unique to nullsec. Go check out Faction Warfare or any Sisters of Eve mission hub for a lesson on how shit actually is in this game. Introducing a forensic accounting requirement means that you have to apply it fairly. Doing otherwise would be hideous hypocrisy, not to mention laughably skirtable. 
---
Also, you should know better than to take anything posted on Twitter as an germane statement. Just like the Yulai public executions, the actions are cherry picked for maximum public appeal. For better or worse, they use this hellhole as a barometer for public opinion, and they are highly motivated to tailor their messaging around whatever abortion being paraded around as a genuine thought that happens to be sliding down the sewer trough at the moment.
---
As he said in the post he's already doing the work.
---
As far as I know, they are not a group of people.
---
good news
---
Bots are very much not unique to nullsec, that's 100% a true statement. The courier missions were a particularly egregious recent example. What is unique to nullsec is the fact that you need to be in a null alliance in order to do null anoms. In highsec and FW, you can be in an NPC corp, or a one man corp to dodge the NPC taxes. In null, if you did the same thing, you'd just get killed all the time. I'm not saying bots are unique to null, I'm saying that this specific issue is unique to null.
---
Fortunately, that is why Peligro has also stated he'll be putting the full stats out, as can be seen here: https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1125820891017953287 This, I'm sure you'll agree, will deal with any potential cherrypicking.
---
The CSM doesn't write internal CCP policy. So no.
---
I think what CCP is going to crack down is even one step further.
---
"If you hide behind the 'we shouldnt be doing CCP'S job' phrase to justify knowingly helping and promoting botters, we will fuck you up"
---
it wont be people doing nothing and are just ignorant, its going to be people obviously putting their head in the sand because it benefits them or are actively helping establish botting groups.
---
updates.eveonline.com
---
In other threads on the subject I keep seeing people arguing that corps shouldn't be held responsible for the actions of some of their members. But the taxes received from a botting member wouldn't have been received without that botting member to begin with. So I'm not sure how you could call it a loss for it being taken. It's not like having stolen property you paid good money for taken from you in real life. The corps paid essentially nothing to receive those invalid funds. If you want to actually punish the corps you add a tax, calculated from the funds received from the botter, that the corps pays over and above the isk taken back from the corps. At least then there would be a valid unfairness argument.
---
To be fair to TESTs part, KWG aren't renters, just people who pay them and everyone else who have ever been near them to fuck off
---
Prothean was the top russian alliance.
---
You are VERRRRY far of reaching the quality of thoses guys....
---
If I had friends I would. This way took an hour and 20 minutes.
---
Shhht, don't fuck their precious narrative.
---
The CSM doesn't have a hand in policymaking within CCP, especially when it comes to Team Security. Trying to pretend otherwise or attempting to imply you could do that is disingenuous.
---
&gt;You're new here aren't you?
---
... Really? Jesus check my employment history in game.
---
I don't understand. A bot is a bot is a bot. Aren't *all* of them worthwhile to root out? Why are the nullsec bots so different? Nullsec density pales in comparison to missions. Missions are literally infinite. Sisters of Eve LP is nearly bulletproof, and even if the bots were crushing it, learning implants still exist as a baseline.
---
And, even so, there's *still* the requirement for small organizations. It doesn't matter if botting isn't commonplace in any given area of the game. It's all about liability. ANY organization has to take measures to reduce its liability by having such a requirement in place. You have to do it or you get fucked by CCP. You can't handwave that away by pretending like only large organizations will ever have to deal with it.
---
I direct you towards the first part of my [platform statement](https://www.voteforcornak.com/goal), which covers exactly this:
---
"Before anything else, it’s important to note that my platform is based not around what I expect, or even intend, to see implemented, but rather to demonstrate my priorities and my view of the state of EVE. The CSM isn’t a game design team, it's a feedback team, and so it’s important to acknowledge the limitations of that. CCP has expressed a desire to expand the CSM’s role, but until that happens, I want to ensure expectations are realistic, as it would be easy to misinterpret this site as ‘things that will be done.’"
---
This post is a statement of my views on the matter, not something I expect to be implemented based off my actions.
---
Organising that many people to do it, consistently to actually hurt an alliance like horde, while also making sure none of the plans leak?...
---
Period basis is literally 3 jumps from D-P, that's where a lot of the bots being banned in this wave were/are, in the other direction you can get to detorid/wicked creek pretty quickly though JB. On the more blue side, KWG are in omist which is near eso. You just can't indescriminantly kill every ratter in sight there unlike the other two places, if you just cloak in system and observe them you might be able to find some bots. (Find in this case meaning determine that they are probably bots rather then just look at them and report everyone in local).
---
Trump said that too
---
/r/woosh
---
Sorry not sorry about your bots.
---
A bot is indeed a bot, and we should target all bots. The trick is, in the case of null, the groups that harbor these bots do so because they gain tax or rental income from them. No other botting action has that effect, because no other botting action requires you to be part of a player run entity. I firmly believe all bots should be eliminated, and these actions would, I feel, go a long way towards dealing with null botters specifically. There's no such thing as a one size fits all solution, you need to match the cure to the problem.
---
Small organizations generally aren't able to hold the space that attracts bots en masse like you see in rental alliances. It's a self-solving problem, where once you hit the level where you start to attract bots, you also need to have some kind of alliance auth system, because otherwise you'll likely be eaten by spies and evicted.
---
I miss that show and this was perfect. Nice work!
---
You have my unwavering support for what it's worth.
---
Join a corp like horde, ppl would go with you
---
You're not reading what I'm saying. Stop laser focusing on nullsec for a moment and pay attention.
---
What you're suggesting adds liability to *every fucking player-run organization in Eve, even if they don't hold nullsec space or ever plan to.* It's like car insurance. In the USA, I'm required, by law, to maintain automotive liability insurance in order to operate a motor vehicle. The fact that I haven't been in an accident since I was 16 is irrelevant; I still have to have it. Similarly, any player-run organization has to protect itself against a botter, even a botter doing L4 missions in highsec, or get its colon reamed by CCP.
---
That's my whole point. Bloviating about nullsec doesn't change the fact that API filtering becomes a requirement for everyone in Eve in an organization with more than one actual human inside. It's a ridiculous notion to require the first or second human in any organization to be a skilled programmer. How does this not sound ridiculous to you?
---
Can we ban these shitty how to fix botting posts?

You could have just ignored them in a yodik venture.

"these groups contain many chinese players and so pointing out the fact that they bot is racist"
---
Your statements are so wrong on so many levels. I can only assume the TNT (lol second class citizens who krab all day) flair is legit. PIBC botted the shit out of serenity. Not racism, facts. Chinese culture sees cheating in muh vidyagam as something acceptable that everyone does. Not racism, facts. Just because you're pointing out a negative factor of a group that isn't necessarily made up of people the same race as you doesn't make it racism, and you need to be massively retarded to pull the "PC IT'S RACISM" card over it.
---
people use it to piss of chinese mainly, not disconnect them lol

Jackie Chan is not a character. He is an Asian actor.

Bear in mind the RP experience is one of the most boring parts of the game for most people (granted some like that aspect, but nearly the entire active playerbase does not)

the in-game lore amounts to little more than fan-fiction
---
Makes me think of the Shockwave Bowser makes in Super Mario 64, not a bad thing.

You are correct. Wingspan is a corp, not a wormhole. Where they spend their time has little bearing on whether they are a wormhole. With only 2,570 of them, not everyone can be a wormhole.

Imagine breifly holding tcus no one cared about and smugposting on reddit. Only in dronelands.
---
lower the drone bandwidth on VNIs.
---
or do something hilarious like the last wave of the site spawns diamond rats..
---
What is the ". Treasury" bit about?  Is that another alliance or something I don't know?
---
Exactly. There needs to be an incentive for corps and alliances to take action against bots rather than just waiting until it becomes a problem. Dealing with bots shouldn't be a "oh, fine, I *guess* we'll do it if we *have to*", it should be a "we need to take care of this shit *now* before we lose tens or hundreds of billions of ISK". Botters should be just as big of a problem if not more so than spies for large corps and alliances.
---
The actions that a lot of large corps and alliances have taken against bots in their ranks, while admirable, has been purely out of a personal desire to weed them out *despite the advantages of looking the other way*. And until we get rid of the ability for large corps and alliances to simply look the other way, this is going to continue to be a problem.

I hate this argument, "we shouldn't have to do this, it's CCP's job". Read up on the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) and then get back to me.
---
It's our job as players to make EVE the best game we can make it. We are the content creators, the movers and shakers that shape the greatest living world in video game history. We need to do our part to deal with botters however we can, which means reporting them and doing what we can to deny them of income wherever possible.
---
CCP can't do this alone. Neither can we. We need to work together to make New Eden a bot-free zone.
---
&gt; syringe to fill with water and squirt it at people on the train
---
that's where you get money for plex eh? mugging people by threatening them with a syringe. story check out this guy doesn't bot.
---
Corp tag VVVVV
---
I don't see how it's a liability to the corp when the corp would have never received those funds to begin with without the botter. And no funds legitimately paid in taxes are being clawed back. So the end result, at worst, is no different than if the botter was never part of the corp to begin with.
---
A ship who can evade local or is anyway bonused for hunting will be too op and will become in reality the only ship ever used for solo and small gang roams (for hunting bots and players alike).
---
But we have 'Monitor' for large fleet fights, we need a scout ship for small gang hunters. A shuttle-like ship with good align time and high base warp speed which can fit a cov ops cloak. The ship only appears in local if it lingers in the same system for more than 5 mins. It must not have any low or mid slots and only a single high slot for the cloak.
---
It definitely should not be able to fit a scram or cyno because again that would be too op. And make it as expensive as monitors (definitely not for atron gangs). I believe that a cloaky scout like this would make huge crab farms with large intel networks a little less secure and hunting a lot more fun.
---
["I CAST FIST!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujSjxpTB0fY)
---
Yeah, the way things are now, that's the case. What I'm talking about is a situation where CCP tacks on additional punishment to an organization if they aren't actively screening their members with forensic software powered by the Eve API, as described by the OP.
---
Old cyno. So fucking awesome.
---
The only extra incentive I've heard about would be public shaming, by publishing the banned botters and what corp they were a part of. If you get arrested irl your pics going to be in the paper whether your found guilty or not. I wouldn't call public information additional punishment even when it sometimes is.
---
wow this is great job friends it is so interesting that you can see on the chart all of the numbers indicating the destitute state of this trash game! I am exceptionally pleased with the way there are all of these types of spaceships in this game but only one worth flying for any reason whatsoever it really makes my life so much more simple which is super great because i am really dumb and making rational decisions is very difficult! where do i put my money?
---
seems like a way to extract the value of a bot account before it gets banned. 
---
there is a reason goons always wanted bots reported to their group first. easily kill them and loot their shit, then report them to CCP. this is just the same thing but in reverse.
---
they brought/rented out feythabolis for quite awhile  
---
isn't that the definition of renters?
---
Maybe the module is shop class restricted?
---
You misunderstand. I'm not talking about how things are today. I'm talking about how things would be in the future, if CCP changed the way they wish players to act by requiring them to screen their corpmates via API under pain of additional punishment. Like, for example, the CEO and everyone with the Director role gets banned if you are caught with a botter. That's an extreme example, but it illustrates the general idea.
---
wow are you discriminating people who speaks gibberish
---
When you decloak the rats start targeting you. If you are decloaked at the time they would lock you even if you cloaked and decloaked they will still successfully lock you.

but, sir... Imagine the 'meta' could be done with, Player A hate Alliance C, Player A create Bot Corp and rent Alliance C space.. and proceed to report it, wich than make Alliance C negwallet by CCP... You know this kind 'Meta', can get you banned for selling Molok ;)
---
hostile takeover.
---
Why is it retarded to increase incentives to hunt ratters?  Botting is profitable because for the most part bots are ignored because they use disposable ships that don't drop valuable loot and the killmails are unremarkable.  If someone is incentivized to setup login traps or bubbles in order to catch botters, then why not?
---
&gt;He's against botting because it's not profitable.
---
this is why the neg wallet needs to be 500%. make allowing bots REALLY not profitable.
---
Yeah same. I was so confused at the meme for a solid few minutes. Hahah
---
&gt; for solo 
---
What I imagine would have zero damage.
---
&gt; small gang roams (for hunting bots and players alike).
---
This is a feature not a bug.
---
&gt; A shuttle-like ship with good align time and high base warp speed which can fit a cov ops cloak. 
---
You need probing and covert cyno capability as well.
---
&gt; It definitely should not be able to fit a scram or cyno because again that would be too op.
---
The main problem haunting in Eve is safety in all kinds of spaces that weren't supposed to be that safe. For bots and humans alike. This is solving that problem. If this ship can't scram or probe, then forget solving that problem. I'd say reduce the delay to 1 minute, give it probes/cyno/scram and we're gucci.
---
Why are you physically incapable of separating the concept of "a corp that has a couple of people who bot under the radar" and "a corp that implicitly/explicity allows botting, as evidenced by the fact that a *majority* of the characters in it are bots".
---
Any Rental overlord or Alliance executor with more than 2 braincells to rub together can spot the latter of the two, and the continued existence of such a group in alliance is clearly just turning a blind eye.

We're elite reddit warriors. More important than logging in tbh

---
Also, as a bomber's bar FC, I'd guess that you know the following:
---
1) Half of every Bomber's Bar fleet is Wingspan peeps who are too lazy to find their own content.
---
2) Scanning and rolling a nullsec static does not mean you're doing "real wh stuff".
---
what if we took the part that has the computer game and turn it off forever
---
I was thinking about big-game hunters. Nowadays, small gangs have the firepower to take down whales (botting rorqs, carriers and nyx). If your scout gets reported on intel channel 10 jumps away, you lose the prey. But if you have a cloaky scout ship that can track down the exact location of a whale beforehand, you can immediately send ceptors and hyper-sabres at it to secure tackle. This gives the prey a fair minute or two to respond.
---
Exactly

And then a few orange/reds pop up outta nowhere. Ho boy

Highsec is scary, yo.

I would focus more on shiptypes and lore. The actual "running an alliance" isn't going to get a lot of views. Either way best of luck

Literally what fucking planet do you live on retard?  Maybe go outside and see what people actually do around your area, unless you literally do live in the shittiest place on earth but even fucking Mogidishu has a group of dudes just working as pro bono fire fighters...
---
Instead of taking low effort pot shots on reddit, why not do what I'm doing literally *right now* and start burning around and identifying bots to report?
---
I don't think it was coordinated, as far as I know, but for the last few weeks a bunch of TEST dudes have been running around trying to gank enemy ratters and reporting the ones that are obvious bots. And what do you know, contrary to popular belief CCP actually [does something with those reports](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1125820891017953287).
---
So either step up and put your money where your mouth is or shut the fuck up. Ain't got time for retarded armchair generals.
---
No, most people don't go out of their way to do unpaid work.
---
Or just make faction ships omega only, diminish alpha in other ways and remove bounties (perhaps knock them down to 10% so they are like training research vs a couple hours of FW)

Ahaha so good

You're right. Since its retarded to defend our space with effective weapons.

What about these 2 100% tax corps????
---
His point is that this information is not new. It is, in fact, arguably the most well-known botting group in New Eden. We're something on the level of your average American citizen not knowing of Google or 9/11, so the idea that you aren't aware of this group makes people suspicious.
---
Until they disclose the facts of the banning I wouldn't trust them. Just them sitting back saying "trust us" clearly doesn't work. Brisc found out the hard way they are vulnerable to gaming, i'm sure mass reporting as a bot is just as effective.
---
It's a skit from [Key &amp; Peele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw).
---
You're an idiot, you literally are just an antisocial idiot aren't you?  Theres 25,000 people that volunteered their free time for the up coming Fifa event alone, which included several months of training that was also not paid for.
---
This doesn't include things that are posted that the rest of us pick up from places like local churches, community buildings and shelters for the homeless and or women that regularly post for volunteers and have those filled.
---
People literally do these things Dave, its just that you're an asshole.
---
If you can fly An Oracle, Naga, or Tornado you can solo clear the instrumentals. Takes about 30 minutes instead. Need a mwd and the ability to shoot 150+km and lock 150+km, then keep them at that range and kill them ;)
---
This is actually pretty clever.
---
'Willingly' implies you actually know 100% that they are bots. I doubt you'll find many bots that tell you they will be botting in your alliance, and alliance leaders that respond with 'that's great, welcome to the family'.
---
Now if CCP was to build an indicator of likelihood of someone being a bot, then corp/alliance leaders could decide their tolerance level, and do something about it. Say, kick anyone whose indicator shows there is 95% chance of them being a bot.
---
&gt;also don't send me malware pls :(

Weirdly specific... I assume there's a story here :P

A few thousand volunteers are not most people, they are a small minority

Before I read this I am dropping in to give my unfaltering support for Stitch. I respect him as a pilot and as a good dude.

He is a solid PvPer and most importantly he understands ships, fits, tactics and metas at the solo/small gang level which is always lacking when it comes to how CCP deals with the game.
---
Stitch for CSM. Stich for president.
---
Our job as players is to fucking play.
---
The job of making the game the best it can be is the devs, that's literally what I'm fucking paying my subscription for.
---
CCP already takes that isk. I'd say try again, but please just dont.
---
You are missing step 0: build an indicator of how likely someone is a bot
---
They wont have THE most, but they'll be up there
---
Take a ceptor. Gate through Fey &amp; Omist. 95% of your renters there are bots. Everyone knows. You know it too.

What do you mean by 'for a long time they were the only way'? Are there other ways to earn officer modules?

wtf how u do that

10MN AB speed tank?

You are thinking like this is a regular MMO too much, you can't be "power-leveled" through anything really, unless somebody buys you a bunch of injectors or something, you can always go back to lower-tier missions and content whenever you want, you are not missing out on anything.
---
So sad. Alexa, play Below the Asteroids
---
Soooo... what about wormholes?
---
Learn to pilot your ship from the sounds of it, if the enemies are bunched up kite them away and warp off if you need to, try to separate a few and deal with them. That's the pve side of things for learning, if you want to go against other players go into faction warfare and look got a Corp in that militia.
---
Is that almost a hurricane in the background too?
---
Well, I mean there's an enjoyment of earning your own way rather than a player corp buying a ship and equipment for you.
---
ahaaha OvO pep pep

Not safe for looking-at?

Primary form of progression in this game is experience. Think about how you died and what lead you to dying. Then try and think of a way to prevent that.

&gt; A few thousand volunteers are not most people, they are a small minority

I gave you one example, there are literally thousands.
---
&gt;Also, a one off event isn't a job, just like going on holiday doesn't make you a tour guide
---
Right, and nobody is trying to make this your job, when you pass one you report it, thats it, thats not a job, its like walking buy some trash on the side walk and just picking it up and putting it in the bin, its not your job its just the right thing to do to make the hood a little better.
---
&gt;Look grath. This is a game. Nobody should be expected to do ccp's job for them when they log in.

Have you never filed a single bug report in your entire time playing EVE?

What’s your fit?
---
Happy cake day to you, sir.    Have a great day and ~fly dangerously~.
---
Takes one to know one ;)
---
I feel like drones are the only really good "split damage" because its actually viable to run drones with basically anything, whereas im yet to see someone unironically run lasers and missiles simultaneously
---
Ask your alliance. Or, find an alliance and then ask them, if you’re just coming back and for some reason your old alliance isn’t an option. Most people use armor caps, but Tapi uses shield and goons have a size able shield fleet in addition to their armor fleet. 
---
From what I’ve seen, usually Faxes are flown by alts specifically trained for them, and you’ll multibox that along with your combat capital whenever you drop. Can’t really say anything about Archon’s specifically, but as long as you join an alliance that uses armor caps you’ll have something to do with it.
---
Is that a goon chastising people for sniffing farts? Now i've seen everything.
---
They’re just collectibles, I bought a bunch of the old ones a while ago, but it seems like anything from after the fall of Bob is usually worth 1 mil at most, it’s only the really old stuff that is even somewhat valuable, so no point in investing in them
---
Downtime
---
Anyone can join code.
---
Could be a drunk buy order scam. If the item you bought was an obscure but valuable dead space mod then I’d bet that’s what it is.
---
Justice
---
You cant do anything, uninstall the game.
---
&gt; I gave you one example, there are literally thousands.
---
thousands, in cities and countries of millions to hundreds of millions is a minority. It's a very nice minority, but still a minority.
---
&gt;Right, and nobody is trying to make this your job,
---
are you sure? because i'm noticing a trend on r/eve  lately that there's seldom a day goes by that there isn't a new thread basically demanding players start going out and doing team security's job for them. it certainly feels like people are trying to make it 'our' job.
---
&gt;its like walking by some trash on the side walk and just picking it up and putting it in the bin, its not your job its just the right thing to do to make the hood a little better.
---
but these threads aren't like that. these threads aren't just "PSA, report people you think might be botting" they're almost calling for a goddamn crusade of certain regions 'because bots' etc. it's way past that sort of thing.
---
if it were just a "psa, report bots" i wouldn't give a fuck but it's gone past that in to absurdity.
---
&gt;Have you never filed a single bug report in your entire time playing EVE?
---
uh, actually. I'm not sure I have. given how long I've been playing i know pretty much what's likely to be buggy/broken and avoid it, and back when i was new(er) i don't even remember encountering many if any bugs. given all the spaghetti code in eve, i've always found it a pretty stable and bug free game in all honesty. 
---
just checked my logs, apparently i've submitted exactly 1, when I didn't think my noses were working correctly. the ticket was closed without a reply.
---
I mean, we are regularly one of the top killers in WH space according to [eve-tracker](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills).
---
afaik chinese people are required to give up private keys used in vpns so that they can get connections to internal networks (for work) while also satisfying the government's want to watch you poop (for national security reasons, of course). china gov can still see the copypasta coming across the wire to your pc. 
---
might be wrong tho, also there are still unmonitored illegal vpns
---
All isk that originated from bots is removed. Doesn’t matter how they launder it, it is tracked and deleted. 
---
Alliances and corps already lose all isk they got from taxing bots as part of this. 
---
People are proposing an additional penalty, like removing 200% of all botting tax income instead of 100%. This is what is a dumb idea, for reasons that should be obvious
---
the chinese gold farms are a meme, but theyre still true.
---
Yes, NPC sotiyos are also guarantied to drop an officer module. I don't know how the supply compares to officer rats though. I'm also fairly certain they can only drop ones associated with their faction.
---
hi welcome to the space navy for starters would u mind peeling some potatoes for dinner for the next 5 months
---
&gt; It is, in fact, arguably the most well-known botting group in New Eden. 
---
Then coming up with clear and specific evidence (like exact names of botting characters) should be easy, no?
---
To me, this kind of argument sounds like, "Hey, there are videos on the internet that infringe copyrighted material!" and when asked to provide specifics, the response is, "well, everyone knows there's infringing material, how do you not know?" instead of, you know, providing actual specifics.

Found it. A bit late. I just picked up a gila and was trying to practice with it. And i wanted a 1v1 and i didnt care if it i lost it. The pilot was pretty civil though. Even after the blue interfered. Im not a good pvp person. It is my major weak point. I mostly do low end industry. The blues wanted just gang up on him because they thought he would drop them. They grilled me later about "ruining the hunting op" which was just them in a gang. All good though. Not sure if tsoe is down there anymore. To lazy to look. They were a decent geoup to hang with though. Anyways im always down for a good 1v1 and that pilot was honorable although the guy who jumped in was not.
---
You became a laughing stock on [forum.eve-ru.com](https://forum.eve-ru.com). Now you're embarrassing yourself here
---
It is well fucking known how prolific of botters Kids With Guns are. Like do you even still play the game, or are you pretending to not know?
---
Incursions are still a thing, ad it is very likely we will be getting a new type of incursion very soon as well. Other then that you may look at NS ratting. carrier ratting is reasonably lucrative. The best ISK/hr is probably C5/C6 WH ratting, but that takes multiple accounts to do efficiently if you aren't doing it with friends. THe abyss is also a good source of ISK, something you may want to look into as it didn't exist when you stopped and is fairly fun as far as ratting goes.
---
I mentioned it only as an example of what could legitimately be considered unfair but agree that would be a bit extreme. Especially if they can track it through any level of laundering. Just removing the incentive to look the other way is enough. If a particular corp looks to be a problem then it's needs looked for more real evidence and dealt with according to what is found. Otherwise naming and shaming is sufficient.
---
Or Army of Mango when they move to Omist?? Botting much I see :)
---
TEST has always in their entire history tried to be blue with the #1 group in the game. First it was CFC, then PL, then Imperium again now.
---
More sig than speed, but I’ve heard of people doing that and using sleepers as their personal bodyguards
---
OH SHIT! THEY KNOW! QUICK DISTRACT 'EM!

HAPPY THANKSGIVING! HAPPY THANKSGIVING! HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

HED-GP. Killing like 500 dreads was so much fun

So, if you haven't run the Sisters of EVE Blood Stained Stars epic arc yet I'd recommend you do so. It should be easy to find through the agency window, and is a good next step after the career agents. After that there isn't a particular path to becoming a Caldari mission runner, but you can at least find an outline of missions [here](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=CategoryCategory). Also, do join a corp. If nothing else the best way to learn the game is through other players. [EVE University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_Universityhttps://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) is a great new player corp and will probably cater best to the type of game play you are looking for. They also have the most comprehensive wiki (though it is far from exhaustive).

*Citizen Cane claps!*
---
This guy fucks...
---
Bots fly asteros and supers just fine. Complexity just means the time to program them takes a few minutes longer
---
2/10 players on this sub have their keys rebound so they can function outside of an F1 organization.
---
I’m willing to sacrifice a Venture to try this.
---
Oh, I guess it would make sense that you’re back on TQ now. 
---
Thanks for making all those videos, they are top notch
---
Stop teasing ;)
---
Spacebar = D-scan
---
Tilde = Probe
---
Only way to live.
---
Eve Twitter tends to be a lot more chill than r/Eve though
---
Frat blows
---
Awesome fights! Now... show us that 5B pod you use....
---
Yeah I have similar stuff in mind. I can see how either direction could work vs bots.
---
In my case the hunting would be quicker via combat scans. The killing would be via a blops fleet.
---
In your case the hunting would be slower via dscan. The ship would be the scout of a fleet it's hunting for. Then again if you'll give it bad tank
---
My case has more general applications. It'd also perform better for tackling carriers. Yours would be a more specific case which can still do VNIs well.
---
WinterCo is only blue to Panfam during stratops, and Panfam usually doesn’t get called in unless Tapi is batphoning goons. I was in PH during most of the large battles between FRR and FI.RE/Tapi/Goons and pretty much every time we came goons were also backing up Test. I won’t say every time because I wasn’t on every fleet and didn’t take perfect notes, but for anything that looked important goons were always there if we were. 
---
And if you’re renting Omist from Test, you might as well be blue to goons. That’s much closer to the Horde/NC relationship than it is to WinterCo/Panfam.
---
Sadly I see that trend in my corp and other corps too. Not going completely dormant, but down to 4-5 active dudes in my TZ, from 20 just a few weeks ago.
---
And what tools does an alliances have to verify that a player is in fact a bot instead of a real human playing in a strange way?
---
Well appearently there are people that openly state not to report bots because of their tax money. That does sound a lot like they know.  
---
I do agree though that it would be nice if CCP provided some sort if guideline.
---
If you’re going on a fleet for the benefit of your alliance, it makes sense for the alliance to cover the cost of your ship. It’s not like soldiers have to buy their own equipment in order to enlist. 
---
Solo/small gangs ships you’ll have to fund yourself. Even casual fleets, or cheap doctrines where SRP would be a waste of everyone’s time, will require you to pay for your own ships. But even in PH, which has pretty bad SRP, anything t2 cruiser and up will be reimbursed if you lose it on a stratop.
---
That's wingspan.
---
*Grins* I am going to have FUN with this.
---
I'd be very surprised if anyone other than CEOs of botting corps says that. Even mittens was using other justification for not reporting them.
---
1) As a null empire builder, you can actually hang around your space instead of metagaming and ship spinning. It's not hard to tell botlike behavior. We as hunters can tell it easily. And then you have a chance to check if these people are on comms, or ask them questions in chat.
---
2) You have ESI access.
---
"Alliances can't verify whether someone is a bot" is basically people's way to meme out of their way from responsibility.
---
better default bio that rat resists.
---
I wouldnt suggest trying it, one of my friends got banned with a wave in 2016 because he sometimes used a bot for superratting for rather short amount of times.
---
He is the god of jump freighter' s.
---
not really
---
Oh man this is going to make teaching classes in eve sooo much easier

Start sweating bois
---
Meh, it doesn't help against curse and arazu.
---
Please don't make me like test leadership, that doesn't fit in my worldview
---
Noice!
---
They'll be hard pressed beating PL's own renter groups in bots-per-capita
---
TEST is not blue to GSF unless there is a stratops too.
---
And we are not about to rent a space to live.
---
Nc. Talking about botting renters
---
OK then
---
And when ccp pays my salary I'll take a look at my alliance in order to police them
---
You don't understand yet how this game works nor the scale of it.
---
Losing a destroyer when beginning can seem like a lot but you will soon make your first billion and buy 100 of them.
---
There is no endgame in Eve, it is not like other MMOs and joining a Corp will simply save you some unnecessary grinding without taking away any of the progression aspect of the game.
---
Trust the vets, read the wiki and you'll do good.
---
Wasn't he a diplo last time?
---
Pelligro right [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQNKhY7ws48)
---
I thought you plexed through passive income though.....
---
I missed all three of the recent large battles (ualx, x47, x47 again), but there was one fight I really enjoyed back during the Hisec war, while I was in Pandemic Horde. 
---
One of our Azbels has been reinforced, so we formed Ishtars to save it. I had just trained logi frigs at the time, and was flying a Thalia. We had a pretty small fleet, I’m not sure why, tbh, but only 28 dps and total, including tackle, less than 60. 
---
Anyway, we get to the objective, and sit tethered on it waiting for Test to arrive. They show up in eagles, with like 50 something eagles alone, not counting support. So, the FC says to set destination BWF and align outgate. Some new player asks what we’re doing, and when told we’re heading home because of numbers says something about a tactical retreat. Anyway, we warp and jump, only to find a bunch of Test interceptors in the gate. and their eagle fleet following. 
---
I’m expecting us just to accept the losses, but the FC calls to anchor up, and then to drop drones, which wakes me up pretty quickly. The eagles jump in, but they can’t get through the Ishtars with the t2 cruiser and logi legion reps, so they start going to work on our logi. We’re not really holding, but they take a long time for each kill, and several times switch to an Ishtar and fail to break it. Eventually, we’re down to 1 logi cruiser and maybe 3 t2 logi frigs, and we’re starting to bleed Ishtars slowly. 
---
However, suddenly the FC calls for the tackle stabbers to go in, and the enemy fleet is warping off. Somehow, despite the numbers, we’ve won. We quickly burn back to the gate, jump, and get on the structure while the dead reship in Jita. Test also reships, and meets us at the structure for round two. This one goes pretty much the same way, we bleed some logi but the Ishtar’s resists mean we barely lose any of them. And again, tackle goes in and grabs some kills for us as the Test fleet runs. 
---
They do reship again, but by now the structure has repaired, and they just stare at us angrily for a bit before warping off. 
---
I mean, that battle really meant nothing in the long run, but beating test, especially when we were so close to breaking as logi but somehow holding, that was a great feeling
---
Ah the good ol' CCP vs goons conspiracy theories. Didn't have that in a while
---
Whilst sniffing his own farts of course
---
I know it works with a Prospect. I'm a little skeptical about using a Venture.
---
sometimes you just stay because you have a chance to pop guy before he pop you. frigs and destros are cheap as f.  Fight like a man, die like a man
---
Ironic coming from a Test renter.
---
or Ctrl + mouse scroll
---
Imagine being 1337, everyone else is just a F1 Monkey, but at the end, HK still has no Keepstars anymore ;(
---
Das so lacist!
---
The thing is, that’s already removed. Even if bots manage to launder some isk by doing things like dropping cans in space and looting it with an alt, or purposely dying while bling fit and then looting the wreck with the alt, their taxes are definitely one thing CCP can track with 0 effort, so those definitely get taken back. 
---
So, people complaining about this either have no idea what’s actually going on, or are pushing for stupid penalties that would incentivize people to make ratting bots, stick them in hostile alliances, and have CCP go after them.
---
Rip
---
This is literally the most amazing thing I've seen in...ever.
---
Finally! some good quality posting on this sub. geez. its been too long since there was something ACTUALLY good.
---
I mean we weren't super organized, most of us got a pm from a fellow ngsc member about possible dread brawl, 18 inch erections arose from within, the plan was to have dreads at range but FC called for us to drop at 0  because we needed it. Drop at 0 amongst 20 neut geddons, erections become stronger, because not getting blobbed by 80 dreads. Even when the fight was over and I personally lost 8-10b I couldn't care less because I enjoyed it. And as one of the ngsc officers, welcome to tq, you should come visit us in Tama one day lol ;P
---
I wasn't gonna vote for CSMs this year.  
---
Why you gotta go and change that?
---
Alternatively you could just stop botting so you don't get on the list :)
---
Hey man, I just log on and have fun with my internet friends.
---
Know the feeling, i was the only active member for the last month
---
Some alliances have the mentality that it is better done in their alliance rather than their enemies because then they could gain the Taxes of all the botting, so in my opinion i think that it is a good step to put some responsibility on the alliances too. Now name shaming the alliance is a good and banning the boters is a good direction to take.
---
J-space*
---
FTFY
---
Obviously the plan is to load puppies onto all our ships, and then the triglavians wont shoot us because they don’t want to kill the puppies.
---
This makes me happy
---
Well its not everyday ccp runs to twitter to announce its sucking mittens dick either...
---
&gt;-1000 IQ (Faint Echo of an Energy It Was Tier):
---
&gt;CCP expands the security team
---
I'm gonna take this time to remind everyone that the security team always acts like it's criminally understaffed (never answers emails, doesn't seem to read a lot of reports, lets cases sit for 6+ months before review, etc). A few extra guys would really improve their response time and allow them to crack down on RMTers faster, which is crucial, because RMTers (hackers/botters) only need to operate for a few days, or a few hours if they're hacking accounts, to make a profit. And if they're making profit, they'll keep operating. 
---
Also they could probably set up an RMT report hotline for jita 4-4 RMT contracts and catch loads of in-progress RMT/hacking. I pretty routinely watch people get hacked, notice it before the hacker can strip the account, but the hacker is able to make off with the dude's stuff (destroying the victim's life and making a ton of RL cash) before CCP can respond.
---
i do - which gives ccp even more money than if i'd paid via monthly subscription from my bank account. 
---
having said that, with plex prices now it's getting difficult to plex via passive alone. not impossible, but the squeeze is definitely being felt.
---
Nice attempt at "no u" but you must be new to this sub. Getting flairbaited by an obvious meme account. NC. renters can eat as much shit as all the other ones.
---
They got even better! Can't wait to roast people with my occult from 18 km
---
Yeah, thats clearly giving it away. CCP hates goons!
---
Wasn't your entire post about taking the antibot fight to corp and alliance level and not just dealing with easily repleceable individual characters?
---
Somewhere else in this thread there was a guy mentioning having logs of i think a Red exec. Think it was Maulth, just ask him.
---
the idea off that effect is better yes but you would need to update it or it would just look out off place.
---
Hard Knocks and Odin's Call come to mind
---
Not really a fair move, as you said for security etc, but what if someone was located at a university for example and wanted to roll out a different IP so they can play their fav internet spaceship game
---
i feel like one indicator for investigation is very different from your analogy of four indicators for investigation but whatever be a retard lmoa
---
&lt;3
---
Those were the days
---
That's racist. Could be actual names in their culture. :(
---
i'm still interested in the split between alpha and omegas.
---
So hacs got a bonus to small weapons now?
---
Oh shit! What NC members will do now?!
---
Are you sure?          
---
They will no longer be able to do classic NC fleet move : "FC cannot go, cannot find the undock button"
---
&gt;PL's own renter groups  
---
Uhm... like which?
---
Apart from that offer in Amazon, I don't know any cheaper than 8-ish EUR per month when you do 12 months pack.
---
Maybe one time packs like the Galaxy one or if they release something else similar that contains game time+plex.
---
This is great, i really hope they do it!
---
You scared?
---
sry being lazy copied just the frigate stats- medium guns
---
tapi and ncdot shouldn't be banned from posting?
---
that would be interesting, also how long the char existed
---
ccp is dumb retard with shit game
---
I read that as bots-per-captcha
---
okay
---
do something about kwg
---
fuck the fact that eve is slowly dying, active null player count is dwindling, and there's far too many resources and too much space for us to have any actual reason to fill all of it and fight over it
---
I expect too much.
---
Given the amount of smoothbrains using their real flair, it's hard to tell these days
---
Maybe I should read usernames
---
Probably be issuing a smug alert later.
---
that's racist
---
looks like the frontend of a very old version of an Avatar.
---
I mean, that's what the kick button is for.  Anything else is just hurdurr
---
it would be difficult if not impossible to implement a firewall secure enough to keep out any possible connection from china without degrading service for everyone else
---
And yet you’re clearly engaged enough with the game to be in the subreddit for it
---
I generate my character names that way by randomly smashing keyboard. There is nothing strange in it.
---
you're not paying for that subscri...nevermind. semantics and i dont wanna argue with you, it's pointless and this is the internet.
---
anyways, i feel like CCP's stance is just "Dont tell people to not report suspected botters because they happen to be blues", which is a pretty fair thing to say. Any botting isk gets removed from the game, to include negwalleting corps and alliances that bots are in, and that's their "punishment", so to speak.
---
Everyone's looking way to much into this and creating mountains out of molehills.
---
and..... they are back
---
Nice article, here's hoping they come back.
---
Everyone miss old Aura voice. Why the fuck CCP changed it I sill don't understand after so many years
---
&gt; While the wallet is negative, the corporation cannot invite new players.
---
oh darn guess we'll just spend 1mil to make a new corporation
---
&gt;suspend the ability for ALL corporations within the entity to invite/recruit until it is paid off.
---
oh darn guess we'll just spend 1bil and make a new alliance
---
&gt; Everyone's looking way to much into this and creating mountains out of molehills.
---
too true.
---
there's no limit on how many corps can be in an alliance
---
I report bots whenever I see them and forward reports/petition ID's when they're sent to me
---
&gt;I bet if your corp wallets suddenly lost a hefty bit of weight and you know where that income came from and why you'd come on here and bitch and scream about it.
---
yes, because hunting bots isn't the player's job, it's ccp's, and punishing the players for not doing ccp's job for them is both stupid and insulting to paying customers
---
let's not talk about this anymore
---
There's only too much space because all the players are consolidated into blocs.
---
There's actually quite a good balance of space if those blocs were to be dispersed.
---
Eve's been "dying" for some ten plus years now, by the way. That mentality is cube-brain levels of counterproductive.
---
This gave me a chuckle.
---
There are going to be optimal uses for each ship, or optimal ships for each activity, right?
---
I heard you guys take hours just to create fittings that might improve DPS by 20 or something, it's hard to imagine a veteran PvP guild showing up in fleets of Imicuses.
---
\&gt;makes a racist comment about chinese people
---
\&gt;is chocoscoots
---
&gt;Hit me up if you have intel on bots.
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/AA-GWF](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/AA-GWF)  botting system with "Living breathing fuel block" corps VNIs "working" all day long.

Bring back old bridge animations too. The opening 'expansion' looked so damn cool.
---
Also make the Levi and Rag DDs look like not-shit. Erebus is your marker for a good looking DD. Please and thank you.
---
being against botting, being in a position to do something about it, being willing to do something about it, *and doing something about it* isn't enough
---
they have to be against botting for the same reason as you otherwise they're just as bad as those who harbor bots
---
okay bud
---
i too can scan HS wormholes and only fight on B274s racking up some sweeet sweet bs stats
---
have you ever run a rental program? or anything like it? what's your relevant experience that you are using to judge his laziness?
---
Even full agility fit you run into issues staying close enough to mine the cloud

First: don't give anyone, you don't trust 110%, director access to the corp.

Everytime i have recruits, the first Things what i ask. 
---
"Whats your experince in PVP.." ... after that question there is silence.
---
"Did you ever life in a WH ?" -&gt; "I scanned some sites."
---
"Do you know WH Mechanics ?" -&gt; "is there a difference to NS ?"
---
"Did you know, WH sites dosent respawn instant." -&gt; "WWWHHHAAAT !!!"
---
"Local dosent work, and dScan is your best friend..." -&gt; "Wtf?"
---
"Do you have SP in PI, Mining, Gas Mining, ....." -&gt; "I can fly my VNI or Carrier."
---
To many people look only after the ISK/Houre income, and want AFK ISK. 
---
So make low lvl WH class great again .... more Green sites ? own Little Event.... drifters sites ?
---
Bots will adapt, cheap fit+stabs+insurance+maybe t1 hull  and FTP model still allows bots to generate income
---
&gt; There's only too much space because all the players are consolidated into blocs.
---
if *all of goons* can live in delve and there are enough resources for them there, there is *zero* hope for the rest of the game to fill the remaining 90% of null
---
this is not even a discussion point, it's a trivial, understood fact that everyone but you apparently knows
---
resources are too dense and there is too much space for the current active player count to have any real reason (other than "we're bored and shooting shit is fun") to invade
---
this is such TOP bs it is CCP FUCKING JOB to root out bots  not to stike it to groupd todo that for them.
---
Works well for me, except it flagged my phone as "commercial use" so it boots me off after a few minutes.
---
I mean, I can't think of a single hull where you can use lasers/missiles at the same time. I mean, _maybe_ the Sac but why?
---
Kiki basically pumping out as much dps as a Vedmak, while going 2,900ms, at a further range, with better tracking lel. 
---
Also, Ikitsura and Nergal are going to be turbo garbage. 
---
Kiki, Drek and Leshak. The rest of the trig line may as well not exist.
---
Venture does work but since re-entering the site is a hassle the prospects cloak and extra cargo is super useful.
---
So is CCP GOING TO GIVE THE SAME TO THESE BAN AS THAY DID TO BRISK ???????? I CALL BS
---
fucking dumb post bs bs bs shit post
---
Hi, please use a neutral toon and look at the bots in fake esoteria under o-mczr.
---
Ah, here I am. I knew if i scrolled far enough I would find me.

*Ravens

Cornak, KWG are the most hard core botting group I know of (I did my research when I did my [C4K investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/579fed/on_the_healing_power_of_botting_carrier_ratting/)).  And KWG is under TAPI protection.  No amount of smoke and mirrors and Internet lawyering is going to change that.
---
Oh how the sword is double edged in these situations. I remember when a certain goon corporation got ther wallet wrecked by gms and suddenly became very good at killing and kicking bots in their corp.
---
When someone's little fortune is at stake, especially in this game they will go at any length out of self preservation to save their own ass.
---
So plug your ears and go "lalalala" all you want but you know it is true

You also run into people who do this just to call the hounds on your neighbour just so you get more sites, no matter uf its a bot or not
---
The amount of space a group can compact into is dictated by two things: Size of the bloc, and Jump Drive range.
---
Goons can live in Delve with all their toons because 90% of the region is within range of 1DQ. You don't see this in Detorid, Wicked Creek, Deklein, etc, because the ranges are too great for consistent Rorqual/Carrier saves.
---
You'll notice that Init has spread out from Fountain into Cloud Ring, even part of Pure Blind under the banner of LUCK. They can't reach all that space from J5A so they rent it out. Panfam can't jump into Pure Blind from SH1 so they don't even bother with it, and they can't touch half of Vale so they rent the entire region out. Notice a pattern?
---
The density of anom resources doesn't actually matter. Invasions with the intent to kill alliances have been happening this entire time and still are. Resource density is only an issue because of Rorquals and Sotiyos allowing blocs to churn out infinite supers. Anoms have been in the game much longer than that and the game was just fine then. The moon change from passive to active, on the other hand, was a fucking disaster and screwed up conflict in lowsec and NPC null, because those resources *do* actually matter, and that reason for invading *is* correct in those areas.
---
You're tunnel visioned on a symptom so you don't see the problem, and bandwagoning on the mob mentality you're reading on reddit doesn't make them or you right.
---
Let's just say the kiki is horribly OP
---
I'm not an expert in Chinese Internet law but I believe there are approved and unapproved VPNs, but I can't imagine government-approved VPNs would permit access to a site like Reddit. The copypasta is still kinda stale though
---
Krab drama is krab drama, if you've got that going on in your bloc that's a culture problem.
---
I literally made the change to 100% tax for my alt corp, because I read what you said you did in another thread earlier this month.
---
Why not both?
---
just look at fking BROADCAST
---
It’s a member taking the high ground tbf and something that should be public and addressed.
---
We all know which groups are “harbouring” botters and which groups are easiest for a botter to get into unbeknownst to said group.
---
It has been well documented that a decent portion of botting groups are paying to be blue with locals and that the locals knowingly turn a blind eye for what I can imagine is not insignificant amounts of isk even for alliances with super srp.
---
If that means that large alliances get their wallets hit hard at some point in the future for allowing these activities we can all sit pretty knowing more than 1 null bloc is going to get hurt in some way.
---
&gt; imagine how autistic you have to be to think monitoring and screening people for bots is a fun and valid form of gameplay in a video game lol
---
imagine how autistic you have to be to shit on the frat guy in the other thread who detailed all the work he'd done to hunt and purge bots from their rental alliance, causing him to burn out and want to quit eve, because he didn't do enough
---
Looks like you got brigaded
---
&gt; I am part of no major null block or large alliance powerhouse and play EVE with 1 character/account. You could say i’m an EVE casual, but i’ve accomplished much with just my 1 character.

So many effects used to be cooler. I don't think the designers understand that 99% of the time in PvP you will be zoomed out. Torp, smartbomb, arty effects were awesome now they are meh. missiles in general used to make more visible trails and keep flying out even when the target blew up, if the missile was in flight already, making awesome streams of missiles in fleet fights.
---
eve online can be a very tedious game, i'm all about little things that reduce my risk of carpal tunnel
---
wow they realy pushing the trig ships
---
Yeah. I was trying to ram a heli with my heli, did go completely different from what I was expecting.
---
Yeah rag and Levi dds are invisible in fleet fights. Should just make them either more beamy (like avatar and Erebus) or like a huge ball of energy that flies towards the target and is easy to see.
---
&gt; You're tunnel visioned on a symptom so you don't see the problem, and bandwagoning on the mob mentality you're reading on reddit doesn't make them or you right.
---
you're reading a point i'm not making, and deciding i'm wrong because of it. that actually does make you wrong, so
---
&gt;Goons can live in Delve with all their toons because 90% of the region is within range of 1DQ.
---
goons can live in delve with all their toons because there are enough anoms spawning within super range of their staging that they don't have to do any sort of organizational backflips to spread out or utilize more space to keep all of the krabs in a 15k+ member alliance safe
---
no other alliance is the size of goons. no other alliance has the resource needs that goons have in order to keep all their members happy. the fact that other regions aren't as system- or resource-dense doesn't matter because no other organization is as player-dense as goons
---
again
---
you think you understand my point, but you don't.
---
take some time, re-read my posts, and get back to me when you arrive

blaming players for what literally amounts to not doing peligro's job for him is *stupid*, and so are you
---
If you go to the store and see someone breaking the window out f a car in the parking lot, do you just go on shopping?  No, you call the cops. It's not your job to catch the guy, but it is your responsibility to report the crime and what you saw. If you get inside the store and some someone sticking a new laptop down their pants, do you let him just walk out? No, you report it to the manager. Yes it's the manager's job to prevent theft, but again, it is your responsibility as a person who shops in that store, as a person who doesn't want to spend 10% more for everything because people are thieves, to report what you saw.
---
If you want to stick your head in the sandy beaches of "My only job is to shop" that's fine, but you can't complain when crime runs rampant in the neighborhood because the only people trying to stop them are the ones who are paid and woefully overwhelmed.
---
I feel there are people who would totally name their character like that just for the mental image of such primary calling.

Alpha is literally an extended trial version, look at the restitutions they’re similar to the old trial version, Eve has always been a pay to play game just like WoW and others
---
&gt; No, you call the cops.
---
no, that's what store security does because.... shocker, it's their job, and the police don't need a duplicate call.
---
having a wormhole and assets at risks probably means they're more jspace than wingspan.
---
maybe wingspan would be taken more seriously if they actually dropped a citadel somewhere and put some skin in the game instead of just high sec diving.
---
wormholers, sure.  highly risk adverse with most fights on N110s and B274s, sure.  gotta do more than ganks to claim to be l33t wormholers with badass top killer eve-tracker.
---
For someone out of the loop, how has Briscgate ended?
---
I understand the difference between those groups , my obviously too subtle point was; at what point should CCP stop following the money trail, KWG pay TAPI and all the other groups and more (including my own) happily receive isk from renters that are clearly full of bots. The most important part of CCP Peligro’s vague statement is ‘where should the buck stop ?’ . I don’t know the answer to that but I am interested in that discussion.
---
What about the people who do have fun bot hunting?
---
Stop trying to make Eve into a job.
---
Can you do Ranger Regiment in Branch next? That alliance and region is riddled with chinese bots.
---
We took a whaling fleet up there and every time we entered a system the bots were all instantly in warp to poses.
---
one thing ccp loves doing is making charts and graphs.... and we all love reading them.
---
Have you ever heard the saying that as soon as you mention ww2 in an argument you instantly lose said argument ?
---
Unpopular opinion: it’s not players jobs to police their own alliance and make sure there’s no bots, it’s CCP’s (that’s what they get $130 a year per account for)
---
Obviously condoning bots is an issue but having a hands off approach should not be an issue for alliances.
---
What are you .... *Chicken?*
---
Greed is hell of a drug
---
Yes we **know** who you are...
---
...*Yes I'd vote for you, Hardcore*
---
\&gt;  "Local dosent work, and dScan is your best friend..."
---
Recruit L5 stealth bomber mission runners. Local doesn't mean shit when all 50 people are after you and d-scan is still your best friend.
---
Yeah the darker smoke they have now doesn't quite work.
---
To be honest it will most likely be a split going down from highest pop groups and decend from there with a few spikes disproportionate to member count (botting renter alliances etc)
---
Tbh I'd be OK with smartbombs being changed to Citadel pds effects.
---
Your point is the claim "there is too much space", which is the mob mentality and a fallacious view of a symptom to the actual problem. I'm seriously just repeating my previous comments saying that.
---
Did you actually pass your English classes or did your teachers just wave you past because they were ever so happy to be rid of you in doing so?
---
Legacy's combined numbers are actually quite close to Goons, and yet they control Catch, Esoteria, Feythabolis, Immensea, and Impass. Most of them could live in Impass alone if they chose to compact, but there are so many alliances in Legacy that each wants to do its own thing in its own space. Legacy lets each alliance do its own organization and handle its own resource needs.
---
Each of those alliances holding the sov they have would be super great, if they weren't all blue to each other. You'd see fighting all the time, all over the place, just out of proximity.
---
Resource density matters little in sov null, thinking otherwise was and is cube-brained.
---
Saying "you're dumb, go away" is really telling that you know you're just regurgitating what someone else wrote, and you're super insecure about it. You could have chosen not to add a comment to mine and kept your opinion to yourself if you didn't want to be told something you didn't want to hear. I won't judge you if you take this moment to improve yourself, even if it's internal and I never hear you say it.
---
Yes you have to find the right pace, not to fast and not to slow but it ain’t that hard.

---
Not disagreeing with you, but so is entitlement in video games.
---
It shouldn’t be up to alliances to police and detect bots as you have laid out in your paragraph about API keys. That’s what you pay CCP $130 a year per account for.
---
You mean removing the bot taxes and possibly negging the corp wallet as a result? Oh how everyone cried for harsher punishment and now it's being talked about it is tabooo
---
There's citadels in wormhole space. And most wormhole groups will fly subs that are worth far more than an insured carrier.
---
its hard to snag these bots anyways. real players die more in vnis than bots do.
---
No, what is unacceptable is expecting a paying customer to do the job that YOU are paid for! Banging the drum every now and again for the fight against botting doesn't speak anything on your own companies inability to fight against it.
---
I myself stopped reporting them years ago because it doesn't seem like anything gets done about them. There is still bots that I reported 5yrs ago still doing there thing every single day, so less of your shit peligro and either do the job that you are paid to do and not the playerbase who pays your wages.
---
Serious question, how bad would it be to just make botting legal?  At least this way legitimate players can compete with the cheating ones.  ISK from bounties skyrocketing would be somewhat self correcting I feel, prices would just rise across the board since everyone would essentially be botting now.  Minerals on the other hand seem like it might get out of control.  I personally wouldn't mind the price of anything thats mineral based being almost free though.
---
yeah that was a retarded example.
---
What I meant to unautistically say is that if you get a double high slot bonus you're probably not gonna split the damage 50:50 (though maybe it's worth it?)
---
doesn't splitting the vote ensure none of them make it though? Kinda like how wormholers split the vote and haven't had representation since noobman?
---
Dude you walked into a smokey back room that you don’t belong, back out slowly and cherish your innocence
---
There is a new promotional video from CCP on C-J6MT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUrhVHe7XUg
---
Maybe a skin commemorating the fights there?
---
Agree with everything except the pirate BS BPCs spawning, maybe make them spawn less but not outright move the spawn. It’s actually a tactical advantage to own some regions, for example TEST (as much as I hate them) manipulate the Nightmare market significantly because they buy the BPCs as an alliance. I agree they’re a bit too cheap but I think nerfing spawn rates is a better way to go about it. Also you don’t want them to be more expensive than capitals which is probably what would happen if you moved their spawns to lowsec.
---
I was under the impression you have ESI and it's 'easy to see bots with that' as you pretty much stated. It's your tax/rental income, your complicit with the botters. 
---
Either purge them or shut the fuck up as you are what you claim to hate otherwise
---
fucking gold.

also my sides have asked me to send you guys their greetings from Mercury.

---
I'm all for punishing bot's, I'm all for punishing the corp and alliances that profit, but I think there needs to be clear intent on the botters behalf to pay the corp/alliance before that happens, like  100 bots in a single corp with 100% corp tax is a no brainier, get em, that corp paying all its tax to a single alliance, no brainier again, hit the alliance too.
---
But nuking a whole corp of real players because 1 guy snuck in and was running 2 or 3 bot's for his own personal selfish gain , I don't think punishing the corp or alliance for that is fair.
---
Maybe.
---
Rip alliances of tens of thousands

So you expect law enforcement and store security to be everywhere all the time? Careful how you answer that because you are signing up to be followed or on camera everywhere you go in a store.
---
Cops can try to patrol parking lots and garages to prevent car theft, but they have to just get lucky to catch one. The only way to do better is hire more cops to do more patrols. Are you up for the tax hike it will take to do that? Even so, they can't be everywhere, all the time. Which is better coming out to your car gone, nothing but some broken glass on the ground or...coming out to cops already there getting a description of the guy who stole your car?
---
CCP just announced ~600 bans and names several organizations. They've issued the warning to organizations that harbor botters. These aren't the first bans. They have had many events in the past and have shown they ban some people almost every day for botting. They are not "doing nothing" They are looking everywhere for bots, just like cops look everywhere for car thieves, but it would be a lot easier to get rid of them if they knew they could look at this character in this system at this time and find a bot.
---
I'm pretty sure this skin was given out at the St. Petersburg fanfest, it commemorates the battle of C-J which was a strategic win for the Red Alliance.
---
No matter which way you slice it, if you look at the numbers, Wingspan has been one of the top groups in wormhole space, for the last year. Even occasionally beating out large groups like Lazerhawks.

Excellent work comrade. Btw there’s a guy in your Corp who you don’t really know and are not responsible for , he has been banned for botting and your Corp wallet has had all his taxes removed putting it into the negative balance. Your corporation has been rendered inoperable , Dreddit is recruiting.
---
 **If I could only hate one person, it would be** /u/shrrrrk **from reddit, because he** does the best in terms of making the entire "internet is for all ages thing hilarious" movement look silly, and also because he can make a joke about how he's actually "cool like that" to make people laugh. No, he wasn't even going to go for the literal "it's so fucking awesome" joke, I mean I have no idea what that is. It was pretty obvious, so we were cool.  
---
It would have been even better if they got some "I'm a troll, I can't do any of this stuff" reaction. Then it would have been easier to keep things like that to the side in retrospect, but I guess that's what we get with most of the stuff they get on /r/IAmA, or whatever it ends up being on these days. So, the "I'm not going to go there" meme was a bit lame to me. I was like "well, you should" if they were going to keep it up for the longest time
---
Funny timing, u/ccp_peligro. Ban a bunch of bots just after they move to GSF controlled space...
---
No they haven't. You're glorified day trippers. Jesus christ you people are fucking obnoxious
---
And WINGSPAN is a massive boon for the heron production industry. Keep churning those puppies out!
---
Given that you seem to have experience with ESI, how easy would it be to write some kind of script or program which detects bot-like behaviour (23/7 ISK ticks, etc - I don't know what botters do and how they play, but you probably have a lot more insight on this than I do), and then release it to the public?
---
if you have fun in a video game, it's still fun, and all forms of fun are equally valid - nevermind if it's hunting bots, hunting players in WHs, or market PVP.
---
Isn't hunting bots just another form of PvP?
---
No small weap is for af, heavy for hac
---
There doesn't need to be an incentive. Less carrot, a **lot** more stick. 
---
For instance, Goons will actively ban any player who has stated they've reported an in-alliance bot. That kind of policy is unacceptable, and something needs to be done about it.
---
Excuse me for being dumb as rocks but how would this be interesting?

if you are talking about near2 that is an intel channel checker. Not a ratting bot. I did not see any bot usage in that video.

I'm getting mails advertising botting software to my new characters, too.

Just to get a rough estimation on what Alliances or Corporations have the most bots. Maybe some of the higherups on the list could introduce better background checks

hmmm

Gaara's sniper got banned for bots, didn't he? I wonder how many more there were?
---
Its almost like CCP is full of shit when it comes to plex sales, I mean bots.
---
good info, when was this battle?
---
1) Just because the toon is 2 weeks old it doesn’t automatically mean that it has been spamming for the full 2 weeks (although I wouldn’t put it past CCP)
---
2) Just report the mail and stop complaining
---
The issue becomes that anything valuable enough to incentiveise people to hunt will be valuable enough to farm your own toons and be abused. like the FW thing a few years back where people were blowing up their own freighters full of trash they had forced up in value by playing with the market to pull something like a half trillion profit.

Oh a numbers wise breakdown of confirmed bots in those alliances. That makes more sense.

I am currently winning eve, not because of the state of the game but because of the state of my heart. All of life matters to me. All of life is connected and yet no one is happy with it. I am the victim of my past.
---
It used to be that people who have a bad streak often come to blame the opponent they played against. Some blamed Eve-O because Eve-O came from a very bad group. Some blamed Eve-B because Eve-B was actually bad. Some blamed Rorqual because Rorqual's bad streak was due to the fact that he had never won a game against other top teams.
---
We can talk about all the ways all game theory can help us win, but not every tournament match can be blamed on how players play, or how hard the opponent played in the match.
---
I think it is important to remember that it is not the match that can be blamed on the players but who won the match. You should talk about
---
I lost it at the 'but I still prefer other MMO' XD
---
I'd agree with most of this post if you yourself wernt harbouring corps like kwg. 
---
You can't say take it to a alliance level whilst ignoring your own it's a joke.
---
You ask in this thread for us to point out individuals.... While your argument is that it needs to go to alliance/corp level.
---
Your argument is invalid by your own alliance representation and looks like a easy grab for csm votes

Rorqual Alt + The Mittani god won that round for me!  +1
---
I was thinking that, yes.  The 5 years before then when they were botting was apparently fine...
---
I got mailed too, clicked on the website and it was already down, so CCP is probably working against them.
---
maybe you should tell some one who can do something about that, like ccp.
---
Mine passed the Turing Test

&gt; **Eve Online is dying because** of these two reasons: the fact that it's expensive and the fact that the game's gameplay is mostly about doing as little as possible and getting killed. The good news is that if we didn't have so much effort put into making it difficult for people to win the game, it would never exist!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I want to talk about some of the other reasons why the game is dying with time. First, the fact that Eve Online is an online roleplaying game and if we were to stop making it as difficult for players to win as possible, there is no reason why we wouldn't have plenty of great campaigns written about Eve Online that would attract players of even the most hardcore, and they would stick around. These are real players and the game still could use more players and the number of players in any given game is almost certain to go up as the community grows. With a more active community, an ever expanding network of players
---
 **In the Computer game Eve Online there are two types of people:**   
---
**1.** Those individuals who like action games  
---
2. Those who think EVE Online is very boring  
---
So let's define the terms to make our comparison clear.  So far we can't really understand why people want to play EVE Online and this means it is difficult to be able to tell those who don't play EVE Online and are too lazy to actually read what it is they are doing so when we do define the "active" people, this article will not touch on it.
---
I am telling people on reddit, who can put pressure on their leadership to do something. 
---
Dave why dont you pm a director and tell them that you dont like that you are taking money from botters from pb?
---
because i don't give a shit about renters in PB, and directors don't give a shit about me telling them, with absolutely fuck all evidence, that there are botters in PB.
---
on top of that, nobody in this scenario can actually do anything to prevent botting - as none of us work at ccp!
---

Glad ccp is throwing down on bots. Fuck bots.
---
Oh, probably not. I do remember toying around with a Phoon that was 5 Autos and 3 cruise missiles. It was... awfully bad.
---
rely on their true members. 
---
If i saw someone VNI ratting in my home pocket day and night, I'd report them to CCP and notify alliance leadership. That's all it takes.
---
If you hold more space than your memberbase needs so you rent it out anonymously and can't control what's going on there, that's your problem.
---
One more good reason to get rid of renting models.
---
Im glad somebody understands. Its tiring to see people sit on a high horse and say "its all &lt;insert whoever they are currently fighting&gt;'s fault. Ban em
---
&gt;At this point, it’s a game-wide standard to put in API keys when you join an alliance. These give a whole lot of information, and allow you to spot a lot of bot-like activity, as well as automate detection. 
---
This is CCP's job. They have had this data for 15 years.
---
*because i don't give a shit about renters in PB*
---
You dont give a shit that people are breaking eula and making the game **you** play worse due to inflated isk,plex and injectors? 
---
You dont give a shit that people bot which makes your fcs have a harder time finding content for **you**?
---
* and directors don't give a shit about me telling them*
---
Pretty much proves my point in OP, they care if multiple send them messages that they are not ok with it.
---
*, with absolutely fuck all evidence, that there are botters in PB.*
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1125796764148224001
---
Could give more evidence, however this is all the evidence you need
---
*on top of that, nobody in this scenario can actually do anything to prevent botting - as none of us work at ccp!*
---
Ask your director to kick botters in pb, camp their systems with nuetral toons, you are just refusing to take action.

Such gatekeeping. No wonder everyone hates wormholers.

Real question.

does test control LEG ESI and Corp recruitment?

I imagine not, which only leaves purging them as a whole or at least stop accepting money and providing support in any way.
---
Yea, i agree with that. lead with it next time lol
---
those are NC. renters, but I get your point.
---
&gt; "we dont care what our renters do, as long as they pay in time" 
---
They just can't keep track of all the corporation and their own recruitment, because it's not their job
---
i've seen 10 bombers rat in C6 red giants, but it doesn't seem worth it for instrus, just wait for the sleepers to spawn, orbit the cloud cloaked to see where orbit takes you, then decloak +40k away from the sleepers and autoorbit should be able to kite the battleships.

I don’t know regarding TEST internals and how they conduct their checks.  I would assume they have some sort of ESI access even if it’s just for security purposes. I’m not sure how to tax payments and rentals are calculated so I have no idea in that regard.
---
I don’t know any corporation or alliance inside Eve that will not accept ask for a rental regardless of the source. The main issue with tracking is ISK and what is via the ESI is the ESI back end of an application that said alliance and corporations utilise to integrate the members into that database.
---
Usually for honest corporations which is the vast majority of the members act as an internal check against dubious behaviour and potential rule breaking. This is because any accusations and proven rule breaking reflect badly on said corporation and sullies their name. Corp reputations as we all know are very important in Eve
---
Is the account online and generating ticks of isk longer than X consecutive hours. If yes, proceed?
---
He got banned for input broadcasting, not botting. Considering the insane amount of pve and mining multiboxers in Delve this is the next big problem after bots.
---
No one is telling them to them to actively spend hours roaming through their own space looking for botters on a clean toon, its just common sense whether a group bots and all it takes is a few clicks to set the group to -10.
---
Surely your leaders are able to log and use their mouse for a few seconds?
---
bro wtff i'm cutting myself on that edge
---
What a hypocrite :yikes:
---
I AM VERY PISSED THAT OUR ALLIANCE MAKES 1B PER ALLIANCE SINGLE PAYMENT PER RENTING CORP IN PB! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!
---
But he didn't have the heavy part in.
---
Go fly there and have a look yourself!
---
You can‘t do shit against spam in F2P games. The only thing that barely works is communications blocks on new characters and if you do that you piss off all the genuine newbies.
---
&gt;You dont give a shit that people are breaking eula and making the game you play worse due to inflated isk,plex and injectors?
---
since ccp are dealing with them - what is there to give a shit about? the issue is being dealt with.
---
&gt;You dont give a shit that people bot which makes your fcs have a harder time finding content for you?
---
my FCs don't seem to have any issues finding content for me. I get more fleet pings than i know what to do with.
---
&gt;Could give more evidence
---
anecdotes are not evidence. a tweet by pelligro saying he has banned some one isn't a piece of footage or such that directly demonstrates a bot in operation. i could link a useless fucking tweet anywhere i want. i haven't seen any bots to report, let alone have any proof that what i witnessed was botting. i am not saying bots do not exist, we all know they do, i am saying that i possess 0 credible material that would assist ccp in identifying them.
---
&gt;Ask your director to kick botters in pb, camp their systems with nuetral toons, you are just refusing to take action.
---
making the move to another renter corp doesn't stop them; case in point how the fuck do you think they ended up in period basis? because goons camped the shit out of the renter regions in the north - it doesn't stop them it just makes them move.
---
Eh wingspan is basically the equivalent of code. No one pays them much mind and they run as soon as anything shows up to fight them lol.
---
The putting pressure on your leadership isn’t going to work unless people are actually willing to leave their alliances. For the most part The major null block leaders do not give two shits what the line bro thinks. They’re just a pawn.
---
&gt; No one is telling them to them to actively spend hours roaming through their own space looking for botters
---
erm, that's exactly what you're telling them to do?
---
I still get 45+ but a new pilot with tech I fighters to level III/IV I'd guess 35..ish?
---
"vote for me so i can disregard the health of the game and push my own agenda because reasons"
---
not a platform i'm interested in supporting, to be honest.
---
Always regret being gallante on ammo give aways.  Should give us drones instead
---
there's always the choice to use the old map (alt+f10 if i remember correctly) and then sorting by "Average pilots in space in the last 30 minutes"
---
People looking for excuses usually are part of the problem.
---
&gt; Adding CAPTCHA to every anomaly.
---
Why not just update the mini-games and incorporate CAPTCHA like algorithms into their design?
---
https://giant.gfycat.com/ShamefulPeriodicIvorybilledwoodpecker.webm
---
Literally any renter real world or otherwise would say same thing. I cant control other people. Thays why we have police(ccp) to handle amy unlawful things being done. Im just the guy gtn paid.
---
Imput broadcast, not boting, it s better, but still cheat.
---
Yeah it could be great for the leadership of alliance to have this info, because isk will be confiscated.
---
Everyone who is actively or passively benefiting from botting is a fucking asshole and part of the problem. There is no excuse for any of this and people should be perma banned imho.
---
The incentive should be not to cheat and lie - something any decent human being should value, be it in real life or in a game.
---
It's not racism. Botting and cheating in games is legal in China. If you have a subscription game (like EVE), you are - legally - **not allowed to ban** cheaters.
---
You could perhaps perceive this as being anti-Chinese Government (and they are basically the Nazis, concentration camps and all). And there is nothing wrong with that. Nothing at all. In fact, if you weren't anti-Chinese Government, I have to question your ethics and morals.
---
Back in the day with the old version of escalations we used to rat with bombers in a c6 red giant. Good thing was that it's 100% safe, but way more tedious than just normal dread ratting.
---
It's still automation, basically just a step away from botting. 
---
Multiboxing without broadcasting is fine, obviously, because the player has to control all of those accounts manually.
---
TBH, the only kind of automation acceptible in multiboxing is something like Eve-O Preview which is just a window manager.
---
Heroes!
---
Yeah thats funny xD
---
I just get a bit triggerd if ppl agree with his post. 
---
he is happy as fuck about the income and since ccp says that alliances will be punished, he plays the little victim. He should take the punishment like a real asian man.
---
If your renting out your spare room to a known druglord who uses your room to package drugs and you happily accommodate him, are you guilt-free?
---
there are people who play this game that are younger than this game
---
something to be prideful of
---
Who said id accomadate him. U act like he would write that on his application. Lmao. U think botters are relling people "hey im botting 30 accounts. I meed a place to go" fuck no. Lmao.
---
You should probably describe your ideas in a bit more detail if you expect feedback for them... "WH Low Class (C1-C4) Event" doesn't really mean anything
---
Time for the pandas to go hide
---
Not my CSM.
---
I thought you guys were moving to Omist though
---
This is one of those beautiful things that I love about EVE.
---
Whenever I interview with press about our community, one of the things I love talking about is how much you guys fuck with the things we put in game and use them in unintentional ways.
---
It's been hard to find a solid example of this because you need to understand EVE in depth to appreciate most of the examples I could give, however this is something that translates really well because it's such a simple feature that can be used in such a smacktalky and unintended way.
---
This'll be the example I use in future... haha, amazing &lt;3
---
Old torp effect was amazing too &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Who pays for the server strong enough to run SEAT on a massive renter alliance? Not to mention the man hours to trawl the tokens. I'm £80/hr out of office hours btw.
---
its not up to players to police their own space for bots, thats what you pay CCP $130 a year per account for (amongst other things)  
---
policing and encouraging botting are two different things
---
see https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1125796764148224001
---
no.
---
/u/Cornak Every single KWG/renter system in Feytha/Omist space with 4 gilas is a system occupied by bots. Clear up your backyard first then start running for CSM under "ban all the bots and their overlords" banner.
---
IMO CCP should start nuking the main alliances that profit from botting. So basically all the alliances that rent space or profit from renting space. 
---
No sane person would rent a system nowadays. You can live in null for free, without paps and basically do what you want, be it mining/ratting/indy/pvp. The only reason for folks to rent a system and pay 2-5b for it per month is so you have exclusive rights to it so your bot won't break when a blue warps to the same anom as you or your bot won't be detected by a curious blue.
---
In well populated null systems, where multiple real people play there can be no bots, as the locals will easily tell em apart and report/awox em. In secluded, private null systems there will be bots.
---
So your saying that you are not able to look through a corp api to see  if the toons inside are bots?
---
it takes very little effort to see if someone bots if u have a corp api
---
Not it's not dumb, you are a dumbass.
---
You shouldn't be able to get easy in a nullsec alliance just because you know someone!
---
Nullsec is where the the most lucrative bitting happens and where alliance and Corp leaders should take  priority on checking members history.
---
I cracked at "Nullsec Carebears" but lost it at "The Mittani"
---
WH is the hardcore's hardcore.
---
Remember, no goon-fucking
---
right.... i wish there was an audio option to use old aura
---
https://youtu.be/9WkYqWn3HSQ
---
About 2006 but that system has been won by red and lost by red acouple of times. Usually a last stand battle happens there.
---
That's not true at all. STV means your vote is transferred if your primary candidate is eliminated. So you can always vote for your most preferred candidate without worrying about your vote disappearing if they don't get elected. Therefore it makes complete sense to put other players that represent you as your #2 #3 etc. and make a ballot.   
---
Wormholers would have gotten a Candidate last year if they were not tribal and instead used the STV system. Here is an example from last years election  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/CbuK1N2.png](https://i.imgur.com/CbuK1N2.png)
---
Tifida (A Russian outlaw/inner hell wormhole candidate) recieved 305 votes (with no other choices)  
---
EzookiZ recieved 249 votes (with no other choices)
---
So these votes went completely into the void when both candidates were eliminated. ExookiZ got eliminated in the penultimate round of the election, losing to /u/tikktokk by just 5 points. If the wormholers had put their tribalism aside then ExookiZ would have been in the final round, and with all the other votes he would have gotten (not just +305), there are others in the data set you can see, he would have been elected into the CSM.  
---
0.457075 votes to "Tikktokk Tokkzikk"
---
Pre-elimination tally:
---
2099 "Suitonia"
---
1914 "The Judge"
---
1439 "Tikktokk Tokkzikk"
---
1434 "ExookiZ"
---
Elimination: "ExookiZ" with 1434.647373 votes
---
[https://i.imgur.com/13pSuyS.png](https://i.imgur.com/13pSuyS.png) (more votes)  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/8TRk9eS.png](https://i.imgur.com/8TRk9eS.png) (more votes)
---
\^ just as some other examples, there are more with different combinations but are only worth 1 vote. It all adds up though   
---
Also, if ExookiZ survived the penultimate round with Tikktokk, he would have also gained more votes freed up from voters who placed him after tikktokk, [Notable Example: +48 votes.](https://i.imgur.com/2fzPKJs.png)
---
hm, that neut powergrid reduction was pretty handy but this is better
---
Whilst I agree WH’s are indeed awesome and yes fuck nullbears,I don’t think this much of a platform.
---
The new map is garbage. No thanks. I will stick to Dotlan.
---
It’s an Easter egg. A visual effect which appears on the jita-perimeter gate. It’s triggered by something but to my knowledge no one has yet figured out what. It is incredibly rare.
---
That won't stop bots for long, sadly.
---
They are easily capable of ratting in a caracal, for example.
---

---
Doesn't the CSM have and advisory role on this type of issues?
---
Cause thats how i wanna soend my game time. Im sure thats what goons wants to do all day as well. Check on their renters constantly. Its CCPs job to catch prevent botting. Not goons ext ext. I dojt even like goons. But this whole thing expecting them be the police of eve is just insane.
---
Don’t be dumb if you have a list of « known druglords » in eve just report them to ccp. Having the rental manager to kick them on sight doesn’t do shit as they will just move elsewhere.
---
So you are telling me that in PvP Online people would just let neuts rat in their space while botting rather than kill them and pad their killboards? Also virtual machines and virtual private networks can easily be detected and players banned. The only issue here is they would have to whitelist Wine which could potentially be used for evil but all Mac and Linux users would suffer if not.
---
In this situation Alliances don't currently have an incentive to chase down botting in the space they control. Same reason the IRS will fine you if you get caught there is no incentive to cheat unless you won't get caught.
---
Last KB activity was in October 2018.... fantastic
---
Great idea.
---
If it's so easy, why don't you write some open source software to do it? It's easy, right?
---
You can do your buy orders in a nearby player owned station with lower taxes if you have the right skill, visibility I think.
---
That would be interesting.
---
Yes we do.
---
Here's the math: https://i.imgur.com/3BN888Z.png

What if I have &gt;!directional scan!&lt; bound to a different key? FC wat do?
---
&gt;Wormholers would have gotten a Candidate last year if they were not tribal and instead used the STV system. 
---
&gt;Therefore it makes complete sense to put other players that represent you as your #2 #3 etc. and make a ballot.
---
Dont these two statements contradict each other though? Help me understand cause I'm confused now.
---
They couldn't do an alliance tournament this year so they're taking another approach for the prize ship handouts
---
No they do not.
---
They could actually being doing nothing. At least this is something. Just saying
---
It has now been renamed "Red Meatgrinder"
---
Im not trolling, im genuinely confused. If tribalism lost exzoo the seat, how is it better to spread the votes instead of backing one candide for one niche "cause"?
---
The people who put Tifida as #1 and no other candidates listed (2 through to 10). If they had put ExookiZ as their #2 (or indeed any other number from 2-10 aside from tikktokk) then those 305 votes would have been transferred to ExookiZ when Tifida was eliminated.   
---
The "Tribalism" is using only slot 1 on your vote, and not putting anything slots 2-10. When if your candidate 1 gets eliminated, your vote would have transferred up the chain.
---
Just dont grind your plex that's only reserved for veteran with X mining alt or carrier,super farm / WH farm with dread + skill farm   
---
a newbro can only burn out and hate the game trying to plex, the plex is a lie
---
Ahhhh okay, i get what you're saying now. Like, they literally only voted for one person and no other slots.
---
&gt; Make all rats point/scram (but only the ratter)
---
muhahahaha.  this is pretty much the epitome of roamers.  I WANT PVP, but at absolutely zero risk to myself.
---
ah with this mornings update nice...
---
They probably want to see who takes the hook.
---
nice info man thank you.
---
It's the same image four times. I dont get it.
---
Same here, didn't had any problems at all. Super alts are already perfect carrier alts (If you are living in a C5/6, nice for rolling) and training Titan alts into dread pilots does not take long. If you are living in a C1 - C4 having multiple accounts to roll holes with ist super useful.
---
10MN and agility on a frigate just can't ever be together
---
All of 'em aren't seen much these days
---
Most bots don't do it 24/7 anymore, they just run for shorter periods. CCP must be using some automated mechanism to determine if someone is botting, before they get flagged for review. It's just a matter of making that visible somewhere in a form of probability indicator
---
no. its a form of pve.
---
hah
---
A big part of eve is how you fit your ships. If you’re struggling with the level 1 missions it sounds to me like you haven’t got your ship fit quite right.
---
How was your ship fit? If you go to the interactions tab on your character sheet you should be able to see your loss mail and copy and paste the contents here) we can then give you some advice.
---
I presume you were flying a Caldari Destroyer? Corax or Cormorant?
---
If you were killed on the way to a mission, did it take you into low security space 0.4 security status? These systems will appear orange on the autopilot and should pop a warning before you jump a gate if you’re a new player.
---
Here are some useful links;
---

---
Wormholer btw
---
Friendly reminder that this is literally CCPs job and why you fucking pay them.
---
Thank you.
---
I approve of this and his name is u/StainGuy
---
Hence the blue loot or tags/lp instead of isk.  You can rat for hours or hunt ratters for the same amount of value but in a fraction of the time, with the added bonus of shiny killmails and potential PVP.  If it happens to be a bot you kill, then so be it.  Make it trivial to convert the loot/lp to isk as to inconvenience real ratters as little as possible.
---
&gt; Let me remind that virtually every group does this 
---
No? The groups that do this were mentioned by you in your 1st sentence, these are basically 95% of all Nullsec Sov (their renters and pets included).
---
Show me any Lowsec-Region with botting activity. As I experienced in 12 years of EVE, bots reside in Nullsec or Hisec. 
---
Lowsec Groups have renters now too (as Lowsec PvP-Players do not like to mine their R64, but still need the income), but these mine Moons or run Lowsec Missions, something I have never seen bot behaviour take place in. You cannot bot Burner Missions atm, or Incursions, or Lowsec Moon Mining without regionwide Intelbots and Theta-Squad-Umbrella ...
---
Yus!
---
The hero we deserve!
---
?
---
I thought EvE player's head is 100% tungsten, with no space inside
---
Like WTF, how many times did i posted this.        
---
Bob (or to be accurate Citizen Bob) is one of the main citizens in Sansha nation managing the wormhole generators we use.          
---
His sense of humor is quite strange (but he is brilliant!) and he often play tricks with minds of people in the WH space.
---
After some discussions it would probably not be outright removal from DED's (LP stores would still sell them), but would most likely be a more significant nerf to drop rate. Such as 25-50% reduction and then moving a % of that drop rate from DED's to lowsec.
---
just like the fucking mittani? the one that needs no evidence cause hes the fucking mittani!?  
---
every major nullsec alliance harbors bots, goons do it as well and we all know it, so i just can hope CCP hammers your alliances for all the economic damages caused by bots over the time which you willingly accepted in the sake of the arms race
---
There is only one true God! and His name is Sansha Kuvakei!
---
ITS A FULL ARMED BATTLESTATION
---
Thats true. Thx, i will write a bit more to this idea.
---
I bound mine to a little contact patch on my chest that measures my heartbeat. Literally gonna spam it till I die.
---
So is it confirmed this isn't just a bug?
---
Because that is actually really cool.
---
No it's a subscription game
---
Why are boosh ravens a problem?
---
It's omni tanked which you can change with resists but frankly, it should work fine. Has all damage types on board and the most important drone damage types.

FW bots, mission bots, hauler mission bots and exploration bots would like to have a word with you. Low sec botters are people too
---
&gt; You cannot bot Burner Missions atm
---
yes you can, it would be incredibly trivial to code
---
Everyone should live in w space for at least 6 months. And I mean LIVE there, not hang out while ratting null on another screen. It will make you better at Eve.
---
The “Children of Light” Chronicle there explains the lore of the Lutins and how different cultures perceive the phenomenon.
---
damn straight
---
It would be good if we could get CCP some alliance or corp level tools that can help combat it. ESI mini-SEAT that would flag potential 24x7 wallet/bot behavior. That would be pretty cool instead of trying to find someone to program it.
---
careful with that thing haha
---
Use frentix for that extra optimal :)
---
I offered him a way out:  stop renting out systems.
---
Yes, and even farther back are some Naflgars or however you spell it
---
Frankly, when talking about winning EVE I expected something different :P
---
About a 2 years ago I finally won EVE for good, I hoped. A short while ago I dipped my toes in the pond again and fell in, again. I guess I'm just an idiot and a masochist.
---
* who has stated they've reported an in-alliance bot
---
Yes, no nothing needs to be done about it.  The key point is it was stated, not reported.  Stating it makes absolutely no difference.  Reporting it is key.  If you're stating it, i.e. making a fuss about it or having a "look at me mummy" moment and creating drama, you risk a ban whatever the issue (CSM voting, Ochre rule and so on).  Basically if you're a pain in the arse to directors, you get shot by Wibla.  This is true in many alliances.  Not just Goons (not the getting shot by Wibla part).
---
&gt;~~Skeez on chicks~~ Reap rewards
---
10/10
---
No. There are very good reasons for players not advising on ban policy.
---
No, they'd just let the blues rat in their space while botting.
---
Maybe CCP should just say that due to tremendous capsuleer victories throughout New Eden,  the pirate factions have been forced to move operations to withdraw their operations into covert locations in wormhole space. (which require probes scanning)
---
&gt;dissent bad! all hail great leader! kill all those who disagree!
---
yikes, is this really goons in 2019?
---
fuck it, just rollback to 2012
---
Inb4 meta bots join alliances pre war just to crash wallets.
---
I'm pretty sure the stream of data available via. ESI could be processed by a little Tensor math, and some Deep Learning algorithm applied to it.  Such a tool should be made available by CCP.  I'm pretty sure it would be 95%-99% accurate, allowing you to acquire suspects.
---
As I said elsewhere, all you need is all the ESI info over a period of time from known botters and a bunch of the same data from people known non-botters + add one graduate student and some DLAI libraries.
---
Who dares to forget the D845!?
---
I'm not sure how to interpret that info, is it possible to get a bit more detail?
---
Got my vote
---
That's not a bad idea though is it.
---
Hahaha excellent!
---
We all know the real reason is so we can shitpost and meme each other about how morally superior we are to each other because the other guy had 5 more bots than I did.
---
I can't wait personally.
---
Nah, that's pretty common. It seems winning eve is mostly a temporary thing.
---
Not the hero Eve needs, but the hero Eve deserves??
---
If CCP had the chops to develop that kind of software, why would they release it to the public? They could just run it themselves, and without the database view that we, as players, have to use.
---
Hauler Mission Bots I encountered exactly 2 while living 4 years in Aridia, FW Bots are an Issue true, exploration bots tend to use more profitable regions like Sansha-Nullsec-Space.
---
&gt; it would be incredibly trivial to code
---
I am intrigued how you would manage the heating of modules (heat damage distribution is randomized to a degree), or the common use of multiple puller alts needing to give mission warpins, the cherry-picking of missions. Also without Impotency-75-Booster usually you run out of missions after 1 or 2 hours, why should somebody bot this ?
---
Imagine logging into a game to run around it to police it lol.
---
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
---
Let the small gang roamers rejoice!
---
This is gold
---
CCP should fine the alliance and Corp that the bot is in. 10x the total isk produced + the cost of plexing the alpha accounts for it's entire lifetime.
---
Mining bots should result in confiscation of ships equal to 10x the mineral value.
---
Harbor bots, get fucked.
---
n1 CCP! great work
---
why is it always the really shitty wormholers who use the term "nullbears" when in reality they are worse than your average null line member
---
[Such a shame we don't have any data to back it up... Such a shame indeed.](https://youtu.be/21HkA0Suvvw)
---
Just look on Dotlan. You can see the dips.
---
If you want to be the CSM you better pass the frustration about botting from players to CCP not the other way around.
---
No player deserve to do those ESI shit all day everyday to do what GM should be done. Not mentioning CCP can easily query their database while players has to fight with all kind of access issues and rate limiting for ESI.
---
It's like CCP has been spoiled to the level that they start to yelling to players to stop the botting, which fucking game company do that? Every single person in CCP's security team deserves a PIP on their head so they can stop fucking around and do their fucking moonshot awesome bot detecting framework and simply start fucking querying their database.

This is a nice improvement, I wonder if it's enough for them to see use over the Kikimora and Drekavac. The long spool-up is still too long to be good, but at least they are not as ranged handicapped anymore. 
---
The HAC shoots out further then the Battlecruiser (assuming max skills). Unfortunately the AF still cannot shoot occult from outside scram range, but using mystic and meson should be a bit more comfortable. We will see if it's enough to see these ships used.
---
I have been playing eve online for twelve years now. Botting has always been a problem. If CCP aggressively goes after bots like they have done in the past this will leave an impact on those alliances that allow botting.
---
I was thinking the same thing, or cyno maybe
---
Doesn't mean you live there. I had 70 kills in HS at burn jita, does that make me a HS resident?
---
*yawn*
---
The screen fades black. Skyrim opening scene begins
---
Whilst initially I agree. And any alliances that knowingly turn a blind eye to botting SHOULD be punished, a system like this would be so open to abuse.
---
\+1 buddy

I haven't done this and know I'll forget and will be hitting V and not realizing it isn't doing anything when a gang lands on me. Keeping V and my mouse bind.

Thank you, do you have a version with hyperspatial and a faster prop mod ?
---
you clearly don't know what you're talking about. i am unironically agreeing with querns right now, because of how dumb you are.

people need to stop posturing and touting solutions they have no intention of doing themselves. it's CCP's game, we're their customers, they need to fix it.

because i don't get paid to do it, in fact i pay to play  
---
fuck off with this retarded holier-than-thou narrative. if you want to log in every day and police bots then go ahead, but you are literally paying to work for ccp and that is dumb. this is a game
---
Wait, is there a real effect you can go see at the perimeter gate? And how rare is it to see the effect?
---
Also OP, how did you come upon this?
---
It was 5 Trillion ISK, that explicitly GoonSwarm made with that exploit, beeing clever enough to launder all the ISK out before they reported that as "Bug" to CCP. In fact some of the people taking part managed to overwind their LP counter ....

/r/eve logic is getting on a moral pedestal and demanding that other people pay to do mindless admin work that you don't and won't do yourself.  
---
it's on ccp to fix botting, and people need to stop posturing and saying otherwise
---
Indeed, they could.  They should.  It's an interesting project for an undergrad dissertation.
---
yeah it's an average floater among the other turds
---
warping gate - elka - Christmas tree
---
Half of it is on CCP, the other half is on us, the community to stop supporting them. Easiest way to do that is to report them when you see them and don't buy RMT'd ISK.
---
shhhhh
---
I have not gotten one.  Guess I am lucky I suppose.

Learn to identify some hotspots where players tend to be located - namely, gates, faction warfrare plexes, ratting anomalies. Anoms tend to spawn close to the sun. So when you enter system:
---
1.) check d-scan to see if anyone is close to your in-gate
---
2.) if the tun is not close enough to be on d-scan, warp somewhere close to the sun, and d-scan again
---
3.) warp to out-gate and d-scan a final time
---
Presto, you've just eliminated 90% of the possibilities where you might have found ships. Anyone you didn't see on d-scan is almost certainly either docked, or cloaked, so just move on. I've found this to be a nice balance between thoroughness and speed when hunting in various types of space.
---
Every alliance has bots.  No alliance allows them, this is a game.  It is literally CCP’s job to solve this problem. We have other jobs outside of this game  we can help them but at the end of the day they have the tools, resources and time to fix it as much as they can.
---
Is there another alliance out there with 30k members and no rules?
---
Is the video still "processing" on YouTube or did you really upload a video in 360p?
---
Its processing :)
---
I concur, I won EVE for about 8 months, just to have returned again this week.
---
Yeah, literally after commenting I refreshed again and it was 720p :)
---
Of course you need rules in any alliance or even any corporation. To even pretend that rules aren't requires is ludicrous.
---
However, the argument you present is a false one.
---
There is a big difference between "Ochre first" - which is fine, there's a good reason for that - and "Any dissent means an immediate ban", which only exists for the benefits of the directorate.

---
CCP Peligro is fighting the good fight, but can he alone handle the influx of new pro botting players from the chinaland servers?
---
Very rare and no one seems to know the trigger
---
To be fair, if you were a Serpentis battleship commander in an anomaly with a VNI running it and killing all of your allies - and then a ship warped in and started tackling and shooting the ship that was killing all your mates, you wouldn't kill your only chance at surviving, would you?
---
Can't forget CCP-US :D
---
Im sure he will appreciate the 2 votes I-TS generates.
---
But I didn't say "any dissent means an immediate ban", so you're the one who's fucking strawmanning.  
---
The rule is "don't be a dickhead".  There are 30,000 characters in Goonswarm.  IDK how many individuals that is.  Let's be generous and say 5,000.  That's 5,000 people sharing mumble, alliance/corp chat and so on.   How do you prevent daily or even hourly "drama" with that many people?   Directors don't want to deal with it.
---
Hilarious how half the racists today are just people who frame every narrative by race and then complain that race is the narrative.

Can't make fun of Goons if they ban market bots so they won't bother talking about it here.

---
People manage to bot exploration, coding burners is piss easy in comparison. 
---
All the issues you lay out are easily solved by in game mechanics. I'm not saying burner bots are running right now but the main reason people don't is because mining and ratting bots are easily availble, not because technical limitations.
---
Okkk bois time to take your bet... which alliance has the most bots which got banned?        FRT/TEST/GOONS/INIT/RR/DARKNESS/....
---
FW bots could do with a banwave the Jackdaw menace in placid is mental
---
I guess I never understood the point. Why do WHers care what "nullbears" do? "We're in here playing super hardcore elite mode and you're all on easy street" (That's how cool kids talk now, right?) But so what? Same thing with local. "We don't have local and do just fine!" Ok, so do that and enjoy it. Is someone trying to add local to WHs? Why is what happens in 0.0 a concern?
---
tl;dr because nobody has time to read an entire wall of text, wtf OP
---
1) **use intel programs**, CCP hasn't banned them yet and any alliance worth your salt has an intel channel that a intel program can parse. they will have discussion of roaming gangs as well as anyone coming your way.
---
2) **close all wormholes**. sorry WH bros
---
3) **have a cyno + fuel**. make sure your fuel is in the right inventory
---
4) **be in standing fleet**
---
5) **be in comms**
---
6) **dont be afraid to speak up in coms if you are tackled**, speak clearly, describe the amount of ships on grid and if they are onlining a cyno inhibitor
---
7) **don't use the chat channels that circulate in alliances where people communicate what signatures they are going to**, spies use those channels to send hunters logged-off in-system the right anom to warp to to catch you
---
8) **set your NSA to auto-cycle off**
---
9) **the moment you land on grid, align to a citadel you can dock in**. repeat, CITADEL YOU CAN DOCK IN.
---
you can now carrier rat. wow, you are now absolutely just the worst, total scum.

I would’ve thought since the last public lynching CCP Security did on a certain CSM member, they’d want to use a lighter public display this time..... guess I was wrong.

I mean, i suspected a guy was botting when renting with NC.

Got some solid evidence of it (namely drag bubbling his pos and seeing if there was any response). Sent evidence in. Corp kicked.

---
How many stabbers does it take to bump a refinery out of orbit?
---
Sure you can overcome technical barriers with effort, but atm it is just not logical and efficient to use Burners for botting. On availability it is clear that something that makes only limited sense / is not efficient as other ways is not easy available. Also If it is like you say, why are Incursions not botted yet? You can use illegal input broadcasting for multiboxing them, but bots would fail ...

"Yes her name was Sarah. You have a mom and a dad, right?"

She smiled for me. "That's right, all three of them. Not just one, but three sisters."

That's not "don't be a dickhead", that is "dissent mean an immediate ban".
---
So wait - obvious question is obvious:
---
This whole thing is about how corps/alliances are supposed to police themselves.  SO how is trying to police other corps/alliances policing your own?
---
CCP are bad about many things, but banning real people because they mistakenly thought they were a bot is not one of them.
---
it's all on ccp, because it's their game and we pay them. there is nothing we can do that wouldn't be easier for ccp to do, except work for free. i hate the bot inflation, and I'm even OK with ccp tracing and deleting the botted isk. anything beyond that is bullshit though

I would say for me it is the defense (attempt) of [UQ9](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/UQ9-3C) back in the middle of WWB/Casino War. Not because the fight was so awesome, actually it was pretty disappointing seeing the Imperium outside of my alliance with a formup of "only" 500 dudes, while our enemies came with roughly 2,5k guys iirc.   
---
But I was super proud of FCON on that day, cause we alone had formed up around 500 people. And even more, I was proud of my own work. I was the POS team and also the SOV team manager at that time and had organized and put up myself most of the towers and cyno jammers and everything. And in that battle, all the hours of work done prior finally were worth it. And although we lost, I felt it was a good defense attempt and that my doing was a big part of it.  
---
And last but not least, I had a lot of fun shooting Horde newbies with one of the POS I gunned ... probably shot down 30+ guys. Ahh, good times :D
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/Et0yTJg](https://imgur.com/a/Et0yTJg)
---
i don't think anyone has a problem with ccp tracing and deleting botted isk. but the noises coming out from ccp, notably at evesterdam this year, were that alliances would need to work to prevent botting 'or else'. and that's a direction that i think a lot of people consider really unfair
---
I know the feeling too I was part of a small corp of 5-6 guys that taught me the game and then they all went afk which led to me taking a break too. I have now moved on to other things upon my return, but keep an alt in that corp just incase they ever return
---
The npc corps are all isk sinks as it is.... not really sure what "pay" there would be to dock?
---
My -155 IQ suggestion.  Alphas cant fly faction/pirate ships.

You can vote for whoever you want.  Just keep your mouth shut if it isn't for who they told you to vote for.  As Mittani keeps says, it's not a democracy.  It's an autocracy.  But it's an autocracy you choose to belong to.  Their are others in Eve and you can leave this one whenever you like.

lots of people rent space for completely legitimate reasons. pvp corps often do it. not everyone wants to grind anonymously among the unwashed masses, for a lot of people the income hit is worth it to have the space to themselves and play cooperatively.

Total noob here. What does V do? And what’s wrong with Rorquals?
---
&gt; if anything, having multiple active omega accounts is way more pay to win than blinging out 1 ship.
---
This. The way I always explain the counterbalance to paying for isk in eve is "every time someone sells PLEX to bling his ship, he adds another omega pilot that's potentially hunting him in the sandbox, and that balances his blinged up ship to a significant degree".

Stop making sense.

Won Eve for 3 years, last week.

The quality of the raw material extracted should be considered too. Check units extracted everyday, and check the relation between quantity supposed to be extracted, quality of the extraction, and the final quantity really extracted.

You say it is not a routing problem from/to the storage facility, but it is obviously a routing problem. Just recheck every connection and route. Or blow the whole thing away and rebuild it from scratch instead of playing detective and investigating each link.

Starting out which ship are you looking to pvp with?

Great idea... Let's make 100 bots and put them in alliances we hate.

Hmm if I place 20 bots in frt and they will make 1 bil each then lmao they are losing 200bil + 40bil per month. Really good idea, you have just showed CCP how to break game even more....

I disagree. 'Don't be a dickhead' means just that; don't be offensive, rude, etc. Asking questions and politely disagreeing while providing your own reasoning is **not** an example of being a dickhead.

---
Honestly though, the best way to learn about PVP is to just keep doing it. Buy a shit ton of crappy ships like Moas, fit them how YOU think they should be fit, and go try to kill people. Lost your 1M ISK ship? What went wrong. Record your stuff and watch it. Were you not able to hold your target down? Maybe you need webs. Did you have to engage at too long of a range to do significant DPS? Maybe you need to swap to blasters.
---
There's a million things that go into the thought process, but doing it yourself instead of using other people's fits is the best way to do it.

That is all great, but in regards to what CCP Peligro was saying on twitter - TEST should start to push their renters to clear out the botters more actively themselves. KWG for example has been a known botting alliance, leadership in KWG knows about, but TEST just takes the money...
---
Don't get me wrong, its not only TEST. Its a widespread phenomena in renter space...
---
Ahh, FW missions bots are a problem too. Yeah, I can imagine botting in lowsec is a lot harder to stuff, too, because other than instalock camping you have little recourse. It's also very difficult to tell the difference between a bot and anything else (so you're probably not shooting blues) and boring. On top of that, cancerous to the warzone if too many people are just insta camping instead of fighting.
---
The plex bots have been around forever and honestly never had a major impact on the wz, and I honestly doubt that big on the economy, but if they've got bots running pull routes while they run L4s in jackdaws, that's a problem.

Fuck bots.

Are you routing your extractor straight to the factories or to a launchpad?
---
If you’re not routing to the launchpad from the extractor, you’re literally wasting any excess above the 48k for any cycle it produces that.  
---
Always always always route extractors to some form of storage.  A launchpad is plenty.  Then route from the launch pad to the p1 production.  The production will pull from the excess stored in the storages on demand and will run flawlessly.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7ox7p1/balance_report_t1_frigates/
---
There maybe a more updated version. This will answer a number of your questions.
---
Remember you need to route from each extractor to storage and than from storage to factory, simply make the links go thru a storage unit is not enough  
---
if you did it right you should see incoming and outgoing if you look at your storage and no transit or how it is called

What are the changes to the existing trig ships? Kiki is losing drone bay and getting a PG nerf, any other nerfs?
---
Honestly I know where you're coming from, but I was there before CCP implemented PLEX, and let me tell you it wasn't pretty. RMT was rampart, with prices through the roof, and RMT links were shamelessly dropped in local / PMed to people (which is why you'd be charged for emailing and convoing people you didn't have as a contact). Eve's eula has to be one of the only eulas to prohibit real world companies to create accounts, because there WERE companies who's business was "we'll farm stuff in eve and sell them". All MMOs were kind of a free for all back then, but eve's volatile assets made it a RMTer's heaven and it was really impacting the economy, and it was clear CCP was up against the wall. 
---
CCP released dev blogs after PLEX's introduction that showed the real money value of eve assets plummeting in the illegal market and the volume of RMT following in a downward spiral. And the community was afraid too back then, but I have to say they introduced a new business model with minimal gameplay impact, and it worked good enough to be copied by the likes of WoW. It's also not as advantageous as you might think to buy ISK via PLEX, because macroscopically you're also giving your enemies free omega pilots, so it largely balances out.
---
aka a total retard? got it
---
I will give you a little story, a friend of mine was super ratting in a system where a chinese was farming 15+hour per day in a hel, he was 100% sure he was a bot, he then report him to CCP, CCP after a few weeks answer his ticket "This guy is legit blablabla".
---
So either that guy was legit and "leader of big coalition (btw I know you did not include GOTG on your shiny list for nothing)" would have kick and ban a legit turbonerd from their alliance for no reason or CCP is doing a bad job.
---
In both case it's CCP job, only them have the tool to fight bot, only them can have a final word (ok even if brisc incident show sometimes they do mistake)

It really depends on the situation. A lot of trial and error, I guess. When I solo roam I usually fight anything battlecruiser and down in my Moa. I have dual webs for tackling frigates and I'm blaster fit so I just approach, web+scram, and fuck them up. It took a while to get there, though.

what causes you to get sent home in your pod most often? focus on fixing that, and only that.
---
after a time, ask yourself the same question; what is the most common cause of being sent home in a pod?
---
fix that, and only that.
---
the great thing is - this works well for most things in life, not just eve's pvp. prioritise the most important issue, and knock that off the list, then repeat with the next most important issue, until there are no issues left.
---
So funny thing about instalock camping. Jackdaws in propulsion mode get by plenty easy. I play with 15ms or so ping and sit in a 3900 (cold) scanres stiletto. I fail to snag most jackdaws because their align time in prop is so good.

Warping a pulse retribution to meet them on their mission gate however... that's much more satisfying.

That sucks, the evolution to alpha ratting just shows that it has become a game of bots plus some players... some of whom happen to enjoy ganking bots :P

But in seriousness, they are an intractable part of Eve now, I think

I once made a decent living in game farming Mordu but the drop rate got nerfed. It did generate lowsec content though. The are anoms in lowsec that should maybe drop them but never do considering how you pretty much need a Rattle to run them.

It does suck, but in fairness, most of the media which reported this have since issued updates saying that the charges were dropped.

It's not a very appealing Google page though, filled with accusations etc.

Haha Good morning sport why so angry my little compadre do you want a sandwich?
---
ECM i think should give ghost targets to confuse the enemy sensors on who to shoot. You could go the easy way and just give a basic damage reduction on the targeted enemy for x amount of time. 
---
Or you could have it work like a probe launcher. When you launch the probe an actual fake ship will show up in the enemies overview. So as to confuse the enemy on who to shoot. The ghost ship wont disappear until the probe is destroy (low EHP) or the ship that launched it is.
---
You could balance it out by giving it a long reload time, so people don't go nuts and spam probes. Also Only allow smaller ships to launch one probe while larger ships could launch more (different sized mods with different fitting requirements). Maybe have ships like the Widow have fitting bonuses so they can fit multiple ECM mods and launch double/tripple the number of probes. 
---
There's lots of different things you could do with this like have programmable probes so you could ghost different ship signatures. It could work really well for small gangs to and cause people to panic and make mistakes. As you could have 4 frigs/dessies on a gate and just as someone jumps in they launch probes and it looks like  there's a dozen ships of varying types waiting to kill you.
---
The end goal would be to make them a strong option instead of something to just look over.  However they would need a lot of love and attention, especially when looking at their combat sites.

I'm taking this opportunity to invest heavily in Orville Redenbacher stock.

V is the default hotkey for the directional scanner (d-scan), which is the only way to tell if someone else is in space with you in wormholes, since there's no local.
---
Rorquals are, per my understanding (we don't typically use them), unusually vulnerable in w-space because you don't have a super umbrella to come save them during their PANIC invulnerability, and you don't have local or intel channels to lean on for when someone's getting ready to jump you.
---
It's possible they are actively investigating it. But one they can't say anything about it because off data protection laws. Two there probly letting him run awhile in order to gather more info that mite lead to more busts.
---
Welcome to eve! Though the concept of being "power leveled" is not a thing, since skill training doesn't work that way, I can understand wanting to learn some more on your own and get your feet wet. We had a guy do that for a couple weeks, manage to make a couple billion isk, then join Brand Newbros lol.
---
I'm not sure on mission running; I almost never did that, I made my newbie isk on exploration sites and now I mostly get paid through trading and piracy.
---
Learning the pve content and going through your career agent missions is a good idea :)

Whoever said Bloodstained Stars is a good. Do that.

Piloting to avoid damage is important in both pve and pvp.

Throw away everything you think you know about linear mmos. EVE is not that in the least. No matter what "career" you pick, you can't get power leveled unless you purchase skill injectors ( ~ 1 billion each).  
---
Two reasons why I'd suggest joining a corporation.   
---
1. You're going to have a lot of questions about this game and the best way to get through those is to have an established group point you in the right direction. If you're worried about having everything done for you, fear not. There is no shortcut to learning this game, corp or not.   
---
2. Large corporations offer resources and learning plans for all career paths. You sound like you want to get into PvE mission running. But maybe you'd like fleet vs fleet combat, FW, or ratting. Maybe you haven't even thought about industrial like PP, reactions, research, or T2 research? Even within military, there are paths like scouting, hunting, small gang, or cloaky combat.
---
In almost all cases across the board you won't be flying anything "end-game" for a year at least. It takes several months to finish your core skills (skills that apply to all ships) naturally and then you start specializing into ships associated with careers. You'll be flying newbie fit ships for a long time whether you are in a corp or on your own. 
---
I tried to get some friends to play with me and they feel into the same trap. *I don't want to join a corporation because that's endgame.* They burnt themselves out floundering around in hisec with no direction. 
---
KarmaFleet, PH, or Brave are great starters to get your feet wet and see what EVE has to offer.
---
Except Doomchinchila.
---
A lot of my wormhole focus will be on small-gang in order to promote more groups to enter J-Space.  Regarding changes to high class wormholes (C5 and C6), I will be active on Praisebob to make their voices heard to CSM--as most of my personal experience is with low-class wormholes.  
---
I feel that if we are to push for small-gang to have a stronger presence in EVE, then we will indirectly buff low-class wormholes (most notably C2's).
---
🍻
---
NPC null's population is mostly ok, what it could really use is a spawn rate for sov-style ore anoms (not a constant one, just every couple of days so we aren't stuck mining belts), a slightly higher DED site spawn rate as cosmic sigs, and our passive moons back. Give us a standup service module that lets the Athanor passively mine the asteroids - even at a significantly reduced overall yield. Make it a real tradeoff - some small groups will gladly take 60% value in exchange for not having to mine, and some will genuinely mine it because they want the extra isk.
---
Hell, let the Athanor launch special Standup Mining Fighters that auto-mine the entire field with a button press, but can still be destroyed if you don't protect them.
---
Part of NPC null's draw is that it's easier for small groups to establish themselves and the big blocs don't have interest because it's not as high value as sov. The content driver is over restricted resources in exchange for inclusive access - the direct contrary to Sov null (plentiful resources but more heavily contested in the long run) and thus the draw for players going to NPC.
---
This is the only space that really is left for these small groups outside of low class wormholes (life in which can be super awful for those who aren't looking for all the opt-ins of WH life) or random shitty hisec systems. It does not need a flood of players, just a small increase.
---
Can you define what you mean by "new plexes" please?
---
The exact literal equivalent is calling the cops to have him arrested = reporting the bot behavior you witness to CCP.  
---
When people witness a bot and they report to CCP that’s the end of the line for player responsibility.  It’s up to CCP to take it from there
---
Why are you calling them though? To complain about someone infringing on someone else's IP? 
---
???
---
To my knowledge, exactly one player-created problem in this game has been solved by CCP (with TiDi). And make no mistake, the ability to bot on this scale is a player-created problem.
---
If I were Pelligro, it would be sorely tempting to announce that henceforth, any alliance harboring bots would be subject to an ISK penalty. Something like an announcement saying "We don't know how much ISK has been pumped into your mineral processing taxes and corporation taxes by bots being in your corps and alliances, so we're going to go ahead and assume it's two billion ISK per botting account per month, half payable by removing it from the corp wallet, half payable by removing it from the alliance wallet."
---
I suspect the week after this was announced, alliances and corps would decide out that maybe the application from the character named "WiaCddLaDebdle wqaZafDlckPo" should get a little more scrutiny before he gets to start launching VNIs from alliance-owned fortizars.
---
/u/ccp_peligro by corp, not just alliance please.  "there were 2 bots found in your rental alliance" is entirely not helpful, "there were 2 bots found in this corp in your rental alliance" helps us help you.
---
I mean, sure, but everyone also hates goons, but I don't see anyone saying goons are wormholers.
---
I make all my corp CEOs call me daddy
---
Uh, are you new, or slow? That's been Goons since 2009. Don't like it? You can get the fuck out. Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya.
---
harboring gate campers is worse. gate camping ruins this game and makes it undesirable to play.
---
Passive moon mining is something I don't think CCP will bring back--no matter how hard we push for it.  It gutted low-sec in a pretty bad way.
---
But about the draw of NPC null, I agree completely.  I think allowing smaller groups to be able to establish themselves is extremely important.  [That's why I talk about the changes that needs to happen to nullsec in my full platform.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVw9YOK7tyTT6zPONb7yNuI7C-YOqlcKIwfeBmxfiFs/edit?usp=sharing)  
---
And I also hope that by increasing the possibly income for NPC null, it'll encourage more groups to choose to live there as opposed to high-sec (I see it as a happy medium between WH life, Null-sec life, and High-sec life). 
---
About the new plexes this is an idea I was toying around with when brainstorming with a few close friends. 
---
&gt;By adding Plexes, akin to faction warfare, except aligned with pirate factions would help create active content as well as an LP faucet (in order to incentivise players to join).  By scaling it with pirate standings, it would also push players to “pick a side” as opposed to going between deplexing and plexing.  The idea, in order not to pigeon-hole players into a certain choice, would be to use a module (likely an entosis module) to plex the sites while killing the entosiser/entosising hostile plexes (possibly CONCORD/other pirate factions) would be deplexing. 
---
While it's not something set in stone, I feel that by adding more content to NPC null, we'll be able to increase the attraction players will have to it, and thus increase its population.  All in all creating more content across the game.
---
How are corps supposed to police this. The corp management interface won't let me see useful stuff like &lt;users actively earning bounties over x hours per day&gt; or anything that would make botters really obvious.
---
Maybe, but people do get kills. At worst it screws up the bot owner's ticks for a while, at best CCP actually acts on the reports, as they did yesterday.
---
You have to be careful. Get too skilled and you'll get stuck in the messhall forever.
---
*Popcorn intensifies*
---
Show me the obvious difference between a bot account application and a new player application please I'll wait.
---
Did you hit your head or just decided to go full retarded about this?
---
Define 'turn a blind eye'. Also how do you identify a bot in your alliance. Unless someone happens to notice a dude logged on a lot it's not easy with the tools currently in game.
---
To add on top of Kaedis, just because you can d-scan doesn't mean you're going to see everyone.  They can be cloaked OR be in a combat recon that is immune from dscan.
---
No, but is that really an excuse for a shitty graph?
---
There is a big difference, in that input broadcasting used to be kosher. Botting has always been bannable.
---
Join a corp that isn't in a big null block then you will get experience in PvP where you are more important than just pushing F1.  You could also go the solo route but if you enjoy flying with people smaller fleets really help.
---
its a programming language, they can modify the function so that it takes it into account... Also what kind of fucked up programming language can't parse a standard basic character as such?
---
anveri is a big noob that lost an AT ship to FW frigs and also bought hentai from the trusted(tm) hentai dealer (would recommend) /u/lolrus_bukkit
---
It's about doing how you act when given the easy opportunity.
---
When bots are reported to your corp/alliance, do you awox and kick them after verifying?  When it's brought up that the latest ban wave hit largely your renter alliance, do you start whining about it and trying to deflect with whataboutism, or do you try to do something about it?
---
Do you encourage your members to report bots to you and to CCP or do you call those people "blue fuckers"?
---
Do you want fewer bots in the game or do you welcome more?
---
Imagine being this oblivious to your obvious hypocrisy. And lmfao thinking gangs can only be defended against with bosons on gates.
---
I'm not sure how well a single purger II would do, all depends on your skills and piloting. I'd be a bit careful in the beginning with that or at the very least have 2 purgers and 1 hyper to begin with.
---
Prop mod wise you could fit a 50MN with meta 4 extenders but that would cause cap issues due to the SPR, invuls and the ship's base cap. On top of that it would bloom your sig making your lacking tank possibly more of an issue. apart from that high speed can mess up your own tracking, personally I'd advise against fitting mwd in this case unless you have maxed out relevant skills and really know wth you're doing.
---
You could perhaps use a blinged out AB but that's about it.
---
Except in your example, the infringing material is on your account.

If you don't have any particular changes in mind yet, that's fine too. I was just hoping for details.

Some things to keep in mind.  
---
* The extractor cycles once an hour, depositing resources. 
---
* The factories cycle every 30 minutes.  
---
* The extractor extracts more towards the beginning of the total pull time and tapers off towards the end of the cycle.  
---
* The projected amount to be pulled per hour is based off your skills (to accurately survey the land) and after you hit the button it can change. 
---
Solution: Route p0 to a storage facility first. Also, dropping down a factory or two to have another extractor head with even 1 or 2 more drills going might mean you hit max/hour intake to keep factories running daily.

I’ll be honest,
---
I’m in a primarily Chinese alliance in a coalition that’s about half Chinese-speaking, and I probably report 10 people a day for saying objectively racist remarks and prejudicial stereotypes in our local chats.  This, to be clear, is not that, but a lot of the benign facets of this conversation are demonstrably complicated by the prevalence of actual and unabashed racist behavior in our local chats and sometimes even in-game mails.  I think if a group of folks decide that something is racist, it’s intellectually lazy to just say “nah” without having a conversation and hearing them out.  And again, to be clear, this to me “Chinese players bot” is not in and of itself racist.  But the jokes about affording rice, about sweatshops, etc....those things are.

It's a publicly available corporation management tool. It has no automatic ability to root out bots on its own; he's suggesting that players sit at a computer screen, staring at wallet tick logs for every player in their organization to discover bots.

But why ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Are they going to permanently invade goon space or something ????????????????????
---
Of course.  The only specific changes that I know need to happen soon, are to focus on altering sites in C4s and C3s.  They are not in an incredibly strong place right now, and thus many people have little reason to live in either hole.
---
In terms of FAXes in wormholes, I feel that they could use nerfs.  How that'll happen, I'm not 100% sure yet.  It might be that they get a direct nerf to Triage to being in a hole, or even increasing how hard stacking penalties are on subcaps.  However it is something that should be addressed.
---
In terms of high-class wormholes, I do not have any specific changes in mind.
---
In terms on low-class wormholes, much of the focus to benefit them will be in-direct--through helping buff small-gang in nullsec and putting it in a stronger place than it is now.  Especially by taking a look at the power of citadels, jump gates, and cynos.

What are you going to do about market bots? Cause this whole post smells like rules for thee and not for me.

You keep yalking about Frat and goons but ignore the fact that your own leadership doesn't do their ESI checks for KWG and living breathing fuel blocks and instead profit from it even with the russians. Go take a look at tennerifis omist paragon soul and feythabolis... Its your space and its full of botters. Blame your leadership first then blame others.
---
I think this was my problem.  There seems to be a fairly large disparity between expected total and actual total, displayed once the program starts running.  Thank you for actually  answering my question instead of suggesting things I clearly said I already tried or checked in my post.
---
Yes, please come rat in c6s with a vindi and a fax because you will "fuck up most gangs that roll in to you".  Very very difficult to kill that combo indeed.
---
And you can totally bling everything because you can't really die with that combo. You know? It's just fantastic.
---
:P
---
So you're saying battle rorqs are the new meta for trig space?
---
Yes.   Extractor routes to pad, pad routes to factories, factories route back to pad.  I pick up and reset extractors daily for max extraction
---
I am slowly sound like DRF? You have a stoke typing that out?
---
You should totally alienate a huge voting bloc. It's the best strategy.
---
As in, the alliances that accept people who are running bot farms of 50+ accounts. Online 23/7.
---
Im not talking about the one or two bots that every alliance inevitably has. Alliance leaders can't be expected to keep a microscope on all their members
---
but there are a few alliances that are quite clearly taking the piss
---
They're going to publish alliance details, but I have my doubts this is actually mango. PLA and Frat yes. Different chinese bots.
---
Yes I understand that.  Like I said I have several planets, all performing correctly except for this one.  I figured out the problem was a disparity between the total extraction numbers before and after starting the program
---
 You shouldn't open links like that outside a VM on a different network.
---
How many smartbombs does it take to blap one?
---
As a new player, i'm very confused why they make the PVE so deterministic that even bots can do it.  Just add any randomness at all the to the PVE?  Just enough that a real person would have to think about the situation.    
---
Honestly annoying af that every PVE situation in the game is a solved problem.
---
I used to do that up until I accidentally re-cloaked when I meant to fire guns at a target.

Just thought trough your argument that it is easier to bot burners than exploration it took a  while to realize how out of touch that argument is lol.
---
Exploration is so far much easier to automatize, as it has a shitload LESS determinators than burners, requires far less input actions and also the logic of the minigame is very easy to do with simplest if-then stuff. While Burners have 8 different Missions just for Frigs, with 8 different fits (you have to swap at least jammers on team burner garmur or you have to use a multibox bot (4 Rocket-MASB-Kestrels). So you need at least 8 different templates, a mechanism to detect what template to use for next mission and so on. All this leads me to the conclusion I am argueing with a clueless person just spitting personal assumptions without practical backup.

The wallet shows tax income ticks and who generated them. You can also attempt to contact these Corp members and see if they respond while they are ratting.

If they fail these checks, report and let CCP do the rest.

 **In Eve Online, I'm not a pirate but:** what the hell are pirate ships, anyway?  
---
Let's say you want to launch a ship in a system where you think it is safe and have the right license for the game. You don't go into the POS and just want to start flying pirates, because there simply aren't any. You would need at least an alt-account, and maybe a character to pilot this ship. In EVE Online, there are very, very few of those.  
---
One can't even run a POS in EVE but fly the player owned ships that we have the most space around, such as: the Caldari Navy Issue, the Gallente Navy Issue, the Murky Ghost, the Tengu and the Nyx. Most players do not own any of those, either. There are some people who do own them, and even they don't have it all figured out yet because the ships are complex.  
---
One problem with EVE Online is, since EVE Online began, one thing the public at large has realized is what an impossible thing it
---
You are talking to people who own the largest alliances in the game, you can say many things about them but nobody got that far in eve being naive.
---
So they know. They protect the sov of their renters for many years now. A simple trip around renter space lets you see that 95% of the activity is botters. They are blue to each other. What are you trying to accomplish with your post?  The chinese are coming and half of the anom runners in hi sec are their botting alts currently. Perhaps focus on these? I mean if you had some imagination, and pictured yourself as an alliance renting director who gets a couple hundred bil each month for doing nothing would you go out of your way to have them banned and deny yourself the fruits of the botting?

Minor nitpick though, mid-class holes aren't in a bad place.  Just because people don't live in them doesn't mean they're unappreciated: I live in a 5-3 and we regularly crab out our static and use the LS for content.  I'd imagine C4s, with dual statics, are also good connectors.  Moreover I suspect that these connections are why people don't live in them: too hard to close off. (Speculation, if you disagree please tell me!)
---
On everything else though, I agree. +1.
---
LEGALIZE BOTS!
---
Praise BoB 😉

There are 3rd party tools used by many of the larger alliances that make it pretty trivial.  "Oh look, the average person earned about 50 million ISK in taxes this month at a 10% tax rate....... except for xXxBobThaUberDestroyerxXx who earned the corp 3.7 billion ISK in taxes."
---
While there could be easier ways of doing this, particularly for ratting it's quite easy to tell if someone in your corp has been ratting all day or not :|
---
What do you think are some of the options for fixing Ansiblex Jump Bridges and Citadels? I have a lot of thoughts on the subject, but I wanna hear yours before I color the discussion. However, I've interacted extensively with both sides of these structures.
---
hilarious!
---
[I talk about a lot of different options in my full platform.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVw9YOK7tyTT6zPONb7yNuI7C-YOqlcKIwfeBmxfiFs/edit?usp=sharing)
---
I feel it requires a mixture of all of the ideas, considering how oppressive they are in today's meta.
---
Use some fucking implants you animal.
---
Train planetology and adv. Planetology higher. Your expected Vs. Actual will be much closer.
---
To my knowledge Provibloc does not.
---
No it’s pretty legit. You’re missing the part where two dreads can perfectly apply with their capital guns from the full nos/web fir in the Vindicator. MCAV got face rolled by it my dude. This is my endgame for sure.
---
You know you play Eve Online right? You don't have go far to find people that will do/pay to screw over someone else
---
Since you are running CSM what happen to the Tri AT rewards?  How is a lot of pilots failed to receive rewards?
---
I was asking some folks what this might be worth and saw some threads where it said they retailed for 200 w 50 bucks for shipping. Can anyone verify this please?
---
The AF still has too little range. 
---
The HAC will be a fine nano alternative to the Drek, but won't replace it and chances are the Drek will still be preferred due to links.
---
Here is your deleted comment for context.  
---

Lol, I guess they didn't copy over.. that's using ogdins eye coordination enhancer and pagans turret comization mindlink
---
go ahead and ask dj or mittens if they think peligro is biased against goons
---
Someone needs to sell reactive gas to the new csm
---
The Drek is already on par with the Sleip. I'd be hot for a CS Drek, personally.
---
I saw 'Moon Chunk' and assumed you were talking about DaBigRedBoat... guess that diet didn't pan out.
---
It would be better at it than most ships. Perhaps a T3D would work fine but then you might run in to damage type issues.a Vagabond would be good at well but I'm not sure if lvl 3 missions have HAC restrictions.
---
lmfao
---
I can see that if you removed local all together but I could see having random local outages for like 30-60 minutes so they can't play around it. I don't think CCP would ever do it and also bot programmers could also work around it if it ever got out that it was happening.
---
&gt;Working with CCP I hope to increase the number of community events and community run tournaments.
---
How do you see this actually happening? What happens if ccp pulls another AT 2019 or streamfleet invitational, how do you see yourself reacting to that?
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=deepfake+data+star+trek
---
Literally no one cares
---
That's a good point.  I would encourage you to join my discord so we can discuss different ideas and viewpoints about mid-class wormholes :).
---
However I feel that by changing payouts for C4s we would see an increase in people living there, hopefully spicing it up just a bit.
---
Dodixie and Rens are now much less of a trade hub than they were before. You're likely to still find most of the common stuff, but they're definitely much smaller markets. Amarr is also smaller, but still big enough where you can find a good selection of stuff. Jita is the only trade hub where you can find anything.
---
I worked on the Streamfleet invitational as an analyst and a broadcaster this year.  Suffice to say, we were all extremely disappointed.  I can only hope that CCP doesn't make the same mistake again.
---
On CSM14 I plan to push for CCP to recognize these community events and make sure that we get everything sorted for them.  If I have to act as a conduit and source of contact for CCP and the community, then so be it.  Hosting community events is extremely important for me, because it's a sign of a healthy and happy community.
---
hey, understandably the brisc thing was a big snafu and reflects poorly on ccp, but ccp security had exactly nothing to do with it.
---
Everyone is happy that they can give the enemy a link so they know where to undock\^\^
---
In China copying is not stealing by culture ... this will repeat as long as China has overtaken economical world lead (soon tm) and then they will just laugh about alll that weak democratic laws stuff
---
How do you get rid of renting?
---
used to be.
---
My comment was just in jest of course. 
---
But I feel compelled to address your confusion as is required by my Customer Service V conditioning:
---
stating that (a) WINGSPAN are wormholers and (b) gate keeping is resulting in people hating wormholers is in no way a contradiction. As a member of a group you are capable of pointing out behavior displayed by a subset of that group, which results in others hating the whole, without losing membership of said group. 
---
I hope I've resolved your confusion to your satisfaction. If not, feel free to contact us for further counseling.

There are a lot of good cheap cruiser fits for getting into PVP. The vexor, which can be fir with neuts and buffer tank, it can be dual rep wiht blasters for extra damage, it can even be fir hull tank. The Moa is pretty classic running a shield buffer tank. The XLASB rupture is popular. the thorax is also pretty good. The omen is good if you want to practice kiting (staying at range and not getting hard tackled).
---
I know this reply is only an hour old, but I personally feel it has not been upvoted enough.
---
Gotta stay for weeks!
---
Perimeter would replace it in a heartbeat with the safety of teather to plan your jump
---
the resulting drama over which coalition has less botters will be amusing
---
Oh yeah, the two dreads with vindi guns will help... Until it gets booshed. Then your pve fleet is suddenly unable to apply any damage.

Awes what a great guide for the adorable newbie ratting in his little super.
---
But again, no specific names. If you can point out a specific name or two, that'd actually be pretty helpful.
---
Either leaderships will cope with the new policy of CCP, or they won't bother anymore at some point.
---
Or CCP seizes to pursue this path.
---
well at first you should go out there and lose a few ships, to get used to losing ships and fights.
---
then think about why you lost and what you could have done better. use a web/scram ? mwd instead of ab, distance you kept from the target ? ammo choice. once this all sinks in the end result will be a ship and fit that you know can do well in a situation that you dictate from your past experiences. eventually you will have something that works until you meet someone that can counter your fit and then you go back to the drawing board or choose not to take those fights.
---
I feel like you've missed the entire point of the issue.
---
It just went up yesterday, so I’m waiting to see! This is our first big promotional push as an alliance. I’m all about branding anyway, so even if we don’t pull more members out of it, it’ll be worth it for me :D
---
Plus, this was just a good project to practice my video work and music composing.
---
While you raise a good point about the meta game this could have the alternate effect of impeding the blue doughnut.
---
Less likely to accept unknowns in to your organizations because they can breath and hit f1.
---
I disagree... CODE. could only dream of to being memed as much as WINGSPAN is. ;)
---
Well

I've read goonswarm federation as your flair :facepalm: - don't mind me I'm a retard

There's a Raven on ebay currently for £300. It hasn't sold yet though...
---
Down near the end, theres three new rocks, with varying amounts of trit, mex, iso and pyerite bonuses while the other minerals are suppressed. Should be interesting to see what's gonna happen.
---
It will be a long road and this a step in the right direction.
---
I do hope that you are on papa Mittens ballot.
---
So CCP comes out and tells the player base in a game your basically allowed to do anything you can't do this one thing because of reasons.
---
What do you mean with friendly?
---
Interesting. Not my cup of tea but interesting none the less. Here's my upvote
---
I mean that all sounds good in theory but...fuck. Running an alliance, especially a mid-sized one, already seems like a fairly thankless and demanding job. This sounds like one more reason for smaller groups to realize that it's not worth the hassle. I don't love the idea of encouraging MORE consolidation into large groups that would be better equipped to police themselves, or at least show some form of good faith.
---
Praise Avis
---
None of that 3d bs no wonder ccp kept failing at vr, not enough D
---
Try using some probes.
---
What's the best WH guide(s) to familiarize myself with? I'm talking spelled out in crayon, teach me as if I know nothing about EVE style. Because WHs after almost 3 years of play time still confuse and intimidate me with all that can go wrong with casual exploration.
---
You guys don't even wanna know what he makes us linemembers call him.
---
Was this the one where jammers were cycled to let defenders in and lock out attackers?
---
Don't be an idiot and click on those links. It is an unneseary risk. Who knows when the next speculative execution attack is going to rear its head.
---
yeah so... someone should totally bring their titans to lowsec again... : P
---
They are either in belts or anomolies. If you warp to a few spots and use d-scan you might be able to narrow down their location but if they are in anomolies that have to be scanned down you will have to also scan them down.
---
Seems like a perfect politician in the making. Swindle hundreds of hours of hard work, reap all the rewards for personal gain.
---
This whole post reads like a pre-excuse for being named one of the biggest harborers.
---
\&gt;  has a programmer who is talented enough to not only use ESI, but write sophisticated forensic software for a space-themed spreadsheet 
---
Anyone with a tiny bit of experience could write extremely simple database check on who is earning constant steady streams of isk all day every day and know to alert someone to check more closely on their activity.
---
No?
---
I said if it's not worth the bother, people will stop it eventually.
---
Like exploring in a marauder or mining in an astero.
---
Did you just admit to RMTing anime boobies? @CCP ban this dude
---
of the average active daily logins (say there are 20K-30K on a good day), what percentage do we think are actual botters?  30%? that means about 7,500 of 25K (average) are bots.  I can't imagine that CCP would want to show to their investors/owners a drop of that many "active" accounts on a daily basis.  That is not a KPI to have on your scorecard.
---
try recruiting here: https://eve-corps.com/ :)
---
Is it possible to shed some light on who did? I don'tr imagine so, but this statement leaves the question open. 
---
Ty for your hard work, 
---
Cheers
---
That was amazing. I laughed my ass off.
---
It’s a phone number. Sometimes someone lists phone numbers, I may [or may not] call them.
---
What would I say? I’ve no idea. I would compliment them on their artwork and ask where they got the inspiration?
---
It’s Reddit. I called the cab company that was used in ‘The West Wing’, because their phone number was listed on the side of one of the cabs the actors emerged from in a scene. And guess what: that is a real cab company. They still operate. They confirmed that, yes, it was the intended idea for them to list their phone number so that people would call and order a cab. And they did.
---
I called a pancake place in California, because it was crazy looking but also fun. They were closed.
---
The mood strikes me, there’s a phone number. I call. I once called a guy who had lost his dog [and at the time that was a while back], asking him whether he ever got his dog back [he did].
---
Life’s not fair but nobody said you couldn’t have a bit of fun while’ you’re at it, right?
---
Most people play video games when they want to have fun.
---
Try FW space. A big proportion of non-FW LS is practically dead.
---
Thanks, you've inspired me to come back to Eve after winning for six months. Guess I'll go buy 50 webs and some t1 frigs
---
I have not. But it sounds filthy. I’ll play around with the idea.
---
Awesome :)
---
I -not only- play video games when I want to have fun.
---
What does EVE teach us? It’s a sandbox, you make your own rules. What is life? The biggest sandbox there is...
---
the robot revolution has begun
---
Same ))
---
Most not shit wormholers roam/play in nullsec, either through nullsec statics or roaming wormholes in their chain. It provides more consistent content than aimlessly scanning chains or rage rolling C5s in an off timezone/without a blob around. Caring that they can get meaningful content in nullsec without seeding 100 dreads is a valid concern.
---
This guy is just trash though.
---
I approved your identity as ghost of gate to the Stain.
---
But how else do you get botting software. :Gets pencil: like, step by step.
---
I think they scan zkill for ratting/mining ship losses. If you aren’t losing VNIs or miners, they won’t bother
---
Man, this type of attempt to control the narrative is starting to get tiresome to read.
---
Ride the lightning.
---
...better at generating lag.
---
It's a Triglavian code.
---
Yes, you tell CCP exactly how they should run their game. The CSM always sees such great success every year.
---
Maybe they'll even out you for fake NDA breach and smear your reputation all over the floor?
---
If you fly a duel web+scram moa you'll get fucked by soo many fits.
---
Hell, if you're being kited, manually piloting so that your vector INTERCEPTS the kiter provides for significantly better results than just approaching. It sounds like you know the very basics of solo and that's it. Maybe not the best mentor, y'know?
---
Are you framiliear with D-Scan (Directional Scan)   
---
Search around on Youtube. There are great tutorials on how to use this effectively.
---
The info shows names for 3 new types of raw ores, so definitely not a bug.
---
You may have helped Tri get to third place in the AT, but you also ran off with the rewards, so you’re basically just an asshole.
---
Calling random phone numbers is odd though.
---
Its eve onion. Its satire.
---
One thing you can do is use d-scan. If you barrow your cone to like 5degrees, then hold down ‘v’ and click on different celestials, or mining belts, or plexes or whatever it will point the d-scan at that and scan it. Then if they’re on d-scan there it’s a good chance that’s where they are. Or if you have combat probes it tells you where to stick them.
---
FW, D-scan,  combat probes
---
Maybe adding a chance for them to drop from the barghest/orthrus spawns in beseiged sites?
---
So, where's the open source software that does this? Additionally, why isn't CCP running these reports, if they're so easy?
---
I owned a c4 and then owned a c6. Ended up in Esoteria. Eve is lonely enough as it is. I do however use wormholes nearly every day.
---
Wer will findet Wege, wer nicht will findet Gründe.

Rough Translation:
---
Determination searches for solutions, rejection/denial searches for reasons.
---
&gt;f there are other botting place why your renters became this outstan
---
Q. Rorqs and barges are botted too, not just VNIs and supers. Given this, how can you be so sure that the quick rate of capital and super capital build up done by your alliance was not significantly aided by botting?
---
Can you confirm or deny your ties to the big gay?
---
A lot of games with free accounts restrict where and how you can chat. For example alphas may not be allowed to chat in local ("global" or "world" chat restrictions from MMOs), just their corp/alliance and PMs.
---
We also already have a mechanism for charging for mails, so just force alphas to always have a small fee, even 100k isk for the first message to a person would force them to get isk from another alt (creating a trail) or undocking to make a little isk (which slows down creating spamming accounts)
---
As far as I’m aware, we weren’t discussing technical stuff, I was just saying I like the look of them..
---
&gt; just checked my logs, apparently i've submitted exactly 1, when I didn't think my noses were working correctly. the ticket was closed without a reply.
---
But dave, that means you did a job somebody else was paid to do!
---
How odd that you just did it for free right? Almost like it might make your gaming experience better by helping the company make its product better....
---
Because it's probably CCP hunting for potential botters.
---
Ah, a CSM candidate of culture I see.
---
Same for me actually, I was on an 8 month hiatus but decided to come back.  
---
One can´t really quit EvE
---
I have the rifter model with the built in USB ports for sale if anyone’s intrested pm me
---
Meh. I’m not hurting anyone. I don’t call people to call them names. I’m having a conversation.
---
A guy texted me. Wanted to have a date. That was... weird. I text him back with some teaser language. He continues the engagement. It dawns on me: the girl he met had given him a random phone number to ‘call her on to make a date’. But she gave him a bogs number. It happened to be my number. That was quite amusing :-).
---
A guy called me. This is what he said “I need 2 and a half thousand gallons of fuel.” Doesn’t say hi, doesn’t say his name, doesn’t say what fuel he needs, where it needs to go. Just: I need 2 and a half thousand gallons of fuel. I told him: “We’ll send a truck this afternoon.”
---
Another guy calls me: Is Dave there? [I have no idea who Dave is. I don’t know a Dave]. “He’s not here.” 
---
“Well, where is he?”
---
“Dude, I don’t know, Dave doesn’t answer to me. He went out, he should be back this afternoon, maybe?”
---
The guy calls back in the afternoon.
---
“Can I talk to Dave?”
---
“Nah, he already left.”
---
Dude calls back the next day.
---
“Is Dave around yet?”
---
“He’s in the other building. I’ll tell him to call you back.”
---
/Never heard from him again.
---
/true story
---
Phone calls are weird, what can I say?
---
I doubt it covers much more than the fuel for all the structures too
---
Gotcha. For sure it looks better, but it is important to recognize that CCP re-engineered a lot of effects with the goal of reducing lag.  It's the price we paid, regrettably.
---
Thaaaaat's not quite the same as what this guy is showing.
---
So maybe some type of new sig that spawns with new ore?
---
NPC Nullsec has plenty of content and is in a great place right now. Stations weren't removed so the barrier to entry is low, mission running is great individual income (which is all that matters for small to medium sized entities), logistics for most regions are fantastic (Stain doesn't need a lowsec gate ffs), and there's lots of groups that live there that enjoy the small 10 dollar brawls that happen.
---
You propose to introduce lowsec FW mechanics to NPC null, and that's completely unnecessary. Neither is introducing more combat sites. They are fine the way they are, why do you think you need to introduce more AFK VNI blobs to NPC Null?
---
You also talk about L5s in NPC Null. Can you point me to some of those agents, I could really boost my Serpentis LP.
---
Kinda amusing to read some of the replys which are basically "KWG = Your oppinion is invalid!!11".
---
I would imagine all null sec empires with rental programs have the same issue, Test is in the same position as NC./Goons/Frat/SkillU etc. I'll not splurge on the difficulty of policing (i VNI rat... in rock havens i basically only need to interact with my VNI if i get a triple elite cruiser spawn, in wave 6). CCP have a difficulty job due to adaptation, if they reveal they have decoded bot behavior and ban 200 bots, in a few days new code and new alpha accounts will be created. 
---
I do agree that better consequences of botting need to exist. If alliances accepting rental money suddenly find themselves in negative wallet due to money from botting being traced to paying rent, the sov holding alliances will quickly resolve the issue by kicking corps with botters (ccp does the investigation...not the alliance). This leaves real renting corps alone, punishes botters and aids alliances rout out their botting renters).
---
If someone (or a group of someones) puts up a trillion isk as a reward I'm sure somebody will write a third party tool to do exactly that.
---
It sounds -just outside- of sensibility. Like what a teenager would say whose balls have not sprouted hair yet but who feels like there’s something more to it that he just doesn’t get yet.
---
"Thunder Fighter". As soon as you hear an awkward or nonsensical title, you know it's a Chinese rip-off.
---
This means that I could sit in station doing trading and not worrying about if I am missing out by not traveling from system to system looking for Ghost sites.  Right?
---
Also, because these sites pop-up on random time (I am guessing it is how it works - newbie here) it means that if I was traveling I would still have an edge because I would be faster (in terms of jump) from the system that has a wanted site by me and other players?
---
lol, PL sold that 4 or 5 years ago, sorry bud.
---
Yeah before messing with this I didn't know those skills affected that.  I thought it just made the heat map more accurate when scanning
---
You got my vote bro wish you luck on your campaign :)
---
But CCP are the ones asking corps to manage this, without tools available to easily do so.
---
Seems like something we shouldn't be relying on third party apps for, honestly.
---
Now try managing this with a corp of 2400 'someones'.
---
The correct price is what buyer and seller  agree upon.
---
Define your expectations, your limit and your timeframe.
---
Advertise. With a markup on your estimate for leeway. 
---
Negotiate.
---
Re-Evaluate your parameters if necessary.
---
is this those old school 3d optical illusions pics?
---
My main point was CCP can run these checks as a matter of course. SQL script to see users who were active more than 18 hours yesterday, ran daily, showing trends for users active for x time over a week. Should be a trial thing for CCP to do, but they insist it's the corp leaders responsibility instead.
---
It seems like you missed out on an opportunity to earn some isk by offering a more competitive price for doctrine mods in the TTT
---
It's more like running around looking for targets to gank, and if you find one that is an obvious bot report it.
---
I'm going to enemy space because I want to have fun and pvp, and I get to add an extra service to the community by reporting the bots when I do it. It's a straight up win/win.
---
What about the machariel ? It might be overkill but meh
---
But as an alliance lead its not a 'simple' thing to see who has been active 23/7.  Sure an esi/API tool could be made to do this, but CCP could see the same stats direct from their DB for free with a simple SQL search. Why is it on the players to use third party tools to police the game?
---
Its because those new characters have to go through high population areas, which is where these bots scrape their mailing lists from.
---
inb4 all the FRT bots came from Origin.
---
&gt; The Mittanni, has been caught all but encouraging botting in the past
---
that's a quite a stretch
---
Serpentis Hideaway and Refuge give 3/10 not 4/10 but that's the exception afaik.
---
Looks more like ur hardware is dying
---
with the acdu both seem like they'll be extremely strong
---
i wonder if they'll become as dominant in WH space as the drekavic
---
All us bitter old vets complained that allowing Chinese players onto the server would cause a direct sizable increase with the amount of bots in game. We all used to agree how well off we were that Chinese players were not playing with us and had their own server. Now... the bots are every where.
---
That old bonus honestly should have been build in any trig hull from the very beginning, and then get reduced pg and cpu so you are more inclined to use those high modules instead of keeping the highs empty and using the fitting for tank
---
I for one... see that we'll have to wait a little longer for our robot overlords to take over. It is impressive, however, that they've now reached the level of "shitty, phoned-in high school essay."
---
Wrong. Cable porn best porn.
---
Warp in with something bigger, drop a depot and fill it with bombs.
---
It is tied in with the mini monolith which when reprocessed turns I to an item called "a handful of tiny stars".
---
I've been playing EVE for 3 months dude. I'm definitely not mentor material yet. I'm just sharing my experiences.
---
If only one of the most respected wormhole community members agreed with you.
---
https://youtu.be/21HkA0Suvvw?t=435
---
Honey pot?
---
Eh, there still needs to be more than "character made x in taxes therefore character = bot" to go off of.
---
20 hours per day of a character generating isk = stupidly suspicious.
---
A VNI in 20 hours ratting per day @50m isk ticks can make 3bill per month in ratting taxes @10% rate.
---
A super in 5 hours per day @100m isk ticks can make 1.5b per month in ratting taxes @ 10% rate
---
So it IS doable to go off of isk IF, AND ONLY IF, the people making decisions arent complete spodbrains and single out the one guy with no life who super rats 10 hours a day in his grandma's basement. 
---
A timeline showing activity is infinitely more useful, not to mention a characters Corp history offering CEO/Directors ability to leave comments on it when booting characters. Boot a character for being a bot? Now its listed in character's history permanently for all to see.
---
weaponizing my orca now .
---
Isn't there also a modified and up-to-date version of the Rykki's guide?
---
I have 15 AFK VNI alts set to auto reject any conversation, fleet invite or mail.
---
1, I'm not monitoring them
---
2, those who need to talk to me know my characters, or have access to the alliance/corp program to figure out who these alts belong to
---
3, neuts CONSTANTLY spam fleet invites and convos attempting to screw with players, so see above
---
Am I a bot?
---
Beep boop
---
&gt; I'm gonna ram him
---
Famous last words :D
---
Absolute madlad
---
I don't think it's the player's job to police this kind of thing even if we were given the right tools by CCP. But you asked how it could be done, that's how.
---
Was this written by the same folks that wrote Tae? Because this got fucking dark...
---
**I like killing people.**
---
But what if I can't kill people all the time and they are too powerful or want more of me? What if I could never have an orgasm like the one I did before? What if I could turn to a friend and just be friends, like I was supposed to be? 
---
Maybe someday, someday, someday, someday I will have them too. I hate that I can't even tell them how I love them to death, how I am not going to let them down in any way, shape or form, no matter what happens.
---
Not like that.
---
You don't care. You don't want anything other than me to be happy inside and happy. You think the way I treat myself and love my friends and loved ones would make me happy, wouldn't it? If we get married, what I give will not change even if I'm dying. If I can't just be happy all the time, how many times do we have to live?
---
If I die in a car accident, can I always take care of my family?
---
If you're entire Corp it's unable to see suspicious behavior and talk about it.... Then I don't know what yo tell you, other than don't pretend like you actually care on Reddit.
---
With an army of neckbeards who live in grandma's basement playing eve ALL day...
---
Hardcore Henry ;)
---
So... Rykkies guide works in the ingame browser? You sure about that?
---
I have seen entire alliances die off completely due to CCP banning bots and or RMT in the past.
---
FYI these are just trait bonuses, effects did not change (so ships still have old bonuses despite the traits tab).
---
Is your corp recruiting? I would love to join, I love the attitude!
---
Dont mind my army of alts logged on 23/7, they're just uh... cloaky camping.
---
jEveAssets has a function that will tell you what items are profitable to reprocess.
---
This guide is gold if you are completely lost - gives a fantastic overview of all relevant frigates for learning to pvp.
---
I would also recommend that you consider flying destroyers in lowsec as a newbie pvper.
---
Also totally recommend watching youtube videos from these two guys:
---
Suitonia -  [https://www.youtube.com/user/eveiseasy/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/eveiseasy/videos) 
---
Blights Wretch -  [https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96/videos) 
---
They both have pvp how to videos for various ships - many t1 frigates and destroyers.
---
They do a good job of explaining their fit and do a decent breakdown of explaining what happens during the example engagements they provide. Watch the videos on t1 frigates and t1 destroyers.
---
Join channel "Bringing Solo Back" also - plenty of willing people in there that will be give words of wisdom.
---
Joining a corp can help - but to be honest i'd think you are better off with the above resources.
---
Lose 200-300 t1 frigs and t1 destroyers and you will come out on the other side a much more competent pilot.
---
P.S. convo the pilot after a loss and ask for a couple of words of advice - most will be willing to help out :-)
---
Get an instalocking hurricane and a small bubble and go gatecamp.
---
I should have added the /s
---
;P
---
Start with t1 destroyers - like thrasher, corax, cormorant and coercer. Fair cruiser fights are hard to come by currently - you will die often and get disheartened. only when you get better go to cruisers.
---
who?
---
If you can't figure it out, maybe you aren't the person who should be leading a group that cares about self-policing bots. (Hint: a good leader doesn't do every single task themselves, and create a culture that promotes the values they want which gets their members on board with the group goals)
---
gay x jay
---
There's a difference between "having" and "harboring"; A properly designed system (Bob willing) would penalize alliances who knowingly allow bots to operate with impunity far more harshly than a small alliance who just happened to have a botter join without anyone realizing.
---
The accusation (true or not) has always been that the large nullsec blocs have, at best, turned a blind eye to botting within their own ranks.
---
Haha, i hoped he were the typical single rep 100mn legion:D Baited on a free Legion kill.
---
meh I just group them because both groups tend to pray on newbies. I dont mind dying to wingspan or code cause its my stupidity just hate to see newbie wh corps give up since they are on camp 24/7 and when they form up wingspan runs or hides.
---
Agreed lol, I was so hyped for my titan , but it lost all its magic after I realised how dull combat is with them
---
Yes, I have Planetology and Advanced Planetology to rank 4 and my PI estimates can be off 25-30%. It's quite frankly bullshit that it's off by that much with only missing 1 rank in each skill.
---
Or its a trap?  CCP Spamming fake bot sites to collect suspect IPs?
---
Unless it taking advantage of a exploit in your browser or a plugin, please don’t click on strange links, at best it lets them know your IP and how many people they can get to click a link.
---
/u/ccp_peligro outright said in that twitter chain that corps should be policing against bots.
---
They are able to see it, but CCP could see it much easier.
---
It could have been tbh. You got some nice 1k+ vollies once it was grappled.
---
Bout three fitty
---
Didn't you get kicked off the team?
---
So we should be assigning people to root out bits from our corporations with the outstanding tools provided by CCP to allow us to do this?
---
Goddamn newbies, the good old days &lt;2008 when, upon entering jita local (or Yulai before that) you would be bombarded by spam for isk purchasing to the point it would sometimes lag your shit.

---
Hey, dont include all bittervets in this statement. I'm no racist.
---
also at the start it might help to stick to one ship until you start at least getting some kills in it. learn that ship inside out and then go to others. some pilots that do this find that they learn quicker. use that one ship to engage most other targets and you will learn about how different ships behave.
---
Odd, I thought CSM was meant to respect the players, not run off with the rewards from tournaments. 🧐

As far as I’m concerned, you’re just out for yourself and couldn’t care less about us.

---
Well at least they're trying something...
---
Btw they're still bad compared to the t1 Triglavians.
---
The maximum damage multiplier bonus is NOT gonna work.
---
HAC and AF should just spool up faster than their T1 Version. I mean HAC and AF are supposed to assault. What kind of assault is it if it takes 3 mins to spool up...
---
Let's add this new nergal is like the old damavik with more tank and more dps (after 1 Min and half). There was a reason if the damavik was a fail right?
---
16km range with long range ammo for an AF is ridicolous. It should reach 30km with long range ammo. Otherwise we'll keep using kikis. More DPS, cheapier, way more range, pretty fast. Let's add even the Draugur is better than a nergal.
---
RIP the AF.
---
About the Draugur it needs more speed and it's done.
---
Per cycle, the damage increases by 5%. After 30 cycles they reach the maximum of 150% additional damage, while the ceiling is increased for the assault ships. So they can reach an even higher bonus, but need to spool up longer
---
Dont know what the first track was, but the second one is a remix of DJ Manian's song Raver's Fantasy.
---
I just went to delve in an algos enough times to start to understand solo and small ship pvp. I died a lot, but over time I started to figure out the bits and pieces.
---
Can't say I'd still recommend it with the assault frigate update making T1 destroyers largely obsolete as a solo roaming option, but it used to be a good choice.

Yup. And no you cannot have my stuff.

The items did eventually sell at the same price despite being much lower one jump away, but I imagine it was a simple minimum quantity requirement. Thanks for the replies, though
---
You realise the part of the recruitment process where someone applies for and joins a corp typically wouldn't be run by a bit, yes? A human being can apply for a corp and answer basic bullshit questions trhen activate a bot and go afk. What good will talking to them do?
---
How about option 3: stop posting you pubbie dipshit
---
Make those bots pay their tax.
---
Thanks! That's what I have mine up for with free shipping. Had it up for 400 quite a while back and it did not sell. I think 300 is fair.
---
who cares, tri is dead anyway
---
Calm down
---
you have my vote, based on your citadel proposals which i entirely agree with
---
Please dont get me banned, bro!
---
Neg wallet seems to just undo the damage the bot did, so it seems the minimal punishment, like banning the full alliance leadership if they have a disproportionate amount of bots and can't show how there actively deal with it would be more along the lines of my wish list.

---
Yup. I just checked the killboard. So far 1 bot got killed. But my guess is that there are brand new bots already in the making. Should check the contract history of one of the exploration bots. See which couriers are accepting more bot contracts. Match those bot names with zkillboard and you'll track them easily down.
---
Orion, it is good to hear you're doing well.  I do want to remind you that you were removed from the AT Team prior to us playing any matches due to a myriad of issues I will not be going into on reddit.
---
In terms of the AT rewards, they were given to the CEO of the holding corp (Garst Tyrell) who agreed to a system of handing out rewards based on attendance, which was created by my co-captain ElDiablo.  To hand out awards, Garst contracted AT ships directly to those pilots who earned them.
---
It saddens me that we weren't able to hand out an AT ship to every pilot and that our payout system was not as ideal as I would have hoped.

#Make dronelands great again
---
Lookh here is my problem with corps being asked to 'police botting'.
---
1. It doesn't eliminate the problem - a corp finding a botter can do 2 main things to 'police' them. 1. Report them to CCP.  We all know how likely that is to get them banned rapidly. 2. Kick and blacklist them. The bot owner then moves them to the nexg renter alliance. The problem is not solved, just moved. Meanwhile one of your rentors just accepted a bot who was kicked from PL.  You don't realise he is a bot for 3 weeks. Rinse repeat.
---
2.  The tools required are not present in game, meaning you rely on third party apps, and I'm unaware of one that makes this easy. If CCP want us to police corps in this way they should supply us with a tool to read the reelevent information from the ESI and format it in a way to make it easy to find botters.
---
3. There is literally no incentive to do this besides 'the good of the game'.  Now while we all agree getting rid of botters would be a good thing there is a big difference between altering my own behaviour to help the game and doing what basically amounts to volunteer GM work to help the game. Players should not be obliged to root bots out of their alliance.
---
4.  CCP could do so much more to find botters. There are tons of 23/7 Super botters who run for weeks/months at a time. How are they able to do this? How can players notice this sort of bot through observation but CCP cannot through DB analysis? Surely it should be a simple matter of querying the DB daily/weekly for anomalous time spent in game and flag those accounts for manual review?
---
I applaud CCPs endeavours to eliminate botters but despair at Peligros comment suggesting this is somehow the job of alliance and corporation leadership to police.
---
He hasn't been able to handle the russians, so no.
---
Anyone who is interested in this just hit me up in our discord

More models when, CCP?

Go out there and die a lot is exactly the right answer, but you have to learn from your mistakes.  Shadowplay your fights, you will be disgusted at how slow you react to things, or how many times you miss the obvious cues to how you should have played it.  Combat log will show you their weapon type, analyze when you flew in a bad pattern and took direct hits you didn't need to, etc.
---
I meant bots damn autocorrect
---
if you want to dick around as an alpha and play with high sec sites and occasional 1-hole-deep diving, you can pretty much do it the day you create your character with a tech 1 exploration frigate (heron, probe, etc)
---
if you're omega, you can use a covert ops frigate and a covert ops cloak, which will, with some practice, enable you to go just about anywhere you want
---
and with exploration, as long as you're not too worried about when you'll be able to make it back to a station and dock up for the night (not important at all for exploration except to sell your loot), you can pretty much come and go as you please
---
Yes. The loot in those otherwise was always garbage. Been a while but never got anything of value from those sites. Lost a bunch of ships though

Hang on I was on the AT team?!  When did this happen?   Also you mean the payout system that made sure only a few folks actually got stuff?  Where the folks who didnt want that method cried foul and you did nothing?  If this is how you run things good luck on your CSM....

Hmmm, less reliable then listing kirins and drugs in staging: check, requires me to go places I wouldn't otherwise go to play market games against bots: check, not apreciably easier to arrange then aforementioned listing stuff in nullsec staging: check, easily undercut by any random person with an iterion mk V while I have to use courier contracts or get through the quad sebo svipuls camping the Jita undock to move stuff: check. Yeah, no I just used a travel ceptor to grab stuff from jita since it ususally was small enough volume to be reasonable for my personal use.

---
&gt; To my knowledge, exactly one player-created problem in this game has been solved by CCP
---
You'd imagine that solving player-created problems would be rather central to running a MMO...
---
&gt; any alliance harboring bots
---
I love this phrase, as if the alliances that people like to point fingers at are intentionally trying to shelter or conceal the bots from CCP. Harboring a criminal in your house is inviting them in knowing that they're a criminal. 
---
What you really need to say to when proposing these punishments is "any alliance that allows bots to join their membership", but then people know that the proposal is crazy.
---
Can the region be changed? I prefer to go to Amarr for my trade hub.
---
Yes it can , it’s hard coded but no issue
---
That's a nice template, looks a bit like the CoreUI and AdminLTE MVC templates. Your own creation?
---
&gt; Why are people scared of alliances dissolving?
---
The stuff you propose wouldn't kill any alliances. They're totally fair things to do, but even the most bot-infested alliances have enough clean money that zeroing out the bot money wouldn't kill them off. And the alliances that are for nothing but renter holding, like B0T or PBLRD, the real owners wouldn't even be affected.
---
I think most of the people in this sub are looking for some kind of punitive damages above and beyond those.
---
I’ve got bad news for both of you :/

They might be bots.
---
Nice deflection attempt, you sound like a fucking politician already.
---
The bots will rise up and overthrow CCP
---
Yes, because if you run a club, you accept responsibility for what the members of that club do.
---
If you don't want that responsibility, don't run a club.
---
Ahh, okay, so it's okay that PL profited from blatant botting for years because it was *in the past*. Gotcha.
---
Some people play EVE to pvp, others to build shit, and some want to live out their middle management fantasies.
---
I never had access to the rewards.  As such, it would have been physically impossible to run off with the rewards.  They were handed out by the Alliance CEO to each member.
---
Thanks my man. Those blues were throwing me off.
---
It's fashionable to hide behind the belief that a big alliance simply can't control who joins. But it's a fiction: alliances are made up of corps, and corps are led by people, and those people eventually have to make decisions, including the decision of whether to accept the application of "WiaCddLaDebdle wqaZafDlckPo" to the alliance.
---
Sometimes, "WiaCddLaDebdle wqaZafDlckPo" is an alt of a known alliance member and someone just accepts the new "member" without thinking about it. The rest of the time, the alt is accepted itself by the alt's owner because they got an alt corp into the alliance by knowing the right person, who again makes that decision without thinking about it.
---
Not thinking about things has consequences in every other aspect of EVE. Why should this aspect be different? Being penalized for not having good control over who you let in your corp and who you let in your alliance might even incentivize smaller, better controlled corps and alliances.
---
It's China. You know decadent capitalist copyrights do not apply to China, a decadent authoritarian capitalist country with Marxist trimmings.

---
control what narrative?  there isnt any narrative to control.  Newsflash, we all every single one of us log onto this game to play a game.  They dont pay me to worry about whatever you are doing, if I see something suspicious I report it.  CCP has the tools to detect bad behavior, all we can do is help them to with the problem, it will never be completely irradicated.   There have always been ways to maximize efficiency in any game, no way to ever get rid of it all we and CCP can do is minimize it's impact to the rest of us.
---
Yup, Khermes. It’s not the best look when someone’s flying around losing AT ships when there are pilots from his team who haven’t received anything.
---
Incredible work, and incredibly intricate. Good job bro
---
And it really annoys Mark726 of https://evetravel.wordpress.com/ fame
---
Cheers dude, any feedback and suggestions are welcome
---
Am I the only one feeling that this is a measure against bots? More bots flying out to get the rarer minerals?
---
Friendly reminder that when you see someone getting injured on the street, you just ignore them and don't do anything to help at all or even bother calling 911, because that is literally the paramedics job and why you fucking pay taxes.
---
Oh wait
---
wise choice i feel
---
There really aren't any. And you can't really explain how it works without a bunch of previous knowledge of the game outside of whs. It's not so easy to ELI5. If you want to learn about whs your best bet is to join a wh corp.
---
&gt;  This is one of the key components of my platform,
---
You had me at "we need the AT back."
---
Great work against the bots, I'll be voting for you.
---
Bring a t1 frigate. Come to black rise. You'll get fights guaranteed.
---
Do you have any evidence of blatant botting that PL profited from because if you do, I'd turn it in.  Otherwise you're just firing shots in the dark.  If I were to accuse an alliance, like say Blades of Grass, of botting, I'd be able to back it up with data, like say killing the bots obvious weak points for say, 4 or 5 days, killing the same guys over and over again.
---
You know, real evidence thats not theory and speculation.
---
This game needs less brave faux celebrities in important positions, not more
---
Are you playing on a Big Mac xp professional by any chance?

Find a small, PVP geared corp. I'd recommend you avoid Null blocs and big hi-sec alliances.

Time Dilation in Eve Online makes the game unbearable because players can suddenly be on a ship, with no way of saving or resuming movement. This affects everyone and the game ends instantly, with no warning to anyone. This is the most frustrating aspect to come about in EVE for some people. Even the most experienced players have found it annoying and uncomfortable to feel as if they are in something they cannot interact with. Even in solo gameplay, players often tend to not be able to engage unless the AI is on the move. The game is quite forgiving since everything is so simple, but to put it bluntly, TiDi sucks the life out of it.
---
If you are going to push for rate of fire on Phoenix, then maybe push to have a range increase. All other dreads can hit out really far. Phoenix sort of sucks in that department.
---
That’s a cop-out and a failure of leadership on your part. You have a responsibility as Captain to ensure your members are taken care of. Shirking those duties betrays your misunderstanding of leadership traits and qualities and disqualifies you as a future leader.
---
Actually some of us bitter vets sat and called people like you 'racist cocksucker'.
---
That would be slower than a Cynabal for this. Slower speed, slower targeting, slower aligning and on top of that you'd have more tracking issues.
---
*Nobody* calls me chicken!
---
But i like shooting you :(
---
Then botters would move to another ship.
---
Theres a megathron model on ebay for 400 +shipping
---
And a tempest for 300
---
&gt; It's more like running around looking for targets to gank, and if you find one that is an obvious bot report it.
---
so you do what the majority of people already do? hate to break it to ya but that's the standard and has always been the standard, no cookie for ya.
---
I love politically incorrect answers. 👌🏻
---
Time to set my alt corp to 100% tax to see you report it.
---
Treasury are Fraternity's renters, from what I've read in this thread.

Huzah!

Get that, thank you and have a nice day.
---
Supporting botters inside the swarm has not always been a thing. And it's awful that it became a stance.
---
So all those empty feyth systems I flew through last night were just local bugs? You must have a giant list. Everyone here just keeps naming a region but not actual bots. Give us name of bots and we will report them.
---
It's 30 million ISK.

"I got jury duty … and I didn't want to go, so my friend said, "You should write something really really racist on the form when you return it. Like, you should put 'I hate chinks'."

The idea with plex was to make them worthwhile to run and to stick around for pvp. With your proposal FW will just die. No one would run larges ever as it would be just begging for the neutrals to bring in their kitey ships at range.
---
Also looks like you met wlrazganzi and wlrazgan. The bot is dumb as fuck. The ventures are 100% farmable. More predictable than a L4 mission.

If a player speedhacks in wow does their guild get reprimanded? If a player aimhacks in Planetside 2 does their outfit get reprimanded? If a player uses a bot to harvest in Ultima Online does their guild get reprimanded?
---
Why is this the only MMO where the guild is punished for the actions of its players. At present it isn't, but Peligro is certainly hinting that it should be.
---
And I like getting shot at by you! #content
---
It looks awesome btw! Good job.
---
You heard me
---
or ccp could just do their job instead of expecting paying customers to police their game
---
Took some fiddling, but i was able to get a pretty cheap 10mn loki (t2 large shield booster) able to run them consistently. I got a few ok-ish drops, mainly implants and some of those hyperdrive bpc's. Shooting the structure also drops the covert research tools, which are semi pricey.

Don't like it.. Dread bomb the titans.. Or maybe don't warp at 0 on a gate when a titan is in system.
---
Hey thanks! Just joined
---
If they would now reduce the CPU load spike after banner change it would be even better.
---
&gt; All isk that originated from bots is removed. Doesn’t matter how they launder it, it is tracked and deleted. 
---
nice joke

The biggest issue with capital ship proliferation in Eve online is that the cost difference between a capital ship and an average ship increases linearly with distance, which means that ships such as frigates, destroyers and cruisers, all of which are designed around capital ships, are not as expensive from a player's perspective as small vessels (such as destroyers); and cruisers can, therefore, provide the greatest strategic value.
---
So, I would say there is a significant problem with capital ship proliferation, and this has created a vacuum ripe for capital vessel pirates, particularly at low player counts, to swoop in and take the high ground. This can cause an environment wherein it is almost impossible to build any other capital ship that will fit into the same style of PvP. The capital ship is the most powerful vehicle in the game on average, but at a huge price penalty to other players.

Congratulations, Captain Non-sequitur. You've done it again.

If you're not a bot when CCP investigates they'll see that. NBD

Hey retard.

Hands of is the same as condoning.
---
precisely that, he just feeds dude.
---
If a player aimhacks in CSGO their team does get dq'd. Just saying.
---
This is also one of the few games where the guild directly profits from the botters (taxes) and where people have been vocal about discouraging reports on alliance members for this very thing.
---
The games aren't the same and shouldn't be treated as such.
---
Oijanen
---
I do think those tools and the mining ledger should be redone as they aren't adequate but if you suspect it's not that hard to check for ratting.
---
yeah. you dont become a skilled FC just because you can fly a monitor.
---
Or it could just be a tab in game under corporation/members/suspected bots
---
Thank you
---
If CCP can populate a "these players are bots" tab, why the hell do players need to do anything? They can just ban them.
---
You sound like a BOT sympathizer desperately trying to hide something... Enjoy ur ban kid
---
DQd from the event, sure, but not punished beyond that. Also its far easier to police a 5 person team than a 5k person alliance.
---
Not thinking about who you let into your alliance already has consequences, ones that are vastly higher than any other game. A perennial problem CCP has with retention is players not joining up with other player groups.
---
A big penalty for allowing a bot to join your group does not actually incentivize smaller groups, it incentivizes higher barriers to entry. You're concerned with the real person, not "WiaCddLaDebdle wqaZafDlckPo". And WiaCddLaDebdle's owner isn't going to admit to being a botter. The guy wants access to your space to bot, now you have to regard every application with that suspicion. It's way easier to lie about secretly botting than a spy who needs to craft a whole fictional life.
---
That does have a knock-on effect of shrinking groups simply by making the management load far worse, and making new players be automatically rejected by everyone. Do you *really* think that will be good for the game?
---
\#3 is mitochondria
---
Omg your telling me.. I like that there isnt everything on it but jesus key things like isis and wallet ffs lol
---
i bought mine off ebay for 200 a few years ago
---
Goons parrot this line because they feel that it justifies allowing bots to operate in their space. By declaring that it's CCP's job to police bots and not the collective playerbase's, they are tacitly permitting the use of bots in their space.
---
what is your stance on catgirls? will we be able to buy them in the new eden store?
---
&gt;  KWG for example has been a known botting alliance, leadership in KWG knows about, but TEST just takes the money
---
Do you have specific names? Or is this just a general "I've seen memes about botting taking place but don't actually know specifics" kind of thing?
---
Just drag and drop it on the bar. But agree...default it should be on it. Came back from a few years break and had no idea where any of my buttons were...
---
incredible
---
So you mean the post from mittani about do not report blue bots wasn't a thing?
---
Accuracy?  Have a check box; bot, not bot, unknown and let CCP deal with the hate.

are there actually dudes on the tri team who got nothing? surely you paid them isk instead from sold ships if they didn't have high enough participation for a full ship? seems crazy not to

Open source?

And the award for shortest CSM Campaign goes to &lt;drum roll&gt;...

*Points at Phear shaped hole in wall*
---
Still in dev but considering
---
I think the guilds in those instances should be punished if they at all profit from the action.
---
In eve, corps have taxes and alliances charge corps fees derived from those taxes. Unlike your other game examples, where the guilds do not profit, in eve they do.
---
You're completely missing the point, my retarded friend. And just to help you in future, "don't warp at 0 on a gate" doesn't work when you jump through a gate to see titans. Don't bother replying until you can see your hypocrisy ("you want to hunt things that don't shoot back?"), sweaty.
---
I'm sorry, I can't stand behind someone who supports copious use of the F word
---
WTS rigged Murky Ghost, Gallente Navy issue, dm me
---
You're overstating the negative to try to make a point. At the end of the day, the biggest corps and alliances aren't going to stop recruiting, ever. If the incentive is to build a better filter and keep bots out before they join, then alliances will build those filters. They've built far more complicated filters over the last ten years to keep out spies and thieves.
---
But even I take your question 100% on its own merit, and the question is "If all new players were rejected by the big huge alliances, do I think that would be good for the game?" In the aggregate? Yes. Yes, I do. Because then new players would join the smaller alliances instead, we'd have some alternatives out there, and we could maybe do a little something about the rot and stagnation that has wrecked EVE.
---
Can we just have the old default imagine being a newbro and having to sort trough a hidden menu to find your wallet/mails/etc
---
The wallet and fleet are the 2 that are mind boggling to me that they would miss that.
---
I already went over this with another poster who seems mentally absent from the world. If you pass by litter and if theres trash can nearby, the normal thing to do is to pick it up and put it in the trash.  If you pass by a crime in progress you report the crime because it's the normal thing to do.
---
If somebody is shiting up your community you flag the relevant Authority for what they're doing to shit it up, even though there are people paid to find those people doing those things
---
If the only way you know how to lead is assigning tasks I'll double down on my gotta that your aren't the right one to be leading.
---
There is no way they actually play the game. Like whoever designed this definitely doesn't play eve. Syre they test it but they dont play outside of work. I feel like a lot of the bad default settings are because of this. Especially the overview lol.
---
And this kids is what 7y of abuse do to a graphics card

To be fair, up until the most recent Imperium bluing they have then fought that group immediately (or shortly) thereafter. And they will fight the Imperium in due course I'm sure.

I have one issue with it, and I may just be dumb... can it not automatically close to tray after launching? I haven't found the option anywhere in the settings.
---
Enjoy :) as always criticism is appreciated.
---
I was on the AT team with Anveri and played in over half the matches. I even got a shout out on air from the commentators. But that isn’t important.
---
What is important is that Anveri and the assistant captain (who was the real fc talent, if not also a emo child who rages at the slightest provocation because ~maturity~)proposed and implemented a payout scheme for the TRI pilots of the AT based on theoretical payout values that they were warned were unrealistic and would not payout pilots accurately or in a timely manner, due to the low demand for the prize ships. Anveri ignored this warning, and payed out himself, the assistant captain, and other people who they felt most deserving (aka their corp members) vastly inflated sums of isk and prize ships, while over half the team received nothing but a set of skins. Aka 200-300b+ in value to some, sub 5bil to others. To this day, almost a year later, half of the team has gotten nothing, contrary to their promises of payout from Anveri.
---
While Anveri did a decent job figuring out the meta with the assistant captains, when the time came to intelligently handle our victory and ensure those under his responsibility were taken care of and rewarded for their work, he instead decided to enrich himself and those closest to him while shutting out the rest from getting prizes. In my mind, he is completely untrustworthy to hold such a position as CSM.
---
Further more, I retain a list of all the people who were fucked over and never paid, as well as all logs from the AT discord showing the warnings that were given, as well as the immature reactions and ad hominem attacks on people’s character that Anveri and the assistant captains made against people who stated their concerns about the payout methodology. I guess if the intent was always to bluefuck their own team, can’t have people using their brains and questioning where all the isk is going.
---
Garst Tyrell, alliance leader for TRI, will confirm everything I’ve said here, because not only was he in channel for all of the above mentioned discussions, we have had this exact conversation together when discussing the issue and of blacklisting Anveri from ever working with TRI again.
---
So does everyone else.
---
People have been doing this for decades.  Taking one look at the defendant of a murder case and saying something like “I hate all n_____s they all need to hang from a rope” 
---
Easiest excusal ever.
---
... and at the end of their journey, they found that the EVE Online was inside them all along.
---
&gt; This already happened with Mittani defending bots about a year ago. 
---
Yet it had no negative diplomatic effect on his alliance, that's the problem there is a cultural of acceptance.
---
Glad I'm not the only one. Just recently had to do this on all of my alts
---
&gt; why should I help CCP "for the good of the game" when there's no direct incentive for me, and my actions went change anything anyway, plus it would totally take, like, some effort.
---
This is actually a great idea. Fights, especially frigates, tend to be over so fast that it's hard to pinpoint what you may have done wrong (or right).
---
I genuinely don't see that as a very unreasonable statement. I pay money to play this game I shouldn't have to volunteer as a GM on top of that.
---
Nope, there was no post about that at all.
---
Are you, perhaps, referring to the out-of-context quote from a Fireside chat, an audio-only medium?
---
Even still, it's not what I'm talking about. I ain't interested in being needled into a defensive posture over whatever sputum you've coughed up because you are upset about video games. Try it on someone less savvy.
---
...we have caps?

Years ago, shortly after ccp added the Boson, the enemy fleet dropped a Titan on our Harpyfleet and he Bosoned nearly 40 Guys in one Sweep. Was sexy af
---
If you look closely, you can even see a fleet on the other side of the wormhole.
---
To be clear, hi-sec exploration is nice for figuring out the mechanics of scanning and hacking, but should definitely not be used as a measure of how profitable exploration is. Wormhole and null-sec sites can be hundreds or thousands of times more profitable.
---
Premassed I see too
---
he is just mad the he doesn't have caps
---
imho sounds like you are asking for things you must learn from experience. even if you get perfect info on all aspects of pvp, it is conditional and complex enough that you will not easily remember which info for exactly which situation. I recommend dramatically narrowing the scope to a ship and fit (brawl, kite, tank, etc) and once that is done the conversation around range, ammo, and type of engagements become simple enough to chew on. Chew you must in order to get familiar with each setup/engagement. Once familiar with one set, move on to the next, and so on until you have a variety of experience.
---
I love how twice you've said that I'm a bad leader but have yet to offer any alternatives to the two ways you think I am saying to tackle this.  How, other than doing this "myself" or assigning/asking someone else to do this do you expect me, as a leader, to get someone to police my corporation for botters?  
---
Just for the record I don't lead a corp or alliance.
---
If someone is banned for botting the money they gave to the corp in way of taxes should be removed.  I have no issue with that.  I am against further punitive action being taken unless it can be proven that the corporation/alliance leadership KNEW that this person was a bot, and if they corporation/alliance leadership were expected to know then CCP should have known too.
---
Usually people pay me to dig through their math errors.

Your Drekavac damage is 5% above what you would actually get, checked on TQ, SiSi, Pyfa 2.9.3dev and Pyfa 2.9.3.

I assume you have either included a DB5 Pyro II or an SS-905 implant, both of which end up matching your spreadsheet numbers precisely.

It's not by some alliances it's basically all leadership, because if they don't directly support it via a renting program there unlikely to not be blue to somebody that does. ( or neutral with benefits in some cases ).
---
In way almost every alliance seem to benefit via some indirect method from bots on the line member level almost nobody is willing to drop corp on this issue ( to be fair there is almost nowhere to go ) and on the leadership level there is nobody going fuck this if you rent a large chunk of space to bots diplomatic agreements be dammed where gonna attack you. ( or even write it into agreements ).

Concord should shoot anything that undock in jita*

We need a way to export HUD layouts and import them as easily as overview presets. 
---
Layout export could revolutionize assisting new players or acclimating existing to life in a new space region.
---
The overview does have some weird limits people don't consider, like 800x600 compatibility meaning you can't have masses of default columns or tabs, or it won't be usable out of the box on all systems. That said, the poor default filtering type really stings, and it's something I highlighted by making a [suggested new default](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/improving-the-default-overview/51656/2).

Ya that was crazy. You sure you're not in goons?

When I finally won eve I built at least 20 SMARTPHOONs and bombed 4-4. Good times. Harvested lots of implant rage evemails.
---
The hac is still way too slow. 1850m/s base with mwd just aint it for a non-face brawl ship. That number needs to be at least 2k/s. The range is ok, but not enough imo. The hac is barely faster than the drek, has much less range, less damage until its been shooting for like 1.5 minutes, no links, and a resist profile that while nice, requires the patching of two holes. The extra pg of the drek also makes it outclass the iki. The top end damage is nice, but i think it will just be too hard to make use of it.

---
BOT FUCKING TIME
---
I find it hilarious how many corps/alliances may be here rooting for CCP to go harder on bots, and even rooting for "tell us who they are", but knowing and silently accepting that they have bots in their own corps somewhere making money for them.
---
I would laugh so hard, if, after CCP shows who the bots belong to, someone finds reddit posts or forum posts, showing how they were against bots before that stuff was released ...
---
Had a talk a couple days ago with someone around fade, and he knew about the bot problem in that area ... so i said that there are whole systems only full of bots ... and since they know, why don't they just close the docking in the citadels as they are owned by them ... answer was "there would be some serious diplomatic incidents with their parent-alliances ... naming Ranger Regiments" ... but then me asking why i am raging so hard against bots and all kind of nullsec corps if i had to read that shit ... the guy that told me was really only someone on the bottom, otherwise he would have never told me about that argument ... but if the line member knows about it ... you can easily imagine how their deep their directo- ship from corps and alliance and corp-leaders are kneeing in that botting-shit. 
---
Lets see whose heads will be rolling soon ...
---
We had a thread on the forums about it, half the clowns/trolls/idiots said it was a good change.
---
Oh, are we doing this meme again?
---
Hey duder,
---
Your account very likely still exists. CCP hasn't done account cleanup in forever, and when they did i believe they only cleaned up trial accounts (that never upgraded).
---
Game is still chugging along, CCP is still making changes to it and either making us happy or pissing us off. The player base has shrunk a bit but unlikely to necessarily be a noticeable amount depending on the things you're doing.
---
Alliances are still fighting each other and shooting stuff, and skill injectors/extractors make it so training into new things is handy for coming back.

If you're on the lookout for corps you should remember that [dreddit is still recruiting](https://dredditisrecruiting.com)

Hahaha. I know it seems rather obvious but you must mean that I'm just going to make a big mess because EvE is going to make me happy again. I like people who can talk to each other in different ways.

You're right. For your whole life now, you've been playing in the same way and you're enjoying the thing. I mean, there are lots of people who have just been playing solo, but you've done it too.
---
I hope the people who were saying "Ah, well all these people like solo" are lying when they say this will be a waste of time. It won't be wasted. It's a real possibility, a good opportunity. EvE Online is not the thing where you're all alone. If the people who play can manage to find something and meet each other and get together, even if it's only on weekends, why don't you all get together to play. It's probably an area of the

&gt;800x600 compatibility

&gt;or it won't be usable out of the box on all systems
---
newsflash, it already isn't usable out of the box on all systems, the overview is already too small and doesn't fit all the tabs it has on it, of the ones that already are there half are hidden. Also who the fuck even uses 800x600 and why is it even worth supporting them over actually getting a usable default?
---
either the dev who said this to you is mentally challenged or he's just lying to mask for incompetence. Or both really, not like it would be a surprise with ccp.
---
As far as WoW goes:

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769647982?page=1
---
I have heard the possibility of new ores as well. It is possible they are setting up these zones for multiple methods of engagement. Alternatively, the events themselves may require mining as I believe one of the incursion sites do. 
---
Either way, the inside of these incursion systems is quite dangerous, I can attest to that. If anything, it will be a reward for those who can secure the area against the Triglavian. (or perhaps an opportunity to work for them? )
---
Glad to hear that freaky.
---
If you were a Serpentis higher up you probably also wouldn't send quite literally tens of thousands of ships a day to their certain death defending some stargate, whose purpose is nebulous at best, in some backwater null system.

---
that's pretty crazy - it's very common to just sell some of the ships to cover ISK payouts. that way people who did not have high enough participation for a full ship still get paid out in ISK which covers the high amount of effort they put into practice.

as far as I know most top teams have worked on a system similar to this, no?

Does test allow this kind of hate-speech in Brave?

lmao if you consider gatecamping serpentis prime good content. Venal, curse, pure blind are all empty as shit. No real pvp at all.

"because you have autism"
---
Oh fuck off. Ccp doesnt do shit unless we make big waves on reddit, so fucking can it retard.
---
The point was that even in Holywood, rascism isn't tolerated, even for the purpose of satire.
---
CCP does not read each corps tax inputs every day, thats not possible and suggesting it is, is ridiculous.  
---
Corp leadership DOES however look at its finances every day, you can see the guy thats dumping taxes into your corp 7 days a week 20 hours a day.  
---
Suggesting you as the CEO or directorate aren't likely to notice that kind of behavior and or shouldn't be punished for not following through on said information is dumb.
---
The 800x600 issue is something of a cop out IMO. I have to deal with making complex UIs across a range of displays on a daily basis, and if I had such a large amount of evidence to suggest part of it was that harmful to the majority of players, I'd make two versions and let the overwhelming majority have an improved version.
---
Really cool u/Zombiefoetus the craftpersonship is over the top have you tried talking to CCP about making a licensed product they can sell on their website this would be a billion times better than their current merch. I think you casted this right could you potentially mass produce this beautiful models? Anyway hope you get a good sale.
---
I see dead people
---
Nah, this happens to me too whenever I change a graphics setting and exit the menu. New rig, so it's definitely a glitch, if not that annoying of one.

Yeah this would be super cool hope CCP listens to you my friend.

anyone know how to turn off aura btw

Nice to see a new video. I still lose a few too many frigs to go running around in those.

Is there a good way for a solo player to learn low class wormhole life? It seems interesting, but I would like to try some of it out for myself before applying to a wormhole corp. Any suggestions to start? I can fly a battleship and below, all missile fits, and have an Astero where I can scan down level 4 sites. I only have 7.5M SP, figured that's not enough for anything higher class.

yeah why does the leshak gets such low DPS. is it using pulse

IKR so unintuitive.

It should be named TJ HOOKER!

you say that but 600 newboys have joined Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere and Fraternity just the other day, they are all using 800x600.  The data never lies.

it knows... too much
---
Heck, even the ability to copy your layouts across machines would be nice. Or being able to load different layouts depending on what ship I'm in.
---
Web dev here; I deal with the same thing, except I have to make sure layouts look good anywhere from super large desktop screens down to 320px-wide mobile screens. My instinct here would be to assign priorities to different elements; if there's not enough room to display all of the default elements, start hiding lower priority items as necessary.

It is probably a result of EVE's rounding function. CCP\_round has historically been somewhat buggy. It should only effect the displayed value and not effect the accrual industry output though.

You can day trip, and there are probably videos out there. That being said it is better to learn about it through a corp then trying to go at it alone. living solo in a WH is definitely possible, but there is a lot to learn if you aren't already familiar with WH life, and the best place to learn about WH life is a WH corp.

I have disagreed with anveri on quite a few things during the time I spent with him but he's a good dude.
---
Dunno about this AT stuff but from my personal time with him I'd say he's alright. He ran a 9/10 with me in immense and it was fun. Didn't ask me to pay him back for his lost fighter.
---
They have a lot more data actually :P  
---
Also while they allow alliances to easily spot bots no alliance seems to be interested in doing it :thinking:
---
Yes thankfully bots all have easy to identify names like that, so its both and easy and obvious to ban them.
---
I honestly do no know how most other teams do payouts. Only ever been on the TRI team. But however they do it, I doubt they do it in such a way where half the team gets stiffed on payouts.
---
Sounds like the perfect candidate. Maybe he can champion a different payout system for the alliance tournament since he has experience screwing over his team mates with the current system.

I am sure this is out of context.

Can you pls apply at CCP? I heard its a safe job there... \*cough, cough\*
---
This and feel free to make your own tabs. I have WH specific ones depending on what I'm doing. I also make the background color or not- friendlies blink to better grab my awareness if I'm playing while tired or otherwise occupied.
---
Yep.
---
Shame he couldn't find more spaces to link to his website.
---
who pissed in your cheerios?
---
I never said that, and I can't because this shit hurts. :(
---
If you see it, do something about it, say something to your superiors, report it to CCP. You don't need to go out, hunting your own space for bots. But if you're hunting for enemy Krabs, krabbing in your own space, or running HD fleets and see it... Say something, do something.
---
And if you're corp/alliance leadership... Well, if you can keep eyes on enemy fleet movements, infrastructure developments,
---
If you think CCP learns from their mistakes, ever, then lol.
---
Ha! I wish I made this. I live in Atlanta, where they are based and found it at a Goodwill.
---
Off topic sorta:
---
My wallet has been about 4 days behind for about 2 weeks now.  Ticket sent in and still no fix.
---
and then there are also old ass web browser on old phones what will butcher up your website and everything will look like shit no matter what you do
---
I live in Curse and that's objectively false. There's content plenty, just the type varies from timezone to timezone. 
---
Fountain has FCore and elements of Rote.
---
Syndicate has elements of Rote, INIT, E-Uni, and some other randos
---
Pure Blind still has a contingent of Banderlogs who prefer Mordus over anom grinding
---
Outer Ring is dead iirc. I dont venture out there.
---
Venal has some Out of Sight, and plenty of rusrus locals outside of the main burner pipe.
---
Great Wildlands is alive with randos due to Citadels, and the entrance/pipe to K-I/Geminate is pretty active.
---
Stain is plenty active with the remnants of stain wagon plus all the regular stain residents.
---
And that's just within those areas themselves. Some locals use the NPC space for staging raids/roams into surrounding territories without javing to drop Citadels or claim sov for good isk making, as pirate burners are a good individual ISK generator through the valuable LP stores.
---
There's no reason to try and revamp NPC Null right now when efforts can be shifted elsewhere like FW and nonFW lowsec.
---
so its like reddit then

Ask one of the Paladins.

The damage control is near useless in the fit you are going for. Now what I'd recommend is replacing it with a low slot mod that I creases shield regen.if you are going passive it'll help a ton.
---
Other tips: 
---
Only run gamma in your fit
---
Always be moving perpendicular to the battleship as it I very hard for it to hit you if you have a high transversal.

No. Like I said, go try needling someone else into a defensive posture over it.

So it's bullshit because context was literally provided in the video.
---
Yes more ways to visually Id ships would be better no sarcasm it would be really good
---
plenty of people saying it on reddit nonstop these days.
---
[try this layout](https://i.imgur.com/VSqEDI8.png)
---
Pretty sure Diablo was the captian
---
The thing to understand is that your engagement profile as a solo T1 cruiser is very narrow. In nullsec, many fits revolve around cooperation with other ships, and most ships smaller than you that you'll see are either designed to tackle (with heavy backup on the way), or are designed specifically to roast VNIs.
---
You can fit for anti-tackle, but the trick is that you'll have to be non-obvious, you'll have to be able to hold a very fast frigate/destroyer for long enough to kill it, and you'll have to be able to kill it fast enough to escape before its backup arrives. This is doable, but will require specific fitting choices and piloting choices. You'll frequently run into locals who won't undock anything until they're prepared to undock overwhelming force, and then you'll just die.
---
You can fit to try to hunt ratters, but there's a reason that most hunters these days use very fast tackle ships, subterfuge, or both. You probably won't catch anything with a solo cruiser.
---
You can fit to crash gate-camps, but the trick will be to figure out which gate-camps you can crash, and to note that (just like with the bait approach) you need to look juicy enough for the campers to go for you while being spiky enough to kill them and escape before the escalation arrives. I'm fond of crashing gate-camps, myself, but I would be hesitant to do it with a T1 cruiser. Most small camps that I've seen lately have involved a mix of frigates and battleships.
---
I'm sure it was, sweetie.
---
Thanks for that.  What do you use?
---
Except that headline is hilariously misleading. One of the members was caught RMTing raid runs, so everyone involved in the RMT raid run was banned for 6 months, not the entire guild. Its just the people on the raid run made up the core of the guild.
---
Is that V planet upgrades or w/e its called?
---
Corp wallet live updates when????
---
I mean he starts by reading the question so that's what is called context. So you are saying people should believe you on reddit instead of things mittani literally said.
---
&gt; but it's quite different to say they HAVE to do it.
---
As CEO, of a corp or an alliance, you can already be punished for things your members do in game. I actually agree with this, as you agree'd to be leader, nobody forced you to take responsibility for those people.
---
So nobody is suggesting the common man be punished, but you agreed to lead and manage a group of people, that comes with certain pro's and cons, one of the cons is you eat the shit sandwiches your corp creates.
---
If you don't like that dont lead a corp or alliance, but theres plenty of precedent for CEO's being punished for the crimes of their membership.
---
Your players distance from it in terms of systems or LYs is also accounted for if im not mistaken.
---
You should be MWD/Cloak tricking to prevent getting caught.  Unless its a mega-gatecamp from hell its easy to avoid it all, especially with the base warp core strength of DST.  My personal DST has 2 stabs so it takes 2 scrams+ another to prevent warp.  Anyway, the cloak trick pretty much prevents it all anyway unless you come out of the gate right on top of them.    
---

What aspects of wormholes are you looking to learn?
---
If that's not a good question, how are you currently interacting with wormholes? Day-tripping in a covops frigate? Living in a C1?
---
CCP absolutely does read every single transaction that happens in the game, and feeds them into a database. The wonderful thing about databases is you can pare a HUGE amount of information down to a simple manageable amount in no time at all. For example, run a query for players who received more than 72 ratting income ticks in a day. Oh look, everyone who rat more than 18 hours. And because you are running HR query on 24 hours of transactions you don't even run into that much of an issue.
---
And don't say quantities of data like this aren't handled by CCP on a regular basis, the MER deals with tens of millions of transactions on a monthly basis.
---
Being subtly condescending doesn't change the facts as much as you wish it would.
---
Oh god no.. Put a storage in there. If you dont have room to output your factories stuff it will keep running and consuming but not giving you the product.
---
Of course I'm in goons.

It was really epic until we found out the mother was also sucking that nipple before.

On one hand CCP is selling those nonrefundable cosmetics nonstop
---
On the other hand EVE is plagued with injected alts that almost demolish the sense of character building or role playing
---
You know what? Skin extractor ccplz, I had so many injected ship skins that could exchange into good isk these days
---
Oh it's just the most important resource in the game. We'll just put it back here somewhere so it's not in the way.

Subtly? I'm treating you like a child, because you're acting like one.

(downvoted)

You could always check on [evewho.com](https://evewho.com) to see if your characters are still there in the game.

Command Center Upgrades V yes you needed and interplanetary Consolidation V is what you primary need the rest is IV enough to start PI

Welp, you got me.
---
Against Frat? Why not ban kids with Guns botters that have been funding TEST since day 1? oh wait...wont benefit your alt in Legacy I forgot...wasnt this why CCP Guard was "let go" for taking bribes from Legacy?
---
Fairly sure you break into a sweat when bots start getting hunted. Go back to official forums, where you'll actually fit in :)
---
In frigates and industrials... Veldspar all the way... :D
---
Pissing off NullBears is kind of a hobby for me. As long as a Wormholer has a seat at the end of this cycle I'll be happy. Wormhole space is everything to me, and that goes for even if I don't win.
---
Yea I trained it and promptly extracted it. Not enough tangible benefit for me personally but I dont run PI everyday maybe weekly at best lol
---
[Apparently you can](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/manually-copy-settings-between-characters-and-accounts/32704), but it's nowhere near as easy as it should be
---
Might just be slightly out of the socket, I've had cards that weren't secured well do this. (Specifically the 2nd/4th image)
---
Oh, but that’s the beauty of exploration—an alpha can do pretty much all of it. As soon as you have something like 10 or 15 million isk, I would suggest heading into nullsec or wormholes in search of greater profits. As long as you stay alert, you should be relatively safe. 
---
Always keep zkillboard open so you can check how dangerous a player or system is. Stick to C1-3 wormholes, as higher class holes don’t have pirate hacking sites (all sleeper hacking sites require combat that you won’t be able to handle, and the loot from the cans isn’t great anyways). If you want to go to nullsec, one easy way is to use Thera. The eveuniversity wiki is also a pretty great resource for learning about exploration/wormhole mechanics. 
---
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me!

I like to solo-stealth bomb in null like an ass-hat, chucking bombs at whatever in hopes of getting a kill or just blowing the mining drones off horde moon-ops..
---
one time I lined up on a few mining ships, I de-cloak, drop the bomb, and immediately an enemy hostile decloaks as well and targets me, burning at me. I locked on him, aligned to my exit and hit a target dampener with the range script and MWD, sending me flying away and breaking his lock and allowing me to recloak.
---
"Well played" he says.
---
I still smile thinking about how slick it seemed, and the fact that it worked. I've not gotten that lucky since or before.
---
its not an eve glitch sir, this is an issue with your hardware or drivers.  Just because something is new doesn't mean its free from defects.
---
I'm mostly interest in what kinds of counter intel tools Peligro is going to give to alliance leaders so they can effectively police bots in the game.  Since alliances are going to be expected to do his job for him the least he can do is give alliance leaders full access to the same information he has now.
---
Me too, I guess I could buy a titan for all I've spent on skins. But those "Victory"...
---
It's like in American military culture, people differentiate special ops/special forces with "big army". Bitch, the only thing we had over the big army was budget, we still did pushups

Fewer
---
&gt; the one guy with no life who super rats 10 hours a day in his grandma's basement. 
---
That's a bot.  (But besides that, I get your point.)
---
Maybe spurge a bit on the bling? If your tank is lacking, maybe RF LSE's or DG/CN/pith c-type invulns?
---
That's projecting a little much. My stance has been, here's evidence to support what I'm saying, requests for additional information, and not resorting to condescending remarks(until now). So if that is behaving like a child we should all strive to be more like children.
---
This so much
---
Nifflers?
---
let me guess, every "blue" in null would be considered a bot?
---
It's an item in League of Legends that makes your spells explode into magical orbs when you hit someone with them after running in circles for a while, I believe
---
PMed!
---
So if you don't have the third party tools or people to make them for you then you aren't allowed to have an alliance?  CCP can't expect players to police anything without giving those players the means to do so.
---
Good tip. I am too used to my BR having cloak that I didn't even think of that option.
---
Don't have pyfa by my hand, make sure your passive tank surpasses 500, don't go shy on blinking up your ships with better modules
---
What? We never drop on FW dudes.... if they come off some of that dank LP isk. ;) 
---
We left FW due to that crap. The person with the most botters/farmers wins. PVP didn't really effect the tiers nearly as much expect to cap the I-hubs. FW is basically dead at this point, the golry days of actual good fights is long gone. The side with the best isk payout for the farmers will be who wins more times than not. What is the way to make em worth while? Cool to make em worth while to stick around but how? We going Fuzzy sov on the plexs? Killing all the farmers by forcing them to stay in the plex will make it worth while for REAL people when their LP isn't watered down to piss. 
---
That is them. Horrible bots. I do not know how they have not been banned as a corp. I even recorded it because it was so dumb.
---
The main thing to know before moving into a wormhole is that your residence **must** have multiple characters. They don't have to all be you, and if they are you they can be all on the same account, but you must have multiples.
---
Why? Because sooner or later you're going to get rolled out of your home, and unless you have a spare ready to scan you back in, you will never find your home again.
---
If I haven't scared you off yet, the first and most important choice you will need to make is what statics you want to have. To decide this, think about what activities you want to do. With only 7.5m sp and (presumably) only one active trained pilot, you can largely ignore C4, C5, and C6 statics from a PVE perspective. a C2 with a C2 or C3 static will let you rat in a solo Rattlesnake (or a well-fit battlecruiser or Gila). Any w-space static will let you ninja-huff gas. Having only a k-space static will allow you to be a bit safer about ratting/huffing/mining in your home. For PVP, a static to the right type of k-space lets you find content there. A static C2, C4, or C5 might find w-space PVP corps for you to fight, but be aware that you're basically not equipped to fight any of us solo. You alone won't look like brawl content. You'll look like a gank target. You can mitigate that by actively saying hi and asking for 1v1s and such, and you'll need to figure out which wormhole corps can be trusted with that and which can't.
---
My recommendation for a solo player who's pretty new would be to drop an Astrahus or Raitaru in a C2-&gt;C3/Highsec. Fit it for anti-subcap. Fuel it. Don't rig it (those rigs are super expensive!). Your logistics will be easy. You'll be able to rat in your static to make isk. And you'll be able to go through incoming wormholes or roll for a static with incomings to hunt for w-space content.
---
The jackdaws will disappear as soon as fw comes off t5. Right now all the noobies and solo vets alike are flying jacks cause they can pull 0.5-1.5 bil an hour depending on effort/skill. I don't think I've seen any jack bots.

I really miss the coloured old icons as wel :(
---
the first 2 pages of your zkill go back 2 years and you don't have a single kill in null on them
---
Aside from what others have said, which is all very helpful;
---
If you're like me and have a shit memory, I find it useful to write down your own little quick reference guide, or even just a URL hub/copy pasta compendium of relevant and useful information.
---
Start recording when you go out on solo-small gang, after you die (or go back home after getting a kill), cut it to the action bits. Review the footage. Try to understand what happened that was good, what happened that was bad.
---
Look at zkill and try to figure out why people take certain loadouts. Read up on ships so you understand what they get bonuses to, and weapons/common fittings to see what they provide and what their pros/cons are.
---
Try and find a mentor figure, if possible, or just some bored vets, and ask them questions. Help and solo PvP oriented channels might also be good for quick and dirty Q&amp;A.
---
&gt;3. When someone is interested in buying their super/fraudulent farm from, just kill them.
---
Glorious.
---
that's not the poiny
---
Obvious bait was obvious.
---
Kind of how misleading it is when people think that CCP is going to ban anyone in charge of a Corp with botters. They're talking about knowingly harboring botters.
---
Relax, if you're a CEO and you overlook one you're not getting the can.
---
However there have been reports of people condoning botting and even going as far as to tell alliance members to not report other other alliance members. That's not okay.
---
tbf i still prefer this approach, with all its flaws, compared to invasive client-side anti-cheat like vac, warden or battleeye. but i guess i'm biased.
---
Yikes test
---
Yep and it hurts them enough to think twice, and they move that money to another wallet, hit that one instead.
---
You do remember this is just a game right?
---
Are you saying we need some kind of Final Solution to the structure question?
---
Pro botters? nah man they are in a ecosystem without predators. Tranquility has the apex predator CCP\_Peligro, only the best will survive
---
Nuke from orbit, only way to be sure.
---
I just came back to the game. Having to go through each menu to setup what was at least the default in the past was.. annoying to put it lightly.
---
Yeah... thankfully I get to ignore most of the worst offenders now, but when I first started with my current company we were still getting enough traffic from some particularly shitty browsers that I was obligated to make it work. (Fuck you, Microsoft.)
---
Dscan/combat probe.
---
Still possible, which is less than I can say for that fucker Cortana
---
I guess I'm more just asking for better ways to root our botters within your organisation, if we're being asked not to harbor them we should be given tools to eliminate them.
---
I’ve advocated for corporation / alliance logos [and ship names] on the hull of the ship for years.
---
The only thing I [and a lot of others] advocated for that came into being was kill marks on the ship.
---
Wow, that was some wide-ranging grasping you made there!
---
First, larger organizations that have been named as the groups that house these rule-breakers already use the tools.  Smaller entities are probably less likely to be the subject of intense scrutiny.
---
Second, the game does give you a report of the taxes received from each entity.  If you notice that every day 75%+ of the incoming taxes all come from a small portion of the people you can easily ask them to be in comms or say hello and see if you get a response.  There's practical approaches that don't involve "pretty serious customer privacy and consumer protections violations".
---
 **Whats the best way to make isk in EvE Online?**  
---
There are a lot of different ways to make isk, with most being similar and in some respects even close to using the same system. It may seem silly to compare this to another site on the internet, but in fact that's exactly what it is – a way to make isk online – there are a few things to keep in mind that any player should always keep in mind.  
---
The best way to start making in to isk is to just log into the servers and just click on "Make Money for Free" and you should be all set up. We would recommend making some money on the side too, if it's a hobby there's plenty to be made. I had no trouble making about $700 worth of isk in one afternoon and, as everyone knows, no isk for free! The fact that there's a skill cap for isk is the easiest way to get started. This skill cap is designed to ensure that the most common builds are easy to pick up.

Shit my bad man i didnt realize those gangbang nullified totally not bots tengus were trying to pvp when i intered local when they insta warped to poses. Also I have done the angel epic arc multiple times during ustz I have literally never seen anything bigger than a hecate pvping. Bubbles yes. Mordus angel locals ignore each other while doing their single l4 mission lmao. Tell me how elite that is. Null space is boring and not fit at all for small or medium corps ( who would get more content in wh or ls lmao). The only pvp you get there are gate camping and station games, which are boring and stupid if thats all you get. You try to defend these empty as shit regions because of you are a krab wanting only the lp of them. Also those nronies in venal are only pvping when gatecamping with a blob or running the guristas burner missions with risk averse dramiels and kirins. Npc null is not accessible towards new corps because of the standings required and because its boring as shit to do the missions. You are full of shit and delusional if you think npc null is in a good place, because it isnt. (Personal experience serpentis prime, pure blind, venal and curse).

This has to be the peabrain comment of the month. Writing scripts to generate automated reports and find outliers is trivial for a game developer. Seriously it's something a summer intern could do. If CCP can't implement this, then I don't know what players are paying monthly subscription fees for.

No, your stance has been to barge in on a completely unrelated thread of conversation and start monstering.

&gt; Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) today announced a bill that would ban loot boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions in “games played by minors,” a broad label that the senator says will include both games designed for kids under 18 and games “whose developers knowingly allow minor players to engage in microtransactions.”
---
&gt;    
---
&gt; Hawley will introduce the bill, “The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act,” to the U.S. Senate soon. In press materials announcing the bill, Hawley’s team brought up the Activision game Candy Crush as an egregious example of pay-to-win microtransactions thanks to its $150 “Luscious Bundle” that comes with a whole bunch of goodies. This bill will also likely apply to a host of online games that feature loot boxes and other ways in which players can spend money for real benefits.
---
&gt; “When a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn’t be allowed to monetize addiction,” Hawley said in a press release. “And when kids play games designed for adults, they should be walled off from compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.”

&gt; Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission promised to investigate loot boxes following a letter from Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) that she wrote in the wake of 2017's string of games featuring the heavy usage of predatory microtransactions, such as Middle-earth: Shadow of War and Star Wars Battlefront II. Although some companies have pulled back on the practice, popular games like Overwatch, FIFA, and Apex Legends continue to make big money off randomized microtransactions. Many of those games are played by both adults and children.

&gt; Hawley, 39, has become known in Washington for criticizing major tech companies Facebook and Google, often accusing them of anti-conservative bias.
---
&gt; UPDATE (12:18pm): The Entertainment Software Association, the video game industry lobbyist group, sent over a statement shortly after this bill was introduced: “Numerous countries, including Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, determined that loot boxes do not constitute gambling. We look forward to sharing with the senator the tools and information the industry already provides that keeps the control of in-game spending in parents’ hands. Parents already have the ability to limit or prohibit in-game purchases with easy to use parental controls.”

Accessing the endpoint is enough to know:
---
Your physical address
---
Your IP address
---
Your browser version.
---
Also how many people clicked said link, and if done right, WHO exactly clicked it in game as well.
---
Sacrificing availibility of information for every new player for 800x600 compatibility? What year is this....
---
Are you huffing with all five accounts or just some of them? How would two accounts do?
---
Also can I grab a copy of that sheet? :D
---
Thanks man!
---
How are the Sanshas ships so good?
---
Only one way to learn!
---
Maybe not exactly a superstition, but there is always a cloaky proteus watching you in J-space.
---
It's fantastic, isn't it?
---
Yeah, this guy always seems to get shafted when a fight is around. But I'd like to draw your attention to the dates of the fights and numbers involved. I have literally never said no to a fight. Not once. What you see there, win or lose, is all the fights I've found in my AU timezone lifestyle. Which is why one of my campaign points is to boost random wormhole spawns to NullSec.
---
I even fought A Band Apart 1v6 and took 3 with me before I died.
---
Let's talk Eve issues. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the game and what needs to change or be retconned.
---
Not that big of a deal.
---
Took my less than 10 minutes to get the Neocom back the way I like across all five accounts.
---
Spodbrains park their rorq in infested space -&gt; they get a free serving of some world ark fists -&gt; spodbrain tears feed r/EVE for another day
---
Goon, opposing anti-botting measures :bigthink:
---
I am glad I missed out on mobile depots. I refit a ship once and died shortly after undock. Never refit again. Also, no whistling and NO BANANAS.
---
Yeah, Intel channels, Local, bad spawn rates. I also work 60-70 hours a week as a mechanic and take care of a terminally ill wife, so I play when I can man.
---
You're a Wormholer Brax, and I refuse to attack you politically. Now I'd love to 1v1 you sometime though. Always had respect for HK. I'm in Sinner's now with Lee Blackwood. Can't figure out how to change this antiquated Stryker flair on the app. Stryker fell apart because they refused to change with the times and work at it.
---
that one guy in the nullsec pipe system is on the out-gate with a drag bubble up
---
No it isn't. I've typed up part of my platform on the application, and the @DankEveMemes Facebook page. I'll be doing Live videos to discuss things further as tome goes on.
---
Ultimately my goal is to get a Wormholer on the Council, even if it isn't me.
---
Just started a new toon today, and can confirm that the "Neocom" is beyond FUBAR!       
---
Nothing makes sense, had to rebuild it all before I could even start on the career agents......
---
This is semi true. While the obvious appeal is the player made history, last I heard the NPC-focused RP community is alive and well, albeit starved of meaningful content. Sometimes things happen in the world of NPC corps.
---
Cool. Lets us all know when it’s complete.
---
It takes 2 hours to get the standings needed for L4s, not the game's fault people these days can't manage that setup.
---
Not necessarily the most bots. More like the most bots that got caught.
---
I do ALT + X / SHIFT + X to increase and decrease probe size, with X for probe scan, goes really quick and you don't need to move your hand.
---
I see your flair says Hates New Things. Honestly a large part of my ideas for the game is going back to the old ways and carnage before all the goddamn safety nets and training wheels and PC Gamer articles. Asset Safety, is fucking dumb, OP insurance is fucking dumb.
---
I want a true ground up new build for Bounty Hunting to make it a proper lifestyle anyone can engage 24/7.
---
I want LowSec safe from Super Blobs, because LowSec is now just pretty much dead instead of pirates roaming around and looting victims. Now, bam, oh there's a Ragnarok dropped on a battlecruiser. That's fun /s
---
Absolute lads.
---
Can I get your VNI fit? I want 50M VNI ticks.
---
I don't oppose anti-botting measures, i oppose the reddit retard brigade finding witches to burn.
---
These are not supported at any competent organization. And any organization that does support deprecated or antiquated browsers and device versions is pouring tons of man hours (development and testing) into backwards compatibility that would be better used developing modern features for their major user base. So, if a website looks like trash on an old browser on an old phone, hopefully that means the organization correctly values modern development over antiquated development practices and support.
---
you just wish it was you &lt;3
---
When the traffic starts getting low in the gate I camp, I start switching client color themes every 5-10 mins.
---
You were right, just jumped into one
---
I love sansha ships but I struggle to use them in null. Should I avoid using them outside nullsec? Or do you have any tips/fits for that?
---
Why not double that image? 2 static gang represent :muscle:
---
Corporate directors. Really needs to be at alliance level but there isn't anything at alliance level.
---
Oops, I meant per hour
---
Drop one nano to get dualrep? dunno.......
---
To be fair, if I was a Serpentis battleship commander in an anomaly with a VNI running it and killing all of your allies I probably would just shoot the drones?
---
Cheers Bill :)
---
There is still no item folders for your hangar
---
There is still no way to let overheat ON even after you deactivated a module
---
Joining a fleet is still a session change shit and fucks jumping gates
---
Still cant resize the system and route applet
---
Still cant sort local by standings
---
Wauw chill bro dont have to get all worked up and offending
---
Half of the people on this forum will dick ride CCP even if they shit in a bag and sold it to us for 49.95.  Large part of why EVE is in the shitter right now, so many people defending every terrible change like they have stock in the company.
---
:)
---
&gt;I don't know what players are paying monthly subscription fees for
---
Eve, the game. Also you file bug reports, literally helping do the bug hunting work already, so let's get a ladder so we can ease you down off that cross.
---
Agreed. I had to also add in peoples and places, contracts, and fleet back in as well.
---
Not sure if it was mentioned yet but a note on the two corporations you've chosen to mission for:
---
\-Caldari Navy offers level 5s which means it has a drastically nerfed loyalty point store. Basically if you are planning on doing level 4s you should do them for a different caldari corporation that has a better loyalty store. Use this tool to find a Caldari NPC Corp that offers a higher LP to Isk ratio. Put in the corporation you want to look at and sort by isk/lp [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/)
---
\-State Protectorate is the Caldari faction warfare corp. The missions it offers are special faction warfare missions that require totally different ships and tactics from regular level 4s. Faction Warfare missions pay great though.
---
I disagree with your assessment of the situation for reasons I have already stated. 
---
Out of curiosity, if you had the power, how would you fix NPC Null and what is your vision of it?
---
I'd trade all of the retards in charge of fucking with the UI for one member of the old community team TBH.  Nearly every change they've made in the last 5 years is terrible "PSHHHHH!" change that is less functional than the previous version.
---
Can't you just use launcher profiles for this now or am I missing something between /u/EmberNiagara's comment and yours...? For years I've been using the method you linked to transfer UI layouts, with the old client, but lately when I add a new account I just assign it to the profile that has the UI I want. Haven't gone into the cache folder in quite some time, and all my accounts consistently have the same UI among them... I think some things like color scheme get lost, but that's not a huge deal.
---
I'll break it down.
---
Multi Material Extrusion - You can choose color. I don't OWN many color, as it's 15-20 dollars a spool. (2.2 pounds of material I think per spool)
---
The color has to be programmed in the printing program, well, the 3D modeling program honestly. the printing program can understand color changes. 
---
I am paying the invoice on the kit today, which means I will recieve the kit in a week or so. I built a kit just like this last year, it took twelve hours over a three day weekend and I didn't use a chair. I eyeballed the measurements and it worked wonderfully.
---
So, assuming this time is going to be similar, I need a week to have it built, i need a few weeks to calibrate it (installing a glass top means I can see my reflection on the bottom of a flat print. A black piece will reflect the color of my hair when I am looking at it like a mirror. Although this is most always the "bottom" of the piece and will never be seen, it functions like a mirror.
---
Ok? So I need like 6 weeks from today. I only own uh like, 8 colors, most of them are transparent. Red Green Blue, Yellow Purple Orange, Black Grey Silver White (Glow in the Dark White). These caught my eye and I plan on purchasing normal people colors like dark green and blue and earthy colors and such. Solid not translucent, etc.
---
OK? So in this six weeks I'd need to learn more about modeling, unless you go to a 3d print website (free) and send me links of stuff you want printed (free) then I have to model it on my own, which is possible, but I love playing LID and I'm finally coming down off of my LID binge. It's been 6 weeks and I haven't played anything else.
---
So I'm not THAT full of shit, and it is definitely completely real and unstoppable, as I am about to be paying the invoice today (I've been putting it off for a week)
---
Basically it would cost you 20 dollars per KG because that's mat cost
---
(I'm not worried about electricity)
---
here is a run of the mill example for filament pricing, so unlike these other shitbags, I won't charge 10x (yes seriously) the price of the material.
---
https://www.amazon.com/HATCHBOX-3D-Filament-Dimensional-Accuracy/dp/B00J0ECR5I/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=filament&amp;qid=1557349298&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3
---
So yes. If you are okay with transparent, non-custom pieces from the internet (millions of options), then the soonest i could have it "out to you" would be like a month. I could send you free samples in like a week from today, but that would be printed on a machine that isn't calibrated. I slap it together, I'm only one person, ok.
---
So if you have any questions beyond this or if you want to send me links like this 
---
https://www.thingiverse.com/

---
There's too many god damn options. If you know anything about videogame modelling, it's the exact same program, I use blender to model my videogame files and my 3d print files, so ... if you find video game meshes, I can print those, too. No guarantees though, I tried to print a soul gem from morrowind and ended up with a mess.
---
I assert there is a stark difference between a NullBear and a NullBro. NullBros are bad asses. NullBears are a recent evolution of minimum effort players who run and hide at the first sign of trouble. No fight or flight discussion between neurons in their brains, they just run, and tether up until you go away.
---
Now let's take Test, or the Drone Lands Russians. They've never once turned down a fight when I'm in it with one of my bazillion alts. Those guys are NullBros, dating back to the great Empires of Eve and that bad ass Tortuga video that made me "Try Eve" back in February 2009. I have a lot of respect for active and intelligent players and NullBears have come along in the last several years in what can be seen as a pseudo- genetic drift because NullSec is now the safest area in the game. It's almost zero risk, between OP insurance on T1 hulls, to Asset Safety, Local, CCP turning a blind eye to Twitch color reader local bots... Etc etc. I want to see Eve be harder again. That's my platform.
---
Corps that large have external programs by default, they need them because CCP was woefully unprepared for corporate entities of that size.  The basis of your argument here is a unicorn
---
So you are saying EVE alliances/corp's should be responsible for building its own tools to track down individual that misbehave or get punished themselves? 
---
To me that sounds utterly ridiculous. Maybe we should force alliances/corpse to patrol its space, take screenshots and send them to CCP to help them battle boots. Every system should be patrolled at least 6 times a day (roughly 4 hour interval) and if not we should punish/break up the corp.
---
We should probably expand on this and make corporations and Alliances guilty of all player activities by association. If any player gets banned for anything the corporation he belongs to as well as the alliance needs to be severely punished.
---
You allowed Asset Safety to poison the game. Your opinion means jack shit Judge.
---
My only goal is for "a Wormholer" to be seated. Because honestly, I'm a pagan, if I went to Iceland I'd be howling at the Moon drunk off my ass, hailing the gods in a temple. Praise be to Odin.
---
Probably be best another wormholer gets elected, but until I see one that has a better chance than me I'm going to be loud as hell about this.
---
Thank you. By performing the Navy or the Protectorate missions does that mean I am fighting players or NPCs? One of my ships was destroyed just on the way *to* a Navy mission by the Federation while I was on autopilot. And are these missions considered "high-level"?
---
Using other RPG lingo for comparison, I can't seem to tell if I am a level 1 beginner charging into level 50 PVP difficulty zones expecting a level 5 PVE experience.
---
A lot of EVE wikis are vague on the differences in lore and game-play between the Navy, Protectorate, State Academy and the Megacorps' own security branches and so on.
---
Fuck is a truly versatile word. Really cleans you out when you're up set, MOTHER FUCKERRRRRR
---
It’s safe if he applies to the “new game ideas that never take off” department
---
&gt; Eve Trade Master
---
That link is fucked up also.
---
Hey thank you! Lets hope these new incursions have a note of danger!
---
Pretty much this. When I’m wandering through wicked creek or any other bot infested region where most pilots in local aren’t actually people I get complacent but I still can’t bring myself to warp straight to my out gate. The one time I do will be the time there’s someone waiting in a bubble. 
---
Lost too many T3Cs to silly shit.
---
Amen. I give you my solemn word, if one arises I will do everything in my narcissistic power to make sure they get elected. NullBears own all the seats and all they've done is shit on them.
---
Most likely they are docked in a citadel you don't have docking access to, thus, you don't see it on overview.
---
Still, to consider the unlikely scenario that someone is undocked and not cloaked and in 14AU range and not in a combat recon and not under a dscan inhibitor, use dscan frequently.
---
You're a Wormholer, I refuse to attack you politically. We need a Wormholer on the council. A loud one who isn't afraid to piss people off when they saying something stupid. So please, if you don't want me as the representative, help me find someone better. Because these NullBears running everything into the ground is no longer tolerable.
---
*kisses*
---
The defaults are pathetic. Zero considering was given to new players.
---
Already know of a number who are running who I'd prefer, don't you worry.
---
Praise Bob. But don't stop there. I want to hear your ideas and desired for the game too. Lay it on me. I'm accessible on Discord, Facebook, Eve Online Memes, and hell, I'll even give you my email address. traviswells86@gmail.com
---
What he said!^^^^ after you get caught by a handful of null sec gatecamps and learn how to survive those, going back to low sec where they can’t bubble fuck a gate makes those gate camps feel like high sec.
---
I've played Eve for over a decade, trust me, I'm numb to losing. As long as a Wormholer gets elected I consider myself win.
---
Since we are already raging about the overview, can we please bring the ship hangar and item hangar buttons back please?     
---
I'm tired of needing to press the shortcuts...      
---
I mean, its just a button. Wtf why was it deleted.
---
I haven't managed to do that with my accounts, maybe there's something I'm missing. But yeah I would assume the steps on the forums would be the only way to share it with people outside of your own accounts.
---
I'd like to hear your ideas for the game too bro. Lay it on me. Politicians are more effective when they get sandblasted by the will of the people.
---
[When Low Classers Run Out of Content Through Both Statics](https://i.imgur.com/munpvvM.png)
---
I promise to do everything in my power to give NullSec back to the NullBros, and make it harder so the NullBears will just fucking leave. When HighSec is more dangerous than Null, we have a culture problem.
---
You should see my memes, this is actually pretty tame lol
---
I'm at work. I'm here like 60-70 hours a week. So I have nearly unlimited time to Shitpost. It's kinda my thing.
---
+++ nice vid!
---
Check out the memes page on Facebook I run. I'll be posting a lot there as that's the core of my reputation thus far.
---
I want to hear your ideas for the game too, don't be shy.
---
I recently got my friends into the game, and I kept trying to direct them to things in the neocom. As far as I can tell, the new defaults don't have ANYTHING.
---
Are you that poor that you need to constantly monitor how much isk you have?
---
We always find something 5 min after someone leaves fleet for the night.
---
Silly, the only wallet CCP is interested in you finding easily is the one with your CC in it.
---
If you joined State Protectorate and tried to fly though Federation high security space, that would explain why you got destroyed "by the Federation."  By joining State Protectorate, you joined Faction Warfare, flagged yourself for PVP with enemy FW players (Gallente and Minmatar Militia), and flagged yourself to be attacked by NPC "Faction Police" in Gallente / Minmatar high security space.  
---
Stuff like this is why people are telling you to join up with a player corporation.  EVE isn't like other MMOs. You don't get "power leveled."  There is no "end game content."  Joining a player corporation doesn't mean you will skip or "miss out" on solo content.  All of the game is available all the time, whether you are in a corp or not.  Access to more advanced content is a matter of having the proper skills trained and the quality of the ships and fittings you fly with.    
---
Joining a player corporation will benefit you by giving you access to the knowledge and experience of the community that you will build.  As long as you aren't joining up with assholes, having more friends can only be a benefit to you.
---
Wait. Jackdaw requires omega, which makes the whole thing less profitable. I don't think they would use it. Am I right?
---
Black Rise! I stage a lot of my personal ships in Onnamon, which I can get shipped via public courier pretty quickly especially when posting the contracts in the "Haulers Channel" in game. From there, you're just a few jumps away from most of the active systems in Black Rise. Make a loop around and sit on some PLEX'es, someone will come and fight you soon enough.
---
Scanning. Lots and lots of scanning. Better get used to it, and get good at it. 
---
D-scan constantly. Have scanning probes on your d-scan preset.
---
High and low class doesn't really mean all that much honestly. The fleets are bigger, but plenty of larger corps live in C2's for the content. 
---
T3 cruisers are a good training objective. Loki &gt; Legion = Tengu &gt;&gt; Proteus (RIP the fucking dream)
---
Like everyone else said, go out and die and figure out what works and what doesn't that way. Also, ask people who kill you to give you tips, and ask people who die to you what you did right. Recording and playing back is great too, especially if you have a mentor or a friend look over your footage.
---
But, I believe you're looking for a solid foundation in theory so you can understand the fight better. I think one of the best ways to do that is to look at common ships and their fits on zkill, load them up in pyfa, and just get used to their stats and figure out how they fight. There are also great youtube videos like suitonias that cover some common ship fits.
---
That kind of encyclopedic knowledge isn't always helpful. Sometimes it will backfire as you come across a gimmick fit. But it will help you understand what ships are good at and even why those gimmick fits work, and it will give you a foundation to formulate a plan as you go into a fight--or tell you when you should probably disengage.
---
All I want is more risk,  less blobs,  and less f1 with more independent pilot thinking.  
---
(Keep the down votes coming pricks)
---
So I just started playing (I played for a bit years and years ago) and was pretty frustrated with some functions. One actually being the wallet not showing... but other stuff:
---
* Can't right-click ships and go to fittings
---
* Can't drag/re-organize tabs in Overview
---
* Active quest location not on the top left (but it's there when you start it in the base?)
---
Some stuff I'll let slide because "Eve shouldn't hold your hand", but a lot of this is just poor design.
---
Maybe not a proteus but a helios 💯 %
---
Or in a citadel the op can’t see
---
Love Eckheart's Ladder, and would love to see his channel feature more EVE content!
---
Sweet. I never heard about pressing v.
---
The difference is, I'm not scared of the helios.
---
"Just"
---
You keep using this word. You can't even report it from the in game mail. You have to open a ticket and decide which category it doesn't into and give a screenshot.
---
Coms will make you gay.
---
Disco ball cynos were awesome
---
And you've usually found content right as I log in, and have no quick way of getting to the fleet :3
---
Sigh, I don't understand why they're so in love with giving these ships shittier range bonuses than basically everything else in the game. What is this 7.5% nonsense? The AF still can't reach out to point range, so the range bonus might as well not exist, and the HAC is still barely better than the BC at probably several times the price.
---
I'm especially disappointed in the AF, considering how much I like that ship class. What does CCP have against the damavik hull? Did a damavik pilot steal one of the devs girlfriends or something? I mean, it's better than the damavik, sure, but it damn well *ought* to be given the likely price tag. And its total slot count is even more laughable now - in their inexplicable zeal to keep it with fewer slots than everything else, they even removed a utility high from a ship from *a race that one of their things is having utility highs* when transferring it to a ship class *one of whose things is having more utility highs than their counterparts!* Damavik: 9 slots, T1 frigates: 10 slots. Nergal, still 9 slots, AFs: *12 slots!* Ok, sure, it's got a full drone bay which usually removes a slot, but if you're not going to give it the full range bonus (which would still only add a whopping 1.9km to meson range and 0.6 km to occult range...) you can at least give the darn thing back its second utility high.
---
And I disagree with your disagreement. Like this guy said, Increase rewards, lower standings required and add plexes. Rewards and chance of not getting blobed or cyno baited would attract newbros and veterans alike for either pvp or isk.
---
You're totally right, but also just so you dont have to: once you get your settings looking right, you can make a copy of the relevant profile files and save them somewhere. If it happens again then just copy back.
---
Your UI layout, overview, drone groups, even ship default settings are stored there.
---
I use 7 accounts.
---
2 accounts would just be sucking up as much gas as you can in 20mins, same as 7 just less money for your time.
---
No :)
---
&gt; specifically sharing layouts with other players 
---
Yes, that is what I meant.
---
XookiZ is adding me to the PB ballot. And depending on that I'll likely shift my campaign to back one of them if they prove more popular. Wormholers need to unite behind one prominent figure to get a seat.
---
Not really a superstition, but whenever I get to seven killmarks on any particular ship, that ship surely dies in it's next battle.
---
If the only way to get elected is to lick NullBear ass, then I don't want elected. Now NullBros, I'll pander to them in a heartbeat. They're bad asses that have old Eve still running in their veins.
---
My point exactly, WHY IN BOB'S NAME DO I NEED TO DO THAT!? It's so easy to do what literrally every MMO does and store them online so whenever you loose your local settings they persist.
---
So alts for jump freighters. What skills should my alt have to be a useful contract go between for my freighter? Usual social and trade skills? Then I guess skill up to be able to web as well? Never had too firm a grasp on the contract alt type thing so seeing what people say. Working towards a JF but want to be fully in the know and ready when the time comes.
---
I want the Galaxy to burn in carmage and salty despair again. Old Eve was what's up. All these training wheels and safety nets need to fucking go.
---
Why would CCP have any interest in coercing paying customers to download a bot and get banned? That just loses them money.
---
And then your insurance expires, you decide not to renew it, and the ship dies three hours later.
---
Are you even on Praise Bob?
---
If you were a botter already using a program, and hadn't gotten banned yet; would you bother clicking a link to another program?
---
Or CCP could do their jobs instead of trying to farm it out to players under threat of punishment.
---
How sure are you? LMAO
---
I've played Eve for over a decade, I'm numb to losing. My only goal is to get "A Wormholer" elected. I'll back down in a heartbeat if a good one comes along I deem right.
---
yet
---
*How to modern? Is it edible?*
---
But if it's not on the neocom, you don't get to see it flash when it ticks.  That's like, the most exciting thing that happens in 2019 EVE.
---
nerf citadels, remove local, remove asset safety
---
What?  Really?
---
With the addition of glam boosters you can go from zero standings to +5 faction standings in an afternoon. If you want to run a faction without an epic arc you can also get a friend to share standings and use glam boosters to decline chain burners. The barrier to entry really is not that high.
---
I had zero problems with the previous one either.
---
Yupp :)
---
Oh no, you have to spend 5 minutes doing something other than contracting spod brain, what ever will you do
---
lol @ everyone eating this narrative up
---
~~Jared~~ Some New Spokesperson that's not a pedi: "*COME ON DOWN TO SUBWAY! Order your favorite sub! Then make it yourself with only half the ingredients!*"
---
But, there‘s a bar
---
Funny and somehow kinda proud how the wiki is STILL using my, now age old, video tutorial on it.
---
It's the little joys that matter.
---
A goal we can all get behind
---
I am over paranoid about two lowsec corps, and believe every time one of their members jumps in and does something stupid it must be bait.
---
But I know deep down it is more than likely someone being stupid and I am missing out on kills.
---
Second the settings change, I see this on a 4th gen i7 iGPU.
---
Could totally be dying, runs at a solid 100C with two clients, workin on replacing it with a Ryzen 2400G system with 16gb DDR3200.
---
Huge.
---
Thank you for your ideas could you explain how this would help newer players I feel like this could possibly be an interesting thing for more experienced players but make Eve significantly harder for newbros.
---
An apex predator that eliminates the prey at a rate of about 1000x slower than they can procreate.  Not a very effective predator.
---
Edgy, unlike yo piloting ayyy
---
Wow, you can use your MWD *after* you cloak? Awesome
---
there is a goon hiding in the bushes outside your house waiting to cut the power
---
Any test bot you find contact alliance diplos and he will be kicked immediately if you present sufficient evidence. Now gtfo
---
Are you going to have time to participate in CSM activities, with a rigorous schedule like that?
---
1. When I gate my revenant, Eve doesn't remember that I hit Jump instead of Warp To.
---
2. When I gate my Jump Freighter through low sec, Eve won't land me at zero on the gate and I'll be bumped off.
---
Hey you that's Neonazi propaganda we at Eve are decent individuals who don't support that sort of thing please refrain from furder unlawful actions.
---
thanks for your kind reply and best of luck with everything but i don't think you should be calling people "null bears" when you are simply an inexperienced player. its always a pet peeve of mine that wh ppl seem to think they are better than "null bears" when in reality they are generally worse.
---
yes local makes it difficult to hunt sometimes but everyone is on a level playing field with that mechanic.
---
also if you are that busy irl that you cant go and roam null once a month or something, maybe a csm campaign that has required meeting times etc isn't the smartest idea. you are trying to actively represent all wormholers here so u can see why people don't take it too well when you say you dont have time to play the game but want to be on the csm.
---
good luck w/everything
---
Saying it's useable at 1366x768 is a bit of a stretch too.
---
They did it because the wallet balance now shows as a tooltip for the character portrait.  Still not so great alongside hidden contracts, etc.
---
Why would CCP help the botters do? Unless the UI designers are that far away from BOB's grace that they don't realize most people don't multibox that heavily unless maybe they are geniuses and are using that as a botter detection factor in which case hats off.

With "planning and coordination" do you mean actually have an alarm clock set so you can even show up to the TZ tanking citadel or do you mean the coordination of getting 50-250 people into fleet and blobbing your enemy?
---
Even having the ability to copy your layout across multiple CLIENTS would be nice
---
Sadus here, Peligro hasn't had a history of bias against goons that I know of.
---
Holesale is probably recruiting
---
Unironically, given those two choices, what do you think most people will do? Some small fraction will go "I should report this" and right click and look for a report button. It's not there so they'll go "oh well, someone else will do it." So most of these will go unreported because most people won't spend 5 minutes to report a mail.
---
Why are all the cov-ops I see Helios?
---
Sometimes a Buzzard,  I’ve seen the Minim one a few times but 9/10 It’s a Buzzard or Helios.
---
Anyone knows if there is an up-to-date version of Korgan Nailos reference-sheet?
---
You feel that you have a better chance of winning the election than the other guy in your corp that is running?
---
Probably the first seeing as it only takes a handful of people to destroy 1/4 of the structures up.

I can’t find it - link?
---
In the time I've spend hunting bots, the quality they all have in common is that they ignore conversations. So what if we bring back the community team and charge them with **talking** to the community, specifically the ones who are ratting and mining? They would be known as Team Turing.
---
Have a priority conversation prompt appear in a modal dialog. It appears only when the client is receiving input so the claim of being AFK cannot be made. Dude doesn't accept, he gets forcibly logged out, a strike against him, and a higher priority next time. Dude accepts and he immediately regains control of his client but must take a Turing Test in the form of a conversation with the CCP GM. Dude gets too many strikes or fails the Turing Test, he gets a ban.
---
The fun is knowing the other side has to deal with it too.
---
If there are third party tools that make it trivial, then CCP has access to these tools ON TOP of GM tools that we don't have.  If what you say is true, then why the fuck hasn't CCP banned them all already?  If true, there's no excuse.
---
Oh yes. A loud mouth like me having a year long red phone line to CCP with ideas and public feedback to fuel me. I got this.
---
Now for the actual summits in Iceland, I will either have an alternate go in my place or remote in. My wife can't travel and I refuse to leave her. But I feel like this is more me getting ripped on a free trip while the community still benefits from my presence on the council.
---
If you've ever been on Facebook Eve Group where I'm a mod, you'll see like 24/7 I'm always talking to everyone about the game, even NullSec players, and trying to recruit anyone and everyone to wormhole space, and teaching them how to live here. Wormhole space is the last bastion of pure Eve. Everywhere else in the game has been fucked up and left to bleed. But I plan to address those areas too. 
---
HighSec - I want a true to life bounty Hunter system, which I have a long text typed up for. That will be spoken about in a live video soon.
---
LowSec - I want Supers blocked from hot dropping everyone so our favorite asshole culture of piracy can grow and thrive again. Currently LowBros are only able to really call Faction Warfare theirs.
---
NullSec - I want the safety nets gone. All of them. OP Insurance on T1 hulls, gone or nerfed. Communication Arrays and lagged local are already on CCPs road map. But I also want them to quit turning a blind eye to Twitch bots, Intel Channels Exploits. I want the Wormhole random spawn rate bumped back up again to what it used to be. Asset Safety is dumb as fuck and needs to die. FozzySov was a bad move, it just caters to minimal effort players. I think Shitadels need to work more like POSs with Strontium and automatic Gunnery. NullBros will be empowered while low effort weaklings and lazy fuckers get the shaft. Make NullSec Great Again.
---
Wormholes - Needs Cap escalations back, especially since the NSA nerf which I think was a great move. There needs to be incentive for using caps again. Hard Knocks got ass raped by exploits by the INIT fleet mass directing the doomsday to say more.
---
There's a short taste of my overall platform.
---
Procurers are always bait.
---
Yeah, for some ungodly reason. Right now, Mort is the number 1 candidate followed by Exooki himself, and I'm perfectly happy with those two.
---
and no pants on
---
Honestly I can't say. I've only just met Teddy, but he and any Wormholer that arises that will be a more vocal proponent for our needs will have my full support. I am absolutely ape shit crazy of wormhole space, and I want what's best for it.
---
The only benefit I'll have from being a CSM is the free account on my main Ezekiel Amann. I will not be able to travel for free to Iceland because I refuse to leave my sick wife here who cannot travel. I'll remote in or send a trusted compatriot in my place.
---
My reward is making wormhole space better, and also boosting other areas of the game so that it becomes a universe of darkness and salty carnage again like it used to be in it's glory days.
---
1) Ecming a nestor gang in a site. When we couldn’t kill them.
---
2) Seeing some russia roll into static, escalate a site my corpie was doing. Roll out. And killed my entire corpmates fleet.
---
3)  I’ve been living rent free in a LZHK farmhole and doing all their sites during the weekend.
---
Yeah, its called a solar panel
---
&gt; they need them because CCP was woefully unprepared for corporate entities of that size   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Then CCP is hilariously retarded and doesn't understand basic human nature or the effect of their changes that further push people together
---
They goddamn better be.  I want to see how much chaos dropping a trig dread into the capital meta does.
---
Long live our glorious leader Tuee' who really understands the hearts of the commoners that serve under him!
---
slot layout i guess
---
You not understanding how renters work reflects poorly on ccp too. Renter alliances charge a fixed amount of isk, they gain nothing from having bots in them. And seeing as probably 80% of nullsec regions are renter regions, bots will never have a problem finding renter alliances to join.
---
Yeah... I need a blue box about the size of a telephone booth. Need to make a call
---
I didn’t read of any of this. Just tell me what price that is not the original 300 pennies that you now want.
---
Just creates a target rich environment begging for more predators
---
On a more serious side, it would be cool if the invasions coming out did harvest the sun to the point where the system is completely dark?
---
I've went in covops to a few of what I presume we C1s. I'm always leery though cause I've heard of people getting stuck in WHs
---
Item folders are handled by containers.
---
does kinda sound like your blaming the first person available mate...kinda like screaming at the guy at the counter in mcdonalds cos they didnt have my szechuan sauce
---
When I started even with the old default set up I had no idea that there was a hidden menu lol
---
Yes well said. I do get to play like 10-15 hours a week. But it's in the AU timezone. Which is dead. If you look at my Killboard, That's literally every single fight I've found in those time frames. I've never said no to a single one. I even fought A Band Apart 1v6 and took 3 with me in a Stratios before they popped me. It's a video game, and losing is honestly fun to me. That fight gave me the precious shakes.
---
I do suggest looking into my other comments and especially my memes. I psychologically separate NullSec into two groups. NullBros, and NullBears. NullBros are those hardcore badasses of old who won't turn down a fight, I find a higher percentage of them in Test, Test always comes and fights in smaller stuff and has fun. Those are NullBros. NullBears however are the minimal effort weaklings who run and hide the second it's +1 local. They don't deserve to walk the hallowed ground where BoB once ruled. If that point of view costs me votes then so be it. Take away all the safety nets and exploits NullBears use to win wars and the NullBros will once again multiply and take the galaxy by the throat. But exploits like INIT tanking your Doomsday with shit ships by a mass trick is bullshit and I'll never say anything less.
---
How much?
---
give me a bucket and a long long rope.
---
Thanks for the heads up! But wow. Why the change? Because Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, and Rens were the "big four"; one for each race, right?
---
I wish you the best zek but Stryker didn't fall apart because they refused to change but rather because too many ppl were semi active.  
---
When inner hell came knocking, there was many hours of hauling massive amounts of shit to protect assets, putting in hours organizing any resistance, watching holes and timing Russians.  Lack of ppl giving a fuck wore down Stryker, not change.  I don't remember u giving a fuck.
---
You may have had RL issues and that's understandable, but having an opinion doesn't make you any more rdy to be a csm rep than any other asshole in jspace...and this is about more than memes.
---
PS: praise bob has many questions.
---
Best of luck as always and fly dangerously
---
Best answer is cause slot layout + drone &amp; tank. At cov 5 you can have all adaptive plating in the lows. 3 scanning upgrades and a scram.
---
I like the cheetah cause its the fastest cloaked ship.
---
all you people out here talking shit this man \^has the right damn ideas
---
*still clicks the hud icon to bring up dscan*
---
*sighs* why am i like this
---
Yeah me too. Exooki is a boss and knows his shit. If we can get him elected we will be doing well.
---
Mort, I've honestly only know him by name. And can't speak for his personality. But Xooki and I have worked together for years on the Eve Online Facebook group.
---
TBH trig ships are only powerful because of their weapon system.  They're pretty tame by themselves if you compare their performance against similar ships like faction amarr or even blood raider vessels.  Their main benefit comes from the tracking speed at the ranges you can pull with it, which is the same issue we've had historically with rapid light missile launchers.
---
Remember when you could search with two letters and a - ?
---
I can accept that
---
Look how pretty I made this UI by cutting off only half the functionality!
---
Do you remember when neocom icons were actually different and you could tell them apart?
---
It's obvious for most of eve to know whose a bot.
---
Does your friend live in Florida? That sounds like something Floridaman would say.
---
A launcher update/download and restart has done it every other day the last few days, if not everyday.
---
Probably the same UI person who thinks the launcher doesn't need a horizontal scroll bar for the news items.
---
This
---
That's some troll level changes right there and fucking dumb as shit.
---
I actually had rhe opposite, bought an a-type adaptive for 67000 isk, insane
---
While c2/Hs-c3 are good most of them of populated so I’d recommend a c2/C2-LS to start with :)
---
It's all bait in a way, if you are in lowsec.
---
I stand corrected, thank you for highlighting the issue :)
---
I'm gay.
---
Oh god, i still have TEST memes!
---
Personally, I'm always even more vigilant / paranoid when working with the  ISK of others.
---
A friend trusted me with several hundred billion while he's AFK for a while.
---
So  I watch the wallet very closely.
---
Watching your wallet is not just for the poor.  Anyone with stuff on the market or contracts watches their wallet closely.
---
'Splain please, Lucy
---
Helios is the ugliest ship in the game, i prefer the anathema!
---
Nice graph, upvoted
---
Iirc you have about 0.5s to do so
---
Good advice, thanks for that :)
---
That's actually a really, really good idea. Thank you
---
Thanks
---
Nope, no one has ever mentioned Dyson Sphere's in EVE...
---
Thats not a superstition, that's a measurable truth!
---
Thanks.
---
Well it’s a fact that he and his command structure withheld AT payments from most of Triumvirate AT team, made sure he got what he wanted, and then bailed.
---
Good advice thanks.
---
11 dollars a pound. It doesn't have to be anywhere NEAR solid, so things can be big, cheap, and durable. Like, "jump up and down on a pikachu the size of my thumb and have no damage" durable. (Shell thickness)
---
Big like, a human heart the size of my fist would cost like 30 cents, and would weigh maybe 11 grams.
---
Good advice, thankyou.
---
That does sound fun
---
Then if thats the case him not trying to help payout those other pilots in some other way speak volumes.  My guess he doesnt care.
---
The new side UI is fucking worthless. But does ccp care? Of course not
---
You can use it in lowsec too, tanky enough against gate guns, and fun to warp to cynos and pop them
---
Yep. I go out a lot, I just don't feel confident enough with a 60% or so KB to go running around in deadspaced frigs yet.
---
Our guys put in what they could Khermes being the lead from my corp.  He rushed home from work to make sure he was at AT practice.  He put all his effort towards the AT for Anveri and co to screw him and others on the team.
---
This would be fantastic integrated into SEAT.  From some things you've mentioned about laravel i'd wager a guess at it almost dropping straight in.
---
Please?
---
On a dst? Cloak trick?
---
Honestly who cares. Just add the damn wallet. Done.
---
That's also a very good starter wormhome.
---
Or you'll get Brisc Rubal'd, with no investigation or recourse since you're just a pleb.
---
So, there's about... six that have arisen, so far. Do everything in your narcissistic power to make sure they get elected. Start by retracting.
---
Think so, yes.
---
Reality you don't wait that long, but it isn't frame perfect for example.
---
Lol, salt.
---
Because it's tied for highest power grid which helps with fitting a mwd, it's got the mids for scanning upgrades/mwd/analyser/tackle, and the lows for istabs or nanos to help with speed
---
Thanks, felt pretty good making it after being on a hiatus.
---
V that was actually V pretty funny V praise bob V
---
I've never really cared about bot hunters. I only care about real hunters.
---
When you're space-rich, it's just numbers... 😉
---
I find it absolutely hilarious that CCP has failed SO BADLY at policing bots themselves, yet they somehow expect alliances to do the same thing, for free, without their tools that make it possible.  
---
Hell, even if you FIND bots in your alliance, you have to wait months for CCP to actually ban them.
---
Yeah its not hard at all, and if you blitz burners with friends you can do them in 2 kestrels with a bantam, and ofc do the interceptor L4s on your own.
---
Anyone can get Brisced with no investigation for any number of reasons, what's your point.
---
Winning eve is like being a former addict. It just takes a small spark to relapse

I mean, it only took a couple  dozen releases and like 5 years to make the launcher (which literally every current gaming company tends to have working from the getgo) actually functional.  Now with only +300% more ads!  Yay?
---
.    &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;
---
Burners give you nearly 20k LP per mission with CC4, plus the ISK from the mission, timeliness, and bounty pays for any +3 learning implant or frigate BPC cost in the LP store. 
---
Standings, as EmpireBuilderBTW stated can be grinded in an afternoon. There's plenty of guides for this so i wont comment further.
---
Why the hell would plexes be a good idea in NPC Null? What would they do? Static mission pockets? Or are you capturing nodes for LP like in FW?
---
&gt;chance of not getting blobed or cyno baited would attract newbros and veterans alike for either pvp or isk
---
That's literally anywhere (blobs) or almost anywhere (cyno bait) and not NPC Null specific.
---
Lasker, is there a T1 frig (not empire) with a fit under 12m that you'd recommend highly?
---
Not just do we not know, but there is a component to it that is random enough that CCP has told us it probably _can't_ be learned via regular testing. 
---
There is a minor effort to have it changed into something discoverable if only to let Mark726 finally get some rest, but honestly it far funnier to just tease him relentlessly about it.
---
I could very easily account for my 2 years under Stryker as their Personnel Director. But I have a pretty strict policy about bashing other wormholers.
---
Besides Wallace I was probably the only Director that actually gave a shit in the end. Ford refused to even participate in Directors chat and would ignore us completely but when it came to decision time he always seemed to get his way. The glorious display of Battlechickens against a Russian Mach fleet, Ford. I tried more times than I could count to breathe life into that Corp and get us rolling in our potential, and it sucked the life out of me. So I left them to what they so clearly desired which was mediocrity. I've got all the chat logs saved in an archive if you'd like proof to be posted publicly.
---
And then, even after utter disaster I receive word from members I'm still friends with that nothing changed.
---
In the end, Stryker called HK for help and became a joke among wormholers. I still try to facilitate the good people joining other corps.
---
I had already left Corp weeks prior when the Russians came knocking. I tried everything to get people ready and no one would respond. So I joined Lee, as a line member because I have no interest in leading a Corp anymore. I'll focus on memes, alcohol, and wormhole space in general.

I love how much of a fraud u/BP_EloKnight is, trying to pretend his overlord isn't literally the eve [RMT](https://imgur.com/a/oS5saQx) &amp; [botlord](https://imgur.com/a/U1GP3Qi) (screen caps). He knows too...
---
Fraternity (Noraus), haven been penalized 1.5tril last august for RMT/Botting. Learning from that experience takes it to a whole new level now involving money laundering, a rental scheme, and underlings directed to bot for him. CCP knows too.... Yet what do they do? They ban the bots, not the cancer directing it all. u/CCP_Peligro
---
Exactly what a nullbear would say.
---
I discovered Eve Online back in May 2014. Paid for a few months on a couple of accounts by selling Gecko drones from Steam's Starter Packs.
---
I even wrote a negative review on Steam. Quite an extensive one. It was in no way a mad rant about how bad Eve was. Just a negative conclusion from a lazy softcore player after playing for quite some time. A negative conclusion only because the things I didn't like slightly outweighed the things I did like. And learning skills took a hell of a lot of time. Everyone needs level 5 skills, right?
---
It is an attractive game, people. It enticed me to explore the final frontier. I came back a couple of days ago. The game has been massively improved since 2014. Talk about SP injectors! And the ability to share/save/upload ship fits! And I've also noticed the new Agency button to guide players. This one is particularly nice.
---
The old clones are gone! You no longer have to pay massive amounts of ISK to keep your skill points.
---
And now players can deploy structure in high-security space! It's good. Except the advertising spam using deployable structures and containers in some players like Jita and approaches to the system.
---
I think to improve the game even further, CCP needs to raise the awareness of new players about invasions, factional warfare (I still have to explore this one. Is it PVP or players vs NPCs after all?). Newbros need more pointers what they can do in this game. PVE wise.
---
There is a lot of solo players on Earth. A huge market.  Banding into a corporation seems too daring for some. I'd say trying this game as solo should come first. Otherwise, it's like joining an army or something if you join a corporation.
---
It's not what Eve Online is all about now. But it can be part of the game. Not the core.
---
You, a goon, member of an alliance who gave Delve the reputation of being fucking cancer to go anywhere near if you happen to give a shit about actual PVP, are unironically coming to bothunting posts to talk about people wanting to hunt things that don't shoot back. The difference between instantly bosoning subcap PVPers using the biggest umbrella in the game and killing bots is that the latter actually benefits the game. Guess you must really hate your alliancemates if you only care about real hunters
---
CCP do not play their own game, water is wet
---
Did you just have a stroke?  Are you okay?
---
The point is the players shouldn't HAVE to do this - CCP can do this shit with a DB query WAY quicker than we can by trawling the API
---
Don't spell out numbers like that. It's insensitive to dyslexics.
---
Also, bubblehorns are beautiful creatures and I demand you show them respect.
---
Don't make me break or the Twitter app on you!
---
NGL, I basically just play because i'm addicted and no other game gives me the same rush
---
That's not a secret.
---
Low end pve requires that you and your friends are willing to learn some mechanics vs just getting into a VNI and being bored.  Things such as high sec combat anoms for faction spawns and escalations, low sec clone solider hunting in destroyers,  C1/C2 wh diving in frigs/cruisers. These activities aren't going to yield you billions of Isk. Rather it will keep you engaged and the knowledge learned will pay off in the long term.
---
Figuring out what fit works for you and your friends is the "fun" part.  Bounce ideas off each other and learn by trial and error. Have fun collectively solving the puzzle.
---
You're telling me.  I'm able to start playing again here soon but gonna have to start from scratch on my set up again.  At least I sent myself an overview link,  so that's a plus
---
SHAME
---
Wormhole living is the only way to play in Eve Online because nobody is smart enough to know what the hole is.
---
That's not to say that you don't need to be smart because just because one hole is bigger than another one doesn't mean that it means that all holes are better. You can choose a bigger hole because it fits one strategy better than another so you can have bigger holes. That also means that bigger holes don't always translate into higher income opportunities.
---
The trick is to stay humble. I can't speak for yours, but it was a long time ago that we got our first wormhole and I do remember having to look my house in the eye and say "we do not have this kind of hole." My wife doesn't see her home as being a wormhole but as a lovely piece of property that will help me get more home owned and sold items. She is not going to feel like I am buying something "too big" at a time when it
---
There is a video of someone running T3 electrical filaments with dual rep beam punishers.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92V\_JON1y\_s&amp;t=135s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92V_JON1y_s&amp;t=135s)  That said, I doubt those people are alpha accounts, but alpha frigates are generally closeish to omega skilled pilots.
---
I think you can run T2, maybe T3 dark sites in mwd kiting kestrels, although I haven't got my brothers to log on consistently enough to try that out. haha. The main issue is the swarmers, anything else you can just kite away from. But it seemed like if you can get up to near full speed the drone damage in mitigated somewhat. after the last site I swapped the shield resist rigs for agility rigs to make going faster easier while not flying in a straight line out of the arena.
---
I also fit up some remote-repping AB cruors for eletrical sites...mostly for fun, we haven't tried those out yet, so they might just die in a fire. :)
---
I always have it in the drone bay, haven’t sicd it on anything yet.
---
It's the first day of my Campaign. Asking me to bow out now is just a public display of insecurity on your part bro. Think a little harder next time.
---
ESI checking sites give you a shit load of player data. Was a recruiter once, had a couple of lazy spies try to get in with massive red flags in their wallet history.
---
It's not hard to find them m8
---
I don't see a problem here
---
Implying user flairs are accurate for starters...
---
Listing your total sp tells us nothing about what you can actually do.
---
I hear a potato works. Also, why 6 monitors? I've found using something like EVE-O Preview or ISboxer a significantly easier method do multi-boxing then having a dedicated monitor for every client. The amount of distance you mouse needs to travel for something like that is insane.
---
Aren't all Russians supposed to be in FiRe coalition, suffering heavy losses to Fraternity?
---
Were the incursus's blaster fit? If so, that's probaly the issue, running abyssal frigates sites is mostly about damage mitigation, and going in close to apply blasters vs high tracking cruisers is going to be bad for frigates. Something to watch out for is the multi-body tracking pylons since they buff the cruiser tracking enough to be able to apply well to frigates (at least that is my experience running T3 electrical's solo in a retribution)
---
More than I've seen in local lol. Too many goons role-playing their pets - Unspoken.

They still rent the space to them. Your point is idiotic.

Also make sure to check out /r/evejobs. It's the corp-finding subreddit.
---
If you're the leader of a team you're responsible for them. Again CCP isn't saying you're getting in trouble for having bots in your Corp, they're saying if people continue to turn a blind eye to it there will be punishments. If you're not knowingly turning a blind eye to it you'll be fine so you don't have anything to worry about. Or do you?

Ok cool. Wormhole survival in 500 words or less, let's go!

In known space, systems are connected by stargates. In wormhole space (w-space), each system is guaranteed to have either 1 or 2 "static" connections. They're called static because they are always present, but they don't always go to the same system. Instead, they go to the same \*class\* of system. That's Highsec, Lowsec, Nullsec, or one of the 6+\* different classes of wormholes (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and then a couple special cases we're going to ignore). You can look up the class of your current system, as well as its static(s), on [anoik.is](https://anoik.is). Eventually, you'll want to speed things up by using a "mapper" like Tripwire ([https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/](https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/)).
---
A wormhole's type (use show info) tells you what kind of wormhole it goes to. For example, a B274 goes to Highsec. A "k162" is an \*incoming\* wormhole. You can use show info to get a general sense of where it comes from, with "unknown space"==C1, C2, or C3 and "dangerous unknown space"==C4 or C5. Most wormholes you'll encounter are the static of one system or the other, but there are also some "wandering" wormholes like the C140 that goes from some C5 system to some lowsec system. A C5 wormhole will \*always\* have its static. It will \*sometimes\* also have a C140. And then it may also have other incoming wormholes connected to it.
---
Every wormhole has a time limit and a mass limit. If either is reached, the wormhole collapses and a new one is spawned. Note that for wandering wormholes, a new one might spawn in a totally different system. And if I collapse an incoming wormhole from System J111111, System J111111 gets a new wormhole but it's highly unlikely to go to my system again. Using show info, I can see if a wormhole is "end of life" (&lt;4 hours time remaining), "reduced" (&lt;1/2 its total mass remaining), "verge of collapse" (&lt;1/10 its total mass remaining). Most wormholes last 16 or 24 hours from spawn to collapse. Wormhole mass limits vary more, but in general you can throw 4-12 battleships worth of mass through and back again. Some wormholes will only allow cruiser or "frigate" (and destroyer) sized ships through, and only the largest wormholes will allow capitals through. No wormholes allow supercaps.
---
To wander through wormhole space, as long as you have a core probe launcher and probes, you'll be fine. It's advisable to have a cloak as well, either fit or in your cargo hold with a mobile depot for refitting. Since every wormhole has at least its static, there will always be something new to probe that will hopefully lead you toward known space. (There are a couple exceptions, but those have to do with battleships and capitals and aren't going to be relevant for a newbie.)
---
To wander successfully, know where you're trying to go and use your knowledge of statics to scan the systems that are likeliest to either have what you want or lead you toward what you want. Make safe bookmarks that aren't in-line between celestials. Be cloaked or moving whenever you're scanning. Get used to using your d-scan, since that's your only warning when the neighbors come calling with Sabres and T3Cs.
---
\*ALWAYS\* bookmark the far side of the wormhole after you jump through. (Do this before you break jump cloak.)
---
556. Hopefully that's useful for you, and not too much info all at once!
---
All of the systems came up as the players congregated there because of PVE, they are very well connected mission hubs. There's nothing CCP did to make them trade hubs. Since Jita is by far the biggest market, players started concentrating there and more and more and left the other trade hubs. There are also fewer players in general, so it makes sense to concentrate your business in an area where everybody is.
---
Ads which nobody cares about anyway after launching all characters and basically closing the launcher
---
Because they can't come onto Reddit and brag about their 2k budget and their 6 monitor setup, if they ran it all from a single multiwindow monitor.
---
It's all about the epeen, man! =)
---
I, a goon, dont boson people on gates with my titan. Yet you, a whatever, blame me for the action of my allies. When all I said in the first place was I think it silly to hunt something that is incapable of you back. 
---
Why you are focused on my alliance is mind boggling considering I didnt even bring them up in the first place.
---
Lives in wormholes, complains about asset safety which doesn't exist in wormholes.
---
Same goes for mails.
---
It is about that to, but the bragging rights are more towards people I know in life, not in eve. Nobody cares about 6 monitors in eve
---
Use a worm run t1 frig solo
---
I was in the exact same situation as you, i developed a punisher fit that is extremely cheap(5-6 mil) and works well for t1 electricals. It can solo every room on those except the 3 striking damavik room. Btw, for any fit before buying like 15 of them id advise going onto sisi and trying out the fits. I know filaments arent seeded there but you can get them pretty quickly doing t3's in ultrabling fits since t3 filament crates and bling modules are seeded there. Anyways, heres the fit(i designed it myself, seems to work good but may be crap idk)

How are you supposed to fight the sleeper Watchmen? They seem to use missiles or something, but they hit out to about 30KM, and even if you get close to them, they still apply damage really well and tank pretty hard. They are easy when in a cruiser, but they hurt a lot in my budget fit retribution.
---
I never used to have much issue engaging Hookbills. This looks like an interesting fit though. I'm never a fan of AB fits though I can see how it works well.
---
I never insure my abyss ships
---
Quit eve is the only way to win
---
Yeah, those are probably the hardest thing. I have a pretty blingy fit, A-type everything and dark blood heatsinks. Usually I go in close, kill one with multi frequency while overheating the rep, using the assault damage control if needed, then just pull range, rep up, and repeat. it's a bit painful. If there are drifters with them I'll snip them out with aurora usually.
---
Lots of people care. I run six accounts, 6x3 = manually adding it 18 times. 
---
But I don't care about that as much as hiw it negatively impacts the new player experience. Wallet, mails, ship tree - these are all things that should be on the neocom by default.
---
The only way to win the game is to stop playing
---
well said.
---
Just a reminder that the PB rental policy was done to screw over the alliances they were currently renting from, i.e. to deny them that rental income.  So it's pretty funny that Goons are now getting the heat for this, when these guys have been happily botting away elsewhere in other people's space for years.
---
Along for a friend of course
---
Alpha skills are way too limited to be worth botting shit
---
Come join WAFFLES. Small gang is alive and well.
---
maxed out scanner hacking skills...flies helios...tells me enough what he does and likes to do...i know its strange that its not 14 mil in mining skills but i tell you a little secret. NOT EVERYONE ENJOYS MINING!!! 
---
lol srr could not resist. o7
---
As a new player it took me weeks to find the fleet info.
---
A downside to Test is in Esoteria you will have a lot of competition for relic sites.  A positive is easy access to Stain as well, along with period basis
---
This and more this.
---
Non ironic irony posting to feign the facts that u guys got spitroasted
---
I'm not convinced it wasn't a mistake. Like they uploaded the wrong UI package. There's just no way this was done with sane people thinking "yeah that's ok."
---
the struggle is real ×D
---
Strict policy about bashing other wormholes. - goes right in for the throat.  Shits freely over previous corps. Threatens logs. A+ CSM candidate.
---
I didn't fly much with u. I took my break before you joined and came back when clearly u we're leaving/ alrdy gone.  I'm not impressed. Back to memes and shitposting for you.  Playing the game is a requirement for CSM.
---
Btw, I see sinners fighting in the au tz all the time.  That's a lame excuse.
---
Since X-Files left I've had a ton of luck, honestly.
---
Oh yeah, I'm low class!
---
I'm doing calms myself to get used to using non-missile fit frigates, i'm new to using assault frigates and especially ones using guns. The hardest rooms I have faced in calms with this fit are a single lancer and a single watchmen together, the lancer does not do much, but the watchmen does easily applied damage, i'm guess they can't hit out to infinity, so maybe just kiting them with Aurora is a better idea (my skills are still bad so I can't hit out past 50KM). I'm really not sure how the Lvl.5 Running Retributions do these sorts of rooms, especially considering past lvl.2 sites the amount of enemies on average per room nearly double.
---
Why do people have to bring up a negative in a discussion about something someone liked. Just let someone like one thing ffs there are like 4 threads a week about the search changes we're good man
---
When you will finally have moved all you need moving into your wormhole via an ok connection 4 system down your wormhole chain which is at least 10-15 jumps from a trade hub, you will finally get a direct HS within 5 jumps from Jita.
---
Dont be sorry. I appreiciate it
---
Succubus is really not amazing in null without genos/snakes. You really want to hit the magical 2.7km/s cold to be able to run camps effectively.
---
Not surprised. Garst (and Warren when he was in leadership) basically plundered Tried every chance they got. Anveri was just following the example set for him
---
especially during early eu, late AU timezones there would be less explorers.
---
Seems like job for CCP. Since they have the data, the employees and the power. And since we pay them, and they are not paying us.
---
Because of the AB and tracking bonus, high damage and great gtfo ability.
---
I pick up daily, it doesn't overflow the pad storage
---
There's no other player structures anywhere on the planet
---
Exactly, because we are good at the game and know how to manage our assets. Unlike you betraying your comrades for a quick paycheck
---
I usually do it from orbit while I'm picking up from the customs depot, so that shouldn't be an issue
---
As a matter of fact he... Doesn't... But I appreciate the meme reference 😁
---
Why is 2.7km/s magical?
---
That would be very interesting. I just like the idea. Cuz the artwork for the sun's is stunning and doesn't get enough love.
---
Wow... Really? Did I hurt someone's feelings? Here's a sandwich.
---
Valiant attempt, but will anyone catch it?
---
&gt; Fuck you, Microsoft.
---
As someone having done support for old IEs, I totally second that.
---
Stratios i guess. Honestly being an alpha will hamper you a little, as you can get a t3c, which is prolly the best ship for it
---
It was a well known stereotype at the time. Now the stereotype proves to be very possible with the influx of Chinese players and massive increase in reported bot accounts. Not racist at all.
---
And I love *you* random citizen!
---
Don't matter if the client you're doing it for asked for IE support. You're going to doing it, whether that's stupidly wasteful or not.
---
Not sure about the memes but the piloting was good so I'll allow it. 
---
Also you're not fooling anyone hiding your cursor you filthy module clicker.
---
My favorite part of masturbating is my finger rubbing my clit when I'm done. It's nice knowing that you are there with me so that I can get my finger off and masturbate before getting to cum with you. But sometimes I think it'd be better to have you as the climaxer. I mean, if you were my best friend and I'm the guy you like, I might not want to be the guy you fuck, but I can still love it.    
---
You and your mother were in the hospital after surgery last summer.    
---
I'm glad you don't want to see my face today. I was just crying. I went to the hospital with them, and when they came back I found them all kind of sad and sorry. You're just going to be surprised how different they are.    
---
They were just the two of you after all. I didn't have to do much, but you had to do quite the amount; there was a doctor that had to come to our apartment and take my dick.
---
The free market has a return policy... that’s what would happen IRL. 
---
I can see the rage building... how would this happen in game? A 5-10 delay in the funds transfer... how soon to people notice they wildly overpaid? Immediately.
---
Let's you outrun sabres or at least crash gate before anything spooky can lock you and do damage.
---
Lmfao
---
[Well, FYI you can do that automatically.](https://github.com/Bertral/EANM)
---
Happy cake day :)
---
Oh cool, thanks for the heads up - it's nice to see something's already been made
---
God damn it, I have so much to learn about this game. I don't even know what the fuck a directional scanner is.
