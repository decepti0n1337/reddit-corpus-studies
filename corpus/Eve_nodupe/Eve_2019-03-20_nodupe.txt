I'm not sure how big nerfing VNI will affect the game, I do some blops/solo cap pvp and trust me, everyone is in bloody VNI beside Delve...
---
noone complains about the fighter controls, It was one of the best changes eve made in a LONG time. Being able to navigate your drones around is amazing.
---

---
i've had 8 accounts, 7 that pay for themselves by extracting.  I'm basically the problem.  It isn't the rorq guy who is actually playing the game, it is my passive accounts that suck up plex and don't actual fly anything.  
---
What about that suggests anything other than they're leaving? It is just as likely they offered to sell to GSF as they were forced to.
---
Jesus nobody would ever invade a home system if this was a thing.
---
Gay Sex?
---
Hey big smart brain man.
---
In order for a bot to do that on multiple accounts, relock every wave, tell fighters to shoot, to orbit next spot, to issue commands, is a lot of information.
---
Now multiply that by 5 accounts, that is very hard. Why do you think botting supers are normally just 1 account, where as botting VNI's are 10-20?
---
Rorqs are still an issue, and tbh your not really part of the problem. There are people in this game with 250 skill farms, and 50 rorq alts. Those are both an issue.
---
Your confusing retired vs discontinued. There are skins that are retired such as the memorial skins, that have public statements from ccp that they will never be reintroduced. Retired, for example implying to be set aside/memorialized like a baseball players number. It is set aside not to be resused/reindroduced, there is no binding legal statue that says they cant reintroduce a retired number on the team. But it would be unethical. 
---
if a player was to be let go, stop playing,  or otherwise not contuine to marketed or sold as a player his number would be discounted and possibly used by a new player. The team could retire a discounted number as a form of memorial if the player died after leaveing the team. Thus elevating it to another level above discounited. 
---
You and any ccp employe that states that discounited skins are retired are implying that they where "put out to pasture", "hung on the wall", " to be memorialized". In esscene trying to pump up the rarity with wording. This obviously incressed sales when new,skins where released and pepole bought them up becuse it was implied that they would be retired and therefore no longer available to be bought after they where removed from the store. Reindroduceing then for more profit is unethical if ccp has been implying or calling the skins retired.
---
Who gives a shit, re-release the quafe nyx skin! I need it mannnnnn

In this case, the insurance is the faucet. Not the mining. 
---
Inflation is a weird one in eve so to keep it simple I left it out, but yeah inflation is a factor. 
---
I'm afraid it's not quite that simple. Those two items do not always reflect each other's price directly proportionally.
---
lmao
---
I am sorry for your posting quality.
---
Guess I have a different definition of a faucet as a faucet just transports something to another place. I think of ratting and missions as isk printing (i.e. creating isk from nothing). My mistake. 
---
note that 388k is significantly more than an injector's worth (~900m isk) at over 50m SP
---
What’s up with this crop? 45b isk all with these...fits. 
---
*MAH SKINS*
---
wrong sub you fucking fuck
---
&gt;CCP's skin system isn't as predatory as other systems since they often have 'closed' economies, where you cannot sell items,
---
This is a big difference, and why I'd be ok with it. Especially if the loot boxes cost less than a normal skin. It's not gambling if you always win, even if you didn't get the prize you want. It's more akin to Magic or Pokemon cards.
---
What exactly is the problem with nullified interceptors now that combat ones had nullification removed?
---
If fleet inties are being used in the same way, just remove their ability to fit weapons (which is the optimal layout due to heat and fitting concerns anyway) or give them only like 1 turret/launcher hardpoint.
---
Removing interceptor nullification completely means scouts will catch less ships, and thus you have even fewer spontaneous fights.  This is the opposite of the direction the game needs to go, and it seems completely asinine to be focusing on it given the many other drastic gameplay and balance issues you guys rightfully brought up.

Why would I give it a hard pass with plex prices like this? I know a few people who spend hundreds of dollars on plex monthly, and I dont really know all that many people. I think your assumption is incorrect. There are players using real money to fund this hobby and enough of them that the OP is, from what I know of the market as a trader, correct in his analyses.
---
Hmm true, maybe im just blinded by my desire to kill caps playing station games...
---
Right!?

You seem to have a proper perspective on this (give or take).  What are your thoughts on the $-&gt;ISK ratio of PLEX vs RMT?

Unfortunately bots already exist that run relic sites in asteros. While your solution would raise the barrier of entry, it would not prevent botting completely.

You can neut from much further with a total fit cost of 800mil. Way into falloff. With over 50k ehp and fast enough to be nano style easily. I only lost one or two from a brain fart, my fault not the ships. And i flew them ALOT.

AFAIK the toons get banned, but then the owner injects new ones and starts over. This has happened at least 3 times. You can generally see a small correlation between rising 'enhanced ward console' prices and when he gets hit with another man wave. It's kind of ridiculous.
---
If that's true, it seems like a dumb idea from GSF. If they're offering to sell, they clearly don't want to live there anymore, and if they leave, goons are pretty much the only ones who would take the region. Seems dumb to pay for something if you could have had it for free. And the general attitude (on reddit at least) has been one of casual indifference. "We don't really need the region but I guess some extra income couldn't hurt, so we'll take it" has been the way people have talked about it, from what I've seen.
---
But really, I just said "got kicked out" because they left just as someone else moved in. It also wasn't really the main point of my comment, so it didn't seem like an important point to be correct about. I don't really know or care if they were forced out, but I will point out that if they approached GSF instead of the other way around, I would consider it about as voluntary as when you pay protection money to the mafia.

&gt; In order for a bot to do that on multiple accounts, relock every wave, tell fighters to shoot, to orbit next spot, to issue commands, is a lot of information.
---
how hard would you say that is compared to the video game itself?
---
&gt; Why do you think botting supers are normally just 1 account
---
definitely not true, and if the average carrier botter is only running a few accounts it probably has much more to do with the investment required and avoiding detection. running 6 at once would probably attract attention from CCP.
---
VNIs are disposable alpha accounts with cheap ships, run 20 at once and move to the next set when they get banned.
---
&gt;No, my point is that plex will rise as long as eve stays somewhat healthy. 
---
It seems to me it will keep going up the more unhealthy it is (given what we know of the reasons for it going up).
---
Depends on the scope. A major reason why botting is showing no signs of going away is due to inaccurate perspective. An example of this are all the 7 man corps in brothers of tangra. The thing is most of these corps are 1 guy who runs 7 bots, everyone knows this. However the thing is this dude has 3 corps in bot that are 7 accounts each, and hes running 3 different isk printing machines on 3 different towers with 3 different vpns. Banning 1 batch of those hurts this guy, but he has the income to instantly re inject 7 vni or gila accounts. In this example this will keep up demand for injectors and plex. However if we crush this guy entirely, ban his whole setup and ban his banker, which is a seperate issue, then he has no access to isk, and we made eve a little bit better. His only option is to find someone to borrow isk from, or start over from scratch. If no one loans to him and he has to start from scratch, itl take a while before he has the income to start buying injectors and reboot his bot rmt.
---
Whoa, harsh.

As has been pointed out - casual play schedules are not conducive to this. Also, I've been in goons since long before I had enough RL responsibilities to force my play stye change. I have more friends, RL family, RL friends etc. in the alliance than I can even count. If my choice is up and leaving or quitting Eve (Theoretically speaking) - I'd pick the latter.
---
I don't really care. I'd rather give my money direct to ccp and not encourage any mechanic based on rng.
---
Rng is a lazy design, used when people can't come up with proper ways of doing things.
---
&gt; I know what I'm doing is frowned upon, so I don't need anyone to tell me this.
---
You apparently do. Do not use this sub for RMT.
---
I think you overestimate the amount of isk there. Theres gonna be some exceptions of course.

He does it 2 or 3 times over the  course of a couple hours. As I said, it would have been even better in an armor ship since the blood NPCs only give armor reps. Still was great to watch. 
---
Theres a threshold in there somewhere, I am not sure what that number is. That being said, as long as demand is there, yes the game is over all healthy. Ideally I would love to see skill farms die off, thatl lower the price of plex  quite a bit, but the price will still trend upward, albeit at a slower and healthier rate.

He is saying that the problem nullification solves is better solved in other ways that bring more meaningful combat ships ongrid, while not removing all 'gate-camp' style game-play.
---
In modern eve, gate camps (choke point warefare) is more or less a waste of time.  
---
Remember this: anything that adds more tedium or requires more manpower/hours to complete a task you are nerfing real players and buffing bots. Bots have unlimited patience for menial grinding, unlimited manpower and manhours for grinding as well.

in the first month i started playing i got a magnate and tried out WH space. a stratios jumped me in a site and i was like “holy shit i want that ship” and then i finally did and got that sexy sexy blue skin for it.....amazing feeling
---
A Goon goes into the asset acquisition route for a couple of years just to get into a titan he'll never use unless there are 600 more behind him. He goes into 12 Rorquals just to inflate PLEX so others leave the game, deflate minerals causing capital proliferation. Then he comes to reddit and shit all the attempts to expose how cancerious his playstyle is. He RMT's the shit out of that money if he can. And then he eventually leaves the game out of boredom or getting banned.
---
As a whaler who's sick of how most whales are fenced in a single region under hisec level safety, I move into this region pissing against the wind. I develop a brand new way of stealing stuff and do it to Goons for almost a year, making space 1% less safe for Rorquals, just to dump all that money into suicide dreads, just so I can make space %3 less safe for ratting supers. In the whole process I feed 700+ pontifexes chasing those drones, creating content for the hunters, sell affordable excavators to people, buy their dreads off, kill their botters, keep their Rorquals on their toes.
---
Do tell me more about how we're on a par with risk aversion, and how I am the liability for the health of this game and not Goons.
---
God that would make using any PvP ship with a spare 25m3 of drones such a pain in the ass to fly. 
---
It's a fair point. That said, of the many other grindy things eve has to throw at you, and there are many, I still don't believe this would rank anywhere near the top (IF it achieved it's goal. If bots can already easily defeat these sites, then forget it).
---
sorry for any confusion.  so i kind of divide items into two categories on the market. the first being "mainstream" items like t2 mods that people use on ships a lot and generally cost less than say, 5m.  these usually sell quickly but since your item value is low there is a smaller amount of profit per sell.  the items i generally deal in cost between 30m-200m per sell but they sell much slower than mainstream items.  most people will automatically go for the mainstream items when they start trading because they know what they use and their friends use frequently.  this means there is more competition on the market driving costs/profits down and also that you have to update orders more frequently.  the more obscure items are overlooked by newer traders because those items are not something they would use frequently.  this keeps competition lower so less clicky modifications and since the values are higher and sells are slower the items are seen as more of an escrow isk hold even though there is a huge margin for the trader.  i use this to my advantage so that instead of having to sell say, 50 or 60 of a mainstream item to achieve a target profit i can do that with selling a single item.  does that make more sense?
---
If you can do it, a bot can do it too. It's only a question of the amount of effort to program the interaction in an undetectable manner.
---
The Sin is amazing - when you said triglavian black ops I was thinking that maybe the utility high-slots would transfer over to a black ops variant, allowing you to fit 2, maybe even 3 heavy neuts on a trig black ops.
---
I'd love to see more black ops variety, and I'd love to see ships like the panther and redeemer getting a bit more PG to allow for active tanks without compromising on the gun/neut selection too much. It's a complex issue and I wonder if it'll ever be addressed.
---
It's okay to dream :')
---
Goon csm members are the ones who advocated for capital nerfs what more do you retards want
---
We all make mistakes and interpret things slightly different, and that's perfectly fine.
---
    
---
The term 'isk faucet' in Eve relates to a direct injection of just ISK into the economy from 'nowhere'. That 'nowhere' is Insurance payouts (minus insurance cost, which is a sink), Rat bounties, Mission payouts, selling items to NPCs (overseer things you get from escelations and I think wormhole 'blue loot', not 100% sure there as it's been years since I was in a WH, as well as NPC trade goods). Pretty much it's an introduction of new isk into the game and not simply moving ISK from person to person.
---
ISK Sinks are where ISK leave the economy totally. These are buying insurance, BPO's bought from NPCs (the 365 day orders are NPC owned and items bought there remove the isk from the game, EVEN IF that skill book is sold again on the market), Skills bought from the character skill screen (new in the past month or so, pay 30% premium ontop of normal NPC price), industry fees at NPC stations, some taxes that don't go to corp/alliance coffers etc.
---
What is neither of these is general market transactions (Player A buys from Player B, isk changes hands, it's not created or deleted, it just changes ownership). Also loot obtained from ratting that is then sold is not a faucet as the isk paid for the item is in circulation already in someones account. Mining is not an ISK Faucet or sink either. That is introducing ore and then minerals into the game. That is considered a Mineral Faucet and the use of those minerals is a Mineral Sink (building items, destruction in transit, trashing it in hanger etc), same goes for convoy/hauler spawns with their 200,000m3 worth of minerals they usually drop each or whatever.
---
I hope this doesn't come across as being an asshole, just trying to point out whats what and a little rough education on the ins and outs of the Eve economies. It's not a perfect list or explanation as there are always exceptions and curve balls but it's the basics
---
Only time I had death threats in this game was market pvp. Is this what heroin is like?
---
2,000,000 plex are traded every day (~8 trillion isk)
---
It’s cute that you think you are a big deal, but you aren’t a fraction of a percentage of the reason for plex prices.  
---
Try zooming out and seeing 3.25 in feb 2018.
---
"Plex will ALWAYS go up as long as the game is somewhat healthy. Now that does not mean that there won't be short term dips, but plex will always trend up. Once plex starts trending down, you will know that eve is dying. Its a simple supply/demand curve. The demand for plex is high, and there is a faucet on getting the supply, so suppliers (the people that buy the plex with IRL money and sell it direct to my buy orders, gg I love you bros) will always try to get the highest possible price."
---
PLEX price rises have little to do with the health of of the game, you are only thinking about the real $ and not nominal ISK value of PLEX. We have probably had a over a 25% reduction in active players since the peak some years ago and yet PLEX has inexorably risen.
---
Most of the Eve economy is hard pegged to a fixed nominal ISK value [bounties, skillbook costs, LP rewards (which are soft pegged), etc]. You cannot isolate PLEX only in real terms. What has happened is that productive players (not just Rorqual multiboxers, mind you) have scaled their activities N number of times with alts and their high nominal incomes are raising PLEX demand while the unproductive (and new) players doing more basic fixed income activities are pretty much completely priced out from being able to PLEX and many who do get priced out uninstall instead of taking out a credit card. This is very bad for the game.
---
And I think it's important to add that many of these players have spent money on Eve, just not $200 a year which is pretty much the bare minimum basically if the player is never going to PLEX.
---
CCP needs to put a hard cap on Omega alts. It can even be quite generous, let's say 6 alts. It's the only solution to save Eve now.

Who said anything about *that* specialized? There are many capable whalers no more specialized in their line of work than Fuzzwork is specialized in industry, Sort/Aryth is specialized in empire building, or Suitonia is specialized in solo pvp.

Nice OC

You have obviously never had to rig (T1 or T2) a structure like a Tatara, Fortizar or Azbel. Once you have please, share your opinion. Rigging a Keepstar is painful, as is a Sotiyo trust me, I've done both. It's not fun at all.
---
Indeed, like captcha. At a certain point, there are diminishing returns.

Why not dscan range based on ship size?

I meant someone who hunts ratting supers and Rorquals, you know ships most of the aforementioned issues in my OP collapse into.
---
I'll be honest, I'm happy people know when they can and cannot offer insight to topics being discussed at the CSM. If I understand what your saying, is that due to you not knowing enough regarding mechanic XYZ, your simply letting those that do offer inputs and going from there, right? So you don't distract the point with something that may be obviously wrong, off base or what have you?

Nearly every wormhole corp is help up on the backs of the few members that find joy in autistically scanning.

'I come from WoW...purple is good right?!?!?'
---
If you're shipping to staging this is good advice. If you're staying in a hub then this advice will lose you money.
---
Too many manufacturers and competition to make money in doctrine fittings. When you do make a profit it's like 100isk. Also, the volumes required to make it worthwhile are enormous. Stick with meta/faction/headspace stuff. Stay away from ships too, take too long to sell
---
Your not the only one.........
---
Thank you for being a decent a human.  This makes perfect sense from the game standpoint. I guess in a general sense, I had a very different idea of the terms. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it. :)
---
You seem to be forgetting that gsf and red and co have been friends for a really long time. I can see why you might say that about someone like the culture in fountain, but it's a pretty silly idea to think gsf would ever move against PB in a hostile way.
---
As a rental region, PB is extremely good looking, so I don't know why gsf would ever say no to being the new landlord for it.
---
That's true but blops also gimped fitting compared to their t1 counterparts and t2 gun already destroys the  a lot of the fitting on trig ships. 
---
I think the panther is in a fine place even for active tank unless you want enough fitting to run 800 autocannons which I wouldn't complain but it's in a really solid place imo. We run active/buffer panthers we drop.
---
I don't it will get addressed considering how the play style has almost been killed but this patch gives me hopes we will see more targets out roaming around I got bored and went to wspace instead of deploying but hopefully soon I'll be blopsing again if the meta changes how we hope.
---
I dream of blops prices not being 2bil for the hull maybe one day.

No problem at all buddy. I may be an asshole most of the time but if I can assist with random shit I do my part :)

For PvE - Start with MJD to mitigate risk, and youu are more comfortable, just use your HJD to get around.

For PvP, use sub out one mid if part of a gang for a scram.

Might not be bots. When I notice an ambitious trader entering my market, I will do everything I can to convince them I'm a bot. Including spamming refresh to immediately top their order or creating multiple orders so at most the other guy has 1 second of exposure. Since you can't pod the other guy or kick him out of station, your only option is to frustrate him into quitting.
---
The heavy neut curse is nutty as fuck. Watching a destroyer/cruiser reconsider it's poor life choices when it goes full to zero on cap thinking the curse is an easy target is an experience.
---
Highly entertaining, sir.
---
guaranteed a profit like the box that costs 100 plex only has skins that were originally sold for more than that in the store
---
not necessarily that anyone wants to buy the Apoc Rata Sunset skin you randomly got for more than a few million isk
---
so there is absolutely a chance to lose if you get some junk skin for a ship you don't fly
---
If I scramble someone on a warp acceleration gate like in a DED Plex, can they jump through anyway?

How does warp scramble interact with the citadel or POS jump gates, too?

You mean having more people in your group makes you safer? You've blown my mind.
---
Hey thats rude :/ i was asking honest question here
---
If you look in this post [citadels ](https://www.eveonline.com/article/citadels-sieges-and-you-v2)  it will talk about it.
---
You answered you're own question weeb.  I mean shit, sorry.  Lol
---
Panfam have decided to toast some of  our sovs and the LazerHawks one and have ref two of our fortizars so far.   
---
They are maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddd....or bored. Hard to tell which feeling they are truly feeling there.  
---
But the demand will always be there to maintain the capacity to plex. It means nothing. To a large part of the playerbase the goal is to farm/bot to afford plex. This is basically the end of a healthy game if anything.
---
There's a time for rule 12. This isn't one of them, sadly.
---
botters don't run carriers because they are hard to skill into while you can put a new character into a VNI with little to no effort.  So when you get caught you can just dump and run with not much sunk cost.  
---
Programming a bot to run fighters is pretty easy, just a few more lines than running a drone boat.  
---
Aha. And im not a weeb, thats racism! U hamburger! 
---
Who knows anymore. Can't make anyone happy even when you're shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Btw i just coined new racist word for americanis. Feel good 
---
- Scram or point **can** prevent the use of a warp acceleration gate.  
---
- Scram or point **cannot** prevent the use of an Ansiblex jump gate, regular stargate, or wormhole.  
---
- Scram or point **can** prevent the use of a jump drive as long as the total number of points exceed the warp core strength (from warp core stabs or hull bonus)  
---
- When you aggress an Upwell Structure you get warp disrupted by the structure for 15s. The effect wears off while shooting but starts again when you reload and fire again, aggress with a drone, etc.
---
More stealthbombers please
---
That's particularly not true now, when trig ships are only a bit more expensive than a navy faction BS.
---
Cap stable Curse is beast!! #waifu
---
Is there a reason there is so few Stealth Bombers?
---
Yeah. You act as if this is normal but if n+1 catapults alliances into a spiral of exponential growth, by making space even safer, in turn giving the alliance the ability of building even more stuff, to recruit even more people, and to have even more growth, then that's nowhere an near interesting Eve and all smaller alliances should just disband anyway.
---
You can't be a CSM who cares about the health of this game and blatantly defend n+1. You are useless.
---
Because it was given to us by a....disgruntled....corp member of the group that originally owned it.
---
Over three times as expensive as the previously most expensive Nestor kill (https://zkillboard.com/kill/39585539/)
---
Thanks! OK so based off the chart, using my example with a Sotiyo, the chart states it has a very rough estimate of 60,000 DPS damage mitigation. Does this refer to damage cap? 
---
How do we get 108,000,000 HP on Sotiyo's in their chart? Their column kind of doesn't make sense. I am referring to this one: https://imgur.com/a/RxiSMTv

Every race has two covops frigates: one for exploration and one bomber. Just like every race has two interceptors: one nullified for scouting and one for combat. T2 ship classes are often paired this way. Have a look at the ship tree in-game. 
---
That's now. It didn't start that way.
---
Hey Brisc,  
---
WHer btw. Just wanted to say I might disagree with you on a lot of things (chain MJD changes can be dealt with after everything else, *hmmmmmmmmm*?)  
---
2 particular things stood out to me in the Summit minutes that I wanted to thank you for:  
---
&gt; BriscRubalsays that when Seagull was at the company there was a vision. After Seagull left there seems to be a lack of a general vision available to the public. He urges CCP to release some information on their long-termplansfor the future. This is especially important because any misstep or issue, followed by a communication vacuum leads to the players assuming the worst.   
---
and   
---
&gt; BriscRubaltakes the conversation back a bit and asks what is it that they want to achieve. He notesthat one thing players often desire is that Titans and Supers used to require a subcap screening fleet, and that many wish this gameplay would return.   
---
Thank you in particular for bringing these two points up. I know you're not the only CSM member with these concerns but I wanted to say not all WHers hate you blindly.  
---
Yes, every established player received a hefty net worth boost when skill trading was introduced.
---
Not appearing on dscan is one of the major advantages of a Curse.  In wormhole space noone even knows you're there unless they pull out combat scanners.  Use them often as "invisible" salvagers.  Only when they start seeing wrecks disappear off of dscan do they know you're there. 
---
Chori was busy rmting again, no isk to spare.
---
Sotiyos have a base shield hp of 18,000,000. An online service module will multiply that by 4x, getting you to 72,000,000. The damage limit is 75,000 per second, meaning it takes 960 seconds or 16 minutes to reinforce. However, it does have a 20% resist across the board. That means to actually hit 75,000 HP/s, you need to do 93750 paper dps.
---
(Wormholer btw)
---
Does the 4x multiplier apply to all structures, or just XL? Additionally, where did you get that figure? Not that I do not believe you.. I'm just curious cause I'm going mad searching.
---
An exploration Astero will never be properly fit though. It needs to sacrifice *at least* one mid.
---
HP values were changed since this dev blog as part of the update to have service modules do the low/high power thing and the faster reinforce when offline. [This blog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/upwell-2.0-structures-changes-coming-on-february-13th) details some of the changes but is annoying lacking nice charts and numbers and examples.
---
60000 DPS rolling damage cap times 30 min times 60 sec/min equals...  voila 108000000 damage...
---
Oh absolutely. I just meant that by the nature of demand and the popularity of ships you wouldn't even have to.
---
So based off this equation, every Upwell structure in Eve will have a layer stripped every 30 minutes if damage cap is met. No more, no less? 
---
can you tell by the pixels tho
---
I’ll be probing that.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
luckily the Hel with dromi's can lock that ceptor down .. with it going 10km/s and has faster lock time than an atron.
---
(2 sebo, 2 drone nav)...  times have changed.
---
You completely skipped over the fact that the ball is in your court. No longer should you be able to say, “all you kill is new players” or “you make new players leave the game” because CCP afforded you the ability to shield your new players from this in the form of a war immune corp.
---
For someone that doesn’t care about Highsec wars, you sure do have an opinion. ;)
---
I think you’re being a tad unrealistic when it comes to the spy thing. Have you ever tried hunting people in the way I speak of? You mentioned using wars to shoot at POS as a gamble for loot piniatas, and that’s cool. It’s just very different and entry level compared to the effort of hunting. 
---
Probing Uranus
---
It's hard to discern but they definitely are of slightly lower quality than what I'm used to.
---
All structures. The 4x multiplier is on the *service module* instead of on the structure, as the service module is what's making the change. I went mad looking for it as well and have asked for there to at least be text on the structure pointing you at the service module somehow, but nothing's come of that yet.
---
Does this make me gaypwnd? 
---
You may be shocked to find out that random reward structures are proven to be more effective for long term engagement and in fact a preferred feature by a lot of players.
---
I am not saying we should or shouldn't have loot boxes, but RNG is _not_ lazy design. 
---
Things that use RNG:
---
- Combat calculations
---
- Exploration results
---
- Exploration spawning
---
- Rare Spawns
---
- Officer mods
---
- Deadspace mods
---
- Invention
---
- Abyss (Fun PvE)
---
Not enough RNG:
---
- Predictable PvE content
---
- Resource Wars reward structure
---
Debatable, but mechanically effective RNG
---
- mutaplasmids
---
- Reward crates in Agency Events
---
A random interval reward structure allows for long term satisfying gameplay. Randomness introduced into skill-based events (like combat) allows for exciting moments and the opportunity for underdog situations. This is why all combat strongly leans on RNG for almost every aspect of its calculations. 
---
ok so besides this 30 day project i have also been a manufacturer since 2005 so any comments on that i can speak too very well.  as both a new trader and a veteran manufacturer your argument seems self defeating to me.  in both roles i am looking for the best profit potential.  as a manufacturer i would never build for buy orders unless there was huge profit in them and quite frankly, ive never seen a buy order with a manufacturing spread that was appealing to me.  everyone has their own play style and i can respect that but i equate what you are saying to cutting off your nose to spite your face...only in the process you are also spraying your blood on everyone around you.  
---
as for reaching out and making trade contacts...in the spirit of different play styles, this toon is a side project that grew out of curiosity.  making a big social/financial network isnt a part of the plan.  and would it make a difference to someone who plainly states they dont really care about their bottom line and prefer to just be able to keep head above water financially?  is that someone i really want to choose to partner with?  i'm not trying to be condescending but instead approach it from a business perspective.

[Your post in a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3y3QoFnqZc). There are bots for carriers and they are no more resource intensive than VNI bots. The reason you don't see as many of them as VNI's is pretty simple: VNI's can be easily done on an alpha using normal/alpha injectors. So the spool-up time for a character after it gets banned is very low, as well as the isk investment for the skills. A carrier? Neither of those things is true, and it can't be used on an Alpha.
---
So is there ever a chance we'll see T3 covops/ints?
---
You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. A little happy sunlight shining through there.
---
so this one is the most difficult to answer.  as an alpha my only advice is to open your trade skill window and train everything that is available.  i didnt look at alpha accounts as a viable trade toon because of the huge restrictions in the skill set.  someone else commented that they were alpha and making good profits at the start.   my concern with alpha traders is that i think eventually the restrictions will cap out your profit abilities in the later game.  if you are just getting started and wanting to experiment with trade then by all means give it a go and there is the ability to be successful apparently but i think you will quickly start to see the benefits of omega if your goal is trade long term.
---
FW i have not had much contact with in several years so i cant speak to that on a level im comfortable giving out advice with.  i do remember the fw market being very tier dependent with more profits when tiers maintained lower levels for sustained times.  if you are going to be manufacturing the mods from bpc's then a simple spreadsheet should be able to dictate your profits.  set an amount you think is reasonable per LP and use that to base your margins off of.
---
Trade skills are kind of dependent on how you want to play your game.  if you are doing a simple station flip like i am, it drops the skill queue quite a bit. for what i do this is my trade skill list:
---
Accounting  - lowers sales tax
---
Broker Relations - lowers order setup fees
---
Margin Trading - lowers mandatory escrow amount
---
Retail - raises active order limit
---
Trade - raises active order limit
---
those are what i consider the "core" trading skills.  If you are going to do regional trading you might want to train skills such as Visibility and Marketing that will allow you to work with orders from a distance to lower travel times.  my advice would be to open your Trade skills and go through them to figure out which ones will help you with how you plan on playing the game.  good luck and i would love to hear how your alpha trade experience goes.  :)
---
The lows on this fit are wrong. It's not instawarp but it could be with some istabs. I think you can do triple istab and a damage control for a smidge of tank (smartbombs).

-Faction war defensive complexing. last time i did this i was making 60m an hour in a 1m ship with a week old low skill account. offensive complexing can get to 100m an hour but it isnt as consistent.
---
- salvaging behind corp mates VNI or carriers. join a nullsec group, get a salvaging destroyer and ask your corp mates if anyone has sites you can salvage. #1 people are more likely to keep playing eve if they join a group. #2 you can make 100m an hour or more.

T3 Cruisers can already do covops and interdiction nullification. Just drop in the appropriate subsystem. I don't know what we'll see in the future.

What about making anomalies more like abyssal space, with small localized aoe environment effects and hostile e-war/logi ships that burn out of range? You need to analyze your surroundings in a 3D environment and find out the best way to move around and kill things. Increase the bounty payout 10 times for all the extra effort for real players.   
---
And I know bots can do that too, if bots can beat the pros at DOTA 2, they can do everything but not everyone is capable of designing an AI that advanced.

Don't cross the streams!
---
A couple of ppl have come to defense on the accounts that i suspect are bots and thats honorable so i can appreciate it.  When you start trading your whole job is to notice patterns.  Having a background in law enforcement was basically the same thing...ppls patterns.  there is no person that can keep up an exact pattern in hours/days long time frames.  by exact, i mean down to the second, every time, almost instantly.  this is maybe more apparent because of the items that i watch the closest have very low market movement.  there is literally no reason to constantly watch an order because the next person isnt going to modify for 4 or 5 hours.  you learn when different traders are going to be active and almost get a sense of when that person will be getting off work/wake up whatever is happening to give them time to play eve.  if that makes sense.  so...when orders get posted that consists of 2 single item orders that are spread out over multiple items that are worked in a way that is exact and consistent for days at a time with no "sleep pattern" then i have to say....if i quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck then its a duck...bot....not a real person.  i hope this clears things up for you a bit and explains why i included a bot rant.
---
Do you feel like the supply of PLEX decreases as the price increases? I.e. if I am a PLEX seller (buys it with RL $), I would expect to buy less PLEX as the price increases. Say I need 2 billion isk a month to play my way, so I buy a PLEX, but a few years ago I would have had to buy 2 PLEX, and longer ago than that I would have needed 6 PLEX. Do you think this is a factor in the upward climb of plex?
---
What do you mean get in trouble for? This is a perfectly reasonable tactic to employ. Happens in WH space all the time.
---
Depends on the system. Could be your fort is near the edge of the system and most sigs were in the middle of system - you warp from sun/center to fort you're gonna land near any ratter warping home. 45 seconds is plenty. If they knew you were carrier ratting (which is easy to figure out without ever going in local) then they could have logged a hunter there, though most people wouldn't keep a tengu logged for a carrier.
---
You won't tether with fighters out. You can still dock and you will abandon them. If you're scrammed, you won't dock or tether, so you should have just spammed dock and you would have been fine. 
---
If you panic pull fighters before warping and then warp they’ll land where you hit the grid (1000s of km off). Either pull before you warp or after you land. If you had just aligned and pulled, waited for them to return, and warped out, you would still be alive, since fighters being out, not your PVE timer is what stopped you from tethering.

You have to ask...?
---
i absolutely agree with what you are saying.  i was a little hesitant about moving into the market that i did with the more expensive slower moving product but in the end, for me it was the right move.  there were also some mainstream items that i did get involved in.  i bought one mod for 600k and resold consistently at 5-6m.  i had other similar orders that i worked with.  it kept some daily profits flowing between sells on the other items.  now, i seldom sat on an item for more than 3 or 4 days so the turnover was good for me.  i looked at market history movement before i invested in buy orders.  i didnt take anything that had crazy long fill times even if the margin was as high as Tommy Chong.  if ppl do some quick research they should be able to figure out what moves and what doesnt from the info provided in the market history.  learning how to read that window will save you a lot of stress and wtf moments.
---
Jesus dude, just give it a fucking rest... Talk about a broken record.
---
Sounds like mining was the issue itself. Consider exploration which can be done solo, high risk, high reward in cheap ships! Or you can blitz highsec anomalies for escalations or do missions. Eventually you could move onto incursions. 
---
There are plenty of ways to make isk as a casual player, I highly suggest you do some research on these and if one sounds good you should find a community that does it. Getting a Corp that enhances your activity is by far the most important part of enjoying eve
---
No.

Pretty soon it's just gonna be bots all the way down.
---
Sorry I tend not to read your posts to preserve my sanity.
---
The solution- break the umbrella.  Make resources \*\*limited\*\* in every region. More people in the same region means less resources/isk for everyone. Force people to spread out more and rorqs and caps need no balance or nerfs.
---
I do think that for some people, as plex goes up they are more likely to buy an occassional plex with irl money and sell it sure.

No, the dramiels never enter the deadspace. They fleet warp and control space.

The drams plus the carrier pilot collect missions in the beginning, then fill up here and there as needed.

So let me explain why I am currently broke. A few years back I was going through most medical problems ended up having open heart surgery.  My alliance at the time helped me out with a GoFundMe. 
---
I never really returned after surgery except to contract out my things as a thank you to my Corp and alliance friends. 
---
Hadn't thought about returning till now. 
---
Being healthy and back on track, I'd like to make a return fund my accounts and once I get the hang of things again make a move to WH or Null space.
---
No. It’s like 16 min raitaru/athanor , astra is 24min for example. This is high power numbers. You need 6kdps to achieve damage cap on these iirc (5k applied, but 20% resists).
---
I don’t have the numbers for other structures at the moment since I’m not st my computer, but i hope this at least answers your 30min question 
---
There are many knowledgeable whalers besides me. One of them got his CSM spot stolen last year by The Judge buying votes from SP farmers. But CSM is a perfect example representative democracy right?
---
If you want to talk about me I have been a drone stealer only last 7 months of my 10 years of Eve career. I like how you're supposed to be this well-grounded mature poltician CSM but don't even care to check my youtube or get knowledgeable about my background before making a false point.
---
Besides, farming ecosystem and whaling issues directly decide nullsec meta atm. The CSM could use an expert solely on that regardless of their general knwoedge. How nobody talked about supercap umbrellas -literally the most inherent problem in this game atm- in those minutes was exactly the reason why I kept telling you someone like you can't represent someone like me. You just don't have sufficient perspective on it due to lack of experience, and you will never get it because your social circle will keep reinforcing the opposite perspective.
---
I'll have to look into faction warfare. I've been studying up and practicing defensive tactics and escaped some pretty harry attacks and being hunted in WHs. I need to polish some offensive skills as well but I'm not there yet. My best ship atm is a battlecruiser, Hurricane. But I'm still a couple of weeks out from maximizing its potential. Still down around a little over 500 dps and still significantly weaker defensively than it should be as well. It should break 2k dps with a bit more time. My skill points grow at half the rate of an omega. Option two is not as interesting and getting stuck in it would make me lose interest in the game. Going through every detail of the games mechanics and mapping it in spreadsheets is much more appealing to me. I've also just formulated a new high volume market strategy. 
---
Thanks.
---
I'm currently unemployed, but I'd sure as hell rather just PLEX so I can spend more time trying to shoot mans rather than trying to rat or rorq for isk.
---
Could you list said insane workarounds, I’m new
---
Makes sense. Should have just docked, I waited too long for fighters to come back. Oh well, shit happens. 
---
Mostly setting up entire citadels in one system just for access to more clone bays. 
---
And if you didn't know if you dock in a citadel where you have a jump clone installed and jump to it you will not incur a jump cooldown. (Does not work in NPC stations.)
---

Slicer takes some skill to fly well in pvp, just setting an orbit on someone, even if you are much faster than them, will allow them to preform a slingshot and land scram on you, turning of your mwd.

1) stop voting for Sort Dragon (check)

2) leave blue donut discord (check)

3) invade GOTG (TBA)  
---
Are you implying having assets is hard or do you care to make what the fuck you are even saying explicit.
---
Only if she brought the hot pockets she promised!
---
You do have to stop cloak to attack, and there is a delay between decloaking and locking a target on all ships that aren’t stealth bombers. 
---
But it’s very useful for running away, when you are either doing exploration or pvp and need to avoid a group of enemies that is too big

I made my proposals pretty clear.

You're mostly known for stealing drones now, so hey. 
---
Tikktokk didn't get his spot "stolen." He didn't win. Everybody knew the rules, and if Tikktokk wanted to buy votes, he was free to do that.
---
I also think it's hilarious that you're dinging me for not doing a complete opposition research on you before noting that you do the main thing you're well known for when you were making gross generalities about my views on issues when I started running without even talking to me.  Don't be a hypocrite. 
---
You didn't say "I should be on the CSM because I have general game knowledge," you said that "[w]e need someone who hunts in heavy guarded umbrella space ... on CSM."
---
That's way too in the weeds. 
---
"Besides, farming ecosystem and whaling issues are too important. They directly decide nullsec meta by being the most important determinant of why the generic nullseccer joins an alliance. CSM could use an expert solely on that regardless of their general knowledge."
---
No. That's absolutely wrong. That knowledge, alone, is meaningless. 
---
The supercap umbrella issue is a symptom of a larger problem - supercap proliferation, and how oppressive massive numbers of caps are to subcap fleets.  We spent days talking about that stuff. Your specific complaints are subsumed by that larger problem.
---
Hey, if you want to run for CSM, go for it. 
---
My corpate has a can in Jita with super rare skins worth about 150 billion... He wouldn't be opppsed to selling some if people make offers... He's spent time and ISK getting some of those skins.

But people don't want to make offers, they want it given on a silver fucking platter.

Best comment in this thread by a million miles.
---
It's almost as if all the FW candidates should band together for the next election, publicly endorse each other, and urge their voters to only vote for FW candidates, any FW candidates.
---
It's almost as if the topics were brought to the csm members and blatantly ignored... Weird that representatives don't rep the people... It's almost like... Real politicians... 
---
If Steve hadn't brought this up, I was going to as a complete and utter pander to Dunk. 
---
But I get that, I'll run, I doubt I'll have the backing of a major nullsec alliance. But at least I'm online while the devs are. 
---
they did face risk, its why they are dead.
---
This is basically it. Spamming structures just for the clone bay. 
---
No its not, the csm is meant to represent the people that vote for them. The rest of you can get involved or get fucked.
---
They should have left the HIC change and laughed as you closed your accounts.
---
I asked for and brought up a bunch of stuff at the last summit. We knew that FW was not on the list of things to discuss this time, so we didn't repeat ourselves after last time. 
---
As I noted in the other thread, I made a passionate plea for CCP to look at FW, which got a single sentence in the minutes. 
---
Now that war decs are done, null and high sec have gotten plenty of attention since the citadel expansion. Next up needs to be low sec and FW. 
---
Finally you're being honest with yourself.

Did we? Or are you lumping all wormholers in together here...? The minority went on the offence after the whole HK thing. Minority...

So one of your friends decides to go help someone you dislike in a fight, but they have been friends for a while. The people they are getting in a fight with are people who you have recently hated and had a fist fight with yourself, very recently.

A) Help your friend despite their choice of company
---
B) Just stay out of it
---
C) Just go there and fight other people you dislike

D (for dino) Go punch your friend right in the mouth

Well yeah, those are horrible grindy activities with no excitement. I play on the market quite a bit just commodity trading and opening markets for fun when things are slow so I really don't need to buy as much plex as I do - I just don't really care to spend my time grinding anything but logi reps for my homies :)
---
If farming assets is easy, why doesn't everyone have a supercap umbrella the size of the imperium?
---
Rewards, sure.
---
I'm not being rewarded, I'm making a fucking purchase.
---
Fuck your alliance KB. If they're actually salty about a dead ratting carrier they're fucking trash. 
---
How exactly are ventures in plexes an isk faucet? 
---
&gt; You're mostly known for stealing drones now, so hey.
---
It's because it's been an incredibly novel and successful method that attracted recognition. But so what? I'll have you know we killed 10 supers in Delve last month. You know, the stuff that CSM believes should die more often.
---
&gt; Everybody knew the rules
---
Most people didn't know you could buy votes. Nobody ever cared to. If CCP allows that, then the rules are bad. And you can't invoke "holy democracy" in a system where people can buy votes.
---
you do the main thing you're well known for when you were making gross generalities about my views
---
&gt; You didn't say "I should be on the CSM because I have general game knowledge," you said that "[w]e need someone who hunts in heavy guarded umbrella space ... on CSM."
---
I offered it as a necessary qualification. I didn't deny general game knowledge or other commonsensical good qualities in a CSM. I also didn't imply things like next CSM should be a botter or an RMT'er as long as he whaled in Delve. Commonsensical standards go without saying, right? "We need a CSM member that whaled in Delve and no other qualifications matter" is just an extremely uncharitable (and illogical) reading of what I said. Such a politician of you.
---
&gt; No. That's absolutely wrong. That knowledge, alone, is meaningless.
---
The prime feedback CCP needs for the betterment of this game atm is someone who understands the past 4 years evolution of Eve ecosystem from a non-null-empire-builder perspective. And a major component of it is farming and non-consensual PVP (killing of farming ships) patterns. That determines most people's decision to join an alliance. Not the quality of their PvP, their FCs, not their wars, propaganda, culture, or memes. That's why warfare MER has been so important.
---
&gt; The supercap umbrella issue is a symptom of a larger problem - supercap proliferation
---
Lol. You're taking things in the reverse way, my friend. Proliferation happened after umbrellas were established. Proliferation fed back into the umbrella, but umbrellas were the first. If people weren't able to protect their entire space with having capitals logged in a central system, they wouldn't have been able to proliferate this much.
---
The umbrella gameplay was lazy, broken and stupid even before 2014 but it had limited effects in Eve until these effects were amplified by proliferation, which was enabled by injectors and Rorquals and so on.
---
What if we stopped trying to make convoluted solutions?
---
The only reason drones are for afk ratting is because they auto retaliate.
---
Remove aggressive from drones, force them to be passive. 
---
Simple, and works. 
---
The mark five is definitely the vessel of choice for this demanding task. ( ͡ºั ͜つ ͡ºั)
---
What's this FW I keep hearing about? Is it a new thing?
---
people just d-plex in unfitted ventures and tether to citadels, literally the same problem as ratting vni bots...they make easy lp with no risk lp turns to iskx
---
Thats even sader. 
---
it's this broken aspect of the game that once upon a time was glorious till citadels made it easy to stage in any system
---
Buy high sell low
---
Yeah. Well, maybe if the citadel is not owned by the faction that controls the system, it should lose asset safety, that ought to kick the incentive up a notch.
---
make a bookmark above or below the citadels you use.  this would be a place a cyno could light and the caps jumping in would not bump off of the citadel.  this is your deep tether.  you don't warp to citadel you warp to your bookmark.  no reason to ever land at the edge of tether on purpose in a cap.
---
other than that what avree said on your fighters.
---
you could also just abandon them like drones.  if they don't get  killed you can scan them down with combats and then pick them up in an industrial or even your carrier.  fighters are cheaper than your cap.
---
Because it's about having the most assets, the largest umbrella. If someone is mathematically bound to have most assets. It's mathematically not something 2 alliances can do. 
---
Can you raise above children playground level in your arguments?
---
Have you ever exchanged lp in a lp store? 
---
implying you should need to vote to get bad game design changed
---
Thanks a lot, i will in about a month hehe
---
There is no counterplay to gatecamps aside from nullification and cynos, gatecampers just warp off before you can jump anything threatening to them. As someone who both struggled with instalock daredevil campers and made 1k+ kills in said instalock gatecamping daredevil, I'm not convinced that lazy gatecamp gameplay should be buffed in any way.
---
If modern gate camps are more or less waste of time as you said, how come there are still same people that camp their choke-point systems for years?
---
And that's why we see so many roaming gangs featuring tackle garmurs and dramiels, right?
---
For everything, turn turn turn, there is a season, turn turn turn, and a time to every purpose, under heaven.

I could make a meme, where ccp is a porn actress, and the csm is strong hands forcing them to take down what is a long list of lowsec fw suggestions. 
---
So according to you an entity that has taken sovereignty over space is not allowed to defend their space and their people by any means necessary?
---
Hey, yeah it’s me.  That’s my ship you tanked :).  I don’t mind the hate.  Or that I can spend occasionally on games.  All in fun, and very happy you got some benefit from it.  
---
I’m not going anywhere and I’m sure this won’t be my biggest mistake...    but before too long I’ll get the hang of the game and get into its dna and culture.  And we will all dance.
---
Happy gaming and I will be seeing you.

Your daddy Killahbee wont be happy with this....

I mean why not go for cheaper fits first? That much isk on a subcap isn't really efficient compared to caps bro

Damn a gay phone sex line on an 800 number instead of 900?
---
If you were the Horde carrier that died, the hunters would of 100 percent been watching you from a horde alt. It most likely cov cynoed that tengu in and knew your pattern. 
---
If you always align to citadel and not next site, and their is a cluster of citadels near your fort, warp to a different one each time or just abandon fighters as last resort.
---
Honesty I’m transitioning from another game...   and I haven’t quite calibrated on what “a lot” means in this game yet.

I played this game last in 2006....   so trying to learn the new ropes.
---
And to the post below...   yeah I bought plex...   and it was about 200 wasted.  Sucks but I game for fun...    not with my rent...   with money I could spend on gold, motor cycles, boats...   what ever.  I don’t play for free, I actually believe great games should pay the people who make them.

Still, pricing will play a role. If it is less than 10b for the hull I expect it will have fairly widespread use
---
Honestly, to combat botting from a mechanics perspective, something like an overhaul of the ESI would be more effective. Something like toe following:
---
1. Make it necessary to gain more then salvage from anomalies
---
2. Add a cooldown to accessing it so that you can only open it every hour or so
---
3. Give it a damage cap with no reinforce timer so that it can't be blapped off the field
---
4. Make the ISK generate in the form of blue loot, loot that drops if it is destroyed
---
5. Remove the ability for other people to steal from it, they now need to shoot it. 
---
6. Change the system wide ping to when it gets shot
---
7. Make them un-anchorable withing 1000km of a citadel
---
8. Change rat aggression to shoot ESIs (Not certain of the feasibility of this)
---
This dose two things. First, it is a content driver similar to what camping a station unlock was. It gives you something you can shoot, a the locals can't ignore without consequence. It also gives you a way to not only target bots in a more efficient fashion, but also makes hunting bots potentially profitable. An alliance will put people out to help and defend its members if they are trying to make ISK (much like they do with roroquals). It is much less likely that a group is going to put out people to protect 2-3 VNI bots however. Hunters can either wait for a VNI to access the structure, or shoot it to steal their last hour worth of ratting. It also allows you to disrupt a bot until the owner drops a new ESI, and you an target them when they do. If rat aggro can be changed then it also prevents people from dropping them in a site with only the triggers killed.
---
Does Biology extent the duration of Cerebral Accelerators? If so, would Biology IV + a Master-at-Arms Accelerator give more SP than a 400k SP injector?

A naive attitude. The Chinese cluster together in games. Perhaps because of the shared language, perhaps for cultural reasons.

You have to be living under a rock not to know that the Chinese ruin any games with shared severs.

Is not really a credit card warrior kind of thing.  It’s pretty inexpensive if you forego other hobbies like golf, or skiing...   frankly the only reason I created that Nestor with all the ‘purple’ (btw...   WOW sucks ass....) was to try and get the Nestor to Cap Stable...   was just way bad luck the OP was gate camping a 0.4 sec zone.   
---
how about ... uhm ... just shooting it?
---
grr! Gewnz!
---
It's not about what means I think the entity should be allowed to use.
---
It's about what means the game provides them to use and whether these means are balanced. 
---
The phrase "by any means necessary" is limited by what means exist in the game that an alliance can use. A balance discussion is about changing these means.
---
"Reported for offensive language"
---
you don't need "the biggest umbrella" to drop titans on a few bombers.
---
Yes I’m in GOONS
---
You cannot get it for LP
---
Is heavy neut curse still possible? 
---
&gt; you don't need "the biggest umbrella" to drop titans on a few bombers
---
You need it to consistently drop titans to a few bombers. Or in a couple of months someone will kill your titans. Happened in Cobalt Edge / Outer Passage 2017. You wouldn't know, because you are not knowledgeable, but hey were farming as much as Delve btw at the earlier MER's btw.
---
&gt;where did i fuck up in this idea?
---
basically you required me to have an exploration bot so i can carry on vni ratting.
---
congrats you've just encouraged more botting.
---
You could get a better fit for 700m isk. 
---
Throwing more isk will net you a slightly better result, but not by much. A good, cheap fit, will beat an expensive bad fit. 
---
&gt; You need it to consistently drop titans to a few bombers.
---
no you don't.
---
you don't need "the biggest umbrella" to defend your space.
---
as evidenced by the fact that delve still had an umbrella up when half of their supercaps were rolling their balls all over the north's face a few months ago.
---
there was literally half an umbrella still doing a more than adequate job of defending the south.
---
oh ew, purchase only loot boxes isn't lazy design, it's questionable business practices. 
---
"Lazy" is a really bad word to use. If your a designer, and you are designing for particular things, randomness is _the best_ solution in your toolbelt, and study after study proves it, no matter what the folks on the internets say. 
---
People had there chance to buy them like everyone else, what about people who have invested a lot of isk into limited skins. Lemme get a box with discontinued AT ship while you're at it thanks.
---
Good read!
---
depends what you're trying to achieve?
---
a retarded grindfest? yeah rng that shit to fuck.
---
engaging content? not a chance.
---
if you think RNG makes things engaging - it doesn't. you just have 1 cookie cutter fit that can deal with the worst case RNG and everyone runs it... can't think where that happens in eve, it certainly wouldn't be in abyssal sites where everyone runs the same gila or sac fit is it?
---
&gt; you don't need "the biggest umbrella" to defend your space.
---
You need either attract Rorquals, mine considerable amounts, and conduct "vertical farming".
---
&gt; there was literally half an umbrella still doing a more than adequate job of defending the south.
---
Because people didn't move a larger capital force in that time to Delve during that time. If they did, then you umbrella would return. It returned soon enough anyway. Those "wars" were often merely a few weekends.
---
Leave  Derelik  alone too please. Surely its better to properly address the underlying problems that exist with FW rather than just randomly adding regions, otherwise you will just get more of the same :(
---
&gt; You need either attract Rorquals, mine considerable amounts, and conduct "vertical farming".
---
no you don't. source; all the rorquals i've got on my killboard outside of delve.
---
&gt;Because people didn't move a larger capital force in that time to Delve during that time
---
yes, because their capitals were already being bent over a table by the caps already in the north.
---
&gt;If they did, then you umbrella would return.
---
the umbrella didn't go away - that was my entire point.
---
You only need to lose a 3 bil carrier once a few months to make farming in one not worth it, it's not you VNI bot.
---

Thing is with smaller ships expensive stuff isn't as good. For example if you are in a frig, the difference between a t2 module dps and officer module dps will be max 100 dmg. That isn't worth the billion price tag unless you are flying one of the super expensive at ships (DON'T GO BUY AN AT SHIP JUST TO FEED). This dps difference is noticeable only on capital ships and above. I would really suggest you ask on r/fittings or join the eve discord and come to the solo - pvp channel. Good on you for not raging. But please know that real money will only serve to get you killed in hilarious ways without you having fun. 
---
Had to be when I took a roam out to Querious and managed to tackle some dreads on a NARM pos. I only had like 13 people in fleet so I expected a reinforcement fleet and batphoned NCdot and NARM. Managed to kill the dreads I had tackled and a few small shit before warping to a safe due to me not trusting the other FC's. 
---
I haven't taken a fleet out in a minute but that was the moment that made me realize I enjoyed it.

 " I started buying plex when it was about 800mil/unit, and in that time I have noticed what so many other traders noticed, that the price of plex is not deterring anyone from buying it. Essentially, we all say its expensive, but we can all afford to plex our accounts. "
---
As i trader u see no change :P  cos always someone is buying but are those same ppl in the time frame ???
---
 as i corp member i lost 5/10 corp members due price of plex :P so i see it diferent 
---
&gt; no you don't. source; all the rorquals i've got on my killboard outside of delve.
---
I already gave you quite a few examples on why you do, and what happened to people who didn't. 
---
A single umbrella can fit 1/3 of entire null's population under their protection (with respect to addressing their farming needs). Thus, groups with largest umbrellas can still constantly recruit people. Would a Rorqual 15-boxer move to a region where there is relatively a weak umbrella where should a larger capital force move in, he'd have to lose ships or stop farm at least, or the largest umbrella under which nothing can touch the Rorquals? Ofc he'll move to the largest umbrella. Which explains what's been happening in Delve. 
---
The few Rorquals in your umbrella doesn't change any of that, or anything I previously said. I too like linking anecdotal kills when people say things like "you can't mine over 3t/mo without the largest umbrella or being blue to it". 
---
&gt; the umbrella didn't go away - that was my entire point.
---
Your point was that the leftover "half" umbrella was not the largest anymore. If it wasn't, then idk what else it can be. Yes it didn't go away.
---
&gt; yes, because their capitals were already being bent over a table by the caps already in the north.
---
If your argumentative process wasn't at the child's playground level, you would realize this confirms my point. I'll just stop playing along. This is not worth my time.
---
I have some bad news for you about that NC. and grr donut thing.

Except that 55 plex skin is not worth 55 plex on the ingame market. It can be worth 200mil or 20mil,but you still pay 100 mil isk for the plex necessary to buy the lootbox. 
---
It feels very strange to be agreeing with you, Grath.
---
one tru solve :  MAKE  FOR PLEX  DATE OF EXPIRY :p- TRADED ONLY VIA CONTRACTS, 1,5 YEAR OF EXPIRY IS ENOUGH I THINK :)
---
lmao, didn't even think to do that in hi sec.... hilarious.
---
My biggest paranoia whenever doing any anchoring/unanchoring of any type of structure is that some shit like that will happen.

Inb4 skill extracting bots are a thing

Not gonna lie, met Rise at Eve Vegas and he is a stellar fucking dude. Him and Guard are my two favorites.
---
is that constellation really named Malaria too? LOL
---
Ooh! Thanks for making this post, I had kinda written it off as a Windows only thing. I might be joining in after all.
---
Is this done on purpose? For when I accidentally looked at [Current CSM](https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/current-csm/), I was very surprised with the results ... to say the very least.  
---
I can imagine that it would be a relatively short amount of work to at least get things up to date for a couple of important items. Even if it were only to update the info to display the current CSM members and show the most recent minutes, this would make the whole section seem so much more professional. 
---
nah
---
Not really. Eve is about making decisions anyway. You can't do everything with one character. That's it, you have to make a decision.
---
Some context is needed though. Your corp where you lost 5-10 guys, was it a 1k man corp? Or was is a rookie corp in hisec of 20 guys? Legit asking because I do feel that the New Player Experience in eve fucking sucks. Isk is easy as shit to make once you learn how to make it, but until then it is a struggle. 
---
My point ultimately was that very few players quit as of yet over plex prices. Vets in particular have the income streams to easily plex their 2 titan toons, 1 super toon, their fax alt, their sabre alt, and their main. The bulk of my income is from trading but even without trading I can make enough to plex 6 accounts in 1 day of grinding a month. The trick is that we need to teach new players how to do this.
---
That burn was just as good as the gif. 
---
I hate krabbing too, which is why when I do it, I only do the best isk/hour activities and I vary what I do. 1 day I might spend 3 hours on a solo loki where I can expect to make in the realm of 1-2 bil in that time. Sometimes I spend 2 hours super ratting which is 500 mil ish depending on things. I run l5s if I need serious money, a night of doing that is a good 5 bil. 
---
So can you start asking about SOE titans? Maybe they'll forget and accidentally stick the Angel Titan in sooner.
---
TFW your nestor is worth 3 of your marshalls.

CSM is useless, who knew 
---
How dose putting EVE on the cloud in any way effect botting?
---
What sort of troll question. Is that. 
---
TBH same here i am currently rethinking what accounts to wind down.    
---
Can i afford to Plex them with the current activities ? Yes ... but WHY.      
---
MMO is about interacting with another players.        
---
Currently people utilize so many alts that this is getting insane and boring.              
---
I know that CCP want to make $$ ... but i as a player and customer want to have a healthy product, something that EVE is not.            
---
Why i just don't quit the game ... because i have year long subs running.

Attempting to buy performance in game with real money at any scale is literally the definition of credit card warrior, it’s not about how much money that actually is to you. Golf or skiing are two hobbies that cost a lot of money at start and on ongoing basis, a more reasonable comparison is a musical instrument, or books/other games.
---
If you think that cap stability in isolation means anything for a PvP fit, you’re already off on the wrong track - Capacitor warfare modules exist for a reason.
---
There are so many other things wrong with your fits that luck is irrelevant, the only people you will beat in a fit like that are equally new players with similar absence of game knowledge. EVE is a game that is highly dependent on accumulated knowledge and skills. Try flying nothing worth more than 200m ship+fit for a year, until that doesn’t feel like a meaningful restriction, i.e. you’re actually roaming and winning fights consistently.

It does and it doesn't. It's not the same game it was in 2007-2008; the devs stopped making the fun videos, the balance patches seem few and far in between, and its become just...different.
---
I still love it to death and I will play medic or heavy any day, though.
---
For the record they aren't salty. 
---
&gt; How can't they work on every single issue in the game is beyond me
---
How they can't work on multiple issues at the same time is beyond me.
---
And I think you overestimate how much isk rorquals make. That 250m/hour on ore is not only unrealistic but it is also bad compared to the activities that OP suggested which you refuse to believe for no reason. And there's plenty more that earn you half a billion an hour and more.
---
Super ratting is suicidal and stupidly expensive for the average player to get into. The same goes for rorquals. I don't get how people like you just go around thinking people have a hundred billion+ isk lying around to inject multiple rorqs.
---
I'm not even going to argue with you about botting, because that argument is just stupid. I'm surprised you didn't also bring up being rich irl as an easy way to make isk.
---
you are saying it is an isk faucet. it is not. lp stores are an isk sink.
---
you get items in exchange for lp and isk.
---
than you sell the items on market and have to pay fees.
---
so there are actuelly 2 is sinks involved in selling items from lp store.
---
the is kyou get for the item you sell were already generated and only transferred to you.
---

Most inclusive game ever
---
All the salt from people complaining about the time. Look at https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility and you will see that ccp chose the perfect time. 
---
don't worry about the game-breaking tactic that my alliance exposed and is currently the top beneficiary of. pay no attention to the storks behind the curtain
---
Do it
---
So to the original question.
---
If its so easy and lazy, why do so few people have umbrellas?
---
hey dude just wanted to say you seem to be doing a really good job and i appreciate your presence on the csm
---
Ah appreciate you taking the time to educate me.... Let me rephrase. Fw lp store is very low risk high reward
---
&gt; What exactly is the problem with nullified interceptors now that combat ones were 'fixed'?
---
if nullified interceptors can be viably combat fitted while having sub-2s align, no matter how pathetic their damage or ehp, they will 100% dominate the fozziesov meta. a ship that can't be tackled or responded to at all, that you can put 150 of into a fleet and volley basically anything subcapital, destroys the game
---
losing nullification is one way to balance them, the way i'd go personally is to remove their weapon hardpoints
---
Because it's not trivial to rework the whole thing compared to fixing capitals which mostly takes value changes ?
---
You are welcome. And I agree with you, ventures should not be able to enter fw plexes or at least lose it's bonus to ship warp core strength. 
---
We do talk with ccp outside of the summit. By text or video chat
---
&gt; compared to fixing capitals which mostly takes value changes ?
---
That's a bold statement considering it's CCP and it's been 2 years of complaining.
---
So, how did you actually get the ship? Any particular story behind it?
---
How about a pirate faction. Where a system can be captured by a third party pirate force that doesn’t care about standings.  Also allow Factions to capture null SOV as a new dynamic. 
---
Yes
---
Yes it's almost has if in 2 years they haven't published new structures, abyssal space and the ships that comes with them. Because CCP can't just do balance.
---
I think he's retarded and forgot that whs and ls have both had serious problems preceding that time they fucked up and made rorquals the best lining ship in the game. 
---
So means u need to have high end computer to play eve otherwise u have a huge disadvantage ??Sounds fair
---
ratting in anything above a VNI in horde is asking to get awoxed

[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75775817/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75775817/) Are you this guy by any chance?
---
I always make a 0KM bm inside the perimeter and above the fortizar, a spot where a neut or red mostly wont have a way to warp w/o making prior a bm too so I'll land deep inside the structure tethering zone. 
---
You could also try and have a cloak on the carrier, loose a bit of dps and be aligned to a deep safe of your own in the system. Usually I have 2 or 3 such spots.
---
Tough im curious to know if neut can scan me down while I slow down and exit warp. Maybe someone can shed some light on this issue.
---
Well I have actually lol, but the basics of using a drone with fighter or drone mechanics isn’t overly different, other than being able to manually send them places or control them individually.
---
What would you say makes such a massive difference with a change to the newer mechanics?
---
Are there other factors, yes. But if you take the time to compare the two prices you can see that it is the presiding factor and my statement was true.
---
Another one who does not understands how world actually works trying to think,..... please stop
---
You wouldn't afk rat, but bots don't just warp around and sit in sites waiting for rats to hit them. It's only a partial solution.

---
Point #3 may make Vily and Gobbins bros again. 
---
Hopefully its not like the stress test, where a 400 man fight took 16+ gigs.  Knowing CCP, that's probably exactly what we'll get.
---
So what issues did you try to bring to Brisc's attention?
---
Did you speak up and make it clear that the whole HK thing didn't represent your views or did you sit back and smirk while it was happening?
---
yah like this is the most important matter at this moment of eve
---
Remember when the Praxis sold for half a billion? What something costs due to novelty/short supply at first tells nothing of its actual value. Drekavacs, a fantastic ship, dropped from 400m+ to 200ish in the first month after its release. A navy BC is around 150m. SerQwaez makes a fair point.
---
In theory, but its not even guaranteed to do that.  If poorly implemented it could cause even more problems.
---
Mass test was pretty bad and only had like 400 dudes, so I hope for everyone's sake it gets VASTLY improved before launch.
---
At the current price? Very tempting indeed... Take 1 hour overtime at work to buy plex =&gt; not needing to do any ratting all month at least.
---
Dunno if this is dumb idea but I kinda wanna have the possibility of a wreck exploding and doing a little bit of damage when it's being salvaged.
---
Also another most likely dumb idea is that I would love to see some sort of ship graveyards, kinda like asteroid fields but for ships. I know that big fights leave these behind naturally, but if there were some kind of daily npc fights that left these in their wake too. 
---
Especially with the clear, well articulated consensus on what losec actually needs. I mean it's just a c&amp;p job, CCP, smh!
---
Your alliance leader is a goon and has been for years. Think about it: so many odd things currently make sense now, right?
---
if the client is in the cloud (so similar to citrix connection where screen image is just streamed to your computer, and your computer sends control signals back) this would limit the botting to OCR bots, and eliminate memory reading ones/whatever else there is.
---
however that means that:
---
a) ccp would need to have enough resources to virtualise every client people use (and everyone will play in full quality mode, cause why not) 
---
b) players will need to have enough bandwidth to receive uninterrupted stream (anyone who used citrix would attest that it's far from flawless even when you are just doing normal office tasks or teleconferencing, let alone play a video game)
---
in short, if you ever watched someone streaming a game, imagine that stream as you see it is your gaming experience.
---
But have you heard about lack of Lowsec gate to Stain?
---
Nope.      
---
Someone will have a chance to make a LOT of isk.      
---
By this post i increase the chance that this guy will be not from the northern club for bois 
---
I don't know if csm has ever had a fw rep other. I think since csm should have a discord and setup committees and focus groups on certain topics. 
---
If you get the Komodo - please post some SS on reddit 
---
Have an upventure
---
Sorry but you are mistaken about the plex supply. While there may not be a drastic decrease, graphs or no graphs, data or no data, I don't know what game you play but it must be different one from the one I play.
---
In the game I play over the last 2 years or so I have seen countless people leave due to the related issues. Mainly the "newbros in ravens" as you put it when they get ready and go out to NS and the realization of all this bullshit of multi accounting, botting and all that actually truly hits them. They realize at that precise and exact point that in order to keep up they have to either become like that themselves, or start paying more per single month then most AAA game titles charge with all their DLCs. And they get really pissed off and leave.
---
These people who leave, while not being large plex suppliers, alliance whales etc, are definetly suppliers. They occasionally purchase plex and sell it to get some ships or activate 1 alt for a month or two, thats it. And there is a ton of them.
---
While tehre is no data break down available for this I would not be surprised if at minimum 50% of all plex on market originally came from such people, probably more like 70% or so but I'm being liberal with this number. And these people, and their plex seeding is disappearing from the game.
---
This is a valid point. The page has been going under the radar for a while, which resulted in a bunch of information being outdated. I would like to do a major pass to verify exactly what needs to be done and fix that in one go. Going to put that on my agenda after EVEsterdam :)
---
Brisc's problem is that he is a paid schrill out of game and thinks that it should work the same way in game. RL politics is sucky for a game.
---
I mean, you could enable forts and ks to have multiple clones. That should work
---
Heh, people who play single accounts switch to subs, especially 3 or 6 month ones for lower prices, not plex their accounts. Or rather not on regular basis, pelx an alt when you need it, and thats it, then let it expire.
---
I think FW should get a look
---
I'm in nullsec, so I know very little about FW
---
I would vote for a FW candidate if there was one out there, but I haven't seen one of late
---
It would still be an improvement over GSM, so it's a good start
---
One of the botters that has posted here on reddit, been a while ago, and posted his data, was making 2.7 tril / month. You can dig it up if you like. And there are / were others that made less but still around 1.5-2 tril / month. Also, do not assume they did so in a single region or on a single bot type.
---
I would asset safety to completely removed but I still like your idea.
---
idk about incursion rats, but with regular rats this is not true. Yellow means they have you locked but aren't shooting at you, but rather at something else. They will red box even if they are shooting and missing.
---
Nope, clean install of Deepin 15.9.2 beta (based on Debian Stable) with Wine Staging 4.4 from WineHQ installed. Not done anything else on the system. Double clicked the file and it run the page waiting for your code.
---
I have to assume that the client part is going to be fairly basic, it is the back end that they want to stress test.
---
Doesn't touch TiDi, as that's server side.

Better to run missions after the next patch

Pretty much.

---
Praxis doesn't need Abyss mats to build. If CCP would make Trig dreds, those mats will skyrocket. And GFL farming enough of them on AFK VNIs or botting in T1s and T2s Abyss, you need to farm T4s and T5s soyou get decent quantities.
---
Also, if anything, just scroll down and see the otehr posts about Trig shit here. A lot of them speculate that T2 Trig subcaps are coming, and I'm kinda with them, I do see their reasons for thinking that, which will make all those mats spike way up anyways, if you throw a Dred on top of that .... LOL. I hope all those Rorq and AFK VNI pilots can run some T5s !
---
Yup
---
\&gt;  This isn't something that is planned, it was just an idea that CCP Guard threw out there. 
---
Can you read?
---
I think certain grids, like jita 4-4 are larger, around 40,000km3 iirc.
---
Meh, hopefully a few years after Trig ships. Trig ships &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Angel crap
---
I'm gonna put my Money on bored rather than mad. So you can stop posting about how mad NCdotto is.
---
I will never stop posting. 
---
n+1 IS normal and IS accepted, why? because it's human nature, it's how towns and cities came to be. It's ALWAYS going to be like this.
---
It's fine to want to always want fight the big guy but you can't complain when the big guy fights back.
---
CSM not useless if you're in the alliance that controls it.
---
If you going to say something like this then you too should explain how it does work and why the OP needs educating?
---
I hate cocky comments like this.
---
Pro tip-  Buy a new character now or you will be perpetually farmed.  Or don't.. whatever.  #eve2019
---
FW is already represented in CSM, by Brisc Rubal.
---
Untill you go elsewhere and do it (like to NC.) then thats how you come across, it's how you are always going toc ome across as you keep banging that grrr goon drum.
---
I used to honestly like your posting when you started doing it but honestly it's really just sad now. Go elsewhere and try the same thing and let us see the same results, proof is int he pudding my friend.
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/26888/losses/ huh?
---
And that's not even counting boosting clones, speed clones, pve combat clones, the number of clones is too damn high.
---
i mostly only krab ingame when there's nothing better to do, usually raising adms with my vnis or mining with my 2 rorqs, less for the income than to add ore to the alliance buyback
---
partly because plex is so high that it's almost irresponsible for me not to take advantage, partly because i'm playing a lot of other games (td2 just launched, etc) so it's harder to justify eve monopolizing my time, partly because i've kind of already bought all the expensive things i would grind for
---
Thanks for the clarity my dude. Sort of a bad mechanic, hard to know all the little things like that. Lesson learned lol.

Stop banging the grrr goon drum. ALL of the current major players in their own little corners of space do this EXACT same thing. Granted it has taken some of them only to do it in the last 4-5 months as they were slow to adapt to the meta but they ALL do it now.
---
Goon drum.....ALL do it....:thiking:
---
&gt; would think of
---
Can you?
---
We get your point but as it stands you don't get your own point as they were NOT blue to it.
---
&gt; because it's human nature
---
You cant base game design into human nature. This game doesnt necessarily have to support n+1 all the time although risk-free krabbers like the mentality.
---
TiDi happens on the server side to reduce to load on the node you moron. Also you can fairly easily make bots that are based on OCR instead of memory inspection, so it wouldn't solve that problem either.
---
I dont care how I come across to you or Goons. No matter what I say Goons will think I say what I say because I hate Goons. The problem is their cult mentality, not what I say or do.
---
My favorite bait to this day. Sad that link coloring scheme has ruined it

Huh, never noticed that, nice
---
Christ ... like if you have 10 people trying do defend area and 10 man gang will come ... well they will probably fail in the defense.              
---
If you have 300 people defending same area against the same gang, well the gang have very bad time to do something.             
---
Like you **cannot punish 300 players** for **active defense of space**.            
---
But but ... :          
---
* those players will jump in a bad bad capitals on top of cruisers           
---
* those players will bridge a 60 man subcap fleet on 10 man gang                 
---
Well this is how it works not simply **because it ONLY works this way**              
---
There is no ground control, like you cannot put a perma camp on 1-2 points to cut some area due to wormholes, nullification, cynos and jump drives.          
---
If someone is tackled you don't have 10 or even 5 minutes to get to him but you need to do it ASAP as in many cases he will be gunned down below 1minute.            
---
Fucking amen right here
---
His argument is poor and he cannot reply in a way that suits his narrative, just look at the influence map for groups and I can count 12-14 active super umbrellas for peoples are of space https://www.verite.space/maps/influence/influence.png
---
so as it stands he is full of shit and can only keep screeching "GRR GOONS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE". 
---
Umbrella === Players actively playing the game         
---
There is nothing wrong in this.

Totally, please be mindful of all the crew you chew through with the larger ships, SOE can’t pick up all the escape pods, especially in j-space.

GTFO from those rats! I love them, they are my best buddies.

---
But you clearly do care because it's all you do!
---
At this point it is clear you have some sort of mental illness and you really should take a step back from this GAME.

Games shouldn't be this personal to you and what you spout, they are supposed to be fun to you.
---
Funny cause as a member of the xix/rzr/ra coalition i happend to know there is a decent amount of chinese, and i have been at all the meetings, talked often to all the alliance leadership and there have been no hate towards  the "Chinese" but some against FRT, which is understandable considering the breach of the NIP half a year ago etween DRF and FRT, not to mention the constant reaches of the legacy/frt nip. maby you need to re-evaluate what you extrapolate from what you read? Its clearly incorrect data you arrive at.

Now i need to find another way to make money, carriee ratting is really not enough.

THIS IS NOT EVE AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EVE WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FUCKING STUPID

They already exist in eve and it happens all the time. If you think it doesn't then you are at this point fucking retarded.

Here is your proof https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyQOhZYRswc
---
i have one you spastic
---
Yeah you need your main pvp subcap , dread or carrier alt. Titan / super alt, fax alt. Eve is designed to be played by 4 account.
---
TFW your flawed logic can be used to justify every OP/bad mechanic in the game.
---
Fighters = Capital players actively playing the game.
---
Old cancerous svipul = Svipul pilots actively playing the game.
---
Rorqual multiboxers = Miners actively playing the game.
---
&gt; Like you cannot punish 300 players for active defense of space.
---
It's not written in stone that these 300 players should be able to instantly reach friends in distress in 110 systems by having assets in 1 system.
---
&gt; 250m/hour on ore is not only unrealistic
---
it's more like 100-115 per rorq unless you're cherry picking gneiss, which is more like 140
---
&gt;bad compared to the activities that OP suggested
---
yes and no - running level 5s, faction warfare, drone escalations etc are better single account isk, but you can run about as many rorqs as you want at a time and they all make about that same 100-125m/hr. the safety actually scales up with more rorqs too, as more rorqs in a belt means more combat drones to shoo away tackle and small gang hostiles
---
&gt;Super ratting is suicidal and stupidly expensive for the average player to get into
---
you might be surprised. super ratting is probably out of reach for the average &gt;1yr player, but regular carrier ratting is really not that unrealistic. it doesn't quite make super ratting money, but it's still quite a bit
---
&gt;I don't get how people like you just go around thinking people have a hundred billion+ isk lying around to inject multiple rorqs.
---
mining with a rorq makes enough money that it's somewhat realistic to inject a second rorq with profits from your first after a few weeks. once you have two rorqs, the amount of time it takes you to save up for another rorq is halved, and so on and so on and so on to the limit of your autism for managing rorqs
---
Recall your fighter with mwd it s very fast and warp after you got them. I do this never have problem you just need to be fast ;)
---
Also in ph there s too much spy.
---
my Pink petal-y levi begs to differ.

is it worth using sell orders to offload plex versus dumping them into buys from jita? what's the average spread between your buy and sell orders?
---
don't shit talk Tar' my dude!

They are bugged and get stuck in the station model when bubbled dude. You don't know anything about this situation. You can't target them, get them move to move outside the bubble, they dont attack you. They are just uninteractable ships which instnatly call for help when people undock.

Don't forget that he represents Wormholers, High sec, low sec, Null, abyssal space etc
---
So, then this change would do fuck all to combat botters.
---
Many of the crashes were due to one of the nodes server side falling over dude. duality server resources are minuscule compared to tranquillity, even compared to singularity. frame rate issues are due to TIDI because the response time you get from the server denotes your FPS because the client requires information from the server to draw the scene for the frames to show up on your screen, the later that response is from the server the less FPS u have.

i hadnt heard of using 16+ GB of ram on anyone who used more than 1 client, personally i started the test using 3 clients and realise that was untennable because each was sucking up 5+GB each and i ran out of RAM to allocate, so i dropped to 1 client and was fine the rest of the test as my client RAM usage didnt go past 10GB.

Salt Sprayer: 2 second duration, if target dies while this is active, instantly destroy their pod as well.
---
&gt; tying the duration of a cyno to the mass of ships brought in
---
this is a dumb suggestion
---
literally no group in eve would respond to this change in a way other than "just bring more cynos"
---
&gt;adding a grid-wide cyno cool down period.
---
easily exploited by one side lighting cynos up to the cap and preventing the other side from lighting any to respond with their own forces
---
changing the way jump drives and cynos work would be good, the problem is that literally none of the obvious changes could possibly be made to work in any sort of fair or equitable fashion, and that anything that balances cynos on the basis of how much stuff passes through them is very easily circumvented by just bringing more cynos, which any reasonably well-resourced group can do ad infinitum

---
the character select screen is the same as it's always been since the launch of the game and there's never been a way for you to login multiple characters from the same account before. what's more, in order to prevent characters on the same account interacting, it used to be the case that logging into a different character on the same account made the first character instantly despawn from space, which was exploited to save tackled capital ships occasionally
---
Didn't you leave TBD discord after you fed nightmares trying to rf a TAPI Fort.

This reminds me of a long time ago where I was suspect in highsec without really understanding what was going on. It was in amarr and when I undocked this proteus at 30KM targeted me and send his drones after me. He did not know that my timer was nearly over (neither did I) and right when his drones were about to hit me my suspect timer was over. Yet the drones were still comming my way and started shooting me. The proteus turned criminal and got sweeped by CONCORD.   
---
I don't think citadels can get attacked by concord or get a status flag. As far as  I know you do get a duel timer when gunning a citadel meaning that once you decide to use any offensive module (even if missiles alone) You will both get a 5 minute duel timer which means you are free to engage the pilot until the timer runs out. The timer is instantly refreshed when using any offensive module (even missiles before they actually hit).  
---
I also think fighters will check if the target is allowed to be attacked by them before actually attacking them meaning that they will not attack (even if instructed) whilst a target is no longer suspect.
---
I disagree. If I need to get more ISK in my wallet and I'm prepared to spend $100 or whatever amount, I'm going to spend that amount and reap the rewards of getting more value for my purchase (ISK wise). To me, I've already decided to spend that money anyway, so if I am getting more ISK than I did the month  before that is better for me.
---
Alternatively, I may end up spending more if I see that I can get more value from my purchase. Higher PLEX prices may convince me to spend that extra money to get ISK for whatever I may want.

No troll or shitpost. I beatdown on alot of his stuff because of the way he comes across but he does every now and then come up with some very very good discussions and points about the game, unfortunatly he comes across in the most terrible ways and goes off the rails. Usually alot of grrr goon  and reeeeeeeeee and gets blinded by that but he genuinly going downhill with it. Lashing out the mods by the proxy of conspiracy and the latest csm one (athough I do agree with him on alot of his csm views, he just goes about it in a bad way)
---
Just throw 5 bucks down. 
---
You are missing a very important part here.       
---
We are comparing attackers vs defenders.       
---
10 attackers vs 300 defenders will lead to bad times for the attackers.    
---
Like you cannot punish players for defending some area **or attacking it**       
---
Not sure you quite understand what Stadia does. Given it is pretty much the opposite of what you just said.
---
The "Cloud" computer does all the work and then streams the visual to you, your controller then connects via Wi-fi to their server and sends any commands you have back.
---
It would basically let you play on anything capable of running a Chrome Browser.
---
You would need a good Internet Connection though.
---
Can someone please calculate the actual probability of this happening!! 
---
Does the botting applications recognize the rats with there names? There should be randomly spawns with randomly named rats in belts, then the afk botting rorquals etc get attacked/killed by the rats? :) sorry for bad english
---
best keep it as nostalgia, less you ruin the good memories with the actual bad gameplay
---
Let's run through it. 
---
You land on an enemy frig with your kite dramiel. Usually you would launch drones, press F and forget about them unless they shoot them, in which case you recall and relaunch. 
---
Now lets say they were fighters. You have to launch, then SELECT FIGHTERS instead of your ship, and set them to orbit the enemy, then push the MWD button on them as well. This would be much more difficult as one slip up and your MWD dramiel is going off to orbit the enemy at close range instead of your 2 warrior drones, and you've just lost a 100m ship. This is on top of your usual dance to keep at a range where the enemy is pointed, but he can't land a web on you or escape outside point range. Best hope he doesn't try to slingshot you while you're messing around with your warriors. 
---
If it's something CCP is working on, could you potentially address how we could transfer multiple such clones to clone vats? And then transfer them out again in target citadel?  
---
It would make move ops a hell of a lot easier for deployments, for example, if you didn't have to come back 3 times for the different clones you use.
---
Just to clarify this is just something I asked about myself because it's similar to a mechanic I enjoy from another game. Nothing more behind it than that :). I don't design monetization products.
---
A random chance for an anom to spawn as a debris field for salvage would be amazing. 
---
Don’t leave the discord. I’ll miss you :(
---
Yeah, tells us more about how can a cute newbie can be just as useful as a veteran player by flying ceptor or a sabre in a small gang after just 3 month of training. But when he gets sick of it after 6 month like any other sane person would be and, let's say, hops in a newly trained RLM Cerb with his buddies to dunk on some nerds in Wolf Rayet hole, is he going to stick to formation and do 0 dps with his **just fine** level 4 skills or he will have to burn 20km closer to enemy gang? Will he at least be able to bring **just fine** logi 4 guardian in fleet or there will be some complications to that too?
---
How long do you think it takes to figure out evertyhing you need to know about flying caps as opposed to training them to an entry level? 
---
An average person doesn't need 2 years of experience to grab the basics of every activity in Eve, but you sure as hell need 2 years of training queue to train some things even to **just fine** level 4 skills. This game is not that hard and never was.
---
At the Moment the Sotiyos in Perimeter are the best places to build your stuff in highsec that I know off. 
---
Cap component building is only feasable in places where actual caps will be built and used. Cap components are way too heavy to be moved around for more than from one citadel to another in the same system.
---
&gt;Capqu

also guard doesnt think out loud, he gets suggested things by pearl abyss and tests your reaction

Hahahah...this is amazing. Funny to read conspiracy theories about yourself. Capqu, I love you but you're seriously reading way too much into things.

They don't. Look up the main reasons for empire collapse:
---
1. Economic collapse (take a look at the MER, not happening soon). Unlimited supplies in ore and isk.
---
2. Succession crisis (Also unlikely)
---
3. Conquered by external enemies (hard if you are the biggest empire)
---
4. Inner rebellion (sadly this seems to be the most likely option)
---
5. So poorly managed that it will collapse on it's own. With API offering a lot of scalable options to manage your organisation without being handicapped by the game UI.

that'd be a real feat with only 10 csm seats
---
&gt;Like you cannot punish players for defending some area   
---
&gt;or attacking it
---
You can punish players for overdefending one region out of the 40 odd nullsec regions, by making resources more scarce, to spread out players and defenses, allowing smaller groups and alliances to hold null space and be relevant.
---
What if I only have 2?

abandon fighters in emergerncy

The issue is the 10 man group might as well stop playing and because most of those groups don't enjoy tidi fights kinda why there in smaller groups, to begin with, this leads to a cycle where only the large groups survive and everyone else is too bored to play eve.

All you need in faction warfare is t1 frigates, hurricane is a good ship in general but is infinitely more of a pain in the ass to replace than a couple dozen tristans. Also jumping straight into solo pvp in a battlecruiser is gonna be a bad time, keep it cheap and small to learn the ropes.

They aren't going to change how cynos work or how defense fleets / intel / supers work against small gangs.  Same way they aren't going to fix cloaky camping.  These are the rules that have been set and probably aren't going to be changed no matter how stupid or bad they are.  
---
The solution to killing the umbrellas is to force people out of small regions.  So diminishing returns on bounties or ore.  You've touched on this in the past and it has been discussed to death.  But it will most likely will not happen either.  
---
I like to think of it as setting them free.

Fuck. Gambling. Lootboxes can stay the fuck away from my internet spaceship Barbie simulator.
---
Nothing's stopping you from buying PLEX and spending the ISK on something a little more reasonable. Just because you can afford to fly a Nestor the price of a supercarrier around Tama doesn't mean that you should. That your only kill is a Griffin you suicide ganked in Jita seems to imply you aren't getting much out of it.
---
Why don't you try keeping the ISK and buying cheaper ships and having fun with those? Or find some friends and do small gang PvP or whatever? You can kill things in low-sec with a 2m frigate, expensive ships are useless if you're new to the game (or haven't been on EVE for over a decade) and don't know how to fly them that well yet
---

This is so bad, if you search for Low Sec or Faction Warfare nothing comes up.

Why should they cater to these 10 people vs the 300 that are happy to ruin their day and continue on enjoying their own?

The only thing that's changed is the method and who holds the balance of power, the rest is no different to when the game first started and we were all bubble fucking gates and camping pipe entrances.

I suspect right now the average not super space rich people are eating into their isk savings to buy their plex, but eventually their savings are going to start drying up and they will need to make that call, do i get plex or let this alt go alpha.
---
When that happens on mass the demand for plex is gona plummet, the solo player with 20 alts all running rorquals will be able to sustain their fleet longer but even they have a price in mind right now, and when plex hits that price they will also let their accounts slip into alpha.

Didn't more shit die in 2018 than any year before?.

It seems 'lots of fighting' actually translates to 'lots of easy kills'. Nerf caps for sure but the result is still the same its always been, the big will crush the small unless the small outwit the big.

Thats exactly what happened during 2018, not only that, also opposing factions banded together to have a common candidate, he ended up just behind Innominate &amp; Merkelchen with slightly lower votes.

Well, you can sort the anoms differently in order to get the desired order, so as long as all three are present in a system it would still work.

&gt; at least a dozen better ways for me to earn ISK
---
You were handed 100B no questions, you had a relationship with aza where which he would send you isk - no farming needed. What better ways are there to earn isk than to not earn it.
---
&gt; 27b in defaulted loans out of a total of 1.3 trillion isk lent.
---
This is exactly how IWI bankers were RMTing, a small % of total transactions; the bulk of which obfuscated the illicit activity. Every bit of reasoning you gave in the OP hurts your case.
---
Playing this the way you did makes you appear all the more guilty. You would have better luck keeping the discussion between you and CCP than opening the case for several hundred more persons to critique. It would appear reddit was not helpful in your case.

Inner Hell knows well how to break Umbrella protection with Lokis, in addition i have observed some lack of coordination in Umbrella fleet when there are more than one Rorqual tackled in different systems. IMO there is still place to improve in the mechanics of how to break umbrella protection

Sounds like plain bad luck. Sorry bro

"Duct tape" is usually used to say some combination of fix/attach, poor quality, DIY, cheap, fast. In this case it means "just slap it together". It is a fun slang to use in most English-speaking countries.
---
I think it's a big thing in America mostly because duct tape was invented in America.
---
Chances are you got this problem: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40784 or similar (spoiler it is not a bug)
---
There’s way more problems that come from having tethered carriers use fighters than from requiring basic knowledge of how carriers work to use them well. 
---
So you put two Rorquals next to each other and they make each other immune? A significant change indeed. 
---
There are lots of big newbie friendly corps around.  Karma, Brave, etc.  but remember if you're going into capital production, you're still having to compete with people who have sets of 10/20 blueprints, who've been in the game for a decade or more.  I think there's more profit in other things until your operation gets beyond a certain size.
---
cursed_rat
---
I was referring to the first sentence. Will edit to clarify.
---
whatever lmbo
---
It's not a bad thing, but the way it currently stands is bad. You should be free to defend one region with 15k people if you want, but that should have a serious impact on how much isk each of those 15k people can make compared to a region with much less people in.
---
It’s impossible to be tethered while near a gate. Sounds like your client was messing up

It's one of the best ships in the game. Incredibly flexible and can be flown from solo all the way to large fleets.
---
Personally I use a cheap solo fit which I fly with gangs as well. It's completely self reliant, has solid tank, point, and while the dps is low it's enough to kill stuff. zkill is down so I can't link fit, but you can go through my losses to find it (Dato Koppla)
---
I often use it when someone brings a ridiculous active tank ship (cap battery HACs/T3S, active battleships). I also use it to counter recon traps (when someone sits in a medium FW plex with their own recon) since they also can't see you on the outside. Although what I use it for most is killing DED runners in combination with my alt in a Lachesis for initial point. Occasionally I go out solo in it, although I'm not a huge fan of it solo since it doesn't have the speed to catch smaller things and pretty much everything will run from you since nothing much can take on a Curse alone.

Olmeca Gold pushes the game  mechanics right to the edge and then makes ISK optimizing that mechanic. He adds a lot to the game play outside of the Null Sec Sov play/market PvP/FW/High L4s.

Nope, Rorqual panic is applying to subcapital mining ships around it but not the rorquals.

Well yes, but also you cannot change it easily due to broken mining and current moon mining.

So lets assume constellation with 300 moons ... whatever CCP do - you can spawn 300 "better than colossal" belts in it over a month.

I think I asked the question because I have played this game since 2006 (with a big break between 2012 and 2018), and I had just never heard this discussed, and now in the age of ship skins the artistic distinctiveness of the pirate faction ships that are based on empire faction ships has been minimized.

 time to try station trading again only to get burned out after a week or two and make an abysmal amount of profit with dreams of making billions per month on it
---
have ya'll seen the 1dq keepstar grids? this is the lengths we have to go to. it took a literal invasion of the north, acquiring a swathe of faction fortizars, all so I can keep my +2 implant clone separate from my +3 implant clones and my +1 implant clones and my titan pod.
---
* Flip middle finger at botters that now require you to do this. 
---
botters laugh all the way to the bank.  
---
Implement a similar system to the industry index, where the more mining occurs in a system or constellation, the lower the amounts of ore that spawns until it has recovered?
---
But it's really a discussion for another thread tbh. I think we have the same views broadly speaking however.
---
Nope. Galmil moved to null because fw had become stale (partly as a result of citadel spam). Calmil took the wz in our absence, and then we came back after cashing out LP and retook it. We removed an assload of their structures and then they died in the ass. Even when we were retaking the wz citadels made home system pushes a joke. I actually don’t recall a system that didn’t have a citadel, neutral or otherwise, for us to dock in. 
---
Uhh how do you farm a specific character? I don’t choose opponents based on their fucking name LOL
---
You mean ESS?
---
And yes, putting an ESS in every system that could be reinforced would be a boon to both hunting and nerfing bots.  
---
If the ESS is active bounties are normal. 
---
If the ESS is reinforced, bounties are cut in half. 
---
Give it a three hour repair or something. 
---
Just like with everything else in life.
---
There were two FW candidates this election. They both did exactly what you said. We just don’t have the numbers to get a dude in the csm. 
---
It's amazing. You exactly zero grasp on how any of this works.
---
So, you're saying there's a chance
---
An open letter to /u/Razzy_FAIL
---
Stop posting.
---
So that's how you get to Spoopy space!
---
I can't remember this far back - were ceptors always nullified? If not, why not roll them back to that stage? 
---
This is the way you take out your flustrations. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Anyone can paint. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.
---
It all happens automatically. We can fix anything. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.
---
So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. There we are. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.
---
Only eight colors that you need. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Little short strokes. Just beat the devil out of it. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.
---
Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.
---
I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
---
Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. This is unplanned it really just happens.
---
Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.
---
Be brave. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.
---
A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.
---
Clone courier contracts would be nice
---
If ceptors get a speed buff and an ADC i'm actually quitting lol
---
This was in poor taste. 
---
Its never good to joke about someones mental health however you perceive it. I hope the mods nuke this post
---
But if we move the Client Workload of thousands of clients to the Server, doesn't this reduce the Workload on the Server and therefore reduce TiDi?
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I used to be biased like you a few years back. Then I found a place I could fit in when an old corpmate saw I went active again, and now here I am, an ex wormholer in null actually having a good time. Look around and find a place you can fit in, and if you can't then make this place yourself. I have to admit though, you are in a more limited situation than I was.
---
Needs more red purples
---
Ah, I guess that is a good point, new PLEX sellers probably enter the market place as the prices goes up.
---
Hello Friend.
---
Please take this to the small questions thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b103qz/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_march_14/
---
no u
---
Oh no, I love having dozens of characters trained into Contracting and Corporate Contracting that can't (fully) manipulate other characters' contracts.
---
Someone did calculate it out to be 1 in 6.4 septillion for this to spawn.
---
You got some weird issues. Ticket closed.
---
So I'm studying fw and it appears I'll need to dissolve my corporation, or enlist it with a wait period, and cancel my market activities in hostile territory and bring everything home. It's also going to make moving goods and raw materials around to the higher paying markets problematic. I can't have multiple character training queues either. So it seems it would be best to create a completely new account dedicated to fw and let its skills ripen for a week or two. I've invested heavily in skill sets that would apparently be essentially rendered moot if I join fw. Am I missing something?
---
Well, on mobile it's down and to the right, so the instructions in the title work in a way.
---
Own most of the CSM spots and post “who cares”. Exactly why we dont need a CSM.
---
Blatant Goon troll. 
---
How about we make it so anoms have to be scanned down, and there are a fixed number of them in the constellation based on true sec status?
---
We've been there.  The bots will just belt rat.
---
Cant mods force change everyones flair to the same just to troll this guy some more?
---
Nothing.
---
I understand what you were going for with noting that volume is still high even at the higher price point, but there are definitely people being priced out of eve. It hasn't happened to me yet, but its gonna happen here soon. 
---
If your happy to swipe a credit card go for it, this sub has a habit of going super negative the only important thing is did you have fun?               
---
             
---
That being said there are probably more efficient options if you wanted to go for more fun/swipe.             
---
          
---
Best of luck with your space adventure.
---
love you Gump 《3

I would be all for going back to belt ratting if it stopped these stupid ass posts.

&gt; Silver Suspiria
---
Who?
---
they were not always nullified, but back in those days they went significantly faster than they do now
---
Thank got you got here before I did. 
---
To clarify what others have commented on, each eve account allows for 3 characters, so people either use a different character or a whole different account for a specific  purposes, i.e. mining, scanning alts, capital ship pilot, links alt etc...
---
You can not be logged into an alpha account and an Omega account simultaneously from the same PC without breaking the EULA. 
---
Nobody cares, in many ways we're similar. it's kind of like a random goon line member who nobody's heard of outside of reddit post having an opinion. So I'm glad you can empathize. 
---
Multiple CSM's are in the CSM Minutes thread explaining that they A: do talk about FW and just B: don't in the minutes because it's a meeting about CCP's current agenda which FW is not on. CSM doesn't pick the agenda.
---
If anything blaming CSM for FW being bad gives CCP a convenient reason to ignore FW. Pressure who it matters.
---
A shower thought I had was offering old skins for ludicrous ISK prices (10b) to maybe drain some ISK from the game. 
---
That's the busiest time in EVE so if people are willing to let go of EVE for a second, there's a possibility that a lot of people will show up.
---
So we've surpassed WoW now? 
---
Glass half full kind of guy right here.
---
Yeah, was about to say, i've seen this at least 2 other times in the past few weeks.
---
"hey if you got a lot of spare money, you should really buy some plex and hold them for few weeks since the price keep rising anyway"
---
It's what this kind of post say, crying about it does not make it fix, CCP are aware of the issue let's just hope they work on it, sadly a lot of people invested in this market and soon as the price fall, they will all firesale instantly 
---
The thing is, it negates the politics of small groups having to be blue with alliances like snuff and siege green etc... Also it would just be like people doing wardecs only a perma war without pirates or mercs interfering. 
---
Remember when PLEX used to be like 350m apiece? Pepperidge Farm remembers...
---
Man, I'm already bored of these plex-price memes. 
---
Have you tried reading our holy subreddit once in a while? 
---
lol
---
Its always funny when one tries to insult someone and reveals they themselves are the clueless one.
---
I'm too, but 50kk for one day, it is too dad(
---
I would argue that Faction Warfare is a shitty bit of gameplay that should have never been added to the game and its a waste of time and development resources for CCP to spend anymore effort on it. But thats just me.
---
&gt; No botting/cheating with a client in a cloud. 
---
This doesn't stop botting or cheating.
---
&gt; No td, because all the calculations are made locally and the result is streamed to players.
---
FFXIV does this. FFXIV has notorious time delay.
---
&gt; What if we did something radical, what if we made drones act more like Fighters
---
Its like you've never seen a botting super.
---
&gt; Basically the same reason botters done run 20 carriers at once
---
But they do, they run the Hel and Nyx all over the map.
---
&gt; the amount of inputs needed, and rechecking involved is astronomical when you have more then a couple clients
---
Trivial for a bot.
---
&gt; So what we will have now are Drones that are basically useless if you dont tell them what to do.
---
Literally just kneecapping the little guy into mind numbing PVE.
---
&gt; If you all remember what happened to carriers when they first went to fighters, AFK carrier ratting went away INSTANTLY.
---
And came back a week later.
---
&gt; Botters will be nearly useless, since there are so many anomalies
---
You obviously have no understanding of bots.
---
&gt; Pvpers will have more control over their drones
---
And less over their ship, congrats, you did nothing but fuck actual people over.
---
It's hard to top retarded post of the week when Olmeca is out on the loose but kudos to you for achieving such a feat.
---
Just some advice, just join Pandemic Horde or something and fly frigates and cruisers until you are good. 
---
The money you spent on that nestor could have been so better spent. 
---
If you wanna credit card warrior thats cool, but imo you arent going about it well.
---
Good luck in the future though, your going out and PvPing so thats a step above a lot of players.
---
Idk if my character has a soul to bound an injector too...
---
Thoughts on reverting back to that? 
---
I want retired skins, and that makes me a paid shill? I don't get it. 
---
*How low can you go? How long can you go?*
---
Not really if we look by the killmail ids on zkill we get the following results: 
---
2018: 74332952 - 66976266 = 7356686
---
2016: 58764592 - 51068075 = 7696517
---
2014: 43517156 - 35611170 = 7905986
---
This is based on the oldest and newest kill in the zkill historic api, now keep in mind more items generate kill mails today then did in 2016 and yet we don't match the number of 2016 or 2014. 
---
How can I downvote this more than once?
---
Huh thought it would be the same as serpentis 
---
I tried to sign up yesterday, but it's closed. Gonna be interesting to see if they got their 10000 players without multiboxing.

I'll laugh when the day comes where plex crashes and we have a "Great Depression" scenario happen
---
Yes much more, thank you. I think I just got hung up on the wording but that clarifies a lot. Great post thanks for the insight

do you try this hard to be wrong on every subject?
---
Plex in another “increases value” shocker. 
---

Take me to the moon baby!!

how dare someone not know about the status of some space paper pusher extraordinaire
---
Nice one, ty
---
The doctor ordered up more rorqual alts...
---
 It involves weapon's biometric data, salarian intelligence, and a hanar prostitute with camera implants. 
---
So if smaller is better then 0 isk spent on implants for 0 added m/s is the best option.
---
You used to be able to buy 60 day GTC for 350 mil. 
---
It's apparently a more difficult thing than we all think, because I've been harassing Guard almost weekly about this for a year. 
---
Just this [skin](https://i.imgur.com/Mc0Q6LU.jpg) for my Rattlesnake.
---
Also, a covert ops sabre would be dope af.
---
That’s because its not your gameplay, which is why you don’t care about it. CCP also puts null gameplay above others. They advertise big fights and thousands of players brawling it out. Yet when eve was at its finest, 70% of their players base didn’t live in null. This goes to show you majority of eve players don’t care about null nor the tidi fight. 
---
FW, wH (when they came out), LS piracy, and HS mission running, wardecs, incursions, ect held majority of the eve player base than null. Now, a certain group of people (CSM) rounded the null noobies up. Voted their way in csm (how does alt effect this vote?). Meta gamed the dev to mold the actual mechanics of eve to cater to their gameplay. This was done by nerfing lvl V missions, nerfing WH income, nerfing WH spawns in null along with nerfing size of WH. Nerfing lvl 4 missions in HS, plex price increases while staying stagnant in mission reward payouts, buff to capitals, rorq mining (behind skill injectors as dumbest shit eve introduced to eve), spawing 10/10 from havens and scantums, repawning null anomalies (ore anoms vs mining in a belt), ect. Anyway the list goes on. So yeah, CSM is suppose to be good yet it used as a political tool to meta game the fuck out of eve.  It doesn’t represent the player base as intended. Which is why the OP missile topic was never brought up. They don’t care, they are too busy meta gaming. That makes it extremely bias and broken. So yeah, we don’t need CSM. FW along with LS needs some dev love. I would elect CCP rise to unfuck the fuckery. Simply because he is level headed and a ex Eve player 
---
They all cost about 40b - 20-30x the cost of a normal cap.
---
Trig BS costs about 3-4x cost of a normal BS, if same ratio is given to trig dread then yeah totally people would fly em a lot.
---
Some dude posting on some alts to justify a RMT move :P 
---
I call dibs on bottom
---
Because a skin is a cosmetic item, not a ship. 
---
People make investments into things they think will retain value. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's the risk everybody takes by playing the market. 
---
&gt;0 isk spent on implants for 0 added m/s
---
pls make this Meta, I'm poor.
---
You can use locator agents to determine if and where a player is online.
---
This wouldn't cause spreading. This would cause locusting. Why spread over a larger surface area when you can just move the suction area, umbrella and all?
---
Ffs don’t be a poor just fly high grades 
---
Is just a suggestion. But it's obvious that something needs to be changed to cause the nullsec population to spread out.
---
Holy shit look how small of an isk sink asset safety is. That needs to change surely
---
Then one of them is gona get awoxed by the other, duh 
---
In the age of skill injectors, no amount of "skill barrier" modification matters.   
---
Im almost to the point of saying "get rid of all skills..."  Max everything out, and focus on PVP PVE and Industry mechanics.  
---
So no SortDragon... "More skills for XYZ" is not the answer to anything.
---
For sure,    I was just harassing highsec carebears,  "negotiating surrenders"   and such.    
---
But I do thi k theres alot ot good gameplay in war decs,    I just think that mass war decking all of eve is a little un realistic,  and broken mechanics.    
---
I'm all for groups like pirat or marmites tossing out war decs,   and they still could.     They would just have to pick and choose who they dec a little more carefully.   
---
I dont think I said "all your kill is new players"   or "you make players leave the game"     what I said is IF that happens (and it does,  that's not all you do, but it does happen)   that makes everyone's eve a little smaller,  and a little less.   
---
And yes,  when we go to war,  and were actually looking to impact the people were fighting....  getting a spai in there is priority 1.  
---
But yeah,   I have had the endless locator agents and "fun" or burning alts to check if there online,  only to have them log...  
---
And the ball really really isnt in my court,   we doesn't have new players.    I just want to see eve go for another decade,   and to do that we all need new blood.   So anything that's driving them away needs to be looked at long and hard   
---
If by drastically increasing the cost makes even 10% of the ones that leave decide to instead stay,  it's worth it to me. 
---
Derelik and khanid  already is accessible to fw all I'm asking for is events/plexes that have no affect on locals.
---
Currently most of fw isnt faction vs faction, it's pirates vs factions.
---
Without citadels, without pirates and caps, ther could be meaningful fw that has no affect on locals who are mining and doing stuff. 
---
Exactally.
---
I like highsec war decs,  I just want to see them be "meaningful pvp"   not "cast a net and see what we catch"
---
Been getting into F1 racing so I have been on that subreddit lately.
---
Triple msb(or lsb?) all nos in the highs.
---
You've got to think about the wider ecosystem of this though.
---
If _everyone_ played the game the way you do, do you really think we'd have the alliances/corps/wars/etc that you enjoy? Because these changes make things incredibly difficult for the agitators that make things happen and people willing to do it are starting to get really thin on the ground.
---
it will go 5m per one
---
How to kill Mach smartbomb gate campers? Any ideas?
---
I don't think they're useless I just think they're not an accurate representation of the player base because they're not really in touch with the people. The people are in touch with them, but in a way that doesn't really matter.
---
Ideally their should be a game discord made by ccp, with csm, then below the csm committees that everyone can join to bring specific issues to our representatives that don't just get waved off as the opinions of one player. 
---
[WTF](https://media.giphy.com/media/aZ3LDBs1ExsE8/giphy.gif) am I reading here.
---
what  is fastest ship u can have in game with hg snakes,hawirings  and speed boosters?  afaik u cant put 50mn mwd on any of t1/t2/faction frigs 
---
Pull fighters just as you are landing then abandon in your landing invuln.
---
Naaah that sounds about right. A second character trained into frigates &amp; destroyers would work just fine especially if you've invested in market and mining related skills. It's also important to note that the market blocking in hostile space strictly only applies to NPC stations, you can be in gallente militia and do as much trading in citadels in caldari space as you want.
---
Granted I was omega when I did it way back in 2015, but I essentially had a combat character in militia and then a npc corp character in an interceptor for moving stuff from LP stores to market (mainly VNI BPCs as you can fit an almost infinite amount of them into an interceptor). Buy BPCs for LP, take BPC to Jita, buy minerals off the market, manufacture in Jita and sell immediately to sell orders. There's probably more profitable ways to go about it, but it made me my first couple billion.
---
There's a few. I was pretty happy going up to about 1.3bn to get 18.45% boost by mixing HG and MG.
---
On the cheaper side, the 11.5% for 510m is pretty good. Low grades aren't used much, but the benefit is pretty neat for not too crazy price.
---
Or to completely ruin NN-606 market, the 330m combo of NN-905+LG A/B/G/D to get 8.5% boost. 300-400m isk cheaper...
---
i had a 50mn eris, was pretty fast.
---
The dream. Like i want to have Revenant ... but how i can steal from Sansha or support terrorists who do?
---
Body odor, Doritos, desperation, and alcohol
---
Well it destroys the whole idea about moon mining ... also is against logic (what piece of a moon cares about what is happening to a moon in the same system or one next door).       
---
The sweet spot is in your wallet. Sort it by isk/m/s and look at the best one for your max budget. But tbh the only thing you can see is that plain full mg is still good for its price and that no funky but significantly cheaper set comes close to a full high grade one. Overall the more isk you spend on high grades the better it is with only minor deviations
---
Like I've already said, it's just one suggestion, the main thing is agreeing on what the issues are.
---
or why you cannot bomb 4-4 undock and die to concord? or why your crew decides to disable warp drive and wait for death from Concord - rather than warping off.          
---
I know that EVE is full of tis stuff.  
---
Simply - people need to mine those moons if we want to have T2 stuff. 
---
Someone mentioned earlier that eve has a toxic reddit where people just talk smack about anything that doesn't align with their game play.
---
But your actual statement is "who cares" but who cares is referring about what?  an aspect of the game that has lost significant numbers and is described by the people who play it as low in content, high reward and low risk, bottling problem.
---
As for insulting, you said "who cares" which is the same as saying your opinions are invalid to me because I have some sort of moral superiority. You don't were all equal. 
---
Then you call someone clueless in a subject you have not contributed anything too and I'd wager you're not a fw veteran either, so wouldn't the word clueless better apply to someone who doesn't engage in fw, doesn't suggest ideas about fw, and has nothing to say about the aubject. Sooo yeah. If you want to have meaningful dialogue great, if not go back to your smack talk and belittling other playstyles. 
---
I think a 50mn golden magnate is probably the fastest
---
That's fine, but they don't all have to mine it in the same system :D
---
Thanks :D
---
On the CSM, nobody that doesn't share your play style is going to properly represent your play style. They'll bring up a few talking points here and there, maybe, if you e-mail them those talking points. But they won't be able to speak with true understanding.
---
Both on and off the CSM, when I've seen CSM members speaking, if there's an expert on topic X on the CSM, 19 times out of 20 the other members of the CSM will not only defer to that person to speak on that topic. The devs will also pay much more attention to that person.
---
There have been past CSMs where an expert on a given topic fed a series of talking points and bullets to a CSM member, who then carried those talking points to the Summits. But in every one of those cases that I'm aware of, that person then joined a later CSM and was much more effective when they could deliver that message themselves.
---
You don't see the null-sec guys feeding their desires through an uninvolved CSM member.
---
holy six low slots batman
---
Make it so you can cyno on and in a fw plex
---
If your carrier isnt hyper and ascendancy, its quite possible. In a small system even quite easy.
---
Trimark Thanatos or Nyx even easier.
---
Vegas. The smell of Vegas. 
---
You play 99% solo and be in a corporation or big bloc. No problem.
---
1.  0.005% might be a bit much.... considering that would be abused to hell with LP prices.   imagine if goon and horde joined sides, and then tried to brawl. would devalue the LP greatly...
---
2. true....they need variety of missions.
---
3. sounds like it should be obvious.....not sure why CCP hasnt done that...
---
4. so similar to incursions?   eh i'd be for trying this.
---
5. w8 1b in a day?  what. explain.
---
6. eh the size isn't the issue,  the issue is the lack fo activity on the front lines. which considering Calmil is....more or less dead.  and Galmil is looking to nullsec.  is more a symptom than a cause.
---
well new CSM elections coming up.  lets find a candidate
---
fuk, the bread line, I'm waiting in the plex line!!!
---
Who cares about FW that is in **Lowsec** when it lacks something as simple as gate to **Stain** ?
---
&gt; For sure, I was just harassing highsec carebears, "negotiating surrenders" and such.
---
See I totally agree with you because for me playing Eve Online is about me telling a story or narrative. Interacting with others in both negative and positive ways that has it where I've left an impact on a player, group, or even the entire game. When I was first starting the "dark" side of Eve Online I kept a small blog mostly to show to my friends. It was the stories of theft, ransoms, and piracy that drew me into the game and I wanted to give back to the community in the same way. If a single person read my blog about the stuff I've done in Eve Online and decided to sub, then I considered it a good thing.
---
&gt; But I do thi k theres alot ot good gameplay in war decs, I just think that mass war decking all of eve is a little un realistic, and broken mechanics.
---
I'm all for groups like pirat or marmites tossing out war decs, and they still could. They would just have to pick and choose who they dec a little more carefully.
---
See I don't think you need to artificially limit that because there are consequences and reactions to everything. Yes, that includes biting off more than you can chew. So after all these changes we'll find that the biggest and strongest groups will be more than capable of destroying a WarHQ, ending the war, and having a 2 week breather from that group.
---
If groups like Pirat and Marmite decide to keep all of Eve Online under wardec, then we just increased the likelyhood that these groups will come together and burn our house down.
---
There's already been internal discussions on how we're going to handle the changes while trying to maintain the level of content and activity that we like and desire. We'll see how we adapt and change as things unfold in the next few months. It will be fun!
---
&gt; I dont think I said "all your kill is new players" or "you make players leave the game" what I said is IF that happens (and it does, that's not all you do, but it does happen) that makes everyone's eve a little smaller, and a little less.
---
Without a doubt dude and I completely agree with you. I wish Eve Online had active subscriptions in the millions (maybe I don't with how bad the servers would shit themselves) because ultimately it's more people to shoot at, more people to be friends with, and more people carving out their narratives in Eve Online and making it a great place to be.
---
What worries me is that the community tends to point fingers and solely focus on things that either stand out the most (obviously) or are easy to demonize because they fundamentally don't agree with them. I feel like wardecs and ganking are at the forefront of the finger pointing because they tend to have a side that is a winner or a loser. Fundamentally people hate losing, and either desire to see the game change where they aren't as much of a loser or want to see it changed so much that there are actually no losers.
---
The #1 problem is that with wars in Highsec is that the people that tend to be around, organized, and knowledgeable enough to use game mechanics in their favor is the side of the aggressor. There aren't enough PVP groups in Highsec, but we are starting to see that change with the new budding market hubs and such. Various groups are starting to place a stake in Highsec and see the potential for both fun and profit.
---
What I believe is the biggest point of contention is that there are mechanics that exist in Nullsec, Lowsec, and Wormholes that make harder to just disengage and avoid fighting all together. That's why we already read about the "pussy ass bitch highsec wardec groups that just dock up when we bring a fleet".
---
I could go on and on about fundamental issues with the game, its players, and the different areas of space but I'd type till my fingers fell off. The point is that structures are now here for the largest and dumbest players to throw numbers at because they don't like how PVP has traditionally been done in Highsec.
---
&gt; And the ball really really isnt in my court, we doesn't have new players. I just want to see eve go for another decade, and to do that we all need new blood. So anything that's driving them away needs to be looked at long and hard
---
I didn't mean to imply that the ball was in YOUR court, but the statement was aimed at the large groups of people that recruit new players. The truth is that now with war immunity there ought to be no "think of the children" arguments.
---
same thing happened with bitcoin, $10k hype train up to $20k, followed by panic sales down to $3k.  Slightly different scenario, because you can actually use plex for something
---
Another thing to keep in mind if you're buying MG snakes is that a Geno pod with a lg/mg snake in slot 5 and nn-605 is actually very similar in terms of speed gain to a full mg snake set. On cruiser and bc hulls the speed difference is often just 1-200m/s, and you gain agility, cap and fitting.

I believe tonight half an hour before the test it is supposed to open again AFAIK... go check the website.

"Before I quit (about 1.5 years ago)" Were they able to reactivate your old toon/account or did you have to start all over?

Most people don’t lose $700 worth of ISK at all in general, especially within their first month. I predict you will make bigger mistakes because it seems like you have a good capacity to do so. No shame in being an ISK sink, we need more after all
---
I disagree with everything but wont give reason why or post an alternative!

Are the fortification units Abyss stuff?

Missions would be ok if they were in any way risky. Fix LP stores.

You only loose SP if you fly a cruiser t3, so dont worry because alpha cant fly t3

Skill injectors are CCP's major cash cow now. What a pee brain you have to suggest they should kill it.

If anything they need to add more skills to milk you guys some more. x3

If they provided content I agree. Right now they are farmed to hell with stabbed jackdaws, vni, ishtars, etc. If the site warp disrupted you for 60 secs upon landing or something, that would be great. Provide incentive to be active in mission systems, but they currently water down LP for the people actually being involved in the war. 
---
fit?
---
You docked up and then warped? Please take the time to accurately describe your problem if you want help. Probably best for you to try uninstalling eve and don’t reinstall it ever.

Aye that’s what I mean, there’s no risk involved for the mission runners - if they could be scanned out (with no acceleration gate) or something then maybe, it’s a tricky one though.

KK thanks! I've been gone since late 2015 early 2016 so since you were gone longer I should be ok. Can't do it right away but plan to come back later this year, early next.
---
Yeah..I feel you...surely going to lose some ships because I don't remember my "finger-fu" for blasting through gate camps in null. I had gotten to the point where muscle memory was so good I could cruise through without thinking.

Spent my 1.2 trill on plex before going inactive which I made from rorq mining since last year. Since CCP is doing fuckall about the botters I figure I spend the rest of my isk on plex when heading out. I know a bunch of other people who are hoarding plex as well.
---
I guess one way to fuck botters is hoarding plex right? I know it fucks with the rest of the peasants out here who survive off plex but you are just collateral damage to CCP in order to have them do something about the bots.

I have my own personal issues with the new structures..   ie...  there garbage all around.    Bring back pos's!  Ccplease!
---
It's just a lackluster mechanic that is far far too easy to game.   
---
And I'm confident that the big war dec groups could still toss out war decs,  it would just be less oppressive, and they would have to be more selective.   Ie...   only decking groups they get paid to,  there pissed at,  that actually feed well,   there able to get spais in ect..
---
It would just make it so that keeping up a war dec on some random nobody's in provi that have 20 members for 2 months wouldn't be worthwhile.
---
Which would in turn let the guys grow,   get complacent,   and likely would actually feed more when they do catch the war dec.   
---
I am against killing high sec war decs.     But I am all for makeing it less oppressive for new guys.
---
Never said you didn't. Reading comprehension is hard.
---
Just started another character for fw. I do a lot of transport and market related activities in my main character and have to be on guard for regular high-sec gankers. A market strategy I am presently investing in effectively moots certain otherwise unavoidable market cost in a backwards sort of way but requires consistent travel pattern with a high number of open sale orders. For mining related stuff the low-sec border zone markets are particularly important, many with long route sections where there are no alternative routes. I also have access to low-sec moon mining in enemy territory that would be problematic in fw. Mixing risk associated with transport with those imposed by fw is just unreasonably problematic. And I'm already heavily invested in the former in skill and resources. More so than what an alpha account can really use but I need to gain an advantage in omega skills as quickly as possible once it becomes available. So yeah, I'm going with another account for fw.
---
well memed, friend
---
Here we are again.
---
No ISK was sunk here. On the contrary, insurance created more ISK out of thin air.
---
(The ISK he bought everything with changed hands to the various sellers of ship and mods.  It did not leave the game)
---
cool
---
With all the recent talk of plex prices I wondered if the supply was just not there driving prices up. But if you look at the history on the market it looks close to level going back quite a while.
---
Awesome
---
Loving the improvements for fw and wh space!! Great job!
---
1, ccp is removing it 
---
2, somone is buying it "ie" goons or test
---
3, RMT sites am buying to set the price of it
---
l would go with 2 but that is me
---
Yes sir it does! In fact I came up with a simple a equation for myself. 
---
baseHP * 4x = totalHP / (dps* 1.20) if not at limit / 60 = totalTime 
---
Used in an example: 1,200,000hp * 4 = 4,800,000hp / 5000dps = 960s/ 60s = 16 minutes 
---
The above example is at damage cap presuming you’re at 6000 raw dps because of the 20% resists to incoming damage.

&gt;lex LP gets cut in half across the board. Why can I used a 2mil SP character in a venture and make 1bil isk in a day? I have done it so do not think I am innocent, but I'd gladly give it up to ge
---
 1. Good point, maybe a bump down a little. This idea would increase pvp vice farming though, numbers may need work.
---
5. too easy.... shit fit catalyst can run medium sites... t4 min/gal you will get 62.5k lp per site at 20mins, lets just round up to 30 for travel sake. We will use 1k isk/lp (more can be had if you use get the right items and play it smart). so 62.5k\*1k\*2(per hour) is 125mil an hour in a 4mil catalyst. 8 hours you can be sitting on a Billion... If you say well I only play 4 hours a week. Your alt on a second screen can still make you 500mil a week causal as heck.   
---
Thank you for the input! Like hearing everyone's ideas
---
Isn't purple common items?
---
^^(/s)
---
heh, just to clear out the buy orders is going to take some serious unloading.  there is strong support all the way down to 3.9.  
---
There hasn't been a large volume of sales, as opposed to any other time. Volume has stayed relatively the same for the previous 2 months.   
---
People aren't buying plex and seeding the market. 
---
Max ISK payout was 138m. 5b worth of mods was destroyed. 
---
Yep, we will never see plex go to 3.5 again, even with sales. 
---
probably true, but being a cynic is a full time job
---
Most of them aren't worth their current pricing, let alone more.
---
those damn goons or test always here to fucked up the game grrrrr
---
I think its funny that the battery references everything in his life as a rising charge, and when he isn't charged eve is dead. That's not how like economics works at all bro. The price of plex is not attached to subcount. Sure, neither of us can prove this totally but I don't think you thought this one through.

We have a CSM discord. 
---
Ah, not quite. the words can be in any order, you just have to navigate to a point in space where the distances sort them correctly.
---
Does shit count?
---
Really dumb that so many people downvoted this. Yes, it has been tried before. Obviously FW groups haven't had the votes to overcome null bloc voting, but some kind of organized campaign could only help raise visibility.  CCP clearly responds more to the issues raised by larger blocs of players with high publicity.    
---
The CSM is a political body, when your candidate loses a political campaign you don't quit organizing, you organize harder in the future.
---
“It would have worked fine but for some reason we didn’t get enough players” 
---
Not surprising. I felt like PLEX prices were being artificially held down by repeated sales for a long while. Now that there are no more sales PLEX is sure to keep rising. The fact that so many depend on PLEX to multi-account in a meta where multi-accounting is extremely heavily encouraged exacerbates this.
---
for perspective, a 2005 interceptor could be made to go about 25km/s - and that's without overheating

there are many, many ways that could be exploited

And you think people wouldnt plex out ships instead of grinding them? thats where Injector money would go.

Yeah but who cares

That's one of the 3 special edition versions, not the normal ore hold version. Not sure why that one got changed and not the two Quafe versions, though. Or any the special edition ones don't have an ore hold, for that matter.

Is your plan to buy plex?   
---
60bil ISK isn't very much.

Time to cash out the Plex I bought at 700M, suckazzzz
---
Inflation, here we come! 
---
CSM leaks?
---
you don't need the - tho, only 3 letters is enough
---
I feel like there's so many decent criticisms of FW out there and you've managed to describe virtually none of them.
---
Anyway, FW isn't dying, its dead.  It doesn't need a crash cart and some saline, it needs a thick casket, some kind words of remembrance softly uttered by templar dane, and the skilled mining tools of nullbears to cover the shallow grave with dirt and stones so that it rests peacefully.
---
Maybe it could have been revitalized a few years ago but at this point all major FW groups have withered to almost nothing (RIP CTRLV), disintegrated entirely, or worse, _adapted and overcome_ by leaving their respective warzones and joining super high skill risk averse blobs (where is nate altol anyway?).  
---
&gt;Today I used this orange scented soap...
---
&gt;Just sniffing my hands now makes me want to play even more!
---
Don’t do bath salts, kids. It’s a gateway drug to EVE.
---
Idea addition! Make it so there oy fw soecific ships u can only fly if you are enlisted! 
---
Dude. Do you even Overview?
---
I threw $40 yesterday, sold them for 4.1 each. Figured I'd cash in before there is a PLEX sale.
---
Ah shit that’s nuts. Maybe tone that down then haha
---
Wine and cheese.
---
I would rather throw whatever liquid isk you have  and buy PLEX and watch the inflation grow.
---
60b can get me a fit titan and more faxes, or I can fly subcaps until the end of days. For me personally I don't have the time to krab anymore, so given the high price of plex it's very appealing to just use some of my yearly bonus to make up for the difference. $500 is 62.8b plex right now, looking at Jita buy.
---
1 is cool
---
2 need something, missions are honestly not bad
---
3 just no

4 great good lets do it

I'm asset heavy, liquid isk poor. Titan, rorquals, supers, tons of faxes/dreads. The market is really shit for liquidating atm - I already looked at that.

*phone rings*

He bought?
---
CCP reads Reddit like [this](http://i.imgur.com/7rwSpeH.gif)
---
Would it be the sum he calculated exponent 3, then? I'm not good enough at math to calculate this.
---
there would need to be a fundamental change to push the prices down.  At the very least there would need to be a better place to park your isk.  possible fixes:
---
1) drive a wedge between extracting and plex prices so that plexing skill farms isn't worthwhile. 
---
2) dump a ton of plex on the market to soak up the isk.  would be good for the game, but bad for ccp so i don't see why they would do ti. 
---
3) Fix the price of plex.  This might be the best option, though it would be a pretty heavy handed approach.  
---
also, I don't think thats a bot, not nearly enough orders and they are temporally spaced too far apart.  
---
Not being EU prime doesn't help either.
---
The most interesting thing in this article, to me, was the discussion about how they will migrate people to the new infrastructure. 
---
New space? Trickling in or a mass migration? That sounds like a ton of chaos that could be *awesome*. I'm all for hitting the reset button.
---
Sub count is a major part of the supply and demand curve. Yes i thought this through.
---
I'm glad this whole bullshit will create a big shitstorm mostly caused by injectors and the ease of isk farm in NS.
---
It kind of looks like an electric razor, maybe they're fixing it up to do some cross-marketing with Gillette?
---
Cynicism is a feature not a bug, its 2019 and it definately will catch more bullshit than not having it.
---
Just like we all already know that banning mission running on alpha accounts had very little todo with bots and more to do with forcing said botters to buy omega/plex on balance sheet, so that ccp can get performance payouts from pearl abyss. 
---
MCTC are dead for skill farms. Skill farms outside of 1 per account with other passive income to make up the remainder are all that are left. It's a loss right now to skill farm on MCTC with them at 485 over 450.
---
loot crates for plex incoming
---
I mean honestly I've been playing this game for like 5-6 years, and I love it to death. I've tried playing other games and they just don't compare to the feeling of playing EVE. As a result I don't mind paying for my subs or dropping money on sales because I feel I'm getting the entertainment value out of it.
---
For comparison I don't even bother with a battle pass for $other_fps_of_the_month.
---
End skillfarming
---
I am under the impression it will be the ‘super node’ for reinforced nodes for large fights.
---
when kinetic itself is kinetic locked
---
And that’s how they get you
---
back in that era a lot of people were flying vagabonds with 2 stabs (no targeting penalty on stabs until like 2009) with hg snakes going 12k, that and nanophoons that went 6k. turns out if you can get a ship going that fast there's very little that can apply any damage to you
---
That's not how you spell 'avatar'
---
When where you in my house?
---
Yep. Trend changes in supply going back to at least 2016 are fairly small. Especially when compared to price changes.
---
1) Earning LP from kills this way was implemented in the past, but was immediately exploited with market manipulation.
---
2) Totally fine with this.  
---
3) Probably too strong of a nerf to non FW people. FW entities should definitely get structure bonuses tied to system ownership / system upgrade level.  
---
4) As a FW cap pilot, I don't think this would be good. Groups like Snuff can blob with subcaps as well as caps / supers. Long term, this will simply accelerate existing pressure on high SP vet pilots to leave FW and join pirate / null groups. Small gang pvp is obviously the core content for most FW pilots, but many of us also like large fleet engagements and the opportunity to use caps vs similar strength groups.  These opportunities are rare in FW, but when they do happen it can be some of the most fun in EVE.  This proposal would destroy that content.  
---
5) Just ban ventures from entering FW plex.  CCP could easily do this.  The issue was brought to their attention before the change preventing warp core stabs from taking gates, but they said "we don't think it will be an issue."  Now its an issue, as everyone said it would be.  Time to ban them.  
---
6) I'm not super opposed to reducing Gal/Cal FW space, but I don't think it is a priority issue.  
---
What FW really lacks is a good "comeback" mechanic for the underdog faction. That's always been the core issue that has encouraged exploitation by LP farmers, and discouraged honest pvp players from joining the "losing" faction.  I'd say that's the main thing CCP needs to fix, but also probably the hardest problem for them to solve.
---
Yeah, blingy covops missile loki, mine costs 2 bil, take that and go to bot space, or empty drone space, and scan down heirarchies. Run those and the trouble in Paradisr escalations. Each heirarchy and escalation is guarenteed to drop something green. Sometimes its a troll 7 mil mod, other times its a 260mil dcu. Whats nice is how fast you clear these, so you can run quite a few of these in an hour.
---
Exe in the zip
---
didn't you break down in tears on PL comms when you gave the titan back to that guy who stole a pile of AT ships. 
---
Cant a T3C do C3 sites?
---
Unless your in a hurry, always use sell orders unless the price is crashing.
---
Yea, they have been for a bit, but skill farms provide a floor for plex (and MCTC) and have provided a huge source of demand over the past two years.  If you take out skill farms, then the supply of plex could probably have met the demand.  And going forward, it the synergy between plex and skill farms isn't broken, they will also be lurking, waiting to be activated if plex actually dropped.  
---
15b for a dreadnaught that is 5-10% better than Naglfar/Pheonix would be really nice.
---
Problem is the obvious cap issues. If it can get neuted out by 6 bhaalgorns in under 5 minutes,  its useless.
---
Rather than pointing out that we've done lots of work like this in the past - Feel free to go look up the roundtables I've done with the FW folks, and the Crossfaction discord, and the Wardecs discord, and the NPE discord, and the Capital balancing roundtable Sort ran - I'd like to suggest something simple.
---
Maybe present a list of topics and points you'd like to see brought up at the next summit before it, rather than after it, in a constructive manner than focuses on little fixes CCP might realistically be able to pull the resources to do. 
---
This makes all eve gaypwned
---
Finally solve lag issues just in time to watch the system die to poor decisions. (Injectors/excavators/bots) 
---
Launching Eve 2.0 is only long term solution
---
It's like 5.30 pm for euros.

And no one in their right mind holding a stack is gonna sell it.

Sky's the limit now boys
---
End of financial year detected.
---
I brought some plex earlier in the week myself, only 10b worth, still thats enough for me to whelp for a year or two at my current whelp rates and SRP.
---
Fixing the price of plex will just cause shortages unless CCP also seeds them. 
---
Tbh I find the fact that you use a draw most surprising, I figured you just had your monthly stash in a giant pile on one of those cliché movie serving trays. 
---
That's cool but also terrible at the same time. Thanks for the history lesson.
---
&gt; 3, RMT sites am buying to set the price of it
---
Which of these scenarios do you think an RMTer prefers?
---
500 PLEX / $20 = 1.5b ISK
---
or
---
500 PLEX / $20 = 2.0b ISK
---
RMT sites are definitely not buying it, high plex is bad for RMTers. 
---
Pre-fit t1 ships (definitely frigates... maybe cruisers too) given for free to FW players who lose a similarly sized ship to the opposing militia as SRP.  What this does:
---
1. Allows newbros to get out and pvp for only the initial investment in their first ship (I know the argument that pvp is no fun without your blood pumping but, frankly, in this system you will graduate very quickly to t2/pirate hulls that are not srp'd)  Coupled with the new core skills system, this allows newbros to get into playing as a way to learn skills, rather than playing wiki online until they know the fits and meta.
---
2. Allows older players, who still suffer from risk-aversity, to reignite the old fire.
---
3. More people in space means more human connections, which is what drives this game.
---
4. Allows a defensive advantage that helps offset citadels.  Yes, you can still drop an offensive citadel, but you also have to stock your own backup ships; the defenders have a ready supply coming from their faction.  This also then could incentivize attackers to up-tier, FINALLY giving a place in the modern eve to those small, elite gangs that used to be able to fight outnumbered.
---
It's not a total fix but it's a good start.
---
Bad idea lol
---
ye l just wanted a number 3 lol tbf l think its goons buying it up lol
---
Wait... CCP fired all of their economists? Why?
---
&gt;Launching Eve 2.0 is only long term solution
---
Star Citizen?

&gt;Role Bonus: 500% bonus to &lt;a href=showinfo:33699&gt;Medium Combat Drone&lt;/a&gt; damage and 250% bonus to &lt;a href=showinfo:33699&gt;Medium Combat Drone&lt;/a&gt; hitpoints
---
Looks like Gila drones are getting squishier. 
---
Also, separate idea that people have raised, roaming NPC gangs that pay out rewards for being killed, and tackle opposing militia players on gates.  This gives incentive to pve on gates and stations, blurring the lines between pve and pvp as was once intended for FW.  It also makes roaming enemy space more innately dangerous, and helps a lot with immersion.

---
To be fair the gila drones were never primary in a fleet. So at least the options is there now
---
60bil is more than enough if you want to fly crucifiers for the rest of your life you poor. 
---
the smell of piss cum sweat and shit , all mixed in together makes me feel back at fan fest,

stinky fucks

If Eve 2.0 doesn’t go. Star citizen will bury ccp
---
Has anyone considered the reason for all those sales may have been related to the PA acquisition. This year we don't have the string of sales.....
---
every time I walk away from the game, I convert my ISK to PLEX. 
---
Yes, please! Multiple clones in one citadel!
---
My inkling is that this change is mostly PvE aimed. Higher end rats like the trigs or sleepers are going to chew them up much faster now. 
---
:rolleyes:
---
HODL 
---
LOL no. You put your own isk on the line every time you undock. Mine for 20 mins and you can afford a new t1 frig. You seriously want free ships to PVP in? Gimme a break...
---
&gt; 5) Just ban ventures from entering FW plex.... Now its an issue, as everyone said it would be. Time to ban them.
---
I'm fine with banning them but is this actually a big issue? I only ask because I see far fewer ventures d-plexing than I thought I would. Instead I see a ton of Atrons and other cheap T1 frigs named "Worm" o-plexing who bug out even before I land on grid and leave system if I don't do so myself within five minutes.
---
I think CCP should remove the ability to pay for your account with PLEX now that there is a free to play option. They could keep selling it as a way to buy things but removing the ability to PLEX your account would solve the botting problem. Down vote me into oblivion you fan bois.
---
The exception to what he says is if you are building orca or frieghter for highsec use.
---
Game has to be out for that to happen.
---
How much is left on the market now? 
---
The Eve Mogul sotiyo in Kamio has the t1 rig. I have been building components there for orcas.
---
Isn’t OCR harder to pull off?
---
But isn't multi accounting something that has been pretty much since the beginning? 
---
GCSM!
---
they're common ish in wh
---
just use smartbombs. it's like fireworks 
---
Down to about 160k left now.
---
so you're saying it's impossible to search for a string with "a2-" because of ~how databases work~ even though this worked in eve within the last month
---
First Drakes, now Plex?  
---
When will people realize. Delve 1DQ is where it's at, Jita is for scrubs.
---
Heres a 12mb spreadsheet on why agreeing to send a hooker to a "video game journalist" for positive coverage wouldve actually been a bad investment and resulted in a net loss.  
---
Yes prices rising yessssssssssssss
---
As a fw.only mod csps can equip fw transponder unit which allows them into plexs or cyno in?
---
It has become more common and the scale far greater for the average player. "Elite" corps always multiboxed, of course.
---
Any guess if there are a lot of people holding until there is a better price to cash out?
---
Also, is this an all time low or just a "normal" fluctuation regarding plex sales or whatnot?
---
I had to clear queue, log off, log back in -&gt; worked again
---
buy orders can be changed, duh
---
if CCP went 2018 again and started having mega-sales the buyers would inch down to get better value
---
It more for the abyssal sites for the nerf. Main fleet wise I have not seen any of the blocks use them recently.
---
CSM does not play FW, they are the blue donut, thus they have never even set foot in FW and ignore it 
---
1 super, 1 fax, 1 rorqual, 1 dread and you're down to 20bil. 
---
40 PvP ships later and you're flat broke. 
---
I'm not sure why you're acting like people haven't been playing this game for over a decade. 
---
&gt;yes it's almost has if in 2 years they haven't published new structures, abyssal space and the ships that comes with them
---
i'm really confused, are you trying to say that this is a lot of content to have done in 2 years? because it really isn't, if anything it's a very small amount given that the new structures have a shit ton of issues to this day(at least now its mostly regarding their overall balance), abyssal space is nothing but randomly generated spawn waves with certain constraints per tier and pretty gfx, mutaplasmids up to now lack any kind of reasonable listing method and are just as predicted falling into complete disuse. The ships are cool I guess but sure would be cooler and less work to just balance existing lines of ships instead of introducing yet another line for them to ignore for the next years.
---
Nobody is asking them to "just do balance", people are asking them to work like every other mmo where balance is something continuous and not something to make time for. It just takes one dude who knows what he's doing to balance ships, it's literally changing numbers in a database.
---
And if your reaction to asking for ls and fw revamps is "oh but that takes time and they were busy with abyssals and structures!!" then all i have to say is why would they fucking choose to add even more shit when things that are already in the game and being used are broken? and that's before mentioning that a huge number of the problems with ls and fw WERE CAUSED BY THE NEW STRUCTURES IN THE FIRST PLACE so they couldn't even be bothered to deal with that in those 2 years
---
I come home from my 8h job to play 3h on my second job to afford to plex my accounts. great life.
---
&gt;Down vote me into oblivion you fan bois.

I wasn't going to even with such a shitty idea, but since you insist

Is $500 enough to make you feel inadequate?  Go get a job and earn yourself some money, fucking couch lump.

---
This is the dumbest shit ive ever read
---
How databases work has changed. This is part of what makes eve online so complex.
---
Hur dur I'm a gigantic retard
---
No that’s dumb
---
None of which are necessary at all lmao...but going with your example, if you lose 40 pvp ships without a means to replace them over time with your rorqual + whatever SRP your alliance has then maybe you should look into flying the crucifiers :D
---
and get alot of ppl to stop playing eve
---
wat?
---
If the ship spins in the hanger at the speed of light and the captain spins his chair in the same direction at the speed of light, what happens?
---
This is a bad idea that can be rigged. People will team up until only their team is left and then duke it out among themselves. It would not be a free for all but a rigged thing.
---
.....i get the feeling we should have people watching the EVE gate....just in case CCP starts putting clues in that its stabilizing..
---
Lame lmao
---
:)
---
Someone removed all dashes from the database bytes must be getting expensive for ccp
---
I guess people who would want to farm him...
---
Add specific character to contacts &gt; contact logs in &gt; run locator to find system &gt; go kill that character and get officer loot because they are a credit card warrior.     
---
But who cares, right?
---
It would get a lot of people that are abusing the system to stop playing EVE.
---
Just because someone brought up a game that doesn't exist, like EvE 2, doesn't mean you have to as well.
---
Only thing Star Citizen will bury is your check book. 
---
No more sales? You mean recently, or has CCP said they're not doing the nutty galaxy pack deals any more?
---
We're talking about people who throw their wallet at the game.
---
SP Farming has been immensely un-profitable for quite some time now
---
Bullshit, people who get filthy space rich should be able to play for free.
---
It would be a kin to grabbing EVE's economy, dumping gas on it, and lighting a match. 
---

---
how to kill the game in one easy step
---
Sure and I'm saying $500/60b right now is more than enough for many players to reach "end game" and then some - like you said, all those capitals + 40 subcaps, with a means to replace them easily.... Like how much more ISK do you want to grind up?
---
If plex gets super expensive imma break the game tonight lol
---
can I get a quick rundown 
---
Can you imagine running out of plex? Without plex, there won't be any skillfarms. Which means, there will probably be less injectors available, so we will see less and less 0-to-100-titan/rorqual-alts. And one person won't be able to cloaky-camp 100 systems without having to actually invest irl-money. And not only that, there will generally be less one man shows, so people need to rely upon each other more. Which in turn gives more people the chance to be involved, but also offers opportunities for spies. Leading to more mistakes and more betrayl, resulting in a more interesting universe.
---
Sounds good to me... 😃
---
All the comments about how stupid it is have no supporting facts. State why it's stupid. You can't because you're all fan bois that live in your mommies basement and can't afford RL $ to pay for your 20 botting Rorqual accounts.
---
I'm mostly annoyed the system seems to ignore the dashes entirely when doing the search at the top left.
---
You could use the money from your first job to pay for the subscription. Otherwise choosing a subsceibtion-based game seems weird, tbh.
---
you're right, but for the last 10+ years i've remembered the first 3 characters, not the first 3 letters, so it becomes much more difficult to find the system in question if i have to learn another character.
---
full speculation, check when those sell orders where created. 
---
That's pretty cool actually but that guy's face... wtf.
---
nice way to end the travel.  it really is no joke to visit all systems. specially wormholes
---
btw...does that astero have missile launchers?
---
You can play for free as an Alpha account. No one has a right to play Omega for free.
---
Don't worry I get paid next Friday. 
---
Can't afford that to. i live in a country where aveerage wage is 400 euro's and i pay 420 euro's rent/month 
---
No more direct sales as large as last year's. The 10% one a while ago was pretty weak and a lot of people that usually buy during sales didn't due to how low the discount was.
---
*downward flag and then buy again at 5.2*
---
You don't buy high lol ...
---
The skill injector market is mostly staying up because people use the isk they made to buy PLEX to omega and MCT their accounts. Not a whole lot of people would if it means spending RL money to finance it.
---
So even more retarded that it already is.
---
Good point.
---
With PLEX prices skyrocketing it's already on fire. Botting is killing the game. This would solve the problem. Unless you thing botting 20-30 Rorqual accounts is a good thing for the economy?
---
You don't get notified when characters log in unless they have also added you....
---
No, no scents, however, the sound of my wife yelling at me really reminds me of Eve.
---
Yeah, I only buy with RL cash when the Galaxy packs are on Humble Bumble at 40% off. I have had a bit of money waiting for that, as I have a couple of accounts that haven't taken that offer yet. 
---
Why.  The cost of 500 plex in hours is far less in your main job than in your second job.  I mean PvE for pocket money.  Sub your accounts if you can.  Or at least your main.  It's a better use of your time than whatever you're doing to earn in the game.
---
You assume everyone plays the same way and enjoys the same things you do.
---
A lot of people piss 60b in a matter of weeks.  
---
50mn command dessies all (except the stork) hit 20km/s or more with their self-links. Of the three the Pontifex is actually the best, against appearances, with its 5 lowslots at 23km/s without a well-rolled MWD. 
---
Considering AT ships the Gold Magnate is the fastest ship. It goes 33.7km/s without links (and a rolled MWD) which is insane. There's other much more affordable options like the Tiamat that are in the 25km/s range too. 
---
&gt;Today’s test is designed to help the spacefaring MMO go boldly into its third decade

---
No amount of organizing is going to outvote 40000 goons, 15000 hordlings, and 20000 testies.  It's just not going to happen, and its an example of why direct democracy is a failed system in Eve.  Representative democracy is the one true way.
---
Is there anything specific to it that makes it tick along nicely :)?
---
&gt;Caldari Navy Issue Drone Capacity: 0.0 =&gt; 25.0  
---
Not really surprised. When you compare their new dev blogs with the old dev blogs about balance changes. These things were already going out and hitting TQ as stated in the devblog.  
---
Like, looking at the old BC dev [blog](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6030024/) you see they have a "reserved" post under the the main topic for FAQ or changes to be made during the feedback phase. They can also modify the main topic to change things based on feedback.
---
Now we just get a fully formed Dev Blog, where on the surface (i very well may be wrong), it looks like its not something they can edit/modify on the fly. Which leads me to believe they have no intention of modifying anything in the devblog. Basically a fire and forget "balance pass". Which i think is fair in some regards, as even Falcon hinted at their being a lot of backlash from the capital users, and they probably didn't want to get too bogged down with vitriol about that. 
---
The subcap balances were pretty off the wall for everything except beam buffs, ferox nerfs and harbinger buffs, which all point to using the Harbinger to counter the Ferox. Which, in itself is kind of odd that they're so blatant about that in a dev blog. Ofc, thats more of a symptom of this Dev blog being about capitals than subcaps, which is fine for now i suppose. The capital changes will help shift the meta to a degree.  
---
As to the CNI specifically, if they go through with the drone changes, modifying it in anyway as i described would make it too strong. Which means they'd need to remove the drones in the future, which makes this kind of a moot change. Short of that, it would just need to be redesigned from the ground up and maybe made into something completely different (like a hybrid platform). In reality though, nothing will probably be done with the CNI for another year (or more) as the same 3 people who fly it regularly will continue to fly it, while everyone else ignores it.
---
They are doing it at early out of work time for most western EU players. Which is shit for many, but I mean who really though they would have 10k players anyway ?

Sure there might be some people doing that, my point is that there can't be "hundreds" of players making serious money off RMT. There just isn't enough income to go around. And if the major players in that type of RMT are doing this across multiple regions, then it seems pretty pointless to talk about the isk flow in major alliances...

We did this last election Rinai.

If Plex stopped being used to sub accounts, it would be worthless.
---
Everyone except the botters &amp; the people RMTing think those things are destroying the game. Everyone complains about Super proliferation except for the people doing it. Skill Injector farming is ruining the game. All these things are being paid for by PLEX, not RL $. Why should the people that are doing these things get to continue doing them for free?
---
Can’t you work more hours?
---
Festival launchers will be my guess.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
old search doesn't even work now :-\
---
No it wouldn't be worthless, it would be worth less.
---
Yes, I guess after trying out everything else in eve i should probably finally give the 0.0 a try 
---
I should probably just join a nice 0.0 Corp &amp; try it out :)
---
For now I guess I’ll just research my BP to 10/20, can’t hurt :D
---
Why is it a bad idea to want to stop the rampant botting going on? It's a sense of entitlement that you're feeling.
---
It would be worth *significantly* less, which makes it not effective to buy with real money, because you wouldn't get much for your money. So many people would stop playing because of it.
---
And on top of all that, you didn't even kill RMT. It may surprise you, but the goal of RMT is to earn real money. If they make enough to pay for the sub with the RMT, then there is still incentive to do it.
---
But that, mixed with the fact that plex isn't worth spending irl money on, you've actually made the RMT problem *worse*.
---
PLEX needs to be a cosmetic only currency. Remove it from subscription (yes, I know technically its Pilot's Licence Extention) but we can just call it PLEX and keep if for making ships pretty.
---
At 1 Billion ISK, PLEX became nearly a full-time job to keep even a decently skilled carrier pilot subbed, assuming they had a very secure safety umbrella. Super ratting is a different story and it came much easier, but at greater risk (\~20B vs \~2B)
---
At 1.5B PLEX became the only reason most committed players even logged on... just to PLEX their account so they could PLEX their account the next month and so on. 
---
There are sizable outliers on both the PVP and PVE sides who simply paid the $15 and actually ENJOY the came, but PLEX is all too commonly the driver for logging in. Good hell, I remember when 295 Million ISK would PLEX an account. 
---
It must be separated from subscriptions. This way Alphas would still be able to enjoy level IVs to support their own PVP or at least are providing higher end content for all other players and those who want Omega status will be forced to enjoy the game more. It's $15. 
---
Probably because your braindead suggestion would make botting worse.
---
Signed up, then once they sent download link I learned that they wanted me to accept a draconian NDA for a simple "stress test" with a proof of concept prototype.

He probably carries his assumptions into every conversation.

---
It would be like if a national park's solution to poaching was to relocate all the animals to zoos. Sure it would solve poaching, but it would also defeat the purpose of having a park.
---
Your idea would remove the carrot that many of us follow. Every major player in the economy pays for his subs with in-game earnings—that's the mark of success.
---
When you propose a radical new change the onus on you is to provide a compelling argument that it's better, not bitch about lack of support. 
---
Look at the Plex sales - all of them are very fresh, even those big ones. You can see how people try to speculate price even higher.         
---
CCP would have to lower the price but they would more than make up for it with subscription increases. You're arguement that it would make  botting worse is an empty one. It would remove the Rorqual fleets to be replaced by 1-2 accounts botting. 
---
No coincidence that newer skins have tags on them, Premium etc.?
---
Isn't this the foundation for setting up a loot box system that will give  a % of roll listing needed for loot boxes these days. Legendary 1%, Rare 5%, Premium 20% and so on?
---
&gt;now that there is a free to play option it's just led to abuse.
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Be mindful, there are also economical reasons to keep PLEX value high through gametime. It’s by not the biggest actor, but it can help some aspects like inflation stay at reasonable levels.

I've been looking at this for nearly six months. The average amount available to purchase in The Forge is worth 2 trillion ISK. In the last two weeks this has declined rapidly despite the rapid rise in prices. With currently only 710bil worth of ISK available in The Forge for purchase, I am concerned about runaway pricing or a total buyout unless we see a dump soon, and someone would need to dump at least 1.5 trillion on the market to stabilize prices. 
---
Why......do you have +1s +2s and +3s?
---
Yeah, actually. There's been a lot of speculation along that line. CCP wanted to boost revenues around the time of the sale so they ran a lot of sales to get people to give them $$$
---
&gt; All these things are being paid for by PLEX, not RL $
---
...you know where plex comes from, right?
---
Occator is bae
---
Being in test, this is believable lol
---
Yes I know it's purchased with RL money by people that need and ISK infusion.
---
Hell i remember when a plex was 330m
---
I think it means in 4 years time, when EVE will be entering it's third decade
---
It's going to crash at some point though
---
glad i could clear things up :)  if you have any more questions feel free to post.
---
It's a salty mixture of sweat, tears, and the gases released prior to shitting oneself
---
Think about this for a full second.
---
You're assuming all the legit players would still use all of their accounts, and all the RMTers would stop. But the problem with that is that this would make RMT *more worthwhile* because plex would be nearly worthless. Tons of legit players would leave, while RMT would be more profitable than ever.
---
Right now, buying plex from an RMTer is more cost effective, but not necessarily worth getting banned over. And with plex prices so high, people who buy plex with $$$ are getting more for their money than ever.
---
If you crash plex prices so that they are crazy cheap, why would you buy it legitimately? Instead of getting 4mil/plex, let's say you get .5mil/plex (which is a generous estimation imo).  Suddenly you're getting an eighth of what you'd normally get when you buy plex legitimately.
---
So suddenly it's worth the risk of getting banned to buy from an RMTer, because you're getting so much more for your money. Sure the RMTers would have to pay for their subs, but it's called "the cost of doing business". They are spending a little money to make a whole lot more than ever before.
---
I'm no expert, but a much less volatile solution that keeps getting brought up would be to nerf rorquals and get rid of skill injectors. It seems to be fairly agreed upon that those two things have devastated the economy. 
---
yes so why not remove skill injecting and keep PLEXing accounts ? There is nothing wrong with that ...
---
Cannabis/skunks. Theres so much weed where I live that it's almost impossible to know for sure which you are smelling..
---
That's what they want you to think.
---
Because when PLEX prices skyrocket someone surely wont drop a massive horde and tank the market while making ludicrous profits to do it again.  
---
Right?  
---
.... Surely it won't happen.
---
Maybe a bunch of people just realized that the areas you had been exploring were underpopulated and so moved in to run sites. So sites are spawning at the same rate, but there are more people running them now, so they run out faster. 
---
I quiver i fear of your ability to down vote me. Unlike so any people that play EVEY life doesn't revolve around it.
---
it'd do shit all to stop botting.
---
it's almost like if say "it'll stop botting" regardless of the fact that it'll do jack shit to botting then you feel entitled to post shit ideas.
---
fucking stop it - pretending it solves botting when it doesn't do a damn thing to prevent botting is just as retarded as your idea itself.
---
Enlighten me if you can. It's not obvious and u don't think your arguement will.prove it.
---
I suspect there is a speculative element to this. No matter the issues with bottling, injectors, etc. It's still probably rising faster than is organic.
---
Excuse me, are you new here?
---
Its not necessary harder (in terms of skill etc). But doing it via memory inspection is just less effort esp when it comes to setup and it also takes less resources (OCR requires quite some processing power), which is probably much more relevant since people who are bottling usually aren't running just one bot.
---
take my upvote.
---
Unless they make the biggest spod asyeroid ever i don't see what 10k people wull fight for in eve. 
---
i'd quit

And who would part with those stacks right now while the trend is going up like crazy? Speculation will only go up.

---
Yeah you mean the pain in the ass to set up not infinite site where there is no automatic "save me" button ?
---
Yeah I think those are fine really.
---
Given these wages, he'd probably be better off earning ISK than working overtime.
---
You're full.of shit. It would absolutely reduce botting &amp; saying it won't is a false statement.
---
Yep, multiple times, to many downvotes...

EVE 2.0 would be a game, not a scam
---
I don't want you to know my location thanks

1. LP for kills: [url=https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-fw-exploit-2012]5 goons used it[/url] to earn more LP than everyone else in the game made in a year, after warning CCP that their mechanic was busted. That's why it sucks now. Instead, why not LP for *losses* and tie it to hull value only?
---
4. Cyno jamming lowsec: don't plexes already block cynos on their grids? (I know little about FW.) It's an interesting idea, but people who aren't in FW need to move through that space too. Blocking all cynos from the black rise &amp; placid zones would really fuck with areas of space like cloud ring and pure blind. Is there some state that FW gets in where a short-term system cynojam would be useful? Like when a system flips it gets a jam for a day?
---
It's almost as if there is no demand for "buying isk with real money" anymore.
---
nobody buying plex means price drops.
---
when plex isn't worth much, people look to other places to buy isk.
---
RMTers see an influx of sales because plex isn't worth buying, making RMTing more lucrative.
---
It's due out when eve dies.
---
found a youtube livestreamer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2TMNc\_hqog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2TMNc_hqog) in case the twitch stream fails.
---
You are literally camping a gate in jita in a proteus right now, with a guardian next to you.
---
Very engaging skill based gameplay going on there, you must have alot of wisdom to add to those CSM meetings
---
Bookmarks bar hidden? What kind of heathen are you? 
---
It is not now, there search removes "-" so you are only searching for "A2"
---
Obviously you didn't because it affect both sides of the supply and demand. Yeesh. 
---
Please if your a successful wormhole operation you just close all the holes and your relatively safe. Safer than most of the small alliance in null.
---
No I'm not. I'm literally going to bash a structure right now, retard. I have plenty I can offer as a CSM member that typically gets overlooked by your usual Nullblock member. 
---
why?
---
first of all how dare you
---
The idea was good, if they went through with it and made station player to player interaction a thing, it would have been amazing.  What came to mind for great concepts was the Star Wars game that came out, TOR, where you got access to your personal ship where you can walk around and play holo-games, then you can go up to the 'main station' where all players can interact in that huge galactic station and get all your shopping done just the same.  CCP had a good vision, just no follow-through.  sad.
---
oh yes please compare stuff that can't be compared continue one please
---
Affordable
---
Tiamat 
---
:looks at 7 digit wallet and feels bad:
---
You get more value out of your plex now.
---
Falling supercap prices, mineral prices etc yet people are still not willing to buy plex to soften this spike despite getting much more ingame value for it.
---
This means that as a result less people are heavily invested in the game and that is an indicator of a dying game.
---
A slow increase in plex is good for the game, just like a small inflation is good for RL economics. (plex value stagnant at 1 month game time, isk inflating)
---
A spike similar to a hyperinflation would wreck eve as is.
---
lol, wtf is he doing ?
---
he threatened to cut off the judge's hands
---
Says the one comparing a super cap fleet to a wormhole. Lol stop complaining like the masses 
---
Reloaded is also streaming it :D with commentary [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy14sG9zNkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy14sG9zNkg)
---
I don't even know what to say.
---
Give Katia a neutered Polaris frigate. Just give it the stats of an astero or something but the model of the dev ships.
---
what for?
---
The one that does not want people on r/Eve to see their bookmarks, otherwise I'm a normal human being that has it pinned open 
---
Is it still used a lot? Any good? 
---
you must not have played in some time
---
Could also be interpreted as a game that started in the 00's, made it through the 10's, and is likely going to make it to the 20's
---
More than that, this should go in the lore somewhere too. This is quite the feat.
---
lower plex prices make it easier for RMTers to earn money, increasing their incentive to earn money - which they do by selling isk that has been obtained usually by botting.
---
lower plex prices = more profit for RMTers = more reason to bot.
---
on top of that nobody has an incentive to buy plex from CCP since it's now worth dick all in isk so it's easier to farm isk (legitimately or illegitimately) than it is to work an extra hour at work.
---
Friendly reminder that if you want a candidate to push FW fixes you should probably elect one. Stop not voting for FW people and then complaining when FW isnt brought up at the summit. 
---
In npc null its not important who is relevant. Its who is more fucked up. 
---
can't show people that naughtyhorses.com bookmark, I get it 
---
Only of PLEX cam be continued to be used to sub accounts.
---
Doesn't have to be US TZ, but it feels like doing it on a Saturday would GREATLY increase the number of people they could get from ANY timezone.
---
If you want i can compare anything for you, just name two things
---
iirc there was a line in the press releases last year that some bonuses depended on 'hitting certain financial targets'
---
i know that gs_isk picked up on it, but i dont remember many shitposts here
---
Nice one CCP. And good job to the homey!
---
Star Citizen will almost certainly not be an EVE replacement. It will however, be an Elite Dangerous replacement. So much about SC is far better than ED and SC is still a long ways away from being a complete game.
---
The graphics are far better, planets are far better, being able to walk around is far better.
---
But, SC is not an empire building game and it's not going to have thousands of people partaking in epic battles because it's a real time simulator of sorts.
---
An EVE competitor would need to be focused around the sandbox concept, where all the best game play is in some form of PVP (in the sense that players interact with players, whose actions affect other players, etc, not just combat), and the PVE/NPCs portion is just there to seed the initial state of the game.
---
Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any game now or in development, that gets anywhere near to the player driven content of eve. 
---
Can you ELI5 where exactly it says he is banned ?
---
No it would be 26^9 if you wanted a nine letter specific order. If you had a 3 digit lock you have 10^3 combinations not 3^10.
---
Second of as mentioned further down the nine letters can occur in more than one order as you can reorder them by going to a different spot in the solar system. 
---
Unless i screwed up the odds should be 26^3 choose 3 which is somewhat less than 1 in 905 billion. The logic being that we have a list of all three letter combinations and we find the chance to pick those three entries.
---
how is flying around all of eve in a travel ceptor and being babysat through all of jspace an achievement 
---
PLEX is skyrocketing and it will cost 2,3B+ ISK to sub an account. You are living in the end game of EVE and all of you are too stupid to see it. You are so used to PLEXing your multiple accounts for the time spent playing that you are spoiled and want to continue the status quo. Enjoy killing the game.
---
For independent candidates under the STV system, it really does come down to the number of people out there whipping up votes. Two or three FW candidates just aren't gonna do it. It'd take six or eight FW candidates, all pushing both FW and a topic or two of their own, all endorsing each other and all urging their voters to vote for one of the eight and putting their #2 through #7 choices on the others. The hardest part about it would be finding eight people who care enough about FW to campaign and whip up votes knowing that they'd only have a 1/8 (or at best 2/8) chance of winning.
---
I can't stress hard enough that it comes down to the number of people voting. The last few CSMs have been all-null CSMs because everyone else is just sitting it out. It would *not* take very many non-null votes to swing a seat or two away from them.
---
Too late. I've already called Andrew Parker. 
---
I'd think you, of all people, could recognize a shitpost when you see one.
---
my point here
---
I saw this and was so triggered i had to get up from my desk and walk around for 10 min
---
Nope, it's worse - I still have a facebook bookmark that I press about once a month or so. Dirty little secret 
---
Tbh the only actual fact that was ever posted on this sub is that we're all gay pwnd
---
It will also bypass the timer, so if you have an active timer it will still let you clone swap.
---
 .... or i could play my small part in it ......
---
How would it solve RMT? RMT you buy ISK, not PLEX.
---
hey at least there is actual risk there
---
Oh boy now the pieces are clicking for you guys.
---
CCP seeing a sinking ship? Can't change the course of the game? Too much of a mess to fix?
---
I've been ready. \*popcorn\*
---
Will help small gang fight Gilas
---
CCP doesn't believe the tac is a character.
---
#justicefortacs #tacsarecharacterstoo #icelandracistagainsttacs
---
The taxes tho! So much Sunk Isk! ^^^/s
---
who actually thinks these 'features' are good ideas
---
CCP can set the price of PLEX. They can run the price up to where botters cannot afford to run their accounts and purchase it. Would they do this? Probably not but, I would not rule anything out at this point with the new owners. There is some kind of end game to all this. I am just gonna sit back and eat my popcorn and see where it ends up. 
---
I was just pointing things out. This clicked for me when Injectors came out lol.
---
Just wanted to say that about the lack of sales since no one else did
---
Depends on what you want to do. I’ve been playing for five years and I exclusively small-gang PvP. zkill says I’ve lost 500 ships worth 20 billion ISK. With 60 billion ISK I suspect I’d be able to play for another ten years without ever worrying about ISK or changing my play style. (I pay real money for my sub on an annual basis.) Sure, I wouldn’t be able to get in to titan dropping, but I’m okay with that.
---
I'll add all this stuff to my list. 
---
You are entirely correct: it would be 26^(9). However, I'm unfamiliar with the "choose 3". What does that mean?
---
Was just thinking the last time I bought plex was right around that price haha. Must have been around 2014? 
---
thanks for posting and i'm glad you enjoyed the read.  as far as third party tools, i'm not really up to date on those.  the ones i used to use were all murdered in the api change.  there are some simple ones like eve-marketdata that allow you to price items in specific places but i havent found any trade tools that are currently updated/working correctly.  mostly i use old fashioned elbow grease and just go through the orders manually to find products to sell.  i do not trade in items that are sold frequently.  if someone uses it everyday, i prolly dont sell that.  the reason is that so many people gravitate to the frequently used items for trade purpose that the market is crowded with competition and i burn out with the constant order modifications.  more competition also means lower margins/less profit.  i saw it as way to be tied to the computer more often for less isk.  because of that, i decided to risk a slower market with less competition and higher margins.  in the end that turned out to be right decision for me and the way i wanted to play the market game.  the in-game market history is extremely helpful once you learn how to use it.  to start you will just want to find an item where the buy price is significantly lower than the sell price.  find something that sells for say 50m and the buy orders run around 25m.  i never take anything that has less than a 20% margin so that i have a little room to wiggle if the margins start to shrink.  if the margin drops below 10% i will stop trading completely because then you run the risk of falling into no profit or even loss category if the margins continue to shrink.  always remember there are fees/taxes that have to be figured into overhead.  after i find an item with a good margin i look at the market history.  i want to see a nice big wide donchian channel (the gray shaded area) which tells me there has been a good margin for a sustained time.  i also look at the historical "norm"(the lines) to make sure someone hasnt overpriced an item because of low supply or market manipulation.  if the normal price has been running around 25m you dont want to post a buy order close to or over that in case there is a market correction.  does that answer your questions a little better or can i elaborate on it more? :)
---
Been playing the game for nearly a decade and still learning shit.
---
Or, without PLEX people say fuck it and quit EVE.
---
Your hatred of cheating is admirable that you can justify such extreme measures. Try to temper it with some consideration for your fellow human players, but don't give up the fight, brother!
---
Is that the grand wizard of TEST? I bet unclean types such as OlmecaGold don't have standing desks.
---
now instead of all dinosaurs being shitposted here because "DAE TEST HEHE" all triangles are posted here
---
At least one part of this I know to be false
---
Last time i checked Good sux were in 4gq/37s and they are decent fight but if solo usually tends to be 1v5, you have Wreckt around 37s/cjf and they have some really good pvpers, one of them is the most fucked up player ive ever met - Dredx, also very skilled pilot. They like to 1v5 also, if youre looking for ballsy one then that would be William from Litterally the worst community, that guy simply doesnt care about risk adversity and will give you a proper fight, just be careful about him cynoing his 5 super alts. Also he is the n00b that lost that virtuoso last week xD cant wait to fuck him on comms. 
---
I remember.
---
Atleast we now got more bang for bucks. Not so in the other way. 
---
Even people like me who don't play Eve realize what an accomplishment this is.  
---
Congratulations!
---
sweet reply brutha!
---
The problem is nobody is in Faction Warfare because it sucks, there for nobody votes for anybody in Faction Warfare.
---
ya all 800 people that show up gonna make them sweat
---
Wasn't there a time long ago when PLEXing an account was not an option?
---
Personnaly i think they should give   
---
ship cost+fit cost = X LP - ship loot   
---
this way pvper can farm their ISK in pvp \`\\o/
---
Get a little baby rocker/bouncer that you can rock the baby to sleep with your foot while you game!  just be cognizant of that explosive diarhea that will inevitably happen.  Congrats!!  Kids are game changers.. literally.
---
Except for hilariously big ammount of people just quiting, cause only plex kept them around.
---
I did that math wrong, it's closer to 1 in 5.4 trillion.
---
How about CCP make it to where you cannot jam and scoop excavators you have to kill them. Would make the demand and price of them go up and be better for the game. 
---
   
---
I would not buy plex now. I see ccp buying it from people to remove it in the future. This is just an attempt to save the economy of the game. I'm glad of it! 
---
That is correct, they would never just dump all of them at once, as that would destroy the upward trend. Sell 50b a day and call it good
---
I like it for simply being able to be a lazy fuck when taking gates.  With the radial menu, I just drag upwards on the gate icon in the overview. It's far less cumbersome than right click + select jump.
---
trade can be very frustrating sometimes and the burn out probability is high if you attempt to do 5/10 minute mod cycles.  i prefer just checking things every hour or two as i pass by my laptop.  if you arent making profits on what you have been selling, look at other items.  when an item starts to lose its margin, stop trading in it.  i actually enjoy hunting for items more than anything and i love it when i open an items market window to see a 30m buy and a 100m sell.  makes me giddy as a schoolgirl.  :)  best of luck with your renewed interest.  i hope this time is better than the last ;)
---
hahahahahaha
---
&gt;He says that, in the coming years, CCP could move players over to discrete new regions of space as they come online. Or they could do something more extraordinary, like opening up a wormhole and inviting the entire player base to pass through into a completely different galaxy. 
---
Might be time to fire up the sub again.
---
hope you made bookmarks to sell as collectors items 
---
Sure, but the Obelisk looks like a sci fi garbage can.
---
True, but you are limited by sites. 
---
Yeh you can pull in absurd isk per hour but not for long.
---
Goons buying all the plex in game. They are already seeding 1DQ market. LOL gf horde and test. Enjoy ghostimeter.
---
plex to 10k p/u next week?
---
Yikes, if they can't trust you to talk about it how can we trust them to not waste our time.
---
At some point, all this chest beating has to leave you a little sore right?
---
"i'm going to stop botting now that botting profits are at an all time high" - said fucking nobody, ever.
---
I"m not saying its the Bogdanoffs, but....Bogdanoffs.
---
But hey, remember those bot maker posts? Something about making 800b a month and how he was gonna crash the plex market or something. I member.
---
Didn't FEDUP kinda give up on Faction Warfare to become "i can't believe where not renters"
---
this is true, get the Cyber V upgrade via inject then plug in some +5s.  In the end, super worth it.  Also, put in all the skills that you'd never train while active, like the "Heavy missile specialization V" or the "gallente drone specialization V" the ones that are like.. "meh lvl 4 is good enough" make those 5 baby!
---
I see you play monopoly too
---
Early on, it was common to have a Cyno Alt, or ship-sitter if you were into Supers (couldn't dock 'em anywhere); there were some mining multiboxers, not not as many as you'd think. 
---
Based on the available footage, we can just hit F for the AetherEngine in general
---
IT got up to 2500 people for a few seconds before crashing, and for that brief time I got no lag at 120fps so that's something I guess.
---
Everyone makes mistakes. This seems like an easy mistake to make if you have never thought about it before or knew about the fighter changes from earlier last year. It is a good lesson to learn early.
---
F. 
---
Although they pretty much already set it up to fail from the start
---
that was added long before the current miasmos got an ore hold, back then it was called the iteron mark 1 i believe
---
Make all of her future Asteros have the Polaris model. 
---
Im not totally sure but I believe this is what one calls a bubble.
---
there's no way this thing is going to work the way they want the time was to short the timing of the event itself isn't in any prime times, its like they wanted a reason to write it off as being impossible to pull off in case it fails completely.
---
Her journey started in 09, well before travelceptors
---
and some kind of unique apparel for her in-game character
---
more like 2011
---
It exists. Its just a glorified tech demo.
---
I'm from the future
---
It failed
---
Hm, I mean, its not as if the delivery-hangar would jump in your face and stick bananas up your nose. If you dont wanna use it, just ignore it vOv
---
Only the poors though.
---
ISK is not easier to farm than it used to be. I keep seeing randos perpetuate this stupid myth. *Minerals* are easily accessible and cheap.  
---
We have more ISK sinks now than we used to, and C5 wormholers used to make double what they do now because if site nerfs a few years back. It used to be possibke to clear like 1.5-2bil/hr C5 krabbing. 
---
I mean, you can do them with friends in a trio of frigates. 
---
Yea I should probably try that ) 
---
Honorable 1 v 9,999 at the sun.
---
Soon a plex will be 330m again, though 30 days won't be. /s
---
Last time I remember using them was the failed attack on the anchoring keepstar after goons deployed north. 
---
I don’t pay for my subs, I plex my accounts. Am I abusing the system?
---
same can be said about eve, it's about to turn into a typical korean MMO
---
If the price goes up too much or the supply runs out, well I'm just gonna stop playing then. There is like 70 other games on my Steam library that i havent had time to finish, thanks to EVE.
---
I'm playing it right now. It's real bad with only 3500 players. Massive rubberbanding, can't hit anything. iMHO the current Eve client/server actually works better than this so far.
---
&gt;Is it still used a lot?
---
Well, the heavy curse is a highly specialized ship for a highly specialized purpose. Can't say it's used a lot but it's a thing.
---
&gt;Any good?
---
It's good at what it does.
---
AI "players" being used, it's already rigged, boring and stupid...
---
SPOILERS
---
CCP decided to use AI "players" so the number of actual people simultaneously connected to the game is much lower, as most likely was planned due to the weird timing of the test. nothing interesting...
---
i would probably not keep my industrial alt accounts subbed if i couldn't pay with plex, because what i'd effectively be doing is paying $15 per month for a certain amount of isk.  and, uh, i already got plenty of isk.
---
I guess he is the next guest on "Hoarders, eve edition"? I can't see any other reason to have more then 4 pods in any system and most of the once I thought of are probably not for literally every character. (snakes, PvE pod, mind link, training pod were the 4 I thought of)
---
Without shooting yourself in the foot, what steps could CCP realistically take to get a firmer grip on PLEX pricing ; allowing for a slow steady rise while maintaining or increasing server population?
---
... and she was never killed. Not once, in all those years. 
---
Maybe a barrette or a cuff link?
---
“Gave up” on faction warfare in the sense that the current FW environment is horrible, especially for large organized groups, and content was basically not happening at the level they required to keep people entertained. 
---
But yeah they joined up with TEST and friends in the south! 
---
Yes. There was no free to play option back then either. All the crying that this is a stupid idea comes from people that are playing Omega accounts for the time they spend botting or ratting.
---
Saving the game by having people not play who pay for their sub with isk buying plex. Right.
---
Alright boyo, put down the kerosene, gently now. We don't want to attract the wrath of SC cultists.
---
You're the one bringing 1b/h on the table.
---
For the next test please announce the date more than three days in advance so people can actually plan to show up, thank you. 
---
Botting isn't responsible for the lack of PLEX on market right now. That's a bigger picture problem, likely the result of limited sales. 
---
I hope it rises so much so that it pushes out people that skill farm/20box rorqs.
---
Fuck em.
---
Eve never looked so good after seeing the demo....
---
"hundreds of thousands of paying customers"... word??
---
But being a pirate gives you double the targets. And all this would do is make krabbing safer
---
I took French in high school. There's no way anyone can learn that shit in a week. 
---
 Why does the game have such people? 
---
AFs are popular again, cant have that
---
Meta Gay Sex
---
And I thought I was good at not dying lol
---
You've clearly never lived in a wormhole, all it takes is for someone to roll into you while running sites, and since you're stuck in siege, there is a good chance you'll die.
---
Not only that, but there is a limited number of sites that respawn a week, so for most C5 holes, you can really only run between 6-8 sites a week (or 8b). 
---
Super and carrier ratting has infinite amount of respawns, and can support multiple carriers in a single system. Meanwhile, in order to pull in 1b/hour in a wormhole requires the use of three dreadnaughts
---
I'm sorry, but SC will never replace ED just based on the fact that SC already costs well over 200m and there is still no game, while ED started with 10% of that money and has a (somewhat) playable game that has people investing time into it, which incedentally is the only thing worth more than money. that builds you a player base, tech demos dont.. 
---
now I can write 17 books over what's wrong with elite (not playing anymore after 5k hrs), but SC will never see the day of light or atleast not even close in terms of everything they promised. it's just not doable on current average pcs.. SC came 20 years to early 
---

Pretty sure it’s the punisher

u know how i felt bad when i saw this ?

fuck u felix. .l.

Over 12,000 total player right now. 
---
cockroach, for being everywhere and unkillable 
---
Well, I would think the terms would have to be FW player vs FW player in a FW space or plex. 
---
clean neutral malediction pilot, armor tank for their damage type, scrams in the mids and a cyno
---
warp to zero on their gate, get smartbombed, live, cyno up and bring some friends to party
---
three scrams should be enough to hold one down, but they'll probably have stabs fitted so both is probably not happening
---
&gt; I played a lot in around 2008/2009 and remember the legality of login traps being questioned
---
it was then, and still is today, questioned by unwitting victims the same way people think there ought to be a rule against cloaky camping
---
it's never been against the rules and never will be
---
Looking at it the Caiman seems badass. Why's it bad?
---
Well, sure, but why weren't they updated alongside the Miasmos?
---
tl;dr
---
I really didn't want to get into a debate, merely expose that "NumbNuts" is only your perception and other perceptions exist, to contribute to the valuable conversation you have started with your OP.  :)
---
Happy to engage but you are approaching it from both a trader and a manufacturer aspect.  I am not a trader, hated that play style.
---
I dont want to baby sit orders, buy or sell.  I want to multibuy the required materials off sell orders, ship em to a manufacturing base, ship the products back, and right-click, sell them to buy orders.  With full knowledge that I could earn more, if I could be bothered 0.01isk'ing either the buy or sell orders, but explicitly choosing not too.  Just because you don't find the margins in that attractive, doesn't mean I don't.  Just because you claim there is never enough manufacturing spread, doesn't make it true for me.
---
For me, once a month, multibuy mats, setup some freighter contracts, feed some lines, right click/sell some outputs, then go play eve for the month.  Not spend 8 sessions per day, while working, updating orders.  Neither are right or wrong, they are just different options and I was posting to flag that your paradigm around NumbNuts #1 is only the perception from where you are standing.
---
If a number 9 is written on the ground and we stand on different sides of it, we will never agree if it is a 9 or a 6.  And we would both be right.
---
The paradigm shift required to accept that others are playing their own eve and looking for ways to collaborate or drive mutual advantage, is an important concept to understand to really springboard your wealth generation in Eve online (and life, for that matter).  You put forward the OP as "a way" to do it, I completely agree, it is a way to do it.  My comment was to point out some of the reasons that your definition of NumbNuts #1 is actually someone elses "way to do it", and just as valid and has opportunities that you wont see unless you seek to understand, beyond "NumbNuts".  
---
It doesn't negate your way to do it, I was simply trying to encourage people to shift the paradigm, expose (from the "the other side") what the motivation behind NumbNuts #1 may be and suggest opportunities.
---
You even mention that the time investment here affects your return.  Manufacturing is a 'set and forget' opportunity, like a long term PI setup.  And the statement/leap that someone with a different play style doesn't care about their bottom line is ludicrous.  I just value different things to you.  And I assure you, I make ample isk doing things that you state :
---
&gt; quite frankly, ive never seen a buy order with a manufacturing spread that was appealing to me
---
I do.  Every month.  In fact, I see more opportunities than I could be bothered executing.  They aren't for new starters, it requires far more capital than you utilise obviously, but I wasn't saying "build things instead", just "maybe reach out to Numbnuts to seek to understand, there may be great opportunities" and outlining why, personally, I'd jump at that kind of option.  I have no doubt other pure manufacturers would too.

&gt;Early on, it was common to have a Cyno Alt, or ship-sitter if you were into Supers (couldn't dock 'em anywhere); there were some mining multiboxers, not not as many as you'd think.

I was thinking more along the lines of a monocle. For originality purposes.

&gt; You cant base game design into human nature.

Game design is entirely about human nature.
---
&gt; Such mechanics can exist in Eve.
---
Such mechanics do exist in Eve. Ironically, this is likely the problem. Nobody else has been able to build the organization necessary to build a functional empire.
---
The problem with total value killed is the goons loop hole, artificially inflate the price of a dirt cheap unused module (using BS orders) and the blow up a ship with those in the cargo. Boom, instant "100B ship kill, get 5m LP".
---
Not trying to bait thread, probably missing a key link on the thought process here, but why is this such a garbage shitposting awful idea? 
---
The artificial hyping and PR really kills it
---
I don't really see how going into the middle of nowhere nullsec helps the entertainment part then again i grow up in a eve where having to burn 30 jumps for a fight was considered a bad thing.

Fun fact: the fundamental functionality of how a database "works" very rarely changes, only a firm's implementation of that system changes. In this case, the firm made a poor change in the _implementation_ of the system, but the _database_ is absolutely capable of finding that system or relevant systems with any number of characters &gt; 0.

I found out that it was around 3K real players, and the rest were AI added for more stress. Still really impressive.

Honestly I don't care that much about ventures, but the issue OP mentioned was "zero risk" plexing. Banning ventures might have a small positive impact, and will not have any negative impact on FW, so I say just do it.  
---
Unfortunately the previous fix to stabbed ships was to bar them from taking plex accel gates, which broke sliding into plexes and caused a host of negative impacts.  What they should have done was to make any ship with warp core stabilization unable to run the timer.  People could still pvp in them in FW plexes, but wouldn't be able to farm.
---
Amen, we all the know the Paypings of the warzone with squads of shuttled pulling alts farming 23/7.
---
I will heroically swipe my credit, for the people, if it hits 5mil / plex.
---
SC has seen stable development this entire time. I get that many regard it as a joke, something that will never be completed, but this is not Duke Nukem Forever. This is a game with a published roadmap, regular quarterly updates, and is extremely well funded. I'm not convinced that it's vapourware at all. They have the funding to carry on development for another decade without selling anything.
---
So I remain hopeful about Star Citizen. Because the tech demo that it is now, is frankly amazing. So even if SC turns out to be vapourware, the tech they developed for it will surely find a loving home somewhere.
---
Either way though, neither game is EVE. There is nothing out there that is EVE, which is sad :(

PLEX behaves like Gold in the IRL economy. 
---
Folks will hoard it when they don't know where else to sink their money.  It's always worth something significant, so it's a safer investment than any module or mineral that could swing heavily with a single patch or update. 
---
Once the price gets high enough, those that have been hoarding will release their stock once they remember the password to their holding account. 
---
Eh, you're oversimplifying a bit.  The few people that still do traditional multi-cap escalations in wspace do have a bit if risk, but its very TZ-dependent.  A closed hole on a USTZ weekday has an obscenely low chance to be rolled into, speaking from experience.   The astra farms or MJD subs to escalate lower that risk even more for many wh krabs.
---
Meanwhile on the null end, you still have align times, rorquals, and blue-tackle to fuck with things, and cynos for one hell of an escalation on either side, hence why stuff still dies.  
---
Point is, most krabs are risk-averse as fuck in both k space and j space
---
My bad.

Its really not that hard. First you have factorials which describes the ways to arrange objects. Say you have 9 pencils with different colors. You have then 9 options of which color to choose first. With that color gone from the unranked pool you now have 8 colors left to choose from as the next in order. After that 7 and so on. This gives 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 or 9!. 
---
Now we want to figure out how to order 3 out of these 9 pencils. Following the logic above we first have 9 choices then we get 8 choices and then 7 and after that we have chosen 3 of the pencils. This is now 9!/6! or 9*8*7 we remove the tail 6*5*4*3*2*1.
---
The last piece of the "choose" operator is to remove the order. Previously it mattered which of the 9 pencils we choose first and which of the 8 we choose second and so on. Lets say that we had one selection which was RED, GREEN and BLUE and another that was BLUE, GREEN and RED. If the order doesnt matter this is the same combination. Now from our first part we can figure out that we can order 3 pencils in 6, that is 3!, ways. So by dividing 9!/6! by 3!, that is 9!/(6!*3!) we get 9 choose 3. The unique selections of 3 out of 9 pencils.

---
You really can't break the link between plex and injectors in price.  Even if extractors didn't require plex, there are many vet accounts that have no real use for the SP, so theyre always going to price their injectors as high as possible given demand, with the floor being when its no longer worth it to plex the account.
---
They'll have to upgrade the other SOE ships as well. 
---
point being, have the same fun just do it cheaper.. WAY cheaper.. no purple mods.  Go for T2 first, feel the game, own people with it.. read about game mechanics.  When you consider yourself 'initiated' pump up the juice and go blue and start having some fun.

Create a limited edition skin in her honor and put it in the store for a limited time and all the proceeds go to a charity of her choice....
---
there are some limitations you could put on it.  ala, you can only extract over 25M SP or something of the sort. 
---
there was almost no way this thing could live up to the hype. maybe after a few years of work it'd be in a better state for a demo
---
If it hasn't been made clear to you already, I'll try to explain it as simply as possible.
---
If the ability to PLEX your account was removed, the price of PLEX would crash, if you were to buy PLEX, you would only sell it for a fraction of what you would get now. This change, however would not stop RMT bots as they make real money from selling ISK. As a result, buying from RMT would become more desirable as it would be much more efficient than PLEX. RMT would become even more profitable, resulting in more RMT bots.
---
That’s a tiny chance to catch someone though. A good scanner would only have the probes out for about 8 seconds, sure plenty of people will dscan and notice, but I reckon plenty wouldn’t as well. 
---
You seem to love those expensive drone link augmentors, they are a waste just use T2's 
---
Definitely should, it's good fun with a couple AFs and beers. I do the solo stuff too, but not really for the isk I just think the environments are gorgeous and it kills time when nothing's going on in a more engaging way than ratting or mining. Barely made any isk out of it tho lol.

No, F for executives that always sell something they don't know and don't understand

Not bad considering this is first try of a tech demo
---
There is no good reason to remove the option to plex accounts.   CCP loses money from subs and the extra revenue they get from PLEXed over subbed accounts,  it removes an option for low-paid eve players to play the game the way they want,  it reinforces RMT through the lack of a legitimate alternative, and it reduces the revenue CCP earns from cosmetic items.
---
If you don't want to PLEX, fine,  buy a sub.  Removing the freedom to plex helps almost noone.
---
They demoed that the tech doesn't work
---
could not care less about mobile shit, but release something that shitty as on the video needs to have bals of steel tho. respect

Since they nerf the vni they probably didn’t want everyone to just switch to Gilas for anom ratting but they failed to see that unless they change npc aggro having squishier drones won’t change anything when nothing is ever shooting them. Plus Gila can hold 5 full sets so even if you lose one here and there it won’t change anything. It will have a big impact on small scale pvp use because shooting gila drones will be really viable now. Smartbombs were already a killer for anything involving a critical mass of Gilas so it won’t change anything to fleet meta. In reality this nerfs the use of the Gila for abyssal sites and wormholes, both having viable alternatives so no biggie. The Gila will still be a strong dps ship but it’s going to be significantly more fragile and most people will prefer using dps ships that have slightly less dps but are not at risk of losing it.
---
hahahahha yes!

Why do people not realize this is a stress test FOR THE SERVERS...

Yah, I filed a bug report on something similar the other day, blank spaces don't count so some character names are broken right now. Haven't tried but I assume character names like Ma-X or similar are broken too.
---
&gt;  longer and more convoluted than most nullbloc
---
Agree that a perfect solution, it is not.  
---
Which stops vet players how?
---
So long as extractors exist,  injectors will be tied to plex, since thats the measure used to place a value on the time used to create the SP.  You can artificially move the price up and down,  within reason, but it will eventually reach equilibrium in relation to PLEX.
---
It goes surprisingly fast ;-)

volume doesn't equal how stable the faucet (supply) is my dude. If I add 10 items in my store to buy each day and 9 are bought each day, volume will go up. If I continue to add 10 items each day but now people are buy 12 a day, volume will decrease. While the volume may increase/decrease, my faucet might be perfectly stable. I haven't seen the data myself, so I'm assuming OP is stating that the faucet has been stable but prices are going up because of the increased demand (adding 10 items a day but 12 are bought scenario)
---

We do, but its a resounding failure. 
---
They wanted to test 10k players and it could barely hold 2k without severe lag. 
---
Because people hear the words "engine test", their brains shut down, and they start complaining about how it's "a ShIT gaME wiTh baD LAg".
---
So ccp got only 4k dudes for 10k test?

Melt your characters into "Skill injectors", sell said sill injectors, (current sell price is at around 909mil ea) buy PLEX and watch the inflation grow...
---
Can someone TL;DR who this person is and why ccp helped??
---
Players had 2-3 accounts back in the day. Now they have 10+ for Rorqual mining, VNI ratting, SP farming, etc.
---
Multi-account usage has reached an unprecedented scale. For example, the bigger SP farmers have 100+ accounts, all PLEXed. 
---
Well, if they can just add 7000+ Bots to add stress, why even have Players participating? They could've just avoided this rather negative (justified or not) PR.
---
I agree but isn't it a bit inconvenient to have fighters stop 2000km off structure and not budge? They could at least come back and if I'm "tethered" not be able to attack anything. That'd make a bit more sense rather than taking the extra steps to abandon them lol.

If only there were a way to test servers without players. Like if someone invented a way to simulate artificial players, lets call them APs for short. Then they can work on the code so that it's a reasonable quality for the APs. Then they can roll out a demo of the tech, lets call it DT for short. During the DT, real players, RPs, can connect and be blown away at the quality and could really envision a future with this technology.
---
Can we get an update like, every 20 mintuws for those of us at work with current available stock? &lt;3

Hell I wanna see their bookmark folder. I’ve got thousands and I haven’t even been playing long

Interesting. I curious what CCP will do if there are no more PLEX available in the in game market.
---
Pilot visited every single system in Eve, to include wormholes without losing a single ship. Also kept a photo diary of the adventure. It took a decade to complete.
---
Now that we are playing favourites, who do I need to contact for access to restricted space and perhaps T2 BPOs and such?
---
Vets aren't the problem.  It isn't the guy with 100M SP that is extracting that is ruining the market.  It is the cyno alts, PI alts, manufactoring alts, mining alts, VNI alts, camping alts.  Those outnumber the vets 10 to 1.  Extracting makes running 10 or 20 or more alts possible to plex.  Remove extracting and most of these alts will go back to alpha reducing demand for plex.

---
At the start everything I shot dced instead of blowing up. 
---
Well I hope they got the data they needed. Would do it again but the most fun was had on discord general chat.
---
The first thing was disappointing was the nature of the tech itself. [As you can see here (screen taken at the end of the session)](https://www.rooksandkings.com/aeth/aeth.jpg) it's very much single-threaded, cpu-bound, like the present Eve engine. I don't expect it to load all 18 cores (or even 36HT ones) of a 7980xe but I would have hoped for a little more than we already have with Python. The client was a very rudimentary Unreal Engine front-end, with improperly configured menus and basic UI issues (the kind of things that can be fixed in an hour in UE4). 
---
At around the 4k player mark (or less even) a huge number of bots were added to bolster player number. But that's very different to having the networking demands of having 10,000 remote clients interacting. Steam games like Ultimate Battle Simulator already let us pit 20,000 chickens against 5,000 Romans - there's an entire market for what is essentially piling tens of thousands of entities into existing game engines (UE4 and Unity) and calling it a spectacle. 
---
At no point was positional data correctly calculated for the even the initial ~3,000 clients. The framerate was alright (and indeed, under-used many aspects of modern PCs) but there were considerable issues throughout with rubber-banding, positional resets and desync. This is to be expected, of course: but it would have been nice to see it working properly at least at some point so that one might say: here is 1000 clients with correct positional data, at 1500 it breaks and that's a ceiling we're working on. All they showed is what Ultimate Battle Simulator on Steam has done for years. 
---

Put in 2 hours of overtime, buy plex and sell it. make as much as 16 hours of carrier ratting.
---
They have become used to having their game play subsidized by others RL cash. They PLEX their 5-10 accounts and haven't spent any RL cash in years and they get nasty when someone calls them on it. They enjoy the game and want to continue playing it "their way" without any effort or RL cash expenditure. It's sad that this sub has such nasty people in it that can't stand to hear anything that goes against what they want but that's EVE in a nutshell. I have played EVE since 2006 and I have run across some great people. The majority of them are scum though. It's too be expected in a game that has no rules.

Yeah, I was just asking only because it's not something I see very often.... while the LP farming bots in atrons are all over the place. Which is a much harder problem to solve unfortunately.

There's right now a thread on the main page stating that there's almost no plex on the market.

Never give money to someone that is telling you that you will make a profit by giving them money. Now you have learned this lesson. Fortunately for you, there are still plenty of people that haven't, and you now have some blueprints to sell to them.

19/4, once the servers calmed down a bit after the start it worked well enough to play, though i wouldnt say it was smooth lol.
---
I like the ideas, but the first and last one wouldn’t work in my opinion, having a mass limit plus not being able to light a second cyno would make counter dropping almost impossible
---
It was more than 4k, we had like close to 5 when they started adding the AI, and im sure more players joined after that point so.
---
I did exactly that, which is why none of my skill farms are running anymore. The overhead is too much, MCT's have shot up, obviously Plex is extremely expensive, as well as extractors. That's the problem right there, three separate things that can go up to reduce your profitability while you are locked into only one item's price that everyone else is selling as well.
---
I'd say one of the countries of the Balkans peninsula (except Greece) or Belarus/Ukraine.

In addition to Katia's way, there are two other ways to get out there:
---
* Participate in the Alliance Tournament

* Become CCP staff

---
T2 BPOs are no longer generated, so if you want one you will have to buy them.
---
Fucking right? And mindlinks just keep getting more expensive! I saw them for over 100mil in deployment staging T.T
---
Considering there was no way to identify each other, this didn't happen.
---
The EU players and the russian hordes + the dedicated players from the rest of the world who want to be a part of this event. It's ok my friend, don't worry.
---
4k real, 8k bots
---
It was below 200 mil at one point, and you had to negotiate the purchases manually with the seller
---
Ditto. Well, my FPS ranged from 2 to 13 once the missile spam kicked in, but I'm running on a horribly old set-up so that's a me issue, not them. Not a single crash, couple of rubber banding moments, perfectly playable. 
---
My only complaints were that a lot of the bits seemed unkillable (would just soak so many missiles and not go down!), disconnecting or rubber banding players were frustrating robbing you of kills, and the target locking would get distracted by shiny missiles and not let you keep blapping a guy. But they're all gameplay complaints and irrelevant to the test, which seemed to prove the server could handle the load.
---
One add-on: those nerfs only apply to players in a 5k+ member alliance or has good standing with a 5k+ member alliance
---
Q: If I insured ships this month prior to the patch do I get the old or new dread payouts?
---
Moros: 224m, pay 747m
---
Archon: 173.8m, pay 579m
---
Even this very sad amount, i mean why ccp not contacted with powerblocks for getting a full server cta if they want to create stress test?
---
Or they really think that f1-monkeys will test their game without hypnotoad?
---
Nah man, you got to buy high and sell higher
---
That's what I don't understand, you would think with the price rising as much as it has that the incentive to buy plex would go up as well, but I think isk making in this game is so easy that the people who buy plex are pretty much maxed out until the prices go much higher.
---
Eve players are a race apart. 
---
I dod tho
---
The real concerning thing i see is that the avatar can no longer fit 6 haws because of CPU (its over 7-8%) and there is no fitting change on any of the guns
---
Good point, I did not think of counter dropping, although it would still be possible to use a cyno interceptor to to light one on a ping.
---
My shitpost consisted of the following
---
So aside from being a 9/11 advocate and a Saints fan, he's also a white supremacist.
---
CCP when will you respond to this?
---
Most of those alts are omega because they require omega status to perform those functions.   Otherwise, they would be alpha already.  All this accomplishes is a delay for the younger alts to sell again.  Even if you could pull this demand reduction off, reducing omega subscribers helps noone, least of all CCP.
---
Also you underestimate vets.  All of my accounts have at least one toon in 40M+ sp range.  Im not the oldest player by any means. 
---
I was pay monthly by card until ~2009 or so.     
---
I don't think i traded plex on the market until i learned about ETC.
---
And?
---
Where are my domi Chan cat ears!
---
That would be really easy to exploit, goons just set everyone to blue 
---
So many, if not all of these have been mentioned before. I dislike the current cyno meta but I will trying and explain why this isn't an ideal solution.
---
Cyno mass limit. I could get on board with this if it was better thought out. If this were the case you are potentially limiting the 'game' to the group the goes through' and denying the next. The obvious counter arguement is that another cyno will just get lit. This isn't always the case and it can be chaos on comms trying to work out who is lighting the next cyno sometimes.
---
Can't light q cyno if you have a jump timer. This will limit hunters using blops as a means to get their hunter in place. It will reduce content somewhat.
---
Lighting a cyno give you a timer. I don't understand this. Once q cyno is lit you cannot jump any way, and it will be over before the cyno is up.
---
Panic stops cynos. Interesting so if a hunter decloaks you could panic and deny them the cyno ability? This obviously isn't linked to your later option of panic or cyno.
---
Panic or cyno. I would love this BUT know it's not a fair balance. Rorqs mining are strategic assets. If one is tackled a response fleet just be given an option to save it. This allows content and good long term game play. The panic module is designed to give the defenders time to organise and respond or risk posing  their asset,  I think invulnerability is silly and would much rather see it give a tank buff for the period of panic over invulnerability but eh. I don't think this will enable content for both sides.
---
Increase cynos inhib range. Yes i agree. 100km is not very big in the game atm for what is the response meta.
---
Cynos cannot be lit with 400km.. then why ever have a cyno inhib? This would be a very powerful tool for who ever lights first. 
---
Essentially I support you buff to cyno inhib and further review of your mass limit to cynos, the rest all tend to tell me you just want to kill things without a fight, which isn't where the game should focus.
---
Replace Apex with Starbound and I'm in. (There is the Apex race in Starbound though, so take how you want)
---
if you want a T2 BPO, CCP t20
---
Half of these ideas royally fucks over massive Engagements
---
Mass Limits Do as you wont be able to bring supers at All unless they take Gates
---
Lighting multiple cynos and inhib Ranges Do p much the Same
---
Also jump timer Blocks cyno kills p much the strat of having a t3c as first in and then dreads / Fax securing the Sage Passage After the first few got in
---
Sooo most of these ideas actually harm massive content but having a panic active blocking cynos should work out 
---
That's awesome
---
No worries . CCP will seed the market artificially to cover it up.
---
Um... wormholes?

59/9, I didn't get there from the beginning but I was fortunate in it not crashing. As mentioned in another comment, I was disappointed to see that it was very much single-thread bound (you can see CPU usage in the screenshot above; obviously 2.6ghz is just part of the cpu string name; it's overclocked and sub-ambient cooled). Given that we have something that is as similarly bound as the present Python-based engine, and is mostly just a rudimentary UE4 client, I'm not sure what differentiates this from the 'battle simulator' games on Steam. At no point did the netcode/server keep up so no ceiling of working performance was even established. 
---
Idk how one of those people who helped them through null didn’t decide to get that one kill
---
Moros for Real Men (TM)!
---
Then your proposal went into being a huge overkill
---
Pretty much what i was thinking when i  first saw the story
---
if it's so simple why haven't you visited every wormhole system yet?
---
Forgot the WH, you baboon.
---
Have fun finding a wormhole every minute :) 
---
They had to use a bad time slot because it lined up with some Hadean was doing at that time. It was the middle of the work day for the US TZ, so very few of those players were able to participate.
---
They’re why we can’t have a billion Corp bookmarks
---
Alright, how many of those are there?
---
She also traveled to every wormhole system
---
Named after chicom military.
---
Doesn't like nationalistic bullcrap.
---
Thonking...
---
And why would I do that?
---
....I don't think you get it. Supply can be stable but volume decrease because of demand. I put 10 items out, people buy 12. Now my net volume available has gone down 2. If this continues to happen, my volume will dwindle even though I'm putting out the same amount each day. There's no plex on the market because the demand has been higher than the amount of people on a day-to-day avg that pay for plex with real $ are dumping into the game on orders. While the amount of plex being dumped on the market by people who pay for plex with real $ may be stable, the volume has still gone extremely low because it has been ages since the pack sales which dump a ton of plex on the market at a time which will flood the market and help stabilize/reduce the price in the short term.
---
did he hold grid though?
---
But what about T2 insurance? Is it worth buying yet? Or still just a drop in the bucket. 
---
How about not shitting on good things?
---
podee made it her mission to go around getting ruined like some masochistic madman back in the day, and it was a bit of fun.     
---
not everything in the world has to be logical or impressive, sometimes something happens and its a break from the monotony for a change.
---
True, but that still makes it significantly harder to counter drop to warp the caps in 
---
Probably bots if there really is more characters doing the sites.
---
Gotta find something else to do since l4 missions are a no go 
---
2700 or so, I Think? Very few of which are regularly mapped, and some of them with no kspace connections at all. Have you never been to wormhole space? Visiting every wormhole system in the game is insanely hard, as in, I honestly wouldn't think it possible. I was obviously wrong.
---
Did they ever do that?
---
You just described the state of the game. 
---
2600
---
J-space.
---
There are roughly 1.6k j-space systems in new eden. Each wormhole lacks a set connection like in highsec/nullsec. The pilot and friends needed to track down individual wormholes. Consider that each j-space system may only have one or even no entrances from K-space at any given time. Consider that you cannot distinguish between each class of j-space systems before scanning and jumping into a wormhole. Consider that towards the end of the journey, you would have to track down maybe 100 systems with possible entrances from 6k k-space systems with an additional 1.5k j-space systems that you may jump into. How about when you need to find 10/1590 j-space systems. Truly a needle in a haystack situation.
---
That’s great, but we don’t need to celebrate the fact that someone figured out a good way to spend their time.
---
but instead we need to shit on someone for being celebrated over something that doesn't matter to you?
---
HS: 1090 systems
---
LS: 817 systems
---
Null: 3524 systems (minus the ~200 from the CCP area)
---
WH: 2499 systems
---
to get the last 2000 of the 7000 systems, duh
---
PLEX is dead!
---
You missed the entire point of this tech. Its not about the player connections, its about distributing the server load, so unless you have 10,000 systems globally distributed, it doesn't matter how many AI players you have.
---
thing is, even cyno alts and supers would be still confined to the more #elitepvp of the playerbase, the majority of people even in null didnt really need those accounts - even if they did, they were likely a secondary character on their one alt, not their 5th rorq alt
---
The only T2 I got is a hulk, but here it is.
---
Old: 29.5mill, Pay: 98.4mill.
---
New: 27.4mill, Pay: 91.4mill.
---
&gt;he know the Paypings of the warzone with squads of shuttled pulling alts farming 23/7 (in the case of payping, the triad including "Eat Chicken".)
---
Shadow Cartel? I thought that alliance died with their Keepstar?! 
---
I spent about 2 years in FW and never would have left if it was still healthy. Had a good balance of small gang, roams, and big fleets for system pushes all while making a little side change in LP.  
---
Yeah i'm pretty sure that's what is used. a couple neuts in the highs, tackle, prop in the mids, armor/damage in the lows. drones to kill with. don't forget your covops cloak so you can warp cloaked.
---
Why do legit players mainly have to compete with injected rorqs/supers, SP farmers, and bots?
---
I have two astrahus' (astrahusen?) up for clone storage / booster rolling and intend to put up an additional two soon (for different pve clones as well as instant access to an empty clone for roaming). It feels inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as just *not playing* for 18 hours while I wait for my jump clone timer to run out. That is, sadly, what I did before structures, when I jumped to a pve or training clone and there was some op or roam or something going on before the timer ran out - I just didn't play. It was a bummer.
---
If the jump clone timer only applied to jumps where you traveled (or was scaled based on LY traveled or some shit) that would be an improvement for *my* purposes but wouldn't fix the problem of needing multiple astra just to store your clones.
---
savage
---
Here, let me be even more explicit.  Here's an actual item and "right now" prices and the math for 'per minute' isk income.
---
Capital Asymmetric Remote Shield Booster.
---
At time of post:
---
144m buy orders
---
110m sell orders (depth of sell orders, can do ~40 units at an average ~83m)
---
Cost to manufacture, on an unresearched blueprint right now is around 75m, when using multibuy to purchase the inputs from existing Sell Orders.  On a researched print, its around 70m.  Math based on a researched print.
---
1 manufacturing line, 10 days, 2.7b investment in mats, plus the need for a print or bpcs, ~520m in profit dumping to buy orders, ~10 minute time investment.  Some additional cost/overhead is paying couriers, knock off ~20%, say 400m pure manufacturing profit.  40m per MINUTE of invested time, for a single line.  A single character has 10 or 11 lines, and the same 10 minutes feeds 10-11 lines.  Without leaving a station.
---
Now, as you think everyone should, I'll babysit the sell orders.  Lets assume I manage to sell them all within 10 days, and the price doesn't decrease by more than 25%.  Given the volume, the 0.01isking required etc, those are assumptions that greatly favour a very high trading profit. (trading profit in this context meaning every isk over the 83m average I get from buy orders)
---
Lets say i'm quick, and it takes me 5 minutes per day, total, over the next 10 days, to manage that, to stay on top of the order and get my remote shield boosters sold.  However many updates that actually means, it is the time that I'm counting right now.  Thats another 50 minutes over the 10 days.  I'm left with an average sell price of 130m/unit, instead of ~83m/unit.  Great, much more profit, ~2b extra, great!  But once that is dropped into isk/hr, i'm moving from my 40m/minute, to 80m/minute, but having to spend the next 10 days updating orders instead of "playing eve".
---
Even if every opportunity offered double the isk per minute, that still doesn't mean that not playing the 0.01isk game makes someone a Numbnuts.  :)
---
For you, that is missed ISK, and I completely get where you are coming from.  To me, that is quality of life.  Realistically, as I said, I'd drop half onto the buy orders (20 units at roughly 95m average, 500m profit), list the remaining 20 at 125m, in 2 days, with 2 order updates, dropping to 110m if needed (another 20x @ 110m [worst casing my numbers here] is another 800m profit) and get 1.3b profit in 12 minutes work.  Cut the 20%, thats 1.1b profit.
---
That would look like "Numbnuts #1" to you, but would deliver me 1.1b profit, at 91m/minute active game time.  Higher than regularly updating the orders.  Without the pain of station trading, 0.01 isking, or anything else.  Open market, multibuy, paste the list, courier contract the mats to a build centre, courier contract the outputs back to Jita.  Everything in between is passive.
---
And knowing that someone exists who does things this way allows you (or anyone who bumps into a mass manufacturer), to offer to make the deal.  I'd cheerfully sell you all 40 units @ 110m.  You have 30m of trading profit available if you want to babysit orders.  But I'm now earning 1.6b, or 40m/unit, off a single blueprint line at roughly 1.6m isk per hour for my manufacturing slot.  And I have 11 slots.  Per manufacturing character.  I can scale as long as I can find things to build and people to haul stuff to/from the build centre.
---
**bold** Your "Numbnuts #1", as I indicated, is just someone else playing a different game to you.
---
Now, this happens to be a stellar candidate right now to build, but there are other options.  In fact, right now, the blueprint would cost you 49m to buy off the market.  The single build of 40 units, or even only 10 and dump them straight into buy orders at 110m, would earn you 350m profit AFTER paying for the BPO!
---
There always is items like this, despite you claiming as a manufacturer you never find them. I have never once run out of things to build before I have run out slots to build them in or liquid to invest in mats.  I took a building break and came back recently and my margins are 2-3x what they used to be.  5% is okay. Some things right now are up to 30%.  Getting into T2, it is more like up to 50% margin.
---
Same rough math above works with, for example:
---
*italics*  As people are usually scared of giving away the profitable things and it makes informed conversation difficult, I'll list a few I am not going to build that have great manufacturing and trading margins right now, but to be fair these would require researched prints.
---
Defender I launchers
---
Rapid Torpedo II launchers
---
Heavy Warp Scambler I
---
Said it before, I'll say it again.
---
Any FW post that doesn't address FW missioning and the Warzone Control tier system misses so much of the problem that it's not worth reading.
---
I could not give less of a shit about Ventures in plexes when the trickle of LP they generate has its value primarily dictated by mission blitzers and when the warzones ebb and flow in control in waves dictated more by market forces tied to LP value than in response to player interaction of any sort.
---
They're not the *only* issues in FW that could do with reform, but they *are* the issues that, until resolved, will mean that warzones cater more to krabs than to PVPers.
---
It’s about 64.6B isk... Not nearly enough to never have to worry about it again.
---
Unironic working as intended 
---
I guess the drone mids were a little redundant
---
This would in no way, shape or form solve the botting issue. 15$ cost to generate hundreds per month isn't a bad deal.
---
What this would instead do is shut down Eve's industry, remove f2p as a viable option and do all kinds of untold irreparable damage. I'm not sure why you think Plex is not the cause of botting or alts especially with rorqs as your prime example. Plex has been in the game for years and the vastly increased cost of 30 days of game time with it has done absolutely nothing to deter Rorqs. Instead your issue is the primary mode of income generation being what it is. Removing plex for gametime though? No.
---
use a real image host
---
i think the deal with it is that someone had a project, a personal project, and he spend 10 years of his game life trying to fulfill that. btw he also visited every landmark in a system/planet and made a photo documentary of it. as yourself it wouldnt even cross my mind but...its a sandbox and this is on the same level as the guy who infiltrates a alliance and ruins them, eve is about personal stories, motivations and thats what makes it great. some ppl are experts at mining and enjoy it, marketeers, meta gamers, pyfa warriors, newbie chat helpers, fucking magick bus mike its all eve and its beautifull! battles get the headlines most of the time, fleet commanders are seen with awe but this is just another chapter of eve where everyone can be his own hero and good for him/her. with all the bs in eve in the core eve online is the most beautifull game ever made...

p.s. to all your capsuleers who want to see all wh systems join MCAV CAUSE WE ARE RECRUITING!!!!!!!!

o7 from your gracious recruiter strovolos!
---
I love how people don't get the idea that so many mechanics are involved in very various activities, and screwing mechanics A,B,C to nerf activity X would bring very massive and often negative changes to activities Y,Z,T. Only group that would benefit from changes you proposed would be wormholers. Everybody else would be massively screwed over, and not just for PvE activities, but also PvP would become a cancer as well.
---
Sounds like a good place to retire, for cost if nothing else.
---
Apples and oranges. Go
---
It will go 3-4 bill until 2021... 
---
Thank you for the feedback! Some of the changes do seem overkill from what you said. What I was going for was that instead of "Suddenly 50 supers drop on field" you would need to separate them into groups on pings.
---
That's really awesome. Great job Katia Sae. Really cool! 
---
What basis do you have for your hypothesis that supply is stable? Player numbers are down and if I am understanding 'volume' right, it's sales volume, which is down as well.
---
Should let the character go visit jove space for a bit
---
why do people not realize this is a joke...
---
i have obviously touched a nerve somewhere so let me clarify my intentions.  the "numbnuts" analogy was referring to a specific instance where one person is costing several others profits.  i'm not saying his approach or play style is wrong, i'm merely pointing out that his tactic is flawed with the next cycle update the other trader does.  if there was any malice intended it was towards the tactic, not the player.
---
everyone does what they enjoy doing in eve, i hope.  i am no trade guru but i got a little bored and decided to try something new.  this post is a way for me to share what i observed and learned over the month long process in the hopes that someone might learn something or be encouraged to try something new themselves.  there is not a lot of info out there about trading in eve and the info that is out there is generally geared more towards more veteran players.  [delonewolf](https://www.youtube.com/user/delonewolf) has some really great content that he provides on youtube as far as market info and explanations but for the most part, traders dont wanna talk about trading because they dont want more competition.  as i told someone else, players who are successful tend to stay with the game so a little assist can go a long way.  if i help someone do what they want to do and improve the player base then i dont mind sharing my experience.
---
i understand you were trying to explain why someone would do something but i was just trying to point out that the tactic as a trader is not a good one to do and the fault lies with both #1 for thinking price matters that much to buyers on the market and for #2 not having some patience with the order.
---
as far as manufacturing...mine is for alliance markets and contracts.  i outgrew high sec markets for my version of industry years ago.  if you can find buy orders that are acceptable to your profit expectations and are having fun doing so, then i encourage you to continue doing whatever you are doing even if its a headache for someone else.  :)
---
my apologies if i ruffled feathers.  hopefully this clarifies my intent. :)
---
&gt; CCP would have to lower the price but they would more than make up for it with subscription increases.
---
You base this on what, exactly? An account with omega is an account CCP turned a near subscription level profit on. Removing from the total account number simply lowers what they make. I can tell you, directly, without 500 plex you would *lose* total accounts. In fact you agree with this assessment because you're saying it would end people mass boxing Rorquals. You're arguing against the very core of the point you're trying to make.
---
Пидор
---
They have never done that (to my knowledge), and likely never will. They feel pretty strongly about not interfering with the market.
---
It's the same reason that if you lost a ship in some way that wasn't your fault (due to a bug or whatever), you only get back the hull and the modules that didn't drop.
---
Krusty Krab Unfair

Because ive seen dozens of people talking about how bad this went, and what a failure of a "game demo" it is.

Hard part is finding someone to fight since the games pretty barren gl lmao

If you insist.
---
What happened with the Drake's?
---
Oh I didn't even scroll down that far. Missed that they weren't tcs.
---
I used to run bot farms + multibox farms for living (in other games, not eve). The conversion of said games to a similar model to Eve's Plexing hurt my business because it offered *legitimate competition*. It was far more lucrative with the $15 / mo barrier than it was when people could instantly obtain in game currency without the risk or worry of being banned. You are pulling this "False statement" bullshit out of your ass. You have no clue what you are talking about.
---
or at least a site with a working SSL cert lmao
---
90 day cards for 300 mill before that ;)
---
Breachers rock... and of course the faction frigs. 
---
another day, another 200IQ suggestion on how to balance the game
---
Plexing has existed nearly a decade by the way.
---
"Just make more money."
---
2head
---
I havent estimated how much isk they make other than that it is "a lot" or people wouldnt be doing it.
---
I have run level 5 missions and while I probably didnt do it as efficiently as he does it, it wasnt close to 1.3b/h. There is a strong dependency on LP. I wouldnt say its impossible, but I am sceptical. If what he says is correct, whats the problem of having a plex cost 10b? Thats not even an hour a day. In china, where botting was even less enforced than here, plex was at 4.5b a few years ago.
---
&gt;Super ratting is suicidal and stupidly expensive for the average player to get into. The same goes for rorquals.
---
Its not the average player that does it.
---
&gt;I'm not even going to argue with you about botting, because that argument is just stupid.
---
Im not sure what the argument would be. There is no reason to assume bots dont consume plex and are willing to pay a lot more than most.
---
It really started getting bad around assigning drones, and isboxer bomber fleets, but got worse with current injector-fueled turbokrabbing.
---
There's nothing wrong with umbrellas. But most people are unwilling / unable to put the necessary thought/resources into outplaying them 
---
Like every service provider in the industry.  
---
I can't count the times I've heard our COO say, "The salesman catch the meat. Then they throw the meat over the fence and Sales Support figures out how to accomplish it. Even if it's something we've never done before."
---
Selling a concept and hoping it will work - is very very common in B2B. 
---
"Resounding failure" based on what information? They needed to see how the system distributed load across multiple processors/servers. I'm sure 10k would have been "more data" but with 2k players I guarantee they got what they needed determine viability.
---
It’s also a bit inconvenient for Krabs to be able to insta warp off as soon as a neut enters local.  Just adapt bud.  
---
FW is pretty barren you mean?
---
So, normal numbers?
---
Supply and command
---
I'm sure behind the scenes tech is cool. I just thought the actual fighting looked hilarious.  
---
Yeah I would prefer minmatar frigs,  but in terms of doctrine the breacher just feels like a Kestrel with less range and volly + the need to manage drones.
---
One idea I've had was a new cyno for supers.  I'm not sure what to do with it but having a seperate cyno would open up a way for CCP to balance how supers join a fight compared to regular caps.  Sort of like how the covert cyno has less restrictions than the regular cyno.
---
The people that buy PLEX from CCP (which is what ultimately matters, not who buys on the market in game) pay for PLEX with real money.  The more Isk or value they get per dollar, the better.  This is not a situation where inflation is high, it is a situation where a specific asset is sky high.  The prices of other things relative to Isk have not changed that much.  If you give me twice as much Isk I can pretty much buy twice as many capitals as before.
---
&gt; People who buy PLEX for ISK are generally going to be doing so in order to acquire a certain amount of ISK, because they want to buy something cool on the in game market (usually a ship).
---
As a member of a newbro corp since 2014 that is now quite large, I see far more people buying injectors than ships as far as value is concerned.  A lot of people inject into carriers/supers/rorqs and in every situation the ship itself is far cheaper than the SP to use it.  Last I checked, the increase in PLEX is outpacing the increase in injector prices (which makes sense considering so many say SP farming is currently unprofitable).
---
The idea that PLEX being worth more as valued in game assets would mean less PLEX purchases is against everything I have observed in life.  When a currency decreases in relative value, exports tend to increase, even though a foreigner could now spend less and get the same amount as before.
---
You may be confusing the purchase of PLEX from CCP with real world currency and end users purchasing PLEX and consuming them.  
---
old
---
&gt; The first thing was disappointing was the nature of the tech itself. As you can see here (screen taken at the end of the session) it's very much single-threaded, cpu-bound, like the present Eve engine. 
---
I believe "the tech" they were testing is the server, not the client, which as you said is rudimentary here.
---
It wasn't looking all that impressive from the server side though with the amount of desyncs. Besides even with 3k of real players i doubt that they really reached the same amount of server load EVE experiences with the drone spam and all... But maybe there was more going on behind the scene? Would be interesting to see some kind of report with conclusions from their team.
---
Maulus Navy issue. You can easily tackle them no matter how many stabs they fit, and if you jump into the gate they are camping you should be able to tackle them before they get aligned and warp if you are fast and lucky. 
---
blyat
---
Fucking what? Do you?! This has nothing to do with databases, it's all to do with how CCP have implemented their search functionality.
---
Databases don't give a fuck about "Needs to be longer than 3 characters".
---
Maybe thats what CCP has intended, let the system kill itself. Of course there is a price to pay in getting rid of real players as well.

I don't think it was supposed to be anything great on the client side but the fancy tech is on the server side. I think 
---
&gt; First launched in 2003, *Eve* has remained unique among MMOs for a  number of reasons. One of them is the fact that the entire world,  **excluding China**, plays together in the same shared universe.  
---
Can we please go back to this
---
They were not testing the client side so there is no reason to complain about it, they were interested in server side performance.
---
And to think, you have accomplished far less.
---
Yea fw is even worse
---
They have in the past said that if things ever got too out of hand with the PLEX market they would consider interfering.
---
0/3. I'm sure I scored a lot of hits but nothing exploded :-(
---
I suppose the first question is how you intend to fight? I'm guessing each of you starts out in a separate plex, maybe even in separate systems, and then you blob on whatever unfortunate soul decides to come by? If so, then you need something with staying power, enough to live long enough for at least one other pilot to come by and "third party" on it.
---
To this end, try out a dual-rep Incursus. They don't do well by themselves because in a dps/cap race they usually lose, but they're super trolly and engageable and cheap. 
---
Well, they help keep the devs employed. 
---
Because primarily plex is suffering from inflation. Normal modules/ships dont. So you dont need as much plex anymore. Combine that with increased consumption and you have the current situation.
---
Somebody needs to tell this man about capital plates and the fact moros don't have drones anymore.
---
Wtt tiamat for the mittianis corpse
---
The emphasis on multi-accounting is also one of the steep barriers to entry for new players, or casual players. 
---
Remember when plex used to be under 2b? Oh wait thats few days ago. 
---
Can't stress enough how wonderful of a response this is. Might as well start calling real players "Rogue APs" in his post.
---
If they want to promote the game to new players, but keep the market under control, we'll see good discounts directly on subs, instead of future plex sales.

"With 3852 real players joined by AI connected clients, we saw 10,412  ships battling it out in deep space at GDC 2019. "  [KEK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVFd46qABi0)
---
THey did get 10k players. 
---
But it was completely unplayable at 2k. 
---
Im not saying its dead in the water. But as a test for 10k players they obviously overshot their mark.
---
Could this be applied to Ascendancy implants or are the bonus's different?
---
How much?
---
Big surprise, it wasn't the savior that half of the EVE community has been hawking this to be.  Almost like a ton of people warned you about this and got downvoted to hell...
---
And yet, when 1600 clients, including bot clients were all firing torps at the same time, it didn't shut down.
---
it was all just D A T A C O L L E C T I O N
---
The only thing picking one empire over the other gives you is the ability to fly that faction's frigate immediately, rather than taking like 15 minutes to train into it.
---
Honestly, it doesn't matter what empire you pick.
---
"The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like… Victory. "
---
Why sell when you can just hold it longer?
---
Which is what would make it the true endgame situation. 
---
well CCP's best interest is to keep plex prices high.  so anything that takes down plex prices is going to hurt CCP.  Which means that any suggestion here is probably not going to happen.  Which also means that this is all conjecture, so i don't actually think any of this will be implemented, nor am i willing to spend a ton of time working out the details for a suggestion that has zero chance to be implemented.  
---
That said, i don't think i'm underestimating vets.  There are plenty of them at high SP values.  But .... they are dwarfed by the people multi boxing 10, 20, 50 accounts.  It only takes 5M or so skill points to run a VNI or barge well.  It takes almost nothing to run cyno alts, it takes nothing to run market alts.  Why do you have cyno alts or market alts or miner alts or VNI alts at 40M+ sp?  A 40M toon can be turned into 8 VNI alts that make isk around the clock, or a fleet of covetors that suck up ore.
---
hi, sorry to hear you've been in a coma since 2005
---
but it's 2019 now, procedural generation is not a thing that people get excited about
---
петух
---
You just paid for a 1.3 billion ISK lesson in why you should never pay attention to Jita local (or any trade hub local, for that matter). Now come to wormhole space and farm some sleepers and gas, you'll make the money back in decent time without having to sell your soul to the nullsec blocs.
---
Ventures are aids I hate trying to fight for the zone and being forced to either run a dual scram ship to kill ventures and give up range control or to fly the MNI.
---
Especially when the people who defend these ventures can just show up in whatever the hell they want and now I have to 1v1 in a dual scram ship with no range control and surprise surprise it goes bad a lot of times and having to do the reship game 1v1 roaming is turbo aids.
---
maybe because traders are not trading plex at Jita under nonsense taxes that much? Look at perimeter, plenty of plexes there
---
As far as I know the original galaxy was procedurally generated and then edited.
---
Yep! Just different costs and value outcomes. Would need to start over in a way, but there's a very real benefit to mixing ascendancy and WS implants on cost/value.
---
To anyone taking notes, this is 100% how to blow a bubble even bigger to see if it will pop. 
---
oh look sootsia at it again
---
None of his AT frigate friends will ever leave small FW beacon again pepehands
---
The only reason I gave my brothers for picking an empire was so that we all spawned in the same region with our new alpha accounts. Other than that, it hasn't mattered for a long time (other than roleplay I suppose)
---
Pick The one with the nicest haircuts!
---
Honestly though, Any Empire is fine, Just pick the one You like : )
---
It is meant to be a process over the next couple years. They never said it was ready for release. 
---

I was dissapointed with the timezone factor. Judging by the email that was sent out, it was around 3:40am AEST my time, when I would have been long asleep. 
---
Nobody really does, not even russians.
---
They got around 3.5 real people then they added bots. 
---
And CCP used 42 as the seed
---
It's about Goryn, but for some reason it could apply to every single entity that does smallgang right now. Really gets the noggin joggin. Maybe it has something to do with the current state of smallgang roaming, can't really wrap my head around it.
---
HELLO THIS IS YOUR ONE HOUR REMINDER THAT THIS THREAD IS A THING M8
---
lol, 9-4R would have been a 10k people battle easily if the servers were known to be able to handle such battles.
---
I mean even if it were something that was pre-generated like a second w-space galaxy just remove all the special mechanics and include moon mining.   
---
What are your thoughts about a second or i guess really it would be a third galaxy that must be discovered over time and is devoid of npc and completely dedicated to player construction of gates and stations.   
---
I guess i just really like the idea of it being procedural generated so that the map of systems and resources could not be data mined. 
---
Yeah im pretty sure your correct about that.
---
CCP did not do this test. So no, CCP is not to blame for this decision.
---
They will do it. Not by actually artifically seeding, but the next PLEX sale will do it naturally. 
---
yeah agreed, i was making a joke anyway. its kaai btw if you didnt realised. Yeah i think thats the main reasob ppl are leaving, small gang/nano is such in a bad spot atm i just have more fun with others games then. It was also out of questions to become a nullbears and Fw is dead. Unsubbed it is then :) Rust is my new toy :) 
---
Fuckin gotme lmao
---
But it’s eve. We’re all dicks
---
Because a cyno alt requires omega status, as do capital construction alts, (super)capital pilot alts, good market alts, and even PI alts, and injectors haven't always existed,  so you used the SP somewhere, and some of us never melted them down since you never know when your cyno alt may benefit from perfect recon skills.  Either that or farming alts to sell on character bazaar.
---
If you increase the minimum sp, the same thing happens. Truly needed alts that require omega will continue to sub and either farm for character bazaar or accumulate the new minimum, then we're back to normal.  You do realize you cannot light a cyno, regardless of sp, unless you have an omega sub, right?
---
In the meantime, the loss of supply will send injector prices higher, convincing more vets to cash out while its good, and skill farming alts to continue to the threshold since it makes a profit over your sub again.  Eventually, enough people get to your 25M sp threshold or whatever it is,  supply meets demand, and the equilibrium price is whatever point plexing the accounts is no longer worth it.  We are back to today's situation, and still tied to PLEX.
---
Agree.  IDK what OP is smoking but there are probably only two points I would agree with: 1) Remove FW missions 2) heavy penalties for non-aligned structures.
---
I also hate capitals but cyno jamming all of FW isn't the answer and is probably a topic for another thread. I'd be happy with a spool up time for a cap jump so I can GTFO if I wanna blue-ball caps.
---
I've been in FW for years now. Overall, it seems decently healthy with small-gang pvp so I can see why other things are a higher priority.
---
If anything it's very similar to Duke Nukem Forever since it's partially happened already. SC has been in development for so long that some of the early stuff had to be scrapped and redone, so you basically get a game that is always out of date by the time the newest part is finished. Hence why Duke Nukem Forever felt like a game that should have come out 10 years ago, that's exactly what it was.

Trig T2 are indeed coming, it's obvious from the trig transmition. What you're missing is that, just like the Praxis, all trig ships are extremely niche ships that you use for very specific jobs. Combine that with the megafarming that goes on in highsec, which is constantly pushing prices down, and you have a market which will be on a permanent drop. Look at the prices for anything abyss-related, it's always going down because few people actually use and lose the stuff. There will be a tiny spike in material costs and a massive cost for skills and BPCs at first, and then over the next couple months prices will plummet because the novelty of the new shiny toy will wear off.
---
They call that being a team player 
---
This is the wrong mindset to have about FW space. FW features should not be designed to discourage PVP between FW and non-FW pilots.  I've had loads of good fights over the years with non-FW people in plexes, over structure timers, or just randomly in the WZ.  
---
What causes problems are mechanics that actively punish FW groups for participating in FW content.  Like FW players taking sec status hits for attacking "neutrals" who enter a FW plex.  Or FW players taking huge standings hits for using smartbombs, thereby disabling a major tactical options that our non-FW opponents use freely.

Also i just noticed that we koreans also have a similar slang, its wd-40! A lubricant that we use it as a meaning to master-solution for every problems. Cuz  every koreans go to army, and they use wd-40 for every problems there.

Officially it still is this way but VPNs exist.

I honestly wish they had just removed insurance from caps/supers or dropped insurance completely from nullsec. Why the fuck would insurance pay you out if you're in the wild fucking west of space inhabited by pirates and void of empire presence?

Tech 2 Cyno inhibs - longer range, a bit tankier, etc.  Requires Cyno V and Anchoring IV to deploy.
---
Add a new high-slot module for ships: Cyno-Silencer
---
Takes a high-power slot, moderate PG/CPU consumption. Needs Cyno IV to use. 
---
Target a T2 Cyno Inhib, trigger the module and it silences any active cyno's within 150km (or whatever). Silenced cyno ships still retain all the usual immobility as if the cyno was currently lit. 
---
Has a 2-3 minute cooldown.
---
Must be at LEAST 30km away from the Inhib, but no more than 75km away.
---
I.e. the BLOPs team needs to coordinate carefully who/where/when will deploy the inhib(s) and what order the team will use silencers. 
---
This might even add to the sub-cap role in big capital fights - doing area denial ops in various places. 
---
I think, instead of nerfing a gameplay by removing it we should think "how to nerf this gameplay by adding a new gameplay" the super umbrella do not need a nerf, a fix or anything but a better counter, seeing Dread insurance payout goes down is a bad idea for me, if anyone want to really hurt an alliance who actively use super/titan on everything, dreadbomb should be the answer, look how hard D-W beacon hit goonswarm, I would love to see that kind of stuff happening more often 
---
Ahh ok
---
If you're tackled just press the cyno button?
---
well 9-4 also had alot of people that came to watch since pgl made that 1m dollar fight post
---
LOL
---
But kudos on being ballsy.
---
Because insurance is incentive to take risk and have ships explode?
---
Christ, people like you probably refuse to undock with less than 40 fax.
---
Well, the second biggest battle (without PGL on media) is not that far behind 9-4
---
*sigh* I want to say I think its okay to be white
---
But sometimes... its just not.
---
I wouldn't worry... the good thing about PLEX is that it's supply is infinite and the production cost nothing. That's the market of pixels you deal with in a game. Players will just use cash to get it. 
---
i do it out of love
---
Problem is that it won't impact them since people who multibox 20 Rorqs make way more ISKs than what they need to sub. Only people who will be impacted will be those who don't have a farming setup composed of either 10+Rorqus/Super/WH Dread. 
---
That's what people don't understand, boxers don't give a fuck, the ones who will be harmed and will leave the game are not the ones killing them, and TQ will just end up as the chinese server. That's what is going to happen.

Incorrect, at Fanfest about 6 or 7 years ago former Chief Economist Eyjolfur had a PLEX chart on the projector and pointed out when they intervened.

You can bet your ass they are thinking about intervening right now. They only do so when PLEX investment demand rises (as opposed to regular consumption demand).

---
OK thanks guys! I think i'll try and get a battle cruiser.
---
Wat? 
---
there is definitely way more than 165k plex dude
---
cultists vs autists would be an epic fight to be seen indeed
---
I mean yeah, ccp produced it.
---
If you think the other guy with a stack is gonna sell, you should sell now and buy back after the price goes down some
---
I don't personally infer, or see how you infer, a preference towards risk aversion in the statement that you're criticizing.
---
i mean, there are almost no fw players left, most just quit or went to other areas of space because ccp doesn't give a fuck for so long. You'd have a hard time finding even one or two dudes to run, let alone a base to support them.
---
ok, will check it out
---
join v0ltron, no hot pockets and not massive like g00nz
---
According to sell orders on evepraisal, the forge makes up 85% of the plex on the market, and is the price driver. 
---
You're like the guy that claims there is more than one diamond distributor compared to DeBeers. It doesn't fucking matter how many other markets there are when The Forge controls that much of the market share.
---
k
---
Yup,
---
and I don't think piracy in these zones can be considered a problem too, because piracy is dead as well for the most part.  
---
Snuff can't be considered a pirate group , they are part of the mainstream meta.   
---
And I don't think that recent changes and proposals will fix this situation. It simply looks like they will develop the game further down the road of big blobbing null sec alliance fights.
---
So, small gang fights as well, already dead.
---
And there it is... sadly.
---
We said/wrote this too many times.
---
I remember seeing in another thread awhile ago that their lucrative BPC price led people to farm the hell outta them, therefore slowly filling the market and decreasing the price.
---
but that was back when people actually logged in :P
---
Well, that’s not the entirety of it. The markets have been in an odd state lately where the prices of some things (like PLEX) have risen drastically. On the other hand, other items have fallen dramatically while others have remained relatively stable.
---
PLEX is extremely unique in its functions, so using it as a sample of the economy as a whole is not the best idea. Recent dramatic rises in PLEX price very likely show a very different scope of player attitudes and desires than an equally steep increase anywhere else. 
---
Without having much empirical data on what happens to PLEX once it’s made, there are a range of possibilities that could be happening here. 
---
?????
---
One of Gila fleets' biggest weakness is vulnerability to smartbombs. 
---
The amount of people in this thread claiming they'll quit if plex goes too high is laughable to me.   
---
Anyone with a big boy job should be using the 12 month sub with real dollars, how is your time worth so little?
---
Well this is exciting!
---
for me it was the Nidhoggur , something about the flying shed i loved
---
Risk is an inherent part of this game, you are at at least some risk whenever you undock (and as your scam experience shows, sometimes without even undocking).  The better way to think about it is: how do I learn to make enough isk to offset the costs of the inevitable ship losses and my mistakes? 
---
left out the "and friends"
---
It pushes out the unproductive players.
---
Rorqual and Carrier multiboxers are far from it.
---
That's how players reduce risk in null, similar to closing or critting the hole in wspace.  It is not an inherent advantage to null itself.  That also means you're now committed to grid for 10 minutes;  if your side doesn't win the escalation, you die, and the other guy could have his own backup.
---
To be clear, I'm not saying k-space is super-risky, or risker than j-space, but oversimplifying things to "just warp off in your perma aligned super or audo dockup your pinged vnis" oversimplifies things for null, just as saying "lock up your hole and no one can attack you" oversimplifies things for j-space.  There's holes in both of those plans for "absolute safety", and the hunters of the respective areas take advantage of them.  Pretending that one is way riskier than the other, as part of taking some sort of superior position, is self-delusion.  
---
Both k-space and j-space are shockingly safe with the correct precautions.
---
That PLEX came from suspended Accounts afaik.
---
Yeah :( but they used to have their own server to go to....it needs to be that way again. 
---
yea, i have 6 accounts (and about 10 more alphas that i can spin up).  They basically operate for free right now because i can extract them. e.g. there is no cost to me to have a cyno alt or 120 slots for manufacturing or 90 planets for PI.  That is stupid.  Extraction makes sense for older characters to remove SP or move around skills to new character.  It does not make sense to provide free alts to people once they reach a point. If you want to run 5 omega accounts, they should cost the same as a new player trying to skill up.  By running them for free people are driving up the plex prices so that new players don't stick with the game.  
---
And yes, moving it up to a 25M threshold would just push the problem into the future, but isn't that better than just letting eve die now?  any solution even if flawed somehow is better than doing nothing.  
---
They still do, Serenity is online

When I was in HS, I aw videos of people ratting in "super dangerous" 0.0 space and fell in love with the Thanatos. I thought it was the best looking ship in the game, but could never fly one.
---
Then one day, I undocked from buying some skills in Jita. I saw numbers were a bit high, but paid it no attention. Then suddenly, a freaken Nyx undocks and everyone is shooting it. My mind went from "what is that" to "holy fucking shit that looks cool." I wanted to fly it, but being a HS indy player, I had to hang up the dream of flying it.
---
A year later after joining my first null sec group and learning how to fleet, I get hotdropped by a Leviathan. Although I died, I fell in love with that ship. At this point, I was so use to admiring ships i will never fly, so I just added it to the Nyx. 
---
Now, I have built/flown all 3. Had to learn skills for other doctrines to serve the alliance/coalition better, so took a while. Once I undocked, eve career felt semi complete. No KM to report yet though :)
---
Nice gag fit. The festival launcher makes it awesome.
---
If only servers were in different countries, a company could rent them, lets say, pay per minute per cpu core. Then they can run bots from them to connect to their main server. I know this tech doesn't exist yet, but man it would be awesome.
---
That's a balance problem by itself though, because of the effect on supply and demand, not to mention, it doesn't actually break the link with PLEX as you proposed.  
---
If injectors jump 50% relative to PLEX, then running a skill farm on my alts goes from barely isk-negative before other income skills, to about +1.7B/month AFTER plexing the account.  I now get a guaranteed income on top of plexing the account;  with guaranteed passive income only requiring a certain SP threshold, people will likely roll more alts rather than continue to train veteran toons (except for maybe that one that you really liked), since the second account is practically paid for.  If that margin goes down, maybe they don't open the new accounts, but they sure as hell strongly consider extracting to pay for pvp.  And meanwhile, everyone who was skill extracting between 6M and 25M sp realizes that if they get to that 25M threshold, they start making stupid passive income, perhaps enough to pay for the injectors or training time to get there.  
---
You can't unlink the two.
---
So it failed to hit the 10,000 people they wanted, struggled at 1.5k, died at 3k and they where forced to add more bots to push it to 12k to test the server performance? Sadly I'm not surprised. Seems like it needed another 3-6 months worth of development and hint dropping to get the community interested at a large scale to bring the desired 10,000 actual players. 
---
Adding the extra bots would of not done much to test the back end I would of thought as the main issues are disconnects, rubber banding and desync which would not happen with bots as, in theory, they would be originating from the same location or something unless they used PAs setup/infrastructure to have them connecting from their offices too instead of just Iceland.
---
Saying all that, it seems to of gone better than I expected with more people than I expected so that's a good thing. Now lets see where they go with this, if it worked for them or if it goes on the shelf like so many other things, there is a nice spot next to Dust I hear, hope it doesn't end up there, I honestly don't as there is promise

The CSM representatives are elected by direct democracy.  It's "representative" in the sense that there are representatives that speak for voters, but it's not representative of anything but the largest blocs.  True representative democracies like the US have representatives from specific subsections to ensure broader representation for this exact reason.
---
I remember when plex didn’t exist. It was 60 day gtc’s and they sold for 600-700. And you could buy and fit a domi for 60 million. 
---
Also when fleet fits were max range and just enough tank to survive an ape doomsday and people where just starting to pioneer logi chains. Also when capital ships were special
---
Lol it's even worse! Hahaha CCP, good one!

I can counter every limitation with another alt....

I have 96 alts.

Exactly. A lot of new players who come in as alpha's have had the goal posts pushed back 20% in the last month. Despite telling new players it's better to invest RL cash, many feel like they have to earn it that way, or don't have the RL cash to invest on a game with the high learning curve.

A 60 second delay in cyno activation is all that is needed to fix the majority of hot drop problems that people are complaining about. 
---
To be fair, if ships were cheaper to build to begin with, we could just remove insurance altogether and by so doing remove a considerable isk faucet from the game.
---
Was a fun ship! I got a kill boner got baited got fucked got laughed at and then congratulated on undocking it. I look forward to welping my next one! 
---
I wonder if ill get shitstack for this :thinking:
---
if you're talking about x47 i prob forgot that one. Was thinking 6vdt
---
A directed module that targets the cyno ship and works like ECM for cynos?
---
well as i said multiple times: on the medium run, the plex prize is nearly 100% elastic. noone will spend more (total) $ just vecause you get more isk. you might spend earlier, but once the initial effect is over, no more spending is done. so the prize of pnex will always be 100% related to the isk available
---
&gt;This will be highly controversial, but cyno jam FW space. You can gate it (which would provide more chances for content) but it will stop third parties from cap blobbing (cough cough snuff) and provide some relief from cap 
---
Supported.
---
then the question is, why not simply just do it in house with 20,000 bots and do an apocalyptic worst case scenario? Then test with 3,000 bots, then 7, 10, 12, 15 and 18k bots? That way the servers can be hit by different scaling numbers, adjustments can be made and go from there. It may not be perfect but obviously the live test was far from perfect too. The advantage of testing with a bot army is that if shit goes hilariously south, no-one on the outside knows and if it goes really well you can share it to us  for good publicity for when it's ready for a mass test of real people, first starting with low expectations for numbers, say 2k, then a week later or so go for as many as want to try it out. Add an incentive of say 250,000-500,000 SP on your main account and go from there? Some will do it without the reward incentive, but larger groups will try it out for a good enough incentive if numbers are required
---
I'm convinced it was done on purpose to make everyone think eve is actually pretty good 😉
---
And probably Nalvula and the other big lowsec fight... 
---
The issue wasnt incentive, the issue was due to Hadeon's schedule this had to be done at mid-work day for the US TZ, which hugely cut down the number of players able to attend.
---
&gt;CCP are aware of the issue let's just hope they work on it
---
No doubt they apply the "wait and see"-approach that has worked so well in the past. (/s)
---
This doesn’t discourage fw vs neut at all? They just won’t get LP for neut kills just like now. 
---
Don't remember nalvula being nearly as big. The 2nd x47 one was apparently 5k ish and 6vdt was like 4k something 
---
Because they dont care about the results YOU are seeing, they are looking for the results on their servers.
---
They arent the ones that will get pushed out first. They are responsible for the rise. Legit players with 1-2 accounts that actually "play" the game will go first.
---
Man you are just grasping for every straw you can. Whats your problem with this, it was a successful test, they tested what they wanted to. Not like you paid money to do this shit, get over it.
---
Oh I agree and honestly no matter what they did it was going to be bad but it could indeed of been at a more convenient time or done twice 12 hours apart so everyone had a chance to assist 
---
but it is also an isk sink. which is good.
---
of course the low risk (and even more, high bottability) is bad
---
SO SO envious! CONGRATS Katia Sae!
---
worked it out to be about £1000 worth of isk
---
Watch the lag.
---
that would take some effort
---
HOLY HELL!
---
I hope you got some cool kills before it went down in glorious fire
---
Yeh but the Breacher has a Tank bonus. Dual MASB breacher is unbreakable by T2 frigs. 
---
For minmatar, Tracking disruptor slashers are awesome, they come in Armour and Shield variety. 
---
Complement a few of them with Arty or AC rifters and you are pretty good.
---
Lol what an idiot.
---
You apparently didn't read their blogs.  If they used the same bot architecture that they used in their internal load testing (which I can almost guarantee they did) then they came from a completely different data center.  The engine was hosted in Microsofts cloud but the bots originate from AWS.
---
Company announces a test of new technology, saying they expect glitches and that the whole thing will crash and burn.
---
The thing crashes. 
---
Eve players reeeeee about it
---
Classic eve players 
---
I don't, who are they? 
---
ha ha 
---
Kite tristans could work. Punishers with inquisitors, though I doubt you'd get any fights. Rail &amp; plate incursus maybe?
---
Astero
---
Right but then builders wouldn't get paid
---
I cant be searched for anymore by name - I petitioned it ages ago, never even got a responce. 
---
That means, most of the people who play the game would revert back to alpha status unless they sub. This in turn would lead to chaos as the carrier alt that you used to rat for them dank ticks is no longer capable of ratting because you can't undock it again. 
---
I'd expect some sort of PLEX sale but I am unsure if the recent acquisition changed things in that department.
---
it was fun, just like a real EVE battle w/ 3600 people on grid
---
shit performance, laggy as hell , ships bugging out and teleporting , guns not working and it crashed all the time    
---
5/7 
---
I’ve never heard of a globby.
---
Hm. It's funny how years ago it was about getting people into space so there was somebody to catch.
---
Now that there is a big stationary target to hit, it's about preventing his friends from helping him, which, should such unwise ideas be adopted, would only result in less people being in space in expensive stuff again, leading us back to "how to get people into space and have them stay there".
---
There are ways to kill Rorquals already, keep pushing it and people will just go back to mining in barges and fucking off from belt the moment a neutral enters system like years ago. And then the posts here would probably change into "how we need to make barges unable to warp off before full strip miner cycle is finished", or some similar nonsense.
---
Sounds good to me... 😀
---
HG Omegas have always been a raw deal unless you're going full nopoors.
---
Honestly I didn’t read it too deeply as it was an interesting side thing but it didn’t pique my interest like it would others, I kind of tuned out on it to be fair. I like the idea but sadly it’s CCP, I’ve been on this ride for over a decade and have a level of distrust with their projects, it’s simply their track record that drags them down for me
---
“I wonder how good this apple tastes.”

“Eating it?”

Value: ~280mil
---
Nice, so if you lose 3, you can buy 1 back. =(
---
Shame you cant buy sense eh.
---
Well, that I understand, sure.  As far as I know this code wasn’t made by CCP though.  We can wait for the full failure spectacle when CCP attempt to migrate to it ;).  The only thing owned by CCP here were the art assets.
---
ya he got a couple

Another shit post from another rote kapelle member like that wally world guy. Just shut up already. 
---
Fun fact: I sometimes fail to realize how unreasonably pervasive Poe's law is.
---
And here we thought this wouldn't reflect the actual EVE playerbase.
---
It might be that potential buyer can wait for PLEX to get even more expensive. Why buy it now if anything points to it being higher in price tomorrow?
---
The networking demands would have indeed been somewhat close to actual people as their bots come from a completely different data center and use the network to operate.  Sure it wouldn't mimic a real person who in reality will hit the "fire missiles" button 10 times for each 1 time they wanted to actually fire but the network load wouldn't have been insignificant.  Of course there could be tons of false information or truth omissions in their blogs but they were an interesting read from the ones I scanned.
---
&gt;Still really impressive.
---
they got less than a third of what they wanted
---
wow, avoiding the game

big achievement

---
Wow, the man himself
---
That’s not the point at all. They still got almost 4K people and added in over 7K AI to demonstrate their capabilities. It was an impressive tech demo, regardless if 10K actual players joined or not. 
---
Is there a summary of how many of each ships are there still left alive?
---
Capital cyno: Able to support 10 titans worth of mass.
---
Capital cyno T2: Able to support 20 titans worth of mass.
---
Siege covert cyno: Can only be fitted on BLOPs. Provides tank bonus for 30 seconds, cool down of 300 seconds, able to support 25 BLOPs worth of mass.
---
Rapid Covert Cyno: Can only be fitted on Recon ships. 10s Duration, can support 100 bombers worth of mass.
---
Covert Cyno: Able to support 20 Bombers, 1 BLOPs, and 1 transport worth of mass.
---
Cyno: 3 jump freighters worth of mass.
---
Well since thread has gone fucking gross, I'll try to 'normalize' it by saying cheap coffee. When I started the game and was mining in high-sec, I'd make a cup.
---
I can no longer enjoy coffee nor mining (seriously, fuck mining).
---
Well I hope this works out and the intergration works when it's finally up, working and with as few bugs as possible as well as server stability is done for our big fights. No-one likes going to war and having the big battles won due to the server dieing and the side that thought they where loosing simply doesn't log in and looses the battle and possibly the war due to something out of their control. Also if we CAN get massive fights of 10k+ players ripping each other apart, imagine the PR and new players we get...IF it works relatively bug/glitch/dc free. I dearly want this, but the track record dampens my hopes, even if it's not CCPs tech, CCP still needs to integrate it to their systems and that's never a sur thing
---
Uhh, what happened to mission bots? Was there an update that changed the behaviour of the mission sites?
---
Tristans could probably work. might even be able to make the rifter work in an arty setup. punisher fleet would be tanky
---
mittens is that you?
---
wtf happened to that retard anyways? lost his super on the fake server?
---
:) How many kills do you have in an AT ship harly? 
---
I am ok with it as it also means the no life neckbeard that camps the gate and blows me up when I am just trying to chill is also gone 
---
No...there is not enough people to populate the systems we have currently...why add more?
---
This bug happened to me before, I warped away from a cit and was still tethered. Couldn't be locked either
---
i have no clue, with this amount of salt you could be right
---
yeah i mean your game has 300k players and they got 1% of that
---
for the amount of shilling they did it'd be embarassing if they got less than 3k
---
Actual worth was around 170b with the correct pricing on launchers and rolled mods :) 
---
Idk where you got your information but I got my information when the event will happen through the official channels (in my case Discord) and they told me on monday at 8pm ET that the event will be on wednesday. 
---
I kinda hope they put jump and bridge next to each other again. It was always a dumb placement but a hilarious amount of fights started from it. It was borderline an occupational hazard of owning a titan.
---

Excuse me I worked VERY hard for my super on the test server.
---
Someone needs to down the entire bottle of chill pills...
---
59/5
---
Fuck you’re dense. Did it get 10,000 people? No, but it still did manage to pull good numbers for a weekday test. At the end of the day, it was a tech demo to show off their server solutions, and they did just that. I’m impressed. 
---
you don't have to do what someone on the internet says, you know 
---
At 3 k they announced adding more ai, they sent another message about adding another 1k or so every 5-10 mins. 
---
Just don't buy the blueprints this time
---
suck eggs, idiot
---
I honestly haven't seen that much salt for awhile now on eve forum... It would be probably very common in games for kiddies but not eve 
---
Don't forget, that more and more characters are maxed out in terms of skillpoints. I have several of those (not with &gt;400m sp, but with all relevant skills at level 5 for what they are designed to do) and I know other have as well. And many of us feel entitled to no longer pay for their sub (or at least heavily subsidize the cost) by just doing a monthly skillgooing and investing it into plex.
---
BUT MITTENS
---
Nah, Abaddon is still way too thirsty, he'll have like two whole minutes to deal that extra damage before all the hamsters fall outta their wheels and he'll just be sitting there with deer in the headlamps look in its face.

I think he means lore wise. Like, who would insure evel knievel's stunt hike before he jumps a canyon with it. No one with any brains

40% real people is better than current eve tho.

Few people roll them. Obviously they struggle vs injector fit ships with the long cycle time but they're comedy gold against lots of stuff.
---
What were you grinding for?
---
\- watching our isk balance go up?
---
\- getting the next bigger badder mining thingies?
---
This game give all sorts of dopamine hits (i.e. "fun") I recently returned from years away and have been getting back into it 
---
I enjoy market trading and industry with one character and get a hit from having a good sales day, finding new profitable corners of the market, adding to my industrial capabilities (new things to make and profit from), and have turned 2B into 10B in the last few weeks. 
---
Another character is more PVP focused... so fire up that account to go pew some things when I have time to spend roaming lowsec... This is probably the biggest rush I get in game, but I'm enjoying researching fits and new ships/mods/tactics... a lot has changed since I last played. New ships to fly (or, prices came down a lot on some things that they seem reasonable to fly now)
---
The things that gave me reward earlier in my career like "skill training completed" don't happen as much anymore when I'm finishing out level 5 of things, also I'm solo more now... not playing in corps as I'm not as hardcore and not getting on voice to go roam
---
Yeah, and sadly there were quite a few of us that left because we didn’t want to go to the deep null life under a coalition’s protection. 
---
&gt;I haven't seen the data myself, so I'm assuming OP is stating that the faucet has been stable but prices are going up because of the increased demand
---
Also the post you mentioned on r/eve front page is "volume" not "sale volume". Volume being quantity available on market. Sale volume is different as it is a metric for market velocity (includes quantity and movement of orders). 
---
LMAO WOW PEOPLE DO THAT, WEIRD
---
Don't worry, you can still be blown with alpha ships.
---

What they should do instead is disable skill extract feature on plexed accounts

no, but we do have to abide by a bare minimum of community standards. and this?

Nope you do, its the law!
---
If i refer myself when making an alt account, does the 250,000 SP get applied to every character made on that account or just the first?
---
WITH THE WIZARD HAT
---
There are lost of people it's just that most are forced to join an existing entity and it's very hard for start ups to make a stake anywhere. There are alot of people they are just all in the same few systems. I think there is a large group of players in the game and even more that don't play for the simple fact that they can't do anything grass roots or small scale.
---
Ah the road to 9 million ISkies 
---
It is put in your redeemable items. You only get if for one character, but it can be applied to any character when you want instead of being automatically added to your character sheet.
---
This was without dev intervention, until this week. Katia visited every player-reachable system, and THEN they teleported her to Polaris, the Dev Only system. Even if someone repeats her task, she will still have one more system than they do
---
What drones hobgoblins were the good ones right?
---
I feel like it would offer an opportunity for more grass roots players and people who want to start corporations on small scale and develop infrastructure in a more sandbox environment.
---
This is a great comment. It takes into account both economic forces at work - namely a deflation of anything that can be farmed while a rapid inflationary price pressure on non-farmable assets. 
---
Too many faucets not enough sinks. 
---
That's completely wrong. You can rent systems from various entities, or do diplo work to work out something with the current owners, otherwise it will be difficult to just come in and evict someone, you need diplomacy. But if you look at the map there are a shit ton of ADM 0 Military/Industry systems, meaning not enough people to utilize the existing ones.
---
We noticed a few kills down chain between EvE Uni and NaturalPhenomenon, and decided to investigate.     
---
We formed up with Armour ships and went down chain to see if we could find them. After about 30 minutes we decided to head back after finding only small scouting ships.    
---
As we were jumping back into our home one of our scouts spotted a NAPHE fleet consisting of Bhaals, Brutix Navies and Guardians moving through the chain, so we set up and wait for them on the other side.  
---
Even though N0MEX had a couple less pilots than them, but the same amount of Logi (Two Guards and a Logi Loki on their side and Two Guards and a Zarmazd on ours) the fight was, we thought, pretty even.   
---
Initially we started the fight with a Geddon vs their Bhaal, but after realising our Geddon was about to go down, we switched for a Bhaal of our own and the Geddon pilot, once he died, switched for a Drekavac.  
---
Overall a fun fight was had.

Music: Two Steps From Hell - El Dorado
---
Sure for small things. Warriors are faster but do less damage. I think you can have a flight of mediums as well but I haven't looked at a stratios fit in awhile 
---
You shouldn't need a direct return on the value of your ship in order to incentivize conflict. Ideally the objectives you are fighting over should be valuable enough to be worth taking the risk of losing your ship.  In its present form insurance just makes losing things in EVE even more superficial. I believe the insurance nerfs are a step in the right direction.
---
That is sad but true 😭
---
T3 covops bowhead
---
People look for any reason to bitch. Eve players doubly so.
---
Lvl 4 and 5 missions are now gated behind omega. 
---
Some people literally cannot distinguish between reality and pixels. It's dangerous...
---
10 kestrels will volly you before you ever get a chance to rep. Or even be in range to fire.  Maybe I'm looking for something that can counter the kestrel doctrine 😆
---
We could have also gathered data about if players from different TZs tend to produce more lag.
---
Maybe the Tristan could work, I guess it depends on drone control range.
---
It's an honor to see you live up to your title Major. Jenkins is life.
---
Hopefully they got some useful data out of it. 
---
But since it also had a strong PR angle (e.g. articles in gaming press, hype-type presentation, countdowns, self-referencing texts on-screen such as "AMAZING! 10,000 PLAYERS!") it would have been far more impressive had we been able to see a genuine ceiling of what presently works and then they could go and break it for a big PR number. In the end we didn't see anything that we couldn't see in the present Eve online. The engine wasn't even set up to show the entire scene of battlefield from any single point.

&gt;The EVE: Aether Wars tech demo will be followed by a lightning talk from CCP Games’ CEO Hilmar V. Pétursson and hosted by Hadean. ‘Emergent Game Design: What has CCP learnt over the years?’ will take place at Stand S366 at 12:30 PST on Wednesday 20 March.
---
But call me first... I sell funerals.
---
Yes but renting blows and just bloats the owners of those systems. And the need to learn the intricacies of eve diplomacy is a huge hurdle for new players who might want to start from the ground up.
---
I wanted to put this in, but there wasn't enough room in the title
---
but its not a shipmerge
---
It was at GDC.
---
Rumour has it that they utterly chimp the fuck out if you just /move your super to another system so they can't "kill" it
---
got a screenshot somewhere of em being 180
---
With plex at this price there are no skill farms even if there was an unlimited supply of plex
---
Your blood must be of tiger origin 
---
Yeah,  eve is pretty forward with the whole "dont fly what you cant afford to loose." Motto. They have been that way sense day 1.
---
One of the things I love about Eve is you are a reflection of your character and your name follows you. Allowing someone to change their name would kill that 
---
tbf, I'm in corpse collectors on sisi. sure we mine a lot of salt, but it's the combat system, what do people expect?
---
If you don't want to get shot, go to delve or fountain or rifis or something. if you dont want your 30000 keepstars to get shot, dont put them up in M-O.
---
it's a pretty simple formula tbh
---
Got renamed as well.
---
would be a fun lore thing "black plex day" [the scope] "capsuleers panic and chaos in jita as the plex market has crashed, tradehubs around new eden have become scenes of mass riots, w/ over 1000 destroyed ships reported thus far, concord officers overwhelmed by the shear amount of capsuleers involved in the riots"
---
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked 
---
Pro'lly and edgy teen or something.
---
i mean if i wanna test a haw dread against kitey as fuck ishtars i dont want titans dropped on me, thats all im asking for
---
The funniest part about this video was the plex prices on your market bar 
---
Perfect, thank you
---
now now Malcanis, that's not an accurate assessment. I would rather people do that; go to wherever else and do what they want in peace. but I also think that by undocking in M-O you are consenting to having your ass handed to you.
---
it happens to me too, I've been losing a lot of fax :)
---
Or maybe add a limit to name changes with a “known aliases” button. Me personally I didn’t know I needed a family name at first and I’m using a randomly generated one and it bothers me seeing other people with the same name.
---
Why should everyone suffer because a certain group of people is against it? There is workarounds that could possibly keep everybody happy, it’s not that difficult. 
---
*Name* (Aka in small letters)
---
I think they should be allowed only of the character has been sold. But they get some kind of icon showing they are a purchased character who changed their name.
---
When it's been discussed in the past, it's always been talked about with searchable history.
---
Bye bye.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Do those have tacs?
---
Is it open to the public? 
---
I had a similar experience, a lot of people seem to be exaggerating the issues that were faced.
---
* 2 crashes on login, 3rd login was successful
---
*  Client worked out of the box
---
* FPS remained a near consistant 25-60 FPS except for occasional FPS drops to 5-10 FPS when large amounts of missiles were rendered at once
---
* 41 kills, 3 deaths
---
* No crashes, some occasional cases of missiles not being rendered immediately and suddenly thousands being rendered at once
---
* Very little rubberbanding, was certainly not robbed of any kills because of it 
---
* The very uprising lack of connection issues were in spite of the fact that I was playing through Australian internet while livestreaming in 720p
---
Considering this is the first tech demo and how truly massive the scale of this was, I say Aether Wars was a massive bloody success.
---
They couldnt find you to write you back vOv
---
Bingo (imo) 
---
In that case why do so many people look at it as a problem, it’s also an option that people could keep their “Names” but have a nickname as well?
---
As someone who is not really happy with the name of his main I'm kinda torn between both. I created her 9y ago on the free trial and just picked her  up 5y later. Now I've put to much time into  her to and can't justify the extractor cost to "reroll"
---
I for one like to rat an hour or 2 each day i am online, each to thier own. 
---
Idk why such a comment would actually get to you, it's not really worth spending two thoughts on
---
I love how there’s 0 salt in your post, respect Sir Jenkins, you’re playing this game the right way - having fun. 
---
all you gotta do is ask. we aren't complete asshats. mostly, but not completely...
---
so get some people you know in ishtars and have a test fight elsewhere
---
you don't have to go to m-o to have fights on sisi, only to fight strangers who can't say no
---
True, although it probably pales in comparison to plexing and extracting, both sinks.
---
They ran 7,000 clients remotely from a different data center? I assume they only simulated connections, if anything. From their documentation it says "We’ve already run tests with 10,000+ AI bots and Aether Engine and HadeanOS have taken it in their stride", which goes along with that suspicion. 
---
Say Yes to name changes.
---
Skill farms are what’s hurting plex .. the rest can self correct based on supply / demand ratios but this is where the true economic leak is occurring 
---
Last year was a huge sellout due to PA buying them, now the golden age of sales is over and income is being nerfed lol
---
In the past, I was torn between the 'accountability' aspect, and having a really badly named Main as Eve was my first real MMO. These days, with all the things that have changed Eve, proliferation of alts, injectors, soooo many out of game tools, the argument of 'name following you' is much less valid. As long as there is a tab or some such with previous names, it's fine, and should go ahead and become a thing.
---
Oh oh do rounding errors and diesel fuel next
---
They are testing server architecture, not client side optimizations. 
---
Your complaints are ultimately irrelevant.
---
Only if someone was retarded enough to implement namechange without a known aliases list.
---
if you don't get it, you might want to read the community rules. read about a guy named gigx and another one named mittani. there are rules of decorum in life, friend. you don't tread on superman's cape, you don't piss into the wind and you don't tell people to go kill them selves and how to do it on the game company's public forum, then expect to not be banned for life, called out as a dumbass and be reddit dumpstered.
---
That's just me, your mileage may vary.
---
According to their blogs they initiated bots from aws lambda calls.  What happens after that is up for the imagination as AWS isn’t going to keep a lambda spawned entity alive for very long.  The bots may not have persistent connections that have to be kept alive which would obviously then report false positives as they’d never see the desyncs.
---
I’m not full on drinking the kool aid but if they were willing to shell out some bucks then spawning 7000 remote clients is only a matter of how much money can be spent.  Finding the resources to run these clients is trivial in today’s computing world.
---
People can't see beyond "Name = reputation" and are unable to see the two dozen things that can be implemented to keep the reputation connected to the character.
---
They're now in 1DQ we're I'm going to FC them and  give them out free for my newbies and fellow goons.

For the last 6 months, if my memory serves me well, we haven't seen a real, big plex sale. Only the usual, half assed "10-15"% fake sales by CCP.
---
yeah, some words on a screen are not actual instructions in real life. not knowing the difference between something that matters and random text on the internet is dangerous, I agree! 
---
that may well be true, but if it was found players from X TZ produce more lag, but they would never hit the proposed 10,000 players, why hype it as being 10,000+ player stress test? The whole point, from my inexperienced eye, would be a stress test for the server would be bombarding it with inputs from all over the world and see how it manages to accept, process and spit out results back to them in a timely manner with minimal lag and rubber banding/crashes. Testing worst case is grand and all, but testing realistic demand would be better. 
---
For example if AU/NZ time zones have the worst lag due to geographical location, having it set for that TZ would be a bad call simply due to the amount of players that are there (yes we are a decent sized chunk of the community, but not so big to be able to pull 5-10k players in a single spot (also if the start time was 11:30 PST it would of been 5:30am in most of the east coast of Australia just as an example). 
---
I still stand by the fact they should of had multiple testing times to allow them to collect data on the server performance when it's getting hit from different locations at different 'concentrations' for those locations (US high demand, US low demand, Europe high and low etc) to be able to see if there are any bottlenecks (if that's possible, I have no idea honestly with server architecture and how it works) and how to fix them etc

so he's below it?

Nice try. They usually do real promotions during spring/summer, so price will drop.
---
You make a good point and I want to expand on it. 
---
Take the housing bubble. Houses have a function: you live in them. Everyone needs a house. Then, there weren’t enough houses to go around smoothly, so demand&gt;supply and prices went up accordingly. Then houses got a second function: they became a currency. People didn’t buy the function of a roof over their head, they bought like a hedge fund.
---
This depleted supply even more, and now prices were high _just because the prices were high_, and not because the function was sought after. Thus, the price was artificial. The bubble burst when the price outweighed demand so much that nobody bought houses anymore. Even a golden egg that you can’t sell is fiscally worthless.
---
Perhaps the same will happen to plex, although you don’t _need_ the function of plex. You can buy subs directly. Only people who use a lot of accounts (for whatever reason) will probably not buy subs for all their accounts. 
---
This means that rorqs and skillfarms will become rarer, so that minerals prices go up again, making pretty much everything else more expensive, and skill injecting will be less common (although I believe that damage has already been done, and even before injectors you had people training specific skills then selling on the bazaar).
---
Because a lot of stuff will become more expensive, plex will be relatively cheaper. So really this is going to turn into an inflation of isk.
---
 Here's him, wayyyy the fuck over it

 Here's the line \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

better?

I think Polaris is included in Jove space isnt it? [its right next to them](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/UUA-F4/Polaris#jumps24)
---
Yes and no.
---
Botting is in fact responsible of that for quite a simple reason. They farm uninterrupted, causing the ISK to inflate. The bigger picture is juncture between botters and people multiboxing, increasing the demande of a PLEX market that id way more volatile.
---
Would ending bots now solve the issue ? Probably not, but it's a step towards the solution. The only way to definitely end the issue tho is to bury Rorquals and Super farming into the ground, and deep. 
---
You can use hull value as a base for LP to eliminate the potential for abuse, or worst case implement some system based on ship class or insurance value of a ship. IE: a frigate is worth x, an assault frigate is worth 3x, a cruiser is worth 3x, a HAC is worth 9x. 
---
it doesn't need to be perfect. Just somewhat incentivizing hunting for kills.
---
Gottaget funds to develop it further
---
Basically a capital sized Oracle 
---
F2P is honestly not the issue for me, what CCP did bad in that is that they just left people with an open highway on easy botable mechanics such as VNIs or Distribution missions. 
---
What's next, we are going to take "get fucked" super serious? I do not wish my starfish to get penetrated by a big black cock! That is breaking my sovereignty over my own booty! There's children in this game won't anyone think of me and the kids!?
---
Sweet just gotta sell your character to yourself when your reputation gets bad enough, then repeat.
---
To be fair to them, 'Eve' vs 'EVE' could be seen as a style decision. It's like how you might want to talk about [INIT.] but instead say 'Init' or 'INIT' so that the surrounding words don't look weird.
---
As for the PC Gamer one, I just followed on from their previous articles to keep it consistent. :P
---
Heavy bombers. Cruiser sized bombers with multiple bomb launchers but no cloak. Like a B-52.
---
It is the dumbest tome to perform this test at, tbh. So e people are still commuting etc.
---
If you want to ensure 10000 nerds in one server, you do it on a Sunday, at 1900. Simple as that.
---
They did try something like this, it was very poorly implemented. They basically put amarr and minmatar ships that  instalocked and pointed frigates and blapped you off the field as soon as you decloaked. They had a YouTube vid and everything, but implementation was very poor, no explanation as to what it was for, and no loot drop, it was 100% risk and zero reward. 
---
You mean Sunday?
---
There's a pretty big difference between the sentiments behind telling someone to get fucked and telling them to literally kill themselves irl.
---
There's no defence for crossing the line on the internet anymore than if you said it to someone face to face.
---
The main issue is you can't bring any ship bigger than a cruiser without getting BLOPsed or dropped by a carrier. Just yesterday our atron and kikimora got dropped by a thanatos... 
---
The other issue is there is no reason to be in FW and shoot half the enemies, when you can go pirate and shoot both sides for double the content. The FW system is too grindy and finnicky to be worth investing time in - you can spend hours grinding plexes out for no real reward. 
---
Do they still have the comets in the belts?
---
Just be a hottie like this guy and make it rain.
---
I agree mission running generates large payouts and that's why you have farmers who literally don't dont interact with main element. 
---
But dead
---
Again, maybe you should read the terms of service. I'm not going to get into that. But you have to understand that this was CCP's public server and they have standards of behaviour that people have to adhere to. If you don't adhere to these standards, you are going to be banned.
---
Gilas still lose out in terms of raw DPS with only drones for ratting, they are only better for certain escalations
---
What the fuck is this?
---
But no tidi!
---
Took a picture at event planet too, dedication!
---
Dont worry, i tried killing an industrial on a station in lowsec today  in a stealth bomber. Similar results
---
Also you don't care about ventures... Because... You've never tried to offensively plex a constelation full of them. 
---
You sure you were really scammed? You may not be able to sell used blueprints on the market *directly*, but BPOs still retain their original value, which is increased if they're decently researched. They are sold on contracts.
---
I've never paid attention to trade hub local; what's this scam?
---
Visits every system in game, doesn’t lose a ship.
---
CCP invites to polaris and bosons her astero with a titan, last system, first shop loss! Would have been comical in a way and thankfully i don’t think it happened!
---
I pay for 12 month sub for my accounts and renew each January. Didn't get the free SP lol.
---
Ignoring the fact that this has always been discussed as with some sort of history function, this concept is dead anyway.  If you want to vanish, you just melt your brain and re-inject elsewhere.

hi killer

SLYCE level barge piloting

Lowsec. I hear that place is full of nothing with occasional jaguar gangs.
---
PLEASE disallow ventures from plex sites, and disallow ships with WCS fitted from capturing large plexes.
---
Free GIGX!
---
&gt;I’m impressed.
---
simply sad that people are impressed at poor performance and a fraction of anticipated players
---
The exception would be Mordu's BS, the Barghest, which as you can see here [https://eve-marketdata.com/price\_check.php?type\_name\_header=Barghest](https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_name_header=Barghest) is about as much as the mach used to be. These prices are the result of changes to farm ability of these hulls. 
---
My suggestion was for the attacker to target the cyno-inhib, and then trigger the cyno-silencer module, doing an AOE jam on anything active.  I feel like a straight-up targeted cyno-jam would be a little too powerful for most situations. 
---
that works in both ways if you want to be balanced and fair
---
being outraged at color changing pixels in front of your face, is one's own fault
---
same as being mad at those pixels for losing a ship
---
both scenarios is the pixel readers fault for giving color changing pixels power over oneself 
---
scared to laugh at this... 
---
Fair, but in 3-4 man engagements the breacher is really good.
---
Anything vs 10 others will get volleyed pretty quickly.
---
increased isk supply is represented as demand in the PLEX market, as it figures that the easier it is to make isk the more people will choose to use it pay for extra accounts (especially when major isk making methods scale well with extra accounts like rorqual mining).   I always figured the price would go up a lot these past few years, but I was responding to his post that supply hadn't really risen with it.  I don't expect supply to rise with demand as much because demand has spiked so incredibly these past few years, but I expected there to be a larger rise in supply than there has been.
---
send me your isk and i will double it
---
Words hurt and all but how about a forum related ban. This person doesn't need a game ban because you were offended on that level. It's just dumb shit he wrote on an internet forum, probably not the first or last dumb thing he'll write much like this thread won't be your last.
---
nope
---
since when is socially acceptable to call anyone a *retard* over the internet?
---
or is it only acceptable when that person has been dehumanized/blackened by their out of context salt
---
Because capital ratting. The BPCs come from 10/10 escalations which come from Haven and Sanctum ratting anomalies which are now completed at an incredible rate. 
---
Lol dreads be like frigates in eve now. No one cares
---
Definitely submit it, see what atrum says.
---
It's technically just an upgraded nemesis
---
Can you buy more than one Galaxy Pack for the same account if it's on a 3rd party site like Humble Bumble?
---
LoL
---
I don't know. You use to be able to, but you didn't get the 'bonus' items (which I think was the PLEX and extractors). Somebody said you cannot at all anymore though. 
---
I believe you are correct and I recently asked Falcon whether they pump that PLEX back in and he said no. 
---
I'm pretty sure banned PLEX functions as their foreign exchange reserve, so to speak.
---
this guy gets it lol
---
Eve has audio?
