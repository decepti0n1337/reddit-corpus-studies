I don't get it, I don't even have local open on my jita character. Why put in all the effort, even after blocking jita local can't be all that useful.

hello newbro. if you see any fits coming from soviet union, ignore them as they're probably shit

Not EVE, but in a similar ilk I only just realized that cosplay is short for costume play. I thought it was just a word....

Jita local was usable?

It sure is because I have a child and a wife, but fuck my playstyle , right?
---
&gt; They said it’s not against the rules to use GeForce Now or whatever
---

---
Thanks for finally admitting that it's not against the rules, in direct contrast to what you said earlier:
---
&gt; The EULA expressly doesn't allow using a streaming platform to play the game.
---
why is the ISK/PLEX/LP button so god damn big are eve players all partially blind playing at 720p on a 12inch tablet
---
Was just curious if I should get back into the grind of things. As with any game, time is always needed to invest.
---
there is no such thing a luck
---
This is the first time they’ve said they don’t intend to ban people using GeForce now. Until this point they’ve always just said “that’s why you were banned” and didn’t go more in-depth than that. So yes, it was why they were banned and the eula was cited as the reason, but now apparently their stance is that it’s ok.
---
Armour if you want safety and wanna live through a gank, shield and DPS for ratting with risk.
---
If you're asking this question, you're not ready for a nyx. If you're flying one without a super umbrella you need to know what to do with it, how to fit it and why. 
---
But to answer your question, a massive dps nyx doesn't mean shit if it's dead. Brick tank it. Full high grade amulet set + other armor implants.
---
Just Know that if you have a Few dreads hunting your rorqs, you will be baited into a trap and die to 10 of them. It doesn't take that many to kill a nyx. Suicide dreads have one million ehp minimum with an oh shit 30 second invulnerability button whole dealing 10-12k dps. If you have no backup to kill the dreads or to rep your nyx, you might as well just throw 20 billion to your closest jita scammer.

I completely agree. But this tumor is attached to the heart of the game. It needs to be cut out carefully otherwise it will kill it.

Im pretty new cameraman to VOLTA but you can also find on my channel a couple vids by recent fights.
---
Depends on what you're using it for. It sounds as though you're part of some small nullsec alliance, so here's the answers for that situation. 
---
1 - I'd probably just no-tank it. Tracking mids and DDA / hyperspatial lows for maximum krabbing efficiency. If you get caught it sounds as though you don't have the resources to fight back, so your defense is not getting caught in the first place.  Yes you'd last longer if you were brick tanked, but dying in 15 minutes is the same as dying in 5 minutes if help isn't coming
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
2 - If you're deliberately getting into a fight than full passive armor tank is the only sane option. Lots of EHP and not having to worry about being capped out is nice.
---
The blinking Market Orders thing is really irritating. I like the idea of the new wallet, but needs work.

Fell to one of these scams. PSA: if a 1.5bil blueprint is being listed at 16 nodes &lt;1m ISK per node, it's probably 1 run.
---
That's one of the fallacies that fuel gambling actually. You create arbitrary rules on how much gambling is acceptable and use them to vastly overestimate your chances of winning. Realistically your chance is always hard set there's no strategy to increase your chance other than spending more money per raffle. Your chance can also only be objectively evaluated within the same raffle. Playing 1000 raffles doesn't increase your chances to win each individual one hence the fallacy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
---
The 1 out of 40 part is especially misleading, in terms of evaluating your success rate, since if you're looking for low value tickets you'll likely be playing at 1/500 ticket odds, so in 5000 raffles you can have some statistical expectation to win around 10. But you may win 20 or all 5000 or zero.
---
Realistically because of how ticket values work as a proportion of the chance to win an item when you finally win one you'll likely have paid its value in tickets several times over.
---
A Venture with max skills with a Porpoise boosting mining C320 will make \~164Mn/hr. This comes with the risk of losing not just the ship (which is cheap) but all of the gas in the hold (which isn't) at any time.
---
A Rokh with basic skills in an Incursion fleet doing a TPPH wall (a worst-case scenario) can run 5 sites an hour minimum and make 200Mn/hr including LP. This comes with no risk of losing your ship unless you screw up or logi is unable to save you, and in the latter case your ship is covered by insurance in at least one fleet.
---
The sane option would be getting the same value in Thanatos carriers, fit one for crab, the rest for max brick tanked.
---
You can dock them without having a Keepstar, you can throw them around more easily and by the point you went through all the armor Thannys, you will (hopefully) have a better understanding on how to use carriers in PvP.
---
The question is not "why", the question is "where" :)
---
Did you read none of what I posted here? I've *encouraged* new players to consider nullblocs due to the risk-free introduction to a variety of activities. All I did in addition to that was suggest they consider striking out on their own once they've picked what they like because in my experience a large nullbloc cannot provide the same level of one-on-one support and camaraderie as a smaller entity.
---
Reading is hard.
---
PvP is not only shooting at someone with guns.
---
So 460.8Mn for a 201Mn hull.
---
Still mad respect.

I lost all of my isk and assets to hypernet yesterday. But thats fine since ive already quit the game and only came back to gamble away my shit and reduce the chance of getting sucked into eve again.
---
People love to hunt botters.    
---
Remember that it is not only VNI bots but also carriers , supers and rorquals.      
---
If you have 100 bots "in the air" you can tackle them pretty easily if you can get fast enough to them and observe them long enough.      
---
If they are warping to a specific structure - anchor few drag bubbles or logout sabre - they do specific anoms ... well do the same.      
---
People killed bots this way for quite a while.          
---
But there is additional benefit to people hunting bots.             
---
If they are sitting in a space that don't have any easy access there is low movement - so bots are running 95% of the time.        
---
But if there is a space with constant  movement this changes in a dramatic way.         
---
Bots warp off when neutral is near and stay "safe" for 5-15minutes.    
---
so if you have just 2 people moving in the constellation the effective time of a bot goes down from 95% to like 50%.   
---
The bigger movement the lower time bot is active.
---
So basically you want to say that you will react to income of their bots when it will be to late?           
---
Interesting, but quite ineffective approach.
---
I like it personally so at least one customer is happy!
---
I would prefer the market sell orders to be still in the wallet however I can live with that I suppose.
---
[This is pretty simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETxmCCsMoD0)
---
Month or two.
---
The full question would have been "where do you intend to fly that max turbo krab super, asking for a friend who is totally not going to drop on you".
---
But since you asked: Nyx has more lowslots, so you can fit more warp speed, making it a bit faster.
---
It's not that it's not completely risk free in nullblocs. It's just that we pay for the risk to be pain free, even if ganked. Take Karmafleet for example, we pay SRP if you lose your Myrmidon whilst out ratting to gankers. We offer free Myrm's to newbees too. With insurance, they'll have made their ship's value back and the insurance cost after 3 sites. Given new players have poor situational awareness, we take the pain out of pve for them. Same goes with SRP for pvp. Smaller groups rarely can compete with that. Everything comes out of your own pocket and there's little State Welfare in place.  
---
For all this talk of "Don't join Goons" by many others here, there's a very good reason people join us. Especially those graduating from highsec. Another problem is the initial inability for a new player to make isk. We throw them in free salvaging ships, or buy them noctis's and they can make as much as 120M isk/hour in one. I kid you not! We also do mentor programs, run a Gooniversity, run regularly classes on 101 subjects and a heap more. There's all the benefits and no down sides (except being hated by non-Goons). That's why people join Goons.
---
No i think he mean in game.

that would be as stupid as making suspicious contracts... AND it costs quite alot to "launder" it with hypernet.

well anyways, it's only worse to launder money than contracts

First 4 items on your list is called "creating a competent organization" which is the basis of any thriving economy.   Be it a pack of animals, or a logistics company.

the 5th item is politics, everyone says their side is better than the other side, that's natural.

I hope with your time in CSM and interacting with players on a wider scale, you'll elevate your world view beyond of a grad student in Grievance studies, that thinks all white men are inherently evil because of their privileges.

You can really get away with everything if you say "hey this is a game of blowing spaceships, what's the problem?"

but once you virtue signal like this, i feel like puking in your mouth would be the best way to end this discussion.

OH BOY CANT WAIT FOR EVE’S VERSION OF TOWN SCROLLS FROM BLACK DESERT ONLINE!

I’m skeptical.

Does this mean I can use this in my JF or BR to instant teleport to my staging?  If it’s my JF all I need to be is within jump range of my home region and my need for a cyno chain gets cut in half (assuming I need it to get back).
---
If it’s random... I dunno I guess it’s interesting...?  But what about choke points to Null like Keberz -&gt; HED-GP?  Or Obe -&gt; whatever system it is.  Are those now irrelevant entirely?

Why would they?

They get legit 5% cut for every transaction.

So you rolled a 512 and got extremely lucky and this is somehow their loss even though you paid for that insignificant chance? Lol I bet you play the lotto irl.

The Print Screen button is a nice place to start.
---
I thought CCP had some sort of issue with using VPNs
---
He need irl help
---
Yeah, but there's sweet sweet victimhood points to be had.
---
There is one thing i forgot. The chat window got a tiny + in the tab area. You can add channels and I would recommend to choose "help". Reading the questions of other pilots will help you a great deal to learn the EVE ligo.
---
So basically you say this is a system to scam on the sale but as the scam is portioned in tickets it doesn't matter?
---
O no, it's the *internet police*.
---
He had help getting out if it. This just made it come back. 
---
He will be seeking his help again after this, just to counter it and be prepared.

&gt; "In short, this addition to the EVE Online EULA means that as of the launch of Ascension, players will be prohibited from using in game assets and currency, as well as the EVE IP, to take part in or promote gambling services or other games of chance that are operated by third parties." continues the post. 
---
You're welcome again.
---
You can scam if you buy &gt;half your own tickets. But then there's still a chance to lose the item, in which case you'll get much less than you would have for selling on the market. 
---
I'm saying it's a system where many people will pay to have a chance to get something for much less than market value, allowing you to sell most items for slightly more than market value.
---
Then go fly with other people if it really bothers you. Nobody's putting a gun to your head and forcing you to fly with the people you're flying with. And I very much doubt it's all as bad as you claim it is, you're quite obviously taking jokes and banter and treating them more seriously than a pesticide shower.

---
Basically I had this issue a few weeks back. Turned out the issue came from my asshat ISP redirecting data through a data center that was derping. The VPN enabled me to reroute past that data center and all was fixed.
---
I asked support about using a VPN, the GM told me it was perfectly fine.

I'd email you 3 days later when your raffle expires with no takers.

This is hilarious! The have send a GM (Hi GM Gueedov!) into the help channel who is nuking HyperShit spammers. I can't see it but I expect Rookie Help to be much worse. In the main hubs local chat is unusable. Well played CCP, well played indeed!

---
What do you mean ?
---
Main point is, they make money off of it and it's not like they have to fear financial punishments. At least similar cases, apps like "coin masters" for example, didn't have to. And at least in Germany only schools and certain other social institutions can escalate a case to get something rated if they don't do it by themselves so EVE is probably going to remain under the radar for quite a bit if not forever.

I'm not minimizing the cases of true harassment that occur. But if someone tells a dick joke in your presence, that's not harassment. It's either a lame attempt at humor (if it's a bad joke) or hilarious (if it's a good joke).

You need to understand that there's a difference between shit talking and hate speech. You also need to understand that if it's not said *to* you, it's not *for* you. What may seem like a "sexist" comment to you, an outsider, might be an inside joke between friends. You don't get to be offended on my behalf when one of my friends tells me to get back in the kitchen. You don't get to tell said friend to fuck off on my behalf. Only I get to do that.

Did you factor in the cost of setting up the order?

Its currently at about 6-8% of the items worth when you translate the hypercores to plex and then to isk
---
I have how we
---
Not exactly. You're playing with some more risk when listing on hypernet as well. Only 3 days for all tickets to sell or you lose an extra 5% if you need to relist. So when I list my State Raven and somebody else does one cheaper right after, im pretty much fucked because I cant adjust and nobody will by my tickets. So 5% right out the window there. Need to be able to cover the 10% you're gonna eat no matter what, and then some.
---
A lot of methods for getting direct isk now give you less isk than they did a year ago. Super ratting, titan ratting, VNI ratting etc. These methods of producing raw isk are less efficient. Meanwhile ore production is as efficient as always. 
---
-When isk generation is lower, isk becomes more precious, people want to lose less, there is less fighting, and less stuff is blown up.
---
-If less stuff is blown up, and ore production stays the same, the value of ore goes down. 
---
-I dont know why PLEX is stable at 1.7ish bil for 500. My current theory is that CCP is doing that on purpose in order to remove bot created isk out of the game (they probably concluded that there is too much of it). The current PLEX price vs direct isk generation efficiency is out of balance, and PLEX should cost a lot less, so i think that CCP is purposely not intervening (like they would otherwise) in order to maintain it that high.
---
You people have no sense of hyperhumor lol....
---
Certainly but things also need to be used and blown up, otherwise the economy becomes that of the test server as well. If you make getting things too hard, nobody will want to risk losing them. And then everyone stays docked up and we get 0 content and a stale economy.
---
This is a bait post right?

Make an alliance nessessary to pilot a super. Intro a new high SP skill for alliance management that changes the amount of supers able to be piloted at one time in alliance. Or amount of omega members in alliance effects how many can be piloted 1-500 = 1 super.

I spent 45 minutes this morning scrolling through the 'good deals.' I was immediately reminded of the idiom, "suckers and their money are often parted;" and I had mixed feelings about the hypernet addition from CCP, because back in the day I blew billions of isk on the old lotto... but I really did not think CCP should be in the business of encouraging online gambling. 
---
In any event, despite my misgivings, I was kind of looking forward to throwing some money away... until I saw the kind of shit that was being thrown up. Like 200m isk for a 1 in 250 chance of winning a Dagon, or 70m for a 1 in 16 chance of winning a skill injector. None of it is even remotely worth it and I am relatively well off EVE wise. 
---
In fact, I think my first comment about this on comms this morning was, "anyone who buys into any of the hypernet raffles is stupid af."

Used to keep it that way for a loooong time, although we live quite nomadic for a decade now.

Your chance of having won something after 16 tries with a probability of 1/16 is [only 64%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-%281-%281%2F16%29%29%5E16)
---
Hey that's me, a real man playing EVE
---
So what would a "good coloration" be ?
---
Well, 
---
 - Either the item does not have an estimated price. BPC, mutated. AND its price is below the median effective value of this item on the hypernet. Which actually makes no sense for most of them. So I would just skip it
---
 - Or the item has market value. So the mult value of the offer is, the ratio effective_price / estimated_price. Then you compare this ratio with other ratios on the market, eg to the 25 centile of the ratios . It's green when it's lower than this 25th centile.

---
The people gambling don't win anything of actual direct value, just in game assets, that CCP will explicitly ban you over if you ever do get caught for selling them for RL cash.
---
This. The resolution is okay at best, but it really needs to be an a lot higher.
---
You're not raffling off prizes of any value, so it does not break that law also CCP will explicitly ban you over if you ever do get caught for selling them in game items RL cash.
---
No no, the UK law is against raffles offering *PRIZES* over a particular value, not what the take to the raffle holder is. Given that the raffles in game do not have any RL value, and that CCP will explicitly ban you over if you ever do get caught for selling them for RL cash, they should be in the clear there.
---
I don't like tethering. Make all citadels like stations. No free safety in space. But you can dock if you don't have a combat timer.
---
Its not how it works because the understanding of the UK law is flawed.

But it is against terms of service to cash out. RMT is illegal, so this is just another minigame. No cash value.
---
 I'm Vjm me d we dhhu be bb bb. N.  . BB
---
Isn't this the entire premise behind the service and wasn't it the case for SOMER Blink as well?  Hell, this is the entire point of real life raffles as well.  A charity doesn't raffle off items hoping to break even on the tickets.  They try to sell as many tickets as possible to get above and beyond the item value.  
---
The value for the buyer is exactly as you describe.  They're playing for the chance that they get something very expensive for very cheap.  All games of chance are 100% not a good investment but you're not doing it in order to get a good deal on an item.  You're doing it precisely for the chance you win big.

13 days of EVE
---
The popular 13 Days of EVE event returns for the holiday season, with free daily login rewards between 12 December 2019 and 7 January 2020. All pilots, regardless of their license status, get rewards but upgrading to Omega gets you better gifts plus all the Alpha rewards too! The improved rewards include an unreleased Permaband SKIN, exclusive Facial Augmentations, more snowballs, more Skill Points, more Boosters, more Abyssal Deadspace Filaments, and...you guessed it...even more surpises!
---
ChillingSpree
---
Chilling Spree
---
Back by popular demand but with a slight…holiday twist - you will once again be able to receive a great number of Skill Points (and mysterious travel rewards) for completing daily NPC and Capsuleer-hunting challenges in the festively-named Chilling Spree event. Be aware though, you're going to need those snowballs from the 13 Days of EVE to complete the missions in Chilling Spree, so make sure you log in daily and stock up.
---
Melted snowballs
---
Do you have melted snowballs from past events? You’re in luck! Head over to the Yoiul Festival Snowball Exchange located in numerous places in Hi-Sec and use the Meltwater-Snowball Exchanger to trade in those melted snowballs in exchange for brand new ones to use in Chilling Spree!
---
A Mysterious Travel Filament
---
Surprise gifts and visits are synonymous with this time of year, so keep an eye on your daily login gifts during the 13 Days of EVE, as you never know what you might get and where it might take you and your fellow pilots in Null-Sec! The RDLF-09 Filament is……especially exciting. These filaments are available exclusively during the holiday event, so make sure you don’t miss out on the opportunity to surprise your fellow capsuleers.
---
Happy holidays!
---
Cool
---
it was for today

You can totally cash in, but all you'll have to show for it is..... well, nothing.

Ah fine. but that's just the UK. we already know some countries have problems with lootboxes, the contents of which do also not have rl value (and in most cases can't even be sold for rl value, which you can do with isk, even if CCP doesnt like it) so I'm not so sure they are 100% in the clear.
---
&gt; Raffles are classed as gambling in the U.K. (over a certain amount made in a year) ccp does not have a licence in the U.K.
---
ofc there are multiple layers of indirection; including that CCP are only providing the tools and taking an up front fee. They get paid even if the raffle itself doesn't complete. 
---
The raffle is being put on by, the player, who bears all the risk if the tickets don't sell. The only thing he can win is isk, unless he also buys his own tickets. 
---
Is it actually any different from carnival games in a place that gives out tickets? Some are games of skill, some are games of chance (the pile of quarters and pusher game). 
---
Each game is, at its core, a bet against the house that you can make them pay you as many tickets as possible. Its pay to play; then you even get to RMT your tickets back out for physical items at the counter. Kids are even allowed to play.
---
And they don't even employ this extra indirection where players run the games and set the expected roi.
---
Doesn't matter, Hypernet is already dead. It will hardly be used within a week.
---
Items of value are only items that can be traded back to real money, which isn't the case for EVE Online. Otherwise it'd be the same in Germany.
---
where is that image coming from?  
---
in-game or one of the CCP Statistics?
---
Wrong. Loot boxes that gave any method of transferring rewards in-game were deemed illegal (as that inherently assigned a real world value to the items), and you can most certainly transfer items in eve online.

Oh okay I didn't know you knew better than the lawmakers. 😁
---
From a logical point of view you should never be able to earn ISK in the long run by gambling with raffles. The host needs to pay the tax + the hypercores to start a sale, so the price is always going to be above the actual item value. Add in some small percentage on top of it (because nobody would use this system if they didn't stood to gain anything) and your ticket prices will always be well above the sum of all tickets, meaning your expected outcome is always worse than actually buying the item outright.
---
There's a reason people do raffles for fundraising and stuff. You're giving away an item while recieving much more than it is worth.
---
Thrashers, hundreds and hundreds of Thrashers.
---
Thats it, totally unplayable.  I'm unsubing my 70 Rorq alts in delve and deleting all my bots in DeadCo.  Fuck you CCP.

That's stupidity.

Don't even ask, you'd be better off injecting.

&gt; Some 1337 PvPers hate "risk-averse" players, like miners and highsec mission-runners
---
Is that actually true? I've talked to or flown with a number of people who might be considered "1337 PvPers" (and might even be considered one myself depending on your definition) and I don't think I've ever seen people hate miners or highsec mission-runners. Some PvPers have a negative view of Rorquals, but not the people using them as far as I can tell.
---
I'm not saying there's no hypocrisy amongst the people I fly with, but the animosity that exists is mainly directed at people who bring things that basically end a fight, be it Jaguars/Dramiels or supers/titans depending on what you're flying.
---
&gt;after daily downtime
---
More proof CCP don't even play their own game.
---
It shows wrong values with the hypernet. Which is stupid.  So yes, the game is stupid.
---
Also the hauling contracts to a citadel, before delivery. This was stupid too.  A lot of other things are stupid in the game, yes. A lot of thins REQUIRE the players to have knowledge about stupid mechanisms - that's why you are playing against the game.
---
Example, people using a scanner and not being suspect in HS is stupid.
---
Example, being able to infinitely bump a freighter before, was stupid.
---
Example, requesting to dock at station but actually landing 2km out of docking range and being blown by a nade. That is stupid.
---
Example, not being able to distinguish between BPO and BPC in some cases is(was) stupid . Any stack of two BPO were shown as BPc before last week (that's the bug fix). 
---
Example, making storyline mission for eg gallente and then getting &lt;-5 with caldari and amarr because nowhere does the game tells you that you lose faction standing in storylines.
---
And the list goes on. The game is full of design choices that may have made a sense at a moment but don't make one now. But here I'm not even talking bout technical debt. I'm talking about a feature they added, which is stupid.
---
Jesus, talk about a blast from the past!
---
what you statistically expect. 
---
If I have a coin and I flip, I will have half tails. So with 10 flips you statistically expect 5 tails. Even though you have (1/2)\^10 = 1/2\^10 = 1/1024 chance to not have a tail at all.

Yes, because rmt is non existent in eve. Nobody sold their ingame isk and items for real life cash. And while rmt is against the eula i'm pretty sure it isn;t against the law in many places
---
Your problem, game stable
---
Go right ahead. I'm going to be using similar min/maxing spreadsheet skills to instead leverage an advantage over others in fights and actually have fun while winning.
---
Yeah. I was thinking that the Orca should be pretty safe if I never leave it uncloaked for long, and change up my safe spot from time to time, but yeah, If I fuck up the consequences will suck. And yeah, maybe I should just start out with a POS. Since they have not yet set a date, as far as I know, for when they will remove them, there should at least be a grace period between announcement and removal, so I probably have time to enjoy it for a while.
---
I did mean actually joining a corp though. Was just wondering if there generally are wh corps that live long term in holes where I could anchor a structure for my self and be a bit self reliant, while of course commiting fully to defense of corp assets and other corp ops. But yeah, I assume there are. Ideally I should find a small corp like that once I'm plugged into the game again.
---
I don't think so. While we were on mumble we had several guys who all had disconnects at random times.
---
Good evening Sir,
---
there is a post of ccp about this topic.
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/201827699-Network-communication-between-your-computer-and-the-EVE-Online-server-has-been-interrupted-
---
Eve is very sensitive if it comes to package loss, if you are connected via a wifi stick I recommend to switch to an ordinary ethernet cable as they tend to provide a more stable connection. Also avoid any further switches between your router and computer. 
---
I did have this issue with eve before when I used my cell phone for the internet connection. All games work fine on it, but eve does not. I switched to the ordinary ethernet connection and it works just fine. It really seems to be an issue on your end and not ccp's. There is also not a 'quick' fix they could do to change that.
---
&gt; This is a stretch goal and would require a lot more coding, but it’s a  compensation buff I’ve been thinking about for a while: let  supercarriers actually “carry”. Give them a module that allows them to  turn into a mobile astrahus. A finite number of subcapitals of any type  could dock in them (let’s say 50 for the sake of discussion) as long as  this module was active. The module would lock the super in place for \~10  minutes. Pilots who docked in the supercarrier can undock as a capsule  at anytime but they can only undock in their ship if the module is  active. This would allow you to use a small number of supers to move a  sub-capital strike force at higher speeds and deposit them behind enemy  lines. There’s a lot of interesting plays you could use this for, like  for instance the enemy fleet has blocked an in-gate. You could jump 5  supers behind them and undock your fleet of 250 guys there. It’s a  gameplay method that has a lot of interesting options. Also even if it’s  not always utilized it is very “cool” in concept so it increases the  aspirational utility of supers. 
---
This would be so awesome. The ability to dock, move online players, mobile station, etc. It's indeed just 'cool', but it really opens up so many gameplay scenarios. Not just for large alliances or long campaigns, but for nearly any group of players.
---
It's also been talked about and requested for as long as I remember. Apparently it's just not feasible with the current code base or something.
---
That super cap idea for tacticle logistics is awesome. It puts them back in the "Mothership" role. I think the reducing them too 100km removes their intended use, long range capital support. 
---
 I dont like the idea of a 20 billion isk heavy tackle. You already get that with dreads. 5 dreads with heavy scams has the same dps and a large amount of tank when fit for pure tank. It would take 9 heavy scrams to hold a titan in place. 9 dreads works, but I dont think anyone is going to commit 200 billion isk in supers to kill a single 70 billion isk titan.  200 billion in dreads is 50 dreads.
---
Thanks for the fresh ideas. I dont love them all and I dont hate them all, but thanks for trying.
---
~~C H A O S E R A~~
---
Has anyone else noticed that your average StainGuy post sounds suspiciously like Bee propaganda?
---
Does this kind of opt out work for other features like the new wallet or is it a nypernet relay thing only?
---
&gt; because nobody would sell with this system if they didn't stood to gain anything
---
Some items may be hard to sell otherwise, and if the seller needs isk he might be willing to sell it for less than he would using contracts, as the odds of actually selling the item (and getting the liquid isk he needs) could be much higher
---
I was listening to the &lt;10 podcast with rise and he mentioned this rock paper scissors idea with subcaps vs caps, vs supers/Titans. It got me thinking that one way to change mechanics would be to go Hollywood style and make it so that to destroy the big things is to destroy smaller things on them. So what if Supers and Titans had targetable functions that only subcaps could destroy and when destroyed would take a chunk of the EHP of the ship. But then buff the HP so that things that do big damage capitals/other supers/Titans have to do a massive fuck ton of damage where sub caps only need a smaller portion on the targetable functions to destroy them. 
---
This is only have the equation because you need to make it so supers have a really hard time applying damage to subcaps.
---
Yeah bro you're really sticking it to them good job.
---
Asher - the FC we don’t deserve and probably don’t need either.
---
&gt; Add the ability for titan doomsdays to target citadels and for them to ignore the damage cap. This gives titans a new role as bunker busters. But because of the way doomsdays now work you have to sit them on grid with the structures for at least ten minutes, and you would need to bring A LOT to one cycle a big structure, 3 different times. This would, hopefully, put more titans in space and vulnerable but it also gives them another role to help add to their inspirational status.
---
I feel like you've been holding onto this post until you had the ability to field enough Titans to volley keepstars.

---
Great ideas mostly, don’t know if the 10 min spool up is the right way to go on titan dd’s, would make the module useless outside of massive tidi fleet fights, but the rest of the ideas are great, esp forcing supercarriers into becoming brawling ships, their extreme range is a huge part of what makes them oppressive in the current meta.
---
I think he means give DDs mining laser mechanics except where if interrupted theres no damage. All the "payload" is at the end of a 10 minute cycle.
---
Yeah, that's why Horde is better.

No, because these concerns are stupid and wrong.

Because that's where they'd be if CCP didn't hate money
---
&gt; So the expected profit from the buyer's perspective will always be  negative **(assuming that the seller isn't underpricing the item and the  markup is positive)**. 
---
Emphasis mine. *This also applies to buying items from the market.* You've discovered a fact about the transfer of goods, nothing specific to Hypernet, gambling, or whatever. In fact, what you've shown is that, from the buyer's perspective, as long as one is not risk-averse, it doesn't matter whether you buy from Hypernet or from the "normal" market. The considerations are identical.
---
When it’s fired you can immediately begin the cycle on a new target if I interpret it correctly.
---
Glad to see insight from someone with actual supercap experience
---
They don’t really lose their stuff. I’d agree with you if their stuff dropped too. But losing the citadel and fitting and having your stuff asset safety’d nearby isn’t too harsh.
---
Yeah this is very true. a 100% markup is essentially a 50% RTP (which is unheard of in the gaming industry, where the player is the collective players). This might go great for the first couple days because of hype, but it will naturally die out.
---
Ur mates in NPC corp are not ur friends. Basically they are neutral/hostiles in space. So is good to be diferenciated from ur Capsuleer corp mates so u can see the difference fast in the overview.
---
thats op, why hasnt it been nerfed ;3;
---
I find your take interesting. And I appreciate as one of the leaders of the grandest cap force you can still point at the problems surrounding caps. Although it took quite a few years to get Goonswarm intellectuals to criticize cap dominance.
---
Here is the issue with your take. Capital FCs and empire builders tend to focus on capital vs capital warfare to pinpoint the problems with capitals. It's just where their interest in Eve and expertise lies at. In my opinion, the capital problem doesn't begin at the level where caps are on grid killing stuff. The root problem is how they are obtained and how they gather in blobs. The proliferation.
---
The #1 advantage of having a large cap blob is not being able to win wars, evict regions, or kill Keepstars. It's the umbrella mechanics. I have argued for years now about how the larger your umbrella gets, the safer your capital farming activity becomes, thus you can recruit even more people, get your people into even more capitals, and eventually get an even larger umbrella. Goons caught this spiral right on time, but most other alliances are using the same model now. The reason why we don't see an equal growth in other alliances is that the game has a limited amount of people willing to go into this capital farming route and most of these people are already settled in their alliances.
---
The umbrella model forces organizations to recruit whoever they can and cram them into a single region. There is virtually no upper limit on how many people can do this. And thus we get massive groups of people with unfightable amount of capitals. And these people need to depend on one another to get the capitals. So they rely on the same intel, the same FCs, the same infrastructure, and eventually become a cohesive group. So it's not like they are easy to split either. Which in turn yields stagnation, in which the only content accessible to the largest cap group in Eve is regional glassing. Everyone will forever run away.
---
In the pre-Rorqual meta, we had similarly large blocs, but they were split between different neighboring regions, umbrellas, infrastructures, alliances, FCs, etc. They were less cohesive, didn't always act together, and thus content was more available.
---
I was just rolling wormholes with V0lta today. V0lta is the most active whaling group on zkill. It's full with super and Rorqual kills. Whenever v0lta rolls under the Goon, TEST or Horde umbrella, they don't even attempt to hunt. They go back, try a less strong region. They know by experience they'll get blobbed to hell if they try. If there is one metric about the game's ecosystem being balanced; it is when the most target-rich environments become the most lucrative targets again for the most active groups. Right now, it's the opposite. Hence the reason why everyone chooses the umbrella model and a blue life with so many other people.
---
I've had it argued to me many times how CCP can't break social groups and can't design a game favoring middle-sized groups over large groups. This is just an answer talking past to everything I argued above. I don't think a Goonswarm member's social gaming experience would change incredibly if they had to split into 4 regions and 4 umbrellas. Even if living across regions, people can remain under the same identities if they wanted to. Or, perhaps it will turn out that a lot of people are in these massive blocs because of the safe farm, and they will choose to leave if the relative safety isn't that huge anymore. 
---
So, what should CCP do concretely?
---
1) Rebalance (or rework even) anomalies so people can't cram more than 1/20 of nullsec's population in a single umbrella range and address their farming needs.
---
2) With the cyno changes, cyno mechanics is only 1 tweak away to give people a real chance hunting under umbrellas; which is increasing the range of mobile cyno inhibs to 500 km.
---
3) Once the above two tasks are completed, they can look things like at cap vs subcap balance and the effectivity of FAX etc. to balance large empire vs empire fights.
---
Asher already preparing his next AUTZ war campaign
---
No idea, this is the issue i get into with 'resource depletion' what happens once everything is gone?  The only way it would work in eve is you either have to constantly have new space to get resources form, or you have to have really long re-spawn times.  Even the deep space roid fields would not be enough over time.
---
I figured this could be a way to have things take a while. like you would maybe have a day or two down time on mining while the cannon recharged,m but youd have lots of things you could mine if you manage it correctly
---
I'd like to 'hear' why you say no
---
Eve has entities and players who teach how to play the game, opposed to if I started a steam and went to play csgo today I'd be shit on in the match, over comms, and in DMs because I can't pull my weight. (And justifiably so.)
---
...I hope that you are aware that an Astrahaus has 1.8mil hp in shield, armor and hull, a Fort 5.4mil and a keepstar 27mil
---
you wouldnt need many Titans to volley them (maybe a keepstar)
---
I like your changes to the carriers. Supercarriers beeing the only ones to field heavy fighters is a good idea. but keep their range up so that they fight from far away, since that is the job of a carrier -&gt; field a small ship that fight up close, but stay the fuck away. Give the scrambler bonus to normal Carriers, that way they could be used with the sub-cap fleet
---
the idea of an active module that enable a super to be a temporary station is super cool...... or have carriers while still enable them to field heavy fighters and have supers be able to field a small number of player ships without any module (keep it limited then)
---
well that's quite unhandy for HS space at least, anyway what the issue to reconfigure colors/tags for corpmembers if anyone in NPC corp feels like they are not really corp eg. enemies?
---
I have always followed a 'be careful what you wish for, you might get it' when it comes to eve.
---
So i'm seeing if there is an idea that could make the 'resource depletion' request actually work in way that's not going to be garbage after a few months.
---
Is this the one with dave
---
I expect things to never go my way. Are you saying I'll be pleasantly surprised? :D
---
&gt; My theory is that the moment you put in cumulative delayed site respawn  in active null sec. Players options will be to fight for control over  smaller pockets, and the break up of major coalitions 
---
*My* theory is that the largest entity would simply seize all null-sec territories, kill off all competition, and spread their members out to maximize income.
---
There's no reason to think they'd break apart to spread out. It wouldn't benefit people in any way to do that. Quite the opposite, in fact.
---
They did actually get nerfed a bit this spring buuuuut yeah. On paper, they're supposed to be battleship-sized guns mounted to capitals, allowing the capitals to hit battleships (but not a lot smaller than that; akin to how actual battleship guns aren't good at shooting cruisers or frigates). Unfortunately because of how the weapon tracking formula works, they're... quite a bit more accurate than battleship guns are. And about 10x harder-hitting.
---
every genre of game starts out horribly unbalanced, but over the course of decades all the cheese and rock-paper-scissor stuff is discovered and you end up with pretty balanced games. as an example, if you put a completely average 2019 DOTA2 player inside a 2009 dota1 game, they'd destroy all of the old professionals simply because they know all of the stuff that had to get balanced in the last decade due to the literally *billions* of human hours devoted to constant competition and combat inside the game. it's like an organism that has evolved for a billion generations. all the kinks get fixed.
---
but if you have a freshly made genre with the same issue of horrible starting balance and then make it so people have to grind thousands of hours to play *one* fight, then it will take forever to balance the game. there is no iteration, no billions of man hours of combat, nothing. it's just the devs picking a few random numbers and then players eating shit
---
EVE should have a battleground where you can have teams fight with set budgets against another team in order for the game to get somewhere in balancing. you'd very quickly find out what's broken and what's not.
---
If only you had two years of notification for this tragic incident
---
Thanks m8 but legit not trying to set anyone straight. OP might have not known Kicking Over Castles was a component of Free Market. Just filling in gaps for him and whoever might come along to this thread afterwards.
---
So, don't reply if it's not worth your time. Others will that see it as worth their time to be helpful or friendly. Pretty straight forward without you needing to expend energy and hate telling some random guy on the internet that you, another random guy on the internet, is angry or dislikes him or whatever. It's not like your opinion is worth anything to him.
---

Found the architect
---
&gt;2) With the cyno changes, cyno mechanics is only 1 tweak away to give people a real chance hunting under umbrellas; which is increasing the range of mobile cyno inhibs to 500 km.
---
As someone who fights under an umbrella even I think 500km is way too fucking oppressive. (100 currently) 150 is more than enough to prevent reinforcement cynos from easily bringing in the umbrella. At the end of the day the prey should have the final opportunity to win, without that, there would be no prey.
---
Look Asher I like you, but I haven't flown a titan on my main yet, so this needs to wait like 3 months tia.
---
Secondly as well as getting ride of super caps and titans we should remove jump fatigue. I can hear hear thencries, and see the down doots incoming, but without supers, titans, or jump fatigue pilots could be apart battles that are within minutes by cynos. There is a lot more to it, but I do like seeing a member of House Goondor who wants to play spaceships online, and not just farmville in space with a monkey on the back in the form of super caps. Cheers mate!

Festival Launcher &gt; Snowballs : Lock anyone and shoot them with it. No damage or aggression
---
So... too complicated.  
---
Just keep the anoms the way they are but inverse the spawning.  Basically the more you mine the less quality anoms spawn.  Force more mining to the moons as there’s currently half (or more??) moons going unused.  Spread the goo out and region lock the 32s/64s.  Force the mining into low sec.  
---
Right now minerals are an infinite resource because anoms spawn infinitely and the mechanics don’t force rorqual fleets out of the umbrellas.  
---
This would address both of that.
---
It’s annoying seeing it in my feed all the time.  I choose to call it out.  My prerogative.  I got a notification that he posted a nasty insult at me that he either took down on his own accord or mods did.
---
I’ll let it be known that I PM’d him telling him I’d point him in the right direction if he’s willing to put in effort to learn the game (helpful links, newbro corps, etc).  Also told him he can pick a system if he wants to shoot it out instead.
---
Those micro communities will come to agreements on how to share resources, thus forming larger groups. They will then force maller groups to adhere to those agreements or else remove them.
---
Yes there were lmao.
---
10 minutes in crippling tidi is 1 hour. You expect your 10 titans to be connection stable for that entire hour?
---
First off a disclosure. I am not a capital pilot. Closest I have gotten is flying orcas. 
---
Comment on point 4. I don’t know if fighters and bombers have ammo capacity but would it be an idea if they had to periodically return too rearm and repair? You can compensate this nerf by increasing their alpha damage. 
---
Adding a heavy stealth bomber the size of a cruiser with a special AP bomb that has to be manually aimed, is slow and can be shot down. However if it hits, it bypasses the shield and armour and does direct damage too the hull. This would add a Rock Paper Scissors element too the game. Just a thought.
---
"Supers have 80% of the tank of a titan but cost 1 / 4 of the price...."
---
That point got me thinking. I've never really been involved in the cap/super scene. What would the price point of supercarriers &amp; titans look like, currently?
---
That might work, but also seems like a nuclear hammer.  I like the idea of smaller groups but that seems too much.
---
Also this would just mean a greater reliance on outside tools. 
---
I'm against solutions that make things a pain in the ass.  This seems like it will kill the game for a lot of people.
---
it has to  be fun for you 
---
for the others who gives a shit
---
Do you know the way?
---
Good points!
---
open sphere? engage h4x? I can't remember how it goes xD
---
You add siege module and 10 minute spool up on that DD, i.e. now fax support for Titan while it spools up, then things get spicier. 
---
Now the biggest blob would just snipe keepstars of literally anyone.
---
This is alot of semi good ideas with extremely horrible ones.

Looks like a concern-troll post on deeper analysis. Major buff to whoever is biggest (Goons).

CCP in their infinite wisdom, added dangerous npcs to the game, but put them in an overview-group that is not shown by default.
---
Mining was never safe, but they're easily killed with some drones or evaded. (but then youll need a proper overview).
---
Try loading up an overview pack that has some sensible defaults; I personally quite like the AEGIS overview pack. Join ingame channel "AEGIS Settings" for links to loading it.
---
This Way.

CCP can migrated the tools people like / need into the game.

I sent an email to the UK Gambling Commission to ask whether the ability to RMT your ISK through secondary markets makes this legally gambling or not.
