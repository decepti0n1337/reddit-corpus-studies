Check out the mew Triglavian ships for LS!! They're awesome for small gang and LS generally.
---

---
Maybe something for your free SP... 😄
---
---
---
Nah.
---
Imo carriers should be the best subcap Vs small targets. Hell the purpose of their siege module is to be able to lock things before their fighters are all dead.
---
Carriers being able to be defanged easier makes them pointless. You'd just bring dreads instead.
---
That was a great video to watch. Simple, well-commentated, and fun. Thanks for the share man!
---
How much did sort pay you for that?
---
The security blog would like to show you some numbers of botters removed... 😉
---
Someone needs to volunteer to show this guy the game.  This question makes no sense and you guys know better.  He's just a curious noob
---
I mean it did also give us rorqs which was kind of terrible
---
Connection from the laptop to the display (usually in one of the hinges, it's a veeery thin and feeble cable).
---
Might also be a cold start to the laptop, try warming it up a bit before entering EVE.
---
I haven’t had the problem on anything except EVE and I’ll try that thabks
---
Peasants trained and rolling into town with Abrams battle tanks
---
Where the largest group in the game lives. They make it incredibly safe by bringing overwhelming, unstoppable force and then complain noone wants to fight.
---
Inability to avoid getting farmed if he does.
---
99/100, yeah you are just dead.
---
You're incorrectly assuming everyone injects everything.
---
As a player who doesn't inject like a maniac to get where he is, I got my first carrier around the start of this year. It took me fucking years to get there, and ages to get to the point when I had a couple of bil isk to spare to drop on it after plexing and buying the carrier skill etc.
---
Maybe you've reached the point where a bil is nothing, but I haven't, and nor have many players. The 20bil for a fitted super is a long way away from me.
---
CCP reveal themselves to have been the other CCP all along.
---
Is your pov on the Lasker bait incursus in this one?
---
Holding the phone vertical makes a vertical video.  If you hold it horizontal you’ll have a normal looking video.
---
Most legit answer we ll ever get about something from CCP :D
---
Noone's ever clean. You're just not logged in
---
they do a lot more than that, there is a lot of active pvp
---
the fact you have that predisposed notion shows your ignornace
---
I lost an SMA full of nice ships due to miscalculating the fuel requirements for a POS when I went to the field for a few days. Bad things can happen when you screw up. That’s one of the things that makes Eve great.
---
I asked soundwave for drone health visible in drone bay, and range slider on dscan.  Was a joyous day when we got those :]
---
You mean an award for highest salt generation per post ratio.
---
derp I forgot a big PVE one
---
* Raven, Raven Navy Issue, and Golem (ultra-long-range cruise missiles, escalating price and tank ability. All three of these are the same hull, and work fairly similarly.)
---
Aah didn’t know, I’m amused :)
---
Deep Strike the enemy's territory. Victory or Death!
---
&gt; the game is so vacant of hostility ^(you can use them with no risk.) 
---
Why is that?
---
Trying with all my might not to be salty but all I can say is, yes, people balancing either don't give a f***, are pants of head retarded or just don't exist and changes are made just for lulz.
---
Jumping into the butt of the universe is fun!
---
All 3 of these benefit.... and are answered with the same response. 
---
 **Why can Titans still fit HAWs?** 
---
null blocks. 
---
**Why can Supers still deploy light fighters and cruiser-tracking long range fighters?** 
---
**Why are excavators still a thing?** 
---
null blocks. S
---
**How is this not fucking obvious at this point?**  
---
Who runs the CSM, null blocks.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If there is some shit feature in this game and you wonder why its not removed or changed... null blocks.
---
What's that? Your BPO is getting stolen.... Boom... Freighter size BPO's .... and..... null blocks. So they will not be removed. 
---
Wonder where all my downvotes come from...null blocks. So they will not be removed.
---
What about the rest of EVE?
---
What about them ? Who are the rest ?
---
So it's gonna be at some guy's house then.
---
The AT is coming back
---
this 100000%
---
From my understanding they have a cap pool you can suck from but even once dry they can still use their modules like normal.
---
So pretty much combat probing would be useless.... way to think this through bro...
---
It might have started with when belt ratting was replaced with infinite combat anoms which made all space kinda equal. Also Dscan got a delay. That was a event majority of my hunter playstyle friends drifted out of the game.
---
People bought plex when it was at 300m so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.  
---
  
---
And no matter whether it would be working or not, they still don't "pay". And since you appearently wanted to bind your initial statement to that term to somehow be in the right you can't really argue someone being literal with it.  
---
It all boils down to the point that if people in highsec were organized like null (and actually cared about the CSM), then null blocs would have a hard time filling even half of the CSM.
---
never change
---
Perhaps the largest ship in game shouldn't be able to track the smallest ship in the game.
---
It's the reason tracking exists in the first place.
---
I mean missions are technically infinite as well. Anoms, if anything, are one of the last remaining ~content generators~ left.
---
I mean good luck killing bombers in HAW titans / light fighters. If you are in a titan getting dropped by bombers they most likely have enough to nuke you out of orbit.
---
Seconded inferno
---
Overtime.
---
Multiple orcas mining moons in hs
---
Join ingame chat channels of Bombers bar and Spectre fleet. They run public fleets, they always need logi.
---
It wasn't. Minerals and as such ships were more expensive, LP were more expensive, meta items 4-13 were more expensive.
---
Nah, Test was [founded on r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/b01lm/would_reddit_be_interested_in_an_eve_corp_we_have/).
---
But they nerfed super EHP, and added plates and extenders though
---
Removing citadel is wrong for obvious code and general QOL. It just need to be balanced. With a hammer. In the face. But number tweaking should be more than enough to fix them.
---
No filthy krab is my friend.
---
Tbh I wanted to reduce some Power Grid from this module in order to experiment with a new fit that it was kinda demanding. After 9 rolls, I got this that is more than enough :)))
---
Back then you just "docked" in a PoS and leave ship for something else...
---
By the way, its "bloc" not "block"
---
CSM is pushing for those things to remain. Shitty as they are. Since 90% of them are 0.0 krablords.
---
And CCP is shit for listening to them.
---
Right maybe it’s a screen text edited in after at the time of video production?
---
You mean revert back to what they were before lmao
---
Sorry but if we want reduce spam - the reduce of EC in each system is what we need. Also what i am proposing is not blocking you from dropping separate structure to increase safety or spread out.         
---
What i am proposing is to change mechanic in a way that it **don't force you to spam the structures** as current mechanics actually do it.                   
---
Specific grid can be moons or planets only - this is my point. Specify  Places you can put up structures .            
---
What do you mean by 
---
&gt; "Yeah so increasing it will also force to spreadout too ..." ?           
---
What i am saying again is about mechanics that promote dropping more and more structures just next door.             
---
What i am suggesting to merge system index into single constellation index or even regional index.          
---
So people **will have no incentive** to drop new structures in every free system to pay smaller taxes, but rather utilize structures they already have.          
---
I know multiple people that have industry spread out in 4 systems and in each they have the same structures rigged in the same way ... as it is cheaper this way - and for me it is nonsense.
---
I disagree. Yes, frigs die very quickly, but a dual webbed frig also warps out very quickly. Maybe gimmicky is the wrong word, but they basically break the convention of fitting tackle, hoping the other guy assumes they did fit tackle and doesn't notice in time (which I admit is not very long at all, especially if you're 1km off an incursus). Either way, you're giving yourself an "unfair" advantage by not using a mid to fit tackle, and instead use the slot for an advantage in the fight. And if you're comparing dual web incursus to breachers, i think you need to compare them to breacher fits that also don't use tackle.
---
Citadels would be fine ... if:
---
- Low Power really meant low power (NO Tethering, 48h max timers, NO asset safety unfueled)
---
- asset safety only on fueled L/XL-Structures, M-Size is POS replacement per definition and they had a full drop
---
- Supercaps/Titans could not dock
---
- Keepstars had a constellation/region limit
---
- Sotiyos had an "active build slot" limitation
---
- Athanors would at least mine 33% of the moons worth passively (bonus for active mining, but still incentive for pvp-content)
---
just some half-assed thoughts from office ...
---
- Trading fees/taxes on Citas would be thought over (not good to kill the biggest ISK sink while buffing the biggest faucet by mult. 100%)
---
Yeah this. If we didn't have citadels game would still be pretty crap for so many things. People forget pre-citadel life. Also the simple fact that without citadels being "good" people wouldn't use them. One aim CCP have had was to get people to move over to citadels and upwell structures from POS stuff so they can phase that out. We are actually almost at that point now after a few years.
---
Duuuuude fucking Syndicate and Gallente Lowsec 2013, or Placid Wars 2014-2015, or the dramalama after the Big Black Wedding and subsequent Snuff/PM/Waffles vs Shadow Cartel/Escalating Entropy fights in mid-to-late 2016.
---
Hey, if i want to kill your T1 frigate with my HAW Titan, that is none of your business!!!
---
You say that, but i mean watching a Horde titan Boson an NC. dread to death while trying to catch a fleet was glorious. I actually think AOE DDs are pretty solid balance wise, spool up time + the fact it hits anything opens up so much potential for fucking up. Was with Bjorn on a fleet and Init nearly DDed their own titan with multiple attempts to DD our frig fleet. It was down to no cap and almost no shield (rangarok)
---
https://zkillboard.com/war/650644/
---
Can confirm those fits are blingy
---
Haha thanks - time to get a 3rd toon!
---
At least you can run multiple thermal hardeners.
---
As others have said, spectre fleets.
---
But you also may want to roll up a few alpha pilots (so you can have 1 skilled for each cruiser) and throw them into a fw militia. Even in a T1 you can get the experience you need and it will be cheap.
---
Your idea does have some merit, if you had a good enough logi Corp then you could take contracts for people in high sec vs the war Dec lot. You keep them alive while they supply the grunts in dps
---
How is it " catastrophically game-breaking" ?  
---
Im fairly new to eve and i want to know why.
---
Source?
---
They talk like 20b is cheap, some people aren't playing the game since 2004 lol.
---
20b is a shit ton of money for a lot of people.
---
lol vedmak is shit
---
Dude the ones who own the supers have 0 reason to undock a subcap, isn’t that part of the problem everyone sees with these “all in one” combat ships .  Willing to bet you own a couple of your own, and quite like those toons being able to do k
---
The mission hubs are really quiet nowadays, and the mining systems are mostly AFK orcas or fairly obvious bots.
---
Thatd be a waste since your insults dont do any thermal damage.
---
While I'm training for a dread for some dank solo roams, the amount of people who cry about carriers is exponentially higher than those who cry about HAW dreads. 
---
I can't understand why.
---
A lone carrier dies far more easily than a lone dread. A lone carrier does far less damage than a lone dread. A lone carrier needs to drop 1/3 of its DPS to web something, and 2/3 if it wants to point something too. A dread does not.
---
Run a few incursions? They need logi too, gives you some practice of what to expect as one...
---
Aaaand CCP stops releasing skins...
---
TIL not fitting a point or scram is giving my self an unfair advantage 🤣
---
Just change the kiki slot layout
---
2/2/5 would force it to be more squishy when flown with the current stuka doctrine.
---
CCP Hilmar is being fired/quitting...
---
I think you just got baited by bill.
---
that or he's serious posting, but that would be worse.
---
&gt;If some of the tedium was removed, would the idea of fighting-for-fun-not-profit be feasible to you? 
---
Nope, still got no reason to do it.
---
##fireHilmar
---
&gt;and reduce their tracking to where they are only effective against battleship and bigger.
---
People don't fly battleships anyway. 
---
&gt;Jesus Christ kill excavators already while you're at it, if anyone is using them it's b/c they are A.) just completely disconnected or B.) the game is so vacant of hostility you can use them with no risk
---
How are you disconnected if you use excavs? I don't own any, but I'm wondering what your school of thought is. Also be the change you wish to see. Rorqs die all the time, excavs too. If you're complaining about excavators being too safe, go kill some. 
---
&gt;Replace them with sentry mining drones that mine about 25% more than normal mining drones and make them worth 4-500m isk.
---
So replace them with the next best thing, so someone else (or even you) can complain about them being OP a few months down the line??
---
&gt;larger numbers in fights meaning people might drop HAW dreads or carriers to repel subcaps
---
Depends if CCP listen to you, or the 15 threads a week about regular (non-super) carriers being OP, and how they shouldn't be able to track anything battleship or below, or web anything. Needing to drop 1/3 of my DPS to web someone, and then drop another 1/3 if I want to point someone else, and having fuck all local tank and less DPS than a dread still means carriers are OP in the eyes of some.
---
Why the fuck do people love haw dreads but hate regular carriers?? 
---
&gt;Seriously, just press the fucking 'off' button on excavators (replace them with sentry mining drones :P)
---
Excavs aren't a real issue imo. They were nerfed before. Saying they're "too safe" just means you aren't killing them enough. Also sentry mining drones make afk play easier. You don't even have to wait for drones to return anymore, they're next to you. Rorquals are fine by themselves. Running 10 of them at once is an issue, but very few people actually do that. Personally I think orcas should be able to use an excavator or two, that'd be great content. Maybe nerf their flight speed a fair bit too.
---
id join Logi for hire in a heartbeat
---
Weird that people come out to defend the current snore-meta.
---
Lordy
---
Don't they?
---
gnihihihi....
---
I tried the FOB thing in a rattle mostly since i never tried.
---
Not worth it solo, think i got 13mil. thought i was gonna get the full 750.
---
Fuck yes... This this,so much this...
---
Sorry, can you please explain to me what uses it has for combat ships, other than avoiding pvp like a coward?
---
Until you run into 100 muninns which snipe you from 100km. Iki is good for brawling smaller fleets and ganking caps, but will never become a mainline doctrine. Its niche.
---
Wrong.         
---
Corporation run by dedicated CCP employee supported by GM can solve many issues.         
---
People in this corporation don't get any roles other than default.       
---
They cannot drop new structures or declare wars.        
---
Corporation can be immune to wardecs and have few basic structures in the starting area.           
---
(aka astrahaus, raitaru, refinery and poco - all adjusted in a way that cannot be abused)               
---
So people can interact withe every structure - and near each structure can be object sending player to webpage describing what it is and how it can be utilized.             
---
&gt; For example CCP can put up a refinery in 1.0 that will pull and explode a rock from moon every 30minutes full of veldspar or make this planet under POCO produce only oxygen or water                  
---
CCP can put up new NPC station in the system with lvl 1 and lvl 2 agents.                   
---
Basically this can be almost NPC corp with some exceptions and by putting new players in one corporation you don't get situation like now that they are split between multiple starting corporations.       
---
**By putting a "CCP employee" and GM under the corp leadership you can easier explain to the new players what is corporation** and you can also teach them how to communicate between other players.           
---
By giving ability to "contact director (GM) or CEO(DEV)" you give people feeling that stuff is actually working - and the fact that those emails going to CEO will be mostly solved by automated bot pointing to proper wiki articles or in rare occasion by GM group you still get huge bonus to your retention rates.
---
&gt; No CCP could invest in DEV/GM/Player run starter corporation.
---
lol. This is probably your dumbest idea to date.
---
Well that's kind of what they have with injectors except instead of making xp you make isk with the option to turn it into xp.  
---
Not sure how it would change anything really though, just means people with jobs would get left behind without paying in more I guess?
---
You’d make more money and do more logi in an incursion fleet
---
Thats... actually a good idea
---
r/EvE please remove StainGuy's ability to post. TIA.
---
Where did I say it has uses it has combat ships, other than for avoiding PVP?
---
How would this help?  The problem with corps isn't finding them, it's finding a good one that isn't a scam.  No tool is going to help with that.  Most people just don't want to spend a lot of time in a game where scamming is part of the experience.  Don't really see how any UI change is going to fix this.
---
Imagine fighting anything that is not a muninn, lel. Theres fleetsizes between hyperblobs and small gangs btw fyi
---
If you lack basic conversation skills expect to be called out on it. If you join an open discussion forum, expect different opinions. If you can't handle all that, don't communicate with people. It's very simple.
---
Also, reported for personal attack.
---
1 rig is all it takees to get it to be faster than any other useful ship.
---
I'm not saying the idea is good or practical.
---
I'm just saying it shows a very petty, small human being when someone can't separate disagreement from rudeness. It also shows a person who can't bother backing up their own opinion with arguments, so it's counter to convincing anyone.
---
Oh wow, indoctrination is strong in this one
---
Because then new player corps have to then kick out shitlers instead of not letting them in to start. Also, most new player corps ate behind an ESI wall. And lastly, most new player corps are perma wardec'd
---
Can we not point and laugh at him first though?
---
Highly recommend trig invasions or incursions
---
Invasions are solo able ina good battleship or t3 remember to salvage.
---
LOL gurista fortress sucks need cruise missiles or a jump drive to make it quick. Shit spawns to far away.
---
I run a small hs Corp if your interested in the casual hs life hit me in pvt for info if interested.
---
I hunt npc hauler at asteroid belt for fun, I just collect all the strong box and maybe open it later for discovering % drop for each type of loot, for now my sample size is too low only one hundred box because I just started doing this last week..
---
Anti subcapital weapons...
---
U wot.
---
Or better yet, newbie corps run by ccp devs/gms/other ccp employees
---
You probably should check your grr gon hat gon first.
---
"REEE RULES REEE REEE"
---
E-Uni is the last place new players should go.
---
Well it just came out yesterday so we’ll see how it goes but you can turn off invites. Plus the search goes both ways - I can search for new people by selecting tags I want (that the user sets) and people can search for my clan based on clan tags. 
---
Seems simple enough to add tags for pvp, pve, mining, industry, etc. some of that already exists in the Corp recruit window. Add stuff like newbie friendly, alpha accounts, etc.
---
They shouldn't be effective against subs.
---
For this reason im of the opinion lance is mostly fine, boson needs to be nerfed or deleted. Reaper just needs a total re-work.
---
The corps in the search tool just click all the boxes trying to get as many suckers as possible. The low tier groups will always game the system in order to exploit new players.
---
Lances sound like they don't have any problems, DDing subs is dumb.
---
This is the most sensible idea beyond the current time-limited new player channel. 
---
Good idea, though Membership should be limited to a certain period (6 months)  or SP level (6month training equivalent, whatever).
---
U stupid then u asshole &lt;3
---
The whole fucking ui is useless for new players.
---
Yea don't try and do a refit like that.. You'll run out of ammo like a mad man trying to fuel 2 diff types with a cruiser cargo bay. Also travel refits are over rated. Some stabs a cloak and a prop are all you need to get away from a gate camp or Sabre. 
---
Just go for hmls the dps loss is negligible when you consider the range and application.
---
This totally seems like a Cia recruitment scheme.
---
I'll agree with you on Titans not having HAW guns, but Carriers/Supercarriers are literally meant to be subcap-killers. That's their entire purpose, since the rep bonuses were taken away. A supercarrier should be able to massacre pretty-much any subcap on the field, aside from a well-orchestrated attack with a good logi wing.
---
Everything should be added to agency.
---
EVE is not free to play it requires a subscription.
---
So when they make these ships even more useless and null blocs just blob the shit out of your small gang, will you take to reddit and cry about that too?
---
Not really. *Especially* not how they looked back in 2003, holy hell.
---
Ahh. from the fleetup api? I'm not touching that. This is esi.
---
oops.
---
I guess that makes more sense than what I was thinking :D
---
The answer is a nightmare and tachyons
---
Yeah. I can only carry around 20k Missiles, and with HAMs you hein through very quickly..
---
But some sites, like 8/10 or 9/10, ask for a certain DPS to be reached. IIRC it’s around 900.
---
Anyone saying how easy it would be to change System X into System Y without actually looking at the code is speaking out of their ass.
---
Vily complained at the CSM meeting about the Sotiyo loot cache getting stolen and nobody else in the CSM raised an objection to that point. It was probably bundled in an "easy fixes" package that is easy to implement for CCP.
---
Olmeca Gold came out and explained the whole situation (he is also in favor of the change). This was 100% a change pushed and approved by the CSM.
---
whats halo
---
its the idea that,  "oh i killed a titan cool, now he is just gonna pull other one out and go back to what he was doing."   
---
so people hate that others have so much money that they can just had back up titans.
---
Yeah, the only people complaining here are the ones that love to make billions in isk in absolute safety and pretend they're playing the game on hard mode because the system number is negative.
---
Zauron no es un problema de idioma....es un problema de poder adquisitivo la gran mayoria de potenciales usuarios de eve online de habla hispana se ubican en latinoamerica.... el ingreso per capita de esa region no esta en el mercado objetivo de los mmo.

so there is still something left to beat?
---
CCP RISE UP
---
I think so, I just need to do it.  I figured someone might have had a script already.  Hoping I can just make one that takes the 4 keys he uses and spit out a json of all your group fits.
---
This is so true, ive been in many corps and like 80% pretend to be something but in reality they are just garbage, they lure you wirg nice benefits but after joining you realise that it was nothing but bait to get the numbers going.
---
Those few corps that are honest about what they are and what not are those who actually get overlooked alot or dont even put an advertisement out
---
Sad really sad
---
I've done most of the gurista stuff with an Ishtar solo.. I don't think you need 900.. Slower for sure but I don't think you need that much for fsp and maze. It's been a while since I've done the penal complex maybe that one you need more but I don't even think it has a station sooo probably not.
---
Not saying your wrong just the 900 isn't exactly right. Even my ded tengu doesn't do that much. I think 700 is tops for it. It's been a while tho lol.
---
Clearly, people are still swinging at it.

He will add you to his KOS List and never take you off!

Caldari ships have a faint hint of UNSC, specially the new ones.

Look Burger learnt how to do the Floss!!!
---
Bad bot.
---
Try to send mail to npc director corp about something.     
---
But more or less yes.      
---
It will be easier to maintain the integrity of someone by spawning new player as NPC corp, instantly joining him to this corp and introducing mechanic that when he quits he will leave to the main NPC corp.
---
Yep, but maybe actual time online. This is why i see it as separate corp because after some time you will be ejected to NPC corporation you have choosed during character creation.   
---
Less things to "rework"
---
Hopeful Yet Prepared For Inevitable Disappointment Due To Having Met Him Damn I Wish We Never Adopted Him In The First Place go to your room.
---
No
---
Which one
---
In CAS they just have affiliate corps to own the structures. Afaik, there's almost no difference between being in that npc Corp and being in any other Corp in a small alliance.
---
Yea.  It's not a dig on Eve, it's just what it is.
---
Inject them and will get it
---
https://i.imgur.com/2Oluj5j.gif

injection is just a few days of training. this tells you which skills to train, and why.
---
As of last weekend when my MacBook took the update I had to reinstall Steam. But I could play EVE no problem. So unless something happened between now and last Sunday I should be able to still play
---
Did they name you after CCP or Nebraska?
---
The CSM's optimism following the summit seems to be in complete contrast to general player opnion. So I'm going into this cautiously optimistic.
---
The special edition 60 day card was for creation of a new account, it could not be used on an existing account. When applied it should give you 60 days of Omega.
---
So essentially the big hang up to fixing a bad mechanic is the unintended consequences on a different bad mechanic...
---
But yeah, you're not wrong. That said, I think it's still the right move. It'll royally fuck with sov for a couple of months before CCP implements a change to sov/ADMs to fix it, and given how stable things have been lately that's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
Olmeca pretty much became one. Starts to support more and more blob opinions, i assume he got turned by goons on the csm summit. Became the thing he fought against.
---
Thanks man, I'll give that a shot
---
Removing learning skills (well maxing them out but same thing) made some bittervets mad ("you're making the game too easy!") but it was 100% the right call to make. I said back then that they didn't go far enough, that attributes and remaps are needlessly complicated, and I still feel that way.
---
The only thing that isn't confusing is implants, but before giving newbies implants we should be teaching them about why jump clones are a good idea (and consider reducing the clone timer).
---
&gt;expense of all others
---
What expense would that be ?
---
Nullsec has more unused space and more small entities than it has had in a long time and all of them behave in exactly the same way as those grrr massive alliances.
---
Thanks! Now it makes sense to me. So roaming trigs chase you even after warping out conduit? Interesting
---
Let’s not dumb down eve. I like the complexity. All you have to do is read up on remaps. Reakly not that hard.
---
Core gameplay would be things like:

- SP Generation (my bet is on this one) 
---
- How warping works
---
- Isk rewards for bounties
---
- Anomaly generation
---
- New gameplay features (like a matchmaking feature for abyssal sites or something)
---
If anyone has a null rat fit ishtar, rattle or t1 bs, and what there able to run as far as anoms been out of null for a bit now.
---
can never go wrong with sisters of mercy
---
+1
---
Bad spin is bad.  That's a damn solid fight for both sides.
---
Thanks! Could you recommend any good fit/ship for long range jammer? T1/pirate ship if possible pls
---
I don't mind having ISK faucets, I just don't think pirates in nullsec is the right one. After all, why pay bounties for self policing areas? I think the dynamic would be much more interesting if pirates were a threat you deal with because you need to protect your alliance space, as opposed to something purely for solo profit.
---
Yes
---
Then for now, I wouldn't get into Rorqs (or any other capitals for that matter.)   
---
It's not a bad idea to fire-up an alpha-account or two right now, get them training into some helpful stuff, Mining, drones, all the fitting skills, etc. Don't need to do anything with them aside from keeping the skill-queue filled-up every few days.
---
If  you're thinking PVE in Hisec then Abyssal content pretty much runs the gambit. Deadspace instances can be gotten into with a Alpha/low-SP char and can go all the way up to multiboxing frigates. So it's as easy/AFK or as hard/focused as you want it to be and the rewards scale appropriately. Then there's Abyssal Invasion fleets and solo or fleet Emerging Conduits.
---
Uhh that doesn't mean an actual game update, it could be a talk on the updates to core gameplay, or an update on the status of the core gameplay.
---
The only csm I talk with are exooki and olmeca
---
Which one was this? i cut out a lot of fights unfortunitly
---
You ain't stuck in a single system any more than anywhere else, you just have to scan and warp to a wormhole instead of just warp to a gate and you have new neighbours every day.
---
You should log into your accounts to verify that they haven't been hacked and all your SP been siphoned
---
The Vasari would sue Upwell so fast.
---
I mean the money is good in getting other people to run missions and/or mine for you, so what is the incentive at this point to not do it?
---
As if the people representing the blue donut will waste their time listening to randoms. Durr hurr yup
---
I miss the CCP roadmap. The one where they actually laid out a vision for the game and gave a rough timeline. 
---
Eve still had issues then, but at least players had a sense of where the game was going. Had usually awesome trailers to go along with the theme. Actually made me want to watch keynotes.
---
Mining is and has always sucked.
---
But now the meta is just multiboxing as many rorqs as possible. Everything else barely covers the cost of the electricity to run the computer.
---
Nothing like chaining sweet spawns to all the belts and have one random crazy person come in and ruin it!
---
God I just want an excuse to play again, please CCP i want to give you my money but you havn't added anything interesting tot he game in years....
---
The point is to go blow people up.
---
Train a bomber and join the bombers bar channel. Go on a fleet. Get your dick hard.
---
All rats are replaced by Diamond rats.
---
You realize the entire purpose of battleships were originally to be the strongest rarest ships in the game?
---
It was pretty hype, but narrative-wise almost total garbage.
---
No. 
---
Has nothing to do with consent, but balance and force projection. Cynos are an abomination regarding the way the rest of eve works.
---
It caused, in my opinion, most of the major issues in the entire game. It’s just poor design.
---
But matches are one week long.
---
The shak is as op as it gets. Can output dps of three battleships. Has great range, utility, and tank. The only reason you don't see these oppressing the meta is because caps are that much more op over subs.
---
So we can mine in badgers and rokhs?
---
Geddon navy with mega pulse, multi freq (general purpose) , scorch (stupid long range) , and conflag (if they are webbed and/or bs or larger) my geddon navy has 350k ehp and just over 1000 DPS (in a HG Amulet clone)
---
Yes I know it's stupid to put that much isk into this ship but I have isk to burn and I do things like this for the meme
---
It ends up not mattering that much, considering when cloaked they move faster than uncloaked.
---
So you can always decloak immediately into warp
---
Bots complain less, and always pay their bills.
---
rate of fire increse actually means a cycle time reduction of x%. This means DPS goes up by factor of 100/(100-x). Drake with T2 heavy missiles firing Scourge Fury has a DPS of 286 with perfect skills and 243 with rapid firing 0 (not really possible I think) Anyways, rapid firing 5 gives an overall 15% rate of fire bonus and 243\*100/(100-15) = 285.882352941 while 243\*1.15 = 279.45.
---
(edit drake with no damage mods that is and 6 launchers. It's just to give example numbers from pyfa)
---
&gt; good lord the training time needed.
---
Just wait until you learn about skill injectors...
---
Would a roadmap trick you into resubbing? Also hope you’re having a good week bro!
---
bro 😎💪
---
I can remember wasting a good 3 months before someone mentioned Core Skills because heaven forbid I know wtf I'm doing at first.
---
[removed]
---
Running the 32 bit version won’t work if you upgraded to the latest macOS.
---
I would like Carrier's faction flavors get a rebalance and the +5% HP per level and the FSU HP bonuses removed entirely.
---
I miss the blackout for rorq mining. Fuel was so cheap and it was nice quiet mining with miner IIs.
---
But ultimately, the best thing CCP can do is create some sort of focal point for conflict. Right now it's a game of League of Legends with no nexus to blow up and we're all such in the farm/laning phase forever. There's incentive to roam and gank lanes, but there are no global objectives to generate meaningful conflict.
---
&gt;core gameplay update
---
&gt; Introduce a new trig ship, even more rorq/super nerf, promise FW matter
---
Can't tell if weeb or just a random joke...
---
Eve is like fishing or gambling. Boring and painful until that exciting moment happens. The adrenaline makes you addicted and you keep on.
---
Must be the EVE and Azure Lane crossover event everyone is talking about; those Marauder waifus are hot!!
---
I love sotio kills almost as much as sotiyo kills.
---
Sorry, ccp is only looking for easy to implement solutions to complicated problems that don’t have a high design or development cost attached to it, as seem by recent csm notes.
---
If you have soecific rats drop things after defense that you sell to NPCs for your ISK faucet, like tags in FW.  Lore wise, it's NPC governments rewarding you for eliminating growing threats.  "Good thing you destroyed that pirate dreadnought, it was headed for Amarr next!"
---
Except it really isn't
---
Those are like skill timeframe boosters right?
---
It's hard to say. I think it would nudge me that direction. Not 2 months into marriage so I'm kind of working on that primarily, but my pc just needs to be hooked up and I could resub. 
---
Blackout was interesting idea but without a vision. You can not develope a game by throwing shit against a wall and hoping it sticks. They need to have a plan. Honestly everything points to login grabs to inflate numbers for a bonus. Just my outside looking in eyes.
---
I was in the same place as you last month. I decided to try and figure out solo pvp in faction warfare and grinding up to level 4 missions. That kind of mixes it up and gives you somewhat of a goal.
---
Lot's of good suggestions for pvp. For pve I'd suggest abyssal frigates as it helps you with manual piloting. My friend and I sometimes do t3 darks in cheap Hawks to warm up before a nano roam. Or another suggestion is going into wormholes together to do the data and relic sites. The one hacking can be bait, and the other can be cloaked up on a perch.
---
Take care m8. - tricky
---
By bloc residents you mean sov homesteaders and dwellers compared to your sov pillagers.
---
If they are destructive, just kill them.
---
Or find some other job for stats.
---
But yes, death to attribute based learning speeds.
---
I have to admit that i still have that mentality ... after several years.
---
While true, with Upwell's Pervasive Economy research done, the Vasari can be told to kick rocks in a settlement that means absolutely nothing to Upwell.
---
I'm currently questioning my continued subscription (4 accounts), as the game has really changed over the years (started 2009), becoming more and more hostile towards industry players.
---
Mining was only a small part of what I occasionally did, but I had to abandon that completely a few years ago.  Since then, conditions have worsened.
---
Upwell structures, asset-safety, and system indicies, are also a big part of the industry problem, but not for the reasons most often cited by PvPers.
---
You can just give-in and join Goons, but making it in a small group, or even solo, is really out of the question now.
---
I thought I'd be playing Eve until the lights went off.  Now, I'm realising that I've been playing in the dark for quite a while.
---
Log Horizon was the same thing But Better.
---
Are you denying that Brave Collective spams the ramjag?
---
That's where you're wrong bucko
---
The problem is that it's a game feature with no upside. You either min-max and have a useless pilot for like 6months-1 year or you spread everything and take extra weeks to train into some ships or worse case you waste your remaps and are now stuck in a crappy remap for a year.
---
Dumbing down EVE has always had the opposite to the desired effect. Fuck newbies tbh... Make EVE hard as fuck, that was its niche.
---
The solution is to bring more miners than the people who "take your ore" (it's not your ore until you bring it back to a structure or station).
---
Honestly, whatever ores you're seeing pop up where you are. The requisite ones should be Mercoxit, Gneiss, Arkanor, Bistot, Crokite, and Spod. Other than that it comes down to preference.
---
best ship is friendship
---
Maybe they finally remove attributes after all these years. Then I can come back again and skill whatever comes to my mind without thinking about optimal SP gain.
---
Yeah sure. Make eve easier. It should have no consequences for not learning about the game /s
---
Oh gotcha. That’s just what my support ticket told me to do.
---
Hi, please learn to read. I stated that putting limits on what a corp could put into their advert was dumb, and I explained why. If all you got out of that is my dislike for shitty mobile games then you should probably practice reading.
---
I don't have to put forth an idea to know yours is shit.
---
It's actually a feature announcing new Trig structures that bend space and time to forward it and make attacking structures less boring.
---
Nope. Its just as boring as you are perceiving it.
---
It would be cool. Like passive moon mining but disrupt-able.
---
One of the most demotivating experiences i've had as a new player is being donated too much isk. Your first cruiser means so much more when you've saved for it and slowly replaced those basic turrets with meta 4's. This is actually the playstyle keeping me going at the moment -- convert exploration ISK to PLEX then use whatever's leftover to fit my ships.
---
I'm not the economy guy, but it sounds like reducing the cost to build ships would cheapen them overall, reducing their *percieved value*.
---
EVE is all about longer term goals, if you're not working toward affording that simulated fit, what else do you playing for? This was part of the appeal of SP/s pre-injector days.
---
Although on the other hand it also sounds like ISK deflation, which is apparently a good thing. Who knows.
---
What is your greatest experience doing the 3 years
---
dont go to one of the franchise hair cuttery places man. find a great traditional barbershop.
---
simple Yes or No question
---
Guy whose CSM rep says he doesn't want content defending guy complaining about lack of content
---
99% corp tax 😂
---
You cannot ship chat channels in a courier contract and I can't think of anything else you'd ever want to have moved around, so I'm going to say "never".
---
CCP - the core of our gameplay is new players.
---
I'm glad there IS a tool to use. However, finding a corp sucks and it's difficult.
---
The bigger issue with new player retention is that the game is boring. It's REALLY boring early on. Boring and pointless. Then to have to deal with corp hunting? That's pretty awful. I finally found a corp but just like the other times I'm pretty much the only one online most of the time. Still a little better than an NPC corp though even though I can't actually think of a reason why that would be.
---
Right now I log in and get my SP from the log-in events. Then I log out and go play something that has stuff to do.
---
Hate to break it to you man but you will never be able to weaken null alliances to a point where average Joe's can hold sov.
---
As for ccp they probably understand that these large organizations are what pay their bills and anything silly will have a significant impact on cash flows. Plus ccp need to focus on creating real content and ship balance.
---
As I said, I don't fly them, and I haven't seen them 'spammed'.
---
But that may happen when I'm not online.
---
Obviously, you think Brave does, so run with it.
---
How are you incapable of just typing YES or NO?
---
OK, here's an update:
---
https://twitter.com/BraveNewbies/status/1184931377826811905
---
I’m sorry that small ships aren’t enough of a catch all answer for you bro i truly am :(
---
I feel bad that big ships being on one grid will beat smaller ships in their range and the smaller ships have to use their vast mobility to go somewhere else.. Truly that’s horrible.  Every time a frigate dies to a cruiser I cry with you brother, and big scary capitals that couldn’t dream of catching something uncommitted... them sitting there and shooting things grrrr i hate it too!
---
If only they couldn’t shoot so the little ships didn’t even need warp speed buffs.  Warping off is so unfun and picking fights isn’t fair!  It should be easier!  I’m so upset with you and sorry it seemed like it whooshed me because i didn’t bow down to this logic more openly like I am now
---
Why are they big grrrr too big it’s stupid that they’re bigger than what you wanna fly and they can shoot those things :(((( ccp please ban everything bigger than frigates
---
Still not a YES or NO to my question here on Reddit.
---
"When I'm bored on SiSi, I warp to sun and take some pictures."
---
And lose almost every player because who the fuck wants to train all their skills again.
---
I agree - this is a great idea.
---
I'm glad I started after some of the ships got updated. I don't like flying ugly, shitty asymmetrical things, even if they perform well.
---
The Rokh in particular I think.
---
&gt;The various options shouldn't be player configurable, they should be automatically selected based on ingame activity stats
---
So much this. Anything else is an EZ option game the system in a way that only hurts new players and corps who do try to represent themselves accurately in the tool.
---
Fire Hilmar.

---
We have enough in game politics. Don't need out of game politics in game.
---
Fuck you for avoiding reality. I hope war comes to your doorstep and you get to watch a group of soldiers take turns going at your mother and your sister.
---
But if you tell the truth on /r/Eve you get downvoted.
---
I am a returning player that is looking to find some PVE activities some low SP pilots can join in on and contribute. I have been running emerging conduits solo, which has been fun, but if they jumped in they would probably be close to one shot. Does anyone have some ideas of fun activities for a three person squad?  I have 80m sp while they have around 3mil sp.
---
Im not asking for support for fucking spamming, i'm asking for the rules to enforced equally you dipshit.
---
It's a way of fitting Jaguar assault frigates that is exceedingly good at tackling ships. This fitting (and variations) are known at the "ramjag".
---
Currently they are much more effective at tackling than any interceptor.  No other ship is currently able to do the job better, so people a lot of fly the "Ramjag".
---
Lol what are you talking about, only people I see complaining on here is people not in a bloc. Who whine about super umbrellas, you’ll are the bitches that can’t do shit against our fleets so you go and whine about it all day on reddit. Get off your high horse and stop being a pussy who want free kills.
---
oh noes
---
I'm not incapable.  I'm just not doing it.
---
Green killboards the easy way
---
You chose to comment on this. You chose.
---
Ore buy-back is nice.  The idea is that miners can sell the corp their ore, usually from wherever the mining took place.  It's easier for the miners and usually results in them getting paid faster.
---
Two possible ways of doing it:
---
1. Direct Market Orders.  Place a buy order at your mining station for your buyback rate.
---
- Pro: Super simple for all parties
---
- Pro: Miners are paid on-demand
---
- Con: Miners immediately lose 2.25-5% depending on their Accounting level.
---
- Con(?): Buy orders are public, so non-corp members can take advantage too.
---
2. Contracts.  Miners contract you ore they mine.
---
- Pro: Less fees (flat 10,000 isk brokers fee per contract)
---
- Con: Takes longer to get paid (corp leadership needs to log in)
---
- Con: Corp needs to verify correctness of the contract price
---
I know XD
---
If we got built in vchat in local I might just have to retire from Eve.
---
Politics are unavoidable. And once again if they had problems with people spamming, why the fuck didn't they do anything about the stick man, or the triple V? 
---
Are you that fucking blind? If this is about rules, they should enforced upon everyone. By throwing that out the window CCP is making this political.
---
&gt;Null players are okay with it not being safe,
---
as long as they can make more money than they loose or as a business would call it being profitable...
---
You know economics 101...
---
Cant get dank ticks if your taking screenshots at the sun...
---
&gt;Fuck you for avoiding reality. I hope war comes to your doorstep and you get to watch a group of soldiers take turns going at your mother and your sister.
---
You're a pathetic individual. 
---
I hope they ban you tbh. The game is better without cunts like you.
---
I thought sharing GM communication was against the rules?
---
you mean except the triglavian ships, triglavian invasions, blackout, cyno changes, and so on
---
I'll be sure to!
---
They need to explode, not change hands.
---
Take your head out of your ass.
---
Blackout, BOO. 
---
All null sec does is whine.  Blue donut, no good fights, risk averse kiters, pve, just to name the weekly null sec bitch session.
---
Fuck off.  
---
If I wanted to dive into shit, I'd go to one of politics subs.  
---
Keep Eve and r/eve free of this crap.
---
Read this bit https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill_training#Training_skills
---
Pretty much just scroll down from there. EVE Uni is an amazing website for new players to find out answers to questions.
---
Different skills have different attributes, the player can change their attributes by "remapping", but you can only do this once per year, although you do get 3 free remaps when you start.
---
If a skill needs Intelligence and Willpower attributes, the higher you have those attributes remapped to, the faster they train. However, the next skill you want to train needs Charisma and Memory. Since you are only moving attributes around rather than getting more attribute points, that second skill might train slower if you took points from those attributes to remap them to Intelligence and Willpower for that earlier skill.
---
Hope this helps o7.
---
War...
---
This comment interested me as I thought that it was a superpower clamping down on unrest in an annexed territory.
---
No, y'all are a bunch of retards that can't fucking read.
---
This isn't about the situation in Hong Kong and it shouldn't be. This is about the selective enforcement of policy. People have been placing Mobile depot's throughout Jita since I've been playing the fucking game.
---
I do the same thing, name them something provacative and now I'm receiving this message? Why have that not done a damn thing about any other player spamming Mobile Depot's.
---
When you don't enforce the rules it makes things that aren't okay for anyone, seem okay for everyone. Now because of their irresponsibility they're threating my shit and I still a whole shit ton of other Mobile depot's sitting up in jita, at 4-4 at the gates and somehow only mine are a problem?
---
No dude, and the fact that none of you can see that as a problem is a huge problem all by itself.
---
4.20 isk
---
You're Killin your isk/hr. Park an alt there and enjoy the beauty anytime
---
y'all are a bunch of retards that can't fucking read.
---
Right, definitely not.
---
I agree with you. I also agree with the idea of going after political bullshit hot and hard first is a good thing.
---
Could it be???   Hull tanking with corpses?
---
I've fought Lokley on the stream before.
---
You don't have to do that much more than F1 monkey stuff. There's more individual initiative involved, but unless you're flying a nano fleet, you're still mostly going to just be told to fly the same ship (or close) as everyone else, stay near everyone else, and shoot the same person as everyone else. And wormholers really like heavy, brawly fleets. Unless you're in MCAV or some group like Tuskers or WAFFLES which lives in a C2 and mostly operates out of the Null connection, it's not going to be that much different from the usual SovNull F1 monkey fight, just with everything occurring at much shorter range and far fewer capital ships.
---
FW PVP is good too. I much prefer the small fights of that over SovNull's practice of docking up whenever they can't bring overwhelming force. There isn't usually a good reason to undock anything larger than a cruiser and even that can be pushing it, so replacing ships can be quite affordable.
---
This is basically me rn. I did all the tutorial and starting missions and I've even mined a bit but i still dont know what to do or how to get started.
---
How can you focus on three things at once? /s
---
If the code doesn't work, you might be able to get 2 months of gametime for it if you open a ticket with a GM. Worth a shot, maybe.
---
It's gone homer.
---
I doubt sov fees, invention fees, and titan books directly affect newbros.
---
Exactly. I just got back onto the game after awhile away and I have no complaints and everyone that I've interacted with in game seem to be having fun. 
---
Then I come on here and I'm wondering if I'm even playing the same game
---
My screenshot is on top ? O.o :3 My time to shine \o/ Weeee.
---
I wonder how many times you didn’t die by randomly warping to the sun...
---
Tell that to the employees trying to cash paychecks, the electric companies trying to collect their bills, and hardware companies trying to collect on their invoices.  Don't worry guys, money is not of value.
---
Your literally dumb as fuck you’ll are the ones bitching about the blue donut. Oh and look what happened during blackout, ccp lost so many players that they didn’t keep it.  Maybe that tells you that most of the players don’t agree with you and all I’ve seen these past few months is people bitching about a super cap umbrella mostly shitty ass people like your self.  Your the reason people say if you want to have fun in eve stay off Reddit. Oh and if we weren’t around neither would the Game be. Acting like 75 percent of people who play don’t live in null. Take you’re shitty play style and cry some more because that’s what you’ll are best at.
---
