Well, I tried to find another message between the lines but... Doesnt your theory boil down to "Just make the competent dudes leave the game"? I do not exactly see the advantage for EVE as a whole there.

All of the beams definitely hit during that shot, in fact. Also, during "missing" shots, graphically usually the beams only diverge by about a ship-width or less, definitely not 90 degrees.
---
The same thing was happening with non-killing shots, so that doesn't appear to be the problem either!

Why not implement overextension penalties like in Eu4 ? You need to declare a HQ and the further you are from said HQ the bigger the reward but also the greater the risk : delayed local, delayed cyno activation for ratting ship whatever. It would keep your core safe but the real isk would mean risk.
---
Some people would try out of game agreements/use of alt corps to use a loophole but let's make sovereignty a real things with npc navy shooting external people ratting in your space, only members of your coalition have a bonus to ratting or mining in your space. Just throwing ideas.

Use a buddy code to make an account!! If you don’t have a friend that already plays or anything [here’s mine! ](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=a51bc1ad-153c-45aa-98f8-a189537c3790) 
---
It’s awesome to hear that you’ve been waiting so long to play the game. Honestly it’s free to play so don’t even feel pressured to put money into it! Create an account, jump in, and learn. Best advice I can give you; do the tutorial in its entirety and then from there find what you like to do, then find others to do it with! This is an amazing universe but it’s huge and better if your with others. Most groups nowadays require all kinds of players (PvP/PvE, industrial, logistical) so you’ll be useful wherever you go, you don’t have to find a dedicated group like you used too.

Like I said, Eve is massive, so take your time and enjoy it. :) The help channel is great, use it!

# FAQ
---
## What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
## Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
---
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
Just my 2 cents really but maybe dont do them in Jita?
---
What elite organisation? They went into bed with goons to stock up supers etc. Then dropped them in lowsec since noone could counter them. They are as elite as any other group with a Lot of big toys
---
Why delete nados when they delete you?
---
Do you use undock bookmarks, instant dock bookmarks? Do you use travel fit for cloak+mwd trick on gates?

I am sure that you don’t. Read about it and don’t  die in hi sec in an expensive ship ever again.

Wouldn't this just create a "crop rotation" system where an alliance holds two/three regions and cycles ratters (and their associated umbrella) across them every month or two?

Agreed, and compared to droneboats subcaps it requires your full attention otherwise you'll lose fighters in no time.
---
Honestly if you have only one account you must be crazy to buy a capital because you won't be able to move it without using beacons (RIP) or asking people for cynos.
---
If you have at least 2 accounts the effort/reward ratio of two ratting ishtars/domi is much better, if you also loot and salvage it's even better.
---
Obviously I'm comparing to ratting carriers, with supers it's a different story, but still using them with one account is even more stupid.
---
They have a NIP and a Mutual Defence agreement. Not the same as being blue ;)

bad wording: change "neighbors" to "relevant stakeholders"

It took 10 real people several hours of scouting and preparation of their time to do this gank. Is 20 - 30 manhours enough effort for you?
---
Sure.  It was a one hour flight for me to get to EVE Down Under, and then spent several days in a hotel.

Eh, who cares... They got salty because it's true...

Those 2 things are mutually exclusive. It won't be anywhere close to even a BS if u fit it for cargo space.

And even then you would need to dock up after every single structure you scoop...

Picking up cap charges in PvP is a whole different thing, unless of course you pick them up as loot for sale.

---
Who said anything about ever restarting the servers
---
To add some more info and reply to all those "no skill, no brains, unfair" comments:
---
Suicide ganking IS unfair. It took 10 players (scout and hauler are not on killmail) just to kill one guy, because we dont multibox much and went for ganking just because of 100% loot. We also took some newbros (in their freshly created refferal boosted alts) with us to have fun and educate them. The Ishtar actually reppped quite fast thanks to ADCU which he managed to activate. If we were only 4 - 5, we would probably fail to kill him. 
---
Time is a main factor. We were ganking for about 3 hours and only got two kills. This type of ganking is literally hours of scanning and scouting. It takes some planning, coordination and patience to get all the people required and find good targets. Its not just "warp in, F1". 
---
Of course, once we have all the planning and scouting done and we have all the people on grid and ready, he was pretty much fucked. But it takes tens of manhours to arrange. If he also had 9 friends with him as we did, could would jamm us/kill us easily. You are always weak solo.
---
clear cache, prevent overflows and/or serverside updates. take your poisen

Oh really? Then how does a newbie get his ISK then? 
---
Ratting? Grinding
---
Mining? Grinding
---
Exploration? Yeah that's grinding, with a little bit more grinding sprinkled over...
---
The only thing that's not grinding at this point is trading and manufacturing but you'd need to do a lot of shit that would make it seem like grinding anyway for it to be successful, and even then you'd still need to grind a fair bit first to get the starter capital to do those activities in the first place...

Negative. Nothing had changed. Went to bed with all modules online, woke up short of cpu.
---
Yes the loki works as well, and so does the Legion, the tengu is more popular for pve
---
Rather whine on r/eve about it!
---
A normal T2 Nidhoggur should have about 3k dps. Included is basic Fighter F1 but also Fighter Torpedo F3, if you run out of Torpedos you need to refill and return them to hangars in your carrier.
---
So usually you have Torpedos for about the first two waves and then you drop to normal Fighter F1 dps. That normal dps is a little bit higher compared to a Rattlesnake, thats what I wanted to hint at. With my old sneksneksnek I got about 45mil-50mil ISK ticks, a normal carrier should be at about 55mil-60mil ISK per tick. Supers are at 90mil ISK in fulltank up to 150mil-160mil ISK per tick if fitted for full application and hyperspartial (good old warpspeed Nyx). Dreadnoughs are at about 70mil-80mil ticks, you need to wait until your siege ends so thats not as fast but you can take a lot of smoke breaks.
---
You can hover over your dps in the Fittng menu [Alt]+[F] and look into normal Fighter dps and what Torpedos actually add to that.
---
I'm thinking about getting one of those normal Carriers fitted for dank ticks because then I can crab with two Accounts at the same time but tbh a Super might be comparable and way more safe.
---
They snuffed off
---
&gt;but theres always some dropped packets during a migration
---
With the introduction of time dilation I'd be surprised if it wasn't much easier.
---
Although that said, a decent VM host architecture will do migrations near instantly.
---
Not a chance in EVE or Hell.
---
Well Abyssal is a bad design anyway, I don't get why you should be able to farm ISK in an instanced area in a game where every thing has always been designed to be "open". And now you want no "pvp" drawbacks ? Come on it's EvE we all love/hate this game because of this. What is so cool in this game is the "risk".
---
As the OP nice to see some good debate around this.  For sure as I mentioned there is still a blue donut and yes people will still see the coalition  map.  But its better than it was where coalitions are giving more alliances actual decent space.
---
People say stop capitals etc that's fine but I do think it's far too late.  Goons for example still.have literally 1000s of capitals supers and titans.  It doesnt solve the problem unless CCP literally deleted them from game.  I really dont know what the answer is.
---
I still think there is a very unhealthy amount of space being rented. 
---
But the whole people that can help eve change are now these coalition leaders because its grown so big  unless something actually stops it like a game mechanic then only people can change it.  I worry we are moving into serenity land now though...from a coalition perspective
---
EVE Uni is a good place to start learning how to play in my opinion. One of the things thats nice is they have separate "Campuses" that focuses on certain locations or focuses in the game. If you want to learn how to survive in Wormhole space, there is a wormhole campus that is dedicated to that stuff. Interested in Mining? Go to the Amarr Mining Campus. I'm mentioning this because not a lot of other people seem to, and think the Uni is only the High Sec Campus, which is probably the worst campus IMO.
---
Also if you aren't interested in any of this, the Uni maintains https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page which is a pretty good Wiki site for all the details in the game.  I ended up joining the Uni because I was using the Wiki so much.
---
Sure, sure...
---
It amazes me that someone saw EVEs ancient UI and went “THAT IS MY UI! Copy that exactly!”
---
you are fucking stupid
---
&gt; Theres no need to shut them down for that kind of resource management.
---
Maybe so, but those didn't exist back then/aren't integrated into the existing code.
---
I'm just pointing out one of the major areas where the current system requires downtime, and it would likely be one of the harder places to update to more modern techniques.
---
Thanks. How are you getting the graph with one ship"vs another? I have the "DPS vs Range" graph open but all I'm seeing is a section to manually add sig/speed of target ship; not seeing the option to connect two ship fits and graph the outcome.
---
Eve is an old game, and in the core there are a lot of legacy code at work. It wasn´t designed for todays server structure, though I have to say, they have made a very good job to so far to update it.   
---
Thing is, every time you shoot a missile, throw out a container, or create an item in space, it gets added to the database with its onique ID and everything, and while a lot of old spawning mechanics are still tied to the server restart, all new content isn´t part of that anymore. So the downtimes are only used for those old legacy mechanics, and getting rid of those old, unused items in the database
---
&gt;and it would likely be one of the harder places to update to more modern techniques.
---
Not really, if it's running in bare metal if be surprised and even if it is on bare metal, just move to VMs.
---
The moment you're on VMs, resource management becomes incredibly easy because you just the the orchestrator do the work, no real need rewrite anything.
---
Nice to see us on the map.
---
Hi friend,
---
As someone who would have knowledge of any "agreements" with any of these groups, I can assure you after we glassed Tribute into a parking lot, we just fucking left. We didn't give anyone "permission" to move in. We have no agreements. We just didn't fucking care what happens to the region....gasp....like like we fucking said we didn't care as the war was going on and everyone kept asking us what we were going to do.
---
We.
---
Do.
---
Not.
---
Care.
---
The people who live up there now have moved in on their own through their own intelligence, fighting ability, or diplomatic ability in the northern area. We, in the Imperium, didn't "install" any of these people and continue to give no fucks about any of them or that area.
---
So.....yeah.
---
That sov map makes me miss eve so much. I fought so hard to break my alliance into a coalition member, ‘‘twas at the cusp of the transformation as it all unraveled and the coup d'é tat was sprung. 
---
Grand experience but after logging in since then.. the way the game presents itself is riddled needless new features that water down the game.

Suicide ganking is that joke that will never die. You think it stopped being funny years ago, then you see a thread like this.

TOXIC have no blessings from anyone to live in Tribute , more to the point if anyone offers us their ’blessings to remain’ I’ll say fuck off, come evict me. I’ll then either get evicted or hold the line, we are not scared to lose in Hazardous Company, these knees don’t bend.
---
Rush the cash until its at drone control range, launch drones and rush the conduit, once at conduit drop your mtu (preferably a magpie), wait, loot, exit. Save cap as long as you dont need to tank if there are starving npcs. Take care to always stay at jump range of origin and at scoop range of mtu

&gt; I am sorta confused about some of the people's comments about VINDI being "pussies" or "tucking tail and running" You do know VINDI isn't leaving Cache or moving right? Winter Co. is leaving us and we decided we didn't want to go into drone lands so we'd stay and fight for our little corner whatever the cost be but hey spin away my guys :P
---
Ouch that didn't last long
---
Gila's absolutely can be pvp ships. Ive seen solo and small gang gila's do pretty damn well in a lot of scenarios. Their engagement profile is pretty high. 
---
Yeah 1/4 being a win might be profitible, but when 9/10 people in the proving conduit is an ikitursa, thats a fools errand.
---
how the fuck is op whining? 
---
you're the only one whining here bro, go outside once in a while
---
Plus mining moons if fun, it makes you travel and change system, I really like it.
---
In goons... Uses the word "Thanny".. reeeeeeeeeee. You gonna tell him would get those dank iskies for his toonies to get the plexy? How about some of that pubbie o7 o/

My bad, thought the term for new players but plex was whales

---
Ah, okay, my bad. Then I'd just say "meta modules".
---
I am very new, what is the Imperium?
---
a t2 heavy citadel neut has the same neuting power as approximately 5 vanilla normal t2 heavy neuts
---
with subcap gun the athanor does about the same dps as a t1 rev with 2 heatsinks and medium range ammo
---
nope there is not.
---
live migration can be done in a small enough interval, assuming enough bandwidth. We made tests 10 years ago, working on gaming servers and gaming clients (with remote desktop on local network), and moving them all from one server to another, and there was no lag, no packet loss.
---
Of course that's assuming you have an admin network with correct bandwidth.
---
Active belts on the anom list would be a GAME CHANGER.... haven't heard this suggested before, but I like it a lot.
---
Generally support the other things as well.
---
To be clear - these rooms are always survivable, sometimes you need to skip the loot and just nope on out right away, but you can always choose to keep your ship/pod.
---
This room has been used twice now by CCP to show us what is coming, the first time they build the World Ark inside it, and now they are building the new dreadnoughts. The gate, which you will note if you listen to the audio, unlocks immediately upon spawn-in, and the entire site consists of this single room. If you are able to clear *enough* of the room to make it safe enough to crack open and snag the loot can, then go for it and get out. Otherwise, just leave right away.
---
Oops I think we over farmed them for content hehe
---
hey judy did u get ur undies yet
---
Active mining is total turbocancer for any alliance that wants to do literally anything besides mine, and this is coming from both a person and an alliance that enjoys doing so and *still* hates active moon mining.
---
It's... different.   
---
The original was a good old-fashioned 80's synth-rock song with awesome energy that still absolutely rocks.

This one feels more like a dark, veiled threat. It's got an interesting energy of it's own, that's for sure. lol
---
GUH

Yeah gilas are pretty decent at 100mn fleets so I'm sure that translates to abyssals.

10 kikimora on the other hand …

its legacy code, part of it has to do with how there database server is setup ans configured, it needs the downtime to function correctly.  imho ccp should have been working on an eve 2, in the form of a full rewrite, ages ago.  but thats also because eve cant use multicore hardware efficiently
---
bad bot

Don't even need ISboxer - Just align the windows (cancer) when you set up and hope for no DCs. (30 multiboxer btw)

only for R64. other than that, the value is in the other ores, that are as good as you can find in anoms in null.
---
Rorqs are a problem because of what they enable, their local tank is just part of it. The entire platform needs a rework.
---
I multibox 30 when I gank or when I want to do whatever. It's my hobby / money so why shouldn't I be allowed to ?

No, 90% of the PvE-Autism needed for this are already piled up in Imperium or Legacy space ... no chance to catch up for anybody except someone plays karttoon/Haargoth Agamar inside the Megacoalitions ...

Woa thx for a most elaborate response! I just read  [https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/universal-time](https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/universal-time)  more questions I have! 
---
So what i have so far
---
* Time parity &gt;&gt; 1:1 -- Good ! dealing with exponential is hard...and TIDI!
---
* Years &gt;&gt; \[ 2019 = YC121 \] -- so just add or substract to that ie 1976 = YC78.......cool
---
* Time &gt;&gt; UTC = NEST|EST -- So 14:00 UTC is just 14:00 EST
---
* Months numbres? 1,2,3,4 --  Do we keep  **Gregorian calendar** months names or just numbers?
---
* Days 365....just numbers then...
---
So &gt;&gt; Day: 2019.11.01 + Time: 14:00:01 UTC ==  Day: YC121.11.01 + Time: 14:00:01 NEST ?

For a while the game client actually had the Jovian ship models like the Eidolon, etc.  On very, very, very, very rare occasions, devs would show up in one and pew pew. They've since removed these Jovian ship models from the game client.
---
&gt; pvp alliances forming there
---
Rote Kapelle, Unspoken .... forming?
---
Rote was on this server earlier than most of current Tapirium linemembers have grown their 1st pubic hair ...
---
I was just correcting your statement that gilas cant pvp, which was patently false.
---
soon........
---
&gt; CCP could literally have tried each of those things, one after the other, and left it for 6-9 months to see how it worked, and we'd still have time left.
---
In hindsight, that would have been a more interesting "age of chaos."
---
Right, but I think that resource depletion will just result in loose agreements between what is effectively an alliance from the northwest to the southeast
---
How rude of you to declare my alliance a imperium PET
---
Legacy space*
---
Wont work. You can shoot your own structure to trigger the guns to online.
---
Those 5-10% were the leaders of all the alliances. Those leaders either persuaded/enabled their memebrs to rat and pay taxes, rented out swathes of space to whomever(bots?), quit or joined a blob, lost interest and then quit.
---
My point is the wealth is still up there at the top paying for SRP and sov bills, except now if none of your memebrs want to rat or mine because they are rich(or not braindead), you can't afford anything.
---
Because of input broadcasting ban I guess.
---
The wealth was behind a gatekeeper system. Not everyone is content to blow a dude and keep his ego stoked to get srp in that system.

Oh shut up will you?  Structures in this game are insanely oppressive for anyone who is roaming in something smaller than a 50 man t3/guardian blob.  You'd know this if you've ever fucking undocked.

You only need a spaceship to travel and change system.
---
Haha and march into the Pitts of hell we shall go ;-)
---
the person in the third frame is supposed to be the heron, the astero is the one surprised the heron is approaching him.
---
Yeah, tried that already, doesn't work either.
---
Now if only someone would fight....
---
A POS wasn’t on grid, you could set up a stop bubble. 
---
(Harder in null sec b/c you dudes have local but still doable)
---
I really like this song version, i heard it live at Vegas and thought it  was both very haunting and a beautiful rendition at the same time
---
I did. But most of the Corp had disbanded when I returned. I keep in contact with a couple of them
---
&gt;  Source : I scanned a lot of moons.
---
You also have to justify the cost of setting up an athanor, fitting it, fueling it, and then actually mining enough out of each pop to make back your investment.
---
I heard it was something to do with that. The Corp was created a long time before I joined.
---
That's how stupid people are, thinking something is OP when it was no different before that thing.
---
lol what type of Guerrilla warfare you going to wage against goons? Cloaky camp all their systems? I guarantee you they won't give a rats ass. Sure you'll stop the myrms that rat, but not the supers or the rorquals, and you can't do anything against those because whatever you drop on them you will get counter dropped. And if you manage to occasionally poach a few rorq, super kills here and there, they will have those replaced in minutes.
---
Only way goons are going to die now is from in-fighting or if by some miracle all of EVE (Legacy Co included) somehow decided to unite against them and kick them out of Delve, and even then it's a pretty even fight. So hope for some in-fighting.
---
Activating cloak should have an activation cost for capacitor and have it Idk 30 second cycle time or 1 min. Obviously you'll run out of cap eventually. Activation cost can be steep. 10% or 20% cap
---
But. Also turning on cloak removes you from everyone else local AND you lose all local for yourself.
---
All of these things involve recruiting masses of people to tax who take part in production, industry and ratting. You then need to be placating those masses so they don't leave, which in turn requires stability and diplomacy so they can do those activities without unacceptable losses. And of course the most obvious and effective way of doing that is by holding space long-term with a super-capital umbrella in a coalition. Hence the current sovereignity map and state of the game. 
---
The only way to run an alliance now effectively is through taxing bottom up income, or by all members providing for themselves. Which definitely shapes what kind of alliances can exist in the game. 
---
You don't see nearly as many Nomadic alliances or 'Dictator' style alliances which are formed around a few personalities as much anymore because of the moon mining changes and those alliances by very definition were counters to the status quo and thus enemies of stagnation. You essentially cannot survive just by fighting anymore which was possible with passive moon mining.
---
Most modern PVP groups exist through members providing their own wealth through being Veterans (i.e. Wormhole Raiders, V0lta) or by having the PVP group be a SIG of a larger PVE focused alliance with space and a capital umbrella like Goons/Horde etc.
---
Lmao
---
It's kind of a mind-blowing thing but it's not an illusion. Relativity means that there is no correct view of the universe, each observer can see something different and be correct.
---
For example, It's not possible to say that two independent events occurred at the same time. Different observers can see different things with both sides being correct.

I am trying to adapt to r/eve. Thank you for appreciating this. ;)

Nah, srsly, making the hunters more invisible wouldnt fix anything. It would make dudes feel even more like useless clay-pidgeons which is a feel I think not many folks d like having in a game. I guess the train of thoughts another guy had a few days ago about "make PvP-fits valid tools for ratting" d be more on point. I assume( from my own point of view, I might be wrong ofc) that many even pure PvE-dudes would even be OK with stuff like restricted or delayed local if they had at least some valid chance of fighting back ongrid if they get tackled. Lets be honest: Most ratting-ships have a single valid reaction when getting attacked: GTFO, if you cant get out before getting tackled and do not manage to kill or EC-300 the initial tackle really quick you re dead anyways. And yeah, thats meh. For the PvErs its meh cause of said "I m just a target on a shooting-range-feel", for the PvPers its meh cause most targets just dont put themselves on the shootingrange if they have a brain or are pretty unsatisfying opponents in an actual fight.

---
Or you know, renters. People to do the PvE for you while you guarantee their relative safety. PL and NC. have had renters for 8 years now.
---
wow I leave for a few hours and people have a meltdown over this in the comments below
---
FWIW there’s a solution to big coalitions but nobody would like it. Cap alliances at a maximum of 3 members and corporations at a max of 150. These megacorps like TEST and Horde and goonswarm are the problem. 
---
Coalitions would have to have many more smaller groups instead of two or three big ones. They would naturally splinter because too many corp leaders.
---
But this will never happen.
---
Okay bring one into an abyssal site and tell me how that goes mr 100mn fleet man
---
Are you just too scared to fly real ships or smth?
---
You can't stop human nature and the propensity to gather together for protection. It's been going on since the dawn of time. You're either flat out trolling or not a student of history. I bet both.

I wouldn't exactly call them active defense pacts, but moreso just that most groups hate nullblocs more than they hate each other, so if a nullbloc tries to come and ruin things they may find themselves getting ganged up on. Pretty much everyone in the area has 1 or 2 blues tops.
---
Near2 reads chat channels, specifically looking for system names then responding.. To get rid of it means to get rid of chat.
---
But then Intel channels move to external programs like discord.
---
Your just going to have to get over Near2. Discord can be set up to do the same job. Intel channels will exist.
---
Possible outcome no matter what CCP does, the only solution to that problem would be for the leaders of both alliances to stop beheaving like real life politicians and remember this is a game where you should be trying to kill other player groups.
---
Response: Null
---
won't be long before winterco aren't on there anymore amirite
---
That and PL was about the biggest tryhard alliance in the game with a green killboard mentality and a boner for farming newbie and lesser alliances. But eventually those newbies and the ones bullied by PL and co banded together to form a massive coalition and it was game over for PL's farming. And soon after one by one the corporations in PL left.
---
That would be the preferable outcome but I doubt it will happen just because these leaders have sank so much effort and time into it they don’t want to just watch it all helplessly burn as the goon titan fleet glasses their region
---
ok dude
---
I think they should have gone for a 15 second delay. It would have shifted some window of opportunity to attackers but wouldnt make PVE´ers sitting ducks. (Even the fastest travelceptor takes 20+ seconds to land on a grid and be able to lock).
---
&gt;by leaving a few rocks to keep the belt alive
---
Can the process be restarted if rocks are still up?
---
Hm, now whose fault was that? :thinking:
---
Except you don't look at the value when expecting a ship to kill another one. If we follow such a shitty reasoning, how about the fact that 10 cruisers worth 200 mill each can kill a 150b worth AT ship ?
---
See what I mean ?
---
&gt;going to take some of the Immensea
---
That's going to be funny to watch W4RP try to do something to protect their space
---
The only TAPI in Tribute are some SPVG morons that gatecamp because they ran out of content elsewhere.
---
One is trying to keep the game where it should be: with stuff dying. And the other is ruining the game with it's ore yield. My heart bleeds for your awful cancerous rorqual.
---
&gt; But then Intel channels move to external programs like discord.
---
Fine with me. I don't mind people reporting hostiles they see on grid, I just don't want the perfect intel we currently have. 
---
And as long as we have to "just get over" Near2 you cowards have to just get over cloaky campers.
---
AT ships are not valued fairly. They are given an artificial value to reflect their rarity because the only way to establish a proper value would be to have lots of them traded on an open market. Which you can't do with AT ships because there's only a handful of each kind.
---
Yeah that bug drives me nuts, because when you get it as the gunner, you can't use fighters properly and only a relog fixes it.
---
Twinks before leather night.
---
Why do you come across as such a buttmad little boy every time you post
---
Why do you show up to every vindi thread? Hard on much?
---
Think of it this way: It will help the economy by inflating fuel
---
&gt;This is like saying, lets install VMWare on a supercompute cluster.
---
There are two reasons why that's not implemented : the GPU usage is difficult to virtualize while being needed in many supercomputer, and the virtualization is cpu intensive on OS-agnostic hypervisors, therefore defeats the goal of CPU-intensive structures.  
---
Plus, there is no use in virtualization in those systems : the job is started, then stopped. no point in aggregating the virtual nodes on one physical node.  
---
So far the only use of virtualization in CPU-intensive applications that I heard of, is the ability to snapshot the VMs, or duplicate them, but most of the cases the applications run in the VMs have their own snapshot and duplication process. 
---
Plus, virtualization is a threat for the security of the data hold in the vms. Though they are supposed to be oblivious of the hypervisor,  you can not be sure there is no malicious software that allows a VM to access the data of another one.  
---
The network is however definitely not an issue.
---
Live migration consists (basically) in copying the memory pages of the VM (those that are updated are marked as dirty) to the future host, then when the remaining memory is small enough, pausing the VM for a very small amount of time, just to copy the remaining dirty pages, and move the processor state from the current host to the migrated one. The route are also updated, though the previous host can keep forwarding the data to the new host( that requires a virtual bridge).
---
Shadow mirror (so everlasting migrations) are only useful to prevent shutdown of the VM : if the original VM fails to transmit data to the hypervisor of the copy VM, this hypervisor makes the migration complete (it starts the vm at the last known state and change the network to be the one receiving the data from the VM). This however can lead to a loss of data.
---
You have a very shitty memory, the playerbase told ccp the excavators were op when announced. They hit  the test server and the playerbase told ccp excavators were still op. So ccp made them live, then a few months later were "oh these are op", and then made roid models bigger.
---
Yeah i'm pretty hard right now, gonna be kinda awkward when i go to the bathhouse with my bros tonight
---
I've never been able to duplicate how to trigger the issue - for me it happens about 20-30% of the time after my JFs have taken some gates or used at least one other cyno, before jumping to a cyno a on a citadel. Upon taking control of the citadel, the HUD "bugs out" and the separate fighter window, normally located right above my HUD, appears with 75% of it obscured from view and no way to move it.  It leaves you unable to use the fighters, and if you release control and undock, you have no HUD but still have the hidden fighter controls. Relogging is the only way I've found to fix it, but I've also never tried to take a gate with a JF char who was bugged out like that, fearing the worst.
---
Sounds hot
---
Bathhouses are supposed to be, yeah
---
Well that was random.
---
I see the idea of what youre getting at here; making certain anoms into sites with a gate would alleviate some problems,  however it opens plenty of new ones.
---
 Firstly you just made it even easier for a pve fleet to escape capture since the hunters now have to find which site theyre in, warp to it, activAte the gate, and then  actually burn to and catch their target which will NEVER sit next to the warp in spot, making them even more safe than they are now. Tackle rats wont fix it, they will simply be shot first; not to mention youre just offloading the work of the defending the ratters to NPCs which is an awful idea.
---
Secondly, having anoms locked behind gates extremely restricts the hunters ability to plan and execute their strike. You can no longer come in from any angle, you MUST use the activation gate, making it extraordinarily easy to be scouted and have your target warp off since they have an even greater window of time to react, which solves nothing and puts us back at square one.
---
Third, if you somehow DO manage to tackle something and get in your fleet thru the gate and onto grid, is is now EXTREMELY hard to save whoever is tackled as now the hunters can bubble fuck the 1 spot that the defenders will come to, and since its in a site there are no cynos, which goes against your main point.
---
Lasty, having NPC rats protect your ratters by shooting the hunters is dumb.  That is the responsibility of the people ratting, not NPCs.
---
[removed]
---
It's invalid, has been addressed, and protects "zero risk" for griefers.
---
So zero risk for gankers, massive risk for everyone else. How is this balanced?
---
&gt; and can **BOMB OFF BUBBLES** that're tackling mining ships/rorqs 
---
Bring a HIC?
---
Rg , cir good times.
---
It isn't always about killing the rorq, often you are just trying to provoke a fight by tackling it. Can't really do that if the structure itself forces you off the grid.
---
thats what a lot of these ballance discussions miss, nobody is ever going to be flying free killmails for roamers in the numbers they want, ever.
---
If you think EVE players are somehow intelligent, or at least "more intelligent" than lmao.
---
&gt;as, say, goons and init are
---
So... the same gotcha
---
And you were so proud of yourself you screenshotted it and came here to post it for reddit points. Yikes.
---
You can avoid gate camp by scouting. You can avoid abyssal gank by doing it in good system. You can avoid blobs by having intel and no taking fights that will escalate into Titans. So many possibilities ... its just not for free and without some work.
---
Is there a way to store assembled ships so that they can be audited? We have ships disappear from time to time and need to figure out where they go. I know that can happen with repacked ships, but what about assembled ones? Don't want to have to rip off higgs rigs every time we need to roll a hole.
---
What is the CFC?
---
ClusterFuck Coalition. What the imperium was before it is what it is.
---
Legit read your comment as "That's new, whats the imperium". Don't mind me man.
---
Here is my problem. You could have actually explained why the proposed change is bad:  
---
-game mechanics to help with his issue are already in place (combat probes)  
---
-it could make ninja mining in highsec too easy via the agency
---
Instead you built up a strawman that did jackshit, and didn't properly explain why you think that it makes hunting too easy.  
---
The way you responded invalidates your point ontop of being a  disingenous way of arguing.
---
Rorqs are overall well balanced now. The real issue is the lack of reasons to fight massive wars in the game currently, leading to stockpiles of capitals. If capitals were blowing up, people wouldn't be complaining. Complaining about Rorquals is as stupid as complaining about trees spreading a wildfire, it's not the cause.
---
About excavators, i'm curious what it would look like if the Rorquals were actually mining with massive lasers, would be cool I think, but then you'd have all the sperges crying about the fact that they can't have easy 500 mill kills anymore or excavators to boosh.
---
All in all, people don't have a clue why they are crying about, they just do it for fun.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
By not allowing more than 50% of racial moon types to be concentrated in the appropriate nullsec regions.
---
It's always funny to read about people shitting on Rorquals because they can't kill them with 10 destroyers. It's a fucking CAPITAL ship, nerd, not some random battleship. God bless you can't just come in there with 10 shitty 5 mill trashers or catalysts and take a Rorqual down.
---
The issue is not the umbrella. Let's admit that tomorrow CCP changes Capitals so that they are ineffective against subs (no HAWs, not enough tracking for fighters to track subs), big alliances would just bridge in fleets of subscapitals and the result would be the same.
---
The issue here is not people protecting their Rorquals, it's people expecting to kill Rorquals without any resistance nice and easy.
---
drop drone capacity substantially and add "mining fighters" that replace excavs? Interesting idea actually
---
