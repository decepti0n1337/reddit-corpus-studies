I’ll give that but I’d counter with the fact that most of these guys spend their null wars shooting structures this one is no different
---
---
---
Its to expensive to be worth at that price I guess.
---

---
You would buy higher mats than the finished product is worth selling.
---
How is pointing out facts whining?
---
Humility is a trait that is woefully lacking in many gamers - EVE or other - and is a welcome change. I laugh at the goofy shit I do way more than the goofy shit I THINK others have done. I've never had a cap ship, so I can't speak to the specific loss, but losses are all relative. Losing a blingy PvE ship can be just as devastating to a player who only uses one account/character.
---
If a good time was had by all, then isn't that the reason we play this game?
---
Um gtfo?
---
Is probably close
---
No, they are related.
---
&gt;  Because Nullsec gets butthurt 
---
This seems ironic
---
The slightest inconvenience ever sent you to the forums posting. You had to undock? This is parody yes?
---
I think it was the high sec pubies making horseshit comments about drifters that caused mittens to go apeshit and shit on high sec.  but you guys carry on.  Definitely keep it up it’s going so well
---
It’s the time investment and permanent loss of eve.  Some individuals and groups have spent 1000s off hours or more building what they have
---
and... mechanics GREATLY favor grief style play vs traditional warfare
---
“short”
---
&gt; Is this the wrong game for me?
---
It's the wrong game for everyone.
---
Horde doesn't allow racism, homophobia, or anime. So at least there is one nullsec alliance like that.
---
CC companies would have major issues if you were using a card number as a form of identification.  They could end up with fines or being disabled from the credit processing network.
---
so are you :p *wink*
---
Do not worry yourself we'll make plenty of isk without selling it to highsec, benefits to having the 2nd largest trade hub in the game out in delve
---
Meh, it's pretty different IMO.  Sure, plenty of battles in null revolve around structure timers, but these engagements can generally *possibly* go either way depending on batfones.
---
This force was not contestable, as it was comprised of the two largest groups in the game joining hands to curb stomp someone they outnumber by orders of magnitude.  There's a lot of smug in this comment thread, but when your PIBC-like coalition tanks the server population on tranquility as happened on serenity, the players that will be the most adversely affected will be the ones still playing the game.  That will be you.
---
Do you not look at MER's? Yes goons exported that much
---
But are you gay for jay?
---
I get that. But, in the end, it's a game. Nobody actually died. We're all just sitting in front of a computer playing with spreadsheets in simulated space.
---
If the simulator was correct 550 DPS drones+guns.
---
Nobody wants to see their effort transform into dust
---
Dude Volta comes out to 0.0 and kills a fax on a Rorqual tackle and they smug the fuck out of local.  Fuck.  Them.   All.   Like this shit matters.  We wipe their asses here and everywhere yet here they are attention whoring and looking for some “David vs goalith” recruiting posts.  Gimme a break.
---
And Stargates, make WHs dangerous again
---
People are downvoting just because he mentioned KMs. Maybe he is just trying to say he got 17 straight kills with the vexor hull
---
Lmao what. All kinds of services only allow one use of a particular discount per CC.
---
Okay so if someone came to your house and burned your expensive (insert hobby here) collection it's no big deal it was just a game and no one got hurt. Items in eve have value, time to create, and time is money.

Eh, make name changes like Steam or Discord,

In the nearly 14 years of being associated with EVE, I have never bought ISK / sold PLEX for ISK. I don't think that people who do are "bad", per se, but I made a decision early on not to do it and I believe my experience - for me - has been all the more authentic because of it. Truth be told, I have struggled often making enough ISK to survive in a large alliance, but I'm playing my game the way I decided to play it and am happier for it. I think that is why I get so frustrated to see anyone claim "that's what EVE is all about!" when talking about several subjects live non-consensual PVP, multiboxing, PLEXing, etc. I feel like as soon as someone says "X is what EVE is all about", it discourages a certain group of folks who play the game their way and ultimately discourages more players in the long run.
---
The major null alliances have a shared interest in shutting down competitors to the Tranquility Trading Tower. The picture posted above is of the aforementioned operating in a mafia-like fashion with ruthless efficiency.
---
no fake, I was there
---
Thing is, NS doesnt really need HS. Or rather HS cant stop selling to NS, but if NS gets their own markets up and running it will really mess up everyone non NS.
---
Better analogy:
---
You play the lottery. You buy tickets each week. It costs time and money. In the end, you still never win. The fun is in the experience.
---
There's still room for fairly pyrrhic victories, like last summer when Legacy dumpstered 700bil in dreads and a keepstar. Maybe not as extremely damaging as you would prefer, but it was still very costly and painful.
---
The issue is that those kinds of fights require commitment, and it's difficult to force an enemy to commit in this game.
---
He's very wrong. I'd bet the farm that they wanted the rewards of null with little to no risk at all. That's not what this game is about. Many of my alliance members haven't changed anything and continue to grind the null PvE.... the difference now is that they pay attention and accept the risk. Losing a ship once is just the cost of making 10x what the ship is worth.
---
Thing is, everything has a price here. And since Plex has price in real money, gaining in game currency is something more akin to a job. People put thousands of hours into into it. Nobody wants to lose it because of misplacing trust and such. And since espionage is very common in Eve, people are often very cautious about giving anyone any roles/rights/access.
---
No thats saving you account info, you are not actually logged in. When you hit that little play thingy, thats when you login. And you have to do that in order to get your "daily login" things. 
---
Its not that hard dude. Just accept it, breathe and let it go.
---
Nope.  What a maroon some people are on this.
---
It's not like most MMORPG where if you get wiped in a raid or a dungeon you don't lose anything. In EVE, if you take a fleet out and get wiped, you lose your ship and everything on it permanently and have to buy everything all over again.
---
This brings a more serious attitude to the game, but there is definitely plenty of room for chill and relaxed gameplay too.
---
You just need to git gud
---
Just use a fresh alpha account without any card info associated with it.
---
This is either low-effort cringey copy-pasta, or an unironically delusional post contending that volta are somehow real bullies here.  Regardless, its time for you to stop posting and go outside.
---
No its not dude. People keep saying this but look at the newborn chart. Read the testimonies from HS who says that a lot of new gila accounts have been made. I promise you that the bot count hasnt gone down, if anything its gone up. 
---
People running bots wont stop, ever. 
---
And the bot-aspirants, I mean no. Some like PvE, let them. Not your call.
---
After 14 years of playing one game, its the one game I take serious over any other.  Others are fun, Eve is time wasted fun
---
I personally think you have the right mindset. EVE is much more fun when you don’t take it too seriously and focus on enjoying yourself no matter what happens. 
---
Some feel differently, however. For some, the fun is in taking the game seriously and building something that is real for them. 
---
Neither is right and neither is wrong. One day EVE will go offline for good and everyone will have lost everything that worked hard for. As long as you can have fun between then and now, that’s what matters.
---
&gt; we think it's BS that groups like goons have actively worked so hard to remove content from nullsec
---
Somebody might wanna remind this guy that just 'cause he doesn't hear about it on r/Eve doesn't mean it didn't happen.
---
Theres no winning. Either all the xtra accounts are bots or bot-aspirants. I know some that havent even logged in since the event but people refuse to accept that no local went too far.
---
Isn't the first rule to not fly what you can't afford? I get that re-purchasing equipment can be annoying. It's the same in a MMO (to a much lesser extent sure) having to repurchase consumables and other items.
---
But it's still just a game where nothing is permanent.
---
Have you ever played Everquest?
---
Nope. I played WoW, Earth and Beyond, and a few text based games. The closest I ever played to Eve was a text browser game called Space Merchant.
---
What implants? Asklepians?
---
If you want to play in any other way than solo, you have to be prepared that any corp worth their salt will give you a very thorough screening before accepting you as a member.
---
Or you could go somewhere where they don't require any of that. Brave Collective and Pandemic Horde have very lax requirements. Quoting their requirements page: "The only requirements for joining Brave Newbies Inc. are owning a computer and having a pulse".
---
Hit up our public discord or chat channel in game.
---
&gt;Anti- capital battleships etc should exist (think stuff like the leshak  and it's insane spooled up DPS), but making capitals useless is not the  answer.
---
  
---
I like this idea. Make something like the battlecruisers that fit battleship guns, only it's battleships that fit cap guns.
---
Yep. The mechanics that were supposed to keep ls a bit "safer" like hs.... Gate guns, sec status effects... Really make it at least as dangerous for new players as ns or jspace.
---
The vet knows how to take advantage of these things, or otherwise cope with their effects, while the new player will get killed by gate guns without knowing why and will be chased by faction police or other players when he returns to hs, etc.
---
Ls mechanics aren't really harder to learn than any others, but ls groups tend to be smaller and less hand-holdy. No mentor programs, deviated help channels, new player guides and FAQs on an alliance wiki, fewer players online to try to get help from at any given time... than you'd have in ns or possibly wh groups.
---
Meanwhile bit null groups have lots of safe space and jspace has hole control to go at least a little ways to helping a new player make more than he loses.
---
The fix for ECM. Remove all the modules make 1 module it's now scripted, racial scripts but you can target the jammer, rainbow script but you can target the jammer, burst script and a very weak script that you can't jam the jammer (widow has this bonused). On top of that weapon disruptors are now a single module with anti missile, turret and drone (like a burst jammer but stops the drones in their tracks, like an emp scrambles the drones, they have to be ordered to attack again) script
---
Let's just ignore that as stands caps can be said to serve very little purpose that is meaningfully unique in an EVE with damage caps on structures, beyond being the cognitively and organisationally cheapest ship to deploy to a contested grid in defence, shutting down pvp content in a reductive way, or shooting each other in massive blobs. Let us ignore that they weren't designed for deployment in the numbers now available to large blocs, and even within the capital hull classes themselves there are major issues with redundancy. Let's ignore that a carrier is already just a worse, cheaper super in almost all potential combat situations.
---
Let's just come back to your disagreement on whether a capital ship should require support to field, based on, well, really nothing particularly substantiated other than a strawman fueled by a lack of imagination, that conveniently sidesteps unique gameplay only available to carriers and supers.
---
If my enemy has more caps, I should leave my caps at home? Or I could use combined arms and thoughtful positioning to try and redress the numerical superiority in a guerilla-style engagement pattern? 
---
A battleship needs other ships to be effective in most configurations outside brawling. Ships that fulfil any specific combat role tend to require other ships to work with, it's how the game is balanced, so you don't end up with something all-singing and all-dancing. The question that is far more salient than the one you ask with current EVE gameplay is 'why would I ever not bring a capital?'
---
It’s honestly neither.   It’s just I’m calling you and Volta out for their shit posting you all seem to think is a monopoly of big blue.  This post and all of Volta’s shit lately reminds me of anything the null blocks would put up.  Bunch of hypocrites.  Want to sit on this throne of superiority and play victim to “big blue” like some poor defenseless high sec pubie being ganged in Uedeama.
---
Just poking the bear slightly, I tried joining BNI. After waiting for nearly 2 weeks, I sent them a message and a request to join. The only response was that they had too deep of a backlog and would get back to me soon.
---
&gt;**Like there is no way CCP can get any real numbers from the blackout tests**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What i am missing here.
---
They got their real numbers on the first 4 days of blackout.
---
Then they shoved out a very quick-to-implement login reward program....that front-loaded the rewards instead of back-loading the rewards.
---
This *kinda* indicates just how good those numbers were......but that's not what r/Eve wants.
---
k
---
Trust yer gut kid there’s nothin here of value.
---
There is a good reason most of us call the lotto a stupid tax.
---
What if you lost so much money buying tickets that you couldn't afford to play the lottery any more? Now you don't get to have any more fun until your next paycheck. That's what people are trying to avoid. You have to match your losses to your income so you don't run out of money and can afford to keep having fun. There are plenty of people that fly ships that they don't care about losing. Those just won't be very expensive because most people don't have the income to be losing 10 bil ships multiple times per week.
---
Thats an interesting suggestion. It would certainly take the fun out of it for many thereby lowering "content". Which never really was content, I mean for me personally thats the most boring type of "PvP". Its basically just shooting another NPC.
---
But for many it seems to be the only valid type of "PvP". I mean fine, if thats your playstyle but it will most def hinder alot of people to join and to leave.
---
&gt;You don't need to log in to claim your reward, only open the client
---
Pssst.....guess what happens when you "open the client".
---
&gt; Are you really that retarded? 
---
.....
---
That just makes him a derp really.
---
Daaaamn those some gnarly reps then. Thanks!
---
Some quality quotes in here. My favorites:
---
&gt; And lots of them stay in hisec while they finish career agents and soe arc and then just stay there because the first time they venture out of hisec they are killed by a gatecamp or someone who scans their escalation **and just like an animal with electric fence they learn** that everything below 0.5 means loss of ship.
---
&gt; Nothing to worry about because of standing fleet and intel **and written instructions on how to chew your food.** Risk is low, reward is high.
---
&gt; And even if you drop militia, you probably have such bad standings with oppoting factions afterwards that **you can not visit their hisec without facpo getting a rageboner.**
---
&gt; **Lowsec** is more than ok for seasoned players who don't like null gameplay because you know what you are doing, know why and know how to. Risk - very little, reward - not null, but **it's honest work.**
---
Yea that's honestly the way to look at the game,  
---
the game would be a lot better if more had that attitude, rather than bluing everyone in the game, and complaining when they die or when things don't go there way (eg a lot of miners/ratters during blackout)
---
Done
---
Competition?
---
Who you gonna find on your null roams if 5 players (15-20 accounts) are gone?
---
It's insane that it's easier to change your name IN REAL LIFE than it is to do so in a video game.
---
Blah blah history but you can already inject alts. Just make a "name history" tab in the bio and make searches and links to the old name link to the new name.
---
Haha i was sure i will get many questions. this fit is quite unorthodox and until i have putted it on paper it didn't seem as complicated
---
I am looking at 229 dps and 212. The lower dps fit is a vastly faster ship. look at the power grid the microwarpdrive consumes. It's a battleship module in a battlecruiser ship, I tough it was fun :D. the higher dps, older build is cheaper but some npc will catch you and damage you requiring to warp out and abandon drones. I recommend the slower one
---
You can outrange anything that is under 205km at least that's what i can get with the fit, which i have marked with green. Make sure you invest in drone avionics and advanced drone avionics V skills to get the range increased. The orange once are also doable according to another website but I haven't checked ingame. [170km](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=30193) vs [255km](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Sleeper_Information_Sanctum) for an example on Sleepless Upholder
---
The game is to keep moving and maintain rage because they chase you, right click -&gt; keep at range. Only stop to drop the mobile depot for 60sec and load in drones or warp away and load drones and reposition. but generally that will be the first step before engaging.
---
Well, you will refit switching the probe launcher to a drone link augmentor anyway. I stay in the wormhole c5 or c6 for the gas spawn (I find them rare and annoying to search for again and again) so i need more drones and a venture that's why i go in with 6x cargo hold optimizers (~3900m3 cargo). then refit and drop all of them in a mobile depot. If I stay and log off in a wh, the exit will close and i will need to find another. Some will be exits to null and low and I will not go around to buy another venture, sometimes far away, that's why I carry my own. I dock my gnosis in a structure at the exit and switch to venture. I wish the depots could change ships
---
The 500mn fit only has a 190km range. I use it for the gas sites.

Don’t disagree he’s not my king.  Just clearing up a bit of confusion there for ya.

Goons shit on high sec even without a “good reason” thru their code alts and hell not even that... they just jc to uedeama and shit on 1 month old players in t1 industrials “for the lolz”.  Fucking hate all they stand for if you wanna know the truth.  I honestly can’t for the life of me figure out how all the rest of new eden has allowed this to happen.

Lol this might not be the game for you. Post your lossmail btw

Haha guaranteed downvotes from NPCs
---
TL;dr - sick of ratting,  tried gas mining,  2 holes inhabited,  first hole scammed him n blew up his shit, hes all good about it though
---
Huh. Not sure about Vily himself, I don't know him very well. He got promoted above a lot of people and is, frankly, a bit distant from the older crowd. Nice guy tho. I'll ask him.
---
I'll say this - this isn't about that kind of attitude. I wasn't in the military myself but I was a civvie adjutant to 3 of em now. The nice ones don't act like that. :)
---
No one complained when all the big blocs united to give goons a kick up the ass
---
Do you?
---
&gt; It's not hard to understand, CCP made this with this nonsense blackout.
---
  Wow. You're actually blaming the blackout for Highsec markets?
---
The funny part is, more people would do the PvP if it consistently spawned. If it did, newer players would try and sneak the look in cheap ships because the ticks are pretty great, and then you'd have people hunting those cheap ships, all the way up to the big fish that do it in prime time.
---
In the current setup either you get the gate and expect a big money fight, or you get no fight at all.
---
Because for some this game is their life. their social interactions, their greatest victories and most bitter defeats, their highest reaches, their character, who they are, it´s defined through the game. To them it´s not a game you can come back to, kick back and relax while playing, to them it is their life. You´ll read things like: Imagine if someone comes to you and burns your hobby collection. But is it really a hobby to you, angered reader and most likely bittervet? Or is it possibly so much more? Maybe an addiction but everyone is addicted to something.
---
So u recommend the fit with less PG used? (No MWD)
---
Btw wiki says alphas cannot skill Advanced Drone Avionics...
---
So for the spreadsheet, ifs its green its doable?
---
So the idea is to stay out of their range using keep at range and let drones do all the dps (Like kiting).
---
So when too many drones have died, do u drop the depot while at 200km from the sleepers, or do u warp away first?
---
Cause depots take ages to deploy wouldnt the sleepers catch up to you in that time?
---
^Following on this, the idea of the depot is to allow u to put more drones into ur bay, do u drop it as soon as a drone has died, or do u wait for like 3 of them to died first?
---
Hm so u can put stuff into the depot? Ive never tried that before lol. Or do u just jettison it next to the depot
---
Is there any chance u have a video (or could record one please :D) or you doing this? Im just wondering about the actual clearing of the site (like how do u refit drones without sleepers catching up to u and how can u keep ur drones alive (and urself do sleepers insta-pop you if they get close?), stuff like that)
---
Thanks for answering, sorry for the questions :D
---
This is good and all, but there's a distinct lack of conversation surrounding how good the celestis is in blackout non blackops roams
---
It amuses me greatly that as a general rule people don't complain about weapon disruptors or sensor damps. They do the exact same thing ECM does (make it so you can not effectively apply your modules), and could probably be argued to do it better than ECM. For some reason though ECM is the boogyman mechanic that ruins the game. Come one EVE players, we're supposed to be smarter than that!
---
Uh if your doing things in low or null sec, you can’t really afford to watch videos.. what I usually do is just constantly hit my scan button, and when ever a ship is detected I warp to a pre-determined point in the system that’s nowhere near any objects or planets.
---
Brb joining test.
---
0.5sec is still highsec you have 'relative' safety in those systems or above, low sec/null sec/wh I wouldn't suggest you go out and mine as unless your in a Corp who can protect you, there is little to no safety
---
You can press V on your keyboard to dscan. That will show you what ships are within a range you set on a slider up to 14 AU.  
---
Generally people just don’t mine in dangerous space.
---
I don't think you really get the depth this game has. If you don't think there is a reason to be concerned about spies then you haven't scratched the surface. Yes people get overly worked up about ship losses but if there is an easy way to prevent losses by filtering out shit spies. It would be dumb as fuck to not do that at a minimum. If you want to just sit back and relax just stay a line member and shoot shit. Don't become any part of leadership. Alliances need line members so you have a role to play still. If you don't want to worry about any of that just play Solo or find some highsec Corp that doesn't do esi auth. You are the one choosing to play with groups who care about spies.
---
&gt; I was watching a video while mining
---
What happened to that game you were playing?
---
V0LTA anchored a market azbel in Perimeter to compete with TEST's keepstar because TEST broke their promise to never raise taxes over 0.3% (and also to get some content out of it). They expected to fight TEST, but instead the three current mega-coalitions that run almost all of Nullsec (TEST, PH, Goons) joined forces to kill the azbel. It's just very disturbing to a lot of people to see all three of these teaming up for any reason.
---
Rip Hyde, whats up with chessur atm?
---
The good old skeleton comet. Farm this craphole for hours upon hours for terrible pay or just work 1 hour OT in RL and score an easy 2 bil+
---
Dont get me wrong, Ive done it when I was a three month character, but not for long. Its actually crap. There are so many ways to make billions per week, even in highsec. This is at the bottom. If you think its fun though, enjoy.
---
It's almost like there's a colourblind mode that changes the colour of things for exactly that reason...
---
You have the right attitude. Most of the people who get super salty about losses do not expect to lose their shit, and many of them buy plex to fund skill injectors and jump straight into big/expensive ships they really have no business flying. Of course, the only possible outcome here is dying horribly.
---
Damage type in general. Would be super handy to know which ammo to load at a glance.
---
He went afk as well because of RL stuff
---
Because having to find one word in the attributes page for a ship to make sure you buy the right fuel makes for a better game experience.

---
I may have not been clear. Military people tend to not be easily offended and can take/give some guff. Most will not suffer a bigot or a snowflake easily.
---
Keep your focus on EVE, use D-scan aggressively, keep an eye on local if you're in lowsec, and fit your ship for align time rather than mining rate.
---
Good stuff gents. Definitely worth the listen. Agree fully on the blackout...here's hoping it stays forever and they don't add structures to cancel it. 0.0 is dangerous (ish) like it should be
---
Wasn't a scam dude, gotta read.
---
 I had 1 cycle's worth of gas in my venture, probably worth 3 mil all included. They also "repaid" me from 120M-150M (I forget actual amount). Anyway, that pushed me into Triglavian, WH ratting this weekend, and PVP when someone from my corp has time to help.
---
Why are you booing him?  He’s right.
---
Fewer even bigger groups is what the game needs.
---
Adapt or quit pleb.
---
You mean where everyone is flying perfect setups with the best mods and implants and drugs?
---
I would strongly suggest you not plan this far ahead right away. As a new player, I think you should try out a bunch of different play styles before investing this heavily in mining/PI (two of the most tedious, boring, and low income activities in the game). Could you make 6b a month? Probably, but it would involve a huge amount of time and work and all you'd be doing is plexing the accounts (assuming that's where the 6b figure comes from). Now I'm not entirely shitting on mining/PI, but I'd try other stuff first because you will burn out if that's all you do. You'd also be much better served doing those activities in nullsec, because highsec is absolute garbage in every way. You could then also use a rorqual for boosts, which is far superior to the orca.
---
Fixed
---
Perma?
---
And just think of how many other players benefited from the modules you made or the isk they made from you buying their stuff or reimbursements that your taxes for using the structures ends up covering.
---
The word of a wormhole pilot is very important to them.
---
When the pilot accidentally broke his boss's word, it was a huge taboo.
---
IF I understand wormhole culture that is.
---
All PI will be done in Null so I may still do this somewhat but skill an account into incursions is that a good idea?
---
You cannot hide these though, the ticker will go through these first and then your options.
---
&gt;I was watching a video while mining
---
If you find mining to be boring, then do something else. This is a game, have fun.

I always love seeing old graphics. I remember when graphics like that would strike awe and everyone would talk about how amazing it was much like they do with today’s graphics. If that’s how far we’ve come in that amount of time just imagine what’s in wait for the next 10-15 years.
---
Also I died when he said “That’s what I fucking wanted”
---
Welcome to eve, fly dangerous.
---
&gt;That's a good haul, but Noooo, people say you make to much in null....
---
I have very bad loot from this 50 keys... I made the same number of keys 3 months ago. it was more about half. about 6.5 bil. but I didn't save the statistics
---
He's in NC. he can't even read the word "undock"
---
You say you are "saving for a PvP ship".  You should probably just but some cheap t1 frigates and start from there. Tristans are pretty good and versatile I think. Other people might have some other suggestions.
---
7o! you should come to nullsec, make friends to mine with, learn from people and your own experiences, have loads of fun and be Brave! 
---
We've got plenty of moons and great ratting space and fun pvp along with free skillbooks and ships and skillplans to suit your type of gameplay. There's also no fleet requirements so you can do what you enjoy without any pressure.

I dunno I had to go outside to change my name irl. Took like 30 entire minutes to drive out and get the paperwork to fill out.
---
Boosting cyclone will work fine
---
Post your main
---
Mid-grade Asklepians. I show my pod 19 seconds in. I rolled some of the abyssal mods myself so it's hard to price but I'd put it at about 2b.
---
High Sec is "protected" by Concord. Any crimes (such as shooting another player without provocation) will result in punishment. You can still be shot and killed, but the attacker will also be killed by Concord. Also, Concord will keep record of the attacker's crimes, reducing their Security Status.
---
Low Sec is "observed" by Concord. Crimes will still result in a loss of Security Status, but they will not intervene. Which means peopel can shoot each other all day long.
---
Null Sec is outside Concord's view. Which means a brutal serial killer won't have a record, and their Security Status will remain unchanged.
---
Roughly 295m Isk an hour. Blueprints don’t reflect on Estimated value right? So it will be higher. All in all you will make more isk per hour doing T5’s then one Rorqual can mine on average and Carrier ratting. I think the problem with the ‘make too much in null’ is the fact you can parallel multiple accounts. You can run 10+ Rorquals and miners, you can run multiple VNIs and go afk whereas T5’s you do not have that ability at all.
---
Ok thanks that’s really helpful I appreciate it
---
I was in snuffed out for a while. Some people were moving two supers through Black Rise and were in Reitsato. We had a feeling, back then with slightly shorter jump ranges, that they would try to gate to Rakapas before jumping out.  They did. One cyno'd out fine but one managed to warp off and cloak up because we were not quite ready for them so our tackle was seconds late.
---
We saw where it landed and got people on grid to work on decloaking.  A few minutes later, a Crane appears, the nyx decloaks next to the crane... And nothing happens. Probes land a hit, he gets tackled and dies.
---
He didn't have enough fuel to make it from Rakapas to his cyno, so he warped off. A friend brought him topes with a Crane and put it in his fleet hangar after decloaking and he moved it to the fuel bay...
---
But it was nitro topes.  RIP nyx.
---
Yep.  I'd be totally lost without his thoughtful insight.  He really is a gift to me and all my pubbie friends. Thank Bob he's here to show me the light.
---
It is refreshing to see funny old videos
---
Lemme tell you about my double boson titan haven ratting
---
250-300m ticks baby
---
Because that was 50% of Eve versus 50% of Eve.
---
Play the game, don't take it to seriously. Everything is just pixels on a screen.
---
Killboard doesn't matter bro, fly brave!
---
Putting value on a lottery ticket lol. No one comes along and takes your ticket before you can find out if it won.
---
Not at all, I was just watching Eve beginner guides while mining when I died. I was on a run to Jita and didn't have much items so I thought I'd do some mining on the way so I had something to sell once I got to the main trade hub.
---
Not boo quenrs. Boo urns.
---
Dying in a blaze of glory is better than living on your knees. When TAPI was TEST, they knew this as well.
---
&gt; What happened to that game you were playing?
---
It was running on my main monitor, I was just watching a Eve Beginner tips video :P
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Thanks
---
But a Rorq does something around 100M isk per hour, each VNI will pull in maybe 30M isk per hour, he's on the line of a super ratting in a completely safe environment according to the ones who started the whole blackout debate because they can't kill him while he's in there.   
---
The Nerf for VNI's is already in the cards.
---
Rorq I have no idea if they're touching, but still, the multiple account thing wasn't what I was saying.  
---
Also there are streamers like Lokival_the_nub who multibox T5's so you can't even use that excuse anyway.
---
It wont let me join Eve Uni it always give an error.
---
Appreciate the detailed reply, thanks
---
I was near Jita, about 4 or 5 jumps towards Gallente space so yeah, probably stupid place to mine as there is heaps of people around
---
Wat

we traded gameplay for graphics :)

I get CCP want their persistent universe and your actions to have consequence and whatever

But just add a name history tab like there's a Corp history tab and limit the amount of name changes to like one per year.

You can literally just google P2W instead of citing dumb shit from your head.

oooo , that qwerty remap is a good tip.  thanks.  consider it applied.

C5/C6 are sought after, I highly doubt that you could take one solo.

C3/C4 might be doable though, but logistics would be a PITA if its just you.

I didn't know that I needed this in my life.

Maybe someday! Politics don't seem super interesting atm

bring back torp AOE!

Bull-fucking-shit.

lol

Jam the falcon!
---
Vedmaks in general are not impressive for solo, their tank is middling unless you literally gimp everything else and even then it’s no Deimos, it’s ‘ok’ with mobility and it’s gun, although great for killing big things in gangs is horrible because you will generally die before it ramps up even halfway.

Come join E-Uni in LowSec!  You'll have a blast and meet some people to do whatever you like to do with.  It's not for everyone, but it's been a great way for me to learn the game, go on some big fleets, learn how to make some isk, etc.

People like this are always intentionally vague so that they can push their agenda. They say "ban racism" but define "racism" as anything they don't personally like while allowing actual racism against people they don't like. So if you're opposed to them then they can just claim you're pro-racism when you're not.
---
highsec mining a job? The dudes not injecting a carrier to be 100% focused gameplay 24/7, he's telling a ship to mine those rocks on the side of the battlefields. Plus; he's a programmer and will probably figure out you can do everything worth doing from the overview with a simple script while he goes to script for his actual job, unless he already wrote a script to do his actual job too.
---
“Rorq does something like 100M isk an hour”
---
   You’re wrong there, a Rorqual definitely pulls in more then that just on average. Now once we start talking rare ores it’s a different ball game and again, AFK-able and you are only limited to your PC power and how many alts for mining.
---
“On the line of super ratting in a completely safe environment”
---
he actually has a risk of dying to the rats unlike carrier ratting plus he doesn’t know if something cloaky or a blob is waiting at the exit that is broadcasted throughout the system.
---
   Subcap ratting with ships like the VNI are all highly capable of being paralleled and afk-able, like the rorq only limited to the amount of accounts you can run.
---
  Didn’t know about the ability of multi boxing T5’s but it’s more on level with carrier ratting where you are limited to what you can do and what your brain can handle and not the power or your PC and wallet for multiple accounts.
---
Also Amarr space tends to be a bit safer. :)
---
Yeah it’s full of Turbo nerds that can’t relax
---
Tristans are great! Just dont forget to put out your drones like dumbass me when first time solo pvping
---
Things that we dont need, but we need
---
good for him

Oh hey, it's another one.

.iH

No one, Panfam is just shuffling around their sov atm.
---
Abyss is more of a solo activity, boson titan is more like 
---
&gt; let me blue 70% of the arena so I can be dumb risk free
---
Am I?
---
Did you take into account your opportunity cost of the raging dark filaments which are 25m / site?
---
Thanks for the info! This whole chain has been informative.
---
You give goons too much credit
---
You know, people keep telling me that. Funny thing is, they're all on their knees now. Triumverate, Black Legion, Pandemic Legion, CO2. Every one of them threw this tired old meme at us. Didn't work out so well for them, and it's not going to work out very well for you.
---
Personally, I'm kind of fond of V0LTA. Not in a patronizing way, I actually think they're skilled fighters and I like the whole theraboi mystique. But if you see half a dozen other people run face first into a wall you should probably put on the brakes before you join them.
---
Haven't tried abyssals, aren't there those PvP conduits or whatever that might appear? Or is it possible to still farm these and avoid them somehow?
---
Ok wait lmao that’s another question if I’m Gallente am I allowed in Amarr or am I just gonna get killed? Sorry for all the noob questions
---
valkyrie 1. the fit should not exceed 40mil
---
if a drone dies you have 7 other drones in bay ready to go
---
the whole point is to not tank and avoid any damage. warp away when you get hit
---
actually yeah pick the one more cap stable
---
Still didnt answer question tho...
---
I have been playing about 20 days now, started with minmatar and love the speed of the ships. Now when it comes to working towards something, everyone has told me loki. In the mean time I have been flying breacher and hound, with an astero to make money via explo as I enjoy the mechanic as well. What middle ground ships should I work towards flying on my way to loki? Some ships that caught my eye are the Huggin, SFI, Tornado, and Hurricane
---
where do you get these numbers? for all sites i spend less 850kk to ammo,filaments and boosters.
---
You're not gonna get through to some of these people. They lack accomplishment in their real life and need to have something they can feel that sense of accomplishment in. Because of the permanency of accomplishment and loss in Eve it makes it a perfect candidate and people get absorbed in to it. 
---
It's not uncommon to find people like that in any game, but the percentage of players in Eve is much higher than other games for the reasons mentioned.  Look up gaming disorders and give some of the articles a read. The parallels you can draw to a large portion of the Eve playerbase are disturbing.
---
You are unless you are in faction warfare or have a really low standing with them. (Certain missions will raise your standing with some factions while lowering your standings with others.)
---
You’ll be fine as long as your standings with the empires don’t fall. 
---
They’re like sec status, but unique to the empires (and other smaller factions in the game). If it gets too low you’ll be attacked by the faction’s police/armada.
---
BSB
---
didnt you mention u would bring 200 valks with you or something like that?
---
in one site how many times would u need to drop the depot (just asking to get an idea).
---
right ill use the cap stable one then. Its mainly good for the MWD always working right
---
Ok cool thanks so much for help
---
Thanks!
---
The Tranquility Trading Tower pact existed before the blackout. This is just some wormhole group picking a fight to generate attention and give their members content, and the obvious response from the stakeholders of TTT. The blackout is not a factor here.
---
I’d say it’s a perfectly fine game, even if you just want to a few hours a week when you can. Some people take it way seriously, some don’t. It’s like that with everything though EVE probably is more polarized. 
---
Just play how you want and have fun, don’t let others drag you down.
---
&gt; meant for fighting
---
geez the entitlement  
---
just because you can shoot people in it doesn't mean it's "meant" for fighting, just like how wormholes aren't "meant" for krabbing because you can rat in them
---
are you related to the "you don't deserve sov if you can't defend it" guy
---
Read this -  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System\_security](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System_security) It is very detailed and it's okay if you don't understand everything the first time you read it.
---
The people who stayed, and actually enjoy pvp. Were you hoping to only find miners, or weaksauce victims? What a dumb question.
---
Aha, nah. More like saving up for 30. I plan to plant my ass and go through at least 20, if not 30, time allowing. Plus, there's definately some basics I'd need help with, already got someone, just gotta find time for both of us.
---
Also learning logi as well, so half PVP I guess.
---
Sounds like something I'd do. Already planned on Tristan since I have Gall frig highest, with good drone skills.
---
Horde is +485 in last 7 days...
---
Drones, AB, Cap Battery, Armor repper, Nano pumps, Enams, Probe launcher, the rest to taste.
---
Makes since, I mean, in a wormhole, your word is really all you got, since anyone can fuck anything at anytime, with little repercussion if lucky/planned right (from what I understand).
---

If you're alpha you can't train sentries, and those are what make the Stratios and Ishtar good for high sec combat sites. Without those you're just a lower dps Gila that gets a scanning bonus. You don't need the cloak for high sec and the escalations that sometimes end up in low sec generally aren't worth the risk. And again, no sentries = suckage.
---
So without sentries I'd suggest to use a Gila (even though I dislike it).
---
Watch you local, pay attention to your grid. if anything doesn't feel right, just warp out. probably mine while align as well if necessary.
---
Two questions:
---
1. Is it possible to be a nomad in WH space for weeks as a frigate/destroyer, hunting frigs and explorers?  I'd like to do it while being in an attack ship (not an astero)
---
2. Let's say I wanted to find eve "jerks" and make them suffer (because PvP is better with a strong sense of Justice).  How can I do this?  Stealing, pirating, etc?
---
(Thanks for all the answers thus far!  Love this sub and game!  The community is amazing!)
---
Nice mene
---
Chill out.
---
Bovril Borers Coop is an amazing group of guys that can help you out. They are under the Goonswarm Federation super umbrella (Ey,Ey,Ey) and have VERY knowledgeable guys that can help keep you safe.
---
As for going SOLO my guess if you were in a venture in 0.5 space you are not worth killing for a suicide ganker or even worth loss of security standing for that matter. If it was a person who killed you.. it was just a PvP newb who saw an easy kill and just couldn’t resist.
---
My guess is that you probably got killed by “rats” (NPCs) that randomly spawn in anomalies and asteroid belts and shoot people mining in these nodes. As young of an account you have I doubt you would survive long against them.
---
As you go into lower security space the rats you encounter become stronger and stronger. And depending on the space, some even have special attributes to them that can make them hard to deal with (search warp scram/neuting , ext)
---
My suggestion would be to train into a procurer as fast as you can and just train up T1 strip miners first, then find out what damage type counters the rats in the space you are mining in and get that to level 4 for now. Then  get your drone skill to 5 so you can control max drones.. this is one of the most important skills in the game. Then get to where you can use T1 adaptive invulnerability fields.
---
Eventually you will train this stuff into the T2 variants starting with the drones, to the invulns, and finally train ICE strip miners (big $$) if you find an ice anomaly. Then T2 strip miners.
---
I suggest avoiding space below 0.6 until you get at least the T2 adaptive, and can control 5 T2 drones.
---
You have yet to provide any evidence to support your "facts"
---
This is what carriers and other supers \_should\_ be used for.
---
IMO, get rid of NPC fighters and *let players dock inside carriers instead.*
---
I feel attacked, downvoting this to be safe
---
Well there goes my Asklep clone :(
---
Dude THanks for the write ! goooood info
---
With the warp point, what I do is I’ll warp from one planet to another and when I’m about halfway I’ll hit save location. That way you have a spot that no one else can warp to without 100% scanning down your position. Also if you pick up drones instead of a ship, that’s usually a red flag too.
---
I didn't realize the dark was half the price of the electricals/others.
---
Still, Just making sure you're taking into account the 14-15m a site that gets sapped from filaments.
---
normally i would agree with you, but when you fly Cal, Gal and Min carriers, Cal, Gal dreads, Cal, Amarr Fax, and Gal Supers not to mention having a rorq as well it gets bloody confusing some times.... and a little QOL change like having iso's as diff colours would go a long way.
---
I thought that we only played on potato PC's back when had the original cyno graphics.
---
This isn't that old.
---
The Big Meanie Coalition
---
Clarification: if "safe" spot is between warpable objects (say, planets) then ship with the same warp speed could find you fairly easy without scanning with combat probes.
---
Easy countermeasure to this is once you are on such safespot - start to fly to random direction. This way you'll notice that someone has landed near you before you get shot.
---
We used to assign fighters to people, they changed it, doubt they will go back
---
Because, get gud
---
This makes it ~220m/h selling to buy orders after costs for anyone wondering.
---
fuck off retard
---
What do you mean by "assign to people"?
---
300m ticks?
---
fuck off
---
You can do a super cheap kite tristan. Cold gas mwd, t1 medium shield extender, scoped warp disruptor, 8 t2 acolytes, 2 named drone damage mods, 1 nanofiber and whateve combination of shield, speed/agility, and capacitor rigs you feel like.
---
Should be under 4 mil isk. 800-900k for ship and fit, rest for the 8 acolyte II.
---
That fit can kill a lot in faction warfare lowsec. And when the pvp bug bites, DnG is recruiting.
---
&gt; what if a carrier rebalance made it so that their primary role became this
---
Why have you gone and done that, at some point it's a silly matryoshka doll situation.
---
What do you mean by "assign fighters to people"? Were people able to buy and fly them?
---
Is she feeling deflated?
---
Can you do me a favour and drop the quality down just a bit lower? It's not pixelated and fuzzy enough for me.
---
Do you want me to pull logs? 120-150m ticks per titan
---
Code is -5 to us. You have been misinformed.
---
Depends on which faction you do and what your strategy is. Many people clear the whole pocket even though it might not be needed. If you have a good tank and high ranged dps you can just shoot/kill the triggers and then move on. Without good ranged dps you'll be forced to sit around longer which in some cases (like Serpentis Watch, first pocket) can get hairy due to silly high NPC dps. 
---
The real issue is that exploration is competitive so you're racing others or trying to rush past them. The main target (either a faction spawn or some structure in the last pocket) is pretty much always 40-55km away from warp in location. 
---
Wreck/can owner ship in these sites is based on damage done so lets assume a sentry Stratios warps in to the last pocket against a medium drone Stratios/Gila. Sentries are dropped immediately and apply dps, before the medium drones from the other ship have waddled their way to the target it's either already dead or damaged so much they can't ever catch up. Meaning the wreck/can will be owned by the sentry ship (or turret ship).
---
I've done combat exploration for well over a decade in a myriad of ships, from Stratios to Ishtar, Navy Omens and  Phantasms (and atm a Zealot), Muninns, Cerberus, Cynabals and yes also the Gila (just to try, I hate them). If I end up in a direct confrontation with a Gila then I just won't lose simply because I have insta damage weapons. It's the same but worse for a non-sentry Stratios as it has less dps: no insta ranged dps = no wreck ownership.
---
So you can DO them fine, right up to the point where you have to compete with others who use direct damage ranged weapons. Then you'll lose. Up to you if that's an issue for you.
---
That was a massive load of bullshit, i am happy that they dumped that mechanics
---
It’s not as bad as it used to be before citadels but There’s a lot of trust involved still. If a dude wants to screw over his friends he can open the door wide for an opposing group to evict them from their hole.
---
Yes, i want a steady 6 ticks in a row for both accounts
---
Anyone else out there have any other information or can lend a hand ?
---
That sounds like uedama, the ganking capital of eve because you have to go through it to get to Jita from gallente space. Usually they pop haulers for their cargo but if they get bored a mining ship is a nice change of pace.
---
That feature is not even remotely what I'm suggesting, and it's clear to me you didn't read the post at all. So I have added a TLDR.  
---
&gt;**TLDR: Give Carriers option to** ***dock*** (certain sizes of) **player ships** and balance appropriately.
---
I'm sorry that's as low as it gets.
---
Most important advice: don’t mine in highsec, it’s very boring and you will burn out and quit. 
---
You should join a group in low or null, if you’re interested in mining and industry nullsec is better.
---
So that Carriers have a unique role beyond just being gigantic drone boats.
---
Please don't be stupid enough to try this. They won't restore characters whos names have been taken, and if by some chance they do restore your character, it's without any isk or assets.
---

no don't
---
Meh if you're actually in wingspan you know we are all about fun/hour vs being the bestest hardcore wormhole bushido players. Half the fun is doing stuff in stupid fits and getting away with it. You ever see a loki and a tengu die to asteros? Because I have and it was fricken hilarious.
---
Youre doing honest work and I appreciate it.
---
New players are awesome !!
---
Welcome to EVE
---
Veeshan represent! Here's to hoping Pantheon ROTF is another long ride.
---
Addendum:
---
This rework would basically turn them into moving Citadels that don't have asset safety (eject all stored ships intact on explode), have onboard repair facilities (you pay the pilot), can store fully fitted ships for pilots to reship into, and feature the ability to force a given docked player to undock via the same interface you'd normally use for launching fighters or drones.
---
You'd basically be a mobile command base / mega support ship -- except instead of players interacting w/ an SMB, they'd be literally docking inside you.
---
Things that could be done with this:
---
* Be a roaming nomad gang that engages in guerilla warfare hit and run tactics, constantly harassing and picketing from a cloaked carrier deep in enemy lines
---
* Get a small force through a Cyno without using a Titan Jump Bridge
---
* Stow your forces in carriers to obfuscate your true power
---
* Run "Taxi" services where a carrier pilot fitted for fast travel offers to shuttle infamous pilots (or spies) through enemy territories
---
* Literally live out of a carrier in deep space (would require intense coordination, though, because if the carrier logs off, you're launched out)
---
Anchor your own and quit complaining
---
This is correct.
---
VNIs easily pull 60m an hour
---
Theres eveworkbench.com its kind of like osmium or a clone of it but its up to date. The last fit was posted 9 hours ago. Its also got a couple of other tools i think but i havnt looked into to hard.
---
I see, well i dont plan to compete tho, but thanks for taking the time to break it down for me! i really appreciate information like this. So what do you suggest i fly to do combat sites? (except for the Gila since i already did it with it)
---
I expected at some point for the Trigs and Drifters to start fighting each other.
---
I would like to point out to you that I hold rather moderate beliefs but I still make edgy jokes because I find them funny. Oh yeah but these nazis say similar things and hide it as just irony so THIS person must be a nazi! Don't generalize people who are just edgy as people who are nazis.
---
Ehh seen plenty of drunken brits in my day, but usually that's just the FC rather than the entire fleet that's shitfaced lmao
---
Best part for me see is seeing bads without their weapons grouped in 2010.
---
Guns weren’t groupable back then
---
Is there anywhere you can actually buy these?
---
Yes they were, I started before apocrypha and I have never not been able to group my guns.
---
It was introduced before t3c’s were in the game and was actually implemented in 2008
---
You can for sure make 7B in PI, more or less depending on your setup and how much of your playtime is dedicated to it, cus it’s going to take you an hour every other day, and maybe 3 hrs once a week.
---
It does happen occasionally

---
I always thought that this would the theme of the new 'mothership' class that was supposed to come back after the nomenclature change of the current ships to 'super carrier'.   The 'new Moms' would be mobile star base platforms that players could dock in, and would undergo a forced session change to the new system when the ship jumped or ejected all the ships.
---
It would be functionally similar to a titan bridge, except having a hard m3 or ship-count limit per supercapital.  There would also be a tactical advantage since the opponents wouldn't know what (if anything) is going to come flying out until after they are already on the combat grid.
---
Same
---
the celestis (especially with logi) is super underrated. It can shut down alot of things that are tough to deal with. We use Keres alot just cause of speed but celestis pretty legit if done right
---
PvP conduits are opt-in, so the meta is that PvE ships skip those in the final room, while the PvP fit ships blitz T3 filaments to get into the PvP room as fast as possible. 
---
There's still considerably more risk of losing your ship to a socket close, really bad spawn luck, etc, compared to losing a tanked super or Rorq with a cyno in an umbrella region.
---
What is the citadel trick for drugs not giving penalties?
---
Alao, do you feel like ccp has done a secref nerf to abyssal drops?
---
Yeah this is essentially exactly what I am referring to.
---
You might not plan to compete but others will. You might be doing a 5 pocket 3/10, having cleared it to the 4th pocket almost completed, and I enter that pocket in my Zealot. I WILL race you for it. What are you going to do? Try anyway (but now knowing you're probably just not going to win), just warp off because you didn't plan to compete or (after it happened a zillion times) switch to a ship that CAN do it?
---
Still it depends, if you want to be lazy (or just don't care much for performance&amp;competition) then non-sentry drone ships work fine. If you want performance (which requires effort and active piloting) you have other options, especially since Alpha's will have their drone skills nerfed soon, no more T2 medium and down to lvl 3 Drone Interfacing. 
---
I'd use any faction/pirate cruiser with ranged weapons. One which faction/ship you enjoy and that suits the type of space you want to be in (damage types wise). Navy Omen is great for Amarr sites, shield regen Cynabal works great for anything but Amarr. Both with long range weapons so heavy beams or 720/650 and light drones. 
---
However, if you just ENJOY a specific ship don't let anyone tell you any different.
---
That's not a good thing.
---
i didnt know about the alpha nerf tho :/ damn, might not do this at all haha
---
Whats your fit for that Alpha Navy Omen?
---
You can nomad through wormhole space basically forever, never need to dock in a structure. The orca carries ships, ammo, everything, and also lets you refit in space and can also rep your pve/pvp ships after you escape a bad situation. Its a mobile base.
---
Idk my man, I hardly ever get downvoted, your posts must be shit.
---
no trick for "not giving". you can roll booster on citadel by jumping between 2 clones. there's one penalty(sheild hp) you can keep.
---
i'd rather ccp focused on giving players a reason to fight each other, first.
---
So was most of eve back then, don't worry man :)
---
This may be too broad a question, but here goes.
---
What sort of things make a corp/alliance think someone is a spy?
---
An irl friend and I just game back after a break of a few years. He attempted to join a Corp within a large alliance, was asked if he spoke French (we're Australian and he doesn't), when he responded "no" he was told "we don't believe you" and blacklisted as a spy. Random, but OK. He found another Corp in another big alliance he liked, was in for a few weeks before waking up to being kicked from the Corp and blacklisted as a spy again. The reasons they were given aren't true (so he says, but I believe him) and now he's Corp-less and wondering why the hell it keeps happening.
---
His character has way more SP than mine, but our employment histories are almost identical and not exactly exciting. I don't doubt, given the opportunity, he'd love to be a spy. But if he was, he'd almost certainly brag to myself and our small clique of irl friends that play together. At this point he's just frustrated and confused.
---
I´m confused:
---
\-If I downvote this you are right and I downvoted a fact
---
\-If I upvote this you are wrong and I upvoted a lie
---
send help please!!!
---
Downvote to be safe
---
I give you props foe uploading the 3rd meme of the same topic, this time not in the most grainy image imaginable,  however I still feel attacked so still downvoting to be safe
---
Well of course not. Gewns is a Corp. These are alliances
---
This would make it able to transport passengers, which I doubt will ever happen in EVE.
---
And how would traffic control work if 1000 carriers jump in a system each filled with 20 players and their ships who then undock?
---
That article is outdated. They unbiomass on request nowadays, hardly 'exceptional circumstances'. 
---
This post is based on multiple people having done it too.
---
Passengers? Yes. That is exactly what I'm suggesting, yes.
---
Citadels basically are this, they just can't move.
---
Re. traffic control: I suppose that's what the partnership with Hadean and that whole Aether Wars 2.0 thing might one day have to solve. With the current server architecture, yeah, you're probably right, that scenario would probably cause Tranquility to literally melt.
---
\*Downvote Hits\*
---
Dont forget. Celestis turns automatically wins the damp war against enemy black ops assuming you dont get into a lock battle with them
---
If you're mining in a venture (which I suspect you are with 1.1m in the bank) you're easy pickings for gankers. I'd say mine in a more out of the way system and haul your ore back with a freighter or skill into a procurer and and mine in a higher security system.
---
Could easily incorporate this. Ally a side etc etc.
---
the cartels are back.
---
I feel sorry for the people who had their time wasted by joining this fleet, probably wasting a 30minutes-1 hr just twiddling their thumbs while their respective FC's did ~things~, shooting that undefended structure for 26 minutes and then being stuck with jc timers forcing you to be trapped in highsec and/or spending another 30 minutes going back home. 
---
So much ugh.
---
Link lossmail.
---
Add a timer for launch per ship (cooldown on mass?), cap cost as well. Treat it like air traffic control, can’t launch everything at once ... limited “runways” ... possibly the ability to sub target launch facility as well. 
---
Adds risk to “let’s jump on this carrier and swarm out” ... you’d have to coordinate who launches first etc. 
---
Also - if you neut the shit out of it, it slows down launch capability, plus you could FVB the crap out of it ... otherwise it’s a bit OP. 
---
But, to add some more balance ... RNG if the carrier pops, those that have the RNG gods on their side are instantly in space and can blap to their hearts content.
---
Top-quality salt.

Not all people who want to pvp are AT pilots dude. Sure, some fights are adrenaline-driven, high octane fueled brawls but at the end of the day we just love to see shit blow up regardless of the means or circumstances. #blackoutforever

---
The latter.
---
Rorqs dont pull in more than that. It just got nerfed. If you throw in moonmining then sure but thats not straightforward and depends on many other things.
---
Eve players are little concerned about lose a ship.
---
Its normally players from other MMOs that come to eve and freak out about losing a ship.
---
Other MMOs don't really let you lose anything
---
Had to check if it would work on a max alpha heh. Going to require max fitting skills and a 3% PG implant. It's highly recommended to have tanking implants (askleps) and if you do blood raider sites be CAREFUL, stay at range. 
---
With named beams fitting becomes a ton easier and you don't miss out on too much dps (generally just 6% or so) but you will lose  Gleam, it's not that useful but sometimes it helps.

Are you sure it was just shitty loot ?
---
I tried testing out the dark filaments and from what i could make out the darks might be cheaper but the multiplasmids you also get are much cheaper to on average.
---
I then found out that the dark filaments are the sites that people like to triplebox hawks in. As the rats can't hit the frigs with the extra speed and nerfing of their guns. So the tripleboxers are pumping out a lot of dark filament loot onto the market  with the double drops they get.

I would say Black Magic and Voodoo. But it would be more believeable that they either monitored his behavior and somehow he looked fishy. Else their can also be something about his name.

There is no direct spy detector but most big alliances have programs installed who look for spies and thats also why most big alliances want your full esi Informationen

1. Sure, only Problem could be supplies in ammo where you just do daytrips to hs and fill up.

You want the game to have less staff because a minority game play doesn't like how the majority of subscribers want to play?
---
renters arent in horde, we just purge inactive players every now and then

As you wish, sir

Horde number changes will mostly be from new players/low effort spies joining, and then going inactive and getting purged whenever we hit the max number cap for a corp.
---
It's a game, true
---
But there are people invested(wasted) tens of thousands of hours into this game
---
Is no top or is o top.
---
I have to agree with u/VindicoAtrum here. 
---
If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck... then it's a duck. Lowsec passes the Duck Test.
---
make sure you fit a reactive hardener only if you are in a tanky ship. If you die before the hardener can adapt (it takes cycling time) it will be useless. Therefore you see them mostly on ships like prophecys and battleships etc.
---
The only way to safely mine in HiSec is by follow the Code and have a nice mining permit in your bio.
---
The ability to dock ships in other ships would be really great. I also vote for getting rid of bridge mechanics in favor of docking your ship into a ship with a jump drive.
---
Black ops going to be a bit weird, but I am confident we can find a solution for this as well.
---
Also you can fill your Rorqual with a mining fleet and do a daytrip mining in null.
---
Maybe this even opens up for a mothership type, with limited combat capability, but good at moving larger fleets around.
---
One issue I can see is handling player disconnects when "docked".
---
The biggest issue is ofc CCP code.
---
wat
---
grab a heron train t2 light drones strap an expanded probe launcher on and fit shield tank in the mids, you can do it for about 5m and in j-space you can find some juicy explorers to pop, fun way to learn combat probing and how to pick fights.
---
Eve does attract a lot of casual players,in fact,the majority of players are still casuals. However it does cater to a niche group that really wants the dyhard experience.
---
Get good
---
Because this game need some degree of IQ, i mean, if you get to own a ship with jump drive you should know that Gallente use oxygen isotops, Amarr helium and so on...
---
If you're in lowsec, join shoot first. They're big on mining.
---
Stront dude!
---
U mad, tho?
---
You should read your own post.
---
PLEX is superficial and all you can buy with it is game time and cosmetic stuff.
---
The ISK value comes from being able to trade PLEX or the skins on the market.
---
If everyone would stop using skins and pay for their accounts with real money, PLEx would literally be useless.
---
"haha I just compared you to some of the most horrible people in history you stupid snowflake!1111!1!1". Is that all you can say? Is that really your response? Are you so afraid of confrontation you insult rather than actually come up with a response?

Sounds like it might have been NPCs rather than other players? You should have gotten a killmail alert in your bottom right, click on that and see what did the damage to you.

why are you such a retard all he time?

&gt; They expected to fight TEST 
---
Since the Keepstar is run buy TEST, PH and Goons, I don't think anyone was surprised they all teamed up and this includes V0LTA.
---
There is no way of stopping these big groups doing whatever they do in highsec, but appearently the Azbel was #alreadyreplaced by the time it went down.
---
From my perespective, even TEST, PH and Goons as alliances alone are quite disturbing, since they are basically nations at this point.
---
Sorry I'm not about to dive into a debate with someones eve online reddit alt account. Also, you're a coward. :)
---
What if test is blue to both npc factions
---
In terms of metaphoric Carrots and Sticks, several years ago CCP went about putting a whole heap of juicy Carrots into lowsec, to entice people into making day-trips or even living there permanently. 
---
They didn't take away any of the Sticks. And being whacked by a Stick is what dissuades the newbies from coming-to or staying-in Low. 
---
In my opinion, as a career lowsec pirate, is that CCP needs to take away some of those Sticks. And at the same time, give newbie/solo players more tools to *evade* PVP. 
---
More Carrots are not needed!
---
There's a shitload of ISK to be made in Low, but it's only accessible if you're a seasoned player. It requires enough SP to handle DPS pressure *and* neut pressure. Often, that will come from flying in T2/T3 ships. Which makes you a bigger target, *and* makes losses hurt more.
---
what kind of booster?
---
How is 5 mil for the hull expensive ?
---
&gt;The death bells ring for ~~hisec content~~ EVE
---
Point of advice, don't use Thermal drones against ships that are Em/Therm tanked. Don't use Thermal drones against gallente ships either, they have a huge explosive hole. Also, if you're waiting for the VNI to come to you, decloak on him when he's 20km away from you, so he orbits right into you during your cloak targeting delay. scram, web, neuts, Berserkers, dead VNI.
---
I'd also recommend using a MAAR &amp; Reactive instead of dual MARs. Look up Michael Wilmore's killboard and look at his dead stratioses. Dude frags VNIs and Domis in Esoteria like there's no tomorrow.
---
This is literally my main and I don't have anything to prove to you. You started this comment chain with me so yes you tried to debate me and now you don't want to finish. That's fine but don't generalize people as bloody nazis because you don't agree with their humor.
---
Looks like we need a remake.
---
&gt; PLEX is superficial and all you can buy with it is game time
---
You can buy 2 billion isk with 500 plex and CCP will facilitate  the trade start to finish. How you didn't know this is beyond anyones guess, you're being completely disingenuous if you understand this.
---
Carriers are not drone boats. Fighters are piloted.
---
I'm OK with this
---
Man I have no clue what happened the past two weeks, did the blackout really affect abyssal PvP this much? In the past 3 streams (4 hours each, during prime abyssal PvP time) I've had maybe 3 proving conduits and they were empty.
---
To be honest, don’t mine in low ever, and only in null if you have a response fleet ready from your alliance/you don’t care if you lose your ship. 
---
The advice about dscan is good, but there are many ships that can warp cloaked, and a few that are invisible to dscan, so a hunter in one of those will kill you no matter what you do.
---
Hah someone's salty because they died to a mining ship.
---
You can trade 500 PLEX for 2b ISK in the PLEX store?
---
Haha we learned by being test pets apparently
---
Ty probably i need to go to lowsec for 1v1, usually in null..there are gangs, be it small or larger.

Oh well, you are doomed ... You are: One of us now!

I'm looking for ideas on what ships to use in order to make ISK in a C3 WH. I have my main (30mil SP) and two alts which can all be played at the same time. My alts are still rather new (around 2-3mil SP each only) so I'm looking for something that doesn't require a long train time. Any suggestions?
---
I hope this isn't a finished skin, because those red lines look like something I'd draw in MSpaint when I was 5.

Top speed of that porpoise was about 2000, cold no implants

So... Faction warfare?
---
"Cloaked watching the fight" "He (and his stabber friend, don't forget him) got you to 23% hull." So either you are the Vedmak pilot or you stayed cloaked and just watched your friend die while you were in comms with him. I'm going to go with the first since you think there were a bunch of ECM drones, you probably just didn't realize it was the Athanor doing the jams.
---
Translated.. "REEE I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAN A PROPER DREAD BOMB"
---
Oï ! 
---
If you want to make good money, in pretty much any profession you’ll come to a point where you need better modules, ships and support skills, which mean you’ll have to train a lot and for a long time. But since you have some alts, it’s already better :)
---
In C3, the bread and butter of ISK are sleeper anomalies and exploration sites (signatures with Forgotten or Unsecured in their names). One of the best ship to use with one character is a blingy Rattlesnake, so always spam your DSCAN ! You should also pack a PVP fit, and at least one cloaking device to keep your ratting ship safe-ish, but it depend if you’re planning to use a POS, a citadel, or just throw some giant containers in a safe spot out there in space.
---
You’d also need the ubiquitous Astero, if you want a small PVP ship that can also scan around and do pirate relic and data sites, or a Covert Ops frigate, if you want to scan down signatures really fast.
---
Finally, a Blockade Runner is a great addition to get your stuff out of the wormhole and on the market. Just remember that just having a Covert Ops cloak isn’t enough, a Sabre cloaked on a wormhole (or a gate, if you have to do some jumps in nullsec) will fuck your day up.
---
The rest is up to you. Bring a Mobile depot, or maybe even an Orca for refitting and use the ship maintenance bay to keep your ships safe.
---
Maybe store a mining barge, if you want to do some mining when you don’t have many signatures around, and of course : PvP ships.
---
"but they decloaked first" \*looks at Vedmak with no cloak\* :thonking:
---
1h a day/char for PI? You know that extractors run on their own and you don't need to cheer them on, right?

This is good advice but doesn't take into account the cloaky daggeries.
---
You cant run from people you cant see.
---
This isnt a blackout thread.
---
You consider wanting to kill people in a PvP game to be a bad thing. I dont think we're going to find a consensus.
---
Goons, Test, Fraternity, GOTG, and PanFam are all playing the krabbing under an umbrella game. It's not a rant about players or alliances or coalitions, it's a rant about mechanics which have pushed people into the most mind numbing gameplay there is.

No, I'm someone who both adapted to the meta and realize that it sucks.

Take a look at road traffic lights. Do you really think they would serve better if people used words instead of color coding? Is using colors in there in any way related to catering ...?

Or how about when you clearly press the jump button and then don't actually jump cuz the client be fooked!

How does that work and why does it need the same warp speed?

I assume you thought some serpentis belt rats are gankers
---
That's exactly why plex is there...go for it.
---
you want to add a new ship/weapon that does unreppable damage to caps? you realize whats gonna happen when the large groups get their hands on that, right?
---
Go for it, dude, no harm in that - grinding in the game is dull as hell and if you have a decently paying job, why bother?
---
And now you know how such mistakes happen.

50k or so.

the better question is why in hell should you care

I'm not sure whether you are talking about mining defense npc or FOB npc, because pirate diamond npc don't spawn in highsec unless there is a FOB present in system
---
Yes please
---
is that a /r/copypasta ? if not, it should be
---
You say that like we've gotten better.
---
Nothing wrong with at all (in fact, it makes the early game experience much better if you have a bit of ISK and/or extra Skill Points to work with from the very beginning).
---
Just don't go so overboard with it that you pay out a ton of cash to put yourself into a ship you have no business flying because you have no idea what the heck you're doing.
---
This is what I'm fearing. Obviously I wouldnt go out and fly a 2bil Isk ship, but I don't know if I would lose some learning experiences by doing so. 
---
I know lots of other MMOs view it as cheap or cheating when users do so.

I'm always in for some PvE. If there are more non-PvP battles, I'd go for it.

Mining defense npc, def.
---
There are no guristas mining defense fleets in highsec
---
I'm not a fan of newbies buying plex for isk and/or skillpoints. Here's my reasons for it:
---
\- What holds new players back is not a lack of skill points, it's a lack of knowledge understanding and ideas on what options he has and what play style he'd enjoy. You can't buy skill, you can't buy experience and knowledge. Those are player traits, not in game character traits. They take time and effort to grow and by the time your have gotten better as a player your character will have caught up SP wise.
---
\- Things don't get more fun with bigger ships. If you're not having fun mining in a venture (because it bores you) you won't enjoy mining in a barge either. It's the same thing. If you don't enjoy doing lvl 1 or 2 missions, you won't enjoy doing lvl 3 or 4 missions. It's the same thing. 
---
\- By giving yourself a ton of isk and skillpoints, you rob yourself of early goals and "victories", things you actually achieved yourself. These are very important to keep the game interesting, otherwise you'll quickly fall for the other game EVE offers: Skillqueue Offline, where you create a long training plan and just don't bother playing till you reached it because it's "no fun" otherwise. Only to find that it's still "no fun" because you have the wrong mindset, while at the same time lacking the experience you *would* have gotten had you actually played. It all becomes meaningless.
---
\- Apart from some very specific play styles newbies can do just fine, even/especially when grouping with older players. There's always something that needs doing that a newbie would be great at.
---
No, it's actually necessary so that people who dont want to pay real $ can stay subbed.
---
When you buy PLEX for ISK, what you're actually doing is trading another player a subscription or cosmetics for ISK.

---
I know, that's what I'm doing and getting the error. If I weren't in the system, then I wouldn't be making this post, would I? Also worth mentioning, the signature manager is going crazy. Updates the wrong signatures, sometimes breaks down and takes 30+ seconds to reload after a change, all sorts of nonsense.
---
Just don't be that guy who thinks he can spend a couple of thousand dollars and "buy win" then gets incredibly mad when it turns out that there are other significant factors than having an all-purples fit.
---
Or actually go right ahead if you like, it's your money, and we like a good laugh.
---
It works though exploitation of game server's implementation feature. The game's world simulation is not continuous, information about objects is updated after equal time intervals called "ticks". AFAIK one tick is equal to one second.
---
So, basically, when you warp between points A and B with speed of 5au/sec, instead of actually moving through all the distance, you get teleported 5au further every second, except for slower acceleration and deceleration. And a ship of comparable size and with the same warp speed would be teleported at exactly same places along the way (AFAIK only warp speed matters, agility is irrelevant, but I'm not sure). So by warping the same way as you and making a handful of bookmarks while he warps, this other ship could easily find your "safespot" by warping to bookmarks he made.
---
AFAIK you even could use ship with different warp speed and also you could find spots which is not right between static warpable objects, but that would take a lot more time and I personally never tried this.
---
Probably because having every goddamn thing colour-coded kinda clashes with the rest of the GUI
---
Well, they dropped on me at 0.5 and I see them occasionally.
---
Not sure if you are running solo or not, I'd be more than happy to give you access to my c2 wh with hs / c3 connections. Being able to roll c3's is great isk and you never run out of sites.

Yeah, that's because there is a FOB in your system, it spawns roaming diamond npc, same type of rats, but they are not mining defense fleet
---
as long as you buy it from CCP and not some gold selling fuck no one will care.
---
You scammed them, if you give it back now that it's yours you are scamming yourself. Scamming is allowed either way so pick who you want to scam from here.
---
No one cares about that kinda stuff, good for you - enjoy the extra money
---
Eh, I still died more to npcs than gankers regardless.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I know he gave full tokens for all characters on both of his accounts. When he was kicked he was asked to resubmit them and then they handed him the fabricated excuses. I assumed someone just got it in their head that he was a spy and once that happens there's no real way to convince someone you're not.
---
Max fun per hour!
---
Don't undock.
---
You can't buy 2b ISK from CCP with 500 PLEX. You can *sell* your PLEX at current marketprice. If nobody would use PLEX to pay for subscriptions or skins, it would just be a number on your PLEX vault.
---
&gt;Will ratters re-ship? If so, what to? And what will be the new go-to for lower skilled players?
---
Myrmidon and Dominix.
---
&gt; Do we think some people will change to a different means of making ISK (taking them out of space), or do you think we will just see a shift in the types of ships out there?
---
Shift in ship type.
---
There will be no shortage of idiots to catch. The blackout itself not the VNI changes will have hidden the most clever from your sight.
---
You could always send me the isk, it's a good investment believe me.
---
And it also happens to be the worst implementation of a colour blind mode i have ever seen. Also, this could only help people with a colour deficiency; those who are truly colour blind (as in: cannot see \*any\* colour')  still won't see shit.
---
I think you should find yourself a wh corp, most of them do a lot a pvp and will help learn how to live there, how to make isk and pvp in small/medium gang.
---
Have fun
---
You reported it to r/eve. We hereby grant you the right to keep the 200m. The only liability would be posting the name of the buyer, so we can make fun of him
---
"Convenience fee", learn from online billing.

Same thing roamers do when there is 0 spool up or warning and 50 supercaps can instantly teleport onto their gang from several light years away: cry on reddit.

They're probably kicking themselves for fucking up like that, but nah, that's Eve mate. If you really feel that bad go ahead and give it back, you might make a friend if you follow up on it and in Eve friends can be even more valuable than that money, esp one that you know (probably) won't scam you.
---
Perhaps something of a slight tangent, but I'd like to see dreads / carriers / supers / titans given a separate close-in weapons system, and then nerfbat their primary.
---
An aircraft carrier has at least a couple of CIWS guns fitted, and a few dozen machine guns that can be used to deal with small incoming threats, but those are not going to be able to put out the same amount of damage as its fighter / bomber wing.
---
That way, you can nerf the application of their main weapons to subcapitals / smaller ships, while still giving them some entirely reasonable ability to protect themselves, but doing maybe 1/3rd of the DPS of their mains.
---
Having two independent levers to pull to balance things is far better than one.
---
What happens when your super umbrella bridges to save you and your cyno has 0 spool up 
---
unless your retarded or afk you can get your cyno up before the inhibitor comes online
---
It works both ways I’m not sure what the answer is without screwing over the majority of people who use cyno’s  ie jump freight or pilots, 
---
or making it that the defensive party has an unassailable advantage in big battles locking enemy fleets out of the system all together
---
The real issue is that most PvE is single player gameplay while hunting is group gameplay.
---
Well compare to the rest of eve it's not a huge community so I think they tend be cooler, help new people that come to wh life.
---
When They fight, the loosing group will try to win the next time they encounter but there are no hard feelings
---
its not ok when they do it.
---
This is a very common occurrence. The way the market works is that the item with the lowest price is always the one that actually sells, regardless of the price that someone entered. There is usually 2 ways this happens. 
---
1. Someone fat fingered their buy order and added an extra 0
---
2. Someone attempted to purchase a higher priced item from the market, he still pays the listed price he chose but buys from you instead
---
You will not get banned at all for this it's completely intended in the market game mechanics. Congratulations on the extra 200 million I suggest you keep it.
---
There is counterplay: supercap umbrella. Next thread!
---
Sure it's Test with is basically goons at this point.
---
Here's how it works:
---
When someone buys something it will ALWAYS be bought from the cheapest sell order in that station. If someone selects that item from a sell order at a higher price, it's STILL sold by the lowest sell order but at the price the buyer agreed to. 
---
So there are two options:
---
1) the buyer wasn't paying attention/drunk/stoned/a Goon and facerolled his market window
---
2) the buyer wanted to somehow transfer cash between another character who had made that specific expensive sell order, not knowing it wouldn't work (and it doesn't work for that specific reason)
---
So it's not your fault, someone else messed up either by accident or by trying to game the system, and you're now swimming in iskies because of it. Enjoy it and laugh at any weakling attempt of them to try and get it back.
---
Ishtars are back baby!
---
Dominixes too probably, insurable which has to feel useful for krabs.
---
Interesting, I'll check that out.
---
I’d like to see the Empires react dynamically to the actions of player corporations in null. The large null alliances could pose realistic threats to appreciable chunks of Empire space, and it would be cool to see the AI occasionally make their own incursions into resource rich systems or strategically important systems in null and fight player corporations.
---
This will never happen of course but it would be interesting to see
---
Vnis will be replaced by Dom is and myrms.
---
Exceptions being people who upgrade to a cap instead, or those who go and earn better isk for less effort elsewhere.
---
Send me all your is and ill double it.
---
You right-click.
---
How are the train times for these alternatives? Are they prohibitive to lower skilled players, or nothing in it?
---
I would crunch the numbers, but I’m out and about at the mo!
---
Dude, 99 tabs? Nice!
---
NCPL took it.
---
You’re a fucking idiot
---
What system are you mining in?
---
This can happen if the buyer mistakenly / carelessly entered his buy order price with wrong decimal place, making it 10 times higher that he intended to. It's normal game mechanics to fulfill such order. The order gets paid the price the buyer offered, and the money go to the order with the lowest sell price offered.

As one other comment mentioned, you may contact the guy (find him in your wallet / transactions) and offer to return the funds and you may make a friend.
---
NCPL defeated the other sov holding alliance and took their space!             
---
In glorious battle ofcourse.
---
I mean, Goons &amp; Friends did...
---
Did it was "risk free" 3, 4 or 10 years ago?
---
No? Well local was there and I never heard someone complaining about it...
---
So what's the relation between this supposed null safety and local? 
---
Yes it's a supposed safety because nothing is safe in null, recent campaign in Tribute is a clear example about that.
---
It's obvious and absolutely normal that you aren't a threat if you are a small group against a much bigger one on a large scale, like Godzilla said: size does matter. 
---
I said on large scale because on small scale even a 50 man bombers and command dessies fleet is a big threat, our stuka fleets and BB fleets are a clear demonstration of this. 
---
And let's think a moment about this supposed safety. 
---
Is null "safe" because of some specific null feature or some players related stuff? 
---
For what I understood the problem here are caps and supers jumping around to save everything right? 
---
So what's the cause of this excessive proliferation? 
---
Is it the local? I don't think so, local was there for years, when rorquals where rare, carriers were precious and titans were almost legends. 
---
Let's try to think about it, what's the real cause of this capital mess? 
---
Minerals were the same since ages, same for bpos and bpcs. 
---
Citadels Vs pos? Same industrial mechanics but different structures, maybe just a little easier with citadels thanks to rig bonuses. 
---
Maybe rorquals? Ummm maybe but let's go deeper. 
---
Rorquals are a big debate argument, I personally think that the rorqual change was a good decision because it opened industrial and production world to everyone, also to people with only a couple of accounts and not only 40 accounts multiboxers.
---
Hey... But I spent almost two years training for my rorqual toon, and that's normal because after titans are the most expensive ships in terms of skill points and training. 
---
So finally we have the root cause, what give people the opportunity to train rorqual, capitals, supers and titans toons in no time?
---
We all know the answer, it's injectors.
---
They are the real cause of today issues, not local not any player driven action or decision.
---
It's simply a CCP mistake caused by greediness, they choose to give priority to cash income and sacrifice game longevity.
---
They are killing the chicken forcing it to give more eggs, and more and more...
---
So instead of complaining and beat each others we should stay together and ask CCP one thing:
---
- make injectors usable only to alpha with 5M sp limit
---
- turn injected sp back to injectors (this will cause a drastic drop on their price that will help real new players)
---
- give players one free remap of al skill points to adjust them
---
It will be not a pain free solution and will cause a big shake to the market, a lot of capitals, supers and titans will be on market because people will not have toons ready to ride them, but imho it's the only thing to do to preserve the game in the long term.
---
Otherwise it will close soon, because less people in null means less production, less demand for ships in the big hubs, less income for everyone, less wars, less big fights, less interest in Eve by the public (people don't join the game because small scale pvp, the want wars and big empires, that's why eve is famous), less players... And game over :(
---
Try exploration, it's way more fun then mining and can get you much better isk.
---
This motivational Monday quote doesn't work for me.
---
Thx mate! 
---
My Corp has an old C2 with a small group in it and not too many rules regarding online times and such. I’ll try to live out of my Orca there, but they have all the small structures and some backup if needed.

I am working shifts with a 3 month old baby, so everyone telling me I have to be online at certain days or times will make me run away 😂

This iteration of TRI became fuccbois the second they sucked up to UAxDeath and got Insmother.

---
PL is doing what PL always does, adapting to the current meta in EVE to remain a nullsec superpower. In today's EVE this means being an empire builder.
---
Its perfectly ok but do yourself a favor: plex in small regular amounts each month rather than all at once. Will show you what playstyle you can afford and youll become better at turning your buck into what you enjoy.
---
It’s perfectly fine to do this, but you’d do well to remember that isk doesn’t buy tangible skill at actually flying any ship. Your character may have the capabilities to buy and fit all of the best modules for it, but that doesn’t mean you know how to effectively use them.
---
Wouldn’t that just be oppressive as fuck to subcaps and doctors? Super close range tackle killer? No ty
---
\&gt;Declares war on an arrangement all of nullsec empires had agreed on.
---
\&gt;Gets shiton by said nullsec empires.
---
\&gt;Surprised ~~Pikachu~~ Choridon face.
---
Grinding for isk is very monotonous and boring in the game. If you have the means to avoid it, do it. The best way to learn pvp is to jump right into it without the fear of losing your ship.
---
625 on faction 734 t2 ammo. without drones. i use drones only for blowup additional cans.
---
Instead of nerfing the triage bonuses, give them a cooldown, say 10 minutes or so. So it's basically something you use once per fight, maybe twice if it's a long one. Now it becomes a real decision to be a super-sayan rep machine or just a somewhat more effective logi.
---
yes.prices drops by people. no hand of ccp here.
---
bsb
---
My personal view on this is that paying for ISK is probably more worth it when you gain the experience of flying in EVE. The grind is hard and time consuming but it does not hurt the wallet and also pushes you to learn how the different aspects of the game work. No one will like you or dislike you because you purchased ISK all you doing is saving grind time and contributing to the game we all love. One way or another you will gain your experience with flying and loosing ships just don't go overboard and waste your money on bling stuff when you have no experience.
---
No, but if you are new I'd recommend turning that isk into skill points rather then expensive ships.
---
A frigate, destroyer or even a basic cruiser should not be able to keep a capital held down for very long. Personally I think that all capitals should have at least +2 warp core strength by default, but that's another discussion entirely.
---
But yes, faced with CIWS, frigates and individual dictors should be like flies on a windshield if they stay too close for too long.
---
"electronics" hasn't been a skill in years btw
---
The bots just die lmao.
---
You my friend have swallowed to much of the coolaid. Bots die when the server dies
---
Have*
---
another goon post
---
have you considered not being colorblind?
---
Well, to me it is like this: 
---
I have several alts on several accounts which are just trained for certain passive income traits (I don't use them atm because even that was too boring, since a little maintenance is still mandatory). But overall - later in the game - you will go for more accounts by default. More accounts scale up to more incoming (doing it properly). 
---
But more accounts also means plexing more (which I do via bank account). So I guess if you want to buy plex to buy injectors and ships instead of going for more accounts than that is totally fine. 
---
Just don't forget our forever-and-always mantra: Do not undock what you cannot afford to lose.
---
Fit a cyno on your ship, don't rat outside of umbrella and stop being bad.
---
Well it was pretty much 5he only powerblock left that pl and nc dot could successfully take on
---
Stop being a dick you know exactly what I mean
---
At least it has a color blind mode, I can count with one hand the titles that have one, It may not be good, but better than not having anything
---
Waves at Evan
---
Yeah Manes, like all your feeding,boom, rektd.
---
No one cares, but you will probably waste it if you don't know what to do with it.
---
I'm the buyer, gime muh money or I call the cyber police u scammer
---
Plenty of people PvP fit a bling gila or Iki, run T5 and do PvP after though.
---
No, generally this place frowns upon people who try to rat or mine to make isk, buying Plex isn't looked down on at all.
---
[removed]
---
This is why Null sec is the safest place to  carebare.
---
This is what I always wanted/thought FW would be like, NPCs fighting for power and control with players assisting along the way. Would make the entire FW part of the game more fun and interesting in my opinion.
---
You mean it isn't Impressive when me and 40 guys go on a 6 hour camping and roaming op to kill a lone VNI??
---
But muh 3lite pVp
---
Depends what he's flying. 
---
If he's in his vexor, he'll be dead before they show up. 
---
If he's in a rattle, he'll tank for a bit but may die. 
---
If he's in a carrier, he should be saved.
---
“I’d like to completely eliminate a dictor from being able to hold a super/titan”
---
Got it
---
Buying plex for isk is a relatively common and accepted thing to do. That's essentially one of it's few functions. On the other hand buying plex to buy something blingy you dont know how to fly and whelping it in the first few minutes because you're new to the game will just lead to others laughing at you.
---
It's bad if you want to use your carrier for any purpose bar transporting people from A to B.
---
If all else fails invade your rental alliance
---
cringe
---
As a low sec regular....it's awful the amount of time i need to rebuild SEC status from a fight to another. I usually wait for the suspect timer on the enemy ships, but sometimes, they don't get it and FC call the targets anyway.
---
As i do explo for isk, and farm escalations, i'm ok. But still, i takes to much time regain it Even with fast talk skiled.
---
The mechanics is not that bad, but the Lost shuold be smaller.
---
BoT disbanding do to Blackout, NCPL refugees taking free space.
---
The systems with an FOB also have Gurista/Blood mining fleets in system. Their response fleet will usually come in as soon as you enter their belt, due to the bad standing most people have towards them.  Combined with the Agency telling where they are now, they are an easy way of farming faction strong boxes in highsec
---
I agree, I feel rused.
---
If a dictor pilot is stupid enough to stay within close-in weapons range after dropping its bubbles, then yes, it should die in a fire.
---
Just check the Agency menu for FOB's. It will tell you which systems have one, so also which systems you should avoid to evade these npcs
---
NCPL were so starved for content we invaded our own rental allliance HAHA what idiots
---
No one looks down on people who rat or mine to make ISK. What's looked down upon is the incessant crying about any risk to their AFK ratting or mining in what is supposed to be a PvP game.
---
No its just that null sec is safe, and that makes a boring game. If null was disolved then the game would actually be worth it.
---
90% of people playing eve and having fun are in WH and HS.
---
CCP:
---
&gt;Before we started looking at details, we wanted to firmly fix the goal of the design for capitals
---
&gt;    * Provide interactive, meaningful, gameplay.
---
&gt;    ...
---
&gt;    * Capital ships should be effective in most combat situations without completely dominating the battlefield &gt;       and without invalidating other ship types.
---
Reading that now, it seems to be pure sarcasm. If that statement was sincere, they failed spectacularly. And - of course - never felt the need to adjust anything.
---
Jin'taan and Suitonia leaving the CSM makes me seriously doubt CCP's gonna do anything to address the sorrow state of this game anytime soon. Not because of any influence they might have on CCP (which is, at best, limited), but because I sense frustration on their part. CCP simply doesn't seem to care.
---
You just gotta hope Olmeca goes into overdrive mode and gives them at least half as much shit as they deserve.
---
In games with strong PVE content, buying your way past the lower-level stages to get to the higher/endgame content seems kind of silly.  Like, if you're here to play the game, then why would you spend extra money to not play the game?
---
Many people play Eve for the PVP and see the PVE or mining as a distraction.  If you don't want to make a job of mining, nobody's going to blink if you use your real-money job to support your PVP habit.
---
and, just in case someone gets a "bright" idea about the colors, i'd recommend pick the same ones as the ewar modules for the appropriate racial isotope/fuel block. no need to reinvent the wheel and confuse ppl by using new colors that aren't used anywhere else :P
---
lmao
---
your mum "worked" for it obviously. What im saying ccp wants bit less plex on market so people start buying gametime
---
Everything is better with a cyno :)
---
13 days of omega training time (so 26 alpha) to train a VNI to basic competency atm. If you have one right now it will take another 14 days omega (28 alpha) to train into a dominix.
---
The myrmidon will depend. If you want to try and fit it to speed tank it would be only a couple days alpha time to train but if you want to fit it like you would fit a dominix for this kind of ratting it would take just about as long as the dominix because most of that time is for training T2 armor hardeners. Which you will need as an alpha because you can't use the Sentry drones required to attack the rats from MJD range.
---
The basic VNI ratter is well within the 750k RAF SP they give you but the Dominix requires another 550k SP to train to basic competency.
---
If you can get me an alpha compatible ratting dominix fit i can give you harder numbers. These numbers were based on a basic shield/speed tanked VNI fit for EM/Therm (Sanshas/Blood Raiders) and a similar DPS fit for the dominix sitting still armor tanked.
---
Imagine if you could remote cloak a ship for X amount of time, maybe even until downtime? But after X amount of time it becomes uncloaked; could make a playstyle like this possible without the use of alts, could be a fun interesting mechanic.
---
&gt;No one looks down on people who rat or mine to make ISK. 
---
This isn't correct. Plenty of posts tell people to grind irl, or do something other than rat because that isn't what the game is for, or any number of other idiotic statements.
---
&gt;What's looked down upon is the incessant crying about any risk to their AFK ratting or mining in what is supposed to be a PvP game.
---
There you go with the assumption any ratting or mining is AFK. It's not. Unless you think people AFK when they carrier rat, because they're desperate for ticks consisting of absolutely nothing minus the cost of their fighters. 
---
And surely it's a "do whatever the you want" game? People act like being risk averse when you're ratting to pay your sub/ afford a new ship/ fund PvP is a bad thing. Which makes no sense. But also have no problem with someone who never undocks and station trades with bots all day.  
---
What about the incessant crying about supers being used to kill roaming fleets, when the roaming fleets use T3C's to kill lone mining barges or vexors?
---
From a friend who is in BoT
---
NC/PL are charging corps per month by members with more members costing alot more
---
You don't get system specifics anymore its rat/mine anywhere
---
NC/PL are going to take all the structures that are not astra/raitaru for themselves and your going to take the isk they give you or they will kill it
---
there is a standing fleet to drop the hammer on ect
---
so fun times
---
This is some golden advice right here
---
Thats a terrible anology.
---
&gt;If I weren't in the system I clicked, then I wouldn't be making this post, would I
---
TBH if you understood the system you wouldn't be making the post, would you?
---
Works fine for me, but I know what I'm doing.
---
imagine being this bored in your corp and making a video about it. really activates the cerebral implants.
---
This is what I suggest:  
---
1. Pay for your subscription with your credit card so your gameplay is focused on what you want to do rather than grinding for ISK.  
---
2. Sell a total of 500 plex in the first 3 months of your gameplay - no more. Use this money to buy non blingy/functional ships to ease your progress into the game - this means max t2 stuff.  
---
3. Focus on having fun in the next 3 months.  
---
4. At the end of 3 months, decide what you need to do.
---
Remember, you are useful even if you're in a rifter as tackler or a hauler or covetor for mining. Bigger better things will come by when the time is right.
---
It almost looks like they are following real human history.....
---
I'm just glad it's a functional entity, again?
---
It doesnt.
---
You can get +400m/hr if you know what are you doing. Thing is, you have to be careful and both eyes open. No afk multiboxin VNI as watching Netflix. You have to actually play the game.
---
"when you think your live is rough, think off all the shit your corp members have to take from you"
---
there fixed it
---
Problem is people use the term "PvP" when they are in a group and attack something that realistically stands no chance. 
---
Stomping ventures in your blinged T3C isn't PvP in the same way as running into another fleet that wanted to stomp that venture, and being forced to fight is.
---
But yeah generally people act like it's impressive when they use vastly superior ships and numbers to kill stuff that can't fight back. Then they cry when exactly the same tactics are used against them, via a titan gatecamp or something. 
---
It is what it is.
---
That doesn't do anything. Groups can just bring 4 FAX and never deal with the cooldown.
---
Faxes are really a fun-killer. If you cannot Alpha a target you're pretty much useless on the grid and can only watch as they slowly bash down your Structure.
---
Buy ship hit “save game” and just reload if someone kills you
---
I didn't see that Suit had crossposted my Twitter link but w/e, hope you guys enjoy anyway!
---
&gt; Perhaps something of a slight tangent, but I'd like to see dreads / carriers / supers / titans given a separate close-in weapons system, and then nerfbat the application of their primary.
---
You mean HAWs?
---
&gt; A frigate, destroyer or even a basic cruiser should not be able to keep a capital held down for very long.
---
Why?
---
No need for FW.
---
You have pretty good DEDs, and lvl5 missions and dome pretty Nice moons and ice. You can get 400m/hr, not as a new bro, but Even they can make good money.
---
Null has more risk, now with blackout, because before blackout Null SEC was way safer than Low...
---
Just be warned, if you ask anything remotely close to how to make more isk you will get bombarded by credit card to plex=best isk in game memes
---
This would've been so much more interesting than the anchoring of structures in enemy space that seem to be the current meta.
---
If you refund the money you should uninstall EVE and play Hello Kitty Online.
---
You got a windfall. Somebody did something stupid.
---
This is how you learn not to do stupid stuff in EVE.
---
Keep the money.
---
&gt;Jin'taan and Suitonia leaving the CSM makes me seriously doubt CCP's gonna do anything to address the sorrow state of this game anytime soon.
---
I left primarily because I got tired of talking CCP out of shooting themselves in the head, and into shooting themselves in the foot instead, then getting blamed by the community for CCP not running a marathon.
---
Who?
---
Tldr?
---
&gt; Will I be able to generate 6+ billion isk a month with this set up? Max PI on 9 characters with a barge, exhumer and orca mining also?
---
This is a guaranteed burnout after a couple of months max.
---
Caps are pretty busted. Bring back an actual escalation chain. The optimal fleet shouldn't just be 150 Titans, 50 Supers &amp; 50 FAX.
---
there is no consensus, some asshats will tell you it's something bad because they are jaleous.
---
Yes yes yes. I. Want. Now.
---
ah ok, I had no idea buy order mechanics worked that way.
---
Eh, kinda. I was more thinking a single module that has the damage output and tracking of say, a rack of unbonused medium autocannons. 
---
Capital HAWs still dish out at least a couple of thousand DPS last I saw.
---
It could be cool. A bunch of frigs and destroyer top. Everyone docked into the Carrier. The Carrier jumps into the cyno and every one start to undock. It has more logic than Titan bridges.
---
Carriers frig/destro. Super Carriers up to cruciers.
---
Then you have to adjust what you carrie inside of it. "X" number of T3 destroyers? Or double that number in bombers and ewar and logi frigs?
---
Logi and ewar frigs get more use. And heavy ship clases had to actually travel to go at fights.
---
Jesus christ, can you lower your nose a bit and just say "it's fine for me, probably just your connection"? You are not the only intelligent person on the planet, nor are you the only one that can follow instructions. I've used Pathfinder for years, it's worked fine so far. Now, when I am in J123456 and I'm trying to update the sigs for J123456, it gives me the error that I am not in system. I bloody am, I can see myself in there on the map.
---
That's filed under "cost of doing business".

With current numbers, you can put \~35 frigates into a carrier. Dropping said carrier into a fight, then launching 35 players into combat sounds a lot more fun for both sides than current capital combat.
---
I have never had issues telling new players to get ISK, so long as they use that ISK to buy 100 cheap/small ships as opposed to 1 expensive/big ship.
---
Start up the ranks, pick a few frigates/destroyers, get used to them first, then move to cruisers and so on. I've had tons of fun roaming lowsec in ships worth less than 30mil ISK in the past.
---
It means that they *need* to bring 4 fax to get the benefit that bringing one one would have done. It also means that fax casualties will go up.
---
What breaks it for me is the necessity to have an expendable cyno alt.   
---
Like, getting to the place where you want to be cynod in - ok, you can and should do that with a covops or an inty. But then, said inty needs to stay on the station for a while with the cyno lit, like a retard :) 
---
I would want to have this duration shortened, or, at least, give us some covops transport ships with a SMB and a reasonable cargohold - I would settle for an orca-sized transport, with the same fitting possibilities, doesn't even have to warp cloaked, just jump to covert cynos.   
---
how do you go about cynoing your stuff in?
---
Exactly that. EVE is Pay2Feed you're paying extra so the other guy can have a blingier killmail.
---
If it's to train essential skills or just experiment without worrying about making money nobody cares. It's also good for the economy so people with less RL funds can afford to buy PLEX ingame.
---
Eve never changes
---
Still not really worth it (but more interesting to do in a group than incursion or missions), still lots of ninjas.
---
Don't know what you mean about shooting an npc and warping out (though if I understand correctly what you are asking, as far as I know you have to be in the fleet that did the majority of the damage to get a pay out in isk and LP, and you have to be on grid and not cloaked. Could be wrong though)
---
&gt;your mum "worked" for it obviously.
---
so you're not just stupid, you're obnoxious... cool.
---
Manes needs some grammar lessons.
---
Still\*
---
I disagree... I mean sure if you credit card into a capital on day one yes your missing or, but if you sell some plex to buy 50 PvP frigates and go learn some hard ass lessons in faction warfare then you have only missed out on the shitty grind...
---
I would get two t3s with some specialized fits (pve/pvp) and a backup stratios or two (for when you get popped in a t3c and need to wait for skills to train up) instead of that battleship, and a prospect + endurance instead of that procurer :)
---
Interesting article. I have to say though, that the part that hit me the most is the throwaway line that the aoe doomsday were used to get interceptors as they came out of warp. It is just crazy to me that this game has gotten to a point where alliances are so big that they can afford to use titans to sit off gates and doomsday taxis. Absolutely mind-boggling.
---
Good article.
---
I do not think that Carriers are that oppressive these days, but only because no one bothers to use them. Three years ago roaming gangs got Carriers dropped on them all the time. Today, it’s a Nyx or a Hel. In 2016, it looked like Carrier fleets were going to replace Battleship fleets, but that didn’t really happen. Instead, we sort of went straight to Supercapital fleets.
---
In addition to the changes you suggest, you still have the ridiculous increase in EHP from Capitals to Supercapitals. Most benefits in Eve get only marginally better as you go up the chain. Supercapitals have always been an exception to the general scale of this trend. Supercapitals need a ridiculous EHP nerf across the board or some other hit to their defense that renders them more vulnerable.
---
The common problem, even after numerous changes, is with the ability to receive remote repairs while doing everything else with complete effectiveness. Make all capitals and Supercapitals have to employ some sort of 5-minute siege mode in order to be effective.
---
&gt;NC/PL are going to take all the structures that are not astra/raitaru for themselves and your going to take the isk they give you or they will kill it
---
what a deal.
---
I agree, just to make it worse.
---
You do you mate. No one cares how you feed your eve habit, as long as it is being fed.
---
Reading is good for you.  Get off twitter and open a book.
---
This kind of stuff never makes sense to me.  Why shouldn't unsupported caps be vulnerable?
---
Caps being able to "protect themselves" from subcaps is exactly what has sucked just about every last drop of balance and meaningful conflict out of the game.
---
Don't have to be in fleet. I got shere of the bounty when I was on grid and had whored on one rat.
---
I remember the good old days when caps were rare and you had a chance to take some down with subcaps. 
---
It seems to me that at least a good part of the problem is how many caps and supers there are these days. I like them as a force equalizer, but not as a main fleet component..
---
Ah really, did you just have to have done 1 damage, be on grid and not be cloaked then? That's funny I might just run around in an ibis tagging the last rat lol
---
so you want to have balance or just to hurt goons. At some point organization should pay off, or are you looking for a situation where it does not matter what is brought in to save some one the small gang always wins.
---
I'm confused.  You said you wanted them to be able to protect themselves, but now you're saying you want to give them medium ACs...
---
Can you point to a single example of a modern warship of any kind which does not have the ability to defend itself against a limited number of smaller threats?
---
Even most tanks have a chain gun in addition to their main weapon.
---
Wow
---
I would like there to be balance where if you bring 50 people to a fight - Which is not small gang - You have the chance of actively killing a capital which is dropped on you, as that reduces the defensive advantage people have, and encourages people to meet subcapitals with subcapitals of their own and produce interesting fights for both sides.
---
This was one of the greatest fights we have had in the last few months. I do not remember the last time my Basilisk reps were so red from overheating them. I was part of the sub cap fleet and man it was great fun. If i am not mistaken all enemy on grid died with us being 10-15seconds too late from saving the Titan. The FAX lot jumped in when the titan was already in structure. This is what EVE is supposed to be not 2000 man timed fleets with 10% TIDI. I wish CCP updates the monument and puts the Levithan wreck next to the other wrecks.
---
To this day I still say carriers should only be able to use Heavy and SS fighters. In almost any other genre the heavy fighters or Bombers were the only ones capable of dealing any real damage to other ships.
---
As others said, it depends on how you spend it.
---
Spending 20 bucks on stack of smartly fitted frigates that you'll be welping over a course of a month is a smart investment. 
---
Buying 1 blingy ship that dies 10 sec after you jumped into Tama is not a good investment.
---
The same goes for skill injecting, lets say you really like exploration, did it few times but can't wait until you fit those t2 modules, so you decide to use one or two injectors and it drastically improves your experience - then go for it. Just don't go injecting 500eur worth of skills while having no idea what you are actually doing, just dont.
---
Capitals better than everything. FAX better than everything. Titans SUPER better than everything. HAW guns bad idea. Boson SUPER bad idea.
---
You sound like a bit of a dick to be honest, maybe you should figure it out for yourself.
---
Who gives a shit about that? This is a game. If it's unbalanced and leading to shit gameplay then change it.
---
and you are a son of a "worker"
---
Can you point to a single example of a modern warship of any kind that was designed around other existing warships to provide fun and balanced fights that everyone involved would enjoy?
---
***&gt;  Capitals have effectively made Subcapitals redundant in a large majority of roles in EVE.***
---
If the majority had them -- but most in EVE do not have supercapital umbrellas.
---
There's a biased approach to "defining a problem", small gang PVPers and WHers engage against large null sec organizations and believe that's what's wrong with the game. While inherently pushing for more changes against such orgs, the bulk of EVE aren't part of that bloc and are in small to medium groups.
---
My point is this, there's millions of other topics you can make edgy jokes about that don't involve Hitler or Nazi symbolism.
---
May I suggest having sex with dead babies, for example?
---
I don't understand everyone saying how OP titans, supers, carriers and rorqs are.  They wouldn't be so OP if there wasn't the ability to feed a 1 day old character skill injectors to be able to use them in the first place.  Yes, SS fighters are dumb (SS in general is horrible and boring) and tracking on Titans is broken.  But as far as AOE doomsdays go,  I haven't been on one fleet that has been bosoned or lanced to death.  The last time someone tried to boson a fleet I was on they ended up missing and wiping out their own subcaps on gate.
---
This was the point of my comment. He sounds like a compete cunt. I respond like him and he calls me a dick lol.
---
you are getting the deposit you payed when placing it, as in more than its worth
---
Fuck off Jintaan, caps are fine.
---
Because it makes literally no sense, we're talking about capital warship being hundreds or even thousands of times bigger than a dictor or interceptor. 
---
Capitals should take effort and skill to hold in place, not some newbie who can sticks a single disruptor on, right clicks, orbits at 5km/sec and goes to get a coffee. 
---
No-one would ever seriously develop a warship that didn't have the ability to defend itself against a small number of smaller threats.
---
Great thread. Add a spool up to cynos and I think this would go a long way to balancing the game.
---
yes its all fake news right
---
HAW guns on titans bad idea*. I dont think anyone has an issue with HAW dreads.
---
Yeah, it's absolutely insane.  The idea of 'fun' for many members of large nullsec alliances is to sit their titans on gates they expect small groups of destroyers/frigs to come through and try to catch them with a boson.
---
At first you might think it's just goons or something, but no - even fucking Brave does this regularly now.
---
When it says your not in the system it doesn't mean your charachter dumb ass. It means the selected system is not the same.
---
You dont need to be in a system to update it.
---
&gt; Can you point to a single example of a modern warship of any kind that was designed around other existing warships to provide fun and balanced fights that everyone involved would enjoy?
---
Sure.
---
https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Ship:Secondary_Armament
---
Pure PVP, according to Steamcharts, over 7 thousand playing at peak in the past 24 hours. That's massively more simultaneous combat than EVE.
---
Can’t tell if post is parodying cap umbrellas or not
---
&gt;I do not think that Carriers are that oppressive these days, but only because no one bothers to use them.
---
It feels wrong to say this, but that's basically correct.  The difference is stark from even just a year or so ago, when you'd see carriers dropped on gangs much more often.  Now it's just the straight-up 'fuck you' super/titan.
---
Hey great idea! I thought about doing something similar with Orca, but didn't figured out how to deal with it's lack of defence - couldn't carry anything too expensive or will be ganked eventually if in highsec; should use at least two additional accounts (scout and webber) if I want at least some safity when travelling low or null. Capital is a lot more handy in my use scenarios because of defence ability and jump drive. Definitely would push this way now. Thank you, you just gave me a goal.
---
Also I think you could improve it a bit: since you need a station to deploy anyway, you could carry one or two DSTs in your SMA and carry packaged ships or other stuff in their cargo. For example, Occator takes 390000m^2 of space, you can put packaged Raven inside and there would still be some space left.
---
That's a game, and a completely different one both is design and scope from EvE
---
I said it very often in the last year's of supercap meta. What we need is a cruiser / battlecruiser platform heavy bomber. T1 resist, small signature and agile with the role to fire super heavy torps and only that. For references check the citadels anti capital torpedo's.
---
The issue we have is that we have no tools for smaller groups to generate a real treat Vs supercap blobs. If we would have a platform that's about 150m isk and can dish out 80k volley torpdo only apply vs capitals ppl can't simply just bring 150titans and 100 fax. You would grind cheap trough those hulls even you lose 100 heavy bombers. Esp in the current Blackout meta you could never be sure if a fleet of them is not maybe waiting a system away. 
---
They need to be easy to kill by subcaps so you are forced and motivated to bring supercap fleets with your supers. The issue in my point of view is that No1 is afraid anymore to use their Scaps as the chance of bring saved by an umbrella is pretty high.
---
Remember when CCP removed Triage Carriers because they were a "shitty" mechanic?
---
And then they introduced FAXes a even shittier mechanic ? 
---
I remember :(
---
for #2. I feel like you could still transfer isk if you know your sell order is the lowest by using low volume cheap items. Why you would want to do this is beyond me (considering you can just give isk to them as a contact) and constantly "oopsing" seems obvious to track as rmt. 
---
Although, I have read stories about people who tried to trade to alt using the market just because they didn't know about give isk or contracts.

"My view is that caps should not be a one stop pwnmobile.
---
They shouldn't be able to tackle, web or ECM. They should have defined roles that cover either anti-structure (dreads) or anti-cap DPS (carriers) , or should be focused toward large scale fleet support boosting (titans)."
---
Aye but wtf am I supposed to do apart from watch the fight? I'd assume carriers would be nerfed to accommodate such a change. 
---
Also I'd need 35 guys with frigs per carrier to be effective
---
I made a topic about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cg85wr/a\_showerthought\_re\_carriers\_supercarriers\_etc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cg85wr/a_showerthought_re_carriers_supercarriers_etc/)

Have is the root VERB and is generally used alongside the PRONOUNS I / You / We / Ye and They and PLURAL NOUNS. Generally, have is a PRESENT TENSE word. Has is used alongside the PRONOUNS He / She / It and Who and SINGULAR NOUNS.
---
Not by **players**, they aren't.
---
Uhh... yeah of course it's a game... a game that receives significantly more balance passes than EVE does.
---
what just happened to you is considered by some to be a valid profession in EVE... enjoy
---
My point is that only being concerned with maximizing profits doesn't necessarily mean the game will be good or that it will be the EVE we've grown to love.
---
Honestly, carriers must aren’t that bad if it’s just one or two, the worst offenders for getting dropped are HAW dreads in my experience. Sure, you can move away from them when they’ve sieged but if you get hard scrammed and dropped you’re just dead, at least with carriers and super carriers you can affect the outcome with a small gang of 10 dudes, you don’t get that with HAW dreads as they laugh at your dps and apply insanely well out to ranges that most sub capital weapon systems have trouble hitting at.
---
That's why I suggested you can still use a carrier "the old way," it just won't be "as good."
---
In real life not even the USA has the ability to field full fleets of Supercarriers, cost plays a massive part in fleet comps so you try get as much utility as possible from each hull. This doesn’t apply to the big groups in EVE, the big fish can all field entire fleets of supers and replace them all several times. There needs to be some level of weekness in each shiptype or there would be no reason to even build anything that isn’t a super.
---
\&gt;  If he's in a carrier, he should be saved. 
---
As in, saved by rapid unscheduled disassembly?
---
Caring what other nerds think/feel is worse than any accelerating past grinding. If your corp can support whatever shiny things you want to fly, go for it.
---
For the vast majority of players, buying isk is the cheapest way to get it. 
---
Some people think that, like minerals, their time spent making isk is free.
---
Your dissenting view cannot be down voted any more... or it would be
---
And vulnerability windows
---
This came up in another thread, but how about a battleship variant that can fit cap guns the same way we have the battlecruisers that can fit battleship guns? I'd call them 'strategic bombers', but that's only so that I can make Supreme Commander references.
---
Great article, I would however like to present a different approach to FAX / Dreads. Instead of just doing a simple hard nerf, change the FAX back to what a Triage carrier of old was (without fighters etc. ofc). and then reimplement combat refitting as a rolebonus specific for dreads and faxes.
---
No they're op *and* it's insane that day but be characters can inject into them.
---
I've been on the receiving end of plenty of lances and bosons. Go take an AF gang through Delve if that's an experience you've been missing.
---
I was going to ask about bubblers but ofc supers can do that too now
---
Figures a goon would argue in favor of the current carriers.
---
Carriers are large ships with access to fancy drones, end of story.
---
That'd be pretty awesome. I just wanted to present changes that could be done right now, with no coding effort.
---
That's what I said as well
---
Yeah I cann confirm, you usually delete your toxic edgelord posts after they have been downvoted to oblivion either for their toxicity or stupidity ...
---
If you have less guys, you can fit bigger ships into the carrier. Like 2 battleships
---
You have to consider damage types and pve cruiser resists.
---
I've been playing Eve for just about a year and a half, and I'm one of those psychos who enjoys being a logi main. When I finally managed to get Logi V, I thought I had made it, after spending so much time in an Osprey and a Scythe, I was sure I was going to be relevant now. And it did work for a while, it still does for some fleet paradigms. But the number of fights where a FAX is taken over an entire logi wing has increased dramatically. It's oppressive to see how so much more useful a FAX is, in a subcap setting, in so many fleet concepts these days. It just feels like the floor to being relevant has gone up quite a bit. I don't know, maybe that's how it should be... but it still kinda sucks. I've always felt that feeling useless or irrelevant is the #1 killer of motivation to play a game, especially for newer players.
---
Yes and more. Some stories i´ve heard (not personally whitnessed, i haven´t played in a while) make it seem like this game has been drawing in a certain type of psychopath.
---
The point is, they don't currently have an effective weakness. Their guns and fighters can blap anything which might appear, and do so with massive DPS.
---
Removing their ability to damage subcaps completely is bad gameplay... so you get tackled by subcaps, are you meant to just tab out to another window and go and play league of legends or watch YouTube because there's literally nothing you can do to influence the situation?
---
It's part of the reason they made it so ECM always allows you to lock the person applying it... so you don't end up in a situation of "oh, well, guess i'll die".
---
That's terrible gameplay.
---
So with capitals, if instead you give them a CIWS that deals much, much less DPS, they still have *some* ability to influence the fight they're in, even if you completely remove their ability to use their primary weapons in it.
---
I know, in my situation Vespa is better, but I'm just curious about accuracy. 
---
Happy cake day
---
Uh... what? Who does it then? Some advanced AI that takes over when you launch fighters?
---
Buy cheap ships and get used to dying a lot first.
---
Is it frowned upon? By some people yes. Most people don't really care. Working an extra hour on your irl job is often better isk/h than most things you can do in game.
---
You should probably look into things that can make you money in game too though since funding a PvP career with real money can become very expensive once you get into more expensive things.
---
Goons are on the list tbh, with their PB-Renters PIBC.
---
Pretty sure the battle featured a back and a dagger
---
Anti-structure seems like such a shitty role, but then, in a world of damage caps, also one that I have a hard time seeing coming back anyway.
---
eh, can you play eve with just one monitor??
---
that does bring up something i forgot about , BoT had you pay a deposit to put them down in the first place , i doubt the renters are going to even see that isk back
---
He's being downvoted because he's decided anyone who's unhappy with capitals must be an elite small gang PVPer, and their opinions are worthless to him. Anything you say to him will be dismissed out of hand so it's not worth the effort.
---
For example he's completely blind to the effect supers are having on sov warfare. Goons rolled over dozens of systems without a single meaningful battle taking place because of the way supers and FAX are designed. Without capitals there'd have been a fight over every structure timer, because even outnumbered 3 to 1 you can put up a fight with subcaps. As happened with the highsec Azbel this week. Maybe the result would have been the same in the end, but everyone would have had a lot more fun in the process.
---
[in order to deal with Subcapitals, you should bring something that Subcapitals have a chance to kill ... This gives smaller groups a reasonable chance of making an impact.]
---
I don't think your assumption is right, big groups are not defined by having more capitals than smaller ones (thus being more sensible to capital nerfs), big groups just have more of everything. Right now throwing caps on everything is the meta, so they throw more caps than you can handle with a small group, but if you nerf capitals they will adapt to the new meta and still throw more than you in the new meta.
---
As always, interesting article, and from a subcap pilot point of view grrr capitals, but if we want them to be structures bashers, even more useless than dreads were, now that structures have DPS caps, investing the price of 6 ferox fleets in a titan won't make any sense.
---
So they don't pay you anything, you just get the deposit back.
---
Well, it depends on why you are doing it. If you are doing it to buy SP and fly blingy ships because they are "better", then you will likely end up regretting it. If you are doing it so you can say go learn and enjoy PvP (the classic example being whelping a bunch of T1 frigates in faction warfare) without needing to worry about the PvE side of the game, then it is a good option. Learning about PvE has value however. It can teach you some basic piloting skills, and unless you are going to regularly buy PLEX, you will eventually need to find a source of ISK. Also, if you hunt PvEr's, it helps to understand what they are doing and how they are doing it. This is most notable in hunting DED runners and hunting in WHs, but it applies to every area of space to a greater or lesser extent.
---
In theory, the better tracking should get you fewer glancing blows, and more penetrating/smashing hits. But usually using the correct drone for the resist holes of the rats is better.
---
No I mean the likelihood of a carrier under an umbrella being saved if it has a cyno and isn't some gimped +7% more Isk/hour ratting fit is proportionately higher than say a rattlesnake or a vexor.
---
the right questions is : what do I want to do with the ships? 
---
Providing this specification will make it easier for people to give advice.
---
Pepperidge farms remembers
---
Your fighters are piloted by \_you\_ -- as an extension of your will. That still, game-mechanically, is much the same as you launching and controlling your drones. 
---
That is a far cry from stuffing *players* into your ship and having *independent human beings at their separate computers* control the ships launched from your hangar bay.
---
You can fight outnumbered in subcaps because you've got tools like booshers, bombers, ewar, kiting, counter-comps and bubbles to level the playing field. Capitals are a problem because they're immune to all of that. You either bring more or you lose, end of story.
---
I've been on the receiving end of something like that. Jumped through a nullsec frig hole with a dozen Thrashers, and in about 10 minutes they dropped a Phoenix and a Ragnarok on the wormhole and started bosoning it every time they saw us. We jumped in and out a few times and managed to dodge the boson repeatedly (and somehow sniped a Noctis), but then when they also jumped in a Hel and hit NSA we decided there was nothing more we could do there.
---
Fuck this. Can't we just roll-back to 2012?
---
I still miss the days of Skynet, small gang low sec pirates in subcaps camping with fighter backup, and I'd setup  covert fleets to kill their capitals right off the edge of a POS. Those were fun engaging times, a small case study of how small gangs intuitively used capital weaponry and how other smaller groups made counters to them.   
---
There was a plethora of these capitals all over the map and pockets of null. These guys didn't care about null wars or how to engage them in elite pvp.
---
But there shouldn't be any way where a "smaller group" should be able to threaten a supercapital blob.
---
First, because if a smaller group can, a bigger can do it better. Imagine goons with the possibility of fielding one or two of these fleets, eh ? And second, because I don't know, why should you ? You're actually asking a major coalition to field three times your number count just to get rid of your nano bomber gang. Right.
---
I fail to see why the game should be balanced around "I am a small group I wanna fuck with the big boys but they have too many heavy assets and I get ass-raped, please nerf".
---
I do agree some of your changes make sense (especially the FAX scan Res), but you seems to be in a mindset of "If I bring subcaps they have to bring subcaps". When you break into someone's house with a bat, don't expect them to put away their guns and use a bat for fairness. They will shoot the life out of you most of the time.
---
Eve is an old game, powercreep was always going to be a problem, that was accelerated by injectors, and for a smaller part by rorquals. It doesn't mean your 20-men nanoshit gang should be able to roam around in Goon/TEST/Panfam space and force people to login a subcap account to force them out when they could just use their capitals before. You want fairness ? Bring your owns capitals, according to everyone on Reddit they are cheap and everywhere now.
---
Remember that capital owners want to USE them too, so you would be actually removing the only incentive to have them subscribed outside of major invasions.
---
and if the best you can come up with is calling my mom a whore I have to wonder if you have even made it out of high school yet.
---
Only I'm not, goodbye.
---
assuming they actually give you how much you were charged as a deposit.
---
That would depend on what the deposit is.
---
Yeah this is the main problem with capitals right now. They are all balanced around the fact that they are 'centerpieces' of the battlefield. Rare, and difficult to replace ships that are fielded in small numbers with sub-capital support making up the bulk of the fleet.
---
The reality is that right now, most coalitions in the game can field multiple 256 man titan and super fleets.
---
&gt;For example he's completely blind to the effect supers are having on sov warfare.
---
But why should the majority of EVE worry about your XYZ ihub at 1.0x ADM?  It wasn't supers that got your ihubs popping, you had nobody living in them, and Goons didn't win by supers -- they won because they had a better organization that allowed people to mine successfully. Supers is the after result. 
---
If the best weapon in the game was a shuttle, then Goons would have still won by sheer amount of shuttles.
---
Their success wasn't supers, or capitals, or titans -- it was people.
---
What do you expect when you attack them?
---
The good guys
---
Its called drag bubbles and smart bombing battle ships.
---
&gt;Goons rolled over dozens of systems without a single meaningful battle taking place because of the way supers and FAX are designed. 
---
\^ This is incorrect , theywere able to do that because they had 5:1 odds in numbers,  it didn't matter what they brought
---
But it's irrelevant to the point your trying to make. 
---
You can't try to justify things in a far far future spaceship game by pointing to things on boats that exist now and saying that's what they should have, then justifying it by pointing to a completely different style of game.
---
I get what you're trying to say about modern ships having multiple weapon systems, but if you try to justify spaceships balance in a game on real life you're going down the completely wrong path.
---
I'll give it to you with bombing and booshing... which is also widely agreed to be an OP mechanic. But nothing is easier to kite than a fleet anchored to the space by triage.
---
Read through paragraphs of misinformed Pyfa warrior whining until he suggested to just kill FAXes altogether and couldn’t go further.
---
I agree with this. A carrier should just be a fighter boat, dread a DPS farm, FAXs honestly should maybe only be links, with a MOM being FB/clone support, and the Titan just being that OHGODEPEENOHKO bridge.
---
It was more fun when half the galaxy didn't have a super either and even just having 500m was like 'awyusImRICH'
---
I think that is his workplace. I can't work with one monitor either tho so idk.
---
Yea. I agree. Ganking needs some serious buff!
---
Good point, thanks!
---
don't tell me what fun is acceptable or not
---
Nice podcast, enjoyed listening to it while driving to work. Keep it up!
---
Wood Industries for life!
---
The justification for the game is that capital weapons systems can currently all still apply far too well to subcapitals, and do so with outrageous DPS.
---
We ever don't want to be in a situation where a pilot has literally no ability to influence a fight, which is what we would have if application against subcaps was nerfed into oblivion or completely removed, and then a capital got tackled by a subcap fleet.
---
The answer is to be able to balance its ability to damage smaller subcaps, independently from its ability to damage larger ship. The solution to that is quite simple - two independent weapons systems, one significantly weaker than the other.
---
he isnt, he's just pointing out an observation
---
Yes.
---
Thats some 45 HG sets if im not mistaken. I think the shield slaves will be way over 3 bil in the first year. So that is a good 130-150 bil &gt;)
---
Or, the capitals are expected to be supported by a subcap fleet, rather than be the default ship of the line.
---
How about 2015 but with current fatigue mechanics?
---
&gt; Without capitals there'd have been a fight over every structure timer, because even outnumbered 3 to 1 you can put up a fight with subcaps. As happened with the highsec Azbel this week. Maybe the result would have been the same in the end, but everyone would have had a lot more fun in the process.
---
Or do you think NCPL was so poor that they wouldn't have been able to SRP some subcaps every few days?
---
same applies for subcaps fyi
---
woohoo
---
Christ, I'd love to just CTRL+A &gt; Delete force auxiliaries and give regular carriers their split role back.
---
That does not solve the problem of a pilot being unable to respond in any way.
---
Actually, I have. I have pointed out that there has not been an uptick in Rattlesnake deaths according to ZKill, even though your group falsely claims otherwise. ZKill has those numbers, but you guys are too scared to simply look at it, because you would be proven wrong.
---
Again, I'm all for Blackout, but stop attributing things to it which are simply not true.
---
I haven't even brought up, but now will, the "elation" mentioned in the OP. That happens quite often in Eve. Maybe if Waffles of old wasn't so bad they would have had that experience more towards the end. Plenty of folks did have it however. Plenty of folks still having fun killing stuff.
---
What I'm seeing since Waffles decided to return is a ton of posts by them and those that for some strange reason look up to the has beens and never was' that make up the group. And heaven forbid if you aren't a small gang player on your main, that makes you irrelevant 100% to speak of anything, because nothing else matters. Their circle jerk is quite hilarious. I mean, they haven't won a war since WWB, them deeming someone bad is just funny to me.  They will continue to spin their wheels for another few weeks until they all get tired of playing again, then will fuck off once again. I, and others like me, will continue to be around influencing the meta in ways they could only hope.
---
&gt;"If you want to deal with sub-capitals, you should bring your own sub-capitals or a carrier.”
---
Hmmm almost sounds like carriers were specifically designed to be good against subcapitals, guess we should keep nerfing them.
---
its not about SRP ships , they don't even want their structures on killboards so they xfer them out before they pop . No one is going to fight 5:1 odds at a massive scale
---
Yes plz
---
I'd prefer just to delete force aux to be honest, and give carriers their  split role back so that they could focus on EITHER anti-cap DPS or support, without mixing the two.
---
You are a smart man
---
&gt; This isn't correct. Plenty of posts tell people to grind irl, or do something other than rat because that isn't what the game is for, or any number of other idiotic statements.
---
And plenty of posts tell people to explore, or go to wormholes, or moon mine, or do incursions. Everyone has their preferred ways to make ISK.
---
&gt; There you go with the assumption any ratting or mining is AFK. It's not. Unless you think people AFK when they carrier rat, because they're desperate for ticks consisting of absolutely nothing minus the cost of their fighters.
---
You're putting words in my mouth, I never said all ratting and mining is AFK. I'm referring to the fact that unless you're either AFK or utterly smoothbrained, it's pretty easy to avoid getting dunked, whether or not there's a blackout. I've lost like 3 ratting ships ever, I was paying less than half attention for all of them.
---
&gt; And surely it's a "do whatever the you want" game? People act like being risk averse when you're ratting to pay your sub/ afford a new ship/ fund PvP is a bad thing.
---
Being risk averse is fine. Supporting mechanics which are killing the engagement of the game and causing it to hemorrhage subs is bad. As I said in my original reply, I have no problem with ratters or miners, without them I wouldn't be able to buy ships to fly and I wouldn't be able to sell the things I make. I have an issue with people defending awful mechanics.
---
&gt; But also have no problem with someone who never undocks and station trades with bots all day.
---
I have an issue with anyone who uses bots for anything in Eve.
---
&gt; What about the incessant crying about supers being used to kill roaming fleets, when the roaming fleets use T3C's to kill lone mining barges or vexors?
---
I agree that using T3Cs to kill barges/vexors is cancer, but it's about all you can do under a super umbrella. I'd much rather poke your ratters/miners to fight your home defense fleet, I like to PvP against people who want to PvP.
---
captain please ?
---
imo capitals and supercapitals ought to be supremely rare and supremely powerful. Let them lay waste to all that come before them, but make them so expensive and require such logistics and maintenance that just *owning* one is an effort, and deploying it even moreso.
---
The statement that having costs and no profits equals a quality game is nonsense. Those devs, GMs, AT tourneys, etc need jobs. Those jobs are on the backs of the majority of EVE: "carebears". There's different shades of carebears, from high sec to null sec, but previous data has shown the more you migrate those isolated high sec carebears into communities (e.g. null, WH, low), they stay and play longer, paying for costs and jobs. CCP cannot afford to piss them off so that they can please the small gangs and random hunters. 
---
At some point, the "free SP login every day" will no longer translate to real dollars when these guys aren't given a balance of reward vs risk.
---
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎
---
Did you use official "eve character bazaar"? If not its GG for u.
---
Go play stellaris
---
Move cap logi to a BS that can fit cap reps?
---
I see current T2 logi being effective, but not impossible to kill. I feel if a cap ship has logi, the only way to whelp it is to drop the kitchen sink. Logi, while still needing to be effective and present, needs to not be an unkillable brick. Even with carriers, I can see it happening (but not as bad as a fax, so either way it's a win eh)
---
yes official bazaar
---
&gt;2hrs prior to dt
---
So they can ransom other players with ties?
---
If you're shooting rats just shoot the rat's resist hole.
---
This man needs a gold star
---
Keep the 3D models for future ships though. Say what you would like about FAXes but the in game model is really nice
---
I agree.
---
Capitals are bad for three reasons:
---
1) They are the most powerful ships in the game
---
2) They can teleport 
---
3) They can kill anything smaller than them
---
Fixing this would be easy:
---
1) Nerf the broken mechanics as above to prevent the ability to kill subcaps.
---
2) Counterplay to cyno mechanics.  This can be done in a variety of ways but my favorites are: scrams prevent and cancel cynos, cyno jam bubble for interdictors, and jump drive spool up time.
---
and make them able to refit with weapons timer? 
---
yes plz daddy.
---
I don't think Capitals shouldn't be able to be used vs Subcapitals. I don't think they should be able to be used vs Subcapitals, *without support*. I think encouraging sub vs sub content is generally good for the game but I also recognise that as you say, people want to use their toys, but there also needs to be a place for lower SP pilots to be useful in those sorts of fights. It's my perspective right now, as someone who was until recently a big part of the big boys that that dynamic is broken, and people like Sort Dragon, The Mittani, Elise Randolph, etc have agreed with me on this point.
---
Alternative ideas for the same issues.
---
* Increase fighter MWD cooldown to 4 minutes. Now supers are still strong but subcaps have easy counterplay.  
---
* Significantly increase the sig radius of all capitals, reduce tracking of capital guns, significantly reduce the scan res bonus of fax.
---
Hell no. Figure out what made them overpay you that time, then figure out how to do it again!
---
This is part of the reason why CCP changed the tracking number to something called Weapon Accuracy Score.
---
Berskerer:  0.71 tracking, but 400m 'target signature'.  
---
Vespa: 0.65 tracking, 125m 'target signature'.  
---
The vespa is technically ~3 times better tracking.  This is how all the medium drones out track the heavy drones.
---
Guns used to work like this too, but were unified.
---
Oh, thank you!
---
For the love of god do it then please!
---
Please undo one of the most cancerous, fun destroying, clearly not thought through decisions in CCP history
---
That is FW space. Not Low Sec in general. There is some high krabbing space in LS too.
---
HAW in general is crap. Dreads should apply to structures and supers, and carriers and other dreads with tracking assistance. Dreads are siege machines so why can they delete cruisers?
---
That s a blue donut right there for you.
---
* Reduce NPC bounties by 50%.  Increase the reward of ESSes to compensate.  This should create more opportunities for small gang gameplay.
---
I cant help but laugh at people defending caps and blue donuts.
---
If you force away all the small scale pvpers via dumb changes and allow everyone to krab in perfect safety than Eve would have died 5 years ago due to rampant inflation. something something China. 
---
But I guess you dont care as long as you can make enough shekels for your 7th super alt so you can make shekels even faster. 
---
They will just rot in your wallet anyway since you only lose ships if you get primaried and your logi is busy whoring on the primary.
---
They were/are. But with any game, the longer the game goes on the more frequent the presence of 'end game's powerful items become available. More time means more capitals available and more pilots capable of flying them.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/6Q68EBS](https://imgur.com/a/6Q68EBS)
---
Hm, fair point, but HAW dreads aren't siege machines just like RLML Cerbs have a totally different role to HAM Cerbs. Having said that, I do think HAW dreads diminish the role of (non-super) carriers quite a bit.
---
yep it's 'just an observation'
---
love this statement!
---
I would ask any X thousands char collation to do more than just bring the I win button (200 titans) with zero risk except some1 brings 300 titans. Btw I'm part of those meta coalitions and I still advocate for tools to counter Titan meta on any scale. Eve is based on rock paper scissors any meta has its counter and if not it gets usually changed after 6-12 months. Esp titans are out of that scope. Overall the issue is deeper than just bringing those Titan numbers. It starts on the availability. Building a Titan in 28 days is just a bad joke. It desperately needs to be tuned back to 3 months.
---
Link the thread of the character you bought
---
Bombing runs require a lot more effort than bosons. Take it from someone who's done a fair amount of both.
---
official the ccp wil fix it
---
&gt;and the inherent drudgery in the Entosis sov system
---
Mostly entosis just needs a better interface.  The absolute worst part of entosis is trying to maintain intel on all the nodes.  This is usually over voice, which doesn't work and is incredibly painful to listen to.
---
Look at fog of war as it's implemented in Starcraft or MOBAs.  Vision/intelligence is shared between all members of the same team.  Entosis would be well served with a similar UI, where you can see the status (or last status) of all nodes that your fleet can see.
---
They've been doing shit like this since Titans could Doomsday AoE through a cyno. Bored players are gonna do amusing things.
---
Valid concerns. A reconfigured carrier in a "carry players configuration" should have some means to feel like they are meaningfully contributing to the fight even while its carried craft do the heavy lifting! I'm sure something could be done ... I'll give it some thought.
---
Interesting article Jin, but you've not covered the fact of why these problems exist. Skill injectors.
---
You've heard of Freighters, you know and love Jump Freighters; but are you ready for JUNK Freighters? Formerly FAXes, this wonderful new class of logistics capital posseses a Junk Hangar, into which only items with a Jita sell price below 1 million ISK may be placed! Coming August 2019

I'm using the Linux bundle from [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Installing_EVE_on_Linux), but it seems to work great, so I don't think this is related.
---
serious question: why would you want to go to lowsec after living in null?
---
Nobody is saying costs and no profit means a quality game...
---
What's wrong with you?
---
and some gilas ?
---
So many people don't get this. As a member of PH I play the anti goon tune... But in all honesty the effectiveness of their setup is ridiculously powerful. They have created a safe environment through sheer numbers and as long as they keep it safe their players continue to feed the materials and idk to keep mass producing capitals. No matter how things are changed, goons will continue to win through sheer application of numbers.
---
Groups with more numbers will always have a numbers advantage, it's not about that. It's about ship variation and not having an I win button, the old 1 up 1 down made for way more fun, if you were one ship type up you would annihilate your opponent, but if you were 2 above you would struggle to hit them, doesn't mean they can kill you, but they can still get out of the fight easily.
---
It forces people to bring a fleet that can actually be defended against, if you go to big you would just end the fight and get nothing.
---
Not even close, but ok.
---
There's also the human factor that adds up to this. See, for me it would be easy to drop a super on a nano cruiser gang or a lone roaming frigate, but I choose not to do so . If I think that I stand a chance in a sub-capital against it , I choose that option for various reasons, but that's just me... 
---
Yes, supercapital proliferation is real, but it's also the way and circumstances players choose to use them.
---
Now the F1 monkey-krab hybrid has his titan, and since his spodbrain can't figure out how to fight a lone Kestrel with a frigate (which he probably forgot to inject) , he brings his titan to the fight knowing that in case shit hits the fan, the super umbrella is there to save him ...
---
&gt;specifically designed to be good against 90% of the ships in the game
---
Yeah, seems fine.
---
You're not wrong, but there's a precisely 0% chance CCP gives up that stream of income.
---
&gt;So many people don't get this.
---
You are an honest thinker.
---

Try different things, figure out what's fun.    Note that you can try things out without being perfectly skilled; there's a reason t1 ships and modules exist.
---
Nullsec can get boring after a while, some people like a change of scenery. 
---
Lowsec focuses more on smaller scale stuff, has a more varied assortment of players, etc. Also you can find actual 1v1s more often.
---
Keep REEing the good REE dude, you have far more patience and grit than I do when it comes to asking for changes.
---
From my experience: try everything (mining, explo, ratting, pvp, trade, PI, industry,...) but do it "seriously: search what it is and how to start, and try it.
---
 If you like it, cool; if you don't check something else. Once you find what you like, invest more seriously in it. That mean more advanced research, spending more isk on the fit and maybe joining a specialized corporation.
---
Once my magic 14 were 3-4, I started training skills required for what I like (3 for secondary skills, 4 for important skills and maybe 5 for a couple of core skills). Then I started to train the 14 to 5 (only 50ish days until the end now, yay!).

* I write articles about broken mechanics or faulty gameplay as well. Some others too and the response is mostly in the form of dislike or hate on reddit. And i realize that EVE has changed and with it the player base has changed.If you complain about Support Fighters broken mechanics and CCP announces that they will consider some changes 10x more complains will come not to change them. Because this is today's EVE players base. The like to PVE, Mine, get titan alts and Boson friates on gates. Generating content is harder and harder and they cannot invision the creation of it so they migrate into big superclusters of people thinking there will be actiity and super content there, but they dont realize that they kill the content even more with this.   
---
* The lack of response from CCP bothers me even more then anything. The fact they will never say "Ok we fucked up with citadels, ok we fucked up with Injectors, OK we fucked up with FW, OK we fucked up by allowing 3-4k titans in game, etc. This bothers me the most. The reason they dont do this is because you and me are on the edge of extinction. And most of EVE player base is ok with current mechanics becuse if they just 10 caps on 5 man roaming fleet once in a while and PVE the rest they are happy.
---
Read your original response, it is exactly what you are saying. You said profits with no quantification and dealt with absolutes. So what is the acceptable level of profit for you with your knowledge of internal cost structures of CCP to where it translates to a quality game?
---
Boson needs two ticks to kill you, so two Titans with high skills not just one.
---
Did you pay the character transfer fee to CCP and have CCP initiate the transfer to your account?
---
I too play Stellaris.
---
Instead of nerfing the rep module and buffing dreads, it seems easier to me to nerf the triage bonus. About the same outcome, though.
---
Before balance any ship... fix plex... ow wait that would hurt a certain companies wallet.. The ability to legally RMT your way into anything, buy plex from CCP and sell it on the market is broken in conjunction with Skill extraction / injection.
---
Second fix skill injectors, people wallet warrior to get their toons into a certain ship (ea titan, super, rorqual)
---
Third Caps aren't OP, especially after the last balance patch... Look at Goku /  Stuka / Bombersbar fleets and what their targets are. Look at big wormhole groups like Inner hell.
---
Hint Caps die very very frequent.... 
---
Fax's have been nerfed twice in the last two balance patches..  
---
Fourth If you are affraid of caps / supers dropping on your head in Sov / Npc Null, there are things called Lowsec and Faction Warfare.. To those saying it's dead, maybe it's time to stop wasting time in Nullsec and start repopulating those regions.
---
Are you guys compensating skillpoints for future nerfs?
---
Or is where a plan to adapt trainingtime for capitals once changes are made?
---
Honestly, I would like capitals to be the AOE support platforms that this game lacks. FAXes glorified command ships, carriers fighter and AoE bombing platforms, and Dreads siege cannons. 
---
Supercaps should focus more on supporting friendly fleet either by buffing friendly fleet or nerfing enemy fleets. Make supercarriers force projector users first and foremost, with highly nerfed DPS against subcaps. Make Titans the capital destroyers they always are, instead of the counter to everything they currently is. Maybe make Titan or Supercarriers dockable in a siege mode. Battleships or cruisers meanwhile would be the main battle force.
---
Honestly, I really think that capital ships in EVE are just bigger versions of regular ships: they do damage and tank damage. That's why bigger is better and caps&gt;subcaps. I am not sure if it would work perfectly, but if caps are (mostly) pure support platforms with diminishing returns, I would think alliances will be less enthusiastic about fielding a shit ton of caps.
---
Frigates are good against 100% of the ships in the game, just need to bring more than 1. Personally taken taken down supers in frigate fleets. What's your point?
---
When was the last time you saw ecm fighters being used? I can't even remember how they called and that's saying something. I do remember that if you even think about using ecm fighters, you should stop and instead use cenobites that are equivalent of a heavy neut (by gj/s) but with a 6 second cycle.  
---
Being honest ccp should just delete ewar fighter line if they ever going to think changing dromi webs to TP and turning Sirens into sensor dampening fighters (lol), because everyone is going to switch to cenobites, and cap warfare is almost oppressive as webs are, some months after ccp will change them into TD fighters and the whole line will be abandoned. Speaking of abandoned lines... can anyone find me some combat ceptors? Oh nevermind, I can buy one in Jita for like 10 mil now.
---
Replace Junk with Corpse and I can totally see it will sell well
---
o7
---
Great video, man! Also props to have balls. I will be happy to fight against you, may be not with magus :)
---
We had a fight yesterday in initiative space where we tackled a barghest and drake, they cyno'd in an Apostle. With 5 of us in dps ships, we could not break the reps of the apostle against a shield drake with no shield. Drake armor is only like 4.8k. Eventually they brought more stuff on grid and we were able to keep redirecting and splitting reps and got the drake, but it was pretty dumb seeing how a non-armor ship was getting armor rep'd and ignoring our damage.
---
FAX are dumb, it also doesn't help that they can just appear in seconds from a cyno and can't be directly countered or stopped by subcaps like subcap logi can be (EWAR), short of just dread bombing them.
---
If he is the buyer then he does not do that.
---
reminds me of a similar thing in RL, when a kid foudn a bag with 12000 $ and turned it in at the police station. the top comment was "GOD, PLEASE, i hope my kids arent that stupid."
---
enjoy the money, dont look back.
---
Anything is good against anything if you blob it, what's your point? 
---
Bring frigates against an equal number of RLML anythings and you'll get wrecked, because frigates are very bad against RLML anythings.
---
yes
---
Buying PLEX and selling them supports the players who grind for subs, keeping the player count up. Buy away!
---
The problem is in real life a carrier can't be staffed by one person. There is something wrong with one person having a tool that negates 200 other people, especially if it doesn't cost at least 200x more.
---
AOE Doomsdays absolutely have to go, but take them away first before you remove HAW's from Titans. See what impact it has before you double dip nerf them.   
---
If they are still too oppressive, then lets ditch haws as well or at least look at a titan siege module so they operate like a big dreadnaught and are vulnerable.
---
You wouldn't have over 3000 titans in the game  if they didn't allow every Tom, Dick, and Jane to insta-skill into them (yeah you too / CEO).  CCP created skill injectors to help bridge the gap between someone that has been playing for a long time versus the new guy on the streets.  It was meant to allow YOU the player to convince a friend or acquaintance to play and allow them to fly similar things you do.  The sheer allure and greed of people should have been a serious consideration.  Was there a think tank? Probably.  Did they ask how can i abuse this asset, sure.  How could this impact the game after years of unchecked usage, fuck if I know we're about to get PAAAIIIIDDDDDDDD.  Where is the check and balance for Skill Injector usage? I'm reading this post and it keys into a problem sure, CAPS are the go to however this is the exception not the standard.  Its the easy I win button, I can't make it halfway down a pipe in Delve with a battleship before some fellow fuck-tard has dropped their titan or super and ganked the target.  This problem wasn't caused by the super carrier, its not caused by the pilot risking their capital.  This was caused by a lack of control on a bigger game changing asset.  That's right Bob you guessed it, THE FUCKING SKILL INJECTOR.  You want these capital changes? Take that shit to Lowsec, you want small gang content? Fly your ass over to Tama and go nuts.  How about you try to help groups facilitate the usage of lowesec and breathe life back into it, you're a fan so subscribe.  You're coming out to Null, the main event of the game, expecting lowsec content and then have the audacity to get mad when we drop fucking HBO Game of Thrones on you?  Are you serious? Is Nullsec not no mans land? Is it not the the wild wild west? You want a structured game play where you can have that David versus Goliath shit you take your happy ass highsec.  You want to risk it all, you want to wear those big ass cojones you're talking about being a CSM? Then you strap your ass in and ride the fucking lightning!
---
Probably. Pricier side though.
---
As someone who’s also done a lot of both, I wholeheartedly disagree. If bombing runs are difficult for you, you’re not understanding how the system works.
---
No? Why would they do that when it's never been done before?
---
I never even said chasing profits was wrong.
---
My point was that profits alone are not necessarily a valid metric as to success, especially when it comes to something like game design.
---
Because a lot of people seem to be pointing to profit based metrics as the sole determining factor to if X change is good for the health of the game.
---
My argument, if you pay attention, is very CLEARLY that profit is not a metric whatsoever in if the game is actually good or satisfies the player base, Waterville when the argument is related simply to short term profits over long term goals.
---
No amount of money spent or money earned will make a game good.
---
That was a rare event though
---
So is eve also a stupid tax then?
---
They were. And it was a stupid idea from the get-go.
---
For my point, I'll quote all the fans of the Blackout and apply it to carriers: Adapt or die, Git Gud, L2P.
---
To succeed in eve you need some sort of income (ingame or out of game). Then you need to have fun, that varies alot between players, but I can tell you how I play the game.
---
I am a linemember of Pandemic Horde that run two accounts (soon three), I enjoy explosions in fleets. So I make sure to show up to the announced ones and I am a member of a couple of SIGs (special interest groups), for fleets I fly logistics cruisers (all variants) and stealth bombers (all variants). To pay for this I have alot of options thanks to being a part of a major nullbloc. The activities that suit me best are mining in fleets (the fun is in the coms), I make good isk moonmining and we often get surprize content (which I also enjoy), when there arent any moons and I am in a pve mood I dabble in industry and run abyssals.
---
All in all I enjoy all parts of my gameplay in eve.
---
Everything I do in eve apart from stealthbombers  is possible to do on a week old character. Logistics (bantam into osprey into basilisk), mining (venture into procurer(where I am at) into rorq), abyssals (kestrel into CN comet(?) into hawk), industry (start with t1 from bpc, and do the math/market research). And all I do is easily done with only one account.
---
Dont fly what you cant afford to loose. If you cant afford to loose it you cant afford to buy or fly it.
---
FT has hit the nail on the head here. The issue is the ridiculous EHP scaling. Even from a BS to a cap level it's stupid as a BS is a capital ship in every interpretation but CCP's apparently, but has something like 1/10th the EHP(can't remember the exact number off the top of my head). That EHP scaling needs a massive nerf batting 
---
The industrial side needs to be reconfigured, as well, so these ships take something more than just lots more of the exact same materials that a breacher takes to build. Just having to build cap parts isn't, wait a few weeks on assembly and run several rorquals isn't a strong enough curb.
---
I lived in Null 5 years ago, solo/small scale pvp was a thing. As well as pos bashing drake fleets..
---
The only advantage I see in low sec is that you have high chances to save your pod.
---
of course, thats the rental agreement
---
That's shifting power to the same people even more. Or away from anyone else.  I don't think that's the correct move.
---
Wow i think i usually do better with t4s. Thats rough.
---
Great, thanks for your contribution.
---
Spamming new tickets will **NOT** speed up the resolution process. Just wait for a reply from CCP
---
But they are still out the price of the structure. NCPL are stealing from their renters.
---
&gt; I, and others like me, will continue to be around influencing the meta in ways they could only hope.
---
Holy fucking delusion batman.
---
You realize this is a videogame right bud?
---
its more than the cost of the citadel. Its whole purpose is to make you not flip/sell the citadel to an enemy entity when leaving your rental agreement. That wouldn't work if the deposit was to small
---
Ah yes, the infamous high sec cap escalation.
---
Can you and Jintaan start a regular show or a podcast already
---
Getting the deposit back only works if they did not also pay for the structure. They should be getting cost of structure plus deposit back.
---
Which is why I left Malpais.
---
What's odesk
---
&gt; The reason they dont do this is because you and me are on the edge of extinction. And most of EVE player base is ok with current mechanics becuse if they just jump 10 caps on 5 man roaming fleet once in a while and PVE the rest they are happy. 
---
Touche !
---
Anything that gets people to undock and play the game is a reason to fight each other.
---
i wish i seen this post before i went on my rant about 6 minutes after you lol.

The Capital of any country is the centre piece why would ccp nerf caps that ppl trained and mined hard for??? End game = capitals just look at the ship tree in game proof of it like ofc it should kill anything its so expensive and takes tons of skillpoints to fly ur just jelly u dont have one pathetic space poor frigate pilot lmao
---
i got mine back, spin that as you want
---
It's not a scam if the buyer "willingly" decided to pay more.
---
You can either fit a mid slot Offensive or Defensive module, but only one of these. It can be reffited when docked. 
---
Offensive mod enables you to shoot anti-caps with anti-cap specific fighters or the usage of normal drones. The Defensive mod allows you to use support modules (links etc) but no use of the drone/fighter bay. For the sake of just dropping a link carrier you get a self-rep bonus and repping bonus to capitals.
---
Something like that?
---
projecting much?
---
Considering that Mittens went on a huge rant about how CCP is bad because Drifters and how in retaliation the Blue Donut is going to smash all the highsec market and manufacturing hubs because again, CCP and Drifters, I don't find this ironic.
---
Quite frankly, I don't give two shits what Nullsec does, as long as it doesn't involve them burning down my structures.  This is an inconvenience, yes, but I just need to make use of better bookmarks and dodge the gankers now.  What's old is new again and all that.
---
Agreed, with how structure warfare looks like now, it's probably the only kind of fight you usually don't want to bring caps to.
---
The CCP quote specifically referenced carriers as an Anti Subcap tool. In that regard they got nerfed so heavy that they got replaced by  HAW Dreads for that issue because you apply really bad, and Domis are quite easily removed from the grid . Nerf the fighter application  even more and its beyond comical. Imho Carriers should get Fighter Application Bonuses (Not supers) go give them their role back. 
---
Nerf HAW in general, or just remove it.
---
Why the Fighter App. Bonus for Carriers you ask? Because i cant see your clear escalation path anywhere.
---
People want: Caps and above basically not be able to apply pressure on Subcaps on Grid.
---
Then tell me please: where is the escalation path then?
---
I bring Subs, you bring subs. Then i "escalate" with Stuff which cannot hit yours? There is no reason anymore to escalate if we keep on that nerf caps plz path.
---
Carriers should apply to subs well imho, and then you also have your escalation path.
---
As you are very knowledgeable, pls enlighten me where my mistake is.
---
tldr, Damage Caps on Structures and no application from Caps to subs basically kills the escalation path from my point of view, but i probably miss sth.
---
In my 7 years on eve I’ve bought plex for Isk only once. And it was when it was still one item. And it helped me seed my endeavors early on.  It was worth it to me at the time. As most people will tell you though don’t do it and think it’ll make you any deadlier in the game.
---
Good idea, but as a defender you already have the advantage of jumpgates. So let's not do the covert cyno part.
---
Anything that can kite a capital fleet with FAX support can't do enough damage to kill anything, so it's a pointless exercise. Will only get you picked off by HAW or even XL guns and fighters. So for all intents and purposes a capital blob is immune to kiting too. 
---
The ewar immunity is the weirdest one. Even though supers have these powerful ewar projector things that could be great for adding a bit of strategy into capital fights, nope. Huge ewar resistance bonuses across the board, sorry.
---
I'd love to see faxes become a sort of Tech 1.5 freighter. They would be a freighter with much less passive EHP, but the ability to fit certain resist and local rep modules (Like a DST). That way players at the keyboard would be slightly more survivable if active, and equally dead to gankers if AFK.
---
Sure colour coding is great, buying said fuel ... I just have shittons of fuel in my fuelbay and refuel everytime I dock/undock.
---
So even transitioning between different empires is a nobrainer because I simply "rightclick - buy in market" and drag it into my fuelbay again.
---
I don't need to constantly look up wich fuel, just did it once and working from there.
---
I didn't say PVPers do this. I just pointed out that it can still result in PVP, like you shoot the bubbles and wait for an idiot local to get stuck in the bubbles, or for some folks to show up to try to stop you from killing all their t2 bubbles, or whatever. I agree shooting bubbles and waiting for dummies or a response fleet isn't great... but I mean... you were out roaming space pressing dscan and checking dotlan stats trying to find kills so it's not like you're above being bored in the hopes of finding a bit of excitement.
---
While capitals aren't well balanced at all (Faxes and titans especially), I feel the most annoying thing when roaming around and tackling stuff is the fact that almost every meaningful target (rorquals/carriers/supers and even orcas and pve battleships now) all fit a cyno and are bringing reinforcement immediately. What do you think about splitting regular cyno in two different modules: 
---
\- first one can be fitted to subs (same PG/CPU than the current module), it doesn't have any spool time but has mass limitations like wormhole (to be defined, i haven't thought about actual numbers yet). 
---
\- the second one would have much higher CPU/PG requirement which would make it only suitable for capitals and would require to gimp fitting a bit, it would have a short spool timer about the same time that the cyno inhib, but no mass limitations. 
---
It would certainly not solve the capital balancing problem as a whole but at least it would give gangs and gankers a bit of breathing room. Defenders would have to use new strategies to save their ratting/mining capitals thus slowing down their home defense fleet, i mean being forced to jump to a cyno beacon and having to warp a capital ship to a bubbled grid would seriously put sticks in the wheels of HD fleets.
---
I do see somebody that is crying a bit about caps super carrier and such are not even really a big issue they can be deal on maybe ways even with bomber or suka fleets the can take them down they already receive a nerf with the Fax nerf a few months ago
---
I use a web and a guidance comp to help apply to ships outside of web range instead of two webs, dunno if it makes a big impact. The rest is the same though.
---
I don't understand the point why dreads should get a role bonus to mitigate FAX nerfs. FAX can't rep a sieged dread
---
Am I bad at math, or would you need 50*0* Abaddons to break a 500k ehp/s tank, rather than 50?
---
Your 200IQ plan somehow forgot to mention how to use this thing
---
I've wanted to try and get into exploration, but I'm having a hard time finding fits for anything other than the Astero. I'll do some more digging here in a bit. I'll also look into pvp and see how I can go about doing that.
---
 Thanks for the advice!
---
If they would just be used for triage, it would be great to have them back. 
---
However it would also reintroduce wreckingball shenanigans. Though less broken with the refit changes.
---
Meh, just go mine some1 else's moon in highsec, same ores as in null.
---
They never removed a shipclass before...
---
The Stabber (altough shitty against other cruisers) is awesome to kill small groups of frigs. Use it in a similar web or strap a LASB on it and go full damage/tracking on the lows.
---
All those forgotten pornhub tabs.
---
Yeah I might start specializing in a few skills for Exploration and/or pvp, because they seem like things I might want to get into!
---
I think its all about perspective. 
---
FAX's need a good nerfing... Rorquals shouldn't be allowed unlimited mulitboxing... but I lets not nerf things into oblivion. 
---
These are just 2 glaring issues.
---
Sure give goons something else to abuse and make power creep worse
---
If the past couple months have been any guide...  
---
    CCP: Hold my beer...

You are right about one thing, you are not expert on capitals yet at least supers and titans. Reading some statements of that text i would say you are playing this game fir month, but since i know who you are im supprised by the amount of bs written.

What does the capital of a country as a centre do with ccpnerf? And your answer shows do don't have any glue at all. Go login your rorq alts and mine another titan. And why should be capitals the endgame only its the last ships you can skill in????  I hear the fear of oh noo my skill injected alt isn't that important anymore...
---
&gt;But nothing is easier to kite than a fleet anchored to the space by triage
---
Kite away, you're pissing isk down your guns because you ain't killing shit.
---
He meant 50k EHP/s not 500k EHP/s. 
---
Although you can almost get 80k EHP/s with 0 heat if you fit mindlink, Strong Exile and Hardshell.

Citadels, the blue donut and supers are our tank-mages.
---
Why? Eve was dying that year too.
---
At least with FAXes you can't switch between DPS platform and logistics platform on the go, without having to leave grid - keeping carriers and FAXes as separate hulls is arguably beneficial, because it keeps you commited to one role as long as you're on grid, therefore making it possible to punish bad decisions what to drop if you're prepared to do so. With old carriers it was fully possible to enter/exit triage and refit to suit the situation making carrier blob the one-cap-fits-all doctrine.
---
&gt; At some point organization should pay off
---
Then you have N+1 gameplay which is what makes the 'blue donut' not only possible but the pinnacle of achievement. If you want to make it so that it's small groups/empires fighting small groups/empires like it was in the past there needs to be a point where adding manpower to your project doesn't make it better.
---
Kite LR titans and carriers with triage on grid, poggers

"Don't fly what you can't afford to lose" means don't fly something that will send you back to running level 2 missions in a Caracal because you have nothing. I have enough money to fly my money making ship and replace it 3 times if needed. Everything else I can afford to lose no matter how expensive it is because I don't need that money for anything. Doesn't mean I don't care about losing it though.
---
Hello fellow logi bro o/
---
I miss the days of a full Guardian wing. Last big fleet I was on did as you said. Full fax support and maybe 5 guards for moral support. Some of the most fun I've had in EVE was being in a Guard during a large fight playing priest-whack-a-mole
---
They wouldn't actually remove it, just nerf them into garbage
---
that's snarky motivation if i've seen any.
---
Small gang or solo pvp in j space, I prefer kiting over brawling
---
Pretty depressing comment.
---
1. Your best bet is an Astero or a Confessor. The Astero can be a very tough little PvP frigate, and it gets scanning bonuses so you can make money while you're at it by refitting for exploration. It also uses drones so you can go without resupplying for extended periods (assuming your fit is armor rep and doesn't use cap charges). The Confessor, on the other hand, can fit combat probes, and uses laser weapons which also very rarely need to be reloaded. It's also the prettiest T3D by far. 
---
2. More or less everyone in Eve is a jerk in one way or another, so just shoot at anyone who passes by and chances are you'll be justified.
---
I skill inject into a myrm, does that make an issue for game balance? No, because battle cruisers are balanced. Capital, rorqs and titans only cause issues when skill injected because they exacerbate the already existing issue of these being unbalanced ships.
---
You can have a very cheap Heron fited for explo (My go-to heron costs 5M and do a goob job most of the time). I go through wormholes until I find a  calm null sec system, then I start looking for sites. A null relic site can have between 40M and 120M from my short experience (but it also depends of your region; not every null sec regions are worth it).  The next step for me was the buzzard: more efficient and safer but more expensive (40M for my fit)
---
I don't think Goons are the problem here. We declared war a month back because Eve-Mogul was helping NCPL and as far as I know we stopped attacking Eve-Mogul after a couple of days/week.

Wow, this is amazing.

Take my upvote dude ! Why isn't it already in the game ?!

You did well on the CSM Jintaan, you shouldn't be held responsible for CCP's failings or unwillingness to change.

Yeah I misstyped - It's 50k EHP/s

Damned AI
---
&gt; I bring Subs, you bring subs. Then i "escalate" with Stuff which cannot hit yours? There is no reason anymore to escalate if we keep on that nerf caps plz path.
---
If you have subs on grid, you have things which can help your capitals apply, and keep your opponents on grid.
---
Yes, it is. You masturbate over your space pixels, I influence people. You play your game, I'll play mine.
---
Good for "lazy" PvPers and bad for Lazy PvEers. Most of the things I've killed since blackout is random travelers who haven't learned how to not jump straight into gatecamps without seeing them in local first.

Ok that's slightly more reasonable. I knew FAXes were stronk but I didn't think they were *that* stronk lol.
---
BOT are in the process of scrapping the traditional rental model (where a Corp pays for exclusive use of a system) and are now adopting a monthly fee for corps (price variable depending on number of alts in each Corp) and renters will be able to operate anywhere in Malpais and The Spire. The prices look pretty expensive to me, I heard the minimum price per month for a small Corp is 2.5 bill isk going up to 12 Billion or more for the biggest corps. 
---
The sov is being taken by the major alliances in Panfam so it’s easier to defend then sov held under the banner of a renter Corp. I think the renters are also allowed to join a ‘super umbrella’ fleet if they using something expensive to rat or mine in. 
---
Where this leaves the ‘Order66’ corps within BOT I have no idea. They were supposedly the ‘guard dogs’ for BOT space thus they got exclusive use of great systems rent free. However now they have to share systems with everybody else including PL/NC alts and casual renters. I see no reason why they would be expected to respond for ‘strat ops’ or ‘CTA’s’ that don’t include PL or NC in said fleets. In fact I don’t see a real role anymore for the ‘Order66’ corps within BOT. They may as well fold into NC/PL proper, move to PH or just start paying rent and avoid all the boring structure bashes they have to attend. 
---
Perhaps Lady Scarlet or somebody from ‘Order66’ leadership could expand on what I have written and point out any mistakes.
---
Just dodge the spears
---
BS:DR.
---
You can't just join. You have to do the stuff at the link.
---
Yes please. Change caps.
---
Subs are more fun, but are pretty far down the totem pole of desirability for fights that actually matter.
---
Evan McLean? Hahaha
---
I know, battleship warp speed/mobility and lock times seem hilariously bad compared to.... well pretty-much anything.  Why can a carrier or FAX lock like an inty?  Also jump drives.

I honestly miss massed battleship fights.

You share a jump bridge network that show for your timer and you for there timers in all respects you operate diplomatically as the same entity.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

You can get them to ~100k EHP/s with a blingy fit and proper boosts + Exile, but I knew people would shit on that as an edge case, despite having to personally fight that for 5 months during 2018.
---
Strikes me as pretty difficult to escalate with caps in hisec.
---
Fax change proposed would effectively kill high class wormhole brawls
---
Join a small gang group. They usually fly comps that rely solely on a single logi pilot. Much more intense and skilled setting
---
I'm pretty sure they've awarded skill points for needs or changes before?
---
\&gt; Null’s a completely different beast. The groups that last in nullsec are the ones that want to last. They want to endure. They want to build and maintain a presence, hold space. They’re thinking long-term.   
---
This is only half of the picture. The other half was the ability to kill a whole alliance, lean on and apply sufficient pressure which resulted in all sorts of leaks, drama, politics, out of control ego's and general weirdness. The stuff that would spawn 200 page kugu threads. That was the draw of nullsec, not literal-who-cares content like a rattlesnake gank in an anom or whatever breathtaking blackout content r/eve creams themselves over today.
---
Supers specifically and maybe. Do go on...
---
There are also gate guns in lowsec that will shoot people when they commit crimes.

Why would you want medium artillery in a small FW site to begin with?

&gt; ofc it should kill anything its so expensive and takes tons of skillpoints to fly

If something has no counter except "bring your own", then it's bad game design.
---
Goons are botters and Mittani knew it. Just look at period basis after blackout. Disgusting.
---
Perfectly fine, I do a few hours of overtime a month which I use the cash to buy a few plex. Better isk per hour than grinding in the game., and much higher fun per hour as I enjoy my job.
---
Remove all Capital and Super Capital vessels ability to fit and light cynos.
---
TIA.
---
&gt; Titans by sheer nature of being huge ships have a massive bonus to tracking. If you sit at what your overview will tell you is 0m on an Avatar, you’ll be somewhere between 9 and 13km away from it as far as the tracking formula is concerned, which drastically reduces your ability to use sigtanking against them. 
---
Sorry, i mean, of course maybe myself, and a HUGE number of the playerbase may have it wrong, and you are correct here, as i didnt wriight the code myself.
---
but im pretty sure the game calculates tracking's 'HIT' statistic based from the edge of the bubble, not the center of the bubble a ship is designated by, not the actual turret animation you pleb xD
---
Well that's Goons and PL with the active dec and can't attack a reinforced structure...
---
Let's see if it survives the timer exit.
---
I dont think aoe dd should be removed due to theyr use in ratting what if the dmg application changes with sig size in a way that would make it only apply well to capitals and bs with big sigs and for the boson instead of dealing 40k dps in omni having scripts for each  damage type and one that increases dmg application to smaller sigs while drastically reducing raw dps that take something like 5mins to reload to force the titan pilots to think about what theyr shooting instead of it just being a dumb fire weapon
---
Highsec should be safe?  Ain't you the comedian!  Highsec was never safe, tbh I feel safer in a wormhole than I do in Highsec.
---
The in game models are fucking awful.  They're way too large and they don't spin in station (a BIG part of the game for me).
---
if you take it so seriously have you made it out of cradle
---
Let me guess you wrote a ticket on Friday and are surprised nobody processed it over the weekend? Just chill and wait for a refund.
---
Why is it realistic for 5 ships to break capitol reps though?
---
Fw doesn't have rat battles, which is what this thread is proposing.
---
Supercaps also have a ridiculous increase in cost over capitals, so I don't think the EHP is unreasonable.
---
i mean, apostle can fit shield reps too tbh.... i know i have a shield repper in my own refits.
---
and pre FAX completly. before anyone complained a single carrier fit to be triage would of repped enough for you guys to not kill it. so im not sure this stands
---
&gt;If you force away all the small scale pvpers via dumb changes and allow everyone to krab in perfect safety than Eve would have died 5 years ago due to rampant inflation.

If you and Jin'taan had a baby, who would it be?

what do you suppose could be included into capital ship production that would not absolutly destroy somthing else in the game due to increased costs?

Christ i'd love to see motherships back as they were before you fucked up bigtime and made em supercarriers. &gt;\_&gt;

You're entirely wrong. That's exactly how it works. If you'd like to see a breakdown by CCP, here's [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/evecapitalfocusgroup/comments/4jvyy9/discussion_tracking_and_capitals/) that was made during the Capital Focus group, but in case you don't want to click through here's the most important big.
---
&gt;Capitals: Turrets
---
&gt;
---
&gt;With capitals we have a problem. They are big, really big. A titan's ball is 5-8km in radius. So when your orbiting at 10km in your cruiser trying to maintain maximum Transversal Velocity, your actually at 15-18km and are a lot easier to hit than you think. Its less of an issue with Dreads...but still something to be aware of.
---
I see a lot of issues with this. Honestly a lot of the above reads like you've not flown capitals yourself for a while...
---
Realistically carriers dont apply well to subs well enough to be a problem for most doctrines (cruiser and below) these days. Carriers are easily countered by enemy carriers with SS fighters from range (as are supers). 
---
Fax when used to support subcapitals ultimately force the enemy to commit caps to the field in order to kill the fax. The result is a fight for grid control (defensive bubbles, cyno inhibs etc). Personally i think this is an escalation path well worth maintaining. If your enemy drops a fax on you, you shouldnt be able to kill it with your 5 man BS gang. You  should have to commit to the field yourself also.
---
HAW dreads also work as force multipliers for smaller subcap fleets, but you have the same problem with the tanks on HAW dreads as you do FAX. Used correctly the combination of both allows a group of 30 dudes to fight 70 dudes if the larger group isn't prepared to drop dreads to shoot said fax/haws. 
---
TBH i'd consider a straight nerf to FAX RR to be extremely short sighted.
---
Titans work well since the nerfs to HAW damage and aren't solopwnmobiles any longer. AoE DD's are realistically only used in abundance in Delve so your comments on Boson's lack relevance outside of that context. Especially given that only bosons actually apply to subcaps and they have a very limited range, requiring decent positioning and in general at significant risk to the titan itself if the DD misses outside of a local super umbrella.
---
There are undoubtedly problems with capital balancing, there always have and always will be. But for the first time in a while i don't agree with your diagnosis of the problem and as a result find the proposed resolutions flawed at a base level.
---
(wrote this from my phone on lunch @ work, go easy lol)
---
You cannot get scammed buying through the character  bazaar
---
Curious what that would solve.  I mean, I'd imagine you'd have more room to tweak the balance with split hulls than with split roles (i.e., you don't have to worry about a nerf to triage ship EHP making the DPS carrier terrible, etc)?
---
Frigates are more fun to fly than carriers prove me wrong.

Eveeytime u make a new ticket you go to the end if the queue, dont spam tickets
---
Yeah. Capital gameplay in Eve has never been GOOD, or good for the game. The problem is, now they're everywhere, what the fuck do you do from a game design perspective? I honestly think the only way to do it is to rethink their role and focus on applying to each other / structures. Make them super focused on objective warfare, while allowing faster objective solutions at the same time so we don't have 500 hours of structure grind to take a constellation.
---
i was told (even by acknowledged pvp streamers etc etc. and im pretty sure eve uni also states this (not that this site is 100% i know)?
---
that the game takes the Angular Velocity, Sig Radius and Range into an equation (all of which can be seen on the overview) and decides whether hit or not.
---
and the game shows these figures dependant on how far from the edge of the bubble you are, not the center....
---
why would they not show the same information used to calculate in thier formula? this would mean two figures are tracked by the game but only show one. insanity.
---
Alpha ratting bots will be in myrms or domis, still with faction heavies. I think most afk player ratters will do the same, and/or ishtars.
---
The new VNI is going to be a close range bitchslap dispenser, those double tracking bonuses are MEAN.
---
I thought people would think this could be fun sorry.
---
It's from CCP_Larrikin, the person who was in charge of overseeing this cap re-balance, and he himself states the reason for this as;
---
&gt;The closer you are (the less distance) the higher your angular velocity. We work out this distance using Center to Center, so there is a limit on how close you can get. The radius of both ships. This is good. If we used Edge to Edge at 0km you'd have near infinite angular velocity. And given that the radius of most ships is pretty small, it works out well.
---
It's just how it be.
---
It's actually annoying, because afk/bot vnis are infinitely easier to grind through in a single assault frigate.
---
Solution may be very simple, let supers and tits be anti capital/supercapital vessels unable to lock subcaps, however so subcaps shouldnt be able to lock superclass vessels be it titan or supercarrier. I definetly agree with the support fighers fuckage.
---
Give faxes a capital remote armor report and an XL remote armor repper. Capital remote can only be used on caps, XL can be used on both. This allows rep power of faxes to subcaps to be balanced. You could also introduce a 3rd t2 battleship that will be logistics and use XL reppers.
---
You haven't been playing Eve very long?  Didn't PL used to teleport around the galaxy dropping Titans on anything that would move?  They used to do that to Goons back in their BoB incarnation, with a far worse system (remote Doomsdays).
---
So what's the problem with a Titan in an umbrella (being protected by hundreds of other players) sitting on a gate and bosoning an interceptor?
---
Nothing as far as I can see.

To do a bombing run, you need to coordinate 7 people in bombers with the same bomb type. You need to get a warp-in which is ~40km off a typically moving fleet, align, bomb, and get off the grid so that you don't all die to counter-fire. If your opponent has defender launchers your run will do approximately nothing.
---
To do a boson, you get one cyno alt, cyno just off a fleet (or get a warp in), and click twice. There's no counter play except dodging it.

Is that bad though? Right now you either have to alpha your target or  wait for the fax to mess up. There isn't much counter play. I find playing with logi cruisers is more fun but if your opponent brings a fax you also have to.
---
Have at it man and enjoy, just remember it hurts a lil more if you loose a ship or mods that costed you actual money.
---
A lot of them really just don't like fun, or risk. I'm guessing from your dialect you're an American, which is the timezone with the biggest pants-pissing fearmongering retard problem right now.
---
Better blue everyone, dock up, or just boson it.
---
People need to just get out there and blow up some spaceships.
---
Either the incorrect knowledge of how the tracking actually works in the game by the main guy would explain a hell of alot about some of the problems we have xD
---
or as stated this is insane to show this figure on the overview none of which is taken into the formula to calculate tracking. 
---
i mean, i thank you for this link, and i am checking it out now. but i will remain sceptical on this as ive had years of being taught other wise and have otherwise been proven these things.
---
and capital HAW guns last i checked im sure theyve changed since.
---
had super similar tracking to thier Battleship counterparts pre tracking bonuses etc etc. but a HAW dread still would hit a orbiting frig more often than a dread would ie: never
---
Yeah exactly.
---
Would be cool if they refund SP so people can think twice about investing it again or going for any subcapital.
---
The pure FEAR that exists among nullsec players even for a t1 frigate has no substitute.
---
I was thinking of a subcap fight with triage logis on one side, but anyways defanging carriers is just a matter of time and patience. ofc if you drop the supercap fleet on a subcap fleet well, the outcome should be evident.
---
Oh so the reason we don't have new Nullsec entities are because some Alliances chooses to constrict themselves in smaller areas and make use of their space and to protect it fiercely?  
---
Are you sure about that?  
---
Are you sure it isn't that some of the larger nullsec entities take up half of new eden nullsec and barely use the space? Killing off anything that tries to pop up and isn't defended by a large entity?  
---
No, no I'm sure you're right.
---
I have a solution for you though. How about... I don't know... you actually use your own expensive ships and destroy our expensive ships?  
---
Oh, you don't have enough expensive ships? Well boy are you lucky... I know how you solve that too. There's this thing called mining. It requires space to use but I'm sure you can find some.
---
Should a kiting subcap comp be able to break a capital fleet with capital reps though?
---
Being able to use actual ewar on supers/titans/caps would be amazeballs. The idea of an ewar wing full of noobs damping titans so they don't have dd lock range or it takes them an age to lock etc sounds amazing and would leave a lot more options for being able to take fights outnumbered.
---
Agree with both the premise of the article and the suggested fixes - though we could quibble about the % of changes.  That's not worth going into atm.  Overall the thought that a supercap could scram/web and kill say a malediction or anything smaller than a BC is crazy.  That Titans  can use HAW mods is crazy - a Titan with guns shouldn't be able to hit anything smaller than a BS unless it's sitting at 0 and in optimal, and even then should miss 50% of the time.  AoE should be removed and FAX were a mistake, most assuredly.   Make capitals fill the niche of killing structures and other capitals.  Make subcaps great again!  (Sorry I couldn't resist.  Incoming walk of shame.....)
---
Ewar shitadel?
---
&gt; anti-cap DPS (carriers) 
---
When was the last time you tired to kill another cap with less than 25 carriers
---
also needs more skill (not skillpoints)
---
The ability to deaggress and dock.
---
Yeah no sorry, it’s still not that harder to do a bombing run than actually boson a fleet and have it land. Most boson kills are on gates, which is what people complain about, but tick bombing a gate isn’t any harder than bosoning one.
---
Honestly, if you’re gonna argue that part of what makes a bombing run difficult is people having the wrong bomb types then maybe the issue is the people you play with and not game mechanics.
---
Why is it an effortless option to drop a fax on a 5 man sub gang?
---
Leave faxes ro rep  caps only
---
I hadn't seen that quote before but it may be the truest thing ever written.
---
I am someone who only ever flew T1 frigs. I still bought Plex for ISK because doing anything that isn't PvP is boring.
---
This is like fixing your house by setting it on fire.
---
solo would be very different from small gang, tbh. For solo work, none of them would to, in my opinion. Best I could reccomend is go battleship 4 and get a tempest. If you want to gank explorers get an astero.   
---
for small gang - go for the cane as dps, sfi as antitackle/all around ship. The SFI needs the rapid lights for anti tackle tho so idk if you wanna spec into that (you should tho). Get the recon ships to 4 and fly a huginn if you want, just to see how a loki would be flown (but with less dps and no cloak),
---
I agree with you on that premise - however if you've got a suitcase capital and you end up in a bubble you fucked up anyways. That should have never happened.
---
Then what’s the point of playing if adding more friends is not a thing. I just don’t understand what you want. They can beat me because their toys are better! They can beat me because they have more people!  If you balance a game around allowing a small number of people being able to kill something a larger group is going to take the same tools and use them then what will you complain about. Null security is supposed to be about empire building let people build an empire if you want to break that empire start one of your own and get organized.
---
Because capital ships shouldn't be solopwn mobiles. They should require a group to help. If you drop a carrier with the appropriate tackle subcaps, then you should be able to roast a gang. A carrier should not be able to fight a small gang of fast ships solo. It negates all other ship classes and we may as well delete subcaps from the game altogether, because what's the point of them?
---
A lone interceptor is of no threat to any capital? A lone interceptor can't even break the passive shield regen. So you've completely shot your whole argument in the foot, by saying that as he 100% needs friends to be of any risk to anyone.
---
You're just raging against capital changes because you realise that if you no longer have OP caps to achieve anything you're probably going to be dog shit at the game.
---
You can't balance ships via cost. It doesn't work. If a ship is wildly unbalanced, it doesn't matter how much it costs, it's still wildly unbalanced.
---
&gt;a HAW dread still would hit a orbiting frig more often than a dread would ie: never
---
I assume you've never watched [Lasker Emanuel](https://youtu.be/I6HQvXQ2PnU?t=274).
---
Is this 5000 words to say remove super capital ecm resistance?
---
Do you actually think that will matter?
---
Is ECM or a Damp or a TD going to stop all those boson kills, or the next DD vs DD broadside?
---
Sure its an a-symmetric or 'power multiplier', but this is also what the champions of these ships used to herald them as.
---
I thought local was going to save eve.  Now it's the new-bro in the frigate.  Think of the children!  In their disposable, sp-farmable, alt-referal, galaxy-seeding, wh-scouting, mission-pulling, bulk-job processing, totally-not-abuseable pathetic state.
---
Removing a power-multiplier or a-symetry mechanic, just makes the ships more of an n+1 ship, and more people flock to the blobs, with their n+1 holders strategically placed around the galaxy.
---
Meanwhile, wh space is still killing eve ever since 2012.
---
There used to be ... but buying PLEX with real money isn't a thing IMO.  I agree don't use the generated ISK to inject 30M SP - you'll just make an easy target.  Injectors were a mistake - but if you use them to just round up and take a few days off of getting into that juicy ship fine.  Use them too often and you're just giving pilots who have experience flying their ship an easy kill.
---
&gt; Honestly, if you’re gonna argue that part of what makes a bombing run difficult is people having the wrong bomb types then maybe the issue is the people you play with and not game mechanics.
---
If you think it's easier to coordinate 7 people than make the right plays yourself, then maybe the issue is you? /s
---
In all seriousness I don't think we disagree that much, tick bombing and bosoning are both pretty easy to pull off.
---
Just because something that was bad and broken before wasn’t fixed, doesn’t mean that something bad and broken now shouldn’t be.
---
Nice work.
---
You are confusing Faction Standing with Security Status. 
---
Podding fuckers in lowsec is a great way to get a negative Security. 
---
Podding fuckers in NPC corps hurts your faction standing, but doing the same for people in *player corps* doesn't hurt it at all.
---
You mean the risk averse dudes that sat tethered for the entirety of their citadel timer?
---
I approve of this. Want to launch fighters? Time to siege. Want to bosun? Time to siege. Want to do anything offensive in a capital? No reps for you until you're done.
---
What you are not understanding is, give a carrier 30k DPS for all I care. Let it apply perfectly to a small ship that has been appropriately tackled and slowed down. The point of Caps is force multipliers, to add massive DPS when they are sufficiently supported. They will still be able to wreck gangs, just require a bit more thought than cyno and F1.
---
ESSes being more viable would be nice, but ESSes would neat way more tweaks than just that if you wanted them to facilitate fun gameplay, given the way they're anchored today.
---
&gt; If you don't think there is a reason to be concerned about spies then you haven't scratched the surface.
---
if you think there is youre still in 2009 bra
---
ive watched, faught, and done lasker's dread stuff. ive also tackled enough dreads and battleships in dessies n frigs to know xD
---
by the way,
---
No where on your link does it state guns calculate angular velocity from the center -&gt; edge of ships bubbles. it talks about different ways of doing so, and confirms how falloff is worked out, but it does not state center to center or center to edge is used at all.
---
He only states that due to having a larger orbit diameter you are easier to track. in real worlds this would decrease your angle changes and this would be correct. 
---
but the game only uses angular velocity and range (edge to edge) and finally sig.
---
Sig as he states we can ignore as this does not change on the targetted ship in any example.
---
but the wider your orbit, the faster you go. faster you go the higher your angular velocity. and your range at this increased speed is still only 500-1000meters.
---
@jin did you actually read this article? a brilliant unfinished article as most CCP things xD
---
Where is this "fight" you speak of? All I can see for 40 jumps are blues and defeated cowards
---
imo Jintonia, also probably should be the name of a new region in game
---
Yeah. I've seen a drop in botting, though mostly specific TZs. They don't look as suspicious if they only run 12 or so hours a day, and at least Frat doesn't really want to bother with USTZ. Detorid is basically TEST space in USTZ lol. Dock up the bots or they just autofeed.
---
Right? If you can trade for dictors / scrams you might be able to save that blingy ratting ship.
---
Or he's a bot and you just awox his ass.
---
Yes, I'm American. But, to be fair, we're great at fearmongering
---
Stop tempting me
---
With two fleets of standard fax and carrier support as well.
---
It’s very possible to kill caps with small groups, they die every day. What I think you want is to be able to roll into some ones empire and for there to be very little people can do about it. Local is gone and more people will be using capitals as that’s what can be saved by response fleets. I just don’t understand the thinking behind all these posts if capitals are so strong why don’t you use them as well? You have the exact same tools everyone else has.
---
That would be more of a nerf to the attackers than the defenders.
---
What problem does that solve, though?
---
I just can't think of something that solves that rebalancing either hulls doesn't.  And it's easier to balance the hulls separately rather than trying to "fix" the support role without killing the dps role, etc.
---
because the drifters were aids
---
Delete FAX. Bring back Triage Carriers.  
---
Reduce Capital Rep Base Number to practically nothing, and make the Triage bonus bigger.  
---
This was all that was needed to fix the slowcat problem.  Faxes are worse than slowcats ever were.
---
The highest WTR ship in the fucking game before the Ikitursa came out, and much, much cheaper.
---
I need to just start flying these stupid things, they're too broken not to.
---
&gt;Oh so the reason we don't have new Nullsec entities are because some Alliances chooses to constrict themselves in smaller areas and make use of their space and to protect it fiercely?  
---
&gt;Are you sure it isn't that some of the larger nullsec entities take up half of new eden nullsec and barely use the space? Killing off anything that tries to pop up and isn't defended by a large entity?
---
It's a consequence with multiple contributing causes which play into each other. 
---
The strength of supercap umbrellas encourages people to join alliances and coalitions which have them, which ends up with lots of 'pet' alliances rather than independent alliances, cowering under a coalition supercap umbrella.
---
In turn, this means that all the pets have their own little patch of land which the coalition will protect, which means that smaller groups can't take decent amounts of sov in which to safely mine their own supercap umbrellas.
---
&gt;I have a solution for you though. How about... I don't know... you actually use your own expensive ships and destroy our expensive ships?
---
You're never going to see another B-R or X47. The reality is that one side is about 60-65% of nullsec titans and growing, and the other side isn't stupid enough to suicide its supercaps. It was exactly the same in WWB and Goons weren't stupid enough to suicide them either.
---
&gt;There's this thing called mining. It requires space to use but I'm sure you can find some.
---
Yes, fortunately I can. That doesn't help the smaller alliances we were talking about, whose only hope of getting any space they can safely mine in is renting or sucking up to a major nullbloc and becoming identity-less pet #93.
---
This so much. Where is the “fun” in having a spawn that insta locks and deletes anything smaller than a cap. Just forces people into caps and then we have the posts about capitals online.
---
Yeah if you didnt know wormhole fax piloting is probably the most intense, mechanically difficult and lauded role in the game. It is incredibly easy to fuck up, especially in the age of leshaks. Without a fax, the big fleets we see from groups like hawks, hk, nv, afk, mcav and (sometimes) tdsin would effectively be able to alpha subs off grid as sub logi is basically rendered useless. Not to mention the insane amount of ewar these groups could bring, effectively damping, neuting and jamming your poor basi/guardian wing to death.I do agree small fights with subcap logi are fun, but in the big boy fights, essentially uselss.
---
There are no plans to make these changes, it's just me talking shop and thinking about ideas - I don't work in game design ;)
---
Yeah absolutely, get some frig skills and T2 small guns, along with your magic 14, and go fuck around in facwar. Or if you're joining a corp, fuck around in whatever small gangs they like to field. Over here in Dreddit we do derp brawlers a lot, and nano gangs when I feel like telling people to try.
---
Not up to me, mate! &lt;3
---
&gt;Eve rules of engagement are the same since the beginning of Eve, local in null is one of those
---
Apparently the root of your problems is not understanding eve at all.There are no rules in eve whatsoever, people can do whatever fuck they want and you can do fuckall about it.
---
It's not broken in that context though.  It's broken in the context of blapping entire fleets or small gangs.  The problem with AOE Doomsday is the AOEness, not the Doomsdayness or the fact it's a Titan.
---
Well, you can but CCP will reverse it.
---
Source: corpmate who does lots of trading on the bazaar.
---
Yup. It's all but killed USTZ in this game, and it's sad. The game mechanics only reinforce the attitude - it's the attitude that's problem one.
---
his point is that supercapitals should also be balanced around rock paper scissors mechanics. At the moment, the only counter to supers seems to be to bring more supers.
---
you can't buy game knowledge, so you will have expensive toys and no clue how to fly them properly. Be careful because your mistake could be expensive. But I agree it sucks being in a rifter when your fleet forms with lokis :)
---
k lol.
---
Tech 2
---
Tech 3
---
3&gt;2
---
3 simply has the ability to do MULTIPLE specialised roles, it doesn't mean it should be worse at them.
---
Weird.  When I was deployed north in Tribute the vast majority of fleets that got pinged were subcap fleets.  Capitals are for escalation and killmail whoring.
---
I think you misunderstand words. :(
---
I had a similar thing happen to me when I started exploring and doing relic/data sites. Lost a Heron with 100M and recieved a donation of 100M sent to me and I decided to send them a thanks. Turns out they liked my reply and suddenly I was 250M richer (350 in total) and got an invitation to join them once I got enough SP to pass their min SP standard.
---
Things like this is relatively common, especially if you're new.
---
Wait, sig resolution isn't a thing for guns anymore? When did that change get made? No wonder turret application feels so fucking broken and janky now. I knew they changed \_SOMETHING\_ to make medium guns garbage.
---
&gt;if you think there is youre still in 2009 bra
---
lmao is used now oldbra/
---
yes, it's always good to bash some random dev. Fozzie is no group leader, he is not the team manager or anything. He only is a random developer, that actually enjoys to speak and discuss the stuff with the players.
---
Stop bashing fozzie, and appreciate what he is doing!
---
Delaying the effortlessness of jumping to the cyno is not the solution. It's still effortless, and it's still reliable -- if the cyno ship is alive, and the cyno is fully 'up' jumping is easy-mode. 
---
Instead, make the action of jumping require effort, and give less reliable results.
---
Yeah you can fit 280 valkyrie I in 6x cargo hold expander
---
You will maybe drop the depot once per wave maybe less. Some of the waves only has 150km attack range so its safe to drop it at 200km. Even at 150km less they will still miss you. And don't worry, you can tank some hits even if they hit hard, you are in a battlecruiser
---
Do you even play the game? Some of the article is good but a good portion of it is fear mongering. Their is still ALOT of subcap fighting... I feel like you have an agenda.. and that agenda is driven by insider knowledge.
---
This is why you make bookmarks in a location between your first bookmark and another celestial body. So it's not just a matter of making a single jump to find you.
---
mmmm delicious bots
---
They stopped the Drifters because Blackout happened. For Blackout to give good data to CCP they need to control other factors as much as possible, Drifters would change the behaviour of how nullsec entities operate and therefore turning them off so they can get the best possible picture of how just 'no local' effects nullsec makes sense.
---
Maybe they should make jump drives have random failures where they can misfire and jump you to the wrong system or not at all.
---
I'd disagree, we just hit the super singularity sooner than otherwise.  Training and selling dedicated Titan and super pilots and cap alts has always been a thing.  You just used to buy whole toons instead of injectors.
---
because other than removing local they were just a cancer to deal with
---
just nerf citadels and players will take the place of the drifters and generate actual content
---
A battleship that could fit cap logi would be a terrible idea. Just the same as a battleship that could fit dread guns. They'd immediately just become the defacto platform to use that gear on.
---
Stripping the ability for capitals to be able to tackle, web, ECM and all manner of other support roles, then giving them a specific, defined role puts them in a better position, in my opinion.
---
I've always been of the opinion that force aux hulls are just something that was never needed - carriers had the role down fine and were versatile enough that you could fit them either for combat support or logistics support.
---
The key word there is SUPPORT. They should never be a be all and end all hull.
---
Whats the quote. "Id rather do the wrong thing and shake up the game rather than letting it die." Drifters were the wrong thing.
---
mmmm safety :)
---
If the fax pilot is good, it's not as common as you think for them to fuck up. When 2 big groups fight its usually down to alphaing/straight up dpsing the enemy's ships through fax reps even with leshaks.
---
The distinction in underpinning flawed gameplay between a Titan sitting on a gate and bosoning an interceptor and sitting on a gate bosoning a small gang is lost on me...
---
Deleting boson would be a positive step we seem to agree on.
---
holy fuck this is an EPIC idea
---
Let's just roll back all capitals to pre-citadel tbh :)
---
Yeah, visually they're great :)
---
BBQ
---
I remember when Bovril was actually cool.
---
Nah, screw that - you'd need to commit and select a defined role for the hull, one or the other, and switching needs an actual refit.
---
They didn't change anything, they just took signature resolution and tracking of guns and turned them into one number with the same effect instead.
---
Remove capital rep modules and replace them with rep fighters. The FAX's already have giant drone bays on the model.
---
a high, yet reasonably priced Revalation can tank about 100k EHP/s heated. more if heated hardeners. so this is capital level. no ones complaining about haw revs though xD
---
I have to warn against it.  Sure it seems like a good idea at the time, but you'll rapidly lose any desire to "achieve" anything inside the game if you buy it in on a platter without any effort.  The game will have limited appeal once you've easily reached that goal with $.  This is why I've already loathed the idea of PLEX in Eve, though I understand it's contributed to the longevity of the servers to quite a significant degree.  Something important is lost when you PLEX and I think it's the striving to better yourself that allows games like this to retain their interest.
---
It's just like real life.
---
So the control factors by giving away free SP? /s
---
Or -- instead of the cyno -- the jump-drive could change.
---
Fitting requirements of the cyno don't change the 250 fleet members reading the pour through. 
---
Mass-limits are not a solution, as you just cyno through more cynos.
---
There's a lot of holes in some of these arguments.
---
You miss a lot of things when it comes to FAX. Sure, it takes 110 muninns or 50 abbadons if you just sit there like a complete moron. But if you had brought 2 bhaalgorns to that abbadon fleet, you would only need 20 abbadons, or even less than that depending on the FAX fit. There are tools to deal with cap boosting active reps. They're called neuts. A single dread with a cap neut will also render that FAX quite killable by the rest of the fleet as well. 
---
You need to keep in mind as well that (like the former triage carrier) the FAX serves as a critical force multiplier for groups that need to fight the big, brainless blob.
---
Take this example: *A group of 30 is defending a fortizar from goons/legacy/NCPL/whoever. They bring an 80-90 man subcap fleet. 
---
You need something that can tank hard- some sort of brick-tanked battleship. However, you also need fast-acting and very strong logisitics to deal with 60-70 DPS ships. If I don't have FAX reps, I'm going to have to dedicate 10-12 pilots to logistics, and really only basis or guardians as anything else will probably die. That leaves me with maybe 16-18 DPS ships, and they probably have almost as many logistics. Nothing will die. 
---
If I use a FAX, then I free up another 10 DPS ships that gives me the chance to actually break enemy reps, and if the FAX is under the fortizar then the anti-capital weapons will deter a dreadbomb from completely wiping my FAX off grid in 10 seconds because they will lose lots of dreads if they try that, while I trickle in FAX to keep my boys alive.*
---
FAX gives a smaller group the ability to try and do big things with small numbers when not sitting under an enemy supercapital umbrella. Look at how SkillU would use MR FAX to augment their nightmare fleets versus the B-tier legacy squad. 
---
----------------------------------------------------
---
You have 0 evidence for this AOE DD replacing bombing garbage. Predditors, INIT, PL use bombing runs all the time to great effect. Bombs are a large part of why people like using Goku fleet as well.
---
AOE DDs are only problematic for battleship fleets that sit at 0 not moving. Warping in or jumping a titan in is too slow to catch the vast majority of BS comps used today with the exception of maybe megathrons. There's a variety of easy ways to avoid it. MFJD your fleet in the massive spool time, warp off, simply burn away if you're in machs or phoons or something with a bit of speed. Just scout the gates you go to and use pings.
---
Idk about you, but titans bosoning interceptor gangs that are otherwise basically uncatchable is not the pinnacle of game-breaking. If they had used an assault frigate with an ADC or simply warped to a ping before the gate they wouldn't get caught.
---
--------------------------------------------
---
This post is really just buffing 256-man subcap fleets that quite frankly don't need the help. Take away the tools for small groups to deal with medium-to-large enemy subcap fleets or use capitals as a force multiplier via more DPS (carriers) or more reps (FAX), and leave them in a world where any time 50-70 muninns show up they just fucking dock and watch their structures die.
---
FAXes use what are and used to be Carrier skills... Unless they eliminate capital transfers and reps, what is there to refund?
---
Until they drop something good
---
There wouldn't be much of coding effort, as i assume (like most games developers) that they have a save of all previous code as a backup, it would only be a question of inserting it into the game, and making the Exclusion from the combat refit rule.
---
It states that the DISTANCE used to calculate ANGULAR VELOCITY is the CENTRE-TO-CENTRE DISTANCE between ships. 
---
You should re-read the piece if that's your take-away from it.
---
No worries, drifters confirmed to spawn in lowsec to balance FW venture's problem.
---
I don't see a problem with Titans bosoning anything in their own space.  If they venture out of it, they better do so with backup or risk getting dropped on.  
---
If you want to derp around somebody else's empire killing whatever you want, accept the risk you're going to get a boson to the face at some point.
---
Like i will sell them for 6bil a set tbh
---
"Consistently murder VNIs"  - I'm curious, can you really tank nullsec anoms to kill vnis in that? You're going to be well over 200m sig with the MWD running, your resists are a little low, and most vnis are stabbed, so you're going to need another point / scram.
---
As someone who currently hunts in a pulse scram retribution for the gimmick tank, I am VERY curious how well this guy actually works.
---
Please read my comment, and answer if that is actually possible / true (not asking if you are going to).
---
&gt; If you think it's easier to coordinate 7 people than make the right plays yourself, then maybe the issue is you? /s
---
No? What I said was that if you can’t get 7 people to load the same bomb type...then that’s not a game issue, or a you issue.
---
And we probably don’t disagree that much on this, I’m just very tired of people screaming about counterplay and wanting to kill off anything that isn’t their playstyle. After fifteen years of it, it’s beyond tiring.
---
Exactly, it just gives you a little more time before it's an issue, but it's always going to be an issue. Also, the more expensive something is the worse it will make the game because people will be scared to lose theirs because it will take years to grind back. (see titan/super fleets currently)
---
Depends on demand i guess. Id love if they can start that high
---
Why are battleships so slow? Take so long to lock and just generally not fun to fly?
---
please quote? as i cannot find it. sorry i read it, slowly. and did not see confirmation from him that this was the case.
---
only thing he actually seems to confirm is that falloff uses edge to edge. yet missiles have flight times and are launched from a certain point of the ship.
---
Why does a capital logi platform have the option to rep subcaps that cant be countered with EWAR? Either needs to lose its EWAR immunity, prevent capital reps from repping subcaps, or just prevent them from applying any RR to subcaps. Bring subcap logi if you want to rep subcaps.
---
**The closer you are (the less distance) the higher your angular velocity. We work out this distance using Center to Center**
---
Yeah you really can't drop the cyno alt.
---
Maybe just make the triage module 'refit-locked' then? I dunno if the game lets you be that granular with combat refitting, but that'd still lock people into one of the two roles while bringing back the combat refit playstyle.
---
This is why "it's a player problem" has always, and will always, be bullshit.  In a game this large, with the amount of time/effort/consequences at the core of this game, if the optimal play is boring, players are going to trend towards that gameplay.
---
If CCP wants the endgame to be fun, the game mechanics need to make the optimal strategy also be a fun one.
---
&gt;A lone interceptor is of no threat to any capital? A lone interceptor can't even break the passive shield regen. So you've completely shot your whole argument in the foot, by saying that as he 100% needs friends to be of any risk to anyone.
---
An ibis being able to hold down a carrier when the carrier cannot hurt said ibis is a broken mechanic.
---
&gt;You're just raging against capital changes because you realise that if you no longer have OP caps to achieve anything you're probably going to be dog shit at the game.
---
No, you're just raging that caps need a nerf because you don't like other people doing to you what you do to some 3 week old shitfit vexor newbro under the guise of "PvP". 
---
&gt;A carrier should not be able to fight a small gang of fast ships solo. It negates all other ship classes and we may as well delete subcaps from the game altogether, because what's the point of them?
---
A carrier is supposed to be versatile. It may as well be a dread if it's not.
---
So just the display value changed, and signature resolution is still a thing under the hood in the damage formula?
---
I feel like the first generation Lance mechanic was the best dd implementation. Take that and Give it a bonus to application based on target size.... Because I just really hate my supercarrier
---
Holy shit I'm agreeing with a horde nerd
---
Just gotta be chill, they will fix it, it just takes time.   They have to check it to make sure you aren’t trying to pull a fast one.
---
It would have been interesting if they actually fought instead of logging off all their supers with the intent to blue whoever ended up with the space at the end.
---
From personal experience if you have friends who play the game or find someone that will mentor you, you will hit the wall rather quickly.
---
Even when i started eve and had no friends yet, i had days where i just logged off because i found something new, but couldnt do it because i needed a certain skill for it. While the skills wouldnt take long to train, i still felt held back.
---
Having the option to invest in skillpoints allows you to explore more parts of the game faster. I would imagine for most people who start playing, the first couple of weeks are like a orientation where you try to get your hands on as much info as possible and try as much things as possible until you find something that really suits you. 
---
SP will help you with that, its always better to try it out, than just reading about it.
---
But i also agree that you are missing out on some milestones. Best case would be finding some other newcomers and explore the game together. I had a blast doing level 2 missions in highsec when i started eve. Ignorance was bliss :)
---
If player logins was the ONLY data they were measuring- sure.
---
But the thought that daily logins are what they're actually tracking is silly, especially when the numbers are going to significantly be altered from bots and masse multiboxers not logging in, and meme 'walkout' protests.
---
They weren't going to measure those statistics anyway.
---
I don't think everything is good, capital-wise. It's just that you will never find a "secret" card to beat a supercapital blob, because it has to be super-effective if you only look at the price tag, the skill (lol injectors) requirements, etc..
---
But even if they were 6 months a pop, there would still be that many titans in the game.
---
The only way you would see a reduction in titan/super usage is if you nerf their usefulness outside capital blob warfare, which would mean people would unsub their titan/sc account unless there is a big war ongoing.
---
Then again, I have nothing against being hammered, the main issue is that you can't kill shit in the small amount of time you have before they drop shit on you.
---
All to do with being scared of goons and running under a super umbrella.  How the elite have changed..
---
&gt; You cannot get scammed buying through the character bazaar
---
as much as you can't get murdered in real life
---
Balancing by cost works just fine! Just look at titans and keepstars.... oh wait...
---
CCP sadly killed the "rock paper scissors" the day they introduced supers. If there was a counter to a titan blob, you would not have any titan blob because they are too expensive.
---
They were utterly broken, not respecting basic mechanics that are forced on players.            
---
You had no real counterplay to them, and were reducing player to player interaction.              
---
You were forced to sit and babysit your infrastructure - aka no fun.          
---
If you went somewhere to roam ... you died as soon you meet drifters.

---
Game design is really interesting. And when you consider that essentially everything in the world is a "game" of some sort or another, it can get really deep. I.e. government structure and law is essentially the rules to a very complex game. So how can you change those rules to create a "fun" system rather than a grindy stupid one.
---
I'll say this again and I know it's not the one true answer to fix all this but I do believe it will help. Anything aside from Dred's should not be able to dock inside any type of structure. This will limit the amount of Caps alliances are willing to have as there would be a threat to the ships if a large number of them are built. 
---
Now they do not have to be parked in the open space, they could be tethered onto a station or such, but they should be visible at all times, with the threat that they could get attacked and destroyed. As most of my ingame time was from on and off plays during 2007-2010 there are way to many caps in the game.
---
Just seed dreads bro like cmon its easy anyone can skill and train if they rly wanted otherwise stop qq about caps cus ur too poor lmfao
---
Would make TD and ECM somewhat useful again tho. +1 from me. Keep in mind that ewar frigs have really short range and can get stuck in defensive bubbles way before they can actually activate ewar.
---
They will start higher.
---
i mean, they dont change speed numbers. so velocity does not change in any case.
---
so they literally only work out the range figure center to center. when using transversal velo and range to work out hit reg.
---
i mean, theres a pretty simple answer to this surely. just make the formula use overview shown ranges etc etc instead of whatever shit theyve thrown in there.
---
ALL IN ALL MR 'Taan. does this affect sub caps at 80-100km away? not really. does it affect dictors bubbleing them, yeh a little. as most things dont orbit a titan at 500m anyway. your just being 5-15km away (when eve thinks your 15-25km away)
---
its not game changing anyway. but if what this CCP guy says is true i accept being incorrect. along with basicly everyone, even Lasker Emanual has stated the way i say and not the way it actually works.
---
its only the number of, not the ability of, capitals and supers that is the issue. in my day not everyone had a capital. they were much rarer, more expensive. harder to own. eve is very real worldly. and in the real world as tech gets shared and more common, the oly thing keeping things in line is technology advancements.
---
ie: supersuperTITANS
---
or
---
MEGA DREADS lol
---
have a nice day
---
Like kicking someone for losing a niddy on a memorial roam? #NEVERFORGET
---
&gt;  e Do you think Goons were the first group to field a superc
---
I remember you guys being the supercap cancer once. ;)
---
I stand by what I discussed in the previous thread. CCP does need to nerf caps but they need to revisit shitty balance choices they made previously at the same time. They also need to stop injecting newer and more powerful hulls into the game and calling it balanced.
---
Again, that isn't what the "3" is meant to indicate. T3 is not supposed to be better than T2 at T2's job.
---
T3 is just a greater tier of technology, but that technology wasn't used to create a better ship than T2 at T2's job -- it was used to create a ship that's more generalized; one that can swap between roles, but not excel at them.
---
Think "Jack of all trades, master of none." That's T3. T2 *are* the masters of their trade.
---
Can I have ur stuff
---
But that's the danger of nullsec right.  I mean it's the nullbears that caused the stagnation.  You wont fight each other so something had to be done.   So basically you all cried and now it's all gone back to normal...I dont get how you think.its OK to never be attacked and when you do you get upset about it.
---
Nope. They have given sp when they multiplied skills, like battlecruiser used to be 1 skill and now it's 4.
---
I see what you did there.
---
&gt; Removing their ability to damage subcaps completely is bad gameplay... so you get tackled by subcaps, are you meant to just tab out to another window and go and play league of legends or watch YouTube because there's literally nothing you can do to influence the situation?
---
No, you're meant to use that corporation of yours effectively and have subcap support.
---
You know, the point of this entire thread.
---
... but people wanted this...
---
Nobody wants to see their effort transform into World of Darkness either.
---
For FAXes, I'd also suggest having a signature radius modifier for all capital shield, armor, capacitor and hull (lol) repairers.  It should only be able to fully apply its reps to other capital ships.  That way, a single FAX won't function as a 'game over' ship for small-to-mid sized subcap engagements.
---
I think this is more an issue of the horrible cyno mechanic than an issue with FAX. A Capital ship focusing on repping an individual battlecruiser should be able to bring a small gangs DPS to a full stop, that isn't broken at all. You have one capital ship, performing its intended role focused on one target - ofc you can't break it. 
---
What is silly about the scenario you describe is that in the current state of eve no one is surprised that caps get dropped to rep a battleship. There was no real risk to them by dropping the fax either, because if you counter dropped the fax they would have just counter-counter dropped you... cyno's are horribly broken.   
---
Cyno is a cool mechanic, but it should be something that can only be accomplished by niche ships and require heavy gimping of the fit, and it should be heavily nerfed in how instantaneous it is.
---
Might want to change Volta to most of wormhole space, on the majority we all like hitting nullsec when we get good statics
---
its a shame they are too content starved to bring measured responses and just drop 60 jackdaws on a 7 man roam....
---
Jintaan for CCP CEO 2019
---
Dude, give it a rest. TWE is one of the most reasonable guys complaining. If you make an actual argument, he'll at least consider it before telling you you're a retard.
---
That's what he said.
---
I don't like capitals at the same time  I don't like a 1mil isk crucifier shutting down a dread either.
---
I agree with that, even if we're trying to automate a lot of our combat assets so you would have less and less crew required over time.
---
Then again look at the state of the supercapital game itself :
---
\- Remove SC ability to hit subcaps =&gt; You can remove SCs from the game. They serve literally no other purpose because you can't even use them in TIDI.
---
\- Remove Titan ability to Aoe DD/HAW gun =&gt; You can remove the non-bridge titans from the game outside of structure bashing (because lol titan brawls will never happen).
---
As for the "hunting part" : You cannot remove the ability for megacoalition to organize themselves, nor remove their response time outside of nerfing cynos which would be pretty dumb for all other aspect of Eve Warfare.
---
For Rorquals, remove the panic module and either increase rorqual output dramatically (hm, no) or reduce the price tag attached to it (build cost, drone cost), or remove it as a mass-used ship (but you would kill half the NS subs with that).
---
It's not because you get dropped on another's lawn that you should remove their ability to do so.
---
As for Eve current warfare state (lol moving 1000 titans end of war), whatever changes you put in place will change nothing : blob winz.

* 10 frigates vs 10 destroyers ... again same question                
---
* 10 frigates vs ... 10 T3 Cruisers ... just to speed up a bit            
---
* 10 frigates vs ... 10 battleships                   
---
* 10 frigates vs 10 carriers             
---
* 10 frigates vs 10 titans                
---
While i agree, capitals should have support, but saying that something is bad as people cannot compete in frigates with some ships as they are to big is utterly bulshit in EVE 2019.               
---
This is old game.

**CCP job is to make all the game styles viable**           
---
If people want to throw capitals against each other, why not?         
---
But CCP should make areas when no one can use the capital ships.                  
---
It is so pretty simple.            
---
Like tell me **why the hell should i fly frigates if i don't like it?**
---
Kind of. The signature resolution is basically just a scaling factor for the damage application, and instead of keeping it a separate number they just scaled the tracking down for bigger guns by a similar amount to get rid of the extra entry.
---
Why use two constants for scaling the damage application when one does just as well? It just makes things less intuitive.
---
The sperg is strong with this one.
---
Pretty sure my corp directors convert surplus isk into plex as an asset storage strategy. 
---
Personally I just store my isk as capitals.

Suitonia lobbying for changes that would benefit his own ass-cancer, kiterino play style. Water is wet, have a downvote.
---
How is that any different then being a "Krab" and have PVPers enter system and murder you, I mean it seemed fair to me after that first tweak that made them a limited spawn and less powerful.
---
Add multibuy to that list too. It kind of comes down to your #2 but it goes about a different way; it will just pay the same per item as the highest order needed to fulfill whatever item you tried to multibuy.
---
....9x seems a bit unlikely to happen this route, though.
---
Thanks for the nice post. Coming from someone who has been behind the closed doors and possible had discussions which shape the game, this has added value. When an article critical of the current meta appears on the website of an entity that is probably benefiting the most from this meta, this also had added value.
---
&gt;\*“Before we started looking at details, we wanted to firmly fix the goal of the design for capitals  
---
&gt;Provide interactive, meaningful, gameplay.  
---
&gt;\-Obtaining  and mastering capital ships, as well as fighting and destroying them,  should be a compelling aspirational goal for players.  
---
&gt;Capital ships are the premier weapon for killing structures.  
---
&gt;Capital  ships should be effective in most combat situations without completely  dominating the battlefield and without invalidating other ship types.“\*
---
Emphasis on the last 2 points. So basically what some of us have been saying, only to be met by a reasoning of "making them structure bashers will negate their purpose and fun". Well, i'm sorry some of you guys injected into something that is too good in too many situations and will probably start getting nerfed down the line as a result of the imbalance, but if it's killing the game (and CCP's wallet) the reasonable thing to do is nerf it.
---
I think CCP has gradually backed themselves into a corner over the years. You now have a few hundred or even thousand players who spent real money on injectors to jump the queue and sit in what is the current flavor of the month (more like flavor of the past few years really, which makes things worse by adding more momentum to it), so a lot of them get upset and complain at the slightest indication of a nerf.
---
However, i've also seen a lot of people belonging to the biggest null blocs who want this situation changed, because despite it giving them a lot of advantages, it makes the game boring for them as well.
---
So this is not an issue of nullsecers vs everyone else, it's an issue of people who can see long term and for the benefit of the game as a whole, vs people who can't see beyond the short term benefit for themselves and their immediate surroundings of friends/corp/group they fly with, regardless of their in-game playstyle.
---
For example, many years ago my group was doing a lot of roaming and we copied one of the setups prevalent at the time. Back then you could have warp core stabs on your setup without gimping your lock time/range. But why fit WCS when you go out looking for fights? A lot of people did it because they were risk averse. But the most successful people did it because it allowed them to engage bad odds and go in heavily outnumbered. And so, the passive shield vagabond meta was born (it didn't have a shield boost bonus back then).
---
Full rack of guns and a nos or launcher in the highs, mwd, 20km point and 2 LSEs in the mids, nanos, gyros and a single wcs in the lows. You could go in alone or with 2-3 buddies against as many as 5 times your numbers. If it was faster than you, you could kill it. If it could kill you, you could probably run from it. Having the nanos in a fast ship with good damage allowed you to spread the enemy out as they chased you and whittle down their support in low-transversal situations (one of the many techniques you can see in the youtube videos of ChessurSB where he kites with the navy slicer and stabber). The single WCS allowed you to negate long points, so you could warp out and back in again to reposition, with fleet members pinging off of each other, extending the chain as the enemy gave chase and killing them. And when they were left without support, you could go in for their battleships.
---
Was it fun? Immensely so. Getting from wicked creek to esoteria in 40 minutes and attacking everything along the way with 2 buddies, stirring up a hornet's nest and having them bubble camp us on the return trip (with tacklers around the bubble and battleships in sniping positions) only for us to MWD out of the bubble, shoot a couple of ceptors and make it out safely, is one of my most fun little trips in my entire eve life.
---
But was it balanced? Not very much. Did we cry when certain nerfs made it impossible to keep doing? I bet some people did. But the people who can see beyond their own personal playstyle and appreciate what will benefit the game as a whole, accepted it and moved on, slightly changing their fits and diversifying their gang compositions with a few more ship types to compensate for the lost utility of having one ship that could engage and disengage at will while also having t2 cruiser DPS and tank values. I miss it dearly, but truth be told the ship was maybe good at a few too many things while not being really exceptional in any (eg, the DPS was allways kind of low compared to something like a deimos).
---
It's whole "adapt and keep going" thing we've seen people chanting like a mantra for years. Well, we can either adapt to changes to the safety of null and capitals getting rebalanced and even nerfed in some cases, or we can adapt to the game slowly dying out.
---
They're *good enough* as-is.  It'd be an easy improvement to just change some numbers for now.
---
Ye just checked 100km WD ewar range frig nice meme. But you could balance it to have range around 20-30km.
---
Ah yeah, I keep forgetting that burners are a thing, been years since I ever spent a lot of time doing missions. I was talking about blitzing level 4 regular missions obviously, not burners. Also, I'm not sure an alpha or new player could do burners (especially alphas since they might lack a lot of good support skills at IV or V) and the mid-grade ascendancy set still costs around 1billion for the whole thing, so not really accessible to new players.
---
And I agree you fucked up if you're in a bubble, but planning for the worst is probably a good idea. More fuel sounds really nice, but so does having the ability to fight off basic tackle and leave if something goes wrong. Really, really hard to hold down a carrier that has 50k and 10k props with sabres. They move at 1k/sec with self links/heat, so you need to scram it, then you die to fighters.
---
The dream I want ( but would take some careful thought and balance into the design.
---
Yeah sutonia pulls a lot of crap it of his ass, and tries to feed it as informed ideas.
---
It was even worse when you had to train learning skills to help accelerate training times for that boring wait.
---
What do I do with my last 3 VNI hulls? Can I run them in those Trig sites I've heard so much about?
---
If you're putting 70+ bil on the field, it shouldn't be worthless. The haw turret nerf was the first push in that direction. If you are putting some worth 35x more than a dread, it should do twice the damage. 
---
What you are suggesting is another cheese way to get at the people who put the time in to get in those capital ships. It took me 8 years to get my Titan just as this complaining starts and it gets nerfed.
---
Newer players who haven't put the time in don't value the effort put in to get in Titans. Instead they complain because they have issues fighting them. You should have a hard time killing it, and lose ships to it. The pilot is fielding billions of isk more than your fleet, probably multiple times the value of your fleet.
---
more like ... how the games meta was changed (by patches)
---
That might be fun.
---
I'd also like to see less focus on bots orbiting a button and more on pilots fighting. You should get more LP for killing a player than orbiting a button and if you actually engage and lose, you should get LP for that as well. Maybe warzone control can be determined by helping the NPC fleets gain control of systems and keel it. Then buttons can be deleted entirely.
---
Byyyeeee.
---
No, untill danger of nullsec was always about other players hunting you.             
---
* In higsec you have Concord and  militia - also no stuff like bubbles or bomber bombs. 
---
* In lowsec gate and station guns  - also no AOE doomsdays         
---
* Nullsec, well you can shoot and do all the things all tools at your disposal             
---
* WH space, similar to nullsec in terms of tools, but focused on sneaky, cloaky mechanics - also much bigger safety when you engage on the WH ( you can jump with aggression)
---
If you PM me your exact location and wait in open space, I’d be more than happy to come along and show you exactly how they can be put to good use!
---
&gt; As a result of this, I would suggest either completely removing Support Fighters from the game, or at the very least remove the tackling elements from them – Changing the Dromi and Siren to be Paint and Damp fighters respectively.
---
.. the fuck is this nonsense? You literally *just* made a case for why Capitals shouldn't be able to negate the need to bring subcaps for support, yet you only care about tackle? What about subcaps that are specifically for damps? Or painting? Or, you know, *support*?
---
Get rid of Support Fighters entirely.
---
&gt; Then what’s the point of playing if adding more friends is not a thing.
---
You cannot be friends with 3000 people. You can be allied with 3000 people and work on projects that gain benefit from the manpower that 3000 people offers however and convince yourself that you are friends with all your coworkers.
---
&gt;I just don’t understand what you want.
---
Smaller more MMO style social structures to exist and be viable. 
---
&gt;If you balance a game around allowing a small number of people being able to kill something a larger group is going to take the same tools and use them then what will you complain about.
---
Which is why i am not so narrow minded as to think that this is a problem you could solve by making killing capitals easier. You need something more fundamental to prevent so many of them from being used enmasse.
---
&gt; Null security is supposed to be about empire building let people build an empire if you want to break that empire start one of your own and get organized.
---
You do not need an empire so big the sun never sets on it. I've been on the front line of spearheading trying to take sov in a power vacuum with no defender its grindy and burns people out. There is no way you will carve a piece of it out for yourself against the full might of the supercap amradas of the major null empires.
---
Hell you won't even be able to take a piece of it without being able to project what little power your small group is able to across all timezones.
---
Ncpl are so broke after Tribute they’re having to steal keepstars.

i mean, im sure there was a mission i remember doing this i kinda got a part in something like this, but for the work to go in i feel this is maybe somthing to play ED for while resting your eve eyes. to then come to eve to do everything ED doesnt provide

Like /u/purity_the_kitty says, Dreddit is one of the good "big" corps. Oh course we're biased, but I think you'd be happy with us.

Since day one, ten years ago, we have been focused on new players. We have free ships and skill books, lots of fleets to fly on, and SRP (Ship Replacement Plan: we pay for your ship when you lose it on a fleet).

One key benefit is the mentorship program. You'll get assigned one upon asking, and they will follow your progress, introduce you to other parts of the corp including space careers, and help you getting ready for fleets. 
---
There are fleets every day, and some of the safest space in Eve in which to fly. (You might hear that it's TOO safe, but there are still fights to be had.) We are the founding corp of TEST Alliance, and one of the key alliances in the Legacy bloc, so we have lots of friendly corps running fleets around all day .

Because he wants to nerf FAXes ability to live not their ability to rep others.
---
He’s also trying to balance them around T2 subcap logi.
---
Remove remote reps and cap transfers from the game. Change all current logistics ships so they give bonuses to resistances. That means anything that gets shot and doesn't have local reps will die eventually.
---
Low would be safer, if anyone lived there. What makes it dangerous is hunters, which are everywhere, and what makes it safer is friends, but large groups capable of defending miners aren’t really common in low.
---
No local, sabre in system. 
---
And man, gate it. What could go wrong, it's probably like 3b fitted. I've gated worse subs. 
---
They also died, but lol that's not because I gated it, that's because I tried to pvp with it and fed
---
Ah, okay, they did these changes in two steps, thanks for clarifying. So it's just the power creep of sig tanking ships that have killed medium guns again.

I see a lot of non-capital/non-triage pilots commenting.

So everything I say will just be argued against because... idiots.

As a level 5 Triage Archon/Chimera (Now Apostle/Minokawa) pilot, I can assure you that the FAUX in it's current state is a mere shadow of what the Triage carriers of old used to be. We killed them then, they're easier now.

Oh yeah.. you're idiots.  
---
Guys.. EVE isn't, and was never, a game of simple combat mechanics. Jiintaan apparently wants to fight FAUX's with raw DPS. Oh boy! Make my day! As a FAUX pilot I love idiots like this.   
---
Try again. Really. The tools to fight FAUX's are in-game already. They've been there since 2007. Oh, and now you have Triglavian ships. THE GREATEST DPS SUBCAPITALS you could ask for! C'mon!
---
What more do you want? A CCP Dev to fly in your fleets to hold your hand too? Maybe the FAUX pilot should just self-destruct so you can feel victorious?  
---
Btw Jiintaan... If your 'recommendation's area accepted, I want CCP to let me cash out my LVL 5 FAUX skills. Let's be fair: if you ruin my fun I should get my skill points  back.
---
It's never that easy lol
---
I remember back in the day when remote repair really only good at repping POS's.  Fleets were less risk adverse and would expect to lose a decent amount of ships win or lose.
---
You can call them in whatever way you want, but there are basic rules based on the sec status of a system, otherwise there would be no differences between hi-sec, low-sec, null or wh.
---
Tell me, if null sec should work like this how do you explain that it had local since now?  
---
And I'm not talking about a couple of months or years, I'm talking about 17 years.
---
I have no doubts that many nullsec players like the actual state of null, but do you think they are the majority of them?  
---
I deeply doubt it, It would be very interesting to make a survey, sadly only CCP have the tools to it in a proper and reliable way.
---
But the meta was ok when it favoured NC/PL?
---
No they had all the same opportunities the rest have had, they were too "elitist" to change
---
I really miss battleship slugfests and dread slugfests too. That's my kinda fighting. Flying in and punching each other in the fact until one side falls over or pulls out.
---
I just fundamentally don't like force aux hulls. My view would be to delete them, give the logistics role and triage role back to carriers, then refund any SP that was wasted into force aux training.
---
I love the idea of putting triage modules back on carriers, just the same as a dread has the siege module - these both define the roles of the hull, but if you want to fit a carrier for combat support you can, it's just not as effective.
---
For me, I'd slot caps into the following roles:
---
*Titan* - Flagship, no offensive combat other than a doomsday. I'd also delete all doomsdays other than the lance, and create one lance for each race that deals their damage type. I'd also make using the lance have a decent cooldown, and it'd consume fuel too. Other than that, Titans would be totally focused on fleet support via gang links and AOE Buffs with massive bonuses to links depending on race. I'd want to make it so that it wasn't cost effective or tactically sound to have huge numbers of them on field.
---
I'd also use titans as a mobile stargate too, much like they're used now, but have the fuel costs scale - the longer the portal is open and the more tonnage goes through it, the more the fuel cost increases. Drop the cycle time down for the jump portal for a fast cycle rate so that the fuel costs ramp up the longer you keep a portal open.
---
In terms of weapons, the lance itself I'd keep traditionally targeted, but it wouldn't do damage to the target it had locked. Instead, when activated it'd slice a path through space to the target that would deal colossal damage, so you'd need to rely on positioning to use it to its highest level of effectiveness, and you could chain them between two allied vessels to catch people between them.
---
*Supercarrier* - These would be meatier and harder hitting. Their role would be a titan and dread killers, with a focus on anti-capital warfare. They'd be useless against subcaps and vulnerable to a decent sized group of subcap hulls. Their primary function would be for defense of space - these are the ships you'd pile in on people who brought an invading cap force into your space. They'd also be useful for defending your own cap fleet from hostile capitals. They'd use fighters.
---
*Carrier* - Carriers would resume triage and would be devoted primarily to supporting fleets of dreads, titans and super carriers. Their function would be to support capital fleets, but they'd be vulnerable to sub caps. Carriers would no longer field fighters, and would no longer be able to use local reps. You'd need to deploy them in groups for them to be effective and support each other as well as an allied cap fleet. 
---
Additionally, in place of using fighters, I'd give them bonuses to using sentry drones to keep them static and make positioning them on the battlefield a tactical choice. I'd probably put them in a position where they could field up to 10 sentries based on drone interfacing skills, then another five based on the level of the carrier skill.
---
*Dreadnaughts* - These would be the bruisers, and the bulk of any offensive cap fleet. These would be the primary DPS that you bring to a fight to hammer a structure, a hostile cap fleet, or as a show of force. Effectively the battleship's larger brother, they'd be completely focused on bringing the hurt in a more sustained firefight, dropping into siege to actually... you know.. SIEGE... a structure with the rest of the caps there as a support network. Dreads would be the primary hull used to punch people in the face. 
---
I'd also delete high angle weapons too - no need for them, if you want to protect against subcaps, bring carriers, or bring a subcap fleet to support.
---
Of course, these changes are just my thoughts personally, I'm not a game designer and most of them are terrible, but I'd also couple them with a few fundamental changes to how caps deploy too.
---
1 - No more cynos in lowsec. Only coverts. Any cap that moves through lowsec has to use stargates to do so.
---
2 - Give jump freighters the ability to use covert cynos to move around - this allows them to still jump through lowsec.
---
3 - Give jump freighters a covops cloak too.
---
3 - No super caps in lowsec. Titans and supercarriers just wouldn't be able to go there, period.
---
4 - Restrict titans and supers from using stargates, period. They have to jump, they're too large.
---
5 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate.
---
Of course, there's other stuff too, like changing how supers and caps interact with structures too, but this post is long enough lol.
---
That’s *exactly* what he wants.
---
It's definitely too safe, and USTZ is too dead. I agree that for null corps it's good tho.
---
I dont know what this means for me.
---
Yep, no cap remote reps on subcap targets, minimum sig threshold to be able to use them.
---
because they need time to develop the futur invasion, the blackout is just an excuse
---
Shush with your any capital bullshit. You've been bitching for years about your poor kestrel gameplay is ruined yet you don't even know how capital mechanics work as seen by you getting hic pointed on a gate and not understanding why you couldn't jump. Git gud HTFU
---
Battleships aren't used anymore because of the warp speed mechanic.  
---
And you can lock like an interceptor. Just use all your mids for Sensor Boosters.  
---
"But that would destroy my tank/control!"  
---
Well the FAUX pilot just committed being immobile for 5 fricken minutes. You gotta accept a trade-off somewhere.
---
I think the real problem isn't how strong caps are - it's that there are way too many many of them and they are too easy to produce/use/lose. 
---
Capital ships are a big deal, look at IRL. There are less than 50 carriers in service in the entire world. The USA holds about half of them, and I think 10 of them are classified as supercarriers.   
---
Carriers, and Supercarriers IRL:  
---
1) always travel with incredibly power support fleets - you will never find one alone.
---
2) when one shows up - it's game over for the other side unless they can bring their own carrier fleet, and if they can it's going to quite literally be a historical event. 
---
3) When a carrier fleets location is known and is anywhere abnormal - it will make the global news because it's a massive projection of nearly unstoppable power.
---
4) Carriers and Supercarriers have extensive short, long and medium range defensive systems and can defend themselves to some extent from virtually any threat - small or large. But they are so valuable that it is still entirely necessary that they travel with support fleets so extensive that they would be extremely formidable in the abscense of the capital ship they are protecting.
---
So I know that I'm comparing a video game to IRL and I'm not siggesting that Eve be made "Realistic".
---
However, from a balancing standpoint - Capital ships in EVE mirroring IRL Capitals would make eve a very exciting place to be.  
---
\&gt;Put a full stop on further capital production  
---
\&gt;Limit this production by the number of capitals in game at any given time to a \*very\* low number, don't allow more to be built until existing capitals are killed off below this level
---
\&gt;Build an entirely new set of mechanics around capital production that focus on losing a capital meaning a shift in power (i.e., the group that loses the capital will have some sort of timer on capital production whereas other groups will not, allowing opposing forces to build a capital when the enemy loses one)
---
\&gt;Keep capitals strong - maybe even buff them after numbers drop below the allowable threshold
---
\&gt;Make it exceptionally difficult to build, maintain, project and support a capital ship  
---
The results of this?  
---
1) The current power blocs that worked so hard to get there (whether I like them or not) will remain in power, and will keep their blue donut.
---
2) those same power blocs won't be able to use their capitals for anything and everything, as the loss of even one capital would represent a massive loss in resources and the potential for a very real shift in power as another alliance could build a capital of their own and again cap the number of possible capitals in the game.  
---
3) The above would mean that capital losses would almost always mean a notable shift of in game power amongst alliances
---
4) Capital fights will with almost no exceptions become IRL news events, instead of just another gatecamp in delve.   
---
5) You won't see caps being used for silly things anymore, when they undock and fight it will be a big deal
---
its unfortunately not organisation that allowed goons to be where they are.
---
its PURE meta gameplay. goons adapted to the meta to rorqual mining, and boson or hardcore drops to remove content from thier area way faster than anyone else. they also let literally any scrub join.
---
due to this, they now have a much larger unskilled. yet higher quantity of capital ships. if what you say (which to be fair you are slightly correct) and empire building should be left to others to make it fall. unfortunatly this has been seen, and done, and it basicly ends eve. and everyone 'wins' eve and eve stops. as no one plays it anymore. as there is only one empire. we HAVE to stop this from happening through mechanics as the injector/rorqual mix allowed this meta game style to advance far too quickly.
---
others have been ontop of the meta game before. but no other meta game caused unchangeable, un fixable effects as this one did. 
---
will goons join the enemys to break the empire. no xD as goons got them into the capitals and rorqual alts they will stay.
---
can the rest of eve break goons, yes. bu would require 1000000:1 chances of all the required forces to ally up and break down what goons currently have, but even then. even if every titan and keepstar goons own was destroyed today. goons could rebuy them all tomorrow. and that. is an effect of rorquals and injectors meta game being won by one side.
---
Null sec sucks and is deserted. In low sec there are more people looking for fights and there is no sov. So once you can dock up and buy ammo or even a ship.
---
More nano's than sence...
---
Lol, please come bring content to Eso. 
---
My other idea was bait ships. I don't know if Sapo would get mad at me for cyno'ing in my own carrier on someone trying to kill my VNI though. It's probably stupid without a sabre; I guess you do need more than 2 accounts.
---
Just watch they come out with capital EWAR platforms and the minmatar one is instantly busted cause you get 150km webs
---
Do you have Amarr Carrier 5? How about Caldari Carrier 5?

How about ALL the engineering skills and capital repair skills to 5?

Lowsec still has local, so you know... if someone comes in and they're not blue; get safe. 
---
In 0.5 space, it's hit or miss, some people will roam through to gank anyway just for something to do. You can try to get to a spot with fewer people.
---
You should just start a new series called *Shitposting in Station*
---
I would disagree, The skill system of eve is probably the among the main reasons for new players to quit because whatever you want to do, there are literally thousands of people better than you.
---
Trading: T1 is overrun by ppl who can produce and sell cheaper. T2 needs lots of skills &amp; cash.
---
Hauling: small things like bpo have high collateral, large things needs freighter -&gt; skills &amp; cash
---
Exploring: High-Sec is overrun and offers little reward. Low &amp; Nulll greets you with cloaked strategic cruisers.
---
PVP: Ever tried to throw a t1 (meta at best) fitted frigatte at a t2 fitted heavy assault frigatte?
---
Mining: 5 acc multiboxed mining crews in barges + orca. They reduce prices that a puny little ventures yield offers, again, almost no reward.
---
Ratting: Skills makes you much more efficient. Some t2 missions in cruisers are difficult for new player.
---
This will be downvoted into oblivion, but this is something no ones considers.
---
Yes. Please do. I loved my Triage Archon far better than the Apostle.  
---
It was SOOO much better.
---
I make a lot more money with my real life time than it would take to grind. That being said, don't buy too much or you'll get shit you don't know what to do with.
---
Yeah, in our corp fleets I do just that. We have a small number of logi, and it's pretty awesome. But I actually like the big fights too :P
---
You guys are idiots.   
---
The FAUX is easier to kill than the triage archon ever was
---
If a carrier is in a position where it's using its CIWS it's already among the "walking dead"/floating sunk.  It requires massive fleet wide break downs to get to that point.
---
Likewise it's probably in a position where it has served its purpose and launched ordnance at designated targets.
---
___ 
---
The most realistic purpose of a carrier is to pick on far weaker forces, and be a diplomatic card of "we'll put 5,000 people who haven't had a chance to buy anything for 45 days in one of your ports".
---
Against an equal force a carrier launches planes and then sinks.  Essentially when it sinks it stands as a testament for how many political resources the enemy is willing to spend after the fight.
---
If EVE the same role would be a low EHP capital that after it explodes let's the capsuleer continue to control fighters from station.
---
A DoD would cost many titans, while letting players who didn't skill caps have a relevant role in fights. You still need caps to take it down tho.
---
Even without this gimmick ship, the game would be better if a maximum of players can meaningfuly participate in large-scale fights.
---
About the time investment, the issue is not about the outcry of single players (like me). It is that nullblocs are SO far ahead with the amount of capitals that any kind of opposition from a new corp is banging their collective head on a wall.
---
Holy shit please do all of this.
---
To be honest, a supercapital blob is always backed by multiple subcapital fleets, outside of chill home defense&amp;shenanigans were you drop 5 of them to remove the pest from your krabs pilots.
---
That is the only case where you would see them dropped randomly without some kind of support around, as in other cases you would need to clear tackle and stuff in case shit happens. Ironically, that's also the only time when you can kill them without superior capital numbers.
---
I agree with you on the lower SP pilots, but we may have to look at other means of making them useful (like nerfing supercapital electronic warfare resistance ?).
---
Are capital broken vs subcap right now? Yes, of course, nobody would say otherwise. Are nerfing their effectiveness vs subcap to oblivion as solution ? No at all.
---
I'm not offering anything because I don't have concrete idea right now, but asking for unilateral change for a small percentage of combat situation in Nullsec warfare is not going to help.
---
Previous changes by CCP were kinda on point, I would have removed the NSA and added a scanres bonus against some important things (fighters...), nerfed active FAX tanking (sorry wormholers but I think you agree with me).
---
Nerfing tracking or dps is never gonna work one way or another.
---
polarized oracle(s)
---
Nah. just some idiot setting up a buy order and having one too many digits. You were lucky to be the lowest seller when it happened.
---
I don't think you need to 100% remove SC ability to HIT subcaps, but as the OP pointed out, the ability to point them basically makes SCs too versatile. 
---
Same with Titans. The OP has a good point in that Titan tracking in THEORY versus REALITY is way out of whack. I don't see why CCP can't adjust tracking for Titans in a way that feels "natural" to how it "should" work.
---
Can't agree more.
---
Big F
---
battleships are supposed to bring the big hurt in a fleet composition, where someone else prepares the target for you (tackling, webbing, painting etc). You just hold for a lot and deal a lot of damage (to large targets).   
---
Trying to do things solo with a battleship will work too, but you need to bling a lot and is not always guaranteed to succeed.
---
Wait a minute buddy... You need to focus on deleting the cancerous Triglavian problem.  
---
Which wasn't on displayed before the entire world this year due to the AT being conveniently cancelled.  
---
But yeah.. I see what you want: remove the one ship that allows every other race to survive against Triglavian, but leave me my OP subcapitals.  
---
Not cool.
---
There are fleets from other TEST and Legacy corps too, but there could always be more. Certainly our current war has us fighting (abroad, not at home) in the middle of the U.S. night.
---
I've never lost a Capital to being HIC pointed on a gate. That was a video I posted of Stunt Flores 2 years ago. I'm glad you posted this again though even though I corrected you a few months ago. 
---
I earn 0 Ad Revenue from the Wordpress btw it's a free account.
---
Turn FAX into the " small citadels" you've talked about. When they go into siege the consume stront and fleet members can dock and refit, it can carry ships in its SMB to drop into space for fleet members to reship if they die.
---
No bc none of the supercap forces in the game actually fight each other
---
So curious how you are not able to read the discription of the video?
---
So now that the "constructive feedback" has been provided, can we expect changes soon? Of course not.
---
Fuck that. Cant we just roll back to [*year that my team was winning*]?
---
Wait, you posted a video of stunt even though he's banned. Yeah dude. Sure. Assuming that is true tho, have you ever even been in a capital, real talk
---
Like I said 
---
Fights
---
And ones that matter, at that.
---
Hey Jintaan, Great read, but one thing I disagree with is removing support fighters from carriers.  Having personally never flown one, but fought them hundreds of time, and [most recently fighting many of them the last couple days,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKmwiqha4tLJ7jjrJ9ZblNg?view_as=subscriber) I think they are ok to fight against.  One thing that could make it better for both sides is to simply increase the cost of fighters.  I think quadrupling the price of T1 fighters and crippling the cost of T2 fighters would make those fighting them happier and make the carrier/super pilots think twice before sending fighters off.  Make the cost of each fighter equivalent to a T2 fit version of hull of similar scope.  so a T1 Dromi would cost the same as a T1 frigate with t2 fittings to achieve the same level of webbing/speed/tank/etc...  T2 Dromi would be equivalent of a T2 ewar frigate with T2 fittings and rigs.  Just my opinion.
---
Tragedy of the commons.
---
You realize that FAUX had at about 35% capacitor after its jump?  
---
It does appear quickly. But it pays a huge price for it.  
---
Maybe Stitch you should go back with some E N E R G Y   N E U T R A L I Z E R's. Like, I don't know. A C U R S E?  
---
Oh! What? Like, really? We can do that? How? B...but they're drake will kill us!  
---
Oh yeah? you're now worried about the Drake? Don't get on that bandwagon cupcake. CCP ruined that ship longtime ago.
---
I would argue that small gang corps rely on triage just as much if not more.
---

This is the video you're talking about. He was allowed to make a new account and he came back to the game.
---
Sounds like they're shooting themself in the foot.
---
Have you ever been in a capital?
---
Does it make you feel dirty? Like a thot
---
Instead of trying to balance the ships, which CCP has been trying to do since they came out, perhaps we can balance their role.  Let’s say we increase the wind up time of cynos by a lot, like 30 minutes or so  before you can jump to them (obviously constrained by balance) such that capitals could not quickly respond outside their system, but instead could only be moved strategically.  So any fast response fleet would have to be sub capitals.  This still makes capitals to be feared by subcapitals, but means they will pretty useless as a rapid response.  Obviously we could add a rapid cyno module to citadels thus they could quickly deploy for base defense if the base reached a certain shield level I.e. took a certain amount of damage.  
---
Sure if they get on grid, they can beat any subcap, but any subcap that stays that long deserves to die.
---
Don't know. 5 ships can't break 2 guardians. Unless they're battleships. Which Stitch's gang most likely was 1 interceptor, a flyswatter anti-tackle ship. Maybe a trio of dps cruisers. Typical roam setup.  
---
WE CAN'T DEAL WITH A CAPITAL WITH THIS!!!!  
---
Sounds like a judgement problem. Get gud.
---
You should be a developer
---
&gt; It requires massive fleet wide break downs to get to that point.
---
In RL sure. In EVE it takes one guy in a ceptor worth 30 minutes of ratting to permanently hold it in place.
---
Couldnt you address the cyno escalation by introducing a timer based on mass coming through the cyno?
---
Ie... wanna jump 60 titans? There will be a greater delay than bridging with 1 titan and a sub cap fleet. Maybe sub caps dont get the penalty but caps do?
---
Or simply set a mass level for the jump where there is no penalty...wanna bring 3 titans? Fine. Wanna bring 1 titan with a huge support fleet? Fine. 
---
That way 1 rorq coulsnt call an entire super cap umbrella...but rather it would require coordination and actual risk to confront attackers.
---
In order to prevent abuse of sub caps simply jumping in and chain cynoing new fleets...there could be a 5 or so minute delay on any ship that bridges using a cyno.
---
Ofc there are work arounds... ie uncloaking other cyno ships to call in numerous fleets but it still requires more work and coordination for defenders and well...murphys law. It's much harder to manage 20 response fleets than it is to manage a couple.
---
Not my call, bud!
---
Never thought you were the social justice warrior type Stitch.

The only thing that comes to mind is something that only comes into the game at a specified rate. It's harsh but anything else would be minmaxed and farmed and we'd be back where we started

Basically nullsec contains minerals and moongoo not present in other areas of new Eden. With the recent drifter issues, the majority of sovnull blocs have agreed to halt exports of these raw materials, and instead trade amongst one another, and export finished product at a lower price than hisec manufacturing can provide
---
I'm kinda on the other side of the fence ;)
---
Aside from trying to hide RMT, I could see that as being a way to try to hide a spy alt. Money laundering, in a way.
---
Classy title right there. Aaaah, when will we escape the gamer stigma...
---
He never said 10 frigates should be able to beat 10 or even 1 titan. He's saying the problem is that even 10 T3Cs or 10 Battleships are useless against Titans, even in supporting roles. You can't damp, neut, or realistically tackle a HAW titan. The only way to interact is by applying more titan level dps, making every other ship in the game redundant. Maybe completely removing resistances isn't the perfect solution, but the idea is to make other roles in the game viable again
---
If PvE ratting took a fleet and generated 40x as much income, I'd be ok with that.
---
In what universe?
---
Maybe when active combat refitting was a thing... but it's no longer a problem.
---
I don't have that "(s)". How long would it take soloing it in Oracle?
---
no
---
Let's be clear here, the only thing I have 0 understanding of in this thread. Is whether or not you guzzled more Spodumain or cum before posting in it.
---
I do have a couple of modifications to that I would suggest. Instead of removing local reps from triage remove cap boosters and let them combat refit while triage is active so you can have old style triage. It could be crazy powerful but "bring 5 bhaalgorns" is (IMO) a sufficient solution to that problem. Also, instead of 10 sentries give them 2 sentries with massive bonuses to reduce server load.
---
cause it's true
---
This is so sad, can we delete half of null?
---
Kitey shit is already cancer, your playstyle is literally cancer, they have already nerfed carriers to shit no one uses them in pvp cause the application is garbage. Dread brawls are dead because of insurance. And you STILL want to nerf them. No, pls biomass
---
Obviously cum 😏
---
two propless drakes with a medium rr on the high slot and a scythe to rep them will do just fine.   
---
Whole fleet is like 150m before insurance :))
---
Ironically, you're kind of making Suitonia's point for him.  Up to battleships, the 10v10s *can* actually be won by the team with more skill and better comps, or the correct countercomp.  
---
But magically, once you step up to capitals, it becomes very hard to even consider a frigate comp that could win.
---
Ah I got it, as a carrier pilot, I thought you were saying that they were like drones in how they were piloted (as in launch, press F, forget), and that's why I condescendingly asked wtf you were on about. 
---
I've got a hard time calling carriers drone boats in a traditional sense, as you're essentially flying 4 different ships at the same time - multiboxing but without the multibox. 
---
Agree with everything else you said.
---
CCP Falcon for president
---
;) Just setup some casual game design meetings with your ideas. Don't forget free food, people will attend any meeting with free food :)
---
Keeping it short, few counterpoints:
---
1) Combat triage (FAX as subcap support) mainly serves to work around having inferior numbers and is arguably the most skill intensive fleet role in the game right now. Just due to that it should stay in the game, as one of few remaining skill &gt; numbers mechanics available.
---
2) Carriers should have been dedicated anti-support platform, with much lower dps, but much better application; good at dealing with nano cruisers, dictors and other small stuff but not capable of breaking through HAC/commands/T3s with logi support unless at equal or greater numbers. Bonus if that was the case: would nicely fix super/carrier ratting isk faucet.
---
3) AoE DD is similar to combat triage in that context, it's a way to work around numbers by skill (aiming boson/lance takes some practice and I've seen it miss a lot of times), and provides decent amount of counterplay (intel/spies, navigating around, HAC and commands can tank/evade AoE DDs decently well); it serves very similar role to bomber runs except works with less people while putting more valuable assets on field. It is abusable, but trying to "fix" that will remove the intended role of AoE DD while groups that abuse it will just switch to other ways of abusing region control and overall safety (like smartbomb titans/rorquals).
---
&gt; at the very least
---
I agree with that. I'm not against removing/reworking support fighters in the current meta.
---
As for Titan tracking... It can be indeed considered a "bug" and a such should be fixed, it won't change much but at least you can orbit a lone titan more safely.
---
What I'm hearing is "lower the ceiling".  There's no balancing this.  You have to get rid of caps completely to do it.
---
All this would lead to is your side dropping your own supercaps to hyperdunk the opposing side without the opposing side being able to do anything.
---
I don't think you want covops cloaking on a JF. This would result in the ability to warp cloaked like stratios,bombers etc.. similar to black ops battleships, which can jump to covert cynos, they could get a bonus to normal cloaks
---
And Alpha accounts should be able to fly all these completely worthless capitals you just mentioned.
---
Logistics like they used to? Launch a couple friends and keep them repped sounds fun to me.
---
Oh, I'd just delete capital size cap boosters and make people balance their fits between remote rep and remote cap transfer.
---
Did you have a 3 martini lunch? I agree with everything you said but given that it flies in the face of the changes CCP has made over the past few years I'm confused as why you're saying them. Glad you did, though.
---
enjoy it buddy, good chance that 200m is chump chang for the buyer
---
isn't it left clicking tho? It feels like that on muscle memory and i can't check in game now. Left click and hold
---
Because unlike most other companies, here at CCP we're encourage to have opinions and talk about them :P
---
It's also super fun to shoot the shit with you guys and talk shop, even if I don't work in design :D
---
Ahh okay, that makes more sense. Pretty smart move, can help cut down on potential oversaturation of basic materials while giving them a good outlet for the industrial machines.
---
The I-Win-Button for NCPL was patched out of the game in 2013 (no fatigue jumping). I heavily applauded that, between 2013 and early 2017 (Citadel patch) the game was healthy (especially because of Tiericide patches making more subcap classes viable again) ... and balanced not in favour of NCPL, it took a coalition of 50% of EVE to evict Goons, I would not call this onesided. There was a balance between PvE-Heavy-PLEXing groups and PvP-Heavy-subbing groups (that you could see in healthy PLEX-prices). After Citadel &amp; Lifeblood a lot of the PvP-Players quit the game, stopping to supply PLEX to the ingame market, while at same time every Goon and his mom started 10+-Multiboxing with PLEX. CCP fucked up the economic Meta of EVE by favouring 1 side too hard, the side that has no big interest in destroying but in farming and building. That lead to a huge devaluation of ISK (see PLEX price) and Ores (see Titan hull prices).
---
Downside is the ship starts to stink of stale piss and recycled air after a while.   
---
1. Use a stratios I guess, if you don't want to use the astero - but you won't catch many explorers with that I think, unless they're bad at it. 
---
2. I find baiting with some sort of a surprise backup will root out jerks - but you would find as you play that the definition of jerk becomes very ... dilluted
---
Prey not pray, just because it's you the inner grammar Nazi came out.
---
&gt; Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate.
---
Aren't supercaps unable to use ansiblex right now?
---
Lol k
---
&gt;I think this literally shouldnt be possible. 
---
I think you are dumb. And that the game should not protect you from that. It should instead endeavour to beat the dumb out of you.
---
supers and titans cant use the  ansiblex already. the mass restriction stops them form being able to
---
Well, this is basically the point I am subtly trying to make. For all their flaws, VNIs got some noobs into space and some volume into the food chain for solo and small gang hunters. 
---
Again, I recognise they also came with a lot of problems that need addressing.
---
But in a perfect world, it would be nice if the post-VNI universe had enough lucrative (and engaging) content and ship options that get as many people out into space as possible. If it’s only the big stuff, you alienate lower skilled null sec krabbers and give solo/small gang hunters less prey.
---
I like the idea of roving anomalies that krabbers need to hunt down (as opposed to set systems full of them), as this would tease people out into space.  And perhaps more clear grading of site difficulty vs. payoff, in the same way Sleeper sites in wh space work - making sites viable to lots of different levels of player and consequently creating a smorgasbord of prey types for hunters.
---
Honestly, I’m not looking for an easy meal here, but the food chain is important for the health of the universe!
---
Ccp doesn't understand null. They don't have a good sense of the big picture
---
I honestly can't remember offhand - if that's the case, then it's good. 
---
Ironically the ansiblex is one of the few structures I haven't really interacted with on a player level thus far.
---
damnn praise falcon our savior   
---
what you think about automated moon mining ? not the old one but something more weak like an ansiblex, no weapon 2 timer after the first one you can steal the fuel/moon goo 1-12h timer for the hull poor yield (refine the goo itself at 50% ?) maybe make them "cloak" this way you can attack and place some moon in an ennemy territory and you need to warp to the moon mining beacon and smartbomb to reveal them   
---
actually you can't attack big alliance athanor cause they offer them 72H to defend, and if you destroy one of them what the point ? you can't mine and pvp alliance don't want to mine anyway
---
Yes because that was totally a real thing and not the pilt being an asshole on comms and discord
---
They do have a CIWS currently. If they choose to fit a smart bomb or two.
---
The plan is also to attack hisec market and production structures
---
There is no "favouring" 1 side in any of the notes
---
The notes were released well before the patches, and NCPL had all the same oppurtunities
---
They started getting pissy when it meant they couldnt control who built supers and how they got them, before that the shot around the universe helicopter dicking on ANY fight they could get a cyno to
---
Rental empires waned, and local production boomed, they had the choice which was change or quit, they chose quit
---
Weirdly they were super happy when they could roam the galaxy padding billboards and swinging the capital dick about
---
you got pvp'd
---
It's only frowned upon if you are in a dread on day 1 and haven't ever played before. Buying Plex for isk to learn PvP with T1 ships in FW to avoid wasting time mining in highsec is okay.
---
Well no that's exactly the problem the danger of people hunting you no longer exists. People stopped doing that.  The player stopped fighting.  I'll.say this again nothing has ever stopped anyone pvping ever.   Years ago we had fights and roaming gangs all the time.  Simple fact is we moved from being a pvp focused player base to a PVE focused player base.  Drifters were filling that gap.  Also ita ridiculous that NPCs are just some thing going on somewhere these are supposed to be actual factions.  
---
Quite simply the alliances mindset needs to change to go back to pvp.  Before anomalies we seem to manage pretty well.
---
TBF this was completely independent IDK why we dropped shit hitting the same drum on the same day. We might go 1v1 in Kestrels or something now for the right to shitpost about Capitals.
---
The police cant kill frigates, so they probably just should make the whole game lowsec
---
You're right. There are multiple things that contribute to the fact that no new groups can establish themselves. Just this weekend I heard "higherups" in goonswarm joke that some new small group were stupid to try to ask us not to crush them because now we know about them so now they'll be crushed.  
---
While I'm sure this was a joke in their part in the end it most likely will happen because a large number of players will see them as easy prey and harass them untill they join up with one of the larger blocks.
---
Another problem is that entities that are affiliated with the larger coalitions can't really leave their cooperation (even on friendly terms) if they want to because there are other blocks that will just see that as an opportunity to farm them to death. There were a TIS episode where this was made obvious and the group that was accused of this behaviour just laugh it off and call them names.  
---
There's a reason almost everyone in null hates the same group and it's not just propaganda.  
---
While I say this I'm not putting all the blame on one group. It's a problem all blocks are guilty of. Everyone seems to just want easy kills and to get that they only engage in fights where they can win. It's a mentality that counteracts new groups ever establishing. Even though Goonswarm could afford to loose several times the amount other groups could afford fleet commanders are actively discouraged to engage in fights with even odds and it seems the same is true in other groups.   
---
I would understand this in real life because people aren't easily replaced but when it's in a game where the only thing lost is a ship that can be replaced immediately it just feels overly cautious.  
---
I'm nowhere near command so I might just not know how expensive it tbf.
---
I am personally completely for changing things to make it easier for new groups but almost all calls for change are things that in the end will hurt new groups more than it will hurt larger groups.  
---
Changes that make it harder for large groups only result in that it inconveniences the large groups and fucks over the small guy completely. And in the end just forces people into the larger group and the "stagnation" continues.  
---
Forcing large groups to spread out more will again inconvenience the larger groups but it will just force them to occupy more space and now suddenly new groups can't find space to establish themselves in.
---
There's often cries that Rorquals are too safe, that it's too easy to call for help. This is by design. This is how it's meant to be. The PANIC module is designed to create a system that encourages real PvP, not just an easy kill of a carebear. The problem here is that the guys who regularly go out and hunt carebears are to afraid to loose their expensive things because they don't have an easy way to replace them. They cry that it's too hard to kill Rorquals while not understanding that Rorquals aren't meant to be easy prey. They have to understand that When someone complain about not being able to kill a Rorqual in Delve they are literally complaing that they can't attack an entity that is many times their size. A small group of raiders aren't supposed to be able to do whatever they want in wellprotected space.
---
I was actually curious as to your lowsec cyno commnent from the previous post where you told us your ideas.
---
If capitals cannot use cynos anymore. What would you do with cynos in lowsec pockets? They'd essentially be trapped since there are no jump bridges in lowsec capitals can take either.
---
Your best defense is making sure your connections are rolled, your home hole watched (and pref rolled shut too) if you rat in your static and mjd-ing as soon as you see a new sig.   
---
Other than that not much would save you from a competent attacker. Ecm ships could help, but you'd need to be fast on the trigger as the sabre and teh fleet usually arrive very fast one after the other and you also have a targeting delay and a lock time on the ecm ship.   
---
Other than that, idk, try to fly cheap and own the losses as part of your ratting "balance"
---
I see you have no clue of the timelines the patches happened and changed the Meta, between the 2 things you put on the same platter there are 4 years ^^.
---
how about a dedicated  capital e war ship for cap's since boned  the super modules for super carriers we dont have ships based around that.   
---
ever that or just a non super command ship.
---
Exactly when NCPL was super cap heavy picking on everyone or when they would field 255 man carrier fleets for pretty much everything  then the meta  was OK wasnt it??!
---
Correct.  Only regular caps.
---
No matter how long there was between the patches they had all the same opportunities
---
They had space, they had members they had EVERYTHING
---
Stop making excuses for them
---
I like just about all of these suggestions (with the exception of the jump freighter stuff, which I'm kinda luke-warm on).
---
Honestly, these sound like really good ideas.
---
If you bring a comp specifically to fight carriers yes, you can fight a handful of carriers. But if carriers get cyno'd into everything then only those comps will be viable for anything. So instead of like 100 different comps to choose from when you go out on a roam you've only got 10.
---
End effect is that all across nullsec PVP gets pigeonholed into the same scenario: roamers bring trig shit or 100mn stuff to survive on grid with carriers so everyone jumps in supers because that stuff is cancer to fight. Brawling comps, MWD cruisers, battleships, BCs, all that stuff just rots away in people's hangars because it's useless once a few capitals show up.
---
My point is the effect this kind of thing has on the game goes beyond "Can I possibly fight it somehow?".
---
Because the AStero can be easily fit for insta warping this plus its very low skill requirements makes it a go too ship.
---
You can fit any of the other exploration ships in similar ways except without a covert ops cloak. Or you can use Covert Ops ships (the T2 versions of the exploration frigates) and fit them similarly to the T1 except with a covert ops cloak.
---
Covops frigates other than the astero can only really do one thing and that's scan. The astero can do some fighting which is why there's a variety of fits for it.
---
Of course it was, the game wasnt broken at all was it?
---
And how PL was unassailable because they held no space, but made HUGE money off moon goo and rental
---
I always just called that ratio the reduced tracking, and its actually the only tacking number that matters
---
As much as I like you're outfits, you're probably gonna lose the right to shitpost if you go that way.
---
Do relic cans still "shoot out" extra loot you have to click after a successful hack (as opposed to just opening the cargo)?
---
Nah I'll just fit a cyno and bring in a Mino alt
---
Faxes have also fucked over heavy armor brawls in wormhole space.
---
You have a set amount of mass to bring through a hole and the team that brings dreads and logi  is the team to consistently lose to the team that brought fax.
---
That but with a few smaller changes:
---
* reduce the number of drones that carriers/supers can field but give them damage/health bonuses (similar to Guristas ships) so that the servers can handle them better
---
* Nerf RR when out of siege to stop slowcats.
---
woah most of this stuff looked like a ton of fun
---
No.
---
If you want resources, get off your ass and gather them. It should be a group activity - that said, I do agree that it should be more fun. It'd be interesting to see what it'd be like to introduce randomness into mining, the ability to get various yields by chance with each cycle of a mining laser for instance, so you always have a base, but can sometimes "crit" based on skill. Would make it a little more interactive I guess. I'd like to see mining a more active and inclusive kinda gameplay.
---
Personally, I'd also rip out the ability for Rorquals and Orcas to mine. I'd give the orca a huge ass compressed ore hold and turn it into an ore freighter, and the rorqual into a big resource management platform so that when it went into siege, it was super effective at compressing and refining ore, and giving huge mining bonuses to barges (for both ice and ore). Give each of the ships a defined role so they perform as part of a whole. 
---
I'd also delete the whole panic module, get rid of it, and prevent the rorqual from being able to use stargates and fit a cyno too. It'd be treated as as super and would serve as a mobile refinery and mining platform that needed support to be effective.
---
Honestly I don't think we need changes this drastic.  Most of the changes that have been made are in the right direction.  It's just that the iteration time on them is *ridiculously* long.
---
There are much easier and simpler changes that can be made to accomplish this stuff.  Deleting HAW guns and a lot of the extra super/titan weapons is a great start though.
---
In that case AT ships should probably wreck supers.
---
Have you seen the screenshot? But I actually know the dude and he did get kicked for that.
---
CO2 was losing the war before Judgement Day, that just sealed the deal in a particularly spectacular way. 
---
Black Legion talked so much smack, and now they're a member corp protecting botters in an alliance led by a credit card warrior who got banned for RMT. Classy.
---
PL hasn't done shit since UALX, unless you want to count bleeding members and corps. Horde appears to be running that show.
---
We both agree on TRI. What a shitshow.
---
But hey, don't take my word for it. Take your shot, come at us. Worst case scenario is I laugh at you again. Best case scenario, you evict us and we can finally get over this krabbing and empire building bullshit.
---
CCP Falcon confirmed as a space trucker? ;)
---
I'm fine with that.
---
Standard caps would still be able to move around via stargates - so they could still travel no worries, just with more risk and needing some support.
---
Supers would end up land-locked, so I'd look to relocate them all to their nearest nullsec NPC station on the day the changes were introduced, if they were ever introduced.
---
Do you have ~350b lying around?
---
Genius post. I did it just because I can't buy my old characters back. If I wasn't a vet, I can see how this would totally fuck me.
---
Bring back combat refitting!
---
Kiki has some issues, but when flown with the right support ships it can be devastatingly effective. Especially against capital ships.
---
And they had a playing style, grown over 14 years for some, the game offered a balance between these styles, and they destroyed that balance with Lifeblood, literally by weaponizing autism (the one who afk-multiboxes the most grind wins the game). Also these guys are the ones that pay money to ccp to supply the ingame market with the PLEX your type of player dearly needs to sub ... but I see, those economic facts are too hard for you
---
I might have to make that happen with some overtime. If that is what it comes to. But I am not a fan of cash for eve supremacy.
---
it may help their own application, but you can't apply when they are off grid, and the ideal would be that the Carrier while excelling against sub cap ships. Should require a support fleet to keep engaged enemy assets lock down for the carrier to do it's work.   
---
I don't inherently have a problem with a ship helping their own application...almost every fit has something that increases it's damage/application. It is the capital being able to also tackle that I agree is the crux of the issue.
---
Speaking of memes
---
looks like you are in the wrong alliance.  No blues makes for a target rich environment and little drama.
---
Not really.  The cost is related to the amount of materials that go into them.  AT ship value is simply rarity.
---
What an absolute unit!
---
This is a recipe for how to break a thousand and one things in an instant.
---
Falcon you just proof to everyonne here you don't know you're own game :"  6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate.  " =&gt; ALREADY THE CASE
---
If titan have just boost role and lance , let me be clear : you will se a lot less (so a lot less will be kill), and beacause a lot less you will see a lot less super.... So less content. 
---
Remove all cap and super rating, i m ok : bring back local, remove cloack, and all way to stay in ennemy system without be shoot. Not for perfect safety , but beacause people prefer farm in big ship only beacause they could survive to 200 bomber. YOu can't in subcap. If you want to dekete eve : go toyou're main server  and execute this command it will be faster:
---
cd /
---
rm -rf \*
---
Possibly in a situation where you have exactly 20k dps, less then 700 gj/s of neuting and infinite time. That situation will still probably take an hour to break the MR though.
---
Because it is creating longer Client Response times like mass dropped drones.
---
&gt; Honestly I don't think we need changes this drastic.
---
Yes we do - absolutely. The meta needs a serious kick in the balls to get things rolling again.
---
Personally, I'm pissed off with the status quo, and I want to see shit burning again.
---
"Easy", "Simple" and "Small" changes don't cut it any more. "Iterating" is for when you have a healthy game. 
---
We don't have a healthy game right now in terms of the nullsec PvP meta, and we shouldn't pretend that we do.
---
Relevant *and* funny, nice
---
They give killmails so... Kill them?
---
&gt; I remember the good old days when
---
Hurricane fleets were a thing. When a swarm of Ruptures actually scared the guys tooling around in dessies. When a falcon actually jammed you (actually, I don't miss that much), when a dramiel was the scariest ship and cost 100Mil. When a BS could warm to a gate in under an hour. When you could fit out a cruiser with no tank, insta lock, and alpha guns to zap bugs.
---
My solution would be undo most of the T1/T2 nerfs from the last several years. Nerf titans, supers, and HAW dreads (carriers aren't as good as people complain about post last nerf). While doing this, delete or heavily the stupid new ships that are basically T-4s and buff ships that were made useless by a combination of power creep in the newer subs and in caps. 
---
The scope of a change needs to be less focused. Nerfing a single ship while ignoreing why it's being used the way it has been is silly.
---
Oh, and delete panics, take Rorqs down to boosting and normal drones with better bonuses than an orca but nothing like an orca and five barges. Maybe add a BS barge to compensate for the slower goo production (a rorq is the only way to get the production of a single tower mining rig).
---
just go undercover. Call yourself rook, nobody will suspect anything.
---
Half of null would still be empty though
---
You guys still dont get the difference between 2013 (when Phoebe ended NCPL dominance with jump fatigue) and 2017 (When Lifeblood destroyed the Eve economy)?
---
You mean the "we have big toys so no one else can" playstyle?
---
The one that was rooted in rental space and moon empires?
---
The playstyle THEY fostered embraced a "first past the post" mentality where if they kept OTHER entities supers from growing they could effectively control the whole game
---
It left vast swathes of space empty,or rented whilst they were untouchable due to having no roots or infrastructure to attack
---
All CCP did was level the playing field, NCPL did the Eve equivalent of "im taking my ball and going home"
---
Nothing was taken away from them at all, just more opportunities were given to the rest
---
The rest of the playerbase adapted, they didnt and that is more telling than anything
---
I'm sure there's issues with it lurking somewhere, but I'd be keen for it.
---
Get in there nice and deep-like
---
&gt; "Easy", "Simple" and "Small" changes don't cut it any more.
---
They're easy, simple, and small from the development work required, but they can have huge effects on the meta.  Much like the nullsec blackout didn't require a ton of dev time, but had large positive effects.
---
Think about what increasing the fighter MWD cooldown does and how easy it is to make that change.
---
Holy shit a CCP employee just posted my ideas and gets upvotes instead of shit on. Amazing.
---
You sound nice.
---
Concord absolutely can kill frigates. You were ganked in a .5 system, which means they take a long time to respond. Long enough for a handful of bombers to kill a vindicator, apparently.
---
If you're looking for a game where you literally can't die, eve is not for you. If you undocked in a ship you weren't comfortable losing, in any space, that's on you.
---
Yes. VNIs were engageable, but far from free kills, for small ships. Neuting domis are something you NEED a gang for, or specific double cap injected fits. Stabbed or MJD neuting domis are almost impossible to engage, period. 
---
It might be possible to do things with a crazy nos fit or something, but you also have to consider tanking the domi and the site, which will create even more pressure on your cap. You also need to find enough dps to KILL the damn thing.
---
Obviously the best way to do this is some kind of brick tanked cap injected T3 with a covert cyno and a pair of scrams, and you blops bombers in.
---
I do think we need to seriously rework anoms
---
&gt;10 frigates vs ... 10 T3 Cruisers ... just to speed up a bit
---
This is the point where the 10 frigates should run.
---
&gt; People skilled up or injected in whatever they want to use ... and they have right to use it. 
---
The problems start when two players meet in space.
---
&gt; But CCP should make areas when no one can use the capital ships 
---
You mean outside high-sec, shattered whs and Thera?
---
&gt; Like tell me **why the hell should i fly frigates if i don't like it?** 
---
Nobody should force you you to fly frigates, but there should be reasons for you to partner up with someone who does to accomplish certain tasks.
---
Caps get a penalty to spoolup like in entosis?
---
no bubbles, gate and station guns to deter weaker attempts at camping. lowsec is not somewhere you can force fights as easily as you do in "pvp space".
---
for a duck test to happen, a definition of "duck" must exist, and "as long as it quacks" is not enough.
---
&gt; 6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate.
---
this is already the case, isn't it?
---
I mean at the time I was in a smallish Empire Alliance fighting POCO and POS wars with Dead Terrorists and other Metropolis groups. We had some good fights but certainly weren’t wiping any floors and suffered a fair amount of losses.
---
The fun was in mostly subcapital battles with the occasional hesitant capital escalation from both sides. Which occasionally ended with a big bad PL cyno and a hotdrop that neither side anticipated or wanted.
---
The mercy nature of capital escalations and the rarity of their presence made them truly excited and epic. You knew shit was going down if people were asked to login dread or triage toons.
---
r/evejobs
---
Good luck
---
I have not found much that can even threaten a kiki 1v1 unless it's shitfit. Watcha got for me?
---
Pls, If you want people to read it you should better condense your wealth of information. This is too long!
---
&gt; And how PL was unassailable because they held no space, but made HUGE money off moon goo and rental not to mention HUGE isk injections every year from the tournament
---
Clueless shittalking like all your posts in this thread, we started right after Phoebe patch in 2013 to take ALL money moons of our region with 2 small alliances with under 600 characters in total (about 50 RL people) One time a year PL or NC deployed, took some back, lost some ships and lost the moons again 2 days after they left ....
---
So effectively my point stands, thanks for your input though
---
You'll never change the mind of these people like Jintaan, if it's not something that benefits them, they want it destroyed or a counter handed to them on a silver platter.
---
So pretty much all the pacific collisions?
---
or the USS Cole attack?
---
I see the `/s` tag, but for those that don't...
---
SP affects login behaviour. It doesn't affect in-space behaviour. The question is; is CCP more interested in one over the other?
---
A target painter doesn't do much.
---
The window lickers here will all suggest RLML boats, because that's what you do when you never go more than 5 jumps from staging and there's a frigate on intel
---
For a truly versatile solo roaming cruiser platform, you need a combination of smaller guns, nuet, and a web. A rupture can definitely do the job if well handled, with 220s and a web.
---
Another old fisherman's secret... if you've got frigates burning toward you to tackle you... Don't tackle them back immediately... they'll probably be sig-bloomed from their own MWD, which would shut off the second you land your scram... go ahead and turn on your guns and let them eat that damage.... then scram them once they start getting into their orbit. You'll be pleasantly surprised at just how quickly a frigate will melt if you do this.
---
&gt; Falcon you just proof to everyonne here you don't know you're own game :" 6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate. " =&gt; ALREADY THE CASE
---
Wow, I've been playing seventeen years and I got one thing wrong from one recently introduced mechanic that I don't really interact with - the sky is falling.
---
&gt; If titan have just boost role and lance , let me be clear : you will se a lot less (so a lot less will be kill), and beacause a lot less you will see a lot less super.... So less content.
---
Good, that's the whole fucking point - there are TOO MANY TITANS IN EVE - let me say that again - **THERE ARE TOO MANY TITANS IN EVE - THERE IS TOO MUCH SUPERCAP PROLIFERATION.**
---
The whole idea is to reduce the number of them on grid and get those people who were flying them into smaller, more role focused hulls. 
---
&gt; Remove all cap and super rating, i m ok : bring back local, remove cloack, and all way to stay in ennemy system without be shoot. 
---
So basically give you a safety blanket for making ISK? Nope. You want to make massive amounts of ISK? Take the **risk** to earn it.
---
&gt; Not for perfect safety , but beacause people prefer farm in big ship only beacause they could survive to 200 bomber. 
---
If someone forms up **TWO HUNDRED BOMBERS** to kill a single target, then fair play to them, they deserve a shot at killing something - THAT is content, not AFK anomaly ratting in a super.
---
Maybe not deleting, but complicating use of boson a little could be okay. Even simple "cycle starts when you click and start aiming, you have 10s of spoolup or it'll shoot in whatever direction" would make it much more punishing to use unless you're really good at aiming (rewarding learning how to use your ship well). And sheer potential of accidentally bosoning friendlies it'd add would make this kind of change 100% worth, if just for ability for a bad pilot to actively harm their own group.
---
Amen - just watched Andy Virus' VNI on the test server.  VNI is a serious can o' woopass.
---
Do unallocated Skillpoints count towards the reduction of Skillpoints gained from skill injectors?
---
You are here crying that nullsec folks are shitting on you. Sounds like you want safety.
---
Not sure what angle you are getting at here. But if i were to follow the analogy, yes if in real life, god brought you back to life if you were murdered.
---
You do realize you are asking for limited AT tournament ships here?
---
I love the goon taunt
---
hahahaha &lt;3
---
I'm a Diplomat for GSF, we are most definitely not doing as you claim. Lying doesn't look good on you.
---
Lmao
---
Looks like i hit a sore spot
---
Sorry i dont fit your narrative, but the history speaks for itself
---
EVERY player and alliance has the same opportunities, yet 2 of them are now jokes and dead
---
Of course there are issues with it, it was me who wrote it.
---
That said, the stuff listed there is only part of a package of changes that'd be needed imo.
---
You know all those times you read "don't undock what you can't afford to lose?"
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers
---
Ya lets fucking take away everything from titans and make them even more shit. sounds like a plan. "no offensive Combat" ya lets take the end game goal and make it useless for other than bridging and for fleets and unable to defend its self.
---
😏
---
&gt; I don't know if Sapo would get mad at me for cyno'ing in my own carrier
---
If you don't try to SRP it, and go to fleet six to joke about you're own leroy jenkins moment, I imagine he'd just laugh at you.
---
you should be in charge of game development
---
Better than most suggestions that get posted.
---
What about just a BS sized logi, wouldn't even need to rep much more that the cruisers just having a BS level tank would be good and right now only the Nestor really fills that.
---
dasro please stop posting, thanks!
---
Its fine. Unlike alot of games where 'P2W' has a stigma, the playerbase in eve tends to have more understanding about time issues and generally doing what you want with your time. Personally, i hate ratting and love PVP, as a result, every few months i sell some plex for isk to fund my PVP habits. If your just starting, buy LOTS of small and cheap stuff, then do stupid shit in it without caring about the loss, if you buy something expensive and big, it will really hurt you if it goes boom (which it will, eve will find a way).
---
Just try not to get hooked on skillpoint injection...
---
Wow!!! I think my last braincell killed itself
---
I see you are confused, still mixing up 2013 and 2017 ... keep drinking your alliance leaders koolaid i am fine with it. I know that all you say is bullshit from an uninvolved bystander, and my playstyle since 2013 is the literal proof. BTW there is no difference between people like you or NCPL people in earlier days. Your behaviour on th krab meta starting from 2017 is the same elitist behaviour NCPL pilots sported until 2013. Its PvE elitist vs. PvP elitist ... I laugh about both of you  ...
---
Capital neuts/nos have a signature radius factor, which reduces the effectivness of the module against subcaps. 
---
Capitals reppers should totally have that as well so bringing a FAX to a subcap fight isn't, as you said, an instant I-Win button.
---
I can afford to replace it. I just dont want to.
---
 "
---
&gt;Not for perfect safety , but beacause people prefer farm in big ship only beacause they could survive to 200 bomber.
---
If someone forms up **TWO HUNDRED BOMBERS**  to kill a single target, then fair play to them, they deserve a shot at  killing something - THAT is content, not AFK anomaly ratting in a  super."
---
You can't AFK rat in super ... No really go test it. You can't. 
---
If you afk you're fighter do nothing and just die to NPC. If they stop moving, npc shoot they. You can't be afk ratting in super. 
---
You proof again, you don't know the game mechanics. Maybe you want we go in test server, and i explain to you how super works. Maybe could help you. Beacause i think you read a lot reddit and you trust a lot of people who are grrrrrr super/carrier/else. But a lot of this people do'nt know mechanics at all so ... 
---
For the 200 bomber, how bad are you? No really how bad are you to know you're own game? It happen like everyday, and it's whya  lot of people stop using subcap during blackout. You kill content, you do'nt create cobntent.
---
More over you're change create more game mechanics problem than it solve ( A LOT MORE). If you want we can debat of why this change will just make the game badest for pvp , and make actual superpower unkillable. But for that i need you to learn how mechanics work. Go test server you and me ?
---
That was his alternate fix, the main one was just removing support fighters
---
The point of the entire thread is "make small gangs great again".
---
Supercapital are always supported by one or more subcap fleets unless in a home defense setting.
---
So the only people complaining about unsupported capitals are those that come into someone's space and expect them to meet on the field with a force they can fight, and not get streamrolled by Marc and his 20 titans friends.
---
Guess what ? People don't care what you are expecting. Someone used USA as an example : do you believe USA would meet you on the field without any tank because you don't have any ?
---
Yea, yea, it's a game. Fact is : it is also for the other guy you don't want to use their supercapital because it's op. Get some dreads and shitface them, or get out.
---
&gt; Stabbed 
---
That should be the next nerf. CCP either need to restrict them to haulers and miners or get rid of them altogether.
---
What is the procedure for us players to get you elected as dictator-in-chief of CCP?  I'd love to see this vision move forward instead of the current dumpster fire that is all things capital-related.
---
well, it's just about the dps and also risk. The oracle gets good dps and costs little. The only downside is that it needs t2 large lasers.   
---
you can use t1 lasers as well, but it will take awhile. Anyways it's kind of your best bet - takes a few hours i think with a single oracle
---
&gt; Looks like i hit a sore spot
---
Yes uninformed stupid narrative posting sporting obvious lies hits a nerve ...
---
Should have had a Mining Permit.
---
Your idea is bad and you should feel bad.
---
another way this could have happened, that i didn't see listed here so far, is multibuying a lot of stuff:
---
say, your industry tool gave you a list of items needed to build something: total buy price for raw materials 50b
---
you check ingame multibuy, it tells you total is 50.3b. you click buy, as it's close enough to the estimate and you'll be making 10b profit from that.
---
eve notifies you that some item is overpriced, are you sure you want to do this?
---
you get annoyed by the message box, as you don't want to sort through that shit to save a measly 300m or whatever, i want my stuffs now.
---
someone, down the line, gets a windfall for selling 200 items usually worth 100k for 1m a piece now, as the person needed 300 such items and the 300th cheapest item was listed for 1m
---
looks like you've been subjected to some elite-pvp.
---
I dunno, it depends on what kinda role it would fill to be honest.
---
In my eyes at least there's no need for a BS size logistics hull when logi cruisers can hold their own pretty solidly and carriers would fill the gap for caps and supers.
---
Could be interesting, but I don't see the need really :)
---
Wait what. Sorry stupid question, but where do you see this info? I always thought minmitar drones had beat tracking as I was only looking at the turret tracking number on the attributes tab of the drone
---
&gt; 13 days of omega training time (so 26 alpha) to train a VNI to basic competency atm. If you have one right now it will take another 14 days omega (28 alpha) to train into a dominix.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The myrmidon will depend. If you want to try and fit it to speed tank it would be only a couple days alpha time to train but if you want to fit it like you would fit a dominix for this kind of ratting it would take just about as long as the dominix because most of that tim
---
Someone who is already decently skilled to use a VNI can be in a somewhat less optimal domi in the same day and be running full tilt in a few more.
---
thanks a lot for your help, now im ready to bash some POCOs
---
o7 pilot
---
I just don't think an expensive "end game" battleship should be killable by a bunch of alts in 30m frigates should be a thing. At least  not less than two or three dozen. I would probably complain if that happened as well
---
&gt; they had all the same opportunities the rest have had 
---
Hmm, I wonder if before 2017 Goons had the same opportunities like PL or NC but did not use them, just an idea ... (2 seconds LOGICAL thinking)
---
...of poop
---
What do you dislike about it?
---
and in three months: 
---
Tranquility - Online (9 Players).
---
k by
---
Some of this makes a lot of good sense. Super ratting would already be killed by the application changes. Carrier ratting with sentries would still work, but if you want to rat aligned you'd need to boat away from your sentries. Danger, danger! (we like danger)
---
Cynos being restricted to null makes sense, you don't see NPC cynos.
---
Change FAX into a "mobile POS" of sorts. Make it so they have an achor time, and when it's done they become a structure where players can dock up, with the similar capabilities of a citadel but squishier.
---
You REALLY are doubling down on this arent you
---
I quit 3 years ago
---
I have no horse in this race
---
I am speaking facts, i have played since 2003 and know my eve history well
---
You seem REALLY butthurt over this, EX NC/PL member perhaps?
---
The immutable fact is that ALL players had the same opportunities
---
ALL players, and hell if you want to be a dick over it, NC/PL even kicked goons out the north and ground down the player count in CFC to a few thousand, yet they STILL got kicked to the curb with the HUGE advantage they had
---
They got out gamed, and their own fault they are literally dead now
---
Honestly fed up reading this pish.
---
The state of the game is because of CCP.
---
We the players told CCP all about this way back that Supercarriers (motherships at the time) and Titans was retarded to add to the game but they bulldozed ahead anyway, "There won't be many titans or motherships in the game". EvE players being the autists that we are said challege accepted and proved them wrong.
---
Problem after problem CCP keeps lurching to and we the playerbase go "REEEEEEEEEE", some do it more than others, some do it much louder than others due to whatever playstyle they have suffering or being dealt a deathblow. If CCP want to fix caps then they have to go back to the drawing board with a clear plan and vision and actually listen to the ones who have a good knowledge of them and their playstyle (sorry jin but this ain't you), there has to be a wipe of them, take them off the table entirely, reimburse SP, costs etc etc
---
There will be alot of REEEEEEE from people who love using them (like myself) but I get the problem of them but at the same time it moves back to the problems of old and current which is n+1 (never ever going to be a solution to this I'm afraid).
---
Also current grandstading of certain CCP employees lately does no help to the arguement due to alot of bias from them since two of the most vocal were low players who from public knowledge never went with the Null empire style and playing. Same goes for the small gang "REEEEEEEE" eve "famous".
---
My 2cents and no fucks given :D
---
Reza thought he lost a hel, sounds like a great CEO, can't even type in zkill's URL.
---
you need to hit above 500 dps I think - that's the shield's regen. Good luck  
---
(cue a single oracle bashing one of my own pocos :))) )
---
I don't really understand what you're trying to get at here other than raging at me because you don't like what I'm suggesting because it'd affect your play style.
---
You do you bud, that's all I can say, really!
---
So prey tell, where are the lies?
---
Then why would the frigates even exist? Not only is the "smaller ships shouldn't kill bigger ships" thought just wrong, that particular frigate *excels* at it. That's the purpose of stealth bombers.
---
So why shouldn't ships that excel at killing battleships, be able to kill a battleship?
---
&gt;  Eve is based on rock paper scissors
---
Not really, and its a very bad idea to balance like that.
---
&gt; Carrier ratting with sentries would still work, but if you want to rat aligned you'd need to boat away from your sentries. 
---
Not if carriers had no local reps :)
---
No I don't because there never was a fight over the Azbel :)))
---
&gt;Lets take the titan and make it even more fucking useless than it already is and penalize solo dropping/small group titan instead of large block titans. "No offensive weapons"... "In terms of weapons, the lance itself I'd keep traditionally targeted, but it wouldn't do damage to the target it had locked. Instead, when activated it'd slice a path through space to the target that would deal colossal damage, so you'd need to rely on positioning to use it to its highest level of effectiveness, and you could chain them between two allied vessels to catch people between them" more titans you have the better!! great idea and im sure that would work great and really reduce how large blocks use them.
---
read the thread, I exposed all of them, but I guess your basic economic knowledge outside of EVE and your meta knowledge inside are your limiting factors in understanding.
---
Goons had no issues flourishing before 2017
---
NC/Pl seem to NOT be flourishing post 2017
---
one side seems more adaptable based on this no?
---
Missiles kinda have this, but everything else: yeah
---
Wrong a kitsune jams the two guaradian's... balanced rock paper scissors subcap counterplay v. 1 fax no = no non cap counter.
---
&gt; Goons had no issues flourishing before 2017
---
Wait, didnt you say until 2017 NCPL did "helicopterdick" on every cyno?
---
It should be...
---
You mean that all players got the same opportunities?
---
And that all you have done is screeched "NO YOU" throughout the thread?
---
You've done nothing of the sort Its rather amusing
---
Sadly I think you can't plex your way out of the grind as lvl 4 agents don't magically appear after plexing you need to still grind the reputation to unlock them
---
Ignore the 1337twats - and congratulations on winning EvE.
---
It makes perfect sense with dictors, they are a specialized ship designed to tackle everything within 20km.  
---
Hell, surgical warp probes were designed specifically for holding a capital down longer per bubble deployed...not that anyone actually uses them.  
---
But then again, I'm biased as fuck.  Fuck capitals, fuck supers.
---
What changes have you thought up about SOV and the powerblocks?
---
It's very weak to being defanged by kiters, like most slow blaster brawlers, so I don't expect it to see that much overall play, but it's certainly the king of the medium plex.
---
You guys have a wall of swords, time to put them to use :)
---
Also nobody actually put any skillpoints into FAX, the EVE players stopped you guys from doing it when you announced the capital changes.
---
Yeah, for sure battleships need some love to be honest.
---
Would be interesting to set them apart by tier - make a tier more suited to fast attack with a warp speed bonus and faster lock speed, make a set that are more attuned to attacking caps, and a set that are more focused toward a support/EW role... could be really interesting.
---
Thanks, this is exactly the kind of response I was looking for. My CEO also does server hosting, but if that doesn't work out I'll probably hit you up.
---
Are you telling a dev how game mechanics work?
---
You lose all mobility and can't reposition on grid. That's not a good thing for a small gang.
---
Which is dumb as all you get is predetermined fights or nothing since A is hard countered by B, and B is worried about C and C cant touch A.
---
The real problem is injectors and the fact that some things are simply overpowered.
---
They did, didnt stop goons flourishing though
---
i'll bash who i want to bash until shit decisions stop being made about this game tbqh and fuck you for trying to stop me
---
And everyone liked that.
---
Force Auxillaries as a large cap sized command ship could be interesting, for sure.
---
Do you even Google?
---
&gt; The destroyer's rules of engagement, as approved by the Pentagon, kept her guards from firing upon the small boat (which was not known to be loaded with explosives) as it neared them without first obtaining permission from Cole's captain or another officer
---
If you're going to speak from ignorance, you should actually look at the full battle report:  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004583/201907211600/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004583/201907211600/) 
---
Guardians can be booshed, which we had a boosher there. You can't boosh a FAX. Guardians can also be jammed by EC drones and you can break reps that way. Again, FAX can't be EWAR'd. They can only be bumped and neuted. Which, with how 3200's and cap boosters work, you need multiple bhaals to keep one zero'd out. As they can just inject at 0 cap and rep no problem.
---
There no was no incorrect judgement, the drake cyno'd in a fax to attempt to the save the barghest, but we killed it before the fax could lock it. The drake was also nearly dead as well, but the FAX topped it off. It was only when they brought in reinforcements that we tricked the FAX into repping other ships and splitting reps that we were able to alpha the drake. We made the correct judgement and still won the fight, that doesn't change the fact that FAX are dumb.
---
I do'nt said you must do'nt change it. 
---
I said you propose change WITHOUT know mechanics. It's why you're actual change are just bullshit. Sorry to said that, but before propose change you need to understand mechanics. 
---
It's like i will go to nasa, and said replace you're reactor  by some diesel motor i think it will work better.  (and no it will not work for a lot of obvious reason).
---
So really it's a porposition to improve you're comprehension of mechanics: go on test server, andtry game mechanics (or in true server in dev space if you want teleport me).  and we will make some test to explain each game mechanics.  And after you will be abble to propose change and know what they will imply.
---
I guess my understanding of highsec ganking was about 6 years dated. I thought tornados were used to alpha things before Concord could step in. So I was a bit shocked when I saw 12 frigates sit in front of 15 Concord for 20 seconds and do literally nothing.
---
Didn't want your ignorant toxicity in my subscriber base anyway.
---
You could go hunt them to make it dangerous?
---
&gt; You seem REALLY butthurt over this, EX NC/PL member perhaps?
---
Totally wrong, NCPL-hater from the start, actually in that time you say that NCPL "helicopterdicked" on everybody I was actually taking ALL NCPL-R64 of my homeregion (over 30) with 50 RL-People, hunting and killing NCPL supers. They werent untouchable especially since 2013, but you had to have a brain, that your post are obv. missing ...
---
Too bad that won't get implemented in any form for another 2 years
---
Oh man, that'd be another long ass post hahaha
---
Tristans, plz.
---
Are we really going again thru this? Because if you read all those posts carefully it wasn't even me who kicked the guy, I wasn't there. I just took the blame for the team. That's what type of CEO I am.
---
I meant the hull model. I agree with Falcon for the actual FAX class. Delete it.
---
Order 66 is joining PL to my knowledge.
---
Thanks for the confidence, but I'm not a trained game designer - just a dude who loves EVE haha :)
---
If people can instantly tell if they will win or lose a fight, there will be no fight.
---
Rock, paper, scissors is low level balancing. It can never work.
---
I have a feeling someone else here is brainwashed with extra white.
---
Hmm, your article is well written and the ideas good. But I do have 2 issues with it, one is what you are mentioning here. In theory, I would agree. In reality, I think it would be a bitch. I feel that in that scenario, you would be forced to grind both offensively and defensively. On the offensive part its the defenders advantage (sov grind) and on the defensive its the attackers advantage (defense fleets). None of these are fun and stacking them would, imo, mean that one will get neglected. And you cant really neglect home so Id reckon the game would just become even more stale with no offensive warfare. And if you force people to do offensive warfare I think you would just burn people out.
---
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, why? Why is this a problem? 
---
Let me paint a picture, you are walking down the street and you see a guy trying to fight someone ten times his size, a literal giant in comparison. Would you help him by trying to cut the giant down to a reasonable size or would you just tell the guy that he should fight someone his own size?
---
I would tell him to fight someone his own size. Think most would. Yet when it comes to Eve most, atleast on this sub, argues to cut the giant down. You see the issue Im having? Why? Why should the small gang flying smaller ships not get pounced by bigger ships? That content gets denied on purpose so we can do our own thing. Why should we be pestered?
---
I understand that you believe this to be better for the game but lets say 10% is small gang and 40% is NS. If the 10% get a bit happier but you make 40% a bit unhappy, thats still a netloss when it comes to the games health. I just dont understand why this trade should happen.
---
Imo, LS and WH roamers in NS are as relevant as HS roamers are to LS and WHs. Instead of constantly trying to mix the different types, perhaps its better to enable them to fight amongst themselves instead? 
---
Why cut giants down when you can just tell the guy to fight someone his own size? And let the giants fight the other giants.
---
thing is, there are no "mats" that ships that require normal ore(minerals) other than those minerals, for caps it's capital components but those are 10k m3 each so no one sells/moves those, for T2 ships the cost of T1 hull in minerals in the final ship is negligible at best and T1 ships are made from minerals with no intermediate components...
---
How about the BPCs. 
---
Seriously, get rid of the fucking cap BPOs or some of their components. Have the BPCs be drop looot from data sites (that'd make them worth running too).
---
It s so tricky to balance, they nerf cotas and suddenly big blobs can defend theirs but the poor sob in lowsec with 3 asshouse gets murdered.
---
Support fighters like dromis and sirens have nowhere near the impact that you seem to believe that they do. Before the fighter changes, we'd simply have office points/webs/scrams and skirmish links on one of the supers. We'd also have fleets like proteuses and lokis whose sole purpose was to provide tackle. Abyssal rolls allow people to have the same old tackle ranges that we used to before the links nerf. This is me and a friend "policing" nerds in 2015 in our supers:
---
https://youtu.be/pgn234rE8LA?t=1086
---
We did this quite commonly. I suspect if you changed the support fighters in the way that you want, you'd probably like the resulting system even less.
---
Much like your face. Everyone likes that too &lt;3
---
Markets are dangerous business. One tim I put an extra 0 on a sell order. That zero cost me 1.5 billions in broker fees and taxes that disappeared into the nether.
---
Endgame battleship?  What game are you playing dude ???
---
/o\ I give up, you are really clueless ...
---
It's pretty easy for us, especially if we've been playing for years before alpha accounts existed, but I'd imagine it's gotta be pretty disappointing for a new player.
---
Some other "pay-to-win" games (World of Tanks, League of Legends) just make the free version grindy as hell BUT you technically have the capability to unlock everything you want without paying. Eve's f2p option is a trial account, it's obviously better than nothing but presenting it as free-to-play is misleading. In the majority of games these days, "free-to-play" usually means a grindier experience with a little less content whereas an alpha account is basically a demo for the real game.
---
&gt;See, for me it would be easy to drop a super on a nano cruiser gang or a lone roaming frigate, but I choose not to do so . 
---
When players have to hold back, you know the game is broken.
---
Well it’s a limited ship , either invest time to get multiple hundred of billion isk or credit card ftw
---
5 min cyno delay time.
---
Ah Reza the man himself. You kicked him because you thought he lost a hel he then went on to defend himself and you only realized it was a niddy after. I think your exact words were " oh oops lmao he was a prick anyway"
---
The community has not forgotten your sins
---
HAW titans should not exist. Period.
---
Leave that for dreads.
---
Unfortunately I can read, otherwise i wouldn't be responding to your autistic scribbling
---
Taking a few  null moons was hardly a feat, when they were mostly based in low sec and controlled a larger portion of the moons
---
That and the huge rental empire
---
You can keep sperging or accept that your account of events was different
---
I don't understand how that makes sense still.
---
You're arguing that 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 3. So you suggest a change that would make 1 plus 1 equal 2.. but would also be fine with a change that makes 1 plus 1 equal 3 still, albeit with an asterisk.
---
There should be no ".. at the very least." It should be all or nothing.
---
&gt;Of course, these changes are just my thoughts personally, I'm not a game designer and most of them are terrible, but I'd also couple them with a few fundamental changes to how caps deploy too.
---
Terrible?  Oh contraire.... this is EXACTLY what Eve needs to become more vibrant.  Fax were a mistake, AoE and HAW were mistakes.  Capital superiority have stagnated Eve and the changes you describe are going to improve life not just in nullsec but in lowsec as well.
---
I agree, and feel like we need supertitans or some other ships that challenge the infrastructure of our current nullblocs.
---
Reading comprehension ... dude get it
---
Falcon saying it how it is!! Goddamn I love you and your no bullshit communication. So refreshing to hear from a CCP rep.
---
Thanks, it feels a lot like arguing with senior baseball fans
---
And never did.
---
"Grr gons" 
---
yup
---
So the elephant cant be touched? Then what is the point? Why do new players need carriers? Or are injectors no longer for new players?
---
If they refuse to do something about capital injection, we might as well give up.
---
Yes. I have even alliance tournamented.
---
Being smart can often be mistaken as risk aversion so i mean the smart guys :)
---
Wat ?
---
The thing with carriers... Doesn't having fighters with multiple roles make sense? I mean aircraft carriers do and they have their own weapon systems too, but they'd always be accompanied. It'd make sense for space carriers to be similar.
---
So either capital injection has to go, or caps must be nerfed until they are useless.
---
Basically your advice is furher nerfing of caps making them unusable only because some noobs feels opressed.  Nerf fighters, nerf faxes, remove bosone - wow. I think balancing and nerfing everything around will make this game dead.  We play this game to dominate to kill and fly with powerfull ships and spend ISK on them. It’s called fun.  There is nothing more satisfing then catching a super holding him on grid and making die. And guess why - because they are powerful and expensive.
---
Eve players respond when the changes make total sense and preserves the game  for the future.  No nonsense changes instead of walking on eggshells.  Love it.
---
Your entire argument seems to be that NCPL "were patched out the game"
---
This is entirely wrong and laughable at best
---
But sure carry on with the sperg, you have made my afternoon fly by
---
Who are those people?
---
I've been suggesting tying the spool-up to the ammount of mass that can be jumped. 
---
Want to jump a few subcaps? just need to defend your cyno a couple minutes.
---
Want to jump a large fleet? wait longer.
---
Want to jump the titan and all it's fleet? better defend that cyno for at least 10 minutes.
---
... and give us a covert ops version too! Imagine a \*station\* that can go into stealth...
---
&gt;Training and selling dedicated Titan and super pilots and cap alts has always been a thing.
---
And they were always somewhat limited in supply because they couldnt be instantly created.
---
Slowboating trough uedama in something worth to be ganked isnt unlucky, my friend.. Its just dumb v0v
---
fofofofofofofofofofofo
---
So disclaimer, I have very little expiernece in cap warfare. What if caps can't use cynos. They can move through gates and jump beacons but not cynos. That way the super umbrella and fast response is gone. Also if they added a cap cyno beacon that takes a minute or two to anchor and lasts for an hour or so. Similar to a mjd beacon or mobile depot. Maybe bump up the time it takes to anchor and such. That way If you wana attack  you gotta do it the old fashioned way of holding grid for a bit with subcaps then if the defender can't doesn't kill the mobile cyno the cap brawle commences.
---
Imo, this would allow you to keep caps fairly strong just make em very slow to deploy and move around. Also make supers only good against caps. I think paired with the mentioned changes could work.
---
use a travel fitt next time, ab for faster align and mjd so you can jump away if you get bumped
---
I hope somebody fo's.
---
What will it take, how many more years, how many more self-serving nullbloc csm members, before literally fucking anything gets done.
---
Implying being on the can actually does anything LUL
---
Nah I don't think so. Plenty of folk would like the changes. Of course many would leave, but fuck them. A balanced game is better than the bullshit cap proliferation.
---
You're right if you're roaming. If you are actuall going to attack or defend a structure you can more by operating within 70km of a fax.
---
What if it's just 9 ppl today, the rest is alts.
---
When did Olmeca Gold steal your reddit account?
---
No, i dont care about NCPL except them losing big stuff to me ... your argument was that until 2017 Lifeblood patch nobody had a chance to not be "helicopterdicked" by NCPL. That is a straight out lie or is showing missing knowledge and incompetency.
---
2 guardians worth of reps (using 5/1 all large rep guardians) is about 1300 dps of tank, that is like 2 kikimoras at half spool or 4-5 regular antisupport cruisers. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77950090/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77950090/) btw was probaly the kill they could have easily broken it under 2 guardians of reps.
---
I suppose so, it makes sense if it fits an actual role - the beauty of EVE is that carriers don't have to mimic those in real life - they can fit a role thats defined by the needs of the game, not pre-determined by us.
---
Obligatory HTFU.  You got ganked, like so many before you and so many to come.  Instead of quitting butt hurt, learn from the experience, figure out what you did wrong and fix it, or choose something else to try.
---
Make heavy duty rats spawn on a moon chunk or anomally to force a fleet to form to support the mining fleet. Somewhat similar to an incursion but maybe not quite as deadly. Maybe it require a fleet of 10-15 to support the miners.
---
r/evejobs to look for a small sized corp. You want to be in wh space lowsec or nullsec.
---
Make capital reps diminish with base sig radius?
---
Could be scaled however you wished but I imagine somewhere along the lines of a capitals rep having maybe 10% power when rapping a battleship.
---
Below that it would just get more and more pitiful. Frigates I’m talking maybe 50-100 dps repped.
---
Turning Titans into a ongrid fleet booster is the reason why these changes will never come to pass...
---
It will either :
---
1. Cause a mass exodus of player that spent their time farming for a titan and amassing massive fleets of those.
---
2. Just die at concept phase when 80% of CSM calls it "unfair" or something along those lines, we all know what entity makes up the majority and how many of those ships that entity has... Or yet another "CCP bends the knee" happens when the representative with a wizard hat threatens CCP with bad press...
---
I'm fully in favour of dictors being able to bubble caps, but it should require decent piloting, get in, drop bubbles, get out of the danger zone.
---
Stick around orbiting at 10km and you deserve to die.
---
I want most of this.  I do still want carriers to have fighters or at least the anti fighter fighters as a counter to super carriers.  Im not sure about the cyno and JF changes (JFs still need to die I would argue and not be even safer).  Everything else here would amazing.
---
Well, at least I'm not fucking shit up anymore. 
---
So there's that.
---
So pretty much the same thing as a player making a mistake in judgement and getting caught ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The point is massively smaller/cheaper ships proving to be inconvenient to larger ones.
---
&gt; So pay attention when it yellowboxes you can warp off
---
there's no such thing as yellowboxing when you're in range and are the only target on grid lol
---
and yeah ofc it was his missplay for not leaving (or letting them get a scram on him), but nobody is contesting that here
---
its nice to see some CCP employes voicing their opinions on the current state of the game. Not sure how much ccp\_falcon can  influence game design, but with luck those guys will passively absorb the ideas from falcon's rants during lunch?
---
so you lost a shitfit vindi, what else did you want to say?
---
&gt; lol
---
at your knowledge of game mechanics and patch dates ...
---
Improve BS role is a good idea. 
---
What about a Bs like bomber, who could bring XL amo torpedo type. But can't cloack, so in ranged battle you will have a serious counter to capital. And of course they need to be less powerfull than a dread, and have low EHP in comparaison of other BS.
---
You could imagine a new BS ship category with something like twice or three time more EHP than other BS in area, but when he he stop move he could activate a boost who make he redirect 15% of all damage (allied and ennemy) 15 km around him to him. so we will see some subcap mechanic to try to tank snipping in exchange of stop moving.
---
Change BS are a more interesting solution than nerf everyhting. Because give again BS some interesting role and we will see more BS.
---
Attacking I agree, but with defending you would probably need more than one fax. Otherwise the attacking group could just reposition to the opposite side of the structure your fax is on.
---
Honestly, I can't tell if this dude is a troll, or just stupid, but all of his posts are like this.
---
So spend $10 on something awful, spend $20 on plex, then rat in a carrier? Or am I misunderstanding the actual way to win Eve?
---
Tell me what type of hole you live in and I'll tell you what a terrible decision your making
---
What are your ideas on invulnerable cloaky hunting that can't be engaged by response fleets  and nerfs that made most of the old subcaps like Cruiser through BS useless and unfun?
---
I like many of your ideas but I think the carrier is probably not in a terrible place for balance. Leave them with the old choice of logi or fighters (but a pilot could only choose one) and delete support fighters and give the light fighters back their application. Fighters are already vulnerable as hell and carriers with all their fighters killed die quite easily. If you do take out fighters, will they be able to field oversized drone flights again? That wouldn't be so bad.
---
Seriously, though. Don't focus on caps only. You guys were dumb to make the TE nerfs, warp speed changes and nerfing lock speeds. There's a reason all roamers use small, costly, and overpowered ships to the exclusion of all else.
---
What about Marauders having the ability to combat refit as part of their role. 
---
give them something special :)
---
They had no space to invade
---
No assets to attack that meant a damn
---
They got huge injections of cash every year from the alliance tournament 
---
Moon mining and rental empires fueled them
---
They kicked goons out the north with a war that was paid for in dirty money
---
Since then what have they done? oh wait roll into a ball and cry and disband
---
lol despite disagreeing with you on alot of things, I think you have a fan base of thousands at least.
---
Honestly, this is like the blackout thing for me. I don't know how it will affect the game. But it's going to shake things up a little bit, and that's enough to get me interested.
---
If CCP was serious about balance and testing new things, they should have a month where capitals can't undock.
---
lol 
---
keep sperging friend keep sperging
---
but still you need to mine them, i understand the part "mine yourself" and i agree an active mining should increase the yield in a drastic manner, i agree with your game vision "more war more explosion" but miner dont go to war they just eat their rock everyday pvper do, but they don't want to mine no matter what you do (but i agree Rorqual mining need to go)  
---
right now when you don't have the capacity of mining X moon you don't attack, my alliance have some plan we seen some good moon but we can't mine them our moon just take a lot of time soo we don't attack even if we can destroy them, big alliance own renter who mine for them, we can't  
---
i dunno if you have data about moon "contestation" and the difference between siphon pos and athanor   
---
anyway, hope one day you will be in charge, i want to see Eve burn, big bloc waiting for their 1month campaign each year is boring AF
---
&gt; If you complain about Support Fighters broken mechanics and CCP announces that they will consider some changes 10x more complains will come not to change them. 
---
Because a lot of players are truly stupid. What is amazing is that people have trouble "filtering out" trash that obviously dont want nerfs because they benefit from the imbalance.
---
&gt;The lack of response from CCP bothers me even more then anything.
---
Standard procedure for them. They ignore "non-constructive" feedback because "not constructive", but when it is constructive, they still ignore it.  CCP seems to be a shitty company with shitty ideas that apparently cant stand scrutiny so everything must be kept secret and then shit hits the fan. Happens again and again.
---
They need to be told alot of the time it seems.
---
&gt; Not if carriers had no local reps :)
---
If only they could fit a buffer and resists for certain damage types...
---
Well yeah of course that makes sense. Carriers should not be an end game ship in Eve. There shouldn't be an end game ship. You should have to work in fleets of course.
---
Which is what EVE needs!
---
All of it except for the covops on JFs.  That seems silly to me.  They're already almost 100% safe when used properly.
---
And we love you
---
Why do they have to be useless?
---
They need a role that makes sense, and to be balanced to suit that role. I made my proposal a while back, but /r/eve was very much against it at that time, although I see a lot of people bringing up the same ideas since Blackout. 
---
The cat is already out the bag for capital injection, it's too late to hope to fix caps that way now. The player base is too heavily skilled to balance by ship scarcity these days, it's an outdated method to attempt.
---
When the spodbrain has advanced so far that the patient can no longer articulate their thoughts beyond shitty memes. 
---
Sad to watch happen.
---
Kik hilmar. Falcon for ceo.
---
Some people frown on it others don't care.
---
I suggest going through the grind, not because it's unavoidable you can absolutely buy a few injectors and get straight into it, but because this is a very complex game and you want to pace out your learning. Start small, work your way up and the nuances of this game will reveal themselves to you. Once you feel confident in your skills, that is when I suggest plexing.
---
&gt;Holy shit a CCP employee just posted my ideas and gets upvotes instead of shit on.
---
He has a legion of fanboys who would upvote him saying blue was green... You don't.
---
I'm not interested in doing what's better for this bloc, or that bloc, or the other.
---
I'm interested in doing what's best for the balance and state of the game.
---
If that causes an initial downturn in people playing because people ragequit, then fair enough - I'd rather have a healthy and more balanced game with a happier community long term, personally.
---
Plus, imagine all that tritanium from all the reprocessed titans... all those resources to build with anew, hahaha
---
If that cap number mattered that would be important. Take a look at the bottom left of the screen in this video from wormhole space and tell me how much that ninazu is suffering from having 0 cap all the time [https://youtu.be/2TsKXC8UcK0?t=145](https://youtu.be/2TsKXC8UcK0?t=145)
---
Shit like this makes me wonder how the fuck you were ever single.
---
Oh yeah, I'd make NPCs way more savage too :P
---
&gt; I thought tornados were used to alpha things before Concord could step in.
---
in 1.0 and 0.9 systems yes. But in 0.5 systems they have 17 seconds iirc to gank you.
---
Seriously. Like, why is my Minokawa larger than my Wyvern?!
---
&gt; Supercarrier - These would be meatier and harder hitting. Their role would be a titan and dread killers, with a focus on anti-capital warfare. They'd be useless against subcaps and vulnerable to a **decent** sized group of subcap hulls. Their primary function would be for defense of space - these are the ships you'd pile in on people who brought an invading cap force into your space. They'd also be useful for defending your own cap fleet from hostile capitals. They'd use fighters.
---
Define decent.  
---
Some folks may think a 5 man loki fleet is decent and should be able to kill this while others may think decent means you need to bring a/some dictor(s)/hictor and 15 BCs and yet others may look at the role of the dread you are proposing and say well decent should mean 50 BS's and tackle.
---
The ideas are not bad otherwise.
---
Who cares, sandbox means you can do what you want ingame
---
Yeah, I'd consider just a regular cloak for JFs to be honest, so that they're still vulnerable while moving, but there's a few tweaks elsewhere that could be made too.
---
Just spitballing! :D
---
I am repeating myself for the last time since you are just ignoring it: I did not kick anyone, just took the blame for the team.
---
Hisec structure badges are great because it’s the only time actual spectators show up just to watch us fight!  It’s great for my ego and makes me feel like I’m in the AT.
---
O66 leadership here, we are joining skillu.
---
Sounds great, but how do you do it in a way that doesn't make people feel like they wasted tremendous time and effort to get what they have right now? You could just yolo and say fuck it, it has to be done, but I think that would leave a bad taste in people's mouths.
---
Do this now and I'll love you forever.  CCP would benefit because the null sec mining groups would all sub additional Mackinaw alts )or whatever is the best subcap mining boat.)  Wormholer, btw.
---
&gt;I'm not a game designer and most of them are terrible
---
These changes are the most balanced, fair and sensical ever produced by someone at CCP. The only thing I can really disagree with is that Titans feel a bit lacking for their cost. I'd propose giving it two distinct roles. Either it's the support ship that can't really attack and only really buff, but can be remote repped and has massive tank, or it's the "combat flagship" with the damage output of a fleet basically (at rather short range, you should be able to outmaneuver it in subcaps), but it can't be repped and has the tank of a carrier or less. That way, the titan would have a more dynamic tactical effect, and there would be an element of uncertainty to seeing it used by your opponent. It would also give us the option to use titans as dreadbombs, just with a lot more risk.
---
In that spirit, I also propose anti capital bombs. Like focused void, but for damage.
---
PS: When I say short range, I mean it. Like sub 100 km or something.
---
&gt;1 - No more cynos in lowsec.
---
Just restrict what could come in through it, e.g. subcaps.  Would be a quality of life issue if we can't move fleets around to actually fight people.
---
I don't know if this will help you feel better but the Vindicator that was blown up [here](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77950157/):
---
Well he did not get away with the loot as some AG blew up his looter [here](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77950172/)
---
Hope taht helps!
---
Can we also get rid of the ability for capitals (supers at least, if nothing else) to warp to ratting anomalies? It would help give marauders a purpose again.
---
Actual 10/10 take on supers, carriers etc... I love dreads.
---
Not sure about covert ops cloaks on jfreighters though!
---
Too bad we won't ever see this, but if we do, the meta would swing so far away from what it currently is.
---
I don't think it's out of the realms of normal to expect a group of 20-25 solidly piloted DPS Battlecruisers plus tackle to be able to kick the shit out of a dread if it's not part of a well organized strike group.
---
Yeah but those 9 players would be having the time of their lives.
---
Being smart doesn't really matter when 99% of the time you don't actually fight your battles :)
---
I've got a fanbase of at least three, I know that.
---
They depend on me to feed them kibble.
---
&gt; Exploring: High-Sec is overrun and offers little reward. Low &amp; Nulll greets you with cloaked strategic cruisers.
---
When I was a NewBro, this was what made explo fun for me - flying around in a paper-thin hull, picking up cans worth multiple times my ship value all the while trying to avoid the campers.
---
I would find a WH from highsec into null, jump in and try to survive. Find some empty systems, do a few sites, make it home - you've made 100M ISK+. Get caught by a cloaky camper - all that ISK is gone. That's about as high stakes as you can get as a NewBro.
---
Only thing is, now that local is dark, I'm not sure I'd have the balls to do it the same way.
---
&gt; PVP: Ever tried to throw a t1 (meta at best) fitted frigatte at a t2 fitted heavy assault frigatte?
---
There is a load of stuff that is killable in a simple Kestrel. Even some AF's.

---
The issue with enforcing sub vs sub content is that it is disproportionately punishing towards smaller highly skilled groups that need to have tools allowing them to have any chance in 1:3 or even worse numbers ratio - which means it's essentially promoting blobbing and building numbers for the sake of numbers even more. Issue with caps and supers isn't their power, but their ease of use relative to power, and a lot of your suggestions push even more of required skill and ability to fly the ship well and make correct decisions from each and every individual pilot to FC group. 
---
Great example of that you for some reason mentioned as being a problem is combat (subcap support) triage now: average triage pilot will effectively serve as about 5-8 subcap logi pilots while forcing the fleet to stay near it on grid (which kills a lot of currently viable highly mobile doctrines in first place), while good experienced triage pilot will be able to completely replace your entire logi wing - at the expense of having to fully focus on triage job, so being unable to multibox any other ships (like links, subcap dps, standby dread etc). Using triage instead of logi wing makes it also even more important for everyone in fleet to keep good broadcast discipline - erroneous or late broadcast is even more likely result in losing a ship compared to using subcap logi wing - with just 3 reps each wasted cycle might mean lost ship, especially if your opponent is good at target calling and they're able to keep good shooting discipline.
---
Note that in case of low SP pilots not much changes here - low SP Ferox pilot being on point with broadcasts, primaries and being aware of what's happening on grid will do much better than someone with very high SP who doesn't pay attention or is barely able to follow the fleet and sometimes shoot what he's supposed to. If we take into account tackle or ewar ships (common duties for very low SP players) it gets even more interesting - and I believe pushing the game towards the point where skill and experience matters more than SP or numbers is overall beneficial for everybody. We need more ways for players to matter in fights that don't boil down to current state, where a bot capable of reacting to broadcasts would do better job than living player.
---
v0v
---
Could be interesting for sure :)
---
Imagine the co ordination needed to gather minerals. It would require a lot more FC's and dealing with these operations would be a nice first step for FC's. 
---
Killing rorquals, they'd be easier to catch but the attacking FC has to take into account that there is an enemy fleet already there AND it could end up in a 3 way fight with africanised killer rats.
---
I think he means lowsec pockets surrounded by highsec, http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Essence/Seyllin#sec for example.
---
Its funny though
---
I'd keep the cap guns on titans (having a ship that fires only once every X minutes seems pointless) but other than that I give you a B+.
---
Glad to see you're off the "roll back to 2014" point of view :D
---
I agree with everything but the covert cloak on jump freighters. They are already too safe in my opinion.
---
Come to Provi.  We do not use caps that much.
---
What I liked about passive moon mining, was that were essentially mining moons through PVP, instead of PVE. It was extremely common (at least in lowsec) to go reinforce a bunch of moons to create timers for the weekend. It was a great way to create content for people that have no interest in mining. I think, on average, that moons changed hands more often before the moon mining change than they do now (although, I have no data to back that up).
---
That, and it was a way for pvp-focused entities to generate income without having to support krabbing.
---
Problem of this change :
---
Falcon don't know game mechanics. He proof it in some post. I have a strong proposition: all dev who want to learn game mechanics, i am, and i think a lot of player in a lot of place are ready to explain you game mechanics.
---
go to see carebear in HS and speack with they.
---
go to see war decer, and speack with they
---
Do that for every kinf od entity. 
---
Yes take a long time to eve player to understand the whole game, i think a 6 month ingame stage  will be  a minimum.
---
But after maybe we will have some change with all game mechanics masterised.
---
P.S: if you want remove statut quo you have easy thing to do.
---
&gt; Carrier - Carriers would resume triage and would be devoted primarily to supporting fleets of dreads, titans and super carriers. Their function would be to support capital fleets, but they'd be vulnerable to sub caps. Carriers would no longer field fighters, and would no longer be able to use local reps. You'd need to deploy them in groups for them to be effective and support each other as well as an allied cap fleet.
---
That's basically a nerfed FAX and the removal of carriers no ?
---
This makes no sense. If they can't afford a Titan, they won't be able to throw multiple Titans worth into a disposable, limited life ship.
---
I want the 220.6 kb of data I wasted on opening this refunded to my account
---
I love this.
---
&gt; Just a thought.
---
I like the idea of deleting all cynos and making everyone gate. We can get back to escorting caps and freighters with subs.
---
Do literally anything but move blingy incursion running ships by yourself unscouted.
---
&gt; I just fundamentally don't like force aux hulls. My view would be to delete them, give the logistics role and triage role back to carriers, then refund any SP that was wasted into force aux training.
---
&gt;force aux training
---
fax use the same skill as carriers you dork
---
also they literally only exist because you nerds only ever kneejerk overreaction nerf things, AND they didn't properly address the problem they were created to solve. fax exist because people were mad about combat refitting carriers being able to switch to tank fit and tank inifinity, then switch back to regen fit and remote rep infinity, as often as they wanted
---
so now we have nerfed combat refitting, no triage on carriers, and these fuckoff giant ships called faxes that everyone keeps telling you are way too fucking big
---
oh yeah btw also fun fact about faxes - as long as you have navy 3200s you can rep and tank to infinity on a mid rack full of heavy cap boosters
---
so y'all literally gimped combat refitting then created a ship that *doesn't need combat refitting* to be as tanky and as powerful at remote repping as combat refitting carriers were before the nerf
---
&gt;these changes are just my thoughts personally, I'm not a game designer and most of them are terrible
---
at least you're self aware enough to know it
---
It's there, but it's actually called Signature resolution.
---
Triage carriers were never the problem.
---
Combat refitting RR Carriers with long range sentry drones were the problem.
---
I like the idea but not the brute-force level of what you are suggesting. Maybe drastically reduced jump ranges due to being in empire space might be a better middle of the road idea?
---
https://www.petitions.net/fire_ccp_falco
---
I honestly wonder if there's a reason Falcon is being so open about these opinions lately. Typically in a community relations role you don't want your community manager spending a lot of time hyping up players about stuff that has zero chance to happen. It makes me wonder if, even if this isn't what's slated, it aligns in the general direction of some changes CCP has planned.
---
How about stop being bad?  Who ganks with sb?  You were probably a wt screwing around with other wt in local.   This could have been easily avoided. It just seems you just want to play eve as if it were a solo game.
---
Everything

So who kicked allowx
---
Why don’t remote repairs repair based on sig radius? Like a reverse bomb damage, but magical repairs instead.
---
Damn, I guess j need to get out from being a renter in Test territory to being a Test member. This cartel war stuff is the shit I need to get into lol
---
I am cool and highly supportive with all of this, the one and only thing I would like is for dreads to be able to bring the hurt to battleships so you have an N+1 counter, maybe a different sort of siege module that drops your resists by 50% across the board but gives you reasonable tracking to be able to score "some" hits on battleships but useless against anything smaller.
---
What about an active mining mini-game ? Like you can afk mining for very low yield or use the active game where you have to scan a 3D model of an asteroid and select where you want your laser to dig through or something
---
ah the struggle, my first month in eve was training learning skills. it was cool later to get those Sp back
---
You would need cynos for jf and blips still though. Maybe titan bridges?
---
Just wear your blackout wig and pretend.
---
Check out Red vs. Blue! We're very newbro friendly and run small gang fleets pretty much daily. You'll learn tons. R-V-B channel in game.
---
You screwed up. Learn to travel fit if you aren't going to scout.
---
Cyno must have at least a 5 minute delay. Its just retarded that the largest ships in the game are effectively the fastest.
---
Why so salty?
---
A compromise  on the titnas could be keeping the gunns in for them but blancing them around, damnge per dooms day cycle, making it so a titan gets the addvatige  in the burst  from the dd but is out, dpddc (damnge  per doomsday  cycle) by a large margin  leaving.
---
Eg a titan drop ends up with the dreads ever servicing  the titans burst then brawling them down, or the titans tiping the scale with there dds.
---
Just a idea though. Not sure how it would work.
---
. . . This is the first time someone from CCP has made me actually excited about the game in a long time. I agree with all of this and if you actually decide to do this, I'll probably stop winning EvE and come back to the game. Please for everyone's sake make this actually happen.
---
You're our only hope! 😭
---
To win Eve you biomass.  That is the only way.
---
IIRC, yes.
---
A supercarrier costs about the same isk per ehp as a baltec megathron. It is a massively more powerful ship that still requires one pilot and they both cost about 1k isk per ehp assuming full command ship links in both cases. the nyx actually does significantly more dps/isk.
---
make entering siege and triage take 4x damage from torp bombers and 10x from anti-cap bombs.
---
Platform for super heavy torp and/or XXL bombs that can absolutely not apply to anything smaller than capitals; this should have been introduced at the same time supercapitals were introduced imo. Add a T2 cloakable platform while you're at it!
---
&gt;battleship
---
&gt;"Endgame"
---
Pick one lel
---
Most VNIs being stabbed, there are really only a few groups like Fraternity I find that do that consistently. In that case you'll either have to have a buddy or fit a scram like you said--for extra cpu the probe launcher isnt that valuable for null-to-null travel and you can pop a festival launcher up there instead and get CN shield extender to open a T2 scram.

Yeah, the speed tank is usually enough to keep you alive long enough. It works even better with blackout now because you can be patient for nearing the end of a wave or the end of the site.
---
These issues that falcon has brought up are the reason I left the game. It’s almost impossible to be able to roam nullsec with the current capital proliferation. Cheers falcon and hope you can actually make some of these changes and make me resub!!
---
You don’t get plex in starter shippies. You used to get minerals but they removed that too.
---
I would guess farming the civilian modules (for whatever reason. Idk if those even drop) or farming corpses. It could just be for lols.
---
Yep guns on titans are fine, simply not haws.    
---
The Fax models could be also redesigned as 2nd type of carrier you can use.       
---
Like i love those models - they are pretty good.
---
To add to this: remove smartbombs and heavy neuts from caps.
---
I think dreads being able to use HAW's is fine but take away a chunk of the damage. I'm not sure if just removing the bonus currently on them when in siege is enough or too much. Removing the HAW's entirely would make dreads pointless compared to a titan... unless the other ideas here were also implemented where they'd become the big boy in LS.
---
Also there's a problem with making the main goal of a dread the destruction of citadels... It's overkill. You can already get deflections with a relatively small fleet of bombers... or half a dozen Drekavac.
---
Stopping caps from warping to an anom would turn every anom into a safe spot for attackers which is bad but at the same time would definitely stop super ratting... Maybe a response like the Avengers in wormholes? 
---
If they scram the largest ship on grid and give no reward you could make it too risky for them to warp in or require multiple caps for what would be basic ratting. That'd cut ratting in half and make it so the pressure of even a regular site would be enough that the extra damage of a decent smallgang fleet would be able to tip the balance. Making them into tempting prey.

Haven't played for years but would always pick up logi in big fleets because there seemed to never be enough. It was fun having us be it when it comes to defence, having to keep switching primaries, keep losing our anchor till only a few of us are alive. Good times.
---
no fire u
---
5000+ deaths ? I just can't imagine someone doing that without a script lol
---
Thanks, that would make sense. About to inject an alt and was going to see if there was any benefit from doing it all at once, or over the course of a few months.
---
I'm all for nerfing capitals but just to play devils advocate here. If you remove all ability for a capital to target and apply dps to subcaps then what incentive do people ever have to fly them? If subcaps can kill a capital but not the other way around then it's a fairly useless ship. Are people just going to have cap battles out of the goodness of their hearts? I guess you could use them to bash structures but it damage caps already being accessible with just a handful of subcaps then they're fairly useless in that regard as well.
---
Caps need counterplay while still retaining their ability to be used against sub caps.
---
It's actually terrifying that you think these are good ideas.
---
Ah thanks. How do you use it to work out the true accuracy if the displayed tracking number isn't correct?
---
&gt;People skilled up or injected in whatever they want to use ... and they have right to use it.
---
If no one has fun playing on the server with all the guys who injected into super, the game is dead, and you all injected for nothing. IMO CCP need to make up their mind:
---
Do they want a game that can be meaningfully played by a bigger audience? Then they need to balance the game as such, and there has to be some limit in power of certain mechanics.
---
Do they want a game that is nothing but 2-3 nullblocks throwing Titans at each other? That's fair enough, actually, I can see that this appeals to some - but then they CCP should tell us, so those of us who have no interest in that can stop wasting our time and leave for a different game.
---
L2P instead of nerfing  the game.
---
That type of gameplay is more suitable for a singleplayer game tho. It's pure power fantasy
---
More often than not we do fight our own battles i was not at that timer think i was working unfortunately but i recon we where more concerned with DTSJ as appose to use. I Also find it funny that an Amarr says we cant fight our own battles as we mostly keep it to our self and smile when we fight not calling for outside influence unlike all the stuff that unfolded in etinguard or whatever its called.
---
With a small (5-10) you can defang and murder a carrier very easily.  I wouldn't say it negates 200 people.
---
&gt; some other hit to their defense that renders them more vulnerable.
---
boost anti-cap bomber damage. a single super should be terrified of a wing of bombers in local.
---
Hulls using significantly oversized guns are called ‘monitors’ . It would give a great reason to use that name as a hull class instead of its current use as literally the antithesis of the class - a no gun ship.
---
This is interesting, I’m running some numbers now ...
---
Eat ship
---
Damage to what?  ISK/EHP I can understand.  Application of damage is situational and there it's not so clear.
---
I understand all that, but how much longevity will the game have if only 1 group can drop upwells without having them swarmed by over 1k titans.
---
The fact 1 group can field fleets of titans bigger than the subcaps fleets of its enemies means it is either time to change or sit back and watch the long decline.
---
Remove ewar
---
As much as I dislike his policies, he's perfectly given his role as community mouth for ccp. And you are a moron for thinking a petition like this really matters. You need to drum up major controversy for ccp to care.
---
I really like your thinking
---
why hasn't this been done already? These seem like great ideas. couple this with the vni changes and it put a hurting on the nullsec ratting bots.  Can anyone explain why these would not be good idea?  Im not good with cap warfare
---
&gt; *Titan* \- Flagship, no offensive combat other than a doomsday. I'd also delete all doomsdays other than the lance, and create one lance for each race that deals their damage type. I'd also make using the lance have a decent cooldown, and it'd consume fuel too. Other than that, Titans would be totally focused on fleet support via gang links and AOE Buffs with massive bonuses to links depending on race. I'd want to make it so that it wasn't cost effective or tactically sound to have huge numbers of them on field.  
---
&gt;I'd also use titans as a mobile stargate too, much like they're used now, but have the fuel costs scale - the longer the portal is open and the more tonnage goes through it, the more the fuel cost increases. Drop the cycle time down for the jump portal for a fast cycle rate so that the fuel costs ramp up the longer you keep a portal open.  
---
&gt;In terms of weapons, the lance itself I'd keep traditionally targeted, but it wouldn't do damage to the target it had locked. Instead, when activated it'd slice a path through space to the target that would deal colossal damage, so you'd need to rely on positioning to use it to its highest level of effectiveness, and you could chain them between two allied vessels to catch people between them.
---
Effectively killing 2000 accounts right off the bat and rendering the Titan useless outside of bridging role, and rendering more than 500 days of training totally useless. You would never see one again in a fight unless someone has an overwhelmingly superior capital force. I get what you mean by "too much supercap proliferation", but that's on CCP to fix without shitting on the player that trained/injected/whatevered into these.
---
Don't misunderstand me, I don't even own one so I wouldn't be impacted at all by these changes, but that's the reality of it.
---
&gt; *Supercarrier* \- These would be meatier and harder hitting. Their role would be a titan and dread killers, with a focus on anti-capital warfare. They'd be useless against subcaps and vulnerable to a decent sized group of subcap hulls. Their primary function would be for defense of space - these are the ships you'd pile in on people who brought an invading cap force into your space. They'd also be useful for defending your own cap fleet from hostile capitals. They'd use fighters. 
---
I would agree with that as long as you don't completely remove their use vs supcap, because it's retarded to expect a carrier to have nothing to defend itself against smaller target. Or rename the ship and move them out of the fighter scheme are they are retardedly bugged in any major engagement, which render them useless.
---
&gt;*Carrier* \- Carriers would resume triage and would be devoted primarily to supporting fleets of dreads, titans and super carriers. Their function would be to support capital fleets, but they'd be vulnerable to sub caps. Carriers would no longer field fighters, and would no longer be able to use local reps. You'd need to deploy them in groups for them to be effective and support each other as well as an allied cap fleet.  
---
&gt;Additionally, in place of using fighters, I'd give them bonuses to using sentry drones to keep them static and make positioning them on the battlefield a tactical choice. I'd probably put them in a position where they could field up to 10 sentries based on drone interfacing skills, then another five based on the level of the carrier skill.
---
So rolling back the fax changes right ? Why not, but sentries are stupid.
---
&gt;*Dreadnaughts* \- These would be the bruisers, and the bulk of any offensive cap fleet. These would be the primary DPS that you bring to a fight to hammer a structure, a hostile cap fleet, or as a show of force. Effectively the battleship's larger brother, they'd be completely focused on bringing the hurt in a more sustained firefight, dropping into siege to actually... you know.. SIEGE... a structure with the rest of the caps there as a support network. Dreads would be the primary hull used to punch people in the face.  
---
&gt;I'd also delete high angle weapons too - no need for them, if you want to protect against subcaps, bring carriers, or bring a subcap fleet to support.
---
That's exactly their role when titans are not involved. Would also remove a lot of the interest of flying the ship, because killing structures is so much fun. Also who need dreads to bash a structures when 1 is already enough to reach the damage cap ?
---
HAW dreads are fun to play in small gang environnement, and have so much use today that I don't see why anyone would remove them.
---
Can I assume, as you're not using Ansiblex gates, that you're no longer part of or have never interacted with nullsec warfare &amp; life, at least for a long time ? Because as someone said, it looks like Suitonia is now a CCP employee and everyone knows Suitonia doesn't like capitals because "muh frigate".
---
To be fair, most of nullsec people don't care about capital proliferation, because we actually use and fight with them on equal ground (yes even with goons). The only vocal minority is the smallgangers (be it WH or lowsec people) that are starved from nullsec content because of it, and because lowsec content is shit due to CCP not making any pass on it in a few years.
---
&gt; 1 - No more cynos in lowsec. Only coverts. Any cap that moves through lowsec has to use stargates to do so. 
---
Why covert then ? So you can drop 200 widows (lol) on the random capital gatting ? Go all the way and remove everything.
---
&gt;2 - Give jump freighters the ability to use covert cynos to move around - this allows them to still jump through lowsec.   
---
&gt;3 - Give jump freighters a covops cloak too. 
---
In a universe where point 1 would be implemented, ok.
---
&gt;4 - No super caps in lowsec. Titans and supercarriers just wouldn't be able to go there, period. 
---
Moving is hard. Reducing their power and preventing use of certain modules, yes, but the way nullsec map is you need lowsec to move.
---
&gt;5 - Restrict titans and supers from using stargates, period. They have to jump, they're too large. 
---
Supercapitals are already aids to move.
---
&gt;6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate.
---
Already implemented, but you know that already. I would have applied that to normal capitals tho.
---
&gt; 7 - I'd also prevent combat capital ships of any type from warping to anomolies too. No more cap/super ratting. 
---
Why are people against capital ratting ? It put them into space. CCP just has to unfuck bounties and maybe add capital sized rats against these so they are not losing only 0.1% shield per anomalies. 
---
It makes me mad to see people spitting on supercapital ratting when herodreads are a thing in WH for way more money per hour and way less headaches because super ratting is actual cancer.
---
God, just create anomalies made for capitals and prevent warp to the old ones, with actual infinite scram towers in waves and capital rats if that's what you want.
---
I guess it's fair that most of the vnis I hunt are Frat since nobody else hostile rats in vnis nearby. I do know a lot of test guys also rat with stabs.
---
I just dislike some changes but with some tweaking they could be good. For example no cyno in lowsec would kill it definitly, you can't bring your dreads or triage with you. You realy don't want to warp them between gates as they are slow af. Maybe buff their align times in low then.
---
I wouldn't take away the guns from titans but I would give a fleet titan weapon penalty the more ships are in the same fleet. So you could still use them as force multiplier but just spamming them would cripple you.

Can I have 1 million dollars?

why? what has he done to warrant this kind of reaction?

interceptors. Cruisers. Supers. The CCP trifecta. All else is irrelevant in pvp.

Combat refitting is just something that got overhyped by an RnK video but not good gameplay per se outside of some wh specific stuff

No, that's what the dude with 12 stealth bombers is doing lol
---
I may not agree with you, but you have my utmost respect.
---
The blackout makes me want to train Astrometric Acquisition 5 so i can use the Scan Acquisition Array II with an AQ-710 to get my combat scanning done faster.
---
A pragmatic solution is to change the mechanics often enough that the game does not fall into a stable endgame meta, e.g. rebalancing from time to time... Seems to be a CCP weak point.
---
Yeah, I really have no idea what this guy is doing XD
---
Now we may freely laugh at you

Obvious troll is obvious.

Lol

Snuff trying to cyno drop cancer on Reddit now also eh?

Don’t you have better things to do  such as destroying low sec content?

Barebones defensive plexing? Throw ship into site, orbit beacon...

That said, it would've been a better idea to find a quieter system if that was the case.

Can I like, reverse sign this? Like a -1 vote for the petition.

Evan is the face of eve. He is the hero we need.
---
I'd like to believe that a portion of these ideas are actually in CCP's plan to change, but are using Falcon popping up in these threads as a way to garner feedback before starting the announcement/changes. It would be very Un-CCP in doing so (actually getting feedback before announcing changes), but i want to believe they're changing their ways (as evidence by the blackout).

How to counter 100 Titans : Bring 101 Titans.
---
Why come here and cry if you don't want the shit talking? This is exactly what you wanted so piss off.
---
&gt;Why do they have to be useless?
---
Because otherwise you will have even more of them?
---
&gt;Are there any subcap classes of ships in the game that are useless?
---
Doesnt matter because they are not as cancerous as caps.
---
&gt;The cat is already out the bag for capital injection, it's too late to hope to fix caps that way now.
---
Completely wrong. You only say that because you want it to remain.
---
You’re thinking of LiP :)

Your "friend" straight up lied to you then to make himself look better.

&gt;Snuff trying to cyno drop cancer on Reddit now also eh?

---
Fellow Wormholer btw, I second this
---
If the goal is to make mining more interactive, I think the *best* idea is remove mining lasers and use missiles instead, then grab chunks of ore with the old exploration spew loot mechanic every single time a missile blasts bits off the rock you are "mining". One thing is for certain, there would *definitely* be less people mining unsustainable amounts of ore. &gt;:D
---
I'm not sure how to actually go about making mining more interactive, since anything that distracts from ore yield will just be seen as an annoyance by the miners rather than engaging content. The randomness of yield per cycle could be fun when you get a large chunk at once, but inevitably players would gravitate towards feeling frustrated when they don't feel like they are getting lucky enough since people are terrible at judging odds and would always tend towards thinking of the crit yield as "normal" and being disappointed when they don't get it.
---
My personal thought is that trying to make the act of cycling mining lasers more interesting is a doomed effort and it might be better to instead focus on making the actions surrounding it more interesting. More aggressive pirates that hunt miners actively for example, not dangerous enough to be that tough of a fight but enough to keep people paying attention and dealing with them. 
---
Maybe a rare chance of something other than a bigger yield of ore, something like digging up an ancient Sleeper survey probe that wakes up and calls for help, things that generate stories and more interesting rewards:
---
"We found one of those weird probe things while mining. Our hacker extracted some coordinates from it and it led to one of those hidden mining sites, the ones with the Sleeper Cache styled mechanics that only let in unarmed mining ships. Only had a short while before the sleepers in the site woke up and the fail-safes activated but we managed to mine a bunch of &lt;secret Sleeper unobtanium name here&gt; before running off."
---
That is more interesting than:
---
"We got a bunch of rocks and occasionally a few irrelevant rats showed up and died."
---
There would be a lot of kinks to work out to make mining-based events uncommon enough to not be disruptive yet common enough to be seen by players looking for them, interesting enough to be fun but accessible enough to be run with mining ships and small groups, and rewarding enough to stop strip mining to do them but not so rewarding as to make it feel that time spent mining normally is just filler until the next event. That said, I really do think focusing on the activities around the actual mining itself is the best way to make mining more interesting as there is only so much fun you can extract from the act of chewing on gravel itself.
---
Again, you are missing my point.        
---
Why people in 10 easiest to train and cheapest to fit ships are to be better or same effective as 10 players in high skill requiring ships and expensive to fit.              
---
**Game need to be also rewarding**      
---
It is also not that those 10 players in frigates can be hit by those 10 people in titans, while this titan can easily passive tank those 10 frigates.
---
So I need to start doing this.. I've been making 50m ticks at most from L4 missions in T3s (I know, just trying to safely raise some PvP fund) - can you point me in a good direction to get started with Abyssals?
---
There's a relatively easy solution for that. Spool-up time for cynos, but not a flat one as was proposed often. 
---
Instead, tie spool-up to jumpable mass. The more you want to jump trough, the more you have to allow your cyno to spool up. 
---
This would force people to optimize the shit they drop. Dropping a Titan on a very mobile gang would not be an option anymore, but dropping another nano gang instead would be.
---
Ahhh, sorry - misread the question.
---
This isn't a change that'd happen overnight - obvious a decent amount of warning would be given for people to move out if they wanted.
---
As for people who're inactive and in those systems, if they wanted a one way, one shot trip to the nearest nullsec station when they came back, they could file a ticket.
---
No stress.
---
It kinda makes me want to go nomad, and I love the Chimera even if it is not the best pvp carrier. Nomad life is best life!
---
If you aren't looking to change corps, maybe try low sec. The faction wars people are often good for a small gang fight!
---
Add to that they are virtually impossible to nuet out, especially if you go for the 4 cap booster version over the cap battery one you showed. Even with all the hardeners turned off, this fit still tanks something like 30k, and you can't nuet off the reps. They are absolute cancer to fight in a wormhole.
---
P.S. That rapid repair burst isn't doing much for your capital reps
---
Anything smaller than a capital is dead before anything comes through the cyno. So, are we trying to force everyone into a capital? Also - are you saying that a covert cyno shouldn't have counter play?
---
I assume you'd go for removal of the citadels too, because killing citadels in lowsec without viable capital and/or supercapital support will be such fun...
---
Drag bubbles work on nullified interceptors? Woo, glad that got patched in today!
---
I love this guy!
---
Is Falcon's cat cuter than yours?
---
&gt;Doesnt matter because they are not as cancerous as caps
---
Exactly. It is caps themselves that are the issue, not their number. 
---
As for skill injection, I've never used or sold skill injectors so a big swing and a miss there bud. I just don't see them as the antichrist like some on reddit do.
---
You realize this statement would seem to indicate you are aware that it pushes people to cluster up, meaning less and less small groups to hunt. That isn't a good thing is it?
---
&gt;This means that even on it’s own, this ship would require 110 Munnins, or 50 Abbadons
---
Abaddon Cost: 9.2 Billion [hull only]
---
Munnin Cost: 30 Billion [hull only]
---
vs 3.2 Billion Cost.... Talk about Isk efficiency.
---
Pretty sure 50+ bombers will kill a tanked carrier unless a fax comes through a cyno in under 60 seconds from the first shot fired.
---
Thank God for that
---
But I learned that low sec pvp destroys security rating? Making hi sec kinda hard to access?
---
When did you last time try to tackle a frigate in a titan?         
---
Tried this with a super or carrier recently ?                
---
^(hint frigate player can always outplay your sirens, unless he does something stupid).          
---
**I think base problem is that players try to mix way to many gameplay styles, that are simply not comparable ... at the same back yard**       
---
Like you have thousands of players loving hurling capitals on each other and at the same time not less players loving frigate/destroyer level 1vs1.            
---
Like WHY, tell me WHY are we forced to choose?              
---
Why New Eden cannot be diverse enough to support both play styles.
---
I see you have watched "The Last Starfighter" as well.
---
This trend goes back to 2015 - a few ships a day for 4 years?
---
At one point goons were pushed out of their home. They came back as one of the strongest powers in eve. Who is to say another group can't do the same.
---
only if you give us the lottery numbers first
---
No, they have to nerfed untill they are counterable.
---
&gt; If you bring a comp specifically to fight carriers yes
---
Rock paper scissors. Nothing wrong with needing to bring a comp for something. Notice the fleet ran from the harpies. Same thing.
---
I tend to agree - but only if then there are niches created with significant world impact (mostly economic, I guess, may some essential resource?) that cannot be N+1-ed/out-Titan-ed by the big block nullsec guys. Those endgames need to have parity in "weight". The AT was pretty good in that with its ridiculously expensive prices, for example.
---
Op is a retard probably some snuffed out cry baby. Upvote if you agree (please) fuck snuff!
---
Or wormholes, where, outside of defence fleets and cap brawls, they're the only logi ship available.
---
You can not solve balance issues with bottlenecks. They just delay the problem.
---
Keep local gone but bring back the number of users in system. The Recons are pointless with local, who cares if it's invisible to D-scan if the pilot is visible in local. Even wormholers have been terrible at making use of them but I think NS will succeed where we have failed (especially with cyno's to let them bridge in backup.)
---
but what would snuffbox do?
---
&gt; Effectively killing 2000 accounts right off the bat and rendering the Titan useless outside of bridging role, and rendering more than 500 days of training totally useless.
---
Cool, no worries from my point of view. Sacrificing 2000 accounts for the long term health of the game is fine by me. No stress. Don't wanna use the skills any more, use all that ISK you earned in nullsec and pick up some extractors off the market to re-assign the SP.
---
&gt; Or rename the ship and move them out of the fighter scheme as they are retardedly bugged in any major engagement, which render them useless.
---
This could actually be a super interesting avenue for supercarriers - what would you suggest their role becomes? Interested to hear :)
---
&gt; because killing structures is so much fun.
---
If people would stop shitting them out everywhere, there wouldn't be so many to need to kill ;) - There's a lot I'd like to do to slap structure proliferation around too.
---
&gt; Can I assume, as you're not using Ansiblex gates, that you're no longer part of or have never interacted with nullsec warfare &amp; life, at least for a long time ? Because as someone said, it looks like Suitonia is now a CCP employee and everyone knows Suitonia doesn't like capitals because "muh frigate".
---
I've flown through a few but I don't manage one - I don't have the time to even think about anything sov related in terms of holding it these days. As for "muh frigate", I don't particularly come down on either side of the fence in terms of what type of gameplay I prefer - I'd just like to see a far more level playing field.
---
&gt; Why are people against capital ratting? 
---
Because it's a total shitshow of risk free ISK making when you're under a super umbrella, and heavily exploitable via botting. It needs to stop.
---
&gt; It put them into space. CCP just has to unfuck bounties and maybe add capital sized rats against these so they are not losing only 0.1% shield per anomalies.
---
The only way bounties are fucked is by the fact they pay out WAY TOO MUCH raw ISK. I'd be all for removing the isk faucet almost completely and turning it into overseers effects or some form of other loot drop that feeds the economy in a different way.
---
Hey Falcon, appreciate your time in musing about changes with us, can you speak more on why carriers would use sentries in this setup of capital design? Does this let you use normal drones if you need to but then if you have good positioning you can drop a sentry fleet to blast away at subcaps? (this also gives bombers a target, interesting!)
---
Only if stacking penalties on gyros are removed too.
---
how do i apply? wormholes are legit the best
---
A haw rev doesn't rep a single point of damage on the fleet it's supporting. It just does damage. Enemy damage output is much more managable than your enemy simply not dying due to reps.
---
It would be hard to think of a system that would shatter small/medium sized alliances more. I am actually blown away at how bad these ideas fundamentally are. No lowsec cynos? Only gates? Are you kidding me? I'm in SNUFF and we evicted a group called FEDUP from the North. They chose to move south to join TAPI. We killed one of their titans in lowsec. If they had to move through nullsec from North &gt; South, I actually think they would have unsubbed instead or quit the game. Having to go through such a fucking gauntlet for smaller entities would be actually game destroying. That's just one of the absolutely idiotic ideas I saw in his post, but one of the more egregious. I'm really not exaggerating here at how atrocious this would for small entities. If you introduced these changes, I see a game in which groups like SNUFF would literally hunt people out of the game and not just across the map.
---
I could point by point, but I feel it's more important to just leave a quick post here so this can get to the top. This guy fundamentally does not understand this game and these kinds of changes would dramatically strengthen major blocks hold on this game. I am blown away that his ideas got the level of upvotes that they did.
---
Maybe he was practicing on easy targets to get a feel for it instead of dropping on something harder?
---
What's more terrifying is that there are so many people out there who still think living in nullsec is actually risky for big blocs that hold space, when a substantial number of their members are just sat farming ISK pretty much risk free under a super umbrella all day.
---
Wouldn't that make them (when PvE fit) more vulnerable to getting hot dropped though?
---
Sure, as soon as you stop sucking each other off behind the gym on 5th street.
---
sure can. an ultrawide is the shit for small gang.
---
This is probably the 20th of these. Love you too though, thanks for the sentiment.
---
Well ofcourse.      
---
Like the whole idea is that one area of game can offer something to others but also need something in return.             
---
There is plenty of ways it can be done.           
---
I totally dislike the idea of BPO - this was the dumbest move CCP done.                      
---
All stuff should be BPC based and available in LP store.      
---
Imagine BPC for a titan 2bil and a lot LP
---
Yeah cause I'm going to believe you over mountains of evidence to the contrary
---
It would be x1000 times worse if his changes were implemented.
---
HACs need a Nerf if we are ever going to get back to a battleship meta.
---
TRIAGE UTILITY NIDDY IS A GO COMMANDER!!!
---
Not sure I'd be happy with carriers being unable to launch fighters.
---
But I do like the idea of re-focusing ships so that dreads become the primary DPS of offensive fleets.
---
Honestly, with the changes we've seen recently to Eve, I wouldn't be surprised if some stuff like this actually started being implemented.
---
I dont think thats necessarily the case. regardless, something has to be done about their capabilities - your idea to nerf skill injectors, while good on its own merits, doesnt actually solve the problem - the way EVE progression works is that people will eventually have the skills and money to get into supercaps. the power imbalance of supercaps still remains, even if pilots getting into them is deferred by a year and a bit. they still need to be changed, hopefully in a way that makes fleet composition a thing that extends all the way through the tech tree.
---
He's de-plexing in faction warfare.
---
Probably not a bot. Either a legit FW guy invested in that system, or someone just trying to make some brainless passive isk.
---
He definitely makes more from deplexing than he does in empty atron losses, no question
---
Neither is fozzie
---
When I got my first battleship when slugfests were a thing I felt as proud as probably a new titan pilot feels today. It was this huge was ship that cost me quite a bit but was obtainable with a bit of effort and training.
---
It really sucked when battleships dropped out of the meta and I'd love for it to return again. They are a nice step up from the other subcaps and gives newer players a nice goal to strive for.
---
Number one, make it so.
---
Sorry, poorly written. It wasn't meant to tie the first sentence directly to the second, but instead refer back to the OP's figures regarding 200:1 cap ratios.
---
I'll take "Correlations between logging in and then staying online to see what's up for 500" Alex.

Seriously though, yes that was a snarky line, it's a common enough theme among a lot of games for a daily login reward used as an incentive to get people to login to boost both login numbers for daily unique user logins as well as hoping to get them to stay online. As to how effective it is, or is not.. I'm not sure and don't have literature on it. But it is a tool used to boost logins and active players. The same as it will be next week when the other one is released to coincide with WoW Classic release.
---
We seriously wouldn't mind that. 
---
Do it!
---
How so?
---
Time zone tanking is doing more damage to nullsec warfare than any of this
---
were CCP Rise or CCP Fozzie trained game designers when they got the job?
---
So basically you'd reroll all the capital changes to their original designs before we changed all of them.
---
How about nerf capital base stats so all capitals require support fleets of remote tracking/remote sensor boosting etc in order to hit subcaps? Thus to defang any caps with subs you really just need to smash their remote support subcap fleet.
---
Just do it. The shitposters have been making too much sense lately, and I'm in desperate need of some rational thought.
---
Falcon is not a developer. He's a PR dude.
---
Yeah but that takes a while and then you do some missions. I wouldn't worry about it. Even with so many players online, how many times have you heard CONCORD announce a bad guy is in system?
---
I missed the /s
---
You have no idea how many people I would be able to make quit this game with these changes. People always like to claim that PL was some big boogyman and was making people quit the game. Well holy shit, myself and groups like SNUFF would literally decimate the in-game populations of people and FORCE them to either join huge entities or quit the game.

---
Are nano Arty Ruptures and/or canes still viable for small gangs?
---
Imo it was real shitty that they removed them before the blackout. It would have been fun to see all the elite "PvPers" run into NPCs that instalocks and deletes you. Would save us the trouble to run defensefleets.
---
I love it when we get patch notes early.
---
And then your maurader gets 1 shot by an NPC Titan or dread. Herp derp best idea, not.
---
by the way, you were missing a rig
---
Holy crap. I want this EVE. Falcon this would be amazing and a major step in the right direction. And Lowsec would be so awesome with this too.
---
Now you're thinking with Portals.
---
Top hat and fake mustache and your good to go
---
Lets be honest tho, it's not your call to make and the hands of those who do in fact make those calls are already tied by marketing/shareholders looking for a stable income from the "product" known as EvE, any major fluctuation in profits would upset those people, so those things won't happen...
---
I need to record some gameplay for work, does shadow play work with EVE as I cant seem to get it working?
---
I wrote a whole 3000 words essay on the "no supers in lowsec" thing, but when I was nearly done I realized my proposed changes would require \*GASP\* some coding and they were probably going to be downvoted to hell anyway, so I just deleted the whole thing and decided to shut up instead. If you consider I just spared you the reading of a probably worthless wall of text, the least you can do is upvote this post.
---
Literally would kill the game. There is no counter play to 100+ bombers coming from a wormhole and killing capitals if you can’t cyno. Takes them almost no time to drop a rorqual or carrier to nothing and we need every second to save them.
---
just gimme yer in game name
---
Explain deplexing? Like he is conquering the site for his main to flip?  how can he kill the rat with no weapons?
---
c4-c6
---
Would love to hear tbh. Citadels killed small gang by making entosis pretty irrelevant for us :(
---
He's got 99 problems, but free memory space ain't one.
---
That´s right unless you (or your corp) is enlisted in FW and you only kill/attack players of the opposing "team".
---
Can’t tell if your an idiot or just have trouble using basic logic. You just said you killed a titan in low sec and that moving through null would make it easier for snuff, once again a low Sec group, to hunt them makes no sense. Your own experience is a testament to this being a positive change in this one small tiny instance
---
I cannot express to you how bad these changes would be for the population of EVE. You would do exactly the opposite of what you are intending to do and I legitimately think EVE would have less people playing the game as a result. The shear imbalance you are proposing would so dramatically and dis-proportionally affect small groups that I legitimately think people like myself would utterly DESTROY people's in-game experience.
---
Why the conspiracy theory?   
---
Falcon is just a passionate dude that works at CCP.
---
The problem with those in design is that they don't actually play the game. Sounds like you do.
---
Best day of my eve life, cuz i had lvl 5s
---
woosh
---
&gt;I dont think thats necessarily the case. 
---
If you are in A and see C, which is hard counter to A, you will not fight it.
---
&gt;your idea to nerf skill injectors, while good on its own merits, doesnt actually solve the problem 
---
It cuts off the supply somewhat.
---
&gt;the way EVE progression works is that people will eventually have the skills and money to get into supercaps.
---
But we didnt have this cap explosion pre-injectors.
---
What did Falcon say?
---
Yep, definitely.  The League model.
---
You sound attacked.
---
I agree on everything but the JF changes. That ship should be removed from game, or at least make it so it cant jump in empire
---
I agree with you completely. Support fighters aren’t fast enough really and we always use tackle in Delve like sabres and proteuses. I feel like Jintaan has not really ever been in a capital umbrella with the bullshit he is spewing. And this is someone that led a large alliance!
---
To some extent, but the solution was never to go from scarcity to abundance.
---
Just rent from Hard Knocks, its totes not a scam.
---
Nothing would travel through lowsec in terms of capitals in our area, because we would obliterate it. We would have advance warning of any large group coming near our area. Small entities like FEDUP would be forced to go through the regions held by the super-mega alliances. It would mean death no matter where they went.
---
So useless, then.
---
he's preventing the enemy faction from taking a system his faction already controls
---
when you control a system, the rat doesn't shoot you. all you have to do is sit there and wait
---
I'd disagree, it makes it easier to create a pilot with the name you want, but skilling and selling Titan and super toons was always a thing. Skill farming is just more flexible now, but it's always been in the meta. You used to go to the character Bazar, now you go to Jita.
---
 Hell remember Bob's MAX campaign? It was a miserable failure, but they were fielding full Titan and super fleets nearly ten years ago.
---
I'd argue a bigger contributor is the moon mining changes and the anomalie density that have put more isk into line member pockets than ever before. You could always buy a pilot and ship ready to go, now every one can afford to do it.
---
Almost every time I undock in jita or go to perimeter
---
you had me at bringing back sentry drone carriers
---
while that narrative is juicy af, he was out roaming with reds during a strat op. if he had let anyone know he had plans, then it would have been nbd at the time.
---
Revenant and funny
---
I totally agree with everything you said and would love to see the chnges made. Especially to HAW and Titans, Low sec and JF. But what do you thing about the current state of Ansiblex mechanics. It gives big alliances such an un-necessary control over vast regions of space. Kills any attempt from small / medium alliance to punch a hole in nullsec and create content!
---
&gt;Exactly. It is caps themselves that are the issue, not how many there are.
---
If there was one cap in the game, would it be a problem to the same extent caps are now? No.
---
&gt;As for skill injection, I've never used or sold skill injectors so a big swing and a miss there bud. I just don't see them as the antichrist like some on reddit do.
---
So why do you want them to remain?
---
Battleships are not endgame.   Not even close.
---
&gt;Ironically the ansiblex is one of the few structures I haven't really interacted with on a player level thus far.
---
Well, you're going to have a pretty good laugh, when you do. They are incredibly overpowered.
---
The whole point is to let them jump to covert cynos.
---
I always thought the easiest way to get rid of Faxes in subcapital fights is to make repair modules rely on signature radius.
---
How does pa feel about this?
---
If you say so - I'm not aware of the current meta. 😉
---
Marry me.
---
I assume you will also be leading the self help courses on grammar and diction for the corporation?
---
What about also pivoting FAXs into carriers optimized for capsuleer ships? As in Force AuXiliary Deployment? Or as a sort of beach-head that isn't a citadel? Nerf the Ship Maintenance bays of the carriers and supercarriers to mostly be frigates and destroyers, whereas the new FAX would just be about on par with, but cheaper than, Titans. Possibly even be a stepping stone to it for smaller groups or just being more disposable than a full Titan.
---
&gt; Carrier . . . I'd probably put them in a position where they could field up to 10 sentries based on drone interfacing skills, then another five based on the level of the carrier skill.
---
How does that number of drones compare to the number of fighters/etc that they can put out now? Because IIRC less but tankier drones were a tradeoff for more straight drones as an anti-lag measure.
---
Also if we're talking carrier rabalance, it seems a bit of a shame that superheavy drones (50/50) haven't been revisited since the Gecko.
---
You have no point here if your statement is true then they die in low sec or they die in null. Please use logic next time you try and craft an argument
---
He probably went through a lot of Netflix series
---
He said he likes pineapple on pizza
---
The irony is that I do these things in order to distill the game into the parts that are fun to me which in this case is the pvp. I krab and do economic stuff to addord ships and repairs 
---
I have to optomize and strip things out in order to spend less time doing the bullshit parts of the game and do more of the fun parts. You can easily defeat me by making it a long bullshit process to bother you in which my immediate response is "nah, fuck all that.".
---
How much does it cost to doomsday?
---
He was friends with FD and he used to be in FD he had a friend who died in FD if he's "not allowed" to join his friends for a memorial roam over a strat op which isn't even A FUCKING CTA then yeah I wouldn't want to be in waffles either.
---
Perhaps a more linear game would be more fitting to you. WoW classic looks nice. 
---
EVE has never been about "I win" buttons.
---
Yeah so they just fucking unsub. WTF dude
---
&gt;WILL THIS FIX THE GAME?
---
You know what will fix the game?
---
Maintenance fees.
---
1-5% a day of buy price should do it.
---
As long as upgrading ship size and power and power projection pays for itself, everyone will do it.
---
A Titan should be an ace up your sleve, not something you're not sure how many your alliance can field of because you've lost count.
---
\*Drifter tech intensifies*
---
Unfortunately majority of nullsec players nowdays are either krabs or renters, now exrenters, so krabs as well with no benefiot to literally anybody at all. They live their own life in desired system doin only god knows what. I cannot speak for the other alliances but iam prety sure this change is taken very possitively in NC. 
---
There was always something wrong with nullsec, it was way too safe, but on other hand wormholes were supposed to be hard to live in as well, isnt it. 
---
People will have to adapt, those who do will stay, those who wont will leave, no loss to be frank, natural selection of sorts. 
---
EVE was once hard remember? Check it nowdays, its a fuckin joke.
---
I need to decide which T3C to train and I'm leaning towards Legion. How does legion perform compared to other T3Cs? Is it good for PvE?
---
This is so true. I don't know if you can comment, but do the people at CCP who can make changes to the meta know just how bad it is? I saw so many of my friends and people in the small gang community quit in 2016, that year in particular was the nail in the coffin for many of them. We saw our gameplay just eviscerated and really lost faith in CCP. It became ISK Maker online, and that's not what I want to play. I play EVE because it's the only MMO out there that has risk to it, but that risk has been removed for those who use capitals, or pack into one region. Remember when Imperium lived in PB, Dek, Branch, Tenal, Tribe, Vale and Gem? Now they all fit into one fucking region because of how broken this game is.
---
I really hope blackout is foreshadowing (no pun intended) how harder EVE is about to get.
---
Ok objectively speaking.          
---
Please don't put this idea to CCP, like we don't want to have more alts.        
---
What you suggest is something that will put multiboxers and people with most alt accounts on wining position.        
---
Like they have spear slots on those accounts for those remote support chars.
---
Simply look up some fits online. Then start low level and work up.
---
I bet you scrubs thought CCP sent those Drifters to bash your structures. Lol, all planned at the bbq buddy.
---
Ah, fair.
---
Can't you set up jump beacons in mining systems? Wouldn't that be the fix to that. Plus panic module is 4mins. Or something like that.
---
They had to get goons back to delve so they could get "normal" metrics for the blackout. Once Goons retreated or returned glorious (whatever way you wanna spin it), CCP could turn it off. 
---
Now they can get accurate metrics from baseline until now on one of the most heavily mined/ratted regions of space.  Plus it would be funny to see how many bots in general dont log in. I am very curious to see the changes in the economic report this month from everywhere on the map.
---
So basically delete carriers and give faxes the chance to use sentries with zero remote/local reps?  Hmm, no.  But everything else sounds fine.
---
That shit is delicious tho
---
So your idea won’t work and has no merit. Do you know how fast a 50-100 man bomber gang can kill a carrier or even a super? 30 secs for a carrier and 3-4 mins on a super. Think how much time a subcap has to live then. There is no way to get subcapitals on field before they completely decimate billions while only risking frigates. 30 minutes to light a cyno of any kind is just asking for all of null to die
---
A substantial number of our designers and other staff do play the game quite a bit :)
---
Everyone has different ideas of what EVE should be!
---
OP, as always the tools are there for you to prevent poor performance. Check the in game map. Check zkillboard. It's a free service listing kills per system. It has a search feature to find systems. You'll find the Kusions regularly ganking, especially in Uedama. This has been going on for years.
---
If you do take a break from Eve, I'd like to borrow your stuff. I will pay interest on your return.
---
This is the man who said the blackout should be extended indefinitely... Keep that in mind.
---
&gt; Cool, no worries from my point of view. Sacrificing 2000 accounts for the long term health of the game is fine by me. No stress. Don't wanna use the skills any more, use all that ISK you earned in nullsec and pick up some extractors off the market to re-assign the SP. 
---
It was more of a company point of view. Nothing anger people more than losing what was previously the end-game goal of many because it was nerfed to oblivion. And angry people tend to leave?
---
&gt; This could actually be a super interesting avenue for supercarriers - what would you suggest their role becomes? Interested to hear :) 
---
If I hadn't to think about server stability, fighters could stay. You also need more AoE damage to counter heavy capitals packs.
---
But for example sake, why not a Triglavian-style laser weapons where the more you stay on a target the more damage it takes, until it reaches a point where reps cannot save you ? It would mean people would actually die because of it. It fulfill the role of capital killer, while tweaking it's damage based on signature radius and having a long reload time would render them way less effective against subcaps fleets, without removing the ability to kill/chase off the lone tackle if needed. I fail too see why you couldn't spread them and ramp on multiple targets (unless it has a dps cap) but eh, people dying ?
---
Also removing fighters would remove e-war support from them, outside of burst modules which are fine-ish (thinking of perma tackling a subcap fleet with it is folly).
---
&gt; If people would stop shitting them out everywhere, there wouldn't be so many to need to kill ;) - There's a lot I'd like to do to slap structure proliferation around too. 
---
Well, if people can, they will. Probably the first rule for anything in this world sadly.
---
&gt; I've flown through a few but I don't manage one - I don't have the time to even think about anything sov related in terms of holding it these days. As for "muh frigate", I don't particularly come down on either side of the fence in terms of what type of gameplay I prefer - I'd just like to see a far more level playing field. 
---
Fair enough !
---
&gt; Because it's a total shitshow of risk free ISK making when you're under a super umbrella, and heavily exploitable via botting. It needs to stop. 
---
Well, not that risk free, supers die everyday to bombers gang. Sure, they won't be killed by another subcap comp that easily. Then again, nothing is risky when local is on, and nothing is risky when it's off and people put stream bots on gates with 200km of bubbles to warn when anyone enters the system (lol WH).
---
As for botting, this is not a capital problem but more of a Eve PvE problem. Remember a few months ago with the 200 Gilas guy, they can do it with almost everything. Also fixing supers should fix the ratting problem.
---
&gt; The only way bounties are fucked is by the fact they pay out WAY TOO MUCH raw ISK. I'd be all for removing the isk faucet almost completely and turning it into overseers effects or some form of other loot drop that feeds the economy in a different way. 
---
Exactly my point :)
---
&gt;If there was one cap in the game, would it be a problem to the same extent caps are now? No.
---
But there ins't one cap in the game, and there never will be again. There's ALREADY thousands of titans. You just can't turn back time; they must be balanced in the same way as every other class of ships in the game, as rock-paper-scissors. 
---
I mean, okay, you turn off skill injectors. Then what? Nothing would even change, super umbrellas will still be oppressive, FAX will still be an I-win button against small gangs, people will just buy their super chars from the bazaar instead since there's thousands of spare super+titan chars floating about. 
---
Balancing around scarcity just doesn't work, there's no rhyme or reason to having a class of ships that is straight up "better" than everything else.
---
Please get yourself into the design team...
---
No idea, and not my place to comment :)
---
&gt;It makes me mad to see people spitting on supercapital ratting when herodreads are a thing in WH for way more money per hour and way less headaches because super ratting is actual cancer.
---
Seems you skipped a BIG point when it comes to Super ratting. I'd rather dread rat in a WH and make 5 times the isk per hour with a ship 1/8th the cost while being in a safer environment.
---
Falcon this is just about the most sensible thing I've seen written on this sub holy hell
---
I'm super happy that at least one CCP employee can see this.
---
Also,
---
&gt; We don't have a healthy game right now in terms of the nullsec PvP meta, and we shouldn't pretend that we do.
---
Or Lowsec (FW and regular) for that matter.
---
Yup, I'd get rid of it too.
---
One timer on a structure, when you ref it, you get 36 hours +/- 12 hours randomly decided by TQ before your structure comes out and you need to defend it, and you know immediately when it comes out as soon as the countdown starts.
---
And what if you bring a bit of a, b &amp; c? With respect to supercaps, doesn't the fact that they will need to consider more than just n+1 before dropping already represent a step in the right direction?
---
Capital proliferation was always bound to happen with time. It's inevitable. Nerfing injectors also doesn't do anything for all the capital ships and pilots already in the game - it arguably makes them even more powerful as their advantage becomes more time and effort consuming to match. 
---
The only effective and scalable way to affect the problem is by altering their capabilities in the field.
---
Out of experience, defending as a small group is exactly when the FAX shines.
---
Keeping on grid with ravens and fax makes it unfun for the aggressor
---
The idea would be to make sure that you had to commit to positioning a group of carriers for logistics / combat support as part of a tactical choice when engaging.
---
With regular drones you can just herp derp around anywhere within your drone control range without caring about where you were positioned.
---
It's nothing clever. Surprisingly Imgur had no problem rehosting it directly.
---
https://imgur.com/OJETdEN
---
&gt;But there ins't one cap in the game, and there never will be again.
---
So the problem is the number of caps. Injectors cause caps.
---
&gt;There's ALREADY thousands of titans. You just can't turn back time; 
---
So you need to to both. You have to cut off the supply.
---
&gt;they must be balanced in the same way as every other class of ships in the game, as rock-paper-scissors. 
---
You cant balance like that. If you are in A, you will never fight C, so no or less content basically.
---
&gt;Balancing around scarcity just doesn't work, there's no rhyme or reason to having a class of ships that is straight up "better" than everything else.
---
It is not balancing on scarcity. It is balancing. There is no reason new players need to inject caps.
---
&gt;people will just buy their super chars from the bazaar instead since there's thousands of spare super+titan chars floating about. 
---
Which was limited in supply since you couldnt instantly create a titan pilot.
---
I hope it gets a lot harder. Eye-wateringly harder.
---
The Tengu and Loki are probably the most common to see, and I think the common opinion is that the Loki is better.
---
So stop asking for it then.
---
This is my thought too. The face of the company often needs to toe the line.
---
Hi I´m a BPO addict. Can I have all your spare T2 BPOs please?
---
So who did then, why hide it?
---
See this is where you lose support.  The first response of “oh well a small price to pay” is the epitome of arrogant ignorance.
---
If some people are completely worthless to you and you have nonissue making that publically known?  you cannot get mad at ANYTHING they choose to do in return because... well they were not even worth considering before they retaliated. 
---
You like to spout ideas publically and likely bitch at the devs to make things your way, if you fuck over people please don’t (especially publically) have a “well fuck those guys” mentality.  It has killed many a game community.
---
Kee coming up with fixes, but do the same for keeping people from quitting the game if you are going to be publically representing the company mate
---
IMO the Gecko is OP as fuck, that's why it's so expensive, and it's also why we don't drop that many of them into the game.
---
I'd prefer trying to avoid that kind of thing.
---
you have the same ideas as me, the cap rebalance was so upsetting for me. Seeing remote rep carrier fleets go away was sad, it took away a huge amount of pilot skill and replaced it with 6km/s insta kill fighters. en masse slowcat fleets were kinda cancer to deal with, but you could deal with them! There were counters plays like sitting at 180km and out ranging them or using maelstroms to try and alpha carriers to disrupt their cap chain.
---
ive [said it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c25lqx/the_age_of_the_dreadnaught/erjltbf/) but dreads should do at least 45-60% more damage than they currently do and there should be an incentive to use meta,faction and T2 guns on dreads other than ~20% more damage. (i wouldnt change the cost of them though as most people suggest, if you want a dread that does 22k dps then you should be paying 4-5b for the thing)
---
i understand how ccp works and that a cap balance probably isnt on the table for another 2-3 years but an overhaul modelled on your ideas would be very nice.
---
Check you taxi intercepter fits. They stripped nullification for half of the interceptors in the game.
---
Nah, fuckem. Delete fump freighters and BLOPs, too. :)
---
Love it! The only things I didn't like was the restrictions, I feel that goes against the sandbox. You mentioned making Super Carriers and Carriers not effective vs sub-capitals. That to me should be enough rather than stopping them warping to anomalies. The same can be said for gates, I think Titans should still be able to use gates in emergency situations, but it should be extremely expensive. So less flat out restrictions and more balance. 
---
With all that said my big question after reading it was when do I get to play this game?
---
:Waiting: Just Do it
---
That sounds great, I'm sure Goons would love your proposed changes. They get to keep their 1500 titans, noone else can produce any more. Ez win.
---
The few times I ran ahavens in a carrier, I was fleet fit. It wasn't optimized for PVE but it worked fine enough.
---
Personally, I wish CCP made it so PVP ships were the norm so PVE wasn't just a farm animal.
---
Here is my view on capitals:
---
We got a really nice, balanced progression from frigate to battleship. Bigger ship is slower, applies worse, has more ehp and has more damage. Really cool rule of thumb which is inherent to Eve ship balance. Capitals have been breaching this balance in so many ways. Previously the special snowflakeness of capitals was justified due to their price, rarity, inaccessibility. These are no longer legitimate balance factors. So capitals should just be a natural continuation of the rule of thumb. To achieve that:
---
- Nerf capital EHPs all over. The EHP jump from a battleship to a carrier should be similar to the jump from a BC to a BS.
---
- HAW guns on dreads, and anti-subcap fighters should be as effective on battleships as BS HAW guns (you know, the smaller sized guns) to battlecruisers are. If HAW gun battleships can't track destroyers then HAW gun carriers/dreads shouldn't track cruisers, and supers shouldn't track BCs, and titans shouldn't track BSs.
---
- If you want doomsdays, phenomena generators, EWAR fighters, and such other capabilities which you wouldn't find on a T1 ship, then move them to T2 capitals. Yes. I think there should be T2 capitals if we want to preserve these mechanics. This isn't power creep. This is just bringing the balancing game design to
---
- Balance EWAR immunity of capitals by loosening diminishing returns (so if you have 5 or 10 pilgrims, you'd have the same optimal reduction on a dread which you'd achieve with 1 pilgrim on a battleship.
---
- Fix cyno and anticyno mechanics to prevent capitals being the fastest response force one can muster to project to a desired grid in a region.
---
If we make capital progression just like subcapital ship progression, then we don't have to shoot for strictly defined roles like anti-capital capitals or anti-structure capitals, just like we don't have those for subcaps. These roles emerge in how players use these ships.
---
That's how they are fit. You don't have enough calibration to fit another rig. It's a pretty standard Max DPS Incursion Vindi.
---
More like 1/4 as dreads are a little blinged.
---
Also you can have a 2 hours session in relative security (if hole are closed and you don't get someone ragerolling into you) and be done with eve for two weeks.
---
so i am all in about the fax and capital changes. 
---
but if you want to change orca, then either put mining lasers on it or give mining barges 2-4 times the cargo hold. cause i aint flying every 10 minutes to station or finance 2 accounts, "cause you are supposed to mine in a fleet"
---
but you kinda just prove the meme. the one where people might have good idea about pvp, but terrible idea about pve
---
Being able to force weekend fights so people can't hide behind autz Wednesday timers forever would be amazing
---
&gt; I would argue that small gang corps rely on triage just as much if not more. 
---
You'd be dead wrong. When small gang corps put a triage fax on grid, hostile supers dogpile, and things go way worse than if you had just flown t2 or t3 logi to begin with.
---
You know it.
---
Damn straight. Replace Fozzie.
---
Not allowing cynos in low sec and jump freighters with covop cloaks is one of the worst things I have ever seen
---
Why not just bring back timer kiting ala Starbase reinforcement mechanics? I felt like that was the best mechanic as it let both the defender and attacker have some counter play with potential for mind games.
---
Overall his ideas are pretty good, some stuff would need discussion and changing but overall i wouldn't be upset if these changes were added tomorrow
---
Deplexing is **de**fensive com**plex** capture. The system is already owned by your militia. The rats are of your faction. Just sitting there in the sites, you get a tiny bit of LP and don't have to kill anything.
---
You're thinking of oplexing, **o**ffensive com**plex** capture.
---
has tdsin retired gilas :(
---
Yonks ago, I proposed replacing the cap booster mechanic with a reserved capacitor module that would act like a re-chargable cap booster.
---
Load the charging script in and cycle it, and it eats your ships main capacitor and charges itself up until it has a maximum of &lt;x&gt; GJ depending on size / meta. Probably some kind of multiplier, e.g. for every 1GJ of capacitor you drain from your ship, you get 0.5GJ reserved charge.
---
Pull the script out, and now when you run it, it injects a chunk of energy back into your ships main capacitor. 
---
Can't be neuted (like charges), can choose when to inject (like charges), offers 2 or 3x your total cap pool (like charges), but crucially, you can't just infinitely pile new cap booster charges into it from various holds / nearby ships.
---
Even if you're noming capital remote capacitor beams from a triaged FAX, you could still only charge it as fast as it cycles. Would completely collapse the federation navy LP though. 
---
IMO it would make for some very interesting gameplay, I can definitely see skilled pilots flying active tanked ships using gaps in their enemies' weapons fire to try and claw some energy back into their reserved capacitor ready for the next burst of DPS.
---
Thanks for the tip, I haven’t looked at my interceptors yet. Mainly noticed that the tengu I had parked myself in is now in need of a refit.
---
MEGA!
---
That is precisely the problem with Supercapital ships. Nothing else in Eve scales linearly like that. You always pay a massive premium in time or rarity for a marginal advantage. You have rare objects that are 5% better, but they cost 100-1000x more. You have skills that take 10 days to go from Level 1-4, but 45 days to take to Level 5. A Supercapital shouldn’t be 10x more EHP so it costs 10x more. It should be 10x more EHP so it costs 1,000x more. And even then, cost is not the ideal balancing factor.
---
The idea is that capitals shouldn’t be solo, but should be operated strategically in a fleet.  While a 50 - 100 man bomber fleet could clear a single capital, how would they do against a 50 - 100 man caracal fleet?  Besides, 30 minutes wasn’t the point (why I said subject to balance).  But the idea is to limit caps to being effective in fleets and not solo, rather than trying yet another round of nerfs on them, which seems to be going on since they came out.
---
You also attract local supers to come to the party who wouldn't have come otherwise. Which means your small gang corp either has to forsake the objective because you thought you could escalate uncontested, or you have to make friends with local powerblocks, and become what you hate.
---
so basically do a rollback to 2012
---
im down
---
yay Chris Roberts came to play Eve again :P
---
Hmm... Good point, I suppose without Rorqs, casual PVPers would probably just pay for subscriptions without PLEX. We'd probably see a lot more smaller, inexpensive ships on field.
---
is this the thread salty boys post in? if so im here to watch
---
So let's make it easier for people to get into wormholes too.
---
More connections to null? More connections to lowsec? 
---
What's your poison?
---
&gt;And what if you bring a bit of a, b &amp; c?
---
How do you do that if you are solo? Even if you think that is irrelevant, all you get is a bunch of useless players. Why is it fun being in A to get completely fucked by C? (this will happen despite having B somewhere).
---
&gt;With respect to supercaps, doesn't the fact that they will need to consider more than just n+1 before dropping already represent a step in the right direction?
---
Why would you do it like that? Just nerf them.
---
&gt;Capital proliferation was always bound to happen with time. It's inevitable. 
---
Eve will not last forever, shut it down now since it is inevitable.
---
&gt;Nerfing injectors also doesn't do anything for all the capital ships and pilots already in the game - it arguably makes them even more powerful as their advantage becomes more time and effort consuming to match. 
---
But it does do something for the caps that are not yet in the game. Do you want more caps?
---
Alot of people already use buffer fits for ratting. The faxes you cyno in are your local tank.
---
It is kind of curious. It's not directly undermining the current game designers by any means, but you'd have to think it might create some tension.
---
I just hope you don't have a mob of PMs come after you for siding with the fanbase about changes on the roadmap. I mean I honestly want everything you said, and I would love to play that game - I just worry that you're gonna catch heat for this.
---
so if you remove rorqs from equation, mining laser skiff can do 27m3/s in ore including mining drones without boosts (so 27*1,6 extra yield) compared to mining drone orca with 22m3/s, where you have to wait for drones to fly back to orca
---
you already have extreme difference between orca and exhumer
---
I don't expect everyone to agree with me or support me. 
---
Where would the fun in the world be if there was no chance to have a civil disagreement and talk alternate viewpoints?
---
Eventually their shit dies. Importance depends on scarcity.
---
Goons have already won, btw.
---
Game theory wild
---
The covert ops cloak on a jump freighter is a bit weird, but most other suggestions are pretty decent. I wish they would give a cov ops cloak to Blops though. That just seems weird they don't have one.
---
I admit that was a pretty dumb statement.
---
we're trying to fix the shitty issues, not enhance them lol
---
Because it was always intended to be a dumb lore event and never anything more. People like yourself on /r/Eve projected their own wishes only their “purpose” and jumped to conclusions. When CCP management realized how big the “lore event” had completely broke the entire meta of nullsec, they backed off very quickly (and probably decided go pay more close attention to WTF the lore team was coding into the game going forward).
---
The fundamental flaw of Reddit.com, in that correct but unpopular threads can be censored (downvoted) by a brigading mob just shows why CCP should NOT be ceding their main venue for gauging player sentiment to a platform that they dont control and can be manipulated.
---
I mean that's one thing, sure, but what Falcon is saying here is basically "press the big undo button on the past 5 years." I'm all for it. I think he's right. But there's no way that the people at CCP who _advocated_ for those changes don't take some amount of offense. 
---
That being said I buy what Falcon said at face value - if the company encourages this dialogue, maybe it's not a problem.
---
No
---
Probably only a good idea for market toons or buying a few skill injectors to try different activities like cloaky/bombs/ceptors right off the bat. Raw isk is otherwise pretty easy to come by in Nullsec. Some lucky newbean looted a few billion in modules off of some T3Cs we hazed yesterday.
---
You don't seem to know the English language very well, but that doesn't stop you from using it apparently.
---
As if anything less than their current stat is "useless" lol. 
---
I guarantee you if titans/supers had 1/2 the ehp they would still be used all the time. There are a million ways to nerf them without making them useless in order to balance the game.
---
That's the beauty of it - I literally sit and talk to our CEO about this kind of thing.
---
We're highly encouraged to be open about our opinions, and to discuss ideas... I'm not concerned about it at all :P
---
Attack my language is the argument of people with no argument against.
---
Thank sir.
---
Even this is becoming less and less true though. Triage is even more oppressive in small scale fights.
---
Nerfing hacs wont bring back battleships. t3 and precursor doctrines will still dominate, and battleship fleets will get wiped by titans and bombers constantly. The reason you don't see battleship metas is because they're too slow and lack too much agility. They don't have the ability to reposition quickly like smaller ships, or the ability to soak damage like even bigger ships.
---
&gt; small gang corps rely on triage just as much if not more
---
no? please name a small gang corp that relies on triage cause i know not a single one
---
What's the deal with sentries? Is it the instant damage application that makes them good? Would you typically just set them up and orbit them at XXkm (providing all enemies are within their falloff?)
---
Thank GOD. Ive been doing relic sites for a couple months now, came across some literature talking about it last night. If I had been missing out on the actual loot for that long I would have had an aneurysm. Thanks!
---
And that's how you start fixing super cap proliferation.
---
Might be a personal issue, no one else is really complaining about haw dreads. They are stuck on grid for 5min which means you generally form the 30 to 40 ships necessary to break their tank in most senarios. ITs super easy to maintain tackle on them. 
---
Most haw dread usage is a one way trip which is a decent balance between risk and reward.
---
Just use a praxis. It doesn’t make as much isk as a rattle, but it’s a lot cheaper, so unless you are going to be using both of your alts as cloaky scouts and rolling all wandering holes, I wouldn’t use a rattle
---
Well shit I'm glad you're there. The bridge between (product/community) discussions and (product) decisions is often a huge one, but without one the other can't exist. Or...maybe they just _shouldn't_ exist without each other.
---
That's not a scanner module that "alerts you of nearby enemy ships" as OP requested, though. It's not even a module at all.
---
so did you just get the deposit back or the deposit + the price of the structure you had to transfer to them or the deposit + you took down your structure ?
---
&gt;wormhole space, is like, totally so easy to defend guys
---
&gt;Initiative flair
---
This shit writes itself
---
Canes are totally viable, but in my opinion a lot of their utility comes from the links, so make sure to bring skirmish. This fit is kind of blingy for a T1 BC but I like it.

I haven't experimented with Ruptures a lot, but I'm not sure how effectively you could cram artillery in there. I certainly don't see many of them around.
---
This has to be the most idiotic attempt at a response I have ever received. 
---
You are saying that if capitals can be countered they are useless. That is asking for a fucking I win button. Go and play WoW, where your high level allows you to oneshot newbies with no risk, because EVE is not for you, buddy.
---
If a group feels comfortable committing supers against you and it's an objective they want to win, they're probably going to commit them whether you roll triage or not.
---
Losing a local tanked Apostle doesn't hurt significantly more than losing a Logi Proteus when you account for SP loss, and it reps a lot more.
---
Ah! A famed hole! Any enemy will fear your cap blob if they ever roll in, they of course cant bring their own! And you can rage roll with 6 battleships to an area of space that contains nothing but alt corps, where no pvp happens and no one actually lives! It's a pve corp you say? May your group of nestors be cap escalated over and over sir.
---
I would be cool with most of what you said. I’d still like for titans to have some sort of anti cap weaponry (other than doomsday) on them personally, even though I don’t own a titan. I’d also like for lite carriers to still be able to field regular fighters.  Getting rid of the fax altogether would be ok, but I guess I’d rather see a new sub cap logi like a battleship logi to take over... maybe that’s stupid, but I agree with the fax issues that have been raised. I like where you are going with dreads, but I still like dreads being able to apply damage to larger sub caps. 
---
I wonder if having some sort of maintenance costs per corporation for owning large vessels like super caps and caps would help in reducing the proliferation of them in null? No idea how that would be implemented. 
---
All in all I wouldn’t be pissed off of all of these changes happened tomorrow. Even the things I kinda disagree with you on. I just appreciate that things are continually moving toward a healthier game.
---
You very kindly illustrated his point in your post w/o realizing. 
---
By being forced to put loki's proteus on field to tackle you are responding with more than your one stop shop cookie cutter.
---
CCP Falcon for CSM when?
---
Maybe the dread should have a support subcap fleet?
---
There is one thing that would fix all of this . Capital size jump field generators.
---
Would be scary to use capitals again
---
The Loki is the most common in PvP by a wide margin, Tengus are the most used in PvE, especially for running DED sites. I also like the Tengu for BLOPS hunting due to the massive tank it can mount with a cheap XLASB fit. Legions can perform well in PvP but require quite a lot of bling to do that, and the Proteus is not very useful anywhere, tbh.
---
Wow. Everything he said is something I like. 
---
Although I think Titans and Supers should be allowed in Lowsec and use Gates.
---
No cynos in lowsec would be great. Although fuck JFs using cov ops cynos. Enough of the free passage of goods.
---
Fly it in or shop local. Or invest in a citadel chain with Cyno beacons.
---
Why not just nerf FAX to the point where they're about equivalent to old carrier triage? Dont get me wrong, Archon triage was painful to fight against but it didn't self-rep 400k DPS.
---
We did this. I did the math on it and we were able to unlock about 1 goon Titan for every burst jammer pilot in nothing but T1 frigates. That being said, there was something like 500 Titans and the server just couldn't handle the jamming, so it could have never really worked as a tactic. But in theory it was successful.
---
&gt; You have no idea how many people I would be able to make quit this game with these changes. 
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA THIS IS WHAT KRABS ACTUALLY FUCKING THING OMFG HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA OH GOD
---
Isn't that what the scorpion is?
---
&gt;When people say make null sec dangerous its not only remove local. Titans and Supers are supposed to be endgame and now they're everywhere. Eviction should be a game changing issue.
---
it's not used to get people to log in to play, it's used to get people to plex their accounts
---
there is no noticable difference in pcu between event weeks and normal weeks
---
&gt;Wouldn't that be the fix to that
---
Pretty sure the "fix" would have to be yet-another-alt in something tanky on-grid to light the cyno.  Beacons wouldn't be ideal, as you probably don't want to be warping in on the grid (i.e., the reason ratting in big things in staging is a bad idea).
---
for muh mersion, make it a carrier
---
Yes. Carriers get logi back AND 15 drones (shouldn't just be sentries). Super-carriers should be unable to warp to anoms, but regular carriers should be able to. Carrier ratting ins't as OP as super ratting. If you play/pay long enough you should be rewarded with an OK ability to make ISK at a decent rate to fund in-game activities. At 2 Billion to PLEX an account, carriers are getting more and more of a grind, which is good while supers can hit that in 2 days easy.
---
Either go all-in PVP only or keep PVE viable. PVE funds PVP. what do you fuckwads not understand about that?
---
Look at Kusion's killboard.  Then come back to this sub and tell us about how salty he must be losing out the loot on this one kill.
---
If this guy's tag is legit, I can vouch for them. We've had those RK guys haze far too many BS since we last moved. That being said, we just drop caps on them to solve that problem
---
I can't understand what you're saying enough to even understand your argument
---
All t3c have been rebalanced, subs are down to 4 instead of 5
---
Jason definitely uses stealth bombers to gank people all the time. It does require that the targets are slightly more expensive to make a profit, but after years of solo ganking freighters with stealth bombers, I don't think that is a concern for him.
---
Do it!!
---
Well its a module integrated in every hull. And its pretty much the only way apart from combat probes
---
Are you really crying and quitting because you lost a 1.7B Vindi in Uedama?  That's not even an expensive loss, and you had to be stupid to lose it to them.  You undocked, you consented to PvP.  Eve isn't for you.  Bye bye.
---
IF you make those changes Low sec will be so much fun
---
Was not overhyped at all, it was obvious a madly overpowered mechanic allowing for whole machariel fleets to refit from arty to AC etc. but it had huge impact on battles everywhere, just not bloc warfare.
---
However it would have an impact, cause it required skill to do in a way that it was advantageous, and if you didn't know how you could easily kill yourself cause of poor refitting choiced.
---
&gt;Limit this production by the number of capitals in game at any given time to a *very* low number, don't allow more to be built until existing capitals are killed off below this level
---
None of your results would really happen except maybe 1), but EVE: Washington Naval Treaty does sound pretty funny regardless.  A bad game, but funny.
---
Nope. You can shove that big bitch thru there
---
I assume you're not going to just delete every ship I own if my wallet reaches 0 right? Then I'll just trade my titan to an alpha alt when I'm not using it.
---
Besides assuming that titans are too expensive to be common is what got us into this mess in the first place.
---
I'd argue that what limited the supply was isk. It's easier to make money than ever before, you could always find a toon of you had the money.  A guy could argue that sp is cheaper now, but honestly I don't know that it is.  Relative to income definitely, but in raw numbers I'm not so sure.
---
But there was always some one running accounts for the purpose of creating sale toons... Now you buy isk and inject instead of browsing for a frieghter toon with a name you didn't hate, but the market has always existed.
---
It sort of is an issue for game balance, though. Alliances have their members fly suboptimal doctrines sometimes because they're already trained into one specific race/etc. Meta shifts are harder with skill injectors because a large percentage of the population can immediately adjust.
---
True story.  NC and PL are now renters in Pandemic Horde space.      Brave is... brave.   The only nullsec powers left are Provi and Pandemic Horde.
---
16 63 31 09 12 07. Powerball. When you win, I get the fucking ship.
---
Plex goes in Plex vault( don't die with it in your cargo), Plex is no longer 1 item, 500 give you 30 days sub
---
So.. why not make them seperate hulls?... And now we are back to square one. 
---
I agree with your sentiment and most other things. Overall buff battleships and nerf capitals ez.
---
Oh I meant in a good way. I expected  to get 1 or 2 git gud scrub replies. But people are trying to stay helpful and make me see that I was being a retard so I appreciate it
---
I routinely min-max my way out of enjoying games. Exploits for infinite money or something similar will kill my reason to progress. I have thought many times "Man I wish this mechanic wasn't in the game because it makes it so easy."
---
This is a great quote and read.
---
CCP please put Falcon in charge of the next major update. This is a great vision for caps which would rebalance the game in the era of caps being easily obtainable.
---
I'd probably keep force aux but rebalance triage to have a rep penalty based on sig so they're good at repping caps but about equal to a Guardian at repping subcaps, restrict supers to heavy fighters only, and give carriers a place in defanging supers or fighting subcaps like they have now.
---
Good Post Olmeca
---
This is literally everything r/eve hated about caps 4 years ago. This sub is a complete joke.
---
So it's only the people fighting caps that need massive account support to win? Eh.
---
Assualt frigs excellent especially jaguars (i.e. ramjags) and retributions. Lookup assualt damage controls.
---
Pirate frigs excellent.
---
T3Ds very good especially Hecate. Hecate very high dps brawler.
---
Projectile weapons meh. Some say they are under powered.
---
Active small gang is generally limited to select faction warfare systems and wormholes.
---
Local was recently placed in delayed mode (aka wormhole mode) and has shaken nullsec up. I have heard hunting is better in null. I don't think it has been overly positive for small gang pvp in null although the jury may still be out.
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q
---
Above is a link to a solo frigate balance report that is very informative.
---
Oh so everything r/eve hated about caps 5 years ago, including the return of slowcats. This sub is a complete joke.
---
you can fix the game with far fewer words
---
1) stront citadel timers
---
2) remove local
---
3) remove support fighters, remove invulerability modules from non rorq caps
---
4) low power citadels have no ref timers
---
As someone who works developing complex systems, no amount of training actually beats understanding the system and what it's supposed to do.
---
Understanding that caps can have a place as a healthy part of the game, and dont right now, is understanding that you seem to have, and design team dont.
---
Amen brother
---
Yeah idk why people are complaining here. Triage carriers and the fax replacement were always oppressive. MR fax just need a substancial nerf to make them less usefull against subcaps... Maybe a good scan res nerf. 
---
Other than that fax are intended to sit in one place and rep the fuck out of things. Pretty simple
---
D
---
Pretty much the same reeeing we've been hearing from all of the null blocs since Black Out was implemented. I think the killboards show otherwise. I hope CCP doesn't cave to the whining.
---
All of the ideas presented there are just bad. How did you get elected? Oh yeah...
---
Carriers with Sentry drones
---
*Shudders*
---
It is easier now because you can just inject a super. They even got their damage nerfed because "250m/ticks" or whatever.
---
You can argue isk -&gt; plex -&gt; many accounts -&gt; many titans, but certainly it was not as it is now, and you still have to get more isk than average since plex goes up as a result of all this extra isk.
---
&gt;Not sure about covert ops cloaks on jfreighters though!
---
No high slots. It's about being able to jump to covert cynos. If you plan to nerf regular cynos (good!), it makes sense to give this buff to jump freighters in response.
---
There are DOZENS of us!
---
&gt; Then I'll just trade my titan to an alpha alt when I'm not using it.
---
Nono. 
---
Maintenance isn't for "you sitting in it".
---
It's for "this thing exists". Anywhere. At all.
---
&gt;Besides assuming that titans are too expensive to be common is what got us CCP into this mess in the first place.
---
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB
---
~200 titans on grid? Not common? What are you talking about.
---
&gt; 2 - Give jump freighters the ability to use covert cynos to move around 3 - Give jump freighters a covops cloak too.
---
Number 2 sounds good to me but number 3 seems unnecessary
---
50km wide SHIC bubble which also scrams everyone in it.
---
Until you realize that 'amateur' opinions from players who "love eve' that were implemented are what have pushed the game to the state it's at.
---
Sorry to disagree with the orthodoxy here, but more half-baked ideas aren't what the game needs.
---
Because thats what jump drives are for? Whats your fucking point?
---
Wait, if anchoring a highsec structure makes them highsec scrubs then isn't your coalition full of highsec scrubs?
---
Imperium has their own structures throughout highsec, has even fought numerous battles over highsec.
---
Did Hulkageddon make goons highsec scrubs?
---
No, you're just fucking moronic.
---
If you drop 5 titans, they will drop 20. Nullblocks have hundreds. This ship levels the playing field in those situations.
---
I want you to know, This pleases the nut.
---
Sounds reasonable!
---
I think it's because Hilmar is flying more and encountering more of the bullshit that he used to dismiss. Having the boss agree with you is a big confidence booster.
---
Lets be clear now.      
---
Fighting or hunting.             
---
Because if by thinking fighting you mean hunting thats like totally different items.       
---
You easily kill capitals in ships designed to do it ... simplest example bombers.            
---
But no 1 bomber vs 1 capital with don't do much.         
---
On the other side you can use few destroyers and chew the fighters to kill the carrier at the end.           
---
What is the issue again?
---
You need to limit the supply by fixing injectors and you need to nerf what you have.
---
Because that guy says so
---
Isnt the problem that they just put more caps on grid to compensate? If you nerf their damage by 20%, they just get 20% more caps.
---
Just a thought, but maybe not everyone should be afk moon-mining in null, lowsec is ripe for the taking.
---
Just wanted to add my voice in support. Capitals are one of the main reasons I stick to wormholes. Caps simply make subcaps obsolete in the great majority of situations. It’s crushing as a new player to have such a hard time being relevant in nulsec. Subcap nullsec feels like playing as kids, only to have the “adults” in caps come and push you aside when things get important.
---
Because im dropping a 5bil capital ship loot pinyata because im bored and fearless. Nullsec is inherently a game of capital ships. You roamed into my sovrign space looking for a fair fight, and you only brought 5 subcaps, and expect to hold a grid against me?
---
The triage has no hope of following you anywhere. Just leave.
---
I played another game similar to this years ago, it was all player driver content.  The world was dynamic for years, shifting alliances, coalitions, big dog being ganged up on, etc.
---
But over time, it coalesced into something similar to what we face now, two sides, one significantly stronger than the other.  Because the stronger side's members screamed for content, they had to keep engaging the weaker side, beating them further and further into obscurity.
---
Eventually, people that enjoyed the building side of that game moves to the stronger group, and the fighters just quit.  The game went from a membership of about 40,000 actives down to less than 5,000.  It is currently a shell of its former self.
---
Do I blame the stronger side for excelling?  No.
---
Do I feel loss at the game stagnating and wish something had prevented it?  Yes.
---
Rule #1 in many alliances and corps is, “Don’t be a dick.” That covers a lot of ground.
---
I shall promote perfect grammar within our prestigious corporation.
---
These changes are definitely interesting. It would effectively be a complete replacement of all current caps with brand new ships that have the same names, but I suppose it could work. However, the carrier changes seem off, I thought they intentionally removed sentry drone swarm triage carriers because they were extremely overpowered, this change would make them the meta again, especially without a targeted doomsday.
---
Le.  .t
---
CCP would have to enforce a hard limit ofc. The players will exploit anything they can. 
---
It wouldn't be difficult for CCP to do, and it is the way CCP originally intended caps to be used. 
---
You might think capitals online is a good game, but it doesn't mean that it is.
---
Honestly just make them use logi drones or fighters, so that they can be booshed killed webed scramed etc. at least give subcaps some chance.
---
Looks like an excellent summary of what a lot of people are thinking. Hopefully you get some ears on the dev team with this perspective.
---
Who is currently "countering" goons? My understanding is that its basically a stalemate.
---
If something is abundant, can it be important? Yes, but it will not be a concern because it is abundant. Perhaps a different phrasing would have been better.
---
It won't. For the same reason your group won't be able to field the same amount of Titans.
---
Why do you assume increased costs are a bad thing that wouldn't balance out as the market became profitable? I've seen enough things balanced by cost become cheap to know it'll take care of itself.
---
Slowcats again. Wonderful. Got any other groundbreaking ideas from 2014?
---
THRON
---
would it be worth it to overprop, losing a little volley, add webs for defense against tackle? it looks like it should be pretty damn hard to catch like that but keep most of its range and alpha strike. with short range ammo it only loses like 600 volley, just under 2k total.
---
If that works out it should make it a shit ton harder and more dangerous for a frigate to tackle someone out of the gang
---
It's nice to see this brought up. Always thought it was weird that a lot of descision-making at the fleet doctrine level is sort of just blown apart by "throw big weapwn at it lul" gameplay.
---
&gt;This means that there’s no need to actually sit down and craft a fleet composition before engaging an opposing fleet in a home defence situation
---
There still isn't.
---
In a home defense situation, driving off the attackers is sufficient.  You don't need to actually kill them all.
---
In my mind, it either aligns with CCP's general direction (Didn't Hilmar recently talk about the need to "shake things up"? That could mean more than the local/drifter things), or it could mean that Falcon knows CCP's general direction and is not happy with it, and that he's resorted to making "wishful thinking" posts to pressure the devs towards his line of thought. First one seems more likely though.
---
You know I'm pretty sure with a wig, some platform shoes, and a bit of makeup, we could totally pass you off as Fozzie.
---
We'd love to hear some of their ideas.
---
two words: trial balloon
---
If the target is dead before the jump happens, then it being effortless and reliable isnt particularly useful. Your super fleet arent going to chase Lokis around a region.
---
Something similar existed with ECM and it was cancer
---
That would be interesting. It might also effect wolf rayet wormhole fights, since a common doctrine there is fessors with guardians. If you make guardian reps not apply to destroyers then it’s a inderect buff to RLML ships in wolf rayets, and those are bad enough already. 
---
Of course, if you removed wolf rayet bonuses from rapid lights, then it would be fine
---
You won't have any markets in 3 months time, so get it in while you can.
---
Completely agree, and it was cancer when we did it too. NCPL utterly dumpstered the game balance with tracking titans and CCP saw it and said "hey, let's make that a feature".
---
Slowcats carriers would be back. Not much of a counter exists to 500 sentry drones being deployed by remote repping carriers
---
whoa when/why'd you part ways with HK?
---
bot lol
---
You don't need covert cloak to jump to covert cynos, cf. Black Ops (although majority opinion says they should have covert cloak)
---
If he had an actual non emotional argument he would have posted it. Don't hold your breath.
---
Use the other script, dude. Missile precision/ tracking speed for capital ships/battleships.
---
Oh, so you *are* going to delete every ship I own if my wallet reaches 0. I don't think that's reasonable.
---
CCP's history of titan related fuckups goes back a lot further than B-R. Like when they could fire DDs through cynos, but it's ok because titans are rare and always will be.
---
Fighter control is the sole reason I still have carrier skills. 
---
Love that shit.
---
Yes but no. You're conflating N+1 with balance there.
---
If it takes 10 ships to alpha 1, then a 20% damage nerf means it takes 12 ships. This would determine the point at which the fight is considered a waste of time. N+1 comes into play.
---
For balance purposes, 20% nerfs change *what* ships come into play. For example, if a ships usually reaches 15% HP before logi can lock and rescue it, a 20% HP nerf means that ship stops being viable in that situation and the meta shifts, N+1 or not.
---
You should make a weekly post with a dump of your thoughts on some topic. It's great for sparking discussions.
---
High SP requirement doesn't equal to high skill requirement. When you turn it into somewhat proper comps and upscale a bit (to, say, 50v50 players, add whatever level of multiboxing is doable/necessary), then frigate/destroyer fleet (Stukas with solid boosh support) has decent chance of holding the grid and getting kills against carriers if they're flown correctly. The problem with caps isn't as much their raw power, as how hard it is for average cap pilot to mess up enough to either cause him to lose their ship or put entire fleet in danger. In age of injectors, SP barrier is mostly irrelevant, and caps being overall quite easy to fly in fleet situations it takes away the "rewarding" part of the game, when you as group can outprepare and outskill opponents without them being able to just loljump superblob because they could mine/rat more time and have bigger super/cap fleet on hand. Why even try to be a good pilot and learn the game if you can instead VNI until you can afford a titan instead?
---
So you think that devaluing something that took years to obtain is going to keep those active players playing the game. Got it. Mind that those are the same players that keep the game alive.
---
Nanosence,  suitonia only flies kestrels
---
Now there's a thought.
---
I played long ago (2008-2012), and just returned this past week when I heard about the blackout. Someone told me to look up Bosons... I threw up a little in my mouth.
---
And I immediately fucked off to wormhole space cause the PvP seems way more interesting there.
---
One of us! One of us! One of us!
---
I was actually thinking, this is a small idea but still worth saying.
---
I remember from the Jamyl Sarum event that the Amarr Avatar went with the Empire Cynosoral Network. So CCP could for example, introduce a flat 10 Mil/AU tax for example? It could be 10/mil per system skipped via shortest route but that doesn't exactly make sense when it comes to 3 dimensional space.
---
At least it'd be a bit of an ISK sink. People could perhaps take those gates to save on iskies if they think they're safe (Que content)
---
Doomsdays and NSAs already have massive drawbacks to using them.
---
&gt; Sketching out the EHP progression you have in mind would put Carriers and Dreads at around ~500,000 EHP, and Supers/Titans anywhere from 4-5 million given appropriate bling if the scaling goes off of a "baseline Tech 2 fit" EHP.
---
Yep, these numbers would work
---
If remote reps would continue to work how they do now, remote rep combat carriers would still be unusable.
---
Because to us it did not matter. Anyway, somewhere in one of those threads, there is the answer as the person came forward because he couldn't watch how much shit I was eating.
---
The only reason BS aren't used more often is because caps smack them around and HACs dont get smacked around as bad. BS trade favorably against HACs.
---
Nah, just buy PLEX for ISK based on what you can afford. If all you fly is T1 frigates/cruisers, then 1billion ISK would be beyond more than enough to keep you funded for a few months. That way you can more honestly determine if this game is fun for you or not.
---
Shadowplay only works in fullscreen mode.
---
As far as OBS, it's likely an issue with your settings or something. I can record my gameplay at 1080/60 on a 1070ti with a i7-8700k. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CVr_CaWxSo) an example I recorded.
---
CCP take note. 
---
Fantastic observations and solutions.
---
But ECM just stopped you locking anything up - I'm talking more about the ability of a lucky shot to hit a vital area and take something offline or damage a component. It could even be used as a balance on ammo types, so some may do less damage but have a higher change of a critical.  
---
I definitely don't want old ECM back - I'm seeing more a situation of 100 rifters attacking a Titan and being able to take the boson offline for 10 seconds, or the engines, or a hardener. And if you're worried about the ISK imbalance remember every one of those ships needs a pilot, that's the limiting factor.  
---
Just the start of an idea though...
---
Old POSes had stront coasting, initial bashing early to get exit fights in a better tz for the attacker, and other similar mechanics which allowed for some control over exit timers by both parties. Any thoughts on some form of that as opposed to a purely random exit? I can imagine the randomness ending up more frustrating than helpful for everyone.
---
Nothing wrong with capitals just people want to be able to kill them with cheaper stuff. 
---
Small gangs want to have prey, they keep asking for it to be easier. It’s the equivalent of setting up a tabletop game with point weight and selection one side says here I maxed out my 100 points and here is my side I have defended farms and structures. The opponent wants to take out your side but only wants to field small stuff that’s easily replaced and not worry about anything else and only uses 10 points then bitches when he loses and says it’s too hard. 
---
He could bring big stuff and really commit but it’s far more work and effort than they want to put forward. He wants his wrecking machine to be cheap and easy and work on any toy you bring no matter what. If you left balance up to hunters you would have no intel no cynos cloaks for everything. They would need the shit out of everything big or any defensive measure then wonder why no one lives in null anymore for them to farm.
---
There’s lots of excellent ideas in here!
---
I very much like the idea of using hulls for their intended purpose.
---
I remember a time where the skies were full of Ravens :-).
---
Great ideas, mostly all supported.
---
Nerf not need, English is hard
---
Honest answer? By several thousand people that voted for him because he speaks for their view point.
---
The day these Capitals changes take place, if they do, will be awsome!! #CCPlease
---
Both are good posts. The issue is that all of this should have come out years and years before.
---
Eve is a LOT persistent, the only way to nullify the amount of work done grinding all these titans would be to cut their effective tank (thus value) by 10 or 100 so a dread or subcap fleet could do some damage.
---
The only way to make a supercap more reasonable is to make it overly expensive for the utility it gives, like a very expensive mineral brick that can do very little more than the tier below it.
---
Lmao, It's not the Structure being in Highsec, it's that people like you are getting all Salty because one of them had their tax go up.
---
Learn to fucking read before smugging.
---
Both, i got what i spent
---
You don't need to eat it tbh if you didn't do it, you or whoever did should apologize to allowx and if possible the community cause that's low AF
---
they would reee for days that it would make nulsec too safe if they can’t figure out where we are ratting.
---
the "engines" are exhaust and provide no thrust.
---
no matter what happens, if too much changes in a short period your literally gona piss off everyone and you will end up with no players.
---
&gt;Yes but no. You're conflating N+1 with balance there.
---
No, but they are not unrelated. If something is nerfed, you have to do it so it isnt easily compensated for.
---
You realize the 20% was just an example. A real nerf would not be that simple.
---
please, please God, let him be right
---
I'm on board for everything except for the return of slowcats.
---
&gt;A battleship that could fit cap logi would be a terrible idea. Just the same as a battleship that could fit dread guns.
---
We currently have cruisers that fit battleship logi.  A battleship that fits size+1 logi would seem to be appropriate.
---
Those are two of the busiest systems. I still wouldn't worry about it, but basically if you start having trouble, run a few missions.
---
This. So much this. Its never too late to change direction. No cynos in lowsec may make traveling very, very hard if you are attacking people who arent your neighbors but aside from that a version of all of these ideas would be great.
---
Doesn't work that way, a Hel with a NSA fit, has 525mm scan res, 1 module.   If I were to remove all mids from a nightmare, you get 571, it took 7 modules to get a comparable scan res, and it only involved removing all tackle, mobility, cap, and tank.  
---
The Fax keeps his tank, and his ability to all his regular tasks, a super keeps everything, just adds the ability to lock out to anything on the grid, and engage all their damage and ewar and inty scan res, for one module.  
---
BB lock times are totally a joke compared to Caps and supers paths around the issue.
---
stop posting these
---
Yes, I realise that was just an example, that balance and N+1 are related, and that the full truth is a little more complex than two short reddit posts can contain.
---
Wouldn't the tornado be better than the tempest? I have heard they fill similar roles, and that the tornado is more prominent.
---
Ask people in frigates what they think about "wrecking shots" - not meant as a shitpost reponse, but a legit concern item.
---
replace the word capital with battleship and you have all the same problems, which shows this argument is bullshit.
---
Were you incouraged by CCP to make this post? bcuz if this is a trial baloon, we want these changes, like, a LOT. lol
---
Because realistic space warships probably aren't very aesthetic. 
---
I'm a big fan of "hard" science fiction, and a couple of years ago I went on a tangent to look into what actual combat in space would be like. One of the more persuasive arguments I read was in favor of sphere shaped fighters that have thrusters and weapons systems in clusters all around the model, making for much better maneuverability. Brilliant idea (as long as there's no human pilot trying to survive crushing g force shifting directions that quickly) but it would look more like a 1970s idea of space than most modern games would prefer.
---
That said, the Expanse has some pretty nifty thoughts that make a good counter argument. I like their idea of treating ships like skyscrapers in space that are oriented up/forward due to g force from thrust. The enemy's gate is down, etc. Those ships are at least a little closer to the Eve aesthetic.
---
On one hand, that sounds kinda terrible.
---
On the other hand, fuck it. Let's turn this whole game on its head and see what happens.
---
I'm glad CCP is still talking to the community so openly. This is a good move for keeping us in the game. You got me back with the Blackout, after a year of being away. But all this sounds fantastic and good for all my styles of play. Keep up the good work and pitch this to every game designer in the building!
---
Why though? Get better at catching people.
---
Neanderthal. 
---
Can't trust people who eat pineapple on pizza.
---
Carriers as an anti-sub role is great.  This is what they were designed for when released.  Bringing back the intended role of these ships instead of the Swiss Army Knife that all capitals have become is the biggest issue.  Reduce tracking more on HAW guns needs to happen.  Doing this without further nerfing the Moros would be pretty cool.  In fact, a little buff the the Moros would be nice.  Biased because that is the one I can sit in and was at one point the best for dreadbombs.
---
Really, from where I stand it looks like a good excuse for them to get some form of content, content they're enjoying.
---
Before you throw salt labels around you should probably go ahead and check to see if anyone is actually crying on the other side. Doesn't seem to be the case, they actually seem to be laughing about this whole situation.
---
"mountains of evidence"
---
Provides none
---
Haha, no.
---
Look up I linked the Reddit post
---
I agree with a lot of what you've said, but it's not even just about what people will engage and what they wont engage any more on the fleet level, its these massive NIPs and NAPs which have stifled any real meaningful content in nullsec. I'm not claiming that we're blameless; NCPL farmed smaller groups as much as, if not more than, any other major group and that pushed them to huddle together in mega coalitions to avoid just being deleted from the map for someone else's kicks.
---
But it's important to look at where we are as a game, where we want to be, and how to get there.
---
Do we want TQ to now just be a server where coalitions of tens of thousands fight each other('s structures) once a year, petrified of actually killing each other off in case they're left with no one left to fight, or would we prefer smaller blocs with meaningful and perpetual border conflicts?
---
Do we think that the optimal fleet should be 199 titans, 50 fax, and a cyno recon, or do we want newer and lower SP players to have a place in fleet fights in their Maelstroms and Jackdaws more than just for a bit of fun?
---
Cost is no longer a balancing factor for conflict or for fleet compositions. Massive horizontal mining operations have made it meaningless to fight any kind of economic warfare, which has always traditionally been an option (see SV against CO2, or TISHU before WWB).
---
Mercenary contracts, once a staple of nullsec, have all but died out. Nomadism, a massive content creator in the past, is being starved of income by that and by the moon changes. Goons have won Eve as a result of these mechanical changes, and their prize is a declining population, stale nullsec, and an ever-dwindling number of enemies left to shoot at.
---
To touch on your Rorqual point: I wouldn't have an issue with Rorquals being exceptionally hard to kill if they weren't also the best mining ship in the game, same with supers and ISK printing. What I have an issue with isnt the lack of free killmails, it's the lack of any game mechanic by which one can meaningfully conduct economic warfare any more without playing the sov null krabbing game and doing a heavy deployment.
---
Eve used to be a game of options: you could be industrially based, moon based, rental based, mercenary contract based... all of those options except one are disappearing and we have a much worse game for it.
---
At least that's what I did, salvaged all I could, while occasionally killing fools who went suspect near my Thrasher, and stealing shit myself if it was worth it. Made like a cool bil in an evening, but by far the best part was all the salt, from smack talk in local to impotent yellowboxing, some dudes even blew up their wrecks so that nobody gets them. It was hilarious.  
---
Also, the bounty is paid out just before the last wave spawns, consisting of the commander whatshisface.
---
I mean, considering OP is lumping together Enemies that are only protecting their Business interests in Highsec and you're sitting here projecting on a comment talking about shitting up local, It's quite easy to get confused.
---
most common reason:
---
a buyer wants to buy multiple items. they rightclick on a sellorder that has enough to buy all they want and buy at that price (from as many lower priced sellorders as necessary)
---
I'm out of the loop for the most part. Kill2 quit a while back, am I right?
---
That will help the gankers too for high sec.
---
well that cap blob can be used for someting good if we get bored well just kill some goons in null and they will never know what hit them #blackoutkillsgoons
---
A real.life aircraft carrier I'd about the size of a cruiser and requires 5,000 people to operate
---
Yes, right now I'm helping/tutoring a true newbie on a one on one basis. Giving him advise, showing him play style options, creating an alt to go with him. So far we've done wormholing, travelling through nullsec, did ninja salvaging, exploration and all kinds of other stuff. It works (and I'm willing to put in effort) because he's clearly not an idiot and is willing to put in effort himself. He's progressing faster than his skill points allow for. 
---
But a standard new player who doesn't really interact, and has an average (so low) amount of effort and eagerness to learn, who ends up in one of the "newbie friendly" alliances? Ehh, not so much.
---
I was making a comment on how inaccurate it was for someone to call Volta highsec scrubs, if that's projection in your opinion, that koolaid must be really be hitting today champ.👌
---
I don't like the idea of no more caps in lowsec, but otherwise niceeeeee (i'd have to get a JF, i use a Rorqual atm to move around).
---
I don't know if caps/supers should be prohibited from anoms, but i think that warping them there should cause an escalation to some kind of npc caps, with good tracking, 0 bounty and 0 loot table, who happen to hit and track exceptionally well.
---
Then u gt a combat timer so response fleet can kill u. Great idea!!!
---
Piling on the train here, would love to see your thoughts
---
Buy 10 merlins...lose 10 merlins. Reciew ur lessons. Repeat.
---
When the Big Bad Braxus betrayed Noobman and the forever loyal Jerzii who totally didn't deserve to banned for a year
---
Ya exactly. Make jumping painful as possible but not impossible and therefore gating more attractive.
---
I think it's healthier with hunters having to run around in adjacent systems looking to see if that carrier is trying to cloak up in a safe after jumping somewhere closeby or is in a kick out station because the nearest non-kickout is out of range rather than just seeing perma gate camps of asset safety systems.
---
Yeah, I have been in favor of removing API-exposed NPC kill and traffic statistics from nullsec with the advent of the blackout. Local's been brought to parity with wormhole space; why not the API information, too?
---
Warping on grid with caps is a death sentence. People put up stop bubbles quickly and can strand capitals 100km or more from the person they were trying to save. Only subcaps can warp to people dying and still that is dangerous. It only takes 20-30 torp bombers to kill a rorqual, how many can a cerb kill before the rorqual dies?
---
What is closest null/low to jita and do you have cheap merlin fit to try on random dudes
---
Nah you can both share it's best this way
---
Would you (orcanyone else for this matter) explain that further please? Right now I'm stuck on Newton's laws and am having trouble not seeing the exhaust as thrust.
---
I don't think you should be that worried about what is frowned upon and not in the grand scheme of things. :)
---
That being said, when i introduced newbies to ways of making a ton of cash early on in EVE, many times they quit. 
---
The desire, spark, need and drive were gone because of this.
---
So i would say buy some, but not that much, leave some of that drive, need, spark there.
---
Huh?
---
I may be wrong, but that's already close to what I think is already an existing podcast, called talking in station? At least I think it's a podcast, I've had it recommended to me on YouTube in the past but I never watched it.
---
When i get home ill mail some to u.
---
... and this is why i say - our sandbox should be not so flat.            
---
We are constantly mixing gameplays that are not simply fit with each other.  
---
You cannot compare 5 vs 5 , 50 vs 50 and 50vs 500 or 500 vs 500.              
---
Simple example.       
---
You say "skill" but how do you define "skill" in game like eve.          
---
* You have people who can bump cruisers instead of pointing them to prevent the warp.        
---
* People who can setup a industry chain running 24/7 without a single delay.             
---
* People that will maximize to the max the output of the pve ratting.       
---
* You will also find those that will hunt a single guy for 3 months just to score a AT ship kill dropping a super on him           
---
* Guy that will cyno in a titan in the middle of enemy move op just to boson unsuspecting people and get out.       
---
* Hunter that will outplay you and tackle you even if you had eyes in all systems around you        
---
* A baiter that will make you cry when you look on your kill board next day              
---
**All those people have THE SKILL** and there is plenty more "skills" out there.                 
---
Tell me why do you assume that your SKILL is the only one that counts?                      
---
Simply different one
---
That post ignores every discord shitpost allox made before hand prodding reza, as well as edited comms. I was there first hand, and he refused to acknowledge he was being dumb and doubled down trying to callout the leadership.
---
Please bud, get your facts straight
---
5 minutes is way too long. I want to nerf the mechanic overall, not completely kill it :D
---
Pushing that bloc mentality as hard as possible. 
---
"Blackout is only hurting the little guy"
---
Fuck off, when did big blocs start giving a single shit about the little guy. That narrative is trash.
---
he also makes isk from the killright he gets when he get podded 
---
if you make killright 10-20m most ppl that live/travel alot in hi-sec will buy the killright whit a alt/friend so they can travel in hi-sec whitout the cheap killright
---
This post is missing what caused the spam of Titans and supers in the first place , Injectors.
---
I can't remember whether it's official explanation or just *best we have*, but due to the warp capabilities of our ships we are anchored to the subspace (thus limiting max speed) and making thrusters obsolete.
---
When your ship moves, the warpcore drags the ship around the subspace and the exhaust is what you see.
---
Ganking ratters is the PVP equivalent of sucking veld in highsec, I don't think it needs to be any easier. I'd rather CCP focus on the problems keeping actual PVP from happening in null.
---
Several thousand people that were told to vote for him. Don't pretend like you have free will idiot.
---
If we want to make it so a capital can't hurt a frigate because of tracking, just give super massive sized ships an innate resist so frigate sized weapons can't hurt them. Road goes both ways.
---
Cyno is a problem now?
---
I’m curious when you say no caps in anoms do you mean in just kspace? Half of the reason why WHlers rage role is to find those ratting caps which sometimes escalate to a full on engagement. Same can also really be said for kspace as well. With nothing out there to hunt there is not much motivation to hunt.
---
The PH boys were saying this, but the PL guys too?
---
You ever wonder why we're here?
---
Braxus had nothing to do with my banning.  I've just recently returned to eve and am taking a different path this time, simple as that.
---
Can't afford to lose != can't afford to replace. And your behaviour makes it pretty clear that you couldn't afford to lose it.  
---
P.S. : from someone who survived being ganked by that dude to someone who didn't - git gud.
---
2. Go to a low sec belt with 4 alts, put two in Hulks, put one in a tackle Porpoise, and put one in a cloaky T3. It's too juicy for them not to drop on you.
---
You do not need to bling them, T1 guns, T2 tank and Refits for cap and drifter. 2.5 bill dread pulling in almost 1 bill an hour vs 20bill super pulling in 300 mill an hour. There is no comparison. But lets keep making dumb suggestions to mess with anom ratting.
---
What on earth is that windows vista inn 2019?
---
When I do undock I often find myself sitting in a scimitar, but I tend to undock for my small gang corp so we use subcap logi.
---
I agree with a lot of this.  One thing im not so sure about is stopping people ratting in anoms with carriers and supers.  I dont mind doing something to balance this activity, but taking it away would be removing top level pve that a lot of players aspire to.
---
5 minutes
---
krabbing in 2019, y u so hard
---
None of this goes both ways. Battleships can't track frigates. Why would capitals? 
---
"Frigates shouldn't easily hurt capitals" is already ensured by greater ehp.
---
Yeah that's kind of my point
---
&gt;Max DPS  
---
   
---
&gt;Armor  
---
Pick one
---
Well, seems like we need to:
---
&gt;6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate. 
---
this is already how it currently works
---
I didn't make it through the first 2 sentences.
---
From what the lads upstairs were saying: You can only infer but so much from just a few pages of ever changing rules
---
Um, you aren't following the black out narrative if you think that's true about ganking ratters my friend.
---
Done that. :/
---
You're disgusting, and you should feel bad.
---
Hmm, assuming you are talking about the hurricane, under 2k alpha is very low. Perfect skills get you 4k with EMP and three gyros. And a 100MN does sound tempting on paper, you usually need a decent tank in the first place in order to hold out until you get out of hostile damage range. It takes a very long time to get up to speed, and the shield buffer on that is very slim. 
---
But hey, the hull is 40M. If you think it might work, just try it and let us know.
---
no one will fight us in them. :(
---
Would you give carriers their drone bays back?
---
goodbye
---
Skill extractors...
---
Caps need to be strategic assets, not an ad hoc bailout force.
---
With overprop I got it at 3.5k volley. I'll let you know if/when we can get our new guys trained up in it
---
Would you though?  I think reddit would have a meltdown.
---
yup ccp can give us some .... not giving them more money, they shaft people then expect them to pay more, I dont think so.
---
You asked for evidence I gave you evidence and it doesn't matter if he had Wally levels of sperg the reason why he was kicked is unacceptable on every level

As a returning player who has come and gone from EVE many times since the early days I would say drastic measures like this are deeply needed.  It's sort of funny seeing the game in snapshots.  I was recently with a Bombers bar fleet and we had a pair of the capital indy ships tackled, a cyno opens and I expect to see bridged cruisers or something else fast to murder us.  Nope 15 caps and those 15 caps could bother invalidate 100 nerds in frigs a kill fast moving frigs as cap ships.  Just a personal story of shock of coming back to the game.
---
I'm not in the same camp. I don't see it as a positive that a battleship cannot typically kill a frigate unless the frigate is disastrously stupid. Frigate vs. Destroyer, toss up but usually destroyer. Frigate vs. cruiser, cruiser most of the time. Frigate vs. BC, typically BC if it has any tracking. Frigate vs. Battleship, good luck catching the Frigate. I get that it's part of the mechanics to allow smaller ships to have a place in the game. I also get because of their cost and overall higher warp and maneuvering speed that frigates and destroyers are the typically small gang ship. But I personally think Battleships are in a bad place and could use double the scan res and 50 % more tracking.
---
It's entirely possible this is a very casual way of running a bunch of stuff by us and seeing what sticks. Making that many changes is a lot of developer time (even if it may not seem like it, since doing things like reverting faxes to carriers is complex) so if the playerbase was abjectly against it, this is a *really* good way of doing a quick check of making sure it wouldn't be a complete waste of time and money.
---
I like a lot of this. There are a could of sticking points though. 
---
First, I like bringing caps into anoms, it allows for fight progression. It would also mess with rorqual mining, and fights centered around them. Perhaps just only covert cynos in anoms so caps have to warp in?
---
Second, giving carriers sentry drones brings with it the strength of drone auto-agro and drone assisting. It makes it much harder to deal with carriers through jamming or tracking disrulting the fighters, though granted its mich easier to just kill the sentries. The assisting isssue is that with 15 sentries each its very easy to multibox carriers by personally assisting 3 of your carriers' drones to a 4th, leading to things like 3 carriers sacrificing lock range in exchange for tons of application mods, damage mods, or tank, as only the drone bunny needs the lock range.
---
As far as supers taking gates, that is a miracle for the logistics of moving. I would not want it removed entirely, but maybe restrict it to only gates capable of moving them, like regional gates. Alternatively if movement speed is the concern, perhaps removing capital hyperspatial rigs could have the wanted hit. This would not affect freighters since they dont have rigs, but would cut the max warp speed of supers almost in half.
---
Finally, perhaps if we really want dreads to be the biggest guns in the game, they could get a damage buff but an application nerf to ensure that added damage can only go into citadels or caps. Perhaps allow dread damage to exceed citadel damage cap to some extent?
---
I am sure that others have made many other suggestions based on your thoughts as well, but it feels good to get my 2 cents in edgewise.
---
The rep grind is much, much faster than the ISK grind.
---
Oh gosh I wouldn't want to have my own opinion now would I?
---
I like the blackout because it changed everything about null, not just ratting. It changed how people camp gates, how fleets move around and run into each other, how bots work (or don't work), it made people rely on each other more for safety. And given a few more weeks I think things will settle into a new normal that might be better or worse than what we had before, but at least CCP's trying something different.
---
Your suggestion, on the other hand, is just about making ratters easier to gank. Not interested.
---
&gt; I don't see it as a positive that a battleship cannot typically kill a frigate unless the frigate is disastrously stupid.
---
Then you disagree with the above rule of thumb. 
---
&gt; 1) Bigger ship is slower (in ongrid speed, warp speed, targeting speed, and so on), applies worse, has more ehp and has more damage.
---
Sorry, but that rule is inherent to Eve game design. It is widely accepted, and I won't attempt to convince you why it's really important.
---
ive had no issue using shadowplay in window mode
---
Of all the things that aren't "realistic" about Eve the appearance isn't something I've worried about.
---
Now, why ships coast to a stop without any counter-thrust .... that's another story.
---
(Yes, I know EVE is based on a submarine simulator.)
---
&gt;flame away bois I know you're gonna
---
Says the guy flaming about changes to ships he likes. 
---
Eve changes, ships change, mechanics change, everything is subject to change. That's what you get with a long running game where fundamental changes have to happen to keep the game balanced. 
---
You are aware that fundamental changes happened to get the big boy toys into the state they're at right? If you like it now, think about all the people who got "screwed over" when he mechanics changed the first time. 
---
If you don't like the change, voice your opinion, sure, but also learn to accept that change is necessary. CCP isn't beholden to one person because they like that change while thousands more agree that capitals are cancer in their current state. 
---
If you like the big fleet meta, you can keep doing that, but realize that roles change. 
---
Carriers used to be a triage ship before faxes were introduced. 
---
People skilled directly into the Proteus for it's brick tank hunting capability. 
---
Drake's used to be the shit. 
---
Rorquals used to be pure off grid boosters with no independent mining capability to sniff at. 
---
Titans used to take at least a month to build, not including components. 
---
The whole ecm change. 
---
Carriers and super carriers used to carry regular drones in addittion to fighters, creating the slow cat meta,
---
Titans used to have AOE Doomsday's,
---
Haws didn't used to exist. 
---
The moros had hella drones. 
---
And these are just the ones I can think of right off my head.
---
It was more rhetorical than anything. 
---
The irony is people keep trying to compare the changes to making the game a more WoW-like, them park MMO, which is a complete stretch to try to draw any sort of comparison. Yet here's Dunk suggesting we have rotating events for Null sec space for no other reason than to "spice things up". What could be more theme park than that? At least the Drifters and Trigs play in to the lore. 
---
He's supposed to speak for the thousands of people that voted for him though, the same people that are screeching about their disagreement of the "WoW-like" changes in the game. Can you see where shit just starts looking rediculous?
---
data sites do that, not relic
---
Ask this guy in particular how a couple of wrecking shots in a row feels like. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77789901/
---
Are you referring to Falcon's ideas? I think it's a little early or wasted to get "pissed off."
---
Show us on the VNI where the roaming gang touched you.
---
oh ok.
---
different path by joining another c5 corp or am i missing something?
---
Restrict buying plex to after you work overtime.
---
But we don’t fight 100 man bomber fleets versus another fleet. They come out of wormholes to gank people. In regards to home defense, no one comes to delve to fight, they come to kill and we respond accordingly
---
I think if this were done it would have to come with another nerf to drone bunnies. Maybe that could be a nerf that only applies to caps, but honestly I would like to see the entire mechanic done away with. There is no other offensive system that allows a commander to fire for you.
---
That's a great way to cripple any group smaller than Goons, TEST, NCPL, or FRT.
---
You can't even put cyno beacons in lowsec.
---
this is literally awful
---
This was actually the KM I had in mind when I posted that. Kudos.
---
Hah, fair enough. 
---
Max DPS for the fit :-P  The Aerator rig uses up a ton of calibration
---
Doubtful.  You have to pay attention while running a gila.
---
&gt; deleting all cynos and making everyone gate
---
For fairness, remove wormholes too ... err ...
---
I think the vast majority of these are at the very least on the right track. I love the titan changes and making carriers rely on sentries to have any chance of reliable damage against subcaps seems ideal.
---
Also, as a JF pilot, the idea of being able to route without requiring a station at every landing spot is **THE BEST IDEA EVER**. Being able to still use corvette cynos on stations is a nice plus, but man I'd be thrilled to park a bunch of Anathemas (or legit just burn one around instead of having alts) and secretly move my JF wherever thanks to the covops cloak, while still having to make sure I don't get combat probed while the JF is moving. Seriously, this is really, really interesting and while most of the discussion is about capital balance, don't forget about this one.
---
look how fast the blackout went from hilmars off the cuff comment to being in game, things can move fast it seems faster than a lot of people were expecting so I don't think its too early to worry about it.
---
I mean, if Drifter's came in and glassed a region over 30-60 days. It would force everyone living there to migrate. I don't agree with that direction, but it would sure make people move.. or quit.
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
I hope they don't entirely delete FAXes, they look pretty sweet. Maybe make them Triage Carriers, with the changes u/CCP_Falcon suggested, and then make standard Carriers heavily nerfed as-is. We definitely need to delete all support fighters, though. Make carriers rely on subcaps for support.
---
Man this was a tough one, I couldn't find a single instance of a small entity choosing to use a triage fax over logi. Strange I know

---
a logi proteus can move around the grid*, actually disengage* and capital weapons don't apply to it(normally). a fax can't really do that, it also needs to be prestaged and to have an alt outside of the fleet for it ready.
---
*: well, a subcap logi can, not sure if a proteus can tho ))
---
Your tracking depends on your target's signature radius. You multiply the base tracking of the drones with target sig radius and divide by sig resolution.
---
For ship turrets they changed the displayed attribute to incorporate the sig resolution, but that also meant that you can't easily compare your tracking to your target's angular velocity.
---
Nullbears hate him!
---
&gt;Honnestly, i jsut proof to falcon he doesn't know game mechanics.   
---
&gt;Where is the troll ? Maybe i do'nt follow REDDIT rethoric? But all my post was truth for the moment so ... how bad are you ?
---
That mechanic changed a long long time ago, thankfully.
---
There's no such thing as bait. 
---
Only unfortunately punctual reinforcements.
---
Is it a rule of thumb if it only holds true with battleships? Every other ship type in the game can effectively fight a frigate or destroyer 1 v 1.
---
Your whatnow
---
If you have money to throw away:
---
1) buy plex
---
2) sell for ISK
---
3) first round: buy 30 frigates basic fit, fit basic fit, have RED FROG or someone move that load to low-sec have a blast  
---
4) if you still have ISK left buy 30 destroyers, basic fit. Pay hauler to move stuff to low-sec, 
---
have a blast rinse and repeat. if you feel like, increase the ship size. Frig should be around 5M ISK, destroyer 10M ISK etc.
---
My suggestion simply means that a ratter has to bounce one-whole-time to a safe. That is a lot of effort, right?
---
Do whatever you like man, it's a video game. If that's fun for you then go for it.   
---
Just realize that you will lose tons of ships (if you plan to PvP or PvE) no matter how much SP you inject or bling mods you buy.
---
The exception to this is to inject into a capital, join a nullbloc and only drop it under their umbrella when they have good numbers logged in.
---
If you do that, you can have no clue what you are doing and still get plenty of kills and potentially never lose a ship, so long as you google a decent fit that has a lot of EHP and watch a few youtube videos on what the different buttons do - particularly the cyno one.
---
\^\^\^That might sound like a joke, but it's not.
---
Best troll post of the day.
---
If you're not throwing your fleet into something that's guarenteed to end with one side or more going home in new clones while screaming the whole time you can go back to wow
---
The meta changes, adapt.
---
You are mistaking a wish list of ideas from a CCP employee for a Dev blog of what's coming. There has been no official Dev blog or post that has said hey big things coming for capitals. Maybe take a breather next time before you post.
---
The Drifter event seemed to be a limited time event that played in to progressing the storyline and support lore reasons for major system changes like they did with the entosis system. The suggestions on his blog were to randomly change attributes of systems and rotate that for....no real reason.
---
I love the idea of Dreads being the beef in the capital fight, however that begs the question of why is there only hull in that class? It's about time for a second dread hull! The Dread equivalent of a Mothership, call it ship of the line or something. I could see there being a role for a more offensive dread (assault module maybe) with more turrets but not able to use siege modules.
---
Essentially scale up the dynamic with BS, have the Moros be the ultimate version of the tristan - Vexor - Dominix line and some new dread be the ultimate version of the Incursus - Thorax - Megathron line.
---
You have a good point, but the way it is now is not tenable. And if CCP changes it they agree, if not, they dont. Besides, nerf rage is nothing new in mmos.
---
Just fyi. A carrier is called a carrier because of the fighters (to which they qre properly scaled), not so much due to the fact it cant also ‘carry’ two battleships (to which it obviously isnt scaled)
---
I'm not a fan of completely deleting an existing ship class, but shifting the Force Aux out of combat and into a role where they're in a safespot healing ships that warp in before they can rejoin the battle would be cool.
---
If we speak about refund, then CCP should also reset everything, right? If you've trained supercarrier, because of save ratting and cancer umbrella mechanics, then along with refund CCP should also take away all iskies/modules you have ever ratted with supercar. Agreed? 
---
CCP never guaranteed you anything about ships and it's role. Apparently you have already benefited from ship in some way, and it doesn't matter if some significant changes will occur. Back into good old days of EVE each and every expansion changed ships and metas drammatically. Not like last 3-5 years there is only supercap umbrella meta.
---
You fucking don't. That's why the Venture exist: to be disposable if ppl do catch you mining in hostile places. If you can't afford to replace one, build up your income streams till you can.
---
The discussion on nullsec FCs doesn't really go into the big part of it - the main FCs are hesitant to share their fame, and often shit on people on the way up. There's very little opportunity to grow, even with the fcs that ARE good enough, or even better than the FCs people have heard of.
---
strat op/cta whatever. but at the time, thems were the rules. we were on this max form up thing and it was expected that if you were online, you'd be on the fleet. instead, he popped up roaming with reds. could have said something and all of it avoided.
---
things change, people grow up. old days and ways are behind us.
---
Shadowplay in windowed mode is recording the desktop, not the direct window. It will work, but performance can suffer and you can record stuff you don't want.
---
I can't tell if this is a shitpost or not
---
If you can't afford an overpriced operating system you might at least go with Linux. I mean, you should go with Linux anyways, but still.
---
I may be wrong but as I understand it the local blackout spawned from hilmar talking to the fans and saying that nullsec was too safe, maybe we should do something about it, not a quote but something along those lines, the dev blog I guess came later.
---
It only takes a comment from a dev in the office to get others thinking about it and talking about and potentially then doing it.
---
Yeah. Make this happen. There isn't anything here that wouldn't work. Add onto the marauders class as a clear midway between dreads and subcaps (IE make them dread support ships to counter subs), and you've got an all around winner there.
---
It wasnt so skillful outside of the niche wh cases, and mostly easy peasy shit in large blob warfare. Skill aspect of it was heavily overstated.
---
Youre ignoring the fact that he wasnt k8cked for attending the fleet.
---
He was kicked when after he was asked to explain what happened (because he informed 0 people prior to ot happening) he got super angry and abusive so he was nomad purged for raging out on discord and comms.
---
Happens to alot of people, then after 24gours when they chill out they get invited back. Well allox decided it was a good idea to leak our discord and cherrypicked logs instead of waiting, and thats when he burned the bridge.
---
I've never noticed a performance hit, but that may be just because of my computer being able to handle it. And yea it records the desktop, I've just learned to be mindful of the fact from my streaming days.
---
Ok, so everyone has to actually f monkey rather than just letting FC do it for them. Doesn’t really change too much.
---
And if drag bubbles become an issue they can just warp to more safes that they've made until you're gone. Or just warp to one of several structures likely to be present in the system. If they happen to have a safe in dscan range in one of them they'll also see if you picked the ''correct'' structure.
---
Worst case, I guess they can just fint a cloak in an empty highslot to allow them to cloak in one of their safes and align to a structure / another safe if combat probes are present.
---
So what was the strategy bashing is Citadel toasting some irrelevant groups sov? Definitely way more important then a memorial room for a dead friend
---
Yea, I'm not really disagreeing with you or in support of it. But I do see a value in something maybe story line to drive migration. Resource scarcity, NPC presence (incursion spreading system to system over a 30-60 day time period), NPC event in a region that escalates over time and the rewards of fighting/farming it are rare enough that people contest it.
---
Falcon is trying to make this a reality as well as character sex/bloodline swaps.
---
Falcon take my energy
---
* Capital Remote Rep sig radius dependent application.  "HAW" rep.
---
* Support fighters penetrate EWAR immunity of supers, titans, FAX's, Dreads
---
* Buff support fighter counts &amp; role bonuses on carriers
---
* Break out more active &amp; role-specific damage controls for anti-capital &amp; anti-subcap focuses so that Dreads (and other caps) can *either* absorb DD's and big volleys better but suffer against smaller weapons, taking critical hits or having nerfed resists
---
* Make subcap guns on anti-capital configured caps land critical hits a lot more
---
* More variety of engagement mechanics around cynos &amp; inhibs, bridges etc
---
A rig enabling NSA or Enabling Triage. With a little bonus added. 250/400 fitting. cannot turn on either module without the correct rig.
---
I’m sure he’s firing up his latest keyboard doctrine as we speak.
---
You're talking about years of complaints from a large portion of the playerbase, even those who have enjoyed using the new mechanics to their advantage. It took years for any change to take place. And the blackout is a baby step. It didn't happen in the matter of weeks or months. The fuck you on? 
---
Null sec is way too safe. 
---
Are you disagreeing with the fact that Eve is now titans online? Do you not see how capitals are killing every other play style? It sounds like you're a Krab living in null sec who enjoys bosoning single frigates just for shots and giggles. Or a null seccers who bought his way into a Titan. 
---
CCP turns up the difficult level from novice to easy and posts like these get made. 
---
Where is that adapt or die attitude from you null big bloc null seccers now?
---
I just came back to the game when hearing about the blackout (something I would've loved years ago!), only to be disgusted by what I read of the state of Null, complete cap fleet dominance, Boson (ew)...  
---
Something like this gives me that "Hell yeah!" feeling and a positive outlook. Meanwhile I just fucked off to Wormhole space because everything is more interesting there.
---
PVPers don't create 137 timers in one hour.
---
The mood I got from the limited devs that I drunkenly talked to at Eve North was generally similar to Falcon. They agree that the game has gotten stale and drastic changes are needed to shake things up.
---
After the fun we've had adapting to the blackout I'm honestly excited to see whatever else comes down the line.
---
dont worry dude, it just buffs stealth bombers. 3-5 stealth bombers should be able to fuck a domi up pretty hard.
---
Yeah exactly, it exacerbates any unbalances that exist and makes them worse; it cannot cause them directly.
---
Battleships can 1v1 frigates, just not effectively. Battleships 1v1ing a frigate arent really in any danger unless you are bad.
---
myrms for truly AFK ratting, ishtars domis and gilas for regular subcap anom ratting + scouts or cynos
---
&gt; maybe that's how it should be
---
No it shouldn't. Fax reps shouldn't do shit for subcaps.
---
Woosh
---
I welcome anyone that says null is too safe to take a ship or fleet into a major null bloc hub and go kill as many ships as possible. When they say "but the blob" my response will be "Oh, you want it to be dangerous for the people you hunt... not for you?"
---
I honestly think every time this topic gets brought up, there is an amazing amount of dancing around the core issue. You started to look at it when you mentioned how the same rules that apply to subcaps don’t work the same way for caps and how capitals do subcap jobs better. However when you really boil it down, all the things that make capitals OP in so many places only really exist because of other capitals and their level of stats.
---
Supers and caps repair too much? Why do they need so many repairs to begin with? Because other caps do so much damage. Why do they do so much damage? Because caps have so much HP. Why do they have so much HP? To survive against heavy damage from other caps and structures. 
---
It’s a circle of reciprocal needs based on the idea that caps need to (for some reason) occupy such a lofty and powerful position. 
---
Imagine you were to just completely remove existing capitals and start the design fresh with just the goal of adding two more tiers or classes of ships. Would they need to have insane amounts of HP, damage, or anything else? No, there’s no reason to give them that kind of strength, since there are no threats (assuming structures follow the same principle of changes) that require that kind of balance in the design. 
---
That’s really what we have now, just a huge gap between capitals/supers and subs. We can nerf their application, make them useless against subs, and generally try to contain them within their own bubble, and we’ll just be isolating the problem rather than addressing it. 
---
They don’t really need to be balanced with so many special rules if they were just treated as a continuation of the existing line of ships rather than an entirely separate realm of play.
---
HTFU. Adapt or STFU.
---
Attack Battlecruisers can't, since they also use large (size 3) guns and thus can not track Frigates (size 1) and Destroyers (size 1.5) well. Back when people flew Armor Hacs they can also sig tanks battleship guns effectively. Capital guns and HAWs in particular break this since they track like a mofo.
---
Ideally thing would work like
---
Hull | Hull Size | Gun size
---
:--|:--|:--|
---
Frig | 1 | 1
---
Destroyer | 1.5 | 1
---
Cruiser | 2 | 2
---
CBC | 2.5 | 2
---
ABC | 2.5 | 3
---
Battleship | 3 | 3
---
Dread | 4 | 4
---
Titan | 5 | 5
---
Gun sizes can't track more than 1 size down, and do negligible damage more than 1 size up.
---
HAWS are a screwup because the "one size down guns" work for missiles, because missiles have extremely bad application to smaller targets due to explosion radius being a set coefficient that is not negated by slow targets. Applying the same logic to turrets is balance breaking.
---
Kil2 is CCP Rise
---
The issue is capital ships are too easy to acquire and once you have access to one, they just replace everything else.
---
Hey, its me, your buyer.  If you send me 150 mil, I'll double it and send it back to you in a day.
---
It introduces friction. 
---
Monkey doesn't target the right thing, monkey doesn't F on the right locked target, monkies don't act in a single tick with to make perfect volleys, so the other sides monkeys can attempt to react. 
---
It's not perfect, and carrier with sentries would have to be balanced well (tracking/range/damage), preferably with their own range of sentry fighters. But overall the capital ecosystem would have improved.
---
This is your brain on TAPI
---
I mean a \*few\* things have changed I guess...
---
Tracking on an attack BC is high enough that if you use tracking fit and 1 ship with remote sebo, you can come close to insta lock and blap with a 1400 fit.
---
Carebears always get so triggered over the fact that players can organize response fleets to make their space more secure. Imagine that.
---
It is Year 3 of The Goberium.
---
Just have all ratting sites spawn a HIC NPC, problem solved! C'mon CCP give it to us!
---
just find them a new role, grid superiority force disparity enhancers in home systems.

[Watch this to learn how space fights are likely to look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvs_f5MwT04)

---
This. It's really the only way to go.
---
I’m calling you a carebar. Go WH or go home
---
Combat in space wouldn't look like anything because all combatants would likely be light minutes/seconds from each other, not a few kilometers. Combat in Eve resembles marine naval combat way more than combat in space.
---
I call BS on this "little guy" argument. What would a big bloc member know about the "little guy"?
---
And he acts as though only the supremely enlightened big blocs have the power to create intel tools, as though no mid-size alliance has one or two people in-house with the experience and will to whip something up on a lazy Sunday.
---
You are not blapping a transversing or tacking destroyer with 1400's unless it's webbed.
---
At zero? No. At 100km? Every time. Can't do that with a BS.
---
Instead of mucking around with sig radius I would much prefer that the absolutely insane cycle time get cut down. If a Fax has 3 reps and they have 15 or 30s cycle times then they can’t keep frigs/cruisers alive indefinitely between cycles. 
---
As it is now, you have 3 reps cycling every 2 seconds. Which along with the silly scan res and ewar immunity means they can swap a target around... 6 times faster than a cruiser?
---
Alternatively implement “HAW” Rreps that could be fit that come with the cycle time reduced, along with the rep amount.
---
I think it’s the cores that the ships use to power themselves. There was a seminar one of the deva did that went into the physics of Eve. This thingy provides power, but has “bubble” around it, and drags on space itself. This is why ships can only go so fast, have drag, and why they bump into each other without actually colliding.
---
It’s an interesting seminar and if Eve’s physics bother you, give it a watch.
---
Its a shame Capitals have to be taken to these fights. Great vid though. Looked fun.
---
&gt; bores you

---
Around 22 minutes he talks about it
---
&gt; Years of complaints from a very vocal minority on Reeeddit.
---
They were only overpowered due to their combined use with capital reps and combat refitting.  
---
With nerfs to capital reps outside of triage, and the removal of combat refitting, the "slowcat" doctrine is not possible.  
---
the only concept was to fit damage and remote armor reps (no triage).  then when your carrier got primaried you would refit to full tank, and receive reps from all the other carriers.    
---
It was so overpowered, fleets would literally tank until downtime, then extract after the server rebooted.
---
Because you don't want the game to have a variety of ships and uses. You want to be able to skill into the biggest ships and shit on everything else. 
---
This is how the game has been since 2003, ships can only effectively deal with a class below them without the support of other ships. 
---
I always think your train of thought is bred from an inability to play this game, unless you have access to overpowered ships that dominate everything else
---
Look fuck stainguy and all that, but you know what's worse than him? 
---
Silence. 
---
So post your mind or downvote, it's not like we can count on the common redditor to do anything more than a bot could manage.
---
Used to be faction warfare, but it is mostly dead these days.
---
I love you Falcon!
---
But I’m really glad you’re not in charge of balance.
---
Wait wait wait... a variety of ships and uses? The top 90 % of the ships used in game are frigate and destroyer. What crack are you smoking?
---
Oh my god that would be awesome. If that became precedent, they could just button all the supercap proliferation away.
---
Yes, even cruises struggle to deal with frigate unless they are fitted for that specific role. 
---
If I was to orbit an omen navy at 500 in a frigate, it would track me for shit unless it was fitted specifically for that purpose
---
In all my years in EVE I have never experienced a single instance of there being a shortage of ships and I’ve lost MANY. Grab another one, carry on.
---
The only time I’ve really been annoyed is when I received a gloating mail from the guy who blew up my boat 5 minutes earlier, insisting how I should be grieving with all the generations of my family that came before me [my exaggeration] because I had just lost an expensive ship. Motherfucker, I’ve lost many ships before this, I’ll lose many ships after this. Don’t think you’re in any way something special.
---
“I blewed up ur spaceshipz!” Dude, whatever.
---
I had a doctrine fit Maelstrom once. Bob have mercy, that 1400mm artillery hit like a motherfucker! Slow to cycle but it ripped that armor off the other boat like a paint stripper on a wall. So very satisfying.
---
It [my Maelstrom] died in 30 seconds or so. Tough cookies. What are you going to do? Get a new boat: carry on.
---
The visceral violence of one ship getting shot to space debris in one alpha strike, goddamn that is so nice to see. If you can’t take that, I hear Minecraft is a lot of fun too [not disparaging Minecraft].
---
You mean at scram and web range? Yea, you'll last a long time.
---
&gt;At least make them warp to a safe and then to a station so there is time to **set up a drag bubble?**
---
Sounds like you have your solution.
---
The first step you already mentioned, join a player corp. Once there you can.   
---
1. Join the scout/recon team - Low skill pilots are perfect for scout/recon because the ships they fly take very little skill points and are still incredibly useful and needed for fleet ops. If you like spy ops recon team is especially useful with null sec black out since we need all the info we can get. 
---
2. Test Server Training and Skirmish - My corp does regular training sessions 3-4 times a week on the test server for new players. Because everything is pretty much free on the test server you can try out lots of ships and playstyles and experienced players will give you test server skill injectors so you can try out ships you might not have the skills for. 
---
3. Exploration - Explo is probably the best money maker for a new player with low skills. You can get in an explo ship after like a day of training and make hundreds of millions of ISK a week. 
---
4. Moon mining - If you want to make some money while just watching netflix on the side join your corps mining fleet. hang out on coms and shoot the shit while you chew rocks and make ISK. 
---
There's lots of stuff to do in EVE even with low skills. My corp is recruiting too if you are interested in learning more. Feel free to message me or shoot me an in-game mail to Dak Nalar.
---
&gt;I'd also couple them with a few fundamental changes to how caps deploy too.  
---
&gt;1 - No more cynos in lowsec. Only coverts. Any cap that moves through lowsec has to use stargates to do so. 2 - Give jump freighters the ability to use covert cynos to move around - this allows them to still jump through lowsec. 3 - Give jump freighters a covops cloak too. 4 - No super caps in lowsec. Titans and supercarriers just wouldn't be able to go there, period. 5 - Restrict titans and supers from using stargates, period. They have to jump, they're too large. 6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate. 7 - I'd also prevent combat capital ships of any type from warping to anomolies too. No more cap/super ratting.
---
\*heavy breathing\* 
---
Do this ... immediately. Make meeting tomorrow. Make it #1 priority for all devs. Ship update next week.
---
Spend some time playing as alpha 
---
And figure out what you like to do for fun.
---
Once you have the game mechanics down you're be ready for Omega.
---
nice the cringe is over
---
the reply was about small gang corps, not small entities, those are hardly the same thing, stick to what you yourself said mate.
---
now lets see
---
The only entity in all of those brs you could argue is smallgang 
---
1:i dont see any small gang corp there(*maybe* rote?), and with 5 init titans on the km and snuff support i don't really think the faxes were the thing that saved the fight there, especially with the amount of subcap losses on your side still.
---
2:again no small gang corps on the br.
---
3: jspace brawl, irrelevant, neither of those entities are small gang corps either.
---
4: this is if anything an example of why not to drop faxes if you're much smaller than the enemy, I cant even understand what happened there to make the fax worth dropping, maybe its incomplete i dunno. 
---
5:again jspace brawl, the nag was caught ratting and that was what he had in the bearhole it seems,and neither of those entities are small gang entities.
---
tldr: 2/5 of your brs are in jspace, them being irrelevant to the discussion should be pretty obvious, and hardly any small gang corp in relevant numbers in any of the brs.
---
100% just use mint
---
I'm not sure that they want to create T2 capitals.
---
However if you built an EHP nerf into the modules themselves that could functionally accomplish the same thing.
---
Please remind me what trash omen navy fit has a scram and web?
---
Oh yeah maybe only one that is dedicated to killing frigs
---
I think it's interesting that nobody complains about people injecting into subcaps.
---
The point is that with injectors we can't have endgame ships that are flat out better than everything else. But that's what capitals are designed to be.
---
I mean, you were the one cherry picking a single ship to prove your point when you could have said "Any frigate can orbit at 500m and win vs. all of those cruisers with RLML or web/scram or neuts/drones" but you didn't.
---
PVPers can be responded to in any number of ways. Drifters just spawn and dunk you with no way to react short of dropping supers on them.
---
That's people goofing around because they are disposible and cheap. When push comes to shove everyone runs to supers and titans.
---
Please point me to independent sov holding "little guys" that plan to actually colonize, upgrade, and use that space, Mister Dunk.
---
Oh, ok. I thought all of the Stuka fleets, Goku fleets, AF comp fleets, bomber's bar fleets, and vast majority of nano gang frigate/destroyer fleets were a thing. Guess those are all one offs. Heh, ok.
---
We just went from "null-sec is the safest place to be in all of eve, even safer than high sec" to "null-sec is a little dangerous again" and you are already asking them to switch it back? 
---
Getting rid of the Dotlan heatmap would make hunting incredibly time consuming and difficult to the point that many people probably would stop doing it. Keep in mind the vast majority of Null sec space is empty and the heat map is the only way you can tell what direction you should even head in. It is very hard to convince a fleet of players to jump 30 jumps to go on a roam already, would be even harder when you don't even know if there is going to be anyone there when you get there.
---
But true nonetheless.
---
You're getting downvotes because you made a mind-bogglingly stupid post. You don't seem to understand any of the arguments for or against drifters and just parroting the carebear line about null doesn't want to be attacked. It's a total strawman; nobody is mad about being attacked, they're mad because the drifters were implemented in a way that actually stagnates nullsec even further. You can't have PvP wars when everyone is forced to stay at home and babysit structures from AI that doesn't follow the same rules that player ships do.
---
&gt;disappeared into a ccp ticket
---
&gt;shouldve reclaimed it
---
Attitudes like this is why Eve is going downhill.
---
You fucked it up, deal with it.
---
1. Conifers are a small entity
---
2. Both did he say jump and Pos Party are a small entity
---
3. Small entity choosing to take triage over logi to maximize dps
---
4. see one
---
5. see 3
---
Be pedantic if you want. You're right chessur isn't dropping triage support on his nano gang. Corps of sub 30 players are choosing to use triage over a logi wing. This is the same point that's been made down this comment chain. I could keep linking you similar BR's where sub 30 active member corps are using triage over a logi wing but at this point you're going to focus on the word "gang" to win your point.
---
Biggest weapon in the game is the one that controls engagements, who gets to run and who can make it to the fight.  Really would be cool to give Titans a power interdiction role that holds down a grid and commits them to the fight, like a stack of poker chips rather than a card.
---
It's a feedback loop. They only ever bring bombers because they know you drop supers on everything anyway, so they optimize for quick ganks and then fuck off. 
---
Everyone is acting in their own interest here. The only way to change it is to change the game mechanics that lead to this behavior. That's the job of a *game designer*, if there are any of those left at CCP.
---
I mean you guys could literally make it a feature of once a week/month an employee says what they would change to a certain area. Could be an easy way to gauge community support for ideas.
---
I know.  Hence asking if he quit.  I could have asked if CCP Rise quit, but I like former pseudonym better.
---
Post lossmail
---
Ah right got you. So that means the minnie drones do always flat out have the best tracking, if e.g. all faction drones were attacking the same target? Or does orbit speed very between empires drones?
---
Wait, sorry for jumping in here... The data site gives something else other than the 'open' cargo? I'm literally brand new to exploring... Well all of EVE to be honest.  
---
I was exploring a data site and used my data analysis tool, then hacked it by trial and error and got some data pod things... Was that all I should have gotten? Sorry I'm not at my PC to check the items actual names.
---
I’d be only rly against the JF thing because sticking up for the few JF killers that track those wont get to see the cov cynos heading towards them on the cyno map. Why not go the full content way of either making null groups utilize WHs and haulers to get small parts to manufacture in their space or having to escort a freighter full of ship parts through lowsec? Imagine seeing a mid sized alliance webbing their t1 freighter with a fortizar in it through lowsec so they could set up shop in null for the first time and having to first fight through a few gatecamps with only subcap fleets engaging (assuming ur ideas were implemented).
---
It's pretty easy with no local. When there was local, it was one of the proposals to prevent auto tethering.
---
No local is another solution to that.
---
I'm not sure we really need both. :)
---
unless its changed, relic sites you just open and data sites spew out items. if you were able to just open it like any other can, they must have changed it.
---
All of those are "dicking around" fleets for third partying and shit. When you look at fleets that show up to timers on defender/attacker, it's the biggest shit they can find. You get laughed at if you show up to your own timers primarily in Goku/Stukas/T3D.
---
&gt; "Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."
---
This is not what the OP is about, and in context of MMORPGs this statement is only true for themeparks which are entirely focused on instanced content with fixed, small amount of players.
---
This is in my option the best way to do it.  As long as you are smart and realize you still have to learn the game.  But buying a few plex so you have isk and don't have to grind is definitely not a bad thing.
---
Games are supposed to be fun, and if you'd rather drop $20 than grind for 20 hours...makes sense to me.
---
I wager local will be back in some form. I'd like to get rid of tether and add combat timers while the asking is good.
---
Heh, balancing for WH life *amirite?!*

CCP\_Falcon
---
I wish it went back to battleships online! I had someone of my most fun brawls in mega thrones in lowsec!
---
I very much support these ideas, and they should have happened with the space aids changes!
---
&gt;It only takes 20-30 torp bombers to kill a rorqual, how many can a cerb kill before the rorqual dies?
---
If the rorq has a tank and PANIC I'd say all of them, easily.
---
Hopefully go back to slaved battleships and enable fun low sec brawls?
---
Ahh yes RLML, the medium weapon that fires frigate sized ammunition designed specificall for killing frigates.
---
HML and Assault missiles apply trash to frigates, unless they are webbed down massively or target painted. You know fitting decisions that have been made to deal specifically with smaller targets.
---
So the most commonly used ships in the game need more reasons to use them because they are for "dicking around"? Got it.
---
Imagine quitting EVE because you did the dumbest thing imaginable and then crying that the mechanic that got you killed shouldn't be possible. Pretty much exactly what I expected from a highsec incursion runner lmao. Buy a permit next time.
---
I chuckled at the covops jump freighter, but otherwise a good post
---
No, caveat emptor, someone fat fingered and you benefited. You can send ISK back if you're feeling nice but there is no obligation to.
---
Sorry, but there’s no way to verify your compiled .exe isn’t malicious so I had to remove your post. If you want to post the source and let people review/build it yourself that could work.
---
Idk man, it sounds like Reddit is the home of the one and only opinion on anything and if you disagree you're:
---
1. disgusting nasty krab
---
2. a member of a big NS alliance
---
3. spodbrain
---
4. capital pilot
---
5. bot
---
6. WHer btw
---
7. a member of goons
---
8. Someone who lives in HS
---
9. someone who is unsubbing 30+ alt accounts
---
10. someone who is coming back to the game with 30+ alt accounts
---
11. the only person who can save EVE
---
Let's back it up and look from 30,000 feet up where you don't feel compelled to prove me wrong. 9 times out of 10 if a frigate tries to orbit a cruiser at 500m, you really think the frigate will win?
---
small gang is a specific type of activity, that is pretty well accepted for years, if you want to rebrand something widely accepted feel free mate, just don't expect others to agree with your mislabelled points.
---
CCP Hilmar - "it is with my greatest regrets that Falcon has decided to retire to live under a mango tree as of right now."

Ah, shoot. I didn't think of that.
---
I'd be more than happy to post the code itself once I get back to my PC. Would you suggest posting a .jar to let people with Java development kits check it themselves, or just putting the actual text somewhere?
---
Guessing you're flying a Venture. Are you getting killed by players or NPCs?
---
* If it's NPCs, then you can fit your ship to resist the type of damage they do. Each NPC group uses a different type.
---
* If it's players, Warp Stabilizers will make you a *lot* harder to kill.
---
Isn't CCP a bunch of semi-random departments that barely communicate and actually *compete* with one another?
---
Falcon can say whatever he wants because no one cares and he's just a community manager anyway. His word is not binding in any way, is basically just personal opinion of a guy, and it helps him in his "bro" role.
---
And ironically, two and a half regions just got glassed a few weeks ago which did indeed force a coalition to move.
---
No drifters needed for that to happen.
---
What changes?
---
SOMEONE HIRE THIS MAN.... wait.....just make his ideas reality please.
---
I dunno, what about if you are a filthy solo or small gang pilot? I mean... stop being anti-social and make some damn friends! The only reason you want to measure your solo stats is because you are stuck in a console game mind set and you still need mommy to put your report card on the fridge. Sheesh!

Get above 200dps

There already are crits in eve. They're bad.

Roll into MCAV with 10 actual players, maybe 20 total characters.  MCAV undocks enough Gilas to blot out the sun.  MCAV wonders why no one will take those fights.  SMH.
---
No mate, the north won that. They said so. They moved because they were indeed house shopping and had found a new place to live and it had nothing to do with that old nasty place getting torn down.
---
and we would love to see that too
---
Uh, okay? I mean i have nothing to compare it to, i literally outfitted a heron and went a-probing in the highsec system I was in. My first ever cosmic signature thing.   
---
I'll keep trying i guess and see what happens. Cheers!
---
lmfao ok
---
&gt; Anyone else bothered by this?
---
&gt; (anything in the text field)
---
/r/eve: yes
---
&gt; hand, that
---
Your targets will disappear is what will happen.
---
Fit blasters instead of railguns, and trainup t2 guns if possible
---
How?
---
Just my two pennies, as a supporter of all these changes - bar completely losing fighters from Carriers, I just really like the idea of Combats.   
---
Could this be a chance for tech variations in the capital classes, with tech 2s being able to field fighters for example, or picking an NSA or Triage module sets the configuration or fitting slots/launch tubes/options you have.   
---
Maybe the NSA could consume fuel, and shrink the tank if fitted (like a MWD on the capacitor), so a combat carriers window on grid is limited and full power risky, ie. window to leave: between cap recharging and fuel going below jump needs. Another balance option could be if fighter wings are out, or its NSA on, Carriers are immobile, like dreads...oh oh, and it's just DPS fighters, no scramming nonsense, definitely delete those.  
---
Would love to see tech 2 caps with some of these OP incumbent roles/abilities as specialisations in the future, that cost lots of risk/ money/ skills to use. And make amazing KMs...after 24hrs delay.   
---
Anyhoo, cheers for this post, reassuring.
---
&gt; Because im dropping a 5bil capital ship loot pinyata 
---
You act like 5b is a lot and that somehow warrants it being dumb. But ok. Lets go with your logic then.
---
If i warp my 5b golem in, it should 1 shot FAX and carriers. Cause, it costs the same or more. Thats all that matters is cost, right?
---
The moment you mention cost as a means of balancing, you've already lost the discussion. Stop being dumb.
---
Train skills, use bigger guns, use faction ammo
---
I suggest that you read the third sentence again and attempt to understand, it has nothing to do with the massive amounts of easy ISK he makes, but everything to do with losing out.   I know reading and comprehension is hard, but please try to keep up.
---
Yes, as long as it's not a cruiser who's standard fit is as an anti-frig platform, such as a caracal/osprey navy or drone boat.
---
And definitely if you go further up the food chain, I'd happily engage most BC's/BS because you can get under their guns. cCP game design has always been I'm favour of wolf packs of smaller ships being able to hold their own againstmuuch larger vessels
---
That does not make it less true, and by the way, the war dec changes the former CSM (filled with people representing big blocs) was all about protecting the little guy and improving new player experience.
---
seems to to little on armor repair needs a bit of a boost there and we are good
---
Download [pyfa](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases), import your character, fit your Cormorant so it does at least 200 dps. Light ion blasters maybe.
---
the thing that sets EvE Apart is the time investment a player puts into getting into the capital ship he's after, it's literally years of time spent training toward a specific goal, get into capital ship, train modules then have fun with it, people avoid training other ships to narrow their field even further to get into the cap they want faster with very few excess skills, so if CCP then take that capital they have spent years to get into and change it into something totally different, all that time investment is just shat on.
---
No you cant
---
It's not all cut and dry, Vespas have way better optimal and often one shot small targets as they close in on them where berserkers take multiple volleys.
---
Also berserkers sometimes seem to "outtrack" themselves. Best example of this would be in in dark Abyss filaments. The Vespas slower speed becomes an advantage.
---
So there is quite a bit of situational back and forth going on.
---
oh geez , it’s gonna be hard to kill the easy pve target oh no.
---
Adapt or die.
---
&gt; I want a Cambion
---
&gt; (it) will sit in station (...) until the day eve actually dies
---
nice
---
you don't deserve the other hulls either
---
&gt; Sorry to disagree with the orthodoxy here, but more half-baked ideas from people who aren't able to see a long future vision aren't what the game needs.
---
i agree, and this is why we shouldn't really count on ccp's devs in general)
---
the way it used to work was a bunch of objects would literally spew out in every direction, and you had to rapidly click on them as quickly as you could before they dissapeared. If you're not doing that for data sites, then that machanic is gone. Hopefully that's the case cause the old way of doing it was mega aids.
---
Just Falcon posted some personal thoughts on capital ships after drinking too much whiskey
---
Don't worry, your precious nyx hasn't been nerfed further, yet
---
The pvp-ers didn't think that far ahead so you shouldn't expect such a change.
---
*looks at local in null*
---
Didn't see you complain when they made supercaps dockable. 
---
\#makesupercapsnotdockableagain
---
why not do something like ban all caps from entering faction warfare space so it turns into your subcap battle field? you could also do something like any lowsec constellation connecting to a highsec constellation, supers and titans can't enter. or just say f\*\*k that and completely ban supers and titans from lowsec. they cant be built there anyway, so why can they enter that space?
---
Spoken like a true risk adverse kitey fight aligned out with a cloak pvper. I almost forgot about you guys. Almost.
---
No titans in lowsec? How to bridge?
---
I can understand that viewpoint. It does become comical, however.. when that same wolf pack of players is now in battleships or dreads and it's called a blob.
---
the fact that you even asked that question means you have no idea wtf you are talking about.
---
For a start, use the meta variants rather than T1, as they're strictly superior
---
This is a 11/10 goodpost. Can't really disagree with anything here.
---
Capitals should have a role, but they shouldn't be the answer to every problem, and it should be possible to get under their guns or escape their tackle range, just as it normally is when fighting larger ships. Dreads are relatively well balanced, but carriers, supercarriers and titans are not.
---
In addition to this, capitals are far too mobile. If you want to get a battleship 10 jumps, it'll take you a while, and there's a benefit to smaller, faster ships. With a capital, it will take you 10 seconds to jump - and not only to get into system, but placed exactly on grid in a tactically correct location. Cynos need some disadvantages because at the moment they are also an 'I win' button.
---
And yes FAXes are absurd. I don't know if it needs to go back onto the same hull as carriers, but they at the very least need a huge nerf. Nerfing their self rep would help, but only if they only bring 1 (otherwise one FAX can rep the other with its remote rep).
---
I think your bot's broken.
---
To the operator, you realize wrecking shots favour those kiting gangs, making them more random to attempt to tackle, right?
---
some new rupture builds i have been working on they are working pretty good will be uploaded soon.  
---
what do you guys think of the thumbnail art o7
---
Changing reps so that the size of the rep, s,m,l,xl only repairs optimally against the same size or larger vessel would maybe help, not totally dissimilar from gun mechanics and large weapons not tracking small targets well.
---
If you do this I can just extract 4 accounts and unsub them because titans are worthless as are supers, and in turn so are rorquals. Carriers with sentries was shitty back in the day and would be again. Agreed haw weapons need to go though. 
---
Why don't you just kill supers and titans, remove damage caps, nerf carriers, and get rid of haws. Then we can all fly eagles and the n+1 will absolutely dominate the game....sigh
---
Easy fix for you. .. get rid of fax's and halve all cap ships ehp. Boom.... now your cap fleets are dying and if you want to go balls deep in hac's or bs's you can.
---
Um yes please to fucking all of this. It would make me love the game so much more than just the people I play it with.
---
::popcorn::
---
Cool thumbnail. Haven't had much success with the ol' Hyde Rupture in lowsec lately. I just keep getting them ganked by people who have nothing better to do than rageform t3cs for a single t1 cruiser when they already have enough guys in space to kill me.
---
CCP really needs to put someone who understands Eve in a position to make some design calls. The Eve you talk about in this thread, and the blackout ones, would be a far more fun and exciting game than the carebear Farmville we've seen it turn into in the last 2 years.
---
You're right, the word gang had no place in that line. Small corps, sub 30 man corps are choosing to take a FAX over a logi wing.  For any small corp using triage and taking the rest of the potential logi and sticking them into DPS is a better use of their available resources.
---
You may not like what I'm saying, but do disagree that these changes do no seriously hurt the large groups in null sec?
---
Yeah if it's bombers you're absolutely fucked, unless it's your own fax alt you undock soon as you see them on grid, you're going home via pod express.
---
&gt; Because im dropping a 5bil capital ship loot pinyata because im bored and fearless. Nullsec is inherently a game of capital ships. You roamed into my sovrign space looking for a fair fight, and you only brought 5 subcaps, and expect to hold a grid against me?
---
Yeah, that really makes you sound fearless m8 ;)
---
join a big null block, roam into faction war lowsec, leave null for FW forever once you understand whats going on. 
---
gets you people on comms for advice and safe(r) spots to stage from
---
No, not yet. The long term plan to keep the game going definitely involves making them less effective as a solitary anti-subcap force, though.
---
My recommendation is to check the full source into Github or BitBucket or some repo of your choice.
---
so it's just coincidence that all you have to do is put your structures out of alliance to avoid wardecs altogether?  :ok_hand:
---
So why both gathering resources when you don’t need much to make battleships and clearly you hate capitals. What would be the point of fielding a 2-3 bil isk ship that can’t make money, can’t defend itself well and, from your suggestions, can’t call in help either. If I have to risk my 10-13 bil rorqual to make 100 mil an hour, then I should get a fighting chance to defend myself or get help. I don’t use my lovely Paladin anymore because no point in risking 2 bil to make the same amount as a VNI. The risk needs to be worth the reward. I don’t use hulks anymore because no point when a covetor at 1/10 the cost does just fine.
---
This happened to me in providence, I was purposely undercutting red marketeers in all the stations they were in selling t2 shield invulnerability at 25x market value I sold them at 2x market value but every once in a while I would get a 1b module sale to some poor guy and I would have to go talk to their ceo about watching what they did on the market....
---
&gt; what you think about automated moon mining ?
---
No, if you want to make money off resources then put in the effort to collect them. All passive moon income did was funnel large amounts of risk free ISK to the owners of the space.
---
What we do want is for moon mining to be able to generate content, and that means an athanor (at least one with a moon mining drill fitted) shouldn't get structure weapons or ewar. If you want to control that grid you should have to bring combat ships.
---
I agree all of this is a way of skill expression in EVE. Can we assume - for the purpose of this discussion - that by "skill" I mean general "ability of a person to avoid making punishable mistakes and/or to punish mistakes made by others in order to gain an advantage"? Because this should be general enough to put virtually everything that depends on a player's ability to learn how the game works and how to play while staying relatively independent of factors like SP or wealth. Note this also includes various meta skills such like ability to analyze battle reports, knowing current geopolitics of EVE, understanding fleetcomp/doctrine meta and how others handle all of those - this is also skill, just not something most players get to deal with directly (it's usually handled by alliance command in nullblocs).
---
The issue with fleet use of capitals/supercapitals is that they're relatively low skill activities in that regard - chance of making noticeable mistake by a single player is relatively low, said mistakes have usually low impact and during all that time it's generally possible for FC team to keep an eye on members and alert them to correct whatever small mistakes they make. Outside huge mishaps that could go unnoticed and be exploited by other side (like not telling anyone you bumped off the gate, jumping to wrong cyno, sieging/triaging/activating NSA by accident or at wrong time) you will generally be fine by following FC commands and there is enough time for FC to repeat every command several times and make sure everybody follows what's happening.
---
While on that, most of the ways to exploit mistakes made by others when using caps is put on FC team coordinating, planning and executing whatever strategy they're going for, with overall low involvement from fleet members outside occasional cyno/scout alts (which isn't that different from doing fleet support tasks for subcap fleets), which again reduces the relevance of average linemember ability to affect the outcome of a fight/campaign/war (either positively or negatively). Capital fights are for majority of players involved most of the time just participation trophy - you were there, you did what you were told to do, nothing more, congratulations on being part of capital engagement. And I think this is more of an issue than potential raw power of capitals - they aren't as much *too strong when used well* as *too easy to use well enough*.
---
Compare that to "hard to fly in" subcap fleets that often can quite effectively deal with fighter spam (Stukas are prime example of that) which require multiple members to be on point with everything they do - be it broadcasting, staying tightly anchored, booshing; and any small mistake made by said fleetmembers have immediate and sometimes huge impact on overall results of entire fleet (just think of the chaos if someone booshed half of the fleet or single mistimed/misaligned damage bomb). I'm using doctrine fleet as an example here on purpose to provide example as parallel as possible - whatever smallgang/roaming scenarios are vastly different in many more factors.
---
A Wolfpack to me is 5 - 20. Blobs are a whole new level and also depends on what they're fighting. 50 Vs 50? Fair fight.  50  Vs 5? blob.
---
Right. So getting intel should only be incredibly time consuming and difficult for PVE players. That sounds reasonable...
---
Love the art!!
---
I know you are being sarcastic... but yes that is reasonable.
---
This is the correct answer.  I was primarily a market trader who never actually learned how to fly.  I wanted to pvp, had many billions, so bought some stupidly blingy fits.  One time I lost an 800mil hound in my first ever wormhole trip.  Why did I lose it? Because I was messing with probes ON THE WORMHOLE and didn’t notice I was uncloaked.  AND thinking I could save my also stupidly blingy pod, warped away without bookmarking the hole.  This is what happens when have money before you learn the fundamentals.  
---
For what it’s worth, I mostly fly t1 and faction frigs in low sec now.  Expensive ships aren’t fun to lose, and lose you will if you don’t know how to fly.
---
At least those 9 players would be having a good time though.
---
Hmm. I'll consider it, but considering how niche of a program it is (literally the only people for whom it would be useful are those who have access to two different region categories of nullsec because of how terrible my ore calculations are) I'm probably just going to ditch it. I attempted using it myself, but I don't even have Bistot in my local space.
---
Thanks for the advice, though. If I ever manage to figure out a way to get it working well for any region I'll probably put it up on Github.
---
I was in this situation something like 2 months ago, I will give you the advice I got and worked: the best ship is friendship! 
---
There are always a couple of players in the system for the same mission. Ask them to team up, and blow this criminal scum!
---
 Important: Dagan is instanced for each player, so the first one need to warp in, and then joined by the other via the fleet window and warp to the location of the player. It will also count only the player who owns this instance, so you need to do it for each player.
---
Reeeeeee little guys reeeeeee
---
There was, and never will be the difference between big bloc or small guys in nullsec
---
Only the hunters, and the hunted
---
To be fair, the last killmail with a Cambion involved was in 2018, so not much of a change
---
&gt; The thing with carriers... Doesn't having fighters with multiple roles make sense?
---
Yes, but it's a game, the design should encourage fun interactions. Does it makes sense that a battleship doesn't fit any frigate size point defence mechanisms? No, but the ability to out-track a battleship makes combat interesting. The same applies to carriers.
---
Well, it's point of view based. If 5 to 20 wpfl pack AF come in and someone drops 20 Orthus/Caracals on them or anything bigger- people grr blob
---
Did you even play back before caps? Battleships were never be all end all. Not even close.
---
&gt; Yeah, for sure battleships need some love to be honest.
---
The problem with battleships is that they can be easily deleted by frigates (bombers).  We stopped fielding BS fleets because of bombers, and even BC were susceptible, but at least not as painfully slow.
---
I don't disagree that BS need some love though.
---
I feel like he's doing a Ryan Reynolds and leaking Deadpool clips hoping the fans get all revved up and demand the project gets greenlit.
---
&gt; I do still want carriers to have fighters or at least the anti fighter fighters as a counter to super carriers
---
The roles in that area should be, imo
---
- Dreads - anti-structure and anti-cap at close range
---
- Supers with heavy fighters - anti-cap at fighter range
---
- Carriers with light fighters - anti-heavy-fighter (and possibly anti-battleship)
---
So NSA should only apply to locking fighters (not ships), and light fighters should have their application nerfed into the ground, but given a bonus to application against fighters.
---
You can always come in minmatar/amarr region. Not being in FW but there is a shit tons of small ships to fight around here. If you want a buddy to fly with, just come and hangout in "Mackies Pub" and i'll be pleased to bring you around for a spin.
---
-Kaai
---
&gt;  we could not break the reps of the apostle against a shield drake with no shield. Drake armor is only like 4.8k.
---
&gt; seeing how a non-armor ship was getting armor rep'd and ignoring our damage.
---
im pretty sure he would notice if the reps were on the shield buffer and not armor
---
Also implants.
---
mobile tractor unit? I've never used one for abyssals, do you just drop it in the middle? will it grab everything?
---
Sums up the design and purpose of the Rupture quite well honestly. A tanky brick with a nascar engine strapped on and all the dakka.
---
The point of carriers no longer having 15 drones was to save the server from dieing.  Now you have fighter groups to have less entities flying about.
---
Being in a blob of RR carriers, changing resistance or damage on the fly based on what was shooting you, was the funnest shit.  Yes it was hilariously OP when you get to a certain tipping point.   I love the idea of Dreads becoming the main DPS again.  Sitting in one spot shitting out damage.
---
My point is that Blackout is not bringing the desired changes. You may not like my suggestions, that's fine.  I'm not a game designer.
---
Do you think Blackout will bring any long term change to the power structure in null sec?
---
We are currently at the point where BPC titans become the next thing everyone has
---
Im very torn on this subject. There is no doubt that the number of players needed to fight caps in subs is way off but at the same time these fights are a real challenge, what is eve without such challenges?  I have been on some brilliant Stuka fleets deleting roqs, carriers, dreads and a fucking legion of fighters. People have adapted to the current meta, i dont believe for a second that null is too safe when stukas and heavy stukas exist. Successfully defending against such fleets is not easy especially when you only have one cycle of panic to form. Sure you can save the roq but at what cost?
---
Dont forget to give t1 frigates 10mil ehp and do 2k+ dps
---
&gt; 1 - No more cynos in lowsec. Only coverts. Any cap that moves through lowsec has to use stargates to do so.
---
Had me up to there.  Moving between corps should mean having to sell all your stuff first.
---
I have no doubt many groups can create alternate intel systems, large &amp; small.  
---
My point is that the intel will be available regardless of changes to local &amp; killmails.  If so, why invest a lot of effort in it.
---
&gt; Because im dropping a 5bil capital ship
---
that's the cost of my pod alone mate, raw price is irrelevant.
---
Unintentional scamming is the best.
---
I dont think people grasp what this would do to the game, try to picture invading delve or querious using only nullsec entrances for your super fleet or bridging titan.  
---
Imagine one day imperium decides we don't like delve and move to fountain. Now imagine trying to get fleets into delve just to bash the uncontested keepstars. You'd have to go all the way through test space, or fountain, with a bridging titan/super fleet to do it.
---
Needs more dakka though
---
Like... something can beat 10 frigates? GASP! How dare!
---
agreed
---
Train Cloaking and High Speed Maneuvering to III and you can do the [cloak trick](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick) with a T1 exploration ship. This makes it survivable (mostly) for trips to null for exploration. Getting 1 load of exploration loot to Jita will pay for many, many failed attempts. Be paying attention to your surroundings, use wormholes to travel, and most attempts won't fail.
---
Yup.
---
Triglavian ships are OP but not anywhere near as much as FAX
---
&gt; I wish they would give a cov ops cloak to Blops though.
---
Makes more sense for covert freighters.
---
That's CCP logic for ya.
---
Wasn't there an "npc" cyno in one of the older eve trailers?
---
&gt;It makes me wonder if, even if this isn't what's slated, it aligns in the general direction of some changes CCP has planned.
---
We can only hope changes like these happen ( - the insane jf buff).
---
People say ccp never guaranteed anything, but holy hell do hunters cry rivers if they don’t get changes to make their desired ships better and stronger.
---
Two way street.  Cancer cloaking and grief playstyle is ONLY countered by cancer umbrella
---
Yes, it's the wrong game for you. The meta is toxic as fuck. Hell, there's even a meta to the meta with the level of seriousness players take this game.
---
&gt; You realize that FAUX had at about 35% capacitor after its jump?
---
fc what is cap booster
---
CCP even blamed player retention based off of shit mechanics from war decs, FYI that's why they fixed them. Some mechanics have to be revisited and modified to ensure this game stays streamlined enough.
---
\&gt;Leave capital's alone, balance them sure, but don't fundamentally change how they operate or the role they play now.
---
A couple years too late for that...
---
\&gt;from provibloc  
---
\&gt;mad about caps/supercaps  
---
:pikachu face:
---
Wait. Let me get this straight.
---
You flew an incursion vindi through a known ganking system like Uedama without removing its bling, refitting it for travel/tank, and getting an alt to move the bling in a different ship?
---
And then you were "surprised" you got ganked?
---
If we are reverting cap warfare back to 2012 can we also bring back the old Chimera model?
---
Oy, don't you talk about the staple gun that way
---
Special needs.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/STmpF98](https://imgur.com/a/STmpF98)
---
Just like they did with ECM. OH WAIT...  
---
If ships are too strong, they get nerfed. Timeframe may be different.
---
Hey. At least I am honest.
---
I know how you feel. The first thing I wanted when I started Eve was an Abaddon.
---
2012 skins to match?
---
Seems pretty dumb in hindsight. Not playing for years makes you forget about the little things
---
Or they could just farm them themselves.
---
Hell ya, No one in the game should be able to just hid away and engage under their terms. Increase mass limits. Make rolling holes harder. Make WH life more dangerous as well.
---
I am all for the change in local. It was overpowered anyway
---
Oh noes, people who live in their space and spent all the time and effort setting them up can move around quickly. Fuck off, like anyone can have what we do if they put in the goddamn effort
---
I dont use my nyx anyway
---
Because hunter's ideas of "fun" is to use small fast ships that take no fights beyond killing defenseless pve-types, which ALLOWS groups to sit titans on gates because they know hunters are far too big of pussies to even try to escalate.  Dont hate the symptom, hate the cause
---
Which ship other then rorq got invulnnerability?
---
Dreads were made to shoot and tank pos’ not 2 volley a Loki running a 100mn ab.
---
I mean, that's not a trivial task if all they want is to buy a couple of ships and modules in Jita.
---
In this thread, people rage at reality.
---
same
---
When I think of Rupture ...
---
https://i.imgur.com/6ARvBi7.jpg
---
For a big ship to be able to defend itself at short range? You do have to aim it and it’s easy to miss
---
&gt; I don't think your assumption is right, big groups are not defined by having more capitals than smaller ones (thus being more sensible to capital nerfs), big groups just have more of everything. Right now throwing caps on everything is the meta, so they throw more caps than you can handle with a small group, but if you nerf capitals they will adapt to the new meta and still throw more than you in the new meta.
---
But there are counters to subcap compositions, so although you won't win a strategic engagement against a bigger blob, you can still force tactical victories. For example a battleship fleet can be bombed, logi can be ECMd or disrupted with booshes or damped against target switches.
---
Would smash.
---
ma man
---
DO IT, delete FAX. Terrible balance aside do it for the rule of cool, they are a sad kinda ugly instead of the strange, lovable kind of ugly that eve ships really are. Seriously choose any of them and spin one for a while.  They have been ruining screenshots of the game for years.
---
Do this twice, with warps between different pairs of celestials, then warp to one of you midwarp spots, then warp to the other midwarp, dropping a bookmark partway, and you make a *real* safespot, not on a warpline between any two celestials. Bonus if you can make the final bookmark be off-dscan from any celestial.
---
Go to Tama.
---
CCP HIRE THIS MAN.......wait.....
---
&gt; Frigates are good against 100% of the ships in the game, just need to bring more than 1.
---
That second clause is a huge difference from carriers. And the first isn't even true, frigates will get melted by RLML cruisers or neuting battleships even with quite a big numbers advantage.
---
Or why they bounce off each other?
---
Void bombs neut rorquals out in seconds and then the rorqual has NO tank. Have you ever flown a rorqual? The repper takes massive amount of cap each cycle. Also during panic, the bombers usually cloak up and wait to see if help arrives. Those cerbs can’t do anything while they wait and then the rorqual gets almost alphaed once it leaves panic.
---
The majority of people who complain about any proposed changes to capital vessels are members of a large null bloc that uses them to grind structures and boson roaming gangs. Prove me wrong. 
---
I also didn't say that the big block fighting meta is a bad play style. Build your castle. Just don't build it to the detriment of all other play styles. 
---
That's all I mean. The amount of capitals in game now and the way that they get used prevents a lot of play styles from doing any real damage or even resulting in a gud fight.
---
Her face is already smashed.
---
Thank you CCP for having a capital focus group develop the current meta.
---
Injectors make it worse - and CCPls change them to be accelerators, you'll still get a lot of people buying them but it won't result in day 1 Rorq pilots - but the problem would still be there, people would just be skilling alts into the OP ships the old fashioned way.
---
Yeah, if there's anyone notorious for lobbying CCP to change the game to suit them, it's Suitonia and Jin'taan.  Industrial blocs have been getting the shaft for so long.  Miners rise up!
---
Caps don't need to be 'useless', just situational, like every other ship in the game.
---
Can't kill what you can't find. If you fly around for hours and don't run into anyone you start to think the game is empty and why play a MMO that is empty? Whole thing turns into a self fulfilling prophecy and the game will become empty as people stop playing.
---
Drifters set nullsec on fire, wormholes are screaming louder then nullsec brains despite having smaller numbers, and high sec jita undock is still where the elite go to PvP. (Also Tama is now the only low sec system worth going to.)
---
Lmfao jesus christ you fucking nerd
---
Show me one BR with an MCAV Gila fleet.
---
Phoebe was November 2014 btw.
---
&gt; 5 minutes is way too long
---
Is it? Why? How long does it take to gate a battleship the 5 jumps that the cyno replaces?
---
Your golem can also move and warp out if it needs to.
---
We'd reeee for longer than it'd take to find the ratters? Seems odd.
---
So like targeting sub modules on a ship like a gun turret? That way sub caps could at least knock out a portion of the cap's systems before they get blapped and feel like they did something? Defanging it.
---
[UniWiki says Dagan reps 100DPS](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Blood-Stained_Stars/Chapter_7_-_Closing_In#Mission_50_-_Our_Man_Dagan), so, do &gt; 100DPS. Or, as has been suggested, find a friend.
---
IIRC the last time I did this I used a blaster Catalyst, which I left parked at Tar for the next time I want to do it. If you go the blaster-fit destroyer route, you probably want to avoid diving straight at him before you get in range. [Here's how](http://www.evealtruist.com/2011/12/video-tracking-and-spiralling.html). Again IIRC once I was in antimatter range with blasters he wasn't really applying damage to me so I could just orbit him and tear him down.
---
sounds like the life of a solo roamer o7 xD happens to us all
---
thanks much appreciated &lt;3
---
My orca can bust 500k pretty readily tho
---
I like a lot of it but get away from my fighters 
---
... am I the only one that loves redesigned carriers?
---
&gt; almost every fit has something that increases it's damage/application.
---
key word:fit. Allowing fighters to fill that role makes it so that there is no tradeoff in modules, keeps the range of said application bonus practically grid wide due to fighter range and speed, and also can be hot swapped mid fight. They're free to sacrifice a midslot for a painter if desired, that's what haw dreads have to do with their application modules and it works fine.
---
Slowcats were a miserable and oppressive Apex force that rightfully got nerfed. They were horrible gameplay all around. It won’t improve Eve to bring them back. 
---
If they were brought back, then all Capitals and Supercapitals need a Siege or Triage module in order to be at all effective.
---
And by disappear you mean "bounce safes instead of stations/structures" for subcaps and "warp to structures anyway" for carriers/supers because they take longer than a minute to get there anyway.
---
Would just become a stupid tax on subcaps warping direct to stations.
---
Exactly, I fucked up, I’d rather take the hit than bother ccp over trivial issues of my own doing.
---
This is the best way to go about it.
---
Ships are not weapons, they are bullets.
---
Buy a crap ton of cheap Frigates and engage everything under the sun.
---
I agree with most of these changes with the exception of the jump freighter suggestions. I'd like the act of moving assets over long distances to be substantially more dangerous than it is now. There ought to be a way for players to interrupt supply chains, including ganking jump freighters.
---
Yeah. It's a ship I really haven't had fun with - honestly there's very few things that don't instawarp that I've been able to have fun with lately. Where the fuck do I go where one battlecruiser doesn't get 30 supers dropped on it?
---
dreads would still be able to gate, right?
---
I’m sure the roaming gang will have an easy time killing 2-3 remote-repair chained Carriers working together.
---
Htfu comes to mind as well
---
Those fvcking Eve players, such sociopaths.
---
A FAX in a wormhole completely kills a fight and requires the other side to bring one too, if they don't have a huge numbers advantage.
---
The point of that mission is to fleet up with someone to take him down, as he's so much stronger than all npcs before it. (And you're probably a good few days away from skilling up to kill him yourself)
---
Ask in local if someone can help you out - usually someone is around.
---
Have fun!
---
That’s why you have the amateur who loves eve talk with the developers and work out an answer that is more fully baked
---
Here, take my gold!
---
Pipe bombing aka smart bombing battle ships aka U R Dumb
---
premium reference.
---
&gt; FAX gives a smaller group the ability to try and do big things with small numbers when not sitting under an enemy supercapital umbrella
---
Except the big group can also bring FAX
---
amarr min fw zone or the far eastern side of caldari gall zone best for solo roaming,
---
So a proper 1v1 then.
---
You are going to hold onto the notion of drag bubbles working on nullified ships aren't you?
---
And which of the big groups represented on the former CSM has actually done that? None of course because there are big downsides related to sov warfare in doing so.
---
the back of the rupture looks a lot like an old pirate ship
---
don't orbit it hurts your tracking
---
Ur thinking of TDBIN
---
&gt; We'd also have fleets like proteuses and lokis whose sole purpose was to provide tackle against hostile fleets
---
So what you're saying is that you'd have to put pilots and ships on field that the subcaps in the enemy fleet could actually engage?
---
There's a lot to be said for parking all those T1 frigs you're gonna burn in lowsec. Find a FW system where there's some contesting happening and just go sit in novice complexes. Orbit the beacon (the one that's just called "beacon" on the overview, not the one with the name of the site) within scram range and wait for somebody to show up. Optionally, have dscan up and set to 1AU range 360 azimuth and leave if somebody shows up in a Garmur or other asshole solopwnmobile.
---
You're orbiting the beacon because that's where your visitors will land. When you see somebody on 1AU scan, start holding down the ctrl key and be ready to lock them as soon as they appear. Get point, orbit them at optimal, and open fire. Eventually you too will have a solo killmail.
---
Or just apply the sig penalty on cap sized modules
---
But what I say is true that's why you're so upset.  It would stagnate it at all.  If you basically cant be araed defending shit because someone actual comes and shoots at you whose better then you shoulsbt be in null.  Null is dangerous remember. Whats stupid is you think you can sit on your arse all day and do nothing.  Basically you shit yourself that someone might knockdown your sandcastles and went crying to CCP. Hilarious
---
I see your reading comprehension is non-existent. We aren't talking about warping right now (or ever really). We're talking about cost, which you brought up as a point of contention. If cost was actually the only balancing method, then my Golem (which costs the same as your FAX/Carrier/Dread) would be massively more powerful than the current stats are. It should be able to easily stand toe-to-toe with any normal capital because "its expensive" and should be able to nearly solo a FAX with its dps.
---
Cost is only 1 factor of balancing in the game and its not the most important one.
---
#CollateralDamace :knife:
---
True, but in the case of nsa's you can just not unless you need the extended range,. And while I said dds I guess I was thinking more of the Titan as a whole, the DD plus the gun mounts
---
&gt; It only takes 20-30 torp bombers to kill a rorqual, how many can a cerb kill before the rorqual dies?
---
A bomber has so little tank I think a cerb can probably volley them in 2 or 3 shots. So if you can bring 3 cerbs you can delete the 20 man bomber fleet in a single RLML reload.
---
This is quality b8.
---
F the skill grind. Injectors are there for a reason. Selling plex for isk is there for a reason. PVE is boring as shit. Blowing up other's people shit is not boring. Get over the fear of losing your pixels early, It will lead to so much more of an enjoyable game.
---
Game balance shouldn't rely on your sunk cost fallacy.
---
&gt; I assume you're not going to just delete every ship I own if my wallet reaches 0 right?
---
The ship could run up a repair debt that you'd have to pay before undocking it.
---
I don't think this is a good way to balance though, big groups have so much ISK that in the short term cost can't be a balance factor.
---
Dude... move on man. It's just a game.
---
Why you just trim the bad away 🙂
---
No they where asked to vote for him, in Brave we do not tell people what to do.
---
Hey I love flying my rattle in missions, and only missions. Shame as I absolutely love the battleship line in eve
---
While WiNGSPAN specializes in torpedo delivery, we do deliver all sorts of high-grade munitions across New Eden. Although Bomb deliveries are somewhat rare due to the tricky nature of landing one in the cargo bay without any guidance systems, it can be done. Any delivery agent that has done so receives a commendation.
---
Back in my day we had sentry done carriers and we liked it. 
---
We'd actually do C5/6 wormhole escalations with RR Carriers and Sentry's + a web Loki or two. Blap through them sites real quick. Make a shitload of isk. Go blow it on A and B type T3's. 
---
Those were the days...
---
\#GetOffMyLawn
---
Thanks!  
---
Regarding (1), is it crucial that I have a cloak of some kind or can I get away without it?  Will people warp off/hide immediately after seeing me on the scanner?
---
No it's fine, that's how CCP makes money, and how it's possible for other players to subscribe for free.
---
Don't forget skills, though, both Eve ones and your own experience. Just having ISK doesn't help if you don't know what to do with it.
---
Anti freighter tackling police?  Is that a thing?!  It sounds amazing!
---
This is... not the right place.
---
Or the right way to start a corp. Go make friends first.
---
You have no idea how much work the IT groups of large alliances put in. It's definitely not something that would just take an afternoon.
---
Test might be able spin up a killboard in a weekend but we have a group of it already working on projects like this. Smaller groups would have no infrastructure behind them already.
---
I'm 99% this is well planned market research/customer satisfaction survey by CCP, just like "kicking the anthills" comment or whatever the term was that Hillmar used at EDU. I for one welcome this world of subcaps Falcon talks about, would def make me more active in NE.
---
They cloak up during panic. Tell me how many can be killed when they are cloaked
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
They cloak up when the rorqual is in panic. How many ships can the rorqual and cerbs kill that are cloaked? 0 so they just wait for panic and burn through the ship before they can be killed.
---
[deleted]

No u, fuck off retard
---
I would bet shitting on your company product publicly is against company policy unless changes to that product are coming, and it's more "admitting defects and showing willingness for improvement" rather than "community manager shitting on devs" kinda thing.
---
Okay, put those FAX in range of the anti-cap fortizar we're defending, and see how it goes.
---
Or, try and shove those FAX into my wormhole.
---
Personally, I think it's something I said a few weeks ago about the blackout.  
---
I suspect that when the company was courting suitors that they didn't want to upset the apple cart.  The goal was to have somewhat consistent, positive quarters and avoid any risks to that.
---
Now that they are unchained from a positive quarterly requirements (Hilmar and co. got theirs) they can expend some energy on what's been lurking in their minds.
---
If the ideas make it better, \o/ for all of us, if they don't, prepare to be BP'ed.
---
Fingers crossed.
---
Typical goon tbh
---
Orbit speed and orbit range does vary between empire drones (Minmatar+Gallente orbit slightly closer, Amarr+Caldari orbit slightly farther) (Minmatar&gt;Amarr&gt;Caldari&gt;Gallente for orbit speed), but Minmatar drones do always have the best tracking and will always have the highest odds of hitting a smaller target, at the price of having the lowest raw damage output. 
---
Caldari drones are often a good choice as a happy medium between #2 for damage, acceptable tracking especially with the longer range, not being slow as mud, and being some of the most durable drones (especially because most of their EHP is in shields, making it easier to pull them in before they sustain real damage.)
---
Note: This logic does not apply to Sentry Drones, which go in order of Garde&gt;Curator&gt;Bouncer&gt;Warden for Damage+Tracking&gt;Range.
---
Revenant and thanny
---
If they arent useless, they will be massed until they win. They would likely still be bricks.
---
Hmm. I'll have to swing there. Last couple times I roamed amarr I got dropped on. I mean fuck, I got blops dropped on a RIFTER last time lol
---
Do you not realise that plex wouldn't be 2B if it wasn't for carrier and super ratting bringing in so much isk?
---
The more isk that is printed into the economy, the more expensive things get
---
Tbf to Falcon, the initial design and convention presentation *did* allow for that. It was changed during the dev cycle leading up to release, but it's really easy to not miss that sort of change if you aren't actively in the Super/Titan playstyle. Falcon is not a dev, and he's very aware of his limitations.
---
----
---
Note: I realize you're replying to a bozo who thinks Falcon is a dev, but I felt it worth adding anyway.

eve small gang player complains about caps because he ignores all of low sec, all of the border nullsec that rings highsec and is desperate to only roam in the deepest areas where big groups live and have cap umbrella's and then come and whine about caps ruining their game, its like a guy gives you a free pizza but tells you , you can eat any bit of it, but that slice with the chicken is all mine, like 95% of pizza/space is yours, that one little bit with chicken is mine....... eve small gang player table flips screaming oh my god this is terrible I cant eat fkn pizza ..
---
LOL that's a terrible analogy fml.
---
This clarifies so many things. Thank you!
---
This really should be noted on the GitHub.
---
so we shouldn't listen to the man with good ideas? fascinating.
---
Wasn't the drone swarm of carriers a huge toll on the servers? I understood it as the main reason to rework the fighter system to a few squads.
---
Great and after all those changes the only thing you'll ever need to worry about ever again is how many retards you can cram into a system in shitty insured t1 battlecruisers or t1 bs.
---
Pray tell, you want to drop caps on some goons out of your C4/6?
---
I don't know what you're going on about but as a leader of a small alliance I'm having a lot of luck with the changes. Even poising to take sov.
---
It really feels like we've gone back to the era where smaller alliances can brawl over zones again. Renting was honestly the dumbest shit to ever be come up with in this game and I really, really hope more mechanics are put in place to gut it.
---
&gt;I think it's interesting that nobody complains about people injecting into subcaps.
---
It is of course known that injectors are bad for the game, but the best we can hope for at this point is probably to restrict them to subcaps.
---
&gt;But that's what capitals are designed to be. 
---
More like they never bothered to check if they were broken, so they are what they are.
---
We had them in my day. I was at B-R and there for most of the halloween war. Unless you were in a capital there was fuck all you could do about mass fleets of RR sentry carriers.
---
Jump frieghter with covops! Hell yeah.
---
That would make armor reps so much worse than shield reps, though.      
---
Currently there are still tradeoffs, we don't want a one-choice meta imo.
---
My impression in WHs is that a FAX is the most common cap to shove through a hole (or seed) at the top end. Are you not much better off with a FAX than a dread?
---
Interrogative:
---
1. You want to remove FAXes. Okay;
---
2. You want to remove fighters from carriers, return them to a role supporting 'dreads?'
---
   1. So, if you remove fighters, and give them back the triage module, how are they different than the FAXes you want to delete? I don't like this idea, but wouldn't just make more sense to delete carriers instead?
---
   2. If they do not have fighters, how are they carriers?
---
   3. It used to be you cannot remote rep dreads in siege. Now you can, with an 80% reduction in efficiency;
---
      1. Ergo, you want to completely remove all capital DPS except for dreads, and re-purpose the carrier hulls to be faxes that support ships with huge reductions in remote rep efficiency when they use the thing that makes them good, and you want to delete the ships that require racial carrier skills to fly, but don't use fighters and use the triage module?
---
Is anyone else seeing this as odd?
---
My comment indicates that falcon had ccp's ear. I'm hoping it happens.
---
Wait, what was Kil2 known for, as a player?
---
&gt;My point is that the intel will be available regardless of changes to local &amp; killmails.
---
A lot of things can be done. Of course CCP cant just make everything available in an automated fashion.
---
In a C5/6 yeah, but you can't have caps in all other areas of space (outside of, again, home defense). There are plenty of corps in all other wormholes.
---
Most people will warp if they see something on d-scan, yes.
---
don't go to closest ones (tama,etc.) as those spots are a little too hot. look at map and sort it with (people in space in the last 30min) I use that a lot to find systems that are active without being a suicide mission. Placid was a nice region for my low sec pvp last time I did some
---
Nah, sadly you didnt get it at all.
---
Is this pornhub? If not, then this should definitely be on pornhub.
---
oh. well. here's hoping then.
---
Written by someone who sounds like they have no idea what they're talking about
---
It must be doing something because the tears are enormous!
---
That is what the Scorpion is (although with the problematic state ECM is in, its usefulness in that role is limited); this proposal extends the Scorpion concept to create a battleship for each of the other races that also has a bonus to that race's EWar.
---
In a way, the Golem also fits into this idea, with its TP bonus. (And there are some groups who have exploited the Golem for this purpose in fleet fights.)
---
This is the best answer. 
---
I've found myself on both sides of this problem and just popping a question in local generally yields good results.  
---
And you might make a new buddy :)
---
I said drag bubbles and smart bombing battle ships. Stop being fucking retarded on the internet.
---
They’re not very good...
---
I remember thinking the same - the disappointment upon entering my first Plex..
---
You know capitals could not take gates a few years back so there weren't something like "roaming capital", ja?
---
[Triglavians](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/compilation-the-lore-of-the-triglavian-collective/123465)
---
no, the tornado is an attack battlecruiser which is basically a very flimsy, battlecruiser sized support for large weapons whereas the tempest is a full fledged battleship.   
---
if you want to damage a stationary target then yea, they're similar in dps - but the tempest has two utility high slots (which are usually neuts), higher base stats, fitting and a large number of fitting slots.
---
My .02 here.  Sirens give control only, webs give some control and application, but paints only give application so carriers would lose their primary abilities to control the grid they are on if these changes were made.
---
Your grammar needs a balance pass
---
Didn't they nerf drone assignment to address this? Isn't there a 50-drone cap on it now? So, in the proposed mechanic, 3 carriers could have their drones assigned to deliver DPS equivalent to 6 or so BS.
---
The problem with slowcats IIRC was that they were used to assign like 2500 sentries to a single volley.
---
Yawn
---
And the entire statement is moot because I was referencing nullified ships. Stop being dense and pretending I'm arguing what you are arguing. Fucks sake.
---
&gt;Things like this is relatively common, especially if you're new.
---
So you're saying I'm not special? B-b-b-but Momma said....
---
Me and the boys killed a Praxis last week using 4 Retributions and a Stiletto. Stiletto (1 ship) held the tackle, Retributions shot it down, and while the Praxis was able to sledgehammer Neutralize us at times, it could neither hold us on grid nor effectively deal damage to us with its battleship-sized 800mm Autocannons.
---
Literally none of the listed problems apply to Frigate vs Battleship warfare.
---
Right? Goddamn Eve players, ruining Eve.
---
And he's enjoying himself, making tons of isk, and not rage quitting like a little bitch too.
---
Again, show me where he gets salty "losing" the loot from one gank.  He's killed trillions ands scooped most of that loot.  Post some chat screenshots of his salt, or go away - you're making an ass of yourself. 
---
Let me guess - you're an elite highsec "anti-ganker" acting like you make a difference?
---
I would love these changes
---
you not seen the youtube video of suitonia takling a carrier solo and then proceeding to defang it while the carrier couldnt do shit to stop him ?
---
there are extreme cases for any situation.
---
Ok, definitely gonna try that once I get to it. Unfortunately, life's pretty busy currently, but I will definitely try that when I get to it. Thanks for the advice!
---
Hell yeah. I'm totally down with that!
---
This is reddit, not a court of law.  I decline your request.
---
Oi, don't get short with me.
---
He did not mention what happens to remote reps without triage on the carriers.      
---
He also didn't say "reroll to point x back in time", so i'd assume remote reps stay how they are now in his scenario. 
---
That would not allow slow cats to happen again.
---
It's possible.  These trash tier blobfest wormhole scum all look the same to me.
---
My biggest gripe is while those warp animations look cool, moving huge parts of the ships mass around is probably not really efficient
---
*BEGONE, CAP*
---
Hey thanks for the feedback. We don't have a ton of experience on grinding up the ranks of a nullsec FC heirarchy so it's difficult to really get into it with just the two of us. It is definitely a problem and ive heard from others who mirror what you say. Sad state :(
---
You don’t need resources to not worry about a loss.
---
You just need to let go of fear. Like you do with that big huge morning dump.
---
Yeah and I can put 5 bil of modules in a rifter, not to mention implants. The golem could probably solo your 5 man gang too. Cost isn't the justification for balance, but the mechanics of how a ship is supposed to operate are. 
---
A fax is forced to sit in one place and not receive reps for 5 minutes. That's what makes it a loot pinyata. As a tradeoff it can push out more raw Hp/s than a small gang could ever hope to kill. It is specifically a "I win" button, that can be abused until you decide to hit it with a counter. 
---
You're complaining about getting upshipped. If it wasn't FAX you would complain about getting outnumbered because they would have dropped a bunch of logi instead. I really don't know what you're expecting. If you don't want to deal with cynos, go to wormholes
---

He made PVP commentary videos where he explained what he was doing, why his ships were fit the way they were, target selection and a bunch of other good stuff.
---
AAR: found rag boson ratting. Moved some caps then blopsed some blackhacs on him.
---
Sounds like my kinda jam
---
4 and 5 would really limit the ability of supercaps to actually go anywhere
---
Ok, thanks for the advice, will keep that in mind.
---
Nothing wrong if you are buying from CCP. Everyone says not to because EvE the game (not CCP the company) has a tendency to punish credit card warriors. Many get upset a quit when they realize thousands of dollars are not an "I win button" because there are dudes out there with trillions of isk. You don't have the cash to compete. Basically, people are trying to save you from yourself.
---
kinda fucks armor comps cause shield extenders and rigs bump sig up
---
"Hurting" the big blocs is a good thing.  Null is too safe, people are too comfy, and something needed to upset that meta.  Blackout fits the bill.
---
roam around in something not to fight get some intel also when entering new areas in eve best to take a day or 2 and see who and what is around and going on :)
---
Stacking penalties on reps are a thing now. We just haven't seen any fight yet where this has been relevant... Because everyone is too pussy to throw down, because they know they will lose something more valuable than the structure. 
---
The net worth of a capital brawl fight where that many fax are actually used... The losses for either side will be more than even the keepstar is worth. Thus the defender will always make the call to just cede the fight to the bigger fleet and just cut their losses.
---
The title is a bit bait.
---
But you bring up some valid points overall. I would however say, it's not hunters that don't adapt it's the griefers. The people who want to shit on other peoples days. As someone who has known plenty of those types - they aren't the type that gained their supercapitals from farming things up or being good at the market, or anything like that. Frequently they would plex things up or perform a corp heist - maybe rat in a C5 using a dreadnought for a few days a month. They just wanted a fast track to being able to stand atop the people who don't know how to best defend themselves, and as people learned to fight back against their overwhelming force and frequently even win you saw those groups die down and fade out, maybe folding into CODE or joining a lowsec hunting group since it largely is the only thing that reflects their playstyle now.
---
The reason you see groups like PL and Ranger Regiment settling down and starting to krab is because they are adapting to catch up. Goons aren't that far ahead, they just got there first and are capitalizing while they can. And frankly I think Sotiyos were a horrible idea - now you can produce an unlimited amount of supers in parallel in one system where you were limited by POS mechanics beforehand to maybe 2-3 a system and they would take anywhere between 3-9 months to construct even a handful. The speed of replacement is the biggest issue we face right now, IMO. And the only way to fix that would be to strangle the amount of capitals and supercapitals that can be produced per facility per system, region, or constellation.
---
Imagine playing for the better part of a decade and a half and still not knowing anything about the game
---
Yeah, I really need to dedicate some time to learn combat probing. I've done data/relic scanning and such, I assume the basics are the same?
---
Not to mention how vulnerable a supercapital shipyard was inside a POS and how easily defended a Sotiyo is with its tether now...
---
Yeah, big fan being being a sneaky McSneakerson, all Sam Fischer up in this. Modern day dumpster diver lol.

The OP was talking about cloaky warping ships with cynos and cepters. You can kill cloaky ships with drag bubbles and cans for decloak. And you can pipe bomb interceptors. So your dumb fuck comment was not required.

---
&gt;Fix cyno and/or anticyno mechanics to prevent capitals being the fastest response force one can muster to project to a desired grid in a region
---
There was a thought that came up several months ago, inspired by the Triglavian spoolup mechanics: Make Cynos (and Jump Bridges spool up). Such that when a Cyno is first lit, it can be locked on to by a Jump Bridge, but that only a finite \[maximum ship mass/number of ships/total ship mass; choose one\] can jump in on that one Cyno cycle. On the next Cyno cycle, increase that limit. Such that if one Cyno remains lit for several minutes (several cycles), you can start throwing capital ships in to it, but before that point you're limited to varying subcapital groups.
---
Damn it, last video 6 years ago? I'm getting old...

Eve doesn't need someone with code development expertise right now.  What it needs is someone with a vision for what the game should be, and alone among CCP's, you seem to have that.  That person can direct the development.  Small, random changes can be nice to have, but don't move the game as a whole to a better state.
---
You are a chipper and pleasant fellow. /s

How many times are you going to reply to my comment?  I don't care about MCAV or TDSIN.  I'm just screwing around.  But thanks for identifying yourself as an idiot.  I appreciated the laugh.
---
I don’t think there’s a deliberate political aspect that people drive one opinion opposed to another. It kinda flows into a meta of team A hating on team B. 
---
From there it becomes more of scrutinizing everything the other team does within the game.
---
[Example](https://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/201/)
---
I agree it does not impact them enough, for that to happen things like what Jintaan suggested would also need to also happen.  I don't think the blackout isn't a step in the right direction, it was just the first and more need to happen.
---
This would only work if they can't dock/tether right away since you need to have your drag bubble up **before** they get into warp for it to have the intended effect.
---
I agree with all of this..... except all capitals (supers especially) should have a massive REDUCTION in EHP.
---
You'd have to up warp speeds for battleships, but that's something they should've done years ago.  Making different ships warp at different speeds was a good idea, but they took it way too far and made using anything bigger than a cruiser too much of a pain in lowsec.
---
I wouldn't say this is the worst idea, experienced pilots will just keep bouncing from safe to safe and not dock though. Wait out their PVE timer and safe log if you're trying to combat probe them.
---
Don't have to use the same sig values on both kinds of reps.
---
love your step into wh space....and jeddraider....he still promised me a podcast :)
---
&gt;A fax is forced to sit in one place and not receive reps for 5 minutes
---
What even is Bastion? Same thing (albeit at 1min intervals). A marauder can also get 1-2 shot by XL dread or supers. If anything is a "loot pinata", a Marauder is way more of a pinata than a FAX. 
---
 Golem hull by itself is 1.8-2b before any mods. Apostle's are \~1b. So you trying to flip this about modules being expensive on a hull to make it expensive is pretty hypocritcal. Since you're the one originally stating you have a 5b FAX. When its already 800-1b cheaper than a marauder hull. No one is forcing you to put 4b in mods on your FAX. Even if we make everything T2 (except rigs), the marauder is still more expensive due to base hull cost.
---
We get upshipped every time we roam, we're used to it and counter it when needed. We still won that fight, but only because they warped in more ships which split reps on the FAX and allowed us to kill everything due to pilot error. That doesn't change the fact that FAX are dumb and have no business repping subcaps.
---
If you want to rep subcaps, bring subcap logi. Capitals being the best option for everything is what has caused the game to be such a stagnant mess.
---
It isn’t really the ability to move around quickly. But being able to do it without fatigue and being unable to stop being from jumping through when pointed etc is a bit unbalanced. There is no trade off.
---
I have never upvoted anything with so hard upvote as to this. &lt;3
---
The irony of people complaining about the Goons supercap supremacy is not lost on me.  I remember quite a few PL types loudly proclaiming that money should be the counter to numbers.  
---
However, I'm absolutely in favor of balancing Eve in a rock/paper/scissors/lizard/spock sort of manner.

No worries. Yeah, attitude among the big blocs is a very large part of the problem.

One last thing. In no way shape or form should a dread be able to track a cruiser or below. Dreads hitting interceptors is so fucking stupid.

Killing a Praxis with a few frigates is ***far*** from an extreme combat scenario. Unless 'extreme' is defined as anything requiring more effort than Approach F1.

Also some links, implants and boosters change sig. Really just doesn't seem like a good idea.

Same effect. Tracking Speed Disruption scripts also suffer the same issue. I probably should have clarified that part.

I love this. You undock. Thats what you got. None of rhat refit burned out hardners and switching roles mid fight.
---
But ultimately if the demand for Titan/super pilots pilots is there, even without skill injectors the pilots would be available in the bazar. Sure the supply might initially lag behind demand, but this is eve.  As soon as some one realized there was profit to be made, they'd start character farms.  You maybe stave off the rapid gain of pilots for a year or two while the farms get up and running, but they'd come on the market all the same.
---
If you don't like injectors, that's fine, but even if we got rid of them I just don't think it would solve the problem except very, very temporarily.
---
Or just make Falcon CEO !?!
---
I feel like we have partly come to this point of having no one ship that is special is because ccp has stopped what would effectively be an arms race in terms of R&amp;D. A analogy of this would be Russia and the USA during the Cold War. They were constantly trying to one up each other in weapon systems. In eve we basically stopped at titans and ccp is wholly focusing on static defenses. Without any next great super weapon e.g a super titan or some such the large eve blocs are going to reach a point where they just keep mass producing the same large capital fleets. There has been nothing ship R&amp;D wise that has forced the largest blocs to change their output of titans and caps. Other than that I think titans should be truly much more difficult to produce then they are now. Imagine Star Wars if there were 100s of Death Stars floating around. Anyways good write up.
---
Hey that’s awesome thanks for the info!
---
Is there something repugnant about the idea of needing to bring a lot of ewar to be useful against a capital ship?
---
Or is your post a case of 'Oh no! Change is scary, and I don't want to adapt!'
---
I mean. Yes. If the quality of the posters here are anything like the normal eve player.
---
But to answer your question. No. Eve is a video game run by a company. You can exchange money for goods or services from the company. 
---
State-run lottos are a literal tax. Most of the money collected goes directly into the states general fund. The math is designed in a way so that the state always wins that bet.
---
Thanks for the reply

Who do i need to speak to? Tell me their name. Is it kurger?

If you know enough to use ISK well, then there's no need to grind if you can afford to buy with rl cash.
---
Its after all the reason tens of thousands of us have monthly subs instead of grinding for plex.

Going that one step further and or taking advantage of sales etc. is smart - and helps the game - rather have someone creatively generating content than burning out on the grind and quilting.

Can't get the exact fit right now, but

highs 3x light neutron blasters
---
mids 1x MSE, 1x scram, 1x web, 1x AB
---
lows 1x DC, 1x magstab, 1x micro-auxiliary power core

rigs to taste. I like an EM shield resist, and I think you can get 2 hybrid rigs on there also. Maybe a core defense field extender if you want more hitpoints.

*rummages around on zkill looking for non-shitfit Merlin*
---
[This guy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77972028/) was doing it right, except I think you should be able to fit meta neutron blasters. 
---
I ran through a half-dozen variants of this fit before getting to a version like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77972114/) but you need a bunch of skills at V in order to fit it. On closer inspection I see that he was was using *both* the MAPC II and a small ACR II, which I recommend against. If you need two fitting assists for the same resource to get the guns to fit you probably ought to meta down.
---
As for where to do it, somebody said Tama and that's a good call. It's [4 jumps from Jita](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/route/Jita:Tama), though you shouldn't be basing out of there. Move your stuff and your clone to where you're going to fight, and live there.
---
I mean, she's not wrong
---
A rorq has a 200km lock range, can't it yellow box some of them?
---
Also your complaint here is really '30 dudes can kill 1 dude in a big ship' and that doesn't really seem like a problem to me. And if that's a problem then perhaps put a defence fleet on grid or in system with important economic assets.
---
The Muninn even has hinged gunports. It's definitely by design.
---
Ccp released npc fleets that took down a few structures and cause people to come home to defend. They also blacked out local so you can see people in the members list in NS atm.
---
Who said state run?
---
I believe Remote Assistance (ReSeBo's, etc) is stacking penalized too. If CCP were to go down this path, then they'd be basically making the same code changes.
---
Someone honest plays eve. What a world we live in......

Can't *ever* have enough dakka

There's literally no point ever where there could ever be a circumstance where someone could look around and say "Yep. This is enough dakka." and not be legally shot for being a fool.

Don't be absurd. They need 20k DPS, and ECM immunity &lt;/s&gt;

Eh, fighters, HAWs and bosons apply just fine to a Prote... and guess how the caps will be fitted if you're using subcap logi. :p

It's really easy to keep eyes on a single constellation, especially if it's locked in.

I don’t know about conspiracy, but as someone else said it would be extremely weird for a community manager to rile up the player base with changes that won’t happen. It kind of seems that either it is some kind of test, or Falcon knows something else and DGAF anymore.

\[The wording if your title is a bit ambiguous; based on the title it's very easy to think what you're asking is "should I spend ISK to purchase PLEX?" rather than what you really meant, "should I purchase PLEX and sell it for ISK?"\]
---
The one big concern with 'credit card tanking' as some people call it is that money can't buy the game knowledge or player experience to fly a ship. However, based on the wording of your later line ("jump right into doing the fun stuff **with my corp**") that seems like it's not going to be too much of a problem for you because you're not planning on buying a ton of ISK and spending it on nonsense, you're thinking of buying some ISK and spending it to fly with your friends. And if you're doing that, you can learn how to fly the ships you're in, without worrying as much about replacing them when you inevitably lose them. \[Note: This is not a comment insulting your skill, this is a comment on the absolute inevitability of dying in a flaming ball of glory because this is EVE.\]
---
What's generally laughed at is buying PLEX, selling it for ISK, and buying a 5bil Golem and dying immediately. What's generally not laughed at is putting a few hundred PLEX into one or two billion ISK and flying out in an endless supply of 30-300mil cruisers with your friends.
---
This is the correct attitude.

Doesn't matter if it doesn't change the power structure if it enables people to have fun in space they don't own.

Ah fair play if we can just redefine things then let’s say eve is run by the council and 100% of the takings just go to fund local property development.
---
More roaming, more gate-camping, and more activities have been happening in the regions outside the mega-blocs.
---
hah thats great
---
Dude. Take my money.
---
The question isn’t whether Blackout hurts large blocs, but whether it makes for a better game. It does make for a riskier game for everyone. It adds an element of danger for everyone. It adds a dark sense of eerie foreboding for everyone. It makes everyone less comfortable than before.
---
When it comes to making Eve a more comfortable space, the larger blocs will be better equipped to do that. They have the IT support. They have more potential eyes, ears, and spies. Their network is much larger. That doesn’t make Blackout bad. 
---
The Blackout changes only affect Nullsec space. People in Nullsec will adapt... or go back to high sec, or low security space, or quit. That’s independent of whether this hurts big blocs.
---
Blackout will make it harder for poorly skilled players to survive in Nullsec. That’s fine. That affects everyone. That doesn’t make Blackout bad.
---
Every time that people have screamed for changes to break up the big blocs, the result has been to raise the barrier to entry. Blackout will be no different. Less well-organized groups will suffer more from this environmental change than better organized ones. That’s fine. That doesn’t make Blackout bad.
---
Eve is supposed to be a harsh environment where the disorganized and weak do not survive. There’s a reason that there are lots of dead alliances in Eve. If Blackout weeds out some more deadwood, that’s good.
---
yeah it works the same way, first you have to do a scan to get the initial sig, then further scans narrow it down to hull class then the exact hull then a warpin, but you can do it on grid for extra shenanigans, or if you know d-scan find them with d-scan then only use a single cycle of probes to get a warpin. Using d-scan this way is a good habit because it will help you when hunting and people may not run from a heron on d-scan but they will probably run from combat probes.
---
Yes you can.
---
Even after that change Slowcats were still a thing.
---
All of the Rupture variants have this. It's completely hilarious to me especially on the Rupture because the guns retract in and the plates slap down, but there's nothing actually protecting the guns when they're retracted other than the bits of completely open scaffolding holding the outer doors on.
---
What did I redefine? Why are you trying to be a dick?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_jackpot_records
---
Those are the largest lottery winners in the US and Europe. Every one of them is a state-run lotto. When most people talk about buy a scratch off or throwing $2 into a lottery. The state run lottos are what they are talking about.
---
If you are talking about playing a 50/50 at a fundraiser. Or using omaze to purchase entries into a game of chance. Those are different. Fundraisers and state-run lotteries are just not the same thing.
---
&gt; Cruiser sized ships that blow up caps and battleship/ABC hulls that blow up supers would force a sort of fleet diversity if the ability to apply two sizes down was strictly enforced, and thus give a role to other ships to fight those ships.
---
...don't stop. I've almost finished.
---
))
---
You redefined lottery.
---
Go fight goons and test out the stacking penalty then. Clearly no one in eve thinks its even remotely good enough to justify trying to drop a large fleet of supers/titans without having more supers and titans.
---
no.  cause then offensive modules like target painters BUFF the enemy letting them recieve more reps.  which hurts missiles.
---
and this would make MWD super buff reps.   which would make speed tanking unbearable as even if you web them down, they'd keep MWD on and recieve more reps.
---
so no.
---
i can't believe people are still boson ratting
---
No. No I didn't.
---
&gt; industrial indexes need some tweaking
---
Well, I can agree on that, as I alone can push a system into the unprofitable region.  That just shouldn't be possible.
---
Note that an Azbel can build capitals, but they cannot dock in it, so they should still have tether.
---
Upwell industry also needs fewer rigs to battle excessive structure anchoring and promote consolidation, and less expensive Upwell rigs (any corp that can afford to rig an Azbel would be better-off with a no-rig Sotiyo), especially the insanity of T2 rigs.
---
The fact that this bothers you means Eve isn't the game for you. Have fun with Harry-mon Go!
---
Yes. Yes you did.
---
Used to be an ok rp scene. Some of the OG Caldari peeps really got into the political aspect of things. It got dominated by emo neckbeard SJW's years ago. Hopefully it's better now.
---
Skill injectors are fine. They allow new players to get up to speed in eve without waiting years. When ever I hear people whine about skill injectors the only thing I think is "we just don't want other people to fly these op ships" 
---
All they did in this case is better highlight the problem of how oppressive and over powered supers and titans are to the eve meta by accelerating it.
---
Never understood why costs aren't pegged to inflation.
---
In the real world, wages go up, goods/services go up (mostly). In Eve, wages (ability to make isk) goes up, everything stays the goddamn same (blueprint materials for ships? same as they used to be).
---
Ok. That's fine. Go look up "lottery" and tell me how I redefined it.
---
Then tell me how the definition of lottery applies to eve as a business.
---
Ah okay, will keep that in mind when I start practicing.
---
and vastly more expensive.  If they're running SOE arc as a newbie advising them to fit it out with guns worth more than ships hull is questionable.
---
Camelot, from your own link, is not state run it is a private company. Same with most of the eu.
---
I think injected skill books are included.
---
Only reason I have for alts with no assets to be worth billions.

So. That's fine.

I hope you have a nice day and find someone else to nitpick.

They don't do anything, but they're pretty unique collector's items. CCP removed mines fifteen or so years ago, so they have no practical use.

Yea nitpicking because words and facts matter.

I'm looking to make some isk by fighting triglavian invasions, and i have 2 accounts to dualbox. How would I go about setting it up with 2 Domnixes? How would i fit it?

---
Ask in local/corp for some help. If you really can't find someone close, pm me.

Oh, and ignore snarky comments by some 1337 pve'rs telling you to get gud or some unhelpful variation...
---
Subs should be able to kill fax in 40-50man fleets. Otherwise too much content throughout eve is just ended the moment a fax lands on grid.  
---
I would say the rest is all negotiable but I have seen way too many possible good fights end with a fax landing effectively eliminating any reason to stay on grid. 
---
We are not all in test/goons/pan fam and can form 100 stuka bombers for our fun and don't try justifying that as the minimum requirement to going into enemy space.
---
And yet. You are ignoring them. Makes you think.
---
Oh neat, so if I show up with a small brawling battleship gang nobody is going to boson it on a gate?
---
If you're going to talk about cause and effect you should probably consider that people fly fast kitey shit because everything else dies immediately to someone's capital alt.
---
You keep thinking that. But in the end remember ignorance isn’t an excuse for you.
---
Wanting to wantonly kill off stuff that is part of people’s playstyle is bad for the game. Doing so specifically because a handful of people are whining about changes to make their life easier is worse.
---
No matter what the playstyles are or who the players are.
---
I'm not claiming ignorance. I'm claiming you have no ability to form an argument other than attempting to nitpick.
---
Why shouldnt capitals be able to warp to anoms?
---
first: capital rats are a thing.  how would we deal with true sansha super carriers in our ore belts?
---
Second: It means any subcap fleet would be perfectly safe from capitals in an anom.  Seems exploitable. 
---
Third: It makes late game money making PVE go from... multiboxing rorqs, to well. multiboxing rorqs even harder... But for the person with one or two accounts, the balance was High APM high income ratting with your titan or super, or low apm low income with a rorqual.  
---
And no.  I am not saying nerf rorquals... I am saying It is so strange to punish players for reaching the late game... and then telling them to play with mid-game ships only.
---
So why can't this just be the next major patch?
---
Annnnd thanks for the downvotes to my post here, don’t really know who goes and downvotes someone for asking a simple question. Ahh eve, never change.
---
No you’re not claiming ignorance. You will realise you are soon though once you get a little real world education.
---
Is it worth extracting L5 subs skills and reinvesting somewhere else? I've got Legion and Tengu to 5 but could use a boost to some other skills

This is a cool idea. Just thought you should know that.

---
Heh
---
Yea I knew they where of no real use other than collectors items, makes me feel old 15 years I remember getting the BPO's of contracts 😮
---
you'd definitely see a lot fewer 1-5 bill T3c's and trigalvian ships getting lost and replaced the next day with the same fit. When money is harder to come by the bling is a little harder for people to justify.
---
Jump 5 ships in, have them all light cynos. 
---
Now your spooling speed is six times (five plus yourself) that it was before. 
---
Every change to the *cyno* itself can be worked around. No optimizing your force escalation is required. If you want to do that, you have to change the jump-drive. Make capital *pilots* put the effort in when jumping to a location.
---
The idea behind removing tether was simply just to make it harder to defend, that's all. No sitting a fleet on it and just waiting, or not engaging at all. No risk to sitting tethered unless it's in hull. 
---
Also, 110% agree with you on the rigs. They've been out for over two years now and the market for them is still insane. Especially medium and large rigs need tweaking.
---
Why? I mean real talk here. Why? I'll take the bait one more time.

Here is my statement: There is a good reason most of us call the lotto a stupid tax.

You're trying to nitpick what I call a lotto.

Warp-off and come back cloaked.
---
Yes pelase
---
Interesting that gives me like 100B  which sounds far more reasonable :D
---
Gave me 100B which makes far more sense and is much closer to what I would have thought... still no clue why it seems so high though (also gives nyx hull at sub 10B)
---
did you know ships can get from A to B without a cyno?
---
What I’m saying is, having some ridiculous cyno up time would make it impossible to save rorquals/caps etc. this numbnuts idea would only hurt little groups and force more people into large groups that can form protection fleets. 
---
All the changes in this godawful thread promote people to clam up even more and will not result in what people want.
---
&gt;force aux hulls
---
delete them
---
Can you explain to me what a blackout is?
---
No you can’t, there is amass limit that does not allow supers and titans. Learn to read more better
---
&gt;Skill injectors are fine. They allow new players to get up to speed in eve without waiting years.
---
They are not fine because they are being abused. Do you think a new player should be able to inject a carrier or bigger? If there was an honest attempt at trying to fix the "skill gap" (which was claimed to not effectively exist for a decade), there are other ways more reasonable ways to do that.
---
&gt;All they did in this case is better highlight the problem of how oppressive and over powered supers and titans are to the eve meta by accelerating it.
---
The problem also exists because the proliferation of caps. Injectors cause this.
---
I have a dream where null anoms eat drones like crazy and spawn stasis towers...  In this dream the vni still has 125mb drone bandwidth.
---
&gt;But ultimately if the demand for Titan/super pilots pilots is there, even without skill injectors the pilots would be available in the bazar. 
---
That was not really the case.
---
&gt;If you don't like injectors, that's fine, but even if we got rid of them I just don't think it would solve the problem except very, very temporarily.
---
Getting rid of injectors would be a long term solution.
---
you are lucky... i get several rorqs (ahemmmmm... snuff) dropped on me in low xD

I don't think CCP marketing are awake enough to pull something like that off, and Fozzie has a history of being *slightly* more outspoken with the playerbase.
---
Well, most people kinda just leave them alone. Partly out of respect, partly because it's not very good space.
---
They have a couple of very skilled PVP'ers to go along with their krabs though. They make good videos, and roleplay on the political spectrum.
---
I guess another group to recommend would be Arataka - but they're less about the "Lol we're the amarr lets go enslave people" and more about the "Lets blow these new NPC's up because why not and come up with cool stories about it." so I guess that depends on where they want to go.
---
It takes a different angle if you assume that the designers also don't like the current situation, the entire post sounds like the kind of thing you get from a boozy work lunch.
---
" balance " APOLLO TYRANNOS
---
&gt;Upside for big groups is: you can still move huge fleets fast if you use several bridges at once, but that requires organization and actual brains working.
---
Thanks for disgusing the last senteces of my post as a counter-argument. It's not a point against my idea.
---
I don't disagree per say, but capital ships are a force multiplier. I am not going to back seat game design, but in my brain, the way you fix them is you make them extremely vulnerable to ships of all classes without subcap escort. Because of this, I think FAXes are terrible ideas. 
---
And were I designing a game from the ground up I would try my best to use the real world as my litmus test. A USN super carrier, for instance, is an extremely powerful vessel, but nobody in their right mind would put one to sea without a battle group. 
---
And, at the end of the day, I am not sure you can 'fix' eve as it exists now without completely working all kinds of shit from detection/spotting mechanics and up so that you can provide a clear *and necessary* role for each ship type in fleet compositions.
---
That's semantics, if it's not an item you buy and fit to a ship in one of its module slots, it is not a module. It's just a piece of UI, much like the market screen or calculator.
---
this might be it, just did a quick google search for it , [https://youtu.be/cTMwgFlinuA?t=935](https://youtu.be/cTMwgFlinuA?t=935)
---
Shield ships still don't have slave equivalents though, so it works (maybe)
---
are you saying that pre-2013 NCPL had opportunities given to them that others in the game were not given? Sounds like in 2013 NCPL adapted to that current meta and goons hurfed so much ccp changed it to favour the krab empire?
---
Dagan's shields effectively repair themselves at 28HP/s (120HP/5s, +4HP/s passive regen). The issue is that he has pretty high damage resistance (85/81/78/74% to EM/Therm/Kin/Expl) so in reality, using Railguns or Blasters, you need to hit him with about 130DPS to reliably break through his defenses. Using small Railguns, this isn't reliably going to happen, so you do probably want to switch over to using Blasters. Fortunately from a defensive side, his guns deal almost entirely Explosive damage, which your Shields are naturally good against, so you can probably deal with his damage with an Afterburner and a Shield Extender or two.
---
As another option, you could try swapping ships to a Corax, and try using Light Missiles or Rockets to break through Dagan. See how Missiles feel compared to turrets. (Note: Because of Dagan's weakness to Explosive damage, if you do try this, use Nova missiles. While the Corax does get a bonus to Kinetic damage, Dagan's explosive weakness is greater than the Corax's bonus; using Explosive damage, you only need 110DPS to break Dagan's shields.)
---
Also, note on modules in general: Almost every module has several variations. The Tech I and Tech II variants are pretty obvious, but there's usually several other 'Meta' variants of them. These meta modules are tech I modules, but with much longer names and slightly improved stats in one or more ways. For weapons, these improvements are just straight up better range and damage, so when you're looking at fitting a ship and you can't use Tech II modules, you should almost always use some combination of Meta modules rather than using Tech Is. Meta modules also often have similar prices to Tech I modules, and in some cases may even be cheaper than Tech I modules.
---
For example, your 125mm Railgun Is could be replaced with 125mm Prototype Gauss Guns, which have 20% more Optimal Range and Damage.
---

Strategic Bombers fit "Ballistic Missile Launchers" that launch a scaled up bomb from &gt;200km away. The Battleship must guide the missile in all the way by staying on grid, and the missiles can be eliminated by either killing the controlling battleships, or shooting down the missiles themselves, which have stats similar to a MWD Assfrigate, can be webbed/scrammed, and a "hull bonus" the reduces damage done to it from large signature guns. On impact, each Ballistic Missile does 100,000 damage to supers and 15,000 damage to caps within a 40 km radius (note this is with reduced EHP, .5 mil for caps and ~3-5 mil for supers/titans), but fratricide each other so no more than 5 missiles can hit in the same wave.
---
[Dramatic Reenactment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY7v21Zy1yE)
---
He has some valid points, though it doesn't fit the hivemind so downvote away.
---
Especially apt is the bit about T3C's. They're superior to most ships in the game, by a significant margin. Caps are dropped on fleets of T3C's to guarantee wins. Just like fleets of T3C's jump ratting/mining ships - to guarantee kills.
---
And the fact that nobody gives a fuck about fights, it's all killboard padding and looking for easy kills. The hunters are as risk averse as the hunted. They just pretend they aren't.
---
Everytime I read about this sort of thing, I'm reminded of the *Honor Harrington* book series, principally because like Eve, subcapitals have been largely subsumed in military doctrine by super-dreadnoughts. In that series, subcapitals are still utilized to a degree, but primarily serving as screening elements for the capital ships they're grouped with, increasing their fleet's counter missile throw rate, rather than being considered a significant contributor to the actual offensive output of any particular fleet. 
---
The reason I bring it up is that I wonder if the appropriate response to all this isn't to try and jiggle around with the roles of capital ships, but perhaps look to give subcapitals a stronger role in a game that is inevitably going to trend towards capital ships. 
---
For example, pocket carriers could be introduced that can only carry space superiority fighters. Rather than fiddle with FAX stats, why not introduce tracking to Reps, and make subcapital logistics ship's tracking so heavily bonused that they're going to be applying their reps 100% of the time, whereas a FAX's much larger reps would only really have a 100% hit rate on other capital ships. 
---
I'm not suggesting the capitals as they are, are perfect, but it just seems like to me that over the years that EVE's been active, Capital ships have undergone the most revisions over and over in an attempt to kill the proliferation of capitals, and bring smaller ships back into the fold, and none of it has worked.
---
&gt; ack of the rupture looks a lot like an old pirate ship
---
Even moreso back in the day. Used to have a definite galleon look from the side.
---
Beautifully said, @CCP\_Falcon. I have to say you make a lot of great points - many of which I agree with. I see such an avenue as this as the only way to fix many of the problems we face due to capitals and supers. Well done.
---
I gotta disagree with banning supers and titans in lowsec. It limits the effectiveness of lowsec groups if they ever want ti venture into null.
---
That and my third favorite fight I've been in was when I was in snuff and we lost like 7 supers in nagamanen.
---
Do it! We want to hear your ideas!
---
Seems a lot of people were disappointed to discover that the Drifters are only hitting targets entirely randomly.
---
Eh all Amarrs come from the same breed :)
---
Man back in like 2016 in snuff we would run like 5-6 guardians supporting like 50+ prots/legions. Felt so good, so godlike keeping them all alive.

Spicy wrecks
---
Honestly, I'd be interested in reading your breakdown on it. You should run a blog for this stuff so we can provide feedback on them that way, if you don't already. Between reddit and that you'd probably get a lot of information to feed back to the rest of CCP.
---
&gt;You had no real counterplay to them, and were reducing player to player interaction
---
1) counter play was to shoot them with lights launchers, easy if already fit. just needed to get to the structure in time and for us they were only attacking in our TZ anyway
---
2) reducing player interaction? do you have a source on this? wildly having to burn from structure to structure actually increases possible player interaction. having to log in to deal with this bs... yeah that increases possible player interaction too.  
---
3) roamed plenty during this, didn't die to drifters.... sure, some did.
---
5 Supers on a gate with remote SEBOs assisted on a Hyena in a bubble. Hello volley of 50-100k.
---
And then you get bombed. Having a larger signature radius is not a good thing. Anyways I'm thinking about having it balanced around FAXes and working down from there, with FAXes needing the sig radius of a capital to properly apply. What I think we need is to have it so a FAX is useless for HAC fleets, with limited application for battleships. Large repair modules can stay as effective as they are for cruisers, but make them have less application to destroyers, though not at the level of the FAX nerf to subcaps.
---
How would you obliterate a low-sec capital if you can't cyno to whomever has tackled it? 
---
Are you going to gate your super fleet to it?
---
Nah someone probably dropped 50 T3C's on a ratting vexor for the most 3lite dank PvP ever seen, and then got mad when they ran into a titan gatecamp that bosoned them back home.
---
&gt;Only I'm allowed to get easy kills when my enemy can't realistically do anything. It stops being fun when they do it to me.
---
Bring back the slow cat
---
So you just like making ISK?   That is how you measure your success, well if it rocks your boat.   For a ganker who likes to sprout forth how AG fail, they did not this time, must have got his goat, just saying.
---
You guess is wrong, nothing to do with me, I just found it rather funny.   The whole ganking game is pretty damn stale and boring in any case, especially as you define your success in ISK, how lame!
---
God pantheon carriers were awful

https://www.petitions.net/biomass_nez_orlenard
---
My *feeling* (and my opinion is certainly nothing special) is that it should be as effective at defending itself at short range as a Battleship is at defending itself against frigates/drones at short range. Titans should be the primier siege/anti-cap tool, but should be vulnerable to smaller support fleets. Certainly dropping in a couple ships and blapping shouldn't be anywhere close to an easy answer to a fleet of subcaps moving through your territory. I've been reading up, and after seeing some battle reports where exactly that seems to have happened, I just thought "That... that's not right..."
---
&gt; MWD Assfrigate
---
It would be interesting to maybe have single-shot bombs that do massive damage like that, but are so large they can only be loaded in station or with a fitting service. 
---
A suitcase carrier providing support for a fleet of heavy/strategic bombers like that would be really interesting.
---
i dont understand your 1st point. that said, while C is trying to fuck A, B is trying to fuck C and their A is trying to fuck your C etcetc. that is the beauty of it, it becomes about strategy and tactics - just like a real battle.
---
im talking about nerfing them, its just a question of how. just taking some EHP off them wont actually do anything to the core of the problem imo.
---
Easier just to bring a bunch of bombers and blink cloak on and off. Or bring RR leshaks or something.
---
Would you say the same if CCP decide to increase tracking of all capital guns and nerf T3C's to the ground tomorrow? Though not. This adapt or die bullshit is fucking idiotic, why haven't you adapted to caps bending you over all the time?
---
If we have 5939388 threads about capitals being bad cause they kill me and me no likey every fucking day, we can have a thread or two from the other point of view.
---
Tethering should be a Service Module, with fitting and fuel costs.
---
Like. Nice “gotcha” I guess except there’s nothing “wanton” about taking literally years and tons of feedback before making changes.
---
I’m all for well thought out, considered, data driven changes to the game that kill off or dramatically alter a playstyle.
---
I’m also for relatively major but ultimately not playstyle breaking changes like the VNI repurpose.
---
And I’m also for constant minor tweaks that keep things interesting, such as balance tweaks and hull buffs.

But this idea that we need to make Supers/Caps useless against subs and also die to them constantly is garbage. It comes from people who don’t want to organize, or play in large groups, but who want to use those same large groups as feeding grounds with low effort. It’s ultimately the equivalent of rolling back the wardec changes purely because PIRAT is mad they can’t grief people any more.
---
If you can’t figure out how supers and caps and even Titans are dying on a literal daily basis then I don’t know what to tell you. The issue isn’t opportunity or mechanics though.
---
Put them up on the forums. See if there's a collector interested, you might be able to wrestle a pretty penny out.
---
I've lost quite a few 1v1s to kikis in solo jaguars. It really feels like the kiki is the hard counter to most jag fits. Now, jag with a gang is obviously a big threat. Worm I can kinda see, kitey t3d I can kinda see but you can't get into point range.
---
Game is in freefall so fuck it change away, hopefully something can save this Trainwreck.
---
I mean, these missiles would be pretty big, like 1000m3 each so you can't carry them in any subcap combatant that's not a Strat Bomber, which can carry 1 in the launcher and 1 spare.
---
Visually they'd be reflected on the model, like the entirety of the Rohh's front would be turned into a giant missile tube to shoot these missiles.
---
&gt;Two way street. Cancer cloaking and grief playstyle is ONLY countered by cancer umbrella
---
You're correct, but they won't listen. They want their easy risk free kills and refuse to understand that their actions have shaped the current meta. How do people have balls to say adapt or die now, when they're still fucking whining .
---
That's certainly one way to approach it, but I don't think adding any additional costs will take away from its strength as when you're running an azbel or larger you're probably already making your own fuel to the point it's not a problem at all.
---
25000-50000 Isotopes (which isotope depends on race) for a regular Doomsday (18-36mil ISK / 750-1500m3 cargo space)  
---
1000-2000 Strontium Clathrates for a Boson (3.7-7.4mil ISK / 3000-6000m3 cargo space)
---
\+ ship is immobilized for 30s, and cannot Jump/Dock/Tether/Cloak for 5 minutes, + firing burns 30000GJ capacitor which requires either Batteries or Rechargers or Injectors to recover between shots. (Assuming that's recovered using only cap injectors, that's at most 7mil ISK / 960m3 cargo space in Navy 3200s.)
---
Skill training can cut Doomsday firing costs in half; the 50,000/2000 are the base values before skills.
---
So Boson camping a gate takes a good bit of fuel by volume, but is absolutely unbelievably cheap.
---
Lmao  yup mine was dhsj
---
The real problem is actually skill injectors.  Whatever the flaws and imbalances Eve had, injectors are making it way worse and way too fast.
---
I didn't even notice a difference - what skill was it? Did they remove race specific skills? I had a boatload of SP when I started back up again recently - that's probably where it came from.
---
I somehow missed that part of your post. Apologies. 
---
However, I don't believe it really takes a lot of brains. Every time you're jumping a pile of ships anywhere, you do end up with someone FC'ing. The FC tells which people to jump first. They jump. The FC tells everyone else to jump. Everyone jumps. It's something a trained monkey can do. 
---
Have one person with brains in fleet isn't hard. Having enough cyno ships in fleet might be hard for small alliances. So this might just help the big blocs more.
---
The desired changes for who? Players, who have nothing but speculation to go on, or CCP, who haven't really disclosed their reasons for the blackout?
---
I don't think ANYONE will disagree with you there - but this is mostly my view on the flavor-of-the-week.
---
IMO skill injectors should have some form of cooldown associated, to forcibly slow things down.
---
Riot takes it too far though, some things are changed just for the sake of change.
---
I'd have capital caches (We already do) spread around with slowcat carriers and have people go to them in travel t3's with their slave/amulet clones (Slaves will soon be called amulet's) and/or jump clones based on where the action was. I'd then proceed to flatten all the subcaps on the grid, because I have more capitals, capitals cannot be effectively waterboarded in lowsec, and there's absolutely no counterplay to me bringing a shitload of capitals since cynos would no longer be a thing. The only real limiting factor would be if someone was able to bring more capitals than SNUFF, which is doubtful and the ability of my pilots to get to places beforehand. For most timers though, our spies would give us plenty of notice so we could be there in advance.
---
Effectively groups like SNUFF would be invincible in lowsec and we'd clear out every small/medium alliance that even thought about holding moons etc. There's no reason to think this wouldn't expand to a bluetral-style nullsec pact with the larger entities in lowsec all collectively renting out moons, while also crushing any would-be small entities. (Sound familiar to the current system?)
---
They have 0 value if everyone stops logging in.  That other game I referred to, people spent over a decade growing their characters.  The winners ended up having the best characters in a dead game.  
---
At least if you devalue some things and people get pissed and leave, you might get new blood sticking around instead of a slow, long decline of players, until the only content is camping g starter areas.
---
I'd be interested in buying them for the right price. Pm me if you're interested
---
Lmao no local wasn't enough. 
---
Now we get non stop bitching about warp stabs and things being hard to catch. How have you not adapted to the the thing you fucking asked for yet??
---
&gt;But no I want ratting to mean you can only fit guns that damage NPC's not players, fitting warp stabs will make your ship do 13.7% of its regular DPS, and when you kill a rat, you're locked in position for 45 minutes, with no ability to cloak, warp, and a 650,000% signature radius modifier. Response fleets should have to scan a ratter down before they save it (the Sig radius modifier doesn't apply to them) but hunters should have all ratters appear on their overview at any range soon as they enter system, and fitting a bait ship should be a bannable offence by CCP. 
---
#No. Shut the fuck up.
---
While some of these changes might be good for the game I think they would also make me quit.
---
Agreed. Injectors are the worst culprits.  And citadels too. They need to be toned down. A lot.
---
I don’t remember exactly as I started to skill into them when this happens but this may be the reason of the sp stack ;)
---
You can, if it's a lone fax (it never is).  Bring a couple neuts.
---
&gt; Would you say the same if CCP decide to increase tracking of all capital guns and nerf T3C's to the ground tomorrow? 
---
Yes. I'll just go back to flying a stratios. I'll have adapted instead of dying.
---
You think that a 4-5 pilot coordinated frig gang taking down a BS is *extreme*? The absolute state of this game these days, holy shit. Who let in all these garbage fucking players who don't understand core game mechanics?  Mechanics that, mercifully, still "work" in sub cap battles until someone pushes the iwin button and drops, of course.
---
Eve is not a linear game. More expensive =/= more gooder, k? Different hulls for different roles.
---
Ya, its likely only because this is one the most posted types of threads.
---
The only part that really affects you right now is that they invade systems like incursions do. Triglavians will camp the gates though and can chew through a frigate quickly if you are not fast. A cruiser can tank them typically. So just a heads up when going through the systems in highsec. As far as I know, they don't web scram.
---
was talking about suitonia but what ever dude, you know..... single frig taking the piss out of a fuckin capital ship.... you know..... kinda sounds extreme to me idiot.
---
&gt;"I'd want to make it so that it wasn't cost effective or tactically sound to have huge numbers of them on field."
---
That's precisely when its cost effective to bring more than what the enemy has. They'll pull out early and run to mommy because of this thing called the Lanchester's Square Law. If you have 4 vs 2 the power relationship is 4\^2 vs 2\^2 which gives you 16 to 4 power ratio, which basically means if you're all buffer tanked ships (which everything is in tidi), then the 4 will only lose 4/16=0.25 their combined HP, ie 1 out of 4 ships if the enemy 2 ships have perfect focus fire. Meanwhile the enemy 2 ships have both been destroyed for the cost of one. In a battle where you have 100 vs 80 and you're the losing side, if you do the math you will lose less before disengaging if you bring 90 instead of 80, and the enemy will lose less if they bring 110 instead of 100. Every little piece of flotsam you can muster, means you lose less asset worth in battle. 
---
Now imagine you have one flank with 10 ships and another flank with 10 ships, and the enemy has 12 ships on one flank and 8 on the other, what is best course of action? On the flank where you have 10 against 8, you will win, and on the other flank you will lose. So you disengage from the losing flank and move everything over to the winning flank and go balls deep so hard and fast you hope to win that battle before the enemy from the other flank can catch up. This is mobile warfare 101 from kindergarten. So obviously, why split up in the first place except as bait that no one in their right mind is going to take? 
---
Hence, Eve battles will always be set-piece battles around a singular objective, no matter the mechanics. And it always means you're better off bringing more, because you'll lose less if you bring more. Even if the battle is ultimately lost and you disengage (like we can do because tidi and downtime), you still lose less if you brought more. 
---
**Therefore I think we should be able to bring more.** That is where the problem is today. We can't bring more. Do you have any idea how long it takes to train a dreadnought pilot? Do you have any idea how much effort it is to reship and refuel during a battle like X47 armor timer? Because of tidi there's like 1 hour game time taking place over 10 hours real time, yet its hard to reship, its a PITA to hand out dreads to enough people, its a PITA to load grid with 2500 fighters on it, it s a PITA to load grid with 2000 frigates on it (who could've been in battleships instead and done real damage). 
---
SP was a mistake. Its a barrier for when you are allowed to lose your shit on the battlefield, and makes everyone think before they leap.
---
&gt;Cloaks are removed from the game as part of the T3C nerf. 
---
&gt;Astero, stratios and Nestor have agility decreased by 80%, and can now only be hull tanked, as they receive negative bonuses to Shields and armour.
---
My point is if CCP nerf the thing you like flying/have worked hard towards getting, your enjoyment/interest will take a hit too
---
as mentioned in the other thread,  sig radius based reps is a horrible idea. 
---
the 'downside' to MWDs Istabs and shield tanking modules would suddenly be an upside.  You might even want to target paint your own ships.
---
&gt;As for going SOLO my guess if you were in a venture in 0.5 space you are not worth killing for a suicide ganker or even worth loss of security standing for that matter. If it was a person who killed you.. it was just a PvP newb who saw an easy kill and just couldn’t resist.
---
Ventures are as valid a gank target as anything else. I've ganked hundreds of them. CODE. sometimes has contests to see who can bag the most Ventures in a month. I like to gank them with a Velator in 0.5.
---
I like it..!
---
They could fix fax by giving a penalty on reps depending on ship size caps would get full reps but smaller ships less
---
I though no one was ratting anymore since local is gone &gt;_&gt;
---
Thanks for the update Dunk, keep up the good work and ignore the pubbie VNI gankers.
---
Lmao. No you'll just have to scan shit.
---
Why are you zoomed in tho
---
Do you feel that not allowing supers and titans to dock in keepstars would be a good thing. Basically go back to the old logging off in space thing we use to do? Tbh I feel that this change would help eve greatly.
---
You just sit next to them. Their dps is actually really good especially because they don't waste time between targets. Kill something, instant switch target, kill something else.
---
And yes they do instant damage which for combat sites, when you're competing against other players, helps you win the loot. My Ishtar was also using sensor boosters, just for that reason.
---
Something told me to expect it to happen, I figured what the heck who cares. Better to ask and see what people have to say then to start playing blind. Now to get all my ships and stuff sorted out again!
---
Wah! Make it easy to kill. Wah!! Easy kills... WWWAAAHHHHH!!  - you
---
i agree with that an athanor should be weaker, but still i don't think passive income was something "terrible" year ago the economy was pretty stable, the real treat for economy is the capital farm under an umbrella and Rorqual mining, not passive moon 
---
and more when my idea make them very weak and a target for pvper you need to defend a structure with a 1-12h timer 2 timer (like an ansiblex) and no weapon, anyone can kill them with a subcap if no one defend it, i don't see the problem
---
CCP Hire this guy!    
---
Oh wait.
---
Working as intended
---
You go against this reddit rethoric. 
---
But what you said is the truth. But hunter will said no, beacause if they agree it means they do'nt know how to play. 
---
I know some pvp player who engage super alone in frigate and have good result. But a mjority just go to find more easy target.
---
These fights without triage would be horrible.
---
With Jam meta in wh shield feets, you'd have to invest 10+ people into logi and the fleets would lose all their bite.
---
These changes seem so obvious, what is CCP waiting for?
---
It's likely on the CCP side of things without anything being stored locally. Maybe I'm wrong, but that would be my guess.
---
Or what about, and just hear me out for a second, we return to a "third" playstyle where you have mixed composition fleets? Rather than having to choose between bland blob fests or having to literally avoid anywhere capitals might be just to be able to enjoy flying a subcap in some sort of meaningful pvp setting? 
---
Krabs always complain that the "elite pvp" types (people who can fly a ship without being accompanied by 100 titans) only want to kill poor wittle carebears rather than actually fight, but I fucking guarantee that if you polled subcap pvp pilots you'd get overwhelming support for any move that opened up the usefulness of subcaps *beyond* ganking vnis. People would gladly trade that shit *away* for grid relevance again.
---
Currently if you want to have a fun, mixed composition fleet battle it either has to be arranged as an honor brawl (which is a desperation move we shouldn't have to resort to) or you have to avoid anyspace with titans, which leaves you with what? Some wh's and hisec? Everywhere else in New Eden flying subcaps is effectively pointless from a fleet perspective, and that's a massively warped place for eve to be.
---
Exactly.
---
To bad the vast majority of ccp doesnt play eve nor do they get it. And dont bother arguing as thats been sourced from multiple angles and people that have had a peak in at the inner workings. And untill that changes we will keep getting changes that dont make sense or make one step forward and 5 backwards.
---
Just looked at the fitting room of an Azbel. That is a problem, fitting costs of service modules are minuscule.
---
Fully loading one up with; Capital Shipyard, Manufacturing Plant, Market Hub, Cloning, and a Copy-Lab. All of that eats up less CPU than one Guided Bomb Launcher, and only a tiny hair more powergrid. 
---
I think you're right; build your own fuel, and it becomes a total non-issue. The number of SM slots would have to come down from five to three for a 'tether module' to even be close to a meaningful choice.
---
Maybe you should be roaming for other “elite” high sec corps then. You all can form fleets of 10 ravens to guard your veldspar belts.
---
On what level? Running missions and mashing f1 or doing pi doesnt much count as playing the game. Your design team should have people doing all aspects at all levels of gameplay to better understand the impact and ramifications of changes that are made. And its been made all to apparent with changes that this doesnt happen as a week or two later oh shit this thing the player base totally said would happen, happened.
---
Pretty cool, how are they to fight? Are many people using the new ships?
---
I'll concede the argument to you. I think you've made a fair point.
---
i know your game. 6 months after titans were reprocessed you would turn it back :P
---
So you just choose to avoid the reality of the scenarios you've been presented with and run with your imagination instead? 
---
BTW, effective small ship doctrines can counter general superiority IRL, see the US military's war games that demonstrated Iranian light ship screens could take down a carrier fleet if you want to learn more. Obviously a group of smaller ships working in a coordinated manner should be able to take down large prey. 
---
This isn't wow, where the only thing separating a new player from and old one are higher stats across the board. There's a give and take to moving around different hull sizes (at least, there used to be and there should be again).
---
He doesn't know game mechanic. Maybe in the past he was relevant. Not any more.
---
To be fair, this might be the only solution left to counter capitals and resource generation.  
---
Imagine a fleet warping or jumping into a mine field or a colossal belt that is a mine field.  
---
I was not around for them, but how did arming them work (without setting them off)?
---
You need to see the bigger picture. If your enjoyment is causing more players to quit than it does draw new players in its in ccps best interests to obliterate you.
---
Think I have some mines floating around still in a station somewhere. Sold the bp for some isk. Over time, someone will definitely buy them
---
&gt;MCAV undocks enough Gilas
---
🤔
---
I did this recently with a very low SP alt, using a blaster-fit Cormorant. Something like this should do (I actually used a meta MSE and invu, and meta 4 instead of 3 blasters, but it shouldn't make much of a difference):
---
\[Cormorant, Dagan\]
---
Magnetic Field Stabilizer I
---
Micro Auxiliary Power Core I
---
1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
---
Medium Shield Extender I
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field I
---
Anode Light Ion Particle Cannon I
---
Small Core Defense Field Extender I
---
With a low skilled toon, I got \~150+DPS with faction ammo (Antimatter), \~140 with regular T1 ammo. Just make sure to approach him at an angle with AB on, as others have suggested, so that you negate some of the incoming damage. Once you're in range, orbit him, and he won't be able to track you and you'll be able to burn him down eventually.
---
Imagine a null site that can only practically be completed by a mid size fleet using pvp tactics. Instead of pvp ships praying on PVE-fit ships (which honestly is no different from killing NPCs), attacking crabs would actually produce fights!
---
YESHHH JOHNNNN COME BACK TO THE GAME! I hear paragon soul is lovely this time of year!
---
Well... She's not wrong...
---
Hunters and the hunters. Null sec regions no longer have the same content as before.
---
Lol flip, have r/eve on speeddial much? xD Probably not Paragon, not looking to join a big blobby alliance at this point. But good hearing from you man.
---
so, almost like it was 5 years ago, huh?
---
125mm rails aren't one of those weapon systems where meta 4 is a stupid price.
---
The current meta... it will only get worse... so enjoy being happy as a little girl :p
---
I don’t fit the narratives, but i don’t care about reddit karma.  My only hope is it sunk in enough to get people off their whining pedastals to want and push for REAL change
---
Stop crying. I built a station. So I could have a piece of eve forever.....and then!
---
bro that looked genuinly like alot of fun 8i
---
There's a lot to that. Way back when I worked on a different MMO, we had a problem with players easily being able to send gold (a physical object in that game) to their bank from anywhere. Since inventory was based on weight, and gold was heavy, that really limited the amount of gold that was generated and brought out of the depths of dungeons.  
---
Then some designer created thing object that was supposed to "be expensive to use" (sound familiar?) that let you magically send any object to your bank... including those heavy piles of gold.  
---
And there was a duping issue in that game, so the commodity that was supposed to make it expensive to use was plentiful and cheap, and so everyone just started sending their gold straight back, pile after pile after pile.  
---
Then another designer decided to make gold weigh a lot less, and that just doubled down on the issue, since you didn't even need the supposedly costly commodity now, you could just carry a bunch yourself.  
---
I undid all that, upped the usage of that commodity so that it really was not worth it for a pile of gold, and then when players complained a bit, the designer who made the weight change originally just undid it. It was right as I was leaving the team, so I didn't bother arguing.  
---
It sucked, but people are definitely invested in their ideas, and I've since learned that it's one of the signs of a mature designer when they can let go of that emotional attachment. Junior designers are seriously sometimes a pain to work with because everything is so personal, and they act like you're trying to take way their puppy. :-P
---
No, the correct attitude is "don't fly what you can't afford to lose"
---
Hmm. can't see whats wrong here...
---
Very valid points on the structures.  Honestly, citadels and their power and utility FAR outstrip their cost
---
Timer. You had to run away from what I remember.  They got taken out of the game like 6 months before I started for real.
---
Yeah it seems almost all are over 2 years old
---
Didn’t run it through grammarly, my bad
---
Well said.
---
Yes.  They’d often just sit in lowsec or cyno around because no bubbles.  Caused great fights when hics came for low sec.  so... ja
---
I don't think caps are causing new players to quit tbh? 
---
It's more likely the cloakys and T3C's griefing noobs.
---
:)
---
lol someone bought some 200mm ACs for 4B+ once (like &lt; 10 units). I was the only reasonably priced sell orders and there were a handful of stupid expensive sell orders (700M+ ea). IDK how that happens but never heard of it. 
---
Another time someone filled my fat buy order of t2 mods for way under market. They messaged me and asked me to contract them back at a decent profit. Was feeling generous, so did.
---
Unpopular opinions that call out what people don’t want to hear are easier to ignore than to process.
---
I’m sorry if it personally offended you, it wasn’t directed at you personally i promise :)
---
Where did I say I "just like making isk?"  I'm just pointing out the stupidity of you gloating that a guy who made trillions lost less than a billion isk one time.  Drop in the bucket, my friend.  
---
Re: Anti-ganking "not failing" that one time.  Their name is "anti-gank" yet they did nothing to prevent the gank.  I'd call that a failure.  Reading comprehension is hard when you're so busy moving goalposts. 
---
Lastly, I know my name is "wormhole gank" but that doesn't make me a highsec ganker.  Again, reading ain't your strong suit, is it?  
---
Better luck next time, anti-ganker.  You guys lose in Uedama AND reddit!
---
RIP my comprehension.  Too many double negatives shook me.  You're right.
---
I sincerely hope this was copypasta - otherwise you're either having a stroke or English is your fourth language.
---
Well if your viewpoint is “they will get shafted and quit and that’s good” then there’s little to discuss other than”no”.  It’s a polarized resolution
---
Haha, people do this all the time in eve. It's ok to scam people--even if it was by accident
---
I hear more salt from weekend warrior wormholers and small roam gangs who station out of npc space than I hear on coms. The general consensus is that the blackout has been fun.
---
The amount of times I've read some form of "that isn't fair" from people who want to basically pick on targets who seem defenceless tho is staggering. It's like the soyboyvegan dipshit who picks a fight with a boxer complaining about getting his ass whooped because the boxer is a no-life who spends too much time at the gym.
---
... so there needs to be a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
What would happen if a decent amount of redditors mailed in your suggestions to the ccp office?
---
No, this is not the case - this is just me spitballing ideas, as I've said many times in both these threads.
---
There should be no expectations here.
---
If this post gets deleted, someone needs to call 911.
---
Bring back battleship alpha fleets
---
Better question is do people in lowsec know that?
---
My main problem with this is that "carrier" means something to people, and the old triage support definition just isn't it.  
---
It sounds like what you want is to keep FAX, just change how they operate. (Which I think is very necessary... the N+1 problem is grossly magnified by the power of logistics, by making it an alpha ships off the field or go home game).  
---
But if you're gonna have a ship type called a carrier, they should carry fighters, otherwise why are they even "carriers"?  
---
Now, you can adjust the behavior of all the different parts of these designs to achieve the same effect that you're aiming for her, but to keep things at least somewhat intuitive, things should be named according to their functionality.
---
How would getting rid of injectors be a long term solution to super and cap proliferation? I honestly am asking, is there something I'm missing?
---
Like aside from the sp give aways and that one starter pack, the sp influx rate into the total serverwide sp pool stays the same regardless of whether injectors exist or not. People will just start rolling purpose bulit toons and the percent of newly generated sp dedicated to creating new super and Titan toons stays the same.  At best you get a breif slow down while the meta adjusts.
---
That's super dangerous. Makes walking in stations a little more exciting though.
---
Call it Jin’taan. We know Jin’taan cringes at the sound of his own name.
---
&gt; Why the conspiracy theory?    
---
&gt; Falcon is just a passionate dude that works at CCP.    
---
https://i.imgflip.com/369xxp.jpg
---
It will be shifting more power to the groups that can drop their caps with a support fleet.
---
So exactly how ass backwards are you on this? You like 100% safe eve where fat useless crabs and bots call the shots on everyones playstyle?
---
Is this the eve you want?
---
Holy fuck. PLEASE CCP. DO THIS.
---
Anticap battleships? Now only if there was a capital good at killing capitals... cough cough dreadnought
---
Maybe, but sometimes you just have to say fuck it and go for big air.
---
cool, but not number 7, its fun to hunt supers ratting and dreads in WH space.
---
Wish more people flew like that though
---
I think that's why they don't let Fozzie speak as much anymore.
---
Let’s see all your Titan kills.
---
If a carrier doesn't field fighters... is it a carrier anymore?
---
the day that i got a job that paid me a decent wage, i stopped grinding pve for isk in eve, its simply not worth my time to "work" for isk since i pretty much already do that IRL
---
i understand some people like pve which is fun but thats not for me.  too much grinding in various MMOs over the year have put an end to that desire.
---
This would be fucking fantastic.
---
I know I voted for you but pls don’t tell them to end the blackout. It’s not about hurting blocs or the big guy vs little guy dynamic, it’s just the simple fact that every system feels more dangerous and more interesting. It keeps everything on edge.
---
Carriers should work like they do in Homeworld
---
Lol ironically joecuster actually has been involved in the death of many many titans
---
Say that 5 times fast
---
&gt; PvP is better with a strong sense of Justice™
---
now with 50% more Righteousness
---
Does that mean we have to reverse all our downvotes?
---
I dunno, looks even more playable to me....
---
I remember using them, spaffed out a mine field from a kestrel, then nearly died to it. Noped out pretty hard after that.
---
 Its called dreads
---
What sorta price do people pay for these?
---
I want a subcap designed for that though. Partly cause I really like the leshak. Triangles and lasers are fun.
---
It shouldn't be as effective as a dread Vs another cap, but two or three of them should be similar.
---
now with 50% more *Righteousness*
---
I disagree with one point and one point only; the removal of high angle weapons.
---
Remove them from titans, not dreads.
---
I like HAW dreads and enjoy seeing fights online of a HAW dread 1v30 trying their best to keep the enemy fleet interested and still killing them.
---
Also, if you keep HAW weapons around for dreads only, maybe make special ded sites for dreads or restrict capital access of atoms to dreads? The idea behind that being is you're stuck in siege so it is balanced when it comes to risk/ward; and they also already have to use fuel to siege
---
This is what happens when you use one too many skill extractor.
---
You say that as if thousands of goons weren't in here reeeeeeeing into the void as if the (I agree) obviously temporary event wasn't going to end.
---
Fun little mini-game though figuring out where I was talking

CCP: (switches to local)

Me: I'm going down the chain

Cloaked Prot: I don't think so

They already have power though. They drop their caps with more caps and I have to read about it every day on this this sub.
---
Considering the production costs and requirements of Orcas, you’re not too far off.
---
Imagine maintaining a program for a game you don't play so that people who do play can tab out of the game and not play themselves. Genuinely big brain.
---
I'm on about a subcap though. The leshak almost fills the role I'm thinking of, although not entirely. 
---
A dread is not a subcap.
---
If a subcap could output 33% of a dreads damage against cap. The megacoalitions would just field fleets of them against their enemies. Capital warfare as it stands now would be over. Capitals couldnt counterplay at all. If these did exist. They would need to be glass cannons. Something that wouldnt last very long against a strike. Maybe similar to the mauraders siege mode. Making them immobile and making their signature radius capital sized
---
Why when you fly through brothers of tangra space they always tell you that they ''don't rent'' and are independent.
---
IMO buff bomber dps vs caps, and make anti cap bomb runs a thing. suddenly caps need a support fleet with defenders to be max effective.
---
I mean, tbh only sirens/Dromis are an issue. I've no idea how the ECM fighters stack up, but the neut fighters are roughly on par with a medium neut, maybe two? They're pretty piss poor.
---
You don't need to fill the role of a ship that already exists.        
---
CCP fucked up eve with injectors and now we see the 'final, fatal' effects.
---
You should delete this cancer and be the hero the game needs.
---
Drifters, blackout, a whole new faction of kinda OP ships...
---
Name checks out.
---
Drone swarm from 1500 people with carriers on grid was an issue, that amounted to anywhere between 15000 and 45000 drones all doing...things.
---
That works. Yeah probably not 33%, the numbers would need fine tuning and I'm just throwing ideas out there rn. But yeah I'd support glass cannons too, maybe more of a destroyer than a battlecruiser, so it has a paper thin tank without siege/needs to remote rep with others to not die fast.
---
Join a corp which has a moon. Join in on their moon extraction shared cans.
---
Also, 0.5 is not LowSec. You got suicide ganked. People think it's fun to blow up miners even when it results in losing your ship for pretty much no gain.
---
You're still missing the point. It's about necessitating mixed composition fleets again, rather than encouraging capital zerging. No navy on earth would send out an aircraft carrier without an entire fleet of various surface and sub-surface ships to escort and support it, no matter how individually badass it may be.
---
I'd like to see an extra turret hardpoint added to the Thrasher. Keep the same number of highs, so you can't actually fit another gun, but you know, you *could* if there was another high slot.
---
I too would be interested in acquiring those bpo's 
---
You can contact SurtrPtah if you'd like about it
---
I disagree. 
---
It doesn't matter how many people in the game can fly a frigate. What matters is how many people can fly titans. This obviously bring the question - why?
---
The answer is that these are the ships that are unbalanced. Skill injectors cause the unbalance to be amplified.
---
I'm glad you are having fun.  Playing should be fun. :)
---
I'm just saying that blackout doesn't address the core issues facing null sec. My fear is that once people adapt, nothing will have been really fixed, and we'll be back where we started.
---
It doesn't exist though. Or I'd own one in addition to my carrier, and not have to read "ccpls nerf nids they're mean to me" every day. 
---
&gt;CCP fucked up eve with injectors and now we see the 'final, fatal' effects.
---
Perhaps. Although as others have said, we'd eventually have reached this stage with or without injectors. Characters were always able to be bought and sold, if not SP.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. Caps don't need to be exponentially more powerful and durable than battleships.
---
I wrote down what I had heard as the main thing people wanted 'fixed'.  That's what I'm referring to.
---
When you're in the heat of the fight you don't get to think about it but EVE gets cinematic as *fuck* sometimes. A fleet of cruisers HAM barraging a titan is a good way of generating cinematic moments, especially when you have a cameraman who can record them from some good angles.
---
TLDR: you created a program that kills content in NS, moved to a wormhole because of your own program and then ultimately quit playing 2 years ago.
---
I'm so sick of this crap. Whah wah Nerf this or that. "It's not fair my frig can't solo a Super" 
---
Damn boys if this shit keeps up we might as well just turn EVE into Fortnight in spaceships. 
---
We already have half the ships in the game so trash nobody uses them. 
---
Instead of nerfing something else how about taking some of the 20+ ships already in the game no one usese because they're crap and BUFFING something for a change.
---
CCPlease balance doesn't have to equal Nerf everything to the point no one wants to play.
---
These two need to get together.

Appropriately scaled-up capital sized smart bombs could be interesting.
---
To the OP and to any csm member please hear me out cause you and ccp have something gotten it wrong all together . Reworking Force auxiliaries and or removing them and giving them to carriers as /u/CCP_Falcon says will not solve the problem . The problem here is the triage module . Let me illustrate how a triage in a battlefield works . Triage is giving essential hp to lot of allies in a short time while not nursing back to full health . But in eve you need to kill these ships before you can kill any other ship. so technically if you translate this to eve i would say put triage as an aoe slow repping mechanic, but this would be either OP or suck for a capital ship so lets go to a more feasible option .   
---
Triage module 
---
1. Triage will resemble a lot like NSA modules consume cap with shorter cycles . While in Triage you get to rep allies at a fast rate but you never heal yourself.  This will also mean you are going to lose all cap eventually due to being in triage too long . Cap injecting could delay there but there is no scenario that your ship is cap stable .
---
2. While out of triage you are able to rep yourself at an increased rate with local repairers ( gallente version) or you gain massive resists ( amarr version) 
---
3. Remove optimal range bonus for triage while giving them the ability to move like NSA . Give amarr Fax remote repper optimal range per lvl and Gallente version remote repper rep amount per lvl . The ships themselves should sport a 50% ewar resistance 
---
4. Because triage has both online and offline contrasting bonuses just fitting a triage module on a force aux makes it immune to remote reps . This will mean one fax cannot rep another fax and out of triage the amarr version gains something like 80% resists across the board and gallente version gets more and local repair amount bonus.
---
5. This might be a bit harsh on fax pilots but this is how it should be . Capital repair modules should be % total hp repair module . This will mean fax will repair super caps at better than sub caps . example the capital armor repaier reps for 2% of targeted ship (Nyx) total armor hp.
---
This is why I primarily run smart ships :P
---
Another thing to look for is moon ore. The prices vary crazy in Jita where usually the costs are pulled. If you have some moon ore in a hangar somewhere and the Jita price spikes, you can see this stuff.
---
It’s very poor game design to have cost be this weighted when it comes to balance. Honestly I don’t mind that fuel being PART of the receipt to fire a doomsday. The other part should be more imaginative.
---
Imagine that such a weapon required tapping the power of the sun. Depending on the type of doomsday you wanted to fire, would depend on the type of sun to tap. There would not be mining ships capable of harvesting the power of the sun except for the titan itself.
---
Each sun can be particularly harvested once every 24 hours to fuel a titans doomsday. A titan jumping to cynos also eats away at this fuel. The amount of time needed to harvest the suns power could be 10-30 minutes depending on what feels balanced.
---
The idea is to put the titan at risk and to encourage them to spread out. Having 50 titans all huddled into one system would not be sustainable in the slightest. Not if you intend to use them now and then. Toss in a mechanic that slowly drains the sun harvest to zero after a week (subscribed or not) and now you have something.
---
The titan is still strong when used, but spamming the doomsdays, especially storing many titans together in the same system is not feasible.
---
Anyways, bring on the flames. Just trying to impress the idea that balancing around time should be more important than balancing around an alliances wallet.
---
I just want to know what's going to happen to the VNI now that they've nerfed it's mining bonus?!?
---
No idea what this post even means.
---
If you don't want them, you could start an auction for these on the forums. I'm sure some collectors will pay top dollar for these items.
---
FAXes deleted by 2020 CONFIRMED!
---
TLDR: tell me a story and send me IRL $, perhaps I will send you books and also get you perma banned for not using the character bazaar.
---
So rather than fix the problem at its source, you want to require every small gang have "a few" ships that only apply to caps along if they want to roam?
---
Presumably so you can respond to everyone who complains when you drop caps on their frigate 'just bring x!', right?
---
Sacrificing players for the potential of interesting new players is not a good business practice. Ruining the incentive for end game ships isn't better, it's a recipe for staleness and won't lengthen the game.
---
People will get bored without goals. When you see a Titan it should be a wow factor for new players. Hell I just built mine about half a year ago and had been mining and ratting my ass off for a long time to get it. All that hard work for some jealous people to complain and get it nerfed.
---
You feel like you don't have a chance against them. I get it. I ran away from some when they cyno'd in too but it took a long time to get into and a lot of work. To make it less formidable would be an insult to those that put a lot of time into getting it.
---
Check the shield resist profile of your target. The Oracle mentioned by the other reply is my preferred tool as well, but depending on the faction of the tower you're hitting, the Oracle may or may not be able to hit into its resist hole. A Triglavian ship (Drekavac, Leshak) or a heavy drone boat with sentries (Dominix, Ishtar, maybe VNI or Stratios) are also good options with minimal reloading.
---
&gt;I'm so sick of this crap. Whah wah Nerf this or that. "It's not fair my frig can't solo a Super"
---
You're preaching to the choir. I've been downvoted for saying a frig shouldn't be able to either pin down a carrier solo, or avoid getting blapped. I trained for ages for my carrier, and have no desire to see it nerfed, unlike half this sub. I remember looking through the ship tree and wanting to fly it years back. Imo capitals being funded is what new players look forward to. It's a goal to work towards.
---
Capitals should be powerful. If something is going to take me down, I'd rather it be a few hard hitting, specialised hulls like a leshak gang than a blob of bombers or something. I fly a leshak on an alt, and it got me thinking.
---
&gt;Fortnight
---
It's like you don't want a John wick skin for your ship or something
---
&gt;Instead of nerfing something else how about taking some of the 20+ ships already in the game no one usese because they're crap and BUFFING something for a change.
---
I don't want anything nerfed, I'm on about a new class of ship that has partly almost introduced when CCP gave us the triangle bros.
---
&gt;CCPlease balance doesn't have to equal Nerf everything to the point no one wants to play.
---
I was planning to resub friday, but OP made me decide against it. However your post gives me hope!
---
I havn't fought any yet, but the ships are fairly popular.
---
You had me at no cynos and no supers in low sec. What an amazing game EVE could be. One if the shittiest feelings when you try to make a pirate life style in eve is just being at the behest of who ever has the most supers around you. You got 0 autonomy and even if you teamed up with someone you couldn't out super any big block in any real way.
---
I really enjoyed carriers being versatile with multiple roles. Also pls bring back refitting !
---
haha wtf
---
Is this real or photoshopped?
---
Low sec groups shouldn't be venturing into null. They should be pirates or faction warfare, null groups go to null.
---
Pretty much this. 
---
I'd love to fly battleships to small gang or even hunt, but that shit would have a carrier or super dropped on it in ten seconds. I've had people drop supers on my solo assault frigate before.
---
Yep.  
---
One super weapon in Tidi does not sound very exciting to play. 
---
I actually don’t mind a shift away from damage projection of Titans to subcaps.  That said, they should still be very dangerous and be worth deploying and skilling into.  Eve needs aspirational ships after all.  
---
To do that, they should be able to apply good damage to structures, capitals and supers with guns and missiles to be even a little relevant.  Why even undock your Titans if they can’t do that much.  In my opinion Titans should be the counter to Super carriers and dread bombs and the go to ship for banging away at large structures. 
---
I would not have a problem with a siege mechanic to make their guns/missiles apply good damage. Anytime you are using a Titan in real combat that should not be a problem, although it would be a negative for anything PvE.  
---
If Titans went to just be a big buff ship, like Rorquals from times gone by, I think it would be pretty sad.
---
The reason capitals are disproportional balanced in terms of ship progression is because their EHP is more closely proportional to the amount of materials required to build a cap. So in in order to make your point valid, they would have to drastically cut down on the material cost.  
---
Your last point also makes no sense and is just a knee jerk typical "grr goons" reaction. A unified force properly living in their space isn't just going to lay over and let solo/small gang plebs walk all over them. Stop bitching about us being responsive and defending our space and grow some balls and actually attack us. As history has shown for nearly 10 years now, the more people try to use CCP to hurt the Imperium it only effects everyone else more. I'm sure you'll make a perfect example of that in your term as CSM.
---
You understand everything we want, let us hire you to lobby inside the CCP idea room.
---
One question, your fit seems a bit low on the tank (only 307 ehp/s with exile on PYFA). How do you deal with high dps spawns such as Vedmaks or drone BS? I'm never comfortable running T5 filaments with anything below 800 ehp/s reps, although I've never ran a dark filament.  Also, can your fit run the rare world ark room?
---
&gt;So rather than fix the problem at its source, you want to require every small gang have "a few" ships that only apply to caps along if they want to roam?
---
It'd apply to anything once it's pinned down by the 52 T3C's everyone roams with currently. T3C's are another problem that hasn't been fixed. They're better than damn near everything else but nobody cares.  
---
&gt;Presumably so you can respond to everyone who complains when you drop caps on their frigate 'just bring x!', right?
---
Nah, mainly so I don't have to read "anything above cruiser was a mistake" and assorted other bullshit. People should have more options Vs Caps, sure. But caps being nerfed yet again isn't going to remove your emotional trauma, and won't stop whoever dropped caps on you from beating you. They'll always have bigger/better/blingier ships and higher numbers to ensure they win engagements. 
---
&gt;Caps should only be force multipliers
---
The guys who are now dropping caps on you have more force to multiply, and will continue to do so.
---
Wait so whats your fucking argument then dipshit, either caps are oppressive and kill small gang or a small gang can kill a cap make yer bloody mind up.
---
Seems like you were not zoomed out enough.
---
&gt; In short I dont care..
---
Yet you whine about people downvoting you *twice*.
---
Seems pretty special to me
---
Honest question... Do you actually own a super or titan?
---
Fuck me, upvoting CODE in 2019, WHAT IS EVE!
---
I guarantee I work harder for my cash than any nerd does grinding ISK (playing a game), so I’ve never had any qualms.
---
Notice how I repeatedly use the word "should" and talk about how these mechanics still work at the strictly subcap level, or how such balance worked in the past? Do you have no fucking reading comprehension abilities at all? I'd imagine not, since you can't seem to follow the thread of a conversation going on outside your own head without degenerating into the internet equivalent of irritated ape grunting.
---
Corporation UI is one of the most neglected aspects of the game. It was shitty to begin with and not much has changed. I’m afraid you’re screwed. You might try a support ticket, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.
